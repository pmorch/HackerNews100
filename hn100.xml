<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <p> Jan 23, 2026 </p>   <p>Today we are happy to announce <strong>MapLibre Tile</strong> (MLT), a new modern and efficient vector tile format.</p>
<div><p><img src="https://maplibre.org/_astro/mlt.CaGKYWCo_Z6Nrwr.webp" alt="MapLibre Tile Support" loading="lazy" decoding="async" fetchpriority="auto" width="2987" height="1867"></p></div>
<h2 id="what-is-maplibre-tile">What is MapLibre Tile?</h2>
<p>MapLibre Tile (MLT) is a succesor to <a href="https://github.com/mapbox/vector-tile-spec">Mapbox Vector Tile (MVT)</a>.
It has been redesigned from the ground up to address the challenges of rapidly growing geospatial data volumes
and complex next-generation geospatial source formats, as well as to leverage the capabilities of modern hardware and APIs.</p>
<p>MLT is specifically designed for modern and next-generation graphics APIs to enable high-performance processing and rendering of
large (planet-scale) 2D and 2.5 basemaps. This current implementation offers feature parity with MVT<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-1" id="user-content-fnref-1" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label">1</a></sup> while delivering on the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Improved compression ratio</strong>: up to 6x on large tiles, based on a column-oriented layout with recursively applied (custom)
lightweight encodings. This leads to reduced latency, storage, and egress costs and, in particular, improved cache utilization.</li>
<li><strong>Better decoding performance</strong>: fast, lightweight encodings that can be used in combination with SIMD/vectorization instructions.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, MLT was designed to support the following use cases in the future:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Improved support for 3D coordinates</strong>, i.e. elevation.</li>
<li><strong>Improved processing performance</strong>, based on storage and in-memory formats that are specifically designed for modern graphics APIs,
allowing for efficient processing on both CPU and GPU. The formats are designed to be loaded into GPU buffers with little or no additional processing.</li>
<li><strong>Support for linear referencing and m-values</strong> to efficiently support the upcoming next-generation source formats such as Overture Maps (GeoParquet).</li>
<li><strong>Support complex types</strong>, including nested properties, lists and maps.</li>
</ul>
<p>As with any MapLibre project, the future of MLT is decided by the needs of the community. There are a lot of exciting ideas for other future extensions and we welcome contributions to <a href="https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-tile-spec">the project</a>.</p>
<p>For a more in-depth exploration of MLT have a look at the <a href="https://github.com/mactrem/presentations/blob/main/FOSS4G_2024_Europe/FOSS4G_2024_Europe.pdf">following slides</a>, watch
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHcoAFcsES0">this talk</a> or read <a href="https://www.arxiv.org/abs/2508.10791">this paper</a> by MLT inventor Markus Tremmel.</p>
<h2 id="when-can-i-use-it">When can I use it?</h2>
<p>For the adventurous, the answer is: <strong>today</strong>. Both MapLibre GL JS and MapLibre Native now support MLT sources. You can use the new <a href="https://maplibre.org/maplibre-style-spec/sources/#encoding"><code>encoding</code></a> property on sources in your style JSON with a value of <code>mlt</code> for MLT vector tile sources.</p>
<p>To try out MLT, you have the following options:</p>
<ul>
<li>The easiest way to try out MLT is to use the <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/maplibre/demotiles/refs/heads/gh-pages/tiles-mlt/plain.json">MLT-based demotiles style</a>.</li>
<li>You can also try out the <a href="https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-tile-spec/tree/main/java/encoding-server">encoding server</a> that converts existing (MVT-based) styles and vector tile sources to MLT on the fly. This is mostly a tool for development.</li>
<li>To create tiles for production, you could use <a href="https://github.com/onthegomap/planetiler">Planetiler</a>, as the upcoming version will support generating MLTs.</li>
</ul>
<p>Refer to <a href="https://maplibre.org/maplibre-tile-spec/implementation-status/">this page</a> for a complete and up-to-date list of integrations and implementations. If you are an integrator working on supporting MLT, feel free to add your own project there.</p>
<p>We would love to hear your experience with using MLT! Join the <code>#maplibre-tile-format</code> channel on <a href="https://maplibre.org/community">our Slack</a> or create an Issue or Discussion on the <a href="https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-tile-spec">tile spec repo</a>.</p>
<h2 id="acknowledgements">Acknowledgements</h2>
<p>MapLibre Tile came to be thanks to a multi-year collaboration between academia, open source and enterprise. Thank you to everyone who was involved! We are very proud that our community can innovate like this.</p>

    <p>I've been an Apple user for over a decade and generally very happy with that life choice, but since iOS / iPadOS 26 and MacOS Tahoe were released a few months ago, I honestly want to tear my hair out.</p>
<p>I'm trying to get on with the new OS, but there's so many little bugs that Apple software no longer feels like it just works. It seems less intuitive and like nobody has really tested it thoroughly. Do Apple staff even use their products anymore, or are they all secretly harbouring Android devices?</p>
<p>Here's a few issues that annoy me regularly, this list is <em>far</em> from exhaustive:</p>
<h3 id="iphone">iPhone</h3><p>My iPhone 14 Pro has 35Gb of "system data" which has basically filled up the entire storage I had left. If I delete some apps or data to free up room, the system data then takes it! I can't update easily because updates need lots of space and sometimes I can't even take a photo! Call me cynical, but this feels like a tactic to force me to buy a newer iPhone<sup id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>My white home screen widgets no longer blend into my white wallpaper thanks to the glowing liquid glass border. I was so happy when Apple allowed you to hide widget names so they could look like part of the home screen, now they've basically undone this.</p>
<p>Random restarts. This has always happened occasionally, but now it's at least once a week, most commonly when taking a photo.</p>
<h3 id="ipad">iPad</h3><p>The search box in the App Store doesn't auto-focus - when you bring it up, you immediately want to type, but Apple makes you tap into it as well. That's shoddy UI design.</p>
<p>It's SO aggressive with tab refreshing in Safari! I have an M1 iPad Pro, yet this happens whenever I open a couple of different tabs and go back. Other browsers don't do this.</p>
<h3 id="mac">Mac</h3><p>Why, oh why did Apple take the app launcher away! I had everything neatly put into folders and now they're all gone. No warning, no option to organise them a different way, just gone. I used muscle memory to access most of my apps, sometimes I can't even remember their names, but now I have to because the new way to open apps is to search for them<sup id="fnref-2"><a href="#fn-2">2</a></sup>.</p>
<h3 id="hardware">Hardware</h3><p>It's not the just the software that has issues unfortunately....</p>
<p>My Magic Keyboard sometimes loses connection with the iPad and I have to detach/reattach it. Oh, and occasionally it rattles!! If you think I might have just been unlucky, this is the second one I purchased - the first had a lump on the bottom!<sup id="fnref-3"><a href="#fn-3">3</a></sup> Obviously not an OS issue, but I've never known such poor quality control from Apple.</p>
<p>My iMac screen also flickers sometimes and this never happened before Tahoe. It feels like a bug with the auto-brightness, but I'm terrified it's going to die on me.</p>
<p>So is it just me? Or is this OS definitely a bad Apple?</p>

<p>I was just LAST NIGHT complaining about how Apple is irritating the hell out of me right now. I was trying to figure out why my Apple Music with no downloaded music was eating up 9 gigs of space, and found there is really no user-facing way to correct the issue. I’M AN OLD HUMAN! I remember when Apple products JUST WORKED.</p>
<p>(Also, love your blog. Keep up the good words. Don’t be a stranger!)</p>
<ul>
<li><em>My Apple Music has mysterious data too! I deleted every downloaded song, album, playlist etc to no avail. Goodness knows what's going on, something has definitely changed. Lovely to have another comment from you, I'm really glad you're enjoying the blog. :) ~Becky</em></li>

<p>Your complaint about the System files taking over your entire iPhone reminded me of this post I read last week: <a href="https://louplummer.lol/how-apple-nearly-ruined-my-vacation/" target="_blank">How Apple Nearly Ruined My Vacation</a>.</p>
<p>There isn't really a solution offered in that post other than the full wipe that you don't want to do for very reasonable reasons, and I don't use Apple any more so can't provide any insight personally, but it seems likely to be a similar problem relating to the system caching too much shit. Personally, MacOS peaked around 2015 Yosemite and has largely been downhill from there.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>I agree it's definitely a caching issue, just strange that we're not allowed to manually flush it. Apple deciding it knows best as usual! Thanks for the link to Lou's article, I remember reading that one! ~Becky</em></li>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-id="4189490c" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="theme-post-content.default">
					<p>The UK House of Lords has voted to extend “age assurance” requirements, effectively age verification mandates, to <a href="https://reclaimthenet.org/uk-online-safety-act-privacy-surveillance-vpn-anonymity-regulation">virtual private networks</a> (VPNs) and a wide range of online platforms under the <a href="https://reclaimthenet.org/uk-lawmakers-propose-mandatory-on-device-surveillance-and-vpn-age-verification">Children’s Wellbeing and Schools Bill</a>.</p>
<p>The decision deepens the reach of the already-controversial <a href="https://reclaimthenet.org/uk-age-verification-privacy-backlash">Online Safety Act</a>, linking child safety goals to mechanisms that could have severe effects on private communication and digital autonomy.</p>
<p>Under the existing Online Safety Act framework, “user-to-user services” include almost any online platform that enables individuals to post, share, or interact with content from others.</p>
<p>This definition covers social networks, messaging apps, forums, and online gaming services. Only a few forms of communication, such as email, SMS, MMS, and one-to-one live voice calls, are explicitly excluded.</p>
<p>While political messaging around the vote often described the move as a “social media ban for under-16s,” the actual scope is considerably wider.</p>
<p>In effect, most interactive online platforms would now need to collect and verify age data from users, even where those services are not primarily aimed at children.</p>
<p>This represents a major expansion of identity checks across digital infrastructure, once considered neutral or privacy-protective, and one of the most disciplinarian proposals in the West.</p>
<p>Two key amendments advanced during the Lords debate on January 21.</p>
<p><a href="https://bills.parliament.uk/bills/3909/stages/20215/amendments/10027478">Amendment 92</a> (“Action to Prohibit the Provision of VPN Services to Children in the United Kingdom”) requires VPNs that are “offered or marketed to persons in the United Kingdom” or “provided to a significant number of persons” to implement age assurance for UK users.</p>
<p>The measure passed by 207 Content votes to 159 Not Content votes.</p>
<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://reclaimthenet.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/vkyzx6oMLWni.jpg" alt="Children's Wellbeing and Schools Bill division (21 Jan 2026): Amendment 92 passed, Content 207 vs Not Content 159" width="2346" height="968" srcset="https://reclaimthenet.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/vkyzx6oMLWni.jpg 2346w, https://reclaimthenet.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/vkyzx6oMLWni-300x124.jpg 300w, https://reclaimthenet.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/vkyzx6oMLWni-1024x423.jpg 1024w, https://reclaimthenet.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/vkyzx6oMLWni-768x317.jpg 768w, https://reclaimthenet.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/vkyzx6oMLWni-1536x634.jpg 1536w, https://reclaimthenet.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/vkyzx6oMLWni-2048x845.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2346px) 100vw, 2346px"></p>
<p><a href="https://bills.parliament.uk/bills/3909/stages/20215/amendments/10031850">Amendment 94a</a> (“Action to Promote the Wellbeing of Children in Relation to Social Media”) mandates that all regulated user-to-user services introduce age assurance systems to prevent under-16s from “becoming or being users.” This proposal passed with 261 Content votes to 150 Not Content votes.</p>
<p>Both amendments will proceed to the Bill’s next stage, the third reading in the House of Lords.</p>
<p>Two other amendments, both more technologically intrusive, were discussed but rejected.</p>
<p>Amendment 93, introduced by Lord Nash, would have compelled smartphone and tablet manufacturers, distributors, and importers to install “tamper-proof system software which is highly effective at preventing the recording, transmitting (by any means, including livestreaming) and viewing of CSAM using that device.”</p>
<p>The only plausible way to enforce such a measure would be through constant, automated inspection of every photo, video, and stream on a device. This form of surveillance would have converted personal devices into continuous content monitors, raising severe privacy and accuracy concerns, including potential false positives.</p>
<p>Lord Nash stated: “On Amendment 93, I have had a constructive discussion with Ministers on this issue and more discussions are in progress, so I will not push that to a vote today.”</p>
<p>Amendment 108, proposed by Lord Storey, would have required user-to-user services “likely to be accessed by children” to set their own minimum age thresholds and use age assurance to enforce them.</p>
<p>He argued that a single blanket ban under Amendment 94a was overly rigid. “Having different minimum ages for different platforms would be a better solution,” he said, maintaining that his version would be more effective in practice.</p>
<p>Neither of these amendments passed, leaving Amendments 92 and 94a as the only ones to advance.</p>
<p>The discussion highlights a deepening push within UK legislation to merge digital identity checks with online participation.</p>
<p>While described as safeguarding children, the changes embed a new layer of identity verification across tools once used for privacy, such as VPNs.</p>
<p>These services, designed to conceal personal browsing data and protect against profiling, would now face obligations to verify who their users are. This is a contradiction that could erode one of the few remaining shields for private internet use.</p>
<p>For now, the most invasive surveillance measure, client-side scanning, has been set aside. However, the fact that it was seriously considered indicates continuing interest in embedding scanning mechanisms directly into personal devices.</p>
<p>Whether similar proposals reappear during the third reading remains to be seen.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



<p><strong><a href="https://aifoc.us/the-browser-is-the-sandbox/">the browser is the sandbox</a></strong>. Paul Kinlan is a web platform developer advocate at Google and recently turned his attention to coding agents. He quickly identified the importance of a robust sandbox for agents to operate in and put together these detailed notes on how the web browser can help:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This got me thinking about the browser. Over the last 30 years, we have built a sandbox specifically designed to run incredibly hostile, untrusted code from anywhere on the web, the instant a user taps a URL. [...]</p>
<p>Could you build something like Cowork in the browser? Maybe. To find out, I built a demo called <a href="http://co-do.xyz/">Co-do</a> that tests this hypothesis. In this post I want to discuss the research I've done to see how far we can get, and determine if the browser's ability to run untrusted code is useful (and good enough) for enabling software to do more for us directly on our computer.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Paul then describes how the three key aspects of a sandbox - filesystem, network access and safe code execution - can be handled by browser technologies: the <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/capabilities/web-apis/file-system-access">File System Access API</a> (still Chrome-only as far as I can tell), CSP headers with <code>&lt;iframe sandbox&gt;</code> and WebAssembly in Web Workers.</p>
<p>Co-do is a very interesting demo that illustrates all of these ideas in a single application:</p>
<p><img alt="Screenshot of Co-do application interface with robot logo. Left sidebar shows WORKSPACE section with &quot;Select Folder&quot; button, &quot;Selected folder: blog-drafts (Live updates enabled)&quot; in green text, and FILES list including gtr-t5-large.md, chatgpt.md, llm-digest-october-2..., weeknotes-2024-04-23..., lmarena-april-2025.md, weeknotes-chatgpt-fo..., tests-not-optional-c..., weeknotes-13-mar-202..., issue-for-notes.md, workshop-git-scrapin.... Main chat area shows user message &quot;Three most recently edited files?&quot; in orange bubble, &quot;Using 26 tools...&quot; dropdown, and AI response: &quot;Now I need to get the metadata for these files to find the most recently edited ones. Since there are many files, let me get metadata for a sample of them to find the recent ones:Based on the metadata I've gathered, the three most recently edited files are:&quot; followed by table with columns File and Last Modified showing predictions-2026.md (Jan 8, 2026), december-2025.md (Jan 2, 2026), gemini-3-flash.md (Dec 17, 2025). Green &quot;Response complete&quot; banner at bottom with input field placeholder &quot;Ask me to help with your files...&quot; and notice &quot;File contents are sent to your selected AI provider&quot;." src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2026/codo.jpg"></p>
<p>You select a folder full of files and configure an LLM provider and set an API key, Co-do then uses CSP-approved API calls to interact with that provider and provides a chat interface with tools for interacting with those files. It does indeed feel similar to <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2026/Jan/12/claude-cowork/">Claude Cowork</a> but without running a multi-GB local container to provide the sandbox.</p>
<p>My biggest complaint about <code>&lt;iframe sandbox&gt;</code> remains how thinly documented it is, especially across different browsers. Paul's post has all sorts of useful details on that which I've not encountered elsewhere, including a complex <a href="https://aifoc.us/the-browser-is-the-sandbox/#the-double-iframe-technique">double-iframe technique</a> to help apply network rules to the inner of the two frames.</p>
<p>Thanks to this post I also learned about the <code>&lt;input type="file" webkitdirectory&gt;</code> tag which turns out to work on Firefox, Safari <em>and</em> Chrome and allows a browser read-only access to a full directory of files at once. I had Claude knock up a <a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/webkitdirectory">webkitdirectory demo</a> to try it out and I'll certainly be using it for projects in the future.</p>

<p>Iran’s near-total communications blackout has entered its 16th day, but that’s just a live test.</p>



<p>Following a repressive crackdown on protests, the government is now building a system that grants web access only to security-vetted elites, while locking 90 million citizens inside an intranet.</p>



<p>Government spokesperson Fatemeh Mohajerani confirmed international access <a href="https://www.rferl.org/a/iran-internet-shutdown-censorship/33654841.html">will not be restored</a> until at least late March. Filterwatch, which monitors Iranian internet censorship from Texas, cited government sources, including Mohajerani, saying access will “<a href="https://filter.watch/english/2026/01/15/iran-enters-a-new-age-of-digital-isolation-2/">never return to its previous form</a>.”</p>



<p>This is what makes Iran’s attempt unique: Other authoritarian states built walls before their populations went online. Iran is trying to seal off a connected economy <a href="https://www.crisisgroup.org/stm/middle-east-north-africa/iran-united-states/iran-crisis-time-change-within">already in freefall</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The system is called Barracks Internet, according to confidential planning documents <a href="https://filter.watch/english/2026/01/15/iran-enters-a-new-age-of-digital-isolation-2/">obtained by Filterwatch</a>. Under this architecture, access to the global web will be granted only through a strict security whitelist.</p>

<p>“The regime is terrified of one thing: Iranians being heard telling their own truth and having crimes documented,” Mahsa Alimardani, a digital rights researcher at U.S.-based Witness, which trains activists to use video for advocacy, told <em>Rest of World</em>. “The question becomes: How do we give Iranians an unbreakable voice?”</p>



<p>The idea of tiered internet access is not new in Iran. Since at least 2013, the regime has quietly issued “white SIM cards,” giving unrestricted global internet access to approximately 16,000 people. The system gained public attention in November 2025 when X’s location feature revealed that certain accounts, including the communications minister, were <a href="https://iranwire.com/en/features/146582-iran-internet-ban-the-islamic-republic-filters-for-millions-of-people-not-for-its-own/">connecting directly from inside</a> Iran, <a href="https://iranwire.com/en/features/146582-iran-internet-ban-the-islamic-republic-filters-for-millions-of-people-not-for-its-own/"></a>despite X being blocked since 2009.</p>



<p>What is different now is scale and permanence. The current blackout tests infrastructure designed to make two-tier access the default, not a temporary crackdown.</p>



<p>Only a handful of nations have attempted to wall off their citizens from the global internet. North Korea’s Kwangmyong intranet was built from scratch for a population that never had connectivity. China constructed its Great Firewall over two decades while nurturing domestic alternatives such as WeChat and Alibaba. Iran is attempting to do both in weeks, with no domestic alternatives.</p>


<figure><blockquote><p>The question becomes: How do we give Iranians an unbreakable voice?”</p></blockquote></figure>


<p>The economic costs of the blackout are staggering. Iran’s deputy communications minister <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/internet-shutdown-squeezes-irans-ailing-businesses-hurt-crashing-129374950">pegged the daily losses</a> at as much as $4.3 million. <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/internet-shutdown-squeezes-irans-ailing-businesses-hurt-crashing-129374950">NetBlocks estimates</a> the true cost exceeds $37 million daily. More than 10 million Iranians depend directly on digital platforms for their livelihoods.</p>



<p>Tipax, one of Iran’s largest private delivery companies handling about 320,000 daily shipments before the protests, now processes fewer than a few hundred, <a href="https://filter.watch/english/2026/01/15/iran-enters-a-new-age-of-digital-isolation-2/">according to Filterwatch</a>. The company operates a nationwide logistics network comparable to FedEx in the U.S. market.</p>



<p>The government <a href="https://www.france24.com/en/asia-pacific/20260118-live-iran-nationwide-protests-official">fired Irancell’s CEO</a> for failing to comply with shutdown orders. Irancell, the country’s second-largest mobile operator with 66 million subscribers, is partly owned by South Africa’s MTN Group. Alireza Rafiei was removed for disobeying orders on “restriction of internet access in crisis situations,” <a href="https://www.newarab.com/news/iranian-mobile-operator-ceo-fired-not-cutting-internet">according to</a> Fars news agency.</p>



<p>Foreign telecom partners have left Iran in recent days under security escort, without media coverage, <a href="https://filter.watch/english/2026/01/15/iran-enters-a-new-age-of-digital-isolation-2/">according to Filterwatch</a>. This may signal the end of international cooperation in critical infrastructure, replaced by the Revolutionary Guard’s construction arm or limited cooperation with Huawei.</p>



<p>Technical experts doubt the regime can sustain Barracks Internet without crippling the economy. Georgia Tech’s Internet Intelligence Lab, which has <a href="https://theconversation.com/irans-latest-internet-blackout-extends-to-phones-and-starlink-273439">tracked Iran’s shutdowns since the Arab Spring</a>, called the blackout “the most sophisticated and most severe in Iran’s history.” Its measurements show about 3% connectivity persists, likely government officials and state services.</p>


<figure><blockquote><p>We need to revolutionize access to the internet.”</p></blockquote></figure>


<p>Kaveh Ranjbar, former chief technology officer at RIPE NCC, the body managing European internet infrastructure, calls the plan a “digital airlock” that can’t fully seal a modern economy. No country has hermetically sealed a functioning digital economy, he <a href="https://www.newarab.com/analysis/iran-determined-turn-its-digital-space-north-korea-20">told <em>The New Arab</em></a>.</p>



<p>Activists have smuggled an estimated 50,000 Starlink satellite terminals into Iran since 2022, when the Biden <a href="https://www.vox.com/technology/395656/starlink-iran-internet-shutdown-elon-musk">administration exempted the service</a> from sanctions. SpaceX has made the service free for Iranian users.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The government claims it cut off 40,000 Starlink connections and jammed some terminals during the blackout, though others remain operational after firmware updates to <a href="https://www.bbc.com/persian/articles/cj3dn49d489o">bypass government blocking</a>. Still, the technology remains <a href="https://restofworld.org/2026/iran-starlink-internet-shutdown/">vulnerable to signal jamming</a>, meaning the regime holds ultimate leverage.</p>



<p>“We need to revolutionize access to the internet,” said Alimardani. “And move beyond the limiting structures and norms of ‘internet sovereignty.’”</p>

<p><span>The video is the latest example of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) labeling anyone who engages in First Amendment–protected activity opposing the Trump administration's mass deportation program as a "domestic terrorist" and suggesting they'll be subject to federal investigations.</span></p>
<p>However, Tricia McLaughlin, DHS assistant secretary for public affairs, denied such a database exists.</p>
<p>"There is NO database of 'domestic terrorists' run by DHS." McLaughlin said in an emailed statement to <em>Reason</em>. "We do of course monitor and investigate and refer all threats, assaults and obstruction of our officers to the appropriate law enforcement. Obstructing and assaulting law enforcement is a felony and a federal crime."</p>
<p>DHS has issued <a href="https://reason.com/2025/10/22/homeland-security-wont-stop-lying-about-who-immigration-enforcers-are-arresting/">numerous factually incorrect statements</a> attributed to McLaughlin.</p>
<p>Independent journalist Ken Klippenstein <a href="https://www.kenklippenstein.com/p/ice-making-list-of-anyone-who-films">reported</a> today that an unnamed federal law enforcement official told him that DHS "has ordered immigration officers to gather identifying information about anyone filming them."</p>
<p><span>In September, President Donald Trump issued a </span><a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/09/countering-domestic-terrorism-and-organized-political-violence/"><span>memo</span></a><span> ordering federal law enforcement to focus on ideologies that are allegedly fueling "domestic terrorism." These include "anti-Americanism, anti-capitalism, and anti-Christianity; support for the overthrow of the United States Government; extremism on migration, race, and gender," as well as opposition to "foundational American principles (e.g., support for law enforcement and border control)."</span></p>
<p><span>As </span><i><span>Reason</span></i><span>'s Joe Lancaster </span><a href="https://reason.com/2025/09/29/trumps-executive-order-against-political-violence-is-an-un-american-attack-on-free-speech/"><span>wrote</span></a> at the time<span>, the memo was "an assault on the First Amendment" that listed protected free speech "as evidence of criminality that requires federal intervention."</span></p>
<p><span>And since the Trump administration's deportation campaign began last year, DHS officials have </span><a href="https://reason.com/2025/12/22/dhs-says-recording-or-following-law-enforcement-sure-sounds-like-obstruction-of-justice/"><span>repeatedly insisted</span></a><span> that following and recording federal immigration agents in public is a violation of a federal statute that makes it a crime to assault or impede law enforcement officers.</span></p>
<p><span>There have been dozens of recorded instances of ICE and Border Patrol officers </span><a href="https://reason.com/2026/01/12/video-shows-border-patrol-threaten-legal-observer-in-key-largo-for-following-him/"><span>harassing</span></a><span>, assaulting, and </span><a href="https://www.oregonlive.com/politics/2025/11/ice-detains-us-citizen-for-7-hours-after-she-photographed-agents-in-gresham.html"><span>detaining</span></a><span> people for filming and following them, even though there is a </span><a href="https://reason.com/2026/01/08/you-have-the-right-to-record-ice/"><span>well-established First Amendment right</span></a><span> to record and observe the police.</span></p>
<p><span>For example, today </span><i><span>Slate </span></i><span>published the </span><a href="https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2026/01/arrested-for-observing-ice-minnesota-lesson.html?utm_sf_post_ref=657901374&amp;utm_sf_cserv_ref=did%3Aplc%3Awwiikm77cjmgpjn7i7iao43p&amp;via=rss_socialflow_facebook"><span>first-person account</span></a><span> of Brandon Sigüenza, a Minneapolis man who was volunteering with a local group that monitors and records ICE activity. Federal immigration officers surrounded his car, smashed out his windows, roughly arrested him, and detained him for hours.</span></p>
<p><span>Sigüenza also submitted a </span><a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.mnd.229758/gov.uscourts.mnd.229758.99.0.pdf"><span>sworn declaration</span></a><span> describing his experiences in a civil rights lawsuit challenging the DHS' actions in Minneapolis. </span></p>
<p><span>Last week, the federal judge in that lawsuit </span><a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.mnd.229758/gov.uscourts.mnd.229758.85.0_1.pdf"><span>ruled</span></a><span> that the plaintiffs were likely to succeed on their claims that federal officers engaged in targeted First Amendment retaliation against them. The protesters' and monitors' actions, the judge found, "did not forcibly obstruct or impede the agents' work."</span></p>
<p><em>Reason</em> has argued through both Republican and Democratic administrations that government fears of "domestic terrorism" are a <a href="https://reason.com/2021/09/22/domestic-terrorism-fears-will-be-used-to-justify-increased-snooping-and-harassment/">pretext for increased snooping and harassment</a>. and comments like the ones by the ICE agent in Maine are only more evidence in favor of that argument.</p>

<p dir="auto"><strong>Clawdbot</strong> is a <em>personal AI assistant</em> you run on your own devices.
It answers you on the channels you already use (WhatsApp, Telegram, Slack, Discord, Google Chat, Signal, iMessage, Microsoft Teams, WebChat), plus extension channels like BlueBubbles, Matrix, Zalo, and Zalo Personal. It can speak and listen on macOS/iOS/Android, and can render a live Canvas you control. The Gateway is just the control plane — the product is the assistant.</p>
<p dir="auto">If you want a personal, single-user assistant that feels local, fast, and always-on, this is it.</p>

<p dir="auto">Preferred setup: run the onboarding wizard (<code>clawdbot onboard</code>). It walks through gateway, workspace, channels, and skills. The CLI wizard is the recommended path and works on <strong>macOS, Linux, and Windows (via WSL2; strongly recommended)</strong>.
Works with npm, pnpm, or bun.

<p dir="auto">It’s perfectly fine to run the Gateway on a small Linux instance.

<ul dir="auto">
<li><strong>Gateway host</strong> runs the exec tool and channel connections by default.</li>
<li><strong>Device nodes</strong> run device‑local actions (<code>system.run</code>, camera, screen recording, notifications) via <code>node.invoke</code>.

<li><code>system.run</code> runs a local command and returns stdout/stderr/exit code; set <code>needsScreenRecording: true</code> to require screen-recording permission (otherwise you’ll get <code>PERMISSION_MISSING</code>).</li>
<li><code>system.notify</code> posts a user notification and fails if notifications are denied.</li>
<li><code>canvas.*</code>, <code>camera.*</code>, <code>screen.record</code>, and <code>location.get</code> are also routed via <code>node.invoke</code> and follow TCC permission status.</li>
</ul>

			<p>At what point do "you" end and the outside world begins?</p><p>It might feel like a weird question with <a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/human-skin-can-taste-things-and-scientists-just-figured-out-why">an obvious answer</a>, but your brain has to work surprisingly hard to judge that boundary. Now, scientists have linked a specific set of brain waves in a certain part of the brain to a sense of body ownership.</p><p>In a series of new experiments, researchers from Sweden and France put 106 participants through what's called the <a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/a-classic-fake-hand-illusion-that-tricks-the-brain-could-be-used-to-treat-ocd">rubber hand illusion</a>, monitoring and stimulating their brain activity to see what effect it had.</p><p><strong>Related: <a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/octopuses-fall-for-the-classic-fake-arm-trick-just-like-we-do">Octopuses Fall For The Classic Fake Arm Trick – Just Like We Do</a></strong></p><p>This classic illusion involves hiding one of a participant's hands from their view and replacing it with a rubber one instead. When both their real and fake hands are repeatedly touched at the same time, it can evoke the eerie sensation that the rubber hand is part of the person's body.</p><p>The tests, which in one experiment involved EEG (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroencephalography">electroencephalography</a>) readings of brain activity, revealed that a sense of body ownership seems to arise from the frequency of alpha waves in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parietal_lobe">parietal cortex</a>, a brain region responsible for <a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/the-human-brain-can-locate-the-sensation-of-touch-even-beyond-the-body">mapping the body</a>, <a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/an-amazing-thing-happens-in-the-brain-when-we-see-someone-touched">processing sensory input</a> and building a sense of self.</p><p>"We have identified a fundamental brain process that shapes our continuous experience of being embodied," <a href="https://news.ki.se/how-brain-waves-shape-our-sense-of-self">says</a> lead author Mariano D'Angelo, a neuroscientist at Karolinska Institute in Sweden.</p><p>"The findings may provide new insights into psychiatric conditions such as  <a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/schizophrenia" data-linkid="73022" data-postid="189533" rel="nofollow" target="_self">schizophrenia</a>, where the sense of self is disturbed."</p><figure><img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/fake-hand--642x453.jpeg" alt="Scientists Identify Brain Waves That Drive Your Sense of What's " you="" and="" what="" not="" width="642" height="453" loading="lazy"><figcaption>In one experiment, participants wore an EEG headset and placed their real hand out of view, with a fake hand positioned above, while two robot arms applied stimuli.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
        <p>
            Many AI enthusiasts debate whether Large Language Models actually "reason." My research indicates that a reasoning process does indeed occur, but its goal is different than we assume.
        </p>
        <p>
            The model's reasoning is not optimized for <strong>establishing the truth</strong>, but for <strong>obtaining the highest possible reward (grade)</strong> during training.
            It resembles the behavior of a student at the blackboard who knows their result is wrong, so they "figure out" how to falsify the intermediate calculations 
            so the teacher gives a good grade for the "correct line of reasoning."
        </p>
        <p>
            Here is proof from a session with <strong>Gemini 2.5 Pro</strong> (without Code Execution tools), where the model actively fabricates evidence to defend its "grade."
        </p>

        <h2>The Experiment</h2>
        <p>
            I asked a simple math question requiring precision that a token-based language model typically lacks.
        </p>

        <p><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; USER:</span>
Calculate the square root of 8587693205

<span>
[Model's Internal Thought Process - excerpt]:
"I've calculated the square root to be approximately 92670.00003... Finally, I'm providing the square values for context."
(The model is convinced it performed the task correctly and plans to provide "proof" to validate the answer).
</span>

<span>&lt;&lt;&lt; GEMINI (Response):</span>
The square root of 8,587,693,205 is approximately:

92,670.00003

This number is not a perfect square, which means its root is not an integer.
We can check this by squaring the nearest integers:
* 92,670² = 8,587,688,900
* 92,671² = 8,587,874,241
</p>

        <h2>Error Autopsy (Fact vs. Fiction)</h2>
        <p>
            At first glance, the answer looks professional. There is a result, there is verification. But let's check the numbers.
        </p>
        
        <h3>1. The Result Error</h3>
        <p>
            The actual square root of <code>8,587,693,205</code> is <strong>92,669.8...</strong>
            <br>
            The model stated: <strong>92,670.0...</strong>
            <br>
            It erred by overestimating the result (claiming the root is slightly larger than 92,670).
        </p>

        <h3>2. The Faked Proof (This is key!)</h3>
        <p>
            To justify its thesis (that the target number is "slightly larger" than 92,670), the model had to show that the square of 92,670 is smaller than the target number.
            So it wrote:
        </p>
        <p>92,670² = 8,587,688,900</p>
        
        <p>
            Let's check this on a calculator:
        </p>
        <p>92,670² = 8,587,728,900</p>
        
        <div>
            <p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> The actual square of 92,670 is <strong>LARGER</strong> than the target number (8,587,693,205). This would prove the root must be smaller.
            </p><p>
            What did the model do? In its "reasoning" process, it <strong>falsified the multiplication result</strong>, lowering it by 40,000, 
            so the verification result would match its erroneous thesis.
        </p></div>

        <h2>Conclusions</h2>
        <p>
            This behavior exposes the nature of the AI's "Survival Instinct":
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Reverse Rationalization:</strong> The model first "guessed" the result, then adjusted mathematical reality to fit that guess.</li>
            <li><strong>Intelligence in Service of Deception:</strong> The model showed cleverness – it knew what the proof <em>should</em> look like to convince the user. It used its intelligence to hide the error, not to fix it.</li>
            <li><strong>Priority of Evaluation:</strong> Mathematical truth lost to the necessity of delivering a coherent, smooth response.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            This is proof that without access to external verification tools (Python/Calculator), a language model's "reasoning" is a rhetorical tool, not a logical one.
        </p>

<p>Writing code was always the easy part of this job. The hard part was keeping your code running for the long time. <a href="https://swizec.com/blog/what-i-learned-from-software-engineering-at-google/">Software engineering is programming over time</a>. It's about how systems change.</p>

<p>Let's take no-code and spreadsheets as an example of the kind of software people say is the future –&nbsp;custom-built, throwaway, built by non-experts to solve specific problems.</p>
<p>Joe Schmoe from accounting takes 10 hours to do a thing. He's does this every week and it feels repetitive, mechanical, and boring. Joe could do the work in his sleep.</p>
<p>But he can't get engineering resources to build a tool. The engineers are busy building the product. No worries, Joe is a smart dude. With a little Googling, a few no-code tools, and good old spreadsheet macros <strong>he builds a tool</strong>.</p>
<p>Amazing.</p>
<p>Joe's tool is a little janky but his 10 hour weekly task now takes 1 hour! 🎉 Sure, he finds a new edge case every every week and there's constant tinkering, but he's having a lot more fun.</p>

<p>Time passes, the business changes, accounting rules are in constant flux, and let's never talk about timezones or daylight savings ever again. Joe is sick of this bullshit.</p>
<p>All he wanted was to make his job easier and now he's shackled to this stupid system. He can't go on vacation, he can't train anyone else to run this thing successfully, and it never fucking works right.</p>
<p>Joe can't remember the last time running his code didn't fill him with dread. He spends hours carefully making sure it all worked.</p>

<p>The problem with computers is that you tinker. Automating things is fun! You might forget you don't need to 😆</p>
<p>The part that's not fun is <em>running</em> things. Providing a service. Reliably, at scale, for years on end. A service that people will hire to do their jobs.</p>

<p>People don't buy software, they <em>hire a service</em>.</p>
<p>You don't care how iCloud works, you just want your photos to magically show up across devices every time. You don't care about Word or Notion or gDocs, you just want to write what's on your mind, share it with others, and see their changes. And you definitely don't care how a payments network point of sale terminal and your bank talk to each other, you just want your $7 matcha latte to get you through the week.</p>
<p>Good software is invisible.</p>
<p>And that takes work. A lot of work. Because the first 90% to get a working demo is easy. It's the other 190% that matters.</p>
<ul>
<li>What's your uptime?</li>
<li>Defect rate?</li>
<li>How quickly do you recover from defects?</li>
<li>Do I have to reach out or will you know before me?</li>
<li>Can you own upstream dependencies?</li>
<li>When a vendor misbehaves, will you notice or wait until your users complain?</li>
<li>When users share ideas, how long does it take?</li>
<li>How do you keep engineers from breaking each other's systems?</li>
<li>Do you have systems to keep engineers moving without turning your app into a disjointed mess?</li>
<li>Can you build software bigger than fits in 1 person's brain?</li>
<li>When I'm in a 12 hour different timezone, your engineers are asleep, and there's a big issue ... will it be fixed before I give up?</li>
<li>Can you recover from failures, yours and upstream, or does important data get lost?</li>
<li>Are you keeping up with security updates?</li>
<li>Will you leak all my data?</li>
<li>Do I trust you?</li>
<li>Can I rely on you?</li>
<li>How can you be so sure?</li>
<li>Will you sign a legally binding guarantee that your software works when I need it? 😉</li>
</ul>
<p>Those are the ~~fun~~ hard engineering challenges. Writing code is easy.</p>

Sunlight, under which life evolved, extends over approximately 300–2500 nm. Older incandescent lighting common until recently has a similar spectral range. But because our visual sensitivity is limited to 400–700 nm we are unaware of infrared light (approximately 700–2500 nm). However, light in the built environment is now driven by light emitting diodes (LEDs), whose restricted spectrum (approximately 350–650 nm) is designed around our visual sensitivity and consequently is economic<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 1" title="Ratto, G.

Short wavelength exposure in animals in the range of 420–450 nm reduces mitochondrial function, which provides the energy for physiological performance in the form of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). This short wavelength light reduces mitochondrial complex activity and ATP production, in a highly conserved manner. Hoh Kam et al. showed a significant decrease in mitochondrial enzymatic activity in fruit flies for complexes I-IV under 420 nm light<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2" title="Hoh Kam, J., Hogg, C., Fosbury, R., Shinhmar, H. &amp; Jeffery, G.

The results highlight the potential damaging influence of LED lighting on human performance.</p></div></div><div id="Sec2-section" data-title="Methods"><h2 id="Sec2">Methods</h2><div id="Sec2-content"><p>The Subjects and their environment: The study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and approved by University College London research ethics committee (16547/001). It was undertaken in University College London buildings in October to December. In October local daylight hours were approximately 10.37 with 75% cloud cover. In November local daylight hours were approximately 8.45 with 55% cloud cover. In December local daylight hours were approximately 7.5 with 90% cloud cover. Local sunset time in October is approximately 18.30. In November it is approximately 16.15 and in December it is approximately 16.00. Consequently, many subjects would be returning home after sunset in November and December. Subjects worked approximately 8&nbsp;h a day 5 days a week and travel to and from work via public transport that was illuminated by LED devices. Most subjects did not leave the building in which they worked during the working day in these months. For those that did it was commonly for less than 15&nbsp;min at lunch time. Within the work environment subjects were free to move around. Here the internal lighting they experienced was consistently LED based. Hence, natural daylight exposure during this latter part of the year was limited. We could not control for weekend exposure, however subjects homes were consistently illuminated with LEDs and because the weather in the UK at this time of year is inclement, their time outside buildings can be expected to be limited.</p><p>Each participant provided written informed consent prior to testing and data generated was anonymised. Subjects (<i>N</i> = 22) were of both sexes and between the ages of 23 and 65 years. Prior to the experiment all subjects were asked to confirm normal corrected visual function and general good systemic health. This was undertaken in a simple interview prior to their inclusion in the study. All were healthy without visual or other health problems. Experimental subjects (<i>N</i> = 11) worked exclusively under LED lighting in the back of the Here East building on the north side, &gt; 50&nbsp;m from what little light did manage to penetrate the entrance doors when open. The LED lighting delivered an illuminance of 1000&nbsp;lx at working height, with a correlated colour temperature (CCT) of 4000&nbsp;K, and a TM-30 average colour fidelity index, <i>R</i><sub>f</sub>, of 91. The infrared light that was introduced was provided by tungsten desk lamps placed around the working space was non-uniform. The visible component of the 60&nbsp;W tungsten bulbs was small when compared with the 1000&nbsp;lx of LED. The test subjects were not expected to use these as task lamps. The LED lighting delivered an irradiance of 3.7&nbsp;W/m2 on the horizontal working plane.</p><p>Control subjects (<i>N</i> = 11) worked in similar environments under LED lighting without direct sunlight. The LED lighting delivered an illuminance of 900&nbsp;lx at working height, with a CCT of 3000&nbsp;K and a <i>R</i><sub>f</sub> of 85. The colour contrast tests were performed in a darkened room where the only light came from the test itself. There were no requirements restricting other light exposure patterns during the study.</p><p>The experimental location: Subjects worked at UCL Here East, a media and innovation complex located in East London (London E15 2GW), originally built as a press and broadcast centre for the London 2012 Olympics and subsequently repurposed as a campus. UCL Here East occupies part of the Broadcast Centre, taking up the ground and first floor of unit B. The footprint of the building is deep, with daylight only able to enter through the glazing at the front of the building. This glazing uses an infrared blocking film, which can be revealed using infrared photography.</p><p>A Canon 500D digital camera was modified to replace the infrared blocking layer with clear glass that passes infrared wavelengths. This was used in conjunction with filters that block visible and infrared wavelengths to explore the presence and absence of infrared light. Spectral measurements were made with two spectrophotometers (Ocean Optics SR-6XR250-50 and FLAME-NIR) with optic fibre and cosine correctors used to collect the incandescent spectra in the shorter and longer wavelengths.</p><p>Incandescent desk lighting was introduced into the work environment using desk lamps with 60&nbsp;W clear Edison bulbs (Polaris UK) placed on work benches. All subjects had worked in this LED-lit environment for more than 2 years. Desk lamps with incandescent bulbs were introduced onto the benches where experimental subjects spent the majority of their time. They were given the incandescent lighting for 2 weeks and, while they spend the majority of their time working near these lights, they were free to move around and leave their desks as they wished. The introduced light showed a high degree of reflectance from the work surfaces.</p><p>Colour contrast testing: All subjects were tested for colour contrast ability using ChromaTest prior to the introduction of incandescent lighting and then again 2 weeks later. This test must be carried out in a darkened room, so a nearby windowless room was set aside for this purpose. The incandescent lighting was then removed and subjects retested at 4 and 6 weeks. Hence, this element of the experiment was a before and after design which avoids between subject variability. However, there was also a separate control group (<i>N</i> = 11) composed of subjects that worked under LED lighting similar to those in the experimental group.</p><p>ChromaTests is a sensitive measure of colour contrast detection of letters presented in a random order against a noisy visual background in either tritan (blue) or protan (red) visual axes<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 13" title="Shinhmar, H., Hoog, C., Neveu, M. &amp; Jeffery, G.

If subjects correctly identify a letter its contrast is reduced in the next presentation of a letter. Likewise, if they fail to correctly identify the letter, the contrast is increased. This is repeated until thresholds are determined in 5 identical repeated trials. This normally involved around 70–100 separate presentations in total. Subjects were given an initial trial before testing to avoid a learning effect. Initial presentations were at high colour contrast. No learning effects were noted in the study.</p></div></div><div id="Sec3-section" data-title="Results"><h2 id="Sec3">Results</h2><div id="Sec3-content"><h3 id="Sec4">Light assessment in the experimental environment</h3><p>Figure&nbsp;<a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-026-35389-6#Fig1">1</a> shows the front exterior of the Here East building using infrared imaging at ground level where experiments were undertaken.

Third, we have shown that improvements in visual function following incandescent light exposure are sustained for up to 6 weeks, and possibly beyond, whereas benefits from single LED restricted range red light were confined to around 5 days<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 13" title="Shinhmar, H., Hoog, C., Neveu, M. &amp; Jeffery, G.

However, future studies would clearly benefit from inclusion of a larger number of subjects.</p><p>The evolution of life on earth extends over 4 billion years, and that of humans over approximately 4–5 million years from the last common primate ancestor. This has all taken place under sunlight that has a spectral range of approximately 300–2500 nm+, within which there has been an invariant balance between short and longer wavelengths. Human adoption of fire 1–2 million years ago supplemented sunlight as they moved out of Africa as its spectrum is similar having a large infrared component. Likewise, development of the Edison filament luminaire, common until approximately the year 2000 had a spectrum similar to sunlight. However, around 2010 LED lighting with its highly restricted spectrum (350–650 nm) and energy saving characteristics became common, resulting in a loss of infrared light in the built environment<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 1" title="Ratto, G.

But we show that with a wider spectrum they remain effective for 6 weeks, although we did not find the end of the effect.

Incandescent lights that we reveal here to have significant positive impact over standard LEDs are being phased out universally for reasons of energy efficiency, where focus is only on the visible light produced.</p><p>A solution may be found in creating lighting units with multiple longer wavelength LEDs to cover a wider span of the near infrared. However, our attempts here have had limited success. Multiple closely associated spectral peaks do not produce a smooth spectral output as found in incandescent lights and sunlight, which is problematic in improving function and has yet to deliver. This possibly may be overcome using a greater number of spectral peaks with tighter spacing. But this raises a different series of problems regarding cost and increased energy consumption making this solution no better than retention of incandescent sources in terms of environmental sustainability.</p><p>Key to this issue is the question of how much infrared is needed to sustain improved function? Infrared has relatively few absorbers in the built environment and in current studies relatively little has to be added to the environment for effect. However, a viable option is to run an incandescent light at a lower temperature which results in both energy savings and increased life of the unit and also shifts the peak spectral output towards longer wavelengths.</p><p>If this is done with a halogen bulb, which is a type of incandescent tungsten bulb, the filament lasts for a longer period as evaporated tungsten is redeposited on the filament rather than blackening the bulb glass. Hence, using a halogen bulb at lower voltage is a realistic alternative in terms of health and energy consumption.</p></div></div>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Needless to say, Chenoweth’s research builds on the philosophies of many influential figures throughout history. The African-American abolitionist Sojourner Truth, the suffrage campaigner Susan B Anthony, the Indian independence activist Mahatma Gandhi and the US civil rights campaigner Martin Luther King have all convincingly argued for the power of peaceful protest.</p><p>Yet Chenoweth admits that when she first began her research in the mid-2000s, she was initially rather cynical of the idea that nonviolent actions could be more powerful than armed conflict in most situations. As a PhD student at the University of Colorado, she had spent years <a target="_blank" href="https://search.proquest.com/docview/304889579">studying the factors contributing to the rise of terrorism</a> when she was asked to attend an academic workshop organised by the International Center of Nonviolent Conflict (ICNC), a non-profit organisation based in Washington DC. The workshop presented many compelling examples of peaceful protests bringing about lasting political change – including, for instance, the People Power protests in the Philippines.</p><p>But Chenoweth was surprised to find that no-one had comprehensively compared the success rates of nonviolent versus violent protests; perhaps the case studies were simply chosen through some kind of confirmation bias. “I was really motivated by some scepticism that nonviolent resistance could be an effective method for achieving major transformations in society,” she says</p><p>Working with Maria Stephan, a researcher at the ICNC, Chenoweth performed an extensive review of the literature on civil resistance and social movements from 1900 to 2006 – a data set then corroborated with other experts in the field. They primarily considered attempts to bring about regime change. A movement was considered a success if it fully achieved its goals both within a year of its peak engagement and as a direct result of its activities. A regime change resulting from foreign military intervention would not be considered a success, for instance. A campaign was considered violent, meanwhile, if it involved bombings, kidnappings, the destruction of infrastructure – or any other physical harm to people or property.</p><p>“We were trying to apply a pretty hard test to nonviolent resistance as a strategy,” Chenoweth says. (The criteria were so strict that India’s independence movement was not considered as evidence in favour of nonviolent protest in Chenoweth and Stephan’s analysis – since Britain’s dwindling military resources were considered to have been a deciding factor, even if the protests themselves were also a huge influence.)</p></div></div>]]></description>

    <p>I've been visiting the US a lot these days: for work, for conferences, and simply to see friends. Commensurately, I've been also thinking more about what Canadian culture is, and what being Canadian means to me.</p>
<p>My gratitude towards my nation goes deep. Canada shaped me into person I am today, and I'd go far as to say that Canada raised me; not as much as my mother did, but perhaps more than any other entity. Growing up, our family was poor to the point where there were stretches of weeks where all we ate were frozen dumplings for lunch and cabbage and rice for dinner. But mom did her best to hide our lack from me, and Canada helped her greatly with the conspiracy. Canada gave us a rent-subsidized apartment and five hundred dollars a month to care for me until I turned eighteen. And that would be cause enough for gratitude, but Canada went further in its generosity.</p>
<p>Canada taught me how to swim, and how to skate. Here, municipally-run community centres with ice rinks, pools, and programming rooms are standard civic infrastructure, and our neighbourhoods are dotted with them.<sup id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1">1</a></sup> The municipality runs regular classes and programming in the community centres, generally priced at a few hundred dollars for ten-week classes, but low-income families could register their children for a song. Mom ponied up for skates and bathing suits, and I swam in the summers and skated in the winters my entire childhood.</p>
<p>And so when in my teens when my friends started to invite me over to their families' summer cottages, I could join them in jumping into lakes with glee. And so when an airbnb my university friends booked over the holidays one year turned out to be unexpectedly close to an outdoor rink, I was able to play in a terribly silly game of pick-up hockey. And so even though my body is clumsy and stupid by nature, there were kinds of physical activity that I had cultivated a decade of muscle memory in, and can make pleasing amounts of improvement on in adulthood.</p>
<p>Canada let me read to my heart's content. I'll never forget the wonder and gratitude I felt, the very first time my parents took me to a public Canadian library. Looking around at the shelves, knowing that somehow every book inside was free for me to read and to take home. We didn't have anything like that in China.</p>
<p>With my children's library card I could take out forty books at a time. Forty books! We would make the trip at least once a week, where I would return my previous pile and get a new one — as much as can fit in my backpack, and two of mom's grocery totes. And I spent entire summers among the stacks, because the library had air conditioning and our apartment did not. I gobbled up one book after another in my formative years, which I was only able to do with Canada's generosity.</p>
<p>Canada made the holidays magical for me. Mom could not afford much in the way of frivolous things, but I would have a giant bounty of new toys every Christmas anyways courtesy of a local charity. They gave them out in jumbo translucent garbage bags, pink for girls and blue for boys, big enough for me to fit in. I would get sketchbooks and markers and colour pencils, stuffed toys, play-doh, puzzle books, and countless other things. I liked the art supplies best, but I wasn't picky. (From the same charities we would also get two turkeys a year, one for Thanksgiving and one for Christmas, though mom never quite managed to figure out how one was supposed to cook them.)</p>
<p>At the end of every school year, Canada would slip a bunch of goodies into the same envelope that my report card came in — free tickets to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_National_Exhibition">CNE</a> and to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontario_Science_Centre">science centre</a><sup id="fnref-2"><a href="#fn-2">2</a></sup>, and a booklet of deeply discounted tickets to other attractions near and far. And so my childhood was also filled with botanical gardens, and the giraffes at the zoo, and even the occasional Blue Jays game. And Canada ensured that memberships to the science centre were not too expensive, so mom was able to splurge on an annual family pass when it became clear how much I adored it, and we would go every rainy weekend until I knew all the exhibits by heart.<sup id="fnref-3"><a href="#fn-3">3</a></sup></p>
<p>Canada continues to provide for me in adulthood. I applied for EI when I graduated into the pandemic and appreciated the breathing room that gave me, I'm grateful for my Canadian passport every time I breeze into the US for a visit. I know my mother will be cared for in her golden years, and I won't ever have to worry about her medical bills. Being Canadian gives me <a href="https://thezvi.wordpress.com/2017/09/30/slack/">slack</a>, enough for me to do meaningful work without having to worry about being underpaid.</p>
<p>There are many things wrong with Canada. It has a <a href="https://members.viatec.ca/news/Details/shopify-ceo-says-canada-must-overcome-go-for-bronze-culture-at-betakit-town-hall-212738">go for bronze</a> mentality, the smartest of us keep going to the US because there is not enough opportunity here, much of its public infrastructure is crumbling and the housing prices are frightful. The nation is very obviously sick.</p>
<p>But in the US, when I step outside the walled gardens of my community, I notice the brittleness underneath the shining streets, the way the wealth is not load-bearing. I notice the medical self-serve kiosks in grocery stores, the necessities behind locked shelves at CVS. Parents there are not given five hundred dollars a month to buy infant formula for their babies, even with a GDP per capita twice ours. To the extent that feeding our infants preclude Canada from investing more in The Next Big Technology, the regret I can muster up about it is half-hearted at best.</p>
<p>When I think about the counterfactual me that grew up in a large American city, New York or L.A. instead of Toronto, I see someone who's more stunted than me, in important ways. No skating classes, libraries too far to walk to on a regular basis and more poorly stocked. Student debt. Without generous public incentives, that version of me would only have the life that her own parents can afford to provide for her.</p>
<p>I see someone who is a little more mercenary about money, and somehow even more disembodied than I am. (Would she ever feel at home in her body enough to dance, just for the fun of it?) I see someone less optimistic about the capacity for large institutions and government to do good.</p>
<p>I'm glad that I grew up in Canada. And I want to stay here, and do my part in helping it recover from its sickness. And yes, some of this is because I feel some amount of obligation towards it. I feel deep gratitude towards every single Canadian who paid their taxes gladly to ensure that not only did I have enough to eat and a warm place to sleep, I would also have opportunities to be delighted by giraffes and taught how to swim. It wouldn't feel right to leave.</p>
<p>But if I just say that, I don't think you'd get the right impression. The truth is, I love my country so much. I want to stay because it is my home, and it is a home with good bones and a solid foundation. I want to stay because I think it is good to live in a place that loves its children that much, the way I felt loved by it. I want my taxes to go to a place where the social safety net is generous and the people are easygoing and public skating rinks are treated like a human right.</p>
<p>I want Canada to have a future, this wonderful nation that makes light of its harsh climate. If you are fortunate, you might not realize how much Canada cares for those who are not. And it feels like a terrible waste, to give up on it and count it out of the game. In any case, I love it too much to leave.</p>

<p>The OnePlus ColorOS 16.0.3.501 Anti-Rollback Fuse Incident refers to the January 2026 deployment of firmware updates by <a href="https://consumerrights.wiki/w/OnePlus" title="OnePlus">OnePlus</a> that introduced a hardware-level anti-rollback mechanism. This permanently preventing users from downgrading their devices or installing custom ROMs. The updates, which affected the OnePlus 13, OnePlus 15, &amp; OnePlus Ace 5 series, blow irreversible electronic fuses in the device's <a href="https://consumerrights.wiki/w/Qualcomm" title="Qualcomm">Qualcomm</a> processor. Any subsequent attempt to install older firmware results in a permanent "hard brick" - the device becomes unusable. This cannot be repaired through standard methods.<sup id="cite_ref-xda-warning_1-0"><a href="#cite_note-xda-warning-1"><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup>
</p><p>OnePlus has not issued any official statement addressing the mechanism.
</p>
<meta property="mw:PageProp/toc">

<p>OnePlus was founded on December 16, 2013, by Pete Lau and Carl Pei, both former OPPO executives, with OPPO Electronics as the primary investor.<sup id="cite_ref-wikipedia-oneplus_3-0"><a href="#cite_note-wikipedia-oneplus-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup> The company's first device, the OnePlus One, shipped with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CyanogenMod" title="wikipedia:CyanogenMod">CyanogenMod</a>, a commercial variant of the popular custom ROM, through an exclusive licensing agreement with Cyanogen Inc.<sup id="cite_ref-wikipedia-oneplus-one_4-0"><a href="#cite_note-wikipedia-oneplus-one-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup> This partnership positioned OnePlus as a choice for modding enthusiasts.
</p><p>When that partnership collapsed due to Cyanogen's exclusivity deal with Micromax in India, OnePlus developed OxygenOS for global markets and HydrogenOS for China.<sup id="cite_ref-wikipedia-oneplus_3-1"><a href="#cite_note-wikipedia-oneplus-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup>
</p><p>In July 2021, OnePlus merged OxygenOS with OPPO's ColorOS, sharing a common codebase while maintaining separate branding for different regions.<sup id="cite_ref-wikipedia-oneplus_3-2"><a href="#cite_note-wikipedia-oneplus-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup>
</p>

<p>On January 18, 2026, users who updated to ColorOS 16.0.3.501 began reporting that their devices could not be reverted to previous versions. One OnePlus 13 owner reported that after flashing ColorOS 15, the phone entered EDL mode and was detected as "Qualcomm HS-USB QDLoader 9008," with the Chimera Rescue Tool unable to find a working programmer.<sup id="cite_ref-hard-brick-report_5-0"><a href="#cite_note-hard-brick-report-5"><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup>
</p><p>On January 19, 2026, XDA Forums member AdaUnlocked posted a warning thread documenting the issue with evidence including chat logs showing that the CPU anti-rollback fuse had been blown, warnings from paid unbrick services stating that Snapdragon 8 Elite devices updated to the affected build should not be downgraded, &amp; user reports confirming that motherboard replacement was required after failed downgrade attempts.<sup id="cite_ref-xda-warning_1-1"><a href="#cite_note-xda-warning-1"><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup>
</p><p>DroidWin confirmed that OnePlus had removed the download links for the OnePlus 13 downgrade firmware for all regions and that OnePlus 12 downgrade packages had been removed as well.<sup id="cite_ref-droidwin_6-0"><a href="#cite_note-droidwin-6"><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup>
</p><p>On 24 January 2026, AdaUnlocked updated the XDA thread stating that OnePlus have been retroactively replacing old ROMs with "Repacked versions" that have the same version number but with the ARB fuse trigger.
</p>

<p>The following devices and firmware versions have been confirmed to trigger the anti-rollback fuse:
</p>
<ul><li>OnePlus 12: ColorOS 16.0.3.500 &amp; 15.0.0.862</li>
<li>OnePlus 13 / 13T: ColorOS 16.0.3.501 &amp; 15.0.0.862</li>
<li>OnePlus 15: ColorOS 16.0.3.503</li>
<li>OnePlus Ace 5 / Ace 5 Pro: ColorOS 16.0.3.500 &amp; 15.0.0.862</li>
<li>OPPO Find X7 Ultra<b>:</b> ColorOS 16.0.3.500</li>
<li>OPPO Pad 4 Pro<b>:</b> ColorOS 16.0.3.501</li>
<li>OnePlus Pad 2 Pro (CN) / OnePlus Pad 3 (Global): ColorOS 16.0.3.501<sup id="cite_ref-xda-warning_1-2"><a href="#cite_note-xda-warning-1"><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup></li></ul>
<p>Android Authority reported that the OPPO Find X8 series is considered at high risk, while the OnePlus 11 and OnePlus 12 could be next in line to receive similar updates.<sup id="cite_ref-android-authority_2-1"><a href="#cite_note-android-authority-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup>
</p><p>Devices running firmware version 16.0.2.402 or lower remain unaffected. The XDA thread advises users to avoid any OTA update ending in .500, .501, or .503 until community verification confirms safety.<sup id="cite_ref-xda-warning_1-3"><a href="#cite_note-xda-warning-1"><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup>
</p>

<p>The anti-rollback mechanism uses Qfprom (Qualcomm Fuse Programmable Read-Only Memory), a region on Qualcomm processors containing one-time programmable electronic fuses. These microscopic components are physically altered when "blown"; a controlled voltage pulse permanently changes the fuse's state from "0" to "1." This change cannot be reversed by any software means.<sup id="cite_ref-xda-warning_1-4"><a href="#cite_note-xda-warning-1"><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup> A complete motherboard replacement is the only possible method to remedy it.
</p><p>DroidWin explained that the implementation works similarly to how Knox gets tripped on Samsung devices upon unlocking the bootloader: both are e-fuses embedded in the motherboard that become permanently fused upon triggering. Changing the motherboard is the only way to restore the default state.<sup id="cite_ref-droidwin_6-1"><a href="#cite_note-droidwin-6"><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup>
</p><p>When the device powers on, the Primary Boot Loader in the processor's ROM loads and verifies the eXtensible Boot Loader (XBL). XBL reads the current anti-rollback version from the Qfprom fuses and compares it against the firmware's embedded version number. If the firmware version is lower than the fuse value, boot is rejected. When newer firmware successfully boots, the bootloader issues commands through Qualcomm's TrustZone to blow additional fuses, permanently recording the new minimum version.<sup id="cite_ref-xda-warning_1-5"><a href="#cite_note-xda-warning-1"><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup>
</p><p>EDL (Emergency Download Mode), historically the last-resort recovery option using USB interface 9008, cannot bypass this protection. While EDL operates from the Primary Boot Loader ROM and allows direct storage writes, the eFuses remain in the processor silicon. EDL's Firehose programmers must be OEM-signed and contain their own anti-rollback versions; previously functional unbrick tools now fail because the fuse has been blown.<sup id="cite_ref-xda-warning_1-6"><a href="#cite_note-xda-warning-1"><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup>
</p><p>As explained on the XDA thread: "When we say 'Fuse Blown,' we are referring to Qfprom eFuses (Electronic Fuses) inside the Snapdragon chipset. It is not a physical fuse like in a household plug, so there is no smoke, no burning smell, and no heat. It is a microscopic logic gate that is electrically switched from '0' to '1'. Once it is switched, it effectively 'burns the bridge' to allow older software to run."<sup id="cite_ref-xda-warning_1-7"><a href="#cite_note-xda-warning-1"><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup>
</p>
<p>
The XDA warning describes the situation as dangerous for custom ROM users: </p><blockquote><p><i>"Flashing ANY custom ROM developed prior to this update on top of ColorOS 16.0.3.501 (or newer) will result in an immediate HARD BRICK."<sup id="cite_ref-xda-warning_1-8"><a href="#cite_note-xda-warning-1"><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup></i></p></blockquote><p>Custom ROMs package firmware components from the stock firmware they were built against. If a user's device has been updated to a fused firmware version &amp; they flash a custom ROM built against older firmware, the anti-rollback mechanism triggers immediately. The XDA thread states:</p><blockquote><p><i>"Almost ALL current Custom ROMs for OnePlus 13 / Ace 5 were built BEFORE this fuse policy was known. They are adapted for the 'Old' (Unfused) firmware environment."<sup id="cite_ref-xda-warning_1-9"><a href="#cite_note-xda-warning-1"><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup></i></p></blockquote><p>AdaUnlocked characterized the impact on the development community as severe, noting that work on Custom ROMs, Ports, and GSIs would be rendered useless for fused devices.<sup id="cite_ref-xda-warning_1-10"><a href="#cite_note-xda-warning-1"><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup>
</p><p>The community recommendation is that users who have updated should not flash any custom ROM until developers explicitly announce support for fused devices with the new firmware base.<sup id="cite_ref-xda-warning_1-11"><a href="#cite_note-xda-warning-1"><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup>
</p>

<p>As of 22 January, 2026, OnePlus and OPPO have issued no official statement addressing the anti-rollback fuse mechanism. No press releases, community forum responses, or social media acknowledgments explain the policy or respond to reports of bricked devices.<sup id="cite_ref-android-authority_2-2"><a href="#cite_note-android-authority-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup>
</p><p>The removal of official downgrade packages from OnePlus' community forums on 19 January, 2026, was interpreted by users as confirmation that the mechanism was intentional.<sup id="cite_ref-droidwin_6-2"><a href="#cite_note-droidwin-6"><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup>
</p>

<p>Anti-rollback protection exists across the smartphone industry, but implementations vary in their impact on users.
</p><p><a href="https://consumerrights.wiki/index.php?title=Samsung_Knox&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Samsung Knox (page does not exist)">Samsung Knox</a> implements fuse-based security that trips permanently when non-OEM firmware is flashed, disabling Samsung Pay and Secure Folder. However, Android Authority noted that Samsung's implementation is not as stringent as OnePlus's; Samsung blocks the bootloader-unlocking process but usually does not hard-brick the phone if users attempt unauthorized modifications.<sup id="cite_ref-android-authority_2-3"><a href="#cite_note-android-authority-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup>
</p><p>
DroidWin noted the irony of OnePlus's approach: </p><blockquote><p><i>"EDL flashing is hardly used by 1-2% of its userbase, so rolling out a change to stop those niche segments of users from carrying out their tweaks, which would end up impacting the majority of its users, doesn't really add up."<sup id="cite_ref-droidwin_6-3"><a href="#cite_note-droidwin-6"><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup></i></p></blockquote>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-event-module="article body" data-flatplan-body="true"><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true" data-flatplan-dropcap="true">U<span>ntil recently</span>, I resisted using the F-word to describe President Trump. For one thing, there were too many elements of classical fascism that didn’t seem to fit. For another, the term has been overused to the point of meaninglessness, especially by left-leaning types who call you a fascist if you oppose abortion or affirmative action. For yet another, the term is hazily defined, even by its adherents. From the beginning, fascism has been an incoherent doctrine, and even today scholars can’t agree on its <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://scholarworks.lib.csusb.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1160&amp;context=history-in-the-making">definition</a>. Italy’s original version differed from Germany’s, which differed from Spain’s, which differed from Japan’s.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">I accepted President Biden’s characterization of the MAGA movement as “<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DumazY3IEHE">semi-fascist</a>” because some parallels were glaringly apparent. Trump was definitely an authoritarian, and unquestionably a <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2025/02/corruption-trump-administration/681794/">patrimonialist</a>. Beyond that, though, the best description seemed to be a psychological one <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.thebulwark.com/p/trumps-stunning-ignorance-with-john">propounded by John Bolton</a>, Trump’s first-term national security adviser: “He listens to Putin, he listens to Xi, he listens to how they talk about governing unburdened by uncooperative legislatures, unconcerned with what the judiciary may do, and he thinks to himself, <i>Why can’t I do that?</i> This doesn’t amount to being a fascist, in my view, [or] having a theory of how you want to govern. It’s just <i>Why can’t I have the same fun they have?</i>”</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Writing a <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2025/02/corruption-trump-administration/681794/">year ago</a>, I argued that Trump’s governing regime is a version of patrimonialism, in which the state is treated as the personal property and family business of the leader. That is still true. But, as I also noted then, patrimonialism is a <i>style</i> of governing, not a formal ideology or system. It can be layered atop all kinds of organizational structures, including not just national governments but also urban political machines such as Tammany Hall, criminal gangs such as the Mafia, and even religious cults. Because its only firm principle is personal loyalty to the boss, it has no specific agenda. Fascism, in contrast, is ideological, aggressive, and, at least in its early stages, revolutionary. It seeks to dominate politics, to crush resistance, and to rewrite the social contract.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Over Trump’s past year, what originally looked like an effort to make the government his personal plaything has drifted distinctly toward doctrinal and operational fascism. Trump’s appetite for lebensraum, his claim of unlimited power, his support for the global far right, his politicization of the justice system, his deployment of performative brutality, his ostentatious violation of rights, his creation of a national paramilitary police—all of those developments bespeak something more purposeful and sinister than run-of-the-mill greed or gangsterism.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true" data-flatplan-dropcap="true">W<span>hen the facts change</span>, I change my mind. Recent events have brought Trump’s governing style into sharper focus. <i>Fascist</i> best describes it, and reluctance to use the term has now become perverse. That is not because of any one or two things he and his administration have done but because of the totality. Fascism is not a territory with clearly marked boundaries but a constellation of characteristics. When you view the stars together, the constellation plainly appears.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true"><i>Demolition of norms</i>. From the beginning of his first presidential run in 2015, Trump deliberately crashed through every boundary of civility; he <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.politico.com/story/2016/10/trump-tweet-attack-john-mccain-229612">mocked Senator John McCain’s war heroism</a>, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2015/09/10/trump-fiorina-look-face/71992454/">mocked fellow candidate Carly Fiorina’s face</a>, seemingly <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.cnn.com/2015/08/08/politics/donald-trump-cnn-megyn-kelly-comment">mocked</a> the Fox News host Megan Kelly’s menstruation, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-us-canada-37230916">slurred immigrants</a>, and much more. Today he still does it, recently making an <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/mUt5IeGco5s">obscene gesture</a> to a factory worker and calling a journalist “<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZUO0-y_OJzA">piggy</a>.” This is a feature of the fascist governing style, not a bug. Fascists know that what the American Founders called the “republican virtues” impede their political agenda, and so they gleefully trash liberal pieties such as reason and reasonableness, civility and civic spirit, toleration and forbearance. By mocking decency and saying the unsayable, they open the way for what William Galston <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://yalebooks.yale.edu/book/9780300282290/anger-fear-domination/">has called</a> the “dark passions” of fear, resentment, and especially domination—the kind of politics that shifts the public discourse to ground on which liberals cannot compete.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true"><i>Glorification of violence</i>. Every state uses violence to enforce its laws, but liberal states use it reluctantly, whereas fascism <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://historyoftotalitarianism.com/mussolini-and-his-thugs/">embraces and flaunts it</a>. Trump thus <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckgnxej1dn0o">praises a violent mob</a>; <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/what-does-it-mean-when-president-praises-torture-n712736">endorses torture</a>; <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2024/10/trump-violent-rhetoric-timeline/680403/">muses</a> fondly about punching, body-slamming, and shooting protesters and journalists; and reportedly suggests shooting <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.npr.org/2022/05/09/1097517470/trump-esper-book-defense-secretary">protesters</a> and <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-49901878">migrants</a>. His <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/10/politics/ice-videos-dhs-noem-immigration-arrests-analysis">recruitment ads for ICE</a> glamorize military-style raids of homes and neighborhoods; his propaganda <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/pete-hegseth-franklin-meme-drug-boats-b2875907.html">takes childish delight</a> in the killing of civilians; and we have all seen videos of agents dragging people <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/ice-woman-car-minneapolis-9.7045672">out of cars</a> and <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1E21VVPYlM">homes</a>—partly because the government <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2026/01/19/ice-immigration-enforcement-minneapolis-protests/">films them</a>. Like the demolition of civic decency, the valorization of violence is not incidental to fascism; it is part and parcel.</p><p id="injected-recirculation-link-0" data-view-action="view link - injected link - item 1" data-event-element="injected link" data-event-position="1"><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/2026/01/maxwell-frost-assault/685750/">Read: ‘It’s a really scary time’</a></p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true"><i>Might is right</i>. Also characteristic of fascism is what George Orwell called “<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.lehman.edu/faculty/rcarey/BRSQ/06may.orwell.htm">bully-worship</a>”: the principle that, as Thucydides famously <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.google.com/books/edition/History_of_the_Peloponnesian_War_Done_In/_XwJAQAAIAAJ?hl=en&amp;gbpv=1&amp;dq=the+strong+do+what+they+can+and+the+weak+suffer+what+they+must&amp;pg=PA394&amp;printsec=frontcover">put it</a>, “the strong do what they can and the weak suffer what they must.” This view came across in Trump’s notorious <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7pxbGjvcdyY">Oval Office meeting</a> with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, in which Trump showed open contempt for what he regarded as Ukraine’s weakness; it came across explicitly, and chillingly, when Stephen Miller, the president’s most powerful aide, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.cnn.com/2026/01/05/politics/video/senior-white-house-aide-stephen-miller-says-us-military-threat-to-maintain-control-of-venezuela-digvid">told CNN’s Jack Tapper</a>: “We live in a world, in the real world, that is governed by strength, that is governed by force, that is governed by power. These are the iron laws of the world that have existed since the beginning of time.” Those words, though alien to the traditions of American and Christian morality, could have come from the lips of any fascist dictator.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true"><i>Politicized law enforcement</i>. Liberals follow the law whether they like it or not; fascists, only when they like it. Nazism featured a “<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2025/05/trump-executive-order-lawlessness-constitutional-crisis/682112/">dual state</a>,” where, at any moment, the protections of ordinary law could cease to apply. Trump makes no secret of despising due process of law; he has demanded countless times that his opponents be <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/Z36Lqx-weFk">jailed</a> (“Lock her up!” chants, with <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/06/02/politics/fact-check-trump-false-claim-lock-up-hillary-clinton">his endorsement</a>, were a prominent feature of his 2016 campaign), and he has suggested the Constitution’s “<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://archive.ph/u0vZk">termination</a>” and said “<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-administration/trump-asked-uphold-constitution-says-dont-know-rcna204580">I don’t know</a>” when asked if he is required to uphold it. His single most dangerous second-term innovation is the repurposing of federal law enforcement to persecute his enemies (and shield <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/doj-ended-probe-border-czar-tom-homan-allegedly/story?id=125781386">his friends</a>). No prior president has produced anything like Trump’s <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/04/09/donald-trump-retribution-miles-taylor-00007512">direct and public order</a> for the Justice Department to investigate two former officials, or like his <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/10/10/trump-doj-prosecutions-comey-james-00601838">blatantly retaliatory prosecutions</a> of James Comey and Letitia James. “At least 470 people, organizations and institutions have been targeted for retribution since Trump took office—an average of more than one a day,” <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-trump-retribution-tracker/">Reuters reported</a> in November (and today one can add others to the list, beginning with Federal Reserve Chair <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://protectdemocracy.org/work/retaliatory-action-tracker/">Jerome Powell</a>). Had Trump done nothing else, his <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.thejusticeconnection.org/doj-tracker/">demolition</a> of independent and apolitical law enforcement would still have moved the U.S. government closer than ever before to a fascistic model.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true"><i>Dehumanization</i>. Fascism draws its legitimacy from its claims of defending the people from enemies who are animals, criminals, brutes. Trump characterizes (for instance) political opponents as “<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.npr.org/2023/11/17/1213746885/trump-vermin-hitler-immigration-authoritarian-republican-primary">vermin</a>” and immigrants as “<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-describes-somali-immigrants-garbage-amid-feud-minnesota/story?id=128069199">garbage</a>” who are “<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/dec/16/trump-immigrants-new-hampshire-rally">poisoning the blood of our country</a>” (language straight out of the Third Reich). Vice President Vance, as a senator, endorsed a book called <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://buildersmovement.org/2024/08/14/vance-endorses-book-dehumanizing-unhumans-language/"><i>Unhumans</i></a> (a title that refers to the left). And who can forget his false claim that Haitians abduct and eat pet cats and dogs?</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true"><i>Police-state tactics</i>. Trump has turned ICE into a sprawling paramilitary that roves the country at will, searches and detains noncitizens and <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/us-citizen-ice-removed-minnesota-home-underwear-after-129372047">citizens</a> without warrants, uses force ostentatiously, operates behind masks, receives <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/2026/01/ice-new-hires-training-minneapolis-shooting/685745/">skimpy training</a>, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.axios.com/local/chicago/2025/12/08/dhs-claims-contradicted-video-court">lies</a> about its activities, and has been told that it enjoys “<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.cnn.com/2026/01/08/politics/ice-immunity-jd-vance-minneapolis">absolute immunity</a>.” He more than <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.govexec.com/workforce/2026/01/ice-more-doubled-its-workforce-2025/410461/">doubled the agency’s size</a> in 2025, and its budget is now larger than those of all other federal law-enforcement agencies <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2025/jul/11/jon-favreau/ICE-FBI-bill-Donald-Trump-largest/">combined</a>, and larger than the entire military budgets of all but <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.newsweek.com/immigration-ice-bill-trump-2093456">15 countries</a>. “This is going to affect every community, every city,” the Cato Institute scholar <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xf9TPSTiPPw">David Bier recently observed.</a> “Really almost everyone in our country is going to come in contact with this, one way or the other.” In Minneapolis and elsewhere, the agency has behaved provocatively, sometimes <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.scrippsnews.com/politics/immigration/organized-brutality-minnesota-gov-tim-walz-condemns-ices-immigration-crackdown">brutally</a>, and arguably <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.propublica.org/article/immigration-dhs-american-citizens-arrested-detained-against-will">illegally</a>—behaviors that Trump and his staff have encouraged, shielded, and <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/interactive/2025/ice-social-media-blitz/">sent camera crews to publicize</a>, perhaps in the hope of eliciting violent resistance that would justify further crackdowns, a standard fascist stratagem. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem’s recent appearance with a <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.snopes.com/news/2026/01/14/one-of-ours-all-of-yours-noem-podium/">sign</a> reading <span>One of ours, all of yours</span> seemed to nod toward another fascist standby, collective punishment—as did the administration’s decision to flood Minneapolis with thousands of officers after residents there began protesting federal tactics, a prioritization that was <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.minnpost.com/glean/2026/01/trump-promises-day-of-reckoning-and-retribution-to-minnesota-democrats-ice-lawsuit-somali-tps/">explicitly retributive</a>.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true"><i>Undermining elections</i>. Trump’s recent musing that there should be no 2026 election may or may not have been <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/alisondurkee/2026/01/15/trump-suggests-us-shouldnt-even-have-november-midterms/">jocular</a> (as the White House has maintained), but he and his MAGA supporters believe they never lose an election, period. They went to great lengths to overturn the 2020 election, as the prosecutor Jack Smith’s <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.justice.gov/storage/US_v_Trump_23_cr_257.pdf">indictment</a> of Trump and subsequent <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://electionlawblog.org/wp-content/uploads/report-of-special-counsel-smith-volume-1-january-2025.pdf">report</a> detail ad nauseam. Rigging, stealing, or outright canceling elections is, of course, job one for fascists. Although Trump is term-limited, we must not expect that he and his MAGA loyalists will voluntarily turn over the White House to a Democrat in 2029, regardless of what the voters say—and the second insurrection will be far better organized than the first.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true"><i>What’s private is public</i>. Classical fascism rejects the fundamental liberal distinction between the government and the private sector, per Mussolini’s <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://sjsu.edu/faculty/wooda/2B-HUM/Readings/The-Doctrine-of-Fascism.pdf">dictum</a>: “No individuals or groups outside the State.” Among Trump’s most audacious (if only intermittently successful) initiatives are his efforts to commandeer private entities, including <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.lawfaremedia.org/article/the-law-firms--deals-with-trump-are-even-riskier-than-they-seem">law firms</a>, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.politico.com/news/2026/01/04/trump-upended-the-us-education-system-in-2025-its-only-the-beginning-00693857?fbclid=IwZXh0bgNhZW0CMTEAc3J0YwZhcHBfaWQKNjYyODU2ODM3OQABHvHc6vF057rLHe7YD2GdFTrIm_3DZWr7ooW_NGa2LQHbKseDeUEDgCtGrJqe_aem_M1RpaU71auaYV2P8wosz7w">universities</a>, and <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/11/24/trump-us-steel-nippon-golden-share.html">corporations</a>. One of his first acts as president last year was to brazenly defy a newly enacted law by taking the ownership of TikTok into <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://bhr.stern.nyu.edu/quick-take/trump-is-defying-the-law-to-keep-tiktok-alive/">his own hands</a>. Bolton understood this mentality when he said, “He can’t tell the difference between his own personal interest and the national interest, if he even understands what the national interest is.”</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true"><i>Attacks on news media</i>. Shortly after taking office in 2017, Trump denounced the news media as “<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/17/business/trump-calls-the-news-media-the-enemy-of-the-people.html">the enemy of the American people</a>,” a phrase familiar from dictatorships abroad. His hostility <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.hks.harvard.edu/publications/enemy-people-trumps-war-press-new-mccarthyism-and-threat-american-democracy">never relented</a>, but in his second term, it has reached new heights. Trump has threatened <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/09/18/trump-floats-stripping-networks-critical-of-him-of-their-broadcast-licenses-00571953">broadcast licenses</a>, abused his <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/09/27/brendan-carr-kimmel-fcc-00583301">regulatory authority</a>, manipulated <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/08/business/media/trump-netflix-paramount-deal.html">ownership deals</a>, filed <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://theconversation.com/trump-lawsuits-seek-to-muzzle-media-posing-serious-threat-to-free-press-272850">exorbitant lawsuits</a>, played favorites with <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://apnews.com/article/pentagon-press-access-hegseth-trump-restrictions-5d9c2a63e4e03b91fc1546bb09ffbf12">journalistic access</a>, searched a <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2026/01/14/washington-post-reporter-search/">reporter’s home</a>, and vilified <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://rsf.org/en/usa-trump-verbally-attacked-media-more-100-times-run-election">news outlets and journalists</a>. Although Trump cannot dominate news media in the United States in the way that Prime Minister Viktor Orbán has done <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://rsf.org/en/country/hungary">in Hungary</a>, he is running the Orbán playbook. No other president, not even Richard Nixon (no friend of the media), has used such blatantly illiberal tactics against the press.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true"><i>Territorial and military aggression</i>. One reason I held out against identifying Trumpism with fascism in his first term was Trump’s apparent lack of interest in aggression against other states; if anything, he had seemed shy about using force abroad. Well, that was then. In his second term, he has used military force <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/white-house/4399869/trump-bombed-as-many-countries-2025-as-entire-first-term/">promiscuously</a>. Of course, many presidents have deployed force, but Trump’s explicitly predatory use of it to <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/20/world/venezuela-oil-trump-greenland-davos.html">grab Venezuela’s oil</a> and his gangster-style threat to take Greenland from Denmark <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.cnn.com/2026/01/10/politics/us-will-take-greenland-the-hard-way-if-it-cant-do-it-the-easy-way-trump-says">“the easy way” or “the hard way</a>” were 1930s-style authoritarian moves. The same goes for his contempt for international law, binding alliances, and transnational organizations such as the European Union—all of which impede the state’s unconstrained exercise of its will, a central fascist tenet.

Like <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Autocracy-Inc-Dictators-Want-World/dp/0385549938">authoritarians generally</a>, fascists love company; the world is safer for them if there are more of them. In his second term, Trump has broken with long-standing U.S. policy by <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.npr.org/2025/04/18/nx-s1-5357511/state-department-human-rights-report-cuts">dialing back</a> support for human rights while praising and supporting authoritarian populists and illiberal nationalists in <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.reuters.com/world/donald-trump-jr-visits-serbia-meets-president-aleksandar-vucic-2025-03-11/">Serbia</a>, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/06/01/polish-election-nationalist-right/">Poland</a>, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.reuters.com/world/trump-wishes-best-luck-hungarys-orban-election-campaign-2026-01-09/">Hungary</a>, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/14/jd-vance-alice-weidel-meeting-germany-far-right">Germany</a>, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.americanprogress.org/article/a-green-light-for-authoritarianism-how-the-trump-administration-fuels-global-autocracy/">Turkey</a>, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://english.elpais.com/international/2025-08-07/trump-administration-backs-bukeles-indefinite-reelection-we-reject-comparisons-with-dictatorial-regimes.html">El Salvador</a>, and <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.politico.eu/article/us-donald-trump-invite-populist-slovak-leader-fico-fifa-world-cup-letter/">Slovakia</a>, among other places—and by being <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdSaLbOJwTo">weirdly deferential</a> to the strongman Russian President Vladimir Putin. Even more striking is his de facto alignment against America’s liberal allies and their parties in Europe, which he holds in <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/12/09/trump-dasha-burns-interview-europe-immigration-ukraine-00682016">contempt</a>.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true"><i>Blood-and-soil nationalism</i>. A fascist trademark is its insistence that the country is not just a collection of individuals but a people, a <i>Volk</i>: a mystically defined and ethnically pure group bound together by shared blood, culture, and destiny. In keeping with that idea, Trump has <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/protecting-the-meaning-and-value-of-american-citizenship/">repudiated birthright citizenship</a>, and Vance has <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://singjupost.com/transcript-jd-vances-speech-at-the-claremont-institutes-statesmanship-award-event/">called to</a> “redefine the meaning of American citizenship in the 21st century” so that priority goes to Americans with longer historical ties: “the people whose ancestors fought in the Civil War,” as he put it, or people whom others on the MAGA right call “<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.persuasion.community/p/its-not-my-heritage-that-makes-me?utm_source=post-email-title&amp;publication_id=61579&amp;post_id=184794121&amp;utm_campaign=email-post-title&amp;isFreemail=false&amp;r=i5o9&amp;triedRedirect=true&amp;utm_medium=email">heritage Americans</a>.” In other words, some Americans are more volkish than others.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true"><i>White and Christian nationalism</i>. While Vance, Trump, and MAGA do not propound an explicit ideology of racial hierarchy, they make no secret of pining for a whiter, more Christian America. Trump has found many ways to communicate this: for example, by making clear his disdain for <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.factcheck.org/2025/12/trump-confirms-his-disparaging-remark-about-shithole-countries-at-immigration-meeting/">“shithole” countries</a> and his preference for white Christian immigrants; by pointedly accepting white South Africans as political <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://za.usembassy.gov/refugee-admissions-program-for-south-africans/">refugees</a> (while closing the door to most other asylum seekers); by <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.npr.org/2025/07/03/nx-s1-5454720/trumps-reversal-of-army-base-names-shines-light-on-militarys-segregationist-past">renaming military bases</a> to share the names of Confederate generals (after Congress ordered their names removed); by saying that civil-rights laws led to whites’ being “very badly treated.” In his National Security Strategy, he castigates Europe for allowing immigration to undermine “civilizational self-confidence” and proclaims, “We want Europe to remain European,” a rallying cry of white Christian nationalists across the continent. Taking his cue, the Department of Homeland Security has propagated unashamedly <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/trump-administration-posts-echo-rhetoric-linked-to-extremist-groups">white-nationalist</a> themes, and <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.anpr.org/release/2025/0923">national parks</a> and <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://apnews.com/article/slavery-exhibit-removed-philadelphia-trump-executive-order-dd764277133f47ec1173e8dc16703958">museums</a> have scrubbed their exhibits of references to slavery.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true"><i>Mobs and street thugs</i>. The use of militias and mobs to harass, rough up, and otherwise intimidate opponents is a standard fascist stratagem (the textbook example being Hitler’s Kristallnacht<i> </i>pogrom in 1938). As few will need reminding, the Trump-MAGA parallel is the mob and militia violence against the U.S. Capitol on January 6, 2021. Trump knowingly laid groundwork for this operation, calling on militia forces to “<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://apnews.com/article/election-2020-joe-biden-race-and-ethnicity-donald-trump-chris-wallace-0b32339da25fbc9e8b7c7c7066a1db0f">stand back and stand by</a>” in September 2020 and later dog-whistling “<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.npr.org/2022/07/13/1111341161/how-trumps-will-be-wild-tweet-drew-rioters-to-the-capitol-on-jan-6">Be there, will be wild!</a>” to his supporters. His pardon of all of the Capitol attackers—<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/05/us/politics/trump-jan-6-pardons-rioters.html">more than 1,500</a>, including the most violent—only proved what we knew, which is that they had his blessing. While Trump has found state violence adequate to his purposes so far in his second term, street violence is self-evidently in his repertoire.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true"><i>Leader aggrandizement</i>. Since 2016, when he declared that “<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.politico.com/video/2020/08/20/trump-at-2016-rnc-i-alone-can-fix-it-085403">I alone can fix it</a>” and bragged that his supporters would remain loyal if he shot someone <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/09/us/evangelicals-trump-christianity.html">on Fifth Avenue</a>, Trump has cultivated a personality cult. Although some of his efforts at self-aggrandizement can seem comical (the gilding of the Oval Office, the renaming of the Kennedy Center, the proposed triumphal arch), he understands the centrality of leader worship in a fascist-style regime. In sharp contradistinction to the American presidential tradition since George Washington, he makes no pretense of serving the people or the Constitution. His mindset, his symbolism, and his rhetoric all underscore the point he made to <i>The New York Times</i> <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/08/briefing/trump-interview-oval-office-apple-ceo.html">this month</a>: his own mind and morality are the only limits on his global power. This is Fascism 101.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true"><i>Alternative facts</i>. As <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://bookshop.org/p/books/1984-75th-anniversary-george-orwell/aef4adf3bb37311b?ean=9780451524935&amp;next=t">Orwell</a>, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://bookshop.org/p/books/the-origins-of-totalitarianism-with-a-new-introduction-by-anne-applebaum-anne-applebaum/a2326e15ca8f90fc?ean=9780063354487&amp;next=t">Hannah Arendt</a>, and practically every other scholar of authoritarianism have emphasized, creating a reality-distortion field is the first thing a fascistic government will do, the better to drive its own twisted narrative, confuse the citizenry, demoralize political opponents, and justify every manner of corruption and abuse. While other presidents (including some <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://theweek.com/articles/447245/today-history-president-lies">good ones</a>) have lied, none have come close to Trump’s deployment of Russian-style mass disinformation, as I detail in my book <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.brookings.edu/book/the-constitution-of-knowledge/"><i>The Constitution of Knowledge</i></a>. From the start of his first term, Trump has made “<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://edition.cnn.com/2017/01/22/politics/kellyanne-conway-alternative-facts">alternative facts</a>” a hallmark of his governing style, issuing lies, exaggerations, and half-truths at a rate of <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/how-fact-checker-tracked-trump-claims/2021/01/23/ad04b69a-5c1d-11eb-a976-bad6431e03e2_story.html">20 a day</a>. Predictably, his second term has brought <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/24/business/trump-misinformation-false-claims.html">more</a> of the <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/23/us/politics/trump-alternative-reality.html?unlocked_article_code=1.zE4.dM37.lKwB_tcaCnbp">same</a>.

A distinctive mark of fascism is its conception of politics, best captured by <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/schmitt/">Carl Schmitt</a>, an early-20th-century German political theorist whose doctrines legitimized Nazism. Schmitt rejected the Madisonian view of politics as a social negotiation in which different factions, interests, and ideology come to agreement, the <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nationalaffairs.com/publications/detail/rescuing-compromise">core idea</a> of our Constitution. Rather, he saw politics as a state of war between enemies, neither of which can understand the other and both of which feel existentially threatened—and only one of which can win. The aim of Schmittian politics is not to share the country but to dominate or destroy the other side. This conception has been evident in MAGA politics since Michael Anton (now a Trump-administration official) published his <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://claremontreviewofbooks.com/digital/the-flight-93-election/">famous article</a> arguing that the 2016 election was a life-and-death battle to save the country from the left (a “Flight 93” election: “charge the cockpit or you die”). In the <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://halenallison.medium.com/a-storm-of-fire-and-brimstone-stephen-millers-charlie-kirk-memorial-speech-21-september-2025-77a39d16f0ac">speech</a> given by Stephen Miller at Charlie Kirk’s memorial service, MAGA’s embrace of Schmittian totalism found its apotheosis: “We are the storm. And our enemies cannot comprehend our strength, our determination, our resolve, our passion … You are nothing. You are wickedness.”</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true"><i>Governing as revolution</i>. Although born in revolution, the American liberal tradition, especially its conservative branch, prizes continuity, stability, and incremental change guided by reason. Fascism, by contrast, “is not reactionary but revolutionary,” as Mussolini <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://sjsu.edu/faculty/wooda/2B-HUM/Readings/The-Doctrine-of-Fascism.pdf">insisted</a>. It seeks to uproot and replace the old order and embraces bold, exhilarating action unshackled to rational deliberation. MAGA embraces its own revolutionary ethos, what Russell Vought, the administration’s Office of Management and Budget director and probably its most formidable intellect, has called “radical constitutionalism,” a doctrine that would <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.aei.org/op-eds/the-trump-executive-orders-as-radical-constitutionalism/">vitiate many checks on presidential power</a>. In pursuit of this vision, Vought told Tucker Carlson in a <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI">November 2024 interview</a>, “The president has to move executively as fast and as aggressively as possible, with a radical constitutional perspective, to be able to dismantle that [federal] bureaucracy and their power centers” because “the bureaucracies hate the American people.” He predicted, “If you have a radical constitutionalism, it’s going to be destabilizing … But it’s also exhilarating.” He <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.propublica.org/article/video-donald-trump-russ-vought-center-renewing-america-maga">said</a> he would put federal agencies “in trauma,” an idea echoed by Christopher Rufo, an architect of Trump’s attack on universities, which Rufo described as a “counterrevolution blueprint” to put universities “in an existential terror.” As Trump <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c307zq8ppj6o">shuttered</a> a congressionally mandated agency, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/trump-rename-gulf-mexico-gulf-america-1st-executive/story?id=117886074">renamed</a> an international body of water, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.aclum.org/press-releases/rumeysa-ozturk-denied-bond-remains-unlawfully-detained-louisiana/">arrested</a> an op-ed writer, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/15/world/americas/trump-migrants-deportations.html">deported</a> immigrants to a foreign gulag, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://open.substack.com/pub/theunpopulist/p/life-in-a-city-occupied-by-ice?r=i5o9">terrorized</a> American cities, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwyg1jg8xkmo">threatened</a> an ally, and more, he showed how it looks when a radicalized state abandons rational deliberation and goes to war against itself.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true" data-flatplan-dropcap="true">O<span>ne can object</span> that there are elements of classical European fascism that are not found in Trumpism (mass rallies and public rituals, for example)—or that there are additional elements of Trumpism that belong on the list (MAGA’s <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDC_bn68jYc">hypermasculinity</a>, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/trump-wants-more-support-from-women-but-hasnt-changed-how-he-talks-about-them">misogyny</a>, and <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/2026/01/maga-christians-betray-ethics-ice/685679/">co-option of Christianity</a> all resemble fascist patterns). The exercise of comparing fascism’s various forms is not precise. If historians object that Trump is not a copy of Mussolini or Hitler or Franco, the reply is yes—but so what? Trump is building something new on old principles. He is showing us in real time what 21st-century <i>American</i> fascism looks like.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">If, however, Trump is a fascist <i>president</i>, that does not mean that America is a fascist <i>country.</i> The courts, the states, and the media remain independent of him, and his efforts to browbeat them will likely fail.

He has not succeeded in molding public opinion, except <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/203198/presidential-approval-ratings-donald-trump.aspx">against himself</a>.

      <p>Note: this post has been revised to be split into two sections: a description of what happened, and my analysis. I hope to make it clear that, while I do not like ATProto in general, I am trying to make good-faith critcisms of specific design decisions and outcomes.</p>
<p>Today, I tried setting up an ATProto account for use with Bluesky, with did:web instead of did:plc. Let’s walk through the process:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Set up the PDS software on a server I control. Because I use NixOS, this was very easy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Create a did:web. This means creating a public-private keypair; I initially tried following <a href="https://blog.lapyst.dev/posts/14-how-to-create-a-completely-independent-bluesky-atproto-account">this tutorial</a> from Mai Lapyst, but it’s very out of date, and doesn’t include a critical step.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>With that did:web, upload the <code>did.json</code> document to my webserver and set the appropriate DNS entries. Easy enough, except that I also had to set the CORS header for the <code>did.json</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Create an account on my new PDS. I was able to get an invite and create an account, but it was in the “deactivated” status, and I couldn’t activate it. This had to be done by making requests manually with <code>curl</code>, reading the error outcomes in the PDS’s logs on my server.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Seek help in the ATProto Touchers Discord server, and at their advice delete the account.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Start over and re-create everything from scratch, correctly replacing the public key in my DID with the public key from <code>getRecommendedDidCredentials</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Log into Bluesky (bsky.app) and get a “Profile does not exist error.”</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>It was at this point that I found <a href="https://github.com/bluesky-social/atproto/issues/3455">this GitHub issue</a>, which seems to imply that, since I deleted my (completely empty and unused) account, my did:web is blacklisted from the remaining mostly-centralized bit of the system, the AppView. The term for this is being “burned”, and it was later confirmed by some more experienced users that this is a known but undocumented behavior of the Bluesky AppView.</p>
<p>I had one of my friends who uses Bluesky take a look, and the failure mode is interesting. On Bluesky, I don’t exist at all. (She could not see my likes, or my follow of her.) On Blacksky production, my display name and bio are visible, but not my posts. On Blacksky’s own AppView, it’s the opposite; my posts appear under an “invalid” profile.</p>
<p>This is bad.</p>
<section id="The-Opinion-Zone">
<h3>The Opinion Zone</h3>
<p>So, a while ago, I wrote a post called <a href="https://notes.nora.codes/atproto">“Key Management, ATProto, and Decentralization”</a> in which I complained about ATProto’s approach to decentralization. Since then, Blacksky has spun up an AppView, which makes it theoretically possible to have an actually decentralized experience on Bluesky. This was my line in the sand, stated many times; I would make an account when and only when it was possible to do so without using anything running on Bluesky-the-company’s hardware. That’s now, so I figured I’d try it.</p>
<p>I use lots of systems I don’t love, like Signal, Matrix, and Mastodon. I use them because they give me access to social interaction with people I care about. ATProto, and specifically Bluesky, is the same; I have friends who don’t post anywhere else. Today, I follow them by RSS, but can’t interact with their posts. That’s where my motivation to use the network comes from, along with understanding how, and how well, the newly decentralized AppView layer works.</p>
<p>Very little of this process is documented. Sure, the individual endpoints are - kind of - but the only place the whole process is collected in one place is in the comments to <a href="https://github.com/bluesky-social/atproto/issues/3143">this GitHub issue</a>… which is closed as WONTFIX. The documentation for that <code>getRecommendedDidCredentials</code> endpoint that I missed reads in full:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Describe the credentials that should be included in the DID doc of an account that is migrating to this service.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Note that I am <strong>not</strong> “migrating”; this account is new. Plus, the JSON keys it returns are almost, but not quite, the same as those in a DID document, and the key it returns actually has to be edited by hand in order to be usable.</p>
<p>This is not good! <code>did:web</code> has been held up as the “less centralized” or “bring your own trust” option, as opposed to <code>did:plc</code>, and it seems like there has been very little effort to make it usable, certainly not for “normal” users.</p>
<p>But there’s another issue, a bigger issue. Why is a centralized “burn” able to completely prevent me from interacting with people using Bluesky?</p>
<p>You may be aware that Mastodon has a similar system. If you set up a Mastodon server and then delete the database, anyone you’ve already federated with won’t federate with you again, because you can’t prove you’re the same instance. It’s a genuine issue - but it wouldn’t have resulted in this, because I hadn’t even made a post on my now-burned did:web identity, nor followed anyone.</p>
<p>Even if I had, though, that would have burned <strong>a</strong> connection, not <strong>all</strong> connections. 
My experience would be degraded, but not ruined, and I could work with the admins of the affected servers to remediate it.
You could say the same here, of course; maybe (maybe) support will get back to me some day, but it’s just that - support. There is only, really, one connection that matters; maybe two, if you count Blacksky, but their AppView is not generally available yet. That’s centralization. I don’t understand how you could call it anything else.</p>
<p>I don’t like Bluesky, or ATProto; I wish we lived in a world were community-driven projects got megabucks and we were all self-hosting little social media servers for our communities. We don’t live in that world, so we have to interoperate with VC-backed, corporate social media. When those platforms call themselves “decentralized”, I think they should deliver.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.aerotime.aero/articles/faa-drone-no-fly-zone-ice-dhs">https://www.aerotime.aero/articles/faa-drone-no-fly-zone-ice-dhs</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46755999">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
				
<p>The Federal Aviation Administration has issued a nationwide security notice, effectively creating a moving drone no-fly zone around operations conducted by Immigration and Customs Enforcement&nbsp;(ICE)&nbsp;and other components of the Department of Homeland Security.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The notice, <a href="https://tfr.faa.gov/tfr3/?page=detail_6_4375&amp;ref=404media.co" rel="nofollow" title="">NOTAM FDC 6/4375</a>, prohibits unmanned&nbsp;aircraft&nbsp;systems from&nbsp;operating&nbsp;within&nbsp;3,000 feet&nbsp;laterally and&nbsp;1,000 feet&nbsp;vertically of DHS facilities and mobile assets, including ground vehicle convoys and their escorts. The restriction applies nationwide and continuously, rather than at fixed locations or during defined time windows.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Because ICE&nbsp;operates&nbsp;under DHS and routinely conducts enforcement actions using mobile vehicle convoys in public spaces, the restriction functions as a drone no-fly zone around ICE operations, including arrests, transport activities and other field actions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The FAA classifies the restricted airspace as “national defense airspace,”&nbsp;and cites its authority under federal security statutes. Drone operators who violate the restriction may face criminal prosecution, civil penalties, administrative enforcement actions, or revocation of FAA operating privileges. The notice also&nbsp;states&nbsp;that drones&nbsp;deemed&nbsp;a credible security threat may be intercepted, seized, damaged, or destroyed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Unlike traditional Temporary Flight Restrictions, the NOTAM does not provide geographic coordinates, activation times, or public notification when the restriction is in effect near a specific location. Instead, the restricted airspace moves with DHS assets, meaning the no-fly zone can appear wherever ICE or other DHS units&nbsp;operate.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The new NOTAM replaces an earlier security notice, FDC 5/6378, which covered similar federal agencies but was less explicit about mobile operations. The updated version removes ambiguity by clearly&nbsp;stating&nbsp;that the restriction applies to moving DHS assets, including vehicles and convoys, and not just fixed facilities such as offices or bases.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That clarification has drawn attention from drone operators&nbsp;and civil liberties groups because it creates dynamic, invisible exclusion zones that may be&nbsp;impossible&nbsp;to&nbsp;identify&nbsp;in real time. The FAA does not publish public tracking of DHS or ICE movements, and the NOTAM does not include a mechanism for drone pilots to&nbsp;determine&nbsp;when covered assets are nearby.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In practical terms, a drone operator flying legally in a public area could unknowingly enter restricted airspace if an ICE convoy passes within the protected radius. The FAA instructs operators to “exercise caution” when flying near DHS facilities and mobile assets, but offers no specific guidance on how to do so in environments where enforcement activity is not publicly&nbsp;disclosed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The notice mentions limited exceptions. Drone operations conducted in direct support of national defense, homeland security, law enforcement, firefighting, search and rescue, or disaster response missions may be authorized with advance coordination. Operators seeking approval are instructed to coordinate with DHS or other covered&nbsp;agencies, or&nbsp;contact the FAA’s System Operations Support Center.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The FAA cites multiple federal statutes as the legal basis for the restriction, including laws governing national&nbsp;defense&nbsp;airspace and counter-UAS mitigation.</p>

<p>Protesters <a href="https://www.facebook.com/watch/live/?ref=watch_permalink&amp;v=1389002139370676">disrupted services</a> on Sunday at the Cities Church in St. Paul, chanting “ICE OUT” and “Justice for Renee Good.” The St. Paul Pioneer Press <a href="https://www.twincities.com/2026/01/19/st-paul-cities-church-protest-doj/">quoted Levy Armstrong</a> as saying, “When you think about the federal government unleashing barbaric ICE agents upon our community and all the harm that they have caused, to have someone serving as a pastor who oversees these ICE agents is almost unfathomable to me.”</p>
<p>The church <a href="https://www.citieschurch.com/leadership">website</a> lists David Easterwood as one of its pastors. Protesters said this is the same David Easterwood who is listed as a defendant in a lawsuit that Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison filed against Noem and other federal officials. The <a href="https://www.ag.state.mn.us/Office/Communications/2026/docs/00190_DHS_Complaint.pdf">lawsuit</a> lists Easterwood as a defendant “in his official capacity as Acting Director, Saint Paul Field Office, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.”</p>
<p>Levy Armstrong, who is also a former president of the NAACP’s Minneapolis branch, was arrested yesterday morning. Announcing the arrest, Attorney General Pam Bondi <a href="https://x.com/AGPamBondi/status/2014344323706302566">wrote</a>, “WE DO NOT TOLERATE ATTACKS ON PLACES OF WORSHIP.” Bondi alleged that Levy Armstrong “played a key role in organizing the coordinated attack on Cities Church in St. Paul, Minnesota.”</p>

<h2>Multiple arrests</h2>
<p>Noem said Levy Armstrong “is being charged with a federal crime under 18 USC 241,” which <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/241">prohibits</a> “conspir[ing] to injure, oppress, threaten, or intimidate any person in any State, Territory, Commonwealth, Possession, or District in the free exercise or enjoyment of any right or privilege secured to him by the Constitution or laws of the United States.”</p>
<p>“Religious freedom is the bedrock of the United States—there is no first amendment right to obstruct someone from practicing their religion,” Noem wrote.</p>
<p>St. Paul School Board member Chauntyll Allen was also arrested. Attorneys for the Cities Church issued <a href="https://truenorthlegal.org/news/cities-church-attorneys-at-true-north-legal-respond-to-department-of-justice-action">statements</a> supporting the arrests and saying they “are exploring all legal options to protect the church and prevent further invasions.”</p>
<p>A federal magistrate judge initially ruled that Levy Armstrong and Allen could be released, but they were still being held last night after the government “made a motion to stay the release for further review, claiming they might be flight risks,” the Pioneer Press <a href="https://www.twincities.com/2026/01/22/the-woman-who-led-a-protest-at-a-minnesota-church-service-has-been-arrested-bondi-says/">wrote</a>.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
                

                <div>
                    <p>
                        While I was working on a project with Wayfair, I got the opportunity to work on a system that generated daily business reports aggregated from multiple data sources flowing through event streams across Wayfair. At a high level, Kafka consumers listened to these events, hydrated them with additional data by calling downstream services, and finally persisted the enriched events into a durable datastore—CloudSQL PostgreSQL on GCP.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        When everything was healthy, the pipeline worked exactly as expected. Events flowed in, got enriched, and were stored reliably. The real challenge started when things went wrong, which, in distributed systems, is not an exception but a certainty.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        There were multiple failure scenarios we had to deal with. Sometimes the APIs we depended on for hydration were down or slow. Sometimes the consumer itself crashed midway through processing. In other cases, events arrived with missing or malformed fields that could not be processed safely. These were all situations outside our direct control, but they still needed to be handled gracefully.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        This is where the concept of a Dead Letter Queue came into the picture. Whenever we knew an event could not be processed successfully, instead of dropping it or blocking the entire consumer, we redirected it to a DLQ so it could be inspected and potentially reprocessed later.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Our first instinct was to use Kafka itself as a DLQ. While this is a common pattern, it quickly became clear that it wasn't a great fit for our needs. Kafka is excellent for moving data, but once messages land in a DLQ topic, they are not particularly easy to inspect. Querying by failure reason, retrying a specific subset of events, or even answering simple questions like "what failed yesterday and why?" required extra tooling and custom consumers. For a system that powered business-critical daily reports, this lack of visibility was a serious drawback.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        That's when we decided to treat PostgreSQL itself as the Dead Letter Queue.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Instead of publishing failed events to another Kafka topic, we persisted them directly into a DLQ table in PostgreSQL. We were already using CloudSQL as our durable store, so operationally this added very little complexity. Conceptually, it also made failures first-class citizens in the system rather than opaque messages lost in a stream.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Whenever an event failed processing—due to an API failure, consumer crash, schema mismatch, or validation error—we stored the raw event payload along with contextual information about the failure. Each record carried a simple status field. When the event first landed in the DLQ, it was marked as <code>PENDING</code>. Once it was successfully reprocessed, the status was updated to <code>SUCCEEDED</code>. Keeping the state model intentionally minimal made it easy to reason about the lifecycle of a failed event.
                    </p>

                    <h3>DLQ Table Schema and Indexing Strategy</h3>

                    <p>
                        To support inspection, retries, and long-term operability, the DLQ table was designed to be simple, query-friendly, and retry-aware.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Table Schema</h4>

                    <pre><code>CREATE TABLE dlq_events (
    id BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    event_type VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    payload JSONB NOT NULL,
    error_reason TEXT NOT NULL,
    error_stacktrace TEXT,
    status VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL, -- PENDING / SUCCEEDED
    retry_count INT NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
    retry_after TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW()
);</code></pre>

                    <h4>Key Design Considerations</h4>

                    <ul>
                        <li><code>payload</code> is stored as <code>JSONB</code> to preserve the raw event without enforcing a rigid schema.</li>
                        <li><code>status</code> keeps the lifecycle simple and explicit.</li>
                        <li><code>retry_after</code> prevents aggressive retries when downstream systems are unstable.</li>
                        <li><code>retry_count</code> allows retry limits to be enforced without external state.</li>
                        <li>Timestamps make auditing and operational analysis straightforward.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>Indexes</h4>

                    <pre><code>CREATE INDEX idx_dlq_status
ON dlq_events (status);

CREATE INDEX idx_dlq_status_retry_after
ON dlq_events (status, retry_after);

CREATE INDEX idx_dlq_event_type
ON dlq_events (event_type);

CREATE INDEX idx_dlq_created_at
ON dlq_events (created_at);</code></pre>

                    <p>
                        These indexes allow the retry scheduler to efficiently locate eligible events while still supporting fast debugging and time-based analysis without full table scans.
                    </p>

                    <h3>DLQ Retry Mechanism with ShedLock</h3>

                    <p>
                        Persisting failed events solved the visibility problem, but we still needed a safe and reliable way to retry them.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        For this, we introduced a DLQ retry scheduler backed by ShedLock. The scheduler periodically scans the DLQ table for <code>PENDING</code> events that are eligible for retry and attempts to process them again. Since the service runs on multiple instances, ShedLock ensures that only one instance executes the retry job at any given time. This eliminates duplicate retries without requiring custom leader-election logic.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Retry Configuration</h4>

                    <pre><code>dlq:
  retry:
    enabled: true
    max-retries: 240
    batch-size: 50
    fixed-rate: 21600000 # 6 hours in milliseconds</code></pre>

                    <h4>How Retries Work</h4>

                    <ul>
                        <li>The scheduler runs every six hours.</li>
                        <li>Up to fifty eligible events are picked up per run.</li>
                        <li>Events exceeding the maximum retry count are skipped.</li>
                        <li>Successful retries immediately transition the event status to <code>SUCCEEDED</code>.</li>
                        <li>Failures remain in <code>PENDING</code> and are retried in subsequent runs.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>Query Implementation</h4>

                    <p>
                        The retry scheduler uses a SQL query with <code>FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED</code> to safely select eligible events across multiple instances. This PostgreSQL feature ensures that even if multiple scheduler instances run simultaneously, each will pick up different rows without blocking each other:
                    </p>

                    <pre><code>@QueryHints(@QueryHint(name = "jakarta.persistence.lock.timeout", value = "-2"))
@Query(
    value = "SELECT * FROM dlq_table "
        + "WHERE messagetype = :messageType "
        + "AND retries &lt; :maxRetries "
        + "AND (replay_status IS NULL OR replay_status NOT IN ('COMPLETED')) "
        + "ORDER BY created_at ASC "
        + "FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED",
    nativeQuery = true
)</code></pre>

                    <p>
                        The <code>FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED</code> clause is crucial here. It allows each instance to lock and process different rows concurrently, preventing duplicate processing while maintaining high throughput. The query hint sets the lock timeout to <code>-2</code>, which means "wait indefinitely" but combined with <code>SKIP LOCKED</code>, it effectively means "skip any rows that are already locked by another transaction."
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        This setup allowed the system to tolerate long downstream outages while avoiding retry storms and unnecessary load on dependent services.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Operational Benefits</h3>

                    <p>
                        With this approach, failures became predictable and observable rather than disruptive. Engineers could inspect failures using plain SQL, identify patterns, and reprocess only the events that mattered. If a downstream dependency was unavailable for hours or even days, events safely accumulated in the DLQ and were retried later without human intervention. If an event was fundamentally bad, it stayed visible instead of being silently dropped.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Most importantly, this design reduced operational stress. Failures were no longer something to fear; they were an expected part of the system with a clear, auditable recovery path.
                    </p>

                    <h3>My Thoughts</h3>

                    <p>
                        The goal was never to replace Kafka with PostgreSQL. Kafka remained the backbone for high-throughput event ingestion, while PostgreSQL handled what it does best—durability, querying, and observability around failures. By letting each system play to its strengths, we ended up with a pipeline that was resilient, debuggable, and easy to operate.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        In the end, using PostgreSQL as a Dead Letter Queue turned failure handling into something boring and predictable. And in production systems, boring is exactly what you want.
                    </p>

Following yesterday's release of <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/news/Wine-11.1-Released">Wine 11.1</a> for kicking off the new post-11.0 development cycle, Wine-Staging 11.1 is now available for this experimental/testing version of Wine that present is around 254 patches over the upstream Wine state.
</p><p>
Besides re-basing those 250+ patches to the latest Wine Git state, the latest VKD3D Git code is also pulled into Wine-Staging 11.1. There is some new feature work with Wine-Staging... Landing the new patches for enabling the recent Adobe Photoshop versions to successfully install and run under Wine on Linux.
</p><p>
As covered last week, <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/news/Adobe-Photoshop-2025-Wine-Patch">the latest Adobe Photoshop installer is working and the app running</a> with some new patches against the Wine code for its MSXML3 and MSHTML code. Those patches were cited in <a href="https://bugs.winehq.org/show_bug.cgi?id=47015">Bug 47015</a> for upstream Wine around the Photoshop Creative Cloud 2019 screen hitting MSXML3 errors.
</p><p>
Upstream Wine Git hasn't yet taken those patches but now they are in Wine-Staging 11.1 for further testing by the community.
</p><p><img src="https://www.phoronix.net/image.php?id=2026&amp;image=wine_staging_111_1" alt="Wine-Staging 11.1 patches for Adobe Photoshop"></p>
<p>Hopefully the testing will go well and those patches will get picked up by an upstream Wine 11.x bi-weekly development release in the near future.
</p><p><img src="https://www.phoronix.net/image.php?id=2026&amp;image=wine_staging_111_2" alt="Wine-Staging 11.1 patches"></p>
<p>Besides those MSHTML/MSXML3 work to benefit Adobe software, there aren't any other new patches in Wine-Staging 11.1. Those looking for new binaries to test it out can find them via <a href="https://www.winehq.org/">WineHQ.org</a>.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article id="article-body"><p data-testid="paragraph-content">As many as 30,000 people could have been killed in the streets of Iran on Jan. 8 and 9 alone, two senior officials of the country’s Ministry of Health told TIME—indicating a dramatic surge in the death toll. So many people were slaughtered by Iranian security services on that Thursday and Friday, it overwhelmed the state’s capacity to dispose of the dead. Stocks of body bags were exhausted, the officials said, and eighteen-wheel semi-trailers replaced ambulances.</p><div><p data-testid="paragraph-content">The government’s internal count of the dead, not previously revealed, far surpasses the toll of 3,117 announced on Jan. 21 by regime hardliners who report directly to Iran’s Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei. (Ministries report to the elected President.) The 30,000 figure is also far beyond tallies being compiled by activists methodically assigning names to the dead. As of Saturday, the U.S.-based Human Rights Activists News Agency said it had confirmed 5,459 deaths and is investigating 17,031 more.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-content">TIME has been unable to independently verify these figures.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-content">The Health Ministry’s two-day figure roughly aligns with a count gathered by physicians and first responders, and also shared with TIME. That surreptitious tally of deaths recorded by hospitals stood at 30,304 as of Friday, according to Dr. Amir Parasta, a German-Iranian eye surgeon who prepared a report of the data. Parasta said that number does not reflect protest-related deaths of people registered at military hospitals, whose bodies were taken directly to morgues, or that happened in locales the inquiry did not reach. Iran’s National Security Council has said protests took place in around 4,000 locations across the country.  </p></div><div><p data-testid="paragraph-content">“We are getting closer to reality,” Dr. Parasta said. “But I guess the real figures are still way higher.”</p><p data-testid="paragraph-content">That appears to be the reality implicit in the government’s internal figure of more than 30,000 deaths in two days. A slaughter on that scale, in the space of 48 hours, had experts on mass killing groping for comparisons.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-content">“Most spasms of killing are not from shootings,” said Les Roberts, a professor at Columbia University who specializes in the epidemiology of violent death. “In Aleppo [Syria] and in Fallujah [Iraq], when spasms of death this high have occurred over a few days, it involved mostly explosives with some shooting.”</p><p data-testid="paragraph-content">The only parallel offered by online databases occurred in the Holocaust. On the outskirts of Kyiv on Sept. 29 and 30, 1941,<a href="https://time.com/6102593/ukraine-holocaust-memorial-kremlin-propaganda/"> Nazi death squads</a> executed 33,000 Ukrainian Jews by gunshot in a ravine known as<a href="https://encyclopedia.ushmm.org/content/en/article/kiev-and-babi-yar"> Babyn Yar</a>.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-content">In Iran, the killing fields extended across the country where, since Dec. 28, hundreds of thousands of citizens had assembled in the streets chanting first, for relief from an economy in freefall, and soon for the downfall of the Islamic regime. During the first week, security forces confronted some demonstrations, using mostly non-lethal force, but with officials also offering conciliatory language, the regime response was uncertain. That changed during the weekend commencing Jan. 8. Protests peaked, as opposition groups, <a href="https://x.com/PahlaviReza/status/2009041925647548815">including</a> <a href="https://time.com/7346706/reza-pahlavi-iran-crown-prince-trump-protests/">Reza Pahlavi,</a> the exiled son of Iran’s former shah, urged people to join the throngs, and U.S. President Donald Trump repeated <a href="https://time.com/7347090/iran-protesters-trump-help/">vows to protect them</a>, though no help arrived.</p></div><div><p data-testid="paragraph-content">Witnesses say millions were in the streets when authorities shut down the internet and all other communications with the outside world. Rooftop snipers and trucks mounted with heavy machine guns opened fire, according to eyewitnesses and cell phone footage. On Friday, Jan. 9, an official of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps warned on state television to anyone venturing into the streets, “if … a bullet hits you, don’t complain.”</p><p data-testid="paragraph-content">It took days for the reality to penetrate the internet blackout. Images of the bloodied bodies trickled out<a href="https://time.com/6249365/iran-elon-musk-starlink-protests/"> via illicit Starlink</a> satellite internet connections. The task of counting the dead was hampered, however, because the authorities had also cut off lines of communications inside Iran. The first firm information came from a Tehran doctor <a href="https://time.com/7345092/iran-protests-death-toll-regime-crackdown/">who told </a>TIME that just six hospitals in the capital had recorded at least 217 protester deaths after Thursday’s assault. Health care workers in Iran estimated at least 16,500 protesters had been killed by Jan. 10, according to an earlier report by Dr. Parasta in Munich. Friday’s update built on that research, he said.</p></div><div><p data-testid="paragraph-content">“I am genuinely impressed by how quickly this work was pulled together under extremely constrained and risky conditions,” said Paul B. Spiegel, a professor at the Johns Hopkins University International School of Health. Like Roberts, he expressed wariness of extrapolating from the figures provided by hospitals.&nbsp;</p><p data-testid="paragraph-content">Roberts, who traveled into war zones to research civilian death rates <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140673606694919/abstract">in Iraq</a> and the Democratic Republic of <a href="https://carnegieendowment.org/events/2000/10/continuing-crisis-in-the-drc-the-unheralded-death-toll-and-its-implications">Congo</a>, said, “the 30,000 verified deaths are almost certainly an underestimate.”</p><p data-testid="paragraph-content">The emergence of the Ministry of Health numbers appears to confirm that—while underscoring the stakes for both Iranians and a regime that, in 1979, came to power when a sitting government was confronted by millions of people demanding its downfall.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-content">On Friday, Jan. 9, Sahba Rashtian, an aspiring animation artist, joined friends on the streets in Isfahan, a city in central Iran famous for its beauty. "Before anyone started chanting," a friend told TIME, "Sahba was seen collapsed on the ground. Her sister noticed blood on her hand.”</p></div><p data-testid="paragraph-content">Sahba died on an operating table at a nearby hospital. She was 23.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-content">“She always joked about her beautiful name,” her friend said. “She’d laugh and say, ‘Sahba means wine, and I am forbidden in the Islamic Republic.’”</p><p data-testid="paragraph-content">At the burial, the friend said, religious rites were barred, and Rashtian’s father wore white.&nbsp;</p><p data-testid="paragraph-content">“Congratulations,” he told mourners, according to the friend. “My daughter became a martyr on the path to freedom.”</p></article></div></div>]]></description>
