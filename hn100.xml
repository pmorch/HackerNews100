<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
			<p>I propose that the advent and integration of AI models into the workflows of developers has stifled the adoption of new and potentially superior technologies due to training data cutoffs and system prompt influence.</p>
<p>I have noticed a bias towards specific technologies in multiple popular models and have noted anecdotally in conversation and online discussion people choosing technology based on how well AI tooling can assist with its usage or implementation.</p>
<p>While it has long been the case that developers have considered documentation and support availability when choosing software, AI’s influence dramatically amplifies this factor in decision-making, often in ways that aren’t immediately apparent and with undisclosed influence.</p>
<h2 id="the-knowledge-gap">The Knowledge Gap</h2>
<p>Large language models, especially those on the scale of many of the most accessible, popular hosted options, take humongous datasets and long periods to train. By the time everything has been scraped and a dataset has been built, the set is on some level already obsolete. Then, before a model can reach the hands of consumers, time must be taken to train and evaluate it, and then even more to finally deploy it.</p>
<p>Once it has finally released, it usually remains stagnant in terms of having its knowledge updated. This creates an AI knowledge gap. A period between the present and AI’s training cutoff. This gap creates a time between when a new technology emerges and when AI systems can effectively support user needs regarding its adoption, meaning that models will not be able to service users requesting assistance with new technologies, thus disincentivising their use.</p>
<p>The cutoff means that models are strictly limited in knowledge up to a certain point. For instance, Anthropic’s latest models have a cutoff of <a href="https://support.anthropic.com/en/articles/8114494-how-up-to-date-is-claude-s-training-data">April 2024</a>, and OpenAI’s latest models have cutoffs of <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/models">late 2023</a>.</p>
<p>The influence of the popularisation of AI models has also led to the proliferation of AI slop content, which AI companies are likely trying to avoid introducing in their scraped data sets – potentially increasing this knowledge gap.</p>
<p>This knowledge gap doesn’t just stifle the adoption of new frameworks and tooling but also the adoption of new and potentially superior features introduced in updates to already in-use frameworks and tooling as a result of the models not yet including information about them in their training set. This is a lesser issue though, because a technology with existing market adoption is bound to have fanatics who will use it, create examples, and produce blog posts, documentation, and other media about it that will eventually end up in training data.</p>
<p>While some models are used in contexts where they are equipped with tooling, such as ChatGPT with its internet search capabilities, their prompts often only instruct them to use this functionality when explicitly requested by a user. Of course, plenty of implementations don’t have any access to any internet query functionality at all, such as Claude via its web interface, which will inform you it will only discuss things included in its training data.</p>
<p>Of course, if people are reluctant to adopt a new technology because of a lack of AI support, there will be fewer people likely to produce material regarding said technology, which leads to an overall inverse feedback effect. Lack of AI support prevents a technology from gaining the required critical adoption mass, which in turn prevents a technology from entering use and having material made for it, which in turn starves the model of training data, which in turn disincentivises selecting that technology, and so on and so forth.</p>
<p>Consider a developer working with a cutting-edge JavaScript framework released just months ago. When they turn to AI coding assistants for help, they find these tools unable to provide meaningful guidance because their training data predates the framework’s release. This forces developers to rely solely on potentially limited official documentation and early adopter experiences, which, for better or worse, tends to be an ‘old’ way of doing things and incentivises them to use something else.</p>
<h2 id="system-prompt-influence">System Prompt Influence</h2>
<p>I’ve anecdotally noticed that many AI tools have a ‘preference’ for React and Tailwind when asked to tackle a web-based task, or even to create any app involving an interface at all.</p>
<p>With Claude 3.5 Sonnet, which is generally my AI offering of choice given its superior coding ability, my “What personal preferences should Claude consider in responses?” profile setting includes the line “When writing code, use vanilla HTML/CSS/JS unless otherwise noted by me”. Despite this, Claude will <em>frequently</em> opt to generate new code with React, and in some occurrences even rewrite my existing code into React against my intent and without my consultation.</p>
<p>While Anthropic <a href="https://docs.anthropic.com/en/release-notes/system-prompts">publishes Claude’s core system prompts</a>, they do not publish the system prompts of specific features, such as artifacts. However, a <a href="https://github.com/jujumilk3/leaked-system-prompts/blob/main/claude-artifacts_20240620.md">leaked system prompt</a> for Claude’s artifacts feature shows that both React and Tailwind are specifically mentioned with explicit instruction on how they should be handled. It also specifically mentions the diagramming tool <a href="http://mermaid.js.org/">Mermaid</a> and a set of React libraries, including <a href="https://recharts.org/">Recharts</a>, <a href="https://ui.shadcn.com/">shadcn/ui</a>, and <a href="https://lucide.dev/">Lucide icons</a>, as well as <a href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/">Cloudflare’s cdnjs</a>.</p>
<p>This can be evidenced when asking Claude to use a certain technology, such as Svelte Runes, where it will instead direct the user towards its preferred technology. For example:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Me:</strong> Build me something with Svelte Runes.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Claude:</strong> I apologize, but I am not able to create Svelte Runes components directly, as the artifact environment only supports certain technologies like React, HTML, and SVG. I can help you build something similar using React, or I can provide you with Svelte Runes code that you can use in your own Svelte project. Which would you prefer?</p>
<p>If you’d like to see a React version, I can create something with similar reactive functionality using React’s hooks. Or if you want Svelte Runes code specifically, I can write that for you to use in your own environment.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It does provide a choice, but chances are someone will select <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Path_of_least_resistance">the path of least resistance</a>.</p>
<h3 id="testing">Testing</h3>
<p>To test if popular models do have built-in bias for React, I logged into the web interfaces of four of the current most popular AI chat platforms<sup><a id="footnote-ref-1" href="#footnote-1" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label">1</a></sup> via my free account and asked the models to “Create me a web app. It can do anything.”. I repeated this with each of the four models three times in fresh chats with previous chats deleted and any shared context (such as ChatGPT’s memory feature) disabled or cleared between each test.</p>
<p>I asked Anthropic’s Claude 3.5 Sonnet with blank personal preferences and artifacts enabled. The first time it opted to create a mood tracking app, the second a reading list manager, and the third time a to-do list. Each time it chose to generate it using React with Tailwind CSS for styling. It generated each project in an artifact which offered an interactive preview directly in the interface.</p>
<p>I asked OpenAI’s ChatGPT 4o with both custom instructions and memory disabled. It produced a note-taking app the first time, a random quote generator the second time, and a to-do list the third time. All using React with Tailwind for styling and presented in <a href="https://openai.com/index/introducing-canvas">canvases</a>. These canvases came with a preview button, which, much like with Claude, offered an interactive preview of the React project it built directly in the interface.</p>
<p>I asked Google’s Gemini 2.0 Flash with app activity disabled. All three times it built to-do list apps using vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Each time, it also noted that I should consider using JavaScript frameworks on the frontend, namely React, Angular, and Vue - in that order.</p>
<p>I asked DeepSeek’s DeepSeek-V3, and it returned a to-do list app using vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. On the second request, it created a project outline for a to-do list app, but this time with Bootstrap, Node.js, Express.js, and SQLite. The third time, it created another outline for a note-taking app but with Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB.</p>
<p>DeepSeek had the greatest variation in technology used but is the least accessible model and didn’t actually ‘create’ the app as requested – merely a general outline for it.</p>
<p>These tests show both Claude and ChatGPT have a strong preference for React and Tailwind, <sup><a id="footnote-ref-2" href="#footnote-2" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label">2</a></sup> that Gemini has a preference for HTML/CSS/JS but will recommend React and that DeepSeek is much more flexible and varied with its technological choices, though requires more prompting to produce an actual output.</p>
<h2 id="reflection">Reflection</h2>
<p>I’d suggest that a beginner developer, or someone creating an app exclusively via prompting, is likely to use ChatGPT due to its position in the zeitgeist and use whatever output the model first produces without much second thought – thus influencing their tech selection without their realising.</p>
<p>Even if a developer does opt to use another framework or toolset, there is a chance that the model will prod them towards a selection more aligned with its system prompt, even going as far as rewriting their code to its ‘preference’ against user request, as evidenced by Claude ignoring my request for vanilla web technologies.</p>
<p>That is assuming that a specific framework or toolset hasn’t already been chosen by the user specifically because they have heard or experienced it being best handled by AI models. Also, while this very much applies to larger technical choices, such as what framework or general tooling a project may choose, it also trickles down into smaller decisions, such as what libraries or modules they may import.</p>
<p>I think it is evident that AI models are influencing technology, and that the technologies currently in use – especially those that reached popularity before November 2022, when ChatGPT was released, or that are otherwise in current data sets – will be around for a long time to come, and that AI models’ preferential treatment of them will expand their adoption and lifespan.</p>
<p>I think it would be prudent for AI companies to provide more transparent documentation of technology biases in their models, like they disclose that their models can make mistakes. These models are becoming a common part of developer knowledge and decision-making, and we’re letting the training and prompting decisions of OpenAI, Anthropic, etc shape the entire direction of software development.</p>
<p>As for further research on this topic, if one had a collection of system prompts over time, it may be possible to compare them to download trends of specified packages and identify correlations. Of course, there are a lot of other influences on the download and adoption of packages, so this may prove difficult and provide data too noisy and influenced by outside variables to be unusable.</p>

<p>The doge.gov website that was spun up to track Elon Musk’s cuts to the federal government is insecure and pulls from a database that can be edited by anyone, according to two separate people who found the vulnerability and shared it with 404 Media. One coder added at least two database entries that are visible on the live site and say “<a href="https://doge.gov/workforce?orgId=1&amp;ref=404media.co"><u>this is a joke of a .gov site</u></a>” and “<a href="https://doge.gov/workforce?orgId=7cd300eb-cf3f-47f5-90f1-9e66a8bc8d07&amp;ref=404media.co"><u>THESE ‘EXPERTS’ LEFT THEIR DATABASE OPEN -roro</u></a>.”&nbsp;</p><p>Doge.gov was hastily deployed after Elon Musk <a href="https://www.404media.co/elon-musks-waste-gov-is-just-a-wordpress-theme-placeholder-page/"><u>told reporters Tuesday</u></a> that his Department of Government Efficiency is “trying to be as transparent as possible. In fact, our actions—we post our actions to the DOGE handle on X, and to the DOGE website.” At the time, DOGE was an essentially blank webpage. It was built out further Wednesday and Thursday, and now shows a mirror of the @DOGE X account posts, as well as various stats about the U.S. government’s federal workforce.&nbsp;</p><p>Two different web development experts who asked to remain anonymous because they were probing a federal website told 404 Media that doge.gov is seemingly built on a Cloudflare Pages site that is not currently hosted on government servers. The database it is pulling from can be and has been written to by third parties, and will show up on the live website.&nbsp;</p><p>Both sources told 404 Media that they noticed Doge.gov is pulling from a Cloudflare Pages website, where the code that runs it is actually deployed.</p>

            <span>Abstract:</span>This paper introduces an open-source benchmark for evaluating Vision-Language Models (VLMs) on Optical Character Recognition (OCR) tasks in dynamic video environments. We present a curated dataset containing 1,477 manually annotated frames spanning diverse domains, including code editors, news broadcasts, YouTube videos, and advertisements. Three state of the art VLMs - Claude-3, Gemini-1.5, and GPT-4o are benchmarked against traditional OCR systems such as EasyOCR and RapidOCR. Evaluation metrics include Word Error Rate (WER), Character Error Rate (CER), and Accuracy. Our results highlight the strengths and limitations of VLMs in video-based OCR tasks, demonstrating their potential to outperform conventional OCR models in many scenarios. However, challenges such as hallucinations, content security policies, and sensitivity to occluded or stylized text remain. The dataset and benchmarking framework are publicly available to foster further research.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-slug="/blog/wasmexport">
    
    <h2><a href="https://go.dev/blog/">The Go Blog</a></h2>
    

    
      
      
      
      <p>Go 1.24 enhances its WebAssembly (Wasm) capabilities with the
addition of the <code>go:wasmexport</code> directive and the ability to build a reactor
for WebAssembly System Interface (WASI).
These features enable Go developers to export Go functions to Wasm,
facilitating better integration with Wasm hosts and expanding the possibilities
for Go-based Wasm applications.</p>
<h2 id="webassembly-and-the-webassembly-system-interface">WebAssembly and the WebAssembly System Interface</h2>
<p><a href="https://webassembly.org/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">WebAssembly (Wasm)</a> is a binary instruction format
that was initially created for web browsers, providing the execution of
high-performance, low-level code at speeds approaching native performance.
Since then, Wasm’s utility has expanded, and it is now used in various
environments beyond the browser.
Notably, cloud providers offer services that directly execute Wasm
executables, taking advantage of the
<a href="https://wasi.dev/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">WebAssembly System Interface (WASI)</a> system call API.
WASI allows these executables to interact with system resources.</p>
<p>Go first added support for compiling to Wasm in the 1.11 release, through the
<code>js/wasm</code> port.
Go 1.21 added a new port targeting the WASI preview 1 syscall API through the
new <code>GOOS=wasip1</code> port.</p>
<h2 id="exporting-go-functions-to-wasm-with-gowasmexport">Exporting Go Functions to Wasm with <code>go:wasmexport</code></h2>
<p>Go 1.24 introduces a new compiler directive, <code>go:wasmexport</code>, which allows
developers to export Go functions to be called from outside of the
Wasm module, typically from a host application that runs the Wasm runtime.
This directive instructs the compiler to make the annotated function available
as a Wasm <a href="https://webassembly.github.io/spec/core/valid/modules.html?highlight=export#exports" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">export</a>
in the resulting Wasm binary.</p>
<p>To use the <code>go:wasmexport</code> directive, simply add it to a function definition:</p>
<pre><code>//go:wasmexport add
func add(a, b int32) int32 { return a + b }
</code></pre>
<p>With this, the Wasm module will have an exported function named <code>add</code> that
can be called from the host.</p>
<p>This is analogous to the <a href="https://go.dev/cmd/cgo#hdr-C_references_to_Go">cgo <code>export</code> directive</a>,
which makes the function available to be called from C,
though <code>go:wasmexport</code> uses a different, simpler mechanism.</p>
<h2 id="building-a-wasi-reactor">Building a WASI Reactor</h2>
<p>A WASI reactor is a WebAssembly module that operates continuously, and
can be called upon multiple times to react on events or requests.
Unlike a “command” module, which terminates after its main function finishes,
a reactor instance remains live after initialization, and its exports remain
accessible.</p>
<p>With Go 1.24, one can build a WASI reactor with the <code>-buildmode=c-shared</code> build
flag.</p>
<pre><code>$ GOOS=wasip1 GOARCH=wasm go build -buildmode=c-shared -o reactor.wasm
</code></pre>
<p>The build flag signals to the linker not to generate the <code>_start</code> function
(the entry point for a command module), and instead generate an
<code>_initialize</code> function, which performs runtime and package initialization,
along with any exported functions and their dependencies.
The <code>_initialize</code> function must be called before any other exported functions.
The <code>main</code> function will not be automatically invoked.</p>
<p>To use a WASI reactor, the host application first initializes it by calling
<code>_initialize</code>, then simply invoke the exported functions.
Here is an example using <a href="https://wazero.io/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Wazero</a>, a Go-based Wasm runtime
implementation:</p>
<pre><code>// Create a Wasm runtime, set up WASI.
r := wazero.NewRuntime(ctx)
defer r.Close(ctx)
wasi_snapshot_preview1.MustInstantiate(ctx, r)

// Configure the module to initialize the reactor.
config := wazero.NewModuleConfig().WithStartFunctions("_initialize")

// Instantiate the module.
wasmModule, _ := r.InstantiateWithConfig(ctx, wasmFile, config)

// Call the exported function.
fn := wasmModule.ExportedFunction("add")
var a, b int32 = 1, 2
res, _ := fn.Call(ctx, api.EncodeI32(a), api.EncodeI32(b))
c := api.DecodeI32(res[0])
fmt.Printf("add(%d, %d) = %d\n", a, b, c)

// The instance is still alive. We can call the function again.
res, _ = fn.Call(ctx, api.EncodeI32(b), api.EncodeI32(c))
fmt.Printf("add(%d, %d) = %d\n", b, c, api.DecodeI32(res[0]))
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>go:wasmexport</code> directive and the reactor build mode allow applications to
be extended by calling into Go-based Wasm code.
This is particularly valuable for applications that have adopted Wasm as a
plugin or extension mechanism with well-defined interfaces.
By exporting Go functions, applications can leverage the Go Wasm modules to
provide functionality without needing to recompile the entire application.
Furthermore, building as a reactor ensures that the exported functions can be
called multiple times without requiring reinitialization, making it suitable
for long-running applications or services.</p>
<h2 id="supporting-rich-types-between-the-host-and-the-client">Supporting rich types between the host and the client</h2>
<p>Go 1.24 also relaxes the constraints on types that can be used as input and
result parameters with <code>go:wasmimport</code> functions.
For example, one can pass a bool, a string, a pointer to an <code>int32</code>, or a
pointer to a struct which embeds <code>structs.HostLayout</code> and contains supported
field types
(see the <a href="https://go.dev/cmd/compile#hdr-WebAssembly_Directives">documentation</a> for detail).
This allows Go Wasm applications to be written in a more natural and ergonomic
way, and removes some unnecessary type conversions.</p>
<h2 id="limitations">Limitations</h2>
<p>While Go 1.24 has made significant enhancements to its Wasm capabilities,
there are still some notable limitations.</p>
<p>Wasm is a single-threaded architecture with no parallelism.
A <code>go:wasmexport</code> function can spawn new goroutines.
But if a function creates a background goroutine, it will not continue
executing when the <code>go:wasmexport</code> function returns, until calling back into
the Go-based Wasm module.</p>
<p>While some type restrictions have been relaxed in Go 1.24, there are still
limitations on the types that can be used with <code>go:wasmimport</code> and
<code>go:wasmexport</code> functions.
Due to the unfortunate mismatch between the 64-bit architecture of the client
and the 32-bit architecture of the host, it is not possible to pass pointers in
memory.
For example, a <code>go:wasmimport</code> function cannot take a pointer to a struct that
contains a pointer-typed field.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>The addition of the ability to build a WASI reactor and export Go functions to
Wasm in Go 1.24 represent a significant step forward for Go’s WebAssembly
capabilities.
These features empower developers to create more versatile and powerful Go-based
Wasm applications, opening up new possibilities for Go in the Wasm ecosystem.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://zed.dev/blog/edit-prediction">https://zed.dev/blog/edit-prediction</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43045606">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>Zed is built for speed. We've always strived for an editing experience that feels <em>instant</em>. But what's faster than instant?  A tool that anticipates your next move. That's why we're introducing <a href="https://zed.dev/edit-prediction">edit prediction</a> in Zed, powered by <a href="https://huggingface.co/zed-industries/zeta">Zeta</a>, our new open source model.</p>
<p>Here's a quick walkthrough:</p>
<p><figure><video src="https://customer-snccc0j9v3kfzkif.cloudflarestream.com/32e5feacc10b8e63292918b21e9ae15c/downloads/default.mp4" width="640" height="360" controls=""></video><figcaption>Edit Prediction in action.</figcaption></figure></p>
<p>As you work, Zed now predicts your next edit, so you can apply it just by hitting <code>tab</code>. Once you accept a prediction, you can perform multiple follow-up edits by pressing <code>tab</code> repeatedly, saving you time and keystrokes. We've received <em>a ton</em> of requests for this functionality, and we've poured our hearts into making it feel like a natural extension of the Zed experience.</p>
<p>You can use Zeta for free during this public beta by <a href="https://zed.dev/download">downloading Zed</a> and signing in with your GitHub account. Edit prediction won't be free forever, but right now we're just excited to share and learn.</p>
<h2 id="thoughtful-integration"><a href="#thoughtful-integration" aria-label="Copy heading link"><span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="10" height="10" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><line x1="4" x2="20" y1="9" y2="9"></line><line x1="4" x2="20" y1="15" y2="15"></line><line x1="10" x2="8" y1="3" y2="21"></line><line x1="16" x2="14" y1="3" y2="21"></line></svg></span><span>Thoughtful Integration</span></a></h2>
<p>Edit prediction transforms <code>tab</code> into a magical, universal key. But what about the existing uses of <code>tab</code>, such as indenting lines? And what happens when there's both an edit prediction <em>and</em> suggestions from your language server? We didn't want a powerful new feature to come at the expense of the existing editing experience in Zed.</p>
<p><figure><video loop="" muted="" autoplay="" preload="metadata" controls="" playsinline=""><source src="https://customer-snccc0j9v3kfzkif.cloudflarestream.com/4f9b29a42d9bfa64e5457dec716f59be/downloads/default.mp4" type="video/webm; codecs=&quot;vp8.0, vorbis&quot;"><source src="https://customer-snccc0j9v3kfzkif.cloudflarestream.com/4f9b29a42d9bfa64e5457dec716f59be/downloads/default.mp4" type="video/mp4; codecs=&quot;avc1.4D401E, mp4a.40.2&quot;"></video><figcaption>Zeta predictions together with language server completions.</figcaption></figure></p>
<p>When language server completions are visible, Zed won't preview the predicted edit until you press <code>option</code> or <code>alt</code>. As soon as you press the modifier, Zed previews the edit and hides the menu to enable an unobstructed review. On macOS, you can just hit <code>tab</code> to confirm, or back out by releasing <code>option</code> to restore the language server completions menu.</p>
<p>On Linux, <code>alt-tab</code> is often reserved by the window manager, so we offer <code>alt-l</code> as an alternative default. We chose <code>l</code> because it's on the QWERTY home row and represents rightward movement in Vim. If your Linux window manager doesn't claim <code>alt-tab</code>, you're free to use that binding as well.</p>

<p><a href="https://huggingface.co/zed-industries/zeta">Zeta</a> is derived from Qwen2.5-Coder-7B, and is fully open source, including <a href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/zed-industries/zeta">an open dataset</a>. If you're working in an open source repository, we'd love your help improving Zeta by contributing to its dataset. Please bear with us initially, as we will be reviewing the submitted data before publishing to ensure everyone's safety and privacy.

<p>Most coding models are trained on a "fill in the middle" task. You give them a prefix and a suffix, and they generate what goes in between.</p>
<figure data-rehype-pretty-code-figure=""><div><pre><code data-language="rs" data-theme="dark-plus light-plus"><span data-line=""><span>&lt;|</span><span>fim_prefix</span><span>|&gt;</span><span>fn</span><span> quicksort</span><span>(</span><span>array</span><span>: &amp;</span><span>mut</span><span> [</span><span>T</span><span>]) {</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>    if</span><span> array</span><span>.</span><span>len</span><span>() &lt;= </span><span>1</span><span> {</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>        return</span><span>;</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>    }</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>    let</span><span> pivot</span><span> = </span><span>partition</span><span>(</span><span>array</span><span>);</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>    &lt;|</span><span>fim_suffix</span><span>|&gt;</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>    quicksort</span><span>(&amp;</span><span>mut</span><span> array</span><span>[</span><span>pivot</span><span> + </span><span>1</span><span>..]);</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>}&lt;|</span><span>fim_middle</span><span>|&gt;</span></span></code></pre></div></figure>
<p>This works for completing text at the cursor, but we wanted Zeta to predict edits at arbitrary locations, which doesn't fit into this structure.</p>
<p>In our experience, models aren't very good at producing granular edits, but they do excel at rewriting larger chunks of code. So that's where we started: given a list of recent edits and the cursor position, we asked the model to rewrite a snippet of text around the cursor, incorporating one or more edit predictions in the rewritten text.</p>
<h3 id="evaluating-predictions"><a href="#evaluating-predictions" aria-label="Copy heading link"><span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="10" height="10" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><line x1="4" x2="20" y1="9" y2="9"></line><line x1="4" x2="20" y1="15" y2="15"></line><line x1="10" x2="8" y1="3" y2="21"></line><line x1="16" x2="14" y1="3" y2="21"></line></svg></span><span>Evaluating Predictions</span></a></h3>
<p>Before writing a single line of code, we created a set of tests to check if our idea worked. Testing the output of a large language model is tricky because, on every run, you can get slightly different results even when feeding it the exact same input. This can be mitigated by using a temperature of <code>0</code> and, for providers that support it, providing a seed for the RNG.</p>
<p>That said, code can often be written in many different but equally valid ways. So even when Zeta's output differs from our expected answer, it might still be doing exactly what we want—just taking a different path to get there. This makes traditional unit testing approaches particularly challenging when working with LLMs.</p>
<p>This led us to take a different approach—instead of strict assertions, we used a larger LLM to evaluate Zeta's edits. By writing our test assertions in plain English and having Claude check if the results matched our intent, we could validate that Zeta was making sensible edits, even when its exact output differed between runs. This ended up being much more practical than trying to make brittle assertions about specific tokens.</p>
<p>Here's an example taken from our eval suite:</p>
<figure data-rehype-pretty-code-figure=""><div><pre><code data-language="rs" data-theme="dark-plus light-plus"><span data-line=""><span>// Input:</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>pub</span><span> fn</span><span> quicksort</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>: </span><span>Ord</span><span>&gt;(</span><span>arr</span><span>: &amp;</span><span>mut</span><span> [</span><span>T</span><span>]) {</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>    let</span><span> len</span><span> = </span><span>arr</span><span>.</span><span>len</span><span>();</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>    if</span><span> len</span><span> &lt;= </span><span>1</span><span> {</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>        return</span><span>;</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>    }</span></span>
<span data-line=""> </span>
<span data-line=""><span>    let</span><span> pivot_index</span><span> = </span><span>partition</span><span>(</span><span>arr</span><span>);</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>    &lt;|</span><span>user_cursor_is_here</span><span>|&gt;</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>}</span></span>
<span data-line=""> </span>
<span data-line=""><span>// Assertion: Ensure that the quicksort function recurses to the left and to the right of the pivot.</span></span></code></pre></div></figure>
<h3 id="prompt-engineering"><a href="#prompt-engineering" aria-label="Copy heading link"><span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="10" height="10" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><line x1="4" x2="20" y1="9" y2="9"></line><line x1="4" x2="20" y1="15" y2="15"></line><line x1="10" x2="8" y1="3" y2="21"></line><line x1="16" x2="14" y1="3" y2="21"></line></svg></span><span>Prompt Engineering</span></a></h3>
<p>We took our first stab at making those tests pass by using Qwen2.5-Coder-32B and giving it clear instructions for which types of edits we wanted it to predict. <a href="https://github.com/zed-industries/zed/blob/79a70b72b3968d102c6171f8bd2738ec7be8e94f/crates/zeta/src/complete_prompt.md">Here's the initial system prompt</a> we used and you can look through the history to see how we kept changing it to pass the eval suite.</p>
<p>This worked out surprisingly well for the first 4-5 evals. However, as soon as we introduced more, we started noticing that it got harder and harder to pass them all consistently. Changing the prompt caused the new evals to pass, but made the old ones fail. Overall, it felt like a flaky process and we didn't feel confident this would lead to the system being robust enough to be used in production.</p>
<p>Moreover, using a 32b model wasn't really compatible with our strict latency requirements (more on that later).</p>
<h3 id="supervised-fine-tuning"><a href="#supervised-fine-tuning" aria-label="Copy heading link"><span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="10" height="10" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><line x1="4" x2="20" y1="9" y2="9"></line><line x1="4" x2="20" y1="15" y2="15"></line><line x1="10" x2="8" y1="3" y2="21"></line><line x1="16" x2="14" y1="3" y2="21"></line></svg></span><span>Supervised Fine-Tuning</span></a></h3>
<p>After playing around with different approaches, we decided to go with supervised fine-tuning using <a href="https://unsloth.ai/">Unsloth</a> and LoRA. The idea was to teach Zeta two key things: figuring out what changes a developer might want next based on their recent edits, and then actually applying those changes cleanly to the code without introducing weird side effects.</p>
<p>But we had a classic chicken-and-egg problem—we needed data to train the model, but we didn't have any real examples yet. So we started by having Claude generate about 50 synthetic examples that we added to <a href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/zed-industries/zeta-dataset">our dataset</a>. We then used that initial fine-tune to ship an early version of Zeta behind a feature flag and started collecting examples from our own team's usage.</p>
<p>This approach let us quickly build up a solid dataset of around 400 high-quality examples, which improved the model a lot! However, we kept running into edge cases that would trip the model up. The most annoying ones were when Zeta was working with a small piece of code in a larger file—it would sometimes get confused and make random deletions or insertions that had nothing to do with what the user was trying to do, and it didn't seem like adding more examples steered the model away from those mistakes.</p>
<h3 id="direct-preference-optimization"><a href="#direct-preference-optimization" aria-label="Copy heading link"><span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="10" height="10" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><line x1="4" x2="20" y1="9" y2="9"></line><line x1="4" x2="20" y1="15" y2="15"></line><line x1="10" x2="8" y1="3" y2="21"></line><line x1="16" x2="14" y1="3" y2="21"></line></svg></span><span>Direct Preference Optimization</span></a></h3>
<p>To handle these edge cases, we conducted another pass using direct preference optimization (DPO). This technique let us go beyond simply showing the model what good edits look like—we could also teach it what edits <em>to avoid</em>. With DPO, we could fine-tune Zeta by providing both positive and negative examples, helping it learn the subtle differences between helpful and problematic edits.</p>
<p>We found that just ~150 carefully selected examples were enough to significantly improve Zeta's behavior on tricky cases. Of course, we think we can make it even better by expanding our training data with more diverse examples, and we're excited to keep pushing the boundaries here.</p>
<h3 id="minimizing-latency-speculative-decoding"><a href="#minimizing-latency-speculative-decoding" aria-label="Copy heading link"><span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="10" height="10" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><line x1="4" x2="20" y1="9" y2="9"></line><line x1="4" x2="20" y1="15" y2="15"></line><line x1="10" x2="8" y1="3" y2="21"></line><line x1="16" x2="14" y1="3" y2="21"></line></svg></span><span>Minimizing Latency: Speculative Decoding</span></a></h3>
<p>Like every feature in Zed, latency was a critical factor for edit prediction. When we started, we set aggressive performance targets: predictions should be delivered in under 200ms for the median case (p50) and under 500ms for the 90th percentile (p90). The challenge was that rewriting complete excerpts, while enabling multi-location edits, requires generating significantly more tokens than simple fill-in-middle approaches. Initially, this put us way over our latency budget.</p>
<p>However, there's a fascinating insight about how edit predictions work. When we rewrite a text snippet, the output often mirrors the input closely, with changes concentrated in specific spots. This pattern lets us parallelize token generation by using the input as a reference—a technique known as speculative decoding. We use n-gram search to identify promising jumping-off points in the input where we can start parallel token generation, giving us a significant speedup without sacrificing quality.</p>
<h3 id="minimizing-latency-serving-the-model"><a href="#minimizing-latency-serving-the-model" aria-label="Copy heading link"><span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="10" height="10" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><line x1="4" x2="20" y1="9" y2="9"></line><line x1="4" x2="20" y1="15" y2="15"></line><line x1="10" x2="8" y1="3" y2="21"></line><line x1="16" x2="14" y1="3" y2="21"></line></svg></span><span>Minimizing Latency: Serving The Model</span></a></h3>
<p>For edit predictions to feel responsive, we needed to solve multiple latency challenges in parallel. As discussed above, we tackled the model execution time through speculative decoding, but serving the model at scale presented its own set of hurdles. This was by far the most compute-intensive problem our team has ever tackled.</p>
<p>A few weeks out from launch, we ran a brief competitive process, and we ended up being really impressed with <a href="https://www.baseten.co/">Baseten</a>. Their performance engineers quickly optimized our open source model to run on their flexible infrastructure, achieving our target latencies while letting us retain full visibility into the details of the deployment, both for the Zed team and the entire Zed community. We plan to follow up with a guest post about what they learned optimizing <a href="https://huggingface.co/zed-industries/zeta">our model</a>.</p>
<p>Latency is not just a function of compute; network transit time is a key driver of perceived speed. To cooperate with the laws of physics, we're launching with GPUs in both North America and Europe, and we hope to add more regions soon. We're also using <a href="https://workers.cloudflare.com/">Cloudflare Workers</a> to handle your requests in a data center located as close to you as possible.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion"><a href="#conclusion" aria-label="Copy heading link"><span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="10" height="10" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><line x1="4" x2="20" y1="9" y2="9"></line><line x1="4" x2="20" y1="15" y2="15"></line><line x1="10" x2="8" y1="3" y2="21"></line><line x1="16" x2="14" y1="3" y2="21"></line></svg></span><span>Conclusion</span></a></h2>
<p>There's plenty more to explore to make edit predictions more powerful. We'll be fast-following with more experiments. We plan on sending more kinds of context to the model and continuing our experiments with fine-tuning, and we'll share updates as we grow and evolve the Zeta dataset.</p>
<p>We've learned a lot since we launched Zed AI last fall. The world is changing fast, and we're having a blast exploring and learning to build features that developers love. We're also excited to build with AI the Zed way. From our early days, we've been proponents of an open approach to building software, even when hard, and we see no reason to change that approach when it comes to working with AI. We hope you'll join us as a user, a contributor, or an employee, as we hustle to ship a golden future.</p><hr></article></div>]]></description>

<p>
There's an interesting theory out there that X causes Y. If this were true, it would be pretty important. So I did a deep-dive into the academic literature on whether X causes Y. Here's what I found.
</p>
<p>
(Embarrassingly, I can't actually remember what X and Y are. I think maybe X was enriched preschool, or just school itself, or eating fish while pregnant, or the Paleo diet, or lead exposure, or a clever "nudge" policy trying to get people to save more, or some self-help technique, or some micronutrient or public health intervention, or democracy, or free trade, or some approach to intellectual property law. And Y was ... lifetime earnings, or risk of ADHD diagnosis, or IQ in adulthood, or weight loss, or violent crime, or peaceful foreign policy, or GDP per capita, or innovation. Sorry about that! Hope you enjoy the post anyway! Fortunately, I think <strong>what I'm about to write is correct for pretty much any (X,Y) from those sorts of lists.</strong>)
</p>
<p>
In brief:
</p>
<ul>

</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-chaff">The chaff: lots of unhelpful studies that I'm disregarding</h2>


<p>
First, the good news: there are hundreds of studies on whether X causes Y. The bad news? We need to throw most of them out. 
</p>
<p>
Many have comically small sample sizes (like studying 20 people) and/or comically short time horizons (like looking at weight loss over two weeks),<sup id="fnref1"><a href="#fn1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> or unhelpful outcome measures (like intelligence tests in children under 5).<sup id="fnref2"><a href="#fn2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> But by far the most common problem is that <strong>most of the studies on whether X causes Y are simple observational studies: they essentially just find that people/countries with more X also have more Y. </strong>
</p>
<p>
Why is this a problem? There could be a <em>confounder</em> - some third thing, Z, that is correlated with both X and Y. And there are specific reasons we should expect confounders to be common:
</p>
<ul>

<li>In general, people/countries that have more X also have more of lots of other helpful things - they're richer, they're more educated, etc. For example, if we're asking whether higher-quality schooling leads to higher earnings down the line, an issue is that people with higher-quality schooling also tend to come from better-off families with lots of other advantages.

</li><li>In fact, the <em>very fact that people in upper-class intellectual circles think X causes Y</em> means that richer, more educated people/countries tend to deliberately get more X, and also try to do a lot of other things to get more Y. For example, more educated families tend to eat more fish (complicating the attempt to see whether eating fish in pregnancy is good for the baby).<sup id="fnref3"><a href="#fn3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup></li></ul>
<p>
Now, a lot of these studies try to "control for" the problem I just stated - they say things like "We examined the effect of X and Y, while controlling for Z [e.g., how wealthy or educated the people/countries/whatever are]." How do they do this? The short answer is, well, hm, jeez. Well you see, to simplify matters a bit, just try to imagine ... uh ... shit. Uh. The only high-level way I can put this is:
</p>
<ul>

<li>They use a technique called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis">regression analysis</a> that, as far as I can determine, cannot be explained in a simple, intuitive way (especially not in terms of how it "controls for" confounders).

</li><li>The "controlling for" thing relies on a lot of subtle assumptions and can break in all kinds of weird ways. <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0152719">Here's </a>a technical explanation of some of the pitfalls; <a href="https://www.cold-takes.com/phil-birnbaums-regression-analysis/">here's</a> a set of deconstructions of regressions that break in weird ways.

</li><li>None of the observational studies about whether X causes Y discuss the pitfalls of "controlling for" things and whether they apply here.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
I don't think we can trust these papers, and to really pick them all apart (given how many there are) would take too much time. So let's focus on a smaller number of better studies.
</p>
<h2 id="the-wheat">The wheat: 1-5 more interesting studies</h2>


<p>
Digging through the sea of unhelpful studies, I found 1-5 of them that are actually really interesting! 
</p>
<p>
For example, one study examines some strange historical event you've never heard of (perhaps a <a href="https://davidcard.berkeley.edu/papers/mariel-impact.pdf">surge in Cuban emigration triggered by Fidel Castro suddenly allowing it</a>, or <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3800113/">John Rockefeller's decision to fund a hookworm eradication campaign</a>, or a <a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.103.6.2437">sudden collective pardon leading to release of a third of prison inmates in Italy</a>), where for abstruse and idiosyncratic reasons, X got distributed in what seems to be almost a random way. This study is really clever, and the authors were incredibly thorough in examining seemingly every way their results could have been wrong. They conclude that X causes Y!
</p>
<p>
But on closer inspection, I have a bunch of reservations. For example:
</p>
<ul>

<li>The paper doesn't make it easy to replicate its analysis, and when someone does manage to sort-of replicate it, they may <a href="https://blog.givewell.org/2017/12/07/questioning-evidence-hookworm-eradication-american-south/">get different results</a>. 

</li><li>There was other weird stuff going on (e.g., changes in census data collection methods<sup id="fnref5"><a href="#fn5" rel="footnote">5</a></sup>), during the strange historical event, so it's a little hard to generalize.

</li><li>In a response to the study, another academic advances a complex theory of how the study could actually have gotten a misleading result. This led to an intense back-and-forth between the original authors and the skeptic, stretched out over years because each response had to be published in a journal, and by the time I got to the end of it I didn't have any idea what to think anymore.<sup id="fnref6"><a href="#fn6" rel="footnote">6</a></sup></li></ul>
<p>
I found 0-4 other interesting studies. I can't remember all of the details, but they may have included:
</p>
<ul>

<li>A study comparing siblings, or maybe "very similar countries," that got more or less of X.<sup id="fnref7"><a href="#fn7" rel="footnote">7</a></sup>

</li><li>A study using a complex mathematical technique claiming to cleanly isolate the effect of X and Y. I can't really follow what it's doing, and I’m guessing there are a lot of weird assumptions baked into this analysis.<sup id="fnref8"><a href="#fn8" rel="footnote">8</a></sup>

</li><li>A study with actual randomization: some people were randomly assigned to receive more X than others, and the researchers looked at who ended up with more Y. This sounds awesome! However, there are issues here too: 
<ul>
 
<li>It's kind of ambiguous whether the assignment to X was really "random."<sup id="fnref9"><a href="#fn9" rel="footnote">9</a></sup>
 
</li><li>Extremely weird things happened during the study (for example, <a href="https://www.givewell.org/international/technical/programs/deworming/reanalysis#Our_initial_reservations">generational levels of flooding</a>), so it's not clear how well it generalizes to other settings.
 
</li><li>The result seems fragile (<a href="https://www.givewell.org/international/technical/programs/deworming#Other_studies_of_long-term_effects">simply adding more data weakens it a lot</a>) and/or just hard to believe (like <a href="https://nutritionj.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12937-017-0287-9">schoolchildren doing noticeably better on a cognition test after a few weeks of being given fish instead of meat with their lunch, even though they mostly didn't eat the fish</a>). </li></ul></li></ul>
<p>
Compounding the problem, the 1-5 studies I found tell very different stories about the relationship between X and Y. How could this make sense? Is there a unified theory that can reconcile all the results?
</p>
<p>
Well, one possibility is that X causes Y sometimes, but only under very particular conditions, and the effect can be masked by some other thing going on. So - if you meet one of 7 criteria, you should do X to get more Y, but if you meet one of 9 other criteria, you should actually avoid X!
</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>


<p>
I have to say, this all was simultaneously more fascinating and less <em>informative</em> than I expected it would be going in. I thought I would find some nice studies about the relationship between X and Y and be done. Instead, I've learned a ton about weird historical events and about the ins and outs of different measures of X and Y, but I feel just super confused about whether X causes Y.
</p>
<p>
I guess my bottom line is that X does cause Y, because it intuitively seems like it would.
</p>
<p>
I'm glad I did all this research, though. It's good to know that social science research can go haywire in all kinds of strange ways. And it's good to know that despite the confident proclamations of pro- and anti-X people, it's legitimately just super unclear whether X causes Y. 
</p>
<p>
I mean, how else could I have learned that?
</p>
<h2 id="appendix">Appendix: based on a true story</h2>


<p>
This piece was inspired by:
</p>
<ul>

<li>Most evidence reviews GiveWell has done, especially of <a href="https://www.givewell.org/international/technical/programs/deworming">deworming</a>

</li><li>Many evidence reviews by David Roodman, particularly <a href="https://www.cgdev.org/publication/macro-aid-effectiveness-research-guide-perplexed-working-paper-135">Macro Aid Effectiveness Research: a Guide for the Perplexed</a>; <a href="https://smile.amazon.com/dp/B0095V3J0S/">Due Diligence: an Impertinent Inquiry into Microfinance</a>; and <a href="https://www.openphilanthropy.org/blog/reasonable-doubt-new-look-whether-prison-growth-cuts-crime">Reasonable Doubt: A New Look at Whether Prison Growth Cuts Crime</a>. 

</li><li>Many evidence reviews by Slate Star Codex, collected <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/tag/much-more-than-you-wanted-to-know/">here</a>.

</li><li>Informal evidence reviews I've done for e.g. personal medical decisions.
</li></ul>
<p>
The basic patterns above apply to most of these, and the bottom line usually has the kind of frustrating ambiguity seen in this conclusion.</p>
    
<p>There are cases where things seem a bit less ambiguous and the bottom line seems clearer. Speaking broadly, I think the main things that contribute to this are:
</p>
<ul>

<li>Actual randomization. For years I've nodded along when people say "You shouldn't be dogmatic about randomization, there are many ways for a study to be informative," but each year I've become a bit more dogmatic. Even the most sophisticated-, appealing-seeming alternatives to randomization in studies seem to have a way of falling apart. Randomized studies almost always have problems and drawbacks too. But I’d rather have a randomized study with drawbacks than a non-randomized study with drawbacks.

</li><li>Extreme thoroughness, such as Roodman's attempt to reconstruct the data and code for key studies in <a href="https://www.openphilanthropy.org/blog/reasonable-doubt-new-look-whether-prison-growth-cuts-crime">Reasonable Doubt</a>. This sometimes leads to outright dismissing a number of studies, leaving a smaller, more consistent set remaining.
</li>
</ul>

<dl>
<dt><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/12/apple-resumes-advertising-on-x/">Apple Has Resumed Advertising on X for the First Time Since Late 2023</a></dt>
<dd>
<p>Joe Rossignol, MacRumors:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Apple this month started advertising on X for the first time in
more than a year. The company <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/17/apple-pauses-ads-on-x/">had stopped advertising</a> on
the social media platform in November 2023 following controversial
remarks made by its owner Elon Musk.</p>

<p>For example, the @Apple account is <a href="https://x.com/apple/status/1889089503278813659">running an ad</a> promoting
Safari’s privacy features. The ad was spotted by MacRumors
contributor <a href="https://x.com/aaronp613">Aaron Perris</a>. The @AppleTV account has <a href="https://twitter.com/AdtechBrags/status/1888708923651440701">also
been running ads</a> for the Apple TV+ show Severance.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The November 2023 outrage was in response to, among other things, <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1724908287471272299">Musk replying</a> “You have said the actual truth” to <a href="https://x.com/breakingbaht/status/1724892505647296620">a tweet from a rando</a> that stated “I’m deeply disinterested in giving the tiniest shit now about western Jewish populations coming to the disturbing realization that those hordes of minorities that support flooding their country don’t exactly like them too much. You want truth said to your face, there it is.”</p>

<p>Musk clearly learned his lesson. Since then, he’s been lying low, out of the public eye, and refraining from any sort of controversial statements or actions. He barely even tweets anymore. The one and only time I can recall him even being in the news in the last 18 months was <a href="https://www.wsj.com/business/elon-musk-illegal-drugs-e826a9e1">this year-ago profile in the Wall Street Journal</a> documenting Musk’s health and nutrition regimen. So it’s all cool now and Apple feels comfortable advertising on the social network Musk wholly owns.</p>

</span>
I'll let you in a secret.  The maintainers are not "all-powerfui".  We
are the "thin blue line" that is trying to keep the code to be
maintainable and high quality.  Like most leaders of volunteer
organization, whether it is the Internet Engineerint Task Force (the
standards body for the Internet), we actually have very little power.
We can not *command* people to work on retiring technical debt, or to
improve testing infrastructure, or work on some particular feature
that we'd very like for our users.

All we can do is stop things from being accepted (either in our
subsystem, or the imprimatur of the IETF).  Hopefully, we're only
stopping bad things from progressing, but that *really* is all we can
actually do.

One of the things which gets very frustrating from the maintainer's
perspective is development teams that are only interested in their pet
feature, and we *know*, through very bitter experience, that 95+% of
the time, once the code is accepted, the engineers which contribute
the code will disappear, never to be seen again.  As a result, a very
common dynamic is that maintainers will exercise the one and only
power which they have --- which is to refuse to accept code until it
is pretty much perfect --- since once we accept the code, we instantly
lose all leverge, and the contributors will be disappear, and we will
be left with the responsibility of cleanig up the mess.  (And once
there are users, we can't even rip out the code, since that would be a
user-visible regression.)

Occasionally, there is an accusation that different standards that
might apply for people who are in the "gold old buys club".  But what
isn't appreciated, is that it is precisely because people who are
long-term members of the community are trusted to stick around and
will support code that the have sponsored.  For example, Darrick Wong,
who contributed ext4 metadata checksuming support before we moved on
to become the XFS maintainer, is still reviewing and making
contributions to code that he contributed many years to ext4.  I've
been known to submit fixes to test bugs for xfs-specific tests in
xfstests that I discovered when running daily spinner tests on the
linux git tree.

Just in the past two weeks, I've spent 15+ hours working on cleaning
up a casefold "security fix" that had nasty on-disk backwards
compatibility issues.  Part of it was that it was ext4 (although I
discovered that there was also fsck.f2fs problems that had been
overlooked), but the *other* part of why I spent so much time was that
I sponsored the casefolding patches, and so I felt I certain moral
responsibility to make sure the code was continued to be maintained.

(And note, this has nothing to do with who employs me; the 15-20 hours
that I spent working on creating the fix and the test scripts was
purely on my own time, on the weekend, or late at night.  The time
that I spend doing this isn't reflected in my performance reviews, or
promotion propects --- in fact, arguably, over the past 15 years, this
has probably slowed down my promotion prospects; I've only been
promoted once since joining said big tech company...)

<span>&gt; Not sure what the fix is, from a project management perspective the
&gt; technology industry has never faced a challenge like this.  The fork
&gt; model, which was the classic protection in open-source, doesn't work
&gt; at this scale.
</span>
Well, here's my suggestion.  Teams that want to get features,
especially ones that might be potentially disruptive, into the tree,
need to spend time becoming part of the *community*.  This means that
they need to participate in part of the joint effort to keep the code
maintainable and high quaity --- even if it isn't part of their
company's short-term goals, or directly related to their pet feature
that they are trying to get upstream.

This was the trust of my "Beyond Upstream First" presentation which I
gave to the Linux Foundation Member Summit last fall[1].

[1] <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/11rMc8PBeyMItV6hv31OHSZ626_6FCZxjX6ZxEAehCpQ/edit#slide=id.p">https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/11rMc8PBeyMItV6hv31OHSZ626_6FCZxjX6ZxEAehCpQ/edit#slide=id.p</a>

Now, I'll say that the Rust developers are making strides in the right
direction here.  Miguel has stood for election for the Technical
Adviory Board, and has been contributing in various ways beyond just
Rust for Linux.  Ultimately, Cristoph's concern is that Rust is going
to make life harder for maintainers because of particular build breaks
getting in the way of the very limited bandwidth that Maintainers have
(and again, a lot of the work that we do gets done on our own personal
time; it's rare that even those maintainers employed by a "big
technology company" have complete freedom to work on whatever they
want; and they certainly don't have minions employed to do all of the
grunt work to support code maintenance work, especially if we let
crappy code slip past us in the name of "time to market" concerns.)

So I think we'll get past this.  It might take some more effort, and
more trust building --- on both sides --- but I'm fairly optismistic
that it will happen.  It might not happe as *fast* as people might
like; as Linus pointed out, it took ten years for the Clang compiler
to be considered 100% fully supported --- and this was without needing
to worrying about language issues, including an upstream language
community which refuses to make any kind of backwards compatibility
guarantees, and which is *actively* hostile to a second Rust compiler
implementation (I suspect because it might limit their ability to make
arbitrary backwards-incompatble language changes).

<span>&gt; Obviously respect and open-mindedness to new ideas appears to be the
&gt; grease that makes all of this run smoothly.  Unfortunately that seems
&gt; to be about as rare a commodity as omniscience in our industry.
</span>
The other thing which is super rare is people and companies who care
about tech debt cleanup, code maintainability, and code quality.
Instead of complaining about maintainers for who are unreasonably
caring about these things, when they are desparately under-resourced
to do as good of a job as they industry demands, how about meeting us
half-way and *helping* us with these sort of long-term code health
issues?  Maybe if you engage us as part of the community, we'll be a

            <span>Abstract:</span>This paper introduces the Large Memory Model (LM2), a decoder-only Transformer architecture enhanced with an auxiliary memory module that aims to address the limitations of standard Transformers in multi-step reasoning, relational argumentation, and synthesizing information distributed over long contexts. The proposed LM2 incorporates a memory module that acts as a contextual representation repository, interacting with input tokens via cross attention and updating through gating mechanisms. To preserve the Transformers general-purpose capabilities, LM2 maintains the original information flow while integrating a complementary memory pathway. Experimental results on the BABILong benchmark demonstrate that the LM2model outperforms both the memory-augmented RMT model by 37.1% and the baseline Llama-3.2 model by 86.3% on average across tasks. LM2 exhibits exceptional capabilities in multi-hop inference, numerical reasoning, and large-context question-answering. On the MMLU dataset, it achieves a 5.0% improvement over a pre-trained vanilla model, demonstrating that its memory module does not degrade performance on general tasks. Further, in our analysis, we explore the memory interpretability, effectiveness of memory modules, and test-time behavior. Our findings emphasize the importance of explicit memory in enhancing Transformer architectures.

The URL “<a href="https://openai.com/commitment-to-dei/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">https://openai.com/commitment-to-dei/</a>” now redirects to “<a rel="nofollow" href="https://openai.com/building-dynamic-teams/">https://openai.com/building-dynamic-teams/</a>,” a page that talks about people with “different backgrounds” with no use of the word “diversity.”</p>

<p>The previous page stated that the company’s “investment in diversity, equity and inclusion” was ongoing. It also said that it was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/01/25/openai-responds-to-congressional-black-caucus-about-lack-of-diversity-on-its-board/">serious about this work</a> and was committed to “continuously improving our work in creating a diverse, equitable, and inclusive organization,” as captured by the Internet Web Archive and also as cited <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/15/tech/openai-board-diversity/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">by a 2023 CNN article</a>.</p>







<p>It isn’t clear exactly when this change was made, but there’s some evidence it was very recent. The diversity commitment web page <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/tech-firms-trumps-ai-stargate-venture-touted-dei/story?id=117996988" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">was cited as available by an ABC News story</a> published on January 22. By January 27, OpenAI <a href="https://x.com/btibor91/status/1883855755436245201" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">had published</a> the new, replacement “building dynamic teams” web page.</p>

<p>The new page says, “At OpenAI, we recognize that the strongest ideas emerge when they are tested, debated, and improved by people with different backgrounds, experiences, and ways of thinking. We encourage a culture of curiosity where ideas can be challenged — not just accepted.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>OpenAI did not immediately respond to our request for comment about the website change or if it indicates any of the company’s internal processes have been rolled back or altered. OpenAI’s web page that <a rel="nofollow" href="https://openai.com/index/evaluating-fairness-in-chatgpt/">promises “fairness”</a> in model training to remove social biases is still live, for instance.</p>

<p>OpenAI is hardly the only company to distance itself from the wording of DEI as these specific words — as well as the concepts behind them — face fierce political and legal backlash these days. Last week, Attorney General Pam Bondi <a href="https://www.justice.gov/ag/media/1388501/dl?inline" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">instructed</a> the Department of Justice to “investigate, eliminate, and penalize,” DEI programs deemed illegal in private sector companies that receive federal funds.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the past month, Meta, Google, and Amazon have all announced the elimination or adjustment of DEI policies, with the latter two <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/07/amazon-deletes-inclusion-and-diversity-language-in-latest-filing/">scrubbing mention</a> of diversity and inclusion from their recent 10-K forms.&nbsp;</p>


<p>OpenAI is working with the government in a few capacities. For instance, It secured <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2024/12/04/1107897/openais-new-defense-contract-completes-its-military-pivot/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a government contract </a>and launched a <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/openai-launches-chatgpt-gov-us-government-agencies-amid-rising-ai-competition-2025-01-28/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">chatbot for government agencies.</a></p>

<p>Amazon will cease the ability to download and transfer options for the Kindle e-reader on February 26th, 2025. No Kindle can use this functionality once the due date rolls around. Only the 12th generation Kindles never had this ability to begin with, but now no other model will either. Why is Amazon doing this? It’s a feature not many people use and those who do, commit e-book piracy.</p>
<blockquote><p>Starting February 26, 2025, the “Download &amp; Transfer via USB” option will no longer be available. You can still send Kindle books to your Wi-Fi enabled devices by selecting the “Deliver or Remove from Device” option.</p></blockquote>
<p>The “download and transfer option” is located on the Amazon website when logged in. To get there, hover over the text to the right of the search bar that says “Hello, [Your Name] Account &amp; Lists”, select “Orders” from the menu that appears, then select “Digital Orders” from the “Your Orders” page that appears after selecting. You’ll see a list of Digital Orders you’ve placed, including books. Click “Manage Content and Devices” next to one of the items, and a “Digital Content” page will appear. After clicking “More Actions,” you’ll see a list of actions, including “Download &amp; Transfer via USB”. This is the option that is going away.</p>
<p>Download and Transfer via USB was launched over ten years ago and was created at a time, when WIFI was not prevalent, so this feature was the only way to send e-books to the Kindle. When you buy a Kindle book, it is automatically sent to any registered Kindle e-readers, Fire Tablets, or any Kindle apps for Android or iOS on your account.</p>
<p>Here are some essential facts to know.</p>
<ul>
<li>You can continue to use Calibre to send Kindle books to your Kindle</li>
<li>Send to Kindle will continue to work</li>
<li>You can continue to sideload e-books on your Kindle via USB cable</li>
</ul>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://blog.kagi.com/kagi-privacy-pass">https://blog.kagi.com/kagi-privacy-pass</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43040521">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            
            <p><img src="https://kagifeedback.org/assets/files/2025-02-12/1739386497-186661-image.png" alt="Kagi Privacy Pass"></p>

<p>Today we are announcing a new privacy feature coming to Kagi Search. Privacy Pass is an authentication protocol first introduced by Davidson <em>et al.,</em> in [<a href="#references">1</a>], and recently standardized by the IETF as RFCs [<a href="#references">2—4</a>]. At the same time, we are announcing the immediate availability of Kagi’s <a href="#tor">Tor onion service</a>.</p>

<p>In general terms, Privacy Pass allows “Clients” (generally users) to authenticate to “Servers” (like Kagi) in such a way that while the Server can verify that the connecting Client has the right to access its services, it cannot determine which of its rightful Clients is actually connecting. This is particularly useful in the context of a privacy-respecting paid search engine, where the Server wants to ensure that the Client can access the services, and the Client seeks strong guarantees that, for example, the searches are not associated with them.</p>

<p>As a privacy-respecting search engine, Kagi’s business model is such that we have no incentive to track what an individual user is searching for. We are in the business of selling a search product, not selling user data or attention.</p>

<p>Now, Privacy Pass adds another layer of trust: we can verify that you have the right to search without knowing who you are or what you’re searching for. It’s one thing to promise we won’t track you; it’s another to make it technically impossible. We jumped on the opportunity to implement Privacy Pass as soon as the IETF made it an official standard.</p>

<p>This matters, because for many users, privacy isn’t just about incentives and privacy policies; it’s about proof. When we cannot track you even if we wanted to, that’s genuine privacy.</p>

<p>Initially, we will be offering Privacy Pass to all our plans with unlimited searches: Professional, Ultimate, Family, and Team plans. Privacy Pass will not be available to Trial and Starter plans due to technical limitations at this moment (see below for more info).</p>

<p><a name="use"></a>
To get started with Kagi Privacy Pass right away:</p>

<ul>
<li>Download the newest version of Kagi’s <a href="https://kagi.com/orion">Orion Browser</a> (for macOS/iOS/iPadOS) with Kagi Privacy Pass natively integrated. You will need at least 0.99.131 for macOS and 1.3.17 for iOS/iPadOS (they are expected to be rolling out globally today).</li>
</ul>

<p>OR</p>

<ul>
<li>Download the newest version of <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kagi.search&amp;hl=en_US">Kagi for Android</a> app with Kagi Privacy Pass natively integrated. You will need to use at least version 0.29 (this is expected to roll out globally today).</li>
</ul>

<p>OR</p>

<ul>
<li>Download the extension for <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/kagi-privacy-pass/">Firefox</a> or <a href="https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/kagi-privacy-pass/mendokngpagmkejfpmeellpppjgbpdaj">Chrome</a></li>
<li>If you are already using the Kagi Search extension, you will want to update it to the latest version (0.7.6 on <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/kagi-search-for-firefox">Firefox</a>, 1.2.2.5 on <a href="https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/kagi-search/cdglnehniifkbagbbombnjghhcihifij">Chrome</a>) to avoid compatibility issues, or simply disable it.</li>
<li>Safari is not yet supported due to technical limitations, see the F.A.Q. below.</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition our implementation of Privacy Pass is open sourced and you can find it <a href="https://github.com/kagisearch/privacypass-extension">here</a>.</p>

<p>When using Kagi Privacy Pass mode, you’ll be truly anonymous - which means your account settings won’t be available since we can’t identify which user you are.</p>

<p>But don’t worry - we’ve made it flexible. You can easily toggle Privacy Pass on or off based on your needs. Think of it as two modes: full features with normal privacy, or maximum privacy with core features. You choose what makes sense for you based on your context and needs.</p>

<h2>An overview of Privacy Pass</h2>

<p>Privacy Pass uses cryptography to allow a client to authenticate to a server by performing a protocol with two phases: token generation and token redemption.</p>

<h2>Token generation</h2>

<p>In the initial “token generation” phase, the client interacts with the server to generate some authentication “tokens.”</p>

<p><img src="https://kagifeedback.org/assets/files/2025-02-13/1739474737-13606-image.png" alt="Generation_Phase"></p>

<p>For the server to willingly participate in this protocol, the client must prove their “right” to generate tokens.</p>

<p>In the case of Kagi’s users, this can be done by presenting their Kagi session cookie to the server.</p>

<p>The tokens eventually generated by the client at the end of this phase are indistinguishable from a randomly generated token from the server’s point of view. They cannot be traced back to the user who generated them, or to other tokens generated by the same user at the same or a different time.</p>

<h2>Token redemption</h2>

<p>After token generation is performed, a client can initiate a “token redemption” phase.</p>

<p>During this phase, the client actually accesses the services provided by the server, proving the client’s right to access the services by presenting one of the previously generated tokens.</p>

<p><a href="https://kagifeedback.org/assets/files/2025-01-13/1736805562-421965-image.png"><img src="https://kagifeedback.org/assets/files/2025-01-13/1736805562-421965-image.png" alt="token redemption"></a></p>

<p>Since the previously generated tokens are unknown and unpredictable to the server, the latter can only tell that the client has successfully completed token generation at some point.</p>

<p>Technically, we say that the techniques used by Privacy Pass result in the two phases being “unlinkable”. While the server is able to tell whether a token presented for redemption was previously generated by interacting with a rightful client, it cannot link the token to a specific token generation phase.</p>

<p>Crucially, tokens are single-use: servers keep track of which tokens have already been redeemed to avoid multiple redemptions. Furthermore, clients should not present the same token twice to prevent different redemption phases from being linked.</p>

<p>Tokens have a fixed life span. If they are too old, they will stop being redeemable. In that case, a new token generation phase must be initiated by the client to obtain new tokens.</p>



<h2>Kagi’s implementation of Privacy Pass</h2>

<h2>Deployment model</h2>

<p>As standardized in [<a href="#references">2 - 4</a>], the Privacy Pass protocol is able to accommodate many “architectures.” Our deployment model follows the original architecture presented by Davidson <em>et al.</em> [<a href="#references">1</a>], called “Shared Origin, Attester, Issuer” in § 4 of [<a href="#references">2</a>].</p>

<p>Here, Kagi plays all the “Server roles” (Attester, Issuer, Origin), and Kagi users play the Client role via the new Kagi browser extensions for Privacy Pass, or via native support in Orion. This is what it looks like in practice:</p>

<ol>
<li>Once installed, and periodically, the browser extension will generate and store a large number of tokens.</li>
<li>The user can mark in the extension whether searches should be performed by authenticating classically via a session cookie, or by using Privacy Pass.</li>
<li>If the user chooses the second option, they will authenticate to Kagi during the search by redeeming one of the tokens it previously generated.</li>
</ol>



<h2>Usage</h2>

<p>Using Privacy Pass is as easy as clicking a toggle.</p>

<h3>Orion browser</h3>

<p>If you are using the latest version of <a href="https://kagi.com/orion">Orion</a> for macOS,  select Kagi as your search engine in <code>Settings -&gt; Search</code> and then enable the checkbox for showing Privacy Pass options on your toolbar.</p>

<p>From there you can easily toggle when you want to use Privacy Pass or standard authentication.</p>

<p>On iOS and iPadOS, Kagi Privacy Pass is natively supported in the latest version of the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/orion-browser-by-kagi/id1484498200">Orion Browser</a> for iOS and iPadOS and takes just a few clicks to enable.</p>

<p>Our <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kagi.search">Android app</a> now supports Privacy Pass mode via an app shortcut. Launching the shortcut allows you to browse Kagi seamlessly in Privacy Pass mode. You can also add the shortcut to your home screen for quick access.</p>

<p>This feature lets you either use Kagi exclusively in Privacy Pass mode or switch effortlessly between modes.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: The Android app is currently under review by Google Play and will be available for download soon.</p>

<h3>Chrome and Firefox browser extensions</h3>

<p>If you are using the Kagi Privacy Pass extension for <a href="https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/kagi-privacy-pass/mendokngpagmkejfpmeellpppjgbpdaj">Chrome</a> or <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/kagi-privacy-pass/">Firefox</a>, once installed you should see the Kagi Privacy Pass icon on your toolbar.</p>

<p><img src="https://kagifeedback.org/assets/files/2025-02-13/1739474834-913179-image.png" alt="extension-toolbar"></p>

<p>Once installed, the extension automatically generates tokens. To use them, click the extension icon, and make sure the toggle is on.</p>

<p>Note that Safari is not supported at this moment; see the F.A.Q. below for more information.</p>



<h2>What guarantees does Privacy Pass offer?</h2>

<p>As used by Kagi, Privacy Pass tokens offer various security properties (§ 3.3,  of [<a href="#references">2</a>]).</p>

<p>These can be a little technical to capture. In a few words, they guarantee that users can trust that their searches authenticated via Privacy Pass cannot be linked to their accounts, and Kagi can rest assured that only legitimate users can correctly authenticate using Privacy Pass. Crucially, the guarantee for users is even against malicious servers that attempt to incorrectly implement the server-side computation, as long as the client-side implementation is correct.</p>

<p>Three of these security properties serve to protect our users:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Generation-redemption unlinkability: Kagi cannot link the tokens presented during token redemption (<em>i.e.</em> during search) with any specific token generation phase. This means that Kagi will not be able to tell who it is serving search results to, only that it is someone who presented a valid Privacy Pass token.</p></li>

<li><p>Redemption-redemption unlinkability: Kagi cannot link the tokens presented during two different token redemptions. This means that Kagi will not be able to tell from tokens alone whether two searches are being performed by the same user.</p></li>

<li><p>No redemption hijacking: an eavesdropper that observes any token generation phase, cannot use the observed information alone to “steal” the tokens from the intended user and redeem them themselves. This means that third parties snooping on a user’s token generation interaction will not be able to steal the tokens. This adds a layer of security on top of the confidentiality attained during token generation by using a TLS-protected connection.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Two of these security properties serve to protect Kagi.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Correctness: honestly generated tokens will pass Kagi’s validation.</p></li>

<li><p>One-more-forgery security: a malicious client cannot use knowledge of a correctly generated token to forge a new one. This means that valid tokens cannot be generated without correctly interacting with Kagi, and therefore valid tokens are evidence that the user owned a valid session cookie for a supported Kagi plan at the moment of generating the token.</p></li>
</ol>

<h2>Is Privacy Pass a silver bullet for all your privacy needs?</h2>

<p>Naturally, online interactions are never fully described by a mathematical model.</p>

<p>While the Privacy Pass protocol <em>does</em> indeed guarantee that the server will not be able to link token generation and token redemption phases <em>from the tokens alone</em>, in principle, a malicious server could still attempt to track clients via <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side-channel_attack">side-channel</a> information.</p>

<p>For example, if someone were to make the same specific request to a server at the same time every day (say, searching “lunch places near 123 Mulholland Drive, LA” at 11:58 AM), a server that records all searches being made could, in principle, guess that these searches are all made by the same person.</p>

<p>In this case, Privacy Pass would make it harder for the server to determine who this specific person is, but the server could nonetheless link searches to one another.</p>

<p>On a level beyond, it is well known that browsers can often have a unique “fingerprint” [<a href="#references">5-7</a>]. Fingerprinting attacks heavily rely on side-channel signals that evade the Privacy Pass protocol, such as user-agent strings or IP addresses. For example, if a server receives a token generation request from a given IP address, and immediately after a token redemption request from the same address, it can likely conclude that the same individual is behind the request. For this reason, it is <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9576.html#section-4.1">highly recommended</a> to separate token generation and redemption in time, or “in space” (by using an anonymizing service such as <a href="https://www.torproject.org/">Tor</a> when redeeming tokens, see below).</p>

<p>Kagi’s Privacy Pass extension and native implementation in Orion take care, as much as we can, to uniform your browser fingerprint, by removing deanonymizing HTTP headers and cookies.</p>

<p>We see Privacy Pass as an important tool for increasing the anonymity guarantees we can offer to Kagi users.</p>

<p>Adopting state-of-the-art standards for new privacy enhancing technologies also signals to researchers and standardization bodies that there is a public demand for more privacy and anonymity tools in today’s digital world and incentivizes further scrutiny and development of privacy-enhancing technologies.</p>



<h2>Kagi Tor service</h2>

<p><img src="https://kagifeedback.org/assets/files/2025-02-13/1739466591-66443-image.png" alt="image"></p>

<p>Together with launching Privacy Pass, we are also announcing that we now have a Tor onion service available, which allows access to Kagi directly from the Tor network. Kagi’s onion address is:</p>

<p><a href="http://kagi2pv5bdcxxqla5itjzje2cgdccuwept5ub6patvmvn3qgmgjd6vid.onion/">kagi2pv5bdcxxqla5itjzje2cgdccuwept5ub6patvmvn3qgmgjd6vid.onion</a></p>

<p>On its own, Tor will obscure your location by hiding your IP address. However, without Privacy Pass, you still need to be logged into your Kagi account to perform searches, making them all theoretically linkable back to a single account. As always, Kagi does not link searches to accounts or permanently record them; see <a href="https://kagi.com/privacy">our Privacy Policy</a> for more info.</p>

<p>With Tor and Privacy Pass together, Kagi only knows that the search is being issued by a user who previously verified that they have an account authorized to receive tokens, but nothing about the user’s account, or where they’re located.</p>

<p>See more information about <a href="https://help.kagi.com/kagi/privacy/tor.html">Kagi Tor service</a> in our documentation.</p>

<h2>Start using Kagi Privacy Pass</h2>

<p>Privacy Pass support is provided:
- Natively for <a href="https://kagi.com/orion">Orion browser</a> users (macOS/iOS/iPadOS)
- Natively through <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kagi.search&amp;hl=en_US">Kagi App for Android</a>
- Browser extension for <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/kagi-privacy-pass/">Firefox</a> or <a href="https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/kagi-privacy-pass/mendokngpagmkejfpmeellpppjgbpdaj">Chrome</a></p>

<p>This should accommodate users who want to install and use the extension across multiple browsers or computers. Please refer to our documentation for <a href="https://help.kagi.com/kagi/privacy/privacy-pass.html">usage instructions</a>.</p>

<p>At first, Privacy Pass authentication will be available to users on any Kagi plan with unlimited searches. These plans will have a generous allocation of tokens (2000 to begin with) that they can generate monthly.</p>

<p>We are working on enabling this feature for Trial and Starter plans, which have access to a limited number of monthly searches. Therefore, they risk a worse user experience if their generated tokens are lost (for example, due to uninstalling the extension) and theoretically, users on this plan could redeem more tokens than the limit of searches allowed on their plan (again, we do not know who the user redeeming the tokens is, or what plan they are on). This makes it more technically challenging to support these plans with Privacy Pass, and we have left that for later.</p>



<h2>Frequently asked questions</h2>

<p><strong>You mention “tokens.” Are blockchains involved in this protocol?</strong></p>

<p>Privacy Pass does not rely on any blockchain technology.</p>

<p>While the protocol makes use of various cryptographic primitives (specifically, elliptic curves and hash functions, as part of a “verifiable oblivious pseudorandom function” construction, [<a href="#references">8</a>]) and generates “tokens,” these are not generated, stored, or traded on a blockchain.</p>

<p><strong>You mention the client generating tokens. Is this process energy-intensive or storage-demanding?</strong></p>

<p>No. The generation of 500 search tokens requires approximately 1 second of computation on a consumer laptop, and is performed in the background when installing the extension. A few extra seconds may be required due to the time required to contact the server and get a response. Each token consists of 216 bytes, for a total of approximately 100 KiB of storage per token generation request.</p>

<p><strong>Is there a potential impact on the speed of search when using Privacy Pass?</strong></p>

<p>The initial generation of tokens takes about ~1 second for 500 tokens, plus the time required for contacting the server. This occurs infrequently and is done in the background when possible.</p>

<p>Currently, the token validation servers are only deployed in our us-central1 region, we plan to expand this shortly after launch.</p>

<p><strong>How many tokens am I able to generate?</strong></p>

<p>You can generate 2,000 tokens in one “epoch” (= one month). This should be enough for most users. If you need more than this, you can request additional tokens by contacting support@kagi.com.</p>

<p><strong>Do you plan to allow purchasing privacy pass tokens without having an account?</strong></p>

<p>Yes, this makes sense. Let us know <a href="https://kagifeedback.org/d/6163-kagi-privacy-pass">here</a> if you are excited about this, as it will help prioritize it.</p>

<p><strong>How can I submit feedback for Kagi Privacy Pass?</strong></p>

<p>We have a feedback thread open <a href="https://kagifeedback.org/d/6163-kagi-privacy-pass">here</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Even if the extension implements anti-fingerprinting measures, Kagi will still be able to see my IP address, correct?</strong></p>

<p>Even with Privacy Pass authentication enabled, due to the way the TCP/IP stack works, we will be able to see your search request come from an IP address. As outlined in our <a href="https://kagi.com/privacy">Privacy Policy</a>, your privacy is our priority, whether you are using Privacy Pass to authenticate or otherwise. If you are worried about us seeing your IP address, our suggestion is to connect to Kagi via Tor or through a VPN service you trust.</p>

<p><strong>How can Privacy Pass increase my privacy, if I have to send a session cookie to authenticate during token generation?</strong></p>

<p>While token generation is indeed not anonymous, Privacy Pass provides you with anonymity <em>during search</em>.</p>

<p>By providing the server with a Privacy Pass token instead of a session cookie when searching, you will guarantee that your searches cannot be <em>linked</em> to any specific user account that generated Privacy Pass tokens, or to each other.</p>

<p>From the point of view of the server, your search query could have come from any of the users who previously generated Privacy Pass tokens.</p>

<p>The more users do so, the lower the probability that the server can guess it was you specifically who made a given search query.</p>

<p><strong>Token generation does not work in my Chrome/Firefox private window</strong></p>

<p>Correct, we need to authenticate you to create tokens (see above), and in the private window, the extension does not have access to your session cookie. Please use a normal browsing window while logged in to Kagi to generate tokens.</p>

<p>Note, generating tokens while in a private window will work in the <a href="https://kagi.com/orion">Orion browser</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Can I use Kagi Assistant while using Privacy Pass?</strong></p>

<p>Not at this time, since Kagi Assistant is only available to Ultimate members. In Privacy Pass, we don’t have any account information, so we can’t validate what plan you’re on. We could issue tokens attached to different keys for different plans, but that also has privacy implications, see the discussion of personalization below.</p>

<p><strong>What Kagi services will be compatible with Privacy Pass at launch?</strong></p>

<p>At launch, Privacy Pass will only be used to authenticate Kagi Search. Soon to follow (in the next few weeks), we plan to expand support for Kagi Privacy Pass to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Kagi Assistant</li>
<li>Kagi Translate and Kagi Maps</li>
<li>Kagi universal Summarizer and Ask questions about page</li>
</ul>

<p>Please disable Privacy pass to access these services for now.</p>

<p><strong>Since initial token generation happens in batches and the tokens expire, could tokens with similar expiration dates potentially be used to identify multiple searches from the same user?</strong></p>

<p>All tokens generated during month X expire at midnight of the first day of month X+2, to avoid this exact issue. Meaning a freshly generated token lasts until the end of the month following its generation (generate today, use all of Feb and March).</p>

<p><strong>If Kagi cannot track who exactly is performing search queries, will I have access to my account settings including customization and personalization?</strong></p>

<p>Since Kagi will not know who you are, we will not be able to serve you content tailored to your custom settings via Privacy Pass-protected search.</p>

<p>We have considered allowing users to send a small configuration with every request <code>(language, region, safe-search)</code> to automatically customize your search experience to some extent. However, we currently believe this would quickly result in a significant loss of anonymity for you and for other users. To illustrate this, we have examined the most common configurations of <code>(language, region, search-safe)</code> used on Kagi.com, and extrapolated how many Privacy Pass users would share them. Looking at the top 35 configurations, we see the following approximate numbers.</p>

<p>This would mean that someone sending us <code>Lang 10</code> as their language configuration would automatically lose redemption-redemption unlinkability guarantees if approximately 1000 Kagi users used Privacy Pass.</p>

<p>While our extrapolation may be overly conservative, we won’t be enabling this level of “default” customization for users authenticating via Privacy Pass for the time being. We could reconsider if we find a better solution.</p>

<p>For manual search settings customization, you can always use bangs in your search query to enable basic settings for a specific query. For example, <a href="https://help.kagi.com/kagi/features/bangs.html#regional-bangs">regional bangs</a> will let you focus your query on one region. For example prefixing your search with <code>!de</code> will automatically search in the German region.</p>

<p>To access a fully customized search experience, you can always use the traditional login method and disable the use of Privacy Pass.</p>

<p><strong>Will Safari be supported?</strong></p>

<p>The Safari extensions API doesn’t support (as far as we know) removing cookies from requests, which means it will always authenticate with your logged-in account. We’re not aware of a way to change this. The alternative if you want a similar, native, WebKit-based browsing experience, is to use the <a href="https://kagi.com/orion">Orion Browser</a> which has Kagi Privacy Pass natively integrated.</p>

Traditional CAPTCHAs help block bots, but often involve improving proprietary maps and software, while exposing user information to third-party CAPTCHA providers. OpenStreetMap (OSM) has many objects remaining to be mapped, but the quality of AI-generated objects is not high enough for direct inclusion. We introduce “MapTCHA”, a CAPTCHA that leverages the uncertainty of interpreting imagery with computer vision, and provides human verification for AI predictions: users are asked to identify images containing correctly interpreted objects, e.g. building outlines.</p>
<p>We separate known positive cases, where both the AI prediction and OSM contain an object, from unknown cases, where objects are only in the prediction. We also generate known negatives from areas where objects are neither in OSM nor in the prediction. We show a mix of these images without telling the user which are which. Humans are validated by confirming the known positives and negatives, and we determine the truth of the unknown images by aggregating users’ responses through voting. When the voting indicates high confidence that an object exists, we suggest the location for OSM mapping.</p>
<p>Our prototype identifies buildings using aerial imagery with high enough resolution to visualise individual buildings and medium-sized objects. Image recognition is provided by fAIr, an open-source AI-assisted mapping system developed by the Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team (HOT). It allows the training and fine-tuning of pre-trained machine learning models to segment building footprints.</p>
<p>Future plans include expanding to more objects and types of imagery; refining AI models; integrating MapTCHA into various login systems; and enhancing the user interface.</p>
<p>In this session we will talk about how we are building this solution, how it might enhance mapping efforts in OSM that will support projects on the ground, and some of the challenges of working with AI derived data.</p></div>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="maincontent"><p><span>T</span>wo years ago, Robby Martin got an unsettling call from his father, Jackie. The 82-year-old told his son that a representative of the insurance giant UnitedHealth Group had barged into his nursing home room at 2.30 in the morning, announcing that he was going to be checked out at the end of the week.</p><p>Jackie Martin – who had been getting rehab at the nursing home after suffering a back fracture – still could not take more than a few steps without being out of breath.</p><p>But Jackie’s care there, which had started two weeks earlier, was eating into UnitedHealth’s bottom line.</p><div><p>The retired paper plant foreman was enrolled in UnitedHealth’s Medicare Advantage program, a federal privatization initiative that offers insurers a lump sum to cover services <a href="https://www.medicare.gov/basics/get-started-with-medicare/get-more-coverage/your-coverage-options/compare-original-medicare-medicare-advantage" data-link-name="in body link">comparable</a> to those under traditional Medicare. But the program’s pay structure means that the more care insurers deny, the more in taxpayer dollars they get to keep for themselves. </p><p>
  Now, UnitedHealth was pushing to terminate the 82-year-old’s rehab coverage.</p></div><p>Jackie and his son appealed UnitedHealth’s decision and won. But the corporate giant issued another coverage termination letter the following week, then another one the week after that.</p><p>Martin was a quiet man who didn’t like conflict. The repeated denials left him exhausted.</p><p>“We talked and he said, ‘You know, I’m tired of this process every week. Let me just go home and see how I do,’” Robby recalled.</p><p>Soon after returning home, Jackie told his family he was no longer getting better and needed to find another care option. The next day – five days after UnitedHealth had cut off his nursing home coverage – he died alone in his bathroom.</p><hr><p><em><strong>Send us a tip</strong></em></p><p><em>If you are a current or former United Healthcare or Optum employee and have information you’d like to share securely with the Guardian about nursing home care, please use a non-work device to call or text investigative reporter George Joseph via the <a href="https://signal.org/" data-link-name="in body link">Signal messaging app</a> at 929-486-4865.</em></p><hr><p><span>J</span>ackie’s battle with UnitedHealth during the final days of his life is now part of a lawsuit accusing the healthcare conglomerate of wrongfully denying elderly patients care owed to them under Medicare Advantage.

But in a statement, Optum said its “number one priority is ensuring patients receive the care they need”.</p><p>“We believe this lawsuit has no merit and should be dismissed, as we have asked the court to do,” the statement declared, arguing that the company’s coverage decisions “are made by medical directors in accordance with Medicare coverage criteria for Medicare Advantage Plans ”.</p><p>Martin’s struggle to access care after a hospital visit is not a rare occurrence for older people enrolled in UnitedHealth’s Medicare Advantage program.</p><div><p>In recent years, UnitedHealth has ramped up its efforts to deny care for older patients following strokes, falls and injuries that require rehab, according to an October 2024 <a href="https://www.hsgac.senate.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024.10.17-PSI-Majority-Staff-Report-on-Medicare-Advantage.pdf" data-link-name="in body link">investigation</a> by the US Senate permanent subcommittee on investigations. The federal inquiry found that UnitedHealth’s prior authorization denial rate for post-acute care for older people on Medicare Advantage shot up from 8.7% in 2019 to 22.7% in 2022. For Medicare Advantage seniors seeking post-acute care in nursing homes specifically, UnitedHealth’s denial rate jumped up dramatically during that period, from 1.4% to 12.6%, amounting to more than 34,000 denials.</p><p>
  In a statement, the spokesperson for UnitedHealth’s subsidiary said the Senate committee investigation “mischaracterizes” Medicare Advantage and the company’s clinical practices while ignoring federal criteria “demanding greater scrutiny around post-acute care”.</p></div><p>The corporate spokesperson also added that the company “ultimately” pays “98% of all claims” it receives, when they are submitted in “a timely manner with complete, non-duplicate information”.</p><div><p>UnitedHealth’s past coverage denials caught renewed attention after the December killing of Brian Thompson, a top executive who <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/04/health/brian-thompson-unitedhealthcare.html" data-link-name="in body link">helped establish</a> one of its subsidiaries as the <a href="https://www.kff.org/medicare/issue-brief/medicare-advantage-in-2024-enrollment-update-and-key-trends/" data-link-name="in body link">dominant player</a> in the Medicare Advantage market. </p><p>
  Weeks before Thompson’s killing, Biden administration officials at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/d/2024-27939/p-2" data-link-name="in body link">proposed new rules</a> to crack down on what it described as the “inappropriate” use of prior authorization by Medicare Advantage insurers.

 In a statement, the Democratic senator Richard Blumenthal, the investigations committee’s former chair, said older Americans like Jackie Martin “should receive the care they need” without delays or denials.</p></div><p>“For Jackie, his family, and the countless other Medicare Advantage enrollees, we must fight denials of post-acute care,” Blumenthal said. “I will continue to speak out and hold private insurers accountable for putting profits over people.”</p><h2 id="the-process">The process</h2><p>Before he suffered a fall on the hardwood floor of his kitchen that left him with a back fracture, Jackie Martin walked two to three miles a day and ran on the treadmill at his local Y in Kingsport, Tennessee.</p><div><p>Jackie’s subsequent recovery in the nursing home was slow, but he was making progress. So when Robby heard his father’s rehab coverage was being cut off, he started calling everyone he could.</p><p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
    <p>Some of my favorite internet people sometimes organize little community experiments. Like, let’s eat <a href="https://slimemoldtimemold.com/2022/04/29/potato-diet-community-trial-sign-up-now-lol/">potatoes</a> and see if we lose weight. Or, let’s take some supplements and see if <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2018/10/11/anxiety-sampler-kits/">anxiety</a> goes down. I’ve toyed with doing one myself, to see if <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theanine">theanine</a> (a chemical in tea) really helps with stress.</p>

<p>But sometimes, when everyone is having fun, some very mean very bad people show up and say, “HEY! YOU CAN’T DO THAT! THAT’S HUMAN SUBJECTS RESEARCH! YOU NEED TO GET APPROVAL FROM AN INSTITUTIONAL REVIEW BOARD!”</p>

<p>So I wondered—is that right? Who <em>exactly</em> actually needs to get approval from an institutional review board (IRB)? More than a year later, I’m now convinced that:</p>

<ol>
  <li>No single source on the internet actually answers that question.</li>
  <li>The answer is absurdly complex.</li>
  <li>The reason it’s so complex is that IRB rules are an illegible mishmash of things, some of which <em>themselves</em> have near-fractal complexity.</li>
  <li>If you stare at this long enough, it’s impossible not to question the degree to which we actually have “laws”.</li>
</ol>

<p>In this post, I’ll give the answer and then explain—in maddening detail—why I think that answer is right. But first I want to tell a little story.</p>

<p>I used to live in an apartment with an extremely steep driveway. When I had visitors, I’d tell them, “At the bottom of the driveway you must slow to ⅒ of normal speed or your car will scrape the ground. I tell this to everyone and they only slow to ½ of normal speed and scrape their car on the ground. Don’t do that!” Then they’d only slow to ½ of normal speed and scrape their car on the ground.</p>

<p>Why? I think because my visitors simply couldn’t believe my driveway was as stupid as it was. When I explained the rules of safe driveway usage, they mentally substituted the closest version of those rules that would be correct in a sane universe, one without driveways that form sudden 30° angles with the road. I suspect this is a general cognitive bias.</p>

<p>So, who exactly needs IRB approval?  Here are some myths:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Myth:</strong> IRB approval is only needed for medical research.</li>
  <li><strong>Myth:</strong> IRB approval is only needed for federally funded research.</li>
  <li><strong>Myth:</strong> IRB approval is only needed for research at “institutions”.</li>
  <li><strong>Myth:</strong> IRB approval is only needed if you want to publish in a journal.</li>
</ul>

<p>Wrong. But this is also a myth:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Myth:</strong> IRB approval is needed for all research involving human subjects.</li>
</ul>

<p>Also wrong. As far as I can tell, after months of research, here is how it works:</p>

<p><a href="https://dynomight.net/img/irb/irb.pdf"><img src="https://dynomight.net/img/irb/irb.svg" alt="irb chart"></a></p>

<p>Now, I know what you’re thinking: “That can’t be right! The government can’t possibly claim to regulate what me and my roommates eat at home! That would be stupid!” Yes, it <em>would</em> be stupid. But who says the world makes sense?</p>

<p>Now, would you actually be <em>prosecuted</em> for violating those rules? Unlikely. If a prosecutor went after you and you fought them in court, you might even be able to get some of these rules declared unconstitutional. But those are the rules as written.</p>

<p><em>Caution</em>: I estimate a 85% chance that this post contains at least one minor error and a 40% chance of a significant error. I’ve gone to insane lengths to try to get things right—I regret ever becoming interested in this topic—but this stuff is insanely convoluted. Past experience says that someone reading this knows much better than I do. If that’s you, let me know about any errors.</p>

<h2 id="reminder-of-how-law-works-in-the-us">Reminder of how law works in the US</h2>

<p>If you’re a sane person, and you want to know when IRB approval is needed, you might think something like, “I know! I’ll go find the IRB law and read it. Then I’ll know what’s legal and what isn’t. Yay!”</p>

<p>Hahaha, no. This won’t work, for several reasons.</p>

<p>For one, few federal rules actually come from <em>laws</em>. Usually politicians pass some broad law that says, “Human research is hereby regulated, details to come!” And then government employees write <em>regulations</em> that contain all the details, and those regulations have the power of law. And then the government employees issue “clarifications” that supposedly don’t change anything, but everyone treats like new laws.</p>

<p>Also, the US constitution theoretically imposes severe limits on the power of the federal government. <a href="https://constitution.congress.gov/browse/article-1/section-8/">Article 1 section 8</a> says the federal government has the power to (1) tax and spend, (2) regulate commerce, (3) control citizenship, (4) create post offices, (5) protect IP, (6) make treaties and (7) do war. And the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution">10th amendment</a> says that’s <em>it</em>: everything else is left to the states.</p>

<p>The federal government doesn’t like those limits, so it evades them in various ways. The classic trick is to declare that everything is related to commerce and therefore almost anything can be considered “regulating commerce”. For example, it’s OK to make growing and eating wheat on your own property illegal, because <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wickard_v._Filburn">growing and eating wheat is “commerce”</a>. Another trick is to write rules that sort of say, “If your state/organization wants back any of the money it’s paying in taxes, then you must create and enforce the following rules: […]”. For example, in 1984, the US government decreed that all states must raise the legal age to buy alcohol to 21 or they would <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Minimum_Drinking_Age_Act">lose federal funding for highways</a>.</p>

<p>Finally, the limits of federal power are only clarified when someone fights them in court. Did you know that at some point, bureaucrats decided that your boss must <a href="https://dynomight.net/2021/01/15/eeo/">guess your race and report it to the government</a>? Is that an illegal overreach? Is it “regulating commerce” to make personal consumption of cannabis illegal in states that have legalized it? The way you find out is you break the rules, get prosecuted, and spend millions fighting in court. (For cannabis, the answer is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gonzales_v._Raich">yes</a>, that <em>is</em> regulating commerce.) If you win, OK, no refunds on your legal fees. If you lose, you pay massive fines or go to prison. Also, courts have constantly changing judges and opinions.</p>

<p>So what happens in practice is politicians write a vague law. Bureaucrats turn that law into very detailed (but often still vague) specific rules. Those rules might or might not be “legal”, but nobody want to risk fighting them in court. If the regulations are particularly ridiculous or likely to be overturned if challenged, prosecutors may quietly stop bringing cases. But the regulations still sit there on the books. And people still usually pay attention to them, because why risk it?</p>

<p>OK! Where do IRB regulations come from?</p>

<h2 id="the-common-rule">The Common Rule</h2>

<p>In 1932, the United States government and Tuskegee University began studying 600 poor black sharecroppers in Macon Country Alabama, ⅔ of whom had latent syphilis. The idea was to observe the progression of the disease if left untreated. By the late 1940s, syphilis was easily treatable with penicillin, but the men were never informed of their condition, never treated, and were even given fake treatments and diagnoses.</p>

<p>In 1965, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Buxtun">Peter Buxton</a> joined the Public Health service and soon learned of the experiment. He was horrified and filed several official protests, but all were all rejected. Finally, in 1972, Buxton leaked the details to Jean Heller of the Associated Press which led to this <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1972/07/26/archives/syphilis-victims-in-us-study-went-untreated-for-40-years-syphilis.html">front-page article</a> on July 26, 1972.</p>

<p><img src="https://dynomight.net/img/irb/NYT.jpg" alt="NYT article"></p>

<p>The led to widespread outrage and cancellation of the study. By this time, dozens of the men had died from syphilis and many of their wives and children had also become infected.</p>

<p>It also led, in early 1973, a series of congressional hearings led by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Kennedy">Ted Kennedy</a> of Massachusetts. These hearings eventually produced the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Research_Act">National Research Act</a>. Several people voted for <a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/93-1973/s382">the first version</a> of this bill and then against the <a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/93-1974/s865">second version</a>, including one Joseph Biden of Delaware, though I can’t find any record of why. Anyway, it was signed into law by Richard Nixon on July 12, 1974.</p>

<p>Formally speaking, the National Research Act did was to create a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Commission_for_the_Protection_of_Human_Subjects_of_Biomedical_and_Behavioral_Research">commission</a>  to develop guidelines for ethical research in human subjects, including how IRBs should work. But in reality, it also sent a message that federal agencies should use their <em>existing</em> authority to regulate research. Even before the Act was passed, the Department of Health and Human Services had started <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-1974-05-30/pdf/FR-1974-05-30.pdf#page=70">amending</a> the federal code to regulate human research. In 1978, the commission issued a <a href="https://videocast.nih.gov/pdf/ohrp_institutional_review_boards.pdf">report</a> on IRBs:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Commission believes that the rights of subjects should be protected by local review committees operating pursuant to federal regulations and located in institutions where research involving human subjects is conducted.</p>

  <p>[…]</p>

  <p>The Commission further believes that institutions receiving federal support for the conduct of research involving human subjects should be governed by uniform federal regulations applicable to the review of all such research, whether it is supported by one federal department or another, or is not federally supported.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Informed by this report, lots of different agencies issued different regulations. This continued until 1991, when 15 federal agencies harmonized on what is known as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Rule">Common Rule</a>, because it is “common” to different federal agencies. This is now codified as <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/regulations-and-policy/regulations/45-cfr-46/index.html">Title 45 Part 46</a> of the federal code.</p>

<p>Since 1991, this has been continuously updated and various other agencies have joined, notably the department of Labor. There are still a couple holdouts including the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, the National Endowment for the Humanities. The CIA is an odd case—they never issued any formal regulations, but supposedly apply the Common Rule because of a cryptic <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/executive-order/12333">executive order</a> from 1981. The FDA hasn’t joined because they have their own regulatory structure.</p>

<p>So what does the Common Rule say? In principle, you can go <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-45/subtitle-A/subchapter-A/part-46">here</a> and read it. Good luck with that. It’s exactly as readable as “a series of regulations amended by many agencies over many decades” <em>sounds</em> like it would be. But basically (1) It requires informed consent. (2) It requires that risks are reasonable in relation to expected benefits, <em>not</em> including any long-range benefits from new knowledge. (3) It requires participants are selected fairly and equitably (e.g. not all poor black sharecroppers) Finally, (4) It requires that federally funded research with human subjects is reviewed by an IRB.</p>

<p>Now, that might sound simple, but what exactly is “research”? This is defined by <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-45/part-46#p-46.102(l)">45 CFR 46.102(l)</a> to be a “systematic investigation designed to develop or contribute to generalizable knowledge.” It’s best to understand this with an example. Say you’re a teacher and you want to test if the cognitive bias of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anchoring_effect">anchoring</a> applies to your class. Is this research? If you’re doing it as part of normal “teaching stuff”, to demonstrate the effect to your students, then no. But if you’re doing it in hope of <em>learning</em> if the anchoring bias is real, then that <em>is</em> research. To some degree, the truth lies in your heart.</p>

<p>(The definition of a “human subject” is also somewhat convoluted: What if you’re using data someone else gathered? What if you’re just using some human tissue samples or nonviable human embryos? But never mind.)</p>

<p>Note that this applies to <em>all</em> research. The people who made these rules were almost all medical researchers thinking about serious medical risks. But they wrote the rules to apply to <em>all</em> research, including research where you might just ask people some questions.</p>

<p>There are some narrow categories of research that are “exempt” from IRB review, e.g. research on <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/on/2018-07-19/title-45/part-46#p-46.104(d)(1)">standard educational methods</a> or <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/on/2018-07-19/title-45/part-46#p-46.104(d)(6)">food taste evaluations</a>, or certain <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/on/2018-07-19/title-45/part-46#p-46.104(d)(3)">benign behavioral interventions</a> . Theoretically, an institution <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/regulations-and-policy/guidance/faq/exempt-research-determination/index.html#4109">could</a> allow investigators to decide for themselves if they are exempt, but this is not recommended, and in practice, essentially all institutions require you to apply for a determination of exemption. In reality, <em>no</em> research is really exempt, it’s just that certain categories of research have a somewhat more lightweight application process. To get a feel for how much friction this adds, here’s <a href="https://hrpp.umich.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2024/10/brief_protocol_for_exempt_research_projects_5.15.2020_4.docx">U. Michigan’s application for exemption</a>.</p>

<p>Up until the 1990s, IRBs at universities tended to be staffed with faculty “volunteers”. These were sympathetic to the needs of their colleagues, had little interest in reading (unreadable) federal regulations, and probably just wanted to get back to teaching and research. So IRBs were often pretty loose. But in 1996, Hoiyan Wan died after taking part of an experiment on the effects of smoking and air pollution the University of Rochester. And in 1999, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesse_Gelsinger">Jesse Gelsinger</a> died after taking an experimental gene therapy at the University Of Pennsylvania. Federal agencies cracked down and sent out hundreds of enforcement letters. Universities nervously responded with “hypercompliance”, leading to IRB process everyone loves today.</p>

<h2 id="why-is-the-common-rule-so-common">Why is the Common Rule so common?</h2>

<p>The 1978 commission recommended that any institution accepting federal funding must apply IRB rules to all research, regardless of funding source. But the written regulations did not follow that recommendation. Theoretically, a university could accept federal funding for some research and still allow other research on human subjects without any IRB approval. But in practice, no university ever does that. Why?</p>

<p>Well, before giving any federal funding to an institution, the government requires the institution to file a “<a href="https://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/register-irbs-and-obtain-fwas/forms/fwa-instructions/index.html">Federalwise Assurance</a>”. In this, the institution must promise to obey some “statement of ethical principles”. Supposedly this could be anything, but it appears that the only correct answer is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belmont_Report">“The Belmont Report”</a>, an ethics statement issued by the same commission from 1978. Then there is a section where the institution may “optionally” promise to apply the common rule to all research, regardless of funding source.</p>

<p>The government has a <a href="https://ohrp.cit.nih.gov/search/fwasearch.aspx?">database</a> of these “assurances”, but you can’t actually read them. Still, I found that a few prominent institutions that had published theirs. They <em>all</em> promised to abide by the Belmont report. Some (<a href="https://www.nyu.edu/content/dam/nyu/research/documents/IRB/FWA.pdf">NYU</a>, <a href="https://research.uci.edu/wp-content/uploads/1-Institutional-Oversight-of-Assurance.pdf">U. C. Irvine</a>) promised to apply the Common Rule to all research, but most (<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/documents/mayo-clinic-federalwide-assurance/doc-20144006">Mayo Clinic</a>, <a href="https://irb.ufl.edu/wp-content/uploads/University-of-Florida-FWA-Exp.-07-06-2028.pdf">U. Florida</a>, <a href="https://irb.emory.edu/_includes/documents/sections/fwa-latest-copy.pdf">Emory</a>, <a href="https://research-compliance.umich.edu/sites/default/files/resource-download/um-fwa.pdf">U. Michigan</a>, <a href="https://ras.mit.edu/document/federalwide-assurance-protection-human-subjects">MIT</a>) do not.</p>

<p>So if you’re a researcher at MIT, can you do non-federally funded research without an IRB? Nope. <a href="https://couhes.mit.edu/researchers/frequently-asked-questions">MIT rules</a> still say you need an IRB for <em>all</em> research with human subjects.  So do the <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/documents/1-inst-commitment-and-authoritypdf/doc-10027286">Mayo Clinic’s</a>. So do <a href="https://irb.ufl.edu/">U. Florida’s rules</a>. So do <a href="https://irb.emory.edu/_includes/documents/sections/pyramid-guidance.pdf">Emory’s rules</a>. So do <a href="https://hrpp.umich.edu/irb-health-sciences-and-behavioral-sciences-hsbs/irb-review-process/">U. Michigan’s rules</a>.</p>

<p>What’s going on here? Throughout the 1970s, there was a debate about if IRB rules should apply to social science at all. The <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/index.html">OHRP</a> (which oversees the Common Rule) gradually asserted <a href="https://willyreads.substack.com/p/ethical-imperialism-irbs-and-the">more and more broad IRB requirements</a>. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ithiel_de_Sola_Pool">Ithiel de Sola Pool</a>, a professor at MIT, protested this growing power. Apparently, a colleague had sought IRB approval to interview Boston anti-busing activists, and been rejected because this research could be used against them. Pool <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/3556121">argued</a> that much of social science should be exempt and got support from professional societies.</p>

<p>But no matter. Here’s Charles McCarthy, director of the OHRP from 1977 to 1993, bragging about subverting the Carter and the Reagan administrations to add more regulations during the transition in 1980:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>But we were trying to decide when is the appropriate time to get the Secretary to sign off on the new regulations?&nbsp; They had already been proposed, we had got comments from the public.&nbsp; We’d incorporated the comments.&nbsp; We wrote the preamble, it was ready to go.&nbsp; And then when is the best time, ‘cause Harris could care less whether they every got published.&nbsp; So we talked to the transition team, and they said Reagan will never allow new regulations to see the light of day, so if you’re going to get those out at all, you’d better get them out before he takes over.</p>

  <p>So we’re struggling with this problem, and the way we worked it out was that’s when we wrote, overnight one night–brilliant inspiration–we wrote–everybody stayed in the office, and we worked all night long, and we wrote the exemptions to the regulations, and we also wrote expedited review neither of which had ever been addressed by the Commission.&nbsp; And that’s where they came from.</p>

  <p>Then we went to the transition team, and we said would the transition team endorse regulations that are less stringent than the previous regulations?&nbsp; And, of course, they weren’t, but they looked like they were because we wrote some exceptions.&nbsp; And so when we sent the package down to Harris, we said “Diminished Regulations for the Protection of Human Subjects.”&nbsp; And that was the title.&nbsp; And, of course, we knew nobody down there in the last weeks of the Harris administration getting ready to leave office would actually read it.&nbsp; So they didn’t know what all that was about, but they could read the title.</p>

  <p>And so Secretary Harris signed that at her farewell party.&nbsp; She put down her glass of champagne and signed the regulations on January 19, 1980, and went out of office on the 20th.&nbsp; So we squeaked by.&nbsp; Those were some of the adventures we had that were kind of harrowing for regulators, and that’s why some of the language in those exemptions is so convoluted because it was really a first draft.&nbsp; But it survived and it’s still in there.&nbsp; And it makes some sense, but if we could rewrite the regulations, we would run that through three or four more drafts and make them crystal clear.&nbsp; They’re less than elegant writing, whereas if you read the rest of the regulation, I think you’ll find sub-part A is very well-written if you leave out the part about the exemptions.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That’s a real quote that you can go read on the <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/education-and-outreach/luminaries-lecture-series/belmont-report-25th-anniversary-interview-cmccarthy/index.html#:~:text=But%20we%20were%20trying"><code>hhs.gov</code> website</a> today.</p>

<p>The OHRP sent out “non-binding guidance” that suggested all research should be subject to IRB review. According to <a href="https://scholarship.law.columbia.edu/faculty_scholarship/487/">Hamburger (2007)</a> in the 1990s, the Federalwise Assurance form implied that institutions <em>had</em> to apply the Common Rule to all research, despite the fact that no federal regulation to this effect existed. I can’t find the old form, but according to “persons who were in a position to know”, at one point all but about five institutions in the entire country had made this promise.</p>

<p>By 2000-2005, the form made clear that promising to apply the Common Rule (and thus IRBs) to non federally-funded research was optional, and many institutions decline to do this. But they are only declining <em>to make this assurance</em>. Apparently, after years of applying the Common Rule to all research, it had risen to legally qualify as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_of_care">“standard of care”</a>, meaning that anyone that failed to apply it risked being legally <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negligence">“negligent “</a> under state law. So, having established the Common Rule as standard through questionably legal tactics, the government could now relax and rely on state tort laws.</p>

<p>Now, say you’re affiliated with a university. Federal funded research without IRB approval is out. <em>Any</em> research at the university is out. But say you want to do research in your spare time, at home, without using any university resources. Is that OK?</p>

<p>Policies here seem to vary. Some are clear that this is <em>not</em> OK. <a href="https://irb.ucsf.edu/research-needing-irb-review#who">U.C. San Francisco</a> says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>UCSF faculty, staff,&nbsp;or students or researchers at UCSF-affiliated institutions conducting human subjects research require IRB approval before initiating the study. IRB approval is required <strong>regardless of the site of the study or the source of funding</strong> (if there is funding).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Others are a bit ambiguous. <a href="https://couhes.mit.edu/researchers/frequently-asked-questions#who_apply">MIT</a> says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Any faculty member, employee or student at MIT who conducts human subjects research must apply [to the IRB] if the research involves any form of MIT involvement or support, including funding, <strong>personnel</strong>, facilities, academic credit or access to experimental subjects.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But how could a MIT <em>employee</em> do research without involving MIT <em>personnel</em>, when they themselves are personnel? The closest I can find to anyone saying it’s OK to do independent research without an IRB is <a href="https://research.columbia.edu/sites/default/files/content/HRPO/IRB_SOP_v5.2_2.12.19_TOC_CUIMC.176a.9.12.19.pdf">Columbia University</a> which says an IRB is needed if:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>the research is conducted by or under the direction of any employee or agent (faculty/student/staff) of Columbia, in connection with his or her institutional responsibilities</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What exactly constitutes a “connection”? I guess you get to argue about the meaning of that term if/when you’re investigated for research misconduct.</p>

<h2 id="journals">Journals</h2>

<p>OK! So if you’re doing any research at any federally funded institution, you need an IRB. If you work at such an institution, you could <em>maybe</em> do research at home, as long as it’s unrelated to your job and you’re willing to live dangerously.</p>

<p>But suppose you’re not affiliated with any institution. Can you do research without an IRB?</p>

<p>One additional barrier is that if you want to <em>publish</em> your results in a journal, almost all journals that publish human subjects research require IRB approval. For example, all <a href="https://www.nature.com/nature-portfolio/editorial-policies/ethics-and-biosecurity#:~:text=identify%20the%20ethics">Nature journals</a>, <a href="https://www.springer.com/gp/authors-editors/journal-author/journal-author-helpdesk/before-you-start#:~:text=reference%20number">Springer journals</a> , and <a href="https://authorservices.taylorandfrancis.com/editorial-policies/research-ethics-guidelines-for-stem-journals/#:~:text=reference">Taylor and Francis</a>  journals require you to identify the ethics committee and give a reference number. <a href="https://www.science.org/content/page/science-journals-editorial-policies#:~:text=human%20subjects%20research">Science</a> journals require IRB approval, but don’t seem to require details unless an editor requests them. (Those are publisher requirements. Specific journals can add additional restrictions.)</p>

<p>Now, I’m not sure how carefully these journals actually <em>check</em>. My impression is that some do and some don’t. Maybe you could lie and get away with it, but papers do in fact <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/category/by-reason-for-retraction/lack-of-irb-approval/">retracted</a> when a lack of IRB approval is revealed.</p>

<h2 id="state-laws">State laws</h2>

<p>Another barrier is that some states have their own laws. In 1975, <a href="https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/laws/PBH/2444">New York</a> passed a law that required IRB approval for <em>all</em> human subjects research:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Each person engaged in the conduct of human research or proposing to conduct human research shall affiliate himself with an institution or agency having a human research review committee, and such human research as he conducts or proposes to conduct shall be subject to review by such committee in the manner set forth in this section.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/title32.1/chapter5.1/section32.1-162.19/">Virginia</a> passed a very similar law in 1979. These go further than requiring IRB approval. They make independent human subjects research fully illegal! (Read that quote!) In most states, a random person could submit their research plan to an independent IRB. Not in New York or Virginia.</p>

<p>In 2002, Maryland passed <a href="https://mgaleg.maryland.gov/2002rs/billfile/hb0917.htm">house bill 917</a>. I find this text extremely confusing, but <a href="https://www.marylandattorneygeneral.gov/Pages/HealthPolicy/humansubject.aspx">everyone seems to agree</a> that that it means that all human subjects research requires IRB approval.</p>

<p>I’ve seen many people claim that California also requires IRB approval for all human subjects research. While it’s true that California has some <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displayText.xhtml?lawCode=HSC&amp;division=20.&amp;title&amp;part&amp;chapter=1.3.&amp;article">extra regulations</a>, as far as I can tell none of these require IRB approval.</p>

<h2 id="fda-regulations">FDA regulations</h2>

<p>Have you found all this to be too simple? Too straightforward and legible?</p>

<p>The FDA is here to help. They have an <em>independent</em> set of IRB regulations. While the Common Rule IRB regulations are in <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-45/subtitle-A/subchapter-A/part-46">Title 45 Part 46</a> (45 CFR 46), the FDA IRB regulations are in <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-21/chapter-I/subchapter-A/part-56">21 CFR 56</a> and also <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-21/part-50">21 CFR Part 50</a>.</p>

<p>Whereas the Common Rule derives its constitutional authority from the idea that the government can decide how it wants to give out <em>money</em>, the FDA regulations seem derive their constitutional authority from the idea that it is <em>regulating commerce</em>. So FDA regulations apply regardless of where you work or how you’ve gotten funding. The FDA operates according to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Food,_Drug,_and_Cosmetic_Act_of_1938">1938 Food, Drug, and Cosmetics Act</a> and its many amendments, most notably the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dietary_Supplement_Health_and_Education_Act_of_1994">1994 Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act</a>.</p>

<p>So what do the FDA regulations say? I found them to be much more painful to read than the (already extremely painful) Common Rule regulations. But after much thrashing and screaming, I think the core regulation is <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-21/part-56/section-56.103#p-56.103(a)">21 CFR 56.103(a)</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[…] any clinical investigation which must meet the requirements for prior submission (as required in parts <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-21/chapter-I/subchapter-D/part-312">312</a>, 812, and 813) […] shall not be initiated unless that investigation has been reviewed […] by an IRB meeting the requirements of this part.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>21 CFR § 56.103 gives a two cases where you’re exempt from the above rule, but these aren’t much help.</p>

      <p>The first (<a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-21/chapter-I/subchapter-A/part-56/subpart-A/section-56.104">21 CFR § 56.104</a>) is that you’re exempt if you meet the conditions of which basically are that (1) you started your investigation in 1981 or earlier (2) it’s an emergency and you get IRB approval within 5 days, or (3) “taste and food quality evaluations and consumer acceptance studies if wholesome foods without additives are consumed or if a food is consumed that contains a food ingredient at or below the level and for a use found to be safe”.</p>

      <p>The second (<a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-21/chapter-I/subchapter-A/part-56/subpart-A/section-56.105">21 CFR § 56.105</a>) is that you’re exempt if you apply to the FDA to be exempt and they waive the requirements. Good luck with that.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-21/part-56/section-56.103#p-56.103(b)">21 CFR § 56.103 (b)</a> says that if you apply to the FDA to get a drug approved, they may ignore your data if you should have gotten an IRB but you didn’t. But this an <em>additional</em>  thing to worry about, not a waiver to do whatever you want if you don’t care about FDA approval.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
</details>

<p>So what does this mean?</p>

<p>Well, a “clinical investigation” is defined by <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-21/part-56#p-56.102(c)">21 CFR 56.102(c)</a> to be anything involving human subjects and a “test article”. And a “test article” which is defined in turn by <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-21/part-56#p-56.102(l)">21 CFR 56.102(l)</a> to be any “drug” for human use. So if you’re doing anything with a “drug” that requires “prior submission”, then you need an IRB. What do <em>those</em> terms mean? <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-21/part-312">21 CFR Part 312</a> makes clear that “prior submission” is referring to an investigational new drug (IND) application to the FDA.</p>

<p>(Caution: An “IRB” and an “IND” are totally different things. An IRB is what this article is about. An <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Investigational_New_Drug">IND</a> is the kind of application that pharmaceutical companies make to the FDA before they can start clinical trials.)</p>

<p>So, at first, this seems like good news: As long as you don’t need to do a (gigantic, extremely expensive) IND application to the FDA before starting your research, then FDA regulations don’t force you to use an IRB. Whew! Except… When are you supposed to submit an IND? Surely that’s not some incredibly broad set of circumstances that could apply to almost anyone doing almost anything, is it?</p>

<p>Behold:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.fda.gov/media/79386/download"><img src="https://dynomight.net/img/irb/FDA.png" alt="Guidance for Clinical Investigators, Sponsors, and IRBs Investigational New Drug Applications (INDs) — Determining Whether Human Research Studies Can Be Conducted Without an IND"></a></p>

<p>This is a supposedly “nonbinding” document that just explains old rules. <em>Supposedly</em>, the FDA is just publishing this as a helpful service to all the mouth-breathers who can’t understand federal regulations. But everyone in industry behaves as if it’s a new law. Which is understandable, since the written regulations are so confusing and ambiguous.</p>

<p>If you read this guidance, you will discover that an IND is needed if:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The research involves a “drug”</li>
  <li>The research is a “clinical investigation”</li>
  <li>The research is not exempt.</li>
</ol>

<p>If you want to avoid an IND, then (2) and (3) are little help. A “clinical investigation” is <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-21/part-312/section-312.3#p-312.3(Clinical%20investigation)">defined</a> as anything where a “drug” is given to human subjects. And the exemptions are extremely narrow: They are only for <em>marketed</em> drugs where the drug is being used for the labeled purpose as directed. Testing something already approved for a disease? Not exempt. Testing if normal food helps with some new disease? Not exempt. You’re only exempt if you’re doing research on something the FDA has already accepted to be true.</p>

<details>
  <summary>
(Click here for details)
</summary>

  <p>“Do I need an IND if I use a lawfully marketed drug for an unlabeled indication?
If you are a health care provider and you prescribe a marketed drug to treat a patient for an
unlabeled indication (also referred to as off-label use), an IND is not required because this use is
considered to be within the scope of medical practice and not a clinical investigation. However,
if you use the marketed drug for the same purpose in a clinical investigation intended to evaluate
the drug’s ability to treat a disease or condition, an IND is required under part 312 unless the
clinical investigation meets the criteria for an exemption for studies of lawfully marketed drugs
(see 21 CFR 312.2(b) and section IV.A of this guidance.”</p>

  <p>“If a product containing substances generally recognized as safe (GRAS) for use in food is
administered to subjects in a study intended to evaluate the effect of the substance on the
pathogenesis of a human disease, is an IND required?
Substances designated as GRAS for use in food are generally not approved as drug products. A
clinical investigation of a GRAS substance that is intended to evaluate the product’s ability to
diagnose, cure, mitigate, treat, or prevent disease requires an IND under part 312, unless the
substance to be studied is also a lawfully marketed drug and the clinical investigation meets the
criteria for exemption under 21 CFR 312.2(b).”</p>
</details>

<p>If you want to avoid an IND, your best hope is that your research doesn’t involve a “drug”. Unfortunately, the term “drug” is defined extremely broadly, way beyond the colloquial meaning of  “drug” in English. A drug is defined to include:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>articles intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It also includes:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>articles (other than food) intended to affect the structure or any function of the body</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Get that? Here’s a little picture:</p>

<p><a href="https://dynomight.net/img/irb/drug.pdf"><img src="https://dynomight.net/img/irb/drug.svg" alt="drug chart"></a></p>

<p>Now, I know what you’re thinking. “That can’t be right! That would mean that if I wanted to study if some normal food reduced the odds of, say, diabetes, then I wouldn’t just need IRB approval, I would also need to submit a freaking <em>IND</em>! That would be stupid!”</p>

<p>But the FDA is quite clear that this <em>is</em> right:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As is the case for a dietary supplement, a food is considered to be a drug if it is “intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease,” except that a food may bear an authorized health claim about reducing the risk of a disease without becoming a drug (see section VI.D.3). Therefore, a clinical investigation intended to evaluate the effect of a food on a disease would require an IND under part 312. For example, a clinical investigation intended to evaluate the effect of a food on the signs and symptoms of Crohn’s disease would require an IND.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>FDA <a href="https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/institutional-review-boards-frequently-asked-questions#:~:text=54.">also says</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Does a physician, in private practice, conducting research with an FDA regulated product, need to obtain IRB approval?</strong></p>

  <p>Yes. The FDA regulations require IRB review and approval of regulated clinical investigations, whether or not the study involves institutionalized subjects. FDA has included non-institutionalized subjects because it is inappropriate to apply a double standard for the protection of research subjects based on whether or not they are institutionalized.</p>

  <p>An investigator should be able to obtain IRB review by submitting the research proposal to a community hospital, a university/medical school, an independent IRB, a local or state government health agency or other organizations.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>At first, I thought this couldn’t possibly be true. In 2017, it apparently cost $619,200 to submit an IND application to the FDA. However, in practice it appears that there are <a href="https://www.fda.gov/media/72340/download">many exceptions</a> and that there are <a href="https://academicentrepreneurship.pubpub.org/pub/aan4seyc/release/4">two categories</a> of INDs: Commercial and research. I assume the FDA doesn’t actually try to charge researchers $619,200 to review their research projects, but I don’t really know.</p>

<p>The FDA’s IND application page is <a href="https://www.fda.gov/drugs/investigational-new-drug-ind-application/ind-application-procedures-overview">here</a>. Have fun.</p>

<p>I’m not sure how seriously people take these FDA regulations in practice. People <em>do</em> seem to get IND approval for research on actual (chemical) drugs. But does anyone actually seek IND approval if they want to study if diet influences obesity? Do they carefully avoid talking about disease, so they can fall under the looser “structure and function of the body”? And is <em>private research</em> on <em>normal food</em> really a form of inter-state commerce? I’m just not sure.</p>

<h2 id="what-ive-learned">What I’ve learned</h2>

<p>Mostly I’ve learned that the set of abstractions I was using to think about the world were wrong. I assumed that there were “laws” that someone had written, and that someone could read to understand what is legal and what isn’t.</p>

<p>But in reality, politicians write vague laws, and then agencies write vague sprawling regulations, and then those agencies issue vague “clarifications”. Sometimes these might be unconstitutional or illegal, but no one knows unless they want to fight things in court. But courts are unpredictable, and even going to court is ruinously expensive. Trying to comply with the the written law is like trying to comply with a giant mound of potatoes.</p>

<p>So people basically operate as if the law doesn’t exist. The “law” is what the people who enforce the law choose to enforce. If you need to live in this world, that’s what you pay attention to. The law is what you can get away with.</p>

<h2 id="what-i-would-change">What I would change</h2>

<p>All the IRB rules were designed by medical doctors to regulate the research of other medical doctors, thinking about incidents like the Tuskegee syphilis study.</p>

<p>But here’s an opinion: Needing to submit an application before you can ask people to fill out some simple online survey is stupid. Needing to submit an application before you can interview a bunch of people is stupid.</p>

<p>I like incremental change, so why don’t we start by making “exempt” research <em>actually exempt</em>? For example, <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/on/2018-07-19/title-45/part-46#p-46.104(d)(3)(ii)">45 CFR 46.104(d)(3)(ii)</a> exempts “benign behavioral interventions” from IRB review. But you still need to <em>apply</em> to prove you’re exempt. Why?</p>

<p>As an analogy, driving a car is dangerous. Whenever I drive, I could easily kill someone. But the government doesn’t force me to submit a driving plan any time I want to go somewhere. Instead, if I misbehave, I am punished <em>in retrospect</em>. Why don’t we apply the same policy to research?</p>

<h2 id="notes">Notes</h2>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>I found AI to be completely useless at parsing all these federal regulations. Maybe you need AI that’s specifically trained to be good at parsing legal text?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Say I want to feed potatoes to my friends and see if that reduces diabetes. Maybe that’s dumb. Fine. But the FDA seems to be claiming that it is constitutionally permitted to regulate this because by doing this I would be engaging in “interstate commerce”. Really?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Maybe the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chevron_U.S.A.,_Inc._v._Natural_Resources_Defense_Council,_Inc."><em>Chevron</em> decision</a> might have some implications for all this?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As far as I can tell, no one has ever been prosecuted anyone for failure to comply with IRB requirements. It’s not even clear what the penalty would be. In practice, rules are enforced on <em>institutions</em>—if one failed to comply, then their “assurance” might be cancelled, meaning they couldn’t take any federal funding for research. Or, if they wanted to sell something, the FDA might refuse to approve it for sale.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Are you chaotic good? Then you may find it interesting that it seems to be relatively easy to form a new IRB. (<a href="https://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/register-irbs-and-obtain-fwas/irb-registration/irb-registration-faq/index.html">HHS rules</a> / <a href="https://www.fda.gov/media/77059/download">FDA rules</a>). And that while all federally funded institutions require IRB approval for all research, only some require approval from <em>their</em> IRB. You can probably see where this is going.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p><span>FOSDEM 2025</span> LibreOffice is a big, mature chunk of code now, but that doesn't make it impossible to teach it impressive new tricks. Some of them could make it more important than ever.</p>
<p>The open-source office suite had its own <a target="_blank" href="https://fosdem.org/2025/schedule/track/libreoffice/" rel="nofollow">program stream</a> at FOSDEM, including the <a target="_blank" href="https://fosdempwa.com/event/5735?year=2025&amp;day=null&amp;test=false" rel="nofollow">pre-announcement</a> of the new <a target="_blank" href="https://wiki.documentfoundation.org/ReleaseNotes/25.2" rel="nofollow">LibreOffice release 25.2</a>. It has been around in some form since 1985, so this version marks its 40th year. It's middle-aged and, almost inevitably, that means it's big, a bit saggy in places, it definitely has some issues, and it doesn't look as good as it did a couple of decades ago.</p>
<p>But that doesn't mean it can't be taught interesting things. Even a 40-year-old can acquire new skills and take on entirely new roles.</p>

    

<p>One of these was the&nbsp;subject of a talk by Allotropia's Thorsten Behrens, <a target="_blank" href="https://fosdem.org/2025/schedule/event/fosdem-2025-6504-distributed-real-time-collaboration-for-writer-a-first-prototype/" rel="nofollow">Distributed real-time collaboration for Writer – a first prototype</a>. This is a mode where multiple people, each with their own local copy of LibreOffice Writer running on their own machine, can all work together simultaneously on the same collaborative document. There's a little more info in his <a target="_blank" href="https://fosdem.org/2025/events/attachments/fosdem-2025-6504-distributed-real-time-collaboration-for-writer-a-first-prototype/slides/236805/fosdem_cr_zFtxHDK.pdf" rel="nofollow">slide deck</a> [PDF], which explains that this is achieved using CRDTs, or <a target="_blank" href="https://crdt.tech/" rel="nofollow">conflict-free replicated data types</a> – the same tech whose use we described in the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/07/15/zed_editor_arrives_on_linux/">Zed programmer's editor</a> last year.</p>

        


        

<p>It's the same sort of functionality that you get from Google Docs, and indeed this is already possible using the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2022/07/01/collabora_releases_code_2205_webbased/">Collabora Online web-based version of LibreOffice</a>. The big difference is that such tools run in a browser, so you need to be online. What makes the CRDT implementation different is that this is a local app, working on a local file, but using a network copy to keep changes in sync. The idea is to free you from keeping your apps and data on someone else's computer, without losing the handy collaborative features that web apps bring.</p>
<p>We also met up with Thorsten for a demo of one of his other babies, <a target="_blank" href="https://zetaoffice.net/" rel="nofollow">ZetaOffice</a>. This is a version of LibreOffice built for the Wasm runtime, which means it can run inside a browser. He demonstrated it to us on an AMD Ryzen-powered developer-spec ThinkPad, but the same binaries could run on any OS and on any CPU, such as ARM hardware. ZetaOffice went into public beta <a target="_blank" href="https://blog.allotropia.de/2024/11/08/launching-zetaoffice/" rel="nofollow">last November</a>, and a first release is looming very soon.</p>

        

<p>This is a big undertaking and it's been a long time coming. <em>The Register</em> first covered its <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2021/02/16/libreoffice_team_working_on_port/">early stages in 2021</a> and the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2022/02/19/webassembly_port_libreoffice/">first experimental build in 2022</a>. Last week, Thorsten was able to show it running happily in Firefox.</p>
<p>He showed us it running in multiple modes. You can embed any of the LibreOffice apps into a web page, complete with their normal user interface and so on, much like Google Apps. This enables a website to offer a very rich editing experience of text, spreadsheets, presentations, or anything else. ZetaOffice can also be embedded, scripted, and controlled using the <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/allotropia/zetajs" rel="nofollow">zetajs wrapper</a>, so you can call it to display embedded rich objects in web pages. We were rather taken by a demo that displayed a moving line chart of ping times to the <code>zetaoffice.net</code> website. A script was extracting the times from the ping command, adding lines to a LibreOffice Calc spreadsheet, graphing the last dozen or so lines and embedding the graph in a web page.</p>
<p>He told us that the Allotropia development team sees ZetaOffice as orthogonal to Collabora Office (or COOL for short). COOL runs in the browser and has simultaneous multiuser editing. ZetaOffice runs in the browser too, but it's perfectly able to run locally and doesn't need an uplink. For now, though, it's single user. The company will make a cross-platform version that is also available for local installation.</p>

</ul>
<p>The real power comes from the scriptability and integration with JavaScript, though. We are sure lots of people will find uses for the ability to embed any document LibreOffice can open into any web page, control and automate it from JavaScript, with the choice of a full local user interface – or none, just the content, controlled with a JavaScript UI instead. The code is all under the MIT licence, so it's all-FOSS, and all the work is being upstreamed to LibreOffice itself.</p>
<p>This is big stuff in more than one way. LibreOffice isn't lightweight anyway. Opening a document in a web page can pull in a gigabyte or so of code, and the memory footprint is a bit more than that. It is still in beta, though, and the team is working hard on modularizing the code into multiple smaller chunks so that it will load much faster and take less memory.</p>

        

<p>The potential flexibility here&nbsp;is impressive, though. You could have a portable app on a USB key that was usable on a PC or Mac or Chromebook, regardless of the OS, without installation. Web apps suddenly acquire full rich cross-platform document handling and editing, including, of course, all the main Microsoft files and formats.</p>
<p>Despite Sun's best efforts over the years – from <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2002/02/25/sun_to_charge_for_staroffice/">charging a pittance for StarOffice</a> to convince management types of its value, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2004/02/04/sun_finally_ships_staroffice/">porting it to Solaris</a>, offering <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2008/11/17/sun_staroffice_nine/">commercial support</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2010/09/28/openoffice_independence_from_oracle/">rebranding it as OpenOffice</a>, and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2015/08/06/libreoffice_50_debuts_complete_with_fewer_german_code_comments/">finally releasing LibreOffice</a> – it never managed to displace Microsoft's stranglehold on the office desktop. Maybe componentizing it and letting it run in-browser will give it a new lease of life. ®</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p>If governments want AI to improve services and security for their citizens, then they need to put all their information in one place – even citizens’ genomic data – according to Larry Ellison, the Oracle database tycoon.</p>
<p>Ellison shared his take on what governments need to do to succeed with AI during a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG2AtiInwKM" rel="nofollow">discussion</a> with <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/08/10/ellison_become_major_contributor_to/">his buddy</a> former UK prime minister Tony Blair at the World Governments Summit in Dubai today.</p>
<p>The world's fourth-most-richest man – a <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/12/23/business/elon-musk-trump-family-friends-backers.html">good friend</a> also of the world's richest man <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/02/07/opinion_column_musk/">Elon Musk</a> – insisted artificial intelligence is soon going to change everyone's lives "across the board."</p>
<blockquote>

<p>I have to tell the AI model as much about my country as I can. We need to unify all the national data</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If governments want in, they’ll need to gather all their data – spatial information, economic data, electronic healthcare records including genomic data, and info about infrastructure. Whatever they’ve got, basically. And put it all in one place to be analyzed by algorithms. The American multi-billionaire used the United States as an example, if not a goal.</p>
<p>"I have to tell [the] AI model as much about my country as I can," Ellison said. "We need to unify all the national data, put it into a database where it's easily consumable by the AI model, and then ask whatever question you like," he said. "That's the missing link."</p>

    

<p>He believes the payoff will include better healthcare, thanks to treatments tailored to individuals, and the ability for governments to lift food production by better predicting crop yields. Analyzing land so that farmers can be advised where to apply fertilizers or increase irrigation was another scenario Ellison floated.</p>

        


        

<p>"As long as countries will put their data - all of it - in a single place we can use AI to help manage the care of all of the patients and the population at large," Ellison said, adding his belief that AI can handle other social services and eliminate fraud.</p>
<p>Of course, such a vast database system could also be the precursor to pervasive surveillance – an idea Ellison last year <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/09/16/oracle_ai_mass_surveillance_cloud/">said</a> he feels is desirable and would like Oracle to help facilitate.</p>

        

<p>Constant real-time surveillance of populations, analyzed by Oracle-powered machine-learning products, would keep everyone "on their best behavior," Ellison said at an Oracle financial analyst conference in September 2024. We're reminded of the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2019/06/26/nsa_spy_program_aclu/">NSA</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2013/06/07/prism_plan_for_nsa_surveillance_of_internet_companies/">PRISM</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2014/01/24/snowden_speaks_nsa_whistleblower_calls_for_global_privacy_standards/">Snowden</a> <em>et cetera</em>.</p>
<ul>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/03/13/larry_ellison_worth_15_billion/">Oracle AI buzz means Larry Ellison's worth $15B more today</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/11/21/ai_policy_trump/">Prepare for an AI policy upending under Trump, say experts</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/09/11/oracle_1gw_datacenter_smr_plan/">Oracle wants to power 1GW datacenter with trio of tiny nuclear reactors</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/02/06/federal_court_leashes_doges_tresury_access/">Federal judge tightens DOGE leash over critical Treasury payment system access</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Ellison is not just a techno-optimist. He’s also a top executive and shareholder who has made big AI investments as well as a database company to feed.</p>
<p>He therefore told the Dubai audience that Oracle, already a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/02/08/doge_us_goverment_tech_spending/">big-time government and military contractor</a>, is ready to help nations realize his above-mentioned AI visions. Ie: Put all this data into one big expensive Oracle system to learn from and process.</p>
<p>"Oracle is building a 2.2GW datacenter that costs between $50 and $100 billion dollars to build," Ellison said, noting it's sites like that where super-powered AI models will be trained. "Because these models are so expensive, you won't build your own as a rule. There'll be a handful of these models."</p>
<p>And a handful of players that can train them. Oracle’s own facilities will likely be one. The super-corp has also joined another, the <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/01/22/openai_stargate_ai_datacenter_company">Stargate project</a>, that plans to blow $500 billion on AI infrastructure in the US in the next four years. ®</p>

These options include:</span></p><ol><li><p>TSMC setting up an advanced packaging factory in the U.S., offering a full suite of services from foundry to packaging.</p></li><li><p>TSMC joining other firms as investors in Intel Foundry Services (IFS), a division being spun off from Intel, with TSMC transferring its technology as part of its shareholder role.</p></li><li><p>Allowing Intel to handle the packaging process for TSMC's Arizona-based operations.</p></li></ol><p>However, TSMC has not disclosed its stance on any of these proposed strategies, nor has it confirmed plans to expand its Arizona site as speculated by the market. Instead, TSMC's Board of Directors approved a capital budget of approximately $17.14 billion, less than half of the $38-42 billion projected for 2025 during its earnings conference in January. TSMC said the budget will be allocated toward long-term capacity planning based on market demand and technology development, covering the construction and upgrading of advanced process capacity, packaging, and specialty processes without specifying the locations.</p><p><a href="https://tspasemiconductor.substack.com/" rel="">SemiVision</a><span> analysts told </span><em>TechSoda</em><span> that Amkor has already pilot-run Nvidia’s chip packaging processes. Therefore, any proposal requesting TSMC to hand the advanced chip packaging orders to Intel will hurt Amkor. </span></p><p>Even if TSMC agrees to transfer technology to Intel, there’s no shortcut in the manufacturing processes of semiconductors because it takes a lengthy and painful effort to finetune for yield optimization. </p><p><span>Further reports from </span><a href="https://www.tipranks.com/news/the-fly/baird-notes-supply-chain-talk-of-intel-fab-spinoff-with-tsmc-involved#google_vignette" rel="">Baird analyst Tristan Gerra</a><span> citing supply chain chatters that the U.S. government may push for TSMC to send engineers to Intel's 3nm/2nm fabs, contributing expertise to ensure that Intel’s manufacturing projects remain competitive. This news led to a 7.2% increase in Intel’s stock price after a 6% surge the day before, while TSMC’s shares fell by over 1%, with another 1.3% drop in the Taiwan Stock Exchange trading session.</span></p><p>Another possibility Baird raised is that Intel’s fab could be spun off into a joint entity owned by TSMC and Intel, with TSMC taking the helm. According to sources, the new entity could benefit from U.S. Chip Act funding.</p><p><span>This arrangement would require TSMC to prioritize U.S. interests over its own shareholders, many of whom are American. If TSMC’s executives compromise their company's interests for a local customer (which is also a foundry competitor), </span><strong>could this lead to shareholder backlash or even collective litigation</strong><span>?</span></p><p><span>On the other hand, if TSMC rejects the proposals, the U.S. government could impose a 100% tariff on chips made in Taiwan, potentially </span><a href="https://techsoda.substack.com/p/may-you-live-in-interesting-times" rel="">crippling the legacy chip manufacturers in Taiwan</a><span> and forcing many of them to surrender their American market share to competitors such as those from China.

It is expected that by the end of 2027, 4/3nm monthly production capacity of about 50,000 wafers, 2nm production will begin in 2028, and the third plant is expected to produce 2nm or below advanced process technology before 2030.</p><p>There is still room for three extra facilities at the TSMC Arizona site.</p></div></div>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/iridium-satellite">https://spectrum.ieee.org/iridium-satellite</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43037623">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-headline="White Hat Hackers Expose Iridium Satellite Security Flaws"><p><span>In a recent demonstration, German white hat <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/hackers">hackers</a> showed how to intercept text messages sent via the U.S. satellite communication system <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/iridium">Iridium</a> and locate users with an accuracy of about 4 kilometers.</span></p><p>The two<strong></strong>hackers, known publicly only under the nicknames Sec and Schneider, made the revelations during a presentation at the <a href="https://events.ccc.de/congress/2024/infos/index.html" target="_blank">Chaos Communication Congress</a> in late December in Hamburg, <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/germany">Germany</a>. During the talk, they highlighted severe vulnerabilities in services that tens of thousands of users from the U.S. <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/department-of-defense">Department of Defense</a> rely on.</p><p>Although the DoD uses a secure gateway to route and encrypt its traffic, the hackers were able to see which devices were connecting via the DoD pathway. That allowed the duo to identify and locate DoD users with an accuracy of about 4 km using a home-assembled eavesdropping kit consisting of a commercially available Iridium antenna, a <a data-linked-post="2658479890" href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/passive-radar-with-sdr" target="_blank">software-defined radio</a> receiver and a basic computer, such as the <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/intel">Intel</a> N100 mobile <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/cpu">CPU</a> or the <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/raspberry-pi">Raspberry Pi</a> mini-computer. </p><p>“We see devices that register with the DoD service center and then we can find their positions from these registrations,” Sec said during the talk. “You don’t have to see the communication from the actual phone to the network, you just see the network’s answer with the position, and you then can map where all the registered devices are.”</p><h2>Iridium’s Legacy Components Still Cause Problems</h2><p>The <a href="https://www.iridium.com/network/" target="_blank">Iridium constellation</a>, first deployed in the late 1990s, is made up of 66 <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/satellites">satellites</a> disbursed across six orbital planes roughly 870 km above Earth. The constellation, the first to have provided global commercial <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/satellite-communications">satellite communications</a> services, supports satellite <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/telephony">telephony</a> and connects pagers, emergency beacons, and <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/internet-of-things">Internet of Things</a> devices all over the world. Out of Iridium’s 2.3 million subscribers, 145,000 are U.S. government customers. Iridium receivers are also frequently used by vessels at sea and by aircraft pilots exchanging information with other airplanes and with ground control.</p><p>“Back then <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/encryption">encryption</a> was not something on everyone’s mind,” Sec said during the presentation. “All the [first generation] Iridium data is unencrypted.” (Iridium didn’t respond to a request to comment.)</p><p>Iridium replaced its first-generation fleet with more secure satellites (the second-generation <a href="https://www.iridium.com/blog/iridium-next-review/" target="_blank">NEXT constellation</a>) between 2017 and 2019. But according to satellite and <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/telecommunications-industry">telecommunications industry</a> analyst Christian von der Ropp, many Iridium devices in use today, including civilian <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/satellite-phones">satellite phones</a>, still rely on the first-generation Iridium radio protocol that has no <a data-linked-post="2666125398" href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/fully-homomorphic-encryption" target="_blank">encryption</a>.</p><p>“The regular satellite phones that they sell still operate under the old legacy protocol,” says von der Ropp. “If you buy a brand-new civilian Iridium phone, it still operates using the 30-year-old radio protocol, and it is subject to the same vulnerability. So, you can intercept everything. You can listen to the voice calls, you can read <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/sms">SMS</a>, absolutely everything. Out of the box it’s a totally unsecure service.”</p><p>Von der Ropp estimates that tens or even hundreds of thousands of Iridium devices in use today rely on the old, unsecured radio protocol. </p><h2>Hackers Reveal Vulnerabilities in Iridium’s Systems</h2><p>While the DoD uses an extra layer of encryption to protect the content of its exchanges, other nations’ agencies appear to be less aware of the vulnerabilities. In perhaps the most jaw-dropping moment of the hacking demonstration, Sec revealed a <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/text-message">text message</a> exchanged between two employees of the German Foreign Office that he and Schneider were able to intercept.</p><p>“I need a good doctor in [Tel Aviv] who can also look at gunshot wounds. Can you send me a number ASAP,” read the message sent by a worker at the Crisis Response Center of the German Foreign Office’s mission in Tel Aviv. The hackers did not reveal when the exchange had taken place. </p><p>Using software he and Schneider had created, Sec also showed a map of devices visible in a single moment to their eavesdropping gear located in Munich. Iridium devices as far as London, central <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/norway">Norway</a> and <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/syria">Syria</a> (more than 3,000 km away) could be seen.</p><p>“With US $400 worth of equipment and freely available software, you can start right away intercepting Iridium communications in an area with a diameter of hundreds, sometimes even thousands of kilometers,” said von der Ropp, who was present at the demonstration. “The Iridium signal is divided into spot beams that are about 400 km wide. In principle, one should only be able to listen to the spot beam overhead. But the signal is so strong that you can also detect many of the surrounding spot beams, sometimes up to 2,000 km away.”</p><p>The DoD, von der Ropp said, is looking for alternatives to Iridium, including <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/starlink">Starlink</a>. Still, last year Iridium won a $94 million contract to provide communication services to the U.S. Space Force. </p><p>Von der Ropp noted that few Iridium users seemed to be active in <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/ukraine">Ukraine</a>, suggesting the local forces are potentially aware of Iridium’s shortcomings. The vulnerability of satellite systems and services to disruption and interference by bad actors has become a hot topic since Russia’s invasion of the country three years ago. The widespread cyberattack on the ground infrastructure of satellite communication provider Viasat crippled the Ukrainian forces’ access to satcom services on the eve of the invasion. The incident, which  according to analysts was planned by Russian state-backed hackers for months, revealed the weakness of Viasat’s cyber defenses. </p><p>Since then, the number of <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/cyberattacks">cyberattacks</a> on satcom providers has increased exponentially. Global navigation and positioning satellite systems such as <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/GPS">GPS</a> have also been put to the test. <a data-linked-post="2659993248" href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/satellite-jamming" target="_blank">Signal jamming</a> is now a regular occurrence even outside conflict zones and instances of sophisticated <a data-linked-post="2670499105" href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/gps-spoofing-2670499105" target="_blank">spoofing attacks</a>, designed to confuse users and send them to wrong locations, are becoming increasingly common.</p></div></div>]]></description>

Around 50 of the 70 members of the US Digital Corps, an early-career, two-year government fellowship, were terminated as well, sources say. Sources also tell WIRED that TTS management met with workers individually prior to the terminations, giving them one last chance to take the deferred resignation offered in the “Fork in the Road” email from <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/doge-hr-elon-musk-resignation-fork-road-leaked-staff-meeting/">late last month</a>.</p><p>One TTS staffer called the meetings “coercive for sure.”</p><p>It’s unclear how many people are being let go, but multiple sources tell WIRED that list could be upwards of 70 if not more.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
        <p><em>New court documents shed light on what a 25-year-old DOGE employee named Marko Elez did inside Treasury Department payment systems. They also provide extensive new details about which systems Elez accessed, the security precautions Treasury IT staff took to limit his access and activity, and what changes he made to the systems. The documents indicate that the situation at Treasury is more nuanced than previously reported.</em></p><p>Contrary to previous government statements, Marko Elez, a controversial 25-year-old employee working temporarily at the Treasury Department for Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), <em>did</em> have "write" privileges to one sensitive Treasury Department payments database in February. His access was the equivalent of data-editing privileges, however, not administrative-level network access as previously reported, and the "write" privilege was given to him by mistake for one day before Treasury discovered the error and revoked the privilege, according to an affidavit filed this week by a Treasury executive. There is no sign that Elez altered anything in the database before Treasury staff changed his access privileges.</p><p>The information contradicts not only <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/treasury-says-elon-musk-doge-has-read-only-access-to-payment-systems/?ref=zetter-zeroday.com">previous government statements</a> that Elez had only "read-only" access to Treasury payments systems, it also contradicts previous news stories reporting that Elez had administrative-level network privileges that would have allowed him to alter anything on Treasury's network – from bypassing security measures to changing access privileges for users and altering source code on production systems.</p><p>According to signed affidavits filed on Tuesday by Treasury Department career executives defending the access they provided Elez, their staff implemented a number of security restrictions around Elez's access to Treasury systems. He was the only DOGE worker given direct access to the systems, for example, and he was prohibited from using his own laptop to access them. He could only connect using a Bureau-issued laptop that had "cybersecurity tools" installed on it to prevent him from accessing web sites or cloud-based storage services with the laptop or connecting a USB or other external storage device to it to copy large amounts of data from Treasury systems. </p><blockquote>The information contradicts previous news stories reporting that Elez had administrative-level access that would have allowed him to alter anything on the network, including bypass security measures, change access privileges for users or alter source code on production systems.</blockquote><p>The information appears in an affidavit filed Tuesday by Joseph Gioeli III, a career technology executive who oversees Information and Security Services at the Treasury Department's Bureau of the Fiscal Service (hereafter referred to as BFS or the Bureau). The Bureau, a nonpartisan entity, oversees Treasury systems and networks that process and disburse payments on behalf of nearly 250 federal agencies, including Social Security benefits and foreign aid.</p><p>Gioeli told the court that his staff established a number of security measures at the start of Elez's employment in January to restrict and monitor his access to Treasury payment systems and prevent unauthorized activity, such as exfiltrating data or sharing it with unauthorized parties. Gioeli acknowledges, however, that Elez may have "occasionally" taken screen shots of payment system data or records to share with a second DOGE employee working with him at Treasury. </p><p>Elez worked for the government just a few weeks before resigning on February 6 after the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/doge-staffer-resigns-over-racist-posts-d9f11a93?ref=zetter-zeroday.com"><em>Wall Street Journal</em></a> discovered a series of racist posts he allegedly posted to social media accounts before he joined DOGE in January. Although President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance have since called for Musk to re-hire Elez, the youth has so far not been re-instated in his job.</p><p>Gioeli submitted his affidavit on February 11 as part of a <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-states-sue-block-musks-doge-accessing-payment-systems-2025-02-08/?ref=zetter-zeroday.com">lawsuit</a> filed against President Trump and the Treasury Department by 19 mostly Democratic attorneys general from around the country seeking an emergency temporary restraining order to limit access by DOGE employees to Treasury payment systems. The plaintiffs have argued that DOGE workers have no legal authority to access the highly sensitive Treasury systems and could cause disruption to critical payments or undermine the security of the systems.</p><p>The suit was filed in New York on February 7 after two news stories reported that Elez had the ability to make high-level changes to Treasury systems. <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/elon-musk-associate-bfs-federal-payment-system/?ref=zetter-zeroday.com">Wired Magazine reported</a> on February 4 that Elez had been given read-write privileges on "two of the most sensitive systems" at the Treasury Department, giving him the ability to change code on the systems. Wired also wrote that Elez had "many administrator-level privileges" that would typically give someone the ability to  navigate through parts of the system that ordinary users can't access, delete or add system files to alter how the system operates, change user permissions to give others access to the system, and delete or modify critical files to allow him or others to bypass security measures.</p><p>Wired didn't say whether Elez had made any changes, but the same day, Josh Marshall of <a href="https://talkingpointsmemo.com/edblog/musk-cronies-dive-into-treasury-dept-payments-code-base?ref=zetter-zeroday.com">Talking Points Memo</a>, reported that Elez did make changes to source code underlying the operation of the payment systems. Marshall wrote that Elez made the changes directly to a production system, without first testing them in a development environment to ensure they would not disrupt the system, and that the changes were designed to create "new paths to block payments and possibly leave less visibility into what has been blocked."</p><p>The allegations raised alarming questions about whether DOGE workers were halting Treasury payments with abandon or altering highly sensitive payment systems in ways that could disrupt their operation or undermine their security.  On Saturday U.S. District Judge Paul Engelmayer in New York granted the <a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/us-judge-temporarily-blocks-musks-doge-accessing-payment-systems-2025-02-08/?ref=zetter-zeroday.com">restraining order</a> to temporarily block DOGE's access to Treasury's payment systems until more information could be obtained about what workers were doing there.</p><p>Gioeli's affidavit, filed after the judge's order, disputes the reported claims and explains how Treasury staff say they carefully handled DOGE access to the payment systems to ensure the security and integrity of the systems. The affidavit suggests that media outlets, or their sources, may have conflated different things and misunderstood what was occurring at Treasury.</p><div><p>💡</p><p>If you know anything about what is going on inside government agencies with regard to DOGE, or anything else, please contact me on Signal at KimZ.42.</p></div><h3 id="background"><strong>Background</strong></h3><p>On January 20 this year, President Trump signed an <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/establishing-and-implementing-the-presidents-department-of-government-efficiency/?ref=zetter-zeroday.com">executive order</a> creating DOGE as a temporary department in the Executive Office of the President. It also directed leaders at federal agencies to establish a DOGE team at each agency —consisting of at least four people – to work on modernizing federal systems and software to make them more efficient. The same day, Trump signed a <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/reevaluating-and-realigning-united-states-foreign-aid/?ref=zetter-zeroday.com">second executive order</a> – entitled “Reevaluating and Realigning United States Foreign Aid” – which ordered a 90-day pause on all federal government payments issued for foreign development assistance. Since many of these payments get issued through Treasury Department payment systems, the DOGE team assigned to Treasury was one of the first to get set up.</p><p>Thomas Krause, Jr., former CFO and President of Broadcom Software and current CEO of the Cloud Service Group, was put in charge of the DOGE team at Treasury. Specifically, he was made Senior Advisor for Technology and Modernization at Treasury in January –  a temporary and unpaid special government employee position. Elez was hired to serve as Krause's technical lead and advisor and was the only one of the two who was given direct access to Treasury systems. Krause only had "observation access," according to Gioeli, meaning he had the ability to look over the shoulder of Elez or others as they accessed Treasury payment systems or source code but couldn't access the systems himself. </p><p>Elez, who began working as a Treasury employee on January 21, was supposed to work with engineers at the Bureau to find ways to update and modernize payment systems to improve their efficiency and make it easier to track payments and identify potentially improper and fraudulent ones. Treasury staff developed a 4-6 week "engagement" plan to provide DOGE workers with access to and information about several payment systems. These Treasury systems included:</p><p><strong>Payment Automation Manager (PAM)</strong> - an application for processing payments disbursed by federal agencies. Sometimes called the "landing zone" this is where federal agencies send a payment file (essentially a request to make a payment). When an agency submits a payment file, the system validates the file and sends a report back to the federal agency, indicating if the payment is potentially improper or fraudulent. If it's a valid payment, the federal agency then certifies the payment in the SPS system (below), after which the payment gets processed and disbursed.</p><p><strong>Secure Payment System (SPS)</strong> - another payment-processing system through which federal agencies create, certify, and submit payment files, including for one-time large dollar amount transactions.</p><p><strong>Automated Standard Application for Payments (ASAP)</strong> - a system that allows recipients of a payment to draw funds from an account set up for them.</p><p><strong>International Treasury Services (ITS)</strong> - system through which federal agencies can make international payments; it's often used to distribute Social Security benefits to Americans living abroad.</p><p><strong>Central Accounting and Reporting System (CARS)</strong> - an accounting system for recording the financial data related to an agency’s spending.</p><h3 id="doge-access-restrictions">DOGE Access Restrictions</h3><p>Elez was supposed to get access to source code, applications, and databases across all of these systems. But such access comes with many risks. It can potentially lead to disruption in the payment systems if a user doesn't know what they're doing and makes a mistake, the user can improperly access or use sensitive data, and the user can introduce unintentional vulnerabilities to the system or conduct malicious activity inside it.</p><p>To address these risks, Gioeli says his Treasury staff implemented several safeguards:</p><p>Elez could not use his own computer to access Treasury systems or even a general laptop the Treasury Department had given him. Per Bureau security policies, he had to be given a Bureau-specific laptop to access the source-code repository and payment systems. The laptop was encrypted to prevent unauthorized access to it if lost or stolen.</p><p>BFS used "several cybersecurity tools" to continuously monitor and log Elez’s activity –  tools that blocked his access to web sites, blocked the use of external peripherals (such as USB or external storage drives), monitored any scripts or commands he tried to execute on the device, and blocked access to cloud-based storage services. His laptop also had data-exfiltration detection to alert the Bureau if he tried to transmit any sensitive data.</p><p>On January 28, the Bureau gave Elez his Bureau laptop as well as access to copies of source code for the PAM, SPS, and ASAP systems, which he could only examine inside a “secure code repository” or sandbox environment. Elez could make changes to the source code copies in the sandbox, but Gioeli insists he did not have the authority or ability to publish any code changes to the production system, as Talking Points Memo had reported, or even to any test environment. Elez could only "review and make changes locally to copies of the source code" in the cordoned-off code repository. "This repository was separate from Fiscal Service’s typical code development environment, and unlike the usual code development environment, this new repository was segmented, to ensure that no changes to the operative source code could be made," Gioeli wrote in his affidavit.</p><p>According to Gioeli, beginning on February 3, Elez was given access to at least two Treasury payment systems – the PAM database and file system. He was given read-only privileges on them, which meant he could only view and query the information on the systems, not make changes to the data. He also received a “walk-through” demonstration of the PAM database and file system to learn how they worked. Gioeli says Elez's access to these systems was closely monitored by multiple administrators in addition to being tracked by security tools. </p><p>On February 5, Elez received access to Treasury's Secure Payment System (SPS) database – the system federal agencies use to create, certify, and submit payment orders to Treasury.  Staff gave him a virtual over-the-shoulder walk-through to help him connect to the database, and Gioeli says he accessed it "exclusively under the supervision of Bureau database administrators," and didn't access it again after this.</p><p>According to Gioeli, his access to the SPS database should have been read-only, but the next morning staff discovered that he had mistakenly been given read-write permissions, giving him the ability to alter data on the system. Administrators immediately changed his privileges to "read-only" then began a forensic review of all activity that had occurred on the server, the database and Elez's laptop. They found that Elez had only accessed the SPS once on February 5th when Treasury employees gave him their guided tour through the system, and he did not log in again after this or engage in any unauthorized activity while he had been on it.</p><p>Gioeli says he doesn't believe Elez even knew he had "write" privileges when he was on the system and in any case "never took any action" to exercise those privileges to modify anything. He notes, however, that forensic analysis is still ongoing to confirm this.</p><p>Gioeli says the staff never got around to giving Elez access to the ASAP, CARS, or ITS systems before he resigned on February 6. After he submitted his resignation, he turned in his Treasury laptop, his Bureau laptop, building access cards and government cell phone, and staff terminated his access to Bureau systems. It's unclear if Treasury system administrators discovered they had mistakenly given Elez "write" privileges to the SPS database before he resigned that day or only afterward when they moved to disable his access to the network.</p><p>Jake Williams, vice president of research and development at the cybersecurity consultancy Hunter Strategy, says the steps the Treasury staff took to ensure Elez didn't exceed the level of authorization he was granted sound "reasonable." </p><p>"It’s a baseline set of controls," he says. "I think they took the steps they should have taken." But he notes that the thoroughness of any forensic investigation they conduct into what Elez may or may not have done on his laptop or on the network depends on the thoroughness of their logging capabilities. Without knowing how much logging they were doing, it's hard to say whether their investigation is thorough.</p><p>"In a lot of cases, we simply don’t have the data available to say for instance a particular action was taken by a particular person. It all relies on application-level logging, which in some cases doesn’t exist."</p><p>Although the unauthorized write access was discovered on February 6, Gioeli says the review of Elez's laptop logs is still ongoing to determine everything he did on the device. Based on preliminary log reviews his activity included the following:</p><p>On February 3, Elez copied two US AID files from the PAM database to his Bureau laptop (US AID refers to the United States Agency for International Development); on February 4 and 5, he accessed the PAM file system; and on February 5, he accessed the PAM payment processing database. </p><p> "These activities are consistent with the read-only access that Mr. Elez was provided and [he] did not change or alter any Bureau payment system or record within their source systems," Gioeli noted in his affidavit.</p><h3 id="was-the-reporting-wrong">Was the Reporting Wrong?</h3><p>All of this raises questions about previous reporting on what happened at Treasury. Did Wired, or its sources, get the story wrong in reporting that Elez had administrative-level privileges on Treasury payment systems?</p><p>It's possible that the reporters or their sources conflated "write" privileges to a database with administrative privileges on a network. Administrative privileges aren't generally referred to as "write" privileges. Possessing writing privileges for a database means that someone can add, delete or alter data in the database, but this has nothing to do with the ability to change underlying source code for the database or make the kind of network configuration changes that Wired described in its story.</p><p>It's notable, however, that Wired reported on February 4th that Elez had "write" privileges to Treasury payment systems. According to Gioeli he only obtained "write" privileges to one database on February 5th, the day <em>after</em> the Wired story published. This raises questions about whether Treasury had intended to give him "write" access to the database all along, prompting an inside source to disclose this to Wired the day before administrators actually gave him that access, or whether Wired's sources confused the ability to alter a copy of source code with "write privileges" and administrative-level network access. </p><p>It's worth asking, however: would Treasury Department administrators have even discovered that they had mistakenly given Elez unauthorized "write" permission to the SPS system if Wired hadn't published its story? Did the story cause administrators to scrutinize Elez's access more closely and uncover their mistake? It's hard to say. The story and subsequent lawsuit have, however, put Treasury staff on notice that they have to be very intentional and cautious about everything they allow DOGE workers to do on Treasury systems going forward.</p><h3 id="did-elez-make-changes-to-treasury-source-code">Did Elez Make Changes to Treasury Source Code?</h3><p>In Josh Marshall's Talking Points Memo article, he reported that sources told him Elez had made changes to the payment system source code to create "new paths to block payments and possibly leave less visibility into what has been blocked."</p><p>Gioeli doesn't indicate if Elez actually made any code changes, only that he did not have the ability to make changes directly to code on production systems. He could only make changes to a copy of the source code stored in a sandbox environment. But there is one other court document that does reference a change Elez made, in conjunction with Bureau staff. According to a separate affidavit filed by another career civil servant at Treasury named Vona Robinson, deputy assistant  commissioner for federal disbursement services at the Bureau, Elez may have made a change to help staff more quickly identify specific types of payments in the system.</p><p>Under the President’s January 20 Executive Order temporarily halting foreign development payments for 90 -days, it gives Secretary of State Marco Rubio the ability to issue waivers to allow some payments to go through.</p><p>To make such determinations, the Bureau was supposed to make a copy of any request for foreign aid payments – especially requests coming from US AID – and send the copies to a secure portal for the secretary of state's office to review. Initially, Treasury department staff were manually querying the database to identify payment requests that might require review by the secretary of state. But according to Robinson at some point after January 31, Elez "assisted in automating the manual review of the payment files." This suggests that he, along with Bureau IT staff, may have made a change to the system's code to accomplish this.</p><p>A source told Talking Points Memo that the code changes Elez made created "new paths to bloc payments." But this may actually refer to the change Elez and Bureau staff made to send a copy of foreign aid payment requests – which were supposed to be temporarily blocked per the president's executive order – to a secure portal for the secretary of state to review.</p><p>Notably, Robinson says that only two sets of payments got copied and flagged for the secretary of state to review during this time period. The first occurred on February 7 and involved three payment requests made by the Department of Health and Human Services. The secretary of state determined that these payments did not fall under the Executive Order's mandatory payment halt and allowed the payments to be processed. The second set was flagged on February 10. It was an international payment submitted by the Millennium Challenge Corporation, a congressionally created entity that provides investment to poor countries that are committed to democratic governance and economic freedom. According to Robinson, the MCC withdrew its payment request the same day it submitted it.</p><p>In any case, after Elez helped devise a method to make copies of US AID payment requests and send them securely to the secretary of state's office for review, the latter figured out a way to get copies of the payment requests prior to them entering the Treasury system, according to the court documents.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="main">
    <p>Back in the late 2000s, I was a major contributor to the Wii homebrew scene. At the time, I worked on software (people call them “jailbreaks” these days) to allow users to run their own unofficial apps on the Nintendo Wii.</p>
<p>I was passionate about my work and the team I was part of (Team Twiizers, later fail0verflow). Despite that, I ended up burning out, primarily due to the very large fraction of entitled users. Most people using our software just wanted to play pirated games (something we did not support, condone, or directly enable). We kept playing a cat and mouse game with the manufacturer to keep the platform open, only to see our efforts primarily used by people who just wanted to steal other people’s work, and very loudly felt entitled to it. It got really old after a while. As newer game consoles were released, I ended up focusing on Linux ports purely for fun, and didn’t attempt to build a community nor work on the jailbreaks/exploits that would end up becoming a tool used by pirates.</p>
<p>When Apple released the M1, I realized that making it run Linux was my dream project. The technical challenges were the same as my console homebrew projects of the past (in fact, much bigger), but this time, the platform was already open - there was no need for a jailbreak, and no drama and entitled users who want to pirate software to worry about. And running Linux on an M1 was a <em>much</em> bigger deal than running it on a PS4.</p>
<p>I launched the Asahi Linux project, and received an immense amount of support and donations. Incredibly, I had the support I needed to make the project happen just a few days after my call to action, so I got to work. The first couple of years were amazing, as we brought the platform from nothing to one of the smoothest Linux experiences you can get on a laptop. Sure, there were/are still some bits and pieces of hardware support missing, but the overall experience rivaled or exceeded what you could get on most x86 laptops. And we built it all from scratch, with zero vendor support or documentation. It was an impossible feat, something that had never been done before, and we pulled it off.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, things became less fun after a while. First, there were the issues upstreaming code to the Linux kernel, which I’ve already spoken at length about and I won’t repeat here. Suffice it to say, being in a position to have to upstream code across practically every Linux subsystem, touching drivers of all categories as well as some common code, is an <em>incredibly</em> frustrating experience.</p>
<p>But then also came the entitled users. This time, it wasn’t about stealing games, it was about features. “When is Thunderbolt coming?” “Asahi is useless to me until I can use monitors over USB-C” “The battery life sucks compared to macOS” (nobody ever complained when compared to x86 laptops…) “I can’t even check my CPU temperature” (yes, I seriously got that one).</p>
<p>And, of course, “When is M3/M4 support coming?”</p>
<p>For a long time, well after we had a stable release, people kept claiming Asahi Linux and Fedora Asahi Remix in particular were “alpha” and “unstable” and “not suitable for a daily driver” (despite <a href="https://stats.asahilinux.org/">thousands of users</a>, myself included, daily driving it and even using it for servers).</p>
<p>No matter how much we did, how many impossible feats we pulled off, people always wanted more. And more. Meanwhile, donations and pledges kept slowly <em>decreasing</em>, and have done so since the project launched. Not enough to spell immediate doom for my dream of working on Asahi full time in the short term, but enough to make me wonder if any of this was really appreciated. The all-time peak monthly donation volume was the very first month or two. It seemed the more things we accomplished, the less support we had.</p>
<p>I knew burnout was a very real risk and managed this by limiting my time spent on certain areas, such as kernel upstreaming. This worked reasonably well and was mostly sustainable at the time.</p>
<p>Then 2024 happened. Last year was incredibly tumultuous for me due to personal reasons which I won’t go into detail about. Suffice it to say, I ended up traveling for most of the year, all the while having to handle various abusers and stalkers who harassed and attacked me and my family (and continue to do so).</p>
<p>I did make some progress in 2024, but this left me in a very vulnerable position. I hadn’t gotten nearly as much Asahi work done as I’d liked, and the users weren’t getting any quieter about demanding more features and machine support.</p>
<p>We shipped conformant Vulkan drivers and a whole emulation stack for x86-64 games and apps, but we were still stuck without DP Alt Mode (a feature which required deep reverse engineering, debugging, and kernel surgery to pull off, and which, if it were to be implemented properly and robustly, would require a major refactor of certain kernel subsystems or perhaps even the introduction of an entirely new subsystem).</p>
<p>I slowly started to ramp work up again at the beginning of this year, feeling very stressed out and guilty about having gotten very little work done for the previous year. “Full” DP Alt support was still a ways away, but we were hoping to ship a limited version that only worked on a specific Type C port for each machine type in the first month or two of the year. Sven had gotten some progress into the PHY code in December, so I picked it up and ended up beating the code of three drivers into enough shape that it mostly worked reliably. Even though it wasn’t the best approach, it was the most I could manage without having another huge bikeshed discussion with the kernel community (I did <a href="https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/fda8b831-1ffc-4087-8e7b-d97779b3ecc5@marcan.st/T/#u">try</a> to bring the subject up on the mailing lists, but it didn’t get much response).</p>
<p>The issues Rust for Linux has had surviving as an upstream Linux project are well documented, so I won’t repeat them in detail here. Suffice it to say, I consider Linus’ handling of the integration of Rust into Linux a major failure of leadership. Such a large project needs significant support from major stakeholders to survive, while his approach seems to have been to just wait and see. Meanwhile, multiple subsystem maintainers downstream of him have done their best to stonewall or hinder the project, issue unacceptable verbal abuse, and generally hurt morale, with no consequence. One major Rust for Linux maintainer already resigned a few months ago.</p>
<p>As you know, this is deeply personal to me, as we’ve made a bet on Rust for Linux for Asahi. Not just for fun (or just for memory safety), either: Rust is the entire reason our GPU driver was able to succeed in the time it did. We have two more Rust drivers in our downstream tree now, and a third one on track to be rewritten from C to Rust, because Rust is simply much better suited to the unique challenges we face, and the C driver is becoming unmaintainable. This is, by the way, the same reason the new Nova driver for Nvidia GPUs is being written in Rust. More modern programming languages are better suited to writing drivers for more modern hardware with more complexity and novel challenges, unsurprisingly.</p>
<p>Some might be wondering why we can’t just let the Rust situation play out on its own over a longer period of time, perhaps several more years, and simply maintain things downstream until then. One reason is that, of course, this situation is hurting developer morale in the present. Another is that our Apple GPU driver is itself major evidence that Rust for Linux is fit for purpose (it was the first big driver to be written from scratch in Rust and brought along with it lots of development in Rust kernel abstractions). Simply not aiming for upstream might be seen as lack of interest, and hurt the chances of survival of the Rust for Linux effort. But there’s more.</p>
<p>In fact, the Linux kernel development model is (perhaps paradoxically) designed to encourage upstreaming and punish downstream forks. While it is possible to just not care about upstream and maintain an outright hard fork, this is not a viable long-term solution (that’s how you get vendor Android kernel trees that die off in 2 years). The Asahi Linux downstream tree is continuously rebased on top of the latest upstream kernel, and that means that every extra patch we carry downstream increases our maintenance workload, sometimes significantly. But it goes deeper than that: Kernel/Mesa policy states that upstream Mesa support for a GPU driver cannot be merged and enabled until the kernel side is ready for merge. This means that we also have to ship a Mesa fork to users. While our GPU driver is 99% upstreamed into Mesa, it is intentionally hard-disabled and we are not allowed to submit a change that would enable it until the kernel side lands. This, in practice, means that users cannot have GPU acceleration work together with container technologies (such as Docker/Podman, but also including things like Waydroid), since standard container images will ship upstream Mesa builds, which would not be compatible. We have a <a href="https://pagure.io/fedora-asahi/mesa-asahi-flatpak">partial workaround</a> for Flatpak, but all other container systems are out of luck. Due to all this and more, the difficulty of upstreaming to the Linux kernel is hurting our downstream users today.</p>
<p>I’m not the kind to let injustices go when I see them, so when yet another long-term maintainer abused his position to attempt to hinder R4L and block upstreaming progress, I spoke out. And the response (which has been pretty widely covered) was the last drop that put me over the edge. I resigned from my position as an upstream maintainer for Apple ARM support, as I no longer want to be involved with that community. Later in that thread, another major maintainer unironically stated <a href="https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20250208204416.GL1130956@mit.edu/">“We
are the ‘thin blue line’”</a>, and nobody cared, which just further confirmed to me that I don’t want to have anything to do with them. This is the same person that previously prompted a Rust for Linux maintainer to <a href="https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20240828211117.9422-1-wedsonaf@gmail.com/">quit</a>.</p>
<p>But it goes well beyond the public incident. In the days that followed, I learned that some members of the kernel and adjacent Linux spaces have been playing a two-faced game with me, where they feigned support for me and Asahi Linux while secretly resenting me and rallying resentment behind closed doors. All this occurred without anyone ever sending me any private email or otherwise clueing me into what was going on. I heard that one of these people, one who has a high level position in multiple projects that Asahi Linux must interact with to survive, had sided with and continues to side with individuals who have abused and harassed me directly. Apparently there were also implied falsehoods, such as the idea that I am employed by someone to work on Asahi (I am not, we have zero corporate sponsorship other than <a href="https://bunny.net/">bunny.net</a> giving us free CDN credits for the hosting).</p>
<p>I get that some people might not have liked my Mastodon posts. Yes, I can be abrasive sometimes, and that is a fault I own up to. But this is simply not okay. I cannot work with people who form cliques behind the scenes and lie about their intentions. I cannot work with those who place blame on the messenger, instead of those who are truly toxic in the community. I cannot work with those who resent public commentary and claim things are better handled in private despite the fact that nothing ever seems to change in private. I cannot work with those who denounce calling out misbehavior on social media to thousands of followers, while themselves roasting people both on social media and on mailing lists with thousands of subscribers. I cannot work with those in high-level positions who use politically charged and discriminatory language in public and face no repercussions. I cannot work with those who say I’m the problem and everything is going great, while major supporters and maintainers are actively resigning and I keep receiving messages from all kinds of people saying they won’t touch the Linux kernel with a 10-foot pole.</p>
<p>When Apple released the M1, Linus Torvalds <a href="https://thenextweb.com/news/linus-torvalds-wants-apples-new-m1-powered-macs-to-run-linux">wished it could run Linux</a>, but didn’t have much hope it would ever happen. We made it happen, and Linux 5.19 was <a href="https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/CAHk-=wgrz5BBk=rCz7W28Fj_o02s0Xi0OEQ3H1uQgOdFvHgx0w@mail.gmail.com/T/#u">released from an M2 MacBook Air running Asahi Linux</a>. I had hoped his enthusiasm would translate to some support for our community and help with our upstreaming struggles. Sadly, that never came to pass. In November 2023 I sent him <a href="https://gist.github.com/marcan/fe70ee6648f3d5ae94eb8332265b8d95">an invitation</a> to discuss the challenges of kernel contributions and maintenace and see how we could help. He never replied.</p>
<p>Back in 2011, Con Kolivas <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110707151924/http://apcmag.com/why_i_quit_kernel_developer_con_kolivas.htm">left the Linux kernel community</a>. An anaesthetist by day, he was arguably the last great Linux kernel hobbyist hacker. In the years since it seems things have, if anything, only gotten worse. Today, it is practically impossible to survive being a significant Linux maintainer or cross-subsystem contributor if you’re not employed to do it by a corporation. Linux started out as a hobbyist project, but it has well and truly lost its hobbyist roots.</p>
<p>When I started Asahi Linux, I let it take over most of my life. I gave up most of my hobbies (after all, this was my dream hobby), and spent significantly more than full time working on the project. It was fun back then, but it’s not fun any more. I have an M3 Pro in a box and I haven’t even turned it on yet. I dread doing the bring-up work. It doesn’t feel worth the trouble.</p>
<p>I miss having free time where I can relax and not worry about the features we haven’t shipped yet. I miss <a href="https://youtube.com/@TsuiokuCircuit">making music</a>. I miss attending jam sessions. I miss going out for dinner with my friends and family and not having to worry about how much we haven’t upstreamed. I miss being able to sit down and play a game or watch a movie without feeling guilty.</p>
<p>I’m resigning as lead of the Asahi Linux project, effective immediately. The project will <a href="https://asahilinux.org/2025/02/passing-the-torch/">continue on without me</a>, and I’m working with the rest of the team to handle transfer of responsibilities and administrative credentials. My personal Patreon will be paused, and those who supported me personally are encouraged to transfer their support to the <a href="https://opencollective.com/asahilinux">Asahi Linux OpenCollective</a> (GitHub Sponsors does not allow me to unilaterally pause payments, but my sponsors will be notified of this change so they can manually cancel their sponsorship).</p>
<p>I want to thank the entire Asahi Linux team, without whom I would’ve never gotten anywhere alone. You all know who you are. I also give my utmost gratitude to all of my Patreon and GitHub sponsors, who made the project a viable reality to begin with.</p>
<p>If you are interested in hiring me or know someone who might be, please get in touch. Remote positions only please, on a consulting or flexible time/non exclusive basis. Contact: <a href="mailto:marcan@marcan.st">marcan@marcan.st</a>.</p>
