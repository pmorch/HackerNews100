				<p>I didn’t ask for this and neither did you.</p>
<p>I didn’t ask for a robot to consume every blog post and piece of code I ever wrote and parrot it back so that some hack could make money off of it.</p>
<p>I didn’t ask for the role of a programmer to be reduced to that of a glorified TSA agent, reviewing code to make sure the AI didn’t smuggle something dangerous into production.</p>
<p>And yet here we are. The worst fact about these tools is that they work. They can write code better than you or I can, and if you don’t believe me, wait six months.</p>
<p>You could abstain out of moral principle. And that’s fine, especially if you’re at the tail end of your career. And if you’re at the beginning of your career, you don’t need me to explain any of this to you, because you already use Warp and Cursor and Claude, with ChatGPT as your therapist and pair programmer and maybe even your lover. This post is for the 40-somethings in my audience who don’t realize this fact yet.</p>
<p>So as a senior, you could abstain. But then your junior colleagues will eventually code circles around you, because they’re wearing bazooka-powered jetpacks and you’re still riding around on a fixie bike. Eventually your boss will start asking why you’re getting paid twice your zoomer colleagues’ salary to produce a tenth of the code.</p>
<p>Ultimately if you have a mortgage and a car payment and a family you love, you’re going to make your decision. It’s maybe not the decision that your younger, more idealistic self would want you to make, but it does keep your car and your house and your family safe inside it.</p>
<p>Someday years from now we will look back on the era when we were the last generation to code by hand. We’ll laugh and explain to our grandkids how silly it was that we typed out JavaScript syntax with our fingers. But secretly we’ll miss it.</p>
<p>We’ll miss the feeling of holding code in our hands and molding it like clay in the caress of a master sculptor. We’ll miss the sleepless wrangling of some odd bug that eventually relents to the debugger at 2 AM. We’ll miss creating something we feel proud of, something true and right and good. We’ll miss the satisfaction of the artist’s signature at the bottom of the oil painting, the GitHub repo saying “I made this.”</p>
<p>I don’t celebrate the new world, but I also don’t resist it. The sun rises, the sun sets, I orbit helplessly around it, and my protests can’t stop it. It doesn’t care; it continues its arc across the sky regardless, moving but unmoved.</p>
<p>If you would like to grieve, I invite you to grieve with me. We are the last of our kind, and those who follow us won’t understand our sorrow. Our craft, as we have practiced it, will end up like some blacksmith’s tool in an archeological dig, a curio for future generations. It cannot be helped, it is the nature of all things to pass to dust, and yet still we can mourn. Now is the time to mourn the passing of our craft.</p>

    <h2>Why I Write Games in C (yes, C)</h2>
<p>I am an unusual beast. All my solo project games I've been making recently have
been written in 'vanilla' C. Nobody does this. So I think it might be
interesting to explain why I do.</p>
<p>Dry programming language opinions incoming, <strong>you have been warned</strong>.</p>
<h2>What I need from a language</h2>
<p>There's some things which are non-negotiable. First of, it has to be reliable.
I can't afford to spend my time dealing with bugs I didn't cause myself.</p>
<p>A lot of my games were written for flash, and now flash is dying. I do <strong>not</strong>
want to spend my time porting old games to new platforms, I want to make new
games. I need a platform that I am confident will be around for a while.</p>
<p>Similarly I want to avoid tying myself to a particular OS, and <em>ideally</em> I'd
like to have the option of developing for consoles. So it's important that my
programming language is portable, and that it has good portable library
support.</p>
<h2>What I want from a language</h2>
<p>The strongest thing on my desired, but not <em>required</em> list is simplicity. I
find looking up language features, and quirky 'clever' api's incredibly tiring.
The ideal language would be one I can memorize, and then never have to look
things up.</p>
<p>Dealing with bugs is huge creative drain. I want to produce less bugs, so I
want strict typing, strong warning messages and static code analysis. I want
bugs to be easier to find, so I want good debuggers and dynamic analysis.</p>
<p>I'm not interesting in high-def realism, but I do still care a bit about
performance. Having more cycles available broadens the palette of things you
can do. It's particularly interesting to explore what is possible with modern,
powerful computers if you aren't persuing fidelity.</p>
<p>Even more than that I care about the speed of the compiler. I am not a zen
master of focus, and waiting 10+ seconds is wasteful, yes, but more importantly
it breaks my flow. I flick over to Twitter and suddenly 5+ minutes are gone.</p>
<p>I am not an OOP convert. I've spent most of my professional life working
with classes and objects, but the more time I spend, the less I understand why
you'd want to combine code and data so rigidly. I want to handle data as data
and write the code that best fits a particular situation.</p>
<h2>The Alternatives</h2>
<p>C++ is still the most common language for writing games, and not without
reason. I still do almost all of my contract work in it. I dislike it
intensely.</p>
<p>C++ covers my needs, but fails my wants badly. It is desperately complicated.
Despite decent tooling it's easy to create insidious bugs. It is also slow to
compile compared to C. It is high performance, and it offers features that C
doesn't have; but features I don't want, and at a great complexity cost.</p>
<p>C# and Java have similar issues. They are verbose and complex beasts, and I am
searching for a concise, simple creature. They both do a lot to railroad a
programmer into a strongly OOP style that I am opposed to. As per most higher
level languages they have a tendency to hide away complexity in a way that
doesn't actually prevent it from biting you.</p>
<p>I like Go a lot. In many ways it is C revisited, taking into account what has
be learnt in the long years since it was released. I would like to use it,
but there are big roadblocks that prevent me. The stop-the-world garbage
collection is a big pain for games, stopping the world is something you
can't really afford to do. The library support for games is quite
poor, and though you can wrap C libs without much trouble, doing so adds
a lot of busy work. It is niche enough that I worry a little about long term
relevance.</p>
<p>It would be nice to make things for the web, but it feels like a terrifyingly
fast moving enviroment. It is particularly scary with the death of flash.
I really dislike javascript, it is so loose that I marvel that people are
able to write big chunks of software in it. I have no interest in trying.</p>
<p>Haxe feels much more promising than most alternatives. If I do web stuff again
I'll be diving in here. There is some good library support. I am a little
concerned by its relative youth, will it last? I don't much have else to say
about it though, I've only dabbled with the surface.</p>
<p>Some people just say screw it, I'll write my own language, the language I want
to use. I admire this, and sometimes I toy with the idea of doing the same. It
feels like too much to throw away all existing library support, and taking
full responsibilty for future compatibility. It is also very difficult, and
when it comes down to it I would rather be making games than programming
languages.</p>
<h2>Why C is <em>still</em> my best fit</h2>
<p>C is dangerous, but it is reliable. A very sharp knife that can cut fingers as
well as veg, but so simple it's not too hard to learn to use it carefully.</p>
<p>It is fast, and when it comes to compilation I can't think of anything faster.</p>
<p>It can be made to run on just about anything. Usually this is relatively easy.
It is hard to imagine a time when this won't be the case.</p>
<p>The library and tooling support is strong and ongoing.</p>
<p>I say this with some sadness, but it is still the language for me.</p>
<p>I absolutely DO NOT mean to say "hey, you should use C too". I full appeciate
preferences here are pretty specific and unusual. I have also already written
more 'vanilla' C code than most, and this certainly is part of my comfort.</p>
<p>So yeah, that's it :-)</p>

<h2>SectorC: A C Compiler in 512 bytes</h2>
<p>SectorC (<a href="https://github.com/xorvoid/sectorc">github</a>) is a C compiler written in x86-16 assembly that fits within the 512 byte boot sector of an x86 machine. It supports a
subset of C that is large enough to write real and interesting programs. It is quite likely the smallest C compiler ever written.</p>
<p>In a base64 encoding, it looks like this:</p>

wYQA0+CaANP4jwCUwHf/lcAMAJzADgCfwIUAnsCZAJ3AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAVao=
</code></pre>
<h2>Supported language</h2>
<p>A fairly large subset is supported: global variables, functions, if statements, while statements, lots of operators, pointer dereference, inline machine-code, comments, etc.
All of these features make it quite capable.</p>
<p>For example, the following program animates a moving sine-wave:</p>
<pre><code>int y;
int x;
int x_0;
void sin_positive_approx()
{
  y = ( x_0 * ( 157 - x_0 ) ) &gt;&gt; 7;
}
void sin()
{
  x_0 = x;
  while( x_0 &gt; 314 ){
    x_0 = x_0 - 314;
  }
  if( x_0 &lt;= 157 ){
    sin_positive_approx();
  }
  if( x_0 &gt; 157 ){
    x_0 = x_0 - 157;
    sin_positive_approx();
    y = 0 - y;
  }
  y = 100 + y;
}


int offset;
int x_end;
void draw_sine_wave()
{
  x = offset;
  x_end = x + 314;
  while( x &lt;= x_end ){
    sin();
    pixel_x = x - offset;
    pixel_y = y;
    vga_set_pixel();
    x = x + 1;
  }
}

int v_1;
int v_2;
void delay()
{
  v_1 = 0;
  while( v_1 &lt; 50 ){
    v_2 = 0;
    while( v_2 &lt; 10000 ){
      v_2 = v_2 + 1;
    }
    v_1 = v_1 + 1;
  }
}

void main()
{
  vga_init();

  offset = 0;
  while( 1 ){
    vga_clear();
    draw_sine_wave();

    delay();
    offset = offset + 1;
    if( offset &gt;= 314 ){ // mod the value to avoid 2^16 integer overflow
      offset = offset - 314;
    }
  }
}
</code></pre>

<h2>But, how?</h2>
<p>When I started thinking about SectorC, I had just finished <a href="https://xorvoid.com/otcc_deobfuscated.html">Deobfuscating OTCC</a> with a lot of its ideas freshly loaded into my head.
I also just had some healthy doses of <a href="http://justine.lol/">justine.lol</a> and <a href="http://tom7.org/">Tom7</a> to inspire the absurdity of it all.</p>
<p>Did I think I would succeed? I suspected NO. Fit an entire C compiler in 510 bytes of instruction memory? Good luck (sarcasm).</p>
<h2>Tokenizing</h2>
<p>The first problem came quickly. In C, the tokenizer/lexer alone seems larger than one 512 byte sector! We need to consume an arbitrary stream of bytes and produce “tokens”.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre><code>int main()
{
  if( a &lt; 5 ){
    func();
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>Would be consumed and converted into:</p>
<pre><code>'int'  TOKEN_KEYWORD_INT
'main' TOKEN_IDENTIFIER
'('    TOKEN_LPAREN
')'    TOKEN_RPAREN
'{'    TOKEN_LBRACE
'if'   TOKEN_KEYWORD_IF
'('    TOKEN_LPAREN
'a'    TOKEN_IDENTIFIER
'&lt;'    TOKEN_OPERATOR
'5'    TOKEN_NUMBER
')'    TOKEN_RPAREN
'{'    TOKEN_LBRACE
'func' TOKEN_IDENTIFIER
'('    TOKEN_LPAREN
')'    TOKEN_RPAREN
';'    TOKEN_SEMI
'}'    TOKEN_RBRACE
'}'    TOKEN_RBRACE
</code></pre>
<p>We need to specifically recognize <code>keywords</code>, <code>identifiers</code>, <code>operators</code>, and <code>numbers</code>. And then we need to convert numbers from string to integer with something like <code>atoi()</code>:</p>
<pre><code>int atoi(const char *s)
{
  int n = 0;
  while (1) {
    char c = *s++;
    if (!c) break;
    n = 10 * n + (c - '0');
  }
  return n;
}
</code></pre>
<p>I wrote a fairly straight-forward and minimalist lexer and it took &gt;150 lines of C code. A crude estimate of the same code in x86-16 would require 300-450 bytes minimum (e.g. a simple <code>add ax,bx</code> instruction encodes as 2 bytes). And this doesn’t include any symbol table, recursive-descent parser, code-generator, branch-patching, etc.</p>
<p>No Chance.</p>
<p>So, naturally … I continued. Always pick the losers. The lolz are more fun that way.</p>
<h3>Big Insight #1</h3>
<p>Big Insight #1 came while thinking about other languages such as Forth. The tokenizer in Forth is nearly trivial. Every token is simply space-delimited. Every token is just called a <code>WORD</code> and nothing is special (slight lie). Hmm, how about a C that does that? So dreamed up a C that is technically still a C, is probably turing-complete, and will definitely make every code maintainer terrified. 😏</p>
<p>I will call it the <em>Barely C Programming Language</em>:</p>
<pre><code>int done , a , b , c , p , cond ;
int(main)(){while(!done){
     a = b - c ;
     *(int*) p = b - c ;
     a = *(int*) p ;
     if(cond) a = b - 45 ;
}}
</code></pre>
<p>Here we have spacing strategically placed to create “mega-tokens”</p>
<p>For example: <code>int(main)(){while(!done){</code> is one such "mega-token".</p>
<p>In a sense, we actually have a language more like:</p>
<pre><code>VAR_BEGIN done AND a AND b AND c AND p AND cond END
MAIN_BEGIN
  a = b - c END
  DEREF p = b - c END
  a = DEREF p END
  COND a = b - 45 END
MAIN_END
</code></pre>
<p>But, a normal C compiler will also recognize it as C!</p>
<p>Even after using space-delimiters, we still have a lot of tokens and need to find more ways to minimize the tokenizer. What is essential? Well it’s quite hard to avoid the <code>atoi()</code> if we want to actually have integer literals. What else do we need? How about nothing.</p>
<h3>Big Insight #2</h3>
<p>Big Insight #2 is that <code>atoi()</code> behaves as a (bad) hash function on ordinary text. It consumes characters and updates a 16-bit integer. Hashes are perhaps the holy-grail of computer-science.
With a good hash, we can just side-step all the hard problems by trading them for an even harder problem (hash collisions), and then we just ignore that harder problem. Brilliant. (sticks fingers in ears) 🤪</p>
<p>So we have this:</p>

<td>token ”enum” value</td>

<td>Identifier</td>
<td>hash value into a 64K array</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<h2>Implementing Barely C</h2>
<p>The first implementation of Barely C fit in 468 bytes. It was a simple recursive-descent parser over the <code>atoi</code> tokens. There was no symbol table of any kind. Variables simply access a 64K segment using the hash value. Codegen is emitted somewhat similar to <a href="https://xorvoid.com/otcc_deobfuscated.html">OTCC</a>, using <code>ax</code> as the result register and shuffling values to the stack and then to <code>cx</code> for binary operators.</p>
<h2>Minimizing with Byte-Threaded Code</h2>
<p>In an attempt to steal every good idea Forth ever had, I then dreamed up what I will call “byte-threaded-code”. Since a sector is 512 bytes, if we simply align address on a 2-byte boundary, we can do addressing with a single byte! We can have a series of “gadgets” and do forth-style threading:</p>
<pre><code>bits 16
  cpu 386

  jmp 0x07c0:entry

entry:
  push cs
  pop  ds

  lea si,operations
next:
  xor ax,ax
  lodsb
  add ax,ax
  push next
  jmp ax

putch:
  mov ah,0x01
  mov al,bl
  mov dx,0
  int 0x14
  ret

  align 2
hang:
  jmp hang

  align 2
print_F:
  mov bx,'F'
  jmp putch

  align 2
print_G:
  mov bx,'G'
  jmp putch

operations:
  db 17  ; print_F
  db 20  ; print_G
  db 17  ; print_F
  db 17  ; print_F
  db 20  ; print_G
  db 17  ; print_F
  db 17  ; print_F
  db 17  ; print_F
  db 20  ; print_G
  db 16  ; hang
</code></pre>
<p>Annoyingly, <code>nasm</code> won’t let you do something like <code>db print_F/2</code> so I had to write a custom little assembler to do it.</p>
<p>Alas, this idea didn’t work out. In 512 bytes, the overhead of this Forth-style computation model doesn’t pay for itself. There are a lot of little overheads: 2 byte alignment, extra <code>ret</code> instructions, calling other “threads”, the <code>next</code> function, etc. The byte-threaded version of Barely C ended up at the same size as the straight-forward version</p>
<p>However, the idea is fun and I decided to document it anyways in the event that someone else finds utility.</p>
<h2>Minimizing the Straight-Forward version</h2>
<p>Instead, I returned to the straight-forward version and minimized it as much as possible. From 468 bytes ⇒ 303 bytes (165 bytes saving): 510 - 303 ⇒ 207 spare bytes to use for new features!</p>
<p>Some tricks:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reorganize code to allow “fall-through” instead of <code>jmp</code> or <code>call</code></li>
<li>Use tail-calls via <code>jmp</code> wherever possible</li>
<li>Perform call-fusion (e.g. <code>call tok_next2</code> instead of <code>call tok_next; call tok_next</code>)</li>
<li>Utilize <code>stosw</code> and <code>lodsw</code> extensively</li>
<li>Eliminate machine code tables for cheaper inline <code>stosw</code> versions</li>
<li>Prefer <code>cmp ax,imm</code> over <code>cmp bx,imm</code></li>
<li>Keep jump offsets within 8-bits to encode more efficiently</li>
</ul>
<h2>Look Ma, A Real C!</h2>
<p>As it turns out, a lot can be accomplished in 200 bytes if you already have a tokenizer, parser, and code-generator in 300 bytes. With these 200 bytes, <em>Barely C</em> became a proper C:</p>
<ul>
<li>Arbitrarily nested <code>if</code> statement block with an arbitrary expression condition</li>
<li>Arbitrarily nested <code>while</code> statement block with an arbitrary expression condition</li>
<li>Lots of operators: <code>+</code>, <code>-</code>, <code>*</code>, <code>&amp;</code>, <code>|</code>, <code>^</code>, <code>&lt;&lt;</code>, <code>&gt;&gt;</code>, <code>==</code>, <code>!=</code>, <code>&lt;</code>, <code>&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;=</code>, <code>&gt;=</code></li>
<li>Grouping expressions: <code>( expression )</code></li>
<li>Function definitions and recursive function calls (using <code>func()</code> as a hash value into a symbol table at segment 0x3000)</li>
<li>A special <code>asm</code> statement for inline machine-code</li>
<li>Single-line <code>//</code> comments</li>
<li>Multi-line <code>/*</code> comments</li>
<li>A trick to do “space-injection” before semicolons to make code look more normal</li>
</ul>
<p>The biggest enabler here is the <code>binary_oper_tbl</code> which allows for a very cheap way to add lots of operations. Each operator is simply a <code>&lt;16-bit token-value&gt; &lt;16-bit-machine-code&gt;</code> pair, costing just 4 bytes.The above 14 operators cost just 56 bytes plus a little overhead to scan the table.</p>
<h2>Grammar</h2>
<p>Here's the full grammer specification:</p>
<pre><code>program     = (var_decl | func_decl)+
var_decl    = "int" identifier ";"
func_decl   = "void" func_name "{" statement* "}"
func_name   = &lt;identifier that ends in "()" with no space&gt;
statement   = "if(" expr "){" statement* "}"
            | "while(" expr "){" statement* "}"
            | "asm" integer ";"
            | func_name ";"
            | assign_expr ";"
assign_expr = deref? identifier "=" expr
deref       = "*(int*)"
expr        = unary (op unary)?
unary       = deref identifier
            | "&amp;" identifier
            | "(" expr ")"
            | indentifier
            | integer
op          = "+" | "-" | "&amp;" | "|" | "^" | "&lt;&lt;" | "&gt;&gt;"
            | "==" | "!=" | "&lt;" | "&gt;" | "&lt;=" | "&gt;="
</code></pre>
<p>In addition, both <code>// comment</code> and <code>/* multi-line comment */</code> styles are supported.</p>
<p>(NOTE: This grammar is 704 bytes in ascii, 38% larger than it's implementation!)</p>
<h2>Inline Machine-Code</h2>
<p>A programming language without I/O is useless. And, as the C language is defined in an I/O agnostic way, we need some way out. Thus, an <code>asm</code> extension is supported. This allows programs to generate raw x86-16 machine code literals inline. Using <code>asm</code>, programs can access any low-level detail of the machine. This is used extensively in the example code.</p>
<h2>Error-Handling</h2>
<p>What is “error-handling”? 🤣</p>
<p>In traditional C style, we trust the programmer to write correct and well-formed programs. We are certain they are all minor gods and goddesses with the ability of perfection. Obviously, spending bytes on error-checking would be foolish. Surely all will agree that this is a very reasonable standard.</p>
<p>For the less divine among us, a <code>lint</code> was also written (that doesn’t fit in a sector) to detect errors. The author certainly didn’t require this tool for development.</p>
<h2>Runtime</h2>
<p>If C compiler writers were a secret shadow organization like the Free Masons, Illuminati, Lizard Peoples, or Pizzagaters our inner-secret would be “C actually has a runtime”.</p>
<p>SectorC has a runtime under <code>rt/</code> consisting of two files implemented in C itself:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>rt/lib.c:</code> A collection of library routines, often coded in inline <code>asm</code></li>
<li><code>rt/_start.c:</code> The actual entry-point <code>_start()</code></li>
</ul>
<p>The runtime code is concatenated with program source to construct the full source to compile and run.</p>
<h2>Examples</h2>
<p>A few examples are provided that leverage the unique hardware aspects of the x86-16 IBM PC:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>examples/hello.c:</code> Print a text greeting on the screen writing to memory at <code>0xB8000</code></li>
<li><code>examples/sinwave.c:</code> Draw a moving sine wave animation with VGA Mode 0x13 using an appropriately bad approximation of <code>sin(x)</code></li>
<li><code>examples/twinkle.c:</code> Play “Twinkle Twinkle Little Star” through the PC Speaker (Warning: LOUD)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>It seems fitting to end an article with “takeaways” or “what did we learn”. So.. umm.. what did we learn? Honestly, I’m not sure. But in the interest of fun, here’s a Choice Your Own Adventure version of What Did We Learn:</p>

<p>By <b>Susam Pal</b> on 06 Feb 2026</p>
<p>
  Last year, I completed 20 years in professional software
  development.  I wanted to write a post to mark the occasion back
  then, but couldn't find the time.  This post is my attempt to make
  up for that omission.  In fact, I have been involved in software
  development for a little longer than 20 years.  Although I had
  my <a href="https://susam.net/fd-100.html">first taste</a> of computer programming as
  a child, it was only when I entered university about 25 years ago
  that I seriously got into software development.  So I'll start my
  stories from there.  These stories are less about software and more
  about people.  Unlike many posts of this kind, this one offers no
  wisdom or lessons.  It only offers a collection of stories.  I hope
  you'll like at least a few of them.

</ul>
<h2 id="viewing-the-source">Viewing the Source<a href="#viewing-the-source"></a></h2>
<p>
  The first story takes place in 2001, shortly after I joined
  university.  One evening, I went to the university computer
  laboratory to browse the Web.  Out of curiosity, I typed
  <code>susam.com</code> into the address bar and landed on
  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010721163153/http://susam.com/">its
  home page</a>.  I remember the text and banner looking much larger
  back then.  Display resolutions were lower, so they covered almost
  half the screen.  I knew very little about the Internet then and I
  was just trying to make sense of it.  I remember wondering what it
  would take to create my own website, perhaps at
  <code>susam.com</code>.  That's when an older student who had been
  watching me browse over my shoulder approached and asked if I had
  created the website.  I told him I hadn't and that I had no idea how
  websites were made.  He asked me to move aside, took my seat and
  clicked View &gt; Source in Internet Explorer.  He then explained
  how websites are made of HTML pages and how those pages are simply
  text instructions.
</p>
<p>
  Next, he opened Notepad and wrote a simple HTML page that looked
  something like this:
</p>
<pre><code>&lt;BODY&gt;&lt;FONT COLOR="RED"&gt;HELLO&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/BODY&gt;</code></pre>
<p>
  Yes, we had a <code>FONT</code> tag back then and it was common
  practice to write HTML tags in uppercase.  He then opened the page
  in a web browser and showed how it rendered.  After that, he
  demonstrated a few more features such as changing the font face and
  size, centring the text and altering the page's background colour.
  Although the tutorial lasted only about ten minutes, it made the
  World Wide Web feel far less mysterious and much more fascinating.
</p>
<p>
  That person had an ulterior motive though.  After the tutorial, he
  never returned the seat to me.  He just continued browsing the Web
  and waited for me to leave.  I was too timid to ask for my seat
  back.  Seats were limited, so I returned to my dorm room both
  disappointed that I couldn't continue browsing that day and excited
  about all the websites I might create with this newfound knowledge.
  I could never register <code>susam.com</code> for myself though.
  That domain was always used by some business selling Turkish
  cuisines.  Eventually, I managed to get the next best thing:
  a <code>.net</code> domain of my own.  That brief encounter in the
  university laboratory set me on a lifelong path of creating and
  maintaining personal websites.
</p>
<h2 id="reset-vector">The Reset Vector<a href="#reset-vector"></a></h2>
<p>
  The second story also comes from my university days.  One afternoon,
  I was hanging out with my mates in the computer laboratory.  In
  front of me was an MS-DOS machine powered by an Intel 8086
  microprocessor, on which I was writing a lift control program in
  assembly.  In those days, it was considered important to
  deliberately practise solving made-up problems as a way of honing
  our programming skills.  As I worked on my program, my mind drifted
  to a small detail about the 8086 microprocessor that we had recently
  learnt in a lecture.  Our professor had explained that, when the
  8086 microprocessor is reset, execution begins with CS:IP set to
  FFFF:0000.  So I murmured to anyone who cared to listen, 'I wonder
  if the system will reboot if I jump to FFFF:0000.'  I then
  opened <code>DEBUG.EXE</code> and jumped to that address.
</p>
<pre><samp>C:\&gt;<kbd>DEBUG</kbd>
-<kbd>G =FFFF:0000</kbd></samp></pre>
<p>
  The machine rebooted instantly.  One of my friends, who topped the
  class every semester, had been watching over my shoulder.  As soon
  as the machine restarted, he exclaimed, 'How did you do that?'  I
  explained that the reset vector is located at physical address FFFF0
  and that the CS:IP value FFFF:0000 maps to that address in real
  mode.  After that, I went back to working on my lift control program
  and didn't think much more about the incident.
</p>
<p>
  About a week later, the same friend came to my dorm room.  He sat
  down with a grave look on his face and asked, 'How did you know to
  do that?  How did it occur to you to jump to the reset vector?'  I
  must have said something like, 'It just occurred to me.  I
  remembered that detail from the lecture and wanted to try it out.'
  He then said, 'I want to be able to think like that.  I come top of
  the class every semester, but I don't think the way you do.  I would
  never have thought of taking a small detail like that and testing it
  myself.'  I replied that I was just curious to see whether what we
  had learnt actually worked in practice.  He responded, 'And that's
  exactly it.  It would never occur to me to try something like that.
  I feel disappointed that I keep coming top of the class, yet I am
  not curious in the same way you are.  I've decided I don't want to
  top the class anymore.  I just want to explore and experiment with
  what we learn, the way you do.'
</p>
<p>
  That was all he said before getting up and heading back to his dorm
  room.  I didn't take it very seriously at the time.  I couldn't
  imagine why someone would willingly give up the accomplishment of
  coming first every year.  But he kept his word.  He never topped the
  class again.  He still ranked highly, often within the top ten, but
  he kept his promise of never finishing first again.  To this day, I
  feel a mix of embarrassment and pride whenever I recall that
  incident.  With a single jump to the processor's reset entry point,
  I had somehow inspired someone to step back from academic
  competition in order to have more fun with learning.  Of course,
  there is no reason one cannot do both.  But in the end, that was his
  decision, not mine.
</p>
<h2 id="man-in-the-middle">Man in the Middle<a href="#man-in-the-middle"></a></h2>
<p>
  In my first job after university, I was assigned to a technical
  support team where part of my work involved running an installer to
  deploy a specific component of an e-banking product for customers,
  usually large banks.  As I learnt to use the installer, I realised
  how fragile it was.  The installer, written in Python, often failed
  because of incorrect assumptions about the target environment and
  almost always required some manual intervention to complete
  successfully.  During my first week on the project, I spent much of
  my time stabilising the installer and writing a step-by-step user
  guide explaining how to use it.  The result was well received by
  both my seniors and management.  To my surprise, the user guide
  received more praise than the improvements I made to the installer
  itself.  While the first few weeks were productive, I soon realised
  I would not find the work fulfilling for long.  I wrote to
  management a few times to ask whether I could transfer to a team
  where I could work on something more substantial.
</p>
<p>
  My emails were initially met with resistance.  After several rounds
  of discussion, however, someone who had heard about my situation
  reached out and suggested a team whose manager might be interested
  in interviewing me.  The team was based in a different city.  I was
  young and willing to relocate wherever I could find good work, so I
  immediately agreed to the interview.
</p>
<p>
  This was in 2006, when video conferencing was not yet common.  On
  the day of the interview, the hiring manager called me on my office
  desk phone.  He began by introducing the team, which was called
  <em>Archie</em>, short for <em>architecture</em>.  The team
  developed and maintained the web framework and core architectural
  components on which the entire e-banking product was built.  The
  product had existed long before open source frameworks such as
  Spring or Django came into existence, so features such as API
  routing, authentication and authorisation layers, cookie management,
  etc. were all implemented in-house as Java Servlets and JavaServer
  Pages (JSP).  Since the software was used in banking environments,
  it also had to pass strict security testing and regular audits to
  minimise the risk of serious flaws.
</p>
<p>
  The interview began well.  He asked several questions related to
  software security, such as what SQL injection is and how it can be
  prevented or how one might design a web framework that mitigates
  cross-site scripting attacks.  He also asked programming questions,
  most of which I answered pretty well.  Towards the end, however, he
  asked how we could prevent MITM attacks.  I had never heard the
  term, so I admitted that I did not know what MITM meant.  He then
  asked, 'Man in the middle?' but I still had no idea what that meant
  or whether it was even a software engineering concept.  He replied,
  'Learn everything you can about PKI and MITM.  We need to build a
  digital signatures feature for one of our corporate banking
  products.  That's the first thing we'll work on.'
</p>
<p>
  Over the next few weeks, I studied RFCs and documentation related to
  public key infrastructure, public key cryptography standards and
  related topics.  At first, the material felt intimidating, but after
  spending time each evening reading whatever relevant literature I
  could find, things gradually began to make sense.  Concepts that
  initially seemed complex and overwhelming eventually felt intuitive
  and elegant.  I relocated to the new city a few weeks later and
  delivered the digital signatures feature about a month after joining
  the team.  We used the open source Bouncy Castle library to
  implement the feature.  After that project, I worked on other parts
  of the product too.  The most rewarding part was knowing that the
  code I was writing became part of a mature product used by hundreds
  of banks and millions of users.  It was especially satisfying to see
  the work pass security testing and audits and be considered ready
  for release.
</p>
<p>
  That was my first real engineering job.  My manager also turned out
  to be an excellent mentor.  Working with him helped me develop new
  skills and his encouragement gave me confidence that stayed with me
  for years.  Nearly two decades have passed since then, yet the
  product is still in service and continues to be actively developed.
  In fact, in my current phase of life I sometimes encounter it as a
  customer.  Occasionally, I open the browser's developer tools to
  view the page source where I can still see traces of the HTML
  generated by code I wrote almost twenty years ago.

<p>
  Around 2007 or 2008, I began working on a proof of concept for
  developing widgets for an OpenTV set-top box.  The work involved
  writing code in a heavily trimmed-down version of C.  One afternoon,
  while making good progress on a few widgets, I noticed that they
  would occasionally crash at random.  I tried tracking down the bugs,
  but I was finding it surprisingly difficult to understand my own
  code.  I had managed to produce some truly spaghetti code full of
  dubious pointer operations that were almost certainly responsible
  for the crashes, yet I could not pinpoint where exactly things were
  going wrong.
</p>
<p>
  Ours was a small team of four people, each working on an independent
  proof of concept.  The most senior person on the team acted as our
  lead and architect.  Later that afternoon, I showed him my progress
  and explained that I was still trying to hunt down the bugs causing
  the widgets to crash.  He asked whether he could look at the code.
  After going through it briefly and probably realising that it was a
  bit of a mess, he asked me to send him the code as a tarball, which
  I promptly did.
</p>
<p>
  He then went back to his desk to study the code.  I remember
  thinking that there was no way he was going to find the problem
  anytime soon.  I had been debugging it for hours and barely
  understood what I had written myself; it was the worst spaghetti
  code I had ever produced.  With little hope of a quick solution, I
  went back to debugging on my own.
</p>
<p>
  Barely five minutes later, he came back to my desk and asked me to
  open a specific file.  He then showed me exactly where the pointer
  bug was.  It had taken him only a few minutes not only to read my
  tangled code but also to understand it well enough to identify the
  fault and point it out.  As soon as I fixed that line, the crashes
  disappeared.  I was genuinely in awe of his skill.
</p>
<p>
  I have always loved computing and programming, so I had assumed I
  was already fairly good at it.  That incident, however, made me
  realise how much further I still had to go before I could consider
  myself a good software developer.  I did improve significantly in
  the years that followed and today I am far better at managing
  software complexity than I was back then.
</p>

<p>
  In another project from that period, we worked on another set-top
  box platform that supported Java Micro Edition (Java ME) for widget
  development.  One day, the same architect from the previous story
  asked whether I could add animations to the widgets.  I told him
  that I believed it should be possible, though I'd need to test it to
  be sure.  Before continuing with the story, I need to explain how
  the different stakeholders in the project were organised.
</p>
<p>
  Our small team effectively played the role of the software vendor.
  The final product going to market would carry the brand of a major
  telecom carrier, offering direct-to-home (DTH) television services,
  with the set-top box being one of the products sold to customers.
  The set-top box was manufactured by another company.  So the project
  was a partnership between three parties: our company as the software
  vendor, the telecom carrier and the set-top box manufacturer.  The
  telecom carrier wanted to know whether widgets could be animated on
  screen with smooth slide-in and slide-out effects.  That was why the
  architect approached me to ask whether it could be done.
</p>
<p>
  I began working on animating the widgets.  Meanwhile, the architect
  and a few senior colleagues attended a business meeting with all the
  partners present.  During the meeting, he explained that we were
  evaluating whether widget animations could be supported.  The
  set-top box manufacturer immediately dismissed the idea, saying,
  'That's impossible.  Our set-top box does not support animation.'
  When the architect returned and shared this with us, I replied, 'I
  do not understand.  If I can draw a widget, I can animate it too.
  All it takes is clearing the widget and redrawing it at slightly
  different positions repeatedly.  In fact, I already have a working
  version.'  I then showed a demo of the animated widgets running on
  the emulator.
</p>
<p>
  The following week, the architect attended another partners' meeting
  where he shared updates about our animated widgets.  I was not
  personally present, so what follows is second-hand information
  passed on by those who were there.  I learnt that the set-top box
  company reacted angrily.  For some reason, they were unhappy that we
  had managed to achieve results using their set-top box and APIs that
  they had officially described as impossible.  They demanded that we
  stop work on animation immediately, arguing that our work could not
  be allowed to contradict their official position.  At that point,
  the telecom carrier's representative intervened and bluntly told the
  set-top box representative to just shut up.  If the set-top box guy
  was furious, the telecom guy was even more so, 'You guys told us
  animation was not possible and these people are showing that it is!
  You manufacture the set-top box.  How can you not know what it is
  capable of?'
</p>
<p>
  Meanwhile, I continued working on the proof of concept.  It worked
  very well in the emulator, but I did not yet have access to the
  actual hardware.  The device was still in the process of being
  shipped to us, so all my early proof-of-concepts ran on the
  emulator.  The following week, the architect planned to travel to
  the set-top box company's office to test my widgets on the real
  hardware.
</p>
<p>
  At the time, I was quite proud of demonstrating results that even
  the hardware maker believed were impossible.  When the architect
  eventually travelled to test the widgets on the actual device, a
  problem emerged.  What looked like buttery smooth animation on the
  emulator appeared noticeably choppy on a real television.  Over the
  next few weeks, I experimented with frame rates, buffering
  strategies and optimising the computation done in the the rendering
  loop.  Each week, the architect travelled for testing and returned
  with the same report: the animation had improved somewhat, but it
  still remained choppy.  The modest embedded hardware simply could
  not keep up with the required computation and rendering.  In the
  end, the telecom carrier decided that no animation was better than
  poor animation and dropped the idea altogether.  So in the end, the
  set-top box developers turned out to be correct after all.

<p>
  Back in 2009, after completing about a year at RSA Security, I began
  looking for work that felt more intellectually stimulating,
  especially projects involving mathematics and algorithms.  I spoke
  with a few senior leaders about this, but nothing materialised for
  some time.  Then one day, Dr Burt Kaliski, Chief Scientist at RSA
  Laboratories, asked to meet me to discuss my career aspirations.  I
  have written about this in more detail in another post here:
  <a href="https://susam.net/good-blessings.html">Good Blessings</a>.  I will summarise
  what followed.
</p>
<p>
  Dr Kaliski met me and offered a few suggestions about the kinds of
  teams I might approach to find more interesting work.  I followed
  his advice and eventually joined a team that turned out to be an
  excellent fit.  I remained with that team for the next six years.
  During that time, I worked on parser generators, formal language
  specification and implementation, as well as indexing and querying
  engines of a petabyte-scale database.  I learnt something new almost
  every day during those six years.  It remains one of the most
  enjoyable periods of my career.  I have especially fond memories of
  working on parser generators alongside remarkably skilled engineers
  from whom I learnt a lot.
</p>
<p>
  Years later, I reflected on how that brief meeting with Dr Kaliski
  had altered the trajectory of my career.  I realised I was not sure
  whether I had properly expressed my gratitude to him for the role he
  had played in shaping my path.  So I wrote to thank him and explain
  how much that single conversation had influenced my life.  A few
  days later, Dr Kaliski replied, saying he was glad to know that the
  steps I took afterwards had worked out well.  Before ending his
  message, he wrote this heart-warming note:
</p>
<blockquote>
  ‘One of my goals is to be able to provide encouragement to
  others who are developing their careers, just as others have
  invested in mine, passing good blessings from one generation to
  another.’
</blockquote>
<h2 id="the-ctf-scoreboard">The CTF Scoreboard<a href="#the-ctf-scoreboard"></a></h2>
<p>
  This story comes from 2019.  By then, I was no longer a
  twenty-something engineer just starting out.  I was now a
  middle-aged staff engineer with years of experience building both
  low-level networking systems and database systems.  Most of my work
  up to that point had been in C and C++.  I was now entering a new
  phase of my career where I would be leading the development of
  microservices written in Go and Python.  Like many people in this
  profession, computing has long been one of my favourite hobbies.  So
  although my professional work for the previous decade had focused on
  C and C++, I had plenty of hobby projects in other languages,
  including Python and Go.  As a result, switching gears from systems
  programming to application development was a smooth transition for
  me.  I cannot even say that I missed working in C and C++.  After
  all, who wants to spend their days occasionally chasing memory bugs
  in core dumps when you could be building features and delivering
  real value to customers?
</p>
<p>
  In October 2019, during Cybersecurity Awareness Month, a Capture the
  Flag (CTF) event was organised at our office.  The contest featured
  all kinds of technical puzzles, ranging from SQL injection
  challenges to insecure cryptography problems.  Some challenges also
  involved reversing binaries and exploiting stack overflow issues.
</p>
<p>
  I am usually rather intimidated by such contests.  The whole idea of
  competitive problem-solving under time pressure tends to make me
  nervous.  But one of my colleagues persuaded me to participate in
  the CTF.  And, somewhat to my surprise, I turned out to be rather
  good at it.  Within about eight hours, I had solved roughly 90% of
  the puzzles.  I finished at the top of the scoreboard.
</p>

</figure>
<p>
  In my younger days, I was generally known to be a good problem
  solver.  I was often consulted when thorny problems needed solving
  and I usually managed to deliver results.  I also enjoyed solving
  puzzles.  I had a knack for them and happily spent hours, sometimes
  days, working through obscure mathematical or technical puzzles and
  sharing detailed write-ups with friends of the nerd variety.  Seen
  in that light, my performance at the CTF probably should not have
  surprised me.  Still, I was very pleased.  It was reassuring to know
  that I could still rely on my systems programming experience to
  solve obscure challenges.
</p>
<p>
  During the course of the contest, my performance became something of
  a talking point in the office.  Colleagues occasionally stopped by
  my desk to appreciate my progress in the CTF.  Two much younger
  colleagues, both engineers I admired for their skill and
  professionalism, were discussing the results nearby.  They were
  speaking softly, but I could still overhear parts of their
  conversation.  Curious, I leaned slightly and listened a bit more
  carefully.  I wanted to know what these two people, whom I admired a
  lot, thought about my performance.
</p>
<p>
  One of them remarked on how well I was doing in the contest.  The
  other replied, 'Of course he is doing well.  He has more than ten
  years of experience in C.'  At that moment, I realised that no
  matter how well I solved those puzzles, the result would naturally
  be credited to experience.  In my younger days, when I solved tricky
  problems like these, people would sometimes call me smart.  Now
  people simply saw it as a consequence of my experience.  Not that I
  particularly care for labels such as 'smart' anyway, but it did make
  me realise how things had changed.  I was now simply the person with
  many years of experience.  Solving technical puzzles that involved
  disassembling binaries, tracing execution paths and reconstructing
  program logic was expected rather than remarkable.
</p>
<p>
  I continue to sharpen my technical skills to this day.  While my
  technical results may now simply be attributed to experience, I hope
  I can continue to make a good impression through my professionalism,
  ethics and kindness towards the people I work with.  If those leave
  a lasting impression, that is good enough for me.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://blog.alaindichiappari.dev/p/software-engineering-is-back">https://blog.alaindichiappari.dev/p/software-engineering-is-back</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46923543">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div dir="auto"><p>I don’t post a lot. But when I do, it’s because I think few people are saying out loud what I’m noticing.</p><p>I’ve been building a product from the ground up. Not the “I spun up a Next.js template” kind of ground up. I mean from network configuration to product design to pricing decisions. Truly end to end. And I’ve been doing it using frontier models and coding agents for hours and hours every single day, both on this project and in my full time work. I’ve been trying to stay away from the chaos and the hype, filtering hard for what is actually valuable.</p><p>Since December 2025, things have dramatically changed for the better. Many have noticed. Few are drawing the right conclusions.</p><p>Antirez likes to call it “automated programming”, and I really like that framing. It captures the essence far better than the shallow, almost dismissive label of “vibe coding”. Automation was at the core of most of the work and cultural revolutions of human history. The printing press, the loom, the assembly line. This one doesn’t differ much.</p><p>Most of my work is still there. I still have to deeply think about every important aspect of what I want to build. The architecture, the trade offs, the product decisions, the edge cases that will bite you at 3am. What’s gone is the tearing, exhausting manual labour of typing every single line of code.</p><p>At this point in time, models and tools, when put in a clean and maniacally well set up environment, can truly make the difference. I can be the architect without the wearing act of laying every single brick and spreading the mortar. I can design the dress without the act of cutting and sewing each individual piece of fabric. But I can do all of this with the experience on my back of having laid the bricks, spread the mortar, cut and sewn for twenty years. If I don’t like something, I can go in, understand it and fix it as I please, instructing once and for all my setup to do what I want next time.</p><p>Automated programming especially allows me to quickly build the tools I need so fast that every blacksmith that ever existed on this earth would envy me deeply. Finally able to really focus on the things they have in mind. Finally dedicating more time of their craft to the art they conceive, not the sweat of the forge.</p><p>It’s been months now that I have this thought crystallized in my mind. It is so clear to me that I genuinely don’t understand why everyone is not screaming it to the world.</p><p>We can finally get rid of all that middle work. That adapting layer of garbage we blindly accepted during these years. A huge amount of frameworks and libraries and tooling that has completely polluted software engineering, especially in web, mobile and desktop development. Layers upon layers of abstractions that abstract nothing meaningful, that solve problems we shouldn’t have had in the first place, that create ten new problems for every one they claim to fix.</p><p>Think about what happened. We, as an industry, looked at the genuine complexity of building software and instead of sharpening our thinking, we bought someone else’s thinking off the shelf. We wrapped everything in frameworks like wrapping a broken leg in silk. It looks nice. The leg is still broken.</p><p>In my mind, besides the self declared objectives, frameworks solve three problems. Two explicit and one obvious but never declared.</p><p><strong>“Simplification”.</strong><span> Software engineers are scared of designing things themselves. They would rather accept someone else’s structure, despite having to force fit it into their product, rather than taking the time to start from the goal and work backwards to create the perfect suit for their idea. Like an architect blindly accepting another architect’s blueprints and applying them regardless of the context, the needs, the terrain, the new technological possibilities. We decided to remove complexity not by sharpening our mental models around the products we build, but by buying a one size fits all design and applying it everywhere. That is not simplification. That is intellectual surrender.</span></p><p><strong>Automation.</strong><span> This is the only point I can actually, more or less, understand and buy. Boilerplate is boring work. I hate it. And I especially hate using libraries that I then need to study, keep updated, be aware of vulnerabilities for, just for the purpose of removing the creation of duplicated but necessary code. Think about ORMs, CRUD management, code generation, API documentation and so on. The grunt work that nobody wants to do but everybody needs done. Fair enough. But hold that thought, because this is exactly the point where everything changes.</span></p><p><strong>Labour cost.</strong><span> This is the quiet one. The one nobody puts on the conference slide. For companies, it is much better having Google, Meta, Vercel deciding for you how you build product and ship code. Adopt their framework. Pay the cost of lock in. Be enchanted by their cloud managed solution to host, deploy, store your stuff. And you unlock a feature that has nothing to do with engineering: you no longer need to hire a software engineer. You hire a React Developer. No need to train. Plug and play. Easy to replace. A cog in a machine designed by someone else, maintaining a system architected by someone else, solving problems defined by someone else. This is not engineering. This is operating.</span></p><p>In my opinion Software engineering, the true one, is back again.</p><p>I am not speaking out of my lungs only. I’ve been developing this way almost flawlessly for over two years at this point. But the true revolution happened clearly last year, and since December 2025 this is obvious to anyone paying attention. From now on it will be even more so.</p><p>We have the chance again to get rid of useless complexity and keep working on the true and welcome complexity of our ideas, our features, our products. The complexity that matters. The complexity that is actually yours.</p><p>Automation and boilerplating have never been so cheap to overcome. I’ve been basically never writing twice the same line of code. I’m instantly building small tools I need, purpose built, exactly shaped around the problem at hand. I don’t need any fancy monorepo manager. A simple Makefile covers 100% of my needs for 99% of my use cases. When things will get very complicated, and if they get very complicated, I’ll think about it. But only then. Not a second before. This is engineering. You solve the problem you have, not the problem someone on a conference stage told you that you’ll eventually have.</p><p>Agents are really well prepared when it comes to basic tools. Tools that have been around not for months, but literally for decades. Bash was born in 1989, just preceding me by two months. The most mediocre model running at this time knows bash better than any person in the world. Bash is the universal adapter. It is not a coincidence that coding agents are shifting from complex and expensive MCP configurations to a simple agent loop with bash as a way to interact, literally, with the world. The oldest tool turned out to be the most future proof. There’s a lesson in there if you care to listen.</p><p>Really think about it.</p><p>Why do you ever need, for most of the use cases you can think of, a useless, expensive, flawed, often vulnerable framework, and the parade of libraries that comes with it, that you probably use for only 10% of its capabilities? With all the costs associated with it. From the “least” expensive: operational costs like keeping everything updated because they once again found a critical vulnerability in your Next.js version. To the most expensive one: the cost to your Design Choices. The invisible cost. The one you pay every day without even realizing it, because you’ve been paying it so long you forgot what freedom felt like.</p><p>If you keep accepting this trade off, you are not only losing the biggest opportunity we’ve seen in software engineering in decades. You are probably not recognizing your own laziness in once again buying whatever the hyperscalers have decided for you. You’re letting Google and Meta and Vercel be your architect, your designer, your thinker. And in exchange, you get to be their operator.</p><p>The tools are here. The models are here. The revolution already happened and most people are still decorating the old house.</p><p>Stop wrapping broken legs in silk. Start building things that are yours.</p></div></article></div><div><div id="discussion"><h4>Discussion about this post</h4></div><div><h3>Ready for more?</h3></div></div></div>]]></description>
