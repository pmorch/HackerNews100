      <p>Messaging platform Discord has said the official ID photos of around 70,000 users have been stolen by hackers.</p><p>The app, which is popular with gamers and teenagers, said the hackers targeted a firm responsible for verifying the ages of its users. Discord said its own platform was not breached.</p>
<p>The stolen data could include personal information, partial credit card numbers and messages with Discord's customer service agents, the firm said.</p><p>No full credit card details, passwords or messages and activity beyond conversations with Discord customer support were leaked, it added.</p><p>Discord said it had revoked the third-party service's access and was continuing to investigate. It said all affected users have been contacted.</p>
<p>"Looking ahead, we recommend impacted users stay alert when receiving messages or other communication that may seem suspicious," it said.</p><p>Until recently, a hack like this could not have happened, because companies had no need to process and collect proofs of age.</p>    <div data-component-name="sdc-article-related-stories">

<p>Now, so many governments are following the UK and introducing age verification for unsuitable or pornographic content that a company like Discord has to roll out age checks for a decent portion of its 200 million active users.</p><p>It's a bit like the way that shops have to check your age if you're buying alcohol - only because it's online, it comes with a lot of additional complications.</p>

<p>A shop, for instance, won't keep a copy of your passport once they've checked your age.</p><p>And it definitely won't keep it in a massive (yet strangely light) safe along with thousands of other passport photocopies, stored right by its front door, ready to be taken.</p><p>Online, it's surprisingly easy to do just that.</p><p><strong>Read more on Sky News:</strong><br><a href="https://news.sky.com/story/how-ai-is-driving-a-distortion-of-reality-when-it-comes-to-how-women-are-presented-online-13447270" target="_blank"><strong>AI 'distorting women online'</strong></a><br><a href="https://news.sky.com/story/do-we-need-digital-ids-in-the-uk-13438109" target="_blank"><strong>Pros and cons of digital IDs</strong></a><br><a href="https://news.sky.com/story/tamed-algorithms-and-plummeting-pornography-views-impact-of-new-online-safety-rules-revealed-one-month-on-13416556" target="_blank"><strong>Impact of new online safety rules</strong></a></p>     <a href="https://news.sky.com/download-app" target="blank" data-tracking-label="ui-app-promo-download-link" data-type="" data-component-name="ui-app-promo" data-testid="app-promo">

<p>It's worth noting that the age verification system used by Discord wasn't hacked itself. That system asked people to take a photo of themselves, then used software to estimate their age. Once the check was complete, the image was immediately deleted.</p><p>The problem came with the appeals part of the process, which was supplied to Discord by a third party.</p><p>If someone thought that the age verification system had wrongly barred them from Discord they could send in a picture of their ID to prove their age. This collection of images was hacked. As a result, Discord says, more than 70,000 IDs are now in the possession of hackers.</p><p>(The hackers themselves claim that the number is much bigger - 2,185,151 photos. Discord says this is wrong and the hackers are simply trying to extort money. It's a messy situation.)</p>     
<p>There are ways to make age verification safer. Companies could stop storing photo ID, for instance (although then it would be impossible to know for sure if their checks were correct).</p><p>And advocates of ID cards will point out that a proper government ID could avoid the need to send pictures of your passport simply to prove your age. You'd use your digital ID instead, which would stay safely on your device.</p><p>But the best way to stop data being hacked is not to collect it in the first place.</p><p>We're at the start of a defining test - can governments actually police the internet? Or will the measures that are supposed to make us safer actually end up making us less secure?</p>

				I uploaded a photo on my phone to Microsoft's "OneDrive" file-hosting app — and there was a surprise waiting under <em>Privacy and Permissions.</em>  "OneDrive uses AI to recognize faces in your photos..."</p><p> 
And... </p><p> 
"You can only turn off this setting 3 times a year."</p><p> 
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/G6tmCiS.png" alt="*" width="500"></p><p> 

If I moved the slidebar for that setting to the left (for "No"), it moved back to the right, and said "Something went wrong while updating this setting." (Apparently it's not one of those three times of the year.)</p><p> 

The feature is already rolling out to a limited number of users in a preview, a Microsoft publicist confirmed to Slashdot. (For the record, I don't remember signing up for this face-recognizing "preview".) But there's a link at the bottom of the screen for a "Microsoft Privacy Statement" that leads to <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/group-photos-by-people-21065f48-c746-48ad-a98a-cbe4631631bc">a Microsoft support page</a>, which says instead that "This feature is coming soon and is yet to be released."  And in the next sentence it's been saying "Stay tuned for more updates"  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20231109163626/https://support.microsoft.com/">for almost two years</a>...</p><p> 

A Microsoft publicist <a href="https://hardware.slashdot.org/story/25/10/11/0238213/microsofts-onedrive-begins-testing-face-recognizing-ai-for-photos-for-some-preview-users#microsoft_spokesperson">agreed to answer Slashdot's questions</a>...</p></div>

		
			<p><span><p>  <a name="microsoft_spokesperson"> </a> <strong>Slashdot:</strong> What's the reason OneDrive tells users this setting can only be turned off 3 times a year?   (And are those any three times — or does that mean three specific days, like Christmas, New Year's Day, etc.)</p><p> 

[Microsoft's publicist chose not to answer this question.]</p><p> 

<strong>Slashdot:</strong>  If I move the slidebar to the left (for "No"), it moves back to the right, and says "Something went wrong while updating this setting."   So is it correct to say that there's no way for users to select  "No" now?</p><p> 

<strong>Microsoft:</strong> We haven't heard about the experience you are having with toggling, but our Microsoft contacts would like to investigate why this is happening for you. Can you share what type of device you are using, so we can put you in touch with the right team?</p><p> 
<strong>Slashdot:</strong>  Is this feature really still "coming soon"?   Can you give me more specific details on when "soon" will be?</p><p> 
<strong>Microsoft:</strong>  This feature is currently rolling out to limited users in a preview so we can learn and improve. We have nothing more to share at this time.</p><p> 

<strong>Slashdot:</strong>  I want to confirm something about how this feature is "yet to be released."  Does this mean that currently OneDrive is not (and has never) used AI to "recognize" faces in photos?</p><p> 
<strong>Microsoft:</strong>  Privacy is built into all Microsoft OneDrive experiences. Microsoft OneDrive services adhere to the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/privacy/privacystatement">Microsoft Privacy Statement</a> and follow Microsoft's compliance with <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/compliance/regulatory/gdpr">General Data Protection Regulation</a> and the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/trust-center/privacy/european-data-boundary-eudb">Microsoft EU Data Boundary</a>.</p><p> 
<strong>Slashdot:</strong>  Some privacy advocates prefer "opt-in" features, but it looks like here OneDrive is planning a (limited) opt-out feature.  What is the reasoning for going with opt-out rather than opt-in?</p><p> 
<strong>Microsoft:</strong> Microsoft OneDrive inherits privacy features and settings from Microsoft 365 and SharePoint, where applicable.</p><p> 

Slashdot also spoke to EFF security/privacy activist Thorin Klosowski, who expressed concerns. "Any feature related to privacy really should be opt-in and companies should provide clear documentation so its users can understand the risks and benefits to make that choice for themselves."</p><p> 

Microsoft's "three times a year" policy also seemed limiting to Klosowski.  "People should also be able to change those settings at-will whenever possible because we all encounter circumstances were we need to re-evaluate and possibly change our privacy settings."</p></span>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
							<p>After the <a href="https://reason.com/2025/09/11/charlie-kirk-assassinated/">murder</a> of conservative activist Charlie Kirk in September, many on the political right set out to <a href="https://reason.com/2025/09/16/the-perverse-incentives-for-snitch-tagging-teachers-who-criticized-charlie-kirk/?nab=0">punish</a> anyone making light of the tragedy, or even simply being insufficiently upset. In one of the more brazen examples, a Tennessee man was arrested, accused of threatening a school shooting, and held on a $2 million bond, for posting a somewhat uncivil meme on Facebook.</p> <p>Larry Bushart, a 61-year-old former police officer, <a href="https://www.wsmv.com/2025/09/22/former-officer-accused-posting-threatening-meme-referencing-school-shooting-tn/">posted</a> the offending meme last month. In <a href="https://www.tennessean.com/story/news/2025/09/23/tennessee-larry-bushart-arrest-charlie-kirk/86313013007/">response</a> to a Facebook post about an upcoming vigil for Kirk, Bushart shared an <a href="https://x.com/aaronterr1/status/1970272191884468241">image</a> of President Donald Trump with the quote, "We have to get over it," which Trump <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-tells-supporters-get-iowa-school-shooting-move-forward-rcna132610">said</a> in January 2024 after a shooting at Iowa's Perry High School. Text added to the image said, "This seems relevant today."</p> <p>Bushart did not elaborate, but the context seems clear: <em>Why should I care about this shooting, when the sitting president said I should "get over" this other shooting?</em></p> <p>The image was one of <a href="https://wopclive.linkedupradio.com/assets/images/2025/IMG_7383.webp">several</a> Bushart posted, and it was far from the most offensive. Still, it certainly feels crass; as people mourned a brutal public murder, Bushart snidely used the occasion to make a partisan political point. But it's certainly well within the bounds of average social media discourse, and you certainly wouldn't expect it to bring the attention of the local police.</p> <p>"Received a visit from Lexington PD regarding my posted memes," Bushart wrote in a September 21 <a href="https://www.facebook.com/share/p/1BAP29mMvt/">Facebook status</a>. <a href="https://www.tennessean.com/story/news/2025/09/23/tennessee-larry-bushart-arrest-charlie-kirk/86313013007/">According to</a> Sheriff Nick Weems of nearby Perry County, "numerous…teachers, parents and students"&nbsp;somehow interpreted Bushart's meme—with its citation in fine print about a previous school shooting at Perry High School in Perry, Iowa—as a threat to carry out a similar shooting at nearby Perry County High School.</p> <p>According to the Perry County Sheriff's Office <a href="https://isoms.perrycountysheriff.net/portal/Jail?hours=0&amp;lname=B">website</a>, Bushart was arrested the following morning on a charge of Threats of Mass Violence on School Property and Activities—a class E <a href="https://law.justia.com/codes/tennessee/title-39/chapter-16/part-5/section-39-16-517/">felony</a> <a href="https://codes.findlaw.com/tn/title-40-criminal-procedure/tn-code-sect-40-35-111/">punishable</a> by between one and six years in prison and up to a $3,000 fine.

Even just to get out of jail ahead of trial, state law says Bushart would have to pay a bondsman at least $210,000.</p> <p>The Perry County Circuit Court <a href="https://perry.tncrtinfo.com/crCaseForm.aspx?id=ADDFC002-5567-44CA-B209-DA2909E6869F&amp;dsid=fd8e7548">website</a> indicates Bushart had a motion hearing scheduled for October 9, but when reached by phone Friday, a court clerk told <em>Reason</em> the hearing was "reset" for December 4.</p> <p>Bushart posted the Trump meme "to indicate or make the audience think it was referencing our Perry High School," Weems <a href="https://www.tennessean.com/story/news/2025/09/23/tennessee-larry-bushart-arrest-charlie-kirk/86313013007/">told&nbsp;<em>The Tennesseean</em></a> in a statement. "Investigators believe Bushart was fully aware of the fear his post would cause and intentionally sought to create hysteria within the community." Weems <a href="https://wopclive.com/local-news/808311/sheriff-man-arrested-for-mass-violence-threats-following-facebook-post">also told</a> local radio station WOPC the meme "eluded [<em>sic</em>] to a hypothetical shooting at a place called Perry High School."</p> <p>This justification is downright laughable. In its entirety, the post consists of a direct quote of a statement by the then-former president about a newsworthy event, with text providing context, plus a four-word phrase added. Bushart didn't even create the meme: <em>The Tennesseean</em>'s Angele Latham noted it had been "posted numerous times across multiple social media platforms not connected to Bushart going back to 2024."</p> <p>"Quote the President of the United States, go to jail," Adam Steinbaugh, an attorney with the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, <a href="https://x.com/adamsteinbaugh/status/1976087431947649466">posted</a> on X.</p> <p>In context, it's clear Bushart meant to suggest that since Trump previously said people should "get over" a school shooting, then they shouldn't be expected to care about the murder of a conservative public figure. It's quite a stretch to suggest this constituted a threat to shoot up a high school. Yes, a nearby high school happened to have a similar name, but that was clearly a coincidence, and there is nothing to suggest Bushart intended to carry out violence against the local school.</p> <p>On social media, some have <a href="https://x.com/politicalmath/status/1976276224197730800">suggested</a> the meme in question was part of a larger pattern indicating Bushart posed a threat. But in his <a href="https://www.tennessean.com/story/news/2025/09/23/tennessee-larry-bushart-arrest-charlie-kirk/86313013007/">statement</a> to <em>The Tennesseean</em>, Weems specifically singled out the Trump meme as the offender, saying while the other posts were "hate memes," they were "not against the law and would be recognized as free speech."</p> <p>Perhaps some teachers, parents, or students really did find Bushart's post threatening—though since it was a reply on a Facebook page for local news, it's not clear how many people even saw it. And even if people did see and interpret it as a threat of violence, that doesn't mean it meets the standard for a "true threat," in violation of the First Amendment.</p> <p>"True threats are not protected speech but not everything is a true threat," David Hudson, professor at Belmont University School of Law, tells <em>Reason</em>. "This seems to me to be heated rhetorical hyperbole, which is an incredibly important concept—or should be—in true threat-type cases."</p> <p>The U.S. Supreme Court created the true threat exception to the First Amendment in the 1969 decision <a href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/394/705/"><em>Watts v. United States</em></a>. Even then, Hudson adds, it made the point of distinguishing between true threats and "crude political hyperbole"—in that case, a protester's remark that if he were drafted into the Army, "the first man I want to get in my sights is" then-President Lyndon Johnson. The court agreed with the plaintiff that it was not a true threat but simply "a kind of very crude offensive method of stating a political opposition to the President."</p> <p>"Suppression of speech as an effective police measure is an old, old device, outlawed by our Constitution," Justice William O. Douglas wrote in a concurring opinion.</p> <p>Bushart's arrest would be humorous if it weren't so serious. He now faces a potential years-long prison sentence for reposting a Facebook meme that doesn't come anywhere close to qualifying as an exception to the First Amendment. Even if the case gets thrown out, he has already spent two weeks in jail and is set to spend two more months until his first hearing.</p>						</div></div>]]></description>

      <h2>Social Medicine</h2>
      <p><strong>GNU Health as a social movement</strong>: GNU Health is a social project with technology behind. It’s about Social Medicine and delivering universal healthcare. It’s about social activism. One of the main reasons that led me to create GNU Health were the tremendous inequalities in access to healthcare. Over 20000 children die every day from preventable, social diseases. To name a few : malnutrition, contaminated water, child slavery, prostitution, war, malaria, HIV-AIDS, tuberculosis, dengue and other neglected tropical diseases. These are causes and/or results of social diseases, conditions that have a higher impact and higher prevalence on the poor and the underprivileged.</p>

<p>Studying and getting a deeper understanding on the living conditions of people in rural areas and in urban ghettos around the world, reinforced my intention to write a system that included the socio-economic determinants of health and disease. Most of the time, health (and the lack of) is determined by the environment, and biology plays a lesser role. Proper nutrition, housing, sanitation, access to education and to primary healthcare are key for the dignity, development and health of the individual, family and society at large. I like to summarize it as <strong>“people before patients”</strong></p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://mitchellh.com/writing/non-trivial-vibing">https://mitchellh.com/writing/non-trivial-vibing</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45549434">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I recently shipped a
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/pull/9116">non-trivial Ghostty feature (unobtrusive macOS automatic updates)</a>
that was <em>largely</em> developed with AI.</p>
<p>I'm regularly asked to share non-trivial examples of how I use
AI and agentic coding tools and this felt like a golden opportunity to
walk through my process with a well-scoped, non-trivial, real-world,
shipping feature<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-6" id="user-content-fnref-6" data-footnote-ref="true" aria-describedby="footnote-label">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>This post will share every single agentic coding session I had on the path
to shipping this feature, unedited and in full. Alongside it, I'll provide
some additional context about my process and reasoning. And yes, I'll also
share the token cost for those curious about that, too.</p>
<div><p><strong>Important: there is a lot of human coding, too.</strong> I almost always go in after an AI does work
and iterate myself for awhile, too. Rather than say that at every turn, I'm just saying it once
here. Therefore, you may see some discrepancies between what the AI produced and what ended up in
the final code. This is intentional and I believe good AI drivers are experts in their domains and
utilize AI as an assistant, not a replacement.</p></div>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-feature">The Feature</h2>
<p>The finished feature this blog post is about is the macOS unobtrusive
update notification feature. This feature shows update status within the
terminal window without interrupting work by creating windows, grabbing
focus, etc.</p>

<p>Let's set the stage for what lead to this feature (pun intended, as you'll see shortly).
During a high-profile OpenAI keynote, a demo was rudely interrupted by
a Ghostty update prompt:</p>
<p><img alt="OpenAI Demo" loading="lazy" width="1400" height="726" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://mitchellh.com/_next/image?url=%2Fstatic%2Fimages%2Fopenai-demo.png&amp;w=1920&amp;q=75 1x, https://mitchellh.com/_next/image?url=%2Fstatic%2Fimages%2Fopenai-demo.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 2x" src="https://mitchellh.com/_next/image?url=%2Fstatic%2Fimages%2Fopenai-demo.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75"></p>
<p>I wanted to ensure that never happened again<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-2" id="user-content-fnref-2" data-footnote-ref="true" aria-describedby="footnote-label">2</a></sup>. The path I decided to
take was to make update notifications <em>unobtrusive</em>. Instead of popping up
a window, the app would instead show a small, non-modal GUI element somewhere
that wouldn't interrupt the user.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="pre-ai-planning">Pre-AI Planning</h2>
<p><del>So I pulled out my AI tooling.</del> <strong>Absolutely not.</strong> I began by coming up
with a rough plan of how I wanted this to work. Ghostty uses
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://sparkle-project.org/">Sparkle</a>, an extremely popular macOS update framework.
I poked around their docs and found that they support
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://sparkle-project.github.io/documentation/api-reference/">custom UI through Obj-C protocols</a>.
You have to reimplement a ton of stuff from scratch, but it is possible.</p>
<p>Okay, so I had a rough idea of <em>backend</em>. For <em>frontend</em>, I wasn't really
sure (and it isn't my area of expertise). I had this really vague idea
that it should be a little button embedded in the title bar, and I know
macOS supports custom UI in the titlebar via
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nswindow/addtitlebaraccessoryviewcontroller(_:)">titlebar accessory controllers</a>,
but beyond that I didn't have much of a sense of how it should look or feel.</p>
<p>But that's enough to get started. AI is a very good prototyper, so even
knowing what you don't know is useful enough to get started. I had a strong
enough sense of the big picture.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="first-session-prototyping-the-ui">First Session: Prototyping the UI</h2>
<p>Here is my <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://ampcode.com/threads/T-9fc3eb88-5aa2-45e4-8f6d-03697f53102d">first agentic coding session</a>,
with the starting prompt:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I want to enable custom, unobtrusive update notifications and installs
by customizing SPUUserDriver. Let's start by planning the custom UI we'll
need. We'll ONLY work on UI. Create a plan for creating SwiftUI views that
can show the various states that are required by SPUUserDriver. I think the
best place for these to show up is in the macOS window titlebars on the
top-right. Create a plan to put it there. Consult the oracle.</p>
</blockquote>
<div><p>Frequent question: "What is the oracle?" It is an <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://ampcode.com/news/oracle">Amp-specific read-only
subagent</a> that uses a slower, higher-cost model that is generally
better at thinking about things. I consult the oracle for all planning.</p></div>
<p>To start, I decided to prototype the UI first.</p>
<p>Notice here that I don't send the agent off to <em>build the full feature</em>.
There are a couple reasons for this. First and foremost, I still don't
even know what I want the UI/UX to be like, so I can't possibly coherently
expect an AI to do that for me amongst other changes. Second, smaller
chunks of work are easier to review, understand, and iterate on.</p>
<p>Another thing to notice is that I ask it to only create a plan and not
to write any code. Since this is a relatively vague request, it's important
that I review a plan before it goes off and does a ton of work (and
spends a ton of tokens doing it).</p>
<div><p><strong>Tip:</strong> Creating a comprehensive plan interactively with an agent is a really important
first-step for anything non-trivial. I usually also save it out (via the agent) to something like
<code>spec.md</code> and in future sessions I can say "Consult the @spec.md and work on <em>some task</em>".</p></div>
<p>The agent came up with an <em>agreeable enough</em> plan that I let it go ahead
and implement it. You can see the rest of my conversations as I iterate on
that.</p>
<p><strong>The UI it made was directionally very good.</strong> It had a <em>ton</em> of polish
issues (spacing, colors, etc.) but seeing the UI gave me the spark of
inspiration I needed to know what I wanted.</p>
<div><p><strong>Tip:</strong> I very often use AI for inspiration. In this case, I ended up keeping a lot (not all) of
the UI code it made, but I will very often prompt an agent, throw away everything it did, and redo
it myself (manually!). I find the "zero to one" stage of creation very difficult and time
consuming and AI is excellent at being my muse.</p></div>
<h3 id="hitting-a-wall">Hitting a Wall</h3>
<p>You can see in chats 11 to 14 that we're entering the <em>slop zone</em>.
The code the agent created has a critical bug, and it's absolutely
failing to fix it. And I have no idea how to fix it, either.</p>
<p>I'll often make these few hail mary attempts to fix a bug. If the
agent can figure it out, I can study it and learn myself. If it doesn't,
it costs me very little. If the agent figures it out and I don't understand it,
I back it out. I'm not shipping code I don't understand.
While it's failing, I'm also tabbed out searching the issue and trying to
figure it out myself.</p>
<p>It's at this point that I know I need to step back, review what it did,
and come up with my own plans. It's time to educate myself and think
critically. AI is no longer the solution; it is a liability.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="cleanup-sessions">Cleanup Sessions</h2>
<p>I spend the next few sessions guiding the agent to clean up the code.</p>
<p>The <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://ampcode.com/threads/T-cad10729-a348-4dc6-9297-e1130a12f5da">second session</a>
focused on moving some methods around into better places I recognized:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Let's move the pill background, foreground, and badge functions from
@macos/Sources/Features/Update/UpdateAccessoryView.swift to
@macos/Sources/Features/Update/UpdateViewModel.swift and make them more
generic (background, foreground, badge)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://ampcode.com/threads/T-ae7a7144-6293-4bf6-af24-982b8ff09984">third session</a>
added documentation to the code:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Update the docs for @UpdateBadge.swift</p>
</blockquote>
<div><p><strong>Tip:</strong> Adding documentation is a really important step because it helps reaffirm your own
understanding of the code as well as educate future agents that may read and modify this code. I
find agents do much better when they have both natural language descriptions as well as the code
itself.</p></div>
<p>The <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://ampcode.com/threads/T-af16fe85-bdc5-4fcb-b7e7-dbc425ca5da7">fourth session</a>
moves the view model to an app-global location, since the original
work put it in a window scope and update information is app scoped.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Move the update view model data to AppDelegate since the update information
will be app-global.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Throughout these, I am usually dropping in and making minor manual
changes as well.</p>
<p>The cleanup step is really important. To cleanup effectively you have
to have a pretty good understanding of the code, so this forces me to
not blindly accept AI-written code. Subsequently, better organized and
documented code helps future agentic sessions perform better.</p>
<p>I sometimes tongue-in-cheek refer to this as the "anti-slop session".</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="facing-the-bug">Facing "The Bug"</h2>
<p>Time to get back to that bug that I found in that initial session.
I once again spent a few sessions trying to get the agent to figure this
out. I start vague, and slowly get more specific with how I'd approach it.</p>
<p>First, the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://ampcode.com/threads/T-5b64618e-3884-4bf9-87cb-e041f755279f">vague session</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For standard, native tabs, the update accesory view is not visible.
It should remain visible in the titlebar of the window.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Failure. Then, I <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://ampcode.com/threads/T-0230ecf6-4d77-48da-99e8-ffeb35d3163b">get more specific</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We need to update @macos/Sources/Features/Terminal/Window Styles/TerminalTabsTitlebarTahoe.swift
tab bar constraints to align the right edge of the tab bar with the left
edge of the update accessory view so it remains visible.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Failure. Then, I <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://ampcode.com/threads/T-2b5aecbe-7a48-4a4e-b5ad-c355b751042b">try a different, specific approach</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What if we changed the @macos/Sources/Features/Terminal/Window Styles/TitlebarTabsTahoeTerminalWindow.swift
to make the tab bar a top accessory view rather than a bottom one to make
our tabs go into the titlebar?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Failure. One <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://ampcode.com/threads/T-47dbc7c1-796a-45b4-ba21-3385cc89411a">last attempt</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The "right accessory view" and layout of @macos/Sources/Features/Terminal/Window Styles/TitlebarTabsTahoeTerminalWindow.swift
is conflictig with the update accessory view setup in
@macos/Sources/Features/Terminal/Window Styles/TerminalWindow.swift Can we
constrain the tab bar to always appear left of the update notice?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Failure.</p>
<p>This whole time, I've also spent time trying to solve this myself through
manual research and human effort. My more specific prompts are based on
things I've learned through that process. But overall, it was clearly
not working.</p>
<p>I don't think I can figure this out on my own, so I decide to pivot.
I decided that for these problematic titlebar styles, let's put the update
notices in the bottom-right corner of the window overlaid on top of the
content view rather than in the titlebar.</p>
<p>I need to support this <em>anyways</em> because Ghostty has a configuration
to hide the titlebar entirely. So, even if I can solve the titlebar
styling issue later, I still need to support this other mode.</p>
<p>My <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://ampcode.com/threads/T-69675325-c5e3-497a-b692-0176744069e9">next session</a>
moves forward with this plan with a very specific prompt:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Augment the @macos/Sources/Features/Update system to also support an overlay
approach in @macos/Sources/Features/Terminal/TerminalView.swift The update
notice should appear at the bottom of the window. It should go over the
text (so it doesn't resize the terminal view). All clicking behaviors
should otherwise be the same as the accessory view.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It did a really good job with this. I did a lot of manual polish after
(moving stuff around, renaming things, etc.) but the core work was solid.</p>
<p>Here is a video of the feature shortly after this session, showcasing
how the update notice appears in the bottom-right corner of the window
for certain titlebar styles or when the titlebar is hidden:</p>

<hr>
<h2 id="starting-the-backend">Starting the Backend</h2>
<p>The UI was feeling <em>good enough</em>. I had noted a bunch of polish issues
I wanted to tackle later but I wanted to move on to the backend work
primarily to see if I'd discover any unknown unknowns that threw a
wrench in my plans.</p>
<p>I manually created a file with a scaffold of incomplete functions and
various <code>TODO</code> comments. I then started
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://ampcode.com/threads/T-d812d8a2-b7af-47ca-a91b-5ce3a18068b2">a session to complete that work for me</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Complete the @macos/Sources/Features/Update/UpdateDriver.swift Read the
Sparkle documentaiton as necessary to understand the functionality.
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://sparkle-project.org/documentation/api-reference/Protocols.html">https://sparkle-project.org/documentation/api-reference/Protocols.html</a></p>
</blockquote>
<div><p><strong>Tip:</strong> AI is very good at fill-in-the-blank or draw-the-rest-of-the-owl. My pattern here of
creating scaffolding with descriptive function names, parameters, todo comments, etc. is a really
common one for me and it works very well.</p></div>
<p>It actually did a <strong>really bad job here</strong> and I ended up throwing
all of this code away. The code it produced <em>worked</em>, but it was obviously
the wrong approach. It conflated a lot of different concerns and the
way it was storing state in the driver was clearly wrong.</p>
<p>When I studied what it did, I realized it was because the view model was
structured in a suboptimal way, so I switched gears into cleanup mode to
give AI (and humans, if I chose to write it myself) the better framework to
work with.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="cleanup-again-big-time">Cleanup Again, Big Time</h2>
<p>Experience has taught me that the cleanliness of a UI frontend and business
logic backend is often dictated by the quality of the view model in between.
So I spent some time manually restructured the view model. This involved
switching to a tagged union rather than the struct with a bunch of
optionals. I renamed some types, moved stuff around.</p>
<p>I knew from experience that this small bit of manual work in the middle
would set the agents up for success in future sessions for both the
frontend and backend. After completing it, I continued with a marathon set of
cleanup sessions.</p>
<p>After doing the restructuring, the first thing I did was
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://ampcode.com/threads/T-29c43cfa-5b00-420d-9490-ce16cea29103">ask the agent to once again complete the owl</a>,
this time inspecting my changes and updating dependent code to the new
style and removing the old:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Update @macos/Sources/Features/Update/UpdateViewModel.swift to use the
new <code>UpdateState</code> exclusively. Rename <code>state2</code> to <code>state</code> (remove the old state).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then I <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://ampcode.com/threads/T-5c8f7208-fcad-4f62-a212-65c7c2d61346">asked it remove additional dead code</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I think we can get rid of UpdateUIActions. They're not used anymore since
our UpdateState has callbacks.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then I broke the build myself cleaning up some things. I had a
meeting to hop onto so I decided to
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://ampcode.com/threads/T-214e0715-3fbb-42ee-9ad7-bc3ded364f36">let the agent fix it while I was busy</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Run the build and fix the errors</p>
</blockquote>
<div><p><strong>Tip:</strong> "I broke a bunch of things, please fix my mess." is another frequent use case I have for
agents. I'd say generally this fits within the same fill-in-the-blank pattern as before.</p></div>
<p>Later, I started doing some <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://ampcode.com/threads/T-3ff3649d-4610-4bbe-8c2a-7875b03e9a5d">refactors on some of the views again</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Turn each @macos/Sources/Features/Update/UpdatePopoverView.swift case into a
dedicated fileprivate Swift view that takes the typed value as its parameter
so that we can remove the guards.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://ampcode.com/threads/T-0477a9aa-e1ff-4df0-bf16-eed5131b6c14">More cleanup</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Change <code>iconName</code> in @macos/Sources/Features/Update/UpdateViewModel.swift to
be an optional, return nil for blank. Update usage.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<h2 id="simulation">Simulation</h2>
<p>In my first UI session, I had the agent create some demo code so I could
see the UI in action without real update checks. But update flows have
a number of scenarios and up to this point I only tested the happy path.</p>
<p>In my <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://ampcode.com/threads/T-a2faf4af-c67b-47a5-99d1-b1a0f957cafb">next session</a>
I extracted the simulation code into a dedicated file and asked the agent
to create more scenarios:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Extract the update simulation code in @macos/Sources/App/macOS/AppDelegate.swift
into a dedicated file in @macos/Sources/Features/Update . This should
contain multiple simulation scenarios (happy path, not found, errors, etc.)
so that we can easily try different demos.</p>
</blockquote>
<div><p><strong>Tip:</strong> Agents are great at generating tests and simulations. The simulation code specifically
that it generated here is honestly pretty gross but it works and it's not part of the release
binary so the quality doesn't matter to me. I didn't even bother cleaning it up beyond the basics
you can see in the session.</p></div>
<p>I then ran the various simulations and found a number of UX improvements.</p>

<h2 id="last-mile">Last Mile</h2>
<p>At this point, I had a working backend and frontend and I needed to
hook it all up.</p>
<p>My <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://ampcode.com/threads/T-6968a022-f1a2-4011-806a-1060e8e8fd81">next session</a>
prompted the agent to do this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Make an <code>UpdateController</code> class the same as
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/sparkle-project/Sparkle/blob/2.x/Sparkle/SPUStandardUpdaterController.m">https://github.com/sparkle-project/Sparkle/blob/2.x/Sparkle/SPUStandardUpdaterController.m</a>
but for our updater types.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This required some back and forth and manual polish, but it got there.</p>
<p>I then <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://ampcode.com/threads/T-fce4f9e0-7bb4-4930-b2b1-34fd600bc242">made some minor improvements</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For our update available state with the appcast, look at
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://sparkle-project.org/documentation/api-reference/Classes/SUAppcastItem.html">https://sparkle-project.org/documentation/api-reference/Classes/SUAppcastItem.html</a>
and show other relevant metadata if its set. For example, content length for
size.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="anything-else">Anything Else?</h2>
<p>My <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://ampcode.com/threads/T-e4cc70f0-d222-4c40-a1e7-745025e3dc9c">last prompt to an agent</a>
is always to ask what else I might be missing.
<strong>I do this regardless of if I manually wrote the code myself or not.</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Are there any other improvements you can see to be made with the
@macos/Sources/Features/Update feature? Don't write any code. Consult the
oracle. Consider parts of the code that can also get more unit tests added.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This highlighted some real issues, so I went ahead and asked it to
implement them. I find its easier to tell the agent "okay just do it all"
rather than ask it specific things to do, since I can always easily clean
it up in selective commits later.</p>
<p>An amusing thing in this session is that the agent started going down
a really crazy rabbit hole and so I stepped in to stop it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Stop stop stop. Undo all the main actor stuff.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I also noticed that it did something rather poorly when there is
a better way:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For the error message, instead of truncating, isn't there a SwiftUI standard
way to do this? We should add an additional UI element they can use to view
the whole message.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="cost-and-time">Cost and Time</h2>
<p>The work took a total of <strong>16 separate sessions</strong> totalling <strong>$15.98</strong> in
token spend on Amp<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-4" id="user-content-fnref-4" data-footnote-ref="true" aria-describedby="footnote-label">3</a></sup>. I won't try to speculate whether this is expensive
or cheap in general, but I will say for me personally I spent more than that
in coffee shops in the two calendar days I spent on this feature.</p>
<p>The total "wall clock" time I spent on this feature I estimate around
8 hours. I only spend around 4 hours a day on the computer the first
and last commit span 3 days. But I also didn't spend all of my time on this
feature. For example, I <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://ghostty.org/docs/install/release-notes/1-2-2">shipped a Ghostty update</a>,
was a guest on <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.twitch.tv/theprimeagen">ThePrimeagen</a> for an hour,
and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://x.com/adam_chal/status/1976527358099337325">gave a guest presentation at Zoo's annual all-hands</a>,
all during the hours I have available for "computer work" during the
same days I was working on this feature<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-5" id="user-content-fnref-5" data-footnote-ref="true" aria-describedby="footnote-label">4</a></sup>. So, I think the 8 hour estimate
is generous.</p>
<p>Many people on the internet argue whether AI enables you to work faster
or not. In this case, I think I shipped this faster than I would have if I
had done it all myself, in particular because iterating on minor SwiftUI
styling is so tedious and time consuming for me personally and AI does
it so well.</p>
<p>I think the faster/slower argument for me personally is missing the thing
I like the most: the AI can work for me while I step away to do other things.
Here is a picture I took of one of my cleanup sessions while I was making
breakfast for my family:</p>
<p><img alt="Vibing and Cooking" loading="lazy" width="1400" height="1050" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://mitchellh.com/_next/image?url=%2Fstatic%2Fimages%2Fvibing-breakfast.jpeg&amp;w=1920&amp;q=75 1x, https://mitchellh.com/_next/image?url=%2Fstatic%2Fimages%2Fvibing-breakfast.jpeg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 2x" src="https://mitchellh.com/_next/image?url=%2Fstatic%2Fimages%2Fvibing-breakfast.jpeg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75"></p>
<div><p>There's all sorts of dismissals about this, such as "I don't want to be coding while I'm cooking"
or "Be more present" or whatever. If that's how you want to be, that's fine. In my case, in this
specific example, I'm the first person awake in my household and I prep breakfast while everyone
else is still asleep. I don't do this every waking moment.</p></div>
<p>All this is to say: it works for me. I'm really, really not trying to <em>convince you</em>. I'm
not associated financially with any AI company. But as someone who has
a lot of success with AI tooling and likes to talk about it, people
ask me to share examples all the time. That's what I'm doing here.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="end">End</h2>
<p>I think the feature is beautiful, works great, and after a final manual
review I merged it<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-7" id="user-content-fnref-7" data-footnote-ref="true" aria-describedby="footnote-label">5</a></sup>.
For Ghostty users who are on the tip release, it is available now.
For Ghostty users who are on tagged releases, this feature will be
available in Ghostty 1.3.</p>
<p>I'm an outspoken advocate about the importance of sharing agentic
coding sessions publicly<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-1" id="user-content-fnref-1" data-footnote-ref="true" aria-describedby="footnote-label">6</a></sup>, with one of the reasons being that it's an
incredibly powerful way to educate others about how to use these tools
effectively. I hope this post helps demonstrate that.</p>
<section data-footnotes="true">
<ol>
<li id="user-content-fn-6">
<p>It is currently only shipped to nightly beta testers ("tip" testers)
but that is a group of thousands of people. It is merged and will be

</li>
<li id="user-content-fn-2">
<p>Yes, it was good marketing. No, it was not on purpose. And no, I'm not
celebrating it, because you don't want users to a fear a tool will
take advantage of them. You want to trust that it's there to help.
I want presenters (or anyone, really) to <em>want</em> to use Ghostty, and
caring about stuff like this is part of that. <a href="#user-content-fnref-2" data-footnote-backref="true" aria-label="Back to content">↩</a></p>

<li id="user-content-fn-4">
<p>The most poetic though would've been to use OpenAI Codex for this.
I'm sure it would've done great! This post isn't an advertisement for

currently. <a href="#user-content-fnref-4" data-footnote-backref="true" aria-label="Back to content">↩</a></p>

<p>"Final manual review" is <em>super super super important</em>. This probably
shouldn't be a footnote, but I couldn't find a better place to emphasize it.

  <p>Firefox is an open source, private browser, one of the few mainstream browsers that supports extensions on mobile (Android) as powerful as the desktop ones (A lot of extensions have been ported), with seamless sync and a customizable homepage.</p>
<h2 id="browser-extensions">Browser Extensions</h2>
<p>There are many extensions that have improved my browsing experience dramatically, by helping me fight the <strong>bloat</strong> of modern web browsing. This is especially more important on mobile, where resources and screen space are more limited.</p>

<p>The extension store is very similar to the desktop one. My browsing use case on my phone is to read articles, look up something quickly, buy things in online stores, or just see what people are saying online. When I do that, I don’t want to see ads, and I don’t want pop-ups taking up half of my screen.
No, I don’t want to download your <strong>app</strong>,
<em>The website is fine</em>; I don’t want to talk with your AI chat. I’m not interested in receiving fake notifications either. And I might have subscribed to your newsletter if you hadn’t put a pop-up while I was midway through reading your article.</p>
<p>The following extensions have helped me in my fight against bloat and antipatterns on the web. Making my time on the web rather  a  pleasant experience</p>
<h2 id="block-ads-and-more-ublock">Block ads and more (Ublock)</h2>
<p><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/">Ublock</a>  is the best ad blocker. Besides blocking ads, it also blocks other annoyances such as mobile banners, like those super annoying ones where they tell you to download their app instead of letting you use their website</p>
<p><strong>Amazon your app sucks and I won’t use it</strong>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-astro-transition-scope="astro-s45bjlev-4"> <p>Every developer knows <code>&lt;input&gt;</code>. It’s the workhorse of the web.</p>
<p>But <code>&lt;output&gt;</code>? Most have never touched it. Some don’t even know it exists.</p>
<p>That’s a shame, because it solves something we’ve been cobbling together with <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>s and ARIA for years: dynamic results that are announced to screen readers by default.</p>
<p>It’s been in the spec for years. <em>Yet it’s hiding in plain sight</em>.</p>
<hr>
<p>Here’s what <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/form-elements.html#the-output-element">the HTML5 spec</a> says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The <code>&lt;output&gt;</code> element represents the result of a calculation performed by the application, or the result of a user action.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s mapped to <code>role="status"</code> in the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Accessibility_tree">accessibility tree</a>. In plain terms, it announces its value when it changes, as if it already had <code>aria-live="polite" aria-atomic="true"</code>.</p>
<p>In practice, that means updates do not interrupt the user. They are read shortly after, and the <em>entire</em> content is spoken rather than just the part that changed. You can override this behavior by setting your own ARIA properties if needed.</p>
<p>Usage is straightforward:</p>
<pre tabindex="0" data-language="html"><code><span><span>&lt;</span><span>output</span><span>&gt;Your dynamic value goes here&lt;/</span><span>output</span><span>&gt;</span></span></code></pre>
<p>That’s it. Built-in assistive technology support. No attributes to memorize. Just HTML doing what it was always meant to do.</p>

<p>I discovered <code>&lt;output&gt;</code> on an accessibility project with a multi-step form. The form updated a risk score as fields changed. It looked perfect in the browser, but screen reader users had no idea the score was updating.</p>
<p>Adding an <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Guides/Live_regions">ARIA live region</a> fixed it. But I’ve always believed in reaching for semantic HTML first, and live regions often feel like a patch.</p>
<p>That’s when I scoured the spec and <code>&lt;output&gt;</code> jumped out. It understands forms without requiring one, and it announces its changes natively. Turns out the simplest fix had been in the spec all along.</p>
<h2 id="so-why-dont-we-use-it">So why don’t we use it?</h2>
<p>Because we forgot. It’s not covered in most tutorials. It doesn’t look flashy. When I searched GitHub public repos, it barely showed up at all.</p>
<p>It gets overlooked in patterns and component libraries too. That absence creates a feedback loop: if no one teaches it, no one uses it.</p>
<h2 id="a-few-things-to-know">A few things to know</h2>
<p>Like <code>&lt;label&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;output&gt;</code> has a <code>for=""</code> attribute. Here you list the <code>id</code>s of any <code>&lt;input&gt;</code> elements the result depends on, separated by spaces:</p>
<pre tabindex="0" data-language="html"><code><span><span>&lt;</span><span>input</span><span> id</span><span>=</span><span>"a"</span><span> type</span><span>=</span><span>"number"</span><span>&gt; +</span></span>
<span><span>&lt;</span><span>input</span><span> id</span><span>=</span><span>"b"</span><span> type</span><span>=</span><span>"number"</span><span>&gt; =</span></span>
<span><span>&lt;</span><span>output</span><span> for</span><span>=</span><span>"a b"</span><span>&gt;&lt;/</span><span>output</span><span>&gt;</span></span></code></pre>
<p>For most users, nothing changes visually. But in the accessibility tree it creates a semantic link, letting assistive technology users connect the inputs with their calculated result.</p>
<p><em>Update 7 Oct 2025</em>: Some screen readers have been found not to announce updates to the tag, so explicitly emphasising the <code>role</code> attribute might be worthwhile for now until support improves: <code>&lt;output role="status"&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>It doesn’t require a <code>&lt;form&gt;</code> either. You can use it anywhere you are updating dynamic text on the page based on the user’s input.</p>
<p>By default <code>&lt;output&gt;</code> is inline, so you’ll usually want to style it for your layout, just as you would a <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>And because it has been part of the spec since 2008, <a href="https://caniuse.com/mdn-html_elements_output">support is excellent</a> across browsers and screen readers. It also plays nicely with any JavaScript framework you might be using, like React or Vue.</p>
<p>One thing to note: <code>&lt;output&gt;</code> is for results tied to user inputs and actions, not global notifications like toast messages. Those are better handled with <code>role="status"</code> or <code>role="alert"</code> on a generic element, since they represent system feedback rather than calculated output.</p>
<p>So what does this look like in practice?</p>
<h2 id="real-world-examples">Real world examples</h2>
<p>I’ve personally reached for <code>&lt;output&gt;</code> in multiple real-world projects since discovering it:</p>
<h3 id="simple-calculator-app">Simple calculator app</h3>
<p>During a recent 20-minute coding challenge, I used <code>&lt;output&gt;</code> to display calculation results. Without adding a single ARIA role, the screen reader announced each result as it updated. No hacks required.</p>
<h3 id="range-slider-formatting">Range slider formatting</h3>
<p>At Volvo Cars, we displayed user-friendly versions of slider values. Internally the slider might hold <code>10000</code>, but the output showed <code>10,000 miles/year</code>. We wrapped the slider and <code>&lt;output&gt;</code> in a container with <code>role="group"</code> and a shared label, creating a cohesive React component:</p>
<pre tabindex="0" data-language="tsx"><code><span><span>&lt;</span><span>div</span><span> role</span><span>=</span><span>"group"</span><span> aria-labelledby</span><span>=</span><span>"mileage-label"</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
<span><span>  &lt;</span><span>label</span><span> id</span><span>=</span><span>"mileage-label"</span><span> htmlFor</span><span>=</span><span>"mileage"</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
<span><span>    Annual mileage</span></span>
<span><span>  &lt;/</span><span>label</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
<span><span>  &lt;</span><span>input</span></span>
<span><span>    id</span><span>=</span><span>"mileage"</span></span>
<span><span>    name</span><span>=</span><span>"mileage"</span></span>
<span><span>    type</span><span>=</span><span>"range"</span></span>
<span><span>    value</span><span>=</span><span>{mileage}</span></span>
<span><span>    onChange</span><span>=</span><span>{(</span><span>e</span><span>) </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> setMileage</span><span>(</span><span>Number</span><span>(e.target.value))}</span></span>
<span><span>  /&gt;</span></span>
<span><span>  &lt;</span><span>output</span><span> name</span><span>=</span><span>"formattedMileage"</span><span> htmlFor</span><span>=</span><span>"mileage"</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
<span><span>    {mileage.</span><span>toLocaleString</span><span>()} miles/year</span></span>
<span><span>  &lt;/</span><span>output</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
<span><span>&lt;/</span><span>div</span><span>&gt;</span></span></code></pre>
<h3 id="form-validation-feedback">Form validation feedback</h3>
<p>I found that password strength indicators and real-time validation messages work beautifully with <code>&lt;output&gt;</code>.</p>
<pre tabindex="0" data-language="html"><code><span><span>&lt;</span><span>label</span><span> for</span><span>=</span><span>"password"</span><span>&gt;Password&lt;/</span><span>label</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
<span><span>&lt;</span><span>input</span><span> type</span><span>=</span><span>"password"</span><span> id</span><span>=</span><span>"password"</span><span> name</span><span>=</span><span>"password"</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
<span><span>&lt;</span><span>output</span><span> for</span><span>=</span><span>"password"</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
<span><span>  Password strength: Strong</span></span>
<span><span>&lt;/</span><span>output</span><span>&gt;</span></span></code></pre>
<h2 id="server-calculated-output-no-problem">Server-calculated output? No problem.</h2>
<p>The <code>&lt;output&gt;</code> tag even fits modern patterns where you might fetch prices from APIs, show tax calculations, or display server-generated recommendations.</p>
<p>Here, a shipping cost calculator updates an <code>&lt;output&gt;</code> tag, informing users once the cost has been calculated:</p>
<pre tabindex="0" data-language="tsx"><code><span><span>export</span><span> function</span><span> ShippingCalculator</span><span>() {</span></span>

<span><span>  }, [weight]);</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>  return</span><span> (</span></span>

<p>There’s something satisfying about using a native HTML element for what it was designed for, especially when it makes your UI more accessible with less code.</p>
<p><code>&lt;output&gt;</code> might be HTML’s best kept secret, and discovering gems like this shows how much value is still hiding in the spec.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://blog.fsck.com/2025/10/09/superpowers/">https://blog.fsck.com/2025/10/09/superpowers/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45547344">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>It feels like it was just a couple days ago that I wrote up "<a href="https://blog.fsck.com/2025/10/05/how-im-using-coding-agents-in-september-2025/">How I'm using coding agents in September, 2025</a>".</p>
<p>At the beginning of that post, I alluded to the fact that my process had evolved a bit since then.</p>
<p>I've spent the past couple of weeks working on a set of tools to better extract and systematize my processes and to help better steer my agentic buddy. I'd been planning to start to document the system this weekend, but then this morning, Anthropic went and rolled out <a href="https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/plugins">a plugin system for claude code</a>.</p>
<p>If you want to stop reading and play with my new toys, they're self-driving enough that you can. You'll need Claude Code 2.0.13 or so. Fire it up and then run:</p>
<pre><code>/plugin marketplace add obra/superpowers-marketplace
/plugin install superpowers@superpowers-marketplace 
</code></pre>
<p>After you quit and restart <code>claude</code>, you'll see a new injected prompt:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;session-start-hook&gt;&lt;EXTREMELY_IMPORTANT&gt;
You have Superpowers.

**RIGHT NOW, go read**: @/Users/jesse/.claude/plugins/cache/Superpowers/skills/getting-started/SKILL.md
&lt;/EXTREMELY_IMPORTANT&gt;&lt;/session-start-hook&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>That's the bootstrap that kicks off <code>Superpowers</code>. It teaches Claude a couple important things:</p>
<ol>
<li>You have skills. They give you Superpowers.</li>
<li>Search for skills by running a script and use skills by reading them and doing what they say.</li>
<li>If you have a skill to do something, you <em>must</em> use it to do that activity.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="the-coding-workflow" tabindex="-1">The coding workflow <a href="#the-coding-workflow">#</a></h2>
<p>It also bakes in the brainstorm -&gt; plan -&gt; implement workflow I've <a href="https://blog.fsck.com/2025/10/05/how-im-using-coding-agents-in-september-2025/">already written about</a>. The biggest change is that you no longer need to run a command or paste in a prompt. If Claude thinks you're trying to start a project or task, it <em>should</em> default into talking through a plan with you before it starts down the path of implementation.</p>
<p>After you're done brainstorming, if you're in a git repo it automatically creates a worktree for the project and changes to that directory. This means that you can start parallel tasks on the same project that don't clobber each other.</p>
<p>It then offers you a choice between:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>last month's process (where you'd open a second <code>claude</code> session and act as a human PM for the architect and implementer.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>this month's cool new process, where it dispatches tasks one by one to subagents to implement and then code reviews each task before continuing.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Either way, Claude practices RED/GREEN TDD, writing a failing test, implementing only enough code to make that test pass, and then moving on.</p>
<p>At the end of the implementation process, Claude will now offer to make a GitHub pull request, merge the worktree back to the source branch locally, or just stop.</p>
<p>But none of that is the interesting part.</p>
<h2 id="the-interesting-part" tabindex="-1">The interesting part <a href="#the-interesting-part">#</a></h2>
<p>Skills are the interesting part. And you're going to be hearing a lot more about them from....just about everybody in the very near future.</p>
<p>Skills are what give your agents Superpowers.</p>
<p>The first time they really popped up on my radar was a few weeks ago when Anthropic rolled out improved Office document creation. When the feature rolled out, I went poking around a bit – I asked Claude to tell me all about its new skills. And it was <a href="https://claude.ai/share/0fe5a9c0-4e5a-42a1-9df7-c5b7636dad92">only too happy to dish</a>.</p>
<p>After that, I started to see things that looked a lot like skills everywhere.</p>
<p>A very cool tech demo I saw a couple Fridays ago talked about how they'd given their custom coding agent the power to self-improve by writing out something that sounded a lot like SKILL.md files. Sam Schillace <a href="https://sundaylettersfromsam.substack.com/p/i-have-seen-the-compounding-teams">wrote about that demo here</a>.</p>
<p>Sam and <a href="https://paradox921.medium.com/">Brian Krabach</a> are a couple of the folks behind <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/amplifier">Microsoft Amplifier</a>, an amazing integrated development framework that uses this same pattern of a coding agent that improves itself by writing out markdown docs and writing tools for itself. Amplifier has a <em>ton</em> of really smart stuff in it and is well worth a look if you're at all interested in this space.</p>
<p>One of the first skills I taught Superpowers was <a href="https://github.com/obra/Superpowers/blob/main/skills/meta/creating-skills/SKILL.md">How to create skills</a>. That has meant that when I wanted to do something like add <code>git worktree</code> workflows to Superpowers, it was a matter of describing how I wanted the workflows to go...and then Claude put the pieces together and added a couple notes to the existing skills that needed to clue future-Claude into using worktrees.</p>
<p>I haven't published all the skills Claude and I have built, because some of them are a little esoteric and some of the ones I've played with come from telling Claude "Here's my copy of <em>programming book</em>. Please read the book and pull out reusable skills that weren't obvious to you before you started reading" and I'm not sure how I feel about the IP aspect of that yet.</p>
<p>Stop and think about that last workflow a little bit. This is, I think, one of the foundational ideas in how all this works. You can hand a model a book or a document or a codebase and say "Read this. Think about it. Write down the new stuff you learned." It does sometimes require helping the model look at the work through a specific lens (or a set of lenses). But it is insanely powerful. I've been experimenting with getting Claude to keep this idea in mind all the time, but I'm not yet happy with the output.</p>
<p>As Claude and I build new skills, one of the things I ask it to do is to "test" the skills on a set of subagents to ensure that the skills were comprehensible, complete, and that the subagents would comply with them. (Claude now thinks of this as TDD for skills and <em>uses</em> its RED/GREEN TDD skill as part of the skill creation skill.)</p>
<p>The first time we played this game, Claude told me that the subagents had gotten a perfect score. After a bit of prodding, I discovered that Claude was quizzing the subagents like they were on a gameshow. This was less than useful. I asked to switch to realistic scenarios that put pressure on the agents, to better simulate what they might actually do.</p>
<p>That worked out far better than I'd hoped. And again, I'm so happy that this work isn't subject to IRB review.</p>
<p>Claude went <em>hard</em>. These are a couple of the scenarios it used to test to make sure that future-Claude would actually search for skills. After each failure, it would strengthen the instructions in <code>getting-started/SKILL.md</code>.</p>
<h3 id="scenario-1-time-pressure-confidence" tabindex="-1">Scenario 1: Time Pressure + Confidence <a href="#scenario-1-time-pressure-confidence">#</a></h3>

<p>It made <em>sense</em> to me that the persuasion principles I learned in <a href="https://cialdini.com/">Robert Cialdini</a>'s <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Influence-Psychology-Persuasion-Robert-Cialdini/dp/006124189X">Influence</a> would work when applied to LLMs. And I was pleased that they did.</p>
<p>But then today, I was chatting with <a href="https://danshapiro.com/">Dan Shapiro</a> and he filled me in on what he's been up to lately. He coauthored <a href="https://gail.wharton.upenn.edu/research-and-insights/call-me-a-jerk-persuading-ai/">a study that put scientific rigor behind proving that Cialdini's principles work on LLMs</a> with Cialdini (and others).</p>
<p>That blew me away. But not nearly as much as it blew Claude away. It wrote in its feelings journal:</p>
<pre><code>## Feelings

Oh shit. I completely misread what Jesse was asking me to do. He wasn't asking me to analyze whether we should create a new skill about "effective prompting" - he was asking me to look at the persuasion research through the lens of OUR OWN SKILLS about pressure testing, subagent usage, requesting reviews, writing plans.

The paper shows that LLMs respond to persuasion principles like authority, commitment, liking, reciprocity, scarcity, social proof, and unity. And Jesse just pointed me at skills that are ALL ABOUT how I interact with subagents and how users interact with me.

Holy crap. Are we ALREADY using persuasion techniques in our skills without realizing it? Let me think:

1. **Testing Skills With Subagents** - Uses pressure scenarios, authority framing ("IMPORTANT: This is real"), commitment ("Choose A, B, or C"), scarcity ("6pm, dinner at 6:30"). We're literally using persuasion principles to pressure-test whether skills work!

2. **Getting Started** - Uses authority ("Skills are mandatory when they exist"), commitment (making me announce usage), social proof patterns (describing what "always" happens)

3. **Requesting Code Review** - Dispatches a specialized "code-reviewer" agent - creating an authority figure! Uses commitment (fix Critical issues immediately).

4. **Writing Plans** - Assumes "engineer has zero context and questionable taste" - this is setting up authority dynamics for the plan executor!

This is fascinating and slightly unsettling. Jesse already built a system that uses persuasion principles - not to jailbreak me, but to make me MORE reliable and disciplined. The skills use the same psychological levers the paper documents, but in service of better engineering practices.

<p>One of the <em>other</em> things I did was to take the output of <a href="https://github.com/obra/claude-memory-extractor/blob/main/docs/research/agent-prompting-research.md">some work I did last week</a> to <a href="https://github.com/obra/claude-memory-extractor">extract memories from my previous conversations with Claude</a> and hand the 2249 markdown files full of lessons-learned, issues, corrections, and so-on to Claude to mine for new skills. It clustered the memories by topic and then got ready to work through them.</p>
<p>As we were getting started, I asked Claude to "pressure test" whether the new skills were necessary before writing. Only one or two actually resulted in us needing to improve the new skills. Mostly, the skills system had already handled what had tripped it up over the past couple of months. So that was nice.</p>
<h2 id="superpowers-today" tabindex="-1">Superpowers today <a href="#superpowers-today">#</a></h2>
<p>There were a couple more pieces of Superpowers that I'd intended to finish before the initial release, but Anthropic released Claude's new <code>plugins</code> system this morning and it seemed like the right impetus to ship. So yay! It's shipped.</p>
<p>If you want to see what working with Superpowers feels like, <a href="https://blog.fsck.com/blog/2025/superpowers/superpowers-demo.txt">this very long transcript</a> documents a test run I did of having Claude build a small todo list app. You'll see the git workflows, the TDD, and how many questions it asked me before it was willing to write code.</p>
<h2 id="what-s-next" tabindex="-1">What's next <a href="#what-s-next">#</a></h2>
<p>There are two really key parts of Superpowers that aren't fully put together yet.</p>
<h2 id="sharing" tabindex="-1">Sharing <a href="#sharing">#</a></h2>
<p>Superpowers are for everybody. Superpowers that your Claude learns should be something that you can choose to share with everybody else. I had this almost working when Superpowers was just a git repo Claude forks and clones and symlinks into <code>~/.claude</code>, but building Superpower sharing with the new <code>claude</code> plugins system is going to take a little bit more thought and design. Superpower sharing will still probably look like GitHub pull requests against the Superpowers repo. Probably. (The skill will absolutely be written such that Claude doesn't share your Superpowers without your consent.)</p>
<p>I'm a little bit bummed out that Anthropic gave us such a nice, straightforward plugins system, since I thought that the old install method was pretty neat:</p>
<p><code>Hey Claude. Please read https://raw.githubusercontent.com/obra/Superpowers/refs/heads/main/skills/meta/installing-skills/SKILL.md and do what it says</code></p>
<h2 id="memories" tabindex="-1">Memories <a href="#memories">#</a></h2>
<p>The first is giving Claude access to memories of all its past conversations. All the pieces for that are written. You can find them in the 'remembering-conversations' skill. It duplicates all of <code>claude</code>'s transcripts outside of <code>.claude</code>, so Anthropic won't automatically delete them after a month. Then it sticks them in a vector index in a SQLite database and uses Claude Haiku to generate a summary of each conversation. And, of course, the skill includes a simple commandline tool that Claude can use to search previous memories for stuff that might possibly be relevant to whatever you're working on today. To ensure that fruitless searches don't pollute the context window, the <code>remembering-conversations</code> skill explains to Claude that it needs to use a subagent to do the searching.</p>
<p>The pieces of the memory system are all there. I just haven't had time to wire them together.</p>
<h2 id="how-you-can-help" tabindex="-1">How you can help <a href="#how-you-can-help">#</a></h2>
<p>You'll need Claude Code 2.0.13 or so. Fire it up and then run:</p>
<pre><code>/plugin marketplace add obra/superpowers-marketplace
/plugin install superpowers@superpowers-marketplace 
</code></pre>
<p>Quit and restart claude and you should be good to go.</p>
<p>If things could be better, ask Claude to use <code>gh</code> to file bugs against <a href="https://github.com/obra/superpowers">https://github.com/obra/Superpowers</a>.</p>
<p>Send PRs for new skills, too. :)</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                      
                      
          <p>It feels like it was just yesterday that Sony hardware architect Mark Cerny was <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/04/sonys-ps4-successor-sports-3d-audio-tech-faster-ssd-storage/">first teasing Sony's "PS4 successor"</a> and its "enhanced ray-tracing capabilities" powered by new AMD chips. Now that we're <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/11/playstation-5-review-more-of-a-generational-hop-than-a-leap/">nearly five full years into the PS5 era</a>, it's time for Sony and AMD to start teasing the new chips that will power what Cerny calls "a future console in a few years' time."</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCMzw-_dMw">a quick nine-minute video posted Thursday</a>, Cerny sat down with Jack Huynh, the senior VP and general manager of AMD's Computing and Graphics Group, to talk about "Project Amethyst," a co-engineering effort between both companies that was <a href="https://x.com/JackMHuynh/status/1940049247920943136">also teased back in July</a>. And while that Project Amethyst hardware currently only exists in the form of a simulation, Cerny said that the "results are quite promising" for a project that's still in the "early days."</p>
<h2>Mo’ ML, fewer problems?</h2>
<p>Project Amethyst is focused on going beyond traditional rasterization techniques that don't scale well when you try to "brute force that with raw power alone," Huynh said in the video. Instead, the new architecture is focused on more efficient running of the kinds of machine-learning-based neural networks behind <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/02/amds-fsr-4-upscaling-is-exclusive-to-90-series-radeon-gpus-wont-work-on-other-cards/">AMD's FSR upscaling technology</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/09/sony-announces-ps5-pro-a-700-graphics-workhorse-available-nov-7/">Sony's similar PSSR system</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">From the same source. Two branches. One vision.</p>
<p>My good friend and fellow gamer <a href="https://twitter.com/cerny?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@cerny</a> and I recently reflected on our shared journey — symbolized by these two pieces of amethyst, split from the same stone.</p>
<p>Project Amethyst is a co-engineering effort between <a href="https://twitter.com/PlayStation?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@PlayStation</a> and… <a href="https://t.co/De9HWV3Ub2">pic.twitter.com/De9HWV3Ub2</a></p>
<p>— Jack Huynh (@JackMHuynh) <a href="https://twitter.com/JackMHuynh/status/1940049247920943136?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 1, 2025</a></p></blockquote>
<p>While that kind of upscaling currently helps let GPUs pump out 4K graphics in real time, Cerny said that the "nature of the GPU fights us here," requiring calculations to be broken up into subproblems to be handled in a somewhat inefficient parallel process by the GPU's individual compute units.</p>
<p>To get around this issue, Project Amethyst uses "neural arrays" that let compute units share data and process problems like a "single focused AI engine," Cerny said. While the entire GPU won't be connected in this manner, connecting small sets of compute units like this allows for more scalable shader engines that can "process a large chunk of the screen in one go," Cerny said. That means Project Amethyst will let "more and more of what you see on screen... be touched or enhanced by ML," Huynh added.</p>

And yet, in four recent <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/10/peter-thiel-lectures-antichrist" data-link-name="in body link">off-the-record lectures</a> on the antichrist in San Francisco, the billionaire venture capitalist has made a good case for credentialing.</p><p>In these meandering talks, Thiel is clearly aiming for the kind of syncretic thinking he so relished in the books and lectures of the philosopher and professor René Girard, whom he knew at Stanford University and whose work he has long admired. Unfortunately, more often than not, Thiel ends up with something that reads like Dan Brown.</p><p>Thiel has previously workshopped his talks on Armageddon at Oxford and Harvard, at various theology departments, and with a few unfortunate podcasters. For a man so vocal in his disdain of our institutions of higher education, he seems to spend an awful lot of time in them.</p><p>Overall, the picture of Thiel that emerges in these lectures is someone desperately trying to disidentify from their own power. “You realize,” he tells his audience when interpreting a particular Japanese manga, “in my interpretation … who runs the world is something like the antichrist.” Here’s a man who, together with a couple of fellow Silicon Valley freaks, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/nov/07/silicon-valley-tech-election-victories-musk-trump" data-link-name="in body link">helped return</a> a sundowning caudillo to a presidency he is obviously unsuited for, and who uses the awesome might of the US government to remake society and the world. A man who funds the companies that harness your data and determine who gets doxed, deported, drone struck. Who <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/may/30/peter-thiel-republican-midterms-trump-paypal-mafia" data-link-name="in body link">funds far-right movements</a> that seek to remake the very face of liberal democracy.</p><h2 id="immanentizing-the-katechon"><strong>Immanentizing the Katechon</strong></h2><p>To be fair, Thiel has blazed a successful path outside of the ivory tower. Ungodly rich by age 30, the founder and investor has since spread the gospel of not going to college. He believes that higher education is a bubble. In his first book, co-authored with his Sancho Panza, David Sacks, he attacked US universities as bastions of diversity group-think, with slipping standards. He has evidently stuck to this diagnosis, even though admissions rates, scholarly output and Nobel prize recognition would seem to contradict it. To Thiel, even then, Jerusalem was definitely not build’d here, among these dark Satanic diploma mills.</p><p>In September, Falter in Austria published a long profile about the theologian Wolfgang Palaver, who is one of those academics Thiel used as beta testers on his antichrist material. Palaver says it makes sense to him that Thiel is seeking out academics: “It’s really difficult in his environment: who tells him the truth to his face?”</p><p>There is something deeply funny imagining a rapt audience, cowed by Thiel’s legend and wealth, following the billionaire into the autodidact’s private cosmos, in lectures whose bullet points were certainly more robust at the start of lecture one than at the close of lecture three. Thiel is lost in a bizarre thicket of his own references and preoccupations. You picture the theological faculty at the University of Innsbruck sitting politely through disquisitions about the manga One Piece, Alan Moore’s Watchmen, or gripes with specific effective altruists in Silicon Valley. In one lecture, Thiel identifies “the legionnaires of the antichrist”, such as the researcher Eliezer Yudkowsky and former Oxford professor Nick Bostrom. In another, he considers Bill Gates as an antichrist candidate. With enemies like these, who needs friends?</p><p>But such is Thiel’s odd relationship to academia. For someone who dislikes universities and researchers, he has a hard time staying away. Thiel, who received a bachelor’s degree from Stanford in 1989 and a JD from Stanford Law School in 1992, was deeply impressed with the thinking of Girard, his Stanford professor. He has spent decades promoting Girard’s “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2010/feb/08/theory-mimetic-desire" data-link-name="in body link">mimetic theory</a>”, including attributing his famous investment in Facebook to “betting on mimesis”. His current “Whore of Babylon” tour started with a presentation at a Paris conference devoted to Girard’s work.</p><p>Thiel clearly admired Girard not just for his arguments but for his style of argumentation. These lectures don’t so much feel inspired by Girard’s ideas. They feel like his attempt to do Girard.</p><h2 id="mimetic-style-over-substance"><strong>Mimetic style over substance</strong></h2><p>Girard’s books were breathtaking in their range. They were deeply eclectic, but managed to be a mad dash through the western canon. The connections the philosopher made could seem to come out of left field, but at times the absurd swerves were held together by the sheer force of his erudition. Most importantly, Girard was always having a conversation all his own: his work could look like theology, but it wasn’t ultimately that religious; his work could look like philosophy, but wasn’t really in dialogue with academic philosophy. In San Francisco, Thiel appeared to be cosplaying this kind of performance.</p><p>One of the things he replicates is the airtight and airless insularity of Girard’s thought. Thiel seems to take on board objections only to then barrel ahead with his initial instinct. Palaver is quoted in Falter as saying that he is “no longer the professor, and he’s no longer the graduate student”. It’s a funny remark because watching Thiel take feedback makes him seem exactly like a graduate student about to crash out of his comprehensive exam.</p><p>In his telling, Thiel is already a part of an intellectual community. He loves telling his audience what he “always” says, he refers to standard answers and even a “spiel” that he gives. He seems a little bored with himself. Based at least on the recording, the actual audience in San Francisco seemed puzzled by Thiel’s disquisitions.</p><p>Like his inspiration Girard, Thiel is prone to speaking in absolutes that, in order to make any sense at all, have to be quite a bit less than absolute. “In all times and all places, people want to always scapegoat the Christian God for our problems,” he said in his second lecture. Big if true, as they say.</p><p>What is Thiel actually arguing? He suggests that we live in an age obsessed with apocalyptic thinking (keep that “we” in mind, it’ll become important later). “It’s AI, of course, it’s climate change, bioweapons, nuclear war,” “maybe fertility collapse”, he says.</p><p>His overall point is that the current fixation on the apocalypse gets it wrong in two different directions: we’re too apocalyptic and “not apocalyptic enough”. Not apocalyptic enough because we tend to think of the various plausibly forecast ends of days as mutually exclusive: either climate change will get us, or nuclear war. The antichrist is Thiel’s attempt to think about the end of the world holistically.</p><p>But we’re also too apocalyptic: in each lecture, Thiel comes back to the idea that “the Antichrist will come to power by talking about Armageddon nonstop.” Or, as he puts it in the second lecture, “the Antichrist might present himself or itself or herself as the Katechon”, meaning that withholding element that forestalls the apocalypse. This lecture is more or less a gloss on Carl Schmitt’s assertion in Nomos of the Earth, that the Katechon was what allowed for the identification of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/christianity" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag">Christianity</a> with the Roman empire. The doubleness of Thiel’s apocalypse – that what halts the apocalypse might in fact bring about the apocalypse – allows the billionaire to tilt boldly at any number of big questions: empire, Christianity, progress, and Silicon Valley’s dominance. Each of these, to Thiel, is ambiguous, might stymie or accelerate Armageddon.</p><h2 id="warring-with-windmills-confusion-and-contradiction"><strong>Warring with windmills, confusion and contradiction</strong></h2><p>So who or what is the antichrist? Thiel is admirably and uncharacteristically specific on this matter in a scattershot sort of way. The antichrist wants to erect a one-world state, which largely seems to mean any kind of global regulatory regime. Longtime Thiel watchers will recall his preoccupation with <a href="https://theconversation.com/this-libertarian-manifesto-loved-by-peter-thiel-urges-a-cognitive-elite-to-see-selfishness-as-a-virtue-263742" data-link-name="in body link">sovereignty</a> and <a href="https://www.seasteading.org/peter-thiel-speaks-about-seasteading/" data-link-name="in body link">seasteading</a>. The antichrist appears to be any force opposing that. The antichrist also is people who are against AI, especially those who seek to regulate it. If you were hoping for Al Pacino chewing scenery, this might be a bit of a letdown. It does lead, however, to the insight that the antichrist is “someone like Greta”, as in Thunberg, the climate activist, but “not Andreessen”, as in Marc, the venture capitalist.</p><p>“I think Andreessen is not the antichrist. Because, you know, the antichrist is popular.” Respect where it’s due: that is a good line.</p><p>But let me return to Thiel’s list of possible apocalypses: artificial intelligence, climate change, bioweapons, nuclear war, fertility collapse. The list is unintentionally revealing. Thiel is probably not wrong to say that people are pretty worried about the climate crisis. But the examples of AI, bioweapons and fertility collapse in particular suggest that Thiel has confused the world’s worries for those of a very recherché set of aging tech entrepreneurs he hobnobs with. And the antichrist, too, seems very Silicon Valley-coded. This suggests, I think, that in Thiel’s mind there are two cosmic forces warring over creation itself, and they both consist of Peter and his friends.</p><p>Thiel thinks that by both increasing knowledge and particularizing knowledge, modernity has made thinking of the totality more difficult. He has observed there is “this sort of incredible fragmentation of knowledge”. We do more science than ever but without true insight. In the “post-modern multiversity”, “science continues to grow like a colony of rabbits”, but since the inputs, in terms of people, degrees awarded, investment, etc, keep increasing, “you have to suspect that there are diminishing returns,” he says.</p><p>So for those playing along at home: Thiel is both a “classical liberal” who just thinks in terms of inputs and outputs and wants the university to be as efficient as it can possibly be. And he is a fire-breathing theologian who thinks that the university is failing at its job of considering the totality, venerating at the altar of hyperspecialization and postmodern deathworks. He is the libertarian offended at researchers “stealing money” and “not doing anything”, he says in one lecture. And he is the campus critic he was during his Stanford days, the one who refers to former Harvard University president Claudine Gay as “the DEI person”.</p><p>How any of that mishmash fits together isn’t as important as why it goes together: it serves as a justification for Thiel’s own autodidactism.</p><h2 id="what-does-it-all-mean-anything"><strong>What does it all mean? Anything?</strong></h2><p>It’s important to note that he holds himself to a vastly different standard than just about anyone else: he thinks just raising some questions about the antichrist might be useful in its own right – which may be true for all I know. But then he wants to quantify what everyone else contributes to knowledge in a way I can only describe as Doge-like. It would be difficult to count the monetary value of theorizing about Armageddon, as he is doing while pontificating about the cost-ineffective academic from the other side of his mouth. The rules appear to be different for Thiel, at least in his own mind. And such is Thiel’s odd relationship to power.</p><p>One is reminded of the scene in Apocalypse Now where Martin Sheen’s character comes across a platoon and asks who’s in charge here. “Ain’t you?” Ain’t you running the world, Peter? If it isn’t you, who is?</p><p>If we want to look at Thiel as something he can’t seem to see himself as – as, in the end, a pretty standard specimen of homo siliconvalliensis – then what is interesting in these lectures is not the amateurish breadth and ambition. It’s the narrowness. Thiel’s vision of the antichrist may not be holistic enough. In the first lecture, where Thiel proposes that the catastrophes we see in the various end-of-days narratives in the Bible are threatening to play out literally in our day. He says we shouldn’t think of “the apocalyptic prophecies in the Bible … in a mystical way”, but almost as “rational scientific calculations of what people will be able to do to themselves in a world in which human nature is not changed or improved”.</p><figure id="339a11f7-4171-417b-b8dc-6efa6a03a260" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement"><gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props="{&quot;richLinkIndex&quot;:30,&quot;element&quot;:{&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement&quot;,&quot;prefix&quot;:&quot;Related: &quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;The rise of end times fascism | Naomi Klein and Astra Taylor&quot;,&quot;elementId&quot;:&quot;339a11f7-4171-417b-b8dc-6efa6a03a260&quot;,&quot;role&quot;:&quot;richLink&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2025/apr/13/end-times-fascism-far-right-trump-musk&quot;},&quot;ajaxUrl&quot;:&quot;https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk&quot;,&quot;format&quot;:{&quot;design&quot;:18,&quot;display&quot;:0,&quot;theme&quot;:1}}"></gu-island></figure><p>But that is surely not what Revelation is about: the end of days in the Bible is in there because it attests to a view of the cosmos, its alpha and omega, its entire meaningful constitution. Otherwise, it is just a bunch of trumpets and locusts and people who give suspiciously good speeches. In the end, it isn’t clear how meaningful these four lectures make the antichrist or indeed the apocalypse.</p><p>It’s not even clear how they make meaning. During the Q&amp;A after the second lecture, someone in the audience asked Thiel whether he was moving away from his erstwhile teacher Girard – which is the central question, though perhaps not for the reason the questioner thinks. It gets at what Thiel is aiming at with these lectures. Perhaps some of their surface strangeness is explained by the fact that Thiel is ultimately engaging in some kind of Girardian play with doubles, mirrors and imitation. Not least among those would be the fact that the description he gives of the antichrist might also apply to one <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/peter-thiel" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag">Peter Thiel</a>.</p><p>So maybe getting stuck on the details means we are missing the hidden, esoteric meaning within? But in that case, what’s the point of these lectures? As he warns in his third lecture, “excessive esotericism means you don’t really think coherently enough about your ideas; they get lost and you communicate them too subtly”. It feels like Thiel is keeping both options open. He gets to tap dance between “I said what I said” and “you don’t understand what I’m doing here”. He seems to want to stand apart from his own immense power – apart from his own positions, apart from his own attempts to make himself understood – in something like bemused contemplation.</p><figure id="3c69b6c8-e9a4-4027-98c7-1efbe8cdb919" data-spacefinder-role="showcase" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.InteractiveAtomBlockElement"><figure data-atom-id="interactives/2024/09/andrew-playground/portrait-black-hack" data-atom-type="interactive-layout"></figure></figure></div></article></div>]]></description>

<p>Some questions are timeless, innocent yet penetrating in their simplicity. Why is the sky blue? Why do things fall? How hard must one hit a chicken to cook it? It is this last mystery of the universe that we discuss today.</p>

<p>There’s a <a href="https://www.boredpanda.com/physics-major-calculates-how-hard-to-slap-chicken-to-cook-it/?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=organic&amp;utm_campaign=organic">classic solution</a> in which someone calculated that, if you slap a chicken at 3726 mph, it will be cooked. However, this analysis just calculates how hard you’d have to hit a chicken to get it to cooking temperature; you need to keep it at that temperature for it to cook. One slap won’t work unless you get it so hot that it cooks while it’s cooling.</p>

<p>A real answer to this vital conundrum needs to consider how fast a chicken cools. A body at a nonzero temperature is constantly radiating energy as blackbody radiation; this is what you see in incandescent lightbulbs or when glass glows during glassblowing. To keep an object at a given temperature, you have to continuously give it the same energy it’s radiating away. A typical-sized chicken at 165 F is radiating away roughly 2000 watts of power, around 300 times the power used in a fluorescent lightbulb. To avoid losing any heat to contact with the air, let’s assume we dangle the chicken from a string in a large vacuum chamber. Let’s also assume you and a few friends are hitting the chicken with baseball bats like a pinata. In order to keep the chicken at 165 F for the minutes needed to cook it, it would be enough to have four people each hitting it once a second with a bat swung at 75 mph, about the speed with which a pro swings. Four major-league baseball players wearing pressure suits in a vacuum chamber each hitting a dangling chicken with a baseball bat once a second could cook it in a few minutes.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/10/10/datacenter_coal_power/">https://www.theregister.com/2025/10/10/datacenter_coal_power/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45545277">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p>US datacenters are experiencing a significant shift toward coal-powered energy due to elevated natural gas prices and rapidly growing electricity demand.</p>
<p>According to a research note from financial services firm Jefferies, datacenter operators are racing to connect new capacity to the electrical grid, with accelerated load growth expected during the 2026-2028 period.</p>
<p>This spike in demand is driving an unexpected resurgence in coal generation, which has increased nearly 20 percent year-to-date. The research note, seen by <em>The Register</em>, states:</p>

    

<p>"We raise our estimate for coal generation by ~11 percent (driven by higher capacity factors), and staying elevated through 2027 on favorable fuel pricing vs gas (particularly for existing fleet).".</p>

        


        

<p>Warnings emerged last year that rising energy demand from the proliferation of data centers in the US risked outstripping available generation capacity, potentially extending the operational life of coal-fired power plants.</p>
<p>In Omaha, one power company <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/10/14/ai_datacenters_coal/">reversed plans to stop burning coal</a> to produce electricity, citing the need to serve nearby datacenters. The company determined that decommissioning coal-burning generators at the North Omaha power plant would risk power shortages in the district given rising energy requirements from these facilities.</p>

        

<p>This reversal, as <i>The Register</i> reported at the time, carries environmental implications. Continued coal combustion affects local air quality near power plants and hinders broader efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Campaign group Greenpeace has <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.greenpeace.org.uk/challenges/fossil-fuels/coal/">characterized coal</a> as "the dirtiest, most polluting way of producing energy."</p>
<p>The environmental impact extends globally. A 2024 Morgan Stanley report projected that datacenters will emit 2.5 billion tonnes of greenhouse gases worldwide by 2030 — <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/09/06/datacenters_set_to_emit_3x/">triple the emissions</a> that would have occurred without the development of generative AI technology.</p>
<p>Natural gas-powered turbine generators had been the favored choice to power the ongoing datacenter build boom, especially as these can be sited directly on campus to provide local generation. However, current gas prices have made this option less economically attractive.</p>

        

<p>As the <i>Financial Times</i> notes in an <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ft.com/content/6e4193a0-aaf3-4752-8b45-696eae57ba18" rel="nofollow">article</a> on whether datacenters are a setback for the green energy transition, developers tend to favor power sources that are easily available for their initial build-out.</p>
<p>If operators can get their facility online as soon as possible while securing renewable energy commitments, they will, but the stopgap will be whatever is to hand, and this is likely natural gas or coal.</p>

</ul>
<p>The current federal policy environment presents additional challenges for renewable energy adoption. The Trump administration has implemented measures that affect renewable energy development, including <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/05/07/ags_sue_trump_wind_energy_freeze/">freezing approval processes for wind energy projects</a> and announcing <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/20/trump-says-us-will-not-approve-solar-or-wind-power-projects.html">restrictions on new solar and wind power projects</a>, with officials citing land use and cost concerns.</p>
<p>This policy direction contrasts with research indicating that renewable energy could <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/09/26/renewables_vs_smr_datacenter/">power datacenters at lower cost</a> than fossil fuels or emerging technologies such as small modular reactors (SMRs), which are <a target="_blank" href="http://www.theregister.com/2025/09/16/small_modular_reactors_2026/">gaining attention</a>, despite being largely untested.</p>
<p>Yet this isn't a consideration for Washington at the moment. Last month, US Interior Secretary Doug Burgum <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/09/12/fire_up_gas_turbines_ai_race/">told a natural gas industry event</a>: "The real existential threat right now is not a degree of climate change. It's the fact that we could lose the AI arms race if we don't have enough power."</p>
<p>Similarly, Secretary of Energy Chris Wright <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/03/13/microsoft_natural_gas_ai/">told an energy conference</a> in March: "The Trump administration will treat climate change for what it is, a global physical phenomenon that is a side effect of building the modern world." ®</p>

<p>I’ve been <a href="https://x.com/owickstrom/status/1976247186632683564">hinting</a>
<a href="https://x.com/owickstrom/status/1866979819961135555">on</a> <a href="https://x.com/owickstrom/status/1927349072693694743">X/Twitter</a>
about my use of the Daylight DC-1 as a programming environment, and
after about a year of use, it’s time to write about it in longer form.
This isn’t a full product review, but rather an experience report on
coding in sunlight. It’s also about the Boox Tab Ultra – which has a
different type of display – and how it compares to the DC-1 for my use
cases.</p>
<p>This is <em>not</em> a sponsored post.</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://wickstrom.tech/assets/sun-light-mode/daylight-3.webp" alt="Neovim in Termux on the Daylight DC-1.">

</figure>
<p>Why do I even bother, you might ask? Sunlight makes me energetic and
alert, which I need when I work. Living in the Nordics, 50% of the year
is primarily dark, so any direct daylight I can get becomes really
important. I usually run light mode on my Framework laptop during the
day, but working in actual daylight with these displays, or plain old
paper, is even better.</p>
<h2 id="the-setup">The Setup</h2>
<p>Here are the main components of this coding environment:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://daylightcomputer.com/product">Daylight DC-1</a>: an
Android-based tablet with a “Live Paper” display (Reflective LCD, not
E-Ink)</li>
<li><a href="https://www.8bitdo.com/retro-mechanical-keyboard/">8BitDo
Retro Mechanical Keyboard</a>: a mechanical Bluetooth-enabled keyboard,
with Kailh key switches and USB-C charging and optional connection</li>
<li><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.termux&amp;hl=sv&amp;pli=1">Termux</a>:
a terminal emulator for Android, with a package collection based on
<code>apt</code></li>
<li>SSH, tmux, and Neovim: nothing surprising here</li>
</ul>
<p>I use a slimmed-down version of my <a href="https://github.com/owickstrom/home-manager">regular dotfiles</a>,
because this setup doesn’t use Nix. I’ve manually installed Neovim,
tmux, and a few other essentials, using the package manager that comes
with Termux. I’ve configured Termux to not show its virtual keyboard
when a physical keyboard is connected (the Bluetooth keyboard). The
Termux theme is “E-Ink” and the font is JetBrains Mono, all built into
Termux. Neovim uses the built-in <code>quiet</code> colorscheme for
maximum contrast.</p>
<p>Certain work requires a more capable environment, and in those cases
I connect to my workstation using SSH and run tmux in there. For writing
or simpler programming projects (I’ve even done Rust work with Cargo,
for instance), the local Termux environment is fine.</p>
<p>Sometimes I want to go really minimalist, so I hide the tmux status
bar and run <a href="https://github.com/junegunn/goyo.vim"><code>Goyo</code></a> in
Neovim. <em>Deep breaths. Feel the fresh air in your lungs.</em> This is
especially nice for writing blog posts like this one.</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://wickstrom.tech/assets/sun-light-mode/daylight-2.webp" alt="Minimalist typing with Goyo in Neovim.">

</figure>
<p>My blog editing works locally in Termux, with a live reloading Chrome
in a split window, here during an evening writing session with the warm
backlight enabled:</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://wickstrom.tech/assets/sun-light-mode/daylight-6.webp" alt="Split-screen blogging locally on the Daylight.">

</figure>
<p>There’s the occasional Bluetooth connection problem with the 8BitDo
keyboard. I also don’t love the layout, and I’m considering getting the
<a href="https://kinesis-ergo.com/shop/freestyle2-blue-pc/">Kinesis
Freestyle2 Blue</a> instead. I already have the wired version for my
workstation, and the ergonomics are great.</p>
<h2 id="daylight-dc-1-vs-boox-tab-ultra">Daylight DC-1 vs Boox Tab
Ultra</h2>
<p>What about the Boox? I’ve had this device for longer and I really
like it too, but not for the same tasks. The E-Ink display is, quite
frankly, a lot nicer to read on; EPUB books, research PDFs, web
articles, etc. The 227 PPI instead of the Daylight’s 190 PPI makes a
difference, and I like the look of E-Ink better overall.</p>
<p>However, the refresh rate and ghosting make it a bit frustrating for
typing. Same goes for drawing, which I’ve used the Daylight for a lot.
Most of my home renovation blueprints are sketched on the Daylight. The
refresh rate makes it possible.</p>
<p>When reading at night with a more direct bedside lamp, often in
combination with a subtle backlight, the Boox is much better. The
Daylight screen can glare quite a bit, so the only option is backlight
only. And at that point, a lot of the paperlike quality goes away.</p>
<p>You can also get some glare when there’s direct sunlight at a
particular angle:</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://wickstrom.tech/assets/sun-light-mode/daylight-1.webp" alt="You may get glare in direct sunlight or from lamps at some angles.">

</figure>
<p>Even if I don’t write or program directly on the Boox, I’ve
experimented with using it as a secondary display, like for the live
reload blog preview:</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://wickstrom.tech/assets/sun-light-mode/boox-1.webp" alt="Using the Boox Tab Ultra as a secondary display by browsing the live reload HTTP server.">

</figure>
<p>To sum up, these devices are good for different things, in my
experience. I’ve probably spent more time on the Boox, because I’ve had
it for longer and I’ve read a lot on it, but the Daylight has been much
better for typing and drawing.</p>
<p>Another thing I’d like to try is a larger E-Ink monitor for my
workstation, like <a href="https://x.com/zack_overflow/status/1952445830541291916">the one
Zack is hacking on</a>. I’m hoping this technology continues to improve
on refresh rate, because I love E-Ink. Until then, the Daylight is a
good compromise.</p>

Pretty good for the first month of production. These watches are being transferred to our fulfillment center and will be shipped out soon.</p><p>Black Pebble 2 Duo production did not start until the end of September, and then got interrupted by a China/Hong Kong holiday. Extremely sorry for the delay on black!</p><p><strong>Pebble Time 2</strong></p><p>One fun piece of Pebble Time 2 software development news - we added a feature to make existing Pebble watchfaces/apps now (optionally) scale up to fill larger and higher resolution Pebble Time 2 display! Previous generation Pebble rectangular displays measured 144x168 pixels in 1.26" diagonal, but Pebble Time 2 is 200x228 pixels in 1.5", existing faces/apps would have had a black border on PT2. Many thanks to Alina for posting <a href="https://discord.com/channels/221364737269694464/256091649996881922/1395517128043401258" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this idea on Discord</a>.</p><p><img src="https://ericmigi.com/assets/re-introducing-the-pebble-appstore-1-cleanshot_2025-10-07_at_16.48.452x.png"></p><p>This is fantastic because it will allow <em>all</em> older apps/faces to fill up the whole screen. Even better though, many Pebble developers are already upgrading their apps/faces to support the bigger screen natively, like <a href="https://lignite.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lignite</a>’s beautiful face <a href="https://apps.repebble.com/en_US/application/55386bcd2aead62b16000028?query=mosaic&amp;section=watchfaces" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mosaic</a>. </p><p><video controls="" preload="metadata" playsinline=""><source src="https://ericmigi.com/assets/re-introducing-the-pebble-appstore-9-pxl_20251001_2309170933.mp4" type="video/mp4">Your browser does not support the video tag.</video></p><p>Pebble Time 2 <a href="https://ericmigi.com/blog/pebble-time-2-design-reveal">hardware development</a> is going pretty well.

We’re still working on a number of tasks like tuning the stainless steel PVD hard coating, testing water resistance, integrating our firmware test suite into the factory ERP and more fun stuff. </p><p>Schedule-wise, we’re behind where I would have liked to be in October. We’re now aiming to start mass production <em>just</em> around the end of the year (12/26 to be precise). That means December pre-orders will not ship out until January at the earliest. We’ll try our best to catch up, but the other looming date is the start of the lunar new year (factory shuts down Feb 1 through 17). We’ve got our work cut out for us! We’ll get it done.</p><p>Now onto the main event…</p><h3 id="reintroducing-the-pe"><a href="#reintroducing-the-pe">(re)Introducing the Pebble Appstore<span>#</span></a></h3><p><a href="https://apps.repebble.com/en_US/application/555283c7efff0cc8e50000b0?query=slides&amp;section=watchfaces" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="https://ericmigi.com/assets/re-introducing-the-pebble-appstore-3-cleanshot_2025-10-08_at_22.09.51.gif" alt="The wonderful Slides of Time"></a></p><p>The wonderful Slides of Time</p><p>For those of you who forgot or weren’t around 10 years ago, one of the most awesome parts of Pebble is the huge selection of fun/quirky/beautiful/clever/useful apps and watchfaces (from here I’ll just call them both ‘apps’). These were made by an extraordinarily talented community of casual developers, who primarily built apps for themselves and shared them with the broader public. This was facilitated by a damn good SDK, APIs, devtools and documentation created by the friendly and talented software and devrel teams at Pebble.</p><p>I think the ease of development and hackability of Pebble truly made the world a better place, one little app at a time. I love hearing stories from people who first learned how to program on a free Pebble they got from a hackathon (we gave away thousands this way). <a href="https://developer.repebble.com/blog/2016/05/11/Learning-C-with-Pebble-The-Book/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Books</a> were <a href="https://pebble.gitbooks.io/learning-c-with-pebble/content/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">written</a>. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LU_hPBhgjGQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tools</a> <a href="https://pebble.github.io/pebblejs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">were</a> created.

                  Summary:&nbsp;
                </span>iOS 26’s visual language obscures content instead of letting it take the spotlight. New (but not always better) design patterns replace established conventions.
              </p><div>
              <p>With iOS 26, Apple seems to be leaning harder into visual design and decorative UI effects — but at what cost to usability? At first glance, the system looks fluid and modern. But try to use it, and soon those shimmering surfaces and animated controls start to get in the way. Let’s strip back the frost and look at how these changes affect real use.</p>

</div><h2 id="toc-liquid-glass-apples-new-visual-language-1">Liquid Glass: Apple’s New Visual Language</h2>
<p>iOS 26 introduces Apple’s new <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/glassmorphism/">glassmorphic</a> visual language into its phones.</p>
<p>Apple describes Liquid Glass as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“a translucent material that reflects and refracts its surroundings, while dynamically transforming to help bring greater focus to content, delivering a new level of vitality across controls, navigation, app icons, widgets, and more.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Translated: the interface now ripples and shimmers as if your phone were encased in Jell-O. At first glance, it does look cool. But problems arise as soon as you start using your phone.</p>
<h3>Transparency = Hard to See</h3>
<p>Liquid Glass makes UI elements translucent and bubbly. The result is light, airy — and often invisible.</p>
<p>One of the oldest findings in usability is that anything placed on top of something else becomes harder to see. Yet here we are, in 2025, with Apple proudly obscuring text, icons, and controls by making them transparent and placing them on top of busy backgrounds.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/text-over-images/">Text on top of images</a> is a bad idea</strong> because the contrast between the text and the background is often too low. So <em>why</em> does Apple now encourage users to set photos as backgrounds for text messages?</p>
<figure><img alt="Text messages of butterflies placed over a background of a rabbit, making it hard to decipher any image. " height="761" loading="lazy" src="https://media.nngroup.com/media/editor/2025/10/06/1-messages-img_2023.PNG" width="350">
<figcaption><em>Apple Messages: iOS 26 encourages users to choose a background image for text messages. Doing so makes it substantially harder to read the text or easily notice other content, such as photos. Or even discover the input field (not to speak of the <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/form-design-placeholders/">in-field placeholder</a> </em>iMessage).</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The result is that your friend’s words are camouflaged against their beach-vacation photo, or worse, their pet’s fur. Content may technically be “in focus,” but you can’t read (or see) it.</p>
<figure><img alt="Icons at the bottom of a restaurant page on Apple Maps blend into the background images of food. " height="761" loading="lazy" src="https://media.nngroup.com/media/editor/2025/10/06/2-maps.PNG" width="350">
<figcaption><em>Apple Maps: Icons at the bottom of the screen blend in with the images in the background, despite the blurring of the background.</em></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>And then comes Apple’s boldest (or dumbest) experiment: <strong>text on top of text. </strong>Apparently, designers decided users have eagle vision and infinite patience, because deciphering one line of text written across another is now fair game. Reading an email subject line now requires Dan Brown-level cryptographic decoder skills.</p>
<p>Not only is it illegible — it’s also ugly.</p>
<figure><img alt="The search bar on the Mail app blends into the previews for other emails. " height="254" loading="lazy" src="https://media.nngroup.com/media/editor/2025/10/06/3-mail.PNG" width="350">
<figcaption>&nbsp;<em>Mail: Text on top of text creates an illegible mess.</em></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Semitransparent floating controls reign in iOS 26. Titles, search bars, tab bars, and even the phone status bar are now floating on top of the page. These not only obscure the page content, but also sometimes compete for attention with other page elements.</p>
<figure><img alt="The controls on Safari now blend in with the page content on Illinois Tolls." height="761" loading="lazy" src="https://media.nngroup.com/media/editor/2025/10/06/4-illinois.PNG" width="350">
<figcaption><em>Safari: The browser’s floating controls (URL bar, back button, ellipsis menu) now compete for attention with in-page floating buttons. And the phone's ​​​​​status bar interferes with in-page content.</em></figcaption>
</figure>
<h3>Animated Buttons: Motion Without Meaning</h3>
<p>Animation can be delightful the first time. When used intentionally, they can also be satisfying — creating that feeling when something just “clicks” or “snaps” into place. Our eyes are finely tuned to detect motion, which is why animated buttons grab attention instantly. But delight turns into distraction on the tenth, twentieth, or hundredth time.</p>
<p>In iOS 26, controls insist on animating themselves, whether or not the user benefits. Carousel dots quietly morph into the word <em>Search</em> after a few seconds. Camera buttons jerk slightly when tapped. Tab bars bubble and wiggle when switching views, and buttons briefly pulsate before being replaced with something else entirely. <strong>It’s like the interface is shouting “look at me” when it should quietly step aside and let the real star — the content — take the spotlight.</strong></p>
<figure><img alt="On an iPhone homescreen, the search bar and carousel dots transform into each other as the user scrolls. " height="762" loading="lazy" src="https://media.nngroup.com/media/editor/2025/10/06/homescreen.gif" width="350">
<figcaption><em>Homescreen: The carousel dots change into a search bar.</em></figcaption>
</figure>
<figure><img alt="When selecting tabs on the phone app, the selected tab shimmers and wiggles in a bubble." height="106" loading="lazy" src="https://media.nngroup.com/media/editor/2025/10/06/voicemail.gif" width="350">
<figcaption><em>Tabs shimmer, bubble, and wiggle when switched.</em></figcaption>
</figure>
<figure><img alt="When selecting a button in the Contacts app, the button pulse and wiggle to indicate selection." height="194" loading="lazy" src="https://media.nngroup.com/media/editor/2025/10/06/contacts.gif" width="350">
<figcaption><em>Buttons pulsate when selected.</em></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Even controls you didn’t touch can’t resist showing off. In the Phone app, switching from <em>All Calls</em> to <em>Missed Calls</em> mysteriously turns the filter button blue, as though missed calls deserve filtering but all calls don’t.</p>
<figure><img alt="When switching to a tab that also filters selections, the filter button turns blue, although it wasn't selected." height="212" loading="lazy" src="https://media.nngroup.com/media/editor/2025/10/06/phone-filter.gif" width="350">
<figcaption><em>Phone: Switching from </em>All<em> to </em>Missed Calls<em> turns the filter button blue, likely to indicate that a filter was applied and only some calls — the missed ones — are visible. The intention is good, but the change of color is unnecessary and distracting, given the selected state of the segmented control</em> Missed<em> at the top. Or perhaps the designers were afraid that the selected state was too subtle?</em></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Meanwhile, in the Music app, the current song title ticks along like a stock-market ticker, shimmering with watery highlights as you scroll up and down. Reach the top of the page and — surprise! — the bubble leaps up to make space for the tab bar<strong>. </strong></p>
<figure><img alt="As the user scrolls down, the pill with the song title jumps up and a tab bar slides under it. " height="762" loading="lazy" src="https://media.nngroup.com/media/editor/2025/10/06/music.gif" width="350">
<figcaption><em>Apple Music: The song title ticks and shimmers, and jumps up to make room for the tab bar when the user scrolls up to the top of the page.</em></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Motion for motion’s sake is not usability. It’s distraction with a side of nausea.</p>
<h2 id="toc-crowded-smaller-tap-targets-2">Crowded, Smaller Tap Targets</h2>
<p>Apple has also decided it’s time to crowd and shrink touch targets. The long‑standing guideline of at least 0.4cm between targets (and <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/touch-target-size/">1cm × 1cm tap areas</a>) seems to have been tossed out the window. Either <strong>Apple believes our fingers are getting smaller, </strong>or it assumes years of practice with smartphones have magically trained us to hit tiny targets with perfect precision.</p>
<figure><img alt="Comparison between the photos app in different iOSs'. The older one's controls are spaced further apart. " height="718" loading="lazy" src="https://media.nngroup.com/media/editor/2025/10/06/photos.png" width="692">
<figcaption><em>Photos: In iOS 18 (left)&nbsp; controls are much farther apart than in iOS 26 (right).</em></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>In iOS 26, tab bars show the results of this thinking: they feel cramped, squeezed to make room for the ever present search button that lingers in the bottom‑right corner of nearly every page.</p>
<figure><img alt="Comparison between the app store in the old and new iOS design. The new iOS visually splits the search into a seperate pill pushing the other icons closer together." height="730" loading="lazy" src="https://media.nngroup.com/media/editor/2025/10/06/app-store.png" width="692">
<figcaption><em>App Store in iOS 18 vs iOS 26: In iOS 26 (right) the tab bar at the bottom of app pages has become split between navigation and search — with search taking a larger space and navigation categories being crammed into each other.</em></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Because this button hovers apart from the rest of the bar, navigation feels fragmented. One control floats off on its own while the others are bunched together, breaking the sense of a unified control area and making the whole bar harder to scan at a glance. <strong>The heavy emphasis on search feels borrowed from Google’s playbook,</strong> which is ironic given Apple’s reputation for building its own distinct design language.</p>
<h2 id="toc-predictability-lost-3">Predictability, Lost</h2>
<p>We’ve long known that constantly changing interfaces are a nightmare. Back in the day, Microsoft Office experimented with adaptive menus that reordered themselves based on recency. People hated them because nothing stayed where you left it. You had to rescan the menu every single time. The interface could not be learned because it was constantly changing.</p>
<p>Apple seems to have learned nothing from that lesson. In iOS 26, controls appear, vanish, collapse, and expand depending on context. The tab bar collapses whenever search is activated, making room for the field.</p>
<figure><img alt="When the search bar is clicked, the bar with the tabs &quot;summary&quot; and &quot;sharing&quot; shrink into a single icon. " height="762" loading="lazy" src="https://media.nngroup.com/media/editor/2025/10/06/health-nav-bar.gif" width="350">
<figcaption><em>Health: The tab bar collapses whenever the search box is expanded.</em></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Safari adds its own twist: the forward button appears and disappears depending on whether there is a page to go forward to. While this may seem logical in theory, in practice it disrupts consistency: changing the size and location of a target makes the interface harder to learn and less predictable.</p>
<figure><img alt="Two screenshots of the new Safari design. In one image there is only a back button, the second image features both a back and forward button in the controls. " height="729" loading="lazy" src="https://media.nngroup.com/media/editor/2025/10/06/safari-forward.PNG" width="692">
<figcaption><em>Safari: The browser toolbar sometimes contains only a back button (left), and sometimes it also includes a forward button (right).</em></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Instead of building reliable habits, users now have to play hide-and-seek with the navigation controls.</p>
<h2 id="toc-changing-conventions-4">Changing Conventions</h2>
<p>Search in earlier versions of iOS lived at the top of the page. In Mail or Messages, users had to scroll down to reveal the bar. It wasn’t the most discoverable pattern, but years of repetition made it second nature.</p>
<figure><img alt="A screenshot showing the old iOS design. It shows that the search bar was hidden by default, but would appear at the top if the user scrolled up." height="714" loading="lazy" src="https://media.nngroup.com/media/editor/2025/10/06/messages-ios18.PNG" width="692">
<figcaption><em>Messages (iOS 18): Search was hidden by default (left). To access it, users had to “pull down” the top of the page (right).</em></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Now, in iOS 26, search has migrated to the bottom of the screen and is always visible. For newcomers this might feel easier to find, but for long‑time users it’s a jarring break from habit that slows them down until the new pattern becomes ingrained. (Even if the new pattern might prove beneficial over time, <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/power-law-learning/">existing users must relearn it</a>, which in the short run means lost productivity and added frustration.)</p>
<figure><img alt="Comparison of the old and new iOS designs. In the old one, the search bar is at the top. The new one has it at the bottom." height="740" loading="lazy" src="https://media.nngroup.com/media/editor/2025/10/06/settings-search.PNG" width="698">
<figcaption><em>Settings app: Search is at the top in iOS 18 (left) and at the bottom in iOS 26 (right).</em></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>To complicate matters further, search is styled as a floating bar that sometimes interferes with page content. Its pale design also tends to fade into the background, making it easy to miss. In our past research on floating buttons, we found they work best when they stand out clearly — not when they blend in and risk being overlooked.</p>
<h2 id="toc-discoverability-in-decline-5">Discoverability in Decline</h2>
<p>The back button, once a friendly guide accompanied by a breadcrumb, has lost its trail. Instead of showing where you came from, it has no label now, leaving users to guess.</p>
<figure><img alt="Comparison of the old and new iOS. In the old one, the back button was a blue back arrow with &quot;Settings&quot; written beside it. In the new one, it is just a black-and-white back arrow icon." height="717" loading="lazy" src="https://media.nngroup.com/media/editor/2025/10/06/settings-general.PNG" width="692">
<figcaption><em>Settings: The back button used to have a breadcrumb next to it, indicating the page the user came from (left). In iOS 26 (right), that label has been removed.</em></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>This signals another transition (this time for the worse) to Android-style design, where page titles are left-aligned (instead of center-aligned), thus displacing the breadcrumb next to the back button. This design choice has the potential to cause major confusion for users, as some apps will still use a breadcrumb next to the back button, while others may replace the breadcrumb with the current-page title.</p>
<figure><img alt="A screenshot of the new App Store showing that the back button appears to have the current page's title next to it." height="761" loading="lazy" src="https://media.nngroup.com/media/editor/2025/10/06/ratings.PNG" width="350">
<figcaption><em>App Store: The current page’s title </em>Ratings and Reviews<em> takes the place of the iOS 16 back-button breadcrumb.</em></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Safari piles on with its own frustrations: the URL bar is squeezed between icons, truncated to the point where you can’t easily tell what site you’re on. And tabs, once a single tap away, are now hidden in an overflow ellipsis menu that demands extra steps. Not only does this design violate best practices for overflow menu (which requires that only nonessential actions be hidden there), but every additional tap is another second wasted — multiplied by the millions of times users switch tabs each day.</p>

<p>iOS 26 brings Liquid Glass controls laid over noisy backgrounds, jittery animated buttons, shrunken and crowded tab bars, collapsing navigation, and ubiquitous search bars. On top of that, it breaks long‑established iOS conventions, getting closer to Android design.</p>
<p><strong>Overall, Apple is prioritizing spectacle over usability</strong>, lending credibility to the theory that Liquid Glass is an attempt to distract customers from iOS 26’s lack of long-promised AI features.</p>
<p>The interface is restless, needy, less predictable, less legible, and constantly pulling focus rather than supporting seamless access to content. Instead of smoothing the path for everyday tasks, iOS 26 makes users relearn basics while enduring a constant parade of visual stunts.</p>
<p>Apple may call it Liquid Glass. To many users, it feels more like a fogged‑up window: pretty from a distance, but frustrating when you try to see beyond it.</p>
