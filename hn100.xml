    </div><p>A stem cell treatment helped improve the motor function of two out of four patients with a spinal cord injury in the first clinical study of its kind, Japanese scientists said.</p>

                                        
                                                                                  
                                         

                                                                                    <p>There is currently no effective <a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/treatment/" rel="tag">treatment</a> for paralysis caused by serious spinal cord injuries, which affect more than 150,000 patients in Japan alone, with 5,000 new cases each year.</p>
<p>Researchers at Tokyo's Keio University are conducting their study using <a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/induced+pluripotent+stem+cells/" rel="tag">induced pluripotent stem cells</a> (iPS)—created by stimulating mature, already specialized, cells back into a juvenile state.</p>
<p>They can then be prompted to mature into different kinds of cells, with the Keio researchers using iPS-derived cells of the neural stem.</p>
<p>The university said on Friday that the <a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/motor+function/" rel="tag">motor function</a> score for two patients improved after an operation to implant more than two million iPS-derived cells into a spinal cord.</p>
<p>No serious adverse event was observed for all four cases after a year of monitoring, the university said.</p>
<p>The research's main goal was to study the safety of injecting the cells.</p>
<p>Public broadcaster NHK reported that one of the two was an elderly man who suffered the <a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/injury/" rel="tag">injury</a> in an accident.</p>
<p>He is now able to stand without support and has started practicing walking, NHK said.</p>
<p>"We were able to achieve results in the world's first <a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/spinal+cord/" rel="tag">spinal cord</a> treatment with iPS," Hideyuki Okano, a Keio professor who heads the research, said, according to NHK.</p>
<p>Okano said the team hoped to move to a clinical trial that would be a step towards bringing the treatment to patients.</p>
<p>The university received <a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/government+approval/" rel="tag">government approval</a> for their initial study in 2019 and they carried out the first operation in 2022.</p>
<p>Details of the patients remain confidential, but the team is focusing on people who were injured 14-28 days before the operation.</p>
<p>The number of cells implanted was determined after safety experiments in animals.</p>

<p>HP also now provides disclaimers on the product pages for most of the printers that it sells, stating that the device “is intended to work only with cartridges that have a new or reused HP chip” and uses Dynamic Security “to block cartridges using a non-HP chip.”</p>
<p>“Periodic firmware updates will maintain the effectiveness of these measures and block cartridges that previously worked. A reused HP chip enables the use of reused, remanufactured, and refilled cartridges,” the disclaimer says, adding a link to <a href="https://support.hp.com/us-en/document/ish_7470520-7449625-16">a support page</a> about Dynamic Security. The support page notes that “most HP printers can be configured to receive updates either automatically or with a notification that allows you to choose whether to update or not." However, some HP programs, like Instant Ink, require users to enable automatic firmware updates on HP printers.</p>
<p>All this means that, despite the recently approved settlement, Dynamic Security remains a critical part of most HP printers, and HP will continue to feel entitled to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/03/customers-fume-as-hp-blocks-third-party-ink-from-more-of-its-printers/">use firmware updates</a> to suddenly block printers made after December 1, 2016, from using non-HP ink and toner. Owners of HP printers made after that date that allow automatic updates and still work with third-party accessories shouldn’t be surprised if that ability is suddenly bricked one day.</p>
<h2>Dynamic litigation</h2>
<p>While HP isn't paying a sum to class-action members this time, it has previously agreed to pay millions in relation to bricking printers: In 2022, it agreed to pay <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/09/hp-to-pay-eu-printer-customers-1-35-million-for-disabling-third-party-ink/">$1.35 million to European customers</a>, and in 2020, the Italian Antitrust Authority fined HP for 10 million euros. In 2019, HP said it would pay <a href="https://topclassactions.com/lawsuit-settlements/lawsuit-news/hp-ink-cartridge-monopoly-class-action-lawsuit-settles-1-5m/">$1.5 million</a> to settle a similar class-action case in California, and it paid approximately <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2018/05/03/hp_inc_to_compensate_buyers_for_blocking_third_party_ink_cartridges/">AUD$50 </a>each to Australian customers impacted by Dynamic Security in 2018.</p>
<p>There’s also an open case against HP regarding its ink practices, a class-action complaint filed in the US District Court for the Northern District of Illinois in January 2024. The lawsuit centers on <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/01/hp-sued-again-for-blocking-third-party-ink-from-printers-accused-of-monopoly/">Dynamic Security firmware updates</a> pushed “in late 2022 and early 2023" and accuses HP of creating a “monopoly in the aftermarket for replacement cartridges” [<a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/HP_Janunary_5_2023.pdf">PDF</a>]. The plaintiffs seek an order declaring that HP broke the law, an injunction against Dynamic Security, and monetary and punitive damages.</p>
<p>Another lawsuit, filed in mid-2022 about some HP all-in-one <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/08/the-printers-that-require-ink-to-scan-and-fax/">printers failing to scan or fax without ink</a>, was dismissed.</p>
<p>HP’s printer arm has other pressing matters to address, though. Earlier this month, a firmware update <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/03/firmware-update-bricks-hp-printers-makes-them-unable-to-use-hp-cartridges/">broke specific HP printer models</a>, preventing them from printing, even when using HP-brand ink. HP told Ars last week that it’s “actively working on a solution.”</p>

Reddit ranks as the second-largest traffic source, bringing in 311K visitors—significantly more than Google (193K). This isn’t a regular thing we see with sites.</p> <p>This suggests that people aren’t just searching for alternatives but are actively discussing and recommending them in forums, subreddits, and privacy-conscious communities.</p> <p>But here’s another interesting insight: Privacy-friendly search engines are also key traffic sources:</p> <ul> <li>DuckDuckGo: 33.8K visitors</li> <li>Ecosia: 13.5K visitors</li> <li>Qwant: 10.8K visitors</li> </ul> <p>This says something about the increasing preference for privacy-friendly tools, i.e., more people are actively using privacy-friendly search engines to discover other privacy-friendly alternatives.</p> <h2 id="top-5-categories-what-are-people-looking-for">Top 5 categories: What are people looking for?</h2> <p>A quick look at the “Top Pages” report tells us about the most popular top 5 categories:</p> <p>- Email providers</p> <p>- Search Engines</p> <p>- Cloud Computing Platforms</p> <p>- Navigation Apps</p> <p>- Web Analytics Services</p> <p>Upon expanding the report, we can take a deeper look at the most popular categories in terms of unique visitors, while comparing the engagement metrics.</p> <p><img src="https://plausible.io/uploads/top-pages-eu-alternatives.png" alt="top-pages-eu-alternatives" title="top-pages-eu-alternatives"></p> <p><strong>B2B categories win?</strong></p> <p>While categories like email providers, search engines, and navigation apps attract a large B2C audience, B2B categories are more diverse and consistently rank high.&nbsp;</p> <p>Businesses are actively seeking privacy-friendly analytics, hosting, and infrastructure alternatives, driving growth in EU-built tools.</p> <h2 id="not-just-a-european-trenddemand-goes-beyond-the-eu-borders">Not just a European trend—demand goes beyond the EU borders</h2> <p>Looking at the <a href="https://plausible.io/european-alternatives.eu?period=all&amp;keybindHint=A&amp;comparison=off&amp;match_day_of_week=true">all-time Countries report</a>: European countries make up the bulk of visitors (as expected), but the United States ranks fourth, sending over 100K visitors to the site!&nbsp;</p> <p>Even Canada and India make an appearance in the top 25, contributing decent amounts of visitors to the site.</p> <p>If you scroll all the way down, or simply look at the “Map view,” there’s hardly any part of the globe that’s not participating in the shift towards privacy-focused digital tools.</p> <p><img src="https://plausible.io/uploads/map-view.png" alt="map-view" title="map-view"></p> <p>Privacy-conscious users are everywhere.</p>  <p>Germany leads in visitor numbers, with 379K, and contributing 20.5% of the total traffic all-time! This is followed by the Netherlands (141K) and France (135K).

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I<span>n </span>1970, the Procurator General of the Discalced Carmelite Order, Finian Monahan, was summoned to the Vatican for a meeting. The subject of the meeting was a promising young American priest by the name of Reginald Foster. The head Latinist of the Vatican’s State Department had tapped Foster to write papal correspondence, which was at the time composed entirely in Latin. Foster wanted the job but was bound by a vow of obedience, and the decision would be made by his superiors. Monahan intended to resist. Foster, thirty years of age, had proven himself to be both supremely intellectually gifted and utterly reliable—a precious thing at a time when the Catholic Church’s religious orders were hemorrhaging priests. Monahan thought Latin was a dead end. He didn’t want to lose one of his best to a Vatican department that would only get less and less important every year. He said Foster would go to the Vatican “over my dead body.”</p>
<p>Foster remembers the meeting vividly. “So we arrive there, and we’re ushered into this office, and who do we find there but Ioannes Benelli,” Foster says, using Benelli’s Latin name, as was customary at the Vatican at that time. He continues:</p>
<p>Benelli was Paul <span>VI</span>’s hatchet man—whenever he wanted something to get done, he called on Benelli. He was very energetic—got things done, and no nonsense. Everyone was terrified of him. I was too, and now here we were in the room with him, and he turns to Monahan and says, “This is Foster?” The General said yes. Then Benelli said, “Thank you very much, we won’t be needing you anymore.” And he took me by the hand and brought me down to the State Department and that was the end of that. Monahan didn’t say a word. I was now working for the Pope, and it was like I was more or less out of the Carmelite Order. A lot of the time the Order didn’t even really know what I was doing.</p>
<p>Foster would spend the next forty years at the Vatican, part of a small team of scribes who composed the pope’s correspondence, translated his encyclicals, and wrote copy for internal church documents. His somewhat unique position between the Carmelite Order and the Vatican bureaucracy meant that in fact he had a great deal of freedom for a priest. Later in his career his loose tongue—some in the church called it a loose cannon—would attract the notice of journalists looking for interesting copy. “Sacred language?” he said when asked about Latin as the “sacred language” of the church. “In the first century every prostitute in Rome spoke it fluently—and much better than most people in the Roman Curia.” The Minnesota <span>Star Tribune</span> quoted him as saying “I like to say mass in the nude,” which caused a small Curial kerfuffle (Foster claims he was misquoted). He appeared in Bill Maher’s movie <span>Religulous</span>, which featured him agreeing with the proposition that the Vatican itself was at odds with the message of Jesus, that the pope should not be living in a palace, and that hell and “that Old Catholic stuff” was “finished” and “gone.” Foster says the pope received complaints from bishops and cardinals about his appearance. “They said ‘Who is this Latinist of yours and what the hell is he doing?’ They would have fired me for sure. But by the time the film came out I was sick and a few months away from retirement anyway. So they just waited it out and let me go quietly.” He had already been fired from his post at the pontifical Gregorian University for allowing dozens of students to take his classes without paying for them.</p>
<p>B<span>es</span>ides being the Pope’s Latinist and “one of the Vatican’s most colorful characters” (as the Catholic News Service called him), Foster has been a tireless champion of Latin in the classroom. Indeed, Foster’s greatest legacy may be as a teacher. “The most influential Latin teacher in the last half-century is Reggie Foster,” says Dr. Nancy Llewellyn, professor of Latin at Wyoming Catholic College. “That’s not just my opinion—that’s a fact. For decades, he had the power to change lives like no other teacher in our field. I saw him for an hour in Rome in 1985 and that one hour completely changed my life. His approach was completely different from every other Latin teacher out there, and it was totally transformative.”</p>
<p>
<h3>
A humanist par excellence.<br>
</h3>
</p>
<p>A humanist par excellence, Latin for Foster was not something to be dissected by linguistic analysis or serve as the raw data for a theory of gender or poetics: it was a language, a medium of human connection. I first met Foster in 1995, at his summer school, and couldn’t get enough: I returned seven times. No one on Earth was reading as much Latin as he and his students were, but he was more like an old-school newspaper editor than an academic: he wanted the <span>story</span>. But for that you actually had to know Latin, and know it well. Foster was ruthless about ignorance, and equally ruthless about anything that to him looked like mere academic posturing. “I don’t care about your garbage literary theory!” he barked at his students one day. “I can tell in about ten seconds if you know the Latin or if you are making it all up.” “Latin is the best thing that ever happened to humanity. It leaves you zero room for nonsense. You don’t have to be a genius. But it requires laser-sharp concentration and total maturity. If you don’t know what time of day it is, or what your name is, or where you are, don’t try Latin because it will smear you on the wall like an oil spot.” The number of Foster’s students runs into the thousands, and many of them are now themselves some of the most dedicated teachers in the field. “When I was in college I asked people, ‘Hey, we all know Latin is a language. Does anybody actually speak it anymore?’ And they told me there was one guy, some guy at the Vatican, who still spoke the language, and that was Fr. Foster,” says Dr. Michael Fontaine, a professor of Classics at Cornell University. “I said to myself, ‘I have to study with this guy.’ And that changed everything for me.” Dr. Paul Gwynne, professor of Medieval and Renaissance Studies at the American University of Rome, said of Foster, “He is not just the best Latin teacher I’ve ever seen, he’s simply the best teacher I’ve ever seen. Studying Latin with the Pope’s apostolic secretary, for whom the language is alive, using the city of Rome as a classroom . . . it changed my whole outlook on life, really.”</p>
<p>Time seems to bend around Foster, and past and present intertwine. When I wrote to Fr. Antonio Salvi, the current head of the Vatican’s Latin department, for comment about Foster, he responded entirely in Latin, beginning with four words that sounded like an old soldier praising Cato—“Probus vir, parvo contentus.” An upright man. Content with little. And in many ways Foster’s resembles the life of a medieval saint: at the age of six, he would play priest, ripping up old sheets as vestments. He entered seminary at thirteen. He said he wanted only three things in life: to be a priest, to be a Carmelite, and to do Latin. He has spent his entire life in great personal poverty. His cell had no mattress: he slept on the tile floor with a thin blanket. His clothes were notorious in Rome: believing that the religious habit no longer reflected the simple garb of the people as it once had, he gave up his cassock and bought his clothes at Sears: blue pants and a blue shirt, with brandless black sneakers. When it was cold he added a zip-up blue polyester jacket. The Vatican’s Swiss guards called him “il benzinaio,” the gas-station attendant. Reporting for work at the Vatican, he looked like someone called to fix one of the washing-machines in the laundry room. His outfit was more like something his own father, a plumber in Milwaukee, would have worn. When people would give him gifts, he would give them to the poor. He owned almost nothing, and his Vatican office was legendarily spare: a typewriter, pens and paper, one chair, one desk, and a Latin dictionary. Nothing mattered to him except Latin.</p>
<p>But through the Latin language and his work, Foster might just as well have been living during the Italian Renaissance. He made two exceptions to his no-gifts policy: books, because he loved them, and music, because he could not resist. He covered all his books in brown packing paper, and treated them as precious relics. The solitary pleasures of his cell were the words of Cicero and Leo Magnus, and the music of Handel and Haydn. And outside his cell he reveled in the artistic treasures of Rome. He would show visitors around the Vatican with evident pride, to Raphael’s loggia, a private balcony overlooking Bernini’s colonnade, or the Pauline Chapel (like the Sistine Chapel painted by Michelangelo, but closed to the public and reserved only for Vatican employees).</p>
<p>T<span>he</span> papal Latin secretaries have a storied history: the first to hold the office was St. Jerome, Latin secretary to Pope Damasus. During the Renaissance such Humanist luminaries as Lorenzo Valla and Poggio Bracciolini held the post. Foster was the first American so honored. “When I first started, there were two people in the Latin office,” Foster explained to me when I interviewed him for this profile. “They had traditional names, which they got rid of after Vatican <span>II</span>. One was the <span>Secretarius Brevium ad Principes</span>, the Secretary of Briefs to Princes. That was all the diplomatic correspondence. That was Cardinal Amleto Tondini, and it was his death that opened up a position for me. The other was the <span>Secretarius Ab Epistolis Latinis</span>, the secretary for the pope’s letters. That was Carlo Egger. It was Egger who was my teacher in Rome, and he was the one who wanted me to work with him. I remember the day like it was yesterday. He came into the classroom where I was studying and said ‘Foster, would you like to be the pope’s Latinist?’ and I said<span> </span>‘<span>Certissime</span>.’ ”</p>
<p>Foster’s Latin abilities turned out to be truly extraordinary. Fr. Salvi wrote to me: “He was at the Vatican for forty years. In that time he developed a reputation for being one of the greatest masters of the Latin language since the Renaissance.” He was a master of both types of tasks assigned the pope’s Latin secretaries: free composition and faithful translation. The papal correspondence is mostly freely composed, in a particular style known as the Curial style. Highly formulaic and traditional, it is laden with scriptural metaphors and classical flourishes. “He had such an incredible command of the language that he could work quickly and flawlessly,” says Monsignor Daniel Gallagher, who worked in the Latin office of the Vatican after Foster. “Whenever there was an urgent document that needed to be composed within minutes, everyone would turn to him.” Foster drafted acceptance speeches for three popes, each with an immediate deadline. The other part of the work consisted of official papal pronouncements, such as encyclicals. These are accepted as authoritative and translations into Latin must be extremely faithful and precise. “That’s the hard part,” Foster concedes. “Paul <span>VI</span>’s writing was very concrete, and avoided jargon. John Paul <span>II</span>—not so much. So how are we going to say ‘the economic consequences of globalization’ in Latin? That stuff doesn’t mean anything in Latin. You need to think.”</p>
<p>While Foster was adapting the Latin language to modern concepts, the general decline of the language his superior Monahan had foreseen picked up speed. Foster had first arrived in Rome in 1962, the year the Second Vatican Council opened. The entire Council was conducted in Latin: speeches, debates, drafting and editing and finalizing documents, everything was in Latin. “In those days they would play games where one bishop would recite a line of Vergil and the next guy had to give the next line and on they would go, until someone couldn’t remember a line. That’s all gone now.” The destruction of the Church’s Latin culture would remain the abiding sorrow of Foster’s life. But it was also an opportunity. By 1974 Foster was asked to start teaching a remedial Latin course. In 1977 he started teaching at the Pontifical Gregorian University, where he would teach for the next thirty years.</p>
<p>
<h3>
Foster wanted only people who loved Latin for its own sake.<br>
</h3>
</p>
<p>During that time he may well have undertaken the most strenuous teaching schedule ever attempted by a university professor. Rising every day at 3:58 <span>A.M.</span>, he said mass in Latin, graded papers, and then headed to his full-time job as papal Latin secretary. By 2:oo <span>P.M.</span> he would complete his day’s work at the Vatican and be ready to teach. Every year he taught ten semester-long courses at the Gregorian, from Latin rudiments to the most difficult authors. Beginning in 1985 he began a summer school, at the request of some students, to fill up his time in between semesters. Here, unconstrained by university policies and scheduling, he could teach as he desired: he hired space at his own expense, and taught six to eight hours every day, seven days a week for eight consecutive weeks. Sundays were not off days but day-long excursions into the countryside with twenty-page packets of Latin texts: to Cicero’s birthplace, Tiberius’s cave at Sperlonga, Horace’s villa in the Sabine mountains, and many other locations. The course was free and no one received any official credit for taking it—Foster wanted only people who loved Latin for its own sake. “Summer school” became a kind of legend in Rome, particularly within the American expatriate community (it was taught in English and attracted mostly Americans). By the late 1990s a hundred people were passing through every summer. He also tutored, kept up a vast correspondence, recorded a weekly radio program for Vatican Radio called “The Latin Lover,” did any interviews he could, and kept up his priestly duties, saying mass and hearing confessions. All this while serving as the pope’s Latin secretary.</p>
<p>This Herculean effort led to Alexander Stille calling him “a one-man Audubon Society for the Latin language, determined to save it from extinction.” Stille, a journalism professor at Columbia University, wrote a lengthy profile of Foster—still the best in print—which appeared in <span>The American Scholar </span>in 1994 and was later gathered into his book <span>The Future of the Past. </span>Stille had doubts as to how much success Foster would have with his attempts to save Latin—he found his work “quixotic but compelling.”</p>
<p>F<span>os</span>ter is now approaching his eighties but is still teaching, now in the basement of the Milwaukee nursing home where he lives. Physically reduced—he can no longer walk—but still mentally fit, Foster has reduced his teaching load to six hours a week to work on consolidating his legacy. During his last years in Rome the signs of wear were evident—he would sometimes teach with a beer in hand, or lapse into angry tirades embarrassing to students and visitors. In 2008 he collapsed while teaching and nearly died in the hospital. Since his move to Milwaukee, he has grown healthier and more productive. October 2016 saw the publication of his first book, <span>The Mere Bones of Latin (Ossa Latinitatis Sola)</span>,<span> </span>from The Catholic University of America Press.<span><span id="footnote-000-backlink"><a href="#footnote-000">1</a></span></span> A second volume is nearly ready to go to press, though Foster, ever intent on doing things his own way, has been squabbling about fonts and covers.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Foster’s students have become the teachers, and the decades he spent dedicated to his students are now showing signs of paying off. “You have to understand that many if not most of the people who went through Foster’s classes were Latin teachers when they got there, or became Latin teachers later,” says Matthew McGowan, professor of Classics at Fordham. “That has had a ripple effect through the entire discipline. People know that there’s a way to do Latin the way Foster did it—with passion and pleasure. And with real human connection. And it’s starting to take off.”</p>
<p>Second-generation efforts by Foster’s students—known as “Reginaldians”—are becoming respectable enterprises in their own right. Anthony Grafton, professor of history at Princeton, wrote a piece in <span>The Nation </span>in 2015 where he confessed that the single most dramatic change during his forty years in academia had occurred in the past four or five years, when suddenly he began seeing “an infestation of undergraduate genius” and “an outbreak of inspired work,” which he traced back to a cadre of Foster’s students. In 2008 Foster was too sick to finish his summer school; in 2009 none was held. But by 2010 a pair of Reginaldians, Jason Pedicone and Eric Hewett, reconceived Foster’s school as their “Living Latin in Rome” program for college students, and started a not-for-profit called the Paideia Institute to keep it going. Since its founding, Paideia has moved from success to success, growing as quickly as a Humanities start-up possibly could, now running Latin programs in Rome, Paris, Provence, and New York, a Greek program in Greece, an online Classics journal called Eidolon, as well as elementary-school Classics enrichment programs at fifteen different sites throughout the United States. Last summer Paideia had more than a hundred people involved in its programs in Rome alone. In 2016, Paideia’s founders were presented with the President’s Award from the Society for Classical Studies, the highest honor in the field of Classics, a kind of capture-the-castle moment for Foster alumni. In Grafton’s glowing panegyric for the Institute he writes:</p>
<p>Reginaldus’s method remains the groundwork of their teaching, and he himself is present in the conversation every day, as the ruling spirit. They celebrate him with inspiring loyalty. But they have also found ways to build an infrastructure—something Reginaldus’s courses lacked. . . . Paideia has five universities as institutional members—Brown, Cornell, Dartmouth, Harvard and Princeton. They support Paideia by sending students to study and faculty members to teach in its programs.</p>
<p>That was in 2015. By the end of 2016, Paideia counted nineteen universities among its institutional members.</p>
<p>Paideia isn’t even the only not-for-profit inspired by Foster. In 1997, Nancy Llewellyn founded the Septentrionale Americanum Latinitatis Vivae Institutum, the North American Institute of Living Latin Studies, or <span>salvi</span> for short. <span>salvi</span> promotes the use of active-language pedagogy in the teaching of Latin—the kind of speaking and hearing that Llewellyn first saw when she met Foster. More than two hundred people are expected to pass through <span>salvi</span>’s programs in 2017, which will take place not only in New York and California, but also West Virginia and South Africa.</p>
<p>What is most exciting about these developments is these programs are generating the same kind of enthusiasm as the Foster classes that inspired them: “I’ve not looked at Latin the same way since.” “An initiation.” “Without a doubt the most valuable course I have ever attended in my academic career.” “Transformative.” “Mindbending.” “All people that want the classical languages to survive should really be doing these courses.” Foster’s model has proven to be imitable (though his energy and expertise is not—Paideia last year used six teachers to cover what Reginaldus would do alone).</p>
<p>
<h3>
Foster ended up teaching an entire generation of church leaders.<br>
</h3>
</p>
<p>And Foster taught innumerable other teachers, who have been at work in schools from Santa Monica High School to Harvard University. And the fact that the Catholic Church sends its most promising young priests to Rome means that Foster ended up teaching an entire generation of church leaders. “His alumni are filling ecclesiastical offices, tribunals, and episcopal cathedrae throughout the world right now,” says Fr. Daniel Gallagher from his Vatican office. “And because of that, things are much better off for Church Latin than they were forty years ago.” Foster confirms this: “I don’t keep up on what’s going on all over the world, but I can go through almost every episcopal see in the Midwest and the bishop now is a former student of mine.”</p>
<p>W<span>ha</span>t was it that was so revolutionary in Foster’s approach? Some sense of what the experience was like can be found in his new book, the <span>Ossa Latinitatis. </span>The book is divided not into chapters or lessons but “experiences” and “encounters.” The language is significant. Foster’s method was primarily to be present in the room when exposing students to real Latin. He would settle on one particular thing he wanted students to look for, cold-call, and then correct mistakes publicly. About this method he said, “You don’t need a hydrology course to learn to swim. You don’t point at the water and say, ‘This is water, this is how water works.’ <span>you just throw the babies in.</span>”</p>
<p>A<span>s </span>with throwing babies into swimming pools, the method depends on the presence of a teacher, and is not for autodidacts. But as a template for trained teachers, the book is priceless. And a glance at the readings shows what kind of intellectual experience Foster’s students got. The book is more or less a transcript of Foster’s 2010–11 Latin classes in Milwaukee. The vast majority of students who study Latin study five or fewer authors (Caesar, Cicero, Vergil, Ovid, and Catullus), and take four or more years to see even those five. A select percentage of students may read as many as half a dozen more. But students who studied with Foster in 2011 read what can be found in <span>Ossa</span>: all of those five authors, plus Roger Bacon’s <span>Compendium of Philosophy</span>, Lucretius’s <span>On the Nature of Things</span>, the correspondence of Marcus Aurelius with his teacher Fronto, Seneca’s <span>Consolation to Helvia</span>, Raphael’s epitaph, the personal letters of Anselm of Canterbury, the dedicatory plaque of the cathedral of Milwaukee, Boccaccio’s <span>On Famous Women</span>, Tacitus on the Germans, Clement <span>XIV</span> on the suppression of the Jesuits, Kepler’s <span>Commentary on Galileo’s Starry Messenger</span>, Walter of Chatillon’s twelfth-century <span>Satire Against the Curia</span>, Antonius Galateus’s <span>Hermit</span>, Giovanni Pietro Maffei’s sixteenth-century description of China, documents from the Councils of Constance, Trent, Vatican <span>I</span> and <span>II</span>, and dozens more texts by dozens more authors: Livy, Raymond Lull, Ambrose, Bede, John Paul <span>II</span>, Thomas More, Tibullus, Plautus. Foster’s method put back together what language courses generally separate: the experience of learning a language and the cultural value of knowing it.</p>
<p>What the book cannot give, of course, is the experience of not only reading these texts with Foster but strolling through the streets of Rome with him. For that we will need his like—or to wait for the Reginaldians to start writing memoirs. Alexander Stille writes of him:</p>
<p>Seeing Rome with Reginald Foster is somewhat like hearing music for the first time. The city is threaded with a vast web of Latin inscriptions. They line the cornices of buildings, the base of statues and monuments, the tops of fountains and gates. The biographies of tens of thousands of dead souls are carved onto tombs and sarcofagi. They provide a running commentary on all you see, although virtually all of Rome’s three million inhabitants walk by without noticing them. To see Rome without having access to this Latin subtext is like going to the opera without a libretto—you can love the music, the singing, and the spectacle but you miss a lot of the drama.</p>
<p>Foster has lived his life immersed in the river of recorded human experience that is the Latin language. “It’s as if the whole Latin tradition—Classical, Medieval, Renaissance—came down to just one man,” Michael Fontaine says. “He was like the funnel-point for all that culture. And he worked tirelessly to bring it to people—hundreds, thousands of people. And now it comes down to the rest of us to carry it on.”</p>

Search Google Maps, and your local eateries are bound to be arranged into “Thai” or “Italian”. &nbsp;Hop over to </span><a href="https://www.tasteatlas.com/" rel="">Taste Atlas</a><span>, and you’ll find little country flags next to each article. On Reddit’s /r/cooking, it’s practically a semi-annual tradition to see someone </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/gu6xfh/nearly_every_suggestion_i_got_for_my_every/" rel="">attempting to make ‘food around the world’</a><span>, dutifully hopping around the globe nation-state by nation-state. When Good Mythical Morning guesses where a certain dish is around the world, they throw a dart at </span><a href="https://youtu.be/UjtwYNnVOQU?si=bPHZW5yCutdwr_79&amp;t=351" rel="">a map divided into… countries</a><span>. These divisions can even turn into a political project – food slotting in right there next to the national anthem and the flag emoji.</span></p><p><span>And in fairness, it’s certainly not </span><em>complete</em><span> bullshit. Borders set trading networks, so they often set what ingredients are available. Borders (often) set a language, so they set the linguistic pathways of how recipes spread.</span></p><p><span>But at the same time, it’s… </span><em>kind of</em><span> bullshit, right? Like, people in New York eat much more similarly to people in Toronto (or maybe even Sydney!) than they do to people in New Orleans. Geography matters. Culture matters. And these things quite often don’t neatly align to the various colors on the map.</span></p><p><span>And it’s in China, perhaps, where the </span><em>one country, one cuisine </em><span>model goes to die most violently.

How to define the boundary of a ‘cuisine’ is not obvious. I went into (probably overly excruciating) detail about our methodology in the accompanying video, so I won’t re-hash too much of it here. Our rules of thumb were:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Passing The 50% Rule.</strong><span> If you’d estimate that more that 50% of the dishes are ‘unique’, and the dishes that remain often have different versions, it’s a separate cuisine.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Culinary Self-Determination.</strong><span> Do the people themselves (particularly the food world) make a distinction between cuisines? E.g. people in Louisiana are quick to make a distinction between Cajun food and Creole food, so to us this would be two distinct cuisines - even if the differences may not be overly obvious to an outsider.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Failing the ‘Mutual Intelligibility’ test.</strong><span> Imagine an old, talented home cook from one area. Would they be able to recreate a dish from another area solely from taste, without looking anything up?</span></p></li><li><p><strong>‘Culinary Continuums’ must be broken somewhere. </strong><span>A little like </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialect_continuum" rel="">dialect continuums</a><span> in linguistics, there can often be small changes in food between neighboring towns and cities - that then morph into large differences if you zoom out and look at either end of the continuum. Boundaries will ultimately arbitrary.</span></p></li></ul><p><span>There will likely be a lot of contention about some of these boundaries, and there’s </span><em>absolutely</em><span> stuff that we missed. We’re also personally the most familiar with the South of China, so differing opinions and viewpoints are more than welcome.</span></p><p>All we wanted to do was improve on the big eight.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong><span> Taiwan is included in the below maps because the lowland regions have been part of the China proper social-ecological system since the 1600s. As we discuss in our section on Taiwan ‘outside of mainland China’, this was then layered with other provincial Chinese cuisines as KMT forces fled to the island. It implies nothing about the political status of Taiwan.</span><code> </code></p><h6><em><strong><s>(we also don’t get in any trouble this way)</s></strong></em></h6><figure data-drag-handle="true" data-component-name="ImageGallery"><div><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa8882834-f99e-434e-810b-788569ca38a5_2560x2038.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_720,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa8882834-f99e-434e-810b-788569ca38a5_2560x2038.png 720w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_720,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa8882834-f99e-434e-810b-788569ca38a5_2560x2038.png" sizes="100vw" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa8882834-f99e-434e-810b-788569ca38a5_2560x2038.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_720,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa8882834-f99e-434e-810b-788569ca38a5_2560x2038.png 720w" width="720"></picture><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F437a236e-3e35-4b30-8be0-284c57d146e3_1920x1080.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_720,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F437a236e-3e35-4b30-8be0-284c57d146e3_1920x1080.jpeg 720w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_720,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F437a236e-3e35-4b30-8be0-284c57d146e3_1920x1080.jpeg" sizes="100vw" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F437a236e-3e35-4b30-8be0-284c57d146e3_1920x1080.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_720,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F437a236e-3e35-4b30-8be0-284c57d146e3_1920x1080.jpeg 720w" width="720"></picture></div><figcaption>Left, Location of Guangdong in China; Right, Breakdown of Guangdong Cuisines</figcaption></div></figure><p>We divided Guangdong into six cuisines (nine if you include Macau and Hong Kong). </p><p><strong>Cantonese</strong><span> is, of course, by far the most well known of the six and needs little introduction. </span></p><p><span>And yet, at the same time, I think the cuisine can sometimes be a bit misunderstood. If you ask ten Cantonese chefs what the ‘essence’ of Cantonese cuisine is, practically to the man they’ll reply ‘keeping the original flavor’. It’s a motto that works pretty well within a </span><a href="https://youtu.be/XlIWsRyXL8U?si=49A5_HeWPFc_GTYq&amp;t=543" rel="">Cantonese cultural context</a><span>: as a way to proudly distinguish yourself from the Sichuan and the Hunan. Less realized, I think, is that in an international 21st century context, the trope communicates as a self-own more than anything — a bit like  bragging about how wide your city’s downtown freeway is: </span><em>“okay, got it, Cantonese food is a stuffy old cuisine that doesn’t know how to season things”.</em></p><p><span>And while it’s certainly true that Cantonese food opts not to impress with chili peppers by the fistful, this isn’t exactly Scandinavian hospital food either. Black fermented soybeans feature prominently, ditto with other fermented sauces. The use of dried seafood and mushrooms — practically umami concentrates —  is ubiquitous. Hell, on an international scale, they might even be </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQhUm7A4lrc" rel="">less afraid of the chili pepper</a><span> than their reputation might suggest…</span></p><p><span>Instead, to me, Cantonese cuisine is all about </span><em>The Democratization of the Haute. </em><span>In the age of Imperial China, there was a sort of ‘national cuisine’ of the elite called </span><em>Guanfu </em><span>cuisine, which we’ll touch more on in our discussion on Beijing. During the 19th century, the merchant class in Canton grew in breadth and depth, and the food they ate ended up borrowing quite a bit philosophically from that </span><em>Guanfu</em><span> tradition. </span></p><p><span>And what was </span><em>that</em><span> tradition all about? Well, outside of simply showing off (the food of the elite forever rhymes), that cuisine particularly loved the playful manipulation of form.</span></p><p><span>To illustrate, the Cantonese Pearl River is the land of two fish - the </span><em>lingyu</em><span> (Dace) and the </span><em>wanyu</em><span> (Asian Carp). And so, yes, they do sometimes opt to keep that ‘original flavor’ to make sashimi — and </span><a href="https://radii.co/article/south-chinese-sashimi-guangzhou" rel="">Shunde-style Sashimi</a><span> is quite delicious. But you can also chop some fish up real fine and use it as a stuffing (e.g. </span><a href="https://youtu.be/hQhUm7A4lrc?si=Sqk8Ic8KVfyjMXDI" rel="">for chilis</a><span>). Or you can take that paste, mix it with egg white, deep fry it and </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrDMF8Co0d4" rel="">get a dead wringer for tofu</a><span>. Or you could  pan-fry that fish, shred it, and toss it in a water chestnut starch-thickened soup and make a ‘</span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIcrD60ebpM" rel="">congee without rice</a><span>’. </span></p><p><span>You see this sort of thing again and again in Cantonese food — it’s a fun cuisine. I mean, on some level isn’t the entire Dim Sum cart “stuff stuffed in stuff, stuffed inside of other stuff”? What makes Cantonese food awesome is that every time you’re lounging al fresco at a </span><em>Daipaidong,</em><span> every time you’re grabbing steamer baskets from the Dim Sum house… you’re eating an echo of the Qing Dynasty elite. And that, I think, is a beautiful thing.</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F03c05ab7-8022-47af-8995-cc5f9f66f749_988x669.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F03c05ab7-8022-47af-8995-cc5f9f66f749_988x669.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F03c05ab7-8022-47af-8995-cc5f9f66f749_988x669.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F03c05ab7-8022-47af-8995-cc5f9f66f749_988x669.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F03c05ab7-8022-47af-8995-cc5f9f66f749_988x669.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F03c05ab7-8022-47af-8995-cc5f9f66f749_988x669.png" width="666" height="450.9655870445344" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/03c05ab7-8022-47af-8995-cc5f9f66f749_988x669.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:669,&quot;width&quot;:988,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:666,&quot;bytes&quot;:315824,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F03c05ab7-8022-47af-8995-cc5f9f66f749_988x669.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F03c05ab7-8022-47af-8995-cc5f9f66f749_988x669.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F03c05ab7-8022-47af-8995-cc5f9f66f749_988x669.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F03c05ab7-8022-47af-8995-cc5f9f66f749_988x669.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption>The Pearl River system. Classically, Cantonese culture is considered to follow west along the River Xi until roughly Nanning.</figcaption></figure></div><p><span>Of course, geographically speaking, this cuisine — together with Cantonese language and culture writ large — is quite bound to the </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearl_River" rel="">Pearl River system</a><span>. It starts from the delta smack dab in the middle of the province and continues </span><em>westward</em><span>. You can find Cantonese speakers all the way into the Guangxi province next to the Vietnam border, but hop one or two peninsula to the </span><em>east</em><span> of the Pearl River Delta and you’re already starting to get into a very different linguistic and culinary zone.</span></p><p><span>To the east, there are two primary cuisines: </span><strong>Teochew</strong><span> and </span><strong>Hakka</strong><span>. Teochew (Chaozhou, in Mandarin) may appear similar to Cantonese at first blush — neither cuisine features the chili pepper very prominently — but any apparent similarities are quite surface level. There’s not much crossover in dishes, and what dishes they </span><em>do</em><span> share often have different versions. Cantonese meals are based around white rice; Teochew meals </span><em>can</em><span> be served with rice or they can equally be served with </span><em>mue</em><span> (糜), a thin rice porridge often paired with salty preserves. </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teochew_Min" rel="">Teochew language</a><span> is mutually unintelligible with Cantonese and more closely resembles the </span><em>Min</em><span> languages next door in the Fujian province.</span></p><p><span>With that said, Teochew and Cantonese have obviously had more than a little bit of contact over the centuries. Besides being not all that far apart, both cities were famed for their (rival) merchant classes. Both groups helped build the twin economic engines of Hong Kong (a bit more Cantonese than Teochew) and Shenzhen (a bit more Teochew than Cantonese). This is why </span><a href="https://www.lifestyleasia.com/hk/dining/food/best-fish-balls-hong-kong/" rel="">Hong Kong fishballs</a><span> are generally the Teochew style, and why you can find Teochew-style </span><em>Cheong Fun </em><span>variants on the streets of Chaozhou and Shenzhen. </span></p><p><strong>Hakka</strong><span>, meanwhile, are </span><a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Hakka" rel="">a fascinating Chinese subgroup</a><span> thought to have migrated over the centuries from the north of the country down into the south. Precisely why that was is hotly debated, but by the late Qing they nonetheless ended up settling down in the mountainous bits of Jiangxi, Fujian, and Guangdong. As migrants, they were often confined to land that was less productive agriculturally, and the sweet potato formed the foundation of the traditional Hakka diet. Historically, there was no love lost between Hakka and Cantonese - </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punti%E2%80%93Hakka_Clan_Wars" rel="">there were even wars fought over land in the mid 19th century</a><span>.</span></p><p>These days however, that history is a distant memory. But Hakka food still bears some imprint of it - while rice is the modern staple, sweet potato features much more heavily than in Teochew and Cantonese. And - apocryphally, at least - a number of classic Hakka dishes are thought to have been forged from attempting to make wheat-flour based northern Chinese foods in a new land that didn’t really have much wheat (e.g. their stuffed tofu is said to be a dumpling equivalent, though I think it’d be fair to register that claim as… ‘debatable’).</p><p><strong>Dong River Hakka</strong><span>, meanwhile, consist of Hakka communities in Huizhou, Dapeng (Shenzhen), and other bits scattered around the Pearl River Delta</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-1-151441573" href="https://chinesecookingdemystified.substack.com/p/63-chinese-cuisines-the-complete#footnote-1-151441573" target="_self" rel="">1</a></span><span>. This is one of those ‘culinary self determination’ internal divisions, as Dong River Hakka is generally considered a distinct by many Hakka chefs. A reasonable argument could be made that the food in this area is really more of a cross between Hakka and Cantonese than a distinct cuisine per se, but admittedly we haven’t spent much time in the epicenter of Huizhou.</span></p><p><span>Returning back to the Pearl River system, as Cantonese moves to the west and into the hills, the food begins to change. Flavors become stronger, you start to see some echoes of non-Han influence (e.g. steaming in bamboo), and fermented ingredients start to appear more often than the Cantonese mainstay of dried ingredients. We drew the line between Cantonese proper and its more strongly flavored cousin (“Xi River” cuisine) at the province border, but a little east or west would also make sense. In the hills, we also chose to separate </span><strong>Lianzhou </strong><span>- an area with a good chunk of </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yao_people" rel="">Yao people</a><span> influence - out as a distinct cuisine. </span></p><p><span>The </span><strong>Coastal</strong><span> west of Guangdong shares a number of similarities with Cantonese, and could perhaps be lumped in with Cantonese if you were feeling lumpy. That said, the south of Guangxi along the gulf of Tonkin (Beihai), the lowlands of Hainan (Haikou), and the Leizhou peninsula in Guangdong (Zhanjiang) bear some striking similarities - this region sometimes being referred to as ‘</span><em>Qin-Lian-Lei-Qiong</em><span>’ (钦廉雷琼). The prominence of seafood would probably be the most obvious element of the cuisine to a traveler, but things are also starting to get a bit more heavily seasoned, ala the food in neighboring Guangxi. Their mixed rice dishes are also renowned - most famously the Haikou area’s </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hainanese_chicken_rice" rel="">chicken rice</a><span>, which over the years became a </span><a href="https://guide.michelin.com/sg/en/article/dining-out/8-michelin-listed-spots-for-chicken-rice" rel="">favorite throughout Southeast Asia </a><span>as well. Also interspersed in this area are also communities of Teochew speakers (lost on their way to Southeast Asia, perhaps?), which also influenced the food in a number of ways, most obviously with various rice products called </span><em>he (籺).</em></p><figure data-drag-handle="true" data-component-name="ImageGallery"><div><div><picture><source type="image/webp"

Pictured is a local congee restaurant in Jieyang city with fish and seafood laid out front. Choose your seafood, the kitchen whips it up, and you enjoy it next to some </span><em>mue </em><span>congee.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Guorou (裹肉).</strong><span> </span><em>Bottom right.</em><span> Common to the area are various forms of ‘rolls’ containing meat or seafood, rolled up in thin tofu sheets then steamed to form.

Hakka cuisine loves its stuffed stuff, with tofu being the most famous. It comes in many different shapes, fillings, and ways of serving. Pictured is a variety stuffed with minced pork and salted fish, served in an (excellent) pork broth.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Mixed ‘Yan’ Hakka Noodles (腌面).</strong><span> </span><em>Top middle</em><span>. While you can find various types of “Hakka Noodles” all around the world, pictured is the OG version - a simple and delicious affair of noodles mixed with lard, fish sauce, and deep-fried garlic, served along side a bowl of pork bone soup. </span></p></li><li><p><strong>Mixed ‘Yan’ Beef (腌牛肉).</strong><span> </span><em>Top right</em><span>. Mixed, or ‘yan’ dishes feature heavily in Hakka cuisine. In addition to the mixed noodles above, mixed beef is another common dish of its category. There are regional variations - pictured is a Meizhou sort mixed with garlic, chili oil, and Chinese fermented black soybeans.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Salt-Baked Chicken (盐焗鸡).</strong><span> </span><em>Bottom right</em><span>. Salt baked chicken is a Hakka classic that has a couple variants. The most traditional way of making it is baking an entire chicken (wrapped in paper) in a large wok of salt. The meat keeps well and is quite firm, as shown.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Taro balls and Daikon balls (芋头丸/萝卜丸).</strong><span> </span><em>Bottom middle</em><span>. Hakka cuisine loves its balls. Meatballs are obviously classic as well, but pictured is (1) a steamed Daikon ball made from mixing shredded Daikon with sweet potato starch and (2) Taro ball made in a similar fashion. Deep frying is also a popular route.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Faban, rice cupcake (发粄). </strong><em>Bottom right</em><span>.  Pictured is a fluffy rice cupcake called </span><em>faban</em><span> (发粄), colored with red yeast rice. In Hakka language, the latter character, ‘ban’ (粄), is a catch-all term that can be used to describe anything made from dough or batter - from cupcakes, to pancakes (麦粄), to dumplings (艾粄), to noodles (老鼠粄), and even jelly (草粄). </span></p></li></ul><figure data-drag-handle="true" data-component-name="ImageGallery"><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4fcc01ab-c934-469c-b05e-dbd15315c808_1080x1440.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_474,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4fcc01ab-c934-469c-b05e-dbd15315c808_1080x1440.jpeg 474w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_474,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4fcc01ab-c934-469c-b05e-dbd15315c808_1080x1440.jpeg" sizes="100vw" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4fcc01ab-c934-469c-b05e-dbd15315c808_1080x1440.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_474,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4fcc01ab-c934-469c-b05e-dbd15315c808_1080x1440.jpeg 474w" width="474"></picture><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F22c08e95-2709-4fc1-9666-998542aa464b_1080x1440.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_474,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F22c08e95-2709-4fc1-9666-998542aa464b_1080x1440.jpeg 474w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_474,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F22c08e95-2709-4fc1-9666-998542aa464b_1080x1440.jpeg" sizes="100vw" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F22c08e95-2709-4fc1-9666-998542aa464b_1080x1440.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_474,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F22c08e95-2709-4fc1-9666-998542aa464b_1080x1440.jpeg 474w" width="474"></picture><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F17ddfc13-c9ec-475d-a8f9-2eeceb32cb65_1080x1440.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_474,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F17ddfc13-c9ec-475d-a8f9-2eeceb32cb65_1080x1440.jpeg 474w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_474,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F17ddfc13-c9ec-475d-a8f9-2eeceb32cb65_1080x1440.jpeg" sizes="100vw" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F17ddfc13-c9ec-475d-a8f9-2eeceb32cb65_1080x1440.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_474,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F17ddfc13-c9ec-475d-a8f9-2eeceb32cb65_1080x1440.jpeg 474w" width="474"></picture></div></figure><p><em><strong>Representative dishes:</strong></em></p><ol><li><p><strong>Dongjiang-style Stuffed Tofu (东江酿豆腐).</strong><span> </span><em>Left</em><span>.

The </span><em>laoyou </em><span>‘ol buddy’ flavor profile is a mix of garlic, sour bamboo shoot, pickled chili, and Chinese fermented black soy bean. The </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8sYCZR_bTk" rel="">original version of the dish was a pork noodle soup</a><span>, but over the years rice noodles (pictured) also became quite common, and its popularity inspired many other dishes like ‘ol buddy’ rice cakes, snails, stir fried beef, etc.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Lemon Duck (柠檬鸭).</strong><span>&nbsp;</span><em>Top Middle. </em><span>A classic Guangxi truck driver dish that over the years became signature to </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanning" rel="">Nanning</a><span> city. It consists of a braised duck that leans on very Cantonese-feeling technique at first blush, but seasons heavily with preserved lemon and Guangxi’s dried Murraya fruit (鸡皮果).</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Paper Wrapped Chicken (纸包鸡).</strong><span>&nbsp;</span><em>Top Right. </em><span>This chicken is first marinated, then wrapped with a type of paper meant for culinary use called </span><em>yukou</em><span> paper (玉扣纸). It’s then deep fried low and slow - the final result being texturally similar to roast chicken (albeit one that’s been cooking for a while in its own juices). </span></p></li><li><p><strong>Breakfast Rice Noodle Soup with Guangxi-style Char Siu (叉烧粉).</strong><span>&nbsp;</span><em>Bottom left. </em><span>A simple breakfast of pork stock and flat rice noodles. It’s topped with an array of sour and spicy pickles, together with Guangxi style Char Siu BBQ Pork - a heavily spiced and deep fried Char Siu variant. </span></p></li><li><p><strong>Guangxi-style Cheongfun (广西肠粉).</strong><span>&nbsp;</span><em>Bottom middle. </em><span>Similar at its core to the classic Cantonese </span><em>cheongfun</em><span> rice noodle rolls, but with bolder flavors and topped with a very ‘Xi River’ herb - purple perilla leaves.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Nanning-style Zongzi (粽).</strong><span>&nbsp;</span><em>Bottom right. </em><span>Xi River Zongzi – sticky rice dumplings – are similar in style to western bit of the Cantonese world </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhaoqing" rel="">around Zhaoqing</a><span>. This swath uses sticky rice and shelled mung beans as a base, but what makes the Nanning variant stand out is the addition of </span><em>kourou (扣肉)</em><span> – deep fried-and-braised tender slabs of taro and pork belly slab. The package is then tightly wrapped in leaves and cooked for hours.</span></p></li></ul><figure data-drag-handle="true" data-component-name="ImageGallery"><div><div><picture><source type="image/webp"

</em><span>The Liu River that flows through Liuzhou city also brings in one of the most important ingredients to the city – fresh water snails the famed </span><em>luosifen</em><span> noodle soup. The soup consists of a bowl of rice noodles, served in a snail stock, and topped with sour bamboo shoots and chili. There’s a meme that the dish is ‘stinky’ but that’s mostly a function of low quality mass produced or packaged varieties - the </span><em>luosifen</em><span> authentic to Liuzhou doesn’t have much of an odor at all. </span></p></li><li><p><strong>Guilin Rice Noodles (桂林米粉).&nbsp;</strong><em>Top middle. </em><span>Guilin rice noodles (at least in Guilin itself) is served as a mixed noodle with soup on the side. The rice noodles are mixed with fermented bamboo shoot, peanuts, scallion, and topped with chili oil and crispy deep fried pork belly (锅烧).</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Horse Meat Rice Noodles (马肉米粉).&nbsp;</strong><em>Top right. </em><span>Not a typo - yep, horse meat. A quite traditional dish, this rice noodle is served topped with a cured horse jerky,  within a horse bone broth. </span></p></li><li><p><strong>Beer Fish (啤酒鱼).&nbsp;</strong><em>Bottom left. </em><span>If a traveler finds themselves in the (gorgeous, admittedly) tourist town of Yangshuo, beer fish may be a their first introduction to the “local food”.

It’s an incredibly rugged, mountainous province that historically served as an imperial outpost, a pit stop on the way to Yunnan and </span><a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Gejiu" rel="">its productive tin mines</a><span>. </span><strong>Han Guizhou</strong><span> consists of the lowlands, and today is centered around the cities of Guiyang, Zunyi, and Anshun. </span></p><p>The food is heavily seasoned. There’s an old, increasingly worn out saying in China that “the Sichuanese can handle their heat (四川人不怕辣), that the neighboring Hunan province isn’t afraid of their chilis (湖南人辣不怕), but that people from Guizhou are afraid of food that’s not spicy enough (贵州人怕不辣)”. I’ve reluctantly repeated it on our channel before, though I’m not even sure how accurate it is (I might lean towards lower-river Sichuan as being the hottest, and I’ve also seen the quip presented in different ways). </p><p><span>Regardless, it certainly belongs to the category - you could definitely use Sichuanese food as a mental starting point. But layered onto that are influences from ethnic groups from the surrounding mountains, particular with regards to various ferments - </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWEkOjt_BVc" rel="">Fermented Tomato Catfish soup</a><span> being probably the most famous. If Yunnan food is a chunky stew of different ethnic cuisines, you could maybe think of Guizhou food as something a bit more blended.</span></p><p><span>Still, once you get up into the mountains - in Dong, Bouyei, and Hmong (Miao) Guizhou - things become increasingly less “Han”. Dong Guizhou, for instance, has flavors like fermented shrimp and </span><em>niubie</em><span> - flavors that, to me, </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAViVtJ4Seo" rel="">harken much closer to Laos and Thai Isaan</a><span> than they do neighboring Sichuan.

of Anshun was an important military outpost since Ming Dynasty, and as such has strong Han food traditions - these flaky Baozi being among them. The flakiness comes from </span><em>laomian</em><span> (Chinese style ‘sourdough’) and laminated with lard. Pictured is our favorite filling -  the “three delicacies” of scallion pork, washed bean paste, and perilla seeds.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Goat Rice Noodle Soup (贵州羊肉粉).&nbsp;</strong><em>Top middle. </em><span>A popular rice noodle soup throughout Guizhou, and has since spread all across China. It’s made by stewing large chunks of goat meat and organ in with a special mix of spices (a spice pouch of 36 spices, give or take). Once done, the goat meat’s taken out, wrapped up with cloth, and pressed to firm up before thinly slicing into thin pieces. Upon ordering, the cook’ll quickly blanch rice noodles in hot water, pour over the goat stock, and top with few pieces of goat meat and organ. Goat rice noodle soup has four major schools in Guizhou – Shuicheng (水城), Xingyi (兴义), Jinsha (金沙), and Zunyi (遵义), respectively. Jinsha claims to be the original. The one in Shuicheng features fragrant chili oil and chili crisp, Xingyi tops with a special fermented wheat sauce, and Zunyi mixes deeply toasted chili flakes into the soup itself.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Douchi Hotpot (豆豉火锅).&nbsp;</strong><em>Top right. </em><span>Perhaps could be thought of as half a hotpot, half a sauce. The base of the pot is made with minced pork, lightly fermented soybeans, and a preponderance of chilis. Upon ordering, the pork’s fried at the table to first render out some oil, then fried together with said chilis and the titular fermented soybean. Pork stock is then added, and the meal continues as a hotpot would. As the concoction reduces, you complete the meal by mixing the progressively thicker soup over rice.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Deep Fried Tangyuan with Fermented Mustard Greens (酸菜炒汤圆).&nbsp;</strong><em>Bottom left. </em><span>This dish is a bit infamous, belonging to the so-called “dark cuisine of China” (黑暗料理) according to the Chinese internet. It consists of sweet, black sesame filled sticky rice balls, deep fries them, and then stir-fries </span><em>that</em><span> with fermented mustard greens and dried chili pepper (and seasons with a non-insignificant quantity of MSG). It feels weird because it </span><em>is</em><span> kind of weird. I’d grant that it might be closing in on the Chinese equivalent of fair food, but it’s also - in my humble opinion - actually quite delicious. </span></p></li><li><p><strong>Si Wa Wa (丝娃娃).&nbsp;</strong><em>Bottom center. </em><span>A spring pancake rolled up with an array of fillings including vegetables, pickles, and tofu products… eaten together with a characteristic sauce made from a fermented sour soup. The name itself (lit. ‘silk baby’) refers to wrapping a baby in swaddling cloths - sort of a stretch, but hey.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Breakfast Sticky Rice Bowl (贵阳糯米饭).&nbsp;</strong><em>Bottom right. </em><span>The breakfast sticky rice bowls ubiquitous to the morning streets in Guiyang city were originally a sticky rice </span><em>balls </em><span>- something meant for the road and mixed with lard, soy sauce, and </span><em>Cuishao, </em><span>Guizhou-style cracklins. Over the years, it become increasingly common to see it in bowl form, with an ever increasing quantity of various toppings… kelp salad, shredded potato, deep fried peanut, fishwort, pink pickled daikon, sweet Cantonese sausage, etc etc etc.</span></p></li></ul><figure data-drag-handle="true" data-component-name="ImageGallery"><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe9bbc0ea-e758-453d-af51-d57f048f3588_1280x960.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_474,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe9bbc0ea-e758-453d-af51-d57f048f3588_1280x960.jpeg 474w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_474,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe9bbc0ea-e758-453d-af51-d57f048f3588_1280x960.jpeg" sizes="100vw" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe9bbc0ea-e758-453d-af51-d57f048f3588_1280x960.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_474,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe9bbc0ea-e758-453d-af51-d57f048f3588_1280x960.jpeg 474w" width="474"></picture><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbbd29ba5-ac98-4a02-a79f-90d6eedc9ac6_1080x1440.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_474,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbbd29ba5-ac98-4a02-a79f-90d6eedc9ac6_1080x1440.jpeg 474w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_474,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbbd29ba5-ac98-4a02-a79f-90d6eedc9ac6_1080x1440.jpeg" sizes="100vw" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbbd29ba5-ac98-4a02-a79f-90d6eedc9ac6_1080x1440.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_474,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbbd29ba5-ac98-4a02-a79f-90d6eedc9ac6_1080x1440.jpeg 474w" width="474"></picture><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F108bfaff-fb56-4b79-8829-4a241aa8b87b_1080x1440.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_474,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F108bfaff-fb56-4b79-8829-4a241aa8b87b_1080x1440.jpeg 474w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_474,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F108bfaff-fb56-4b79-8829-4a241aa8b87b_1080x1440.jpeg" sizes="100vw" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F108bfaff-fb56-4b79-8829-4a241aa8b87b_1080x1440.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_474,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F108bfaff-fb56-4b79-8829-4a241aa8b87b_1080x1440.jpeg 474w" width="474"></picture></div></figure><p><em><strong>Representative dishes:</strong></em></p><ul><li><p><strong>Fermented Tomato Catfish Soup (酸汤鱼).&nbsp;</strong><em>Left. </em><span>Originally a Hmong and Dong people’s way of eating, the fermented tomato base make use of small, sour local tomatoes (an incredibly sour cultivar called ‘wild tomatoes’, whose botanical name still eludes us). When cooked, it’s often mixed with sour fermented chilis and a ‘white sour soup’ that’s made from fermenting rice cooking liquid. It can be a base for cooking meat - catfish hotpot, most famously - or alternatively a starting point for a rice noodle soup (酸汤粉). </span></p></li><li><p><strong>Fermented Shrimp Paste Beef Pot (虾酸牛肉).&nbsp;</strong><em>Center. </em><span>The most famous fermented shrimp paste - “</span><em>xiasuan</em><span>” - is from </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dushan_County" rel="">Dushan county</a><span> in south Guizhou. </span><em>Xiasuan</em><span> consists of a mix of small fresh water shrimp, fermented with chili and sticky rice wine. The most classic way of eating is to stir fry it with beef and serve as a dry pot. Other ingredients can then be fried up together from this base like konjac jelly, lotus root, potato, etc. </span></p></li><li><p><strong>Niubie (牛瘪).&nbsp;</strong><em>Right. </em><span>Another ‘infamous’ dish that perhaps belongs to Chinese internet’s “dark cuisine hall of fame”. This dish belongs to a category of dish called </span><em>bie</em><span> or </span><em>pie</em><span>. It’s made by feeding a cow or goat a number of herbs before slaughter, then collecting them from the first stomach immediately after killing the animal. This digested herb liquid is then used as a base, into which the meat and organs from the animal will then be added. </span><em>Bie</em><span> appears in many contexts throughout the </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southeast_Asian_Massif" rel="">Southeast Asian Massif</a><span>, but in Guizhou is often served in hotpot form.

What’s there to say? The very name is evocative of the distance, a traveling destination with a borderline spiritual heft to it. And not just for westerners - in the Chinese psyche, Tibet holds a similar place.</p><p>But whether from the direction of Los Angeles or Shanghai, what often gets lost in the romanticism is that Tibet is a… real, actual place. With real, actual people living there - and doing so in an unfathomably harsh environment.</p><p><span>I highly suggest traveling to the Tibetan plateau. You may have heard that it’s difficult for foreigners to travel to Tibet, and it’s true that movement within the Tibet Autonomous region is restriction (possible, but restricted). And yet, the administrative region of “the Tibet Autonomous region” really only consists of the western half of the Tibetan cultural zone, which I would personally center more around </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chamdo" rel="">Qamdo</a><span> - extending eastward to Garzê and Ngawa in what’s administratively Sichuan, south to Dêqên in Yunnan, west to Lhasa, and North to Gyêgu (Yushu). Yushu is where I personally centered my time there traveling, and is highly recommended.</span></p><p>Food wise, however, I think it’s reasonable to right-size some expectations. Often I hear people in the west talk wistfully about Tibetan cuisine, impressions quite often laced with quite a bit of exoticism. I cringe a little inside when I see hipster fusion bars in America label their sriracha-laced dumplings as ‘Momo’ on their menus. Survival on the plateau is no joke, and Tibetan cuisine does an incredibly admirable - tasty, even! - job in aiding that project. </p><figure data-drag-handle="true"

If you were walking in blind to a random restaurant anywhere in China these days, the probability that it’d have at least </span><em>some</em><span> Sichuan fare somewhere on their menu might be roughly  50/50. </span></p><p><span>It’s a cuisine forged on migration. In-migration from </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhang_Xianzhong#Resettlement_of_Sichuan" rel="">the resettlement of Sichuan</a><span>, Chongqing’s role as the wartime capital, and its historical status as a breadbasket in China; out-migration during China’s post ‘78 boom as Sichuan people streamed to the coast to look for work. </span></p><p>But also during the 1980s, something else happened - Sichuan cuisine was actively standardized, promoted, and commercialized by the province’s local culinary associations. The Sichuan restaurant became an ecosystem that could be bought into - not quite a turn key operation, but almost. If you’re someone with a little bit of money, a desire to open a restaurant, and no direct F&amp;B experience, you have two logical not-hotpot paths to follow: the Cantonese restaurant, and the Sichuan restaurant. Recipes and menus are widely available for purchase. Equipment is standardized. Training is standardized. It’s certainly no accident that these are the two cuisines most available outside of China as well.</p><p>But it should be noted that within the modern restaurant environment, there ended up being a bit of a mishmash effect. Dishes seemed to be selected from around Sichuan, but in the province itself, there tends to be much more regionality. </p><p><span>Sichuan chefs tend to divide Sichuan cuisine into three schools. The </span><strong>Upper River Gang (</strong><span>上河帮</span><strong>) </strong><span>is centered around the Chengdu plain, and so (predictably) the cities of Chengdu, Meishan, and Leshan. Many of the classic Sichuan dishes that you know and love originally hail from this area - Mapo Tofu, Twice Cooked Pork, Kung Pao chicken, etc.</span></p><p><span>The </span><strong>Lower River Gang</strong><span> (下河帮) was borne out of the gritty trading towns that dot the upper reaches of the Yangtze river, and is centered around Chongqing. If the Chengdu is wing #4 on the </span><em>Hot Ones </em><span>gauntlet, Lower River is wing #7. Much more comfortable in the upper reaches of the Scoville scale, lower river Sichuan might conform a bit closer to the international stereotype of Sichuan cuisine as fuck-you-level-spicy.</span></p><p><span>In the south of Sichuan there is the </span><strong>Salt Gang </strong><span>(盐帮菜) school, whose name might take a touch of explaining. Historically, salt was a precious commodity in China, and </span><a href="https://cup.columbia.edu/book/the-merchants-of-zigong/9780231135962" rel="">the city of Zigong was a major epicenter of the trade during the Qing dynasty</a><span>. The ‘gang’ (帮) in these three cuisines refer to the merchant groups that controlled various reaches of the Sichuan river system, and the Salt Gangs controlled the area around Zigong, Luzhou, and Yibin - and did develop their own cuisine.</span></p><p>Still, in modern times, the Salt Gang shares some philosophical similarities to the Upper River, so could perhaps be lumped together if you were feeling lumpy.</p><p><span>In the south of Sichuan, however, there’s a lesser known little ‘nub’ that juts down into Yunnan, centered around </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xichang" rel="">Xichang</a><span>. This area is perhaps a little more similar to food in Yunnan than it is Sichuan proper, being heavily influenced by </span><a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Yi-people" rel="">Yi people</a><span> food (and so we called </span><strong>Yi Sichuan</strong><span>). </span></p><figure data-drag-handle="true" data-component-name="ImageGallery"><div><div><picture><source

Consisting of stir-fried boiled fatty pork - the specific cut is a matter of great debate - the foundational flavors of the dish are the a mix of Sichuan chili paste (</span><em>Pixian Doubanjiang)</em><span> and green garlic.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Mapo Tofu (麻婆豆腐). </strong><em>Bottom left. </em><span>Finishing the trifecta of “Sichuan dishes that everyone has an opinion on”, Mapo Tofu has a long and varied history but at its core belongs to the </span><em>mala</em><span> spicy and numbing flavor profile. The dish consists of tofu simmered in a broth of crispy minced beef, Sichuan chili bean paste, chili powder, and finished to taste with Sichuan peppercorn power.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>MSG Noodles (味精素面). </strong><em>Bottom center. </em><span>A street food classic from Leshan city south of Chengdu. This mixed noodle highlights the use of MSG, which was considered a new and novel ingredient at the time of the dish’s invention (the 1940s). Mixed in are also the Sichuan noodle usual suspects of chili oil and </span><em>yacai</em><span> - fermented mustard green.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Zhangcha Smoked Duck (樟茶鸭). </strong><em>Bottom right. </em><span>A classic smoked duck in Sichuan that’s made by marinating, cold smoking with camphor and tea, steaming, and then finally deep frying the duck. There’re some argument around the name ‘Zhangcha’, one side believing that the </span><em>zhang</em><span> refers to the camphor (樟树) that's used for smoking, and the other believing that it refers to using tea from </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhangzhou" rel="">Zhangzhou</a><span> (漳州). Our vote goes for the former.</span></p></li></ul><figure data-drag-handle="true" data-component-name="ImageGallery"><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8d7bbab9-06ae-4d92-9821-8112ad6cd4c6_1440x1080.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_474,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8d7bbab9-06ae-4d92-9821-8112ad6cd4c6_1440x1080.jpeg 474w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_474,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8d7bbab9-06ae-4d92-9821-8112ad6cd4c6_1440x1080.jpeg" sizes="100vw" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8d7bbab9-06ae-4d92-9821-8112ad6cd4c6_1440x1080.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_474,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8d7bbab9-06ae-4d92-9821-8112ad6cd4c6_1440x1080.jpeg 474w" width="474"></picture><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fff743873-3c9a-449e-91b2-4ceb8b94d12e_2568x1382.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_474,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fff743873-3c9a-449e-91b2-4ceb8b94d12e_2568x1382.jpeg 474w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_474,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fff743873-3c9a-449e-91b2-4ceb8b94d12e_2568x1382.jpeg" sizes="100vw" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fff743873-3c9a-449e-91b2-4ceb8b94d12e_2568x1382.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_474,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fff743873-3c9a-449e-91b2-4ceb8b94d12e_2568x1382.jpeg 474w" width="474"></picture><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F834d8278-7977-43e3-9c50-923ade188c0c_1080x1440.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_474,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F834d8278-7977-43e3-9c50-923ade188c0c_1080x1440.jpeg 474w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_474,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F834d8278-7977-43e3-9c50-923ade188c0c_1080x1440.jpeg" sizes="100vw" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F834d8278-7977-43e3-9c50-923ade188c0c_1080x1440.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_474,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F834d8278-7977-43e3-9c50-923ade188c0c_1080x1440.jpeg 474w" width="474"></picture></div></figure><p><em><strong>Representative dishes:</strong></em></p><ul><li><p><strong>Wanzhou Grilled Fish (万州烤鱼). </strong><em>Left. </em><span>A dish that’s spread far and wide from its origins in Wanzhou city, this grilled fish has become a late night BBQ staple in all four corners of the country.

Guizhou, around lunchtime you can find people streaming into their tofu rice joints - enjoying a savory  </span><em>douhua</em><span> ‘tofu pudding’ over rice together with various chili-laced dipping sauces. The Sichuanese South is particularly famed for their love of this tradition, with localized dipping sauce variants such as the Fushun version (laced with </span><a href="https://tropical.theferns.info/viewtropical.php?id=Microtoena+patchoulii" rel="">Chinese patchouli</a><span>) and the Luzhou version (brightens things up with </span><em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litsea_cubeba" rel="">mujiangzi</a></em><span> oil).</span></p></li><li><p><strong>‘Cold eaten’ Beef (冷吃牛肉). </strong><em>Top center. </em><span>Thinly sliced beef that’s deep fried until dry and jerky-like and soaked in chili oil. Popular as a restaurant dish, a snack for the road, and goes phenomenally with the local area’s </span><em>baijiu</em><span> liquor.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Yibin Burning Noodles (宜宾燃面). </strong><em>Top right. </em><span>Originally a humble meal for Yibin dock workers, it consists of chili oil, toasted peanuts and sesame, and Yibin </span><em>yacai</em><span>. The ‘burning’ in the name is a translation of the character </span><em>ran</em><span> (燃), which means ‘to ignite’. There’s various theories on why a mixed noodle would include such a character - the most oft-repeated one is that is was differentiating the noodle as a ‘not-soup-noodle’ dish. That is, that the noodle was not just dry (so, convenient to eat on the docks), but </span><em>so</em><span> dry that you could theoretically toss it over a fire and the thing would ignite. Of course, most modern Burning Noodles prove quite stubbornly difficult to set on fire…</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Shuizhu Beef (水煮牛肉). </strong><em>Bottom left. </em><span>A.k.a. “boiled beef” or “chili poached beef”, this is a dish that these days is seen through Sichuan - together with the country at large. The dish comes from the area’s history of salt production, and the oxen that were used as manual labor in the process. The dish was originally a way to use up this tough meat - salt marinated, coated in a generous quantity of sweet potato starch, all poached in a broth heavily seasoned with chili and Sichuan peppercorn.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Fresh Chili Rabbit (鲜椒兔). </strong><em>Bottom center. </em><span>Rabbit is a popular protein source throughout Sichuan (Chengdu is famed for their snack of spicy rabbit heads). Pictured is a Zigong rabbit dish cooked with fresh chilis, Sichuan pepper, and baby ginger.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Crispy meat soup (酥肉汤). </strong><em>Bottom right. Surou</em><span> - ‘crispy meat’ is deep fried pork by any other name. Preferably made with fatty pork, it deep fries with a seasoned egg/sweet potato starch batter. It’s an ingredient that can be purchased directly from the market in Sichuan, and there’s various ways that they’re incorporated into meals. Those outside of Sichuan are often introduced to the ingredient as a choice on Chongqing hotpot menus, but in South Sichuan home cooks often like to employ it in quick soups. Pictured is one such soup with pea shoots.</span></p></li></ul><figure data-drag-handle="true" data-component-name="ImageGallery"><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F96a7babc-4621-43d2-91d2-813c62d78224_1080x1339.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_474,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F96a7babc-4621-43d2-91d2-813c62d78224_1080x1339.jpeg 474w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_474,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F96a7babc-4621-43d2-91d2-813c62d78224_1080x1339.jpeg" sizes="100vw" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F96a7babc-4621-43d2-91d2-813c62d78224_1080x1339.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_474,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F96a7babc-4621-43d2-91d2-813c62d78224_1080x1339.jpeg 474w" width="474"></picture><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F48c11395-04a1-482e-aee0-0f712898105b_1076x1384.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_474,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F48c11395-04a1-482e-aee0-0f712898105b_1076x1384.png 474w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_474,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F48c11395-04a1-482e-aee0-0f712898105b_1076x1384.png" sizes="100vw" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F48c11395-04a1-482e-aee0-0f712898105b_1076x1384.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_474,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F48c11395-04a1-482e-aee0-0f712898105b_1076x1384.png 474w" width="474"></picture><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F59c3c13e-026e-4284-90e7-4449bfc941d1_1080x1080.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_474,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F59c3c13e-026e-4284-90e7-4449bfc941d1_1080x1080.jpeg 474w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_474,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F59c3c13e-026e-4284-90e7-4449bfc941d1_1080x1080.jpeg" sizes="100vw" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F59c3c13e-026e-4284-90e7-4449bfc941d1_1080x1080.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_474,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F59c3c13e-026e-4284-90e7-4449bfc941d1_1080x1080.jpeg 474w" width="474"></picture></div></figure><p><em><strong>Representative dishes:</strong></em></p><ul><li><p><strong>Tuotuorou (坨坨肉). </strong><em>Left. </em><span>Traditionally a festival dish for the Yi people, the name literally means ‘chunky meat’.

The former is subtle, and (assuming that it’s not just in my head) likely came by the way of Taiwan - after all, Taiwanese immigrants in the 70s and 80s were instrumental in crystallizing what we know of today as ‘American Chinese takeout’.</span></p><p><span>The latter, however, is no puzzle: merchants and settlers from South Fujian - </span><strong>Minnan</strong><span>, or Hokkien - were one of the three major pillars of maritime Chinese in South East Asia (along with the Cantonese and the Teochew, discussed above).</span></p><p><span>Once upon a time, the city of </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quanzhou" rel="">Quanzhou</a><span> was the nexus of maritime trade in Asia, visited and written about both by Marco Polo and Ibn Battuta. Food wise, I’m personally probably guilty of being overly drawn to the faint echo of those pathways, but most Minnan people would likely point you more to their famed oyster omelettes instead.</span></p><p><strong>Minbei</strong><span>, the north section of Fujian around the capital city of Fuzhou, is quite distinct from the south. Sweet and sours feature prominently, ditto with the red dregs from  fermented rice wine, called </span><em>hongzao.</em><span> </span></p><p><span>The food from the </span><strong>West Fujian Mountains</strong><span> became quite popular in Fuzhou in the 80s and 90s, and expanded throughout China in the form of the chain “Shaxian snacks” - </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaxian,_Sanming" rel="">Shaxian</a><span> referring to a small mountain town particularly famed for their food.  If you’ve eaten around China, it’s quite likely that you’ve stumbled into one at some point. The chain is a reasonable representation of western Fujian food, but quality-wise (obviously) pales in comparison to what you can find in the region itself.</span></p><figure data-drag-handle="true"

essence, is cooked pilaf-style. Rice is fried in a base of lard, pork, dried shrimp, dried shiitake and shallot, then water is added and the entirety of the pot is steamed.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Shacha Noodles (沙茶面). </strong><em>Top center. </em><span>Shacha sauce - a mix of peanut, fish sauce, shallot, chili, sesame, spices, and oil - is thought to have derived from Southeast Asian Satay sauce (though given Satay’s Hokkien linguistic roots, directionality’s hard to determine). The sauce can be used as a flavor base for stir fries, braises, and hotpots - pictured is a noodle soup common in Minnan served with beef and tofu puff.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Curry Beef (咖喱牛排). </strong><em>Top right. </em><span>An old school dish from Quanzhou, these braised beef ribs are another example of a shacha-based dish, albeit one with (interestingly) curry powder also added to the mix. Thought to have originally been a Hokkien Muslim dish.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Mianxianhu (面线糊). </strong><em>Bottom left. </em><span>Mianxianhu is made by cooking a gossamer-thin noodle in a soup together with seafood and pork, which ends up to dissolving into an almost congee-like consistency. Classically eaten as a breakfast or a midnight snack, it’s commonly paired next to some </span><em>youtiao</em><span> deep fried crullers.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Minnan Oyster Pancake (海蛎煎). </strong><em>Bottom center. </em><span>A much beloved snack in the area, the traditional Minnan version is a bit more of an acquired taste than the Teochew variant next door. The pancake tends to be egg-less and leans heavily instead on sweet potato starch to arrive at a chewy, gloopy consistency. Often served next to Minnan’s local sweet chili sauce (甜辣椒酱).</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Thick Beef Soup (牛肉羹). </strong><em>Bottom right. </em><span>Thick starch-thickened soups, </span><em>geng</em><span>, are quite popular throughout the region, with beef </span><em>geng</em><span> likely being the most classic. A very old school dish, beef slices are coated with a generous quantity of sweet potato starch and poached in beef stock - a process that gently cooks the beef, while thickening the soup in the process. </span></p></li></ul><figure data-drag-handle="true" data-component-name="ImageGallery"><div><div><picture><source type="image/webp"

‘lychee pork’ was an elegant banquet dish, whereby pounded pork was wrapped around water chestnut, deep fried, and the whole package was mixed with a </span><em>hongzao</em><span>-based sweet and sour — arriving at a ‘lychee-like’ end result. These days, the name refers more generally any Minbei-style sweet and sour pork (which often, brilliantly, include deep fried potato in their mix).</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Guobianhu (锅边糊). </strong><em>Top center. </em><span>A classic breakfast in Fuzhou, </span><em>guobianhu</em><span> cooks rice batter on the side of a hot wok, with stock bubbling in the center. After the rice batter forms, it’s then scraped into the soup and all cooked together. Particularly excellent next to some Fuzhou deep fried rice cake (三角糕), as pictured.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Fuzhou Fishballs (福州鱼丸). </strong><em>Top right. </em><span>Fuzhou fishballs are… a meatball stuffed in a meatball - the inside layer is seasoned pork paste; the outside, fish. Generally served in soup.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Nanjiangan (南煎肝). </strong><em>Bottom left. </em><span>I’m personally someone not overly fond of the taste of liver, but this liver dish quickly slotted in as my favorite of any, anywhere. </span><em>Nanjiangan</em><span> consists of thinly sliced pork liver, flash fried in lard and then stir fried - this one with bell pepper, carrot, and onion.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>‘Zao’ Fried Pork (炸红糟肉). </strong><em>Bottom center. ‘</em><span>Zao’ pork consists of pork tenderloin marinated with </span><em>hongzao</em><span>, </span><a href="https://www.tasteatlas.com/hong-zao" rel="">the neon-red glutinous rice wine lees</a><span> common to the region. It’s then deep fried with an aggressive coating of sweet potato flour, and served dry.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Deep Fried Spring Rolls (炸春卷). </strong><em>Bottom right. </em><span>Many places in China have spring pancake. Many places in China also deep fry said spring rolls. But I can’t help but feel that the specific combination of fillings found in Fuzhou — cabbage, carrot, and pork, which I sometimes jokingly refer to as ‘the Hakka Trinity’ — is incredibly evocative of the spring rolls and egg rolls served up in American-Chinese takeout restaurants. Maybe it’s in my head.</span></p></li></ul><figure data-drag-handle="true" data-component-name="ImageGallery"><div><div><picture><source type="image/webp"

ways to Cantonese style wontons, Shaxian wontons are a bit smaller, stuffed with solely pork (and not seafood), and opt for a non-alkaline skin. Often served in soup - as pictured - or mixed in with a peanut paste-based sauce.</span><em> </em></p></li><li><p><strong>Peanut Sauce Noodles (飘香拌面). </strong><em>Top center. </em><span>A classic on the Shaxian snacks menu, these peanut sauce noodles are an addictive mix of scallion lard, peanut paste, and a seasoned soy sauce.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Midongpi (米冻皮). </strong><em>Top right. Midongpi</em><span> are more or less akin to an un-stuffed Cantonese cheongfun, but served in a very special local sauce called </span><em>douchiyou </em><span>(豆豉油). </span><em>Douchiyou </em><span>itself consists of douchi, Chinese fermented black beans, simmered in water for hours until completely dissolved. Optionally topped with an aggressively spicy Habanero-like local cultivar of chili.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Shaxian Shaomai (沙县烧麦). </strong><em>Bottom left. </em><span>A highlight of Shaxian (in my personal opinion), these Shaomai consist of chopped rice noodles and meat stuffed inside of a very thin dumpling skin, and steamed.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Banya (板鸭). </strong><em>Bottom center. Banya</em><span> duck legs are first lightly smoked, then roasted. They can be purchased at the market and eaten directly, or brought home and steamed to re-heat. </span></p></li><li><p><strong>Xiguo (喜粿). </strong><em>Bottom right. </em><span>To make </span><em>xiguo,</em><span> a mix of rice and red rice is ground down to a batter, then steamed to form the ‘dough’. This concoction is then stuffed with pork, dried shrimp, Chinese chives, and pickles, and served in a thin </span><em>douchiyou </em><span>sauce. </span></p></li></ul><figure data-drag-handle="true" data-component-name="ImageGallery"><div><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb3ff6be2-bb57-4067-ac83-c56c732934bf_2560x2038.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_720,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb3ff6be2-bb57-4067-ac83-c56c732934bf_2560x2038.png 720w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_720,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb3ff6be2-bb57-4067-ac83-c56c732934bf_2560x2038.png" sizes="100vw" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb3ff6be2-bb57-4067-ac83-c56c732934bf_2560x2038.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_720,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb3ff6be2-bb57-4067-ac83-c56c732934bf_2560x2038.png 720w" width="720"></picture><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8c7b9bb0-879f-45e0-978d-8716e129989b_1920x1080.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_720,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8c7b9bb0-879f-45e0-978d-8716e129989b_1920x1080.jpeg 720w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_720,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8c7b9bb0-879f-45e0-978d-8716e129989b_1920x1080.jpeg" sizes="100vw" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8c7b9bb0-879f-45e0-978d-8716e129989b_1920x1080.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_720,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8c7b9bb0-879f-45e0-978d-8716e129989b_1920x1080.jpeg 720w" width="720"></picture></div><figcaption>Left, Location of Zhejiang in China; Right, Breakdown of Cuisines in Zhejiang</figcaption></div></figure><p><span>Zhejiang, together with neighboring Jiangsu, has some of the richest written culinary history of anywhere in China</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-2-151441573" href="https://chinesecookingdemystified.substack.com/p/63-chinese-cuisines-the-complete#footnote-2-151441573" target="_self" rel="">2</a></span><span>. And as such, the food world there really does like to delineate a lot of sub-cuisines. </span></p><p><span>Some of the differences admittedly might look somewhat subtle to an outsider, but the regionality runs deep. The </span><strong>Hangzhou </strong><span>school, hailing from the largest city in Zhejiang and historically the most dominant, is the cuisine that’s generally synonymous with “Zhejiang food” when recalled in The Big Eight. It’s got a rich banquet tradition, a tradition sometimes derided by its (generally Northern Chinese) critics as ‘too sweet’.</span></p><p><span>The neighboring </span><strong>Shaoxing </strong><span>is, of course, the source of the famed rice wine that bears its name. Shaoxing wine itself is a dry to semi-dry rice wine that’s long been the source for chefs to balance and remove subtle ‘off odors’ from ingredients… and so maybe it’s no surprise that the go-to drinking food it’s paired with often feature funky, fermented ingredients. It’s might not the best Chinese cuisine for people with sensitive palettes, but if you’re like me and the type that loves indulging in funky cheeses and the like… Shaoxing food can hit a similar spot.</span></p><p><span>The Zhejiang coast is generally split into two major cuisines - </span><strong>Ningbo</strong><span> and </span><strong>Ou</strong><span>. The latter is a grouping of three cities - Wenzhou, Lishui, and Taizhou - that’s particular renowned for its seafood. Ningbo, the largest city on the coast, has a number of local specialties, but an argument could perhaps be made that it might able to be lumped in with Ou cuisine as well.</span></p><p><span>The mountains in the south and west of the province are beginning to get quite distinct. Quzhou shares a good bit of crossover with neighboring Shangrao over in the Jiangxi mountains, but the </span><strong>She People</strong><span> autonomous region is generally considered its own pocket. The </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/She_people#History" rel="">She People themselves</a><span> have an interesting history in their own right, and scattered communities exist throughout south China (the largest concentrations being in around </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jingning_She_Autonomous_County" rel="">Jingning</a><span> and outside of </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ningde" rel="">Ningde</a><span> in neighboring Fujian).</span></p><p><strong>Jinhua</strong><span> is a difficult city to categorize, and could maybe be thought of as a ‘shatter zone’ between Hangzhou, Ou, and the Jiangxi mountains.</span></p><figure data-drag-handle="true" data-component-name="ImageGallery"><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcb4aa559-bfe6-44f4-9489-ba689020ca2a_1280x960.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_474,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcb4aa559-bfe6-44f4-9489-ba689020ca2a_1280x960.jpeg 474w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_474,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcb4aa559-bfe6-44f4-9489-ba689020ca2a_1280x960.jpeg" sizes="100vw" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcb4aa559-bfe6-44f4-9489-ba689020ca2a_1280x960.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_474,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcb4aa559-bfe6-44f4-9489-ba689020ca2a_1280x960.jpeg 474w" width="474"></picture><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F259fe28d-da7f-4f82-b606-6584340af3ea_960x540.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_474,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F259fe28d-da7f-4f82-b606-6584340af3ea_960x540.jpeg 474w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_474,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F259fe28d-da7f-4f82-b606-6584340af3ea_960x540.jpeg" sizes="100vw" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F259fe28d-da7f-4f82-b606-6584340af3ea_960x540.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_474,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F259fe28d-da7f-4f82-b606-6584340af3ea_960x540.jpeg 474w" width="474"></picture><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd00273cf-d52d-4583-8d55-a6d5811d2dbf_1440x1080.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_474,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd00273cf-d52d-4583-8d55-a6d5811d2dbf_1440x1080.jpeg 474w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_474,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd00273cf-d52d-4583-8d55-a6d5811d2dbf_1440x1080.jpeg" sizes="100vw" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd00273cf-d52d-4583-8d55-a6d5811d2dbf_1440x1080.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_474,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd00273cf-d52d-4583-8d55-a6d5811d2dbf_1440x1080.jpeg 474w" width="474"></picture></div></figure><p><em><strong>Representative dishes:</strong></em></p><ul><li><p><strong>Candied Ham (蜜汁火方). </strong><em>Left.</em><span> An old banquet dish that’s extremely traditional to the Hangzhou school.

Traditionally speaking, it’s a delicate cuisine that forged a number of lavish dishes that ended up influencing banquet cuisines across the country.</span></p><p><span>And yet, something a little awkward about that swath is that </span><em>that</em><span> was the food of the elite, and developing alongside of it was humble - and at times heavily seasoned - fare which is now referred to as </span><em>Tucai</em><span>. Both are enjoyed in the region today, and are generally split down on a restaurant-by-restaurant basis.</span></p><p><strong>Nanjing</strong><span>, </span><strong>Suzhou-Wuxi</strong><span>, and </span><strong>Shanghai</strong><span> cuisines all bear some influence from said tradition. Nanjing is perhaps most distinct of the three - as the historical capital of the country for a hot second, it developed its own traditional school (though these days is perhaps most synonymous with a love of duck and crawfish). </span></p><p><span>Shanghai, meanwhile, bears a lot of resemblance to Suzhou and Wuxi next door, but the city undeniably also bears an imprint of western influence. As the most influential late Qing and Nationalist era treaty port, Shanghai developed its own traditional school of western cuisine called </span><em>Haipai Western - </em><span>influence most obviously seen today in the tradition of bakeries in that city. Post reform and opening, the tradition was perhaps reinforced by the city’s global and international bent. </span></p><figure data-drag-handle="true"

Commonly topped with shredded chicken, shrimp, and ham strips. </span></p></li><li><p><strong>Choudayuan (臭大圆). </strong><em>Bottom left. </em><span>An example of the more humble </span><em>tucai</em><span> - a braise of stinky tofu and intestine that’s somewhat spicy and designed to be devoured alongside white rice.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Braised Old Goose (红烧老鹅). </strong><em>Bottom center. </em><span>Another good example of </span><em>tucai</em><span>. Goose is a common poultry in Jiangsu, and this dish selects old goose - which will be tougher, leaner, and more intensely flavored - and braises it for over an hour. </span></p></li><li><p><strong>Xuecai Pork (雪菜肉丝). </strong><em>Bottom right. </em><span>What </span><em>Yacai </em><span>is to Sichuan, </span><em>Xuecai</em><span> is to Zhejiang and (especially) Jiangsu. An extremely common pickle, this mustard green is commonly stir fried together with pork. An incredibly common homecooking dish, this stir fry can be eaten straight alongside rice, or it can also form the basis of a noodle soup.</span></p></li></ul><figure data-drag-handle="true"

Pictured is the duck served drenched in the drippings from roasting.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Salt poached duck (盐水鸭). </strong><em>Top center. </em><span>Ubiquitous in Nanjing restaurants and home kitchens, salt poached duck is an old technique that first dry brines for at least two days, then poaches in water. </span></p></li><li><p><strong>Duck blood noodles (鸭血粉丝汤). </strong><em>Top right. </em><span>An incredibly iconic Nanjing dish that you can find in the dedicated duck-blood-noodle joints that dot the city. A snack or a quick meal, the soup consists of glass noodles served amongst coagulated duck blood and duck organ, all in a duck-stock-based soup.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Stuffed duck (八宝鸭). </strong><em>Bottom left. </em><span>A fancy banquet dish that’s made from a fully deboned duck, and stuffed with sticky rice, lotus seed, Jinhua ham, and dried shiitake. It’s then poached, deep fried, steamed with sauce, and cut open at the table.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Nanjing Crawfish (小龙虾). </strong><em>Bottom center. </em><span>Nanjing sits in an area renowned for crawfish production. As such, in the city you can find various crawfish joints, which are particularly popular in the summer. The crawfish are cooked by first deep frying, then stir frying in a flavorful sauce — pictured is a (mostly devoured) garlic sauce flavor, together with a spicy ‘13-spice’ flavor.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Candied Osmanthus Flower and Taro (桂花糖芋苗). </strong><em>Bottom right. </em><span>A classic Nanjing dessert that leans on candied osmanthus flower, an ingredient also well used in Yangzhou style Dim Sum. This dish consists of</span><em> </em><span>taro cut into balls and cooked in </span><em>slightly</em><span> alkaline water, then made into a sweet soup with sugar and candied osmanthus flower. </span></p></li></ul><p><em><strong>Representative dishes:</strong></em></p><figure data-drag-handle="true" data-component-name="ImageGallery"><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F91f25fda-77ec-43aa-a3c8-1ef30c0f3b53_1080x1439.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_474,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F91f25fda-77ec-43aa-a3c8-1ef30c0f3b53_1080x1439.jpeg 474w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_474,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F91f25fda-77ec-43aa-a3c8-1ef30c0f3b53_1080x1439.jpeg" sizes="100vw" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F91f25fda-77ec-43aa-a3c8-1ef30c0f3b53_1080x1439.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_474,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F91f25fda-77ec-43aa-a3c8-1ef30c0f3b53_1080x1439.jpeg 474w" width="474"></picture><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fef61a43d-a494-46c4-a787-89a1e06154f1_1080x1439.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_474,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fef61a43d-a494-46c4-a787-89a1e06154f1_1080x1439.jpeg 474w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_474,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fef61a43d-a494-46c4-a787-89a1e06154f1_1080x1439.jpeg" sizes="100vw" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fef61a43d-a494-46c4-a787-89a1e06154f1_1080x1439.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_474,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fef61a43d-a494-46c4-a787-89a1e06154f1_1080x1439.jpeg 474w" width="474"></picture><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F665300f5-c047-452c-a6db-3855a44ae5b6_1080x1440.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_474,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F665300f5-c047-452c-a6db-3855a44ae5b6_1080x1440.jpeg 474w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_474,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F665300f5-c047-452c-a6db-3855a44ae5b6_1080x1440.jpeg" sizes="100vw" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F665300f5-c047-452c-a6db-3855a44ae5b6_1080x1440.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_474,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F665300f5-c047-452c-a6db-3855a44ae5b6_1080x1440.jpeg 474w" width="474"></picture></div></figure><ul><li><p><strong>‘Big Meat’ Noodles (大肉面). </strong><em>Left. </em><span>The ‘big meat’ in the name referring to pork, this noodle soup consists of a big slab of braised pork belly in an eel stock, seasoned with actively fermenting </span><em>jiuniang</em><span> rice. </span></p></li><li><p><strong>Cherry Pork (樱桃肉). </strong><em>Center. </em><span>An old, sweet and savory banquet dish, Cherry Pork is a large hunk of pork belly braised in </span><em>hongzao </em><span>rice wine less, rock sugar and Shaoxing wine.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Wuxi Hot and Sour (酸辣汤). </strong><em>Right.</em><span> Perhaps the origin of Chinese hot and sour soup, the Wuxi style leans on beef stock together with the area’s famed Zhenjiang (“Chinkiang”) vinegar.

Similar to the Henan classic, the viscous soup contains wheat gluten and thickens with the wheat starch (the by-product of gluten production).

a popular item throughout Jiangsu and Zhejiang, they’re famously beloved here —</span><em> </em><span>what the New York Slice is to the Five Boroughs, Pan Fried Bao is to Shanghai. </span><em> </em><span>There’s different styles to be found - some contain soup, some don’t - but the critical constant is the shatteringly crispy fried bottom. </span></p></li><li><p><strong>Fantuan (粢饭团). </strong><em>Top center. </em><span>Pictured is a ball of sticky rice filled with, well, stuff. Sweet and savory, the Shanghai sort always contains deep fried </span><em>youtiao</em><span> crullers, but you can find various </span><em>fantuan</em><span> breakfast rice balls up and down the eastern coast (and even into Taiwan).</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Hot Meat Noodles (辣肉面). </strong><em>Top right. </em><span>A noodle topping unique to Shanghai, ‘hot meat’ first shallow fries lean pork, then adds some sort of chili sauce to the oil — chili garlic sauce, Sichuan Pixian chili bean paste, a local chili sauce called </span><em>jianghujiang</em><span> (辣糊酱), dealers choice — before seasoning with a generous quantity of granulated sugar. </span></p></li><li><p><strong>Shanghai-style Bakeries (面包房). </strong><em>Bottom left. </em><span>Perhaps the most obvious culinary imprint of Shanghai’s colonial past, these bakeries were classically offshoots to the old ‘Haipai’ western restaurants below. A Shanghai cultural institution that serves up old school Western baked goods such as cornets, palmier, and buttercream cake.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Haipai Western (海派西餐). </strong><em>Bottom center. </em><span>Back in the Treaty Port days, Haipai Western restaurants were fancy black-tie affairs that fed the city’s upper crust - both colonial, and local. Being less democratized than Hong Kong’s westernized </span><em>Cha Chaan Teng</em><span> tradition, when compared to their sister to the south it was less influential to the city’s cuisine writ large. Nevertheless, often staffed by Russian chefs, these restaurants were the progenitors of the Borscht-adjacent ‘Russian Soup’, together with bringing schnitzel into the Shanghai cultural consciousness. </span></p></li><li><p><strong>Schnitzel with Rice Cakes (排骨年糕).</strong><span> </span><em>Bottom right. </em><span>A homecooking classic in Shanghai, derived from the Haipai western tradition above. This variant serves deep fries schnitzel on top of rice cakes cooked in soy sauce, five spice, and (optionally) Worcestershire sauce. </span></p></li></ul><figure data-drag-handle="true" data-component-name="ImageGallery"><div><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F809782ca-8b76-4e1e-b45f-ddfd6b2f7b6a_2560x2038.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_720,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F809782ca-8b76-4e1e-b45f-ddfd6b2f7b6a_2560x2038.png 720w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_720,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F809782ca-8b76-4e1e-b45f-ddfd6b2f7b6a_2560x2038.png" sizes="100vw" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F809782ca-8b76-4e1e-b45f-ddfd6b2f7b6a_2560x2038.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_720,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F809782ca-8b76-4e1e-b45f-ddfd6b2f7b6a_2560x2038.png 720w" width="720"></picture><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F61fb2684-a9a5-49ea-92d0-01cc1e0ce0b3_1920x1080.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_720,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F61fb2684-a9a5-49ea-92d0-01cc1e0ce0b3_1920x1080.jpeg 720w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_720,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F61fb2684-a9a5-49ea-92d0-01cc1e0ce0b3_1920x1080.jpeg" sizes="100vw" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F61fb2684-a9a5-49ea-92d0-01cc1e0ce0b3_1920x1080.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_720,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F61fb2684-a9a5-49ea-92d0-01cc1e0ce0b3_1920x1080.jpeg 720w" width="720"></picture></div><figcaption>Left, Location of Anhui in China; Right, Breakdown of Cuisines in Anhui</figcaption></div></figure><p><span>Of The Big Eight, Anhui cuisine is likely the least well known outside of China. And perhaps that’s for a reason - few international travelers to the famed </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huangshan" rel="">Huangshan mountain</a><span> would list the local cuisine as the highlight of their trip. When I first went to the area as a teenager, I sure didn’t.</span></p><p><span>First, the province is most famed for its tofu - an ingredient that, even today, is still somewhat controversial in the west outside of food lovers and vegetarians. But perhaps more damningly, it’s renowned for it’s </span><em>fermented</em><span> tofu - tofus of the hairy and stinky variety.</span></p><p><span>To really appreciate Anhui cuisine, I think, you must first make peace with the funk. While in the 21st century westerners have increasingly made peace with the flavors of sour and spicy, ‘funk’ appears to be the final frontier for many. If you’re the type that can’t fathom why anyone could </span><em>possibly</em><span> enjoy stinky tofu, my best advice is to start within your own cuisine: </span></p><p><span>Wherever you live, find a cheese room. Get a variety of funky cheeses made from raw milk, and start there. Frankly speaking, many fermented products - whether they be wine, beer, strong cheeses, stinky tofus - aren’t often love at first taste. The reason why they’re beloved is that the flavor is </span><em>interesting</em><span>. It’s layered, it’s complex. Say what you will about a Belgian Sour or a Roquefort or a Stinky Tofu — you cannot say that they’re </span><em>boring</em><strong>.</strong></p><p>If you find yourself in Anhui and you’re not quite there yet?

This area was the cradle of Chinese civilization — it was the birth place of Lao Tzu, the power base of Cao Cao. It was where Pyromancers carved the very first Chinese characters into oxbone.</span></p><p><span>So in a lot of ways, it’s surprising that Henan cuisine doesn’t seem to have too powerful of a reach. And they’ve got some tasty dishes there, too — the hot pepper soup is particularly fantastic. If I had to pontificate a reason, I’d guess that it’s something core to the very name </span><em>Zhongyuan</em><span> - i.e., the plains.</span></p><p><span>If there’s one rule of thumb that this whole exercise of classifying Chinese cuisines has cemented in my head, it’s this - </span><em>the flatlands connect, the mountains divide</em><span>. Chinese food culture follows migration patterns and it follows trade networks. Both crash up against mountainous regions like water against a rocky coast, leaving little pools and pockets that end up developing differently than the lowlands from whence they came.</span></p><p>But the plains connect, and the central plain is a big plain. And so, sometimes when we gaze northward from the perspective of mountainous south, there can sometimes be a sort of… mish-mash effect. Henan, Shandong, Hebei, and Shanxi can can all sort of blend together as “Northern food”.</p><p><span>As people that penned a map differentiating Hakka from Dong River Hakka, that lumping certainly isn’t fair. There’s obviously regionality here. There’s even regionality </span><em>within Henan</em><span> - certain Henan chefs are quick to delineate a ‘Luoyang school’ and a ‘Kaifeng school’ of Henan food. The differences for us at this point are sort of difficult to parse (we have a lot of traveling in the North in front of us still), so we did the lazy default, and drew our lines at the province border.</span></p><figure data-drag-handle="true" data-component-name="ImageGallery"><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcd082785-add6-4cb2-91e9-1bee75ba0d8e_1080x1440.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_474,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcd082785-add6-4cb2-91e9-1bee75ba0d8e_1080x1440.jpeg 474w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_474,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcd082785-add6-4cb2-91e9-1bee75ba0d8e_1080x1440.jpeg" sizes="100vw" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcd082785-add6-4cb2-91e9-1bee75ba0d8e_1080x1440.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_474,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcd082785-add6-4cb2-91e9-1bee75ba0d8e_1080x1440.jpeg 474w" width="474"></picture><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2111238e-9ccc-4238-9593-f51c66e26d42_1080x1440.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_474,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2111238e-9ccc-4238-9593-f51c66e26d42_1080x1440.jpeg 474w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_474,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2111238e-9ccc-4238-9593-f51c66e26d42_1080x1440.jpeg" sizes="100vw" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2111238e-9ccc-4238-9593-f51c66e26d42_1080x1440.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_474,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2111238e-9ccc-4238-9593-f51c66e26d42_1080x1440.jpeg 474w" width="474"></picture><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7c3737bc-b779-4705-af72-679a0edb96bf_1080x1440.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_474,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7c3737bc-b779-4705-af72-679a0edb96bf_1080x1440.jpeg 474w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_474,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7c3737bc-b779-4705-af72-679a0edb96bf_1080x1440.jpeg" sizes="100vw" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7c3737bc-b779-4705-af72-679a0edb96bf_1080x1440.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_474,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7c3737bc-b779-4705-af72-679a0edb96bf_1080x1440.jpeg 474w" width="474"></picture></div></figure><p><em><strong>Representative dishes:</strong></em></p><ul><li><p><strong>Huimian (烩面). </strong><em>Left. </em><span>Seen both at noodle shops and in home kitchens, these are quickly braised noodles cooked in stock, then topped with whatever meat said stock is made out of.

Geographically, it’s the divide between the Yellow river and Yangtze river systems. Culturally, it’s often thought of as the divide between North China and South China. And culinarily, people sometimes think of it as a marker of China’s wheat-rice divide.</span></p><p>At times, I feel people overstate the case of the wheat-rice divide in China. After all, southerners started eating noodles well before the 20th century. Northerners certainly also eat rice. Like, think about your own country - today, would you call it ‘wheat eating’ or ‘rice eating’? Being someone from America, I feel like the only proper answer there is “…yes?”</p><p><span>But still, these traditional staples do matter, because I think they illuminate the spread of the </span><em>technology</em><span> of dough making, and the boundaries of that spread. And I do say the word ‘technology’ there quite deliberately. As explained by /u/Iphikrates in </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/sd0f30/in_pc_games_like_civilization_technology_is/" rel="">their excellent discussion on why Gaming ‘Tech Trees’ are ahistorical</a><span>:</span></p><blockquote><p><em>To put it simply, technology is practice. It does not emerge or exist outside of its practical application within a society, economy, or culture. It is not pursued or preserved for its own sake. It has no intrinsic value. A given technology either has a use (in which case it may be developed and passed on) or it doesn't.</em></p><p><em>Writing is a good example. The Mycenaean Greeks of the Late Bronze Age had a syllabic writing system (Linear B), which we can read. They seem to have used it primarily to keep administrative records: palace inventories, letters between governing officials, and so on. But when the palaces burned and the administrative structures that ruled from them disappeared, writing went with them.</em></p></blockquote><p>In Guangdong as it is in much of the West, noodle and dough making is something confined to the specialist. But in Shanxi, it’s part of the very definition of what a good homecook is.</p><p>A number of years back now, me and a few friends and coworkers in Shenzhen were having a small Chinese New Year get-together - a smattering of people that weren’t going back to celebrate in their hometown for one reason or another. Mostly an excuse to drink beer, we also grabbed a couple packs of dumpling skins from the supermarket and half-heartedly did the whole dumpling-wrapping-and-cooking tradition for a bit of fun. We had a new coworker from the North — Shanxi, specifically — who wanted to invite her mother as well.

We could probably, if needed, halve the list again — most, if not all, Chinese banquet traditions are derived from two cuisines: </span><em>Huaiyang</em><span>, which we discussed in the Jiangsu section, and </span><strong>Lu</strong><span> - classical Shandong cuisine.</span></p><p><span>You could perhaps think of the difference between these two Haute cuisines as akin to the difference between French and Italian. Whatever stuffy heights the cuisine ends up reaching… Huaiyang, like Italian, is ultimately a system that’s </span><em>bottom-up. </em><span>The fine dining system has a connection to the land and the people — the food leans on whatever produce is local and high quality, the dishes are inspired by the food the common people actually eat.</span></p><p><span>Lu, by contrast, has a </span><em>top-down</em><span> energy that would make Escoffier proud. </span></p><p><span>The food world nowadays tends to celebrate the former: the fine dining world is quick to advertise its bottom-up chops. There’s something that feels real and natural about the Huaiyang and Italian approach - an ethos that, for example, was very much copy-pasted by Alice Waters to create what we now know of as </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice_Waters" rel="">California Cuisine</a><span>. </span></p><p><span>Bottom-up has become </span><em>so</em><span> celebrated in modern times, that perhaps top-down is becoming somewhat underrated.</span></p><p><span>After all, Lu cuisine was the first cuisine to really systematize stocks and sauces in China. It standardized kitchen organization; it created what we think of as the wok station. It crafted naming conventions, changing the very language of how people talk and think about food. If the Henan province is the cradle of Chinese civilization, Shandong is the cradle of Chinese </span><em>culinary</em><span> civilization.</span></p><p><span>It’s difficult to recreate the flavors of the Italian coast without the Italian coast. French and Lu, by contrast, are </span><em>portable</em><span> ideas. There’s a reason why the Russian Czars opted for French chefs, and the Forbidden City leaned on Shandong.</span></p><p><span>But of course, that was the food of the elite. Shandong itself has a ton of fascinating pockets that we really need to get to. Boshan is an intriguing pocket and reportedly the origin of </span><a href="https://youtu.be/1KJN_q6q0co?si=hyhgnPh4O0vNpotJ" rel="">my all time favorite eggplant dish</a><span>. Zaozhuang has their own version of Spicy Chicken (辣子鸡), and the whole province has this ineffable Sichuan connection that sort of hurts my brain. Sometimes random shit from Shandong suddenly bursts onto the scene in China, seemingly without warning: Dezhou chicken became a Beijing-Shanghai train ride tradition, and these days Zibo barbecue is starting to become increasingly popular (it’s basically standard Chinese BBQ, albeit eaten alongside Spring Pancakes ala Peking Duck). And of course, the whole area around the coast, </span><strong>Jiaodong</strong><span>, is totally different.</span></p><figure data-drag-handle="true"

banquet dish practically synonymous with Lu cuisine. ‘Nine twist’ refers to a cooking technique that’s   delicate and complicated (not that the intestine is twisted nine times, as is commonly misunderstood). A shockingly complex dish that we will never, ever cook on our channel… the dish features seven cooking stages: washing (洗), blanching (汆), simmering until soft (煮), frying (煸), braising in sauce (煸), braising over a very low flame (煨), and thickening (㸆). Completing our tour of the aesthetically pleasing odd numbers, it’s also supposed to hit all of the ‘five tastes’ (sour, sweet, bitter, spicy, and savory).</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Sweet and Sour Carp (糖醋鲤鱼).&nbsp;</strong><em>Top center. </em><span>Another classical Lu dish often seen at banquets, and… another absurdly technique-heavy dish. Famously requiring some impressively exquisite knife skills to shape the damn thing, once the fish is cut it’s then battered and deep fried. The fish must be continuously shaped while frying in order for it to be able to ‘stand’ — finally finishing with a sweet and sour sauce to plate. </span></p></li><li><p><strong>Pucai in Milky Stock (奶汤蒲菜).&nbsp;</strong><em>Top right.</em><span> A banquet dish of </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typha_orientalis" rel="">bulrush</a><span>, it first blanches before cooking with ham, shiitake, and dried shrimp in a milky stock. Thickened, interestingly, with what could be called a roux by any other name — vegetable oil mixed with wheat flour. </span></p></li><li><p><strong>Chinese Leek Jianbing (大葱煎饼).&nbsp;</strong><em>Bottom left. </em><span>Originating in </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linyi" rel="">Yimeng mountain area</a><span>, this </span><em>Jianbing</em><span> (“Chinese Crepe”) variant is made from a mix of grains - corn, sorghum, millet, and wheat. While you can use these Jianbing to roll up pretty much anything, most classic is to fill it up with brushing soybean paste and a hunk of Chinese Leek. </span></p></li><li><p><strong>Cantonese Meat (广东肉).&nbsp;</strong><em>Bottom center. </em><span>Apocryphally, this oddly named dish was borne when a Qing dynasty merchant tried tried a western-style pork chop during his travels in Guangdong. Returning to Shandong, he instructed his personal chef to replicate the dish. And while perhaps something was lost in this cross-cultural game of culinary telephone, this soy sauce and five spice-forward fried pork chop can be found throughout Shandong today.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Dezhou Tender Chicken (德州扒鸡).&nbsp;</strong><em>Bottom right. </em><span>Braised chicken is a traditional dish from </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dezhou" rel="">Dezhou</a><span>, and is also known as "Dezhou Five-fragrant Boneless Braised Chicken" — developed by the </span><em>Deshunzhai</em><span> (德顺斋) Restaurant in Dezhou. Deep fried and braised until tender, famously sold at train stations to travelers on the Beijing-Shanghai route.</span></p></li></ul><figure data-drag-handle="true" data-component-name="ImageGallery"><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F11cd5cd0-7ed7-4b8f-be18-52f6589dc494_1080x1440.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_474,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F11cd5cd0-7ed7-4b8f-be18-52f6589dc494_1080x1440.jpeg 474w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_474,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F11cd5cd0-7ed7-4b8f-be18-52f6589dc494_1080x1440.jpeg" sizes="100vw" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F11cd5cd0-7ed7-4b8f-be18-52f6589dc494_1080x1440.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_474,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F11cd5cd0-7ed7-4b8f-be18-52f6589dc494_1080x1440.jpeg 474w" width="474"></picture><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faf5e3415-5e09-4e9e-9684-876673500590_1080x1416.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_474,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faf5e3415-5e09-4e9e-9684-876673500590_1080x1416.jpeg 474w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_474,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faf5e3415-5e09-4e9e-9684-876673500590_1080x1416.jpeg" sizes="100vw" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faf5e3415-5e09-4e9e-9684-876673500590_1080x1416.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_474,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faf5e3415-5e09-4e9e-9684-876673500590_1080x1416.jpeg 474w" width="474"></picture><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdfc5b15f-92bb-4791-9523-4724aa3528b3_1080x1440.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_474,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdfc5b15f-92bb-4791-9523-4724aa3528b3_1080x1440.jpeg 474w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_474,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdfc5b15f-92bb-4791-9523-4724aa3528b3_1080x1440.jpeg" sizes="100vw" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdfc5b15f-92bb-4791-9523-4724aa3528b3_1080x1440.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_474,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdfc5b15f-92bb-4791-9523-4724aa3528b3_1080x1440.jpeg 474w" width="474"></picture></div></figure><p><em><strong>Representative dishes:</strong></em></p><ul><li><p><strong>Scallion Braised Sea Cucumber (葱烧海参). </strong><em>Left. </em><span>Another famous Shandong banquet dish.

Would French food have the same reputation if we separated it from Grand Paris and Provence?</span></p><p>I don’t have too many answers.

For example, the Tianjin’s ‘Four Happy Meatballs’ (</span><em>top left</em><span>, below) is quite obviously influenced by this classical tradition. Further, just like neighboring Beijing, this classical traditional also blends and mixes with some Chinese-Muslim influences (e.g. braised beef strips, </span><em>top center</em><span>).</span></p><p><span>But within this cauldron of Shandong, Hebei, Beijing, and Tianjin… there’s </span><em>still</em><span> undeniably some regionality. A decent example might be the case of Sichuan pepper oil. Within the traditional Shandong system, Sichuan pepper oil is used rather judiciously, mostly to counter certain unpleasant odors. In Beijing, the usage is dialed up, appearing as a dipping sauce and as a topping for noodles. Tianjin goes even further - practically all dishes make use of Sichuan pepper oil to some extent, employing a special local variant that also includes toasted sesame in the mix.</span></p><p><span>Tianjin is also unique among the four in its western influence - </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_concessions_in_Tianjin" rel="">it was among the treaty ports</a><span>, after all.

their category of ‘white sauce’ dishes.</span></p><p><span>(Oh, and Tianjin people would kill me if I didn’t mention that they were the progenitor of the </span><em>Jianbing</em><span>

In practice, what this created was a separate, trans-provincial, scholar-official class: the “Mandarins”.</span></p><p><span>As to what they ate, I like to think of it sort of akin to the fare served up in Michelin guide, or maybe ‘Asia’s Top 50’. From </span><a href="https://guide.michelin.com/th/en/singapore-region/singapore/restaurant/zen" rel="">Zen in Singapore</a><span>, to </span><a href="https://guide.michelin.com/th/en/greater-london/london/restaurant/helene-darroze-at-the-connaught" rel="">Hélène Darroze in London</a><span>, to </span><a href="https://www.ledubkk.com/" rel="">Le Du in Bangkok</a><span>, to </span><a href="https://www.theworlds50best.com/asia/en/the-list/florilege.html" rel="">Florilège in Tokyo</a><span>, to </span><a href="https://guide.michelin.com/th/en/new-york-state/new-york/restaurant/le-bernardin" rel="">Le Bernardin in New York</a><span>… there’s a certain sameness to it all. I think of it as the food of our trans-national scholar-capitalist class — the New Mandarins. I call it “Davos cuisine”. It’s a cuisine not without merit, and definitely not without craft. Just a different flavor of bread.</span></p><p><span>And what New York and London are today to Davos Cuisine, Beijing was to </span><em>Guanfu</em><span> Cuisine. It was the nexus, the gathering point. And just like how Davos Cuisine is layered on with the elite traditions of France and Japan, the food in Beijing was also layered on with the banquet traditions of Huaiyang and Shandong. They grabbed sauces and stocks from the latter, and the former… I mean, the famed Peking Duck is nothing if not a Nanjing-Northern fusion.</span></p><p><span>These days, there’s a blending — it’s not overly easy to tell where general Northern/Hebei stops and classical Beijing begins. Modern Beijing is also a big city, filled with migrants from elsewhere - the new ‘national cuisine’ of Sichuan is well represented, ditto with the food from the Northeast. Even the trans-national scholar-capitalist class is not without </span><a href="https://guide.michelin.com/th/en/beijing-municipality/beijing/restaurant/giada-garden" rel="">their canteens</a><span>.</span></p><p><span>But besides the must of Peking Duck, if there’s one thing I can recommend to international travelers to Beijing… it’s the city’s </span><em>Zhujingban</em><span> (驻京办). These are old-style, government-run restaurants that dedicate themselves to a cuisine of a single province. Though they might not be completely representative, the food quality is generally very good. An echo, in a way, of the tradition of gathering cuisines from around the country. If you’re in Beijing, curious about what Hubei food is like, but have no time to travel to Hubei… the Hubei </span><em>Zhujingban</em><span> (“</span><a href="https://you.ctrip.com/food/1/4936316.html" rel="">Hubei Restaurant</a><span>”) wouldn’t be a bad bet.</span></p><figure data-drag-handle="true" data-component-name="ImageGallery"><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F98de0da5-b4fb-47f3-a529-7acf1d0730d0_1080x1440.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_474,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F98de0da5-b4fb-47f3-a529-7acf1d0730d0_1080x1440.jpeg 474w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_474,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F98de0da5-b4fb-47f3-a529-7acf1d0730d0_1080x1440.jpeg" sizes="100vw" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F98de0da5-b4fb-47f3-a529-7acf1d0730d0_1080x1440.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_474,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F98de0da5-b4fb-47f3-a529-7acf1d0730d0_1080x1440.jpeg 474w" width="474"></picture><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F31391711-b2de-442d-b0f3-35af7b123f3c_1080x1440.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_474,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F31391711-b2de-442d-b0f3-35af7b123f3c_1080x1440.jpeg 474w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_474,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F31391711-b2de-442d-b0f3-35af7b123f3c_1080x1440.jpeg" sizes="100vw" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F31391711-b2de-442d-b0f3-35af7b123f3c_1080x1440.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_474,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F31391711-b2de-442d-b0f3-35af7b123f3c_1080x1440.jpeg 474w" width="474"></picture><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1c055ef6-8870-4660-ad0d-92e7d240a923_1080x1440.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_474,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1c055ef6-8870-4660-ad0d-92e7d240a923_1080x1440.jpeg 474w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_474,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1c055ef6-8870-4660-ad0d-92e7d240a923_1080x1440.jpeg" sizes="100vw" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1c055ef6-8870-4660-ad0d-92e7d240a923_1080x1440.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_474,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1c055ef6-8870-4660-ad0d-92e7d240a923_1080x1440.jpeg 474w" width="474"></picture></div></figure><p><em><strong>Representative dishes:</strong></em></p><ul><li><p><strong>Peking Duck (北京烤鸭). </strong><em>Left. </em><span>The icon.

Dongbei dish that can be found throughout all three provinces. Pork loin coated in a incredibly viscous, borderline non-newtonian starch coating and deep fried to create a tooth-shatteringly crunchy crust. Believed to have originated in Harbin, which tops with a simple, vinegar-based sweet and sour sauce.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Suancai Pork Belly (酸菜白肉). </strong><em>Top center.</em><strong> </strong><span>A winter favorite and a home cooking classic, this braise of fermented cabbage and skin-on pork belly can also double as a hotpot base as well. The meat can also be dunked in a soy sauce-vinegar-garlic-chili oil dip at the table. </span></p></li><li><p><strong>Iron Pot Braises (铁锅炖). </strong><em>Top right.</em><strong> </strong><span>Traditionally a home cooking dish, it originally came from the practice of braising (often foraged) stuff in a big pot to create a sort of ‘one pot meal’. Only gaining the name ‘iron pot braise’ (铁锅炖) after it became commercialized, a popular move is to slap some cornbread or flatbread on the side to cook simultaneously, as pictured. </span></p></li><li><p><strong>Di San Xian (地三鲜). </strong><em>Bottom left.</em><strong> </strong><span>Historically, ‘Di San Xian’ referred to a mix of tiger, bear, and deer. Given that those ingredients are difficult to find and most definitely illegal, Di San Xian now refers to a vegetarian mix of eggplant, green pepper, and potato.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Hu Bing (烀饼). </strong><em>Bottom center.</em><strong> </strong><span>Similar in concept to the Di Guo chicken in Jiangsu, these braises add dough to the top of the dish to steam while cooking.</span><strong> </strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Jiang Gu Jia (酱骨架). </strong><em>Bottom right.</em><strong> </strong><span>While this can be found in home kitchens as well, this is a Dongbei restaurant must-order. It consists of pig thigh bone blanched and red braised with the usual suspect plus (most importantly) Dongbei-style soy bean paste.</span></p></li></ul><figure data-drag-handle="true" data-component-name="ImageGallery"><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff07d4ab4-a4a8-4443-b671-bf1f289cb256_1080x1128.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_474,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff07d4ab4-a4a8-4443-b671-bf1f289cb256_1080x1128.jpeg 474w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_474,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff07d4ab4-a4a8-4443-b671-bf1f289cb256_1080x1128.jpeg" sizes="100vw" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff07d4ab4-a4a8-4443-b671-bf1f289cb256_1080x1128.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_474,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff07d4ab4-a4a8-4443-b671-bf1f289cb256_1080x1128.jpeg 474w" width="474"></picture><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa7429cb5-3d92-44f8-95fd-87a10b6389d9_1080x1440.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_474,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa7429cb5-3d92-44f8-95fd-87a10b6389d9_1080x1440.jpeg 474w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_474,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa7429cb5-3d92-44f8-95fd-87a10b6389d9_1080x1440.jpeg" sizes="100vw" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa7429cb5-3d92-44f8-95fd-87a10b6389d9_1080x1440.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_474,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa7429cb5-3d92-44f8-95fd-87a10b6389d9_1080x1440.jpeg 474w" width="474"></picture><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F86b91eec-ea7a-4c6b-b2a6-0d7dbd2f5212_1080x1092.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_474,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F86b91eec-ea7a-4c6b-b2a6-0d7dbd2f5212_1080x1092.jpeg 474w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_474,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F86b91eec-ea7a-4c6b-b2a6-0d7dbd2f5212_1080x1092.jpeg" sizes="100vw" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F86b91eec-ea7a-4c6b-b2a6-0d7dbd2f5212_1080x1092.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_474,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F86b91eec-ea7a-4c6b-b2a6-0d7dbd2f5212_1080x1092.jpeg 474w" width="474"></picture></div></figure><p><em><strong>Representative dishes:</strong></em></p><ul><li><p><strong>Shrimp Paste Braised Squid (虾酱笔管). </strong><em>Left. </em><span>Shrimp paste is a common ingredient in the area, as well as ‘shrimp oil’ (虾油, a fermented sauce similar in flavor to fish sauce).

Hong Kong </span><em>is</em><span> Cantonese, but it’s a Cantonese with a bit of an accent. A cultural institution in Hong Kong is </span><em>Cha Chaan Teng</em><span> - Canto-western diners that left an indelible imprint on how Hong Kongers eat. Hong Kong-style milk tea might be the most obvious bit, but pineapple buns and breakfast macaroni soup wouldn’t be far behind.</span></p><p><span>Of course, post reform and opening, Hong Kong western cuisine came incredibly popular within mainland Cantonese areas as well. In our old home of Shunde, these days Hong Kong </span><em>Cha Chaan Teng</em><span> are almost as popular of a restaurant concept as the more classically Cantonese </span><em>Dai Pai Dong. </em><span>Steph herself also grew up with Macaroni Soup. In a generation it’s quite likely that the distinction between Hong Kong Cantonese and Mainland Cantonese will begin to melt away.</span></p><p>Of course, besides the western influence, Hong Kong certainly also developed its own unique local Cantonese dishes, and we’ve listed a few below. That said, it’s important to bear in mind that there’s similar regionality to be found within many cities, towns, and villages of the greater Pearl River Delta region.</p><figure

There is, after all, some fare in the city that feels </span><em>very</em><span> Cantonese - right there next to the city’s legendary take on </span><em>Pastel de Nata.  </em></p><p><span>But the more I delved into Macanese food, the odder the cuisine started to look. The chili pepper seemed more prominent than either Cantonese </span><em>or</em><span> Portuguese food; there were certain unmistakably Southeast Asian ingredients at play like turmeric, coconut, and tamarind. </span></p><p>It turns out I had the wrong mental model. </p><p><span>Ex-Portuguese colonies and trading posts cannot be viewed in isolation. Goa is not simply Indian-Portuguese fusion, nor is Malacca a straightforward case of Malaysian-Portuguese fusion. Lisbon, Cape Verde, Brazil, Mozambique, Goa, Malacca, Macau… all of these should be thought of as nodes that </span><em>together </em><span>make a larger network: the Lusophone world. </span></p><p>So should Macanese count on our list as a “Chinese” cuisine? It’s a difficult call. Push comes to shove, I would call it ‘Lusophone’ above anything.</p><p><span>We quite enjoy making Macanese food and make it on the channel from time to time. We’re not the worst source on the topic, I feel, but it should be noted that without understanding Portuguese we’re also far from the best.

That is, not in the simple terms of Chaozhou-Out, but rather that all of the major nodes in the Teochew trading network — Chaozhou, Hong Kong, Vietnam, Singapore, and Bangkok - are all part of a larger ‘system’. </p><p>Teochew chefs tend to delineate three schools of Teochew cuisine: Chaozhou, Hong Kong, and Southeast Asian. Seems to be as reasonable of a starting point as any.</p><p><span>Now, I’m not a believer in ranking cuisines. But I do feel a bit compelled to say that I </span><em>personally</em><span> enjoy Hong Kong Teochew the most. Of the three, Hong Kong Teochew cuisine conforms most to how Cantonese would define quality standards, and I’ve vigorously and enthusiastically internalized Cantonese culinary propaganda for over a decade now.</span></p><p>Regardless, Hong Kong is undeniably a good place to eat Teochew food. </p><p><em><strong>Representative dishes:</strong></em></p><ul><li><p><strong>Fishball noodles (鱼蛋粉).</strong><span> </span><em>Left. </em><span>The infamous Kowloon Walled City, once a quite working class Teochew neighborhood, used to be a center of Hong Kong’s fishball production. Today, there are Teochew fishball noodle joints scattered across Hong Kong — served with Teochew style rice noodles, and a spicy chili oil now known in the west as “Chiu Chow Chili Oil” (in Hong Kong, it’s usually just called ‘Hong Kong chili oil’, as the ingredient is not traditional to the Chaozhou mainland).</span></p></li><li><p><strong>‘Wet fried’ beef noodles (湿炒牛河).</strong><span> </span><em>Right. </em><span>In contrast to the Cantonese ‘dry’ fried beef rice noodles, this Teochew sort smothers theirs with gravy (as the cuisine has a penchant to do).</span></p></li></ul><p><em><strong>Why do I tend to sound so weird when I write about Taiwan?</strong></em></p><p>Let me be frank. Discussing food in Taiwan is difficult for us, for two major reasons.</p><p><span>First, whenever I write about the island, words need to be selected carefully. Whenever I include a map of China that includes anything off the west of Fujian, the map needs to be selected carefully. We live in China, not America. Our livelihood is in China, Steph’s family is in China, and we </span><em>enjoy</em><span> all of those things being in China. We simply cannot be fast and loose with our words, mindlessly employing the sort of verbiage that would be second nature to many Americans</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-3-151441573" href="https://chinesecookingdemystified.substack.com/p/63-chinese-cuisines-the-complete#footnote-3-151441573" target="_self" rel="">3</a></span><span>.</span></p><p><span>The second reason Taiwan is difficult is because of travel. Our culinary opinions are forged by… actually going places. You can read all you like, you can cook all you like, but you can’t truly understand what a cuisine is really </span><em>like</em><span> until you get your feet down in the soil of a place. </span></p><p><span>Like most mainland Chinese, Steph - the real brains of this channel - is currently barred from independent travel to Taiwan. On the Taiwan side, in the pre-Trump era they really liked to discriminate based on which mainland city you came from (i.e. which </span><em>Hukou </em><span>you held), and Steph’s was never on the approved list. And of course, as relations deteriorated, the mainland pulled their economic carrot of ‘mass tourism’ away, as something they could keep in their back pocket.</span></p><p>I, Chris, have been to Taiwan (briefly) twice - both a long time ago, before we started the channel. We are certainly not the best people out there to talk about food in Taiwan.</p><p><span>And yet, with those caveats, when I look at English-language food writing on Taiwan, a lot of it feels to be the perspective of… I dunno, Los Angeles gazing westward: “I flew into TPE and ate these things on my holiday”.

Teochew were historically heavily integrated with the Thai royal court, they staffed the bureaucracy and functioned as tax collectors.

And say what you will about forced assimilation — it’s undeniably an ugly process — in a generation or two, everybody… forgets.</span></p><p><span>So where “Thai-Chinese” begins and ends is really quite difficult to parse. Where do we put the backpacker favorite of </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mi_krop" rel="">Mee Krob</a><span>? It was invented by a Teochew family in Bangkok!

A bit like the English, the Spanish, and the French in </span><em>their</em><span> overseas adventures… these settler-mercantile groups were fundamentally rivals. Whether it be the kingdom of Siam or the various Malay Sultanates, they frequently duked it out over influence and trading rights within these polities. The Hainanese and the Hakka, meanwhile, would often be imported by these groups as laborers, forming the five major dialect groups within Southeast Asia.</span></p><p>In some places, certain dialect groups maintained dominance. Siam was dominated by the Teochew; Borneo, the Hakka.</p><p><span>The Straits - Singapore, Malaysia, and Sumatran Indonesia - was an area where all five dialect groups existed alongside of eachother. A bit like Teochew and Central Thailand, it can sometimes be quite difficult to determine where ‘Straits Chinese’ ends and begins. Should </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peranakan_cuisine" rel="">Peranakan Cuisine</a><span> be considered as part of Straits Chinese?</span></p><p>I’m certain someone more familiar with the cuisine down there would be able to make some more thoughtful and educated delineations. But it feels a crime not to mention the Straits in a list of Chinese cuisines, given just how globally iconic some of these dishes are. </p><figure data-drag-handle="true"

Indian-Chinese? Japanese </span><em>Chuka</em><span>? Peruvian </span><em>Chifa</em><span>? Chinese cuisine has certainly made its way throughout the world! </span></p><p>And obviously, many of these global inventions are incredibly distinct. If we just zero in on takeout Chinese menus in the United States, the Crab Rangoon, General Tso’s Chicken and Pupu Platters certainly do not exist in restaurant menus on the China mainland. I’ve seen a lot of people call this stuff “Chinese American Cuisine”, and maybe we should just swim with the current, go there too and add another tally mark to our list of Chinese cuisines. </p><p><span>But something that nags on me is that from what </span><em>I’ve</em><span> seen, these dishes usually seem to be relegated to a commercialized context - what Chinese American families cook at home </span><em>for themselves</em><span> is seems to be quite different.</span></p><p>Now, I don’t live in America, so definitely do correct me if I’m wrong. My sample size is incredibly small (a couple friends from uni and that’s about it). At home, my friend whose family immigrated from Guangdong, they ate… Cantonese food. My buddy that came from a Teochew family in Vietnam, they ate… Teochew Vietnamese food. When me and Steph go back to the USA to see my family, we’ll sometimes go and shoot a little B-roll at my old local takeout joint - over the years, we’ve started chit chatting with the owners (they’re from Fuzhou). Even in the face of Steph’s compliments, sometimes they’re sometimes a little puzzled why we’re eating at the takeout joint, and recommend other more authentic Chinese restaurants in the area. </p><p>At home, it doesn’t seem to me like Chinese-Americans whip up Pupu platters any more than the rest of the country – if anything, maybe a little less. </p><p>It’s a commercialized cuisine.</p><p><span>Now, to my mind, that doesn’t make it bad – I’m no authenticity snob, I like this stuff – but it does make it </span><em><strong>incomplete</strong></em><span>. The way I think about it is that a cuisine should be practiced </span><em>both</em><span> in restaurants </span><em>and</em><span> in homes, otherwise it’s really hard to draw the line between ‘cuisine’ and ‘restaurant concept’. Like, is “Peking Duck” or “Sichuan Hotpot” a cuisine? Those restaurants usually have their own spate of dishes! Or maybe more relevant here… what about </span><em>Cha Chaan Teng</em><span>, Canto-western fusion?</span></p><p><span>As we said before… for our map, we ended up deciding that Canto-western</span><em> </em><span>wasn’t a ‘cuisine’: it was an element of a cuisine that </span><em>defined </em><span>what it meant to eat Hong Kong food</span><strong>.</strong></p><p>In the same way, Chinese takeout is one of those fundamental restaurant concepts like the the Diner, the Deli, and the Pizza Joint that really forged a larger ‘American’ cuisine. At this point, Sweet and Sour Pork quite obviously belongs to that pantheon of Americana - right alongside barbecue, pizza, subs, and burgers. </p><p><span>It’s a similar thing happening with Japan. Could you imagine Japanese cuisine without </span><em>Chuka</em><span> dishes? Seriously, just peruse the </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_Chinese_cuisine" rel="">Wikipedia entry on the subject</a><span>. This wouldn’t just be a Japanese cuisine without the usual suspects like Mabo Dofu and Chashu - it would be a Japanese cuisine</span><strong> without Ramen</strong><span>. The thought would be borderline unthinkable. </span></p><p>You can, of course, disagree… I keep flipping back and forth myself.</p></div></article></div><div id="discussion"><h4>Discussion about this post</h4></div></div>]]></description>

        <p>Quadlet lets you run your Podman containers as systemd services.
This is especially useful for running containers in the background and automatically starting them after a server reboot.</p>
<p>Running Podman containers under systemd isn't new.
Indeed, this was supported by Podman for a long time with the command <a href="https://docs.podman.io/en/latest/markdown/podman-generate-systemd.1.html"><code>podman generate systemd</code></a>.
But this command now shows a deprecation warning to migrate to Quadlet.</p>
<p>For some months, I was too lazy to do that migration on my home server.
Why even touch a working system?
But now that I finally found time for it, I really appreciate Quadlet!
I think that Podman finally has a Docker Compose alternative which is even more flexible and powerful!</p>
<p>In this blog post, I will explain how to use Quadlet with <strong>rootless</strong> Podman and migrate from the old method with <code>podman generate systemd</code>.</p>
<span id="continue-reading"></span><div>
        <p>Note</p>
        <p>If you wonder why systemd: Something has to start containers when there is no daemon (since Podman is daemonless).</p>
<p>If you are part of the vocal minority hating against systemd, then please leave instead of trolling.</p>

<h2 id="the-deprecated-method"><a href="#the-deprecated-method">The deprecated method</a></h2>
<p>Let's see how the old method worked before comparing it to Quadlet.
You can skip to the Quadlet section though.</p>
<p>First, you had to create a container.
In an older post about <a href="https://mo8it.com/blog/containerized-postgresql-with-rootless-podman/">Containerized PostgreSQL with rootless Podman</a>, I created a container with a command similar to the following:</p>
<pre data-lang="fish"><code data-lang="fish"><span>podman </span><span>create </span><span>\
</span><span>  </span><span>--name </span><span>test-db </span><span>\
</span><span>  </span><span>-p </span><span>5432:5432 </span><span>\
</span><span>  </span><span>-v </span><span>~</span><span>/volumes/test-db:/var/lib/postgresql/data:Z </span><span>\
</span><span>  </span><span>-e </span><span>POSTGRES_PASSWORD=CHANGE_ME </span><span>\
</span><span>  </span><span>--label </span><span>"io.containers.autoupdate=registry" </span><span>\
</span><span>  docker.io/library/postgres:16
</span></code></pre>
<p>The command details are explained in the older post.
The only option that isn't explained there is <code>--label "io.containers.autoupdate=registry"</code>.
This option enables updating the container image using <code>podman auto-update</code> which will be explained later in this post.</p>
<p>After creating the container, you can run the following command:</p>
<pre data-lang="fish"><code data-lang="fish"><span>podman </span><span>generate systemd test-db </span><span>-fn --new
</span></code></pre>
<p>It creates the systemd service file <code>container-test-db.service</code> in your current path.
The options of the command aren't relevant for now, but they are also explained in the older post.</p>
<p>To use this generated service file, you had to place it in the directory <code>~/.config/systemd/user</code>.
To enable and start it, you had to run the following command:</p>
<pre data-lang="fish"><code data-lang="fish"><span>systemctl </span><span>--user </span><span>enable </span><span>--now </span><span>container-test-db
</span></code></pre>
<h2 id="the-problem"><a href="#the-problem">The problem</a></h2>
<p>The problem with the old method is that it required you to run commands to…</p>
<ol>
<li>create a container</li>
<li>generate a service file</li>
<li>move the service file if not already in the mentioned directory</li>
<li>enable the service</li>
</ol>
<p>Especially the command for creating the container is often lengthy.
This means that you had to create a shell script with these commands if you wanted to be able to rerun them later.</p>
<p>To reduce duplication, I created the following fish function to be called in my fish scripts that create the containers:</p>
<pre data-lang="fish"><code data-lang="fish"><span>function </span><span>podman-default-create
</span><span>    </span><span>set </span><span>-l </span><span>container_name $argv[</span><span>1</span><span>]
</span><span>
</span><span>    </span><span>podman </span><span>create </span><span>\
</span><span>        </span><span>--name </span><span>$container_name </span><span>\
</span><span>        </span><span>--replace </span><span>\
</span><span>        $argv[</span><span>2</span><span>..</span><span>]</span><span>; </span><span>or return </span><span>1
</span><span>
</span><span>    </span><span>podman </span><span>generate systemd </span><span>--no-header --new --name </span><span>$container_name </span><span>&gt;~</span><span>/.config/systemd/user/container-$container_name.service</span><span>; </span><span>or return </span><span>1
</span><span>
</span><span>    </span><span>systemctl </span><span>--user </span><span>enable </span><span>--now </span><span>container-$container_name
</span><span>end
</span></code></pre>
<p>You don't have to understand the details of the function above.
What I want to demonstrate with it is that the old method was too hacky and involved the usage of redundant commands.</p>
<p>There must be an easier way, you might think.
Especially if you experienced the convenience that Docker Compose provides.
But this is not the only problem.
The old method is very inflexible!</p>
<p>If you want to cutomize the service file and use all systemd features, you need to <em>manually</em> edit it <em>after each generation</em>!</p>
<h2 id="quadlet"><a href="#quadlet">Quadlet</a></h2>
<p>Let's take a look at the new method with Quadlet.</p>
<p>First, you create the directory <code>~/.config/containers/systemd</code>.
Then, you place a <code>.container</code> file inside it.
For example, here is the <code>test-db.container</code> file:</p>
<pre data-lang="ini"><code data-lang="ini"><span>[Container]
</span><span>Image</span><span>=</span><span>docker</span><span>.</span><span>io</span><span>/</span><span>library</span><span>/</span><span>postgres</span><span>:</span><span>16
</span><span>AutoUpdate</span><span>=</span><span>registry
</span><span>PublishPort</span><span>=</span><span>5432</span><span>:</span><span>5432
</span><span>Volume</span><span>=</span><span>%h</span><span>/</span><span>volumes</span><span>/</span><span>test</span><span>-</span><span>db</span><span>:/</span><span>var</span><span>/</span><span>lib</span><span>/</span><span>postgresql</span><span>/</span><span>data</span><span>:</span><span>Z
</span><span>Environment</span><span>=</span><span>POSTGRES_PASSWORD</span><span>=</span><span>CHANGE_ME
</span><span>
</span><span>[Service]
</span><span>Restart</span><span>=</span><span>always
</span><span>
</span><span>[Install]
</span><span>WantedBy</span><span>=</span><span>default</span><span>.</span><span>target
</span></code></pre>
<p>It is a normal systemd service file but with the special section <code>[Container]</code>.
This section has <a href="https://docs.podman.io/en/latest/markdown/podman-systemd.unit.5.html#container-units-container">many documented options</a>.
Almost all these options map to command line options that can be used to create a container with Podman (<code>podman create</code>).
The ones that we are interested in for the example are the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Image</code> specifies the image (with tag) to use</li>
<li><code>AutoUpdate=registry</code> maps to <code>--label "io.containers.autoupdate=registry"</code> (explained later in this post)</li>
<li><code>PublishPort</code> maps to <code>-p</code></li>
<li><code>Volume</code> maps to <code>-v</code></li>
<li><code>Environment</code> maps to <code>-e</code></li>
</ul>
<p>It is important to use the <a href="https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/latest/systemd.unit.html#Specifiers">systemd specifier</a> <code>%h</code> instead of <code>~</code> for the user home directory.</p>
<p>In the <code>[Service]</code> section, we use the <a href="https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/latest/systemd.service.html#Restart="><code>Restart</code></a> option and set it to <code>always</code> to always restart the container (unless stopped manually).</p>
<p>To automatically start the container on boot, we set the <a href="https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/latest/systemd.unit.html#WantedBy="><code>WantedBy</code></a> option in the <code>[Install]</code> section to <code>default.target</code>.</p>
<div>
        <p>Note</p>
        <p>I thought that setting <code>WantedBy</code> to <code>multi-user.target</code> would work because it is the default target on servers.
But it doesn't work in the case of rootless containers.</p>
<p><code>multi-user.target</code> is not defined in the user mode in systemd.
You can verify this by running the command <code>systemctl --user status multi-user.target</code>.
It is only defined in the system mode (<code>systemctl status multi-user.target</code> without <code>--user</code>).</p>

    </div>
<p>Since we use user services for systemd, we have to enable the <em>linger</em> for our user to start the containers without the user being logged in:</p>
<pre data-lang="fish"><code data-lang="fish"><span>loginctl </span><span>enable-linger
</span></code></pre>
<div>
        <p>⚠️ Warning ⚠️</p>
        <p>Enabling the linger is required for the container to be automatically started after a server reboot!</p>

    </div>
<p>For systemd to discover the new service file, run <code>systemctl --user daemon-reload</code>.
Now, you can start the container with <code>systemctl --user start test-db</code>.</p>
<p>You can check the status of the container service by running <code>systemctl --user status test-db</code>.
You can also verify that the Podman container is running by running <code>podman ps</code>.
You should find the container <code>systemd-test-db</code>.</p>
<p>The container has the name of the service file (<code>test-db.container</code> without the <code>.container</code> extension) prefixed by <code>systemd-</code> to avoid collisions with containers not managed by systemd.
But you can manually set the name of the container using the <code>ContainerName</code> option in the <code>[Container]</code> section.</p>
<h2 id="is-it-any-better"><a href="#is-it-any-better">Is it any better?</a></h2>
<p>My first impression was: "Well, now I have to map all the <code>podman create</code> options to their equivalents in the <code>[Container]</code> section. Where is the benefit?".</p>
<p>But after migrating all containers, I found the following benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>You have only one file (the container service file) instead of a script that generates a service file.</li>
<li>You can use all options possible in systemd. All options that you know about in the <code>[Unit]</code> and <code>[Service]</code> sections are supported. For example, you can specify a command to run before starting the container by setting the <code>StartExecPre</code> option. No more manual editing of generated files anymore!</li>
<li>Rather subjective: Writing configuration files is easier than writing and debugging shell scripts.</li>
<li>It is easier to handle dependencies as we will see in the next section.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="dependencies"><a href="#dependencies">Dependencies</a></h2>
<p>Let's assume that we have an app container that depends on the database container that we created.</p>
<p>You want the database container to be automatically started when the app container is started.
You also want to make sure that the app container is started <strong>after</strong> the database container.
Otherwise, the app container might fail to start.</p>
<p>How can we express this dependency?</p>
<p>Let's use <a href="https://codeberg.org/mo8it/oxitraffic/">OxiTraffic</a> as an example (shameless plug 😅).</p>
<p>Here is the container service file <code>oxitraffic.container</code> that should be placed in <code>~/.config/containers/systemd</code>:</p>
<pre data-lang="ini"><code data-lang="ini"><span>[Container]
</span><span>Image</span><span>=</span><span>docker</span><span>.</span><span>io</span><span>/</span><span>mo8it</span><span>/</span><span>oxitraffic</span><span>:</span><span>0</span><span>.</span><span>9</span><span>.</span><span>2

</span><span>Volume</span><span>=</span><span>%h</span><span>/</span><span>volumes</span><span>/</span><span>oxitraffic</span><span>/</span><span>logs</span><span>:/</span><span>var</span><span>/</span><span>log</span><span>/</span><span>oxitraffic</span><span>:</span><span>Z
</span><span>
</span><span>[Unit]

</span><span>After</span><span>=</span><span>test</span><span>-</span><span>db</span><span>.</span><span>service
</span><span>
</span><span>[Service]
</span><span>Restart</span><span>=</span><span>always
</span><span>
</span><span>[Install]
</span><span>WantedBy</span><span>=</span><span>default</span><span>.</span><span>target
</span></code></pre>
<p>The new section is <code>[Unit]</code>.
We set the <a href="https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/latest/systemd.unit.html#Requires="><code>Requires</code></a> option to <code>test-db.service</code> to only start the app when the database is started.
We also set the <a href="https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/latest/systemd.unit.html#Before="><code>After</code></a> option to make sure that both containers aren't started in parallel.</p>
<p>Note that we use <code>test-db.service</code> when referencing this container service and not <code>test-db.container</code>.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>test-db.container</code> is the file name.</li>
<li><code>test-db.service</code> is the service name.</li>
<li><code>systemd-test-db</code> is the default container name.</li>
</ul>
<p>For the app to communicate with the database, a network should be added to both containers with the <code>Network</code> option in the <code>[Container]</code> section, but networking is out of the scope of this post.</p>
<h2 id="too-many-files"><a href="#too-many-files">Too many files?</a></h2>
<p>In our example, we created two files, one for the app container and one for the database container.
Does this mean that multi-container apps are more complex with Quadlet because you can't just put them in one file like with Docker Compose?</p>
<p>It depends on how you define complexity in this context.
Does splitting content over multiple files always result in a higher complexity?</p>
<p>For me, it is more complex to have everything in the same file.
I had to maintain Docker Compose files with hundreds of lines and dozens of containers…
That wasn't fun!
Having each container in its own file has less mental overhead for me because I just have to think about this single container when I am in its file.
Of course, you need to specify its dependencies on other containers, but you don't need to think about the details of these other containers.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/mailcow/mailcow-dockerized/blob/cb0b0235f01a8e4102ece9540fe0aa3bb2b60d72/docker-compose.yml">The Docker Compose file of Mailcow</a> is a <strong>terrifying</strong> example of huge Docker Compose files.</p>
<div>
        <p>Note</p>
        <p>Docker Compose supports splitting to multiple files.</p>

    </div>
<p>So we need multiple files.
But we should still group related ones together!
Quadlet supports placing unit files inside directories in the <code>~/.config/containers/systemd</code> directory.
For our example, you would create an <code>oxitraffic</code> directory and place both files inside it.</p>
<h2 id="updating-images"><a href="#updating-images">Updating images</a></h2>
<p>Now, we have containers running in the background and automatically started after a server reboot.
Wouldn't it be nice to have an easy method to update the images of these containers without running <code>podman pull</code> for every container and then restarting the updated ones?</p>
<p>For example, if a new image is uploaded for PostgreSQL 16 (with the image tag <code>16</code> that we used), then the image should be updated and the container should be restarted.</p>
<p>With Docker, you would need something like <a href="https://containrrr.dev/watchtower/">Watchtower</a>.
But Podman provides a tool out of the box!</p>
<p>If you set <code>AutoUpdate=registry</code>, you can just run <code>podman auto-update</code> and Podman will check if the registry has a newer image which is compatible with the used tag.
In that case, the image will be pulled and the container will be restarted.
It is that easy 😍</p>
<p>Of course, this could be dangerous if you use a tag like <code>latest</code> for OxiTraffic instead of a concrete version like <code>0.9.2</code>.
Because the next version pushed to the <code>latest</code> tag might include a breaking change!
It is even more dramatic if you use the <code>latest</code> tag for the PostgreSQL image because manual migrations are always required when upgrading PostgreSQL to a new major version.</p>
<p>Therefore, always use a tag that can't lead to a breaking change!
Trust me, this is not only a problem with Podman updates.
I learned this the hard way when trying to deploy Docker containers a while ago that used the <code>latest</code> tag.</p>
<p>Personally, I run <code>podman auto-update</code> manually on the server every couple of days to see what has been updated and make sure that the containers are still healthy afterwards.</p>
<h2 id="what-about-podman-compose"><a href="#what-about-podman-compose">What about podman-compose?</a></h2>
<p>There is the Python script <a href="https://github.com/containers/podman-compose"><code>podman-compose</code></a> which runs Compose files with Podman.
But I don't consider it a long-term alternative to Docker Compose for multiple reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>podman-compose</code> is just a translation layer between the Compose spec and Podman with systemd. Why yet another layer of abstraction that sacrifices flexibility? It doesn't let you use all features of systemd.</li>
<li>I consider Python scripts a prototype because of Python's interpreted nature. Official Podman projects are written in a compiled language like Rust or Go.</li>
<li>It is not actively maintained. The last commit was 5 months ago.</li>
</ul>
<p>Quadlet aligns much better with the rootless, daemonless design of Podman.</p>
<p>If you are stuck with Compose files and would like to try out Quadlet, check out <a href="https://github.com/containers/podlet">podlet</a> that can help you during the migration.</p>
<h2 id="further-resources"><a href="#further-resources">Further resources</a></h2>
<p>Take this post as an introduction.
I highly recommend reading the man page <a href="https://docs.podman.io/en/latest/markdown/podman-systemd.unit.5.html"><code>podman-systemd.unit</code></a> to get a deeper understanding of Quadlet.
You don't need to read the documentation of every supported option though.</p>
<p>Quadlet doesn't only work with containers.
It can also manage pods, networks and volumes (see man page).</p>
<p>If you are new to writing systemd unit files (like me), I also recommend checking out the man pages <a href="https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/latest/systemd.unit.html"><code>systemd.unit</code></a> and <a href="https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/latest/systemd.service.html"><code>systemd.service</code></a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/containers/podlet">podlet</a> is a wonderful Rust tool that can help you during the migration.
It can create Quadlet files out of Podman commands or even (Docker) Compose files.</p>
<p>Check out the <a href="https://blog.while-true-do.io/podman-quadlets/">similar blog post on blog.while-true-do</a> for another perspective and a second example.
It is my favorite blog related to Linux 🥰</p>
<p>Finally, if you want to see my migration as an example, then you can compare <a href="https://git.mo8it.com/mo8it/main_server/src/commit/334ff80a365a55cec8c57d47047fdf6dbe6de71d/containers">before</a> and <a href="https://git.mo8it.com/mo8it/main_server/src/commit/14a949bb4f5b08d0666a7161ecfc8942cfa605b9/containers">after</a>.</p>

<p dir="auto">The <strong>Shift-To-Middle Array</strong> is a dynamic array designed to optimize <strong>insertions and deletions at both ends</strong>, offering a high-performance alternative to <code>std::deque</code>, <code>std::vector</code>, and linked lists. It achieves this while maintaining <strong>contiguous memory storage</strong>, improving <strong>cache locality</strong> and enabling <strong>efficient parallel processing</strong>.</p>

<p dir="auto">Unlike <code>std::deque</code>, which uses a fragmented block structure, the <strong>Shift-To-Middle Array</strong> dynamically <strong>redistributes space</strong> to avoid costly shifts. When resizing, elements are moved toward the middle, ensuring <strong>efficient insertions at both ends</strong> without excessive copying.</p>

<p dir="auto">The <strong>Shift-To-Middle Array</strong> was developed as part of an effort to create a more efficient <strong>implementation strategy for lists and deques</strong>. Traditional data structures, such as <code>std::deque</code> and linked lists, suffer from <strong>poor cache locality</strong> or <strong>fragmented memory allocations</strong>, leading to inefficiencies. By leveraging <strong>contiguous memory</strong>, dynamic mid-shifting, and modern CPU optimizations, Shift-To-Middle Array provides a <strong>balanced solution</strong> for insertion, deletion, and access performance.</p>

One wave could wait for a memory loads made by another wave. A "wavefront", "wave", or "warp" on a GPU is the rough equivalent of a CPU thread. It has its own register state, and can run out of sync with other waves. Each wave's instructions are independent from those in other waves with very few exceptions (like atomic operations).</p><blockquote><p>In RDNA 3, there was a strict ordering on the return of data, such that effectively a request that was made later in time was not permitted to pass a request made earlier in time, even if the data for it was ready much sooner.</p><p>Navi 4 Architecture Deep Dive, Andrew Pomianowski, CVP, Silicon Design Engineering (AMD)</p></blockquote><p>A fundamental tenet of multithreaded programming is that you get no ordering guarantees between threads unless you make it happen via locks or other mechanisms. That's what makes multithreaded performance scaling work. AMD's slide took me by surprise because there's no reason memory reads should be an exception. I re-watched the video several times and stared at the slide for a while to see if that's really what they meant. They clearly meant it, but I still didn't believe my eyes and ears. So I took time to craft a test for it.</p><p>AMD's slide describes a scenario where one wave's cache misses prevent another wave from quickly consuming data from cache hits. Causing cache misses is easy. I can pointer chase through a large array with a random pattern ("wave Y"). Similarly, I can keep accesses within a small memory footprint to get cache hits ("wave X"). But doing both at the same time is problematic. Wave Y may evict data used by wave X, causing cache misses on wave X.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F37cebe98-6193-441d-9614-41ae0bd308f8_1276x716.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F37cebe98-6193-441d-9614-41ae0bd308f8_1276x716.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F37cebe98-6193-441d-9614-41ae0bd308f8_1276x716.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F37cebe98-6193-441d-9614-41ae0bd308f8_1276x716.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F37cebe98-6193-441d-9614-41ae0bd308f8_1276x716.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F37cebe98-6193-441d-9614-41ae0bd308f8_1276x716.png" width="1276" height="716" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/37cebe98-6193-441d-9614-41ae0bd308f8_1276x716.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:716,&quot;width&quot;:1276,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:184441,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://chipsandcheese.com/i/159664006?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F37cebe98-6193-441d-9614-41ae0bd308f8_1276x716.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F37cebe98-6193-441d-9614-41ae0bd308f8_1276x716.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F37cebe98-6193-441d-9614-41ae0bd308f8_1276x716.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F37cebe98-6193-441d-9614-41ae0bd308f8_1276x716.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F37cebe98-6193-441d-9614-41ae0bd308f8_1276x716.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></picture></div></a><figcaption>Focusing on this scenario, and trying to create a Wave X and Wave Y that might hold each other up</figcaption></figure></div><p>Instead of going for cache hits and misses, I tested by seeing whether waiting on memory accesses in one wave would falsely wait in on memory accesses made by another.

It then consumes the load data, which means waiting for data to arrive from memory.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F019d5043-43b7-4c69-a802-fe11965cf3c6_581x512.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F019d5043-43b7-4c69-a802-fe11965cf3c6_581x512.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F019d5043-43b7-4c69-a802-fe11965cf3c6_581x512.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F019d5043-43b7-4c69-a802-fe11965cf3c6_581x512.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F019d5043-43b7-4c69-a802-fe11965cf3c6_581x512.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F019d5043-43b7-4c69-a802-fe11965cf3c6_581x512.png" width="581" height="512" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/019d5043-43b7-4c69-a802-fe11965cf3c6_581x512.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:512,&quot;width&quot;:581,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:33717,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://chipsandcheese.com/i/159664006?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F019d5043-43b7-4c69-a802-fe11965cf3c6_581x512.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F019d5043-43b7-4c69-a802-fe11965cf3c6_581x512.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F019d5043-43b7-4c69-a802-fe11965cf3c6_581x512.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F019d5043-43b7-4c69-a802-fe11965cf3c6_581x512.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F019d5043-43b7-4c69-a802-fe11965cf3c6_581x512.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>Once wave Y completes all of its accesses, it sets a flag in local memory. Wave X makes as many memory accesses as it can until it sees the flag set, after which it writes out its “score” and terminates. I run both waves in the same workgroup to ensure they share a WGP, and therefore share as much of the memory subsystem as possible. Keeping both waves in the same workgroup also lets me place the “finished” flag in local memory. Wave X has to check that flag every iteration, and it’s best to have flag checks not go through the same caches that wave Y is busy contaminating.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffcb15806-3761-403f-b44f-9bcbfb093090_1277x455.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffcb15806-3761-403f-b44f-9bcbfb093090_1277x455.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffcb15806-3761-403f-b44f-9bcbfb093090_1277x455.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffcb15806-3761-403f-b44f-9bcbfb093090_1277x455.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffcb15806-3761-403f-b44f-9bcbfb093090_1277x455.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffcb15806-3761-403f-b44f-9bcbfb093090_1277x455.png" width="1277" height="455" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/fcb15806-3761-403f-b44f-9bcbfb093090_1277x455.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:455,&quot;width&quot;:1277,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:68745,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://chipsandcheese.com/i/159664006?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffcb15806-3761-403f-b44f-9bcbfb093090_1277x455.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffcb15806-3761-403f-b44f-9bcbfb093090_1277x455.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffcb15806-3761-403f-b44f-9bcbfb093090_1277x455.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffcb15806-3761-403f-b44f-9bcbfb093090_1277x455.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffcb15806-3761-403f-b44f-9bcbfb093090_1277x455.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p><span>If each wave X access gets delayed by a wave Y one, I should see approximately the same number of accesses from both.

That’s the way it should be. RDNA 4 also displays more run-to-run variation, which is also expected because cache behavior is highly unpredictable in this test. I’m surprised by the results, but it’s convincing evidence that AMD indeed had false cross-wave memory delays on RDNA 3 and older GPU architectures. I also tested on Renoir’s Vega iGPU, and saw the same behavior as RDNA 3.</p><blockquote><p>At a simplistic level, you can imagine that requests from the shaders go into a queue to be serviced, and many of those requests can be in flight</p><p>Navi 4 Architecture Deep Dive, Andrew Pomianowski, CVP, Silicon Design Engineering (AMD)</p></blockquote><p><span>AMD's presentation hints that RDNA 3 and older GPUs had multiple waves sharing a memory access queue. As mentioned above, AMD GPUs since GCN handle memory dependencies with hardware counters that software waits on. By keeping </span><code>vmcnt</code><span> returns in-order, the compiler can wait on the specific load that produces data needed by the next instruction, without also waiting on every other load the wave has pending. RDNA 3 and prior AMD GPUs possibly had a shared memory access queue, with each entry tagged with its wave's ID. As each memory access leaves the queue in-order, hardware decrements the counter for its wave.</span></p><p>Perhaps RDNA 4 divides the shared queue into per-thread queues. That would align with the point on AMD's slide saying RDNA 4 introduces "additional out-of-order queues" for memory requests. Or perhaps RDNA 4 retains a shared queue, but can drain entries out-of-order. That would require tracking extra info, like whether a memory access is the oldest one for its wave.</p><p>Sharing a memory access queue and returning data in-order seems like a natural hardware simplification. That raises the question of whether GPU architectures from Intel and Nvidia had similar limitations.</p><p>Intel's Xe-LPG does not have false cross-wave memory dependencies. Running the same test on Meteor Lake's iGPU shows variation depending on where the two waves end up. If wave X and wave Y run on XVEs with shared instruction control logic, wave X's performance is lower than in other cases. Regardless, it's clear Xe-LPG doesn't force a wave to wait on another's accesses. Intel's subsequent Battlemage (Xe2) architecture shows similar behavior, and the same applies to Intel's Gen 9 (Skylake) graphics from a while ago.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank"

Evidently they share some general load/store logic besides the texture unit, because I don't touch textures in this test.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F55fe64cb-268f-44a6-8372-c3887ad270e2_776x398.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F55fe64cb-268f-44a6-8372-c3887ad270e2_776x398.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F55fe64cb-268f-44a6-8372-c3887ad270e2_776x398.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F55fe64cb-268f-44a6-8372-c3887ad270e2_776x398.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F55fe64cb-268f-44a6-8372-c3887ad270e2_776x398.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F55fe64cb-268f-44a6-8372-c3887ad270e2_776x398.png" width="776" height="398" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/55fe64cb-268f-44a6-8372-c3887ad270e2_776x398.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:398,&quot;width&quot;:776,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:13894,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://chipsandcheese.com/i/159664006?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F55fe64cb-268f-44a6-8372-c3887ad270e2_776x398.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F55fe64cb-268f-44a6-8372-c3887ad270e2_776x398.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F55fe64cb-268f-44a6-8372-c3887ad270e2_776x398.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F55fe64cb-268f-44a6-8372-c3887ad270e2_776x398.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F55fe64cb-268f-44a6-8372-c3887ad270e2_776x398.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>If a wave is not offset from another one by a multiple of four or multiple of 4 plus one, it doesn't have the false dependency problem.

Scalar memory loads are out-of-order, which means the compiler must wait for all scalar memory loads to complete (</span><code>kmcnt=0</code><span> or </span><code>lgmkcnt=0</code><span>) before using results from any pending scalar memory load. On RDNA 4, the compiler can interleave scalar memory and LDS accesses without having to wait for </span><code>lgkmcnt=0</code><span>.</span></p><p>Intel and Nvidia's GPUs use software managed scoreboards. A scoreboard entry can be set or and waited on by any instruction, regardless of memory access type. Therefore RDNA 4's optimization isn't applicable to those other GPU architectures. A cost to Intel/Nvidia's approach is that utilizing a big memory request queue would require a correspondingly large scoreboard. AMD can extend a counter by one bit and double the number of queue entries a wave can use.</p><p>RDNA 4's memory subsystem enhancements are exciting and improve performance across a variety of workloads compared to RDNA 3. AMD specifically calls out benefits in raytracing workloads, where traversal and result handling may occur simultaneously on the same WGP. Traversal involves pointer chasing, while result handling might involve more cache friendly data lookups and texture sampling. Breaking cross-wave memory dependencies would prevent different memory access patterns in those tasks from delaying each other.</p><p>Likely this wasn't an issue with rasterization because waves assigned to a WGP probably work on pixels in close proximity. Those waves may sample the same textures, and even take samples in close proximity to each other within the same texture. If one wave misses in cache, the others likely do too.</p><p><span>Breaking up </span><code>vmcnt</code><span> and </span><code>lgmkcnt</code><span> probably helps raytracing too. Raytracing shaders make BVH intersection and LDS stack management requests during traversal. Then they might sample textures or access global memory buffers during result handling. Giving the compiler flexibility to interleave those request types and still wait on a specific request is a good thing.</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fef664cd8-175d-4819-9870-42967d928aef_8280x5512.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fef664cd8-175d-4819-9870-42967d928aef_8280x5512.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fef664cd8-175d-4819-9870-42967d928aef_8280x5512.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fef664cd8-175d-4819-9870-42967d928aef_8280x5512.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fef664cd8-175d-4819-9870-42967d928aef_8280x5512.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fef664cd8-175d-4819-9870-42967d928aef_8280x5512.jpeg" width="1456" height="969" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/ef664cd8-175d-4819-9870-42967d928aef_8280x5512.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:969,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:8099343,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://chipsandcheese.com/i/159664006?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fef664cd8-175d-4819-9870-42967d928aef_8280x5512.jpeg&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fef664cd8-175d-4819-9870-42967d928aef_8280x5512.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fef664cd8-175d-4819-9870-42967d928aef_8280x5512.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fef664cd8-175d-4819-9870-42967d928aef_8280x5512.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fef664cd8-175d-4819-9870-42967d928aef_8280x5512.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption>Radeon logo on the RX 9070 graciously provided by AMD for review</figcaption></figure></div><p>But RDNA 4's scheme for handling memory dependencies isn't fundamentally different from that of GCN many years ago. While the implementation details differ, RDNA 4, GCN, and Intel and Nvidia's GPUs can all absorb cache misses without immediately stalling a thread. Each GPU maker has improved their ability to do so, whether it's with more scoreboard tokens or more counters. RDNA 4 indeed can do Cortex A510 style nonblocking loads, but it's far from a new feature in the world of GPUs.</p><p>Resolving false cross-wave dependencies isn't new either. Nvidia had "out-of-order" cross-wave memory access handling in Turing, and presumably their newer architectures too. Intel had the same at least as far back as Gen 9 (Skylake) graphics. Therefore RDNA 4's "out-of-order" memory subsystem enhancements are best seen as generational tweaks, rather than new game changing techniques. </p><p>Still, AMD's engineers deserve credit for making them happen. RDNA 4’s  arguably makes the most significant change to AMD’s GPU memory subsystem since RDNA launched in 2019. I'm glad to see the company continue to improve their GPU architecture and make it better suited to emerging workloads like raytracing.</p></div></div>]]></description>

        <div dir="false" data-test-bidi=""><p>This is one of the best apps I’ve used to study notes. I only sing but I’m trying to learn notes and this is fantastic. You will learn how to use a piano in the process, which is key to making sure you learn to sing in tune. My only objection is that the lessons do NOT include training on sharps &amp; flats. I was hoping the in app purchase for additional lessons (happens after you’ve learned quite a lot, no worries) included this, and there’s no info given on what these lessons contain, only that “more will be added”. The practice mode thankfully does allow you to train flats but not in an organized, piece by piece way like the lessons do. But unfortunately you cannot see flats and sharps labeled on the keys like the other ones.</p><p>I have to knock off a star… sharps and flats are a big part of the music that I do and so this app didn’t teach me everything I wanted to know.</p></div>

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi="">This app and the ease of use has introduced a whole new world to me.<br>I never thought I would understand how to play a piano.. My life has been filled with homelessness and bad fortune, so I learned a long time ago that music had a medicinal effect on me.. A personal escape of sorts... I always wanted to understand how to make beautiful sounds with a piano, but I don’t learn so well.. This app made it easy for me to understand the keyboard layout and knowing what each note is from each key.. It seems like this app will help me learn how to write songs and that will make life so happy for me.<br>I’m not trying to be sad here.. I just wanted to explain how much this app can help someone like me. I can’t afford the full version but this version, I appreciate none the less.<br>“Music may have to save the world someday”.</p>

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi="">I rarely write reviews, but this app is so beyond amazing I’ll try my best to share my thoughts. First of all, everything is absolutely FREE, NO premium that you have to buy to basically unlock everything, I feel the developers of this app were truly trying to help instead of take all of your money. Secondly, I’ve had this app for one day and I’ve already learned more than I did searching for weeks for a good app that’s free. I’ve started to be able to play simple songs on my keyboard, like Jingle Bells, completely looking at the sheet music. I almost gave up on trying to learn how to read sheet music, but this has given me a great start. Sorry for bad grammar.</p>

          Als Prinzipal bezeichnet wird aber nur das tiefste Register eines Werks.
          Alle höheren Lagen nennt man Oktave.</p>
