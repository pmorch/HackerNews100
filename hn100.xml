<p><span data-contrast="auto">This first wave of Copilot+ PCs is just the beginning. Over the past year, we have seen an incredible pace of innovation of AI in the cloud with Copilot allowing us to do things that we never dreamed possible. Now, we begin a new chapter with AI innovation on the device. We have completely reimagined the entirety of the PC – from silicon to the operating system, the application layer to the cloud </span><span data-contrast="auto">–</span><span data-contrast="auto"> with AI at the center, marking the most significant change to the Window platform in decades.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}">&nbsp;</span></p>

<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">The fastest, most secure Windows PCs ever built</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}">&nbsp;</span></h3>
<p>We introduced an all-new system architecture to bring the power of the CPU, GPU, and now a new high performance Neural Processing Unit (NPU) together. Connected to and enhanced by the large language models (LLMs) running in our Azure Cloud in concert with small language models (SLMs), Copilot+ PCs can now achieve a level of performance never seen before. They are up to 20x more powerful<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a> and up to 100x as efficient<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a> for running AI workloads and deliver industry-leading AI acceleration. They outperform Apple’s MacBook Air 15” by up to 58% in sustained multithreaded performance<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a>, all while delivering all-day battery life.&nbsp; With incredible efficiency, Copilot+ PCs can deliver up to 22 hours of local video playback or 15 hours of web browsing on a single charge.<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a> That is up to 20% more battery in local video playback than the MacBook Air 15”.<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a></p>
<p>Windows now has the best implementation of apps on the fastest chip, starting with Qualcomm. We now offer more native Arm64 experiences than ever before, including our fastest implementation of Microsoft 365 apps like Teams, PowerPoint, Outlook, Word, Excel, OneDrive and OneNote. Chrome, Spotify, Zoom, WhatsApp, Blender, Affinity Suite, DaVinci Resolve and many more now run​ natively on Arm to give you great performance with additional apps, like Slack, releasing later this year. In fact, 87% of the total app minutes people spend in apps today have native Arm versions.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[6]</a> With a powerful new emulator, Prism, your apps run great, whether native or emulated.</p>
<p>Every Copilot+ PC comes secured out of the box. The Microsoft Pluton Security processor will be enabled by default on all Copilot+ PCs and we have introduced a number of new features, updates and defaults to Windows 11 that make it easy for users to stay secure. And, we’ve built in personalized privacy controls to help you protect what’s important to you. You can read more about how we are making Windows more secure <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/?p=134243">here</a>.</p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">Entirely new, powerful AI experiences&nbsp;</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}">&nbsp;</span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Copilot+ PCs leverage powerful processors and multiple state-of-the-art AI models, including several of Microsoft’s world-class SLMs, to unlock a new set of experiences you can run locally, directly on the device. This removes previous limitations on things like latency, cost and even privacy to help you be more productive, creative and communicate more effectively.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">Recall instantly</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}">&nbsp;</span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">We set out to solve one of the most frustrating problems we encounter daily – finding something we know we have seen before on our PC. Today, we must remember what file folder it was stored in, what website it was on, or scroll through hundreds of emails trying to find it.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Now with Recall, you can access virtually what you have seen or done on your PC in a way that feels like having photographic memory. Copilot+ PCs organize information like we do – based on relationships and associations unique to each of our individual experiences. This helps you remember things you may have forgotten so you can find what you’re looking for quickly and intuitively by simply using the cues you remember. <a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[7]</a></p>
<p>You can scroll across time to find the content you need in your timeline across any application, website, document, or more. Interact intuitively using snapshots with screenray to help you take the next step using suggested actions based on object recognition. And get back to where you were, whether to a specific email in Outlook or the right chat in Teams.</p>
<p>Recall leverages your personal semantic index, built and stored entirely on your device. Your snapshots are yours; they stay locally on your PC. You can delete individual snapshots, adjust and delete ranges of time in Settings, or pause at any point right from the icon in the System Tray on your Taskbar. You can also filter apps and websites from ever being saved. You are always in control with privacy you can trust.</p>

<p><strong>Cocreate with AI-powered image creation and editing, built into Windows</strong></p>
<p>Since the launch of Image Creator, almost 10 billion images have been generated, helping more people bring their ideas to life easily by using natural language to describe what they want to create. Yet, today’s cloud offerings may limit the number of images you can create, keep you waiting while the artwork processes or even present privacy concerns. By using the Neural Processing Units (NPUs) and powerful local small language models, we are bringing innovative new experiences to your favorite creative applications like Paint and Photos.</p>
<p>Combine your ink strokes with text prompts to generate new images in nearly real time with Cocreator. As you iterate, so does the artwork, helping you more easily refine, edit and evolve your ideas. Powerful diffusion-based algorithms optimize for the highest quality output over minimum steps to make it feel like you are creating alongside AI. Use the creativity slider to choose from a range of artwork from more literal to more expressive. Once you select your artwork, you can continue iterating on top of it, helping you express your ideas, regardless of your creative skills.</p>

<p>Take photo editing and image creation to the next level. With Restyle Image, you can reimagine your personal photos with a new style combining image generation and photo editing in Photos. Use a pre-set style like Cyberpunk or Claymation to change the background, foreground or full picture to create an entirely new image. Or jumpstart your next creative project and get visual inspiration with Image Creator in Photos. On Copilot+ PCs you can generate endless images for free, fast, with the ability to fine tune images to your liking and to save your favorites to collections.</p>
<h3><strong>Innovative AI experiences from the creative apps you love</strong></h3>
<p>We are also partnering with some of the biggest and most-loved applications on the planet to leverage the power of the NPU to deliver new innovative AI experiences.</p>
<h3><strong>Adobe</strong></h3>
<p>Together with Adobe, we are thrilled to announce Adobe’s flagship apps are coming to Copilot+ PCs, including Photoshop, Lightroom and Express – available today. Illustrator, Premiere Pro and more are coming this summer. And we’re continuing to partner to optimize AI in these apps for the NPU. For Adobe Creative Cloud customers, they will benefit from the full performance advantages of Copilot+ PCs to express their creativity faster than ever before.</p>

      Of the 51 patients completing the study, 26 (51%) were treated with duct tape, and 25 (49%) were treated with cryotherapy. Twenty-two patients (85%) in the duct tape arm vs 15 patients (60%) enrolled in the cryotherapy arm had complete resolution of their warts (P =.05 by chi(2) analysis). The majority of warts that responded to either therapy did so within the first month of treatment.

        <strong>
          Conclusion:
        </strong>
      
      Duct tape occlusion therapy was significantly more effective than cryotherapy for treatment of the common wart.

    <h3>
        TL;DR    </h3>
<div>
    <p>This post details <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/security/advisories/mfsa2024-21/#CVE-2024-4367" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2024-4367</a>, a vulnerability in PDF.js found by Codean Labs. PDF.js is a JavaScript-based PDF viewer maintained by Mozilla. This bug allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code as soon as a malicious PDF file is opened. This affects <strong>all Firefox users</strong> (&lt;126) because PDF.js is used by Firefox to show PDF files, but also seriously impacts <strong>many web- and Electron-based applications</strong> that (indirectly) use PDF.js for preview functionality.</p>
<p><em>If you are a developer of a JavaScript/Typescript-based application that handles PDF files in any way, we recommend checking that you are not (indirectly) using a version a vulnerable version of PDF.js. See the end of this post for mitigation details.</em></p>
</div>

    <h2>
        Introduction    </h2>
<div>
    <p>There are two common use-cases for PDF.js. First, it is Firefox’s built-in PDF viewer. If you use Firefox and you’ve ever downloaded or browsed to a PDF file you’ll have seen it in action. Second, it is bundled into a Node module called <code>pdfjs-dist</code>, with ~2.7 million weekly downloads according to NPM. In this form, websites can use it to provide embedded PDF preview functionality. This is used by everything from Git-hosting platforms to note-taking applications. The one you’re thinking of now is likely using PDF.js.</p>
<p>The PDF format is famously complex. With support for various media types, complicated font rendering and even rudimentary scripting, PDF readers are a common target for vulnerability researchers. With such a large amount of parsing logic, there are bound to be some mistakes, and PDF.js is no exception to this. What makes it unique however is that it is written in JavaScript as opposed to C or C++. This means that there is no opportunity for memory corruption problems, but as we will see it comes with its own set of risks.</p>
</div>

    <h2>
        Glyph rendering    </h2>
<div>
    <p>You might be surprised to hear that this bug is not related to the PDF format’s (JavaScript!) scripting functionality. Instead, it is an oversight in a specific part of the font rendering code.</p>
<p>Fonts in PDFs can come in several different formats, some of them more obscure than others (at least for us). For modern formats like TrueType, PDF.js defers mostly to the browser’s own font renderer. In other cases, it has to manually turn <em>glyph</em> (i.e., character) descriptions into curves on the page. To optimize this for performance, a <em>path generator</em> function is pre-compiled for every glyph. If supported, this is done by making a JavaScript <code>Function</code> object with a body (<code>jsBuf</code>) containing the instructions that make up the path:</p>
<pre><code>
// If we can, compile cmds into JS for MAXIMUM SPEED...
if (this.isEvalSupported &amp;&amp; FeatureTest.isEvalSupported) {
  const jsBuf = [];
  for (const current of cmds) {
    const args = current.args !== undefined ? current.args.join(",") : "";
    jsBuf.push("c.", current.cmd, "(", args, ");\n");
  }
  // eslint-disable-next-line no-new-func
  console.log(jsBuf.join(""));
  return (this.compiledGlyphs[character] = new Function(
    "c",
    "size",
    jsBuf.join("")
  ));
}
</code></pre>
<p>From an attacker perspective this is really interesting: if we can somehow control these <code>cmds</code> going into the <code>Function</code> body and insert our own code, it would be executed as soon as such a glyph is rendered.</p>
<p>Well, let’s look at how this list of commands is generated. Following the logic back to the <code>CompiledFont</code> class we find the method <code>compileGlyph(...)</code>. This method initializes the <code>cmds</code> array with a few general commands (<code>save</code>, <code>transform</code>, <code>scale</code> and <code>restore</code>), and defers to a <code>compileGlyphImpl(...)</code> method to fill in the actual rendering commands:</p>
<pre><code>
  compileGlyph(code, glyphId) {
    if (!code || code.length === 0 || code[0] === 14) {
      return NOOP;
    }

    let fontMatrix = this.fontMatrix;
    ...

    const cmds = [
      { cmd: "save" },
      { cmd: "transform", args: fontMatrix.slice() },
      { cmd: "scale", args: ["size", "-size"] },
    ];
    this.compileGlyphImpl(code, cmds, glyphId);

    cmds.push({ cmd: "restore" });

    return cmds;
  }
</code></pre>
<p>If we instrument the PDF.js code to log generated <code>Function</code> objects, we see that the generated code indeed contains those commands:</p>
<pre><code>
c.save();
c.transform(0.001,0,0,0.001,0,0);
c.scale(size,-size);
c.moveTo(0,0);
c.restore();
</code></pre>
<p>At this point we could audit the font parsing code and the various commands and arguments that can be produced by glyphs, like <code>quadraticCurveTo</code> and <code>bezierCurveTo</code>, but all of this seems pretty innocent with no ability to control anything other than numbers. What turns out to be much more interesting however is the <code>transform</code> command we saw above:</p>
<pre><code>
{ cmd: "transform", args: fontMatrix.slice() },
</code></pre>
<p>This <code>fontMatrix</code> array is copied (with <code>.slice()</code>) and inserted into the body of the <code>Function</code> object, joined by commas. The code clearly assumes that it is a numeric array, but is that always the case? Any string inside this array would be inserted literally, without any quotes surrounding it. Hence, that would break the JavaScript syntax at best, and give arbitrary code execution at worst. But can we even control the contents of <code>fontMatrix</code> to that degree?</p>
</div>

    <h2>
        Enter the FontMatrix    </h2>
<div>
    <p>The value of <code>fontMatrix</code> defaults to <code>[0.001, 0, 0, 0.001, 0, 0]</code>, but is often set to a custom matrix by a font itself, i.e., in its own embedded metadata. How this is done exactly differs per font format. Here’s the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PostScript_fonts" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Type1</a> parser for example:</p>
<pre><code>
  extractFontHeader(properties) {
    let token;
    while ((token = this.getToken()) !== null) {
      if (token !== "/") {
        continue;
      }
      token = this.getToken();
      switch (token) {
        case "FontMatrix":
          const matrix = this.readNumberArray();
          properties.fontMatrix = matrix;
          break;
        ...
      }
      ...
    }
    ...
  }
</code></pre>
<p>This is not very interesting for us. Even though Type1 fonts technically contain arbitrary Postscript code in their header, no sane PDF reader supports this fully and most just try to read predefined key-value pairs with expected types. In this case, PDF.js just reads a number array when it encounters a <code>FontMatrix</code> key. It appears that the <code>CFF</code> parser — used for several other font formats — is similar in this regard. All in all, it looks like we are indeed limited to numbers.</p>
<p>However, it turns out that there is more than one potential origin of this matrix. Apparently, it is also possible to specify a custom <code>FontMatrix</code> value outside of a font, namely in a metadata object in the PDF! Looking carefully at the <code>PartialEvaluator.translateFont(...)</code> method, we see that it loads various attributes from PDF dictionaries associated with the font, one of them being the <code>fontMatrix</code>:</p>
<pre><code>
    const properties = {
      type,
      name: fontName.name,
      subtype,
      file: fontFile,
      ...
      fontMatrix: dict.getArray("FontMatrix") || FONT_IDENTITY_MATRIX,
      ...
      bbox: descriptor.getArray("FontBBox") || dict.getArray("FontBBox"),
      ascent: descriptor.get("Ascent"),
      descent: descriptor.get("Descent"),
      xHeight: descriptor.get("XHeight") || 0,
      capHeight: descriptor.get("CapHeight") || 0,
      flags: descriptor.get("Flags"),
      italicAngle: descriptor.get("ItalicAngle") || 0,
      ...
    };
</code></pre>
<p>In the PDF format, font definitions consists of several objects. The <code>Font</code>, its <code>FontDescriptor</code> and the actual <code>FontFile</code>. For example, here represented by objects 1, 2 and 3:</p>
<pre><code>
1 0 obj
&lt;&lt;
  /Type /Font
  /Subtype /Type1
  /FontDescriptor 2 0 R
  /BaseFont /FooBarFont
&gt;&gt;
endobj

2 0 obj
&lt;&lt;
  /Type /FontDescriptor
  /FontName /FooBarFont
  /FontFile 3 0 R
  /ItalicAngle 0
  /Flags 4
&gt;&gt;
endobj

3 0 obj
&lt;&lt;
  /Length 100
&gt;&gt;
... (actual binary font data) ...
endobj
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>dict</code> referenced by the code above refers to the <code>Font</code> object. Hence, we should be able to define a custom <code>FontMatrix</code> array like this:</p>
<pre><code>
1 0 obj
&lt;&lt;
  /Type /Font
  /Subtype /Type1
  /FontDescriptor 2 0 R
  /BaseFont /FooBarFont
  /FontMatrix [1 2 3 4 5 6]   % &lt;-----
&gt;&gt;
endobj
</code></pre>
<p>When attempting to do this it initially looks like this doesn’t work, as the <code>transform</code> operations in generated <code>Function</code> bodies still use the default matrix. However, this happens because the font file itself is overwriting the value. Luckily, when using a Type1 font without an internal <code>FontMatrix</code> definition, the PDF-specified value <em>is</em> authoritative as the <code>fontMatrix</code> value is not overwritten.</p>
<p>Now that we can control this array from a PDF object we have all the flexibility we want, as PDF supports more than just number-type primitives. Let’s try inserting a string-type value instead of a number (in PDF, strings are delimited by parentheses):</p>
<pre><code>
/FontMatrix [1 2 3 4 5 (foobar)]
</code></pre>
<p>And indeed, it is plainly inserted into the <code>Function</code> body!</p>
<pre><code>
c.save();
c.transform(1,2,3,4,5,foobar);
c.scale(size,-size);
c.moveTo(0,0);
c.restore();
</code></pre>
</div>

    <h2>
        Exploitation and impact    </h2>
<div>
    <p>Inserting arbitrary JavaScript code is now only a matter of juggling the syntax properly. Here’s a classical example triggering an alert, by first closing the <code>c.transform(...)</code> function, and making use of the trailing parenthesis:</p>
<pre><code>
/FontMatrix [1 2 3 4 5 (0\); alert\('foobar')]
</code></pre>
<p>The result is exactly as expected:</p>
<div><p><a href="https://codeanlabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/pdfjs_alert_foobar.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://codeanlabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/pdfjs_alert_foobar.png" alt="Exploitation of CVE-2024-4367" width="1127" height="683"></a></p><p>Exploitation of CVE-2024-4367</p></div>
<p>You can find a proof-of-concept PDF file <a href="https://codeanlabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/CVE-2024-4367.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>. It is made to be easy to adapt using a regular text editor. To demonstrate the context in which the JavaScript is running, the alert will show you the value of <code>window.origin</code>. Interestingly enough, this is not the <code>file://</code> path you see in the URL bar (if you’ve downloaded the file). Instead, PDF.js runs under the origin <code>resource://pdf.js</code>. This prevents access to local files, but it is slightly more privileged in other aspects. For example, it is possible to invoke a file download (through a dialog), even to “download” arbitrary <code>file://</code> URLs. Additionally, the real path of the opened PDF file is stored in <code>window.PDFViewerApplication.url</code>, allowing an attacker to spy on people opening a PDF file, learning not just when they open the file and what they’re doing with it, but also where the file is located on their machine.</p>
<p>In applications that embed PDF.js, the impact is potentially even worse. If no mitigations are in place (see below), this essentially gives an attacker an <a href="https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/xss/">XSS</a> primitive on the domain which includes the PDF viewer. Depending on the application this can lead to data leaks, malicious actions being performed in the name of a victim, or even a full account take-over. On Electron apps that do not properly sandbox JavaScript code, this vulnerability even leads to native code execution (!). <strong>We found this to be the case for at least one popular Electron app</strong>.</p>
</div>

    <h2>
        Mitigation    </h2>
<div>
    <p>At Codean Labs we realize it is difficult to keep track of dependencies like this and their associated risks. It is our pleasure to take this burden from you.

<p>The best mitigation against this vulnerability is to update PDF.js to version 4.2.67 or higher. Most wrapper libraries like <code>react-pdf</code> <a href="https://github.com/wojtekmaj/react-pdf/discussions/1786" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have also released</a> patched versions. Because some higher level PDF-related libraries statically embed PDF.js, we recommend recursively checking your <code>node_modules</code> folder for files called <code>pdf.js</code> to be sure. Headless use-cases of PDF.js (e.g., on the server-side to obtain statistics and data from PDFs) seem not to be affected, but we didn’t thoroughly test this. It is also advised to update.</p>
<p>Additionally, a simple workaround is to set the PDF.js setting <code>isEvalSupported</code> to <code>false</code>. This will disable the vulnerable code-path. If you have a strict <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP" target="_blank" rel="noopener">content-security policy</a> (disabling the use of <code>eval</code> and the <code>Function</code> constructor), the vulnerability is also not reachable.</p>

<h2 id="an-intro-to-intros">An intro to intros</h2>
<p>The demoscene is about producing cool real time works (as in “runs on your computer”) called <em>demos</em>. Some demos are really small, say 64 kilobytes or less, and these are called <em>intros</em>. The name comes from “crack intros”. So an intro is just a demo that’s small.</p>
<p>I’ve noticed many people have interest in demoscene productions but have no idea how they are actually made. This is a braindump/post-mortem of our recent 64k intro <em>Guberniya</em> and I hope that it will be interesting to newcomers and seasoned veterans alike. This article touches basically all techniques used in the demo and should give you an idea what goes into making one. I refer to people with their nick names in this article because that’s what <em>sceners</em> do.</p>

<p>Demos are usually released at a <em>demo party</em> where the audience watches demos submitted to a competition and then votes for the winner. Releasing at a party is a great way to get motivated since you have a hard deadline and an eager audience. In our case it was <a href="https://2017.revision-party.net/">Revision 2017</a>, a big traditional demo party during the Easter weekend. You can view <a href="http://tf.weimarnetz.de/revision2017/">some photos</a> to get an idea what the event is like.</p>

</div>
<p>We started working on the demo early in January and released it on the Easter weekend in April during the party. You can watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jv0woZONvc">a recording of the whole competition</a> online if you wish :)</p>
<p>We were a team of six: cce (me), <a href="https://twitter.com/martin_b_radev">varko</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/nnnnoby">noby</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/nicebranch">branch</a>, msqrt, and goatman.</p>
<h2 id="design-influences">Design &amp; influences</h2>
<p>The song was done pretty early on, so I tried to design things around it. It was clear we needed something big and cinematic with memorable set pieces.</p>
<p>My original visual ideas centered around wires and their usage. I really liked Viktor Antonov’s designs and my first sketches were pretty much a rip-off of Half-Life 2:</p>

</div>
<p>The similarities are quite obvious. In the landscape scenes I was also trying to capture the mood of <a href="http://anthonyscime.deviantart.com/art/Eldion-Passageway-304528786">Eldion Passageway</a> by Anthony Scimes.</p>
<p>The landscape was inspired by <a href="https://vimeo.com/189904045">this nice video of Iceland</a> and also Koyaanisqatsi, I guess. I also had big plans for the story that manifested itself as a storyboard:</p>

For example the brutalist architecture was dropped. <a href="https://www.lofibucket.com/articles/img/64k/story12.jpg">The full storyboard.</a></p>
</div>
<p>If I’d do this again I’d just settle with a timeline with a couple of photos that set the mood. It’s less work and leaves more room for imagination. But at least drawing it forced me to organize my thoughts.</p>
<h3 id="the-ship">The Ship</h3>
<p>The spaceship was designed by <a href="https://twitter.com/nnnnoby">noby</a>. It is a combination of multiple Mandelbox fractals intersected with geometric primitives. The ship’s design was left a bit incomplete, but we felt it shouldn’t be further tampered with in the final version.</p>
<div>
<p><img src="https://www.lofibucket.com/articles/img/64k/ship.jpg" alt="The spaceship is a raymarched distance field, just like everything else."></p><p>The spaceship is a raymarched distance field, just like everything else.</p>
</div>
<p>We had also another ship shader that didn’t get used. Now that I look at the design it’s also very cool and it’s a shame it didn’t find use in the intro.</p>

<h2 id="implementation">Implementation</h2>
<p>We started with a codebase built for our earlier intro <a href="http://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=67435">Pheromone</a> (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTZs8ppUtSQ">YouTube</a>). It had basic windowing and OpenGL boilerplate along with file system utility that packed files from a data directory to executable with <code>bin2h</code>.</p>
<h3 id="the-workflow">The workflow</h3>
<p>We used Visual Studio 2013 to compile the project since it wouldn’t compile on VS2015. Our standard library replacement didn’t work well with the updated compiler and produced amusing errors like this:</p>
<div>
<p><img src="https://www.lofibucket.com/articles/img/64k/linkkeri.png" alt="Visual Studio 2015 didn’t play well with our codebase."></p><p>Visual Studio 2015 didn’t play well with our codebase.</p>
</div>
<p>For some reason we stuck with VS2015 as an editor though and just compiled the project using the v120 platform toolkit.</p>
<div>
<p><img src="https://www.lofibucket.com/articles/img/64k/vs.jpg" alt="I made most of my work with the demo like this: shaders open in one window and the end result with console output in others. Full size."></p><p>I made most of my work with the demo like this: shaders open in one window and the end result with console output in others. <a href="https://www.lofibucket.com/articles/img/64k/vs.png">Full size.</a></p>
</div>
<p>We had a simple global keyboard hook that reloaded all shaders when CTRL+S key combination was detected:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>// Listen to CTRL+S.</span>
<span>if</span> (GetAsyncKeyState(VK_CONTROL) &amp;&amp; GetAsyncKeyState('S'))
{
    <span>// Wait for a while to let the file system finish the file write.</span>
    <span>if</span> (system_get_millis() - last_load &gt; <span>200</span>) {
        Sleep(<span>100</span>);
        reloadShaders();
    }
    last_load = system_get_millis();
}</code></pre></div>
<p>This worked really well and made live editing shaders much more fun. No need to have file system hooks or anything.</p>
<h3 id="gnu-rocket">GNU Rocket</h3>
<p>For animation and direction we used a <a href="https://github.com/rocket/rocket">GNU Rocket</a> fork <a href="https://github.com/edoreshef/ground-control">Ground Control</a>. Rocket is a program for editing animation curves and it connects to the demo via a TCP socket. The keyframes are sent over when requested by the demo. It’s very convenient because you can edit and recompile the demo while keeping the editor open without losing the sync position. For the final release the keyframes are exported to a binary format. It has some <a href="https://github.com/rocket/rocket/issues/63">annoying limitations</a> though.</p>
<h3 id="the-tool">The Tool</h3>
<video width="800" src="https://www.lofibucket.com/articles/img/64k/tool.mp4" controls="control">
</video>
<p><em>Moving the viewpoint with mouse and keyboard is very handy for picking camera angles. Even a simple GUI helps a lot when tweaking values.</em></p>
<p>We didn’t have a demotool <a href="http://peisik.untergrund.net/engines/">unlike some people</a> so we had to build it as we went a long. The excellent <a href="https://github.com/ocornut/imgui">dear imgui</a> library allowed us to easily add features as we needed them.</p>
<p>For example adding some sliders to control some bloom parameters is as simple as adding these lines inside the rendering loop (<em>not</em> to separate GUI code):</p>
<div><pre><code>    imgui::Begin(<span>"Postprocessing"</span>);
    imgui::SliderFloat(<span>"Bloom blur"</span>, &amp;postproc_bloom_blur_steps, <span>1</span>, <span>5</span>);
    imgui::SliderFloat(<span>"Luminance"</span>, &amp;postproc_luminance, <span>0.0</span>, <span>1.0</span>, <span>"</span><span>%.3f</span><span>"</span>, <span>1.0</span>);
    imgui::SliderFloat(<span>"Threshold"</span>, &amp;postproc_threshold, <span>0.0</span>, <span>1.0</span>, <span>"</span><span>%.3f</span><span>"</span>, <span>3.0</span>);
    imgui::End();</code></pre></div>
<p>The end result:</p>
<div>
<p><img src="https://www.lofibucket.com/articles/img/64k/imgui.png" alt="These sliders were easy to add."></p><p>These sliders were easy to add.</p>
</div>
<p>The camera position can be saved by pressing <code>F6</code> to a <code>.cpp</code> file, so the next time the code is compiled it will be included. This avoids the need for a separate data format and the related serialization code, but this solution can also get pretty messy.</p>
<h3 id="making-small-binaries">Making small binaries</h3>
<p>The key to small executables is scrapping the default standard library and compressing the compiled binary. We used Mike_V’s <a href="https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/15156/Tiny-C-Runtime-Library">Tiny C Runtime Library</a> as a base for our own library implementation.</p>
<p>The binaries are compressed with <a href="http://www.farbrausch.de/~fg/kkrunchy/">kkrunchy</a>, which is a tool made for exactly this purpose. It operates on standalone executables so you can write your demo in C++, Rust, Object Pascal or whatever. To be honest, size wasn’t really a problem for us. We didn’t store much binary data like images so we had plenty of room to play with. We didn’t even remove comments from shaders!</p>
<h3 id="floating-points">Floating points</h3>
<p>Floating point code caused some headaches by producing calls to nonexistent standard library functions. Most of these were eliminated by disabling SSE vectorization with the <code>/arch:IA32</code> compiler switch and removing calls to <code>ftol</code> with the <code>/QIfst</code> flag that generates code that doesn’t save the FPU truncation mode flags. This is not a problem because you can set the floating point truncation mode at the start of your program with this snippet courtesy of <a href="http://www.musicdsp.org/showone.php?id=246">Peter Schoffhauzer</a>:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>// set rounding mode to truncate</span>
<span>//  from http://www.musicdsp.org/showone.php?id=246</span>
<span>static</span> <span>short</span> control_word;
<span>static</span> <span>short</span> control_word2;

<span>inline</span> <span>void</span> SetFloatingPointRoundingToTruncate()
{
    __asm
    {
        fstcw   control_word                <span>// store fpu control word</span>
        mov     dx, word ptr [control_word]
        or      dx, <span>0x0C00</span>                  <span>// rounding: truncate</span>
        mov     control_word2, dx
        fldcw   control_word2               <span>// load modfied control word</span>
    }
}</code></pre></div>
<p>You can read more about these things at <a href="http://www.benshoof.org/blog/minicrt/">benshoof.org</a>.</p>
<h4 id="pow">POW</h4>
<p>Calling <code>pow</code> still generated a call to <code>__CIpow</code> intrinsic function that didn’t exist. I couldn’t figure out its signature on my own but I found an implementation in <a href="https://github.com/wine-mirror/wine/blob/77887b474e60d21157cc1c59784b2b4c6c42dedf/dlls/ntdll/misc.c#L218">Wine’s <code>ntdll.dll</code></a> that revealed that it expects two double precision floats in registers. Now it was possible to make a wrapper that calls our own <code>pow</code> implementation:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>double</span> __cdecl _CIpow(<span>void</span>) {
    <span>// Load the values from registers to local variables.</span>
    <span>double</span> b, p;
    __asm {
        fstp qword ptr p
        fstp qword ptr b
    }

    <span>// Implementation: http://www.mindspring.com/~pfilandr/C/fs_math/fs_math.c</span>
    <span>return</span> fs_pow(b, p);
}</code></pre></div>
<p>If you know a nicer way to fix this, please let me know.</p>
<h3 id="winapi">WinAPI</h3>
<p>When you can’t depend on SDL or similar you need to use plain WinAPI to do the necessary plumbing to get a window on screen. If you are suffering through this, these might prove helpful:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://gist.github.com/seece/1f67da14d69b9c8a75a7e6839abf8e72">WinAPI window creation example</a></li>
<li><a href="https://gist.github.com/seece/9f5f3069130c4fe642f4fd5e7375816a">OpenGL initialization example</a>, requires <a href="https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenGL/api/GL/glext.h">glext.h</a> and <a href="https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenGL/api/GL/wglext.h">wglext.h</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Note that we only load the function pointers for OpenGL functions that are actually used in the production in the latter example. It might be a good idea to automate this. The functions need to be queried with string identifiers that get stored in the executable, so loading as few functions as possible saves space. <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/0zza0de8.aspx">Whole Program Optimization</a> might eliminate all unreferenced string literals but we couldn’t use it because of <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/2945619">a problem with <code>memcpy</code></a>.</p>
<h3 id="rendering-techniques">Rendering techniques</h3>
<p>Rendering is mostly raymarching and we used the <a href="http://mercury.sexy/hg_sdf/">hg_sdf</a> library for convenience. <a href="http://iquilezles.org/www/">Íñigo Quílez</a> (from now on called just iq) has written lots about this and many of the techniques. If you’ve ever visited <a href="https://www.shadertoy.com/">ShaderToy</a> you should be familiar with this already.</p>
<p>Additionally, we had the raymarcher output a depth buffer value so we could intersect signed distance fields with rasterized geometry and also apply post-processing effects.</p>
<h3 id="shading">Shading</h3>
<p>We use standard Unreal Engine 4 shading (<a href="http://blog.selfshadow.com/publications/s2013-shading-course/karis/s2013_pbs_epic_notes_v2.pdf">here’s a big pdf that explains it</a>) with a GGX lobe. It isn’t very visible but makes a difference in highlights. Early on our plan was to have an unified lighting pipeline for both raymarched and rasterized shapes. The idea was to use deferred rendering and shadow maps, but this didn’t work at all.</p>
<div>
<p><img src="https://www.lofibucket.com/articles/img/64k/constant_shadows_thumb.jpg" alt="An early experiment with shadow mapping. Note how both the towers and the wires cast a shadow on the raymarched terrain and also intersect correctly. Full size."></p><p>An early experiment with shadow mapping. Note how both the towers and the wires cast a shadow on the raymarched terrain and also intersect correctly. <a href="https://www.lofibucket.com/articles/img/64k/constant_shadows.jpg">Full size.</a></p>
</div>
<p>Rendering huge terrains with shadow maps is super hard to get right because of the wildly varying screen-to-shadow-map-texel ratio and other accuracy problems. I wasn’t really in the mood to start experimenting with <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ee416307(v=vs.85).aspx">cascaded shadow maps</a> either. Also, raymarching the same scene from multiple points of view is <em>slow</em>. So we just decided to scrap the whole unified lighting thing. This proved to be a huge pain later when were trying to match the lighting of the rasterized wires and raymarched scene geometry.</p>
<h2 id="terrain">Terrain</h2>
<p>The terrain is raymarched <a href="http://www.iquilezles.org/www/articles/morenoise/morenoise.htm">value noise</a> with analytic derivatives.<a href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> The generated derivates are used for shading of course, but also to control ray stepping length to accelerate ray traversal on smooth regions, just like in iq’s examples. If you want to learn more you you can read more about this technique in <a href="http://iquilezles.org/www/articles/terrainmarching/terrainmarching.htm">this old article of his</a> or play around with his <a href="https://www.shadertoy.com/view/4ttSWf">awesome rainforest scene on ShaderToy</a>. The landscape heightmap became much more realistic after msqrt implemented <a href="http://jcgt.org/published/0004/02/01/">exponentially distributed noise</a>.</p>

</div>
<p>The landscape effect is very slow because we do brute force shadows and reflections. The shadows use <a href="http://www.iquilezles.org/www/articles/rmshadows/rmshadows.htm">a soft shadow hack</a> in which the penumbra size is determined by the closest distance encountered during shadow ray traversal. They look <a href="https://www.lofibucket.com/articles/img/64k/shadow.gif">pretty nice in action</a>. We also tried using bisection tracing to speed it up but it produced too many artifacts to be useful. <a href="http://mercury.sexy/">Mercury</a>’s (another demogroup) <a href="http://erleuchtet.org/~cupe/permanent/enhanced_sphere_tracing.pdf">raymarching tricks</a> on the other hand helped us to eke out some extra quality with the same speed.</p>

<p>The sky is built using pretty much the same techniques as described by iq in <em><a href="http://www.iquilezles.org/www/material/function2009/function2009.pdf">behind elevated</a></em>, slide 43. Just some simple functions of the ray direction vector. The sun outputs pretty large values to the framebuffer (&gt;100) so it adds some natural bloom as well.</p>
<h2 id="the-alley-scene">The alley scene</h2>
<p>This is a view that was inspired by <a href="http://www.fanhophotography.com/hong-kong-yesterday.html">Fan Ho’s</a> photography. Our post-processing effects really make it come together even though the underlying geometry is pretty simple.</p>

<h2 id="modelling-with-distance-fields">Modelling with distance fields</h2>
<p>The B-52 bombers are a good example of modelling with signed distance fields. They were much simpler in the party version, but we spiced ’em up for the final. They look pretty convincing from afar:</p>

<p>However they are just a bunch of capsules. Admittedly it would’ve been easier to just to make them in some 3D package but we didn’t have any kind of mesh packing pipeline set up so this was faster. Just for reference, this is how the distance field shader looks like: <a href="https://gist.github.com/seece/dcc4e1a6a68f0a911ad05e3be755588b"><code>bomber_sdf.glsl</code></a></p>

<h2 id="post-processing">Post-processing</h2>
<p>The post-processing effects were written by varko. The pipeline is:</p>
<ol>
<li>Apply shading from G-buffer</li>
<li>Calculate depth-of-field</li>
<li>Extract bright parts for bloom</li>
<li>Perform <span><em>N</em></span> separable Gaussian blurs</li>
<li>Calculate fake lens flares &amp; wide headlight flares</li>
<li>Composite all together</li>
<li>Smooth edges with FXAA (<a href="https://github.com/dolphin-emu/dolphin/blob/master/Data/Sys/Shaders/FXAA.glsl">thanks mudlord!</a>)</li>
<li>Color correction</li>
<li>Gamma correction and subtle film grain</li>
</ol>
<p>The lens flares follow pretty much the technique <a href="http://john-chapman-graphics.blogspot.fi/2013/02/pseudo-lens-flare.html">described by John Chapman</a>. They were sometimes hard to work with but in the end still delivered.</p>
<div>
<p><img src="https://www.lofibucket.com/articles/img/64k/bigdof_thumb.jpg" alt="We tried to use the depth of field effect with good taste.

</div>
<p>The depth of field effect (based on <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/DICEStudio/five-rendering-ideas-from-battlefield-3-need-for-speed-the-run">DICE’s technique</a>) is made of three passes. The first one calculates the size of circle of confusion for each pixel and the two other passes apply two rotated box blurs each. We also do iterative refinement (i.e.&nbsp;apply multiple Gaussian blurs) when needed. This implementation worked really well for us and was fun to play with.</p>

<p><em>The depth of field effect in action. The red picture shows the calculated circle of confusion for the DOF blur.</em></p>
<h3 id="color-correction">Color correction</h3>
<p>There is an animated parameter <code>pp_index</code> in Rocket that is used to switch between color correction profiles. Each profile is just a different branch in a big switch statement in the final post-processing pass shader:</p>
<div><pre><code>vec3 cl = getFinalColor();

<span>if</span> (u_GradeId == <span>1</span>) {
    cl.gb *= UV.y * <span>0.7</span>;
    cl = pow(cl, vec3(<span>1.1</span>));
} <span>else</span> <span>if</span> (u_GradeId == <span>2</span>) {
    cl.gb *= UV.y * <span>0.6</span>;
    cl.g = <span>0.0+0.6</span>*smoothstep(-<span>0.05</span>,<span>0.9</span>,cl.g*<span>2.0</span>);
    cl = <span>0.005</span>+pow(cl, vec3(<span>1.2</span>))*<span>1.5</span>;
} <span>/* etc.. */</span></code></pre></div>
<p>It’s very simple but worked well enough.</p>
<h2 id="physics-simulation">Physics simulation</h2>
<p>There are two simulated systems in the demo: the wires and a flock. They were also written by varko.</p>
<h3 id="the-wires">The wires</h3>

<p>The wires are considered a series of springs. They are simulated on the GPU using compute shaders. We run multiple small steps of the simulation due to the instability of the Verlet integration method we use. The compute shader also outputs the wire geometry (a series of triangular prisms) to a vertex buffer. Sadly, the simulation doesn’t work on AMD cards for some reason.</p>
<h3 id="a-flock-of-birds">A flock of birds</h3>
<video width="800" src="https://www.lofibucket.com/articles/img/64k/birds.mp4" controls="control">
</video>
<p><em>The birds give a sense of scale.</em></p>
<p>The flock simulation consists of 512 birds with the first 128 considered the leaders. The leaders move in a <a href="http://prideout.net/blog/?p=63">curl noise</a> pattern and the others follow. I think in real life birds consider the movement of their closest neighbours, but this simplification looks good enough. The flock is rendered as <code>GL_POINT</code>s whose size is modulated to give appearance of flapping wings. This rendering technique was also used in Half-Life 2, I think.</p>
<h2 id="music">Music</h2>
<p>The traditional way to make music for a 64k intro is to have a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_Studio_Technology">VST-instrument plugin</a> that allows a musicians to use their regular tools to compose the music. Farbrausch’s <a href="http://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=15073">V2 synthesizer</a> is a classic example of this approach.</p>
<p>This was a problem. I didn’t want to use any ready made synthesizer but I also knew from earlier failed experiments that making my own virtual instrument would be a lot work. I remember really liking the mood of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sr5Jh5hqfAA">element/gesture 61%</a>, a demo by branch with a <a href="http://hypermammut.sourceforge.net/paulstretch/">paulstretched</a> ambient song. It got me thinking about implementing it in a 4k or 64k size.</p>
<h3 id="paulstretch">Paulstretch</h3>
<p>Paulstretch is a wonderful algorithm for really crazy time stretching. If you haven’t heard about it, you should definitely listen <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fai5s3Zn7b4">what it can make out of Windows 98’s startup sound</a>. Its inner workings are described <a href="http://www.microscopics.co.uk/blog/2010/paulstretch-an-interview-with-paul-nasca/">in this interview with the author</a>, and it’s also open source.</p>
<div>
<p><img src="https://www.lofibucket.com/articles/img/64k/paulstretch.png" alt="Original audio (top) and stretched audio (bottom) done with Audacity’s Paulstretch effect. Note how the frequencies also get smeared across the spectrum (y-axis)."></p><p>Original audio (top) and stretched audio (bottom) done with Audacity’s Paulstretch effect. Note how the frequencies also get smeared across the spectrum (y-axis).</p>
</div>
<p>Basically, as it stretches the input it also scrambles its phases in frequency space so that instead of metallic artifacts you get ethereal echoes. This requires of course a Fourier transform and the original application uses the Kiss FFT library for this. I didn’t want to depend on an external library so in the end I implemented a naive <span>O(<em>N</em><sup>2</sup>)</span> Discrete Fourier Transform on the GPU. This took a long time to get right but in the end it was worth it. The GLSL shader implementation is very compact and runs pretty fast despite its brute-force nature.</p>
<h3 id="a-tracker-module">A tracker module</h3>
<p>Now it was possible to make swathes of ambient drone, given some reasonable input audio to stretch. So I decided to use some tried and tested technology: tracker music. It’s pretty much like MIDI<a href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> but with also samples packed in the file. For example elitegroup’s <a href="http://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=374">kasparov</a> (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svkjjNt7J5Q">YouTube</a>) uses a module with additional reverb added. If it worked 17 years ago, why not now?</p>
<p>I used Windows’ built-in <code>gm.dls</code> MIDI soundbank file (again, a classic trick) to make a song with MilkyTracker in XM module format. This is the format that was used also for many MS-DOS demoscene productions back in the 90s.</p>
<div>
<p><img src="https://www.lofibucket.com/articles/img/64k/milky.png" alt="I used MilkyTracker to compose the original song. The instrument sample data is stripped off the final module file and replaced with offsets and lengths in gm.dls."></p><p>I used MilkyTracker to compose the original song. The instrument sample data is stripped off the final module file and replaced with offsets and lengths in <code>gm.dls</code>.</p>
</div>
<p>The catch with <code>gm.dls</code> is that the instruments, courtesy of Roland in 1996, sound very dated and cheesy. Turns out this is not a problem if you bathe them in tons of reverb! Here’s an example where a short test song is played first and a stretched version follows:</p>
<audio src="https://www.lofibucket.com/articles/img/64k/huojuu.mp3" controls="control">
</audio>
<p>Surprisingly atmospheric, right? So yeah, I made a song imitating Hollywood songwriting and it turned out great. That’s pretty much all that’s going on the music side.</p>

            Hamas-led militants killed around 1,200 people across several locations in southern Israel on October 7 and took some 250 hostages into Gaza.

            Other Israeli officials echoed his sentiments.

            Monday’s announcement is not the first time that the ICC acted in relation to Israel. In March 2021, Khan’s office launched an investigation into possible crimes committed in the Palestinian territories since June 2014 in Gaza and the West Bank.

            Located in The Hague, Netherlands, and created by a treaty called the Rome Statute first brought before the United Nations, the ICC operates independently. Most countries – 124 of them – are parties to the treaty, but there are notable exceptions, including Israel, the US and Russia.

            That means that if the court grants Khan’s application and issues arrest warrants for the five men, any country that is a member would have to arrest them and extradite them to The Hague.

            Under the rules of the court, all signatories of the Rome Statute have the obligation to cooperate fully with its decisions.

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="2.0">Kris Hansen had worked as a chemist at the 3M Corporation for about a year when her boss, an affable senior scientist named Jim Johnson, gave her a strange assignment. 3M had invented Scotch Tape and Post-­it notes; it sold everything from sandpaper to kitchen sponges. But on this day, in 1997, Johnson wanted Hansen to test human blood for chemical contamination.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="3.0">Several of 3M’s most successful products contained man-made compounds called fluorochemicals. In a spray called Scotchgard, fluorochemicals protected leather and fabric from stains. In a coating known as Scotchban, they prevented food packaging from getting soggy. In a soapy foam used by firefighters, they helped extinguish jet-fuel fires. Johnson explained to Hansen that one of the company’s fluorochemicals, PFOS — short for perfluorooctanesulfonic acid — often found its way into the bodies of 3M factory workers. Although he said that they were unharmed, he had recently hired an outside lab to measure the levels in their blood. The lab had just reported something odd, however. For the sake of comparison, it had tested blood samples from the American Red Cross, which came from the general population and should have been free of fluorochemicals. Instead, it kept finding a contaminant in the blood.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="4.0">Johnson asked Hansen to figure out whether the lab had made a mistake. Detecting trace levels of chemicals was her specialty: She had recently written a doctoral dissertation about tiny particles in the atmosphere. Hansen’s team of lab technicians and junior scientists fetched a blood sample from a lab-­supply company and prepped it for analysis. Then Hansen switched on an oven-­size box known as a mass spectrometer, which weighs molecules so that scientists can identify them.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="5.0">As the lab equipment hummed around her, Hansen loaded a sample into the machine. A graph appeared on the mass spectrometer’s display; it suggested that there was a compound in the blood that could be PFOS. That’s weird, Hansen thought. Why would a chemical produced by 3M show up in people who had never worked for the company?</p>
        
    
                        
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="7.0">Hansen didn’t want to share her results until she was certain that they were correct, so she and her team spent several weeks analyzing more blood, often in time-consuming overnight tests. All the samples appeared to be contaminated. When Hansen used a more precise method, liquid chromatography, the results left little doubt that the chemical in the Red Cross blood was PFOS.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="9.0">Hansen now felt obligated to update her boss. Johnson was a towering, bearded man, and she liked him: He seemed to trust her expertise, and he found something to laugh about in most conversations. But, when she shared her findings, his response was cryptic. “This changes everything,” he said. Before she could ask him what he meant, he went into his office and closed the door.</p>
        
    
                    
        
    
                    
<hr>

        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="12.0">This was not the first time that Hansen had found a chemical where it didn’t belong. A wiry woman who grew up skiing competitively, Hansen had always liked to spend time outdoors; for her chemistry thesis at Williams College, she had kayaked around the former site of an electric company on the Hoosic River, collecting crayfish and testing them for industrial pollutants called polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCBs. Her research, which showed that a drainage ditch at the site was leaking the chemicals, prompted a news story and contributed to a cleanup effort overseen by the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection. At 3M, Hansen assumed that her bosses would respond to her findings with the same kind of diligence and care.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="13.0">Hansen stayed near Johnson’s office for the rest of the day, anxiously waiting for him to react to her research. He never did. In the days that followed, Hansen sensed that Johnson had notified some of his superiors. She remembers his boss, Dale Bacon, a paunchy fellow with gray hair, stopping by her desk and suggesting that she had made a mistake. “I don’t think so,” she told him. In subsequent weeks, Hansen and her team ordered fresh blood samples from every supplier that 3M worked with. Each of the samples tested positive for PFOS.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="15.0">In the middle of this testing, Johnson suddenly announced that he would be taking early retirement. After he packed up his office and left, Hansen felt adrift. She was so new to corporate life that her office clothes — pleated pants and dress shirts — still felt like a costume. Johnson had always guided her research, and he hadn’t told Hansen what she should do next. She reminded herself of what he had said — that the chemical wasn’t harmful in factory workers. But she couldn’t be sure that it was harm<em>less</em>. She knew that PCBs, for example, were mass-produced for years before studies showed that they accumulate in the food chain and cause a range of health issues, including damage to the brain. The most reliable way to gauge the safety of chemicals is to study them over time, in animals and, if possible, in humans.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="16.0">What Hansen didn’t know was that 3M had already conducted animal studies — two decades earlier. They had shown PFOS to be toxic, yet the results remained secret, even to many at the company. In one early experiment, conducted in the late ’70s, a group of 3M scientists fed PFOS to rats on a daily basis. Starting at the second-lowest dose that the scientists tested, about 10 milligrams for every kilogram of body weight, the rats showed signs of possible harm to their livers, and half of them died. At higher doses, every rat died. Soon afterward, 3M scientists found that a relatively low daily dose, 4.5 milligrams for every kilogram of body weight, could kill a monkey within weeks. (Based on this result, the chemical would currently fall into the highest of five toxicity levels recognized by the United Nations.) This daily dose of PFOS was orders of magnitude greater than the amount that the average person would ingest, but it was still relatively low — roughly comparable to the dose of aspirin in a standard tablet.</p>
        
    
                        


   
            
            
            
            

   
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="18.0">In 1979, an internal company report deemed PFOS “certainly more toxic than anticipated” and recommended longer-term studies. That year, 3M executives flew to San Francisco to consult Harold Hodge, a respected toxicologist. They told Hodge only part of what they knew: that PFOS had sickened and even killed laboratory animals and had caused liver abnormalities in factory workers. According to a 3M document that was marked “CONFIDENTIAL,” Hodge urged the executives to study whether the company’s fluorochemicals caused reproductive issues or cancer. After reviewing more data, he told one of them to find out whether the chemicals were present “in man,” and he added, “If the levels are high and widespread and the half-life is long, we could have a serious problem.” <a href="https://grist.org/accountability/3m-pfas-drinking-water-forever-chemicals-lawsuit/">Yet Hodge’s warning was omitted from official meeting notes</a>, and the company’s fluorochemical production increased over time.</p>
        
    
                        
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="20.0">Hansen’s bosses never told her that PFOS was toxic. In the weeks after Johnson left 3M, however, she felt that she was under a new level of scrutiny. One of her superiors suggested that her equipment might be contaminated, so she cleaned the mass spectrometer and then the entire lab. Her results didn’t change. Another encouraged her to repeatedly analyze her syringes, bags and test tubes, in case they had tainted the blood. (They had not.) Her managers were less concerned about PFOS, it seemed to Hansen, than about the chance that she was wrong.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="21.0">Sometimes Hansen doubted herself. She was 28 and had only recently earned her Ph.D. But she continued her experiments, if only to respond to the questions of her managers. 3M bought three additional mass spectrometers, which each cost more than a car, and Hansen used them to test more blood samples. In late 1997, her new boss, Bacon, even had her fly out to the company that manufactured the machines, so that she could repeat her tests there. She studied the blood of hundreds of people from more than a dozen blood banks in various states. Each sample contained PFOS. The chemical seemed to be everywhere.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="23.0">When 3M was founded, in 1902, it was known as the Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Company. After its mining operations flopped, the company pivoted to sandpaper and then to a series of clever inventions aimed at improving everyday life. An early employee noticed that autoworkers were struggling to paint two-tone cars, which were popular at the time; he eventually invented masking tape, using crêpe paper and cabinetmaker’s glue. Another 3M employee created Post-it notes to help him bookmark passages in his church hymnal. An official history of 3M, published for the company’s 100th anniversary, celebrated its “tolerance for tinkerers.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="24.0">Fluorochemicals had their origins in the American effort to build the atomic bomb. During the Second World War, scientists for the Manhattan Project developed one of the first safe processes for bonding carbon to fluorine, a dangerously reactive element that experts had nicknamed “the wildest hellcat” of chemistry. After the war, 3M hired some Manhattan Project chemists and began mass-producing chains of carbon atoms bonded to fluorine atoms. The resulting chemicals proved to be astonishingly versatile, in part because they resist oil, water and heat. They are also incredibly long-lasting, earning them the moniker “forever chemicals.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="25.0">In the early ’50s, 3M began selling one of its fluorochemicals, PFOA, to the chemical company DuPont for use in Teflon. Then, a couple of years later, a dollop of fluorochemical goo landed on a 3M employee’s tennis shoe, where it proved impervious to stains and impossible to wipe off. 3M now had the idea for Scotchgard and Scotchban. By the time Hansen was in elementary school, in the ’70s, both products were ubiquitous. Restaurants served French fries in Scotchban-treated packaging. Hansen’s mother sprayed Scotchgard on the living-­room couch.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="26.0">Hansen grew up in Lake Elmo, Minnesota, not far from 3M’s headquarters. Her father was one of the company’s star engineers and was even inducted into its hall of fame in 1979; he had helped to create Scotch-Brite scouring pads and Coban wrap, a soft alternative to sticky bandages. Once, he molded some fibers into cups, thinking that they might make a good bra. They turned out to be miserably uncomfortable, so he and his colleagues placed them over their mouths, giving the company the inspiration for its signature N95 mask.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="28.0">Hansen never intended to follow her father to the company. She spent her childhood summers catching turtles and leopard frogs at the lake and hoped to have a career in environmental conservation. Her first job after earning her chemistry Ph.D. was on a boat, which took her to remote parts of the Pacific Ocean. But the voyage left her so seasick that she lost 20 pounds, and she soon retreated to Minnesota. In 1996, at her father’s suggestion, Hansen applied for a position in 3M’s environmental lab.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="29.0">After Hansen started her PFOS research, her relationships with some colleagues seemed to deteriorate. One afternoon in 1998, a trim 3M epidemiologist named Geary Olsen arrived with several vials of blood and asked her to test them. The next morning, she read the results to him and several colleagues — positive for PFOS. As Hansen remembers it, Olsen looked triumphant. “Those samples came from my horse,” he said — and his horse certainly wasn’t eating at McDonald’s or trotting on Scotchgarded carpets. Hansen felt that he was trying to humiliate her. (Olsen did not respond to requests for comment.) What Hansen wanted to know was how PFOS was making its way into animals.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="30.0">She found an answer in data from lab rats, which also appeared to have fluorochemicals in their blood. Rats that had more fish meal in their diets, she discovered, tended to have higher levels of PFOS, suggesting that the chemical had spread through the food chain and perhaps through water. In male lab rats, PFOS levels rose with age, indicating that the chemical accumulated in the body. But, curiously, in female rats the levels sometimes fell. Hansen was unsettled when toxicology reports indicated why: Mother rats seemed to be offloading the chemical to their pups. Exposure to PFOS could begin before birth.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="31.0">Another study confirmed that Scotchban and Scotchgard were sources of the chemical. PFOS wasn’t an official ingredient in either product, but both ­contained other fluorochemicals that, the study showed, broke down into PFOS in the bodies of lab rats. Hansen and her team ultimately found PFOS in eagles, chickens, rabbits, cows, pigs and other animals. They also found 14 ­additional fluorochemicals in human blood, including several produced by 3M. Some were present in wastewater from a 3M factory.</p>
        
    
                        
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="33.0">At one point, Hansen told her father, Paul, that she was frustrated by the way senior colleagues kept questioning her work. Paul had recently retired, but he had confidence in 3M’s top executives, and he suggested that she take her findings directly to them. But as a relatively new employee — and one of the few women scientists at a company of about 75,000 people — Hansen found the idea preposterous. When Paul offered to talk to some of 3M’s executives himself, she was mortified at the idea of her father interceding.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="34.0">Hansen knew that if she could find a blood sample that <em>didn’t</em> contain PFOS then she might be able to convince her colleagues that the other samples did. She and her team began to study historical blood from the early decades of PFOS production. They soon found the chemical in blood from a 1969-71 Michigan breast cancer study. Then they ran an overnight test on blood that had been collected in rural China during the ’80s and ’90s. If any place were PFOS-free, she figured, it would be somewhere remote, where 3M products weren’t in widespread use.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="35.0">The next morning, anxious to see the results, Hansen arrived at the lab before anyone else. For the first time since she had begun testing blood, some of the samples showed no trace of PFOS. She was so struck that she called her husband. There was nothing wrong with her equipment or methodology; PFOS, a man-made chemical produced by her employer, really <em>was</em> in human blood, practically everywhere. Hansen’s team found it in Swedish blood samples from 1957 and 1971. After that, her lab analyzed blood that had been collected before 3M created PFOS. It tested negative. Apparently, fluorochemicals had entered human blood after the company started selling products that contained them. They had leached out of 3M’s sprays, coatings and factories — and into all of us.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="37.0">That summer, an in-house librarian at 3M delivered a surprising article to Hansen’s office mailbox. It had been written in 1981 by 3M scientists, and it described a method for measuring fluorine in blood, indicating that even back then the company was testing for fluorochemicals. One scientist mentioned in the article, Richard Newmark, still worked for 3M, in a low-lying structure nicknamed the “nerdy building.” Hansen arranged to meet with him there.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="38.0">Newmark, a collegial man with a compact build, told Hansen that, more than 20 years before, two academic scientists, Donald Taves and Warren Guy, had discovered a fluorochemical in human blood. They had wondered whether Scotchgard might be its source, so they approached 3M. Newmark told her that his subsequent experiments had confirmed their suspicions — the chemical was PFOS — but 3M lawyers had urged his lab not to admit it.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="39.0">As Hansen wrote all this down in a notebook, she felt anger rising inside her. Why had so many colleagues doubted the soundness of her results if earlier 3M experiments had already proved the same thing? After the meeting, she hurried back to the lab to find Bacon. “He knew!” she told him.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="40.0">Bacon’s face remained expressionless. He told Hansen to type up her notes for him. She remembers him telling her not to email them. (In response to questions about Hansen’s account, Bacon said that he didn’t remember specifics. When I called Newmark, he told me that he could not remember her or anything about PFOS. “It’s been a very long time, and I’m in my mid-80s, and just do not remember stuff that well,” he said.)</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="41.0">A few months later, in early 1999, Bacon invited Hansen to an extraordinary meeting: She would have the chance to present her findings to 3M’s CEO, Livio D. DeSimone. Hansen spent several days rehearsing while driving and making dinner. On the day of the meeting, she took an elevator up to the executive suite; her stomach turned as a secretary pointed her to a conference room. Men in suits sat around a long table. Her boss, Bacon, was there. DeSimone, a portly man with white hair, sat at the head of the table.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="43.0">Almost as soon as Hansen placed her first transparency on the projector, the attendees began interrogating her: Why did she do this research? Who directed her to do it? Whom did she inform of the results? The executives seemed to view her diligence as a betrayal: Her data could be damaging to the company. She remembers defending herself, mentioning Newmark’s similar work in the ’70s and trying, unsuccessfully, to direct the conversation back to her research. While the executives talked over her, Hansen noticed that DeSimone’s eyes had closed and that his chin was resting on his dress shirt. The CEO appeared to have fallen asleep. (DeSimone died in 2017. A company spokesperson did not answer my questions about the meeting.)</p>
        
    
                    
<hr>

        
    
                        
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="46.0">After that meeting, Hansen remembers learning from Bacon that her job would be changing. She would only be allowed to do experiments that a supervisor had specifically requested, and she was to share her data with only that person. She would spend most of her time analyzing samples for studies that other employees were conducting, and she should not ask questions about what the results meant. Several members of her team were also being reassigned. Bacon explained that a different scientist at 3M would lead research into PFOS going forward. Hansen felt that she was being punished and struggled not to cry.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="47.0">Even as Hansen was being sidelined, the results of her research were quietly making their way into the files of the Environmental Protection Agency. Since the ’70s, federal law has required that companies tell the EPA about any evidence indicating that a company’s products present “a substantial risk of injury to health or the environment.” In May 1998, 3M officials notified the agency, without informing Hansen, that the company had measured PFOS in blood samples from around the U.S. — a clear reference to Hansen’s work. It did not mention its animal research from the ’70s, and it said that the chemical caused “no adverse effects” at the levels the company had measured in its workers. A year later, 3M sent the EPA another letter, again without telling Hansen. This time, it informed the agency about the 14 other fluorochemicals, several of them made by 3M, that Hansen’s team had detected in human blood. The company reiterated that it did not believe that its products presented a substantial risk to human health.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="48.0">Hansen recalls that in the summer of 1999, at an annual picnic that her parents hosted for 3M scientists, she was grilling corn when one of the creators of Scotchgard, a gray-haired man in glasses, confronted her. He accused her of trying to tear down the work of her colleagues. Did it make her feel powerful ruining other people’s careers? he asked. Hansen didn’t know how to respond, and he walked away.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="49.0">Several of Hansen’s superiors had stopped greeting her in the hallways. When she presented a poster of her research at a 3M event, nobody asked her about it. She lost her appetite, and her pleated pants grew baggy. She started to worry that an angry co-worker might confront or even harm her in the company’s dark parking lot. She got into the habit of calling her husband before walking to her car.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="50.0">A year after Hansen’s meeting with the CEO, 3M, under pressure from the EPA, made a very costly decision: It was going to discontinue its entire portfolio of PFOS-­related chemicals. In May 2000, for the first time, 3M officials revealed to the press that it had detected the chemical in blood banks. One executive claimed that the discovery was a “complete surprise.” The company’s medical director <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2000/05/19/business/epa-says-it-pressed-3m-for-action-on-scotchgard-chemical.html">told The New York Times</a>, “This isn’t a health issue now, and it won’t be a health issue.” But the newspaper also quoted a professor of toxicology. “The real issue is this stuff accumulates,” the professor said. “No chemical is totally innocuous, and it seems inconceivable that anything that accumulates would not eventually become toxic.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="51.0">Hansen was now pregnant with twins. Although she was heartened by 3M’s announcement — she saw it as evidence that her work had forced the company to act — she was also ready to leave the environmental lab, where she felt marginalized. After giving birth, she joined 3M’s medical devices team. But first, she decided to have one last blood sample tested for PFOS: her own. The results showed one of the lowest readings she’d seen in human blood. Immediately, she thought of the rats that had passed the chemical on to their pups.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="52.0">Hansen told me that, for the next 19 years, she avoided the subject of fluorochemicals with the same intensity with which she had once pursued it. She focused on raising her kids and coaching a cross-country ski team; she worked a variety of jobs at 3M, none related to fluorochemicals. In 2002, when 3M announced that it would be replacing PFOS with another fluorochemical, PFBS, Hansen knew that it, too, would remain in the environment indefinitely. Still, she decided not to involve herself. She skipped over articles about the chemicals in scientific journals and newspapers, where they were starting to be linked to possible developmental, immune system and liver problems. (In 2006, after the EPA accused 3M of violating the Toxic Substances Control Act, in part by repeatedly ­failing to disclose the harms of fluorochemicals promptly, the company agreed to pay a small penalty of $1.5 million, without admitting wrongdoing.)</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="53.0">During that time, forever chemicals gained a new scientific name — per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, or PFAS, an acronym that is vexingly similar to the specific fluorochemical PFOS. A swath of 150 square miles around 3M’s headquarters was found to be polluted with PFAS; scientists discovered PFOS and PFBS in local fish and various fluorochemicals in water that roughly 125,000 Minnesotans drank. Hansen’s husband, Peter, told me that, when friends asked Hansen about PFAS, she would change the subject. Still, she repeatedly told him — and herself — that the chemicals were safe.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="56.0">In the 2016 book “Secrecy at Work,” two management theorists, Jana Costas and Christopher Grey, argue that there is nothing inherently wrong or harmful about keeping secrets. Trade secrets, for example, are protected by federal and state law on the grounds that they promote innovation and contribute to the economy. The authors draw on a large body of sociological research to illustrate the many ways that information can be concealed. An organization can compartmentalize a secret by slicing it into smaller components, preventing any one person from piecing together the whole. Managers who don’t want to disclose sensitive information may employ “stone-faced silence.” Secret-keepers can form a kind of tribe, dependent on one another’s continued discretion; in this way, even the existence of a secret can be kept secret. Such techniques become pernicious, Costas and Grey write, when a company keeps a dark secret, a secret about wrongdoing.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="57.0">Certain unpredictable events — a leak, a lawsuit, a news story — can start to unspool a secret. In the case of forever chemicals, the unspooling began on a cattle farm. In 1998, a West Virginia farmer told a lawyer, Robert Bilott, that wastewater from a DuPont site seemed to be poisoning his cows: They had started to foam at the mouth, their teeth grew black and more than a hundred eventually fell over and died. Bilott sued and obtained tens of thousands of internal documents, which helped push forever chemicals into the public consciousness. The documents revealed that the farm’s water contained PFOA, the fluorochemical that DuPont had bought from 3M, and that both companies had long understood it to be toxic. (The lawsuit, which ended in a settlement, was dramatized in the film “Dark Waters,” starring Mark Ruffalo as Bilott.) Bilott later sued 3M over contamination in Minnesota, but the judge prohibited discussion of health repercussions; a jury ultimately decided in 3M’s favor. Finally, in 2010, the Minnesota attorney general’s office filed its own suit, alleging that 3M had harmed the environment and polluted drinking water. The company paid $850 million in a settlement, without an admission of fault or liability. The AG also released thousands more internal 3M records to the public.</p>
        
    
                        
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="59.0">The AG’s records helped me report <a href="https://theintercept.com/series/bad-chemistry">a series of stories for The Intercept</a> about forever chemicals. Much of my reporting, which started in 2015, focused on <a href="https://theintercept.com/2018/07/31/3m-pfas-minnesota-pfoa-pfos/">what 3M and DuPont knew</a>, even as they continued to produce PFAS. But, as I reported on the cover-up, I wondered what it meant for a sprawling multinational company to <em>know</em> that its products were dangerous. Who knew? How much, exactly, did they know? And how had the company kept its secret? For many years, no one inside 3M would agree to speak with me.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="60.0">Then, in 2021, John Oliver did a segment on his comedy news show, “Last Week Tonight,” about forever chemicals. The segment, which mentioned my reporting, said that they could cause cancer, immune-system issues and other problems. “The world is basically soaked in the Devil’s piss right now,” Oliver said. “And not in a remotely hot way.” One of Hansen’s former professors sent her the segment, and Hansen watched it at her kitchen table — a moment that would eventually lead her to me.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="61.0">“This actually made me sad as there are so many inaccuracies,” Hansen wrote to her professor in response. But, when the professor asked her what was incorrect, Hansen didn’t know what to say. For the first time, she Googled the health effects of PFOS.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="62.0">Hansen was deeply troubled by what she read. One paper, published in 2012 in the Journal of the American Medical Association, found that, in children, as PFOS levels rose so did the chance that vaccines were ineffective. Children with high levels of PFOS and other fluorochemicals were more likely to experience fevers, according to a 2016 study. Other research linked the chemicals to increased rates of infectious diseases, food allergies and asthma in children. Dozens of scientific papers had found that, in adults, even very low levels of PFOS could interfere with hormones, fertility, liver and thyroid function, cholesterol levels and fetal development. Even PFBS, the chemical that 3M chose as a replacement for PFOS, caused developmental and reproductive irregularities in animals, according to the Minnesota Department of Health.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="63.0">Reading these studies, Hansen felt a paradoxical kind of relief: As bad as PFOS seemed to be, at least independent scientists were studying it. But she also felt enraged at the company and at herself. For years, she had repeated the company’s claim that PFOS was not harmful. “I’m not proud of that,” she told me. She felt “dirty” for ever collecting a 3M paycheck. When she read the documents released by the Minnesota AG, she was horrified by how much the company had known and how little it had told her. She found records of studies that she had conducted, as well as the typed notes from her meeting with Newmark.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="64.0">In October 2022, after Hansen had been at 3M for 26 years, her job was eliminated, and she chose not to apply for a new one. Three months later, she wrote me an email, offering to speak about what she had witnessed inside the company. “If you’d be interested in talking further, please let me know,” she wrote. The next day, we had the first of dozens of conversations.</p>
        
    
                    
<hr>

        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="66.0">When Hansen first told me about her experiences, I felt conflicted. Her work seemed to have helped force 3M to stop making a number of toxic chemicals, but I kept thinking about the 20 years in which she had kept quiet. During my first visit to Hansen’s home, in February 2023, we sat in her kitchen, eating bread that her husband had just baked. She showed me pictures of her father and shared a color-coded timeline of 3M’s history with forever chemicals. On a bitterly cold walk in a local park, we tried to figure out if any of her colleagues, besides Newmark, had known that PFOS was in everyone’s blood. She often sprinkled her stories with such Midwesternisms as “holy ­buckets!”</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="68.0">During my second trip, this past August, I asked her why, as a scientist who was trained to ask questions, she hadn’t been more skeptical of claims that PFOS was harmless. In the awkward silence that followed, I looked out the window at some hummingbirds.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="69.0">Hansen’s superiors had given her the same explanation that they gave journalists, she finally said — that factory workers were fine, so people with lower levels would be, too. Her specialty was the detection of chemicals, not their harms. “You’ve got literally the medical director of 3M saying, ‘We studied this, there are no effects,’” she told me. “I wasn’t about to challenge that.” Her income had helped to support a family of five. Perhaps, I wondered aloud, she hadn’t really wanted to know whether her company was poisoning the public.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="70.0">To my surprise, Hansen readily agreed. “It almost would have been too much to bear at the time,” she told me. 3M had successfully compartmentalized its secret; Hansen had only seen one slice. (When I sent the company detailed questions about Hansen’s account, a spokesperson responded without answering most of them or mentioning Hansen by name.)</p>
        
    
                        
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="72.0">Recently, I thought back on Taves and Guy, the academic scientists who, in the ’70s, came so close to proving that 3M’s chemicals were accumulating in humans. Taves is 97, but when I called him he told me that he still remembers clearly when company representatives visited his lab at the University of Rochester. “They wanted to know everything about what we were doing,” he told me. But the exchange was not reciprocal. “I soon found out that they weren’t going to tell me anything.” 3M never confirmed to Taves or Guy, who was a postdoctoral student at the time, that its fluorochemicals were in human blood. “I’m sort of kicking myself for not having followed up on this more, but I didn’t have any research money,” Guy told me. He eventually became a dentist to support his wife and family. (He died this year at 81.) Taves, too, left the field, to become a psychiatrist, and the trail ended there.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="73.0">Last year, while reading about the thousands of PFAS-related lawsuits that 3M was facing, I was intrigued to learn that one of them, filed by cities and towns with polluted water, had produced a new set of internal 3M documents. When I requested several from the plaintiff’s legal team, I saw two names that I recognized. In a document from 1991, a 3M scientist talked about using a mass spectrometer — the same tool that Hansen would use years later — to devise a technique for measuring PFOS in biological fluid. The author was Jim Johnson — and he had sent the report to his boss, Dale Bacon.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="74.0">This revelation made me gasp. Johnson had been Hansen’s first boss and had instigated her research into PFOS. Bacon had questioned her findings and ultimately told her to stop her work. (In a sworn deposition, Bacon said that by the ’80s he had heard, during a water-cooler chat with a colleague, that Taves and Guy had found PFOS in human blood.) What I couldn’t understand was why Johnson would ask Hansen to investigate something that he had already studied himself — and then act surprised by the results.</p>
        
    
                    
<hr>

        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="76.0">Jim Johnson, who is now an 81-year-old widower, lives with several dogs in a pale-yellow house in North Dakota. When I first called him, he said that he had begun researching PFOS in the ’70s. “I did a lot of the very original work on it,” he told me. He said that when he saw the chemical’s structure he understood “within 20 minutes” that it would not break down in nature. Shortly thereafter, one of his experiments revealed that PFOS was binding to proteins in the body, causing the chemical to accumulate over time. He told me that he also looked for PFOS in an informal test of blood from the general population, around the late ’70s, and was not surprised when he found it there.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="77.0">Johnson initially cited “480 pounds of dog” as a reason that I shouldn’t visit him, but he later relented. When I arrived, on a chilly day in November, we spent a few minutes standing outside his house, watching Snozzle, Sadie and Junkyard press their slobbery snouts against his living ­room window. Then we decamped to the nearest IHOP. Johnson, who was dressed in jeans and a flannel shirt, was so tall that he couldn’t comfortably fit into a booth. We sat at a table and ordered two bottomless coffees.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="78.0">In an experiment in the early ’80s, Johnson fed a component of Scotchban to rats and found that PFOS accumulated in their livers, a result that suggested how the chemical would behave in humans. When I asked why that mattered to the company, he took a sip of coffee and said, “It meant they were screwed.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="79.0">At the time, Johnson said, he didn’t think PFOS caused significant health problems. Still, he told me, “it was obviously bad,” because man-made compounds from household products didn’t belong in the human body. He said that he argued against using fluorochemicals in toothpaste and diapers. Contrac­tors working for 3M had shaved rabbits, he said, and smeared them with the company’s fluorochemicals to see if PFOS showed up in their bodies. “They’d send me the livers and, yup, there it was,” he told me. “I killed a lot of rabbits.” But he considered his efforts largely futile. “These idiots were already putting it in food packaging,” he said.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="80.0">Johnson told me, with seeming pride, that one reason he didn’t do more was that he was a “loyal soldier,” committed to protecting 3M from liability. Some of his assignments had come directly from company lawyers, he added, and he couldn’t discuss them with me. “I didn’t even report it to my boss, or anybody,” he said. “There are some things you take to your grave.” At one point, he also told me that, if he were asked to testify in a PFOS-related lawsuit, he would probably be of little help. “I’m an old man, and so I think they would find that I got extremely forgetful all of a sudden,” he said, and chuckled.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="81.0">Out the windows of IHOP, I watched a light dusting of snow fall on the parking lot. In Johnson’s telling, a tacit rule prevailed at 3M: Not all questions needed to be asked, or answered. His realization that PFOS was in the general public’s blood “wasn’t something anyone cared to hear,” he said. He wasn’t, for instance, putting his research on posters and expecting a warm reception. Over the years, he tried to convince several executives to stop making PFOS altogether, he told me, but they had good reason not to. “These people were selling fluorochemicals,” he said. He retired as the second-highest-­ranked scientist in his division, but he claimed that important business decisions were out of his control. “It wasn’t for me to jump up and start saying, ‘This is bullshit!’” he said, and he was “not really too interested in getting my butt fired.” And so his portion of 3M’s secret stayed in a compartment, both known and not known.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="83.0">Johnson said that he eventually tired of arguing with the few colleagues with whom he could speak openly about PFOS. “It was time,” he said. So he hired an outside lab to look for the chemical in the blood of 3M workers, knowing that it would also test blood bank samples for comparison — the first domino in a chain that would ultimately take the compound off the market. Oddly, he compared the head of the lab to a vending machine. “He gave me what I paid for,” Johnson said. “I knew what would happen.” Then Johnson tasked Hansen with something that he had long avoided: going beyond his initial experiments and meticulously documenting the chemical’s ubiquity. While Hansen took the heat, he took early retirement.</p>
        
    
                        
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="85.0">Johnson described Hansen as though she were a vending machine, too. “She did what she was supposed to do with the tools I left her,” he said.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="86.0">I pointed out that Hansen had suffered professionally and personally, and that she now feels those experiences tainted her career. “I didn’t say I was a nice guy,” Johnson replied, and laughed. After four hours, we were nearing the bottom of our bottomless coffees.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="87.0">Johnson has strayed from evidence-­based science in recent years. He now believes, for instance, that the theory of evolution is wrong, and that COVID-19 vaccines cause “turbo-cancers.” But his account of what happened at 3M closely matched Hansen’s, and when I asked him about meetings and experiments described in court documents he remembered them clearly.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="88.0">When I called Hansen about my conversation with Johnson, she grew angrier than I’d ever heard her. “He knew the whole time!” she said. Then she had to get off the phone for an appointment. “So glad I’m going to see my therapist,” she added, and hung up.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="90.0">I once thought of secrets as discrete, explosive truths that a heroic person could suddenly reveal. In the 1983 film “Silkwood,” which is based on real events, Karen Silkwood, a worker at a plutonium plant, assembles a thick folder documenting her employer’s shoddy safety practices; while driving to share them with a reporter, she dies in a mysterious one-car crash. In another adaptation of a true story, the 2015 film “Spotlight,” a source delivers a box of critical documents to The Boston Globe, helping the paper to publish an investigation into child sexual abuse within the Catholic Church. Talking to Hansen and Johnson, though, I saw that the truth can come out piecemeal over many years, and that the same people who keep secrets can help divulge them. Some slices of 3M’s secret are only now coming to light, and others may never come out.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="91.0">Between 1951 and 2000, 3M produced at least 100 million pounds of PFOS and chemicals that degrade into PFOS. This is roughly the weight of the Titanic. After the late ’70s, when 3M scientists established that the chemical was toxic in animals and was accumulating in humans, it produced millions of pounds per year. Scientists are still struggling to grasp all the biological consequences. They have learned, just as Johnson did decades ago, that proteins in the body bind to PFOS. It enters our cells and organs, where even tiny amounts can cause stress and interfere with basic biological functions. It contributes to diseases that take many years to develop; at the time of a diagnosis, one’s PFOS level may have fallen, making it difficult to establish causation with any certainty.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="92.0">The other day, I called Brad Creacey, who became an Air Force firefighter in the ’70s at the age of 18. He told me that several times a year, for practice, he and his comrades put on rubber boots and heavy silver uniforms that looked like spacesuits. Then a “torch man,” holding a stick tipped with a burning rag, ignited jet fuel that had been poured into an open-air pit. To extinguish the 100-foot-tall flames, Creacey and his colleagues sprayed them with aqueous film-forming foam, or AFFF. 3M manufactured it from several forever chemicals, including PFOS.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="93.0">Creacey remembers that AFFF felt slick and sudsy, almost like soap, and dried out the skin on his hands until it cracked. To celebrate his last day on a military base in Germany, his friends dumped a ceremonial bucket on him. Only later, after working with firefighting foam at an airport in Monterey, California, did he start to wonder if a string of ailments — cysts on his liver, a nodule near his thyroid — were connected to the foam. He had high cholesterol, which diet and exercise were unable to change. Then he was diagnosed with thyroid cancer. “It makes me feel like I was a lab rat, like we were all disposable,” Creacey told me. “I’ve lost faith in human beings.”</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="95.0">It may be tempting to think of Creacey and his peers as unwitting research subjects; indeed, recent studies show that PFOS is associated with an increased risk of thyroid cancer and, in Air Force servicemen, an elevated risk of testicular cancer. But it is probably more accurate to say that we are all part of the experiment. Average levels of PFOS are falling, but nearly all people have at least one forever chemical in their blood, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. “When you have a contaminated site, you can clean it up,” Elsie Sunderland, an environmental chemist at Harvard University, told me. “When you ubiquitously introduce a toxicant at a global scale, so that it’s detectable in everyone ... we’re reducing public health on an incredibly large scale.” Once everyone’s blood is contaminated, there is no control group with which to compare, making it difficult to establish responsibility.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="96.0">New health effects continue to be discovered. Researchers have found that exposure to PFAS during pregnancy can lead to developmental delays in children. Numerous recent studies have linked the chemicals to diabetes and obesity. This year, a study discovered 13 forever chemicals, including PFOS, in weeks-old fetuses from terminated pregnancies and linked the chemicals to biomarkers associated with liver problems. A team of New York University researchers estimated in 2018 that the costs of just two forever chemicals, PFOA and PFOS — in terms of disease burden, disability and health-care expenses — amounted to as much as $62 billion in a single year. This exceeds the current market value of 3M.</p>
        
    
                        
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="98.0">Philippe Grandjean, a physician who helped discover that PFAS harm the immune system, believes that anyone exposed to these chemicals — essentially everyone — may have an elevated risk of cancer. Our immune systems often find and kill abnormal cells before they turn into tumors. “PFAS interfere with the immune system, and likely also this critical function,” he told me. Grandjean, who served as an expert witness in the Minnesota AG’s case, has studied many environmental contaminants, including mercury. The impact of PFAS was so much more extreme, he said, that one of his colleagues initially thought it was the result of nuclear radiation.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="99.0">In April, the EPA took two historic steps to reduce exposure to PFAS. It said that PFOS and PFOA are “likely to cause cancer” and that no level of either chemical is considered safe; it deemed them hazardous substances under the Superfund law, increasing the government’s power to force polluters to clean them up. The agency also set limits for six PFAS in drinking water. In a few years, when the EPA begins enforcing the new regulations, local utilities will be required to test their water and remove any amount of PFOS or PFOA which exceeds four parts per trillion — the equivalent of one drop dissolved in several Olympic swimming pools. 3M has produced enough PFOS and chemicals that degrade into PFOS to exceed this level in all of the freshwater on earth. Meanwhile, many other PFAS continue to be used, and companies are still developing new ones. Thousands of the compounds have been produced; the Department of Defense still depends on many for use in explosives, semiconductors, cleaning fluids and batteries. PFAS can be found in nonstick cookware, guitar strings, dental floss, makeup, hand sanitizer, brake fluid, ski wax, fishing lines and countless other products.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="100.0">In a statement, a 3M spokesperson told me that the company “is proactively managing PFAS,” and that 3M’s approach to the chemicals has evolved along with “the science and technology of PFAS, societal and regulatory expectations, and our expectations of ourselves.” He directed me to a fact sheet about their continued importance in society. “These substances are critical to multiple industries — including the cars we drive, planes we fly, computers and smart phones we use to stay connected, and more,” the fact sheet read.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="101.0">Recently, 3M settled the lawsuit filed by cities and towns with polluted water. It will pay up to $12.5 billion to cover the costs of filtering out PFAS, depending on how many water systems need the chemicals removed. The settlement, however, doesn’t approach the scale of the problem. At least 45% of U.S. tap water is estimated to contain one or more forever chemicals, and one drinking water expert told me that the cost of removing them all would likely reach $100 billion.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="102.0">In 2022, 3M said that it would stop making PFAS and would “work to discontinue the use of PFAS across its product portfolio,” by the end of 2025 — a pledge that it called “another example of how we are positioning 3M for continued sustainable growth.” But it acknowledged that more than 16,000 of its products still contained PFAS. Direct sales of the chemicals were generating $1.3 billion annually. 3M’s regulatory filings also allow for the possibility that a full phaseout won’t happen — for example, if 3M fails to find substitutes. “We are continuing to make progress on our announcement to exit PFAS manufacturing,” 3M’s spokesperson told me. The company and its scientists have not admitted wrong­doing or faced criminal liability for producing forever chemicals or for concealing their harms.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="105.0">Hansen often wonders what her father would say about 3M if he were still alive. A few years ago, he began to show signs of dementia, which worsened during the COVID-19 pandemic. Every time Hansen explained to him that a novel coronavirus was sickening people around the world, he asked how he might contribute — forgetting that the N95 mask he helped to create was already protecting millions of people from infection. When he died, in January 2021, Hansen noticed some Coban wrap on his arm. It was shielding his delicate skin from tears, just as he had designed it to. “He invented that,” Hansen told the hospice nurse, who smiled politely.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="106.0">After she left 3M, Hansen began volunteering at a local nature preserve, where she works to clear paths and protect native plants. Last August, she took me there, and we walked to a creek where she often spends time. The water is home to three species of trout, she told me. It is also polluted by forever chemicals that 3M once dumped upstream.</p>
        
    
                                  
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="108.0">For most of our hike, a thick wall of flowers — purple joe-pye weed and goldenrod — made it impossible to see the creek bank. Then we came to a wooden bench. I climbed on top of it and looked down on the creek. As I listened to the gurgling of water and the buzzing of insects, I thought I understood why Hansen liked to come here. It was too late to save the creek from pollution; 3M’s chemicals could be there for thousands of years to come.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.infoq.com/news/2024/05/uber-dynamodb-ledgerstore/">https://www.infoq.com/news/2024/05/uber-dynamodb-ledgerstore/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40413891">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
								<p>Uber <a href="https://www.uber.com/en-AU/blog/migrating-from-dynamodb-to-ledgerstore/">migrated all its payment transaction data from DynamoDB and blob storage into a new long-term solution</a>, a purpose-built data store named LedgerStore. The company was looking for cost savings and had previously reduced the use of DynamoDB to store hot data (12 weeks old). The move resulted in significant savings and simplified the storage architecture.</p>

<p>Uber built Gulfstream, its payment platform, in 2017 and used DynamoDB for storage. Due to rising storage costs, DynamoDB was used only for the most recent data (12 weeks), and older data was stored in TerraBlob, an S3-like service created in-house by Uber.</p>

<p>In the meantime, the company started working on a dedicated solution for storing financial transactions with data integrity guarantees. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kaushikd49">Kaushik Devarajaiah</a>, tech lead at Uber, explains the unique challenges of creating a bespoke data store:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>LedgerStore is an immutable storage solution at Uber that provides verifiable data completeness and correctness guarantees to ensure data integrity for these transactions. [...] Considering that ledgers are the source of truth of any financial event or data movement at Uber, it is important to be able to look up ledgers from various access patterns via indexes. This brings in the need for trillions of indexes to index hundreds of billions of ledgers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://www.uber.com/en-AU/blog/how-ledgerstore-supports-trillions-of-indexes/">LedgerStore</a> supports strongly and eventually consistent indexes. For strongly consistent indexes, the data store uses a two-phase commit. It first persists the indent on the index and subsequently persists the record. Lastly, if the record write succeeds, the intent is asynchronously committed or rolled back in case of failure. If the intent write fails, the whole insert operation fails, as consistency guarantees cannot be supported. During reads, any writes with uncommitted intents are either committed (if the record read succeeds) or deleted (if the record read fails) asynchronously. LedgerStore implements eventually consistent indexes by leveraging materialized views from its home-grown <a href="https://www.uber.com/blog/schemaless-sql-database/?uclick_id=37e0581b-5432-40df-b0a8-4b055bb80aa7">Docstore database</a>, a distributed database built on top of MySQL.</p>

<p><img alt="" data-src="news/2024/05/uber-dynamodb-ledgerstore/en/resources/1uber-ledgerstore-writes-1716025995484.jpeg" src="https://imgopt.infoq.com/fit-in/3000x4000/filters:quality(85)/filters:no_upscale()/news/2024/05/uber-dynamodb-ledgerstore/en/resources/1uber-ledgerstore-writes-1716025995484.jpeg" rel="share"></p>

<p>Two-phase Commit Write For Strongly Consistent Indexes (Source: <a href="https://www.uber.com/en-AU/blog/how-ledgerstore-supports-trillions-of-indexes/">Uber Engineering Blog</a>)</p>

<p>To offload older ledger data to cold storage, LedgerStore uses time-range indexes to support temporal queries. Uber moved from using <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/">DynamoDB</a> and Docstore for storing time-range indexes. The original solution utilized two tables in DynamoDB, one optimized for writes and the second for reads. This design was dictated by DynamoDB’s capacity management and avoided hot partitions and throttling. The new design uses the Docstore database with a single table, and leverages prefix scanning for efficient reads.</p>

<p>LedgerStore supports index lifecycle management, automating data reindexing in case the index definition changes. The process creates a new index, backfills the data from the old index, performs relevant validations, swaps indexes, and deletes the old one.</p>

<p><img alt="" data-src="news/2024/05/uber-dynamodb-ledgerstore/en/resources/1uber-ledgerstore-index-backfill-1716025995484.jpeg" src="https://imgopt.infoq.com/fit-in/3000x4000/filters:quality(85)/filters:no_upscale()/news/2024/05/uber-dynamodb-ledgerstore/en/resources/1uber-ledgerstore-index-backfill-1716025995484.jpeg" rel="share"></p>

<p>Index Backfilling From Cold Storage (Source: <a href="https://www.uber.com/en-AU/blog/how-ledgerstore-supports-trillions-of-indexes/">Uber Engineering Blog</a>)</p>

<p>The company faced unique challenges while migrating petabytes of financial transaction data into LedgerStore. It used shadow and offline validation to ensure the correctness of the migration and the performance and scalability of LedgerStore in the production environment. For shadow validation, Gulfstorm was double-writing the data to DynamoDB and LedgerStore and comparing the data returned by reads between the two data stores.</p>

<p>Additionally, Uber implemented offline validation for historical data, coupled with the incremental backfill job running in <a href="https://spark.apache.org/">Apache Spark</a>. The backfill process alone posed significant problems, as the load generated by the process amounted to ten times the usual production load, and the overall process took three months. Engineers used several measures to control the process and mitigate any issues, including dynamic rate control to adjust the processing rate based on the production traffic handled by the platform and emergency stop to halt the process quickly in case of major issues.</p>

<p>Lastly, the team took a conservative approach towards the rollout and adopted a fallback to fetching the data from DynamoDB in case it wasn’t found in LedgerStore. The overall migration was completed successfully, and the company didn’t experience any downtime or outages during and after the migration. The move to LedgerStore resulted in significant cost savings, with estimated yearly savings of over $6 million.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><figure><img alt="Gavel" loading="eager" width="2880" height="1620" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://www.anthropic.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww-cdn.anthropic.com%2Fimages%2F4zrzovbb%2Fwebsite%2F6276c7f8e14b693c66836810242243bd8dfd03ce-2880x1620.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 1x" src="https://www.anthropic.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww-cdn.anthropic.com%2Fimages%2F4zrzovbb%2Fwebsite%2F6276c7f8e14b693c66836810242243bd8dfd03ce-2880x1620.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75"></figure><p>Last summer we published our first <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/anthropics-responsible-scaling-policy">Responsible Scaling Policy (RSP)</a>, which focuses on addressing catastrophic safety failures and misuse of frontier models. In adopting this policy, our primary goal is to help turn high-level safety concepts into practical guidelines for fast-moving technical organizations and demonstrate their viability as possible standards. As we operationalize the policy, we expect to learn a great deal and plan to share our findings. This post shares reflections from implementing the policy so far. We are also working on an updated RSP and will share this soon.</p><p>We have found having a clearly-articulated policy on catastrophic risks extremely valuable. It has provided a structured framework to clarify our organizational priorities and frame discussions around project timelines, headcount, threat models, and tradeoffs. The process of implementing the policy has also surfaced a range of important questions, projects, and dependencies that might otherwise have taken longer to identify or gone undiscussed.</p><p>Balancing the desire for strong commitments with the reality that we are still seeking the right answers is challenging. In some cases, the original policy is ambiguous and needs clarification. In cases where there are open research questions or uncertainties, setting overly-specific requirements is unlikely to stand the test of time. That said, as industry actors face increasing commercial pressures we hope to move from voluntary commitments to established best practices and then well-crafted regulations.</p><p>As we continue to iterate on and improve the original policy, we are actively exploring ways to incorporate practices from existing risk management and operational safety domains. While none of these domains alone will be perfectly analogous, we expect to find valuable insights from nuclear security, biosecurity, systems safety, autonomous vehicles, aerospace, and cybersecurity. <a href="https://grnh.se/4f33f5958us">We are building an interdisciplinary team</a> to help us integrate the most relevant and valuable practices from each.</p><p>Our current framework for doing so is summarized below, as a set of five high-level commitments.</p><ol><li><strong>Establishing Red Line Capabilities. </strong>We commit to identifying and publishing "Red Line Capabilities" which might emerge in future generations of models and would present too much risk if stored or deployed under our current safety and security practices (referred to as the <em>ASL-2 Standard)</em>. </li><li><strong>Testing for Red Line Capabilities (Frontier Risk Evaluations). </strong>We commit to demonstrating that the Red Line Capabilities are not present in models, or - if we cannot do so - taking action as if they are (more below). This involves collaborating with domain experts to design a range of "Frontier Risk Evaluations"<em> – </em>empirical tests which, if failed, would give strong evidence against a model being at or near a red line capability. We also commit to maintaining a clear evaluation process and a summary of our current evaluations publicly. </li><li><strong>Responding to Red Line Capabilities. </strong>We commit to develop and implement a new standard for safety and security sufficient to handle models that have the <em>Red Line Capabilities. </em>This set of measures is referred to as the <em>ASL-3 Standard</em>. We commit not only to define the risk mitigations comprising this standard, but also detail and follow an assurance process to validate the standard’s effectiveness. Finally, we commit to pause training or deployment if necessary to ensure that models with Red Line Capabilities are only trained, stored and deployed when we are able to apply the ASL-3 standard. </li><li><strong>Iteratively extending this policy. </strong>Before we proceed with activities which require the ASL-3 standard, we commit to publish a clear description of its upper bound of suitability: a new set of <em>Red Line Capabilities</em> for which we must build <em>Frontier Risk Evaluations</em>, and which would require a higher standard of safety and security (ASL-4) before proceeding with training and deployment. This includes maintaining a clear evaluation process and summary of our evaluations publicly.</li><li><strong>Assurance Mechanisms. </strong>We commit to ensuring this policy is executed as intended, by implementing <em>Assurance Mechanisms</em>. These should ensure that our evaluation process is stress-tested; our safety and security mitigations are validated publicly or by disinterested experts; our Board of Directors and <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/the-long-term-benefit-trust">Long-Term Benefit Trust</a> have sufficient oversight over the policy implementation to identify any areas of non-compliance; and that the policy itself is updated via an appropriate process.</li></ol><h3>Threat Modeling and Evaluations</h3><p>Our Frontier Red Team and Alignment Science teams have focused on threat modeling and engaging with domain experts. They are primarily focused on (a) improving threat models to determine which capabilities would warrant the ASL-3 standard of security and safety, (b) working with teams developing ASL-3 controls to ensure that those controls are tailored to the correct risks, and (c) mapping capabilities which the ASL-3 standard would be insufficient to handle, and which we would continue to test for even once it is implemented. Some key reflections are:</p><ul><li>Each new generation of models has emergent capabilities, making anticipating properties of future models unusually challenging. There is a serious need for further threat modeling.</li><li>There is reasonable disagreement amongst experts over which risks to prioritize and how new capabilities might cause harm, even in relatively established Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear (CBRN) domains. Talking to a wide variety of experts in different sub-domains has been valuable, given the lack of consensus view.</li><li>Attempting to make threat models quantitative has been helpful for deciding which capabilities and scenarios to prioritize.</li></ul><p>Our Frontier Red Team, Alignment Science, Finetuning, and Alignment Stress Testing teams are focused on building evaluations and improving our overall methodology. Currently, we conduct pre-deployment testing in the domains of cybersecurity, CBRN, and Model Autonomy for frontier models which have reached 4x the compute of our most recently tested model (you can read a more detailed description of our most recent set of evaluations on Claude 3 Opus <a href="https://cdn.sanity.io/files/4zrzovbb/website/210523b8e11b09c704c5e185fd362fe9e648d457.pdf">here</a>). We also test models mid-training if they reach this threshold, and re-test our most capable model every 3 months to account for finetuning improvements. Teams are also focused on building evaluations in a number of new domains to monitor for capabilities for which the ASL-3 standard will still be unsuitable, and identifying ways to make the overall testing process more robust. Some key reflections are:</p><ul><li>Fast iteration cycles with domain experts are especially valuable for recognizing when the difficulty level of a test is poorly calibrated or the task is divorced from the threat model in question. </li><li>We should increasingly aim to leverage and encourage the growing ecosystem of researchers and firms in this space. Many of the risks we aim to assess, particularly those involving autonomy or misalignment, are inherently complex and speculative, and our own testing and threat modeling is likely incomplete. It will also be valuable to develop a mature external ecosystem that can adequately assess the quality of our claims, as well as offer accessible evals as a service to less well-resourced companies. We have begun to test partnerships with external organizations in these areas.</li><li>Different evaluation methodologies have their own strengths and weaknesses, and the methods that most compellingly assess a model's capabilities will differ depending on the threat model or domain in question.<ul><li><em>Question &amp; answer datasets</em> are relatively easy to design and run quickly. However, they may not be the most reflective of real-world risk due to their inherently constrained formats. Teams will continue to explore the possibility of designing datasets that are good proxies for more complex sets of tasks, and which could trigger a more comprehensive, time-intensive set of testing.</li><li><em>Human trials</em> comparing the performance of subjects with model access to that of subjects with search engines are valuable for measuring misuse-related domains. However, they are time-intensive, requiring robust, well-documented, and reproducible processes. We have found it especially important to focus on establishing good expert baselines, ensuring sufficient trial sizes, and performing careful statistical inference in order to get meaningful signals from trials. We are exploring ways to scale up our infrastructure to run these types of tests. </li><li><em>Automated task evaluations</em> have proven informative for threat models where models take actions autonomously. However, building realistic virtual environments is one of the more engineering-intensive styles of evaluation. Such tasks also require secure infrastructure and safe handling of model interactions, including manual human review of tool use when the task involves the open internet, blocking potentially harmful outputs, and isolating vulnerable machines to reduce scope. These considerations make scaling the tasks challenging. </li><li>Although less rigorous and reproducible than the approaches described above, <em>expert red-teaming</em> and reviewing model behavior via transcripts have also proven valuable. These methods allow for more open-ended exploration of model capabilities and make it easier to seek expert opinions on the relevance of different evaluation tasks or questions. </li></ul></li><li>There are a number of open research questions on which our teams will focus over the coming months to build a reliable evaluation process. We welcome more exploration in these areas from the broader research community. <ul><li>We aim to collect evidence about model risk and prepare suitable mitigations <em>before</em> reaching dangerous thresholds. This requires extrapolating from current evidence to future risk levels. Ideally, the “scaling laws” that lead to dangerous capabilities would be smooth, making it possible to predict when models might develop dangerous capabilities. In future, we hope to be able to predict precisely how much more capable a next-generation model will be in a given domain. </li><li>Techniques can be used to help models complete tasks more effectively, including domain-specific reinforcement learning training, prompt engineering, and supervised fine-tuning. This makes it impossible to guarantee we are eliciting all the relevant model capabilities during testing. A good testing process involves a concerted effort to pass evaluations and invest in capability elicitation improvements. This is important to simulate scenarios where well-resourced malicious actors bypass security controls and gain access to model weights. However, there is no clear distinction between trying extremely hard to elicit a dangerous capability in some model and simply training a model to have that capability. We hope to make more precise and principled claims about what sufficient elicitation would look like in future versions of the policy. </li><li>There is significant value in making our risk assessment process externally legible. We have therefore aimed to pre-specify test results we think are indicative of an intolerable level of risk when left unmitigated. These clear commitments help avoid production pressures incentivizing the relaxation of standards, although they may inevitably result in somewhat crude or arbitrary thresholds. We would like to explore ways to better aggregate the different sources of evidence described above while maintaining external legibility for verifiable commitments. Similarly, we may explore whether to incorporate other sources of evidence, such as forecasting, which are common in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delphi_method#Applications">other domains</a>.</li></ul></li></ul><h3>The ASL-3 Standard</h3><p>Our Security, Alignment Science, and Trust and Safety teams have been focused on developing the ASL-3 standard. Their goal is to design and implement a set of controls that will sufficiently mitigate the risk of the model weights being stolen by non-state actors or models being misused via our product surfaces. This standard would be sufficient for many models with capabilities where even a low rate of misuse could be catastrophic. However, it would not be sufficient to handle capabilities which would enable state groups or groups with substantial state backing and resources. Some key reflections are:</p><ul><li>Our current plans for ensuring models are used safely and responsibly in all of our product surfaces (e.g. Vertex, Bedrock, Claude.ai) involve scaling up research on classifier models for automated detection and response as well as strengthening all aspects of traditional trust and safety practices. <ul><li>For human misuse, we expect a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defence_in_depth_(non-military)">defense-in-depth</a> approach to be most promising. This will involve using a combination of reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) and Constitutional AI, systems of classifiers detecting misuse at multiple stages in user interactions (e.g. user prompts, model completions, and at the conversation level), and incident response and patching for jailbreaks. Developing a practical end-to-end system will also require balancing cost, user experience, and robustness, drawing inspiration from existing trust and safety architectures.</li><li>As described in the Responsible Scaling Policy, we will red-team this end-to-end system prior to deployment to ensure robustness against sophisticated attacks. We emphasize the importance of tying risk mitigation efforts directly to threat models, and have found that these risk mitigation objectives are improved via close collaboration between the teams developing our red-teaming approach and the researchers leading our threat modeling and evaluations efforts. </li></ul></li><li>Scaling up our security program and developing a comprehensive roadmap to defend against a wide variety of non-state actors has required a surge of effort: around 8% of all Anthropic employees are now working on security-adjacent areas and we expect that proportion to grow further as models become more economically valuable to attackers. The threat models and security targets articulated in the RSP have been especially valuable for our security team to help prioritize and motivate the necessary changes.<ul><li>Implementing the level of security required by the ASL-3 standard will require changing every aspect of employees' day-to-day workflows. To make these changes in a thoughtful way, our security team has invested significant time in building partnerships with teams, especially researchers, to preserve productivity and apply state-of-the-art cyber security controls to tooling. </li><li>Our threat modeling assumes that insider device compromise is our highest risk vector. Given this, one of our main areas of focus has been implementing multi-party authorization, time-bounded access controls in order to reduce the risk of model weights exfiltration. Under this system, employees are granted temporary access and only via the smallest set of necessary permissions. Fortunately, Anthropic has already adopted a culture of peer review across software engineering, research, comms, and finance teams, and so adopting multi-party controls as we approach the ASL-3 level has been a well-received extension of these existing cultural norms. </li></ul></li><li>In such a fast-moving field, it is often difficult to define risk mitigations, or even the methods we will use to assess their effectiveness, upfront. We want to make binding commitments where possible while still allowing degrees of freedom when new information and situations arise. We expect it will be most practical, for both the ASL-3 standard and future standards, to provide a high-level sketch of expected mitigations and set clear “attestation” standards they must meet before use. For example, with our security standard, we can clarify the goal of defending against non-state actors without specifying detailed controls in advance, and pair this with a sensible attestation process involving detailed control lists, review from disinterested experts, and board approval.</li></ul><h3>Assurance Structures</h3><p>Lastly, our Responsible Scaling, Alignment Stress Testing, and Compliance teams have been focused on exploring possible governance, coordination, and assurance structures. We intend to introduce more independent checks over time and are looking to hire a <a href="https://boards.greenhouse.io/anthropic/jobs/4024668008">Risk Manager</a> to develop these structures, drawing on best practices from other industries and relevant research. Some key reflections are:</p><ul><li>The complexity and cross-functional nature of the workstreams described above requires a high level of central coordination. We will continue to build a Responsible Scaling Team to manage the complex web of work streams and dependencies. Amidst a range of competing priorities, strong executive backing has also been essential in reinforcing that identifying and mitigating risks from frontier models is a company priority, deserving significant resources.</li><li>There is value in creating a “second line of defense” – teams that can take a more adversarial approach to our core work streams. Our Alignment Stress Testing team has begun to stress-test our evaluations, interventions, and overall policy execution. For example, the team provided reflections on potential under-elicitation alongside our Claude 3 Opus evaluations report, which were shared with our Board of Directors and summarized in our report to the U.S. Department of Commerce Bureau of Industry and Security. It may make sense to build out a bespoke internal audit function over time. </li><li>In addition to providing regular updates to our Board of Directors and the <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/the-long-term-benefit-trust">Long-Term Benefit Trust</a>, we have shared evaluations reports and quarterly updates on progress towards future mitigations to all employees. Encouraging employees to feel ownership over the RSP and share areas they would like to see us improve the policy has been immensely helpful, with staff drawing on diverse backgrounds to provide valuable insights. We also recently implemented a non-compliance reporting policy that allows employees to anonymously report concerns to our Responsible Scaling Officer about our implementation of our RSP.</li></ul><p>Ensuring future generations of frontier models are trained and deployed responsibly will require serious investment from both Anthropic and others across industry and governments. Our Responsible Scaling Policy has been a powerful rallying point with many teams' objectives over the past months connecting directly back to the major workstreams above. The progress we have made on operationalizing safety during this period has necessitated significant engagement from teams across Anthropic, and there is much more work to be done. Our goal in sharing these reflections ahead of the upcoming AI Seoul Summit is to continue the discussion on creating thoughtful, empirically-grounded frameworks for managing risks from frontier models. We are eager to see more companies adopt their own frameworks and share their own experiences, leading to the development of shared best practices and informing future efforts by governments.</p></div></div>]]></description>

  <h3>a way to structure the discussion </h3><p>I see there being three different types of autonomous process - randomness, rules and natural systems. The bulk of this article will look at these three things, and examples of how each is implemented in generative art.</p><p>This is a non-perfect categorisation, with crossover and omissions which I’ll stuff in round the edges, but it is a structure for establishing the different types of autonomy, and for exploring generativity. </p>

  <h3>The mainstay of generation</h3><p>Randomness drives most of what we think of as “generative art”. </p><p>An artist writes code which produces different outputs depending on the values of a set of variables. These variables could be things like the number of circles to draw, their positions, what size they are, what colour they are, and so on. </p><p>For example, in the following (work in progress) images, variables define the positions of a collection of nodes, the number of nodes, how many other nodes they connect to and the colours and thickness of the connecting lines.</p>

  <p>Of course we <em>could</em> define those variables’ values in the code, or we <em>could </em>manually drag sliders up and down to alter them - but these would be very human controlled, non-autonomous processes. It would also be tedious to manually define the properties of each of the nodes when there are thousands of them. </p><p>Instead, to create a <em>generative </em>artwork, we can use a function like random() to generate the values. Different images can be generated every time the code is run, producing a variety of outputs. </p><p>Vera Molnar, a pioneer of generative art, made extensive use of randomness in her work, and <a href="https://vimeo.com/372579247">this clip</a> of her talking on the topic is a delight. </p>

  <h3>Pseudorandom</h3><p>Something that’s super important in a conceptual and technical sense is that, in fact, it’s usually not randomness at all, it’s pseudorandomness. </p><p>Computers generally have no mechanism by which to pick a truly random number, but we can generate numbers which are usually sufficiently random for our purposes as artists using a pseudorandom number generator (prng). </p><p>A prng works by taking an initial value, known as a “seed”, and running it through an algorithm to produce a result. The seed value is often taken from something like the timestamp on the computer. </p><p>If the algorithm is run 10,000 times with 10,000 different seeds, it should produce a set of results with an even distribution from 0 to 1. This p5js code and output shows 10,000 squares which are evenly distributed across the canvas, as their x,y positions were generated using the <strong>random()</strong> function. </p>

  <h3>A philosophical sidebar</h3><p>We can say a pseudorandom number generator is deterministic and predictable, while numbers generated from a natural source are chaotic and unpredictable.</p><p>In fact though, the latter is only unpredictable if the universe is. If we live in a deterministic universe, where every event is determined by prior events, then theoretically there exists no source of true randomness. Quantum mechanics suggests this is not the case, as subatomic particles can be observed to behave in ways that, as far as we can tell, are truly random and have no cause. However, the debate on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Determinism">determinism</a> has not reached consensus. </p><p>I’d like to explore this more in a future blog as there are some mysterious conceptual threads to pull at. </p><p>In the meantime - we can certainly say that in practical terms natural sources of chaotic data like atmospheric noise are unpredictable, and <a href="https://phys.org/news/2021-01-unpredictable-nature-quantum-mechanics-random.html">quantum</a> <a href="https://qrng.anu.edu.au/">random</a> <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-95388-7">number</a> <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/quantum-mechanics-could-solve-cryptographys-random-number-problem/">generators</a> are possibly even theoretically unpredictable. </p>

  <h3>Following instructions</h3><p>In Studio Moniker’s project <a href="https://studiomoniker.com/projects/red-follows-yellow-follows-blue-follows-red"><em>Red Follows Yellow Follows Blue Follows Red</em></a>, a group of participants wear coloured capes and headphones, on which they are given instructions. For example the participants in a red cape might be told to “follow yellow but avoid blue” while participants in blue are told “follow red but avoid yellow”. </p><p>In this very human experiment, most participants follow the instructions closely but occasionally individuals can be seen to misinterpret or ignore them to varying degrees, shifting the balance of control between the artists and the participants. </p>

  <h3>Emergence</h3><p>When individual components of a system each have their own properties and behaviours, unexpected and interesting results can emerge at the system level. </p><p>Emergence is prevalent throughout nature and can be observed in weather systems, ant colonies, flocks of birds, convection and more. We can generate our own emergent systems by creating rules for individual elements. </p>

  <h3>Cellular Automata</h3><p>Cellular automata are a well-known emergent system, seen in examples such as Conway’s Game of Life and Wolfram’s rules. </p><p>Conway’s Game of Life plays out on a grid of cells, each of which is set to live or dead for the first turn (perhaps randomly, or in some pattern). For each proceeding turn, each cell looks at its 8 neighbours and determines its own new state according to these rules: </p><ol data-rte-list="default"><li><p>Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if caused by underpopulation.</p></li><li><p>Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next turn.</p></li><li><p>Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.</p></li><li><p>Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.</p></li></ol><p>This results in surprisingly complex patterns across the whole grid, which are also determined by the starting pattern.</p>

  <p>You can play with my Conway’s Game of Life implementation <a href="https://editor.p5js.org/amygoodchild/sketches/RH_6RNRxs">here</a>. Be sure to click the play button in the top left to start, and check out the controls at the top of the code. </p><p>These systems can be made even more complex and varied by increasing the number of possible states, changing the neighbourhood size and shape and playing with different sets of rules. When the system has multiple states and loops around in a cycle, like 0, 1, 2, 3, 0, 1, 2… it is called a Cyclic Cellular Automaton. </p><p>Here’s one I implemented recently:</p>

  <h3>Simulated Ecosystems</h3><p>We can also break out of the grid into more versatile emergent systems made up of moving creatures. Each creature has their own behaviours, which are often inspired by real life, emulating flocking, reproduction, growth, consumption, death and more.</p><p>Here are a couple of examples of systems of creatures I’ve developed with different features. <br></p>

<p>Interdependence between members of an ecosystem like this is something I plan to explore more in my work. When we incorporate birth and death of creatures, necessity of food sources and threat of predators, we can observe an ecosystem thrive or die out. </p>

  <h3>Other simulations</h3><p>Commonly, artists simulate phenomena from the real world, with algorithms based on things like reaction diffusion, diffusion limited aggregation, forces, snowflakes, tree growth, slime mould, to name just a few. </p><p>Many complex real world systems and phenomena can be modelled by simulating the rules which govern their composite parts, and the variables which affect them.</p>

  <p>Simulations can vary in their level of abstraction, in a way that could be considered a gradient from art to science, with some works being loosely inspired by something from nature, while others seek to closely model and investigate the real world. </p><p>Consider these two sets of snowflakes. The first image shows outputs from <a href="https://www.misha.studio/snowflaker/">Snowflaker</a>, which generates simple and pleasing snowflake svgs. The second shows <a href="https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/sa-visual/in-silico-flurries/">Gravner-Griffeath</a> snowflakes (interactive example <a href="https://cruzgodar.com/applets/gravner-griffeath-snowflakes/gravner-griffeath-snowflakes.html">here</a>), which are generated by accurately modelling crystal growth under different conditions. </p>

  <h3>Algorithm is the idea</h3><p>Some ideas come to me in a format of “what if it did this, and then this, and then that… what would it look like?” The idea <em>is</em> the algorithm - a list of steps. </p><p>In the following pen-plotted works from Casey Reas’ series <a href="https://reas.com/rgb_3/"><em>RGB-3</em></a>, the three angles in the titles describe the angles of the red, green and blue lines.

  <h3>Last thoughts about rules</h3><p>In this article and in my work so far I have only scratched the surface of what is possible with rule based generation. </p><p>Some key things I wanted to get across from this section: </p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>There are lots of different ways to set and implement rules.</p></li><li><p>Rules applied at an individual level can result in unexpected emergent phenomena at a system level, and it’s often necessary to actually run the rules to know the result. </p></li><li><p>Rules that govern behaviour are prevalent in natural systems. </p></li><li><p>In generative art there is often a balance of control between the rule setter and the rule follower, or the artist and the machine. </p></li></ul>

  <h3>Growing art</h3><p>In <a href="https://magical-contamination.tumblr.com/"><em>Magical Contamination</em></a>, Antoine Bridier-Nahmias curates petri dishes of microorganisms. Just as Gravner-Griffeath’s snowflakes (see above) are defined by a set of modelled variables, here the artist varies the outputs by controlling conditions like oxygen levels, light and temperature, to influence the growth of the mould. </p><p>The key difference of course is that <em>Magical Contamination </em>is of the real world, being less exact, more chaotic and of higher resolution than a simulation. (Or perhaps, the simulation we consider to be the real world is…)</p>

  <h3>Last thoughts about Natural systems</h3><p>This section is shorter than the other two because work of this type, that considers itself generative art, is much less prevalent than other types of generative art. </p><p>I felt it warranted its own section because natural systems do influence the field so strongly, and it feels valid that randomness, rules and natural systems form a trifecta of generative art methodologies.</p>

  <h3>Data sources and inputs</h3><p>We’ve already talked about using a chaotic data source as a true random number generator, but what about using a non-chaotic data source? </p><p>In some work of this genre, there is a clear crossover with data visualisation, as in Aaron Koblin’s <a href="http://www.aaronkoblin.com/project/flight-patterns/"><em>Flight Patterns</em></a>, which visualises air traffic across North America. Meanwhile in Maria Takeuchi and Frederico Phillips’ film, <a href="http://www.asphyxia-project.com/"><em>Asphyxia</em></a>, a Kinect captures the movements of dancer Shiho Tanaka and uses them to a generated 3D rendered structure. Here the output is still representational of the input, but in a less data-led way.</p>

  <h3>Artificial Intelligence</h3><p>Art that uses machine learning stands parallel to, but separate from generative art. It’s almost surprising how little they are considered related, yet outputs from an AI are undoubtedly generative. A machine learning algorithm is a complex system of rules and could perhaps be considered in the Rules section, but it’s fair to say that ML/AI art is its own thing. </p><p>A machine learning algorithm requires a data source to be trained on. In Anna Ridler’s work <a href="http://annaridler.com/myriad-tulips"><em>Myriad (Tulips)</em></a>, she created her data set manually and painstakingly, by taking 10,000 photographs of tulips. Then in her work <a href="http://annaridler.com/mosaic-virus"><em>Mosaic Virus</em></a> she trained a GAN (generative adversarial network - machine learning framework) on this dataset, to generate new images of tulips. </p>

  <h3>Automatism</h3><p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surrealism">surrealists</a> used a technique called automatic drawing, wherein the hand is allowed to move “randomly” across a page. By most accounts this is a way to allow the artist’s subconscious to express itself, while for early abstract artist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilma_af_Klint">Hilma Af Klint</a>, it was a way of communicating with the spirit world in séances. </p>

  <p>Earlier, I defined generative art as being made “not under direct human control”, so perhaps this inclusion stretches that definition. Or perhaps if artists are truly accessing their subconscious (or, indeed, the spirit world) then this work is not under their direct control. Perhaps the subconscious can be considered a random source. </p><p>Thinking about that balance of control present in many generative artworks, between the artist and the computer, or between the artist and a participant; perhaps the artist and their own subconscious can be thought of the same way. When we have ideas, where do they come from? If the idea is a impulse to draw in one direction or the other, is that system any less chaotic than the weather?</p>

  <p>Some automatists would produce entire pieces purely at the mercy of their subconscious, while other artists would use this technique to begin a piece, and then consciously move more towards figurative or composed imagery as it emerged. <a href="https://www.tate.org.uk/art/art-terms/a/automatism">Automatism</a> led to techniques that sought to introduce chance and spontaneity to creation and mark making, like collage, pencil rubbings (frottage), and paint scraping (grattage). </p><p>This leads us nicely on to the next section: </p>

  <h3>painting and drawing</h3><p>At the start of this article I said that traditional painting could be considered generative. This is true in two ways - the first is when there is some level of automatism in the artist’s process and the second is when the physical process of laying paint down on a canvas involves chance. </p><p><a href="https://www.tate.org.uk/art/artists/jackson-pollock-1785">Jackson Pollock</a>’s action-paintings are an obvious example of both of these things. His process was influenced by automatism and his work was not made according to any plan. He allowed it to emerge out of the process of painting, surrendering control to existing in the moment. The energetic, unconstrained nature of his drip technique means that natural processes were strongly present in his work, as phenomena like fluid dynamics introduced randomness to the results.</p>

<p>Rather than thinking of paintings as either having these generative elements or not, I prefer to think of it as a gradient. Some paintings are tightly and consciously controlled by the artist, some are heavily influenced by chance, and many are somewhere in between. The intent and perspective of the artist is also important, in terms of whether they would consider their work to be generative. </p>

  <h2>Conclusion</h2><p>When we think of generative art, we generally think of p5js sketches, Vera Molnar’s plotter drawings, and flow fields. These are all things I hold dear to my heart but just below the surface of that view, we can find a rich abundance of other avenues to explore. I am confident there are more examples and perspectives I have not included!</p><p>In working with the categories above, I frequently found that examples or ideas could fit into multiple sections. I think a multitude of opportunities for new artworks can be found by looking at ways elements and ideas from each of these categories can be combined and remixed. </p><p>There is a rich conceptual scope in considering the boundaries between what is chance and what is the result of a series of prior steps as well as the questions of where ideas and randomness come from, where generativity appears in nature, what <em>isn’t </em>generative, what is a simulation, and more. </p><p>Generative art isn’t a new genre, but it is booming at the moment, and in some ways we’re still in the early stages of what’s possible. I look forward to seeing (and contributing to!) work that explores these avenues and more, and tackles these conceptual questions. </p>

The URL API in browsers lets you do that, but it’s ergonomics aren’t ideal.<span id="more-3281"></span></p><h3>The problem with <code>new URL()</code></h3><p>The “new” in front of new URL() indicates that it’s used as a constructor: calling it creates a new URL instance for you. When you give it a malformed URL however, one that it can’t parse, it throws an error. Because it throws an error, you need to write code to handle that error.</p><p>If you don’t do that, The thrown error won’t get handled and your JS stops being executed. The following code looks great but if <code>urlstring</code> is malformed, it will stop execution:</p><pre><code>const urlstring = "this is not a URL";
const not_a_url = new URL(urlstring);
// Uncaught TypeError: URL constructor: "this is not a URL" is not a valid URL.</code></pre><p>So you'll want to wrap it in a try...catch so that the error is caught.</p><pre><code>const urlstring = "this is not a URL";
let not_a_url;

try {
   not_a_url = new URL(urlstring);
} catch {
  // we catch and ignore the error
  // not_a_url is already undefined so no need to actually do anything.
}</code></pre><p>That's a lot more lines of code, has more visual noise and it means you have to change <code>not_a_url</code> from a <code>const</code> to a <code>let</code> to be able to overwrite it. The control flow of the application ends up being more complex.</p><h3>Making it slightly better</h3><p>A recent addition to the URL api is <code>URL.canParse()</code>, a function that returns true if the URL is a parseable URL.</p><p>It's only been available cross-browser <a href="https://caniuse.com/mdn-api_url_canparse_static">since December 2023</a> so it might be a little too early for general use, but it does make the code more readable.</p><p>Instead of trying and catching the error, we can first check if the URL is parseable before parsing it, and we can do that inline:</p><pre><code>const urlstring = "this is not a URL";

const not_a_url = URL.canParse(urlstring) &amp;&amp; new URL(urlstring);
// not_a_url = false</code></pre><p>This makes <code>not_a_url</code> a const again, and is definitely easier to understand.</p><h3>Complaining</h3><p>Rather than being constructive and writing my own little function to abstract that try...catch or canParse away from my regular code base, I decided to do the right thing and <a href="https://twitter.com/kilianvalkhof/status/1765312128188088454">complain on Twitter</a>:</p><blockquote><p> Making new URL() throw when you give it an invalid URL was a terrible API choice.</p></blockquote><p>Not much later Anne van Kesteren <a href="https://twitter.com/annevk/status/1767939562368569807">replied</a> with a link to a <a href="https://github.com/whatwg/url/issues/372">GitHub issue</a> discussing the addition of a "parse" function to URL that would not throw.</p><p>Anne added that issue in 2018 but my tweet <a href="https://github.com/whatwg/url/issues/372#issuecomment-1994704897">renewed interest</a>.

<p><img src="https://idlewords.com/images/artemis_cloud.jpg" width="100%" alt="distant photo of Artemis rocket on launch pad"></p>


<p>A little over 51 years ago, a rocket lifted off from Cape Canaveral carrying three astronauts and a space car.  After a three day journey to the moon, two of the astronauts climbed into a spindly lander and made the short trip down to the surface, where for another three days they collected rocks and did donuts in the space car. Then they climbed back into the lander,  rejoined their colleague in orbit, and departed for Earth. Their capsule splashed down in the South Pacific on December 19, 1972.  This mission, Apollo 17, would be the last time human beings ventured beyond low Earth orbit. 

</p><p>If you believe NASA, late in 2026 Americans will walk on the moon again. That proposed mission is called Artemis 3, and its lunar segment looks a lot like Apollo 17 without the space car. Two astronauts will land on the moon, collect rocks, take selfies, and about a week after landing rejoin their orbiting colleagues to go back to Earth. 

</p><p>But where Apollo 17 launched on a single rocket and cost $3.3 billion (in 2023 dollars), the first Artemis landing involves a dozen or two heavy rocket launches and costs so much that NASA refuses to give a figure (one veteran of NASA budgeting estimates it at $7-10 billion).<a id="fn_cost"></a><a href="#cost"><span><sup>[1]</sup></span></a>  The single-use lander for the mission will be the heaviest spacecraft ever flown, and yet the mission's scientific return—a small box of rocks—is less than what came home on Apollo 17. And the whole plan hinges on technologies that haven't been invented yet becoming reliable and practical within the next eighteen months. 

</p><p>You don’t have to be a rocket scientist to wonder what’s going on here. If we can put a man on the moon,  then why can't we just go do it again?  The moon hasn’t changed since the 1960’s, while every technology we used to get there  has seen staggering advances.  It took NASA eight years to go from nothing to a moon landing at the dawn of the Space Age. But today, twenty years and $93 billion after the space agency announced our return to the moon, the goal seems as far out of reach as ever.<a id="fn_nasatime"></a><a href="#nasatime"><span><sup>[2]</sup></span></a> 

</p><p>Articles about Artemis often give the program’s tangled backstory.   But I want to talk about Artemis as a technical design, because there’s just so much to drink in. While NASA is no stranger to complex mission architectures, Artemis goes beyond complex to the just plain incoherent. None of the puzzle pieces seem to come from the  same box. Half the program requires breakthrough technologies that make the other half unnecessary.  The rocket and spacecraft NASA spent two decades building can’t even reach the moon.  And for reasons no one understands, there’s a new space station in the mix.

</p><p>In the past, whatever oddball project NASA came up with, we at least knew they could build the hardware. But Artemis calls the agency’s competence as an engineering organization into question.  For the first time since the early 1960's, it's unclear whether the US space agency is even <i>capable</i> of putting astronauts on the Moon.

<p><b><a name="apollo">A Note on Apollo</a></b></p> 


<p>In this essay I make a lot of comparisons to Project Apollo. This is not because I think other mission architectures are inferior, but because the early success of that program sets such a useful baseline.  At the dawn of the Space Age, using rudimentary technology, American astronauts landed on the moon six times in seven attempts.  The moon landings were NASA’s greatest achievement and should set a floor for what a modern mission, flying modern hardware, might achieve.

</p><p>Advocates for Artemis insist that the program is more than Apollo 2.0. But as we’ll see, Artemis can't even measure up to Apollo 1.0. It costs more, does less, flies less frequently, and exposes crews to risks that the steely-eyed missile men of the Apollo era found unacceptable.   It's as if Ford in 2024 released a new model car that was slower,  more accident-prone, and ten times more expensive than the Model T.  

</p><p>When a next-generation lunar program can’t meet the cost, performance, or safety standards set three generations earlier, something has gone seriously awry.

</p><p><img src="https://idlewords.com/images/sls_image.jpg" width="100%" alt="Photograph of SLS rocket"></p>

<p><a name="sls"><b>I. The Rocket</b></a></p> 

<p>The jewel of Artemis is a big orange rocket with a flavorless name, the Space Launch System (SLS).  SLS looks like someone started building a Space Shuttle and ran out of legos for the orbiter. There is the familiar orange tank, a big white pair of solid rocket boosters, but then the rocket just peters out in a 1960’s style stack of cones and cylinders. 

</p><p>The best way to think of SLS is as a balding guy with a mullet: there are fireworks down below that are meant to distract you from a sad situation up top.  In the case of the rocket, those fireworks are a first stage with more thrust than the Saturn V, enough thrust that the boosted core stage can nearly put itself into orbit.  But on top of this monster sits a second stage so anemic that even its name (the Interim Cryogenic Propulsion Stage) is a kind of apology. For eight minutes SLS roars into the sky on a pillar of fire.  And then, like a cork popping out of a bottle, the tiny ICPS emerges and drifts vaguely moonwards on a wisp of flame. 

</p><p>With this design, the minds behind SLS achieved a first in space flight, creating a rocket that is at the same time more powerful and less capable than the Saturn V.  While the 1960’s giant could send 49 metric tons to the Moon,  SLS only manages 27 tons—not enough to fly an Apollo-style landing, not enough to even put a crew in orbit around the Moon without a lander. The best SLS can do is slingshot the Orion spacecraft once around the moon and back, a mission that will fly under the name Artemis 2.  

</p><p>NASA wants to replace ICPS with an ‘Exploration Upper Stage’  (the project has been held up, among other things, by a <a href="https://oig.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/IG-22-012.pdf">near-billion dollar cost overrun on a launch pad</a>). But even that upgrade won’t give SLS the power of the Saturn V.  For whatever reason, NASA designed its first heavy launcher in forty years to be unable to fly the simple, proven architecture of the Apollo missions.

</p><p>Of course, plenty of rockets go on to enjoy rewarding, productive careers without being as powerful as the Saturn V.   And if SLS rockets were piling up at the Michoud Assembly Facility like cordwood, or if NASA were willing to let its astronauts fly commercial, it would be a simple matter to split Artemis missions across multiple launches. 

</p><p>But NASA insists that astronauts fly SLS. And SLS is a “one and done” rocket, artisanally hand-crafted by a workforce that likes to get home before traffic gets bad. The rocket can only launch once every two years at a cost of about four billion dollars<a id="fn_slscost"></a><a href="#slscost"><span><sup>[3]</sup></span></a>—about twice what it would cost to light the rocket’s weight in dollar bills on fire<a id="fn_dollarbills"></a><a href="#dollarbills"><span><sup>[4]</sup></span></a>. 

</p><p>Early on, SLS designers made the catastrophic decision to reuse Shuttle hardware, which is like using Fabergé eggs to save money on an omelette.  The SLS core stage recycles Space Shuttle main engines, actual veterans of old Shuttle flights called out of retirement for one last job.  Refurbishing a single such engine to work on SLS costs NASA $40 million, or a bit more than SpaceX spends on all 33 engines on its Superheavy booster.<a id="fn_refurb"></a><a href="#refurb"><span><sup>[5]</sup></span></a> And though the Shuttle engines are designed to be fully reusable (the main reason they're so expensive), every SLS launch throws four of them away. Once all the junkyards are picked clean, NASA will pay Aerojet Rocketdyne to restart production of the classic engine at a cool unit cost of $145 million<a id="fn_rs25restart"></a><a href="#rs25restart"><span><sup>[6]</sup></span></a>. 

</p><p>The story is no better with the solid rocket boosters, the other piece of Shuttle hardware SLS reuses.  Originally a stopgap measure introduced to save the Shuttle budget, these heavy rockets now attach themselves like barnacles to every new NASA launcher design. To no one’s surprise, retrofitting a bunch of heavy steel casings left over from Shuttle days has saved the program nothing. Each SLS booster is now projected to cost $266 million, or about twice the launch cost of a Falcon Heavy.<a id="fn_fheavy"></a><a href="#fheavy"><span><sup>[7]</sup></span></a>  Just replacing the asbestos lining in the boosters with a greener material, a project budgeted at $4.4M, has now cost NASA a quarter of a billion dollars.  And once the leftover segments run out seven rockets from now,  SLS will need a brand new booster design, opening up fertile new vistas of overspending. 

</p><p>Costs on SLS have reached the point where private industry is now able to develop, test, and launch an entire rocket <i>program</i> for less than NASA spends on a single engine<a id="fn_electron"></a><a href="#electron"><span><sup>[8]</sup></span></a>.  Flying SLS is like owning a classic car—everything is hand built, the components cost a fortune, and when you finally get the thing out of the shop, you find yourself constantly overtaken by younger rivals. 

</p><p>But the cost of SLS to NASA goes beyond money.   The agency has committed to an antiquated frankenrocket just as the space industry is entering a period of unprecedented innovation. While other space programs get to romp and play with technologies like reusable stages and exotic alloys, NASA is stuck for years wasting a massive, skilled workforce on a dead-end design. 

</p><p>The SLS program's slow pace also affects safety. Back in the Shuttle era, NASA managers argued that it took three to four launches a year to keep workers proficient enough to build and launch the vehicles safely.  A boutique approach where workers hand-craft one rocket every two years  means having to re-learn processes and procedures with every launch.

</p><p>It also leaves no room in Artemis for test flights. The program simply assumes success, flying all its important 'firsts' with astronauts on board. When there are unanticipated failures, like the extensive heat shield spalling and near burn-through observed in Artemis 1,<a id="fn_heatshield"></a><a href="#heatshield"><span><sup>[9]</sup></span></a> the agency has no way to test a proposed fix without a multi-year delay to the program. So they end up using indirect means to convince themselves that a new design is safe to fly, a process ripe for error and self-delusion.




</p><p><img src="https://idlewords.com/images/orion_oversize.jpg" width="100%" alt="Orion space capsule with OVERSIZE LOAD banner"></p>

<p><b><a name="Orion">II. The Spacecraft</a></b></p> 


<p>Orion, the capsule that launches on top of SLS, is a relaxed-fit reimagining of the Apollo command module suitable for today’s larger astronaut. It boasts modern computers, half again as much volume as the 1960’s design, and a few creature comforts (like not having to poop in a baggie) that would have pleased the Apollo pioneers.

</p><p>The capsule’s official name is the Orion Multipurpose Crew Vehicle, but finding even a single purpose for Orion has greatly challenged NASA.  For twenty years the spacecraft has mostly sat on the ground, chewing through a $1.2 billion annual budget. In 2014, the first Orion flew a brief test flight. Eight short years later, Orion launched again, carrying a crew of instrumented mannequins around the Moon on Artemis 1.  In 2025 the capsule (by then old enough to drink) is supposed to fly  human passengers on Artemis 2. 

</p><p>Orion goes to space attached to a basket of amenities called the European Service Module. The ESM provides Orion with solar panels, breathing gas, batteries, and a small rocket that is the capsule’s principal means of propulsion. But because the ESM was never designed to go to the moon, it carries very little propellant—far too little to get the hefty capsule in and out of lunar orbit.<a id="fn_oriondeltav"></a><a href="#oriondeltav"><span><sup>[10]</sup></span></a>   

</p><p>And Orion is hefty. Originally designed to hold six astronauts, the capsule was never resized when the crew requirement shrank to four.  Like an empty nester’s minivan, Orion now hauls around a bunch of mass and volume that it doesn’t need. Even with all the savings that come from replacing Apollo-era avionics, the capsule weighs almost twice as much as the Apollo Command Module. 

</p><p>This extra mass has knock-on effects across the entire Artemis design. Since a large capsule needs a large abort rocket, SLS has to haul Orion's massive Launch Abort System—seven tons of dead weight—nearly all the way into orbit. And reinforcing the capsule so that abort system won't shake the astronauts into jelly means making it heavier, which puts more demand on the parachutes and heat shield,<a id="fn_heatshield"></a><a href="#heatshield"><span><sup>[11]</sup></span></a> and around and around we go. 

</p><p><img src="https://idlewords.com/images/csm_orion_esm.jpg" width="100%" alt="Orion space capsule with OVERSIZE LOAD banner"></p>

<p>Size comparison of the Apollo command and service module (left) and Orion + European Service Module (right)</p>

<div><p>What’s particularly frustrating is that Orion and ESM together have nearly the same mass as the Apollo command and service modules, which had no trouble reaching the Moon.  The difference is all in the proportions. Where Apollo was built like a roadster, with a small crew compartment bolted onto an oversized engine, Orion is the Dodge Journey of spacecraft—a chunky, underpowered six-seater that advertises to the world that you're terrible at managing money.

</p></div><p><img src="https://idlewords.com/images/nrho.jpg" width="100%" alt="diagram of near-rectilinear halo orbit"></p>

<p><b><a name="orbit">III. The Orbit</a></b></p> 

<p>The fact that neither its rocket or spaceship can get to the Moon creates difficulties for NASA’s lunar program.  So, like an aging crooner transposing old hits into an easier key, the agency has worked to find a ‘lunar-adjacent’ destination that its hardware can get to.

</p><p>Their solution is a bit of celestial arcana called Near Rectilinear Halo Orbit, or NRHO.  A spacecraft in this orbit circles the moon every 6.5 days, passing 1,000 kilometers above the lunar north pole at closest approach, then drifting out about 70,000 kilometers (a fifth of the Earth/Moon distance) at its furthest point.  Getting to NRHO from Earth requires significantly less energy than entering a  useful lunar orbit, putting it just within reach for SLS and Orion.<a id="fn_nrho"></a><a href="#nrho"><span><sup>[12]</sup></span></a>


</p><p>To hear NASA tell it, NRHO is so full of advantages that it’s a wonder we stay on Earth.  Spacecraft in the orbit always have a sightline to Earth and never pass through its shadow. The orbit is relatively stable, so a spacecraft can loiter there for months using only ion thrusters. And the deep space environment is the perfect place to practice going to Mars. 

</p><p>But NRHO is terrible for getting to the moon. The orbit is like one of those European budget airports that leaves you out in a field somewhere, requiring an expensive taxi.  In Artemis, this taxi takes the form of a whole other spaceship—the lunar lander—which launches without a crew a month or two before Orion and is supposed to be waiting in NRHO when the capsule arrives. 

 </p><p>Once these two spacecraft dock together, two astronauts climb into the lander from Orion and begin a day-long descent to the lunar surface. The other two astronauts wait for them in NRHO, playing hearts and quietly absorbing radiation.

</p><p>Apollo landings also divided the crew between lander and orbiter. But those missions kept the command module in a low lunar orbit that brought it over the landing site every two hours.  This proximity between orbiter and lander had enormous implications for safety. At any point in the surface mission, the astronauts on the moon could climb into the ascent rocket, hit the big red button, and be back sipping Tang with the command module pilot by bedtime.  The short orbital period also gave the combined crew a dozen opportunities a day to return directly to Earth. <a id="fn_abort"></a><a href="#abort"><span><sup>[13]</sup></span></a>

</p><p>Sitting in NRHO makes abort scenarios much harder. Depending on when in the mission it happens, a stricken lander might need three or more days to catch up with the orbiting Orion. In the worst case, the crew might find themselves stuck on the lunar surface for hours after an abort is called, forced to wait for Orion to reach a more favorable point in its orbit. And once everyone is back on Orion, more days might pass before the crew can depart for Earth. These long and variable abort times significantly increase risk to the crew, making many scenarios that were survivable on Apollo (like Apollo 13!) lethal on Artemis. <a id="fn_abortnrho"></a><a href="#abortnrho"><span><sup>[14]</sup></span></a>

</p><p>The abort issue is just one example of  NRHO making missions slower.  NASA likes to boast that Orion can stay in space far longer than Apollo, but this is like bragging that you’re in the best shape of your life after the bank repossessed your car.  It's an oddly positive spin to put on bad life choices. The reason Orion needs all that endurance is because transit times from Earth to NRHO are long, and the crew has to waste additional time in NRHO waiting for orbits to line up.  The Artemis 3 mission, for example, will spend 24 days in transit, compared to just 6 days on Apollo 11. 

</p><p>NRHO even dictates how long astronauts stay on the Moon—surface time has to be a multiple of the 6.5 day orbital period. This lack of flexibility means that even early flag-and-footprints missions like Artemis 3 have to spend at least a week on the moon, a constraint that adds considerable risk to the initial landing.  <a id="fn_landingrisk"></a><a href="#landingrisk"><span><sup>[15]</sup></span></a>

</p><p>In spaceflight, brevity is safety. There's no better way to protect astronauts  from the risks of solar storms, mechanical failure, and other mishaps than by minimizing slack time in space. Moreover, a safe architecture should allow for a rapid return to Earth at any point in the mission.   There’s no question astronauts on the first Artemis missions would be better off with Orion in low lunar orbit. The decision to stage from NRHO is an excellent example of NASA designing its lunar program in the wrong direction—letting deficiencies in the hardware dictate the level of mission risk.

</p><p><img src="https://idlewords.com/images/gateway_diagram.jpg" width="100%" alt="diagram of Gateway"></p>
<p>Early diagram of Gateway. Note that the segment marked 'human lander system' now dwarfs the space station.</p>

<p><b><a name="gateway">IV. Gateway</a></b></p> 

<p>I suppose at some point we have to talk about Gateway.  Gateway is a small modular space station that NASA wants to build in NRHO.  It has been showing up across various missions like a bad smell since before 2012.  

</p><p>Early in the Artemis program, NASA described Gateway as a kind of celestial truck stop, a safe place for the lander to park and for the crew to grab a cup of coffee on their way to the moon.  But when it became clear that Gateway would not be ready in time for Artemis 3, NASA re-evaluated.  Reasoning that two spacecraft could meet up in NRHO just as easily as three, the agency gave permission for the first moon landing to proceed without a space station.

</p><p>Despite this open admission that Gateway is unnecessary, building the space station remains the core activity of the Artemis program. The three missions that follow that first landing are devoted chiefly to Gateway assembly.  In fact, initial plans for Artemis 4 left out a lunar landing entirely, as if it were an inconvenience to the real work being done up in orbit.

</p><p>This is a remarkable situation. It’s like if you hired someone to redo your kitchen and they started building a boat in your driveway. Sure, the boat gives the builders a place to relax, lets them practice tricky plumbing and finishing work, and is a safe place to store their tools. But all those arguments will fail to satisfy. You still want to know what building a boat has to do with kitchen repair, and why you’re the one footing the bill. 

</p><p>NASA has struggled to lay out a technical rationale for Gateway. The space station adds both cost and complexity to Artemis, a program not particularly lacking in either.  Requiring moon-bound astronauts to stop at Gateway also makes missions riskier (by adding docking operations) while imposing a big propellant tax. Aerospace engineer and pundit Robert Zubrin has aptly called the station a tollbooth in space.  

</p><p>Even Gateway defenders struggle to hype up the station. A common argument is that Gateway may not ideal for any one thing, but is good for a whole lot of things. But that is the same line of thinking that got us SLS and Orion, both vehicles designed before anyone knew what to do with them. The truth is that all-purpose designs don't exist in human space flight. The best you can do is build a spacecraft that is equally bad at everything. 
 
</p><p>But to search for technical grounds is to misunderstand the purpose of Gateway.  The station is not being built to shelter astronauts in the harsh environment of space, but to protect Artemis in the harsh environment of Congress. NASA needs Gateway to navigate an uncertain political landscape in the 2030’s. Without a station, Artemis will just be a series of infrequent multibillion dollar moon landings, a red cape waved in the face of the Office of Management and Budget.  Gateway armors Artemis by bringing in international partners, each of whom contributes expensive hardware. As NASA learned building the International Space Station, this combination of sunk costs and international entanglement is a powerful talisman against program death.   

</p><p>Gateway also solves some other problems for NASA.  It gives SLS a destination to fly to, stimulates private industry (by handing out public money to supply Gateway), creates a job for the astronaut corps, and guarantees the continuity of human space flight once the ISS becomes uninhabitable sometime in the 2030’s. <a id="fn_iss"></a><a href="#iss"><span><sup>[16]</sup></span></a>


</p><p>That last goal may sound odd if you don’t see human space flight as an end in itself.  But NASA is a faith-based organization, dedicated to the principle that taxpayers should always keep an American or two in orbit.  it’s a little bit as if the National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration insisted on keeping bathyscapes full of sailors at the bottom of the sea, irrespective of cost or merit, and kneecapped programs that might threaten the continuous human benthic presence. You can’t argue with faith.

</p><p>From a bureaucrat’s perspective, Gateway is NASA’s ticket back to a golden era in the early 2000's when the Space Station and Space Shuttle formed an uncancellable whole, each program justifying the existence of the other.  Recreating this dynamic with Gateway and SLS/Orion would mean predictable budgets and program stability for NASA well into the 2050’s.  

</p><p>But Artemis was supposed to take us back to a different golden age, the golden age of Apollo.  And so there’s an unresolved tension in the program between building Gateway and  doing interesting things on the moon. With Artemis missions two or more years apart, it’s inevitable that Gateway assembly will push aspirational projects like a surface habitat or pressurized rover out into the 2040’s. But those same projects are on the critical path to Mars, where NASA still insists we’re going in the late 2030’s. The situation is awkward.

</p><p>So that is the story of Gateway—unloved, ineradicable, and as we’ll see, likely to become the sole legacy of the Artemis program.

</p><p><img src="https://idlewords.com/images/pointy_rocket.jpg" width="100%" alt="artist's rendering of human landing system'"></p>

<p><b><a name="lander">V. The Lander</a></b></p> 

<p>The lunar lander is the most technically ambitious part of Artemis.  Where SLS, Orion, and Gateway are mostly a compilation of NASA's greatest hits, the lander requires breakthrough technologies with the potential to revolutionize space travel. 

</p><p>Of course, you can’t just call it a lander.  In Artemis speak, this spacecraft is the Human Landing System, or HLS. NASA has delegated its design to two private companies, Blue Origin and SpaceX.  SpaceX is responsible for landing astronauts on Artemis 3 and 4, while Blue Origin is on the hook for Artemis 5 (notionally scheduled for 2030).  After that, the agency will take competitive bids for subsequent missions. 

</p><p>The SpaceX HLS design is based on their experimental Starship spacecraft, an enormous rocket that takes off on and lands on its tail, like 1950’s sci-fi.   There is a strong “emperor’s new clothes” vibe to this design.  On the one hand, it is the brainchild of brilliant SpaceX engineers and passed NASA technical review. On the other hand, the lander seems to go out of its way to create problems for itself to solve with technology.

<p>An early SpaceX rendering of the Human Landing System, with the Apollo Lunar Module added for scale.</p> 


<p>To start with the obvious, HLS looks more likely to tip over than the last two spacecraft to land on the moon, which <a href="https://www.space.com/intuitive-machines-odysseus-moon-lander-tipped-over">tipped</a> <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/japanese-moon-lander-reaches-surface-but-fate-uncertain/">over</a>.   It is a fifteen story tower that must land on its ass in terrible lighting conditions, on rubble of unknown composition, over a light-second from Earth.  The crew are left suspended so high above the surface that they need a folding space elevator (not the cool kind) to get down.  And yet in the end this single-use lander carries less payload (both up and down) than the tiny Lunar Module on Apollo 17. Using Starship to land two astronauts on the moon is like delivering a pizza with an aircraft carrier. 

</p><p>Amusingly, the sheer size of the SpaceX design leaves it with little room for cargo.  The spacecraft arrives on the Moon laden with something like 200 tons of cryogenic propellant,<a id="fn_hlsprop"></a><a href="#hlsprop"><span><sup>[14]</sup></span></a> and like a fat man leaving an armchair, it needs every drop of that energy to get its bulk back off the surface.  Nor does it help matters that all this cryogenic propellant has to cook for a week in direct sunlight.

</p><p>Other, less daring lander designs reduce their appetite for propellant by using a detachable landing stage. This arrangement also shields the ascent rocket from hypervelocity debris that gets kicked up during landing.  But HLS is a one-piece rocket; the same engines that get sandblasted on their way down to the moon must relight without fail a week later. 

 </p><p>Given this fact, it’s remarkable that NASA’s contract with SpaceX doesn’t require them to demonstrate a lunar takeoff. All SpaceX has to do to satisfy NASA requirements is land an HLS prototype on the Moon.  Questions about ascent can then presumably wait until the actual mission, when we all find out together with the crew whether HLS can take off again.<a id="fn_ascent"></a><a href="#ascent"><span><sup>[15]</sup></span></a>

</p><p>This fearlessness in design is part of a pattern with Starship HLS.  Problems that other landers avoid in the design phase are solved with engineering.  And it’s kind of understandable why SpaceX does it this way. Starship is meant to fly to Mars, a much bigger challenge than landing two people on the Moon. If the basic Starship design can’t handle a lunar landing, it would throw the company’s whole Mars plan into question. SpaceX is committed to making Starship work, which is different from making the best possible lunar lander.

</p><p>Less obvious is why NASA tolerates all this complexity in the most hazardous phase of its first moon mission. Why land a rocket the size of a building packed with moving parts?  It’s hard to look at the HLS design and not think back to other times when a room full of smart NASA people talked themselves into taking major risks because the alternative was not getting to fly at all. 

</p><p>It’s instructive to compare the HLS approach to the design philosophy on Apollo. Engineers on that progam were motivated by terror; no one wanted to make the mistake that would leave astronauts stranded on the moon.  The weapon they used to knock down risk was simplicity. The Lunar Module was a small metal box with a wide stance, built low enough so that the astronauts only needed to climb down a short ladder. The bottom half of the LM was a descent stage that completely covered the ascent rocket (a design that showed its value on Apollo 15, when one of the descent engines got <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Descent_propulsion_system#/media/File:Apollo_15_Engine_Bell.jpg">smushed by a rock</a>).   And that ascent rocket, the most important piece of hardware in the lander, was a caveman design intentionally made so primitive that it  would struggle to find ways to fail.  

</p><p>On Artemis, it's the other way around: the more hazardous the mission phase, the more complex the hardware. It's hard to look at all this lunar machinery and feel reassured, especially when NASA's own Aerospace Safety Advisory Panel estimates that the Orion/SLS portion of a moon mission alone (not including anything to do with HLS) already <a href="https://oiir.hq.nasa.gov/asap/documents/2014_ASAP_Annual_Report.pdf">has a 1:75 chance</a> of killing the crew.

<p><b><a name="refueling">VI. Refueling</a></b></p> 



<p>Since NASA’s biggest rocket struggles to get Orion into distant lunar orbit, and HLS weighs fifty times as much as Orion, the curious reader might wonder how the unmanned lander is supposed to get up there.

</p><p>NASA’s answer is, very sensibly, “not our problem”. They are paying Blue Origin and SpaceX the big bucks to figure this out on their own. And as a practical matter, the only way to put such a massive spacecraft into NRHO is to first refuel it in low Earth orbit. 

</p><p>Like a lot of space technology, orbital refueling sounds simple, has never been attempted, and can’t be adequately simulated on Earth.<a id="fn_refuel"></a><a href="#refuel"><span><sup>[18]</sup></span></a>  The crux of the problem is that liquid and gas phases in microgravity jumble up into a three-dimensional mess, so that even measuring the quantity of propellant in a tank becomes difficult.  To make matters harder, Starship uses cryogenic propellants that boil at temperatures about a hundred degrees colder than the plumbing they need to move through.  Imagine trying to pour water from a thermos into a red-hot skillet while falling off a cliff and you get some idea of the difficulties. 

</p><p>To get refueling working, SpaceX will first have to demonstrate propellant transfer between rockets as a proof of concept, and then get the process working reliably and efficiently at a scale of hundreds of tons. (These are two distinct challenges).  Once they can routinely move liquid oxygen and methane from Starship A to Starship B, they’ll be ready to set up the infrastructure they need to launch HLS. 


</p><p><img src="https://idlewords.com/images/fueling_conops.jpg" width="100%" alt="artist's rendering of human landing system'"></p>

<p>The plan for getting HLS to the moon looks like this: a few months before the landing date, SpaceX will launch a special variant of their Starship rocket configured to serve as a propellant depot. Then they'll start launching Starships one by one to fill it up. Each Starship arrives in low Earth orbit with some residual propellant; it will need to dock with the depot rocket and transfer over this remnant fuel.   Once the depot is full, SpaceX will launch HLS, have it fill its tanks at the depot rocket, and send it up to NRHO in advance of Orion. When Orion arrives, HLS will hopefully have enough propellant left on board to take on astronauts and make a single round trip from NRHO to the lunar surface.

</p><p>Getting this plan to work requires solving a second engineering problem, how to keep cryogenic propellants cold in space.  Low earth orbit is a toasty place, and without special measures, the cryogenic propellants Starship uses will quickly vent off into space.  The problem is easy to solve in deep space (use a sunshade), but becomes tricky in low Earth orbit, where a warm rock covers a third of the sky.  (Boil-off is also a big issue for HLS on the moon.)


</p><p> It’s not clear how many Starship launches it will take to refuel HLS.  Elon Musk has said four launches might be enough; NASA Assistant Deputy Associate Administrator Lakiesha Hawkins says the number is in the “high teens”.  Last week, SpaceX's Kathy Lueders <a href="https://youtu.be/vOg49BVhU40?si=6q8R2qvkmEDPGy0V&amp;t=2381">gave a figure of fifteen launches</a>.

</p><p>The real number is unknown and will come down to four factors:

</p><ol>
<li>How much propellant a Starship can carry to low Earth orbit.</li>

<li>What fraction of that can be usably pumped out of the rocket. </li>

<li>How quickly cryogenic propellant boils away from the orbiting depot.</li>

<li>How rapidly SpaceX can launch Starships.</li>
</ol>

<p>SpaceX probably knows the answer to (1), but isn’t talking.  Data for (2) and (3) will have to wait for flight tests that are planned for 2025.  And obviously a lot is riding on (4), also called launch cadence.  

</p><p>The record for heavy rocket launch cadence belongs to Saturn V, which launched three times during a four month period in 1968.  Second place belongs to the Space Shuttle, which flew nine times in the calendar year before the Challenger disaster. In third place is Falcon Heavy, which flew six times in a 13 month period beginning in November 2022. 

</p><p>For the refueling plan to work, Starship will have to break this record by a factor of ten, launching every six days or so across multiple launch facilities. <a id="fn_cadence"></a><a href="#cadence"><span><sup>[1]</sup></span></a>  The refueling program can tolerate a few launch failures, as long as none of them damages a launch pad. 

</p><p>There’s no company better prepared to meet this challenge than SpaceX. Their Falcon 9 rocket has shattered records for both reliability and cadence, and now launches about once every three days.  But it took SpaceX ten years to get from the first orbital Falcon 9 flight to a weekly cadence, and Starship is vastly bigger and more complicated than the Falcon 9. <a id="fn_falcon9"></a><a href="#falcon9"><span><sup>[20]</sup></span></a>

</p><p>Working backwards from the official schedule allows us to appreciate the time pressure facing SpaceX. To make the official Artemis landing date, SpaceX has to land an unmanned HLS prototype on the moon in early 2026. That means tanker flights to fill an orbiting depot would start in late 2025.  This doesn’t leave a lot of time for the company to invent orbital refueling, get it working at scale, make it efficient, deal with boil-off, get Starship launching reliably, begin recovering booster stages,<a id="fn_recovery"></a><a href="#recovery"><span><sup>[21]</sup></span></a> set up additional launch facilities, achieve a weekly cadence,  and at the same time design and test all the other systems that need to go into HLS. 

</p><p>Lest anyone think I’m picking on SpaceX, the development schedule for Blue Origin’s 2029 lander is even more fantastical. That design requires pumping tons of liquid hydrogen between spacecraft in lunar orbit, a challenge perhaps an order of magnitude harder than what SpaceX is attempting. Liquid hydrogen is bulky, boils near absolute zero, and is infamous for its ability to leak through anything (the Shuttle program couldn't get a handle on hydrogen leaks on Earth even after a hundred some launches).  And the rocket Blue Origin needs to test all this technology has never left the ground. 

</p><p>The upshot is that NASA has put a pair of last-minute long-shot technology development programs between itself and the moon.  Particularly striking is the contrast between the ambition of the HLS designs and the extreme conservatism and glacial pace of SLS/Orion.  The same organization that spent 23 years and 20 billion dollars building the world's most vanilla spacecraft demands that SpaceX darken the sky with Starships within four years of signing the initial HLS contract. While thrilling for SpaceX fans, this is pretty unserious behavior from the nation’s space agency, which had several decades' warning that going to the moon would require a lander. 

</p><p>All this to say, it's universally understood that there won’t be a moon landing in 2026. At some point NASA will have to officially slip the schedule, as it did in 2021, 2023, and at the start of this year.  If this accelerating pattern of delays continues, by year’s end we might reach a state of continuous postponement, a kind of scheduling singularity where the landing date for Artemis 3 recedes smoothly and continuously into the future. 

</p><p>Otherwise, it's hard to imagine a manned lunar landing before 2030, if the Artemis program survives that long.


</p><p><img src="https://idlewords.com/images/artemis_cart.jpg" width="100%" alt="Interior of Skylab"></p>

<p><b><a name="conclusion">VII. Conclusion</a></b></p>

<p>I want to stress that there’s nothing wrong with NASA making big bets on technology.  Quite the contrary, the audacious HLS contracts may be the healthiest thing about Artemis. Visionaries at NASA identified a futuristic new energy source (space billionaire egos) and found a way to tap it on a fixed-cost basis.  If SpaceX or Blue Origin figure out how to make cryogenic refueling practical, it will mean a big step forward for space exploration, exactly the thing NASA should be encouraging. And if the technology doesn’t pan out, we’ll have found that out mostly by spending Musk’s and Bezos’s money.  

</p><p>The real problem with Artemis is that it doesn’t think through the consequences of its own success.  A working infrastructure for orbital refueling would make SLS and Orion superfluous.  Instead of waiting two years to go up on a $4 billion rocket, crews and cargo could launch every weekend on cheap commercial rockets, refueling in low Earth orbit on their way to the Moon. A similar logic holds for Gateway.  Why assemble a space station out of habitrail pieces out in lunar orbit, like an animal, when you can build one on Earth and launch it in one piece? Better yet, just spraypaint “<b>GATEWAY</b>” on the side of the nearest Starship, send it out to NRHO, and save NASA and its international partners billions.  Having a working gas station in low Earth orbit fundamentally changes what is possible, in a way the SLS/Orion arm of Artemis doesn't seem to recognize.

</p><p>Conversely, if SpaceX and Blue Origin can’t make cryogenic refueling work, then NASA has no plan B for landing on the moon. All the Artemis program will be able to do is assemble Gateway.  Promising taxpayers the moon only to deliver ISS Jr. does not broadcast a message of national greatness, and is unlikely to get Congress excited about going to Mars.  The hurtful comparisons between American dynamism in the 1960’s and whatever it is we have now will practically write themselves. 

</p><p>What NASA is doing is like an office worker blowing half their salary on lottery tickets while putting the other half in a pension fund.  If the lottery money comes through, then there was really no need for the pension fund. But without the lottery win, there’s not enough money in the pension account to retire on. The two strategies don't make sense together.

</p><p>There’s a ‘realist’ school of space flight that concedes all this but asks us to look at the bigger picture. We’re never going to have the perfect space program, the argument goes, but the important thing is forward progress. And Artemis is the first program in years to survive a presidential transition and have a shot at getting us beyond low Earth orbit.  With Artemis still funded, and Starship making rapid progress, at some point we’ll finally see American astronauts back on the moon.

</p><p>But this argument has two flaws. The first is that it feeds a cycle of dysfunction at NASA that is rapidly making it impossible for us to go anywhere.    Holding human space flight to a different standard than NASA’s science missions has been a disaster for space exploration.  Right now the Exploration Systems Development Mission Directorate (the entity responsible for manned space flight) couldn’t build a toaster for less than a billion dollars.  Incompetence, self-dealing, and mismanagement that end careers on the science side of NASA are not just tolerated but rewarded on the human space flight side.  Before we let the agency build out its third white elephant project in forty years,  it’s worth reflecting on what we're getting in return for half our exploration budget.

</p><p>The second, more serious flaw in the “realist” approach is that it enables a culture of institutional mendacity that must ultimately be fatal at an engineering organization. We've reached a point where NASA lies constantly, to both itself and to the public. It lies about schedules and capabilities. It lies about the costs and the benefits of its human spaceflight program. And above all, it lies about risk. All the institutional pathologies identified in the Rogers Report and the Columbia Accident Investigation Board are alive and well in Artemis—groupthink, management bloat, intense pressure to meet impossible deadlines, and a willingness to manufacture engineering rationales to justify flying unsafe hardware.

</p><div><p>Do we really have to wait for another tragedy, and another beautifully produced Presidential Commission report, to see that Artemis is broken? 

</p></div><p><b><a name="notes">Notes</a></b></p>



<p><a id="cost"></a><a href="#fn_cost">[1]</a>  Without NASA's help, it's hard to put a dollar figure on a mission without making somewhat arbitrary decisions about what to include and exclude. The $7-10 billion estimate comes from a Bush-era official in the Office of Management and Budget commenting <a href="https://forum.nasaspaceflight.com/index.php?topic=60228.msg2559545#msg2559545">on the NASA Spaceflight Forum</a>

</p><blockquote>
And that $7.2B assumes Artemis III stays on schedule.  Based on the FY24 budget request, each additional year between Artemis II and Artemis III adds another $3.5B to $4.0B in Common Exploration to Artemis III.  If Artemis III goes off in 2027, then it will be $10.8B total.  If 2028, then $14.3B.
</blockquote>

 <p>In other words, it's hard to break out an actual cost while the launch dates for both Artemis II and III keep slipping.
 
 </p><p>NASA's own Inspector General estimates the cost of <a href="https://oig.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/IG-22-003.pdf">just the SLS/Orion portion</a> of a moon landing at $4.1 billion. 


</p><p><a id="nasatime"></a><a href="#fn_nasatime">[2]</a>  The first US suborbital flight, Friendship 7, launched on May 15, 1961. Armstrong and Aldrin landed on the moon eight years and two months later, on July 21, 1969.  President Bush announced the goal of returning to the Moon in a January 2004 speech, setting the target date for the first landing "as early as 2015", and no later than 2020.

</p><p><a id="slscost"></a><a href="#fn_slscost">[3]</a> NASA refuses to track the per-launch cost of SLS, so it's easy to get into nerdfights. Since the main cost driver on SLS is the gigantic workforce employed on the project, something like two or three times the headcount of SpaceX, the cost per launch depends a lot on cadence.    If you assume a yearly launch rate (the official line), then the rocket costs $2.1 billion a launch. If like me you think one launch every two years is optimistic, the cost climbs up into the $4-5 billion range.   


</p><p><a id="dollarbills"></a><a href="#fn_dollarbills">[4]</a> The SLS weighs 2,600 metric tons fully fueled, and conveniently enough a dollar bill weighs about 1 gram. 

</p><p><a id="refurb"></a><a href="#fn_refurb">[5]</a> SpaceX does not disclose the cost, but it's widely assumed the Raptor engine used on Superheavy costs $1 million.   



</p><p><a id="rs25restart"></a><a href="#fn_rs25restart">[6]</a>  The $145 million figure comes from <a href="https://spacenews.com/aerojet-rocketdyne-defends-sls-engine-contract-costs/">dividing the contract cost by the number of engines</a>, caveman style. Others have reached a figure of $100 million for the unit cost of these engines. The important point is not who is right but the fact that NASA is paying vastly more than anyone else for engines of this class.


</p><p><a id="fheavy"></a><a href="#fn_fheavy">[7]</a> $250M is the figure you get by dividing the $3.2 billion Booster Production and Operations contract to Northrop Grumman by the number of boosters (12) in the contract.

</p><p><a id="heatshield"></a><a href="#fn_heatshield">[9]</a> In particular, the separation bolts embedded in the Orion heat shield were built based on a flawed thermal model, and need to be redesigned to safely fly a crew. From <a href="https://oig.nasa.gov/office-of-inspector-general-oig/audit-reports/nasas-readiness-for-the-artemis-ii-crewed-mission-to-lunar-orbit/">the OIG report</a>:

</p><blockquote>
Separation bolt melt beyond the thermal barrier during reentry can expose the vehicle to hot gas ingestion behind the heat shield, exceeding Orion’s structural limits and resulting in the breakup of the vehicle and loss of crew. Post-flight inspections determined there was a discrepancy in the thermal model used to predict the bolts’ performance pre-flight. Current predictions using the correct information suggest the bolt melt exceeds the design capability of Orion.
</blockquote>

<p>The current plan is to work around these problems on Artemis 2, and then redesign the components for Artemis 3. That means astronauts have to fly at least twice with an untested heat shield design. 




</p><p><a id="oriondeltav"></a><a href="#fn_oriondeltav">[10]</a> 
Orion/ESM has a delta V budget of 1340 m/s. Getting into and out of an equatorial low lunar orbit takes about 1800 m/s, more for a polar orbit.  (See <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/nrho-artemis-orbit.pdf">source</a>.)

</p><p><a id="nrho"></a><a href="#fn_nrho">[11]</a> 
It takes about 900 m/s of total delta V to get in and out of NHRO, comfortably within Orion/ESM's 1340 m/s budget.  (See <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/nrho-artemis-orbit.pdf">source</a>.)

</p><p><a id="abort"></a><a href="#fn_abort">[12]</a> 
In <i>Carrying the Fire</i>, Apollo 11 astronaut Michael Collins recalls carrying a small notebook covering 18 lunar rendezvous scenarios he might be called on to fly in various contingencies. If the Lunar Module could get itself off the surface, there was probably a way to dock with it.

</p><p>For those too young to remember, Tang is a powdered orange drink <a href="https://www.foodandwine.com/lifestyle/how-nasa-made-tang-cool">closely associated</a> with the American space program. 


</p><p><a id="abortnrho"></a><a href="#fn_abortnrho">[13]</a> For a detailed (if somewhat cryptic) discussion of possible Artemis abort modes to NRHO, see <a href="https://ntrs.nasa.gov/api/citations/20230002566/downloads/HLS%20NRHO%20to%20Lunar%20Surface%20and%20Back%20Mission%20Design_STRIVES.pptx.pdf">HLS NRHO to Lunar Surface and
Back Mission Design</a>, NASA 2022.

</p><p><a id="hlsprop"></a><a href="#fn_hlsprop">[14]</a> This is my own speculative guess; the answer is very sensitive to the dry weight of HLS and the boil-off rate of its cryogenic propellants. Delta V from the lunar surface to NRHO is 2,610 m/sec.  Assuming HLS weighs 120 tons unfueled, it would need about 150 metric tons of propellant to get into NRHO from the lunar surface. Adding safety margin, fuel for docking operations, and allowing for a week of boiloff gets me to about 200 tons. 

</p><p><a id="landingrisk"></a><a href="#fn_landingrisk">[15]</a>
The main safety issue is the difficult thermal environment at the landing site, where the Sun sits just above the horizon, heating half the lander. If it weren't for the NRHO constraint, it's very unlikely Artemis 3 would spend more than a day or two on the lunar surface. 

</p><p><a id="iss"></a><a href="#fn_iss">[16]</a>
The ISS program has been repeatedly extended, but the station is coming up against physical limiting factors (like metal fatigue) that will soon make it too dangerous to use.

</p><p><a id="ascent"></a><a href="#fn_ascent">[17]</a>
Recent comments by NASA suggest SpaceX has <a href="https://twitter.com/jeff_foust/status/1783877352432263175">voluntarily added an ascent phase</a> to its landing demo, ending a pretty untenable situation. However, there's still no requirement that the unmanned landing/ascent demo be performed using the same lander design that will fly on the actual mission, another oddity in the HLS contract.


</p><p><a id="refuel"></a><a href="#fn_refuel">[18]</a>
To be precise, I'm talking about moving bulk propellant between rockets in orbit. There are resupply flights to the International Space Station that deliver about 850 kilograms of non-cryogenic propellant to boost the station in its orbit, and there have been small-scale experiments in refueling satellites. But no one has attempted refueling a flown rocket stage in space, cryogenic or otherwise. 



</p><p><a id="cadence"></a><a href="#fn_cadence">[19]</a>

Both SpaceX's <a href="https://youtu.be/vOg49BVhU40?si=6q8R2qvkmEDPGy0V&amp;t=2381" "="">Kathy Lueders</a> and NASA confirm Starship needs to launch from multiple sites.  Here's an excerpt from <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/heoc-november-2023-final-v2.pdf">the minutes</a> of the NASA Advisory Council Human Exploration and Operations Committee meeting on November 17 and 20, 2023:

</p><blockquote>
Mr. [Wayne] Hale asked where Artemis III will launch from. [Assistant Deputy AA for Moon to Mars Lakiesha] Hawkins said that launch pads will be used in Florida and potentially Texas. The missions will need quite a number of tankers; in order to meet the schedule, there will need to be a rapid succession of launches of fuel, requiring more than one site for launches on a 6-day rotation schedule, and multiples of launches. 
</blockquote>


<p><a id="falcon9"></a><a href="#fn_falcon9">[20]</a> Falcon 9 first flew in June of 2010 and achieved a weekly launch cadence over a span of six launches starting in November 2020. 


</p><p><a id="recovery"></a><a href="#fn_recovery">[21]</a> Recovering Superheavy stages is not a NASA requirement for HLS, but it's a huge cost driver for SpaceX given the number of launches involved.

Nevertheless, the customer was charged $277.39 despite returning the car with the exact same charge they left with, and Hertz refused to refund it until after our story ran.</p><p>It's no isolated incident either, as other customers have written in to inform us that it happened to them, too.</p><figure data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="1" data-og-block-type="core/image"><span data-rawhtml="1">A lineup of Hertz Polestar 2 EVs. <em>Hertz</em> </span></figure><p>Evan Froehlich told us that when he booked a Tesla Model 3 Long Range, his problems began well before it came time to return the car. On pickup, he was told the Long Range model he'd reserved was unavailable, and that he'd been downgraded to a standard-range model. He had to go to a manager to get any recourse, which ended up being just a $22 discount.</p><p>Froehlich returned the rental at 21 percent charge, expecting to pay a flat $25 recharge fee. (It's ordinarily $35, but Hertz's loyalty program discounts it.) To Froehlich's surprise, he was hit with a $340.97 "Skip the Pump" fee, which can be applied after returning a car if it's not requested beforehand. He says Hertz's customer service was difficult to reach, and that it took making a ruckus on social media to get Hertz's attention.</p><p>In the end, a Hertz representative was able to review the charge and have it reversed. But Froelich was told it could take five to seven business days for the money to transfer, and for his troubles, he was offered just one free day of renting an EV (to be redeemed this calendar year, no less).</p><div data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="1" data-og-block-type="core/gallery"><figcaption data-rawhtml="1">Some of Evan Froehlich's interactions with Hertz customer service regarding his fuel charges. <em>Evan Froehlich</em></figcaption></div><p>Fellow Hertz customer Toan Le reported an even worse experience with their Tesla rental earlier this month.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://github.com/mcinglis/c-style">https://github.com/mcinglis/c-style</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40409956">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-hpc="true"><article itemprop="text"><p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">C Style</h2><a id="user-content-c-style" aria-label="Permalink: C Style" href="#c-style"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">These are my favorite C programming practices. Some rules are as trivial as style, while others are more intricate. I follow a few rules religiously, and others I use as a guideline. I prioritize correctness, readability, simplicity and maintainability over speed because <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?PrematureOptimization" rel="nofollow">premature optimization is the root of all evil</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Write correct, readable, simple and maintainable software, and tune it when you're done</strong>, with benchmarks to identify the choke points. Also, modern compilers <em>will</em> change computational complexities. Simplicity can often lead you to the best solution anyway: it's easier to write a linked list than it is to get an array to grow, but it's harder to index a list than it is to index an array.</p>
<p dir="auto">Backwards compatibility (e.g. ANSI C) is rarely important to me. In my opinion, backwards compatibility holds everyone back. I think we should use new technologies and new techniques if we can, to move everyone forward, if only a bit.</p>
<p dir="auto">If you don't agree with something here, that's perfectly fine. Pick and choose what you like, and what works for your own situation. These rules aren't intended to be universal admonitions about quality: they're just my preferences, and work well for what I do, and what I care about.</p>
<p dir="auto">Writing this guide has made me deeply consider, and reconsider, best C programming practices. I've changed my opinion multiple times on many of the rules in this document.</p>
<p dir="auto">So, I'm certain I'm wrong on even more points. This is a constant work-in-progress; issues and pull-requests are very welcome. This guide is licensed under the <a href="https://github.com/mcinglis/c-style/blob/master/license.md">Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike</a>, so I'm not liable for anything you do with this, etc.</p>

<p dir="auto">No excuses here. Always develop and compile with warnings on. It turns out, though, that <code>-Wall</code> and <code>-Wextra</code> actually don't enable "all" warnings. There are a few others that can be really helpful:</p>

<p dir="auto">Compiling with optimizations on can also help to detect errors:</p>

<p dir="auto">The GNU Make Manual <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Automatic-Prerequisites" rel="nofollow">touches</a> on how to automatically generate the dependencies of your object files from the source file's <code>#include</code>s.

<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="depfiles = $(objects:.o=.d)

	$(CC) -M -MP -MT '$(<:.c=.o) $@' $(CPPFLAGS) $< > $@

# Include each of those dependency files; Make will run the rule above

<span><span>#</span> Have the compiler output dependency files with make targets for each</span>

<p dir="auto">C11 is better than C99, which is (far) better than C89. C11 support is still coming along in GCC and Clang, but many features are there. If you need to support other compilers in the medium-term, write to C99.</p>
<p dir="auto">Always write to a <em>standard</em>, as in <code>-std=c11</code>. Don't write to a dialect, like <code>gnu11</code>. Try to make do without non-standard language extensions: you'll thank yourself later.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">We can't get tabs right, so use spaces everywhere</h4><a id="user-content-we-cant-get-tabs-right-so-use-spaces-everywhere" aria-label="Permalink: We can't get tabs right, so use spaces everywhere" href="#we-cant-get-tabs-right-so-use-spaces-everywhere"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The idea of tabs was that we'd use tabs for indentation levels, and spaces for alignment. This lets people choose an indentation width to their liking, without breaking alignment of columns.</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="int main( void ) {
|tab   |if ( pigs_can_fly() == true ) {
|tab   ||tab   |developers_can_use_tabs( &quot;and align columns &quot;
|tab   ||tab   |                         &quot;with spaces!&quot; );
|tab   |}
}"><pre><span>int</span> <span>main</span>( <span>void</span> ) {
|<span>tab</span>   |<span>if</span> ( <span>pigs_can_fly</span>() <span>==</span> true ) {
|<span>tab</span>   <span>||</span><span>tab</span>   |<span>developers_can_use_tabs</span>( <span>"and align columns "</span>
|<span>tab</span>   <span>||</span><span>tab</span>   |                         <span>"with spaces!"</span> );
|<span>tab</span>   |}
}</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">But, alas, we (and our editors) rarely get it right. There are four main problems posed by using tabs and spaces:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Tabs for indentation lead to inconsistencies between opinions on line lengths. Someone who uses a tab width of 8 will hit 80 characters much sooner than someone who uses a tab width of 2. The only way to avoid this is to require a tab-width, which eliminates the benefit of tabs.</li>
<li>It's much harder to configure your editor to correctly handle tabs and spaces for each project, than it is to just handle spaces. See also: <a href="http://www.jwz.org/doc/tabs-vs-spaces.html" rel="nofollow">Tabs vs Spaces: An Eternal Holy War</a></li>
<li>It's harder to align things using only the space bar. It's much easier to hit tab twice than to hold the space bar for eight characters. A developer on your project <em>will</em> make this mistake eventually. If you use spaces for indentation and alignment, you can hit the tab key in either situation, which is quick, easy and not prone to errors.</li>
<li>It's easier to prevent tab/space errors on projects that use only spaces, because all they need to do is detect for any tabs at all. To prevent against tabs used for alignment on a project that uses tabs, you'll need to come up with a regular expression.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Cut the complexity, and use spaces everywhere. You may have to adjust to someone else's indent width every now and then. Tough luck!</p>
<p dir="auto"><h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Never have more than 79 characters per line</h4><a id="user-content-never-have-more-than-79-characters-per-line" aria-label="Permalink: Never have more than 79 characters per line" href="#never-have-more-than-79-characters-per-line"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Never write lines longer than 79 characters.</p>
<p dir="auto">80-characters-per-line is a de-facto standard for viewing code. Readers of your code who rely on that standard, and have their terminal or editor sized to 80 characters wide, can fit more on the screen by placing windows side-by-side.</p>
<p dir="auto">You should stick to a maximum of 79 characters so that there's always a space in the last column. This makes it more obvious the line doesn't continue onto the next line. It also provides a right-hand margin.</p>
<p dir="auto">If you go over 80 characters, you're making your code significantly harder to read for people who try to rely on the 80-columns standard. Either your line will wrap, which is hard to read, or your readers will have to scroll the window to the right to get the last few characters. Either of these results in code that's harder to read than if you had just worked out a line-break yourself.</p>
<p dir="auto">It's harder to read long lines because your eyes have to travel further to get to the start of the next line, and the further they have to go, the more likely you'll have to visually readjust. 100-wide and 120-wide styles are easier to write, but harder to read.</p>
<p dir="auto">It can be very tempting to let a line here or there go over 79 characters, but your readers will pay the price every time they have to read such a line. Treat 79 characters as a hard limit - no ifs or buts. Work out how best to break long lines, and your readers will thank you.</p>
<p dir="auto">Do what everyone else is doing, and write for 80-column views, and we'll all be better off.</p>

</ul>
<p dir="auto"><h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Use <code>//</code> comments everywhere, never <code>/* ... */</code></h4><a id="user-content-use--comments-everywhere-never---" aria-label="Permalink: Use // comments everywhere, never /* ... */" href="#use--comments-everywhere-never---"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Stick to single-line comments, and cut the complexity. Compared to single-line comments, multi-line comments:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>are rarely used with a blank margin, so they're just as character-heavy</li>
<li>have a style, which has to be specified and adhered to</li>
<li>often have <code>*/</code> on its own line, so they're more line-expensive</li>
<li>have weird rules about embedded <code>/*</code> and <code>*/</code></li>
<li>are harder/impossible to block-edit, and to extend</li>
<li>are more visually-cluttering than <code>//</code></li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">You have to use <code>/* ... */</code> for inline comments in multi-line <code>#define</code>s, though:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="#define MAGIC( x ) \
    /* Voodoo magic happens here. */ \
    ..."><pre><span>#define</span> <span>MAGIC</span>( <span>x</span> )<span> \</span>
<span>    /* Voodoo magic happens here. */</span> \
    ...</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">But I often prefer to just add <code>//</code> comments after the macro body describing the tricky bits. I think this makes the macro body easier to read, but still provides the (much-needed) documentation.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Program in American English</h4><a id="user-content-program-in-american-english" aria-label="Permalink: Program in American English" href="#program-in-american-english"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Developing in the same language, using the same spelling and vocabulary, is important. This is especially true in free-software projects with contributors from around the world. You should use the same language consistently for your project, in code, comments and documentation.</p>
<p dir="auto">So, for American English, write <code>color</code>, <code>flavor</code>, <code>center</code>, <code>meter</code>, <code>neighbor</code>, <code>defense</code>, <code>routing</code>, <code>sizable</code>, <code>burned</code>, and so on (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_and_British_English_spelling_differences" rel="nofollow">see more</a>). I'm Australian, but I appreciate that most programmers will be learning and using American English. Also, American English spelling is consistently more phonetic and consistent than British English. British English tends to evolve towards American English for this reason, I think.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Comment non-standard-library <code>#include</code>s to say what symbols you use from them</h4><a id="user-content-comment-non-standard-library-includes-to-say-what-symbols-you-use-from-them" aria-label="Permalink: Comment non-standard-library #includes to say what symbols you use from them" href="#comment-non-standard-library-includes-to-say-what-symbols-you-use-from-them"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Namespaces are one of the great advances of software development. Unfortunately, C missed out (scopes aren't namespaces). But, because namespaces are so fantastic, we should try to simulate them with comments.</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="#include <test.c/test.h> // Test, tests_run
#include &quot;trie.h&quot; // Trie, Trie_*"><pre><span>#include</span> <span>&lt;test.c/test.h&gt;</span> <span>// Test, tests_run</span>
<span>#include</span> <span>"trie.h"</span> <span>// Trie, Trie_*</span></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">This provides a few benefits:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>readers aren't forced to refer to documentation or use <code>grep</code> to find out where a symbol is defined (or, if you don't follow the rule below, where it comes from): your code just tells them</li>
<li>developers have a hope of being able to determine which <code>#include</code>s can be removed and which can't</li>
<li>developers are forced to consider namespace pollution (which is otherwise ignored in most C code), and encourages them to only provide small, well-defined headers</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">The downside is that the <code>#include</code> comments aren't checked or enforced. I've been intending to write a checker for this for quite some time, but for now, there's nothing to stop the comments from becoming wrong - either mentioning symbols that aren't used anymore, or not mentioning symbols that are used. In your project, try to nip these problems in the bud, to stop it from spreading. You should always be able to trust your code.  This maintenance is annoying, for sure, but I think <code>#include</code> comments are worth it in aggregate.</p>
<p dir="auto">Finding where things come from is always one of my main challenges when learning a codebase. It could be a whole lot easier. I've never seen any projects that write <code>#include</code> comments like this, but I'd love to see it become a thing.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto"><code>#include</code> the definition of everything you use</h4><a id="user-content-include-the-definition-of-everything-you-use" aria-label="Permalink: #include the definition of everything you use" href="#include-the-definition-of-everything-you-use"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Don't depend on what your headers include. If your code uses a symbol, include the header file where that symbol is defined. Then, if your headers change their inclusions, your code won't break.</p>
<p dir="auto">Also, combined with the <code>#include</code> comment rule above, this saves your readers and fellow developers from having to follow a trail of includes just to find the definition of a symbol you're using. Your code should just tell them where it comes from.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Avoid unified headers</h4><a id="user-content-avoid-unified-headers" aria-label="Permalink: Avoid unified headers" href="#avoid-unified-headers"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Unified headers are generally bad, because they relieve the library developer of the responsibility to provide loosely-coupled modules clearly separated by their purpose and abstraction. Even if the developer (thinks she) does this anyway, a unified header increases compilation time, and couples the user's program to the entire library, regardless of if they need it. There are numerous other disadvantages, touched on in the points above.</p>
<p dir="auto">There was a good exposé on unified headers on the <a href="http://programmers.stackexchange.com/questions/185773/library-design-provide-a-common-header-file-or-multiple-headers" rel="nofollow">Programmers' Stack Exchange</a>. An answer mentions that it's reasonable for something like GTK+ to only provide a single header file. I agree, but I think that's due to the bad design of GTK+, and it's not intrinsic to a graphical toolkit.</p>
<p dir="auto">It's harder for users to write multiple <code>#include</code>s just like it's harder for users to write types. Bringing difficulty into it is missing the forest for the trees.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Provide include guards for all headers to prevent double inclusion</h4><a id="user-content-provide-include-guards-for-all-headers-to-prevent-double-inclusion" aria-label="Permalink: Provide include guards for all headers to prevent double inclusion" href="#provide-include-guards-for-all-headers-to-prevent-double-inclusion"></a></p>
<p dir="auto"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Include_guard" rel="nofollow">Include guards</a> let you include a header file "twice" without it breaking compilation.</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="// Good

<p dir="auto"><a href="http://www.lysator.liu.se/c/pikestyle.html" rel="nofollow">Rob Pike argues against include guards</a>, saying you should just never include files in include files. He says that include guards still "result in thousands of needless lines of code passing through the lexical analyzer".</p>
<p dir="auto">In fact, <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/cppinternals/Guard-Macros.html" rel="nofollow">GCC will detect include guards</a>, and won't read such files a second time. I don't know if other compilers perform this optimization.</p>
<p dir="auto">I don't think it's a good idea to require your users include the dependencies of your header files. Your header file's dependencies shouldn't really be considered "public". It would enforce the rule "don't depend on what your header files include", but it falls apart as soon as header files are using things you don't need, like <code>FILE</code> or <code>bool</code>. Users shouldn't have to care about that if they don't need it themselves.</p>
<p dir="auto">So, always write include guards, and make your users' lives easy.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Always comment <code>#endif</code>s of large conditional sections</h4><a id="user-content-always-comment-endifs-of-large-conditional-sections" aria-label="Permalink: Always comment #endifs of large conditional sections" href="#always-comment-endifs-of-large-conditional-sections"></a></p>
<p dir="auto"><h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">No global or static variables if you can help it (you probably can)</h4><a id="user-content-no-global-or-static-variables-if-you-can-help-it-you-probably-can" aria-label="Permalink: No global or static variables if you can help it (you probably can)" href="#no-global-or-static-variables-if-you-can-help-it-you-probably-can"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Global variables are just hidden arguments to all the functions that use them. They make it really hard to understand what a function does, and how it is controlled.</p>
<p dir="auto">Mutable global variables are especially evil and should be avoided at all costs. Conceptually, a global variable assignment is a bunch of <code>longjmp</code>s to set hidden, static variables. Yuck.</p>
<p dir="auto">You should always try to design your functions to be completely controllable by their arguments. Even if you have a variable that will have to be passed around to lots of a functions - if it affects their computation, it should be a argument or a member of a argument. This <em>always</em> leads to better code and better design.</p>
<p dir="auto">For example, removing global variables and constants from my <a href="https://github.com/mcinglis/trie.c">Trie.c</a> project resulted in the <code>Alphabet</code> struct, which lets users tune the storage structure to their needs.

<p dir="auto">Static variables in functions are just global variables scoped to that function; the arguments above apply equally to them. Just like global variables, static variables are often used as an easy way out of providing modular, pure functions. They're often defended in the name of performance (benchmarks first!). You don't need static variables, just like you don't need global variables. If you need persistent state, have the function accept that state as a argument. If you need to return something persistent, allocate memory for it.</p>

<p dir="auto">Your header files should <em>only</em> include things that users need to use your library.

<p dir="auto">If a function or global variable isn't exported in the header, declare it as <code>static</code> in the source file to give it internal linkage. This eliminates the chance of name-clashes among object files, enables a few optimizations, and can improve the linking speed.</p>

<p dir="auto"><code>const</code> improves compile-time correctness. It isn't only for documenting read-only pointers. It should be used for every read-only variable and pointee.</p>
<p dir="auto"><code>const</code> helps the reader <em>immensely</em> in understanding a piece of functionality. If they can look at an initialization and be sure that that value won't change throughout the scope, they can reason about the rest of the scope much easier. Without <code>const</code>, everything is up in the air; the reader is forced to comprehend the entire scope to understand what is and isn't being modified. If you consistently use <code>const</code>, your reader will begin to trust you, and will be able to assume that a variable that isn't qualified with <code>const</code> is a signal that it will be changed at some point in the scope.</p>
<p dir="auto">Using <code>const</code> everywhere you can also helps you, as a developer, reason about what's happening in the control flow of your program, and where mutability is spreading. It's amazing, when using <code>const</code>, how much more helpful the compiler is, especially regarding pointers and pointees. You always want the compiler on your side.</p>
<p dir="auto">The compiler will warn if a pointee loses <code>const</code>ness in a function call (because that would let the pointee be modified), but it won't complain if a pointee gains <code>const</code>ness. Thus, if you <em>don't</em> specify your pointer arguments as <code>const</code> when they're read-only anyway, you discourage your users from using <code>const</code> in their own code:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="// Bad: sum should define its array as const.

// Because otherwise, this will be a compilation warning:

<p dir="auto">Thus, using <code>const</code> isn't really a choice, at least for function signatures. Lots of people consider it beneficial, so everyone should consider it required, whether they like it or not. If you don't use <code>const</code>, you force your users to either cast all calls to your functions (yuck), ignore <code>const</code> warnings (asking for trouble), or remove those <code>const</code> qualifiers (lose compile-time correctness).</p>
<p dir="auto">If you're forced to work with a library that ignores <code>const</code>, you can write a macro that casts for you:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="// `sum` will not modify the given array; casts for `const` pointers.

<p dir="auto">If you can <code>const</code> the pointees of your <em>internal</em> structs, do. Non-constant pointees can cause mutability to needlessly spread, which makes it harder to glean information from the remaining <code>const</code> qualifiers. Because you have total control over your internal structs, if you need to remove the <code>const</code> in future, you can.</p>
<p dir="auto">You usually shouldn't <code>const</code> the pointees of your external structs. Flexibility is important when they're part of the public interface. Consider it carefully. An exception to this that I often make is for fields are best assignable to string literals, such as <code>error</code> fields. In this case, a <code>char const *</code> type prevents you and your users from modifying the underlying string literals, which would prompt a segmentation fault.</p>
<p dir="auto">While it can be reasonable to <code>const</code> the <em>pointees</em> of struct fields, it's never beneficial to <code>const</code> the struct fields themselves. For example, <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9691404/how-to-initialize-const-in-a-struct-in-c-with-malloc" rel="nofollow">it makes it painful to <code>malloc</code></a> a value of that struct. If it really makes sense to stop the fields from changing beyond their original values, just define <a href="#document-your-struct-invariants-and-provide-invariant-checkers">invariants</a> that enforce whatever qualities you need. Also, you and your users can just define individual variables of that struct as <code>const</code> to get the same effect.</p>
<p dir="auto">Only make return-type pointees <code>const</code> if you need to, and after careful consideration. I've found that when the compiler is hinting to add a <code>const</code> to a return type, it often means that a <code>const</code> should be <em>removed</em> somewhere; not added. It can harm flexibility, so be careful.</p>
<p dir="auto">Finally, never use typecasts or pointers to get around <code>const</code> qualifiers - at least, for things you control. If the variable isn't constant, don't make it one.</p>

<p dir="auto">For the vast majority of applications nowadays, space isn't an issue, but floating-point errors can still pose a threat. It's much harder for numeric drift to cause problems for <code>double</code>s than it is for <code>float</code>s. Unless you have a very specific reason to use <code>float</code>s, use <code>double</code>s instead. Don't use <code>float</code>s "because they will be faster", because without benchmarks, you can't know if it actually makes any discernible difference. Finish development, then perform benchmarks to identify the choke-points, then use <code>float</code>s in those areas, and see if it actually helps. Before then, prioritize everything else over any supposed performance improvements. Don't prematurely optimize.</p>

<p dir="auto">Declaring variables where they're used reminds the reader of the type they're working with. It also suggests where to extract a function to minimize variable scope. Furthermore, it informs the reader as to where each variables are relevant. Declaring variables when they're needed almost always leads to initialization (<code>int x = 1;</code>), rather than just declaration (<code>int x;</code>).

<p dir="auto"><em>Expert C Programming</em> (a great book that explores the ANSI standard) also explains this in its first chapter. The takeaway is that you shouldn't declare <code>unsigned</code> variables just because they shouldn't be negative. If you want a larger maximum value, use a <code>long</code> or <code>long long</code> (the next size up).</p>
<p dir="auto">If your function will fail with a negative number, it will probably also fail with a large number - which is what it will get if passed a negative number. If your function will fail with a negative number, just assert that it's positive. Remember, lots of dynamic languages make do with a single integer type that can be either sign.</p>
<p dir="auto">Unsigned values offer no type safety; even with <code>-Wall</code> and <code>-Wextra</code>, GCC doesn't bat an eyelid at <code>unsigned int x = -1;</code>.</p>
<p dir="auto"><em>Expert C Programming</em> also provides an example for why you should cast all macros that will evaluate to an unsigned value.</p>

        return xs[ d + 1 ];

}</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">The <code>if</code> branch won't be executed, because <code>NELEM</code> will evaluate to an <code>unsigned int</code> (via <code>sizeof</code>). So, <code>d</code> will be promoted to an <code>unsigned int</code>. <code>-1</code> in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two%27s_complement" rel="nofollow">two's complement</a> represents the largest possible unsigned value (bit-wise), so the expression will be false, and the program will return <code>0</code>.

<p dir="auto">Actually, don't use either form if you can help it. Changing state should always be avoided (within reason). But, when you have to, <code>+=</code> and <code>-=</code> are obvious, simpler and less cryptic than <code>++</code> and <code>--</code>, and useful in other contexts and with other values. Also, there are no tricks about the evaluation of <code>+=</code> and <code>-=</code> and they don't have weird twin operators to provide alternative evaluations. Python does without <code>++</code> and <code>--</code> operators, and Douglas Crockford excluded them from the Good Parts of JavaScript, because we don't need them. Sticking to this rule also encourages you to avoid changing state within an expression.</p>

<p dir="auto">The <code>switch</code> fall-through mechanism is error-prone, and you almost never want the cases to fall through anyway, so the vast majority of <code>switch</code>es are longer than the <code>if</code> equivalent. Worse, a missing <code>break</code> will still compile: this tripped me up all the time when I used <code>switch</code>. Also, <code>case</code> values have to be an integral constant expression, so they can't match against another variable. This discourages extractions of logic to functions. Furthermore, any statement inside a <code>switch</code> can be labelled and jumped to, which fosters highly-obscure bugs if, for example, you mistype <code>defau1t</code>.</p>

<p dir="auto">Always initialize your string literals as arrays, because it lets you get the byte size with just <code>sizeof str</code>.

Initializing string literals as arrays essentially creates a mutable string is only "artificially" protected against modifications with <code>const</code> - but this can be defeated with a cast.</p>
<p dir="auto">Again, I advise against prematurely optimizing. Until you've finished development and have done benchmarks, performance should be your lowest priority. I haven't seen any tests on string literal definitions, but I'd be very surprised to see any notable speed improvements by defining string literals as pointers.</p>
<p dir="auto">As mentioned in the rule on <code>const</code>ing everything: never ever cast away a <code>const</code>. Remove the <code>const</code> instead. Don't worry about "artificial" protections.

<p dir="auto">Finally, sticking to array initializations saves you and your readers the conceptual overhead of switching between pointer initializations and array initializations, depending on if you need mutability or not.</p>

<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">An <strong>invariant</strong> is a condition that can be relied upon to be true during execution of a program.</p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="auto">For any function that takes a struct (or a pointer to a struct), all invariants of that struct should be true before and after the execution of the function. Invariants make it the caller's responsibility to provide valid data, and the function's responsibility to return valid data. Invariants save those functions from having to repeat assertions of those conditions, or worse, not even checking and working with invalid data.</p>
<p dir="auto">Provide an "invariants" comment section at the end of your struct definition, and list all the invariants you can think of. Also, implement <code>is_valid</code> and <code>assert_valid</code> functions for users to check those assertions on values of the structs they create on their own. These functions are crucial to being able to trust that the invariants hold for values of that struct. Without them, how will the users know?</p>

<p dir="auto">That said, never depend on assertions for correctness. Your program should still work correctly when the assertion lines are removed.</p>
<p dir="auto">Don't mistake assertions for error-reporting. Assert things that you won't bother to check otherwise. If user input (not code) can invalidate an assertion, that's a bug. You should be filtering it before-hand, and reporting the errors in a readable fashion for your users.</p>

<p dir="auto">Variable-length arrays were introduced in C99 as a way to define dynamic-length arrays with automatic storage; no need for <code>malloc</code>.

Instead, just don't use variable-length arrays.</p>
<p dir="auto">I'd advise against using variable-length arrays in C99, too.

<p dir="auto">Every pointer in a struct is an opportunity for a segmentation fault.</p>
<p dir="auto">If the would-be pointer shouldn't be NULL, isn't an array of an unknown size, and isn't of the type of the struct itself, then don't make it a pointer. Just include a member of the type itself in the struct. Don't worry about the size of the containing struct until you've done benchmarks.</p>

<p dir="auto">This rule helps readers reason about where values are being modified. It also improves the safety by making it impossible for functions that shouldn't receive <code>NULL</code> from receiving <code>NULL</code> -- this is a huge benefit over languages that require pass-by-reference semantics (and thus <code>NULL</code> as a valid value almost everywhere).</p>
<p dir="auto">When you're reading a codebase that sticks to this rule, and its functions and types are maximally decomposed, you can often tell what a function does just by reading its prototype. This is in stark contrast to projects that pass pointers everywhere: you have no certainty anywhere.</p>
<p dir="auto">In C, you can pass struct values to functions, and by <a href="http://c-faq.com/ptrs/passbyref.html" rel="nofollow">pass-by-value semantics</a>, they'll be copied into the stack frame of the receiving function. The original struct can't be modified by that function (although it can return the modification). Like <code>const</code>, using this feature wherever you can makes it easier for your readers to reason about your program.</p>
<p dir="auto">Defining a "modification" gets tricky when you introduce structs with pointer members. I consider a modification to be something that affects the struct itself, or the pointees of the struct.</p>
<p dir="auto">If a struct will be "modified" by a function, have that function accept a pointer of that struct even if it doesn't need to. This saves the readers from having to find and memorize every relevant struct definition, to be aware of which structs have pointer members.</p>

<p dir="auto">Note the const-ness of the <code>country</code> argument above: this communicates that the country itself won't be modified, but a pointee (although it could also be taken to suggest that the pointer is for nullity, but the function name suggests otherwise). It also allows callers to pass in a pointer to a <code>Country const</code>.</p>
<p dir="auto">The other situation to use pointer arguments is if the function needs to accept <code>NULL</code> as a valid value (i.e. the poor man's <a href="http://learnyouahaskell.com/making-our-own-types-and-typeclasses" rel="nofollow">Maybe</a>).

<p dir="auto">I learnt this from <em>21st Century C</em>. So many C interfaces could be improved immensely if they took advantage of this technique.

<p dir="auto">Don't use named arguments everywhere. If a function's only argument happens to be a struct, that doesn't necessarily mean it should become the named arguments for that function. A good rule of thumb is that if the struct is used outside of that function, you shouldn't hide it with a macro like above.</p>

<h2 id="background">Background</h2>

<p>A while before my <a href="https://mzucker.github.io/2016/08/15/page-dewarping.html">page dewarping</a> project, I was already thinking
about how to undo the effects of 3D projection on photographs of
text. In the spring of 2016, I advised a couple of students working on
a combined optical character recognition (OCR) and translation
smartphone app for their Engineering senior design project. Their app
was pretty cool – it used <a href="https://github.com/tesseract-ocr">Tesseract OCR</a> along with the
<a href="https://cloud.google.com/translate/docs/">Google Translate API</a> to translate images in the user’s photo
library. Users had to be careful, however, to photograph the text they
wanted to translate head-on, so as to avoid strong perspective
distortion of the type evidenced beautifully in the opening crawl for
each of the Star Wars films:</p>

<p><img src="https://mzucker.github.io/images/unproject_text/ESBOpeningCrawl.png" alt="tesseract OCR hates this"></p>

<p>Yep, just try running that thru OCR. Won’t work.</p>

<p>One my students found an
<a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0262885613001066">interesting paper by Carlos Merino-Gracia et al.</a> on how to
undo this type of keystoning. When I looked it over, I wasn’t
surprised that the students felt like they didn’t have time to
implement it – to my eyes, the method seems sophisticated but also
a bit complex.</p>

<p>As these figures from the paper show, the method fits a quadrilateral
to each line of the input text, which can then be rectified. This is
useful but difficult because it requires detecting lines of text as
the very first step. It’s kind of a “chicken and egg” problem: if the
text were laid out horizontally, it would be trivial to detect lines;
but the approach uses the detected lines in order to make the text
horizontal!</p>

<p>My goal was to solve the perspective recovery problem based upon a
much simpler model of text appearance, namely that <em>on average, all
letters should be about the same size</em>.  I was really happy with the
approach I ended up with in this project, especially because I got to
learn some interesting math along the way.  Although I’m sure its
neither as accurate or as useful as the Merino-Gracia approach, it
ended up producing persuasive results on my test inputs in pretty
rapid order.</p>

<h2 id="positionarea-correlations">Position/area correlations</h2>

<p>Let’s restate the principle that’s going to guide our approach to the
perspective removal problem:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>On average, all letters should be about the same size.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because I don’t have a fancy text detector hanging around like
Merino-Gracia et al.<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>, I’m going to make a huge simplifying
assumption that that the image we’re processing basically contains
only the text that we want to rectify, like for example, this one:</p>

<p><img src="https://mzucker.github.io/images/unproject_text/example0_input.png" alt="input image"></p>

<p>In this case, we can use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thresholding_(image_processing)">thresholding</a> to obtain a clean bi-level
image that separates letters from the background:</p>

<p><img src="https://mzucker.github.io/images/unproject_text/example0_threshold.png" alt="thresholded"></p>

<p>…and then use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connected-component_labeling">connected component labeling</a> to obtain the outline
– or <em>contour</em>, in image processing lingo – of each individual
letter, like so:</p>

<p><img src="https://mzucker.github.io/images/unproject_text/example0_contours.png" alt="contours with areas"></p>

<p>Here I’ve tagged each detected contour with its enclosed area, to make
it clear that area correlates significantly with the position in the
image.  For example, the <strong>N</strong> and the <strong>c</strong> way over on the left
cover drastically fewer pixels than the <strong>x</strong> and the <strong>y</strong> on the far
right. If you plot the position-area relationship along with the
best-fit regression lines, the correlation becomes even more apparent:</p>

<p><img src="https://mzucker.github.io/images/unproject_text/position-vs-area.png" alt="position vs. area"></p>

<p>Our task is now pretty simple: if we want to remove the effects of
perspective, all we have to do is to transform the image in such a way
that the letter shapes tend to have uniform areas across the entire
image – independent of their position.</p>

<p>But before we get started, we had better define what type of
mathematical transformation we’re going to apply to our image to
correct it.</p>

<h2 id="homography">Homographies: projections of planar objects</h2>

<p>The mapping that turns normal-looking 2D text into the exciting <em>Star
Wars</em> crawl that seems to zoom past the camera in 3D is called a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homography_(computer_vision)">homography</a>. Due to the geometric optics underlying image formation,
any time we take a photograph of a planar object like a chessboard or
a street sign, it gets mapped through one of these. Mathematically, we
can think about a homography transforming some original \((x, y)\)
point on the surface of our planar object to a destination point
\((x', y')\) inside of the image, like this:</p>

<p><img src="https://mzucker.github.io/images/unproject_text/homography.png" alt="action of a homography"></p>

<p>There are a few different ways to represent homographies
mathematically. Here’s a simple definition in terms of eight
parameters \(a\) through \(h\):</p><p>

\[x'  = \frac{ax + by + c}{gx + hy + 1} ,
\quad 
y'  = \frac{dx + ey + f}{gx + hy + 1}\]

</p><p>As a superset of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation">rotations</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translation">translations</a>,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scaling_(geometry)">scaling transformations</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shear_mapping">shear transformations</a>,
homographies encompass a wide variety of effects. We can consider the
influence of each parameter individually:</p>

<ul>
  <li>\(a\) and \(e\) control scale along the \(x\) and \(y\) axes, respectively</li>
  <li>\(b\) and \(d\) control shear along each axis (together with \(a\) and \(e\) they also influence rotation, too)</li>
  <li>\(c\) and \(f\) control translation along each axis</li>
  <li>\(g\) and \(h\) control perspective distortion along each axis</li>
</ul>

<p>The Shadertoy below shows how the appearance of <a href="http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/nyan-cat-pop-tart-cat">Nyan Cat</a> is altered as
each parameter of the homography (from \(a\) to \(h\)) is changed
individually. Press play in the bottom left corner to see the
animation (you can also hit <code>A</code> to toggle extra animations because wheeee Nyan Cat).</p>



<p>By jointly changing all eight parameters, we can represent every
possible perspective distortion of a planar object. Furthermore, since
homographies are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse_function">invertible</a>, we can also use them to warp <em>back</em>
from a distorted image to the original, undistorted planar object.</p>

<h2 id="homogeneous-coordinates">Homogeneous coordinates</h2>

<p><em>Note: this section assumes a bit of linear algebra knowledge – you
 can skim it, but the math here will shore up the ensuing section
 about ellipses.</em></p>

<p>Remember how we said there are multiple ways to write down homographies?
Well, here’s a matrix-based representation:</p><p>

\[\tilde{\mathbf{p}}' = 
\left[\begin{array}{c} \tilde{x}' \\ \tilde{y}' \\ \tilde{w}' \end{array}\right]
= 
\mathbf{H} \tilde{\mathbf{p}}
=
\left[\begin{array}{ccc} a &amp; b &amp; c \\ d &amp; e &amp; f \\ g &amp; h &amp; 1 \end{array}\right]
\left[\begin{array}{c} x \\ y \\ 1 \end{array}\right]
= 
\left[\begin{array}{c} ax + by + c \\ dx + ey + f \\ gx + hy + 1 \end{array}\right]\]

</p><p>Denote by \(\mathbf{H}\) the \(3 \times 3\) matrix of parameters in
the middle of the equation above. When we map the vector
\(\tilde{\mathbf{p}} = (x, y, 1)\) through it, we get three outputs
\(\tilde{x}'\), \(\tilde{y}'\), and \(\tilde{w}'\). In order to obtain
our final coordinates \(x'\) and \(y'\), we simply divide the former two by
\(\tilde{w}'\):</p><p>

\[x'  = \frac{\tilde{x}'}{\tilde{w}'} = \frac{ax + by + c}{gx + hy + 1},
\quad
y'  = \frac{\tilde{y}'}{\tilde{w}'} = \frac{dx + ey + f}{gx + hy + 1}\]

</p><p>You can verify that this is exactly the same as our first definition
of a homography <a href="#homography">above</a>, just expressed a little bit more
baroquely. Go ahead and make sure, I’ll wait…</p>

<p>Did it check out? Good.</p>

<p>Fine, the two definitions are the same – who cares? Well, it turns
out we just wrote down the the homography using
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneous_coordinates">homogeneous coordinates</a>, which establish a beautiful mathematical
correspondence between matrices and a large family of non-linear
transformations like homographies.</p>

<p>Anything you can do with the underlying transformations – such as
composing two of them together – you can do in homogeneous
coordinates with simple operations like matrix multiplication.  And if
the homogeneous representation of a transformation is an
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invertible_matrix">invertible matrix</a>, then the parameters of the inverse transformation
are straightforwardly obtained from the matrix inverse! So given our
homography parameters \(a\) through \(h\), if we want to find the
parameters of the inverse homography, all we need to do is compute
\(\mathbf{H}^{-1}\) and grab its elements.<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></p>

<h2 id="equalizing-areas-as-an-optimization-problem">Equalizing areas as an optimization problem</h2>

<p>Let’s get back to our perspective recovery problem: we need to
estimate a homography that will equalize the areas of all of the
letters, once they’re all warped through it.  Well, since \(g\) and
\(h\) are the homography parameters that that determine the
correlation between a shape’s position and its projected area, we
<em>should</em> be able to find some setting for them that eliminates the
correlation as much as possible. Therefore, we’ll fix the other six
parameters for now, and just worry about producing the best possible
perspective transformation of the form</p><p>

\[\mathbf{H}_P = 
\left[\begin{array}{ccc} 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\ g &amp; h &amp; 1 \end{array}\right]\]

</p><p>By “best”, we mean the matrix that minimizes the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_sum_of_squares">total sum of squares</a> of the warped contours’ areas, defined as:</p><p>

\[SS_{total} = \sum_{i=1}^n \left(A_i - \bar{A}\right)^2\]

</p><p>where \(A_i\) is the area of the \(i^\text{th}\) warped contour (of
which there are \(n\) total), and \(\bar{A}\) is the mean of all of
their areas. Minimizing this total sum of squares is akin to minimizing
the <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/SampleVariance.html">sample variance</a> of the contour areas.</p>

<p>How do we accomplish this in practice? We just described an
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization">optimization problem</a>: find the pair of parameters \((g, h)\) that
minimizes the quantity above. There’s <em>tons</em> of ways to solve
optimization problems, but when I’m in a hurry, I just hand them off
to good old <a href="http://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.optimize.minimize.html"><code>scipy.optimize.minimize</code></a>. For all intents and purposes,
we can consider it a “black box” that tries lots of different
parameters, iteratively refining them until it finds the best combination.</p>

<h2 id="tracking-areas-through-homographies">Tracking areas through homographies</h2>

<p>To evaluate our optimization objective, we’ll need to compute the areas
of a bunch of contours.  OpenCV accomplishes this via a variant of the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoelace_formula">shoelace formula</a>, processing a contour consisting of \(m\) points in
linear time of \(O(m)\). Despite this apparent efficiency, that’s
actually bad news for us, because <code>scipy.optimize.minimize</code> has to
compute the projected area for \(n\) contours (one for each letter)
<em>every time</em> it wants to evaluate the optimization objective. If each
contour consists of \(m\) points on average, our objective function
would therefore take \(O(mn)\) time to run. To speed things up, we can
replace each contour by a simpler “proxy” shape that is much easier to
reason about.  Here’s our letter contours once more:</p>

<p><img src="https://mzucker.github.io/images/unproject_text/example0_contours_only.png" alt="contours with areas"></p>

<p>We’ll be replacing them with these <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellipse">ellipses</a>:</p>

<p><img src="https://mzucker.github.io/images/unproject_text/example0_ellipses.png" alt="contours with areas"></p>

<p>In the two images above, each red ellipse has the same area – that
is, it covers the same number of pixels – as the green outlined
letter that it replaces. There’s a few reasons I specifically chose
ellipses as the proxy shape:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>They’re simple to describe – we can fully specify an ellipse with
just five numbers.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We can use them to not only match the area, but also the general
aspect ratio and orientation of a letter (i.e. skinny or round,
horizontal, vertical, or diagonal).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mapping an ellipse through a homography generally 
produces another ellipse.<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>There are a couple of ways we can parameterize ellipses – let’s start
with the canonical parameters \((x_c, y_c, a, b, \theta)\), where
\((x_c, y_c)\) is the center point, \(a\) and \(b\) are the semi-major
and semi-minor axis lengths, and \(\theta\) is the counterclockwise
rotation of the ellipse from horizontal, as illustrated here:</p>

<p><img src="https://mzucker.github.io/images/unproject_text/ellipse.png" alt="ellipse parameters"></p>

<p>Given a contour outlining a letter, we can find the “closest” matching
ellipse by choosing these parameters such that the center point and
areas match up. We can also examine the second-order <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_moment">shape moments</a>
of the contour to match the letter’s aspect ratio and orientation as
well.</p>

<p>We can also represent an ellipse as the set of \((x, y)\) points that satisfy the 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implicit_function">implicit function</a></p><p>

\[f(x, y) = Ax^2 + Bxy + Cy^2 + Dx + Ey + F = 0\]

</p><p>where \(A\) through \(F\) are the parameters of our ellipse.<sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">4</a></sup> We can
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellipse#General_ellipse">switch back and forth</a> between the two representations without changing
the underlying mathematical object we’re describing – it’s just a
matter of which one is more useful at the moment.</p>

<p>Just like we did with the homography, we can express the implicit
function parameters as elements of a matrix that operates on
homogeneous coordinates. The new function looks like this:</p><p>

\[f(\tilde{\mathbf{p}}) = 
\tilde{\mathbf{p}}^T \mathbf{M} \tilde{\mathbf{p}} =
\left[\begin{array}{ccc} x &amp; y &amp; 1 \end{array}\right]
\left[ \begin{array}{ccc}
A &amp; B/2 &amp; D/2 \\
B/2 &amp; C &amp; E/2 \\
D/2 &amp; E/2 &amp; F \end{array}\right]
\left[\begin{array}{ccc} x \\ y \\ 1 \end{array}\right] = 0\]

</p><p>As it turns out, if we want to map the entire ellipse through some
homography \(\mathbf{H}\) represented as a \(3 \times 3\) matrix in
homogeneous coordinates, we can compute the matrix</p><p>

\[\mathbf{M}' = \mathbf{H}^{-T} \mathbf{M} \mathbf{H}^{-1}\]

</p><p>and then straightforwardly obtain the parameters \(A'\) through \(F'\)
of the the implicit function corresponding to the transformed ellipse
by grabbing them out of the appropriate elements of \(\mathbf{M}'\).<sup id="fnref:5" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:5" rel="footnote">5</a></sup></p>

<p>To illustrate how ellipses get mapped through homographies, I created
another Shadertoy.  When the faint rectangle and ellipse at the center
of the display through a homography we see that the rectangle may
transform into an arbitrary quadrilateral; however, the inscribed
ellipse is just transformed into another ellipse. Interestingly, the
center point of the new ellipse (red dot) is not the same as the
transformed center point of the original ellipse (green dot). Once
again, press the play button in the lower left to see the figure
animate.</p>



<p>The bottom line of all this is that since there’s a closed-form
formula for expressing the result of mapping an ellipse through a
perspective transformation, it’s super efficient to model each letter
as an ellipse for the purposes of running our objective function.</p>

<p>Here is what the optimization process looks like as it refines the
warp parameters to improve the objective function:</p>

<p><img src="https://mzucker.github.io/images/unproject_text/ellipse_optimization.gif" alt="optimization in action"></p>

<p>The post-optimization, distortion-corrected image looks like this:</p>

<p><img src="https://mzucker.github.io/images/unproject_text/example0_prerotate_noline.png" alt="after undistorting"></p>

<p>You can see we have equalized the letters’ areas quite a bit, just by
considering the action of the homography \(\mathbf{H}_P\) on the
collection of proxy ellipses.</p>

<h2 id="composing-the-final-homography">Composing the final homography</h2>

<p>Once the perspective distortion has been removed by finding the
optimal \((g, h)\) parameters of the homography, we need to choose
good values for the remaining parameters. In particular, we are
concerned with the parameters \((a, b, d, e)\), which control
rotation, scale, and skew. We will do this by composing the
perspective transformation \(\mathbf{H}_P\) discovered in the previous
step with two additional transformations: a rotation-only
transformation \(\mathbf{H}_R\), and a skew transformation
\(\mathbf{H}_S\). To find the optimal rotation angle, we will take a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hough_transform">Hough transform</a> of the contours after being mapped through
\(\mathbf{H}_P\). Our input image is a binary mask indicating the edge
pixels:</p>

<p><img src="https://mzucker.github.io/images/unproject_text/example0_edges.png" alt="edge pixels"></p>

<p>…and here is the corresponding Hough transform:</p>

<p><img src="https://mzucker.github.io/images/unproject_text/example0_hough.png" alt="Hough transform"></p>

<p>The Hough transform relates every possible <em>line</em> in the input image
to a single <em>pixel</em> in the output image. Lines are parameterized by
their orientation angle \(\theta\) (with 0° being horizontal and
±90° being vertical), as well as their distance \(r\) from
the image origin. In the Hough transform output image, the brightness
of a pixel at \((\theta, r)\) corresponds to the number of edge pixels
detected along the line in the input image with angle \(\theta\) and
distance \(r\) from the origin.</p>

<p>If a particular angle correlates well to the rotation of the text in
the input image, its corresponding column in the Hough transform
should be mostly zero pixels, with a small number of very bright
pixels corresponding to the tops and bottoms of letters along parallel
lines of the same angle.  Conversely, angles which do not correlate
well to the text rotation should have a more or less random spread of
energy over all distances \(r\). To find the optimal rotation angle
\(\theta\), we simply identify the column (highlighted above in blue)
of the Hough transform containing the most zero pixels. We can then
create a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation_matrix">rotation matrix</a> of the form</p><p>

\[\mathbf{H}_R = \left[ \begin{array}{ccc}
\phantom{-}\cos \theta &amp; \sin \theta &amp; 0 \\
-\sin \theta &amp; \cos \theta &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1
\end{array}\right]\]

</p><p>to rotate the image back by the detected \(\theta\) value. Here is the
resulting image after warping first through \(\mathbf{H}_P\) and then
\(\mathbf{H}_R\):</p>

<p><img src="https://mzucker.github.io/images/unproject_text/example0_preskew.png" alt="after perspective transform and rotation"></p>

<p>Finally, taking a cue from Merino-Gracia et al., we create a skew
transformation</p><p>

\[\mathbf{H}_S = \left[ \begin{array}{ccc}

1 &amp; b &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1

\end{array}\right]\]

</p><p>parameterized by a single skew parameter \(b\), that aims to reduce
the width of the letters – this time using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convex_hull">convex hull</a> of each
detected contour as a proxy shape. Instead of minimizing the width of
the widest letter, as Merino-Gracia et al. do, I found that on my
inputs at least, using the <a href="http://www.johndcook.com/blog/2010/01/13/soft-maximum/">soft maximum</a> over hull widths gave nicer
results than a straight-up maximum. Here’s the convex hulls after the
rotation, but before the skew:</p>

<p><img src="https://mzucker.github.io/images/unproject_text/example0_convex_hulls_before.png" alt="convex hulls before"></p>

<p>And the same convex hulls after discovering the optimal skew with 
<a href="http://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.optimize.minimize_scalar.html"><code>scipy.optimize.minimize_scalar</code></a>:</p>

<p><img src="https://mzucker.github.io/images/unproject_text/example0_convex_hulls_after.png" alt="convex hulls before"></p>

<p>The final homography is given by composing the transformations we
identified, applied in right-to-left order:<sup id="fnref:6" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:6" rel="footnote">6</a></sup></p><p>

\[\mathbf{H}_{final} = \mathbf{H}_S \, \mathbf{H}_R \, \mathbf{H}_P\]

</p><h2 id="other-examples">Other examples</h2>

<p>Here are a couple of other before/after image pairs. Input:</p>

<h2 id="conclusions-and-future-work">Conclusions and future work</h2>

<p>What started out as an interesting alternative take and/or
simplification of an existing paper’s approach turned into a fun deep
dive into the math underlying homographies and ellipses. I especially
enjoyed producing the visualizations and animations underlying my own
approach. Again, I don’t want to claim that the work I did is
state-of-the-art or even that it’s superior to existing methods like
Merino-Gracia et al. – I just relish the process of wrapping my head
around a technical challenge and carving it up into a sequence of
well-defined optimization problems, as I’ve done in the past with my
<a href="https://mzucker.github.io/2016/08/01/gabor-2.html">image fitting</a> and <a href="https://mzucker.github.io/2016/08/15/page-dewarping.html">page dewarping</a> posts.</p>

<h2>Beating Jeff's 3.14 Ghz Raspberry Pi 5</h2>

<p>Jeff came up against a 1V limit in his video 
  "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTIkZBsVJyA&amp;t=931s"> Overclocking Raspberry Pi 5 to 3.14 GHz on Pi Day </a>"

</p><p>There's a silicon lottery, and I tried to see what I could get on my particular Pi.
  Geekbench takes ages to run and has a large run-to-run variance.
  <br>
  </p><pre>sysbench cpu run</pre> allows me to iterate more quickly.
  I'm using this cooler, and I haven't tried any other cooling solutions. <br>

</pre>

<p>arm_freq=3300 or 3.3Ghz is where it gets very unstable.

</p><h2>Firmware</h2>

<p>The 1V limit is in the firmware. The Raspberry Pi is weird, because it starts by running code on the VPU/GPU. It's an obscure Brodcom <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VideoCore">VideoCore</a> instruction set.

</p><p>There's a <a href="https://pip.raspberrypi.com/categories/685-whitepapers-app-notes/documents/RP-004651-WP/Raspberry-Pi-4-Boot-Security.pdf">PDF</a>
 documenting the Raspberry Pi 4 boot security.

</p><p>Basically the first 3 boot stages are BOOTROM (AKA BL0), bootsys, and bootmain. Bootrom is baked into the CPU, bootsys and bootmain are signed, so I can't modify them without the signing key, which I don't have. Somehow I doubt Raspberry Pi or Broadcom would hand me the keys.
  There's some differences between the
  <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/computers/raspberry-pi.html#raspberry-pi-4-and-raspberry-pi-5-boot-flow">Raspberry Pi 4 and 5 boot process.</a>

</p><p>There are some tools to parse and extract the Raspberry Pi 5 firmware (stored on the eeprom):

  <br><a href="https://github.com/raspberrypi/rpi-eeprom/">https://github.com/raspberrypi/rpi-eeprom/</a>

</p><p>Handily, a Github user made <a href="https://github.com/NationalSecurityAgency/ghidra/pull/1147">Ghidra support for Videocore</a>.

</p><p>Searching bootmain for "volt", I found what looks a lot like a voltage limiter.

</p><p><img src="https://jonatron.github.io/randomstuff/pivolt/ghid.png">

</p><p>A single mov.cc instruction can be patched to remove the voltage limit. However, it's in bootmain, which is signed, so we can't just patch bootmain and flash the eeprom.
</p><p>However, as a root linux user on Raspberry Pi full access to system memory, including memory used by the videocore. I mmap'd /dev/vc-mem, searched for the instruction and replaced it, but i'll leave that as an exercise to the reader. I don't want people blaming me if their Pi decides to halt and catch fire.

</p><h2>Slowing down before I speed up</h2>

<p>If I set arm_freq=3300, it isn't stable. Also, I can't use force_turbo. To get it usable, I limited the cpu to 2.9Ghz as early as possible:

</p><pre><b>/lib/systemd/system/slowcpu.service</b></pre>
<br>

<pre>[Unit]
Description=Slow CPU
Before=basic.target
After=local-fs.target sysinit.target
DefaultDependencies=no

[Service]
Type=oneshot
ExecStart=/bin/bash /slowcpu

[Install]
WantedBy=basic.target
</pre>
<br>
<pre><b>/slowcpu</b></pre>
<br>
<pre>echo 2900000 | tee /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu*/cpufreq/scaling_max_freq</pre>
<pre>sudo systemctl enable slowcpu.service</pre>

<p>From there, I can remove the voltage limit:
  <br></p><pre>sudo ./removelimit &amp;&amp; vcgencmd cache_flush</pre>

<p>Then I can put the frequency limit back up to 3.3Ghz
  <br></p><pre>echo 3300000 | sudo tee /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu*/cpufreq/scaling_max_freq</pre>

<p>And make it like force_turbo was on:
  <br></p><pre>echo performance | sudo tee /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu*/cpufreq/scaling_governor</pre>

<p>Checking my voltage and clock with over_voltage_delta=60000:
<br>
</p><pre>$ vcgencmd measure_volts
volt=1.0437V
$ vcgencmd measure_clock arm
frequency(0)=3300034816
</pre>

<p>After all that...</p>

  <br>
  <pre>    total number of events:              37713
    total number of events:              37712
  </pre>

<p>...That wasn't worth it.
