<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Shellz, 37, a nurse from Houston, spends at least two hours a day with her husband playing a casino-style smartphone game called Jackpot Magic.</p><p>The app offers a variety of typical casino games to play, including their favorite, called Reel Rivals, a game in which players accrue points by playing a virtual slot machine. As in a real casino, players exchange money for coins to bet.</p><p>Unlike in a real casino, there is no way to win money back or earn a payout on coins.</p><p>But that has not stopped Shellz and her husband from spending about $150,000 in the game in just two years. She asked to use her in-game username so her family does not find out how much money they have spent on the game.</p><p>"We lie in bed next to each other, we have two tablets, two phones and a computer and all these apps spinning Reel Rivals at the same time," she said. "We normalize it with each other."</p><p>Jackpot Magic is an app made by Big Fish Games of Seattle, one of the leaders in an industry of "free-to-play" social games into which some people have plowed thousands of dollars. Big Fish Games also operates a similar app, Big Fish Casino. Both are labeled as video games, which allows the company and others like it to skirt the tightly regulated U.S. gambling market.</p><p>But unlike the gambling market, apps like Jackpot Magic and Big Fish Casino are under little oversight to determine whether they are fair or whether their business practices are predatory.</p><p>NBC News spoke to 21 people, including Shellz and her husband, who said they were hooked on the casino-style games and had spent significant sums of money. They described feelings of helplessness and wanting to quit but found themselves addicted to the games and tempted by the company's aggressive marketing tactics.</p><p>Most of the 21 players wished to remain anonymous, as they were ashamed of their addictions and did not want their loved ones to find out about their behavior.</p><p>A 42-year-old Pennsylvania woman said she felt saddened that she spent $40,000 on Big Fish Casino while working as an addiction counselor.</p><p>"The whole time I was working as an addiction counselor, I was addicted to gambling and with no hope of winning any money back," she said.</p><p>Big Fish Games did not make anyone available for an interview, nor did the company respond to detailed questions. The company has said in previous <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6878099-206-2.html#document/p4/a561949">court filings</a> that only a fraction of the game's players actually spend money.</p><p>In a response to NBC News' inquiries, the company issued a <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6896112-BF.html">statement</a> saying its games are not gambling and should not be regulated as such.</p><p>"These games are not gambling because, among other reasons, they offer no opportunity for players to win money or anything of value," the statement said in part.</p><p>"Our games are offered for free purely for entertainment, with an opportunity for customers to spend money within the game to enhance their gameplay experience," it said. "The vast majority of Big Fish Casino and Jackpot Magic Slots customers play without ever paying any money. No court has yet considered all of the facts relating to how these games operate."</p><p>Players have had some recourse in recent months thanks to successful lawsuits.</p><p>After a long legal battle, 2 million players, including Shellz and her husband, will be eligible to get a small part of their losses back — about 20 percent for those who lost $10,000 to $100,000.</p><p>The money will come in a $155 million class-action settlement, announced at the end of July, that will cover two major lawsuits filed against Big Fish Games; its former owner, Churchill Downs; and its current Australian parent company, Aristocrat Leisure, alleging that they were operating "unlawful gambling devices."</p><p>The preliminary agreement was recently approved by a federal judge in Tacoma, Washington. Churchill Downs and Aristocrat Leisure both declined to comment on the settlement. Aristocrat Leisure released a public <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/7205179-21354134-b761-4dd7-a3a2-266d8a52056c-1.html">statement</a> in May outlining the general contours of the settlement, but it has not said anything further.</p><p><em><strong><a href="https://smart.link/5d5ad16083f88" target="_blank">Download the NBC News app for breaking news and politics</a></strong></em></p><p>While Big Fish Games admits no wrongdoing, it has <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/7006464-171.html#document/p8/a573737">agreed</a> to implement "addiction-related resources" and a "self-exclusion policy" that would allow players who feel out of control to opt in to be blacklisted from playing the game.</p><p>Big Fish Games also declined to comment on the settlement.</p><p>While some players are happy to recoup some of their losses, gambling addiction experts and some lawmakers say it does not go far enough to help those whose lives have spiraled out of control after they got hooked on social casino games. They call for further regulation of the industry.</p><p>"What we would have welcomed as part of this settlement as a wake-up call for the industry is a change in practices," said Keith Whyte, the executive director of the <a href="https://www.ncpgambling.org/">National Council on Problem Gambling</a>.</p><p>"I think their model is so lucrative and in some ways so aggressive that they're doubling down, and it's going to do a lot more harm. I think it's going to eventually be reined in, but it appears they are prioritizing short-term profit over long-term sustainability and responsibility," Whyte said.</p><h2><strong>The game</strong></h2><p>Joann, 46, who lives in southwest Florida, said she began playing Big Fish Casino about eight years ago.</p><p>She estimates that she has spent $100,000 on the game.</p><p>"You know what I tell people? It's a cult, and they suck you in, and once you're in you can't get out," said Joann, who asked to use only her middle name. "You want to play, and you want to spin."</p><p>One of the named plaintiffs in the settlement is Crystal Fair of Texas, who said in a sworn declaration that she has <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6782706-128-8.html#document/p3/a551787">spent $500,000</a> and described herself as being "addicted" to Big Fish Casino, playing it sometimes "nearly 24 hours a day."</p><p>"I have considered walking away for good but then I think of all my time and more importantly all my money and it's hard to walk away," she wrote. "That's how I know I'm addicted."</p><p>She concluded: "But if I could go back to the point in time when I installed Big Fish Casino, I'd never ever have done it."</p><p>Several people said they felt the apps were engineered to keep them spending money in a variety of ways, including tiered clubs for players who spend significant amounts of money and free chips for people who try to quit.</p><p>Suzie Kelly of Dallas previously told <a href="https://www.revealnews.org/episodes/harpooned-by-facebook/">Reveal News</a> how she spent about $400,000 on the game. She took out a home equity loan and used the money she inherited when her mother died to fund her habit.</p><p>When she tried to cancel her account on several occasions, Kelly said, a "VIP representative" would call her and offer her free chips so she would continue playing.</p><p>The Big Fish apps in some ways are similar to many other apps that offer casino games that can be played on smartphones.</p><p>The home screen of Big Fish Casino, known as the "lobby," offers players a chance to try various types of casino-style games, including roulette, blackjack, Texas Hold 'em, Video Poker and the most prominently featured game: slots.</p><p>Shortly after they install the app, players are encouraged to join clubs — Big Fish Casino even offers a "one time join bonus" of 50,000 chips for joining a club. Once they are in a club, players can use a chat feature to strike up conversations with their counterparts and develop friendships. While anyone can create a club, the real action is in the invitation-only ranked clubs that compete against one another.</p><p>Winning more chips and playing at higher stakes unlock new features, like high-roller rooms. There is also a <a href="https://www.bigfishgames.com/game/jackpotmagicslots/help/articles/115000134954-What-is-the-VIP-Rewards-Program-/">system</a> of "levels" and "tiers" to unlock as players spend and win more. Higher tiers come with larger potential winnings and bigger bets, which makes it easier to lose chips faster.</p><p>Players who lose but want to continue playing in high-roller rooms can do so by either rebuilding their digital fortunes through hours of gameplay or taking a shorter route: buying more chips.</p><p>Most people who play the Big Fish games do not end up spending real money. Less than 10 percent of users have ever bought virtual items while playing the games, <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6878099-206-2.html#document/p4/a561949">according to an October court filing</a>.</p><p>But that 10 percent has translated into a lucrative business. According to data provided by Apptopia, an app analytics company, Big Fish Games took in an estimated $139.3 million from Big Fish Casino and Jackpot Magic players from February 2019 through July 2020.</p><p>The app's tier system, along with its social functions, can be a powerful trap for some players. Joann said she continues to play, as Big Fish Casino grants her a set of free chips (known as a "boost") every day. Even so, she said, she spends at least $600 a month, largely to maintain her status within her club.</p><p>"I want to quit the club, and I want to stop, but I have friends," she said.</p><h2>No recourse</h2><p>Big Fish Games is one of the clearest examples of the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/09/multinational-regulators-join-together-to-fight-gambling-in-video-games/">convergence</a> of the small-time harmless fun of video games and the rapidly expanding world of real-money gambling.</p><p>While many video games have added premium features in recent years, including <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/loot-boxes-gambling-video-games-ftc-look-it-n941256">loot boxes</a> — a mechanism to pay small, fixed fees for chances to win in-game prizes that has attracted the ire of <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/video-games/video-game-loot-boxes-face-final-boss-missouri-senator-n1003471">some lawmakers</a> — no other type of game appears to allow players to lose so much credit so quickly and be constantly encouraged to spend more.</p><p>But for the time being, there does not seem to be anything stopping these gambling-style smartphone games from continuing. No federal legislation would halt this model, nor would any state-level legislation mitigate losses created by this type of game. Washington state legislators considered a bill that would have formally defined games like Big Fish Casino to not be considered gambling, but the bill did not pass.</p><p>Some players of Big Fish games have filed class-action lawsuits against the company, arguing that its games should be regulated just like traditional gambling, which is unlikely to happen any time soon.</p><p>Conventional slot machines, for example, are subject to rigorous outside testing to ensure that the odds are consistent for all players. In Nevada, there are rules about how many slot machines can be <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6922257-All-Regulations-as-of-01-30-20.html#document/p46/a565021">placed in liquor stores</a>, among hundreds of pages of regulations.</p><p>In Washington state — where Big Fish Games is located — slot machines are <a href="https://www.wsgc.wa.gov/regulation-enforcement/illegal-activities">banned</a> outright. But Washingtonians can download a smartphone game that offers would-be gamblers the chance to spend money on an experience nearly identical to that of an in-person slot machine, only without any chance of actually winning money.</p><p>Still, the recent legal victories are a welcome bit of help for some players, particularly because many have lost their jobs because of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p>Neva Barker, 58, a retiree in Portland, Oregon, estimated that she had spent $80,000 on Big Fish Casino and said she was thrilled to hear that she likely would get some of her money back.</p><p>It is particularly needed now, because, Barker says, she lost some of her income to coronavirus-related cutbacks.</p><p>"This has been going through so many ups and downs," she said. "I thought it was a myth that it was ever going to happen. That would be life-changing for me at this point."</p></div><div data-activity-map="expanded-byline-article-bottom"><div data-testid="byline-thumbnail"><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/author/cyrus-farivar-ncpn973741"><picture data-testid="picture"><source srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-60x60,f_auto,q_auto:eco,dpr_2.0/newscms/2019_11/2784541/cyrus-farivar-1500.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-60x60,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2019_11/2784541/cyrus-farivar-1500.jpg 1x"><img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-60x60,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2019_11/2784541/cyrus-farivar-1500.jpg" alt="" height="48" width="48"></picture></a></div><p><span data-testid="byline-name"><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/author/cyrus-farivar-ncpn973741">Cyrus Farivar</a></span><span><a href="https://twitter.com/cfarivar" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span></span></a><a href="mailto:cyrus.farivar@nbcuni.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span></span></a></span></p><p>Cyrus Farivar is a reporter on the tech investigations unit of NBC News in San Francisco.</p></div></div>]]></description>

      Good enough code is a nice middle ground between implementing a feature fast and maintaining the code quality.    </p>
  </div><div>
          <figure><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" width="1200" height="630" src="https://shiftmag.dev/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Code-quality.png?x35993" alt="" srcset="https://shiftmag.dev/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Code-quality.png 1200w, https://shiftmag.dev/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Code-quality-300x158.png 300w, https://shiftmag.dev/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Code-quality-1024x538.png 1024w, https://shiftmag.dev/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Code-quality-768x403.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"></figure>


<p>I’ve heard a story about a student who had to write an essay to pass the exam. He had a three-month deadline. During those months he struggled a lot<strong> rewriting pages again and again</strong>. Every now and then the professor checked on him and he would always respond with “I’m not done yet, it’s simply not good enough”. </p>



<p>Finally, the professor suggested: “Write the essay as if it would be graded <em>good enough</em>“. As much as this approach was strange to him, he took the advice. Surprisingly, he <strong>finished the essay in a whip </strong>earning a <strong>higher grade than expected.</strong></p>



<p>Where I come from, <em>good enough</em> would be a “three”, simply an average grade on a 1 to 5 scale. Solid, acceptable, good.</p>



<h2><span id="the-five-shades-of-code-quality">The five shades of code quality</span></h2>



<p>We, as software developers, not only write essays but dissertations to bring our pile of zeros and ones to life. <strong>Most of us would want our code to be 5 out of 5.</strong> But is this something worth pursuing? Let’s explore five shades of code quality:</p>



<p>1 – Shit</p>



<p>2 – Proof of concept</p>



<p>3 – Good enough</p>



<p>4 – Very good&nbsp;</p>



<p>5 – Perfection</p>



<h2><span id="grade-1-shit">Grade 1: Shit</span></h2>



<p>This is the type of code that makes you sweat. Your heart sinks when you hear about a new requirement. You know it will take up ages to implement it. The best thing you can do is to throw everything away and rewrite it. Such code<strong> shouldn’t be acceptable</strong>, we shouldn’t ship shit.</p>



<h2><span id="grade-2-poc">Grade 2: PoC</span></h2>



<p>Typical PoC code. You know that this code is <strong>not good but you can live with it for a while</strong>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Usual problems:</p>



<ul>
<li>doesn’t have clear architecture, clear boundaries</li>



<li>many things are tightly coupled</li>



<li>many edge cases are not covered</li>



<li>missing validations</li>



<li>inadequate domain object modeling</li>



<li>too complex or too tiny test suite</li>



<li>code is not clean</li>
</ul>



<p>While this may not sound ideal, it can serve to <strong>quickly determine the direction you want to go</strong>. You can move really fast and iterate as you go. This code quality is particularly suitable for PoC initiatives.</p>





<h2><span id="grade-3-good-enough">Grade 3: Good enough</span></h2>



<p>Good enough code is a nice middle ground between implementing a feature fast and maintaining the code quality.</p>



<p>It addresses many of the issues typically found in grade 2 code, with some exceptions:</p>



<ul>
<li>some unnecessary levels of abstraction</li>



<li>some unclear naming</li>



<li>few larger functions or classes (nothing too big)</li>



<li>misuse of exceptions here and there</li>



<li>some code duplications</li>



<li>redundant commenting</li>



<li>readability issues in tests</li>
</ul>



<p>This code is suited for most applications. It’s probably the best for those dealing with CRUD operations. You can also achieve good results using this approach on components involved in traffic flow.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><span id="grade-4-very-good">Grade 4: Very good</span></h2>



<div><p>Grade 4 is a <strong>highly maintainable clean code paradise</strong>. Doesn’t have any problems that <em>good enough</em> has. </p><p>Take a look at the&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/infobip/infobip-spring-data-querydsl" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">infobip-spring-data-querydsl&nbsp;</a>library. <strong>Although it sounds perfect, it’s not.</strong> Everything is by the book, yet you may not like it, or dislike some parts of it. For example, you may find interfaces to be too generic, or you might be bothered with the usage of primitives instead of objects or something else. There will always be something to dislike and that is ok. :D.&nbsp;</p></div>



<p>The problem with this grade is that<strong> it is difficult to achieve.</strong> We have different backgrounds and views about how a really good code should look like.</p>



<p>I’ve worked with a freelancing company whose code was on this level. In order to achieve it, they enforced <strong>highly strict static code analysis</strong> and <strong>really challenging code reviews</strong>. Static code analysis was the cornerstone to stop most of the common problems from&nbsp;<em>good enough</em> entering the codebase. You can view them&nbsp;<a href="https://www.elegantobjects.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>&nbsp;– under principles. Code review consisted of <strong>two reviewers</strong>, <strong>one developer and an architect, plus a QA </strong>person who would check the quality of the review.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you want to tackle with grade 4 you need to <strong>build infrastructure for it</strong> and have everyone onboard with it. Aiming for <strong>this grade will slow you down</strong> so it should be taken into consideration when doing estimations with PD. Clear benefits will be seen in the long run.</p>



<p>This grade might be suited for building libraries that would be used by multiple projects/teams or when building critical parts of a system.</p>



<h2><span id="grade-5-perfection">Grade 5: Perfection</span></h2>



<p>Doesn’t exist.</p>



<h2><span id="good-enough-is-the-way-to-go">Good enough is the way to go</span></h2>



<p>Daily we are faced with different requirements, different deadlines, scopes, and so on. They are, of course, not always quick and simple to solve but most of the time,&nbsp;the <em>good enough</em>&nbsp;approach is the way to go. </p>



<p>To me, the code that has a clear architecture, understandable names of services, and good tests ticks all the boxes. And I like it! It doesn’t have to be a clean-code candy. If you prefer candies, then you have to convince PD and your team that this extra sugar will benefit the project.</p>



<p>What would you say, what would be your preferred coding approach?</p>

    <h3 id="ocaml-first-impressions">OCaml: First impressions</h3>

<h4 id="the-why">The Why</h4>

<p>I’m somewhat of a language nerd to begin with, and it was Rust that originally got me interested in the whole functional paradigm.
Not due to it’s lineage, but the heavy use of chained iterator methods in favor over traditional loops. This is one of the more intimidating hurdles
for newcomers to the language, but after getting used to it, rarely will you see anyone write a <code>for</code> loop again.</p>

<p><strong>Rant:</strong> The argument can be made that what I’m talking about is more similar to Javascript-land where a bunch of pseudo-functional methods and terminology are 
used, but it in reality is as far away from functional programming as <code>useState()</code> would imply it is. 
At least Rust has a few things to back it up, as at least a language that will support you should you desire to write pure functional code. I would argue that for beginners, Rust will simply force you to write functional, immutable code, whether they really understand it or otherwise, as the amount of <code>.clone()</code>‘ing required for a newcomer to compile a non-trivial program will practically almost guarantee that nothing was actually <code>&amp;mut</code>ated*.</p>

<p>So this got me interested in watching some <em>GOTO</em>, <em>strangeloop</em>, and other conference talks about functional programming, and upon discovering @artemslab
(definitely go check it out, awesome content) on YouTube and watching some in-depth videos about Ocaml and it’s runtime integer representations and memory
allocation, that really got me fascinated with the language.</p>

<p>In the past, I typically wouldn’t hesitate to <code>sudo pacman -Sy </code> whatever compiler or interpreter I needed, to get started playing around with a new language I was interested in. However since getting full-time employment, on top of the existing OSS stuff,
as well as doing contracted gigs for the facility I’m in, I haven’t had so much as a moment to spend on anything un-related to these things in quite some time.</p>

<p>Anyways, as usual I’m off track here. My point is that I <em>thought</em> I had a good introduction to the world of FP, and I <em>thought</em> since I’d heard that many of the
features and some of the syntax we love from Rust came directly from tha ‘Caml itself, I thought I would be love it and picking it up would be second nature.</p>

<p>My plan was to do the entire Advent of Code in Ocaml, and I was also going to pick an ambitious project that I would otherwise use Rust for, and force myself
to use Ocaml. I find this is the best way to learn a language, is just take on a project that is significantly more ambitious than your current skill level, and by thetime you finish it, you’ll have not only saved yourself a bunch of wasted time on tutorials, but you’ll have made something cool (hopefully).</p>

<h3 id="i-have-two-gripes-with-the-language-so-far">I have two gripes with the language (so far)..</h3>

<h3 id="where-are-the-types-">Where are the types? 👀</h3>

<p>I underestimated how much I would be thrown off by the fact that the types are <em>heavily</em> inferred, and are almost never explicitly declared, from what I can tell. I found that the combination of this and the strange syntax really screws me up, as now I am having problems inferring my <em>own</em> types at this point…</p>

<p>When dealing with lots of recursive functions, you find yourself looking up often at the function signature to view the parameters, but the concise syntax makes it difficult to mentally parse quickly.</p>

<p>Example, random code snippet from ocaml.org:</p>
<pre><code>  let group list sizes =
    let initial = List.map (fun size -&gt; size, []) sizes in

  let prepend p list =
    let emit l acc = l :: acc in
    let rec aux emit acc = function
      | [] -&gt; emit [] acc
      | (n, l) as h :: t -&gt;
         let acc = if n &gt; 0 then emit ((n - 1, p :: l) :: t) acc
                   else acc in
         aux (fun l acc -&gt; emit (h :: l) acc) acc t
    in
    aux emit [] list
  in
  let rec aux = function
    | [] -&gt; [initial]
    | h :: t -&gt; List.concat_map (prepend h) (aux t)
  in
  let all = aux list in
  let complete = List.filter (List.for_all (fun (x, _) -&gt; x = 0)) all in
    List.map (List.map snd) complete;;
val group : 'a list -&gt; int list -&gt; 'a list list list = &lt;fun&gt;
;;
</code></pre>
<p>Even when you learn what it actually going on here, and it makes immediate sense to you.. It must take a while before it becomes easier to read.</p>

<h3 id="remember-recursion-how-about-linked-lists">Remember recursion? How about linked lists?</h3>

<p>Two things every Computer science student learns, and then are immediately told to never use again*…</p>

<p>Anything that can be done recursively can be done iteratively (and most optimizing compilers will replace your recursion anyway), and linked lists are slow and inefficient with modern CPU caches, and you should almost never use them (and if you’re a web dev, well, you just wouldn’t anyway).</p>

<p>You could describe Ocaml as a language that relies <strong>heavily</strong> on <em>both</em> of these things. This feels even more strange that it might seem it would, and I have
found myself stumbling on absolutely remedial tasks.</p>

<p>Yes, there are libraries with other data structures, and there are in fact <code>for</code> loops (and even <code>while</code> loops), However I feel like I will end up learning more of the language and find that iterator methods will be used more so than any of these, much as in Rust.</p>

<h2 id="the-good">The Good:</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Thought provoking. If you don’t believe there is anything to gain from being forced to think about something you do every day in a completely different way… well I’m surprised you made it this far into the post.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Awesome mixture of !significant-whitespace and !brackets. And how cool is the comment syntax? (* doesn’t it just feel like.. middle-eastern-ish *);;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Tooling: is way better than it has any right to be, considering the size of it’s user-base and community.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Great conversation starter, really cool and helpful community.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Lots more to learn for sure but these were my initial thoughts anyway, I do really want to like it so we will see how much that helps. I just definitely did not get the head-start I was expecting, but I don’t think that’s a negative thing it just means there is more to learn.</p>

<p>*obviously I know this isn’t true and an extreme exaggeration, but I thought it was funny. There’s always someone who will ‘well ackshually’ you when 
you think it’s obvious.</p>

Will still try to do a blog post on my @CSAW_NYUTandon CTF challenge, NERV Center, but for now here's a thread explaining the key mechanics. I put a lot of work into the aesthetics, like this easter egg credit sequence (all ANSI colors+unicode text) that contains key hints: <span><video controls="" poster="https://pbs.twimg.com/ext_tw_video_thumb/1723398329193603073/pu/img/BOjilHxex46DHgNz.jpg"><source src="https://video.twimg.com/ext_tw_video/1723398329193603073/pu/vid/avc1/320x270/T7o7Rg69CJYAflcu.mp4?tag=12" type="video/mp4"><br>

<sup><i></i></sup>
</p>
<p>
@CSAW_NYUTandon (Note the karaoke subtitles timed to the credits at the bottom 😁)
<sup><i></i></sup>
</p>
<p>
@CSAW_NYUTandon First, the vulnerability. If you read the man page for select(), you'll see this warning: select() is limited to monitoring file descriptors numbered less than 1024. But modern systems can have many more open files, and importantly the kernel select() interface is NOT limited. <span><a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/F-q-tpjXwAAKWQk.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="DESCRIPTION  WARNING: select() can monitor only file descriptors numbers  that  are  less than  FD_SETSIZE  (1024)—an  unreasonably low limit for many modern applications—and this limitation will not change.  All modern  applications  should instead use poll(2) or epoll(7), which do not suffer this limitation." src="https://threadreaderapp.com/images/1px.png" data-src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/F-q-tpjXwAAKWQk.jpg"></a></span>
<sup><i></i></sup>
</p>
<p>
@CSAW_NYUTandon But IMO the man page understates the severity of the problem. So what happens if you *do* try to monitor fds higher than 1024? Well, the fd_set struct is just a bitset of 1024 bits (128 bytes). So attempting to monitor fds larger than 1024 will cause memory corruption!
<sup><i></i></sup>
</p>
<p>
@CSAW_NYUTandon And the really cool part (to me) is that a) the corruption is bitwise, since the data structure is a bitset, and b) the exact bits that will be written out of bounds depend on the *state* of the file descriptors being monitored.
<sup><i></i></sup>
</p>
<p>
@CSAW_NYUTandon So if the fds correspond to, say, network connections, an attacker can make a large number of connections, arrange for them to be in just the right state, and thereby get precise control over the bit pattern that gets written.
<sup><i></i></sup>
</p>
<p>
@CSAW_NYUTandon (Side note: I discovered this because very old versions of QEMU—including the one used by our PANDA 1.0-based malware sandbox—had this bug and guests could trigger it in the SLIRP user mode networking by making a large number of connections. Yikes! )<a data-preview="true" href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=892977">bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?i…</a>
<sup><i></i></sup>
</p>
<p>
@CSAW_NYUTandon select() takes up to three bitsets: readfds, writefds, and exceptfds, so each is susceptible to this overflow. I decided to have the intended overflow occur on exceptfds.
<sup><i></i></sup>
</p>
<p>
@CSAW_NYUTandon Why? Two reasons: 1) it's third in the argument list so it naturally would be the last one listed in, say, a struct; 2) the fd states can be controlled more easily—with TCP connections, exceptfds is used to indicate connections with pending TCP out-of-band (OOB) data.
<sup><i></i></sup>
</p>
<p>
@CSAW_NYUTandon So now the basic exploit strategy is clear: make more than 1024 connections to the server, an send TCP OOB data to the ones with fds higher than 1024 to set your desired bit pattern. But exactly what should get overwritten?
<sup><i></i></sup>
</p>
<p>
@CSAW_NYUTandon That's when this challenge moved from just Pwn to Pwn+Crypto :D I decided to place an RSA public key used for ssh-style challenge/response auth right after the exceptfds bitset, so you can control the upper 64 bits using the vuln. <span><a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/F-rD9ZUXEAAySUm.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="Image" src="https://threadreaderapp.com/images/1px.png" data-src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/F-rD9ZUXEAAySUm.jpg"></a></span>
<sup><i></i></sup>
</p>
<p>
@CSAW_NYUTandon What can you do with the ability to control the top 64 bits of a 1024-bit RSA public key N? Well, N = pq, which is hard to factor. But the *corrupted* N' is very likely to be a product of a bunch of smaller primes—which is easy to factor!
<sup><i></i></sup>
</p>
<p>
@CSAW_NYUTandon I first learned of this trick from the super cool USENIX Security 2016 paper Flip Feng Shui by Kaveh Razavi, @bjg et al., who used it in conjunction with RowHammer and memory deduplication to bypass SSH authentication. <a data-preview="true" href="https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity16/technical-sessions/presentation/razavi">usenix.org/conference/use…</a><br>
<span><a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/F-rFbfPXgAA3Ezz.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="Image" src="https://threadreaderapp.com/images/1px.png" data-src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/F-rFbfPXgAA3Ezz.jpg"></a></span>
<sup><i></i></sup>
</p>
<p>
@CSAW_NYUTandon (One of the players who solved the challenge during CSAW CTF finals actually found an even sweeter way to exploit this vuln: figure out a bit pattern that makes N *prime* and set that. Then the corresponding private key d is just: pow(65537, -1, n-1). Slick!)
<sup><i></i></sup>
</p>
<p>
@CSAW_NYUTandon Once you've factored the key (or made it prime) and figured out the secret key d for the corrupted public key, you can use it to forge signatures and bypass the authentication, allowing you to download the flag (encrypted with RSA+AES-256-GCM). <span><a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/F-rInsJXEAAuE0Q.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="Image" src="https://threadreaderapp.com/images/1px.png" data-src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/F-rInsJXEAAuE0Q.jpg"></a></span>
<sup><i></i></sup>
</p>
<p>
@CSAW_NYUTandon Okay, but now on to the important stuff: ~aesthetics~. The theme of the challenge was based around Episode 13 of Neon Genesis Evangelion, which features an Angel that hacks NERV's MAGI supercomputer cluster.
<sup><i></i></sup>
</p>
<p>
@CSAW_NYUTandon I realized that three computers in the MAGI cluster (Casper, Balthasar, and Melchior) correspond neatly to the three fd_sets readfds, writefds, and exceptds. So I was able to make a cute UI that shows the state of the fd_sets in real-time. <span><video controls="" poster="https://pbs.twimg.com/ext_tw_video_thumb/1723411409579429888/pu/img/8Bjj0p8WU4HfW3jo.jpg"><source src="https://video.twimg.com/ext_tw_video/1723411409579429888/pu/vid/avc1/320x270/qYrDaeco3ZV7Csnc.mp4?tag=12" type="video/mp4"><br>

<sup><i></i></sup>
</p>
<p>
@CSAW_NYUTandon Aside from being my best attempt at recreating the UI from the show (pictured here), the UI elements also have some key clues to the vulnerability. <span><a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/F-rKhHpWsAAmxom.png" target="_blank"><img alt="Image" src="https://threadreaderapp.com/images/1px.png" data-src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/F-rKhHpWsAAmxom.png"></a></span>
<sup><i></i></sup>
</p>
<p>
@CSAW_NYUTandon - The CODE field shows the highest file descriptor in use, and the EXTENTION (sic) shows the server's max fd ulimit.<br>
- The box on the right turns red when the highest FD is &gt; 1024.<br>
- The UI gets slightly corrupted precisely when there is actual memory corruption happening. <span><a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/F-rMd-3XMAAn0aj.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="Image" src="https://threadreaderapp.com/images/1px.png" data-src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/F-rMd-3XMAAn0aj.jpg"></a></span>

@CSAW_NYUTandon All of the visuals in the challenge were created using plain unicode characters and ANSI colors, so you can just cat the text files to see them (or dump them over a network socket). <span><video controls="" poster="https://pbs.twimg.com/ext_tw_video_thumb/1723415475378393089/pu/img/nUXZ6x6EkzpNC3jm.jpg"><source src="https://video.twimg.com/ext_tw_video/1723415475378393089/pu/vid/avc1/320x270/gcU1d77FxNPgoyFt.mp4?tag=12" type="video/mp4"><br>

<p>
@CSAW_NYUTandon Finally, a bit on the mechanics of developing this challenge. First, it ended up being rather a lot of C code, so I was super worried about accidentally introducing an unintended vuln that would make the challenge boring. <span><a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/F-rPWU8WIAAVCx8.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="Image" src="https://threadreaderapp.com/images/1px.png" data-src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/F-rPWU8WIAAVCx8.jpg"></a></span>
<sup><i></i></sup>
</p>
<p>
@CSAW_NYUTandon To guard against this I wrote a bunch of libfuzzer targets, network torture tests in Python, and traditional CTest unit tests. I think it worked! I didn't hear of anyone finding a vuln in the challenge except the one I intended. <br>

@CSAW_NYUTandon Another bit that took some work was making the challenge consistently solvable. With select(), you fill the fd_set with 1s, call select, and the kernel fills the set with the actual fd state. But that means that 1/2 the time the key is corrupted by all 1s instead of your bits!
<sup><i></i></sup>
</p>
<p>
@CSAW_NYUTandon This makes exploitation annoying, to say the least. So I introduced a mechanism that lets players pause and resume the thread calling select(), so the corrupted key stays in place during factoring/signing/encrypting. <span><a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/F-rThOzXcAAPWzh.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="Image" src="https://threadreaderapp.com/images/1px.png" data-src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/F-rThOzXcAAPWzh.jpg"></a></span>
<sup><i></i></sup>
</p>
<p>
@CSAW_NYUTandon Oh, a couple more bits of aesthetics. The sensor port (the one you actually use for the overflow, lets you look at some cards for the various angels: <br>
<span><span><span><a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/F-rUrwoWAAAD5kP.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="Image" src="https://threadreaderapp.com/images/1px.png" data-src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/F-rUrwoWAAAD5kP.jpg"></a></span></span><br>

<sup><i></i></sup>
</p>
<p>
@CSAW_NYUTandon That functionality also hides the easter egg: by calling EXAMINE on three angels in a row where the first letter of their names spell out "RSA" (e.g., Ramiel, Sandalphon, Adam), you can activate the credit sequence shown in the first tweet. <span><span><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-align="center" data-dnt="true"><a href="https://twitter.com/moyix/status/1723398619313603068">https://twitter.com/moyix/status/1723398619313603068</a></blockquote></span></span>
<sup><i></i></sup>
</p>
<p>
@CSAW_NYUTandon And I think it's always fun to taunt the players a little bit. That's why when you fail the challenge-response authentication, Asuka shows up to make fun of you. (There are a few other images included for other errors, but they're harder to trigger.) <span><a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/F-rVjxLW0AAlWIQ.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="Image" src="https://threadreaderapp.com/images/1px.png" data-src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/F-rVjxLW0AAlWIQ.jpg"></a></span>
<sup><i></i></sup>
</p>
<p>
@CSAW_NYUTandon I learned a few fun things while making this challenge. First, Python crypto libraries like pycryptodome do NOT enjoy working with prime or multi-prime keys. I used OpenSSL directly instead in my solver, but some players monkeypatched the Python library. <a data-preview="true" href="https://github.com/moyix/csaw23_nervcenter/tree/main/solver">github.com/moyix/csaw23_n…</a>
<sup><i></i></sup>
</p>
<p>
@CSAW_NYUTandon Second, one variant of the challenge I tried ran into an interesting issue. I considered byte-swapping the key so that players could only set the LSB. But it turns out half of those keys are unusable, because OpenSSL uses Montgomery multiplication, which requires an odd modulus.
<sup><i></i></sup>
</p>
<p>
@CSAW_NYUTandon Tommaso Gagliardoni of Kudelski Security also suggested a variant on the core RSA overwrite that would also have been fun - allow the overwrite to make the key BIGGER by extending into adjacent data in memory. Sadly I didn't have time to implement this. <span><a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/F-rYbWoW8AA561k.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="Image" src="https://threadreaderapp.com/images/1px.png" data-src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/F-rYbWoW8AA561k.jpg"></a></span>
<sup><i></i></sup>
</p>
<p>
@CSAW_NYUTandon Okay this thread is now officially WAY too long, so I'll wrap up by saying that I had a great time writing the challenge, and I'm thrilled that it all came together and people enjoyed playing it!

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

        
  
      <div><p><a title="" href="https://www.heise.de/news/Microsoft-krallt-sich-Zugangsdaten-Achtung-vorm-neuen-Outlook-9357691.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">"Microsoft steals access data"</a> - When the well-known German IT portal "Heise Online" uses such drastic words in its headline, then something is up. If Microsoft has its way, all Windows users will have to switch to the latest version of Microsoft Outlook. But: Not only can the IMAP and SMTP access data of your e-mail account be transferred to Microsoft, but all e-mails in the INBOX can also be copied to the Microsoft servers, even if you have your mailbox with a completely different provider such as mailbox.org.</p></div>
<h2>Main risk: Transferring your data to Microsoft "Synchronisation with the Microsoft server" - and everything is copied!</h2>
<p>If you set up a new account in the software, Microsoft offers a supposed security function: It says that non-Microsoft accounts are synchronised with the Microsoft cloud and that copies of "emails, calendars and contacts are therefore synchronised between your email provider and Microsoft data centres".</p>
<p>Anyone who reads this carefully may be perplexed, no question. But we all know how easy it is to agree to supposed banalities without reading them and to click away notices, especially when setting up software. In view of the drastic consequences of giving consent here, the warnings and explanations from Microsoft are probably too inconspicuous. Only a few users will realise that they are giving Microsoft comprehensive access to passwords, mail and more. Therefore, once again clearly:</p>
<p><strong>Microsoft gets full access to mails, calendars and contacts!</strong></p>
<div><p>But not only Windows users are at risk: Outlook versions for iOS, Mac and even Android are also affected, according to Heise.</p></div>
<h2>mailbox.org warns against using the new Microsoft Outlook</h2>
<p>mailbox.org warns its users: there is a high risk that sensitive data may be transmitted to Microsoft when using the new Outlook! And by the way: this compromised data includes not only emails, but also calendar and contact data.</p>
  
  
  

</div><p>For <strong>business customers</strong>, storing personal data in this way (albeit unintentionally) may constitute a GDPR offence that is subject to fines. After all, storing data in the Microsoft cloud legally constitutes data processing that requires the conclusion of an order data processing agreement (DPA) with Microsoft - and companies may have to identify this as such in their data protection declarations and in the data processing directory. It is irrelevant whether this is done intentionally by the company management or ultimately through the uninformed consent of an individual employee.</p><div>

        
  
      
<h2>Our recommendation</h2>
<p>Whether business or private: We strongly advise all our customers not to use the new Outlook! And we have the following alternatives for you:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Another e-mail client:</strong> We advise you to switch to the popular e-mail client "Thunderbird" on your computer. This is compatible with Windows and easy to set up. On mobile devices, there are a number of different IMAP mail clients, such as FairEmail and K9 Mail (which will also be called Thunderbird in the future).</li>
<li><strong>Using the webmailer:</strong> As a mailbox.org customer, you can use our secure webmail portal at any time, which offers an excellent alternative to desktop email clients. In addition to mail, calendar and contacts, you also have secure access to files and Office documents - and your personal video conference with OpenTalk is just a click away.</li>
</ul>
<p>We do everything we can to protect the security and privacy of your e-mail communication. But we also need your help: make sure you use apps from providers that respect and protect your privacy and security.</p>

<h2>Update</h2>
<p>The German Federal Commissioner for Data Protection and Freedom of Information, Ulrich Kelber, is also alarmed: On the <a title="social media network Mastodon" href="https://social.mailbox.org/@bfdi@social.bund.de/111381793879390891" target="_blank" rel="noopener">social media network Mastodon</a>, he described the data collection as "alarming" and announced his intention to pursue the issue at European level through the data protection authorities as early as next Tuesday.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
												<p>In the summer of 2022, KrebsOnSecurity <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2022/07/experian-you-have-some-explaining-to-do/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">documented</a> the plight of several readers who had their accounts at big-three consumer credit reporting bureau <strong>Experian</strong> hijacked after identity thieves simply re-registered the accounts using a different email address. Sixteen months later, Experian clearly has not addressed this gaping lack of security. I know that because my account at Experian was recently hacked, and the only way I could recover access was by recreating the account.</p>
<div id="attachment_65607"><p><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-65607" decoding="async" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/exp-forgot.png" alt="" width="749" height="381" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/exp-forgot.png 953w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/exp-forgot-768x391.png 768w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/exp-forgot-782x398.png 782w" sizes="(max-width: 749px) 100vw, 749px"></p><p id="caption-attachment-65607">Entering my SSN and birthday at Experian showed my identity was tied to an email address I did not authorize.</p></div>
<p>I recently ordered a copy of my credit file from Experian via <a href="https://www.annualcreditreport.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">annualcreditreport.com</a>, but as usual Experian declined to provide it, saying they couldn’t verify my identity. Attempts to log in to my account directly at Experian.com also failed; the site said it didn’t recognize my username and/or password.</p>
<p>A request for my Experian account username required my full Social Security number and date of birth, after which the website displayed portions of an email address I never authorized and did not recognize (the full address was redacted by Experian).</p>
<p>I immediately suspected that Experian was still allowing anyone to recreate their credit file account using the same personal information but a different email address, a major authentication failure that was explored in last year’s story, <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2022/07/experian-you-have-some-explaining-to-do/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Experian, You Have Some Explaining to Do</a>. So once again I sought to re-register as myself at Experian.</p>
<p>The homepage said I needed to provide a Social Security number and mobile phone number, and that I’d soon receive a link that I should click to verify myself. The site claims that the phone number you provide will be used to help validate your identity. But it appears you could supply any phone number in the United States at this stage in the process, and Experian’s website would not balk. <em>Regardless, users can simply skip this step by selecting the option to “Continue another way.”</em></p>
<p>Experian then asks for your full name, address, date of birth, Social Security number, email address and chosen password. After that, they require you to successfully answer between three to five multiple-choice security questions whose answers are very often based on public records. When I recreated my account this week, only two of the five questions pertained to my real information, and both of those questions concerned street addresses we’ve previously lived at — information that is just a Google search away.</p>
<p>Assuming you sail through the multiple-choice questions, you’re prompted to create a 4-digit PIN and provide an answer to one of several pre-selected challenge questions. After that, your new account is created and you’re directed to the Experian dashboard, which allows you to view your full credit file, and freeze or unfreeze it.</p>
<p>At this point, Experian will send a message to the old email address tied to the account, saying certain aspects of the user profile have changed. But this message isn’t a request seeking verification: It’s just a notification from Experian that the account’s user data has changed, and the original user is offered zero recourse here other than to a click a link to log in at Experian.com.</p>
<div id="attachment_65605"><p><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-65605" decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/expupdates.png" alt="" width="750" height="707"></p><p id="caption-attachment-65605">If you don’t have an Experian account, it’s a good idea to create one. Because at least then you will receive one of these&nbsp; emails when someone hijacks your credit file at Experian.</p></div>
<p>And of course, a user who receives one of these notices will find that the credentials to their Experian account no longer work. Nor do their PIN or account recovery question, because those have been changed also. Your only option at this point is recreate your account at Experian and steal it back from the ID thieves!</p>
<p>In contrast, if you try to modify an existing account at either of the other two major consumer credit reporting bureaus — <strong>Equifax</strong> or <strong>TransUnion</strong> — they will ask you to enter a code sent to the email address or phone number on file before any changes can be made.</p>
<p>Reached for comment, Experian declined to share the full email address that was added without authorization to my credit file.</p>
<p>“To ensure the protection of consumers’ identities and information, we have implemented a multi-layered security approach, which includes passive and active measures, and are constantly evolving,” Experian spokesperson <strong>Scott Anderson</strong> said in an emailed statement. “This includes knowledge-based questions and answers, and device possession and ownership verification processes.”</p>
<p>Anderson said all consumers have the option to activate a multi-factor authentication method that’s requested each time they log in to their account. But what good is multi-factor authentication if someone can simply recreate your account with a new phone number and email address?<span id="more-65594"></span></p>
<p>Several readers who spotted <a href="https://infosec.exchange/@briankrebs/111383547431806668" target="_blank" rel="noopener">my rant about Experian on Mastodon</a> earlier this week responded to a request to validate my findings. The Mastodon user <a href="https://infosec.exchange/@jackerbee@cyberplace.social" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@Jackerbee</a> is a reader from Michican who works in the biotechnology industry. @Jackerbee said when prompted by Experian to provide his phone number and the last four digits of his SSN, he chose the option to “manually enter my information.”</p>
<p>“I put my second phone number and the new email address,” he explained. “I received a single email in my original account inbox that said they’ve updated my information after I ‘signed up.’ No verification required from the original email address at any point. I also did not receive any text alerts at the original phone number. The especially interesting and egregious part is that when I sign in, it does 2FA with the new phone number.”</p>
<p>The Mastodon user <a href="https://infosec.exchange/@PeteMayo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PeteMayo</a> said they recreated their Experian account twice this week, the second time by supplying a random landline number.</p>
<p>“The only difference: it asked me FIVE questions about my personal history (last time it only asked three) before proclaiming, ‘Welcome back, Pete!,’ and granting full access,” @PeteMayo wrote. “I feel silly saving my password for Experian; may as well just make a new account every time.”</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/petemayo.png" alt="" width="748" height="479"></p>
<p>I was fortunate in that whoever hijacked my account did not also thaw my credit freeze.&nbsp; Or if they did, they politely froze it again when they were done. But I fully expect my Experian account will be hijacked yet again unless Experian makes some important changes to its authentication process.</p>
<p>It boggles the mind that these fundamental authentication weaknesses have been allowed to persist for so long at Experian, which already has a horrible track record in this regard.</p>
<p>In December 2022, KrebsOnSecurity <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2023/01/identity-thieves-bypassed-experian-security-to-view-credit-reports/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">alerted</a> Experian that identity thieves had worked out a remarkably simple way to bypass its security and access <em>any</em> consumer’s full credit report — armed with nothing more than a person’s name, address, date of birth, and Social Security number. Experian fixed the glitch, and acknowledged that it <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2023/01/experian-glitch-exposing-credit-files-lasted-47-days/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">persisted for nearly seven weeks</a>, between Nov. 9, 2022 and Dec. 26, 2022.</p>
<p>In April 2021, KrebsOnSecurity revealed how identity thieves were&nbsp;<a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2021/04/experians-credit-freeze-security-is-still-a-joke/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">exploiting lax authentication on Experian’s PIN retrieval page</a>&nbsp;to unfreeze consumer credit files. In those cases, Experian failed to send any notice via email when a freeze PIN was retrieved, nor did it require the PIN to be sent to an email address already associated with the consumer’s account.</p>
<p>A few days after that April 2021 story, KrebsOnSecurity broke the news that&nbsp;<a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2021/04/experian-api-exposed-credit-scores-of-most-americans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an Experian API was exposing the credit scores of most Americans</a>.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <article role="article">
  
  
  <div><p><b></b><span>Today, almost everything about our lives is digitally recorded and stored somewhere. Each credit card purchase, personal medical diagnosis, and preference about music and books is recorded and then used to predict what we like and dislike, and—ultimately—who we are.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>This often happens without our knowledge or consent. Personal information that corporations collect from our online behaviors sells for astonishing profits and incentivizes online actors to collect as much as possible. Every mouse click and screen swipe can be tracked and then sold to ad-tech companies and the data brokers that service them.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>In an attempt to justify this pervasive surveillance ecosystem, corporations often claim to de-identify our data. This supposedly removes all personal information (such as a person’s name) from the data point (such as the fact that an unnamed person bought a particular medicine at a particular time and place). Personal data can also be aggregated, whereby data about multiple people is combined with the intention of removing </span><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2009/09/what-information-personally-identifiable"><span>personal identifying information</span></a><span> and thereby protecting user privacy.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Sometimes companies say our personal data is “anonymized,” implying a one-way ratched where it can never be dis-aggregated and re-identified. But this is not possible—anonymous data rarely stays this way. As Professor Matt Blaze, an expert in the field of cryptography and data privacy, </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/19/us/coronavirus-location-tracking.html"><span>succinctly summarized</span></a><span>: “something that seems anonymous, more often than not, is not anonymous, even if it’s designed with the best intentions.”&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><b>Anonymization…and Re-Identification?</b></h3>
<p><span>Personal data can be considered on a </span><a href="https://georgetownlawtechreview.org/re-identification-of-anonymized-data/GLTR-04-2017/"><span>spectrum of identifiability</span></a><span>. At the top is data that can directly identify people, such as a name or state identity number, which can be referred to as “direct identifiers.” Next is information indirectly linked to individuals, like personal phone numbers and email addresses, which some call “indirect identifiers.” After this comes data connected to multiple people, such as a favorite restaurant or movie. The other end of this spectrum is information that cannot be linked to any specific person—such as aggregated census data, and data that is not directly related to individuals at all like weather reports.</span></p>
<p><span>Data anonymization is often </span><a href="https://deliverypdf.ssrn.com/delivery.php?ID=926110097116071012112098112084025092029042041058054022096075006072105102108068091081035042057063112008038075092019127024108106031044060037085067082120125007124123056087053067019094021074127009122023072067065111114088090076068125120081075010085067125&amp;EXT=pdf&amp;INDEX=TRUE"><span>undertaken in two ways</span></a><span>. First, some personal identifiers like our names and social security numbers might be deleted. Second, other categories of personal information might be modified—such as obscuring our bank account numbers. For example, the Safe Harbor provision contained with the U.S. Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) requires that only the </span><a href="https://georgetownlawtechreview.org/re-identification-of-anonymized-data/GLTR-04-2017/"><span>first three digits</span></a><span> of a zip code can be reported in scrubbed data.</span></p>
<p>However, in practice, any attempt at de-identification requires removal not only of your identifiable information, but also of information that can identify you when considered in combination with other information known about you. Here's an example:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><span>First, think about the number of people that share your specific ZIP or postal code.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span>Next, think about how many of those people also share your birthday.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span>Now, think about how many people share your exact birthday, ZIP code, and gender.&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>According to one </span><a href="https://dataprivacylab.org/projects/identifiability/paper1.pdf"><span>landmark study</span></a><span>, these three characteristics are enough to uniquely identify 87% of the U.S. population. A </span><a href="https://crypto.stanford.edu/~pgolle/papers/census.pdf"><span>different study</span></a><span> showed that 63% of the U.S. population can be uniquely identified from these three facts.</span></p>
<p>We cannot trust corporations to self-regulate. The financial benefit and business usefulness of our personal data often outweighs our privacy and anonymity. In re-obtaining the real identity of the person involved (direct identifier) alongside a person’s preferences (indirect identifier), corporations are able to continue profiting from our most sensitive information. For instance, a website that asks supposedly “anonymous” users for seemingly trivial information about themselves may be able to use that information to make a unique profile for an individual.&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>Location Surveillance</b></h3>
<p><span>To understand this system in practice, we can look at </span><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/03/governments-havent-shown-location-surveillance-would-help-contain-covid-19"><span>location data</span></a><span>. This includes the data collected by </span><a href="https://www.eff.org/issues/location-data-brokers"><span>apps on your mobile device</span></a><span> about your whereabouts: from the weekly trips to your local supermarket to your last appointment at a health center, an immigration clinic, or a protest planning meeting. The collection of this location data on our devices is sufficiently precise for law enforcement to place suspects at the scene of a crime, and for juries to convict people on the basis of that evidence. What’s more, whatever personal data is collected by the government can be </span><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2017/05/california-authorities-still-ignoring-rising-abuse-police-databases"><span>misused</span></a><span> by its employees, </span><a href="https://www.wired.com/2016/10/inside-cyberattack-shocked-us-government/"><span>stolen</span></a><span> by criminals or foreign governments, and used in unpredictable ways by agency leaders for </span><a href="https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2007-mar-31-na-census31-story.html"><span>nefarious new purposes</span></a><span>. And </span><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/01/what-we-learned-oakland-raw-alpr-data"><span>all</span></a> <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2017/04/next-steps-toward-reforming-californias-unfair-gang-databases"><span>too</span></a> <a href="https://www.aclunc.org/blog/facebook-instagram-and-twitter-provided-data-access-surveillance-product-marketed-target"><span>often</span></a><span>, such high tech surveillance disparately burdens people of color.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Practically speaking, there is </span><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/04/how-protect-privacy-when-aggregating-location-data-fight-covid-19"><span>no way to de-identify individual location data</span></a><span> since these data points serve as unique personal identifiers of their own. And even when location data is said to have been anonymized, re-identification can be achieved by correlating de-identified data with other publicly available data like voter rolls or information that's sold by </span><a href="https://www.eff.org/wp/behind-the-one-way-mirror"><span>data brokers</span></a><span>. One </span><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/srep01376"><span>study from 2013</span></a><span> found that researchers could uniquely identify 50% of people using only two randomly chosen time and location data points.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Done right, </span><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/04/how-protect-privacy-when-aggregating-location-data-fight-covid-19"><span>aggregating</span></a><span> location data can work towards preserving our personal rights to privacy by producing non-individualized counts of behaviors instead of detailed timelines of individual location history. For instance, an aggregation might tell you how many people’s phones reported their location as being in a certain city within the last month, but not the exact phone number and other data points that would connect this directly and personally to you. However, there’s often pressure on the experts doing the aggregation to generate granular aggregate data sets that might be more meaningful to a particular decision-maker but which simultaneously expose individuals to an erosion of their personal privacy.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Moreover, most </span><a href="https://www.eff.org/wp/behind-the-one-way-mirror#Part1"><span>third-party location tracking</span></a><span> is designed to build profiles of real people. This means that every time a tracker collects a piece of information, it needs something to tie that information to a particular person. This can happen indirectly by correlating collected data with a particular device </span><a href="https://coveryourtracks.eff.org/"><span>or browser</span></a><span>, which might later correlate to one person or a group of people, such as a household. Trackers can also use artificial identifiers, like </span><a href="https://www.eff.org/wp/behind-the-one-way-mirror#AdvertisingIDs"><span>mobile ad IDs</span></a><a href="https://www.eff.org/wp/behind-the-one-way-mirror#Cookies"><span> and </span><span>cookies</span></a><span> to reach users with targeted messaging. And “anonymous” profiles of personal information can</span><a href="https://www.uclalawreview.org/pdf/57-6-3.pdf"> <span>nearly always</span></a><span> be</span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/09/technology/09aol.html"> <span>linked back to real people</span></a><span>—including where they live, what they read, and what they buy.</span></p>
<p><span>For data brokers dealing in our personal information, our data can either be useful for their profit-making or truly anonymous, but not both. EFF has </span><a href="https://www.eff.org/press/releases/eff-sues-att-data-aggregators-giving-bounty-hunters-and-other-third-parties-access"><span>long</span></a> <a href="https://www.eff.org/document/amicus-brief-carpenter"><span>opposed</span></a><span> location surveillance programs that can turn our lives into </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/12/10/business/location-data-privacy-apps.html"><span>open books</span></a><span> for scrutiny by police, surveillance-based advertisers, identity thieves, and stalkers. We’ve also long blown the whistle on </span><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2009/09/what-information-personally-identifiable"><span>phony anonymization</span></a><span>.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>As a matter of public policy, it is critical that user privacy is not sacrificed in favor of filling the pockets of corporations. And for any data sharing plan, consent is critical: did each person consent to the method of data collection, and did they consent to the particular use? Consent must be specific, informed, opt-in, and voluntary.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>Disclaimer</em>: this post is an extended transcript of the video below.</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>If you’ve been around long enough, you probably remember a project called Glimpse. Originally it was an attempt to create a fork of GIMP for the name change. Then that project got an offspring, Glimpse NX, where a new image editor with a cleaner, more approachable user interface was supposed to be developed.</p>
<p>Neither project was successful, but this is one of the mockups they came up with:</p>
<p>
    <img src="https://librearts.org/2023/11/radical-redesign-of-gimp/sw-glimpse-nx-mockup.webp" alt="Glimpse NX mockup" loading="lazy">
</p>


<p>I vividly remember that when I first saw this, I thought: “Looks interesting, but there is just no way this is going to work!”. And the main reason for that is…</p>
<h2 id="gimps-complexity">
    <a href="#gimps-complexity">
	GIMP’s complexity
    </a>
</h2>
<p>There is a huge amount of commands and options built into GIMP’s menus and nested menus.</p>
<p>
    <img src="https://librearts.org/2023/11/radical-redesign-of-gimp/sw-gimp-nested-menu.webp" alt="Nested menu in GIMP" loading="lazy">
</p>


<p>The program amassed all that over the years, and then the team tried to solve that with a search dialog:</p>
<p>
    <img src="https://librearts.org/2023/11/radical-redesign-of-gimp/sw-gimp-search-box.webp" alt="Search dialog in GIMP" loading="lazy">
</p>


<p>Which kinda works when you <em>generally</em> know what you need or how a feature you want could be called. But really not when this is your first rodeo.</p>
<p>Anyway, it is very difficult to represent all this complexity in an application that looks like the thing on the mockup above.</p>
<p>With GTK3 tech, one possible solution to do that is a dropdown menu in the headerbar, like in Siril:</p>
<p>
    <img src="https://librearts.org/2023/11/radical-redesign-of-gimp/sw-siril-dropdown-menu-in-headerbar.webp" alt="Dropdown menu in Siril&amp;rsquo;s headerbar" loading="lazy">
</p>


<p>But this is not very convenient because when you go to a nested menu in one part of the screen, it opens in an entirely different part of the screen, and it’s very annoying.</p>
<p>And then again, how many menus like that can you fit into one headerbar before users run for pitchforks with a determined look on their faces? So it’s not really great, I think we could do better.</p>
<h2 id="enter-dune-3d">
    <a href="#enter-dune-3d">
	Enter Dune 3D
    </a>
</h2>
<p>One possible solution is coming from a new application called <a href="https://github.com/dune3d/dune3d" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dune 3D</a>. It’s a 3D CAD program built on top of <a href="https://github.com/Open-Cascade-SAS/OCCT" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Open CASCADE</a> kernel and <a href="https://github.com/solvespace/solvespace" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SolveSpace</a> constraint solver — all the usual suspects.</p>
<p>
    <img src="https://librearts.org/2023/11/radical-redesign-of-gimp/sw-dune3d-main-window.webp" alt="Dune 3D" loading="lazy">
</p>


<p>The developer is <a href="https://chaos.social/@karotte" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the same guy</a> who came up with <a href="https://github.com/horizon-eda/horizon" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Horizon EDA</a>, a GTK3-based electronic design automation package. Dune 3D is very, very new. The initial code import to GitHub was made just two weeks ago, so not a lot of people even know about this project yet, but that is beside the point.</p>
<p>The interesting part here is when you first look at this, you can’t help yourself wondering: “Okay, I get it, he barely started coding. Still, where is all the functionality?”. Well, since the status bar says “Press Space”, let’s do just that:</p>
<p>
    <img src="https://librearts.org/2023/11/radical-redesign-of-gimp/sw-dune3d-menu-search.webp" alt="Search + menu" loading="lazy">
</p>


<p>And that gets me really excited. Because you get the search bar for when you know what you’re looking for, when you know the terminology, when you understand what you need. And you also get a kind of menu that is helpful for when you need to navigate into the unknown and see all your options. So this is a very interesting solution that, while not perfect for a lot of complexity, could still be iterated upon, in my opinion.</p>
<p><em>Update</em>: as the developer <a href="https://chaos.social/@karotte/111376994265393111" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pointed out</a>, this search/menu dialog has been available in Horizon EDA for the past 7 years, he simply reused his own code in the new program.</p>
<h2 id="interaction-hints">
    <a href="#interaction-hints">
	Interaction hints
    </a>
</h2>
<p>Another interesting thing here is that when you do something like drawing a line, for example, you get these nice visual hints here, just above the status bar:</p>
<p>
    <img src="https://librearts.org/2023/11/radical-redesign-of-gimp/sw-dune3d-interaction-hints.webp" alt="Interaction hints" loading="lazy">
</p>


<p>The idea is coming from Blender obviously, and it would make a lot of sense to use this in applications like GIMP and Inkscape. Here is a good reason why.</p>
<p>When you are coming from an application like Photoshop, you are used to do set of modifiers for working with selections. So when you create the selection and you need to add to it, what you do is press <strong>Shift</strong> in GIMP. But it’s <strong>Ctrl</strong> in Photoshop. A lot of people that I’ve met who come from Photoshop don’t really know that. And the only way they can find that out is by reading a tutorial or a user manual or maybe watching a YouTube video — the status bar hint isn’t specific enough, and not everyone finds the toggles in tool settings.</p>
<p>
    <img src="https://librearts.org/2023/11/radical-redesign-of-gimp/sw-gimp-inspecific-toolbar-hint.webp" alt="Inspecific toolbar hint" loading="lazy">
</p>


<p>And the same applies, for example, to moving selections, because in GIMP, you need to press <strong>Ctrl+Alt</strong> and then drag to move the contents of the selection, which is not how people expect this to work coming from many other applications. Again, the only way they can find this out is by watching a tutorial or reading the user manual.</p>
<p>So that’s another thing that I think would make sense to sort of backport from Dune 3D to GIMP in the GTK3-based based version (or GTK4, since Dune 3D is GTK4-based). So I’m really hoping that at least this will be considered by the developers.</p>
<h2 id="thoughts">
    <a href="#thoughts">
	Thoughts?
    </a>
</h2>
<p>I don’t think that the redesign that the Glimpse NX team came up with should be implemented as is. There are so many more aspects to discuss apart from access to functionality in menus, and the team explored some of those aspects too: how the headerbar should work, how exporting would be implemented, what tool settings would look like etc. (they removed the git repository with mockups and studies, but I have a local copy).</p>
<p>Their redesign definitely makes the program more approachable. And now this solution in Dune 3D <em>probably</em> makes a major deficiency of that design go away. Even more, the interaction hints seem like a great if overlooked idea that could also be a <em>relatively</em> low-effort job.</p>
<p>Trying to revamp GIMP’s UX/UI at any level, especially this much, is obviously a huge effort — or <em>would be</em> a huge effort if the developers would ever decide to do that. But I’m really interested in your opinion. Do you think this old redesign of the program could be revived thanks to Dune 3D?</p>

<blockquote><p>In arid and semi-arid regions, owing to high evaporation, transportation routes were in the form of qanats, which led groundwater to consumption areas along the tunnels. In the long run, the qanat system is not only economical but also <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainability" title="Sustainability">sustainable</a> for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irrigation" title="Irrigation">irrigation</a> and agricultural purposes.… The ground water flow was known to depend on grain size of sediments, and, therefore, the tunnels in qanats are filled in with coarser material than the surrounding hose geological formations. The qanats are constructed mainly along the valleys where <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quaternary" title="Quaternary">Quaternary</a> sediments are deposited.</p><p>— <cite><i>Underground Aqueducts Handbook</i> (2016)</cite></p></blockquote>
<p>Qanats are constructed as a series of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_well" title="Water well">well-like</a> vertical <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaft_mining" title="Shaft mining">shafts</a>, connected by a gently sloping <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tunnel" title="Tunnel">tunnel</a> which carries a water channel. Qanats efficiently deliver large amounts of subterranean water to the surface without need for pumping. The water drains by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity" title="Gravity">gravity</a>, typically from an upland <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aquifer" title="Aquifer">aquifer</a>, with the destination lower than the source. Qanats allow water to be transported over long distances in hot dry climates without much water loss to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaporation" title="Evaporation">evaporation</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-Angelakis_2016_Handbook_20-0"><a href="#cite_note-Angelakis_2016_Handbook-20">[20]</a></sup>
</p><p>It is very common for a qanat to start below the foothills of mountains, where the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_table" title="Water table">water table</a> is closest to the surface. From this source, the qanat tunnel slopes gently downward, slowly converging with the steeper slope of the land surface above, and the water finally flows out above ground where the two levels meet. To connect a populated or agricultural area with an aquifer, qanats must often extend for long distances.<sup id="cite_ref-Kheirabadi_2-1"><a href="#cite_note-Kheirabadi-2">[2]</a></sup>
</p><p>Qanats are sometimes split into an underground distribution network of smaller canals called kariz. Like qanats, these smaller canals are below ground to avoid contamination and evaporation. In some cases water from a qanat is stored in a reservoir, typically with night flow stored for daytime use. An <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ab_anbar" title="Ab anbar">ab anbar</a> is an example of a traditional Persian qanat-fed reservoir for drinking water.
</p><p>The qanat system has the advantage of being resistant to natural disasters such as earthquakes and floods, and to deliberate destruction in war. Furthermore, it is almost insensitive to the levels of precipitation, delivering a flow with only gradual variations from wet to dry years. From a sustainability perspective, qanats are powered only by gravity, and thus have low operation &amp; maintenance costs once built. Qanats transfer freshwater from the mountain plateau to the lower-lying plains with saltier soil. This helps to control <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil_salinity" title="Soil salinity">soil salinity</a> and prevent <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desertification" title="Desertification">desertification</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-Nasiri_et_Mafakheri_21-0"><a href="#cite_note-Nasiri_et_Mafakheri-21">[21]</a></sup>

<p>The qanat should not be confused with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Spring-flow_tunnel&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Spring-flow tunnel (page does not exist)">spring-flow tunnel</a> typical to the mountainous area around <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerusalem" title="Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a>. Although both are excavated tunnels designed to extract water by gravity flow, there are crucial differences. Firstly, the origin of the qanat was a well that was turned into an artificial spring. In contrast, the origin of the spring-flow tunnel was the development of a natural spring to renew or increase flow following a recession of the water table. Secondly, the shafts essential for the construction of qanats are not essential to spring-flow tunnels.

<p>A typical town or city in Iran, and elsewhere where the qanat is used, has more than one qanat. Fields and gardens are located both over the qanats a short distance before they emerge from the ground and below the surface outlet. Water from the qanats defines both the social regions in the city and the layout of the city.<sup id="cite_ref-Kheirabadi_2-2"><a href="#cite_note-Kheirabadi-2">[2]</a></sup>
</p><p>The water is freshest, cleanest, and coolest in the upper reaches and more prosperous people live at the outlet or immediately upstream of the outlet. When the qanat is still below ground, the water is drawn to the surface via <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_well" title="Water well">water wells</a> or animal driven <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persian_well" title="Persian well">Persian wells</a>. Private subterranean reservoirs could supply houses and buildings for domestic use and garden irrigation as well. Further, air flow from the qanat is used to cool an underground summer room (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shabestan" title="Shabestan">shabestan</a>) found in many older houses and buildings.<sup id="cite_ref-Kheirabadi_2-3"><a href="#cite_note-Kheirabadi-2">[2]</a></sup>
</p><p>Downstream of the outlet, the water runs through surface canals called jubs (<i>jūbs</i>) which run downhill, with lateral branches to carry water to the neighborhood, gardens and fields. The streets normally parallel the jubs and their lateral branches. As a result, the cities and towns are oriented consistent with the gradient of the land; this is a practical response to efficient water distribution over varying terrain.<sup id="cite_ref-Kheirabadi_2-4"><a href="#cite_note-Kheirabadi-2">[2]</a></sup>
</p><p>The lower reaches of the canals are less desirable for both residences and agriculture. The water grows progressively more polluted as it passes downstream. In dry years the lower reaches are the most likely to see substantial reductions in flow.<sup id="cite_ref-Kheirabadi_2-5"><a href="#cite_note-Kheirabadi-2">[2]</a></sup>

<p>The critical, initial step in qanat construction is identification of an appropriate water source. The search begins at the point where the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alluvial_fan" title="Alluvial fan">alluvial fan</a> meets the mountains or foothills; water is more abundant in the mountains because of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orographic_lifting" title="Orographic lifting">orographic lifting</a> and excavation in the alluvial fan is relatively easy. The <i>muqannīs</i> follow the track of the main water courses coming from the mountains or foothills to identify evidence of subsurface water such as deep-rooted vegetation or seasonal seeps. A trial well is then dug to determine the location of the water table and determine whether a sufficient flow is available to justify construction. If these prerequisites are met, the route is laid out aboveground.
</p><p>Equipment must be assembled. The equipment is straightforward: containers (usually leather bags), ropes, reels to raise the container to the surface at the shaft head, hatchets and shovels for excavation, lights, spirit levels or plumb bobs and string. Depending upon the soil type, qanat liners (usually fired clay hoops) may also be required.<sup id="cite_ref-Kheirabadi_2-7"><a href="#cite_note-Kheirabadi-2">[2]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Smith_22-0"><a href="#cite_note-Smith-22">[22]</a></sup>
</p><p>Although the construction methods are simple, the construction of a qanat requires a detailed understanding of subterranean geology and a degree of engineering sophistication. The gradient of the qanat must be carefully controlled: too shallow a gradient yields no flow and too steep a gradient will result in excessive erosion, collapsing the qanat. And misreading the soil conditions leads to collapses, which at best require extensive rework and at worst are fatal for the crew.<sup id="cite_ref-Smith_22-1"><a href="#cite_note-Smith-22">[22]</a></sup>

<h3><span id="Excavation">Excavation</span><span><span>[</span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Qanat&amp;action=edit&amp;section=8" title="Edit section: Excavation"><span>edit</span></a><span>]</span></span></h3>
<p>Construction of a qanat is usually performed by a crew of 3–4 <i>muqannīs</i>. For a shallow qanat, one worker typically digs the horizontal shaft, one raises the excavated earth from the shaft and one distributes the excavated earth at the top.<sup id="cite_ref-Smith_22-2"><a href="#cite_note-Smith-22">[22]</a></sup>
</p><p>The crew typically begins from the destination to which the water will be delivered into the soil and works toward the source (the test well). Vertical shafts are excavated along the route, separated at a distance of 20–35&nbsp;m (66–115&nbsp;ft). The separation of the shafts is a balance between the amount of work required to excavate them and the amount of effort required to excavate the space between them, as well as the ultimate maintenance effort. In general, the shallower the qanat, the closer the vertical shafts. If the qanat is long, excavation may begin from both ends at once. Tributary channels are sometimes also constructed to supplement the water flow.<sup id="cite_ref-Kheirabadi_2-8"><a href="#cite_note-Kheirabadi-2">[2]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Smith_22-3"><a href="#cite_note-Smith-22">[22]</a></sup>
</p><p>Most qanats in Iran run less than 5&nbsp;km (3.1&nbsp;mi), while some have been measured at ≈70&nbsp;km (43&nbsp;mi) in length near <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerman" title="Kerman">Kerman</a>. The vertical shafts usually range from 20 to 200&nbsp;m (66 to 656&nbsp;ft) in depth, although qanats in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Province_of_Khorasan" title="Province of Khorasan">province of Khorasan</a> have been recorded with vertical shafts of up to 275&nbsp;m (902&nbsp;ft). The vertical shafts support construction and maintenance of the underground channel as well as air interchange. Deep shafts require intermediate platforms to facilitate the process of removing soil.<sup id="cite_ref-Kheirabadi_2-9"><a href="#cite_note-Kheirabadi-2">[2]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Smith_22-4"><a href="#cite_note-Smith-22">[22]</a></sup>
</p><p>The construction speed depends on the depth and nature of the ground. If the earth is soft and easy to work, at 20&nbsp;m (66&nbsp;ft) depth a crew of four workers can excavate a horizontal length of 40&nbsp;m (130&nbsp;ft) per day. When the vertical shaft reaches 40&nbsp;m (130&nbsp;ft), they can excavate only 20 meters horizontally per day and at 60&nbsp;m (200&nbsp;ft) in depth this drops below 5 horizontal meters per day. In Algeria, a common speed is just 2&nbsp;m (6.6&nbsp;ft) per day at a depth of 15&nbsp;m (49&nbsp;ft). Deep, long qanats (which many are) require years and even decades to construct.<sup id="cite_ref-Kheirabadi_2-10"><a href="#cite_note-Kheirabadi-2">[2]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Smith_22-5"><a href="#cite_note-Smith-22">[22]</a></sup>
</p><p>The excavated material is usually transported by means of leather bags up the vertical shafts. It is mounded around the vertical shaft exit, providing a barrier that prevents windblown or rain driven debris from entering the shafts. These mounds may be covered to provide further protection to the qanat. From the air, these shafts look like a string of bomb craters.<sup id="cite_ref-Smith_22-6"><a href="#cite_note-Smith-22">[22]</a></sup>
</p><p>The qanat's water-carrying channel must have a sufficient downward slope that water flows easily. However the downward gradient must not be so great as to create conditions under which the water transitions between <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supercritical_flow" title="Supercritical flow">supercritical</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subcritical_flow" title="Subcritical flow">subcritical flow</a>; if this occurs, the waves that result can result in severe erosion that can damage or destroy the qanat. The choice of the slope is a trade off between erosion and sedimentation. Highly sloped tunnels are subject to more erosion as water flows at a higher speed. On the other hand, less sloped tunnels need frequent maintenance due to the problem of sedimentation.<sup id="cite_ref-Nasiri_et_Mafakheri_21-1"><a href="#cite_note-Nasiri_et_Mafakheri-21">[21]</a></sup> A lower downward gradient also contributes to reducing the solid contents and contamination in water.<sup id="cite_ref-Nasiri_et_Mafakheri_21-2"><a href="#cite_note-Nasiri_et_Mafakheri-21">[21]</a></sup> In shorter qanats the downward gradient varies between 1:1000 and 1:1500, while in longer qanats it may be almost horizontal. Such precision is routinely obtained with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirit_level" title="Spirit level">spirit level</a> and string.<sup id="cite_ref-Kheirabadi_2-11"><a href="#cite_note-Kheirabadi-2">[2]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Smith_22-7"><a href="#cite_note-Smith-22">[22]</a></sup>
</p><p>In cases where the gradient is steeper, underground waterfalls may be constructed with appropriate design features (usually linings) to absorb the energy with minimal erosion. In some cases the water power has been harnessed to drive underground <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_mill" title="Water mill">mills</a>. If it is not possible to bring the outlet of the qanat out near the settlement, it is necessary to run a <i>jub</i> or canal overground. This is avoided when possible to limit pollution, warming and water loss due to evaporation.<sup id="cite_ref-Kheirabadi_2-12"><a href="#cite_note-Kheirabadi-2">[2]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Smith_22-8"><a href="#cite_note-Smith-22">[22]</a></sup>

<p>The vertical shafts may be covered to minimize blown-in sand. The channels of qanats must be periodically inspected for erosion or cave-ins, cleaned of sand and mud and otherwise repaired. For safety, air flow must be assured before entry.

<p>Qanats used in conjunction with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_tower" title="Wind tower">wind tower</a> can provide cooling as well as a water supply. A wind tower is a chimney-like structure positioned above the house; of its four openings, the one opposite the wind direction is opened to move air out of the house. Incoming air is pulled from a qanat below the house. The air flow across the vertical shaft opening creates a lower pressure (see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernoulli%27s_principle" title="Bernoulli's principle">Bernoulli effect</a>) and draws cool air up from the qanat tunnel, mixing with it. The air from the qanat is drawn into the tunnel at some distance away and is cooled both by contact with the cool tunnel walls/water and by the transfer of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latent_heat" title="Latent heat">latent heat</a> of evaporation as water evaporates into the air stream. In dry desert climates this can result in a greater than 15&nbsp;°C reduction in the air temperature coming from the qanat; the mixed air still feels dry, so the basement is cool and only comfortably moist (not damp). Wind tower and qanat cooling have been used in desert climates for over 1000 years.<sup id="cite_ref-24"><a href="#cite_note-24">[24]</a></sup>

<p>By 400&nbsp;BCE, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persia" title="Persia">Persian</a> engineers had mastered the technique of storing ice in the middle of summer in the desert.<sup id="cite_ref-Rael_25-0"><a href="#cite_note-Rael-25">[25]</a></sup>
</p><p>The ice could be brought in during the winters from nearby mountains, but in a more usual and sophisticated method they built a wall in the east–west direction near the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yakhchal" title="Yakhchal">yakhchal</a> (ice pit). In winter, the qanat water would be channeled to the north side of the wall, whose shade made the water freeze more quickly, increasing the ice formed per winter day. Then the ice was stored in yakhchals—specially designed, naturally cooled refrigerators. A large underground space with thick insulated walls was connected to a qanat, and a system of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windcatcher" title="Windcatcher">windcatchers</a> or wind towers was used to draw cool subterranean air up from the qanat to maintain temperatures inside the space at low levels, even during hot summer days. As a result, the ice melted slowly and was available year-round.<sup id="cite_ref-Rael_25-1"><a href="#cite_note-Rael-25">[25]</a></sup>

<p>Qanats (designated foggaras in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algeria" title="Algeria">Algeria</a>) are the source of water for irrigation in large <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oases" title="Oases">oases</a> like that at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gourara" title="Gourara">Gourara</a>. The foggaras are also found at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touat" title="Touat">Touat</a> (an area of Adrar 200&nbsp;km from Gourara). The length of the foggaras in this region is estimated to be thousands of kilometers.
</p><p>Although sources suggest that the foggaras may have been in use as early as 200&nbsp;CE, they were clearly in use by the 11th century after the Arabs took possession of the oases in the 10th century and the residents embraced Islam.
</p><p>The water is metered to the various users through the use of distribution <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weir" title="Weir">weirs</a> that meter flow to the various canals, each for a separate user.
</p><p>The humidity of the oases is also used to supplement the water supply to the foggara. The temperature gradient in the vertical shafts causes air to rise by natural convection, causing a draft to enter the foggara. The moist air of the agricultural area is drawn into the foggara in the opposite direction to the water run-off. In the foggara it condenses on the tunnel walls and the air passes out of the vertical shafts. This condensed moisture is available for reuse.<sup id="cite_ref-26"><a href="#cite_note-26">[26]</a></sup>

<p>According to Herodotus, qanat irrigation technology was introduced to Egypt by the Achaemenid king <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darius_I" title="Darius I">Darius I</a> during his reign of 522 BCE-486 BCE, which is supported by the historian <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_T._Olmstead" title="Albert T. Olmstead">Albert T. Olmstead</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-27"><a href="#cite_note-27">[27]</a></sup>
</p><p>There are four main oases in the Egyptian desert. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kharga_Oasis" title="Kharga Oasis">Kharga Oasis</a> is one that has been extensively studied. There is evidence that as early as the second half of the 5th century BCE water brought in qanats was being used. The qanats were excavated through water-bearing sandstone rock, which seeps into the channel, with water collected in a basin behind a small dam at the end. The width is approximately 60&nbsp;cm (24&nbsp;in), but the height ranges from 5 to 9 meters; it is likely that the qanat was deepened to enhance seepage when the water table dropped (as is also seen in Iran). From there the water was used to irrigate fields.<sup id="cite_ref-Smith_22-9"><a href="#cite_note-Smith-22">[22]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Wuttman_28-0"><a href="#cite_note-Wuttman-28">[28]</a></sup>
</p><p>There is another instructive structure located at the Kharga oasis. A well that apparently dried up was improved by driving a side shaft through the easily penetrated sandstone (presumably in the direction of greatest water seepage) into the hill of Ayn-Manâwîr to allow collection of additional water. After this side shaft had been extended, another vertical shaft was driven to intersect the side shaft. Side chambers were built, and holes bored into the rock—presumably at points where water seeped from the rocks—are evident.<sup id="cite_ref-Wuttman_28-1"><a href="#cite_note-Wuttman-28">[28]</a></sup>

<p>The territory of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azerbaijan" title="Azerbaijan">Azerbaijan</a> was home to numerous kahrizes many centuries ago. Archaeological findings suggest that long before the ninth century CE, kahrizes by which the inhabitants brought potable and irrigation water to their settlements were in use in Azerbaijan. Traditionally, kahrizes were built and maintained by a group of masons called 'Kankans' with manual labour. The profession was handed down from father to son.

<p>According to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Callisthenes" title="Callisthenes">Callisthenes</a>, the Persians were using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_clock" title="Water clock">water clocks</a> in 328&nbsp;BCE to ensure a just and exact distribution of water from qanats to their shareholders for agricultural irrigation. The use of water clocks in Iran, especially in Qanats of Gonabad and kariz <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zibad" title="Zibad">Zibad</a>, dates back to 500&nbsp;BCE. Later they were also used to determine the exact holy days of pre-Islamic religions, such as the <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nowruz" title="Nowruz">Nowruz</a></i>, <i>Chelah</i>, or <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yald%C4%81" title="Yaldā">Yaldā</a></i> – the shortest, longest, and equal-length days and nights of the years.<sup id="cite_ref-Qanat_42-0"><a href="#cite_note-Qanat-42">[42]</a></sup>
The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_clock" title="Water clock">Water clock</a>, or <i>Fenjaan</i>, was the most accurate and commonly used timekeeping device for calculating the amount or the time that a farmer must take water from the Qanats of Gonabad until it was replaced by more accurate current clocks.<sup id="cite_ref-amordadnews.com_43-0"><a href="#cite_note-amordadnews.com-43">[43]</a></sup> Many of the Iranian qanats bear some characteristics which allow us to call them feat of engineering, considering the intricate techniques used in their construction. The eastern and central regions of Iran hold the most qanats due to low precipitation and lack of permanent surface streams, whereas a small number of qanats can be found in the northern and western parts which receive more rainfall and enjoy some permanent rivers. Respectively the provinces Khorasan Razavi, Southern Khorasan, Isfahan and Yazd accommodate the most qanats, but from the viewpoint of water discharge the provinces Isfahan, Khorasan Razavi, Fars and Kerman are ranked first to fourth.
</p><p>Henri Golbot explored the genesis of the qanat in his 1979 publication, <span title="French-language text"><i lang="fr">Les Qanats. Une technique d'acquisition de l'eau</i></span> (The Qanats. a Technique for Obtaining Water),<sup id="cite_ref-Golbot_1979_44-0"><a href="#cite_note-Golbot_1979-44">[44]</a></sup> He argues that the ancient Iranians made use of the water that the miners wished to get rid of it, and founded a basic system named qanat or Kariz to supply the required water to their farm lands. According to Goblot, this innovation took place in the northwest of the present Iran somewhere bordering Turkey and later was introduced to the neighboring Zagros Mountains.
</p><p>According to an inscription left by Sargon II, the king of Assyria, In 714&nbsp;BCE he invaded the city of Uhlu lying in the northwest of Uroomiye lake that lay in the territory of Urartu empire, and then he noticed that the occupied area enjoyed a very rich vegetation even though there was no river running across it. So he managed to discover the reason why the area could stay green, and realized that there were some qanats behind the matter. In fact it was Ursa, the king of the region, who had rescued the people from thirst and turned Uhlu into a prosperous and green land. Goblot believes that the influence of the Medeans and Achaemenids made the technology of qanat spread from Urartu (in the western north of Iran and near the present border between Iran and Turkey) to all over the Iranian plateau.
It was an Achaemenid ruling that in case someone succeeded in constructing a qanat and bringing groundwater to the surface in order to cultivate land, or in renovating an abandoned qanat, the tax he was supposed to pay the government would be waived not only for him but also for his successors for up to 5 generations. During this period, the technology of qanat was in its heyday and it even spread to other countries. For example, following Darius's order, Silaks the naval commander of the Persian army and Khenombiz the royal architect managed to construct a qanat in the oasis of Kharagha in Egypt. Beadnell believes that qanat construction dates back to two distinct periods: they were first constructed by the Persianse, and later the Romans dug some other qanats during their reign in Egypt from 30&nbsp;BCE to 395&nbsp;CE. The magnificent temple built in this area during Darius's reign shows that there was a considerable population depending on the water of qanats. Ragerz has estimated this population to be 10,000 people. The most reliable document confirming the existence of qanats at this time was written by Polybius who states that: "the streams are running down from everywhere at the base of Alborz mountain, and people have transferred too much water from a long distance through some subterranean canals by spending much cost and labor."
</p><p>During the Seleucid Era, which began after the occupation of Iran by Alexander, it seems that the qanats were abandoned.
</p><p>In terms of the situation of qanats during this era, some historical records have been found. In a study by Russian orientalist scholars it has been mentioned that: the Persians used the side branches of rivers, mountain springs, wells and qanats to supply water. The subterranean galleries excavated to obtain groundwater were named as qanat. These galleries were linked to the surface through some vertical shafts which were sunk in order to get access to the gallery to repair it if necessary.
</p><p>According to the historical records, the Parthian kings did not care about the qanats the way the Achaemenid kings and even Sassanid kings did. As an instance, Arsac III, one of the Parthian kings, destroyed some qanats in order to make it difficult for Seleucid Antiochus to advance further while fighting him. The historical records from this time indicate a perfect regulation on both water distribution and farmlands. All the water rights were recorded in a special document which was referred to in case of any transaction. The lists of farmlands – whether private or governmental – were kept at the tax department. During this period there were some official rulings on qanats, streams, construction of dam, operation and maintenance of qanats, etc. The government proceeded to repair or dredge the qanats that were abandoned or destroyed for any reason, and construct the new qanats if necessary. A document written in the Pahlavi language pointed out the important role of qanats in developing the cities at that time. In Iran, the advent of Islam, which coincided with the overthrow of the Sassanid dynasty, brought about a profound change in religious, political, social and cultural structures. But the qanats stayed intact, because the economic infrastructure, including qanats was of great importance to the Arabs. As an instance, M. Lombard reports that the Moslem clerics who lived during Abbasid period, such as Abooyoosef Ya’qoob (died 798&nbsp;CE) stipulated that whoever can bring water to the idle lands in order to cultivate, his tax would be waived and he would be entitled to the lands cultivated. Therefore, this policy did not differ from that of the Achaemenids in not getting any tax from the people who revived abandoned lands. The Arabs' supportive policy on qanats was so successful that even the holy city of Mecca gained a qanat too. The Persian historian Hamdollah Mostowfi writes: "Zobeyde Khatoon (Haroon al-Rashid's wife) constructed a qanat in Mecca. After the time of Haroon al-Rashid, during the caliph Moghtader's reign this qanat fell into decay, but he rehabilitated it, and the qanat was rehabilitated again after it collapsed during the reign of two other caliphs named Ghaem and Naser. After the era of the caliphs this qanat completely fell into ruin because the desert sand filled it up, but later Amir Choopan repaired the qanat and made it flow again in Mecca."<sup>[<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources. (December 2018)">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup>
</p><p>There are also other historical texts proving that the Abbasids were concerned about qanats. For example, according to the "Incidents of Abdollah bin Tahir's Time" written by Gardizi, in 830&nbsp;CE a terrible earthquake struck the town of Forghaneh and reduced many homes to rubble. The inhabitants of Neyshaboor used to come to Abdollah bin Tahir in order to request him to intervene, for they fought over their qanats and found the relevant instruction or law on qanat as a solution neither in the prophet's quotations nor in the clerics' writings. So Abdollah bin Tahir managed to bring together all the clergymen from throughout Khorasan and Iraq to compile a book entitled <i>Alghani</i> (The Book of Qanat). This book collected all the rulings on qanats which could be of use to whoever wanted to judge a dispute over this issue. Gardizi added that this book was still applicable to his time, and everyone made references to this book.
</p><p>One can deduce from these facts that during the above-mentioned period the number of qanats was so considerable that the authorities were prompted to put together some legal instructions concerning them. Also it shows that from the ninth to eleventh centuries the qanats that were the hub of the agricultural systems were also of interest to the government. Apart from The Book of Alghani, which is considered as a law booklet focusing on qanat-related rulings based on Islamic principles, there is another book about groundwater written by Karaji in 1010. This book, entitled <i>Extraction of Hidden Waters</i>, examines just the technical issues associated with the qanat and tries to answer the common questions such as how to construct and repair a qanat, how to find a groundwater supply, how to do leveling, etc.. Some of the innovations described in this book were introduced for the first time in the history of hydrogeology, and some of its technical methods are still valid and can be applied in qanat construction. The content of this book implies that its writer (Karaji) did not have any idea that there was another book on qanats compiled by the clergymen.
</p><p>There are some records dating back to that time, signifying their concern about the legal vicinity of qanats. For example, Mohammad bin Hasan quotes Aboo-Hanifeh that in case someone constructs a qanat in abandoned land, someone else can dig another qanat in the same land on the condition that the second qanat is 500 zera’ (375 meters) away from the first one.
</p><p>Ms. Lambton quotes Moeen al-din Esfarzi who wrote the book <i>Rowzat al-Jannat</i> (the garden of paradise) that Abdollah bin Tahir (from the Taherian dynasty) and Ismaeel Ahmed Samani (from the Samani dynasty) had several qanats constructed in Neyshaboor. Later, in the 11th century, a writer named Nasir Khosrow acknowledged all those qanats with the following words: "Neyshaboor is located in a vast plain at a distance of 40 Farsang (≈240 km) from Serakhs and 70 Farsang (≈420 km) from Mary (Marv) ... all the qanats of this city run underground, and it is said that an Arab who was offended by the people of Neyshaboor has complained that; what a beautiful city Neyshaboor could have become if its qanats would have flowed on the ground surface and instead its people would have been underground." These documents all certify the importance of qanats during the Islamic history within the cultural territories of Iran.

<p>In the 13th century, the invasion of Iran by Mongolian tribes reduced many qanats and irrigation systems to ruin, and many qanats were deserted and dried up. Later, in the era of the Ilkhanid dynasty especially at the time of Ghazan Khan and his Persian minister Rashid al-Din Fazl-Allah, some measures were taken to revive the qanats and irrigation systems. There is a 14th-century book entitled <i>Al-Vaghfiya Al-Rashidiya</i> (Rashid's Deeds of Endowment) that names all the properties located in Yazd, Shiraz, Maraghe, Tabriz, Isfahan and Mowsel that Rashid Fazl-Allah donated to the public or religious places. This book mentions many qanats running at that time and irrigating a considerable area of farmland. At the same time, another book, entitled <i>Jame’ al-Kheyrat</i>, was written by Seyyed Rokn al-Din on the same subject as Rashid's book. In this book, Seyyed Rokn al-Din names the properties he donated in the region of Yazd. These deeds of endowment indicate that much attention was given to the qanats during the reign of Ilkhanids, but it is attributable to their Persian ministers, who influenced them.<sup id="cite_ref-Qanat_42-1"><a href="#cite_note-Qanat-42">[42]</a></sup>
</p><p>In the years 1984–1985 the ministry of energy took a census of 28,038 qanats whose total discharge was 9 billion cubic meters. In the years 1992–1993 the census of 28,054 qanats showed a total discharge of 10 billion cubic meters. 10 years later in 2002–2003 the number of the qanats was reported as 33,691 with a total discharge of 8 billion cubic meters.
</p><p>In the restricted regions there are 317,225 wells, qanats and springs that discharge 36,719 million cubic meters water a year, out of which 3,409 million cubic meters is surplus to the aquifer capacity. in 2005, in the country as a whole, there were 130,008 deep wells with a discharge of 31,403 million cubic meter, 33,8041 semi deep wells with a discharge of 13,491 million cubic meters, 34,355 qanats with a discharge of 8,212 million cubic meters, and 55,912 natural springs with a discharge of 21,240 million cubic meters.<sup id="cite_ref-45"><a href="#cite_note-45">[45]</a></sup>

Reasons for the decline of qanats include "abandonment and neglect" prior to 2004, "excessive pumping from wells" and, since 2005, drought. Water shortages are said to have forced,  since 2005, over 100,000 people who depended for their livelihoods on karez systems to leave their homes.<sup id="cite_ref-The_Hindu_46-0"><a href="#cite_note-The_Hindu-46">[46]</a></sup> The study says that a single karez has the potential to provide enough household water for nearly 9,000 individuals and irrigate over 200 hectares of farmland.

<p>In India, there are karez (qanat) systems are located at Bidar, Bijapur, Burhanpur "(Kundi Bhandara)" and Aurgangabad. The Bidar karez systems were probably the first one to have ever been dug in India. It dates to the Bahmani period. Bidar has three karez systems as per Gulam Yazdani's documentation.<sup id="cite_ref-48"><a href="#cite_note-48">[48]</a></sup> Other than Naubad there are two more karez systems in Bidar, "Shukla Theerth" and "Jamna Mori". The Shukla theerth is the longest karez system in Bidar. The mother well of this karez has been discovered by near Gornalli Kere, a historic embankment. The third system called Jamna mori is more of a distribution system within the old city area with many channels crisscrossing the city lanes.<sup id="cite_ref-49"><a href="#cite_note-49">[49]</a></sup> Restoration efforts commenced in 2014, with the desilting and excavation of the Naubad Karez in 2015, uncovering 27 vertical shafts linked to the Karez. The rejuvenation of the system has had a significant impact on the water-deficit city of Bidar. A seventh line of the system was discovered in 2016 during a sewage line excavation.<sup id="cite_ref-The_Hindu_46-1"><a href="#cite_note-The_Hindu-46">[46]</a></sup>
</p><p>Valliyil Govindankutty, Assistant Professor in Geography at Government College Chittur, was responsible for rediscovery and mapping of the Naubad Karez System in 2012-2013. Later in 2014-2016 team YUVAA joined Govindankutty to help uncover Other two Karez Systems in Bidar.<sup id="cite_ref-50"><a href="#cite_note-50">[50]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-51"><a href="#cite_note-51">[51]</a></sup> Detailed documentation of the Naubad karez system was done in August 2013 and a report was submitted to District Administration of Bidar that found several new facts. The research has led to the initiation of cleaning the debris and collapsed sections paving the way to its rejuvenation. The cleaning of karez has led to bringing water to higher areas of the plateau, and it has in turn recharged the wells in the vicinity.
</p><p>The Bijapur karez system is much more complicated. A reveals that it has surface water and groundwater connections. The Bijapur karez is a network of shallow masonry aqueducts, terracotta/ceramic pipes, embankments and reservoirs, tanks etc. All weave together a network to ensure water reaches the old city. The system starts at Torwi and extends as shallow aqueducts and further as pipes; further it becomes deeper from the Sainik school area onward which exists as a tunnel dug through the geology. The system can be clearly traced up to Ibrahim Roja.
</p><p>In Aurangabad the karez systems are called nahars. These are shallow aqueducts running through the city. There are 14 aqueducts in Aurangabad. The Nahar-i-Ambari is the oldest and longest. Its again a combination of shallow aqueducts, open channels, pipes, cisterns, etc. The source of water is a surface water body. The karez has been constructed right below the bed of lake. The lake water seeps through the soil into the Karez Gallery.
</p><p>In Burhanpur the karez is called "Kundi-Bhandara", sometimes wrongly referred to as"Khuni Bhandara". The system is approx 6&nbsp;km long starts from the alluvial fans of Satpura hills in the north of the town. Unlike Bidar, Bijapur and Aurgangabad the System airvents are round in shape. Inside the Karez one could see lime depositions on the walls. The Systems ends to carry water further to palaces and public fountains through pipe line.

<p>In Pakistan qanat irrigation system is endemic only in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balochistan_(Pakistan)" title="Balochistan (Pakistan)">Balochistan</a>. The major concentration is in the north and northwest along the Pakistan-Afghanistan border and oasis of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Makoran_division&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Makoran division (page does not exist)">Makoran division</a>. The Karez system of the Balochistan desert is on the Tentative List for future World Heritage Sites in Pakistan.<sup id="cite_ref-56"><a href="#cite_note-56">[56]</a></sup>
</p><p>The acute shortage of water resources give water a decisive role in the regional conflicts arose in the course of history of Balochistan. Therefore, in Balochistan, the possession of water resources is more important than ownership of land itself. Hence afterward a complex system for the collection, channeling and distribution of water was developed in Balochistan. Similarly, the distribution and unbiased flow of water to different stockholders also necessitate the importance of different societal classes in Balochistan in general and particularly in Makoran. For instance, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sarrishta&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Sarrishta (page does not exist)">sarrishta</a> (literally, head of the chain) is responsible for administration of channel. He normally owns the largest water quota. Under sarrishta, there are several heads of owners <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Issadar&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Issadar (page does not exist)">issadar</a> who also possessed larger water quotas. The social hierarchy within Baloch society of Makoran depends upon the possession of largest quotas of water. The role of sarrishta in some cases hierarchical and passing from generations within the family and he must have the knowledge of the criteria of unbiased distribution of water among different issadar.
</p><p>The sharing of water is based on a complex indigenous system of measurement depends upon time and space particularly to the phases of moon; the hangams. Based on seasonal variations and share of water the hangams are apportioned among various owners over period of seven or fourteen days. However, in some places, instead of hangam, anna used which is based on twelve-hour period for each quota. Therefore, if a person own 16 quotas it means that he is entitled for water for eight days in high seasons and 16 days in winter when water level went down as well as expectation of winter rain (Baharga) in Makran region. The twelve-hour water quota again subdivided into several sub-fractions of local measuring scales such as tas or pad (Dr Gul Hasan Pro VC LUAWMS, 2 day National conference on Kech).

<p>In Oman from the Iron Age period (found in Salut, Bat and other sites) a system of underground aqueducts called '<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aflaj_Irrigation_Systems_of_Oman" title="Aflaj Irrigation Systems of Oman">Falaj</a>' were constructed, a series of well-like vertical shafts, connected by gently sloping horizontal tunnels. There are three types of Falaj: Daudi (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic_language" title="Arabic language">Arabic</a>: <span lang="ar" dir="rtl">داوودية</span>) with underground aqueducts, Ghaili (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic_language" title="Arabic language">Arabic</a>: <span lang="ar" dir="rtl">الغيلية</span>) requiring a dam to collect the water, and Aini (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic_language" title="Arabic language">Arabic</a>: <span lang="ar" dir="rtl">العينية</span>) whose source is a water spring. These enabled large scale agriculture to flourish in a dryland environment.

            <span>Abstract:</span>The structure of the Lorentz transformations follows purely from the absence of privileged inertial reference frames and the group structure (closure under composition) of the transformations---two assumptions that are simple and physically necessary. The existence of an invariant speed is \textit{not} a necessary assumption, and in fact is a consequence of the principle of relativity (though the finite value of this speed must, of course, be obtained from experiment). Von Ignatowsky derived this result in 1911, but it is still not widely known and is absent from most textbooks. Here we present a completely elementary proof of the result, suitable for use in an introductory course in special relativity.

         }"><p data-block-key="9zs61">Do you know that song that goes, “da daaaa da da daaaa na naa naa ooohh yeah”? Or the one that starts with the guitar chords going, “da na na naa”? We all know how frustrating it is when you can’t remember the name of a song or any of the words but the tune is stuck in your head. Today at <a href="https://www.blog.google/products/search/search-on/">Search On</a>, we announced that Google can now help you figure it out—no lyrics, artist name or perfect pitch required.&nbsp;</p><h3 data-block-key="9u86d">Hum to search for your earworm</h3><p data-block-key="0lzz8">Starting today, you can hum, whistle or sing a melody to Google to solve your earworm.&nbsp;On your mobile device, open the latest version of the Google app or find your <a href="https://blog.google/products/google-on-ios/easier-access-search-chrome-and-gmail-ios-14/">Google Search widget</a>, tap the mic icon and say “what's this song?” or click the “Search a song” button.&nbsp;Then start humming for 10-15 seconds. On Google Assistant, it’s just as simple. Say “Hey Google, what’s this song?” and then hum the tune. This feature is currently available in English on iOS, and in more than 20 languages on Android. And we hope to expand this to more languages in the future.</p><p data-block-key="pyk6x">After you’re finished humming, our machine learning algorithm helps identify potential song matches. And don’t worry, you don’t need perfect pitch to use this feature. We’ll show you the most likely options based on the tune. Then you can select the best match and explore information on the song and artist, view any accompanying music videos or listen to the song on your favorite music app, find the lyrics, read analysis and even check out other recordings of the song when available.&nbsp;</p></div>

         }"><h3 data-block-key="65say">How machines learn melodies&nbsp;</h3><p data-block-key="cbbta">So how does it work? An easy way to explain it is that a song’s melody is like its fingerprint: They each have their own unique identity. We've built machine learning models that can match your hum, whistle or singing to the right “fingerprint.”</p><p data-block-key="s197q">When you hum a melody into Search, our machine learning models transform the audio into a number-based sequence representing the song’s melody. Our models are trained to identify songs based on a variety of sources, including humans singing, whistling or humming, as well as studio recordings. The algorithms also take away all the other details, like accompanying instruments and the voice's timbre and tone. What we’re left with is the song’s number-based sequence, or the fingerprint.</p><p data-block-key="rn6n4">We compare these sequences to thousands of songs from around the world and identify potential&nbsp; matches in real time. For example, if you listen to Tones and I’s “Dance Monkey,” you’ll recognize the song whether it was sung, whistled, or hummed. Similarly, our machine learning models recognize the melody of the studio-recorded version of the song, which we can use to match it with a person’s hummed audio.&nbsp;</p><p data-block-key="9qwp7">This builds on the work of our Research team’s <a href="https://ai.googleblog.com/2018/09/googles-next-generation-music.html">music recognition technology</a>. We launched Now Playing on the Pixel 2 in 2017, using deep neural networks to bring low-power recognition of music to mobile devices. In 2018, we brought the same technology to the SoundSearch feature in the Google app and expanded the reach to a catalog of millions of songs. This new experience takes it a step further, because now we can recognize songs without the lyrics or original song. All we need is a hum.</p></div>

<h2>Why I made this site</h2>

<p>
When our Japanese-Finnish son was born, we wanted to find a name that would work in both languages. To help with the search I wrote a simple tool for personal use to look through
all the names in both Japanese and Finnish, finding ones which appear in both.
</p>
<p>Thinking others might find it useful as well, years later I went back and improved it to
the point that I could release it online, which is the page you are now on.</p>
<p>This tool currently supports 58 different languages or cultures. For example if you are German and your wife is Klingon, <a href="https://mixedname.com/german_klingon_masculine_names">it can tell you</a> that the only name option is "Arne". In other words, it finds the intersection of two name lists.
Some languages don't have many options, so it also tries a fuzzy search and some other strategies as well.</p>
<p>Since all of these are found by software, there are no guarantees that the names are any good (for instance it sometimes suggests "Timo" for an Italian name, which wouldn't be great), so it is intended to only give you ideas to consider.</p>
<p>Hope you like it. Oh, and here are the <a href="https://mixedname.com/finnish_japanese_masculine_names">Japanese-Finnish names</a> it found for us. We ended up going with a completely unique one that wasn't in the list, but just having a list to work with was a nice start for our name brainstorming session!</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p>The LockBit crew is claiming to have leaked all of the data it stole from Boeing late last month, after the passenger jet giant apparently refused to pay the ransom demand.</p>
<p>The gang <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://twitter.com/malwrhunterteam/status/1722914117994885515">dumped</a> the files online early Friday morning. This latest leak includes about 50GB of data in the form of compressed archives and backup files for various systems.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The full release comes after the extortionists uploaded some files said to be related to company finances and marketing activities as well as supplier details.</p>

    

<p>Screenshots of the stolen info showed several <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://twitter.com/malwrhunterteam/status/1722957984295223524">Citrix logs</a>, which has led to some <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://twitter.com/malwrhunterteam/status/1722957984295223524">speculation</a> that LockBit exploited <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/10/31/mass_exploitation_citrix_bleed/">Citrix Bleed</a> to break into the defense contractor's systems. Boeing has so far refused to comment on the initial point of entry into its systems.</p>

        


        

<p>Neither data dump has been verified by <em>The Register</em>, and Boeing declined to answer specific questions about the incident or the stolen files. A spokesperson sent us this comment via email:</p>

<p>According to security researcher Dominic Alvieri, the files also contained corporate emails.</p>
<p>"I haven't gone over the whole data set but Boeing emails and a few others stand out as useful for those with malicious intent," Alvieri told <em>The Register</em>.</p>
<ul>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/11/02/boeing_cyber_incident/">Boeing acknowledges cyberattack on parts and distribution biz</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/10/31/mass_exploitation_citrix_bleed/">'Mass exploitation' of Citrix Bleed underway as ransomware crews pile in</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/11/10/icbc_ransomware/">China's top bank ICBC hit by ransomware, derailing global trades</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/11/10/ransomedvc_shut_down/">Strangely enough, no one wants to buy a ransomware group that has cops' attention</a></li>
</ul>
<p>LockBit first <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/10/30/security_in_brief/">listed</a> the aircraft giant on its dark-web site on October 28, and on November 2 Boeing <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/11/02/boeing_cyber_incident/">confirmed</a> to <em>The Register</em> it had suffered an IT intrusion. At the time, a spokesperson said the break-in affected the manufacturer's parts and distribution business.&nbsp;</p>
<p>By then, however, the ransomware crew had removed Boeing from its leaks site and told the malware librarians at VX Underground that it was negotiating with the US corporation. It appears that the negotiations failed — or possibly the multinational determined that the criminals hadn't accessed any sensitive info, and thus it wouldn't pay to pay the extortion demand, or no talks ever actually took place — and Boeing is now back on the LockBit extortion website&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also this week, China's largest bank, ICBC, was <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/11/10/icbc_ransomware/">hit by a ransomware attack</a> that disrupted financial services systems on Thursday Beijing time. LockBit <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://twitter.com/vxunderground/status/1722982061298913622">told VX-Underground</a> that it was was responsible for this break-in, too. ®</p>
