<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="a1935d0447e10099871f84ce814e14d1" data-plugin="TextArea"><p>My stepdaughter is a senior Product Manager and my stepson is a Chartered Engineer and he frequently works as a Project Manager. They would know how to manage this project. Luckily they are too successful and busy to ever read this, thank goodness!</p>



<p>I tried doing the project management on a PC but gave up, and instead used 3 coloured pens, A4 paper and self adhesive address labels to cover up my mistakes. I simply found it easier. The only problem I discovered is that the paper gets a bit thick after several layers of amendments, but the big advantage is that can always find your latest version, it's simply the thickest.</p>



<p>The main thing I discovered was that the first time I tried almost anything I failed, but the annoying experience often enabled future success.</p>



<p>I first started by stabbing at various bits of the idea. Eventually I was able to define what I wanted to do. I now realise that this definition, was the most important part of the whole project management!</p>



<p>The program seemed to consist of many complex components, all of which I needed to understand, to be able to build The Tube Computer.</p>



<p>How do thermionic vacuum tubes work, how do you design a PCB, and how on earth do you get from a NOR gate, to a memory register, via microcodes from a clock, binary counters, and a ROM, to actually run software. And what exactly is a microcode anyway. At times, in fact most of the time, it all just seemed impossible.</p>



<p>The main solutions I found were, firstly to keep the number of unique sub systems to an absolute minimum. Secondly to use double triode tubes to halve the physical size, which also reduced the construction time. And thirdly, to design multi layer printed circuit boards to reduce the inevitable build errors and produce a robust construction.</p>



<p>The Tube Computer has behaved itself so far, unlike a previous system that went BANG twice. The first time I pulled out plugs like my life depended on it, and Judy cried, “Everything all right!”. The second time I only slightly panicked, and Judy continued to decorate the Christmas tree, but later bought me a surprise present, a fire extinguisher!</p>



<p>But most important of all, is to have a lovely wife, who knows you're daft as a brush, and that life together is brilliant.</p>



<p>Best wishes, Mike and Judy.</p>

           <p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/polly/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="https://a0.awsstatic.com/aws-blog/images/Voiced_by_Amazon_Polly_EN.png" alt="Voiced by Polly" width="554" height="56"></a> 
           </p> </div> 
       <p>Today, we’re thrilled to announce <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/nova">Amazon Nova</a>, a new generation of state-of-the-art <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/foundation-models/">foundation models (FMs)</a> that deliver frontier intelligence and industry leading price performance, available exclusively in <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/">Amazon Bedrock</a>.</p> 
       <p>You can use Amazon Nova to lower costs and latency for almost any <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ai/generative-ai/">generative AI</a> task. You can build on Amazon Nova to analyze complex documents and videos, understand charts and diagrams, generate engaging video content, and build sophisticated AI agents, from across a range of intelligence&nbsp;classes optimized for enterprise workloads.</p> 
       <p>Whether you’re developing document processing applications that need to process images and text, creating marketing content at scale, or building AI assistants that can understand and act on visual information, Amazon Nova provides the intelligence and flexibility you need with two categories of models: understanding and creative content generation.</p> 
       <p>Amazon Nova understanding models accept text, image, or video inputs to generate text output. Amazon creative content generation models accept text and image inputs to generate image or video output.</p> 
       <p><span><strong>Understanding models: Text and visual intelligence<br> </strong></span>The Amazon Nova models include three understanding models (with a fourth one coming soon) designed to meet different needs:</p> 
       <p><strong>Amazon Nova Micro</strong> – A text-only model that delivers the lowest latency responses in the Amazon Nova family of models at a very low cost. With a context length of 128K tokens and optimized for speed and cost, Amazon Nova Micro excels at tasks such as text summarization, translation, content classification, interactive chat and brainstorming, and simple mathematical reasoning and coding. Amazon Nova Micro also supports customization on proprietary data using fine-tuning and model distillation to boost accuracy.</p> 
       <p><strong>Amazon Nova Lite</strong> – A very low-cost multimodal model that is lightning fast for processing image, video, and text inputs to generate text output. Amazon Nova Lite can handle real-time customer interactions, document analysis, and visual question-answering tasks with high accuracy. The model processes inputs up to 300K tokens in length and can analyze multiple images or up to 30 minutes of video in a single request. Amazon Nova Lite also supports text and multimodal fine-tuning and can be optimized to deliver the best quality and costs for your use case with techniques such as model distillation.</p> 
       <p><strong>Amazon Nova Pro</strong> – A highly capable multimodal model with the best combination of accuracy, speed, and cost for a wide range of tasks. Amazon Nova Pro is capable of processing up to 300K input tokens and sets new standards in multimodal intelligence and agentic workflows that require calling APIs and tools to complete complex workflows. It achieves state-of-the-art performance on key benchmarks including visual question answering (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.08920">TextVQA</a>) and video understanding (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.03493">VATEX</a>). Amazon Nova Pro demonstrates strong capabilities in processing both visual and textual information and excels at analyzing financial documents. With an input context of 300K tokens, it can process code bases with over fifteen thousand lines of code. Amazon Nova Pro also serves as a teacher model to distill custom variants of Amazon Nova Micro and Lite.</p> 
       <p><strong>Amazon Nova Premier</strong> – Our most capable multimodal model for complex reasoning tasks and for use as the best teacher for distilling custom models. Amazon Nova Premier is still in training. We’re targeting availability in early 2025.</p> 
       <p>Amazon Nova understanding models excel in <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/retrieval-augmented-generation/">Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)</a>, function calling, and agentic applications. This is reflected in Amazon Nova model scores in the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04744">Comprehensive RAG Benchmark (CRAG)</a> evaluation, <a href="https://gorilla.cs.berkeley.edu/blogs/8_berkeley_function_calling_leaderboard.html">Berkeley Function Calling Leaderboard (BFCL)</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05955">VisualWebBench</a>, and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.06070">Mind2Web</a>.</p> 
       <p>What makes Amazon Nova particularly powerful for enterprises is its customization capabilities. Think of it as tailoring a suit: you start with a high-quality foundation and adjust it to fit your exact needs. You can fine-tune the models with text, image, and video to understand your industry’s terminology, align with your brand voice, and optimize for your specific use cases. For instance, a legal firm might customize Amazon Nova to better understand legal terminology and document structures.</p> 
       <p>You can see the latest benchmark scores for these models on the <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/nova">Amazon Nova product page</a>.</p> 
       <p><span><strong>Creative content generation: Bringing concepts to life<br> </strong></span>The Amazon Nova models also include two creative content generation models:</p> 
       <p><strong>Amazon Nova Canvas</strong> – A state-of-the-art image generation model producing studio-quality images with precise control over style and content, including rich editing features such as inpainting, outpainting, and background removal. Amazon Nova Canvas excels on human evaluations and key benchmarks such as <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11897#:~:text=We%20introduce%20TIFA%20(Text%2Dto,visual%20question%20answering%20(VQA).">text-to-image faithfulness evaluation with question answering (TIFA)</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.05977">ImageReward</a>.</p> 
       <p><strong>Amazon Nova Reel</strong> – A state-of-the-art video generation model. Using Amazon Nova Reel, you can produce short videos through text prompts and images, control visual style and pacing, and generate professional-quality video content for marketing, advertising, and entertainment. Amazon Nova Reel outperforms existing models on human evaluations of video quality and video consistency.</p> 
       <p>All Amazon Nova models include built-in safety controls and creative content generation models include watermarking capabilities to promote responsible AI use.</p> 
       <p>Let’s see how these models work in practice for a few use cases.</p> 
       <p><span><strong>Using Amazon Nova Pro for document analysis<br> </strong></span>To demonstrate the capabilities of document analysis, I downloaded the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/decision-guides/latest/generative-ai-on-aws-how-to-choose/guide.html">Choosing a generative AI service</a> decision guide in PDF format from the AWS documentation.</p> 
       <p>First, I choose <strong>Model access</strong> in the <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/bedrock">Amazon Bedrock console</a> navigation pane and request access to the new <strong>Amazon Nova</strong> models. Then, I choose <strong>Chat/text</strong> in the <strong>Playground</strong> section of the navigation pane and select the <strong>Amazon Nova Pro</strong> model. In the chat, I upload the decision guide PDF and ask:</p> 
       <p><code>Write a summary of this doc in 100 words. Then, build a decision tree.</code></p> 
       <p>The output follows my instructions producing a structured decision tree that gives me a glimpse of the document before reading it.</p> 
       <p><a href="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2024/11/13/summary-decision-tree.png"><img src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2024/11/13/summary-decision-tree.png" alt="Console screenshot." width="1726" height="1250"></a></p> 
       <p><span><strong>Using Amazon Nova Pro for video analysis<br> </strong></span>To demonstrate video analysis, I prepared a video by joining two short clips (more on this in the next section):</p> 
        
       <p>This time, I use the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-python/">AWS SDK for Python (Boto3)</a> to invoke the Amazon Nova Pro model using the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/conversation-inference.html">Amazon Bedrock Converse API</a> and analyze the video:</p> 
       <pre><code>import boto3

AWS_REGION = "us-east-1"
MODEL_ID = "amazon.nova-pro-v1:0"
VIDEO_FILE = "the-sea.mp4"

bedrock_runtime = boto3.client("bedrock-runtime", region_name=AWS_REGION)
with open(VIDEO_FILE, "rb") as f:
    video = f.read()

user_message = "Describe this video."

messages = [ { "role": "user", "content": [
    {"video": {"format": "mp4", "source": {"bytes": video}}},
    {"text": user_message}
] } ]

response = bedrock_runtime.converse(
    modelId=MODEL_ID,
    messages=messages,
    inferenceConfig={"temperature": 0.0}
&nbsp;)

response_text = response["output"]["message"]["content"][0]["text"]
print(response_text)</code></pre> 
       <p>Amazon Nova Pro can analyze videos that are uploaded with the API (as in the previous code) or that are stored in an <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/">Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3)</a> bucket.</p> 
       <p>In the script, I ask to describe the video. I run the script from the command line. Here’s the result:</p> 
       <p><code>The video begins with a view of a rocky shore on the ocean, and then transitions to a close-up of a large seashell resting on a sandy beach.</code></p> 
       <p>I can use a more detailed prompt to extract specific information from the video such as objects or text. Note that Amazon Nova currently does not process audio in a video.</p> 
       <p><span><strong>Using Amazon Nova for video creation<br> </strong></span>Now, let’s create a video using Amazon Nova Reel, starting from a text-only prompt and then providing a reference image.</p> 
       <p>Because generating a video takes a few minutes, the Amazon Bedrock API introduced three new operations:</p> 
       <p><strong>StartAsyncInvoke</strong> – To start an asynchronous invocation</p> 
       <p><strong>GetAsyncInvoke</strong> – To get the current status of a specific asynchronous invocation</p> 
       <p><strong>ListAsyncInvokes</strong> – To list the status of all asynchronous invocations with optional filters such as status or date</p> 
       <p>Amazon Nova Reel supports camera control actions such as zooming or moving the camera. This Python script creates a video from this text prompt:</p> 
       <p><code>Closeup of a large seashell in the sand. Gentle waves flow all around the shell. Sunset light. Camera zoom in very close.</code></p> 
       <p>After the first invocation, the script periodically checks the status until the creation of the video has been completed. I pass a random seed to get a different result each time the code runs.</p> 
       <pre><code>import random
import time

       <pre><code>Status: InProgress
. . .
Status: Completed

Video is ready at s3://BUCKET/PREFIX/output.mp4</code></pre> 
       <p>After a few minutes, the script completes and prints the output <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/">Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3)</a> location. I download the output video using the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cli/">AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI)</a>:</p>

        <pre><code>aws s3 cp s3://BUCKET/PREFIX/output.mp4 ./output-from-text.mp4</code></pre> 
       </div> 
       <p>This is the resulting video. As requested, the camera zooms in on the subject.</p> 
        
       <p><span><strong>Using Amazon Nova Reel with a reference image<br> </strong></span>To have better control over the creation of the video, I can provide Amazon Nova Reel a reference image such as the following:</p> 
       <p><a href="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2024/11/20/nova-reel-seascape.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2024/11/20/nova-reel-seascape.png" alt="A seascape image." width="1280" height="720"></a></p> 
       <p>This script uses the reference image and a text prompt with a camera action (<code>drone view flying over a coastal landscape</code>) to create a video:</p>

<div>

<p>Succeeding the Intel <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/search/Arc+Graphics">Arc Graphics</a> discrete graphics cards that launched two years ago as the DG2/Alchemist series, the next-gen <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/search/Battlemage">Battlemage</a> graphics cards are being announced today. The embargo lifts today on the new Intel Arc B-Series graphics cards with initial availability next week. Like the prior generation Intel graphics and as discussed already in many Phoronix articles, Battlemage is still treated to fully open-source graphics driver support on Linux.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.phoronix.com/image-viewer.php?id=intel-arc-b580-battlemage&amp;image=intel_battlemage_2_lrg" target="_blank"><img src="https://www.phoronix.net/image.php?id=intel-arc-b580-battlemage&amp;image=intel_battlemage_2_med" alt="Intel Xe2 render slice"></a></p>
<p>Battlemage makes use of Xe2 graphics, similar to the recent integrated graphics with Lunar Lake.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.phoronix.com/image-viewer.php?id=intel-arc-b580-battlemage&amp;image=intel_battlemage_3_lrg" target="_blank"><img src="https://www.phoronix.net/image.php?id=intel-arc-b580-battlemage&amp;image=intel_battlemage_3_med" alt="Intel Xe 2nd gen core"></a></p>
<p>There's a lot of nice improvements over the two-year old Alchemist graphics.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.phoronix.com/image-viewer.php?id=intel-arc-b580-battlemage&amp;image=intel_battlemage_4_lrg" target="_blank"><img src="https://www.phoronix.net/image.php?id=intel-arc-b580-battlemage&amp;image=intel_battlemage_4_med" alt="Intel Xe2 vector engine"></a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.phoronix.com/image-viewer.php?id=intel-arc-b580-battlemage&amp;image=intel_battlemage_5_lrg" target="_blank"><img src="https://www.phoronix.net/image.php?id=intel-arc-b580-battlemage&amp;image=intel_battlemage_5_med" alt="Intel BMG-G21"></a></p>
<p>For the initial Battlemage graphics is the BMG-G21 GPU with 20 Xe cores, 160 XMX engines, 20 ray-tracing units, 192-bit GDDR6 video memory interface, and other upgrades. Intel is promoting up to a 70% improvement in performance per Xe core and up to a 50% performance per Watt improvement.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.phoronix.com/image-viewer.php?id=intel-arc-b580-battlemage&amp;image=intel_battlemage_6_lrg" target="_blank"><img src="https://www.phoronix.net/image.php?id=intel-arc-b580-battlemage&amp;image=intel_battlemage_6_med" alt="Intel BMG-G21 dGPU gains"></a></p>
<p>Being announced today are the Arc Graphics B580 and B570 graphics cards. The Arc B580 boasts the full 20 Xe cores, 2670MHz graphics clock, 12GB of GDDR6 video memory, and 190 Watt total board power rating. The Arc B570 meanwhile has 18 Xe cores, 2500MHz graphics clock, 10GB of GDDR6 video memory, and rated for 150 Watt board power. While the prior generation had a flagship Arc A770 model, no "Arc B750" or "Arc B770" is being announced today or any other higher-tier part past the Arc B500 series. This is a mid-range focused card primarily for 1440p gaming and less.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.phoronix.com/image-viewer.php?id=intel-arc-b580-battlemage&amp;image=intel_battlemage_8_lrg" target="_blank"><img src="https://www.phoronix.net/image.php?id=intel-arc-b580-battlemage&amp;image=intel_battlemage_8_med" alt="Intel Arc B570 and Arc B580 specs"></a></p>
<p>These new Battlemage graphics cards function on a PCIe 4.0 x8 interface and require one 8-pin PCI Express power connector. AV1, HEVC, AVC, VP9, and XAVC-H hardware acceleration is available but no VVC as found with Lunar Lake.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.phoronix.com/image-viewer.php?id=intel-arc-b580-battlemage&amp;image=intel_battlemage_9_lrg" target="_blank"><img src="https://www.phoronix.net/image.php?id=intel-arc-b580-battlemage&amp;image=intel_battlemage_9_med" alt="Intel Arc B580 performance"></a></p>
<p>Intel with their Windows benchmarks are promoting the Arc B580 as being 24% faster than the Intel Arc A750. Or against the NVIDIA competition they are promoting as 10% faster than the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4060, again under Windows.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.phoronix.com/image-viewer.php?id=intel-arc-b580-battlemage&amp;image=intel_battlemage_10_lrg" target="_blank"><img src="https://www.phoronix.net/image.php?id=intel-arc-b580-battlemage&amp;image=intel_battlemage_10_med" alt="Intel Arc B580 performance against NVIDIA RTX 4060"></a></p>
<p>The Intel Arc B580 will be shipping next week for $249+ USD. The Arc B570 will be shipping 16 January at $219+ USD.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.phoronix.com/image-viewer.php?id=intel-arc-b580-battlemage&amp;image=intel_battlemage_11_lrg" target="_blank"><img src="https://www.phoronix.net/image.php?id=intel-arc-b580-battlemage&amp;image=intel_battlemage_11_med" alt="Intel Arc Battlemage pricing and launch dates"></a></p>
<p>Today's announcement just span the Intel Battlemage details. The review embargo has not yet passed and thus are not able to share any performance details or any new Linux details on the Intel Arc B580/B570 support. So the value add of Phoronix around the Linux performance and support details will come later... But needless to say, as has been covered in many Phoronix articles Intel has spent months already working on the open-source and upstream-oriented Linux support from the Xe kernel driver to the Mesa Iris OpenGL and ANV Vulkan drivers. Plus the Intel Compute Runtime stack for OpenCL and Level Zero. Those can check out the prior <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/search/Battlemage">Battlemage</a> coverage around all the upstream support.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.phoronix.com/image-viewer.php?id=intel-arc-b580-battlemage&amp;image=intel_battlemage_1_lrg" target="_blank"><img src="https://www.phoronix.net/image.php?id=intel-arc-b580-battlemage&amp;image=intel_battlemage_1_med" alt="Intel Xe2"></a></p>
<p>So for launch day you can expect upstream support with <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/news/Linux-6.12-Intel-Xe2-Stable">the stable Linux 6.12 kernel</a> and latest Mesa graphics drivers as already covered in prior Phoronix articles on Mesa/kernel news. Beyond that you'll need to wait to hear all the performance details and more. But at this stage you can expect that I wouldn't have been invited to the Battlemage review briefings if the Linux support was in bad shape and struggling compared to Windows, etc. So stay tuned to learn more soon about Intel Arc B580 graphics on Linux.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/12/02/beeks_group_vmware_opennebula_migration/">https://www.theregister.com/2024/12/02/beeks_group_vmware_opennebula_migration/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42308184">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p>Broadcom has lost another significant customer after UK-based cloud operator Beeks Group decided to adopt the open source OpenNebula stack.</p>
<p>Beeks offers virtual private servers and bare metal boxes for financial services providers and emphasizes low latency for both – and for the trading network it operates.</p>
<p>The biz told <i>The Register</i> it operates in over 20 datacenters and runs a fleet of 20,000-plus virtual machines and more than 3,000 bare metal servers. Most of the VMs now run under OpenNebula – an open source project that provides hybrid cloud features on multiple hypervisors but favors KVM.</p>

    

<p>Beeks head of production management Matthew Cretney told us it moved from VMware due to several factors. A bill from Broadcom for ten times the sum it previously paid for software licenses was one of them. Beeks's customers also told it that VMware was no longer seen as essential infrastructure.</p>

        


        

<p>The tech team also warned management that the quality of VMware's support services and innovation were falling.</p>
<p>A symptom of perceived innovation woes was that Beeks felt VMware's suite had a substantial management overhead – that meant too much of its server fleet was dedicated to managing VMs, not running them for clients.</p>

        

<p>The VMware stack's very nature as a platform to manage virtual machines didn't help, either. Some Beeks customers prefer bare metal, as even the isolation provided by virtualization doesn't satisfy their need for security and low latency. vSphere is not built to manage bare metal servers alongside VMs, and Beeks wanted one tool for both jobs.</p>
<h3>A challenging switch</h3>
<p>Migration wasn't easy. Beeks runs proprietary software that it had tied to VMware APIs, and that had to be rebuilt to interface with OpenNebula.</p>
<p>The open source project's tools to collect metrics Beeks and its clients value – regarding CPU performance, and utilization of CPU, disk, memory, and network resources – were not strong. That's an issue because an overtaxed CPU or disk can be the difference between pleasingly fast trades or missing an opportunity. As OpenNebula is open source, Beeks felt able to develop tools to collect that info – and succeeded to its satisfaction.</p>
<p>Shifting to OpenNebula meant a 200 percent increase in virtual machine efficiency – meaning more VMs on each server, and lower costs for Beeks and its clients.</p>
<ul>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/11/28/broadcom_vmware_vcdx_snafu/">No, Broadcom did not just end VMware's flagship VCDX certification program</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/11/26/amazon_elastic_vmware_service_preview/">AWS bends to Broadcom's will with VMware Cloud Foundation as-a-service</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/11/18/vmware_vcenter_rce_exploited/">Critical 9.8-rated VMware vCenter RCE bug exploited after patch fumble</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Beeks still offers VMware services for customers that want it, but the majority of its VM estate is now on OpenNebula.</p>
<p>Broadcom has positioned VMware's Cloud Foundation (VCF) stack as ideal for organizations with large and complex IT estates. It argues that, while VCF has a substantial price tag, those who implement the entire suite of compute, storage, and network virtualization components will quickly enjoy ROI that proves the bundle represents exceptional value.</p>
<p>Beeks's offerings are a little unusual – and perhaps therefore an edge case for VCF. Broadcom could therefore argue that losing most of this particular customer's business isn't a blow.</p>

        

<p>Yet the UK cloud's decision comes after Broadcom also lost big names such as insurance giant <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/08/28/geico_vmware_openstack_migration/">Geico</a>, fintech <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/05/22/computershare_vm_migration_project/">Computershare</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/05/21/nutanix_vmware_migrations/">Boyd Gaming</a>, and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/05/22/john_deere_vms_legacy/">John Deere</a> – with the post-acquisition licensing terms a common theme behind migration decisions.</p>
<p>US telecom titan AT&amp;T has <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/09/23/att_vmware_quit_claim_broadcom/">threatened</a> to quit VMware too, and claimed such a move would quickly pay for itself – but that may have been a negotiation tactic as it has since <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/11/22/broadcom_vmware_acquisition_first_anniversary/">settled</a> a dispute over a support services contract.</p>
<p>Beeks Group's experience of substantial savings is therefore another example for those considering what to do when their current VMware deals expire – and they face a decision about whether or not to buy into Broadcom's virtual vision. ®</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>Skia Canvas is a browser-less implementation of the HTML Canvas drawing API for Node.js. It is based on Google’s <a href="https://skia.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Skia</a> graphics engine and, accordingly, produces very similar results to Chrome’s <code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code> element. The library is well suited for use on desktop machines where you can render hardware-accelerated graphics to a window and on the server where it can output a variety of image formats.</p><p>While the primary goal of this project is to provide a reliable emulation of the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">standard API</a> according to the <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/canvas.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">spec</a>, it also extends it in a number of areas to take greater advantage of Skia's advanced graphical features and provide a more expressive coding environment.</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>import</span><span>

Heck, we’re incredibly proud of the official <a href="http://next.js/">Next.js conference starter</a> which was originally built with DatoCMS in 2020! However, considering our content and sitemap, several factors came into play to make this decision.</p><h2> Why did you do it? <a data-anchor="why-did-you-do-it" id="why-did-you-do-it"></a><a data-permalink="" href="#why-did-you-do-it"></a></h2><p>There are many reasons why we needed to make BIG changes to our website.</p><h5> TypeScript <a data-anchor="typescript" id="typescript"></a><a data-permalink="" href="#typescript"></a></h5><p>Our Next site was a project born in 2019: five years in the magical frontend world is a geological era (unfortunately). At the time, there were no reliable typed GraphQL schema generators. The result was that the old site was written in pure JS, without TypeScript. Over time, as pages increased, we felt less and less comfortable making big modifications with the confidence of not breaking anything.</p><p>Hence the first objective: <strong>regain confidence by switching to a complete TypeScript codebase</strong>, where every GraphQL query would be fully typed. But since that meant rewriting a good chunk of our code anyways, why not consider alternatives to Next.js?</p><h5> Eating our own dog food <a data-anchor="eating-our-own-dog-food" id="eating-our-own-dog-food"></a><a data-permalink="" href="#eating-our-own-dog-food"></a></h5><p>Our product, DatoCMS, has changed A LOT since 2019. Yet our Next site wasn't leveraging some of the coolest features we've released in recent times, like <a href="https://www.datocms.com/blog/introducing-strict-mode-for-graphql-cda-get-the-best-typescript-dx">GraphQL "Strict Mode"</a> — which pairs wonderfully with TypeScript — but especially <a href="https://www.datocms.com/blog/introducing-datocms-cache-tags">Cache Tags</a>, which can offer top-notch performance through <strong>completely static and cached content</strong>, while still letting visitors access the latest version of any page, seconds after changes have been published.</p><p>We wanted a site that represented <strong>the state of the art of what DatoCMS can offer</strong>.</p><h5> A simpler mental model <a data-anchor="a-simpler-mental-model" id="a-simpler-mental-model"></a><a data-permalink="" href="#a-simpler-mental-model"></a></h5><p>In 2019, Next.js introduced <a href="https://nextjs.org/blog/next-9-3#next-gen-static-site-generation-ssg-support"><code>getStaticProps()</code></a> along with <a href="https://nextjs.org/blog/next-9-3#preview-mode">Draft Mode </a>— a revolutionary hybrid static/dynamic approach that was a breath of fresh air compared to our former Gatsby setup. The developer experience was delightful and straightforward.</p><p>Fast forward to today, and the React ecosystem has transformed dramatically. Setting up React is now so complex that React itself <a href="https://react.dev/learn/start-a-new-react-project">recommends using it exclusively through a framework</a>. Next.js and React have become almost indistinguishable, to the point where, at the time of its public launch, Next.js 15 was using... an unreleased React release candidate?</p><p>Starting with Next.js 14, the introduction of the app router, Server Components, and Incremental Regeneration (ISR) have <strong>exponentially increased complexity</strong>. Our team frequently encountered bewildering results and errors, with Next.js documentation offering little clarity about the underlying mechanics. We're not alone in this frustration — many developers are questioning the framework's direction (i.e. <a href="https://www.epicweb.dev/why-i-wont-use-nextjs">Why I Won't Use Next.js</a>).</p><p>While Next.js 15 addresses some issues, and is an incredibly powerful framework, it feels like React/Next is moving in a direction that isn't ours. <strong>For a content-driven site with static pages that look the same to every visitor, these increasingly sophisticated solutions feel like overkill </strong>and force us into unnecessary complexity.</p><p>Hence the last objectives:</p><ul><li><p><strong>return to a simple mental model</strong> that doesn't require a frontend degree to navigate without making massive errors.</p></li><li><p><strong>design a simple, standards-based architecture</strong> that offers maximum control and remains cost-effective.</p></li></ul><h2> Why Astro? <a data-anchor="why-astro" id="why-astro"></a><a data-permalink="" href="#why-astro"></a></h2><p>With these premises, choosing Astro as the reference framework was quite an obvious consequence.</p><p>To use DatoCMS Cache Tags, the only requirement at the "engine" level of the website is to offer a server-side rendering mode capable of freely manipulating the headers of each page's response, and <a href="https://docs.astro.build/en/reference/api-reference/">Astro checks the box</a>. This is certainly not a strict requirement: Next, Nuxt, SvelteKit... are all frameworks that offer server-side rendering.</p><p>The critical distinction lies in their core architectures. Next, Nuxt, and SvelteKit are built with complex, runtime browser rendering engines — a massive overhead for content-driven websites with minimal interactive elements. This approach introduces unnecessary mental overhead for developers, forcing them to constantly juggle the cognitive load of writing code that must execute flawlessly in both server and browser environments. It also increases the overall computational complexity and page size for the final visitor.</p><p>Astro takes a bold and clear position: it is firmly focused on server-side and static generation. Unlike its competitors, <strong>Astro categorically refuses browser-side rendering</strong>. It doesn't just minimize client-side rendering — it eliminates it entirely. And this goes exactly towards our goal: a simple mental model.</p><blockquote> <p>Wait, why not just use PHP then? 👀</p>  </blockquote><p>Because web development isn't black and white. No site can be completely absent of JavaScript — <em>certainly not ours!</em> And when you need to break free from pure server-side rendering and add interactive elements, Astro provides a seamless solution that PHP simply cannot match.</p><p>Having Vite as its engine, Astro allows you to effortlessly insert JavaScript code, handling all the bundling for you. Moreover: if for particular areas of the page you need strong browser-side interactivity, Astro allows you to insert entire <a href="https://docs.astro.build/en/concepts/islands/">interactive "islands"</a> of React/Vue/Svelte, limiting hydration only to those specific parts.</p><p>That's exactly what we, and most content-driven websites, need: the performance and simplicity of server-side rendering for the vast majority of the pages, combined with targeted, rich interactivity where necessary.</p><p><em>(Also, as you may recall, one of our goals was to incorporate a form of safety net through typed languages. PHP/Ruby/Python are not inherently typed, plus lack advanced tools like TypeScript for automatically managing the typing of GraphQL queries. So yeah, PHP will need to take a backseat for now. </em>🤷‍♂️<em>)</em></p><h2> The new stack <a data-anchor="the-new-stack" id="the-new-stack"></a><a data-permalink="" href="#the-new-stack"></a></h2><figure> <img-lightbox> <a href="https://www.datocms-assets.com/205/1732877403-schema.svg?auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;w=2000"><img src="https://www.datocms-assets.com/205/1732877403-schema.svg"></a></img-lightbox>  <figcaption>Wow, that's a lot of arrows! (14 to be precise)</figcaption> </figure><p>Let's analyze it point by point what we came out with:</p><ul><li><p>The new site is written in Astro and uses the <a href="https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/node/">Node adapter</a>, meaning the final output of a build is a <strong>Node.js server</strong> that needs to run on a physical server. Astro generates new server-side responses for each incoming request.</p></li><li><p>The server in question is a VPS on <a href="https://www.hetzner.com/">Hetzner</a>. The app deployment is managed by <a href="https://kamal-deploy.org/">Kamal</a>, and can occur manually from the command line or via GitHub Actions. With Hetzner's outrageous prices, you can acquire all the necessary hardware for the task, and more, for just €15/month.</p></li><li><p>The domain <code>www-draft.datocms.com</code> points directly to the Astro server.</p></li><li><p>The domain <code>www.datocms.com</code>, on the other hand, points to Fastly, a CDN that supports <a href="https://docs.fastly.com/en/guides/working-with-surrogate-keys">surrogate keys</a>. Fastly uses <code>www-draft.datocms.com</code> as the origin.</p></li><li><p>Astro pages, depending on whether the request host is either <code>www-draft</code> or <code>www</code>, will execute GraphQL requests to DatoCMS with the <a href="https://www.datocms.com/docs/content-delivery-api/api-endpoints#preview-mode-to-retrieve-draft-content"><code>X-Include-Drafts</code> header</a> either active or not. This allows our team to access draft content while regular visitors do not.</p></li><li><p>Astro also leverages <a href="https://www.datocms.com/blog/introducing-datocms-cache-tags">DatoCMS Cache Tags</a> to cache pages on Fastly indefinitely. In practical terms, Astro reads the <code>X-Cache-Tags</code> header for each GraphQL request made to DatoCMS, and applies those tags identically in its own response via the <code>Surrogate-Key</code> header.</p></li></ul><p>There's only one missing piece: cache invalidation. DatoCMS, through webhooks, sends cache invalidation tags to the Astro server with every content change on the CMS. Astro then uses those tags to <a href="https://docs.fastly.com/en/guides/purging-with-surrogate-keys">purge the Fastly cache</a> via an API call:</p><figure> <img-lightbox> <a href="https://www.datocms-assets.com/205/1732877411-schema2.svg?auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;w=2000"><img src="https://www.datocms-assets.com/205/1732877411-schema2.svg"></a></img-lightbox>  <figcaption>Cache invalidation via DatoCMS Webhooks</figcaption> </figure><h2> How did it go? <a data-anchor="how-did-it-go" id="how-did-it-go"></a><a data-permalink="" href="#how-did-it-go"></a></h2><p>Honestly, <strong>we cannot be happier</strong> about the final result:</p><ul><li><p>Astro's support for TypeScript is excellent, and in general, it has allowed us to do everything we needed, even when we had to go outside "the norm".</p></li><li><p>The mental model of the architecture is extremely simple: <strong>everything's server-side generated. Period.</strong> No re-hydration, no huge client-side JavaScript bundles.</p></li><li><p>Our team can work on the content and see the results in real-time as they save their drafts through <a href="https://www.datocms.com/marketplace/plugins/i/datocms-plugin-web-previews">Web Previews</a> and <a href="https://www.datocms.com/docs/astro/real-time-updates">Real-time Updates</a>.</p></li><li><p>End visitors always get cached content from CDN (thanks to <a href="https://httpwg.org/specs/rfc5861.html#rfc.section.3"><code>stale-while-revalidate</code></a>), so the <strong>response is immediate</strong>.</p></li><li><p>Thanks to cache tags, <strong>cache purging is laser-precise</strong>, ensuring that only the pages that truly require updates are invalidated...</p></li><li><p>...yet, developers do not need to take any action to manage all the traditional complexity of caching. Once again, the mental model is straightforward, to the extent that <strong>you can forget about it</strong>.</p></li><li><p>Thanks to Fastly, <strong>cache purging happens in less than 150ms</strong>: if we accidentally publish incorrect content, we can correct it instantly, without having to wait minutes for a build to complete.</p></li><li><p>Complete builds and cache purging only occur when a new version of the repo is pushed. In our case, the <strong>total build time is approximately 3 minutes</strong>. We can probably improve this if we commit ourselves... the important feature, however, is that this time is <strong>independent of the number of pages</strong> on the site.</p></li><li><p>Last, but not least: <strong>hosting costs are ridiculously low</strong>.</p></li></ul><h2> How bad was the actual migration? <a data-anchor="how-bad-was-the-actual-migration" id="how-bad-was-the-actual-migration"></a><a data-permalink="" href="#how-bad-was-the-actual-migration"></a></h2><p>Our site is about a hundred different sections: from the beginning of the first tests to the full release, approximately <strong>two and a half months</strong> have passed.

                                        <p>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol declared an “emergency martial law,” Tuesday accusing the country’s opposition of controlling the parliament, sympathizing with North Korea and paralyzing the government with anti-state activities.</p><p>Yoon made the announcement in a televised briefing Tuesday, vowing to “eradicate pro-North Korean forces and protect the constitutional democratic order.” </p><p>It wasn’t immediately clear how Yoon’s step would affect the country’s governance and democracy. The move drew immediate opposition from politicians, including the leader of his own conservative party, Han Dong-hoon, who called the decision “wrong” and vowed to “stop it with the people.” Opposition leader Lee Jae-myung, who narrowly lost to Yoon in the 2022 presidential election, called Yoon’s announcement “illegal and unconstitutional.”</p>
    

<p>“Through this martial law, I will rebuild and protect the free Republic of Korea, which is falling into the depths of national ruin,” Yoon said during a televised speech, invoking South Korea’s formal name.</p><p>“I will eliminate anti-state forces as quickly as possible and normalize the country,” he said, while asking the people to believe in him and tolerate “some inconveniences.”</p>



<p>Yoon — whose approval rating has dipped in recent months — has struggled to push his agenda against an opposition-controlled parliament since taking office in 2022.</p>
    
    
    
<p>Yoon’s conservative People Power Party had been locked in an impasse with the liberal opposition Democratic Party over next year’s budget bill. The opposition has also been attempting to pass motions to impeach three top prosecutors, including the chief of the Seoul Central District Prosecutors’ Office, in what the conservatives have called a vendetta against their criminal investigations on Lee, who has been seen as the favorite for the next presidential election in 2027 in opinion polls.</p><p>Yoon has also been dismissing calls for independent investigations into scandals involving his wife and top officials, drawing quick, strong rebukes from his political rivals. The Democratic Party reportedly called an emergency meeting of its lawmakers following Yoon’s announcement.</p>

<p>Note: the patch is available at the end of the article (<b><a href="#download">HERE</a></b>). This post is about its making-of.</p>

<h3 id="intro">Intro</h3>

<p>Stunt Island is a flight simulator from the year 1992. You can read more about it in my <a href="https://annali.netlify.app/2024/11/15/stunt-island-elegy">previous post</a>.</p>

<p>Last month I finally beat the game, winning all the missions and getting the title of “Stuntman of the year”. While I was replaying the videos of my attempts, as well as some fan-made SI films in the channel, I wondered if I could somehow mitigate the obvious limitations of the rendering engine.</p>

<p>Also, I was always fascinated by the art of reverse engineering, and I thought this could be a good opportunity to learn something in this field. Assembly is not new to me, but dealing with an archaic DOS program, working without gdb’s features and any kind of debug symbols means entering an entirely different world.</p>

<p>I spent a dozen of hours learning the tools of the trade and trying to figure out the puzzle, and I was very happy of my eventual success. After finding and patching the right location in the executable, the engine got some extra horsepower. No extra resolution unfortunately, but many more details, as one can see in the comparisons below.</p>

<p>For a video comparison, one can check out <a href="https://youtu.be/AZMDm-2IIzc?si=7q4pK-dFhUyMhEyJ"><b>this “remaster” of the movie <em>Mickey’s Revenge</em></b></a>, courtesy of Doug Armknecht’s “Stunt Island Central” channel.</p>

<p>In the following, I’ll show the process and some failed tries. Even if this is far from being a professional effort, I hope that publishing this can be of help to other learners, or maybe induce some experts to chime in and suggest improvements (in the name of Cunningham’s Law). Tutorials about debugging with DOSBox are rare to find, so I feel that even this small example can be useful.</p>

<p>Also, I hope to revive some interest in an old, but beautiful and unique game.</p>

<h3 id="start">Start</h3>

<p>Since I have never debugged DOS programs, the first step is to build up the toolset. I need</p>

<ul>
  <li>DOSBox debug to run and live-debug the game</li>
  <li>Ghidra to decompile and analyze the executable. There are other DOS-compatible decompilers around, but I liked Ghidra’s “late Nineties” UI, even if it does not render nicely on Linux. I used the older 10.4 version for compatibility with my Debian’s openjdk package.</li>
  <li>Bless, my favorite hex editor</li>
</ul>

<p>I start by opening the game executable in Ghidra. The first result is underwhelming:</p>

<p>Just one function and a lot of non-decompiled bytes, that does not look good. Maybe the decompile process failed?</p>

<p>Let’s look at the function. I cannot grasp all the details, but it seems to be copying a buffer. This rings a bell – I remember reading some articles about self-decrypting executables. Could it be that the real game code is obfuscated and only revealed after the startup?</p>

<p>By the way, what does the file header look like?</p>

<div><pre><code>$ hexdump -C STUNT.EXE | head -5 
00000000  4d 5a 18 00 0d 01 00 00  02 00 20 1c ff ff e9 3c  |MZ........ ....&lt;|

</code></pre></div>

<p>Seeing the “LZ91” finally clicks for me. This game was probably compressed by some variant of the Lempel-Ziv algorithm. Some googling leads me first to <a href="https://www.lodsb.com/reversing-lz91-from-commander-keen">this article by Sam Russell</a> and then to <a href="https://moddingwiki.shikadi.net/wiki/UNLZEXE">the UNLZEXE unpacker</a>. Turns out that the original compression tool was authored by the prolific genius Fabrice Bellard.</p>

<p>OK, let’s decompress the executable and reload it in Ghidra:</p>

<p>Looks better. Can we make any sense of the functions?</p>

<p>Nope, this is over my paygrade. But we are in 2024, maybe we can seek the help of a LLM? Copilot says:</p>

<p><small><blockquote>
This looks like assembly code mixed with some higher-level C code constructs, dealing with system-level operations. Here’s a bit of a breakdown:<br>
* Initial Setup: The function begins by initializing variables and handling some immediate checks and adjustments.<br>
* Comparisons and Bit Manipulations: It checks some global variables and performs bit shifts and comparisons to adjust the control flow based on these conditions.<br>
* System Calls: There are several system interrupt calls, likely interacting with hardware or the operating system.<br>
* Function Calls: The code calls other functions (like FUN_1f59_36f7, FUN_1f59_0bc2, and FUN_1f59_0c2c) which perform some specific tasks.<br>
* Loops: The code includes loops and conditional checks to perform repeated tasks or to continue execution based on certain conditions.<br>
* The main flow is about handling and manipulating certain global variables and possibly hardware states, based on the names and types used. However, without more context on these global variables and the overall program architecture, it's tough to pin down the exact purpose.

<p>Oh, I see, “the code calls other functions which perform some specific tasks”. Awesome. Thanks all the same, AI. See you in some years, and let’s rely on carbon-based intelligence in the meanwhile.</p>

<h3 id="a-matter-of-detail">A matter of detail</h3>

<p>The static analysis has not yielded any result yet, but I have another idea. Stunt Island has a “Detail” setting:</p>

<center>

<img src="https://annali.netlify.app/assets/2024-11-20--tweaking-stunt-island/si-detail.png" alt="drawing" width="640">
</a>
</center>

<p>My hope is to find out where the detail level (here, 75%) is stored in the memory, and to change it to 255, or to see how it is used in the rendering process.</p>

<p>Let’s fire up Dosbox debug. The best manual for the interface is <a href="https://www.vogons.org/viewtopic.php?t=3944">a thread on the Vogons forum</a>.</p>

</a>
</center>

<p>The GUI is nice, even if I miss the amenities of modern debugging, especially the function names. However, credit is due to the authors: they put in nice features like a branch predictor that shows whether a jump instruction will be taken, and in which direction (back or forward), assuming that the current status of registries and memory stays the same.</p>

<p>How to find the location of the detail level variable? I navigate again to the “Preferences” screen and spend a lot of time there, trying to devise a method to extract such information. My list of failed attempts includes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Break on keyboard input: I set a breakpoint on keypress (<code>BPINT 16</code>) and press “Return” with the mouse pointing on the “plus” sign. The program breaks in a input-reading routine, but stepping through the code I lose my way before being able to understand what the program is doing. Considering I could be in the middle of a complex UI-drawing routine, I give up.</li>
  <li>Break on mouse move or click: there is a <a href="https://www.vogons.org/viewtopic.php?f=31&amp;t=83267">helpful guide</a> for that, but again I end up in a mysterious land.</li>
  <li>Break on pixel change: I manage to break the program when a pixel in the detail scroller changes (<code>bpmem a1000:3500</code>). Again, I cannot find the way out of the graphics code.</li>
  <li>In Ghidra, look for a printf format string with a number and a percent (something like <code>"%u%%"</code>): nothing found</li>
</ul>

<p>While looking for other ideas, I find a nice <a href="https://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php/HOWTO-Reverse_Engineering">list of techniques</a> by the makers of ScummVM. One of the options is “File Access”, which reminds me that the game must store its preferences somewhere. A quick search by date reveals that a file with the promising name <code>GAME.VAR</code> is updated every time I alter the settings. Let’s see how it changes when a different detail level is chosen. At 99% detail we have</p>

<div><pre><code>$ hexdump -C GAME.VAR 
00000000  70 fd ff 01 ff ff ff ff  ff ff 99 e7 0b 00 38 01  |p.............8.|
00000010  64 02 0b 00 57 01 64 02  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  |d...W.d.........|
00000020  00 00 00                                          |...|
00000023
</code></pre></div>

<p>Now let’s set 1% detail:</p>

<div><pre><code>$ hexdump -C GAME.VAR 
00000000  8f 02 ff 01 ff ff ff ff  ff ff 99 e7 0b 00 38 01  |..............8.|
00000010  64 02 0b 00 57 01 64 02  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  |d...W.d.........|
00000020  00 00 00                                          |...|
00000023
</code></pre></div>

<p>So the detail level is in the very first two bytes. Unluckily, it seems already to be scaled, with 100% = <code>0xffff</code>. No chance to simply set it higher. But let’s not lose hope so soon: we have now more information to find out where in the memory this value is stored, and maybe we can change something else in the 3D computations.</p>

<p>I need a breakpoint when <code>GAME.SAV</code> is written. According to an <a href="https://mrszeto.net/CIT/interrupts.htm">old but practical</a> guide to the interrupt table, a file write is triggered by calling interrupt <code>21h</code> with <code>40h</code> in registry <code>AH</code>. Dosbox can set a breakpoint on precisely this event:</p>

<center>
<a href="https://annali.netlify.app/assets/2024-11-20--tweaking-stunt-island/si-bpint-21-40.png">
<img src="https://annali.netlify.app/assets/2024-11-20--tweaking-stunt-island/si-bpint-21-40.png" alt="drawing" width="800">
</a>
</center>

<p>I change the detail level, close the preferences window and, bingo! Breakpoint triggered.</p>

<center>
<a href="https://annali.netlify.app/assets/2024-11-20--tweaking-stunt-island/si-config-save.png">
<img src="https://annali.netlify.app/assets/2024-11-20--tweaking-stunt-island/si-config-save.png" alt="drawing" width="800">
</a>
</center>

<p>The bytes to write are in <code>DS:DX</code>, so <code>1628:2FEA</code>. Let’s have a look:</p>

<center>
<a href="https://annali.netlify.app/assets/2024-11-20--tweaking-stunt-island/si-2fea.png">
<img src="https://annali.netlify.app/assets/2024-11-20--tweaking-stunt-island/si-2fea.png" alt="drawing" width="800">
</a>
</center>

<p>Yes, the 16-bit value at that address matches the detail level I set (<code>0x3d70/0xffff ~= 0.24</code>). I bet that this is a global variable and will stay there for the whole duration of the program, what I verify by starting a mission:</p>

<center>
<a href="https://annali.netlify.app/assets/2024-11-20--tweaking-stunt-island/si-detail-global.png">
<img src="https://annali.netlify.app/assets/2024-11-20--tweaking-stunt-island/si-detail-global.png" alt="drawing" width="800">
</a>
</center>

<p>The value is still there. Very nice.</p>

<h3 id="following-the-dataflow">Following the dataflow</h3>

<p>Now I have to see where this variable is used. Let’s go back to Ghidra, and look for the low two bytes.</p>

<center>
<a href="https://annali.netlify.app/assets/2024-11-20--tweaking-stunt-island/ghidra-2fea.png">
<img src="https://annali.netlify.app/assets/2024-11-20--tweaking-stunt-island/ghidra-2fea.png" alt="drawing" width="800">
</a>
</center>

<p>I am lucky, not too many occurences.</p>

<p>First location: <code>CS:4CDA</code>. Ghidra decompiles the code to</p>

<div><pre><code>    *(int *)0xb86 =
         (int)((ulong)*(uint *)0x2fea * 100 &gt;&gt; 0x10) + *(int *)0xa5a +
         (uint)((int)((ulong)*(uint *)0x2fea * 100) &lt; 0);
</code></pre></div>

<p>Not super clear, but the meaning becomes evident when I set a breakpoint there (<code>BP CS:4CD8</code>): the line is executed only when I open the preferences box. So the “100” in the code must be part of the rescaling to a percentage.</p>

<p>Second location: <code>CS:680E</code>. The assembly is clearer than the C equivalent:</p>

<div><pre><code>       1000:6809 a1 ea 91        MOV        AX,[0x91ea]
       1000:680c f7 26 ea 2f     MUL        word ptr [0x2fea]
       1000:6810 d1 e0           SHL        AX,0x1
       1000:6812 d1 d2           RCL        DX,0x1
       1000:6814 89 16 f2 91     MOV        word ptr [0x91f2],DX
</code></pre></div>

<p>So, the variable at <code>DS:91EA</code> get multiplied by the detail level, and then written at <code>DS:91F2</code>. No idea what <code>DS:91EA</code> is, though. I first think that this routine is calculating some per-polygon quantity, but it turns out that it is only run once per frame. Also, when I run some frames in mission 1 the variable at <code>DS:91EA</code> switches between <code>0x0999</code> and <code>0x7FFF</code>. Let’s ignore the matter: we now know that at <code>DS:91F2</code> something gets written that is proportional to the detail level. Moreover, with Detail set at 100% this variable is often set at <code>0xFFFD</code>, almost the maximum.</p>

<p>I look for <code>f2 91</code> in Ghidra: it only yields two occurrences. One is the fragment we just analyzed, the other is in the middle of some bytes that Ghidra did not decompile automatically.</p>

<center>
<a href="https://annali.netlify.app/assets/2024-11-20--tweaking-stunt-island/ghidra-91f2.png">
<img src="https://annali.netlify.app/assets/2024-11-20--tweaking-stunt-island/ghidra-91f2.png" alt="drawing" width="800">
</a>
</center>

<p>Well, there is no other place to look, so I ask Ghidra to decompile this section. Some attempts later, a plausible assembly appears:</p>

<center>
<a href="https://annali.netlify.app/assets/2024-11-20--tweaking-stunt-island/ghidra-91f2-found.png">
<img src="https://annali.netlify.app/assets/2024-11-20--tweaking-stunt-island/ghidra-91f2-found.png" alt="drawing" width="800">
</a>
</center>

<p>I ensure that the decompilation is right by setting a breakpoint at the start of the fragment (<code>BP CS:76E8</code>), and for added safety I verify that the program counter (<code>EIP</code>) really points to the locations shown in the listing. This code gets executed many, many times per frame – have I finally reached the goal?</p>

<h3 id="ace-gets-glasses">Ace gets glasses</h3>

<p>Let’s try to understand the code: first it decrements <code>AX</code> and executes what follows only if it’s still positive. Not sure what this means but some live debugging shows that the condition is met quite often anyway. The following calculation is easier to understand: in the x86 architecture, calling <code>MUL</code> multiplies <code>AX</code> by the operand, leaving the  result in <code>DX:AX</code>. With maximum detail, we know that <code>DS:91F2</code> will be set at <code>0xFFFD</code>, so that the multiplication becomes almost a 16-bit left shift, setting <code>DX</code> to <code>(AX_old - 1)</code>. The lower the detail, the lower <code>DX</code> will be. Then the code executes the following branch only if <code>CX &lt;= DX + BX</code>, otherwise it gets skipped.</p>

<p>In an <a href="https://fabiensanglard.net/stunt_island/">interview by Fabien Sanglard</a>, Stunt Island’s main programmer Adrian Stephens revealed an important aspect of the rendering engine: each 3D entity in the game is represented as a tree, and the game decides whether to render the (coarser) top nodes or the (finer) lower levels according to their distance from the observer. And we see here that a subroutine gets executed if <code>CX</code> is under a certain threshold, which gets bigger the bigger is the detail level. Let’s make the bold hypothesis that <code>CX</code> is the object distance, and <code>(DX + BX)</code> determines the distance threshold under which a higher-resolution model gets loaded.</p>

<p>I can test the hypothesis by overwriting the calculation with new code. Let’s start by setting the threshold to zero. Ghidra shows which bytes to insert:</p>

</a>
</center>

<p>I can do that in the live program:</p>

</a>
</center>

<p>The experiment works perfectly: all details disappear, Jackson City is reduced to flatland.</p>

<center>
<a href="https://annali.netlify.app/assets/2024-11-20--tweaking-stunt-island/flatland.png">
<img src="https://annali.netlify.app/assets/2024-11-20--tweaking-stunt-island/flatland.png" alt="drawing" width="640">
</a>
</center>

<p>But what I want is the contrary: changing the code so that the max resolution gets used for all objects. Let’s just set the threshold to the max:</p>

<div><pre><code>SM cs:76f4 c7 c2 ff 7f 66 90 
(MOV DX, 0x7FFF ; NOP) 
</code></pre></div>

<p>This makes the engine totally unresponsive to the keyboard commands. I guess I was too greedy. My second try is more modest:</p>

<div><pre><code>SM cs:76f4 c7 c2 ff 4f 66 90 
(MOV DX, 0x4FFF ; NOP) 
</code></pre></div>

<p>And here we are: Stunt Island in the best detail you’ll ever get in a 320x200 window! Pity that the system is still just barely responsive: even with DOSBox’s CPU set to max performance, I cannot control my plane, and this is the best screenshot I am able to take before crashing.</p>

</a>
</center>

<p>But there is a better way to go sightseeing: the rendering routine is shared across flight sim, video player and set designer, and at least in the last mode I can take all the time I need to steer the camera. It takes some minutes to push the extremely sluggish control, but after a while I can frame Jackson City and surroundings, looking more gorgeous than ever!</p>

</a>
</center>

<p>Now that I explored the limits, it’s time to turn back the dial and find some compromise to make the game playable. The current patch is brutal, it just uses a fixed threshold ignoring the original value in <code>DX</code>. We know that <code>DX</code> is approximately <code>AX_old * (detail_level/100)</code>, maxing out at <code>AX_old - 1</code> if the detail level is 100%. What about putting a multiple of <code>AX</code> there? The space is limited, only 6 bytes, but a bitshift is compact enough. After some experiments, I settle on</p>

<div><pre><code>89 c2 c1   MOV DX,AX 
e2 03      SHL DX,0x3
90         NOP
</code></pre></div>

<p>which would be the equivalent of a 800% detail. I patch it in using the Dosbox command:</p>

<div><pre><code>SM cs:76f4 89 c2 c1 e2 03 90  
</code></pre></div>

<p>And everything goes as hoped: the quality is great and the game (after cranking up Dosbox’s CPU to the max) runs quite fluidly. Time to celebrate!</p>

</a>
</center>

<p>By the way, the fact that the three most significant bits of <code>DX</code> are discarded does not seem to lead to any noticeable glitch; I could add some code checking for overflow and saturating the value, but this would require more bytes than I am replacing. I might create the algorithm elsewhere and then <code>JMP</code> to it, but at the price of making the code slower and the patching process more difficult. The current version is simple and good enough for me, and after all one must leave some fun to future tinkerers.</p>

<h3 id="washing-the-dishes">Washing the dishes</h3>

<p>Before calling it a day, I still have some housework to do.</p>

<p>First, I need to edit the executables to avoid having to live-patch the code every time. Stunt Island provides not only the game executable (<code>STUNT.EXE</code>), but also a video encoder and a player (<code>MAKEONE</code> and <code>PLAYONE</code>), so that users can distribute and view their films without having to navigate through the game interface. To do a complete work, I want to patch all these files.</p>

<p>Fortunately, the rendering code is the same in all three executables. However, the detail variable is stored at different addresses, so the assembly is not the same. The easiest way to find the relevant location is to search for the instructions that follow the <code>MUL</code> (so the <code>ADD / CMP / JG</code> sequence): they only refer to register values, so their encoding (<code>03 D3 3B CA 7F 1B</code>) is the same in all the files to patch.</p>

<center>
<a href="https://annali.netlify.app/assets/2024-11-20--tweaking-stunt-island/bless-search.png">
<img src="https://annali.netlify.app/assets/2024-11-20--tweaking-stunt-island/bless-search.png" alt="drawing" width="600">
</a>
</center>

<p>Then, we move four bytes back, and we replace the “multiply by the detail level” segment (<code>F7 26 XX XX 03 D3</code>) with the “multiply by 8” code (<code>89 C2 C1 E2 03 90</code>).</p>

<center>
<a href="https://annali.netlify.app/assets/2024-11-20--tweaking-stunt-island/bless-replace.png">
<img src="https://annali.netlify.app/assets/2024-11-20--tweaking-stunt-island/bless-replace.png" alt="drawing" width="600">
</a>
</center>

<p>The operation works well on all three executables. The patched <code>PLAYONE</code> can only play films created by the patched <code>MAKEONE</code>, but this seems reasonable. I guess that the films created by the vanilla <code>MAKEONE</code> are missing the high-polygon versions of the far objects.</p>

<p>Second, I must create a patching program that can upgrade the game without embedding Disney’s code. It would be nice to just implement it as simple search and replace for the six bytes that need to be overwriten, but unfortunately there is the problem of the LZ compression. I cannot bundle <code>unlzexe</code>, whose copyright status is unclear, so I end up recompressing the patched executable and diffing it with the unpatched version. The compression smears my 3-byte change all over the file creating a big diff, but this seems to me the least worst method. The patcher then applies the diff to the original game file, which must be provided by the user. This should put the patch on the safe side, copyright-wise.</p>

<p>Finally, I am informed that Disney released a patch (“#3”) containing some features like an alternative beginner-friendly flight model. It would be good if the 800% mod also worked on this version. Luckily the renderer was not changed so the same patching method can be used. The only surprise happens when uncompressing the new <code>.EXE</code>: it turns that the compression method was slightly changed (from LZ091 to LZ091E), and <code>unlzexe</code> does not recognize the format. However, the algorithm is the same, just the magic number used for the format identification has changed. Commenting out the magic number check in the source code of <code>unlzexe</code> solves the problem: I can uncompress the file and create a patch using the same process of the original game.</p>

<p>So, here the best Stunt Island one can have, with the enhanced rendering engine and the quality-of-life improvements of Disney’s patch:</p>

<p>The study finds that while <strong>.com</strong> and <strong>.net</strong> domains made up approximately half of all domains registered in the past year (more than all of the other TLDs combined) they accounted for just over 40 percent of all cybercrime domains. Interisle says an almost equal share — 37 percent — of cybercrime domains were registered through new gTLDs.</p>
<p>Spammers and scammers gravitate toward domains in the new gTLDs because these registrars tend to offer cheap or free registration with little to no account or identity verification requirements. For example, among the gTLDs with the highest cybercrime domain scores in this year’s study, nine offered registration fees for less than $1, and nearly two dozen offered fees of less than $2.00. By comparison, the cheapest price identified for a .com domain was $5.91.</p>
<p>Currently, there are around 2,500 registrars authorized to sell domains by the <strong>Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers</strong> (ICANN), the California nonprofit that oversees the domain industry.</p>

<p>Incredibly, despite years of these reports showing phishers heavily abusing new gTLDs, ICANN is shuffling forward on a plan to introduce even more of them. ICANN’s proposed <a href="https://newgtldprogram.icann.org/en/application-rounds/round2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">next round envisions</a> accepting applications for new gTLDs in 2026.</p>
<p><strong>John Levine </strong>is author of the book “The Internet for Dummies” and president of CAUCE. Levine said adding more TLDs without a much stricter registration policy will likely further expand an already plentiful greenfield for cybercriminals.</p>
<p>“The problem is that ICANN can’t make up their mind whether they are the neutral nonprofit regulator or just the domain speculator trade association,” Levine told KrebsOnSecurity. “But they act a lot more like the latter.”<span id="more-69531"></span></p>
<p>Levine said the vast majority of new gTLDs have a few thousand domains — a far cry from the number of registrations they would need just to cover the up-front costs of operating a new gTLD (~$180,000-$300,000). New gTLD registrars can quickly attract customers by selling domains cheaply to customers who buy domains in bulk, but that tends to be a losing strategy.</p>
<p>“Selling to criminals and spammers turns out to be lousy business,” Levine said. “You can charge whatever you want on the first year, but you have to charge list price on domain renewals. And criminals and spammers never renew. So if it sounds like the economics makes no sense it’s because the economics makes no sense.”</p>
<p>In virtually all previous spam reports, Interisle found the top brands referenced in phishing attacks were the largest technology companies, including Apple, Facebook, Google and PayPal. But this past year, Interisle found the <strong>U.S. Postal Service</strong> was by far the most-phished entity, with more than four times the number of phishing domains as the second most-frequent target (Apple).</p>
<p>At least some of that increase is likely from a prolific cybercriminal using the nickname <strong>Chenlun</strong>, who&nbsp;has been <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2023/10/phishers-spoof-usps-12-other-natl-postal-services/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">selling phishing kits targeting domestic postal services</a> in the United States and at least a dozen other countries.</p>
<p>Interisle says an increasing number of phishers are eschewing domain registrations altogether, and instead taking advantage of subdomain providers like <strong>blogspot.com</strong>, <strong>pages.dev</strong>, and <strong>weebly.com</strong>. The report notes that cyberattacks hosted at subdomain provider services can be tough to mitigate, because only the subdomain provider can disable malicious accounts or take down malicious web pages.</p>
<p>“Any action upstream, such as blocking the second-level domain, would have an impact across the provider’s whole customer base,” the report observes.</p>
<p>Interisle tracked more than 1.18 million instances of subdomains used for phishing in the past year (a 114 percent increase), and found more than half of those were subdomains at blogspot.com and other services operated by Google.</p>
<p>“Many of these services allow the creation of large numbers of accounts at one time, which is highly exploited by criminals,” the report concludes. “Subdomain providers should limit the number of subdomains (user accounts) a customer can create at one time and suspend automated, high-volume automated account sign-ups – especially using free services.”</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://blog.erodriguez.de/dependency-management-fatigue-or-why-i-forever-ditched-react-for-go-htmx-templ/">https://blog.erodriguez.de/dependency-management-fatigue-or-why-i-forever-ditched-react-for-go-htmx-templ/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42305348">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>After getting to work on some personal projects using Go+HTMX+Templ this year, I have decided to give up on using React on any personal projects.</p><p>You can actually find a lot of compelling arguments for ditching React in favor of HTMX in the essays found in the HTMX official website.
But I feel that not that many people are speaking about <strong>dependency management fatigue</strong>.</p><h2 id="what-is-dependency-management-fatigue">What is dependency management fatigue?</h2><p>After working on my last personal project that used React (an <a href="https://github.com/erodrigufer/catDict">interactive Catalan dictionary</a>), I realized that I was spending too much time dealing with dependency updates of mostly React packages.
I would update my packages to their latest release, only to realize that their APIs had breaking changes that forced me to invest time refactoring my code.</p><p>I wanted to keep up with any dependency updates because my webapp was back then deployed as a publicly accessible service in an EC2 instance and I wanted to avoid any possible vulnerabilities.</p><h2 id="do-we-really-need-a-new-major-version-release">Do we really need a new major version release?</h2><p>Some of the worst offenders in this respect were <code>wouter</code> (a React router package) and <code>TanStackQuery</code> (which I was using to fetch, cache and manage state from the backend).
<code>wouter</code> is, as of December 2024, at major version 3, while <code>TanStackQuery</code> is at major version 5.</p><p>I wasn’t using these packages for minor, stylistic features in my webapp, they were fundamental for the proper working of my webapp.
If they broke, my webapp fatally broke as well, i.e. no more data fetching from the backend and no more correct routing.
There was nothing similar to <em>progressive enhancement</em> in this case.</p><p>The first time that one of these React libraries broke my application with a major version bump, I refactored my code without any questioning.</p><p>But the second time that this happened, it just felt odd.
I started asking myself:</p><ul><li>Is my webapp getting some actual <strong>benefits</strong> (apart from maybe security patches) from this major version release?</li><li>Is it necessary to literally <strong>break</strong> the API of a fundamental component in a React webapp <strong>5 times</strong> ?!?!</li><li>How much time am I losing on this, when I could be shipping new features or other products?</li></ul><p>The answers to these questions were:</p><ol><li>No, my webapp wasn’t getting any additional benefits.
I was already happy with the functionality of these packages.</li><li>I am not a core maintainer of these libraries, so it is hard for me to answer the second question.
But I would say no.
Plan your API design wisely.
Only ship features that you plan to maintain in the long-term.
Do not unnecessarily rename your exported objects.</li></ol><p>Look, I am really grateful for open source maintainers, and you can do whatever you want with your projects (I myself do the same with mine).
But if your goal is to sustain a happy userbase, I would say that appreciating the user’s precious time must be a big priority.</p><h2 id="i-just-dont-have-the-time-to-deal-with-this">I just don’t have the time to deal with this…</h2><p>Which gets me to one of the main points of this article.
Why is this such a big issue?</p><p>Well, at least for me, it boils down to me not having that much free time left.
So, if I somehow find some free time to work on my personal coding projects, I don’t want to waste it refactoring my code to work after the major version bump of a dependency.
I actually want to work on features or start new projects.</p><p>If you are building a product for a client, and you will charge for future maintenance work, then be my guest, use as many unstable dependencies as you like.
It might be in your own best financial interest to do so.
But if you are trying to build a product that requires as little upkeep as necessary after being shipped, I’ll stay as far as possible from the JS ecosystem.</p><h2 id="gohtmxtempl">Go+HTMX+Templ</h2><p>That is maybe the main reason why I will solely use Go+HTMX+Templ in my personal projects from now on.
This is maybe just anecdotal evidence, but the Go projects I’ve worked on let me focus on shipping features, while not ignoring general dependency/security updates.
The language itself has kept a remarkably stable stdlib and language specification.</p><p><a href="https://lobste.rs/s/xyvjbb/dependency_management_fatigue_why_i">Discuss in Lobsters</a></p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                      
                      
          <p>Companies have been discussing migrating off of VMware since Broadcom’s takeover a year ago led to higher costs and other <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/06/price-hikes-of-over-2x-widely-expected-under-broadcoms-vmware-survey-finds/">controversial changes</a>. Now we have an inside look at one of the larger customers that recently made the move.</p>
<p>According to a report from <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/12/02/beeks_group_vmware_opennebula_migration/">The Register</a> today, Beeks Group, a cloud operator headquartered in the United Kingdom, has moved most of its 20,000-plus virtual machines (VMs) off VMware and to OpenNebula, an open source cloud and edge computing platform. Beeks Group sells virtual private servers and bare metal servers to financial service providers. It still has some VMware VMs, but “the majority” of its machines are currently on OpenNebula, The Register reported.</p>
<p>Beeks’ head of production management, Matthew Cretney, said that one of the reasons for Beeks' migration was a VMware bill for “10 times the sum it previously paid for software licenses,” per The Register.</p>
<p>According to Beeks, OpenNebula has enabled the company to dedicate more of its 3,000 bare metal server fleet to client loads instead of to VM management, as it had to with VMware. With OpenNebula purportedly requiring less management overhead, Beeks is reporting a 200 percent increase in VM efficiency since it now has more VMs on each server.</p>
<p>Beeks also pointed to customers viewing VMware as non-essential and a decline in VMware support services and innovation as drivers for it migrating from VMware.</p>
<p>Broadcom didn't respond to Ars Technica's request for comment.</p>
<h2>Broadcom loses VMware customers</h2>
<p>Broadcom will likely continue seeing some of VMware's older customers decrease or abandon reliance on VMware offerings. But Broadcom has emphasized the financial success it has seen (<a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Broadcom-Inc.-Announces-Third-Quarter-Fiscal-Year-2024-Financial-Results-and-Quarterly-Dividend.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PDF</a>) from its VMware acquisition, suggesting that it will continue with its strategy even at the risk of losing some business.</p>

<p>My name and email address can be found in the VPN client application made by Cisco called AnyConnect.</p>



<p>They are present there as part of the <a href="https://curl.se/docs/copyright.html">curl license</a>, because  this product – like thousands of others – uses libcurl. <a href="https://daniel.haxx.se/my-name-in-products.html">My name appears in many products</a>.</p>



<p>Apparently, people often have problems finding an appropriate address to contact when they have issues with this app. This leads a disproportionate amount of them to send emails to me asking for solutions and fixes to their situations.</p>



<p>So far over the years, close to one hundred different persons have emailed me about problems with Cisco’s AnyConnect. I have not been able to help a single one of them because I know nothing about this application.</p>



<p>The reason my email address is shown there is because I am the lead developer of <a href="https://curl.se/">curl</a>, which is but a small component in this application. I am not associated with Cisco nor this product.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="article_content">
  <div>
    <p>On September 10, 2010, AdGrok founder Antonio Garcia-Martinez was hanging out at co-founder Argyris Zymnis’s San Francisco apartment when he received a call from Rodger Cole. Rodger Cole was a litigator at Fenwick &amp; West, and Fenwick &amp; West was one of the big three Silicon Valley law firms. Getting an unexpected call from your law firm is never a good sign — this was no exception.</p><p>Cole told them they had just been sued by Adchemy, their former employer. This wasn’t entirely a surprise — when Garcia-Martinez and his co-founders Argyris and Matthew McEachen left Adchemy together to start their new company, Adchemy CEO and their former boss Murthy Nukala made it clear that he was not happy with any of them leaving. Adchemy had sent AdGrok legal warnings a few weeks before filing suit in Santa Clara County Court — these warnings were the “sort of menacing recital of employment-agreement restrictions that serves as the warning shot across the bow in corporate litigation.” The warnings led Garcia-Martinez to secure a preemptive relationship with Fenwick, and explained why it was Cole who received the paperwork.</p><p>At the time, AdGrok was tiny — all of three guys and their laptops. The startup had gone through the famous Silicon Valley startup accelerator Y Combinator, and had <em>just</em> presented at ‘Demo Day’ — the end-of-program event that marked graduation. Demo Day was a day-long presentation to invited investors, and it marked the start of external fundraising. To say the lawsuit complicated matters was to put it lightly. Adchemy named each of AdGrok’s co-founders <em>personally </em>in the suit, meaning that if they lost, the founders would be personally liable. The amounts involved in the suit effectively meant that all three co-founders would have been financially ruined.</p><p>The following events, relayed in Garcia-Martinez’s 2016 book <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28259132-chaos-monkeys" rel="nofollow"><em>Chaos Monkeys</em></a>, is only one side of the story; it is not the definitive account of the events that transpired. But that definitive account might not exist: none of the other actors ever commented extensively about the battle.&nbsp;</p><p>That said, the provenance distracts from the purpose of this case. This isn’t really about Garcia-Martinez. Rather, this story is about the actions of Y Combinator, the startup accelerator and investor that Garcia-Martinez allied with, and the moves that its principals executed to protect one of its tiny companies.&nbsp;</p><p>It is also a story of power in Silicon Valley.</p><h2>The Stakes</h2><p>At the time of the lawsuit, Adchemy had raised nearly $60M dollars, and was <em>much</em> larger than AdGrok’s three person team. AdGrok, on the other hand, was struggling to fundraise, and struggling to get the lawyers from Fenwick to defend them in exchange for equity (this was so that they wouldn’t have to pay the lawyers desperately-needed cash). Through some finagling, Garcia-Martinez got legendary Silicon Valley attorney Ted Wang to agree to a $250,000 loan in payment for their services, to be paid either with cash, or with a combination of equity and equity options. Wang was invested in this for more than just financial reasons; to hear Garcia-Martinez tell it, the attorney was also angry that Adchemy had violated Silicon Valley’s unspoken norms. (For the sake of innovation and the good of the overall ecosystem, it was frowned-upon for large companies to attack fly-sized startups).&nbsp;</p><p>Fenwick immediately went to work. Litigator Rodger Cole started “firing sharply worded missives” at Santa Clara County court, rebutting Adchemy’s filed claims, offering to provide externally audited code as proof of innocence, and began the process of hostile depositions (which would suck up time and energy from Adchemy’s executives, including Murthy Nukala himself). But this conventional legal battle was mostly a front: AdGrok could not afford a drawn-out legal entanglement. The key to getting out of the lawsuit was to lean on Adchemy’s weaknesses.</p><p>What weaknesses did Adchemy have? Garcia-Martinez writes that it had two:</p><ol><li><p>It had investors, which sat on its board. This mattered, because board members with voting power could elect to kick out the CEO. Adchemy’s venture capital (VC) investors were from famous firms, and not too difficult to find: they were John Johnston from August Capital and Yogen Dalal from the Mayfield Fund.</p></li><li><p>It had potential business partners — which in Adchemy’s case was doubly important, for the company was floundering. Adchemy had — up to this point — only one major customer for its lead-generation product: Accenture. The entire company was running gigantic losses, with no real chance of turning on real product revenue; Murthy needed to pull in a new business partner to look good in time for Adchemy’s next round of fundraising. Through a stroke of luck, Garcia-Martinez discovered that Murthy was working on a major deal with Microsoft.&nbsp;</p></li></ol><p>If AdGrok could attack either or both weaknesses, Adchemy was likely to back off. The only question was how.</p><h2>The Knife</h2><p>The first angle of attack was with Adchemy’s investors. Here AdGrok was helped by a change in startup funding dynamics that Garcia-Martinez argues had taken place around the start of the 2010s.</p><p>The argument he makes goes something like this: traditionally, the earliest stages of startup fundraising was once done either by using up the entrepreneur’s own savings, or from raised funds from friends or families, or from business ‘angels’ — wealthy individuals who for fun or profit were willing to put their personal money into tiny, nascent companies.&nbsp;</p><p>This changed in the early 2010s, in part due to the emergence of the tech bubble of that decade (propped up, no doubt, by low interest rates). But it was also changed by the emergence of a new generation of rich ex-founders and early-employees — the result of the Google IPO, and also a smattering of startup acquisitions over the course of the late 1990s and 2000s. These newly rich individuals became investors, and some of these folks — such as ex-Googler and prominent angel Chris Sacca — raised small funds in the $20 million to $40 million range. This meant that the angels now had enough firepower to invest $200,000 checks instead of $20,000 checks — and early stage startups could go longer without talking to VC firms.&nbsp;</p><p>This change in capital environment dovetailed with a change in software development during the time. “The emergence of turnkey, on-demand computation like Amazon Web Services, plus off-the-shelf Web-development frameworks like Ruby on Rails, meant that new ideas were easier than ever to test.” Garcia-Martinez writes, “Many entrepreneurs chose to build shovels rather than dig for gold, creating more complex software building blocks to underpin the innovation, such as back-end services like Parse, accelerating the startup explosion in an almost exponential way.”&nbsp;</p><p>All of this meant that by the time AdGrok was formed, it was not shocking for a two-month-old company “with a persuasive CEO” to raise $2 million and have the raise be termed a ‘seed’ round. Nor was it shocking to find these startups hitting its milestones in six months, and raising its next round not too long after the ink had dried on the earlier checks. Garcia-Martinez continues <em>(bold emphasis added)</em>:</p><blockquote><p>With so much money, of all sizes and levels, waiting to invest, the best entrepreneurs had the luxury of choosing investors, rather than vice versa, and many investors found themselves anxiously trying to get into rounds. <strong>Due to contracts stipulating that investors in one round had the right to invest in the next, as well as personal ties between investors and entrepreneurs, investors getting in on oversubscribed A rounds had to be there in the seed round to earn that place. And that was true going up the various funding levels</strong>. That means VCs who would formerly say “Get back to me when you’re raising a series A or B, kid” were basically blocked from popular companies by investors who had nurtured and supported the company since it had been two guys in a trashy office. Heavyweight funds like Mayfield and August knew this, and started doing seed investing, not to own some little piece of a company (they could write small checks all day and still not invest their entire funds) but merely as an option on the real rounds down the road.</p></blockquote><p>This change in dynamic meant that Y Combinator had a unique position in the Silicon Valley ecosystem. Garcia-Martinez continues <em>(again, bold emphasis added)</em>:</p><blockquote><p>… in the day-to-day, the lifeblood of a VC wasn’t money, it was deal flow. Getting a first look at a potential Uber or Airbnb is what distinguishes a first-class VC from an also-ran. <strong>Given Y Combinator’s immense success in drawing the best entrepreneurs, it had a quasi-stranglehold on the best early-stage deal flow in the Valley. And since early-stage deal flow today translated into later-stage deal flow tomorrow, via the follow-on investing phenomena described, Y Combinator was the gatekeeper to the best present and future deals in the Valley</strong>. Like control of the water supply in some arid agricultural region, whoever had the most upstream control of the water sluice controlled everything else—which is what Y Combinator’s Demo Day represented. Thus, powerful and haughty VCs who wanted to attend Y Combinator’s showcase pitch event had to kneel and kowtow to a sandal-wearing bear of a man with a distaste for bullshit and a flair for the written word. That man was Paul Graham, without question the canniest tech investor in human history. And it was to Paul Graham we first turned with our existential problem in those desperate days.</p><p>(...) It was all the more impressive because I had miscast PG as a sort of avuncular, academic presence who dabbled in dense essays about startups, hosted founder dinners, and wrote a few checks. Nothing could be further from the truth. Y Combinator was the sort of unforgiving power player that remembered the names of investors who had crossed portfolio companies in the past, or who had disseminated unflattering portraits of YC, and blacklisted them from any YC dealings, or from the minds of YC founders. This was done with little thought of the size of their funds or their influence in the Valley, leaving more than one self-important VC sputtering at a dressing-down, or left out of a round because the company’s founders had gotten a warning from PG.</p><p>The harsh reality is this: to have influence in the world, you need to be willing and able to reward your friends and punish your enemies.</p></blockquote><p>When Graham first learnt of the lawsuit, he emailed Murthy to discuss the matter. Murthy was polite and deferential, but did not budge on his position. The lawsuit was still on.</p><p>Undeterred, Graham emailed Garcia-Martinez: “Come meet me at home to discuss this on Saturday. Come alone, don’t bring the others, and try to keep them out of it.” (Graham’s goal: to spare AdGrok’s other co-founders from the drama, so that they could continue building whilst the lawsuit resolved itself).</p><p>And so Garcia-Martinez arrived at PG’s house in Old Palo Alto.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>PG shared his anti-Adchemy game plan. In a nutshell: YC would anathematize Adchemy’s VCs, and declare that they’d never do business with YC again unless they straightened this out. Knowing PG, not only would they be disinvited from Demo Day, but PG would probably also steer companies to take money from other funds instead. Given that many if not most YC funding rounds were oversubscribed with investors, an excommunicated investor could be excluded without damaging the fund-raising company at all. At the end of the day, who really gave a shit if the check came from August versus Sequoia? That money was just as green either way. That meant that those funds would start losing YC deals wholesale to their competitors, and, as we reviewed earlier, getting locked out in the early rounds likely meant the same in the even juicier later ones. PG was about to flush a whole chunk of their deal flow down the toilet, just like that.</p><p>I smiled, imagining the sputtering fits pitched by the partners over at Mayfield and August when PG read them the riot act. YC was actually willing to sever ties with some of the most illustrious names in Valley investing over the piss squirt that was AdGrok. It may seem like nothing to you, reader, who maybe inhabits a normal realm of twenty-first-century economic life where things like tit-for-tat reciprocity enforce social codes. But in the passive-aggressive popularity contest that is Silicon Valley, someone actually going to bat for you—really going to bat, like telling important people to go fuck themselves—that’s rarer and more short-lived than a snowflake in a bonfire.</p><p>I thanked PG profusely, and then he padded back into the kitchen for his lunch.</p></blockquote><p>The next weakness was Adchemy’s big deal with Microsoft. Here Garcia-Martinez turned to (then) fellow YC founder and mentor, Sam Altman. </p><blockquote><p>[In 2016, when the book was published] Sam Altman is the current head of Y Combinator, and the person whom Paul Graham has entrusted with transforming his brainchild into a long-lived and scalable institution. In 2010, he was CEO and founder of Loopt, a company that had pioneered the location-check-in product that Foursquare would later eclipse (only to itself stumble), and which Facebook eventually worked into its product.</p><p>At the time, though, Loopt was still a location player, and Sam would take an hour out of his busy week, usually late afternoon on a Friday, to field whatever questions I had, no agenda required. The boys came along for the first session, and never again. I think they were scared of him, and with good reason. In one of PG’s essays on desirable founder qualities, he had this to say about Sam: “You could parachute him into an island full of cannibals and come back in five years and he’d be the king.”</p><p>I believed it, as did the boys. His official AdGrok nickname was “Manson Lamps,” after Tony Soprano’s psychotic rival, who possessed an intense and unsettling stare. This was a flip and admittedly unfair comparison; Sam never proved himself anything other than a capable operator and loyal friend to YC companies.</p></blockquote><p>‘Sama’, as Altman was widely known, was a well-connected node in Silicon Valley: “you know him, and you’re not more than two hops from anybody that matters.” Garcia-Martinez emailed Sama to ask if he knew anyone on the Microsoft deal team with Adchemy, explaining, solicitously, what Murthy was attempting to do to AdGrok. Sama called to clarify. Garcia-Martinez describes what happened next:</p><blockquote><p>Sam Altman assured me he’d try to do the best he could, and promptly cut off the call.</p><p>A week went by. Driving on the 280, I saw his number flash on my phone and pulled over; Sam Altman cannot be dealt with at eighty miles per hour.</p><p>“So I talked to [name redacted], who is Adchemy’s business-development contact at Microsoft. He assures me he brought up the AdGrok issue in one of their meetings with Adchemy. He stated it was going to be problematic if Adchemy was embroiled in litigation while discussing the Microsoft deal.”</p><p>I almost dropped my phone. This was precisely the decapitated horse’s head in Murthy’s bed that we needed. Murthy, with his back against the wall, running short of cash and with no salable product even remotely on the horizon, needed both the accounting and the marketing win of a big infusion of Microsoft money. Weasel that he was, Murthy had an overriding sense of self-preservation, and was still rational enough to realize that destroying AdGrok was not worth destroying Adchemy in the process. If indeed Microsoft BD had raised a flag about AdGrok, there’s no way Adchemy could continue the suit. It would be suicidal.</p><p>“Sam, I don’t know how to thank you for this.”</p><p>“No problem.”</p><p><em>Click.</em></p></blockquote><h2>The Resolution</h2><p>Garcia-Martinez did not have eyes everywhere, of course. Much later, he learnt that PG’s pressure on Adchemy’s investors was working:</p><blockquote><p>One of our investor friends had visited Mayfield Capital on unrelated business. Given the open nature of most VC offices, with all conference rooms and partner spaces facing some airy, sunny central area, he could see that Yogen Dalal, the managing partner for the Adchemy investment and Silicon Valley notable, was in a conference room having what appeared to be a strained conversation with Murthy. Board meetings or advisory sessions (not that Murthy took advice from anyone) should have taken place at Adchemy, not Mayfield, at that stage. That, plus the timing, signaled that this conversation was likely about AdGrok. It seemed that PG had delivered, and Adchemy’s investors had started putting the squeeze on Murthy, using their moral (not to mention financial) suasion to get Adchemy to retire the suit.</p></blockquote><p>In late October Adchemy’s tone changed abruptly: where before they were menacing, now they were conciliatory. AdGrok received an offer to dismiss the suit. By February the whole ordeal was over, but for the lawyer’s fees. The three co-founders signed some token agreements, and sent Fenwick a copy of their code for safekeeping (they encrypted the zip archive; so confident were they that nobody would even bother to check).</p><p>AdGrok had won.</p><p>But the episode was not without cost. A few years later, on the event of Adchemy’s death in 2014, Garcia-Martinez would <a href="https://priceonomics.com/the-time-my-startup-got-sued/" rel="nofollow">post on Facebook</a>:</p><blockquote><p>Through the most dogged persistence, we managed to raise a seed round in the teeth of a bitter lawsuit, and continued to fund operations. But the damage had been done. My co-founders and I were tired of the fight, and the startup adventure for us had been a yearlong, unremitting existential battle that had subsumed whatever product vision we had. The company sold to Twitter in May 2011 and the product disappeared. In a way, Murthy won in the end.</p></blockquote><p>After raising around $120 million in funding, Adchemy was bought by Walmart Labs for an alleged <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/document-from-walmart-adchemy-acquisition-shows-top-managers-got-rich-2014-5" rel="nofollow">$30-$40 million</a> — a “fire-sale ‘acquisition’”. Many employees who purchased stock in the company lost their savings, and the investors lost most if not all of their capital. Murthy Nukala, on the other hand, managed to negotiate a <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/document-from-walmart-adchemy-acquisition-shows-top-managers-got-rich-2014-5" rel="nofollow">$2.4 million golden parachute deal</a> for himself, and various other amounts for a small group of Adchemy executives. All of those deals were multiples of their salaries.</p><p>If the <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/document-from-walmart-adchemy-acquisition-shows-top-managers-got-rich-2014-5" rel="nofollow">Business Insider article</a> reporting this arrangement is to be believed, Murthy walked away rich, while stiffing his employees and investors in the back.&nbsp;</p><p>To our knowledge, Garcia-Martinez never crossed paths with Nukala again.</p><h2>Sources</h2><ol><li><p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28259132-chaos-monkeys" rel="nofollow"><em>Chaos Monkeys: Obscene Fortune and Random Failure</em></a><em>, by Antonia Garcia-Martinez&nbsp;</em></p></li><li><p><a href="https://priceonomics.com/the-time-my-startup-got-sued/" rel="nofollow">The Time My Startup Got Sued</a> (<a href="https://archive.is/8kErI" rel="nofollow">archive.is backup</a>)</p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/document-from-walmart-adchemy-acquisition-shows-top-managers-got-rich-2014-5" rel="nofollow">https://www.businessinsider.com/document-from-walmart-adchemy-acquisition-shows-top-managers-got-rich-2014-5</a> (<a href="https://archive.is/qCj15" rel="nofollow">archive.is backup</a>)</p></li></ol>

<p>GOG's version goes a bit beyond the classic versions that were on sale on Blizzard.net. Beyond the broad promise that "this is the best version of this game you can buy on any PC platform," GOG has made specific tweaks to the networking code for <em>Warcraft I</em>&nbsp;and fixed up the DirectX wrapper for&nbsp;<em>Warcraft II</em> to improve its scaling on modern monitor resolutions.</p>
<p>It's quite a novel commitment, keeping non-revenue-generating games playable for buyers, even after a publisher no longer makes them available for sale. The&nbsp;Warcraft titles certainly won't be the only games for which publisher enthusiasm lags behind GOG and its classic gamers.</p>
<p>As noted at the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/11/gogs-preservation-program-is-the-drm-free-store-refocusing-on-the-classics/">Preservation Program's launch</a>, for some titles, GOG does not have the rights to modify a game's build, and only its original developers can do so. So if GOG can't make it work in, say, <a href="https://www.dosbox.com/">DOSBox</a>, extraordinary efforts may be required.</p>

<p>Beyond being tied to Blizzard's Battle.net service in perpetuity, there are other reasons&nbsp;<em>Warcraft </em>fans might want to hold onto the originals. Blizzard's 2020 release of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/01/warcraft-iii-reforged-not-the-flavor-of-chaos-we-were-hoping-for/"><em>Warcraft III Reforged</em></a> was widely panned as uneven, unfinished, and in some ways unfair, as it, too, removed the original&nbsp;<em>Warcraft III </em>from stores.&nbsp;<em>Reforged</em> was still in rough shape a year later, leading <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/01/warcraft-iii-reforged-tops-our-list-of-2020s-most-disappointing-video-games/">Ars' list of 2020's most disappointing games</a>. A 2.0 update promised a total reboot, but fans remain torn on the new art styles and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/blizzard-says-warcraft-3-reforged-20-is-a-fresh-start-but-fans-remain-unconvinced-after-rocky-launch">are somewhat wary</a>.</p>
<p>Then again, you can now select more units in the first two&nbsp;<em>Warcraft</em> games' remasters, and you get "numerous visual updates for the UI."</p>

            <pubDate>Tue, 03 Dec 2024 04:39:56 GMT</pubDate>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2024/raspberry-pi-boosts-pi-5-performance-sdram-tuning">https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2024/raspberry-pi-boosts-pi-5-performance-sdram-tuning</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42303111">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><strong>tl;dr</strong> Raspberry Pi engineers tweaked SDRAM timings and other memory settings on the Pi, resulting in a 10-20% speed boost at the default 2.4 GHz clock. I of course had to test overclocking, which got me a <em>32%</em> speedup at 3.2 GHz! Changes may roll out in a firmware update for all Pi 5 and Pi 4 users soon.</p>

<p><img width="700" height="auto" src="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/sites/default/files/images/pi-5-overclock-desk-mess.jpeg" alt="Raspberry Pi 5 with SDRAM tweaks applied on desk"></p>

<p>My quest for the <a href="https://browser.geekbench.com/v6/cpu/search?dir=desc&amp;q=Raspberry+Pi+5+Model+B&amp;sort=score">world record Geekbench 6 score on a Pi 5</a> continues, as a couple months ago <a href="https://www.martinrowan.co.uk/2024/09/raspberry-pi-5-overclocking-to-beat-geekbench-record/">Martin Rowan</a> used cooling and <a href="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2024/numa-emulation-speeds-pi-5-and-other-improvements">NUMA emulation tricks</a> to beat my then-record score.</p>

<p>But Raspberry Pi's engineers are <a href="https://forums.raspberrypi.com/viewtopic.php?t=378276">tweaking memory timings even further</a>. They've talked to Micron and implemented a number of small tweaks that—along with NUMA emulation—really add up to a performance improvement for multi-core workloads. And even a little improvement for single-core!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The sdram refresh interval is currently using the default data sheet settings. You can actually monitor the temperature of the sdram and it reports if refresh at half or quarter the rate can be done. That allows the overhead due to refresh to be reduced by a half or a quarter which does improve benchmark results.</p>
  
  <p>We got in contact with Micron, and there is good news. They have said they actually test their 8GB sdram with the 4GB refresh rate timing (rather than the slower jedec timings), and so it was be safe to run the 8GB parts with 4GB timing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The tweaks can also give the Pi 4 a boost, but the Pi 5 improves more dramatically:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Pi 5 also has faster sdram, better access to sdram (i.e. wider/faster internal buses), so generally the improvements with NUMA are greater.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>SDRAM Tweaks</h2>

<p>To get the latest RAM speedups <em>for now</em> (this may be default soon):</p>

<ol>
<li>Update the Pi's firmware to the latest version: <code>sudo rpi-update</code> (confirm with <code>Y</code>)</li>
<li>Edit the bootloader config: <code>sudo rpi-eeprom-config -e</code></li>
<li>Add the configuration <code>SDRAM_BANKLOW=1</code> (for Pi 5... for Pi 4, use <code>3</code>)</li>
<li>Reboot</li>
</ol>

<h2>NUMA Emulation</h2>

<p>Since my <a href="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2024/numa-emulation-speeds-pi-5-and-other-improvements">first post on NUMA emulation on the Pi 5</a>, the patches required have been added to Raspberry Pi's OS kernel.</p>

<p>So to use NUMA, all you have to do is make sure you're on the latest Pi OS (e.g. <code>sudo apt full-upgrade</code>).</p>

<p>To check if NUMA emulation is working, run <code>dmesg | grep NUMA</code> and make sure it says something like <code>mempolicy: NUMA default policy overridden to 'interleave:0-7'</code>. You can tweak the settings if you want by adding <code>numa=fake=[n]</code> inside <code>/boot/firmware/cmdline.txt</code>, though the defaults <em>should</em> be appropriate for most use cases.</p>

<h2>Overclocking</h2>

<p>Following my own guide for <a href="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2023/overclocking-and-underclocking-raspberry-pi-5">overclocking the Pi 5</a>, I set the following inside <code>/boot/firmware/config.txt</code>:</p>

<pre><code>over_voltage_delta=72000
arm_freq=3200

<p>After rebooting, I set the fan to 100%, <a href="https://github.com/geerlingguy/pi-overvolt">hacked the kernel with my pi-overvolt project</a> to boost the core voltage, and set the scaling governor to <code>performance</code>:</p>

<pre><code>$ pinctrl FAN_PWM op dl
$ cd pi-overvolt &amp;&amp; sudo ./removelimit &amp;&amp; vcgencmd cache_flush
$ echo performance | sudo tee /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu*/cpufreq/scaling_governor

<h2>Geekbench World Record, Part 2</h2>

<p>With just the default firmware changes, my Geekbench scores already increase quite a bit (+8% single, +18% multi). Adding a 3.2 GHz overclock on top (using my <a href="https://github.com/geerlingguy/pi-overvolt">pi-overvolt</a> hack to boost voltages), those increases go to +32% single, +31% multi, resulting in yet <a href="https://browser.geekbench.com/v6/cpu/search?dir=desc&amp;q=Raspberry+Pi+5+Model+B&amp;sort=score">another world-record Geekbench 6 score</a>!</p>

<p>I also ran these tests with just an <a href="https://amzn.to/3OAkUo7">Argon THRML 30-AC Active Cooler</a>. To try to keep temps under control, I boosted the fan speed to 100%: <code>pinctrl FAN_PWM op dl</code>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>A word on overclocking</strong>: I've now overclocked around 20 Pi 5s, and found most to be capable of 2.6 or 2.8 GHz, and many (about half) to be capable of 3.0 GHz. But beyond that, very few can hit 3.1 GHz or beyond. More exotic overclocking (to 3.4 or 3.5 GHz) is much more difficult, and I've only had <em>one</em> Pi 5 that even boots reliably at those speeds, with more extensive cooling. RAM timings were already not happy at those speeds, and with the extra SDRAM tweaks, I imagine extreme overclocking will be even <em>more</em> unstable.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>These optimizations could become default soon. I started looking into this after someone on Twitter mentioned seeing <a href="https://browser.geekbench.com/search?page=2&amp;q=raspberry+500">Pi 500 Geekbench results</a> starting in September—all seemingly with these tweaks in place already!</p>

<p>Memory speed has been a thorn in the Pi 5's side in comparison to many RK3588 boards. It's nice to see the SDRAM tweaks giving it a significant speed boost, over a year post-launch.</p>

<p>And eagle-eyed readers may note I only overclocked to 3.2 GHz instead of 3.4 GHz this time. I'll leave the door open for someone else to combine all the above tricks to hit another new WR score ;)</p></div></div>]]></description>

                                        <p>MEXICO CITY (AP) — It’s been called the closest the world has ever come to a vaccine against the <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/hub/hiv-and-aids">AIDS</a></span> virus.</p><p>The <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/africa-aids-hiv-infection-prevention-shot-sunlenca-a94b83717f5b61987822335e11398428">twice-yearly shot</a></span> was 100% effective in preventing HIV infections in a study of women, and results published Wednesday show it worked nearly as well in men.</p><p>Drugmaker <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://www.gilead.com/news/news-details/2024/gilead-signs-royalty-free-voluntary-licensing-agreements-with-six-generic-manufacturers-to-increase-access-to-lenacapavir-for-hiv-prevention-in-high-incidence-resource-limited-countries" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gilead</a></span> said it will allow cheap, generic versions to be sold in 120 poor countries with high HIV rates — mostly in Africa, Southeast Asia and the Caribbean. But it has excluded nearly all of <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/hiv-latino-hispanic-treatment-prevention-aids-ca5f73b064e5ed491ee0315dd60d69d1">Latin America</a></span>, where rates are far lower but increasing, sparking concern the world is missing a critical opportunity to stop the disease.</p><p>“This is so far superior to any other prevention method we have, that it’s unprecedented,” said Winnie Byanyima, executive director of UNAIDS. She credited Gilead for developing the drug, but said the world’s ability to stop AIDS hinges on its use in at-risk countries.</p>
    

<p>In a <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://rightspath.unaids.org/?utm_source=UNAIDS%20Newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=e05145dfc2-20241126_world-aids-day-report&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_e7a6256e25-e05145dfc2-114159125" target="_blank" rel="noopener">report</a></span> issued to mark World AIDS Day on Sunday, UNAIDS said that the number of AIDS death last year — an estimated 630,000 — was at its lowest since peaking in 2004, suggesting the world is now at “a historic crossroads” and has a chance to end the epidemic. </p>



<p>The drug called lenacapavir is already sold under the brand name Sunlenca to treat HIV infections in the U.S., Canada, Europe and elsewhere. The company plans to seek authorization soon for the drug to be used for HIV prevention.</p><p>While there are other ways to guard against infection, like condoms, <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/daily-hiv-prevention-pill-urged-for-healthy-people-at-risk-9d45991f257b4800a12e1c32a3b0f308">daily pills</a></span>, <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/hiv-africa-women-vaginal-ring-3e9a583a1d0b5f7863a9795ec4d2ff4f">vaginal rings</a></span> and bi-monthly shots, experts say the Gilead twice-yearly shots would be particularly useful for marginalized people often fearful of seeking care, including gay men, sex workers and young women. </p>
    
    
    
<p>“It would be a miracle for these groups because it means they just have to show up twice a year at a clinic and then they’re protected,” said UNAIDS’ Byanyima. </p><p>Such was the case for Luis Ruvalcaba, a 32-year-old man in Guadalajara, Mexico, who participated in the latest published study. He said he was afraid to ask for the daily prevention pills provided by the government, fearing he would be discriminated against as a gay man. Because he took part in the study, he’ll continue to receive the shots for at least another year.</p>
    

<p>“In Latin American countries, there is still a lot of stigma, patients are ashamed to ask for the pills,” said Dr. Alma Minerva Pérez, who recruited and enrolled a dozen study volunteers at a private research center in Guadalajara.</p><p>How widely available the shots will be in Mexico through the country’s health care system isn’t yet known. Health officials declined to comment on any plans to buy them for its citizens; daily pills to prevent HIV were made freely available via the country’s public health system in 2021. </p><p>“If the possibility of using generics has opened, I have faith that Mexico can join,” said Pérez.</p><p>Byanyima said other countries besides Mexico that took part in the research were also excluded from the generics deal, including Brazil, Peru and Argentina. “To now deny them that drug is unconscionable.” she said.</p>
    

<p>In a statement, Gilead said it has “an ongoing commitment to helping enable access to HIV prevention and treatment options where the need is the greatest.” Among the 120 countries eligible for generic version are 18 mostly African countries that comprise 70% of the world’s HIV burden. </p><p> The drugmaker said it is also working on establishing “fast, efficient pathways to reach all people who need or want lenacapavir for HIV prevention.”</p><p>On Thursday, 15 advocacy groups in Peru, Argentina, Ecuador, Chile, Guatemala and Colombia wrote to Gilead, asking for the generic version to be made available in Latin America, citing the “alarming” inequity in access to new HIV prevention tools while infection rates were rising. </p><p>While countries including Norway, France, Spain and the U.S. have paid more than $40,000 per year for Sunlenca, experts have calculated it could be produced for as little as $40 per treatment once generic production expands to cover 10 million people. </p><p>Dr. Chris Beyrer, director of the Global Health Institute at Duke University, said it will be enormously useful to have the Gilead shots available in the hardest-hit countries in Africa and Asia. But he said the rising HIV rates among groups including gay men and transgender populations constituted “a public health emergency” in Latin America.</p>
    

<p>Hannya Danielle Torres, a 30-year-old trans woman and artist who was also in the study in Mexico, said she hoped the government would find a way to provide the shots. “Mexico may have some of the richest people in the world but it also has some of the most vulnerable people living in extreme poverty and violence,” Torres said. </p><p>Another drugmaker, Viiv Healthcare, also left out most of Latin America when it allowed generics of its HIV prevention shot in about 90 countries. Sold as Apretude, the bi-monthly shots are about 80% to 90% effective in preventing HIV. They cost about $1,500 a year in middle-income countries, beyond what most can afford to pay.</p>
    

<p>Asia Russell, executive director of the advocacy group Health Gap, said that with more than 1 million new HIV infections globally every year, established prevention methods are not enough. She urged countries like Brazil and Mexico to issue “compulsory licenses,” a mechanism where countries suspend patents in a health crisis.</p><p>It’s a strategy some countries embraced for previous HIV treatments, including in the late 1990s and 2000s when AIDS drugs were first discovered. More recently, <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/bedaquiline-dolutegravir-tuberculosis-hiv-south-africa-0f6de15ea57279b699c147c015b23c02">Colombia</a></span> issued its first-ever compulsory license for the key HIV treatment Tivicay in April, without permission from its drugmaker, Viiv. </p><p>Dr. Salim Abdool Karim, an AIDS expert at South Africa’s University of KwaZulu-Natal, said he had never seen a drug that appeared to be as effective as the Gilead shot in preventing HIV. </p><p> “The missing piece in the puzzle now is how we get it to everyone who needs it,” he said.</p><h2>___</h2><p>Cheng reported from London. </p><h2>___</h2><p>The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Science and Educational Media Group.

But in 2021 we had recently moved to Denmark, so I had no professional network and didn’t speak the language, and Rebecka had just been born, and we needed the money—so I couldn’t be picky.</p><p>I also felt that the place had, as real estate agents say, “good bones”: it was beautiful, they had 6 exhibition halls, and it was a 25-minute bike ride from home.</p><p>For most of my career, I have worked short gigs or at projects that I started—the longest stretch I’ve been employed was, I think, 4 months at a bio lab when I was 19. No, that’s not right; I worked 8 months in a school when I was going down a rabbit hole about education in 2016/17. My working model has been that being employed kind of sucks. But this time, since I knew I couldn’t afford to quit anytime soon with the baby and all, I figured I could try treating it like one of my projects. So instead of selling coffee, I looked into how we could streamline the café and the cash register so that the volunteers who help out at the gallery felt comfortable doing my job, then I made myself a small office where I sat down to analyze the business and figure out how to improve it. You can imagine how popular this was. I had to backtrack for a few months after the board told me to get back to the café. And this was a good lesson for someone who is used to being self-employed: at an institution, you can’t just do what is best, you also have to build trust and coordinate with others so you are on the same page. This, however, doesn’t mean that you should abdicate your judgment and get in line.</p><p><span>I like the approach </span><a href="https://arc.net/l/quote/qiikxitd" rel="">Sholto Douglas expressed</a><span> in his interview with Dwarkesh Patel:</span></p><blockquote><p>If I’m trying to write some code and something isn't working, even if it’s in another part of the code base, I’ll often just go in and fix that thing or at least hack it together to be able to get results. [...] I think that's arguably the most important quality in almost anything. It's just pursuing it to the end of the earth. Whatever you need to do to make it happen, you'll make it happen. [...] I’m just going to vertically solve the entire thing. And that turns out to be remarkably effective.</p></blockquote><p><span>Ie. you don’t say, “This is my job and that thing is outside my area”—no, if the value you are trying to promote requires you to go outside your role and learn new skills and politick to get the authority to go ahead: then that </span><em>is</em><span> your job.</span></p><p>I’m not at the level of Sholto Douglas, but I figured I could at least try. So I made an agreement with my boss, who liked me, that she would let me sit in on the board meetings, and I began mapping out who was who and what they wanted and made sure to talk to all stakeholders when they passed through the gallery, and in 6 months I had a good enough model of what their values and goals were so I could align myself to the mission and make legible to them what I was doing. As my boss learned to trust me, she began to say that my role was “do whatever you think is right,” and eventually, after about a year, “. . . and you work whenever you feel like it.” (It helped that the year I started was the inflection point when the revenue, which had been shrinking or muddling for 5 years, began growing again; this wasn’t all my work, but it made my boss trust me.)</p><p>For the last 2.5 years I’ve mostly set my own agenda, and I’ve worked in uneven sprints and bursts, sometimes doing 70-hour weeks (my contract was 20 hours per week), and sometimes staying home for 10 days to write essays. This bursty way of working fits my temperament well, and I’ve genuinely loved this job in a way I didn’t think I’d ever love a job.</p><p>A bunch of my friends envied my role. But no one else applied.</p><p>I’ve worked with . . . ~150 artists from 33 countries. Quite a few of them have been the way artists are typically portrayed: self-centered, hard to work with, a little crazy. These were the amateurs. The best artists I’ve worked with, for example A and B, a husband and wife duo, were not at all like that. Let me give an example.</p><p>My boss fundraised and sold a large public sculpture A and B had made earlier this year. The day before we were going to install it, A and B came to the gallery and explained that they had found a better electronic component. Not that the old one was bad—it was the best one they had been able to find when they originally made the sculpture. But the new one was a little bit better. So then they proceeded to dismantle the entire sculpture, get their welding kit, and work for seven hours improving the sculpture. Notice three things:</p><ol><li><p>A and B had already been paid and the buyer was more than happy.</p></li><li><p>A and B didn’t tell the customer that they had spent 14 man hours improving it; it was just something they did because it was right, nothing they wanted credit for.</p></li><li><p>A and B have earned enough money from their New York gallerist to retire, but they’d rather use that money to make better art.</p></li></ol><p>It is this kind of attitude that makes someone succeed at their level, as far as I can tell. They are always pushing themselves to the edge, which makes them grow, and they are so selfless and pleasant to work with that you just want to do more stuff with them all the time. And you need that attitude to do anything ambitious: you need support, and funding, and goodwill, and you don’t get that by being disorganized or self-centered. Maybe at the very top of the art world artists can afford to be annoying again, I don’t know.</p><p>This is sort of a corollary to the above. When we work with artists like A and B, they answer their emails within the hour and they never complain when we can’t meet an expectation they have and when they come in they work hard and fast and deliver a great exhibition in a few hours. Certain other artists are more like, “oh, I don’t know what I want to do . . .” “can you get me more funding?” “that scratch on the floor makes my art look bad, you need to fix it” “can you build a wall there?” “no that wall wasn’t right after all, can you take it down” and after weeks of this you end up with something mediocre.</p><p>I got to run something like an experiment on my capacity to predict which exhibitions would end up great, and which would be a waste of time. It was easy. As soon as someone was slow at answering their email, or complained, or wanted us to be their therapist as they worked through the creative worries, I would tell my boss, “I think we should cancel this.” And my boss—whose strength and weakness is that she thinks the best of people and makes everyone feel held—would say, “Ah, but they are just a bit sloppy with email” “if we just fix this thing it will be fine. . .”&nbsp;</p><p>I was right every time; it ended in pain.</p><p>And this is quite nice actually: it means it doesn’t take some Tyler Cowen-level taste in talent to figure out who will do good work. I had limited experience with artists. But it turns out that if you are just a bit patient and say, “No, I’m not going to work with anyone who is demanding or confused or slow at answering their email”—then you are basically home.</p><p>And when you work like that, when you are patient for the right opportunities, you don’t have to do a lot of work at all. You just go around talking to people until you find a good match...and then the work sort of does itself with little effort. Very convenient!</p><p>It is not that I’m some grumpy person who thinks that some people are great and others aren’t, in some predetermined way—I think you can to a large extent decide which kind you want to be. But if someone else isn’t measuring up, I have no idea how to convince them to do so. So I look for people who have already decided.</p><p>An art gallery—especially a co-op art gallery with a non-profit board like the one I worked at—is a strange kind of business. The aim is not to earn money but to create beauty and strengthen the community and all of these other hard-to-measure things. Because of this, the gallery attracted people who prefer to think about higher values, rather than stuff like economic growth, which was seen as icky.</p><p>I am very much in that direction myself; I found it, for example, almost shameful to turn on paid subscriptions on my blog.</p><p>But something that became clear to me at the gallery, and from working with people like A and B who did art at a high level, is that you simply can’t afford to do good stuff if you don’t figure out the funding part.</p><p>Our elevator at the gallery, for example, was falling apart, and it would be illegal for us to keep open without one, which meant that we would be unable to do anything if we couldn’t get the money for the elevator—no community, no art, no nothing. My first boss and the board had not realized this, and when I pointed this out, there was a vague feeling that if this happened “the municipality should pay for it because art is so important.”</p><p><span>But the municipality on our island is in bad economic shape, and is considering cutting back on care for the elderly to balance their budget—so, to me, it feels unethical to angle for more money for the arts.</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-1-151598106" href="https://www.henrikkarlsson.xyz/p/art-gallery#footnote-1-151598106" target="_self" rel="">1</a></span><span> This is the kind of topic that makes me pound the table in fervor as I talk about it; I have often given this sermon to art students. We have a duty to our values and a duty to our community, and we can’t shy away from that because it feels hard, or because we want to be seen in a certain way, and then expect others to bail us out! We should shoulder our responsibility and figure out a way to make the art (or whatever we value) so attractive and meaningful that people feel good about funding it by becoming members or buying art or coffee or whatever.</span></p><p>If we want to make the world a better place, we can’t just think about the lofty stuff: we have to get our hands dirty and make sure the economic engine works.</p><p>It is not unreasonable to feel icky about the business side of art because the incentives of the market (and the grantmakers . . .) often really do pull in directions that actively threaten the very values that we care about. Yes.</p><p>But that is only a rough approximation of the truth.</p><p>If you take the time to actually bang your head against reality and figure out how to fund something, you will discover that there are places in the incentive landscape where the incentives (which are really the desires and needs of other human beings) align with your ineffable values. If you want to bring as much of what you have to give into the world, it is our job to figure out where in the incentive landscape that is.</p><p>I think of it as two vector fields:</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F56929dd5-9453-4136-b3fb-b60d0c179e7e_702x1075.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F56929dd5-9453-4136-b3fb-b60d0c179e7e_702x1075.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F56929dd5-9453-4136-b3fb-b60d0c179e7e_702x1075.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F56929dd5-9453-4136-b3fb-b60d0c179e7e_702x1075.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F56929dd5-9453-4136-b3fb-b60d0c179e7e_702x1075.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F56929dd5-9453-4136-b3fb-b60d0c179e7e_702x1075.jpeg" width="702" height="1075" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/56929dd5-9453-4136-b3fb-b60d0c179e7e_702x1075.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1075,&quot;width&quot;:702,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F56929dd5-9453-4136-b3fb-b60d0c179e7e_702x1075.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F56929dd5-9453-4136-b3fb-b60d0c179e7e_702x1075.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F56929dd5-9453-4136-b3fb-b60d0c179e7e_702x1075.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F56929dd5-9453-4136-b3fb-b60d0c179e7e_702x1075.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>The first vector field is our artistic impulses, and ethics, and curiosity, and so on—all the things that we want to express in our lives (or in our institutions).

I guess it made me feel like I belonged here, and that this country that has given us refuge told us that we were one of them now, that they saw the work we had done to care for this small corner of the whole.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>
          Approx. 15 minutes
        </p><article>
        
          <p>
  The 
  <a href="https://www.erlang.org/">
    Erlang
  </a>&nbsp; programming language is known for three things:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    Concurrency
  </li>
  <li>
    Fault tolerance
  </li>
  <li>
    Distribution
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  The cool thing is that all three of these things are both built into the language/runtime itself, but they're also all more or less "emergent" properties of the underlying design choices that were made when the language was created.
</p>
<h2>
  The Actor Model
</h2>
<p>
  Erlang is based on the Actor Model, which is a model of computation that was first described by 
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Hewitt">
    Carl Hewitt
  </a>&nbsp; in the 1970s.
</p>
<p>
  The Actor Model is a way of thinking about computation that is based on the idea of "actors" that communicate with each other by sending messages.
</p>
<p>
  You can think of an actor as its own little main "thread" of execution, responsible for managing its own state, and communicating with other actors.
</p>
<h3>
  Processes
</h3>
<p>
  In Erlang, actors are implemented as 
  <a href="https://erlang.org/doc/reference_manual/processes.html">
    processes
  </a>&nbsp;. As each process executes, the 
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BEAM_(Erlang_virtual_machine">
    Erlang Virtual Machine
  </a>&nbsp;) is responsible for keeping track of how long each process has been running, and making sure that each process gets a fair share of the CPU.
</p>
<p>
  As described, each process is very lightweight, costing very little in terms of memory to create and run. This means that you can create thousands or even millions of processes in an Erlang system, and the system will still run efficiently.
</p>
<p>
  You can create a new process in Erlang by calling the 
<code>spawn/1</code> function, which takes a single argument: a function that the new process should execute.
</p>
<pre><code>1&gt; spawn(fun() -&gt; io:format("Hello, world!~n") end).
Hello, world!
&lt;0.41.0&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>
  Because each process is scheduled independently by the Erlang Virtual Machine, there isn't a need to worry about locking any kind of main thread:
</p>
<pre><code>1&gt; Loop = fun(F, X) -&gt; F(F, X) end.
#Fun&lt;erl_eval.12.57235823&gt;
2&gt; spawn(fun() -&gt; Loop(Loop, foo) end).
&lt;0.42.0&gt;
% Note the shell is still responsive
3&gt; 1 + 1.
2
</code></pre>
<p>
  In fact, "infinitely looping" functions being spawned as processes is the fundamental way that Erlang programs are written: these long running processes poll for messages, and based on the messages they receive, they decide what to do next.
</p>
<h3>
  Message Passing
</h3>
<p>
  To enable communication between processes, Erlang provides a mechanism called 
  <a href="https://erlang.org/doc/reference_manual/distributed.html#message-passing">
    message passing
  </a>&nbsp;. This is a way for one process to send a message to another process, and for the receiving process to handle the message in some way.
</p>
<p>
  A process can send a message (which can be any piece of data) to another process; additionally, a process can halt its execution and wait for a message to arrive.
</p>
<p>
  Processes each have their own mailbox, which is a queue of messages that have been sent to the process.
</p>
<p>
  When a process receives a message, it can choose to handle the message, or to ignore it.
</p>
<p>
  For example, here's a simple program that sends a message to a process, and then waits for a response:
</p>
<pre><code>-module(example).
-export([start/0, resp/0]).

start() -&gt;
  Pid = spawn(fun resp/0),
  % Send a message to the spawned process
  Pid ! {self(), hello},
  % And wait for a response, which is just a tuple tagged with the spawned process's PID
  % so we can identify which process sent the message
  receive
    {Pid, Response} -&gt; io:format("Received response: ~p~n", [Response])
  end.

% This process just waits for a message, and then sends a response before exiting.
resp() -&gt;
  receive
    {From, hello} -&gt; From ! {self(), world}
  end.
</code></pre>
<p>
  With just these two features, message passing and processes, you have first-class concurrency baked into the language without 
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_coloring">
    function coloring
  </a>&nbsp;.
</p>
<h2>
  Fault Tolerance
</h2>
<p>
  Erlang is also known for its fault tolerance. This is because the Erlang Virtual Machine is designed to be able to handle failures gracefully.
</p>
<p>
  What this means is that the Erlang Virtual Machine and runtime have primitives for:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    Linking processes together.
  </li>
  <li>
    Monitoring processes.
  </li>
</ol>
<h3>
  Linking Processes
</h3>
<p>
  When two processes are linked together, if one of the processes crashes, the other process will also crash. This is a way of ensuring that if one part of your system fails, the rest of the system can be notified and take appropriate action.
</p>
<p>
  You can link two processes together using the 
<code>link/1</code> function, or you can atomically spawn a process and link it to the current process using the 
<code>spawn_link/1</code> function.
</p>
<p>
  When a process crashes, it generates an exit signal, which is sent to all linked processes. This exit signal contains information about why the process crashed, and what the process's PID was.
</p>
<p>
  Like any other message, you can receive and pattern match on exit signals in Erlang:
</p>
<pre><code>1&gt; Pid = spawn_link(fun() -&gt; exit(normal) end).
&lt;0.41.0&gt;
2&gt; receive
..   {'EXIT', Pid, Reason} -&gt; Reason
.. end.
normal
</code></pre>
<p>
  This allows you to write code that can handle failures gracefully, by restarting processes that have crashed, or by shutting down the entire system if a critical process has crashed.
</p>
<h3>
  Monitoring Processes
</h3>
<p>
  In addition to linking processes together, you can also monitor processes. This is a way of being notified when a process crashes, without crashing the monitoring process.
</p>
<p>
  When you monitor a process, you receive a message when the monitored process crashes. This message contains information about why the process crashed, and what the process's PID was.
</p>
<p>
  You can monitor a process using the 
<code>erlang:monitor/2</code> function, which takes two arguments: the type of monitoring you want to do (either 
<code>process</code> or 
<code>port</code>), and the PID of the process you want to monitor.
</p>
<p>
  When a process crashes, it generates an exit signal, which is sent to all monitoring processes. This exit signal contains information about why the process crashed, and what the process's PID was.
</p>
<p>
  This, in tandem with pattern matching on exit signals, allows you to write code that can can monitor, say, worker processes and manage them as needed.
</p>
<h2>
  OTP
</h2>
<p>
  The 
  <a href="https://erlang.org/doc/design_principles/des_princ.html">
    Open Telecom Platform
  </a>&nbsp;(OTP) is a set of libraries and design principles that are built on top of Erlang.
</p>
<p>
  One of the confusing things about OTP is that it's often referred to as a "framework", but it's really more of a set of abstractions that make it easier to write fault-tolerant and scalable systems in Erlang.
</p>
<p>
  Unlike a "framework" in other languages, OTP is bundled with the Erlang runtime itself. OTP very much is Erlang, and Erlang is OTP.
</p>
<p>
  The three main components of OTP are:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <a href="https://erlang.org/doc/design_principles/des_princ.html#behaviours">
      Behaviours
    </a>&nbsp;</li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://erlang.org/doc/design_principles/des_princ.html#supervisors">
      Supervisors
    </a>&nbsp;</li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://erlang.org/doc/design_principles/des_princ.html#gen-servers">
      GenServers
    </a>&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<p>
  Behaviours are a way of defining a set of functions that a module must implement in order to be considered a "behaviour". This is a way of enforcing a contract between modules, and making sure that they all implement the same set of functions.
</p>
<p>
  Supervisors are a way of managing a set of worker processes. A supervisor is responsible for starting, stopping, and restarting worker processes as needed.
</p>
<p>
  GenServers are a way of implementing a server process that can handle requests from clients. A GenServer is a process that runs a loop, waiting for messages from clients, and responding to those messages.
</p>
<p>
  There are additional components of OTP, but day-to-day, these are the three that you'll interact with most often. Some of the other components include:
</p>
<ul>

</ul>
<p>
  By composing these components together, you build systems that are fault-tolerant, scalable, and easy to reason about (within the remit of Erlang applications, at least).
</p>
<h2>
  Distribution
</h2>
<p>
  Having covered the basics of concurrency and fault tolerance, we can now talk about distribution.
</p>
<p>
  Distribution is, as stated, one of the touted benefits of using Erlang. Distribution is the mechanism by which you can run Erlang programs on multiple machines, and have them communicate with each other.
</p>
<p>
  Erlang has built-in support for distribution, but the underlying mechanisms can be swapped out for other implementations. However, the majority of Erlang programs in the wild use the built-in distribution mechanisms, which is what we'll cover here.
</p>
<h3>
  Nodes
</h3>
<p>
  In Erlang, a 
<code>node</code> is a running instance of the Erlang Virtual Machine.
</p>
<p>
  When you start an Erlang program, you start a node. This node is identified by a name, which is a string that is unique to the node. Nodes can have short names, which are just strings, or long names, which are strings that look like email addresses, i.e. 
<code>node@hostname</code>.
</p>
<p>
  When nodes are started, they can connect to each other over a network. This is done using a mechanism called 
  <a href="https://www.erlang.org/docs/26/man/epmd">
    epmd
  </a>&nbsp; which acts a little like a DNS server for Erlang nodes.
</p>
<p>
  When a node starts, it registers itself with 
<code>epmd</code>, and then other nodes can connect to it by looking up its name in 
<code>epmd</code>'s registry.
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    Much of this is pluggable however, i.e. see 
    <a href="https://github.com/tsloughter/epmdless">
      epmdless
    </a>&nbsp;.
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
  You can connect to a remote node using the 
<code>net_kernel:connect_node/1</code> function, which takes the name of the node you want to connect to as an argument; additionally, you can look up a list of all connected nodes using the 
<code>nodes/0</code> function.
</p>
<pre><code>1&gt; net_kernel:connect_node('node@hostname').
true
2&gt; nodes().
['node@hostname']
</code></pre>
<p>
  Note that 
<code>node/0</code> is a built-in function that returns the name of the current node.
</p>
<h3>
  Networking
</h3>
<p>
  Before you can send messages between nodes, you need to set up a network connection between them.
</p>
<p>
  This is done using the 
<code>net_adm:ping/1</code> function, which takes the name of the node you want to ping as an argument.
</p>
<pre><code>% Start nodes
% erl -name node1@hostname
% erl -name node2@hostname
1&gt; net_adm:ping('node2@hostname').
pong
2&gt; nodes().
['node2@hostname']
</code></pre>
<p>
  Before attempting a connection however, each node needs to exchange a 
<code>cookie</code>, this is a shared secret that is used to authenticate connections between nodes.
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    The cookie is stored in a file called 
<code>.erlang.cookie</code> in the user's home directory.
  </p>
  <p>
    
There is also no built-in mechanism for communicating the cookie between nodes, so you'll need to do this manually.
  </p>
</blockquote>
<h3>
  Network Transparency
</h3>
<p>
  One of the cool things about Erlang's distribution is that it's network transparent.
</p>
<p>
  For example, taking the above example of spawning a process, note the format of the returned 
<code>PID</code>:
</p>
<pre><code>1&gt; Pid = spawn(fun() -&gt; io:format("Hello, world!~n") end).
Hello, world!
&lt;0.41.0&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>
  In this example, the returned PID is 
<code>&lt;0.41.0&gt;</code>, which is a reference to a process (that may, or may not still be running).
</p>
<p>
  There are two different types of PIDs in Erlang: local 
<code>PID</code> s and global 
<code>PID</code> s; the former is always in the format 
<code>&lt;0.X.Y&gt;</code>, where 
<code>X</code> and 
<code>Y</code> are different bits identifying the process on the local node.
</p>
<p>
  For global 
<code>PID</code> s, the format is 
<code>&lt; X.Y.Z &gt;</code>, where 
<code>X</code> is the node number, and 
<code>Y</code> and 
<code>Z</code> continue to represent the process's identifier.
</p>
<p>
  This means that you can send messages to processes on other nodes in the same way that you send messages to processes on the local node.
</p>
<pre><code>% assuming we have a remote PID stored in `RemotePid`
1&gt; RemotePid ! {self(), ping}.
{&lt;0.41.0&gt;, ping}
% and then we can receive the message in the same way
2&gt; receive
..   {RemotePid, Response} -&gt; {RemotePid, Response}
.. end.
{&lt;12042.3.0&gt;, pong}
</code></pre>
<p>
  This is an extremely powerful feature of Erlang, as it allows you to write code that is completely agnostic to the location of the processes it's communicating with.
</p>
<h2>
  Distribution Gotchas
</h2>
<p>
  Despite the fact, however, that distribution is one of the much-touted features of Erlang, it is not without its pitfalls.
</p>
<p>
  Compared to the concurrency and fault tolerance features of Erlang, distribution is much more complex, much more difficult to get right, and arguably somewhat half-baked.
</p>
<p>
  Here are some of the main gotchas to be aware of when working with distributed Erlang systems that I've run into in my career.
</p>
<h3>
  Scalability in Large Clusters
</h3>
<p>
  When clustering using Distributed Erlang, the overall cluster forms a mesh network, where each node is connected to every other node in the cluster.
</p>
<p>
  This means that as the number of nodes in the cluster grows, the number of connections that each node needs to maintain also grows. In a system with 
<code>N</code> nodes, each node needs to maintain 
<code>N-1</code> connections to every other node in the cluster.
</p>
<p>
  This means that as the number of nodes in the cluster grows, the number of connections that each node needs to maintain linearly, and the number of connections between nodes in the cluster grows quadratically.
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    Note: the original version of this article mistakenly stated that the number of connections grows exponentially, this is incorrect, and I have since corrected it.
  </p>
  <p>
    
Thanks 
<code>toast0</code> for pointing this out!
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
  Distributed Erlang relies on each node periodically sending heartbeat messages to every other node in the cluster to ensure that the connections are still alive; so as the number of connections between nodes grows, the number of heartbeat messages that need to be sent also grows at the same rate.
</p>
<p>
  This can lead to a lot of network traffic in large clusters, which can put a strain on the network.
</p>
<p>
  Historically, a "large" cluster in Erlang was considered to be around 50-100 nodes. This may have changed in recent years, but it's still something to be aware of when designing distributed Erlang systems.
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    Note: this number comes from an anecdote from Franceso Cesarini which I admit may have been misremembered on my part.
  </p>
  <p>
    
In practice, certain applications have been known to run on clusters of 400+ nodes, and in WhatsApp's case, 1,000+ nodes. Whether or not this was done without 
<code>hidden node</code> s is unknown to me.
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
  You can mitigate this by strategically "partitioning" you cluster into smaller groups of nodes that are connected to eachother via a mechanism known as a 
<code>hidden node</code>, though this may prove unwieldy in practice.
</p>
<h3>
  Lack of Fine-Grained Control
</h3>
<p>
  One of the issues with Distributed Erlang is that it lacks fine-grained control over the distribution mechanism.
</p>
<p>
  You can't 
  <i>
    easily
  </i>
  , for example, specify which nodes should be connected to which other nodes, or which nodes should be connected to which other nodes, likewise, you're not able to throttle traffic out of the box.
</p>
<p>
  This can lead to situations where a single node in the cluster can overwhelm the network with traffic, leading to network congestion and dropped packets.
</p>
<p>
  One cool feature of Distributed Erlang is the fact that members of a cluster don't have to be homogeneous, i.e. you can have different nodes responsible for serving different purposes in your cluster (so long as they share the same cookie).
</p>
<p>
  At 
  <a href="https://vetspire.com/">
    Vetspire
  </a>&nbsp;, we utilise this feature heavily, though we've had to build a custom routing layer on top of Distributed Erlang in order to route requests/rpc calls to the appropriate nodes.
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    Aside: In the Elixir world, there's a great library called 
    <a href="https://github.com/phoenixframework/flame">
      FLAME
    </a>&nbsp; that provides an API for spinning up new nodes on demand.
  </p>
  <p>
    
Definitely check it out!
  </p>
</blockquote>
<h3>
  Network Partitions
</h3>
<p>
  Unlike when writing applications that run on a single machine, when writing distributed systems, you need to be aware of the possibility of network partitions.
</p>
<p>
  A network partition is when a network becomes divided into two or more separate subnetworks that are unable to communicate with each other.
</p>
<p>
  Network partitions can happen for a variety of reasons, such as network failures, misconfigured routers, or software bugs.
</p>
<p>
  Generally speaking, network partitions are less an issue of "if" they're a problem and more an issue of "when" they're a problem.
</p>
<p>
  This is particularly important when designing systems reliant on a 
<code>single global process</code>-- i.e. a system whereby a single instance of a process is required to be running at any given time, once and only once in the system.
</p>
<p>
  The general advice is to avoid relying on a single global process, and instead to design your system in such a way that it can tolerate the failure of any single node.
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    In the Elixir world, there are libraries such as 
    <a href="https://https//hexdocs.pm/swarm/Swarm.html">
      Swarm
    </a>&nbsp; and 
    <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/horde/readme.html">
      Horde
    </a>&nbsp; that attempt to mitigate this issue some, though its on the implementor to reconcile the state of the system after a partition has been resolved.
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
  One way to do this is to use a distributed consensus algorithm, such as 
  <a href="https://raft.github.io/">
    Raft
  </a>&nbsp;, to ensure that all nodes in the cluster agree on the state of the system.
</p>
<p>
  If one must rely on a single global process, using something like consistent hashing may help ensure only a single process is running in your cluster, but this is not a panacea as that particular node may not be alive or reachable during a network partition.
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    Definitely take a look at 
    <a href="https://github.com/basho/riak_core">
      <i>
        core
      </i>
      riak
    </a>&nbsp; as a resource for learning about engineering around Distributed Erlang in general.
  </p>
</blockquote>
<h3>
  Single Mailbox Bottleneck
</h3>
<p>
  In Erlang, each process has its own mailbox, which is a queue of messages that have been sent to the process.
</p>
<p>
  However, in contrast to the standard case, when sending messages to a process on another node, that process is first handled by that remote node's distribution layer's mailbox.
</p>
<p>
  This distribution-layer mailbox is a singleton on any given node, and as such, like with high-traffic 
<code>genserver</code> s, they quickly become a bottleneck in high-traffic systems.
</p>
<p>
  This is particularly an issue when sending either a large number of messages to a remote node, or when sending large data payloads to a remote node.
</p>
<p>
  As mailboxes in Erlang are FIFO, this can lead to a situation where a single process on a remote node is overwhelmed with messages, and is unable to process them all in a timely manner -- the worst case scenario being that the mailbox blocks pending heartbeat messages, leading to the node being considered down.
</p>
<p>
  There are some alternative distribution mechanisms that can be used to mitigate this, such as 
  <a href="https://github.com/priestjim/gen_rpc">
    <i>
      rpc
    </i>
    gen
  </a>&nbsp;, which re-implements the built in 
<code>rpc</code> and 
<code>erpc</code> modules to use HTTP rather than Erlang's built-in distribution mechanisms.
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    This comes with additional advantages, such as the ability to send messages via SSL.
  </p>
</blockquote>
<h3>
  Node Discovery
</h3>
<p>
  It's important to note that the design and chosen trade-offs of pretty much anything in Erlang were made in the 80s, and whilst some choices like the focus on the actor model have aged well, others have not.
</p>
<p>
  When it comes to Distributed Erlang, one of the differences between most deployments today and those of the 80s is the prevalence of cloud computing -- namely the fact that modern applications are oftentimes deployed in environments such as Kubernetes.
</p>
<p>
  For node discovery in such environments, Erlang's built-in mechanisms need to be supplemented with something like 
  <a href="https://hex.pm/packages/libcluster">
    libcluster
  </a>&nbsp; which provides pluggable strategies for node discovery via Kubernetes DNS, Consul, etc.
</p>
<h3>
  Physics
</h3>
<p>
  Finally, there's the issue of physics.
</p>
<p>
  When you're writing distributed systems, you need to be aware of the speed of light, and the fact that it takes time for messages to travel between nodes.
</p>
<p>
  This means that if you're designing a system that relies on low-latency communication between nodes, you need to be aware of the physical distance between the nodes, and the speed of light.
</p>
<p>
  Especially during normal development on a single laptop, it's easy to forget that the network latency between two nodes on the same machine is going to be much lower than the network latency between two nodes on different continents. This can lead to situations where your system works fine in development, but falls over in production.
</p>
<p>
  Clock synchronization is another issue that can crop up when working with distributed systems. Trying to keep track of the causal order of events across multiple nodes can be difficult. Using protocols like 
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_Time_Protocol">
    NTP
  </a>&nbsp; can help, as well as designing resilience to clock skew in your systems can help as well.
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    See 
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallacies_of_distributed_computing">
      the fallacies of distributed computing
    </a>&nbsp; for more on this.
  </p>
</blockquote>
<h2>
  Conclusion
</h2>
<p>
  Erlang is a powerful language for building distributed systems, thanks to its built-in support for concurrency, fault tolerance, and distribution.
</p>
<p>
  However, building distributed systems is hard, and there are many pitfalls to be aware of when working with distributed Erlang systems.
</p>
<p>
  By understanding the underlying principles of Erlang, and by being aware of the potential pitfalls, you can build systems that are fault-tolerant, scalable, and easy to reason about.

<p>The above are just a few random code snippets. They don’t give an idea of all possible programs that could be written in those languages. But I hope they can quickly highlight the similarities and differences between the two languages.</p>
<p>This slowly leads us to the next point.</p>
<h2 id="features">Features</h2>
<p>Haskell has waaaaaay more features than probably any other programming language (well, C++ can compete). This is both good and bad.</p>
<p>It’s good because you have the tools to solve your problems in the best way.</p>
<p>It’s bad because you have those tools. They’re distracting. Every time I need to solve a problem in Haskell, I’m immediately thinking about all the ways I can design the solution instead of, ahem, actually implementing this solution.</p>
<p>I’m interested in building stuff, not sitting near my pond on a warm summer day, thinking if TypeFamilies + DataKinds would be better than GADTs for making illegal states unrepresentable.</p>
<p>If I come to an existing OCaml project, the worst thing previous developers could do to it is have poor variable names, minimal documentation, and 200+ LOC functions. That’s fine, nothing extraordinary, I can handle that.</p>
<p>If I come to an existing Haskell project, the worst thing previous developers could do… Well, my previous 8 years of Haskell experience can’t prepare me for that 😅</p>
<p>That’s why I feel more productive in OCaml.</p>
<p>I do miss some Haskell features at times. But I’ve seen their ugly side and what they can do to your output.</p>

<h2 id="ecosystem">Ecosystem</h2>
<p>Let’s be honest, both programming languages are niche FP langs. So you shouldn’t expect first-class support for the latest modern framework that just got published.</p>
<p>However, in my experience, despite needing to write more custom bindings, you have solutions for the majority of common tasks.</p>
<p>For example, in OCaml, you can find:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/dmbaturin/otoml/">otoml: A TOML parser</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/leostera/minttea">Mint Tea: A TUI framework</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/imandra-ai/ocaml-opentelemetry">ocaml-opentelemetry: Instrumentation for OpenTelemetry</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/solvuu/awsm">awsm: OCaml AWS Client</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/gopiandcode/petrol">petrol: An OCaml SQL API made to go FAST</a></li>
</ul>
<p>And so on. Similar story for Haskell.</p>
<p>I’d still say that the Haskell ecosystem has more packages and more ready-to-go solutions.</p>
<p>It’s easy to show the difference in the following example.</p>
<p>Number of <a href="https://stripe.com/docs/api">Stripe API</a> client libraries:</p>
<ul>
<li>Haskell: 13</li>
<li>OCaml: 1 (last change was 8 years ago, so it’s more like zero)</li>
</ul>
<p>You may find a solution in Haskell. But often you’ll discover <strong>too many</strong> solutions, you won’t know which one to choose.</p>
<p>Choosing a library in Haskell becomes a separate skill you need to master. Haskellers <a href="https://www.haskellforall.com/2018/05/how-i-evaluate-haskell-packages.html">even blog their recommendations</a> on how to choose a library! And you’ll face this dilemma over and over again.</p>
<p>Often, a new Haskell library is created not because it solves a different problem.</p>
<p>But because the author wanted to <em>write it differently</em> (using different abstractions, playing with new features, etc. Who doesn’t want a new streaming library based on LinearTypes???).</p>
<p>It’s not exciting to write a GitHub API client and parse tons of JSON.</p>
<p>But it is exciting to design a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elqPlMyryjc">logger with comonads</a>.</p>

<p>The Haskell tooling evokes the most controversial feelings. It’s like an emotional roller coaster:</p>
<ul>
<li>🤩 Hoogle is the best! I can search through the entire ecosystem by using just a type signature!!!</li>
<li>😨 Wait, why build tooling error messages are so bad, what do you mean it couldn’t find a build plan for a working project???</li>
<li>🤩 Global content-addressable storage for all dependencies is such an amazing idea!!!</li>
<li>😨 What do you mean I need to recompile my IDE because I changed my package???</li>
<li>🤩 I can automatically test all the code snippets in my package docs!!!</li>
<li>😨 Wait, why the standard library doesn’t have docs at all for this version I use???</li>
</ul>
<p>And so on.</p>
<p>Using Haskell tooling is like always being in the quantum superposition of <strong>“How do you even use other PLs without such wholesome Haskell tools???”</strong> and <strong>“How Haskellers can live like that without these usability essentials???”</strong>.</p>
<hr>
<p>OCaml, on the other hand, hits differently. Because its ecosystem is smaller, you actually get surprised every time you find something working!</p>
<p>For example, the VSCode plugin for OCaml based on Language Server Protocol (LSP) works out-of-the-box. I never had any issues with it. It <strong>just works</strong> ™️</p>
<p>The ergonomics of starting with OCaml tooling might not be the best but they’re straightforward and robust. And they work most of the time.</p>
<hr>
<p>To get a full picture, refer to the following table for the full comparison of available tooling in both languages.</p>

<h2 id="compiler-messages">Compiler messages</h2>
<p>I want to highlight the compiler aspect of tooling separately since this is the tool you interact the most with.</p>
<p>Especially, compiler suggestions.</p>
<p>When using FP languages, the compiler is your best friend! You rely on it heavily to understand why your assumptions haven’t been codified precisely.</p>
<p>Therefore, the compiler must present the information in the most accessible way.</p>
<p>In my view, Haskell compiler messages tend to be verbose with lots of contextual, often redundant, and distracting information.</p>
<p>OCaml compiler messages, on the other hand, are quite succinct. Sometimes too succinct.</p>
<p>Consider the following example.</p>
<h2 id="haskell-compiler-messages-example">Haskell: Compiler messages example</h2>
<p><strong>Program with an error</strong></p>

<p><strong>Compiler output</strong></p>

<hr>
<p>This is just one example (and most likely not the best one), but you can already see the differences in how information is presented and how types work in different languages.</p>
<h2 id="standard-library">Standard library</h2>
<p>I believe the standard library deserves a separate mention too.</p>
<p>It shapes your first program in a language and guides you through all future journeys.</p>
<p>A great standard library is a cornerstone of your PL success.</p>
<p>A poor standard library is a cornerstone of never-ending bikesheds about a better standard library (including an endless variety of alternative competing standard libraries).</p>
<p>I’m a big proponent of the idea that a standard library should be batteries-included.</p>
<p>Give me an Option-like type, a UTF-8 string, Map and HashMap, JSON and XML parsers, async primitives, and so on, so I can avoid learning your poor implementation of dependency tracking and build tooling. (<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/uploads/prod/2018/03/build-systems.pdf">Build Systems a la Carte</a> is a thorough analysis of the space of dependency trackers and build tools.).</p>
<p>Both Haskell and OCaml have kinda barebones standard libraries. They have minor differences (e.g.&nbsp;Haskell doesn’t include Map and HashMap; OCaml doesn’t have non-empty lists and Bitraversable). But overall they’re similar in the spirit.</p>
<p>The Haskell standard library is called <code>base</code> and OCaml standard library is called.. well, it’s just “the standard library”.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base">base: The Haskell Standard Library</a></li>
<li><a href="https://v2.ocaml.org/api/index.html">OCaml: The standard library</a></li>
</ul>
<p>However, one difference is striking. The quality of Haskell documentation sometimes can amaze even a seasoned developer.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Haskell has a few more nice features, like the ability to jump to sources from docs but I’ve been told such features are being cooked for OCaml too 👀</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Compare a few doc snippets for the List data type (one of the fundamental structures in FP):</p>

<p>You may argue that the result of such functions is obvious, therefore there’s no need to write essays under each function.</p>
<p>I’m a fan of example-driven documentation, and I love seeing usage examples in docs! This immediately gives me an idea of how I can leverage the API in the best way.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>I want to end this blog post by saying:</p>
<p><strong>Both languages came a long way to support real industrial needs.</strong></p>
<p>They’re still small compared to mainstream languages.</p>
<p>If you’re not critically dependent on the presence of some specific SDK, you can choose any and have lots of joy while coding your next app 🧡</p>
<p>However, I prefer OCaml nowadays because I feel that I can focus on actually building stuff with this language.</p>
