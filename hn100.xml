<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="__blog-post-container" itemprop="articleBody"><p>By replacing <code>pip</code> with <code>uv</code> in our production images, our build pipeline (and therefore releasing a new version) is a lot faster.
<code>Uv</code> is an extremely fast Python package installer and resolver written in Rust. It is developed by <a href="https://astral.sh/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Astral</a> and it's open source. Check it out on <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/uv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub</a>.</p><p>In the following table, you can see that we can save around 5 hours of execution time on each build.</p><table><thead><tr><th>Arch</th><th>Pip</th><th>UV</th><th>Savings</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>aarch64</td><td>1h 24m 53s</td><td>5m 18s</td><td>~1h 20m</td></tr><tr><td>armhf</td><td>1h 52m 20s</td><td>6m 2s</td><td>~1h 46m</td></tr><tr><td>armv7</td><td>1h 26m 43s</td><td>5m 28s</td><td>~1h 21m</td></tr><tr><td>amd64</td><td>22m 10s</td><td>3m 20s</td><td>~19m</td></tr><tr><td>i386</td><td>17m 37s</td><td>3m 11s</td><td>~14m</td></tr></tbody></table><p>On average, we run the build pipeline 43 times as we create</p><ul><li>31 nightlies (one nightly per day)</li><li>7 beta releases</li><li>5 stable releases (including patch ones)</li></ul><p>In total, we save around 215 hours per month.
With this massive improvement, we can now ship hotfixes even faster, as the pipeline to ship a new version now takes around 20 minutes instead of 2.5 hours.</p><p>The 215 monthly saved execution hours can be used by other jobs and make the CI experience for all developers and our community better.
By replacing <code>pip</code> with <code>uv</code>, we improve our sustainability by using fewer resources to build our images.</p><p><strong>A big thank you to Astral for developing this amazing tool.</strong>
Please check out their <a href="https://astral.sh/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">website</a> and products as they offer, for example, a "lightning" fast linter/formatter for Python too.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<p>We did it! After two years of hard work we hold in our hands hard proof that the incredible team at Terraform can make synthetic natural gas from sunlight and air, as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/01/terraform-industries-converted-electricity-and-air-into-synthetic-natural-gas/">reported in TechCrunch</a>.</p>

<p>Last Wednesday March 27, 2024, we commissioned our integrated power-to-gas demonstrator. The system converts electricity and air into affordable fossil-free natural gas using proprietary subsystems, developed in-house, for hydrogen electrolysis, direct air capture, and methanation. This marks a major milestone in the technical and commercial development of our technology and another step on the path to our positive vision for the future where everyone has access to plentiful cheap, reliable energy, harvested from renewable carbon and power, with lower ecological and climate impact.</p>

<p>Our core innovation is the utilization of proven and well-understood industrial processes implemented within innovatively simple and cost-effective proprietary technology systems adapted to the daily variations of renewable power for producing cheap sustainable natural gas from sunlight and air. These design and process innovations are responsible for driving production costs down for both their green hydrogen and atmospheric CO2 capture to levels previously thought unattainable. Combining super-cheap solar power with low-cost green hydrogen and CO2 capture are the key to producing commodity-grade electro-fuel alternatives at competitive commodity prices.</p>



<p>Our elite team of engineers have made significant progress towards our <a href="https://terraformindustries.wordpress.com/2022/07/24/terraform-industries-whitepaper/">stated goals</a> of <a href="https://terraformindustries.wordpress.com/2023/08/16/how-to-produce-green-hydrogen-for-1-kg/">radically cheaper green hydrogen</a> and direct air capture CO2. We follow a simple playbook. Adapt a known industrial process to ultra-cheap solar power by a) radically reducing capex to compensate for lowered utilization and b) developing processes that are robust to variations in power due to weather, as well as diurnal and seasonal power shifts. </p>



<p>First, our innovative electrolyzer converts cheap solar power into hydrogen with current production costs at less than $2.50 per kg of H2. How? To first order, our electrolyzer capex costs &lt;$100/kW, and we‚Äôre currently baselining solar PV DC electricity at $20/MWh. There is no hand waving about economies of scale or subsidies here, though we are eligible for the full IRA 45V green hydrogen tax credit, worth $3/kg-H2.</p>

<p>Second, the proprietary direct air capture (DAC) system concentrates CO2 in the atmosphere today for less than $250 per ton. How? Our DAC capex costs &lt;$600/T-year-CO2. Like the electrolyzer, this represents a substantial improvement on the state of the art. </p>

<p>Finally, our in-house multistage Sabatier chemical reactor ingests hydrogen and CO2, producing pipeline grade natural gas, which is &gt;97% methane (CH4). Our reactor uses no rare or expensive catalysts nor cherry-picked data ‚Äì it handily operates for hours in steady state. </p>

<p>The <a href="https://terraformindustries.wordpress.com/2023/06/26/the-terraformer-mark-one/">Terraformer combines these three subsystems into one modular chemical plant</a>, skid-mounted for deployment alongside a solar PV array.</p>

<p>It is particularly cool to develop and build all three of our sub-systems in our castle in Burbank, CA, right across from the long-time home of the fabled <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skunk_Works">Lockheed Skunk Works</a>. In-house production &amp; manufacturing enables faster iteration, lowered supply chain risk, and the successful demonstration of the complete techno-economic model for producing cost-effective fossil-free natural gas.</p>



<p>While I generally prefer understatement, it is hard to overstate the significance of this achievement, which has been two years in the making. Humanity today depends on traditional oil and gas to provide them with a cheap and easily transportable source of energy-dense hydrocarbons, to the tune of 100 million barrels per day, which unfortunately also generates ~50 gigatons per year of CO2 emissions. </p>



<p>The Terraformer unlocks an industrial-scale source of renewable hydrocarbons that breaks our dependence on fossil fuels and lays the foundation for another century of spectacular growth, broad-based wealth creation, and global environmental restoration.</p>



<p>What‚Äôs next? We‚Äôre taking reservations for our first production Terraformers, and ramping production to meet demand. </p>

<h2>FAQ</h2>

<h4>Sixty-Five-Oh-What?</h4><p>

The 6502 is the famous processor found at the core of such influential computer systems as the Apple ][, the Commodore PET, the Atari 400 and 800 home video game consoles, the BBC Micro, and the Tamagotchi digital pet. Slight variations of it were found in the Commodore 64, the Atari 2600, and the original Nintendo Entertainment System.

</center>


<h4>What's with the name and capitalization?</h4><p>

MOnSter 6502 is a play on the original manufacturer and device name (MOS 6502) as well as acknowledging its large size.


</p><h4>How big is it?</h4><p>
It's a four layer circuit board, 12 √ó 15 inches, 0.1 inches thick, with surface mount components on both sides.


</p><h4>How many components are there on the board?</h4><p>

In total, there are 4769 components on the board. There are 3218 transistors and 1019 resistors that comprise the "functional" part of the 6502. 
In addition to these, there are also LEDs sprinkled throughout that indicate the values of various control lines, registers, and status bits, as well as additional transistors and resistors (not counted in those "functional" totals) that are necessary to drive those LEDs.
</p><p>

As of the second revision of the board, the design statistics are as follows:
</p><ul>
<li>Components that correspond 1:1 with transistors in the original 6502:
<ul>
<li>Total active transistors: 4237</li>
<ul><li>3218 enhancement mode n-channel MOSFETs
<ul><li>2588 discrete</li>
<li>630 located on 164 quad transistor array chips (26 of these 656 transistors are not used)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>1019 resistors (the original 6502 used depletion mode MOSFETs in place of resistors)</li>
</ul></ul></li>

<li>998 Additional parts present only in the MOnSter 6502:
<ul>
<li>313 LEDs (The first revision board, shown in the video, has only 167 LEDs)</li>
<li>270 extra MOSFETs for driving the LEDs</li>
<li>20 filter capacitors</li>
<li>32 bus capacitors</li>
<li>2 zero-ohm jumpers for net tie reasons</li>
<li>8 current limit resistors</li>
<li>314 resistors for the LEDs</li>
<li>36 diodes for ESD protection</li>
<li>2 jacks for 5 V power: main and alternate location</li>
<li>1 rectangular connector for the 40-pin "ICR" ribbon cable</li>

</ul></li>
<li>Total parts: 4769</li>
</ul>


<h4>Are you nuts?</h4><p>
Probably.

</center>


<h4>What is the current status of the project?</h4><p>

Headed towards a full public launch; delayed a bit by COVID.

</p><p>
The first full-scale prototype was publicly demonstrated at the <a href="http://makerfaire.com/maker/entry/55149/">2016 Bay Area Maker Faire</a>. We brought it up to the stages of successfully running various programs in assembly,  <a href="https://twitter.com/TubeTimeUS/status/739639901826605056">BASIC</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/TubeTimeUS/status/828098079962210304">Forth</a>. Our second prototype, a year later, fixed a few issues that we encountered when bringing up the first version (removing all of the patch wires) but also added over 100 additional LEDs, including one for every instruction decode line on the 6502's decode ROM.

</p><p>
Since the 6502 is just a microprocessor (CPU), about half of our work on the project (and most of our work since the first prototype) has actually been building up the capabilities around this processor ‚Äî adding interfaces for a keyboard, <a href="https://twitter.com/TubeTimeUS/status/771131509784719361">monitor</a>, and programming ‚Äî so that you can actually use it. In the process of doing so, we have built up a single-board computer (a tiny motherboard) that uses the 6502 as its CPU, such that you can either use a socketed (vintage) 6502 IC, or the MOnSter 6502 through a cable. 
</p><p>
More, we have been working towards a public launch, currently planned for mid-2023, building the MOnSter into <a href="https://www.evilmadscientist.com/2019/monster-in-a-box/">a shadowbox 
enclosure</a> complete with a tiny hidden "motherboard" that the CPU sits in, so that it can run demonstration programs even without being plugged into a separate computer.


</p><h4>Does it run at the full speed of an original 6502 chip?</h4><p>
No; it's relatively slow. The MOnSter 6502 runs at about 1/20th the speed of the original, thanks to the much larger capacitance of the design. The maximum reliable clock rate is around 50 kHz. The primary limit to the clock speed is the gate capacitance of the MOSFETs that we are using, which is much larger than the capacitance of the MOSFETs on an original 6502 die.


</p><h4>Can you hook it up inside an Apple ][ and run Oregon Trail?</h4><p>
No, not directly. It's neat to think of plugging the MOnSter 6502's <del>in-circuit emulator (ICE)</del> in-circuit replica (ICR) cable directly into a socket inside an Apple ][, but that wouldn't actually work. The Apple ][ design relies on a number of clever tricks that derive timing for video generation and peripheral control from the main clock signal ‚Äî all of which will fail if you need to run at a slower speed.
</p><p>
There are some ways to get around limitations like these. For example, the <a href="http://www.brielcomputers.com/wordpress/?cat=17">Replica I</a> computer (an Apple I clone) uses a Parallax Propeller chip to emulate a system clock and some of the timing-dependent external processing. The <a href="http://www.8bitforce.com/projects/retroshield/">RetroShield</a> 6502 is another example of a software-implemented Apple I compatible that can use a hardware 6502 processor. We are most excited about the new <a href="http://apple1.smartykit.org/">SmartyKit Apple I replica</a>, which is specifically designed to run at a slower clock speed. You should also be able to put a slower clock into <a href="https://eater.net/6502">Ben Eater's 6502 computer</a> in order to "plug in" the MOnSter.


</p><h4>So what can it do?</h4><p>
It can act as an in-circuit hardware emulator for a 6502 integrated circuit, in any circuit that can run at a relatively low clock rate. We're currently running it on a custom 6502 development board (the single-board computer that we mentioned earlier) and doing things like running running BASIC, much as you would on an Apple ][. We have also plugged it into the CPU sockets of a few people's homebrew 6502 computers (including the <a href="http://commodorez.com/cactus.html">Cactus</a> and <a href="http://www.8bitforce.com/projects/retroshield/">RetroShield 6502</a>) that could run at variable clock speed. We are interested in finding other applications where it could be substituted for an original 6502.


</p><h4>How long did it take?</h4><p>
This has been a ~8 year project, thus far. The primary design work was done over six months, from <a href="https://twitter.com/TubeTimeUS/status/617108015091548160">July 3</a> to <a href="https://twitter.com/TubeTimeUS/status/671934447168557056">December 1</a>, 2015. There have been several stages of reviews and revisions since then, and a few generations of the "motherboards" that we have run the MOnSter in.



</p><h4>Is it truly a "discrete 6502?"</h4><p>
Not in the strictest sense. However, it really depends upon how picky you would like to be. 
</p><p>
The MOnSter 6502 uses the original dynamic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NMOS_logic">NMOS logic</a> design, implemented at the individual transistor level. 
</p><p>
Dynamic NMOS requires a large number of "transmission gate" transistors that are used to switch currents. For various technical reasons, only a 4-terminal MOSFET can make an effective NMOS transmission gate. Unfortunately, individually packaged 4-terminal MOSFETs are no longer commercially available. However, they do still make arrays of 2 or 4 MOSFETs on a single chip with a separate substrate pin. We used the 4-pack version ‚Äî These are the quad transistor array chips that we mentioned earlier. 
</p><p>
Because these transistors do share a pin, there are (strictly speaking) integrated circuits in the MOnSter 6502. However, one might credibly argue that it is a discrete transistor design since there are not (for example) any logic gate chips in the circuit.


</p><h4>What are those little gold squares around the border?</h4><p>

The 40 square pads around the edge of the circuit board correspond to the 40 pins of the original 6502 integrated circuit. They're also designed to look like the wire-bond contact pads on an IC die ‚Äî where the IC would be physically connected inside (for example) a 40-pin DIP package. These pads are functional contact points on the MOnSter 6502; you can hook up to them with alligator clips to probe or communicate with any pin.


</p><h4>How much power does it draw?</h4><p>

It draws up to roughly 2 A at 5 V, or 10 W total. The LEDs are a significant part of the power consumption.


</p><p>

<a href="https://monster6502.com/"><img src="https://cdn.evilmadscientist.com/sites/6502/images/B2_1800x1090.jpg" width="900" height="545" alt="MOnSter 6502 in enclosure" title="MOnSter 6502 in enclosure"></a>

</p>

<h4>Can I see it in person?</h4><p>

Due to the ongoing pandemic we haven't been taking the MOnSter to shows lately, but you can come visit us <i>by appointment</i> at Evil Mad Scientist Laboratories in Sunnyvale California for a demonstration. Please <a href="https://shop.evilmadscientist.com/contact">use our contact form</a> to ask about available demonstration times.

</p><h4>How big is the MOnSter 6502 compared to the original 6502 die?</h4><p>
The original device was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOS_Technology_6502#Technical_description">153 √ó 168 mils (3.9 √ó 4.3 mm) or an area of 16.6 square mm</a>. Given that ours is 12 √ó 15 inches, that makes it about 7000 times actual size. 

</p><h4>How big would the MOnSter 6502 be if it were made with through-hole parts instead of surface mount parts?</h4><p>
About 19 square feet (1.7 square meters).


</p><h4>How big would a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motorola_68000">68000 microprocessor</a> be at the scale of the MOnSter 6502?</h4><p>
Also about 19 square feet (1.7 square meters).

</p><h4>Are you going to make a 68000 next?</h4><p>
No.


</p><h4>How big would a modern CPU be at this scale?</h4><p>
The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_A8X">Apple A8X</a>, found in the iPad Air 2, contains about 3 billion transistors. (This is comparable to the number of transistors in modern desktop computer CPUs as well.) At the scale of the MOnSter 6502, that would take about 885,000 square feet (over 20 acres or 8 hectares) ‚Äî an area about 940 ft (286 m) square.


</p><h4>Are you going to make a dis-integrated modern CPU next?</h4><p>
No.

</p><h4>Are you going to make one out of vacuum tubes next?</h4><p>
No. 

</p><h4>Are you going to make one out of relays next?</h4><p>
No. (Aren't we already doing enough to fight Moore's law?)


</p><h4>Can I buy one?</h4><p>
Hopefully in the near future! We are working towards a public launch, currently planned for Mid 2023; please <a href="http://eepurl.com/b1EhyX">Sign up for our mailing list</a> if you would like to receive updates as we get further along.



</p><h4>Is it expensive?</h4><p>
It is definitely not cheap to make one of these. We are currently estimating the cost at between $2k - $4k.
While the circuit board itself is large and a little bit expensive, the cost is actually dominated by the
component and assembly costs of an extremely large number of tiny components, most of which are individually
not that expensive. Add to that the setup and test costs of building complex things like these in small batches,
and you can immediately see how it adds up.


</p><h4>Is there going to be a soldering kit version of this?</h4><p>
No. (But on the other hand, "Anything is a soldering kit if you're brave enough!")

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<p>It honestly breaks my heart to write this article, but I want to be as transparent as possible with our readers because you are the ones that have quite literally kept our lights on over the past five years, and you deserve to know the truth about what‚Äôs happening behind the scenes, so here it is.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Retro Dodo is on the brink of collapse‚Ä¶ <strong>because of Google</strong>.</p>
<p>Back in 2019, I took the big risk of leaving my comfortable, full-time job and pursuing my own goal of creating a content brand that informs and educates retro gamers. I had very little money back then, just enough to sustain myself for a few months, and because I built up a small fan base on YouTube before leaving my job, I could start to earn a little bit of income through that platform while freelance video editing for large media companies.</p>
<p>I grafted solo for a long time and created the website that you are reading today to share my opinions on retro handhelds and old video games. It took 12 months or so before my blog started to make money through the installation of display advertising. Combined with my YouTube revenue, I could finally drop all of my freelancing gigs and go all in.</p>

<p>I needed support creating content so I employed one of my good friends <a href="https://retrododo.com/author/seb/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Seb Santabarbara who is our Editor in Chief</a> and has produced hundreds of articles over the last few years.</p>
<p>With Seb on board, Retro Dodo finally became a business, earning enough to sustain us both and to allow us to enjoy our time testing and reviewing retro gaming products.</p>
<p>The main source of our traffic was through Google Search. Whenever you searched for something retro gaming-related, our hope was that you would stumble across our website for advice, as we have invested hundreds of thousands of dollars into expert journalists to provide you with answers to your retro gaming queries. It worked incredibly well; Google‚Äôs search engine did what it entailed, showing users informative content <strong>created by human experts</strong>.</p>
<p>Small websites like ours had a chance to compete with larger websites because Google‚Äôs guidelines were fair, and if users were happy, then Google was happy. And to reward giving users a great and informative experience, Google would place websites higher or lower in the search results depending on how great your content was without much bias.</p>

<p>After two years of this and seeing steady revenue growth, we decided to increase our team, expanding into covering Retro Gaming news and features with <a href="https://retrododo.com/author/jasonbrown/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jason Brown</a> and <a href="https://retrododo.com/author/theolitston/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Theo Litston</a>, and also bringing on our new video producer Rob Page to help with video output. I was incredibly busy keeping an eye on industry trends, working on our <a href="https://retrododo.com/a-handheld-history-book/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new book series</a> that took two years to make, managing the team to produce the best possible content, and heck, even collaborating with <a href="https://youtu.be/Iu09mAN4f2U?si=5ORhJFqzS37hT8T_" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Casey Neistat in New York</a>, and this period was incredibly fun.</p>
<p>Well, that all came to an abrupt end in September 2023 when Google decided to release an algorithm update that completely obliterated thousands of independent content businesses overnight, and we are one of them.</p>
<p>Since September 2023, Google has hidden our site from millions of retro gamers, reducing our organic traffic and revenue by 85% and causing our business to be on the edge of going under.</p>

<h2>Google Is Now Playing Unfairly &amp; Unlawfully</h2>
<p><em>Before I go in on Google, I would like to mention that I have always been an advocate of Google before this. They have allowed me and many other creatives to earn a living and feed our families through their platform, and for that,</em> I will always be grateful (even if their platform wasn‚Äôt perfect). But this recent update is a direct attack on<em> content website owners, and it‚Äôs happening while Google makes some incredibly unlawful and disgusting changes behind closed doors.</em></p>
<p>Google‚Äôs search results are no longer fair and no longer abide by their own guidelines, which they repeatedly share with website owners when they speak up, alongside Google‚Äôs spokespersons replying with cover-up quotes such as ‚Äúmake better content for your readers‚Äù.</p>
<p><strong>So what‚Äôs changed?</strong> Google continuously states (and very publicly) that their goal is to show helpful content, to reduce spam, and make the search results fairer to all sized websites. But the opposite is happening, and aggressively.</p>
<p>Google‚Äôs algorithms now favor a handful of results BEFORE ‚Äúnormal‚Äù websites, results that rarely show independent websites. And when I mention them, it‚Äôs likely that you‚Äôve seen these changes yourself:</p>
<p>Firstly, Google wants to completely eradicate users leaving their search results and will now show you their own ‚ÄúFrom Sources‚Äù answers to search terms. These answers are taken without consent from the publisher‚Äôs content and are stolen from creators‚Äô work so that Google can give you ‚Äútheir‚Äù answer instead, lowering the chances of readers exploring websites‚Ä¶ the websites that are paying to create the exact content that Google now shows for themself. It‚Äôs straight-up intellectual property theft.</p>
<p>Secondly, if you manage to scroll past Google‚Äôs stolen answer, you will undoubtedly be bombarded with sponsored ads, and lots of them. These results are purposely designed to look like normal results and can bend Google‚Äôs guidelines when it comes to content quality. This is straight-up pay-to-play, again lowering the need for creators‚Äô articles. </p>
<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1160" height="653" src="https://retrododo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/google-serps-screeny-1-1160x653.webp" alt="" srcset="https://retrododo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/google-serps-screeny-1-1160x653.webp 1160w, https://retrododo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/google-serps-screeny-1-800x450.webp 800w, https://retrododo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/google-serps-screeny-1-50x28.webp 50w, https://retrododo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/google-serps-screeny-1-320x180.webp 320w, https://retrododo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/google-serps-screeny-1-560x315.webp 560w, https://retrododo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/google-serps-screeny-1.webp 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1160px) 100vw, 1160px"><figcaption>sponsored ads and ‚Äúfrom sources‚Äù example</figcaption></figure>
<p>Type in ‚Äúbest home arcade cabinets‚Äù into Google, and you‚Äôll see a prime example of a response filled with sponsored slots. And, if you look closely, you will notice the articles ranking highest are likely from websites also paying for Google for clicks. There are barely any professional reviews in sight. I understand that this is a query with a buyer‚Äôs intent, but there are many terms like this where it‚Äôs straight-up pay-to-win.</p>
<p>This is after Google‚Äôs spokespersons saying that ‚Äòcreatives who have seen a loss in traffic should lower their ad density‚Äô‚Ä¶ one rule for us, another for them, hey?</p>
<p>Thirdly, and this is the biggest change I have ever seen in the search results over the last 5 years, is the fact that you will likely now see Reddit results upon searching for something. Reddit has its place on the internet, but certainly not for search terms where you seek expert and professional advice (what Google‚Äôs guidelines state).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Reddit is the single biggest winner in recent algorithm changes, seeing millions of more clicks every single day thanks to recent updates. But my understanding of the guidelines was that Google said they want to show results written by experts. </p>
<p>That‚Äôs what they say publicly, but in actual reality, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/reddit-ai-content-licensing-deal-with-google-sources-say-2024-02-22/">Google has recently partnered with Reddit to pay them $60M a year to crawl their website so that they can train Google‚Äôs AI</a>. This news became public just days before the update that catapulted Reddit‚Äôs traffic to the moon and weeks away from Reddit launching their IPO, which hockey-sticked their share price.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As of May 27th, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/video/2024/03/27/reddit-shares-slump-after-ceo-steve-huffman-sells-500000-shares.html">Reddit‚Äôs CEO sold a bunch of his shares at the peak too</a>, making him and likely many other investors incredibly rich. I am no detective, but it all smells very fishy, and as a creator seeing this all happen just makes me lose all trust in Google. They have replaced many creative‚Äôs incomes with Reddit results just so they can have more data for their AI. And maybe there‚Äôs a behind-the-scenes deal happening that might match up to the launch of their IPO? </p>
<p>But that‚Äôs just me speculating, and I‚Äôm no detective.</p>
<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1160" height="653" src="https://retrododo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/google-screenie-2-1160x653.webp" alt="" srcset="https://retrododo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/google-screenie-2-1160x653.webp 1160w, https://retrododo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/google-screenie-2-800x450.webp 800w, https://retrododo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/google-screenie-2-50x28.webp 50w, https://retrododo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/google-screenie-2-320x180.webp 320w, https://retrododo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/google-screenie-2-560x315.webp 560w, https://retrododo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/google-screenie-2.webp 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1160px) 100vw, 1160px"></figure>
<p>Don‚Äôt you worry, the list doesn‚Äôt stop there!&nbsp;</p>
<p>Most of the websites that have not seen a decline in traffic are owned and operated by huge media companies. Just 16 media companies who own over 400+ websites receive over 3.8 billion clicks a month from Google (thanks for the data <a href="https://detailed.com/google-control/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Detailed</a>), leaving little to no space for smaller websites to have a voice, even if these smaller websites make far better content (according to Google‚Äôs guidelines).</p>
<p>These goliath websites can bend the rules and get away with things that smaller websites are punished for. For example, we have spent years of testing handheld devices for our ‚Äú<a href="https://retrododo.com/best-retro-handhelds/">best retro handhelds</a>‚Äù article; you can see we have tested every single one, have dedicated images showing you the product, highly produced video reviews for many of the devices that took weeks to make, and our written content proves our opinions and comparisons. Large media companies, however, can get away with simply not testing the products, adding stock images, adding a bit of text, and directing you to their affiliate links as you can see here by an <a href="https://gamerant.com/best-retro-handheld-gaming-consoles/">article that outranks us by GameRant</a>.</p>
<p>These large websites can also get away with taking original content from small publishers, rewording it in their own way, and then outranking the website that wrote it originally in the first place. This leads to there being no financial incentive for small publishers to create unique content because it costs them a fortune to do so, and competition is on their tail copying what they are doing for a fraction of the cost/time.</p>
<p>We shouldn‚Äôt live in a world where only a few major companies dominate the entire search online ecosystem; Google needs to become a fairer search engine without bias.</p>
<p>And to rub salt into the wound, it was discovered that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/27/24084687/google-is-paying-small-news-outlets-to-use-an-ai-article-writing-tool">Google is paying some media companies ‚Äúfive figures‚Äù to use their AI to automatically scrape content from other publishers‚Äô work</a> (who have paid expert humans to produce) and publish it as news twice a day on their websites. Even though excessive use of AI is against their guidelines for the rest of their creators.</p>
<p>There are many other factors that are destroying the livelihoods of content creators that I could go into, but I don‚Äôt want to bore you. There‚Äôs the fact that <a href="https://blog.google/products/search/generative-ai-search/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Google Search Generative Experience</a> is coming to fruition giving users 100% AI-generated answers with very little credit to the creators that Google has scraped the answers from. We can also take into account the fact that Google is stopping third-party cookies soon, likely lowering ad revenue because display advertisers will lack data from users and won‚Äôt know what to show them. And then there‚Äôs the fact that AI websites are outranking us on a continuous basis and media companies are starting websites almost identical to ours, even going as far as replicating our content and physical product strategy.</p>
<p>My real issue is that Google isn‚Äôt telling us and other creators what we are doing wrong; they are replying with vague answers or sharing advice that goes completely against what‚Äôs showing up in the search results. There is no way for us to know how to recover from this because Google is lying to the faces of the people that make their search results great without giving them any help at all.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs likely that our website structure isn‚Äôt perfect or that our content may likely be ‚Äúover-optimised‚Äù for Google, but at least tell me. I am no SEO expert;l I have a million plates to spin as a content website operator, and I cannot get everything right. If Google were to inform me what I was doing incorrectly then I could change that, but they don‚Äôt. They just keep hiding our work, month after month after month.</p>
<p>Instead of helping us, they are pushing small independent publishers lower and lower down their search results so that our work cannot be seen, while at the same time supporting the use of AI, using our content for their own gain without permission, and increasing the visibility of content that goes completely against their guidelines.</p>
<p>There has never been a worse time for independent publishers who rely on Google. Mass intellectual theft is happening; it‚Äôs pay to win, and Google is so openly crushing the livelihoods of many of their creators that have supported them over the last 5+ years.</p>
<p>I honestly hope that Google can eventually create a search engine that‚Äôs fair, one that supports small independent publishers who actually follow their guidelines instead of punishing them for ‚Äúwriting for search engines and not readers‚Äù and treating them differently to websites that have a higher ‚Äúdomain authority‚Äù than them.</p>
<h2>What‚Äôs Next For Retro Dodo?</h2>
<p>Unfortunately, it‚Äôs not looking good for us, and in all honesty we‚Äôre all out of cash. I have tried my hardest for it not to affect the team, but we‚Äôre now losing money, which is devastating because I have worked endlessly for the past 5 years to create a brand that supports its staff as best as it possibly can. I find myself drained mentally and financially at a time when I am trying to support my family and my 12-week-old son.</p>
<p>This means I will have to reduce our staff, postpone our upcoming RDX Expo, postpone series 2 of our podcast, likely stop our A Handheld History book series after Book 2, and reduce our content output drastically this year.</p>
<p>All of this will hurt us even more in the short term, but it‚Äôs the only route we can take if we want to survive in the long run.</p>
<p>As a founder, I now need to create a plan for Retro Dodo to find traffic away from Google and new revenue streams away from direct advertising. That is how I stop us from going under.</p>
<p>It is no longer smart for me to rely upon or trust Google as a creator after they have rug pulled not only my family‚Äôs income, but the families of my team within the space of a few months.</p>
<p>In no other industry would you not know why this has happened nor be able to find a plan for how to recover, but as a Google Creator, they‚Äôre giving us incorrect information, vague responses, and doing business deals that go against everything they are telling the creators that no longer have any income.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs anxiety-inducing for us all, especially without help. All we can do is adapt and move away from Google as a reliable source of traffic.</p>
<h2>How Can You Help?</h2>
<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1160" height="653" src="https://retrododo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/dodo-patreon-1160x653.webp" alt="retro dodo patreon" srcset="https://retrododo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/dodo-patreon-1160x653.webp 1160w, https://retrododo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/dodo-patreon-800x450.webp 800w, https://retrododo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/dodo-patreon-50x28.webp 50w, https://retrododo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/dodo-patreon-320x180.webp 320w, https://retrododo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/dodo-patreon-560x315.webp 560w, https://retrododo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/dodo-patreon.webp 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1160px) 100vw, 1160px"></figure>
<p>I am not writing this to ask for help, but rather to simply be transparent regarding the state of Retro Dodo. But, if you <em>do</em> want to support us as an independent publication, the most helpful thing you can do is become a <a href="https://www.patreon.com/retrododo">Patreon Member</a>.</p>
<p>This gives us the ability to create content without having to please algorithms; it allows us to create content <strong>freely</strong>. Our Patreon comes with a bunch of benefits, including a physical welcome kit, early access to content, and an invite to a yearly meet-up in the UK.</p>
<p>We also have our book <a href="https://retrododo.com/a-handheld-history-book/">A Handheld History for sale on Amazon</a>, and our <a href="https://www.lostincult.co.uk/ahandheldhistory?ss_source=twads&amp;ss_campaign_name=Retrododo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">second book which is available to pre-order at Lost In Cult</a> which launches in a few months. Admittedly we don‚Äôt earn a lot from it, but it still helps.</p>
<p>I will continue to put all my efforts into building Retro Dodo back into what it once was and hopefully evolve it into something even better. It‚Äôs going to be a rough year for us as a publication, but we‚Äôre not going down without a fight.</p>

<p>I want to personally thank every single one of you that has read, watched, or shared our work. You have given me and my team an incredibly enjoyable few years creating content about retro games, and I hope we can recover from this so that we can continue giving you a place that you deserve, a place that truly champions retro gaming and the people that make this community so special.</p>
<p>Google is making the future of independent publishing incredibly difficult, and small publishers‚Äô work is becoming harder to find thanks to their algorithms and their use of AI-generated answers. But we will adapt, even if it takes us some time.</p>
<p><strong>Thank you, from the bottom of my heart.</strong></p>

            <i>New media platform delivers customers cash back while helping brands drive sales and business growth</i>
            
        </p><div>
    <p><b>NEW YORK, April 3, 2024</b> ‚Äì Today, Chase launched <a href="https://www.chase.com/mediasolutions/home?jp_cmp=cc/launchpressrelease/ext/na/na" target="_self" data-pt-name="lnk_website" title="Chase Media Website">Chase Media Solutions</a>, its new digital media business, providing brands with the ability to connect directly with the financial institution‚Äôs 80 million customers. Chase Media Solutions serves as a key conduit for brands, connecting them with consumers‚Äô personal passions and interests. In turn, Chase customers benefit from personalized offers and the ability to earn cash back with brands they love or are discovering for the first time.</p> 
<p>As the only bank-led media platform of its kind, Chase Media Solutions combines the scale and audience of a retail media network with the exclusive advantages of Chase‚Äôs first-party financial data, institutional credibility and precise targeting capabilities. Today, the bank‚Äôs large consumer base and 6 million small business customers benefit from Chase‚Äôs wide range of travel, dining and shopping offerings ‚Äî generating unparalleled insights across consumer categories.</p> 
<p>The launch of Chase Media Solutions follows the integration of Figg, a leading card-linked marketing platform. JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. acquired Figg in 2022 as a natural step in Chase‚Äôs effort to build out its owned, two-sided commerce platform, and as part of the firm's vision to bring win-win value to both business clients and banking customers.</p> 
<p>‚ÄúOur deep understanding of consumer spending across categories has driven us to reimagine what retail media networks can offer,‚Äù said Rich Muhlstock, President of Chase Media Solutions. ‚ÄúLike retailers, we have first-party data and a dedicated audience. But what sets us apart is the unrivaled scale and insights from our customers ‚Äì having long-served as a trusted guide for their financial decisions. Chase reaches across brands, merchants and shopping verticals, providing a comprehensive view of purchase behavior; this strengthens the degree of personalization, helping brands deliver offers that stoke consumer interests.‚Äù</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I'm following with somewhat vague interest the various legal battles Apple is currently involved in. Reading their response to the EU's DMA makes me sad. Not for the company itself. I honestly could not care less about the company. Nor for the people who run that company. I'm sad because the pursuit of endless growth is such a mind cancer. It consumes and distracts everyone. If you're an artisan, creating amazing objects is your end goal. Ideally, you want those objects to last forever. And if they don't, you want to do such an amazing job that once something is broken beyond repair, people will come to you again and ask you to make something new, rather than buying from someone else.</p>
<p>Apple makes amazing products. I bought the laptop I'm typing this 9 years ago. It still works fine. Sure, it's slow compared to my new machine but I can use it to do calls and write blog posts. And that's great. I love it. I was happy to give Apple my money back in 2015. But you know who's not happy? Apple. Apple is not happy that I bought a laptop in 2015 that was so good that it is still working fine 9 years later. And it's also not happy that I bought a phone more than 4 years ago that still does all the things I need it to do. Because they need to make money. More money. There's no end state here. <em>"More"</em> has no end state. At some point, a company like Apple will inevitably run out of people willing to buy their stuff. Because it's unreasonable to expect people to upgrade phones, laptops, screens, watches, tablets, virtual-ski-goggles every damn year. And so what do they do? They move into services. Music, movies, games, fitness, storage. You name it. But those also can't grow forever. Because guess what? There are other companies out there doing the same.</p>
<p>But they can't stop. They're a public company. If they're not growing enough it means they're failing. Forget that they make amazing products that can last decades with no issues. Forget that they're an almost 3-fucking-trillions dollar company. If they're not growing enough, stock goes down and that's no good. Because remember, there's no finish line here. They can't just be happy with their size. They can't be happy with the idea of employing thousands of smart people and creating amazing products. No, they have to keep growing. And sooner or later, this mind cancer becomes malignant.</p>
<p>Don't get me wrong, this is not just an Apple issue. It's an issue with any big company. It's an issue with everyone who can't accept that they reached their end state.</p>
<p>Cory Doctorow famously coined the enshittification term to describe the sad trend of online services going to shit over time. I don't think that's just an online services issue. It's a societal issue related to the pursuit of endless growth. And if you think about it, it's a deeply human issue. It's what happens when you can't say stop. No matter what you're doing, it can be something positive or negative, if you can't say stop, bad things will happen. Try to go for a run, and don't stop. Ever. Or try to drink water, and don't stop. Ever.</p>
<p>But it's our fault. Our as a society. We celebrate when Apple becomes the first trillion-dollar company but we don't celebrate when someone says <em>"You know what? I think I have enough"</em>.</p></div></div>]]></description>

However, it can turn into a source of frustration when pages load slowly. At the heart of this issue lies the encoding of images. To improve on this, we are introducing <a href="https://github.com/libjxl/libjxl/tree/main/lib/jpegli" target="_blank">Jpegli</a>, an advanced JPEG coding library that maintains high backward compatibility while offering enhanced capabilities and a 35% compression ratio improvement at high quality compression settings.</p>
  
<p><b>Jpegli is a new JPEG coding library</b> that is designed to be faster, more efficient, and more visually pleasing than traditional JPEG. It uses a number of new techniques to achieve these goals, including:</p>

<ul>
<li>It provides both a fully interoperable <b>encoder and decoder</b> complying with the original JPEG standard and its most conventional 8-bit formalism, and API/ABI compatibility with libjpeg-turbo and MozJPEG.</li></ul><ul>

<li><b>High quality results</b>. When images are compressed or decompressed through Jpegli, more precise and psychovisually effective computations are performed and images will look clearer and have fewer observable artifacts.</li></ul><ul>
  
<li><b>Fast</b>. While improving on image quality/compression density ratio, Jpegli's coding speed is comparable to traditional approaches, such as libjpeg-turbo and MozJPEG. This means that web developers can effortlessly integrate Jpegli into their existing workflows without sacrificing coding speed performance or memory use.</li></ul><ul>
 
<li><b>10+ bits</b>. Jpegli can be encoded with 10+ bits per component. Traditional JPEG coding solutions offer only 8 bit per component dynamics causing visible banding artifacts in slow gradients. Jpegli's 10+ bits coding happens in the original 8-bit formalism and the resulting images are fully interoperable with 8-bit viewers. 10+ bit dynamics are available as an API extension and application code changes are needed to benefit from it.</li></ul><ul>
  
<li><b>More dense:</b> Jpegli compresses images more efficiently than traditional JPEG codecs, which can save bandwidth and storage space, and <b>speed up web pages</b>.</li>
  
</ul><br>

<h2><b>How Jpegli works</b></h2>
  
<p>Jpegli works by using a number of new techniques to reduce noise and improve image quality; mainly adaptive quantization heuristics from the <a href="https://github.com/libjxl/libjxl" target="_blank">JPEG XL</a> reference implementation, improved quantization matrix selection, calculating intermediate results precisely, and having the possibility to use a more advanced <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICC_profile" target="_blank">colorspace</a>. All the new methods have been carefully crafted to use the traditional 8-bit JPEG formalism, so newly compressed images are compatible with existing JPEG viewers such as browsers, image processing software, and others.</p>

<h4><span><b>Adaptive quantization heuristics</b></span></h4> 
<p>Jpegli uses adaptive quantization to reduce noise and improve image quality. This is done by spatially modulating the dead zone in quantization based on <a href="https://github.com/google/butteraugli" target="_blank">psychovisual modeling</a>. Using adaptive quantization heuristics that we originally developed for JPEG XL, the result is improved image quality and reduced file size. These heuristics are much faster than a similar approach originally used in <a href="https://github.com/google/guetzli" target="_blank">guetzli</a>.<br>
  
  
</p><h4><span><b>Improved quantization matrix selection</b></span></h4>
<p>Jpegli also uses a set of quantization matrices that were selected by optimizing for a mix of psychovisual quality metrics. Precise intermediate results in Jpegli improve image quality, and both encoding and decoding produce higher quality results. Jpegli can use JPEG XL's XYB colorspace for further quality and density improvements.</p><br>

<h2><b>Testing Jpegli</b></h2>
  
<p>In order to quantify Jpegli's image quality improvement we enlisted the help of crowdsourcing raters to compare pairs of images from <a href="https://cloudinary.com/labs/cid22" target="_blank">Cloudinary Image Dataset '22</a>, encoded using three codecs: Jpegli, libjpeg-turbo and MozJPEG, at several bitrates.</p>
  
<p>In this comparison we limited ourselves to comparing the encoding only, decoding was always performed using libjpeg-turbo. We conducted the study with the XYB ICC color profile disabled since that is how we anticipate most users would initially use Jpegli. To simplify comparing the <a href="https://github.com/google-research/google-research/tree/master/mucped23" target="_blank">results</a> across the codecs and settings, we aggregated all the rater decisions using chess rankings inspired <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system" target="_blank">ELO scoring</a>.</p>

<div><table><tbody><tr><td><center><img alt="A bar graph of ELO scores on the left and plot graph of ELO scores on the right" data-original-height="1504" data-original-width="720" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgM2XmnDYP6bArTS8fmfeRWh4LDysiBMEITg0NYKH9whR1SACvuFl2JDUsoBXbm0oLSbXSzLH6e9urikKWM0rOIMuZshenEDEFB7nou4QZlXi85c-hml81ET1j6_6z2pqcAYWTj2elYi6j90YScxPZ4cib9dxob9Z-bf4rBtP-y-LbOrry9U5TcjnRJ7IU/s1600/Image1%20%284%29.png" td=""></center></td></tr><tr><td><i>A higher ELO score indicates a better aggregate performance in the rater study. We can observe that jpegli at 2.8 BPP received a higher ELO rating than libjpeg-turbo at 3.7 BPP, a bitrate 32 % higher than Jpegli's.</i></td></tr></tbody></table></div><br>


<h2><b>Results</b></h2>
  
<p>Our results show that <b>Jpegli can compress high quality images 35% more than traditional JPEG codecs.</b> </p>
  
<p><a href="https://github.com/libjxl/libjxl/tree/main/lib/jpegli" target="_blank">Jpegli</a> is a promising new technology that has the potential to make the internet faster and more beautiful.</p>

            <link>https://gijn.org/stories/tracking-shell-companies-secret-owners/</link>
            <guid>39919401</guid>
            <pubDate>Wed, 03 Apr 2024 16:22:12 GMT</pubDate>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://gijn.org/stories/tracking-shell-companies-secret-owners/">https://gijn.org/stories/tracking-shell-companies-secret-owners/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39919401">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>For investigative journalists, the search for the actual owners of shell companies and trusts can sometimes seem as elusive and ‚Äúfuzzy‚Äù as popular searches for UFOs. But there are powerful tools out there that can help newcomers to this complex field track breadcrumbs to people who go to great lengths to hide assets that the public should know about.</p>

<p>Shell corporations are companies that don‚Äôt actually do any business, but which are often incorporated for strategic reasons, such as legal tax avoidance for legitimate corporations ‚Äî and <a href="https://www.occrp.org/en/the-pandora-papers/is-your-neighbor-a-shell-company">also to hide the identity and assets</a> of the individuals who truly control illegitimate or sanctioned enterprises.</p>
<p>Digging into shell companies and their ultimate benefit owners (UBOs) is a specialized investigative area, represented by networks such as the <a href="https://www.icij.org/">International Consortium of Investigative Journalists</a> (ICIJ) and the <a href="https://www.occrp.org/en/component/tags/tag/icij">Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project</a> (OCCRP). The advanced techniques they use, from tracking bank transfer routes to deferred corporate prosecution agreements, could fill several books.</p>
<p>However, in a solo presentation at the recent 2024 <a href="https://www.ire.org/training/conferences/nicar-2024/">NICAR data journalism summit</a> in the US, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/karrie-kehoe-99304936/?originalSubdomain=ie">Karrie Kehoe</a>, deputy head of data and research at ICIJ, shared several tips, tools, and places to start that almost any reporter can try to track the person at the top of a shady empire ‚Äî and their overseas assets. Kehoe invited attendees to first ask themselves: What words might appear in paperwork that must be filed for these front companies? And to then experiment with possible variations of those words that could be used in corporate registries and databases. For instance, might the name of a director or owner, like Ian, appear as ‚ÄúIain‚Äù?</p>
<div id="attachment_1417393"><p><a href="https://www.icij.org/journalists/karrie-kehoe/"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1417393" src="https://gijn.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-29-at-17.19.17-336x389.png" alt="" width="250" height="289" srcset="https://gijn.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-29-at-17.19.17-336x389.png 336w, https://gijn.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-29-at-17.19.17.png 586w" sizes="(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px"></a></p><p id="caption-attachment-1417393">Karrie Kehoe, deputy head of data and research at ICIJ. Image: ICIJ</p></div>
<p>While often partly obscured by secrecy jurisdictions ‚Äî such as the British Virgin Islands, Panama, Cyprus, or Cayman Islands ‚Äî shell companies always need paperwork in order to be incorporated. Kehoe also invited reporters to think carefully about the people typically paid to fill out these forms, also known as ‚Äú<a href="https://www.occrp.org/en/29leaks/what-is-a-company-formation-agent">formation agents</a>.‚Äù It‚Äôs their job to create companies for wealthy clients in friendly legal jurisdictions, which can offer country registration fees as low as US$14. For extra fees, formation agents can also provide clients with bank accounts, ‚Äústraw man‚Äù director names, and secretarial services. But they can‚Äôt get around the basics on those forms: an official business address, real names of at least some directors, and documents about the nature of the business.</p>
<p>Searching for foreign assets of a Middle East king in 2021, Kehoe and her colleagues found that the monarch secretly owned 14 luxury homes in the UK and the US via a network of front companies in tax havens. They then got dramatic confirmation <a href="https://www.icij.org/investigations/pandora-papers/jordan-king-abdullah-luxury-property/">when the secret client‚Äôs home address was listed by formation agents</a> in registration documents as the kingdom‚Äôs ‚Äúroyal palace.‚Äù</p>
<p>Remember, she stressed, that you are always seeking the ultimate beneficial owner, rather than the director or owner names you may find early in your search.</p>
<p>‚ÄúYou could be sitting in the Netherlands, and you get your order off to a formation agent in, say, Hong Kong, and he starts setting up shells for you in the Cook Islands, Singapore, and other places,‚Äù said Kehoe, explaining one possible scenario. ‚ÄúFrom there, they will provide secretarial services, an address for you, and straw men ‚Äî in other words, figureheads. One could be listed as the director of 100 companies, and that person could be a taxi driver in Azerbaijan. He has nothing to do with this ‚Äî they may get a small bit of money; sometimes they are relatives or just people they know; sometimes they are strong-armed. But he is a body the formation agent needs.‚Äù</p>
<p>Shell companies represent one of several kinds of ‚Äúproxy‚Äù methods that people use to disguise their wealth, <a href="https://www.occrp.org/en/asset-tracker/faq-whats-a-proxy-using-relatives-shell-companies-and-other-stand-ins-to-hide-illicit-wealth">as investigative journalist Will Neal recently explained at OCCRP</a>. For more on this, see GIJN‚Äôs detailed resource for <a href="https://gijn.org/resource/researching-corporations-and-their-owners/">Researching Corporations and their Owners</a>, which includes access portals for annual reports, and links to country-specific registries, from Germany to Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Here are some of the places-to-start tips Kehoe shared at NICAR24.</p>
<p><b>Start with a quick company or person name search in </b><a href="https://opencorporates.com/"><b>OpenCorporates</b></a><b>.</b> Drawing on company records from more than 140 government registries, OpenCorporates is a vast, open database that reporters love. ‚ÄúThe first thing I do is go to this wonderful, searchable database ‚Äì it has over 220 million companies listed there,‚Äù explained Kehoe. ‚ÄúIt is wonderful for some jurisdictions; it struggles for others. For instance, you‚Äôd need to go somewhere else for Irish shell companies. If you want to look up a whole lot of companies, they do have API access too.‚Äù</p>
<div id="attachment_1417344"><p><a href="https://opencorporates.com/"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1417344" src="https://gijn.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-29-at-17.08.46-771x405.png" alt="" width="771" height="405" srcset="https://gijn.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-29-at-17.08.46-771x405.png 771w, https://gijn.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-29-at-17.08.46-336x176.png 336w, https://gijn.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-29-at-17.08.46-768x403.png 768w, https://gijn.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-29-at-17.08.46-1536x806.png 1536w, https://gijn.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-29-at-17.08.46-2048x1075.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 771px) 100vw, 771px"></a></p><p id="caption-attachment-1417344">OpenCorporates is a vast, open database drawing on company records from more than 140 government registries. Image: Screenshot, OpenCorporates</p></div>
<p><b>Consider a subscription to a corporate risk database if you hit a wall with open source tools.</b> Kehoe showed one major shell company name that got no hits on the excellent OpenCorporates database, but which got a detailed profile from a simple name search in the paid-for <a href="https://sayari.com/financial-crime/"><b>Sayari</b></a> corporate risk platform‚Äì including helpful red flag icons to show sanctions listings, and national flags to show countries associated with listed directors. ‚ÄúThis is a database I use all the time ‚Äî it‚Äôs subscription-based, but they also have some free trials,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThere are also other great paid-for corporate databases like <a href="https://login.bvdinfo.com/R0/Orbis"><b>Orbis</b></a> and <a href="https://www.dowjones.com/professional/factiva/?LS=Search&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_source=google&amp;utm_campaign=AMER-US[EN]_GGL-Brand[GEN]-FA-Factiva_MT-Exact&amp;CID=7015Y000004FylCQAS&amp;utm_term=factiva_(e)&amp;utm_content=&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjwwYSwBhDcARIsAOyL0fgmrbfqHGsRhTB984bRyKqKWwdwTOH8U7-c0br0U8gHvRNeG311DH4aAsXEEALw_wcB"><b>Factiva</b></a>.‚Äù</p>
<p><b>Put yourself in the shoes of billionaires and oligarchs.</b> Kehoe said it helps to refine database and registry searches for places and interests that appeal to the egos of oligarchs and UBOs. ‚ÄúThe thing about super wealthy people is that they‚Äôre very predictable, and, if you‚Äôre a billionaire, there is only so much stuff you can buy,‚Äù Kehoe noted. ‚ÄúThey often want luxury properties in London and the South of France; they want mega-yachts and jets and art and sports teams.‚Äù Simply identifying and searching for the wealthiest neighborhoods in certain jurisdictions, she said, can help narrow searches for hidden assets.</p>

<p><b>Use vetted investigative data in the </b><a href="https://offshoreleaks.icij.org/"><b>ICIJ Offshore Leaks Database</b></a><b>.&nbsp;</b>Many reporters don‚Äôt realize that the vast, searchable Offshore Leaks database ‚Äî with vetted information on 810,000 offshore companies, foundations, and trusts in 200 countries ‚Äî is freely available for any reporter, anywhere, to use, and to explore for new stories in their regions. ‚ÄúPlease use it,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúWe know there are more stories in all that data, and we want reporters to find them.‚Äù Compiled by ICIJ, the database has been built from previous leaks and collaborative investigations into secret offshore assets and their hidden owners, such as the Panama Papers, the Pandora Papers, the Bahamas Leaks, and the Paradise Papers projects. ‚ÄúYou can just put addresses into the search box, or the names of people or companies,‚Äù she explained. Reporters can also filter their search by the major leak investigations, which focus on different regions and jurisdictions ‚Äî so a filter for Pandora Papers, for instance, will highlight more Asia data than Panama Papers.</p>
<p>Kehoe added one note of caution: ‚ÄúJust because someone‚Äôs name appears in this database does not mean they are guilty or associated with any wrongdoing at all.

<p><b>Experiment with different spellings ‚Äî and check against Google Maps.&nbsp;</b>Using the name of her own hometown in Ireland as an example, she said reporters searching for people or assets in D√∫n Laoghaire should also try spellings such as ‚ÄúD√∫n Laoire‚Äù and ‚ÄúDunleary.‚Äù ‚ÄúIf you try different spellings for places, you‚Äôd be surprised what you come up with,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúLeaks data comes from many different languages, so if you want to find an address in Russia, there‚Äôs no point entering the word ‚Äústreet.‚Äù I recommend going to Google Maps, and, in this case, taking the Cyrillic phrase, and putting the English translation of that phrase into the search field of databases.‚Äù Even more important: use alternate spellings for the names of directors listed in corporate registries. This can be as simple as trying traditional alternatives, such as ‚ÄúAnn‚Äù and ‚ÄúAnne.‚Äù ‚ÄúBut remember that when looking at Russian names, in particular, the spellings often change ‚Äì ‚Äúi‚Äùs become ‚Äúy‚Äùs, ‚Äúx‚Äùs become ‚Äúks‚Äùs etc,‚Äù Kehoe explained.</p>
<p><b><i>Tip:</i></b> Enter addresses you find on <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=4/38.01/-95.84"><b>OpenStreetMap</b></a>, and check to see whether the director‚Äôs listed address is the mansion you‚Äôd expect, or a tiny office or apartment that could signal another false front.</p>
<p><b>Cross-search the ‚Äúnuggets‚Äù you find in other free portals.</b> Kehoe suggested the following sites as other&nbsp; useful, free resources to search for hidden cross-border business connections: <a href="https://www.openownership.org/en/"><b>Open Ownership</b></a>, the UK-based <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/register-of-overseas-entities#:~:text=Overseas%20entities%20who%20want%20to,owners%20or%20managing%20officers%20are."><b>Register of Overseas Entities</b></a>, and <a href="https://ted.europa.eu/en/news/welcome-to-the-new-ted"><b>Tenders Electronic Daily</b></a> (TED). ‚ÄúTED is amazing ‚Äî it involves public contracts for 27 EU member states, and it goes back a long time,‚Äù said Kehoe. ‚ÄúBut it can be a little tricky as it has many different languages together.‚Äù</p>
<p><b><i>Tip:</i></b> Image search for society photos of the oligarch or UBO you‚Äôre investigating with the names listed in datasets and corporate registries as company directors.</p>
<p><b>Try a family connections tool to track oligarch assets. </b>‚ÄúRussian oligarchs are the world masters of shell companies ‚Äî they‚Äôve been doing this since the 1990s, and reporters are always playing catch up,‚Äù said Kehoe. ‚ÄúThe first thing to do is to <a href="https://www.opensanctions.org/">check if they are sanctioned</a>.‚Äù</p>
<p>She suggested a website called <a href="https://rupep.org/en/"><b>RuPEP</b></a>, which profiles thousands of ‚Äúpolitically exposed persons‚Äù and sanctioned individuals in Russia, Belarus, and Kazakhstan, as well as their relatives, and their association with legal entities. She added: ‚ÄúThese kinds of databases often give you nuggets of new information, but it‚Äôs a great place to start. This has profiles for a lot of oligarchs, and the research is amazing,‚Äù said Kehoe. ‚ÄúIt gives you family members, which is important because a lot of the assets are in family members‚Äô names.‚Äù</p>
<p><b>Paperwork tends to poke holes in secrecy ‚Äî so keep digging.</b> ‚ÄúBe persistent,‚Äù Kehoe advised. ‚ÄúUltimate beneficial owners really do trust their formation agents to keep them safe from scrutiny, and share a lot of stuff with them. And so, somewhere down the line, they send in a scan of their passport or their utility bill, and their home addresses often pop up in leaks and databases that way.‚Äù</p>

</p>
</div> <p><span>In 2021, a </span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240403151726/https://books.google.co.il/books/about/The_Human_Machine_Team_How_to_Create_Syn.html?id=hjl1zgEACAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y"><span>book</span></a><span> titled ‚ÄúThe Human-Machine Team: How to Create Synergy Between Human and Artificial Intelligence That Will Revolutionize Our World‚Äù was released in English under the pen name ‚ÄúBrigadier General Y.S.‚Äù In it, the author ‚Äî a man who we confirmed to be the current commander of the elite Israeli intelligence unit 8200 ‚Äî makes the case for designing a special machine that could rapidly process massive amounts of data to generate thousands of potential ‚Äútargets‚Äù for military strikes in the heat of a war. Such technology, he writes, would resolve what he described as a ‚Äúhuman bottleneck for both locating the new targets and decision-making to approve the targets.‚Äù</span></p>
<p><span>Such a machine, it turns out, actually exists. A new investigation by +972 Magazine and Local Call reveals that the Israeli army has developed an artificial intelligence-based program known as ‚ÄúLavender,‚Äù unveiled here for the first time. According to six Israeli intelligence officers, who have all served in the army during the current war on the Gaza Strip and had first-hand involvement with the use of AI to generate targets for assassination, Lavender has played a central role in the unprecedented bombing of Palestinians, especially during the early stages of the war. In fact, according to the sources, its influence on the military‚Äôs operations was such that they essentially treated the outputs of the AI machine ‚Äúas if it were a human decision.‚Äù</span></p>
<p><span>Formally, the Lavender system is designed to mark all suspected operatives in the military wings of Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ), including low-ranking ones, as potential bombing targets. The sources told +972 and Local Call that, during the first weeks of the war, the army almost completely relied on Lavender, which clocked as many as 37,000 Palestinians as suspected militants ‚Äî and their homes ‚Äî for possible air strikes.</span></p>
<p><span>During the early stages of the war, the army gave sweeping approval for officers to adopt Lavender‚Äôs kill lists, with no requirement to thoroughly check why the machine made those choices or to examine the raw intelligence data on which they were based. One source stated that human personnel often served only as a ‚Äúrubber stamp‚Äù for the machine‚Äôs decisions, adding that, normally, they would personally devote only about ‚Äú20 seconds‚Äù to each target before authorizing a bombing ‚Äî just to make sure the Lavender-marked target is male. This was despite knowing that the system makes what are regarded as ‚Äúerrors‚Äù in approximately 10 percent of cases, and is known to occasionally mark individuals who have merely a loose connection to militant groups, or no connection at all.</span></p>
<p><span>Moreover, the Israeli army systematically attacked the targeted individuals while they were in their homes ‚Äî usually at night while their whole families were present ‚Äî rather than during the course of military activity. According to the sources, this was because, from what they regarded as an intelligence standpoint, it was easier to locate the individuals in their private houses. Additional automated systems, including one called ‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs Daddy?‚Äù also revealed here for the first time, were used specifically to track the targeted individuals and carry out bombings when they had entered their family‚Äôs residences.</span></p>

</div>
<p><span>The result, as the sources testified, is that thousands of Palestinians ‚Äî most of them women and children or people who were not involved in the fighting ‚Äî were wiped out by Israeli airstrikes, especially during the first weeks of the war, because of the AI program‚Äôs decisions.</span></p>
<p><span>‚ÄúWe were not interested in killing [Hamas] operatives only when they were in a military building or engaged in a military activity,‚Äù A., an intelligence officer, told +972 and Local Call. ‚ÄúOn the contrary, the IDF bombed them in homes without hesitation, as a first option. It‚Äôs much easier to bomb a family‚Äôs home. The system is built to look for them in these situations.‚Äù</span></p>
<p><span>The Lavender machine joins another AI system, ‚ÄúThe Gospel,‚Äù about which information was revealed in a </span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240403151726/https://www.972mag.com/mass-assassination-factory-israel-calculated-bombing-gaza/"><span>previous investigation</span></a><span> by +972 and Local Call in November 2023, as well as in the Israeli military‚Äôs own </span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240403151726/https://www.israeldefense.co.il/node/57256#google_vignette"><span>publications</span></a><span>. A fundamental difference between the two systems is in the definition of the target: whereas The Gospel marks buildings and structures that the army claims militants operate from, Lavender marks people ‚Äî and puts them on a kill list.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In addition, according to the sources, when it came to targeting alleged junior militants marked by Lavender, the army preferred to only use unguided missiles, commonly known as ‚Äúdumb‚Äù bombs (in contrast to ‚Äúsmart‚Äù precision bombs), which can destroy entire buildings on top of their occupants and cause significant casualties. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt want to waste expensive bombs on unimportant people ‚Äî it‚Äôs very expensive for the country and there‚Äôs a shortage [of those bombs],‚Äù said C., one of the intelligence officers. Another source said that they had personally authorized the bombing of ‚Äúhundreds‚Äù of private homes of alleged junior operatives marked by Lavender, with many of these attacks killing civilians and entire families as ‚Äúcollateral damage.‚Äù</span></p>
<p><span>In an unprecedented move, according to two of the sources, the army also decided during the first weeks of the war that, for every junior Hamas operative that Lavender marked, it was permissible to kill up to 15 or 20 civilians; in the past, the military did not authorize any ‚Äúcollateral damage‚Äù during assassinations of low-ranking militants. The sources added that, in the event that the target was a senior Hamas official with the rank of battalion or brigade commander, the army on several occasions authorized the killing of more than 100 civilians in the assassination of a single commander.</span></p>

</div>
<p><span>The following investigation is organized according to the six chronological stages of the Israeli army‚Äôs highly automated target production in the early weeks of the Gaza war. First, we explain the Lavender machine itself, which marked tens of thousands of Palestinians using AI. Second, we reveal the ‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs Daddy?‚Äù system, which tracked these targets and signaled to the army when they entered their family homes. Third, we describe how ‚Äúdumb‚Äù bombs were chosen to strike these homes.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Fourth, we explain how the army loosened the permitted number of civilians who could be killed during the bombing of a target. Fifth, we note how automated software inaccurately calculated the amount of non-combatants in each household. And sixth, we show how on several occasions, when a home was struck, usually at night, the individual target was sometimes not inside at all, because military officers did not verify the information in real time.</span></p>
<h3><span>STEP 1: GENERATING TARGETS</span></h3>
<h3>‚ÄòOnce you go automatic, target generation goes crazy‚Äô</h3>
<p><span>In the Israeli army, the term ‚Äúhuman target‚Äù referred in the past to a senior military operative who, according to the rules of the military‚Äôs International Law Department, can be killed in their private home even if there are civilians around. Intelligence sources told +972 and Local Call that during Israel‚Äôs previous wars, since this was an ‚Äúespecially brutal‚Äù way to kill someone ‚Äî often by killing an entire family alongside the target ‚Äî such human targets were marked very carefully and only senior military commanders were bombed in their homes, to maintain the principle of proportionality under international law.</span></p>
<p><span>But after October 7 ‚Äî when Hamas-led militants launched a deadly assault on southern Israeli communities, killing around 1,200 people and abducting 240 ‚Äî the army, the sources said, took a dramatically different approach. Under ‚ÄúOperation Iron Swords,‚Äù the army decided to designate all operatives of Hamas‚Äô military wing as human targets, regardless of their rank or military importance. And that changed everything.</span></p>
<p><span>The new policy also posed a technical problem for Israeli intelligence. In previous wars, in order to authorize the assassination of a single human target, an officer had to go through a complex and lengthy ‚Äúincrimination‚Äù process: cross-check evidence that the person was indeed a senior member of Hamas‚Äô military wing, find out where he lived, his contact information, and finally know when he was home in real time. When the list of targets numbered only a few dozen senior operatives, intelligence personnel could individually handle the work involved in incriminating and locating them.</span></p>
<div id="attachment_177464"><p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240403151726/https://static.972mag.com/www/uploads/2024/04/main_image51785_4WLiR7887N.jpg" data-featherlight="image"><img title="Palestinians try to rescue survivors and pull bodies from the rubble after Israeli airstrikes hit buildings near Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in Deir al-Balah, central Gaza, October 22, 2023.

</div>
<p><span>However, once the list was expanded to include tens of thousands of lower-ranking operatives, the Israeli army figured it had to rely on automated software and artificial intelligence. The result, the sources testify, was that the role of human personnel in incriminating Palestinians as military operatives was pushed aside, and AI did most of the work instead. According to four of the sources who spoke to +972 and Local Call, Lavender ‚Äî which was developed to create human targets in the current war ‚Äî has marked some 37,000 Palestinians as suspected ‚ÄúHamas militants,‚Äù most of them junior, for assassination (the IDF Spokesperson denied the existence of such a kill list in a statement to +972 and Local Call).</span></p>
<p><span>‚ÄúWe didn‚Äôt know who the junior operatives were, because Israel didn‚Äôt track them routinely [before the war],‚Äù explained senior officer B. to +972 and Local Call, illuminating the reason behind the development of this particular target machine for the current war. ‚ÄúThey wanted to allow us to attack [the junior operatives] automatically. That‚Äôs the Holy Grail. Once you go automatic, target generation goes crazy.‚Äù</span></p>
<p><span>The sources said that the approval to automatically adopt Lavender‚Äôs kill lists, which had previously been used only as an auxiliary tool, was granted about two weeks into the war, after intelligence personnel ‚Äúmanually‚Äù checked the accuracy of a random sample of several hundred targets selected by the AI system. When that sample found that Lavender‚Äôs results had reached 90 percent accuracy in identifying an individual‚Äôs affiliation with Hamas, the army authorized the sweeping use of the system. From that moment, sources said that if Lavender decided an individual was a militant in Hamas, they were essentially asked to treat that as an order, with no requirement to independently check why the machine made that choice or to examine the raw intelligence data on which it is based.</span></p>
<p><span>‚ÄúAt 5 a.m., </span><span>[the air force]</span><span> would come and bomb all the houses that we had marked,‚Äù B. said. ‚ÄúWe took out thousands of people. We didn‚Äôt go through them one by one ‚Äî we put everything into automated systems, and as soon as one of [the marked individuals] was at home, he immediately became a target. We bombed him and his house.‚Äù</span></p>
<p><span>The deadly results of this loosening of restrictions in the early stage of the war were staggering. According to data from the Palestinian Health Ministry in Gaza, on which the Israeli army has </span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240403151726/https://www.mekomit.co.il/%d7%94%d7%a6%d7%91%d7%90-%d7%91%d7%93%d7%a7-%d7%95%d7%9e%d7%a6%d7%90-%d7%a9%d7%93%d7%99%d7%95%d7%95%d7%97%d7%99-%d7%94%d7%94%d7%a8%d7%95%d7%92%d7%99%d7%9d-%d7%91%d7%9e%d7%a9%d7%a8%d7%93-%d7%94%d7%91/"><span>relied almost exclusively</span></a><span> since the beginning of the war, Israel killed some 15,000 Palestinians ‚Äî almost half of the death toll so far ‚Äî in the </span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240403151726/https://www.ochaopt.org/content/hostilities-gaza-strip-and-israel-flash-update-50"><span>first six weeks</span></a><span> of the war, up until a week-long ceasefire was agreed on Nov. 24.</span></p>

<h3>‚ÄòThe more information and variety, the better‚Äô</h3>
<p><span>The Lavender software analyzes information collected on most of the 2.3 million residents of the Gaza Strip through a system of mass surveillance, then assesses and ranks the likelihood that each particular person is active in the military wing of Hamas or PIJ. According to sources, the machine gives almost every single person in Gaza a rating from 1 to 100, expressing how likely it is that they are a militant.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Lavender learns to identify characteristics of known Hamas and PIJ operatives, whose information was fed to the machine as training data, and then to locate these same characteristics ‚Äî also called ‚Äúfeatures‚Äù ‚Äî among the general population, the sources explained. An individual found to have several different incriminating features will reach a high rating, and thus automatically becomes a potential target for assassination.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In ‚ÄúThe Human-Machine Team,‚Äù the book referenced at the beginning of this article, the current commander of Unit 8200 advocates for such a system without referencing Lavender by name. (The commander himself also isn‚Äôt named, but five sources in 8200 confirmed that the commander is the author, as </span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240403151726/https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2021-10-01/ty-article/.highlight/top-israeli-intel-officer-goes-where-no-ones-gone-before-and-its-all-on-amazon/0000017f-e1fb-df7c-a5ff-e3fb21210000"><span>reported</span></a><span> also by Haaretz.) Describing human personnel as a ‚Äúbottleneck‚Äù that limits the army‚Äôs capacity during a military operation, The commander laments: ‚ÄúWe [humans] cannot process so much information. It doesn‚Äôt matter how many people you have tasked to produce targets during the war ‚Äî you still cannot produce enough targets per day.‚Äù</span></p>
<p><span>The solution to this problem, he says, is artificial intelligence. The book offers a short guide to building a ‚Äútarget machine,‚Äù similar in description to Lavender, based on AI and machine-learning algorithms. Included in this guide are several examples of the ‚Äúhundreds and thousands‚Äù of features that can increase an individual‚Äôs rating, such as being in a Whatsapp group with a known militant, changing cell phone every few months, and changing addresses frequently.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>‚ÄúThe more information, and the more variety, the better,‚Äù the commander writes. ‚ÄúVisual information, cellular information, social media connections, battlefield information, phone contacts, photos.‚Äù While humans select these features at first, the commander continues, over time the machine will come to identify features on its own. This, he says, can enable militaries to create ‚Äútens of thousands of targets,‚Äù while the actual decision as to whether or not to attack them will remain a human one.</span></p>
<p><span>The book isn‚Äôt the only time a senior Israeli commander hinted at the existence of human target machines like Lavender. +972 and Local Call have obtained footage of a private lecture given by the commander of Unit 8200‚Äôs secretive Data Science and AI center, ‚ÄúCol. Yoav,‚Äù at Tel Aviv University‚Äôs AI week in 2023, which was </span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240403151726/https://www.geektime.co.il/idf-fights-hamas-with-ai-and-data-science/"><span>reported on</span></a><span> at the time in the Israeli media.</span></p>
<p><span>In the lecture, the commander speaks about a new, sophisticated target machine used by the Israeli army that detects ‚Äúdangerous people‚Äù based on their likeness to existing lists of known militants on which it was trained. ‚ÄúUsing the system, we managed to identify Hamas missile squad commanders,‚Äù Col. Yoav said in the lecture, referring to Israel‚Äôs May 2021 military operation in Gaza, when the machine was used for the first time.&nbsp;</span></p>

</div>
<p><span>The lecture presentation slides, also obtained by +972 and Local Call, contain illustrations of how the machine works: it is fed data about existing Hamas operatives, it learns to notice their features, and then it rates other Palestinians based on how similar they are to the militants.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>‚ÄúWe rank the results and determine the threshold [at which to attack a target],‚Äù Col. Yoav said in the lecture, emphasizing that ‚Äúeventually, people of flesh and blood take the decisions. In the defense realm, ethically speaking, we put a lot of emphasis on this. These tools are meant to help [intelligence officers] break their barriers.‚Äù&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In practice, however, sources who have used Lavender in recent months say human agency and precision were substituted for mass target creation and lethality.</span></p>
<h3>‚ÄòThere was no ‚Äúzero-error‚Äù policy‚Äô</h3>
<p><span>B., a senior officer who used Lavender, echoed to +972 and Local Call that in the current war, officers were not required to independently review the AI system‚Äôs assessments, in order to save time and enable the mass production of human targets without hindrances.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>‚ÄúEverything was statistical, everything was neat ‚Äî it was very dry,‚Äù B. said. He noted that this lack of supervision was permitted despite internal checks showing that Lavender‚Äôs calculations were considered accurate only 90 percent of the time; in other words, it was known in advance that 10 percent of the human targets slated for assassination were not members of the Hamas military wing at all.</span></p>
<p><span>For example, sources explained that the Lavender machine sometimes mistakenly flagged individuals who had communication patterns similar to known Hamas or PIJ operatives ‚Äî including police and civil defense workers, militants‚Äô relatives, residents who happened to have a name and nickname identical to that of an operative, and Gazans who used a device that once belonged to a Hamas operative.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>‚ÄúHow close does a person have to be to Hamas to be [considered by an AI machine to be] affiliated with the organization?‚Äù said one source critical of Lavender‚Äôs inaccuracy. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a vague boundary. Is a person who doesn‚Äôt receive a salary from Hamas, but helps them with all sorts of things, a Hamas operative? Is someone who was in Hamas in the past, but is no longer there today, a Hamas operative? Each of these features ‚Äî characteristics that a machine would flag as suspicious ‚Äî is inaccurate.‚Äù</span></p>

</div>
<p><span>Similar problems exist with the ability of target machines to assess the phone used by an individual marked for assassination. ‚ÄúIn war, Palestinians change phones all the time,‚Äù said the source. ‚ÄúPeople lose contact with their families, give their phone to a friend or a wife, maybe lose it. There is no way to rely 100 percent on the automatic mechanism that determines which [phone] number belongs to whom.‚Äù</span></p>
<p><span>According to the sources, the army knew that the minimal human supervision in place would not discover these faults. ‚ÄúThere was no ‚Äòzero-error‚Äô policy. Mistakes were treated statistically,‚Äù said a source who used Lavender. ‚ÄúBecause of the scope and magnitude, the protocol was that even if you don‚Äôt know for sure that the machine is right, you know that statistically it‚Äôs fine. So you go for it.‚Äù</span></p>
<p><span>‚ÄúIt has proven itself,‚Äù said B., the senior source. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs something about the statistical approach that sets you to a certain norm and standard. There has been an illogical amount of [bombings] in this operation. This is unparalleled, in my memory. And I have much more trust in a statistical mechanism than a soldier who lost a friend two days ago. Everyone there, including me, lost people on October 7. The machine did it coldly. And that made it easier.‚Äù</span></p>
<p><span>Another intelligence source, who defended the reliance on the Lavender-generated kill lists of Palestinian suspects, argued that it was worth investing an intelligence officer‚Äôs time only to verify the information if the target was a senior commander in Hamas. ‚ÄúBut when it comes to a junior militant, you don‚Äôt want to invest manpower and time in it,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIn war, there is no time to incriminate every target. So you‚Äôre willing to take the margin of error of using artificial intelligence, risking collateral damage and civilians dying, and risking attacking by mistake, and to live with it.‚Äù</span></p>
<p>B. said that the reason for this automation was a constant push to generate more targets for assassination. ‚ÄúIn a day without targets [whose feature rating was sufficient to authorize a strike], we attacked at a lower threshold. We were constantly being pressured: ‚ÄòBring us more targets.‚Äô They really shouted at us. We finished [killing] our targets very quickly.‚Äù</p>
<p><span>He explained that when lowering the rating threshold of Lavender, it would mark more people as targets for strikes. ‚ÄúAt its peak, the system managed to generate 37,000 people as potential human targets,‚Äù said B. ‚ÄúBut the numbers changed all the time, because it depends on where you set the bar of what a Hamas operative is. There were times when a Hamas operative was defined more broadly, and then the machine started bringing us all kinds of civil defense personnel, police officers, on whom it would be a shame to waste bombs. They help the Hamas government, but they don‚Äôt really endanger soldiers.‚Äù</span></p>

<h3>‚ÄòWe only checked that the target was a man‚Äô</h3>
<p><span>The Israeli military flatly rejects these claims. In a statement to +972 and Local Call, the IDF Spokesperson denied using artificial intelligence to incriminate targets, saying these are merely ‚Äúauxiliary tools that assist officers in the process of incrimination.‚Äù The statement went on: ‚ÄúIn any case, an independent examination by an [intelligence] analyst is required, which verifies that the identified targets are legitimate targets for attack, in accordance with the conditions set forth in IDF directives and international law.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>However, sources said that the only human supervision protocol in place before bombing the houses of suspected ‚Äújunior‚Äù militants marked by Lavender was to conduct a single check: ensuring that the AI-selected target is male rather than female. The assumption in the army was that if it were a woman, the machine had likely made a mistake, because there are no women among the ranks of the military wings of Hamas and PIJ.</span></p>
<p><span>‚ÄúA human being had to [verify the target] for just a few seconds,‚Äù B. said, explaining that this became the protocol after realizing the Lavender system was ‚Äúgetting it right‚Äù most of the time. ‚ÄúAt first, we did checks to ensure that the machine didn‚Äôt get confused. But at some point we relied on the automatic system, and we only checked that [the target] was a man ‚Äî that was enough. It doesn‚Äôt take a long time to tell if someone has a male or a female voice.‚Äù&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To conduct the male/female check, B. claimed that in the current war, ‚ÄúI would invest 20 seconds for each target at this stage, and do dozens of them every day. I had zero added value as a human, apart from being a stamp of approval. It saved a lot of time. If [the operative] came up in the automated mechanism, and I checked that he was a man, there would be permission to bomb him, subject to an examination of collateral damage.‚Äù</span></p>

<p><span>In practice, sources said this meant that for civilian men marked in error by Lavender, there was no supervising mechanism in place to detect the mistake.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><span>STEP 2: LINKING TARGETS TO FAMILY HOMES</span></h3>
<h3>‚ÄòMost of the people you killed were women and children‚Äô</h3>
<p><span>The next stage in the Israeli army‚Äôs assassination procedure is identifying where to attack the targets that Lavender generates.</span></p>
<p><span>In a statement to +972 and Local Call, the IDF Spokesperson claimed in response to this article that ‚ÄúHamas places its operatives and military assets in the heart of the civilian population, systematically uses the civilian population as human shields, and conducts fighting from within civilian structures, including sensitive sites such as hospitals, mosques, schools and UN facilities. The IDF is bound by and acts according to international law, directing its attacks only at military targets and military operatives.‚Äù&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The six sources we spoke to echoed this to some degree, saying that Hamas‚Äô extensive </span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240403151726/https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/02/12/world/middleeast/gaza-tunnel-israel-hamas.html"><span>tunnel system</span></a><span> deliberately passes under hospitals and schools; that Hamas militants use ambulances to get around; and that countless military assets have been situated near civilian buildings. The sources argued that many Israeli strikes kill civilians as a result of these tactics by Hamas ‚Äî a characterization that human rights groups <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240403151726/https://www.hrw.org/news/2024/03/19/israeli-forces-conduct-gaza">warn</a> evades Israel‚Äôs onus for inflicting the casualties.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>However, in contrast to the Israeli army‚Äôs official statements, the sources explained that a major reason for the unprecedented death toll from Israel‚Äôs current bombardment is the fact that the army has systematically attacked targets in their private homes, alongside their families ‚Äî in part because it was easier from an intelligence standpoint to mark family houses using automated systems.</span></p>
<p><span>Indeed, several sources emphasized that, as opposed to numerous cases of Hamas operatives engaging in military activity from civilian areas, in the case of systematic assassination strikes, the army routinely made the active choice to bomb suspected militants when inside civilian households from which no military activity took place. This choice, they said, was a reflection of the way Israel‚Äôs system of mass surveillance in Gaza is designed.</span></p>

</div>
<p><span>The sources told +972 and Local Call that since everyone in Gaza had a private house with which they could be associated, the army‚Äôs surveillance systems could easily and automatically ‚Äúlink‚Äù individuals to family houses. In order to identify the moment operatives enter their houses in real time, various additional automatic softwares have been developed. These programs track thousands of individuals simultaneously, identify when they are at home, and send an automatic alert to the targeting officer, who then marks the house for bombing. One of several of these tracking softwares, revealed here for the first time, is called ‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs Daddy?‚Äù&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>‚ÄúYou put hundreds [of targets] into the system and wait to see who you can kill,‚Äù said one source with knowledge of the system. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs called broad hunting: you copy-paste from the lists that the target system produces.‚Äù</span></p>
<p><span>Evidence of this policy is also clear from the data: during the first month of the war, more than half of the fatalities ‚Äî 6,120 people ‚Äî belonged to 1,340 families, many of which were completely wiped out while inside their homes, according to </span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240403151726/https://www.ochaopt.org/content/hostilities-gaza-strip-and-israel-reported-impact-day-45"><span>UN figures</span></a><span>. The proportion of entire </span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240403151726/https://www.972mag.com/gaza-families-bombing-humanitarian-crisis/"><span>families</span></a><span> bombed in their houses in the current war is much higher </span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240403151726/https://www.btselem.org/download/201501_black_flag_eng.pdf"><span>than in the 2014 Israeli operation</span></a><span> in Gaza, further suggesting the prominence of this policy.</span></p>
<p><span>Another source said that each time the pace of assassinations waned, more targets were added to systems like Where‚Äôs Daddy? to locate individuals that entered their homes and could therefore be bombed. He said that the decision of who to put into the tracking systems could be made by relatively low-ranking officers in the military hierarchy.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>‚ÄúOne day, totally of my own accord, I added something like 1,200 new targets to the [tracking] system, because the number of attacks [we were conducting] decreased,‚Äù the source said. ‚ÄúThat made sense to me. In retrospect, it seems like a serious decision I made. And such decisions were not made at high levels.‚Äù</span></p>
<p><span>The sources said that in the first two weeks of the war, ‚Äúseveral thousand‚Äù targets were initially inputted into locating programs like Where‚Äôs Daddy?. These included all the members of Hamas‚Äô elite special forces unit the Nukhba, all of Hamas‚Äô anti-tank operatives, and anyone who entered Israel on October 7. But before long, the kill list was drastically expanded.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>‚ÄúIn the end it was everyone [marked by Lavender],‚Äù one source explained. ‚ÄúTens of thousands. This happened a few weeks later, when the [Israeli] brigades entered Gaza, and there were already fewer uninvolved people [i.e. civilians] in the northern areas.‚Äù According to this source, even some minors were marked by Lavender as targets for bombing. ‚ÄúNormally, operatives are over the age of 17, but that was not a condition.‚Äù</span></p>

</div>
<p><span>Lavender and systems like Where‚Äôs Daddy? were thus combined with deadly effect, killing entire families, sources said. By adding a name from the Lavender-generated lists to the Where‚Äôs Daddy? home tracking system, A. explained, the marked person would be placed under ongoing surveillance, and could be attacked as soon as they set foot in their home, collapsing the house on everyone inside.</span></p>
<p><span>‚ÄúLet‚Äôs say you calculate [that there is one] Hamas [operative] plus 10 [civilians in the house],‚Äù A. said. ‚ÄúUsually, these 10 will be women and children. So absurdly, it turns out that most of the people you killed were women and children.‚Äù</span></p>
<h3><span>STEP 3: CHOOSING A WEAPON</span></h3>
<h3>‚ÄòWe usually carried out the attacks with ‚Äúdumb bombs‚Äù‚Äô</h3>
<p><span>Once Lavender has marked a target for assassination, army personnel have verified that they are male, and tracking software has located the target in their home, the next stage is picking the munition with which to bomb them.</span></p>
<p><span>In December 2023, </span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240403151726/https://edition.cnn.com/2023/12/13/politics/intelligence-assessment-dumb-bombs-israel-gaza/index.html"><span>CNN reported</span></a> <span>that according to U.S. intelligence estimates, about 45 percent of the munitions used by the Israeli air force in Gaza were ‚Äúdumb‚Äù bombs, which are known to cause more collateral damage than guided bombs. In response to the CNN report, an army spokesperson quoted in the article said: ‚ÄúA</span><span>s a military committed to international law and a moral code of conduct, we are devoting vast resources to minimizing harm to the civilians that Hamas has forced into the role of human shields. Our war is against Hamas, not against the people of Gaza.‚Äù</span></p>
<p><span>Three intelligence sources, however, told +972 and Local Call that junior operatives marked by Lavender were assassinated only with dumb bombs, in the interest of saving more expensive armaments. The implication, one source explained, was that the army would not strike a junior target if they lived in a high-rise building, because the army did not want to spend a more precise and expensive ‚Äúfloor bomb‚Äù (with more limited collateral effect) to kill him. But if a junior target lived in a building with only a few floors, the army was authorized to kill him and everyone in the building with a dumb bomb.</span></p>

<p><span>‚ÄúIt was like that with all the junior targets,‚Äù testified C., who used various automated programs in the current war. ‚ÄúThe only question was, is it possible to attack the building in terms of collateral damage? Because we usually carried out the attacks with dumb bombs, and that meant literally destroying the whole house on top of its occupants. But even if an attack is averted, you don‚Äôt care ‚Äî you immediately move on to the next target. Because of the system, the targets never end. You have another 36,000 waiting.‚Äù</span></p>
<h3><span>STEP 4: AUTHORIZING CIVILIAN CASUALTIES</span></h3>
<h3>‚ÄòWe attacked almost without considering collateral damage‚Äô</h3>
<p><span>One source said that when attacking junior operatives, including those marked by AI systems like Lavender, the number of civilians they were allowed to kill alongside each target was fixed during the initial weeks of the war at up to 20. Another source claimed the fixed number was up to 15. These ‚Äúcollateral damage degrees,‚Äù as the military calls them, were applied broadly to all suspected junior militants, the sources said, regardless of their rank, military importance, and age, and with no specific case-by-case examination to weigh the military advantage of assassinating them against the expected harm to civilians.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>According to A., who was an officer in a target operation room in the current war, the army‚Äôs international law department has never before given such ‚Äúsweeping approval‚Äù for such a high collateral damage degree. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not just that you can kill any person who is a Hamas soldier, which is clearly permitted and legitimate in terms of international law,‚Äù A. said. ‚ÄúBut they directly tell you: ‚ÄòYou are allowed to kill them along with many civilians.‚Äô&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>‚ÄúEvery person who wore a Hamas uniform in the past year or two could be bombed with 20 [civilians killed as] collateral damage, even without special permission,‚Äù A. continued. ‚ÄúIn practice, the principle of proportionality did not exist.‚Äù</span></p>
<p><span>According to A., this was the policy for most of the time that he served. Only later did the military lower the collateral damage degree. ‚ÄúIn this calculation, it could also be 20 children for a junior operative ‚Ä¶ It really wasn‚Äôt like that in the past,‚Äù A. explained. Asked about the security rationale behind this policy, A. replied: ‚ÄúLethality.‚Äù</span></p>

</div>
<p><span>The predetermined and fixed collateral damage degree helped accelerate the mass creation of targets using the Lavender machine, sources said, because it saved time. B. claimed that the number of civilians they were permitted to kill per suspected junior militant marked by AI in the first week of the war, was fifteen, but that this number ‚Äúwent up and down‚Äù over time.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>‚ÄúAt first we attacked almost without considering collateral damage,‚Äù B. said of the first week after October 7. ‚ÄúIn practice, you didn‚Äôt really count people [in each house that is bombed], because you couldn‚Äôt really tell if they‚Äôre at home or not. After a week, restrictions on collateral damage began. The number dropped [from 15] to five, which made it really difficult for us to attack, because if the whole family was home, we couldn‚Äôt bomb it. Then they raised the number again.‚Äù</span></p>
<h3>‚ÄòWe knew we would kill over 100 civilians‚Äô</h3>
<p><span>Sources told +972 and Local Call that now, partly due to American pressure, the Israeli army is no longer mass-generating junior human targets for bombing in civilian homes. The fact that most homes in the Gaza Strip were already destroyed or damaged, and almost the entire population has been displaced, also impaired the army‚Äôs ability to rely on intelligence databases and automated house-locating programs.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>E. claimed that the massive bombardment of junior militants took place only in the first week or two of the war, and then was stopped mainly so as not to waste bombs. ‚ÄúThere is a munitions economy,‚Äù E. said. ‚ÄúThey were always afraid that there would be [a war] in the northern arena [with Hezbollah in Lebanon]. They don‚Äôt attack these kinds of [junior] people at all anymore.‚Äù&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>However, airstrikes against senior ranking Hamas commanders are still ongoing, and sources said that for these attacks, the military is authorizing the killing of ‚Äúhundreds‚Äù of civilians per target ‚Äî an official policy for which there is no historical precedent in Israel, or even in recent U.S. military operations.</span></p>
<p><span>‚ÄúIn the bombing of the commander of the Shuja‚Äôiya Battalion, we knew that we would kill over 100 civilians,‚Äù B. recalled of a Dec. 2 bombing that the IDF Spokesperson </span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240403151726/https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/idf-strike-kills-gazan-terrorist-responsible-for-attack-that-killed-oron-shaul-in-2014/"><span>said</span></a><span> was aimed at assassinating Wisam Farhat. ‚ÄúFor me, psychologically, it was unusual. Over 100 civilians ‚Äî it crosses some red line.‚Äù</span></p>

<p><span>Amjad Al-Sheikh, a young Palestinian from Gaza, said many of his family members were killed in that bombing. A resident of Shuja‚Äôiya, east of Gaza City, he was at a local supermarket that day when he heard five blasts that shattered the glass windows.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>‚ÄúI ran to my family‚Äôs house, but there were no buildings there anymore,‚Äù Al-Sheikh told +972 and Local Call. ‚ÄúThe street was filled with screams and smoke. Entire residential blocks turned to mountains of rubble and deep pits. People began to search in the cement, using their hands, and so did I, looking for signs of my family‚Äôs house.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Al-Sheikh‚Äôs wife and baby daughter survived ‚Äî protected from the rubble by a closet that fell on top of them ‚Äî but he found 11 other members of his family, among them his sisters, brothers, and their young children, dead under the rubble. </span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240403151726/https://www.btselem.org/hebrew/gaza_strip/20231205_israel_is_not_fighting_against_hamas_but_against_civilians_implementing_a_criminal_policy_of_bombings"><span>According to</span></a><span> the human rights group B‚ÄôTselem, the bombing that day destroyed dozens of buildings, killed dozens of people, and buried hundreds under the ruins of their homes.</span></p>
<h3>‚ÄòEntire families were killed‚Äô</h3>
<p><span>Intelligence sources told +972 and Local Call they took part in even deadlier strikes. In order to assassinate Ayman Nofal, the commander of Hamas‚Äô Central Gaza Brigade, a source said the army authorized the killing of approximately 300 civilians, </span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240403151726/https://www.ynet.co.il/news/article/ryxl6b2116"><span>destroying several buildings</span></a><span> in airstrikes on Al-Bureij refugee camp on Oct. 17 based on an imprecise pinpointing of Nofal. Satellite footage and </span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240403151726/https://twitter.com/Roaastudies/status/1714253580792643820"><span>videos</span></a><span> from the scene show the destruction of several large multi-storey apartment buildings.</span></p>
<p><span>‚ÄúBetween 16 to 18 houses were wiped out in the attack,‚Äù Amro Al-Khatib, a resident of the camp, told +972 and Local Call. ‚ÄúWe couldn‚Äôt tell one apartment from the other ‚Äî they all got mixed up in the rubble, and we found human body parts everywhere.‚Äù</span></p>
<p><span>In the aftermath, Al-Khatib recalled around 50 dead bodies being pulled out of the rubble, and around 200 people wounded, many of them gravely. But that was just the first day. The camp‚Äôs residents spent five days pulling the dead and injured out, he said.</span></p>

<p><span>Nael Al-Bahisi, a paramedic, was one of the first on the scene. He counted between 50-70 casualties on that first day. ‚ÄúAt a certain moment, we understood the target of the strike was Hamas commander Ayman Nofal,‚Äù he told +972 and Local Call. ‚ÄúThey killed him, and also many people who didn‚Äôt know he was there. Entire families with children were killed.‚Äù</span></p>
<p><span>Another intelligence source told +972 and Local Call that the army </span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240403151726/https://www.israelhayom.co.il/news/defense/article/14992654"><span>destroyed a high-rise building</span></a><span> in Rafah in mid-December, killing ‚Äúdozens of civilians,‚Äù in order </span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240403151726/https://www.israelhayom.co.il/news/defense/article/14992654"><span>to try to kill</span></a><span> Mohammed Shabaneh, the commander of Hamas‚Äô Rafah Brigade (it is not clear whether or not he was killed in the attack). Often, the source said, the senior commanders hide in tunnels that pass under civilian buildings, and therefore the choice to assassinate them with an airstrike necessarily kills civilians.</span></p>
<p><span>‚ÄúMost of those injured were children,‚Äù said Wael Al-Sir, 55, who witnessed the large-scale strike believed by some Gazans to have been the assassination attempt. He told +972 and Local Call that the bombing on Dec. 20 destroyed an ‚Äúentire residential block‚Äù and killed at least 10 children.</span></p>
<p><span>‚ÄúThere was a completely permissive policy regarding the casualties of [bombing] operations ‚Äî so permissive that in my opinion it had an element of revenge,‚Äù D., an intelligence source, claimed. ‚ÄúThe core of this was the assassinations of senior [Hamas and PIJ commanders] for whom they were willing to kill hundreds of civilians. We had a calculation: how many for a brigade commander, how many for a battalion commander, and so on.‚Äù</span></p>
<p><span>‚ÄúThere were regulations, but they were just very lenient,‚Äù said E., another intelligence source. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve killed people with collateral damage in the high double digits, if not low triple digits. These are things that haven‚Äôt happened before.‚Äù</span></p>

<p><span>Such a high rate of ‚Äúcollateral damage‚Äù is exceptional not only compared to what the Israeli army previously deemed acceptable, but also compared to the wars waged by the United States in Iraq, Syria, and Afghanistan.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>General Peter Gersten, </span><span>Deputy Commander for Operations and Intelligence </span><span>in the operation to fight ISIS in Iraq and Syria, </span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240403151726/https://www.defensedaily.com/pentagon-removed-non-combatant-casualty-cut-off-value-doctrine-2018/pentagon/"><span>told</span></a><span> a U.S. defense magazine in 2021 that an attack with collateral damage of 15 civilians deviated from procedure; to carry it out, he had to obtain special permission from the head of the U.S. Central Command, General Lloyd Austin, who is now Secretary of Defense.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>‚ÄúWith Osama Bin Laden, you‚Äôd have an NCV [Non-combatant Casualty Value] of 30, but if you had a low-level commander, his NCV was typically zero,‚Äù Gersten said. ‚ÄúWe ran zero for the longest time.‚Äù</span></p>
<h3>‚ÄòWe were told: ‚ÄúWhatever you can, bomb‚Äù‚Äô</h3>
<p><span>All the sources interviewed for this investigation said that Hamas‚Äô massacres on October 7 and kidnapping of hostages greatly influenced the army‚Äôs fire policy and collateral damage degrees. ‚ÄúAt first, the atmosphere was painful and vindictive,‚Äù said B., who was drafted into the army immediately after October 7, and served in a target operation room. ‚ÄúThe rules were very lenient. They took down four buildings when they knew the target was in one of them. It was crazy.</span></p>
<p><span>‚ÄúThere was a dissonance: on the one hand, people here were frustrated that we were not attacking enough,‚Äù B. continued. ‚ÄúOn the other hand, you see at the end of the day that another thousand Gazans have died, most of them civilians.‚Äù</span></p>
<p><span>‚ÄúThere was hysteria in the professional ranks,‚Äù said D., who was also drafted immediately after October 7. ‚ÄúThey had no idea how to react at all. The only thing they knew to do was to just start bombing like madmen to try to dismantle Hamas‚Äô capabilities.‚Äù</span></p>
<div id="attachment_174647"><p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240403151726/https://static.972mag.com/www/uploads/2023/10/F231019CG008.jpg" data-featherlight="image"><img title="Defence Minister Yoav Gallant speaks with Israeli soldiers at a staging area not far from the Gaza fence, October 19, 2023.

</div>
<p>D. stressed that they were not explicitly told that the army‚Äôs goal was ‚Äúrevenge,‚Äù but expressed that ‚Äúas soon as every target connected to Hamas becomes legitimate, and with almost any collateral damage being approved, it is clear to you that thousands of people are going to be killed. Even if officially every target is connected to Hamas, when the policy is so permissive, it loses all meaning.‚Äù</p>
<p><span>A. also used the word ‚Äúrevenge‚Äù to describe the atmosphere inside the army after October 7. ‚ÄúNo one thought about what to do afterward, when the war is over, or how it will be possible to live in Gaza and what they will do with it,‚Äù A. said. ‚ÄúWe were told: now we have to fuck up Hamas, no matter what the cost. Whatever you can, you bomb.‚Äù</span></p>
<p><span>B., the senior intelligence source, said that in retrospect, he believes this ‚Äúdisproportionate‚Äù policy of killing Palestinians in Gaza also endangers Israelis, and that this was one of the reasons he decided to be interviewed.</span></p>
<p><span>‚ÄúIn the short term, we are safer, because we hurt Hamas. But I think we‚Äôre less secure in the long run. I see how all the bereaved families in Gaza ‚Äî which is nearly everyone ‚Äî will raise the motivation for [people to join] Hamas 10 years down the line. And it will be much easier for [Hamas] to recruit them.‚Äù</span></p>
<p><span>In a statement to +972 and Local Call, the Israeli army denied much of what the sources told us, claiming that ‚Äúeach target is examined individually, while an individual assessment is made of the military advantage and collateral damage expected from the attack ‚Ä¶ The IDF does not carry out attacks when the collateral damage expected from the attack is excessive in relation to the military advantage.‚Äù</span></p>
<h3><span>STEP 5: CALCULATING COLLATERAL DAMAGE</span></h3>
<h3>‚ÄòThe model was not connected to reality‚Äô</h3>
<p><span>According to the intelligence sources, the Israeli army‚Äôs calculation of the number of civilians expected to be killed in each house alongside a target ‚Äî a procedure examined in a </span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240403151726/https://www.972mag.com/mass-assassination-factory-israel-calculated-bombing-gaza/"><span>previous investigation</span></a><span> by +972 and Local Call ‚Äî was conducted with the help of automatic and inaccurate tools. In previous wars, intelligence personnel would spend a lot of time verifying how many people were in a house that was set to be bombed, with the number of civilians liable to be killed listed as part of a ‚Äútarget file.‚Äù After October 7, however, this thorough verification was largely abandoned in favor of automation.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In October, The New York Times </span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240403151726/https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/16/world/middleeast/gaza-invasion-israel-cellphone-data.html"><span>reported</span></a><span> on a system operated from a special base in southern Israel, which collects information from mobile phones in the Gaza Strip and provided the military with a live estimate of the number of Palestinians who fled the northern Gaza Strip southward. Brig. General Udi Ben Muha told the Times that ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not a 100 percent perfect system ‚Äî but it gives you the information you need to make a decision.‚Äù The system operates according to colors: red marks areas where there are many people, and green and yellow mark areas that have been relatively cleared of residents.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<div id="attachment_175999"><p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240403151726/https://static.972mag.com/www/uploads/2024/01/F231110AM03.jpg" data-featherlight="image"><img title="Palestinians walk on a main road after fleeing from their homes in Gaza City to the southern part of Gaza, November 10, 2023.

</div>
<p><span>The sources who spoke to +972 and Local Call described a similar system for calculating collateral damage, which was used to decide whether to bomb a building in Gaza. They said that the software calculated the number of civilians residing in each home before the war ‚Äî by assessing the size of the building and reviewing its list of residents ‚Äî and then reduced those numbers by the proportion of residents who supposedly evacuated the neighborhood.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To illustrate, if the army estimated that half of a neighborhood‚Äôs residents had left, the program would count a house that usually had 10 residents as a house containing five people. To save time, the sources said, the army did not surveil the homes to check how many people were actually living there, as it did in previous operations, to find out if the program‚Äôs estimate was indeed accurate.</span></p>
<p><span>‚ÄúThis model was not connected to reality,‚Äù claimed one source. ‚ÄúThere was no connection between those who were in the home now, during the war, and those who were listed as living there prior to the war. [On one occasion] we bombed a house without knowing that there were several families inside, hiding together.‚Äù</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The source said that although the army knew that such errors could occur, this imprecise model was adopted nonetheless, because it was faster. As such, the source said, ‚Äúthe collateral damage calculation was completely automatic and statistical‚Äù ‚Äî even producing figures that were not whole numbers.</span></p>
<h3><span>STEP 6: BOMBING A FAMILY HOME</span></h3>
<h3>‚ÄòYou killed a family for no reason‚Äô</h3>
<p><span>The sources who spoke to +972 and Local Call explained that there was sometimes a substantial gap between the moment that tracking systems like Where‚Äôs Daddy? alerted an officer that a target had entered their house, and the bombing itself ‚Äî leading to the killing of whole families even without hitting the army‚Äôs target. ‚ÄúIt happened to me many times that we attacked a house, but the person wasn‚Äôt even home,‚Äù one source said. ‚ÄúThe result is that you killed a family for no reason.‚Äù</span></p>
<p><span>Three intelligence sources told +972 and Local Call that they had witnessed an incident in which the Israeli army bombed a family‚Äôs private home, and it later turned out that the intended target of the assassination was not even inside the house, since no further verification was conducted in real time.</span></p>

<p><span>‚ÄúSometimes [the target] was at home earlier, and then at night he went to sleep somewhere else, say underground, and you didn‚Äôt know about it,‚Äù one of the sources said. ‚ÄúThere are times when you double-check the location, and there are times when you just say, ‚ÄòOkay, he was in the house in the last few hours, so you can just bomb.‚Äô‚Äù</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Another source described a similar incident that affected him and made him want to be interviewed for this investigation. ‚ÄúWe understood that the target was home at 8 p.m. In the end, the air force bombed the house at 3 a.m. Then we found out [in that span of time] he had managed to move himself to another house with his family. There were two other families with children in the building we bombed.‚Äù</span></p>
<p><span>In previous wars in Gaza, after the assassination of human targets, Israeli intelligence would carry out bomb damage assessment (BDA) procedures ‚Äî a routine post-strike check to see if the senior commander was killed and how many civilians were killed along with him. As revealed in a </span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240403151726/https://www.972mag.com/gaza-soldiers-civilians-intelligence/"><span>previous +972 and Local Call investigation</span></a><span>, this involved listening in to phone calls of relatives who lost their loved ones. In the current war, however, at least in relation to junior militants marked using AI, sources say this procedure was abolished in order to save time. The sources said they did not know how many civilians were actually killed in each strike, and for the low-ranking suspected Hamas and PIJ operatives marked by AI, they did not even know whether the target himself was killed.</span></p>
<div>
<h3>Most read on +972</h3>

</div>
<p><span>‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt know exactly how many you killed, and who you killed,‚Äù an intelligence source </span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240403151726/https://twitter.com/yuval_abraham/status/1750123648533324158?lang=en"><span>told Local Call</span></a><span> for a previous investigation published in January. ‚ÄúOnly when it‚Äôs senior Hamas operatives do you follow the BDA procedure. In the rest of the cases, you don‚Äôt care. You get a report from the air force about whether the building was blown up, and that‚Äôs it. You have no idea how much collateral damage there was; you immediately move on to the next target. The emphasis was to create as many targets as possible, as quickly as possible.‚Äù</span></p>
<p><span>But while the Israeli military may move on from each strike without dwelling on the number of casualties, Amjad Al-Sheikh, the Shuja‚Äôiya resident who lost 11 of his family members in the Dec. 2 bombardment, said that he and his neighbors are still searching for corpses.</span></p>
<p><span>‚ÄúUntil now, there are bodies under the rubble,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúFourteen residential buildings were bombed with their residents inside. Some of my relatives and neighbors are still buried.‚Äù</span></p>

<li>
<p dir="auto">Plandex can provide a significant boost to your productivity, but as with any other AI tool, you shouldn't expect perfect results. Always review a plan carefully before applying changes, especially if security is involved. Plandex is designed to get you 80-90% of the way there rather than 100%.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">Due to the reasoning limitations of LLMs, automatically applied file updates also aren't perfect. While these can be improved over time with better prompting strategies (contributions welcome) and better models, be prepared for occasional updates that aren't quite right. Use the <code>plandex changes</code> command to review pending updates in a TUI. If a file update has mistakes, make those changes yourself with copy-and-paste and reject the file in the changes TUI.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">The more direction and detail you provide, the better the results will be. Working with Plandex often involves giving it a prompt, seeing that the results are a bit off, then using <code>plandex rewind</code> to go back and iterate on the prompt or add context before trying again. Branches are also useful for trying different approaches.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">While it can be tempting to just dump your entire project into context if it fits under the token limit, with current models you will tend to see better results (and pay less) by being more selective about what's loaded into context.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.mekomit.co.il/"><img src="https://static.972mag.com/www/uploads/2022/11/LC-LOGO-ENG.png" alt=""></a>
</p>
</div> <p><span>In 2021, a </span><a href="https://books.google.co.il/books/about/The_Human_Machine_Team_How_to_Create_Syn.html?id=hjl1zgEACAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y"><span>book</span></a><span> titled ‚ÄúThe Human-Machine Team: How to Create Synergy Between Human and Artificial Intelligence That Will Revolutionize Our World‚Äù was released in English under the pen name ‚ÄúBrigadier General Y.S.‚Äù In it, the author ‚Äî a man who we confirmed to be the current commander of the elite Israeli intelligence unit 8200 ‚Äî makes the case for designing a special machine that could rapidly process massive amounts of data to generate thousands of potential ‚Äútargets‚Äù for military strikes in the heat of a war. Such technology, he writes, would resolve what he described as a ‚Äúhuman bottleneck for both locating the new targets and decision-making to approve the targets.‚Äù</span></p>
<p><span>Such a machine, it turns out, actually exists. A new investigation by +972 Magazine and Local Call reveals that the Israeli army has developed an artificial intelligence-based program known as ‚ÄúLavender,‚Äù unveiled here for the first time. According to six Israeli intelligence officers, who have all served in the army during the current war on the Gaza Strip and had first-hand involvement with the use of AI to generate targets for assassination, Lavender has played a central role in the unprecedented bombing of Palestinians, especially during the early stages of the war. In fact, according to the sources, its influence on the military‚Äôs operations was such that they essentially treated the outputs of the AI machine ‚Äúas if it were a human decision.‚Äù</span></p>
<p><span>Formally, the Lavender system is designed to mark all suspected operatives in the military wings of Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ), including low-ranking ones, as potential bombing targets. The sources told +972 and Local Call that, during the first weeks of the war, the army almost completely relied on Lavender, which clocked as many as 37,000 Palestinians as suspected militants ‚Äî and their homes ‚Äî for possible air strikes.</span></p>
<p><span>During the early stages of the war, the army gave sweeping approval for officers to adopt Lavender‚Äôs kill lists, with no requirement to thoroughly check why the machine made those choices or to examine the raw intelligence data on which they were based. One source stated that human personnel often served only as a ‚Äúrubber stamp‚Äù for the machine‚Äôs decisions, adding that, normally, they would personally devote only about ‚Äú20 seconds‚Äù to each target before authorizing a bombing ‚Äî just to make sure the Lavender-marked target is male. This was despite knowing that the system makes what are regarded as ‚Äúerrors‚Äù in approximately 10 percent of cases, and is known to occasionally mark individuals who have merely a loose connection to militant groups, or no connection at all.</span></p>
<p><span>Moreover, the Israeli army systematically attacked the targeted individuals while they were in their homes ‚Äî usually at night while their whole families were present ‚Äî rather than during the course of military activity. According to the sources, this was because, from what they regarded as an intelligence standpoint, it was easier to locate the individuals in their private houses. Additional automated systems, including one called ‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs Daddy?‚Äù also revealed here for the first time, were used specifically to track the targeted individuals and carry out bombings when they had entered their family‚Äôs residences.</span></p>

<p><span>The result, as the sources testified, is that thousands of Palestinians ‚Äî most of them women and children or people who were not involved in the fighting ‚Äî were wiped out by Israeli airstrikes, especially during the first weeks of the war, because of the AI program‚Äôs decisions.</span></p>
<p><span>‚ÄúWe were not interested in killing [Hamas] operatives only when they were in a military building or engaged in a military activity,‚Äù A., an intelligence officer, told +972 and Local Call. ‚ÄúOn the contrary, the IDF bombed them in homes without hesitation, as a first option. It‚Äôs much easier to bomb a family‚Äôs home. The system is built to look for them in these situations.‚Äù</span></p>
<p><span>The Lavender machine joins another AI system, ‚ÄúThe Gospel,‚Äù about which information was revealed in a </span><a href="https://www.972mag.com/mass-assassination-factory-israel-calculated-bombing-gaza/"><span>previous investigation</span></a><span> by +972 and Local Call in November 2023, as well as in the Israeli military‚Äôs own </span><a href="https://www.israeldefense.co.il/node/57256#google_vignette"><span>publications</span></a><span>. A fundamental difference between the two systems is in the definition of the target: whereas The Gospel marks buildings and structures that the army claims militants operate from, Lavender marks people ‚Äî and puts them on a kill list.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In addition, according to the sources, when it came to targeting alleged junior militants marked by Lavender, the army preferred to only use unguided missiles, commonly known as ‚Äúdumb‚Äù bombs (in contrast to ‚Äúsmart‚Äù precision bombs), which can destroy entire buildings on top of their occupants and cause significant casualties. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt want to waste expensive bombs on unimportant people ‚Äî it‚Äôs very expensive for the country and there‚Äôs a shortage [of those bombs],‚Äù said C., one of the intelligence officers. Another source said that they had personally authorized the bombing of ‚Äúhundreds‚Äù of private homes of alleged junior operatives marked by Lavender, with many of these attacks killing civilians and entire families as ‚Äúcollateral damage.‚Äù</span></p>
<p><span>In an unprecedented move, according to two of the sources, the army also decided during the first weeks of the war that, for every junior Hamas operative that Lavender marked, it was permissible to kill up to 15 or 20 civilians; in the past, the military did not authorize any ‚Äúcollateral damage‚Äù during assassinations of low-ranking militants. The sources added that, in the event that the target was a senior Hamas official with the rank of battalion or brigade commander, the army on several occasions authorized the killing of more than 100 civilians in the assassination of a single commander.</span></p>

<p><span>The following investigation is organized according to the six chronological stages of the Israeli army‚Äôs highly automated target production in the early weeks of the Gaza war. First, we explain the Lavender machine itself, which marked tens of thousands of Palestinians using AI. Second, we reveal the ‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs Daddy?‚Äù system, which tracked these targets and signaled to the army when they entered their family homes. Third, we describe how ‚Äúdumb‚Äù bombs were chosen to strike these homes.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Fourth, we explain how the army loosened the permitted number of civilians who could be killed during the bombing of a target. Fifth, we note how automated software inaccurately calculated the amount of non-combatants in each household. And sixth, we show how on several occasions, when a home was struck, usually at night, the individual target was sometimes not inside at all, because military officers did not verify the information in real time.</span></p>
<h3><span>STEP 1: GENERATING TARGETS</span></h3>
<h3>‚ÄòOnce you go automatic, target generation goes crazy‚Äô</h3>
<p><span>In the Israeli army, the term ‚Äúhuman target‚Äù referred in the past to a senior military operative who, according to the rules of the military‚Äôs International Law Department, can be killed in their private home even if there are civilians around. Intelligence sources told +972 and Local Call that during Israel‚Äôs previous wars, since this was an ‚Äúespecially brutal‚Äù way to kill someone ‚Äî often by killing an entire family alongside the target ‚Äî such human targets were marked very carefully and only senior military commanders were bombed in their homes, to maintain the principle of proportionality under international law.</span></p>
<p><span>But after October 7 ‚Äî when Hamas-led militants launched a deadly assault on southern Israeli communities, killing around 1,200 people and abducting 240 ‚Äî the army, the sources said, took a dramatically different approach. Under ‚ÄúOperation Iron Swords,‚Äù the army decided to designate all operatives of Hamas‚Äô military wing as human targets, regardless of their rank or military importance. And that changed everything.</span></p>
<p><span>The new policy also posed a technical problem for Israeli intelligence. In previous wars, in order to authorize the assassination of a single human target, an officer had to go through a complex and lengthy ‚Äúincrimination‚Äù process: cross-check evidence that the person was indeed a senior member of Hamas‚Äô military wing, find out where he lived, his contact information, and finally know when he was home in real time. When the list of targets numbered only a few dozen senior operatives, intelligence personnel could individually handle the work involved in incriminating and locating them.</span></p>
<div id="attachment_177464"><p><a href="https://static.972mag.com/www/uploads/2024/04/main_image51785_4WLiR7887N.jpg" data-featherlight="image"><img title="Palestinians try to rescue survivors and pull bodies from the rubble after Israeli airstrikes hit buildings near Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in Deir al-Balah, central Gaza, October 22, 2023.

(Mohammed Zaanoun/Activestills)</p>
</div>
<p><span>However, once the list was expanded to include tens of thousands of lower-ranking operatives, the Israeli army figured it had to rely on automated software and artificial intelligence. The result, the sources testify, was that the role of human personnel in incriminating Palestinians as military operatives was pushed aside, and AI did most of the work instead. According to four of the sources who spoke to +972 and Local Call, Lavender ‚Äî which was developed to create human targets in the current war ‚Äî has marked some 37,000 Palestinians as suspected ‚ÄúHamas militants,‚Äù most of them junior, for assassination (the IDF Spokesperson denied the existence of such a kill list in a statement to +972 and Local Call).</span></p>
<p><span>‚ÄúWe didn‚Äôt know who the junior operatives were, because Israel didn‚Äôt track them routinely [before the war],‚Äù explained senior officer B. to +972 and Local Call, illuminating the reason behind the development of this particular target machine for the current war. ‚ÄúThey wanted to allow us to attack [the junior operatives] automatically. That‚Äôs the Holy Grail. Once you go automatic, target generation goes crazy.‚Äù</span></p>
<p><span>The sources said that the approval to automatically adopt Lavender‚Äôs kill lists, which had previously been used only as an auxiliary tool, was granted about two weeks into the war, after intelligence personnel ‚Äúmanually‚Äù checked the accuracy of a random sample of several hundred targets selected by the AI system. When that sample found that Lavender‚Äôs results had reached 90 percent accuracy in identifying an individual‚Äôs affiliation with Hamas, the army authorized the sweeping use of the system. From that moment, sources said that if Lavender decided an individual was a militant in Hamas, they were essentially asked to treat that as an order, with no requirement to independently check why the machine made that choice or to examine the raw intelligence data on which it is based.</span></p>
<p><span>‚ÄúAt 5 a.m., </span><span>[the air force]</span><span> would come and bomb all the houses that we had marked,‚Äù B. said. ‚ÄúWe took out thousands of people. We didn‚Äôt go through them one by one ‚Äî we put everything into automated systems, and as soon as one of [the marked individuals] was at home, he immediately became a target. We bombed him and his house.‚Äù</span></p>
<p><span>The deadly results of this loosening of restrictions in the early stage of the war were staggering. According to data from the Palestinian Health Ministry in Gaza, on which the Israeli army has </span><a href="https://www.mekomit.co.il/%d7%94%d7%a6%d7%91%d7%90-%d7%91%d7%93%d7%a7-%d7%95%d7%9e%d7%a6%d7%90-%d7%a9%d7%93%d7%99%d7%95%d7%95%d7%97%d7%99-%d7%94%d7%94%d7%a8%d7%95%d7%92%d7%99%d7%9d-%d7%91%d7%9e%d7%a9%d7%a8%d7%93-%d7%94%d7%91/"><span>relied almost exclusively</span></a><span> since the beginning of the war, Israel killed some 15,000 Palestinians ‚Äî almost half of the death toll so far ‚Äî in the </span><a href="https://www.ochaopt.org/content/hostilities-gaza-strip-and-israel-flash-update-50"><span>first six weeks</span></a><span> of the war, up until a week-long ceasefire was agreed on Nov. 24.</span></p>

<h3>‚ÄòThe more information and variety, the better‚Äô</h3>
<p><span>The Lavender software analyzes information collected on most of the 2.3 million residents of the Gaza Strip through a system of mass surveillance, then assesses and ranks the likelihood that each particular person is active in the military wing of Hamas or PIJ. According to sources, the machine gives almost every single person in Gaza a rating from 1 to 100, expressing how likely it is that they are a militant.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Lavender learns to identify characteristics of known Hamas and PIJ operatives, whose information was fed to the machine as training data, and then to locate these same characteristics ‚Äî also called ‚Äúfeatures‚Äù ‚Äî among the general population, the sources explained. An individual found to have several different incriminating features will reach a high rating, and thus automatically becomes a potential target for assassination.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In ‚ÄúThe Human-Machine Team,‚Äù the book referenced at the beginning of this article, the current commander of Unit 8200 advocates for such a system without referencing Lavender by name. (The commander himself also isn‚Äôt named, but five sources in 8200 confirmed that the commander is the author, as </span><a href="https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2021-10-01/ty-article/.highlight/top-israeli-intel-officer-goes-where-no-ones-gone-before-and-its-all-on-amazon/0000017f-e1fb-df7c-a5ff-e3fb21210000"><span>reported</span></a><span> also by Haaretz.) Describing human personnel as a ‚Äúbottleneck‚Äù that limits the army‚Äôs capacity during a military operation, The commander laments: ‚ÄúWe [humans] cannot process so much information. It doesn‚Äôt matter how many people you have tasked to produce targets during the war ‚Äî you still cannot produce enough targets per day.‚Äù</span></p>
<p><span>The solution to this problem, he says, is artificial intelligence. The book offers a short guide to building a ‚Äútarget machine,‚Äù similar in description to Lavender, based on AI and machine-learning algorithms. Included in this guide are several examples of the ‚Äúhundreds and thousands‚Äù of features that can increase an individual‚Äôs rating, such as being in a Whatsapp group with a known militant, changing cell phone every few months, and changing addresses frequently.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>‚ÄúThe more information, and the more variety, the better,‚Äù the commander writes. ‚ÄúVisual information, cellular information, social media connections, battlefield information, phone contacts, photos.‚Äù While humans select these features at first, the commander continues, over time the machine will come to identify features on its own. This, he says, can enable militaries to create ‚Äútens of thousands of targets,‚Äù while the actual decision as to whether or not to attack them will remain a human one.</span></p>
<p><span>The book isn‚Äôt the only time a senior Israeli commander hinted at the existence of human target machines like Lavender. +972 and Local Call have obtained footage of a private lecture given by the commander of Unit 8200‚Äôs secretive Data Science and AI center, ‚ÄúCol. Yoav,‚Äù at Tel Aviv University‚Äôs AI week in 2023, which was </span><a href="https://www.geektime.co.il/idf-fights-hamas-with-ai-and-data-science/"><span>reported on</span></a><span> at the time in the Israeli media.</span></p>
<p><span>In the lecture, the commander speaks about a new, sophisticated target machine used by the Israeli army that detects ‚Äúdangerous people‚Äù based on their likeness to existing lists of known militants on which it was trained. ‚ÄúUsing the system, we managed to identify Hamas missile squad commanders,‚Äù Col. Yoav said in the lecture, referring to Israel‚Äôs May 2021 military operation in Gaza, when the machine was used for the first time.&nbsp;</span></p>

</div>
<p><span>The lecture presentation slides, also obtained by +972 and Local Call, contain illustrations of how the machine works: it is fed data about existing Hamas operatives, it learns to notice their features, and then it rates other Palestinians based on how similar they are to the militants.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>‚ÄúWe rank the results and determine the threshold [at which to attack a target],‚Äù Col. Yoav said in the lecture, emphasizing that ‚Äúeventually, people of flesh and blood take the decisions. In the defense realm, ethically speaking, we put a lot of emphasis on this. These tools are meant to help [intelligence officers] break their barriers.‚Äù&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In practice, however, sources who have used Lavender in recent months say human agency and precision were substituted for mass target creation and lethality.</span></p>
<h3>‚ÄòThere was no ‚Äúzero-error‚Äù policy‚Äô</h3>
<p><span>B., a senior officer who used Lavender, echoed to +972 and Local Call that in the current war, officers were not required to independently review the AI system‚Äôs assessments, in order to save time and enable the mass production of human targets without hindrances.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>‚ÄúEverything was statistical, everything was neat ‚Äî it was very dry,‚Äù B. said. He noted that this lack of supervision was permitted despite internal checks showing that Lavender‚Äôs calculations were considered accurate only 90 percent of the time; in other words, it was known in advance that 10 percent of the human targets slated for assassination were not members of the Hamas military wing at all.</span></p>
<p><span>For example, sources explained that the Lavender machine sometimes mistakenly flagged individuals who had communication patterns similar to known Hamas or PIJ operatives ‚Äî including police and civil defense workers, militants‚Äô relatives, residents who happened to have a name and nickname identical to that of an operative, and Gazans who used a device that once belonged to a Hamas operative.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>‚ÄúHow close does a person have to be to Hamas to be [considered by an AI machine to be] affiliated with the organization?‚Äù said one source critical of Lavender‚Äôs inaccuracy. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a vague boundary. Is a person who doesn‚Äôt receive a salary from Hamas, but helps them with all sorts of things, a Hamas operative? Is someone who was in Hamas in the past, but is no longer there today, a Hamas operative? Each of these features ‚Äî characteristics that a machine would flag as suspicious ‚Äî is inaccurate.‚Äù</span></p>

</div>
<p><span>Similar problems exist with the ability of target machines to assess the phone used by an individual marked for assassination. ‚ÄúIn war, Palestinians change phones all the time,‚Äù said the source. ‚ÄúPeople lose contact with their families, give their phone to a friend or a wife, maybe lose it. There is no way to rely 100 percent on the automatic mechanism that determines which [phone] number belongs to whom.‚Äù</span></p>
<p><span>According to the sources, the army knew that the minimal human supervision in place would not discover these faults. ‚ÄúThere was no ‚Äòzero-error‚Äô policy. Mistakes were treated statistically,‚Äù said a source who used Lavender. ‚ÄúBecause of the scope and magnitude, the protocol was that even if you don‚Äôt know for sure that the machine is right, you know that statistically it‚Äôs fine. So you go for it.‚Äù</span></p>
<p><span>‚ÄúIt has proven itself,‚Äù said B., the senior source. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs something about the statistical approach that sets you to a certain norm and standard. There has been an illogical amount of [bombings] in this operation. This is unparalleled, in my memory. And I have much more trust in a statistical mechanism than a soldier who lost a friend two days ago. Everyone there, including me, lost people on October 7. The machine did it coldly. And that made it easier.‚Äù</span></p>
<p><span>Another intelligence source, who defended the reliance on the Lavender-generated kill lists of Palestinian suspects, argued that it was worth investing an intelligence officer‚Äôs time only to verify the information if the target was a senior commander in Hamas. ‚ÄúBut when it comes to a junior militant, you don‚Äôt want to invest manpower and time in it,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIn war, there is no time to incriminate every target. So you‚Äôre willing to take the margin of error of using artificial intelligence, risking collateral damage and civilians dying, and risking attacking by mistake, and to live with it.‚Äù</span></p>
<p>B. said that the reason for this automation was a constant push to generate more targets for assassination. ‚ÄúIn a day without targets [whose feature rating was sufficient to authorize a strike], we attacked at a lower threshold. We were constantly being pressured: ‚ÄòBring us more targets.‚Äô They really shouted at us. We finished [killing] our targets very quickly.‚Äù</p>
<p><span>He explained that when lowering the rating threshold of Lavender, it would mark more people as targets for strikes. ‚ÄúAt its peak, the system managed to generate 37,000 people as potential human targets,‚Äù said B. ‚ÄúBut the numbers changed all the time, because it depends on where you set the bar of what a Hamas operative is. There were times when a Hamas operative was defined more broadly, and then the machine started bringing us all kinds of civil defense personnel, police officers, on whom it would be a shame to waste bombs. They help the Hamas government, but they don‚Äôt really endanger soldiers.‚Äù</span></p>

<h3>‚ÄòWe only checked that the target was a man‚Äô</h3>
<p><span>The Israeli military flatly rejects these claims. In a statement to +972 and Local Call, the IDF Spokesperson denied using artificial intelligence to incriminate targets, saying these are merely ‚Äúauxiliary tools that assist officers in the process of incrimination.‚Äù The statement went on: ‚ÄúIn any case, an independent examination by an [intelligence] analyst is required, which verifies that the identified targets are legitimate targets for attack, in accordance with the conditions set forth in IDF directives and international law.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>However, sources said that the only human supervision protocol in place before bombing the houses of suspected ‚Äújunior‚Äù militants marked by Lavender was to conduct a single check: ensuring that the AI-selected target is male rather than female. The assumption in the army was that if it were a woman, the machine had likely made a mistake, because there are no women among the ranks of the military wings of Hamas and PIJ.</span></p>
<p><span>‚ÄúA human being had to [verify the target] for just a few seconds,‚Äù B. said, explaining that this became the protocol after realizing the Lavender system was ‚Äúgetting it right‚Äù most of the time. ‚ÄúAt first, we did checks to ensure that the machine didn‚Äôt get confused. But at some point we relied on the automatic system, and we only checked that [the target] was a man ‚Äî that was enough. It doesn‚Äôt take a long time to tell if someone has a male or a female voice.‚Äù&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To conduct the male/female check, B. claimed that in the current war, ‚ÄúI would invest 20 seconds for each target at this stage, and do dozens of them every day. I had zero added value as a human, apart from being a stamp of approval. It saved a lot of time. If [the operative] came up in the automated mechanism, and I checked that he was a man, there would be permission to bomb him, subject to an examination of collateral damage.‚Äù</span></p>

<p><span>In practice, sources said this meant that for civilian men marked in error by Lavender, there was no supervising mechanism in place to detect the mistake.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><span>STEP 2: LINKING TARGETS TO FAMILY HOMES</span></h3>
<h3>‚ÄòMost of the people you killed were women and children‚Äô</h3>
<p><span>The next stage in the Israeli army‚Äôs assassination procedure is identifying where to attack the targets that Lavender generates.</span></p>
<p><span>In a statement to +972 and Local Call, the IDF Spokesperson claimed in response to this article that ‚ÄúHamas places its operatives and military assets in the heart of the civilian population, systematically uses the civilian population as human shields, and conducts fighting from within civilian structures, including sensitive sites such as hospitals, mosques, schools and UN facilities. The IDF is bound by and acts according to international law, directing its attacks only at military targets and military operatives.‚Äù&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The six sources we spoke to echoed this to some degree, saying that Hamas‚Äô extensive </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/02/12/world/middleeast/gaza-tunnel-israel-hamas.html"><span>tunnel system</span></a><span> deliberately passes under hospitals and schools; that Hamas militants use ambulances to get around; and that countless military assets have been situated near civilian buildings. The sources argued that many Israeli strikes kill civilians as a result of these tactics by Hamas ‚Äî a characterization that human rights groups <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2024/03/19/israeli-forces-conduct-gaza">warn</a> evades Israel‚Äôs onus for inflicting the casualties.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>However, in contrast to the Israeli army‚Äôs official statements, the sources explained that a major reason for the unprecedented death toll from Israel‚Äôs current bombardment is the fact that the army has systematically attacked targets in their private homes, alongside their families ‚Äî in part because it was easier from an intelligence standpoint to mark family houses using automated systems.</span></p>
<p><span>Indeed, several sources emphasized that, as opposed to numerous cases of Hamas operatives engaging in military activity from civilian areas, in the case of systematic assassination strikes, the army routinely made the active choice to bomb suspected militants when inside civilian households from which no military activity took place. This choice, they said, was a reflection of the way Israel‚Äôs system of mass surveillance in Gaza is designed.</span></p>

<p><span>The sources told +972 and Local Call that since everyone in Gaza had a private house with which they could be associated, the army‚Äôs surveillance systems could easily and automatically ‚Äúlink‚Äù individuals to family houses. In order to identify the moment operatives enter their houses in real time, various additional automatic softwares have been developed. These programs track thousands of individuals simultaneously, identify when they are at home, and send an automatic alert to the targeting officer, who then marks the house for bombing. One of several of these tracking softwares, revealed here for the first time, is called ‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs Daddy?‚Äù&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>‚ÄúYou put hundreds [of targets] into the system and wait to see who you can kill,‚Äù said one source with knowledge of the system. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs called broad hunting: you copy-paste from the lists that the target system produces.‚Äù</span></p>
<p><span>Evidence of this policy is also clear from the data: during the first month of the war, more than half of the fatalities ‚Äî 6,120 people ‚Äî belonged to 1,340 families, many of which were completely wiped out while inside their homes, according to </span><a href="https://www.ochaopt.org/content/hostilities-gaza-strip-and-israel-reported-impact-day-45"><span>UN figures</span></a><span>. The proportion of entire </span><a href="https://www.972mag.com/gaza-families-bombing-humanitarian-crisis/"><span>families</span></a><span> bombed in their houses in the current war is much higher </span><a href="https://www.btselem.org/download/201501_black_flag_eng.pdf"><span>than in the 2014 Israeli operation</span></a><span> in Gaza, further suggesting the prominence of this policy.</span></p>
<p><span>Another source said that each time the pace of assassinations waned, more targets were added to systems like Where‚Äôs Daddy? to locate individuals that entered their homes and could therefore be bombed. He said that the decision of who to put into the tracking systems could be made by relatively low-ranking officers in the military hierarchy.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>‚ÄúOne day, totally of my own accord, I added something like 1,200 new targets to the [tracking] system, because the number of attacks [we were conducting] decreased,‚Äù the source said. ‚ÄúThat made sense to me. In retrospect, it seems like a serious decision I made. And such decisions were not made at high levels.‚Äù</span></p>
<p><span>The sources said that in the first two weeks of the war, ‚Äúseveral thousand‚Äù targets were initially inputted into locating programs like Where‚Äôs Daddy?. These included all the members of Hamas‚Äô elite special forces unit the Nukhba, all of Hamas‚Äô anti-tank operatives, and anyone who entered Israel on October 7. But before long, the kill list was drastically expanded.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>‚ÄúIn the end it was everyone [marked by Lavender],‚Äù one source explained. ‚ÄúTens of thousands. This happened a few weeks later, when the [Israeli] brigades entered Gaza, and there were already fewer uninvolved people [i.e. civilians] in the northern areas.‚Äù According to this source, even some minors were marked by Lavender as targets for bombing. ‚ÄúNormally, operatives are over the age of 17, but that was not a condition.‚Äù</span></p>

</div>
<p><span>Lavender and systems like Where‚Äôs Daddy? were thus combined with deadly effect, killing entire families, sources said. By adding a name from the Lavender-generated lists to the Where‚Äôs Daddy? home tracking system, A. explained, the marked person would be placed under ongoing surveillance, and could be attacked as soon as they set foot in their home, collapsing the house on everyone inside.</span></p>
<p><span>‚ÄúLet‚Äôs say you calculate [that there is one] Hamas [operative] plus 10 [civilians in the house],‚Äù A. said. ‚ÄúUsually, these 10 will be women and children. So absurdly, it turns out that most of the people you killed were women and children.‚Äù</span></p>
<h3><span>STEP 3: CHOOSING A WEAPON</span></h3>
<h3>‚ÄòWe usually carried out the attacks with ‚Äúdumb bombs‚Äù‚Äô</h3>
<p><span>Once Lavender has marked a target for assassination, army personnel have verified that they are male, and tracking software has located the target in their home, the next stage is picking the munition with which to bomb them.</span></p>
<p><span>In December 2023, </span><a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2023/12/13/politics/intelligence-assessment-dumb-bombs-israel-gaza/index.html"><span>CNN reported</span></a> <span>that according to U.S. intelligence estimates, about 45 percent of the munitions used by the Israeli air force in Gaza were ‚Äúdumb‚Äù bombs, which are known to cause more collateral damage than guided bombs. In response to the CNN report, an army spokesperson quoted in the article said: ‚ÄúA</span><span>s a military committed to international law and a moral code of conduct, we are devoting vast resources to minimizing harm to the civilians that Hamas has forced into the role of human shields. Our war is against Hamas, not against the people of Gaza.‚Äù</span></p>
<p><span>Three intelligence sources, however, told +972 and Local Call that junior operatives marked by Lavender were assassinated only with dumb bombs, in the interest of saving more expensive armaments. The implication, one source explained, was that the army would not strike a junior target if they lived in a high-rise building, because the army did not want to spend a more precise and expensive ‚Äúfloor bomb‚Äù (with more limited collateral effect) to kill him. But if a junior target lived in a building with only a few floors, the army was authorized to kill him and everyone in the building with a dumb bomb.</span></p>
<div id="attachment_177445"><p><a href="https://static.972mag.com/www/uploads/2024/03/F240318ARK043.jpg" data-featherlight="image"><img title="Palestinians at the site of a building destroyed by an Israeli airstrike in Rafah, in the southern Gaza Strip, March 18, 2024.

</div>
<p><span>‚ÄúIt was like that with all the junior targets,‚Äù testified C., who used various automated programs in the current war. ‚ÄúThe only question was, is it possible to attack the building in terms of collateral damage? Because we usually carried out the attacks with dumb bombs, and that meant literally destroying the whole house on top of its occupants. But even if an attack is averted, you don‚Äôt care ‚Äî you immediately move on to the next target. Because of the system, the targets never end. You have another 36,000 waiting.‚Äù</span></p>
<h3><span>STEP 4: AUTHORIZING CIVILIAN CASUALTIES</span></h3>
<h3>‚ÄòWe attacked almost without considering collateral damage‚Äô</h3>
<p><span>One source said that when attacking junior operatives, including those marked by AI systems like Lavender, the number of civilians they were allowed to kill alongside each target was fixed during the initial weeks of the war at up to 20. Another source claimed the fixed number was up to 15. These ‚Äúcollateral damage degrees,‚Äù as the military calls them, were applied broadly to all suspected junior militants, the sources said, regardless of their rank, military importance, and age, and with no specific case-by-case examination to weigh the military advantage of assassinating them against the expected harm to civilians.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>According to A., who was an officer in a target operation room in the current war, the army‚Äôs international law department has never before given such ‚Äúsweeping approval‚Äù for such a high collateral damage degree. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not just that you can kill any person who is a Hamas soldier, which is clearly permitted and legitimate in terms of international law,‚Äù A. said. ‚ÄúBut they directly tell you: ‚ÄòYou are allowed to kill them along with many civilians.‚Äô&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>‚ÄúEvery person who wore a Hamas uniform in the past year or two could be bombed with 20 [civilians killed as] collateral damage, even without special permission,‚Äù A. continued. ‚ÄúIn practice, the principle of proportionality did not exist.‚Äù</span></p>
<p><span>According to A., this was the policy for most of the time that he served. Only later did the military lower the collateral damage degree. ‚ÄúIn this calculation, it could also be 20 children for a junior operative ‚Ä¶ It really wasn‚Äôt like that in the past,‚Äù A. explained. Asked about the security rationale behind this policy, A. replied: ‚ÄúLethality.‚Äù</span></p>
<div id="attachment_177453"><p><a href="https://static.972mag.com/www/uploads/2024/03/F231107ARK20.jpg" data-featherlight="image"><img title="Palestinians wait to receive the bodies of their relatives who were killed in Israeli airstrikes, at Al-Najjar Hospital in Rafah, southern Gaza Strip, November 7, 2023.

</div>
<p><span>The predetermined and fixed collateral damage degree helped accelerate the mass creation of targets using the Lavender machine, sources said, because it saved time. B. claimed that the number of civilians they were permitted to kill per suspected junior militant marked by AI in the first week of the war, was fifteen, but that this number ‚Äúwent up and down‚Äù over time.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>‚ÄúAt first we attacked almost without considering collateral damage,‚Äù B. said of the first week after October 7. ‚ÄúIn practice, you didn‚Äôt really count people [in each house that is bombed], because you couldn‚Äôt really tell if they‚Äôre at home or not. After a week, restrictions on collateral damage began. The number dropped [from 15] to five, which made it really difficult for us to attack, because if the whole family was home, we couldn‚Äôt bomb it. Then they raised the number again.‚Äù</span></p>
<h3>‚ÄòWe knew we would kill over 100 civilians‚Äô</h3>
<p><span>Sources told +972 and Local Call that now, partly due to American pressure, the Israeli army is no longer mass-generating junior human targets for bombing in civilian homes. The fact that most homes in the Gaza Strip were already destroyed or damaged, and almost the entire population has been displaced, also impaired the army‚Äôs ability to rely on intelligence databases and automated house-locating programs.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>E. claimed that the massive bombardment of junior militants took place only in the first week or two of the war, and then was stopped mainly so as not to waste bombs. ‚ÄúThere is a munitions economy,‚Äù E. said. ‚ÄúThey were always afraid that there would be [a war] in the northern arena [with Hezbollah in Lebanon]. They don‚Äôt attack these kinds of [junior] people at all anymore.‚Äù&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>However, airstrikes against senior ranking Hamas commanders are still ongoing, and sources said that for these attacks, the military is authorizing the killing of ‚Äúhundreds‚Äù of civilians per target ‚Äî an official policy for which there is no historical precedent in Israel, or even in recent U.S. military operations.</span></p>
<p><span>‚ÄúIn the bombing of the commander of the Shuja‚Äôiya Battalion, we knew that we would kill over 100 civilians,‚Äù B. recalled of a Dec. 2 bombing that the IDF Spokesperson </span><a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/idf-strike-kills-gazan-terrorist-responsible-for-attack-that-killed-oron-shaul-in-2014/"><span>said</span></a><span> was aimed at assassinating Wisam Farhat. ‚ÄúFor me, psychologically, it was unusual. Over 100 civilians ‚Äî it crosses some red line.‚Äù</span></p>

</div>
<p><span>Amjad Al-Sheikh, a young Palestinian from Gaza, said many of his family members were killed in that bombing. A resident of Shuja‚Äôiya, east of Gaza City, he was at a local supermarket that day when he heard five blasts that shattered the glass windows.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>‚ÄúI ran to my family‚Äôs house, but there were no buildings there anymore,‚Äù Al-Sheikh told +972 and Local Call. ‚ÄúThe street was filled with screams and smoke. Entire residential blocks turned to mountains of rubble and deep pits. People began to search in the cement, using their hands, and so did I, looking for signs of my family‚Äôs house.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Al-Sheikh‚Äôs wife and baby daughter survived ‚Äî protected from the rubble by a closet that fell on top of them ‚Äî but he found 11 other members of his family, among them his sisters, brothers, and their young children, dead under the rubble. </span><a href="https://www.btselem.org/hebrew/gaza_strip/20231205_israel_is_not_fighting_against_hamas_but_against_civilians_implementing_a_criminal_policy_of_bombings"><span>According to</span></a><span> the human rights group B‚ÄôTselem, the bombing that day destroyed dozens of buildings, killed dozens of people, and buried hundreds under the ruins of their homes.</span></p>
<h3>‚ÄòEntire families were killed‚Äô</h3>
<p><span>Intelligence sources told +972 and Local Call they took part in even deadlier strikes. In order to assassinate Ayman Nofal, the commander of Hamas‚Äô Central Gaza Brigade, a source said the army authorized the killing of approximately 300 civilians, </span><a href="https://www.ynet.co.il/news/article/ryxl6b2116"><span>destroying several buildings</span></a><span> in airstrikes on Al-Bureij refugee camp on Oct. 17 based on an imprecise pinpointing of Nofal. Satellite footage and </span><a href="https://twitter.com/Roaastudies/status/1714253580792643820"><span>videos</span></a><span> from the scene show the destruction of several large multi-storey apartment buildings.</span></p>
<p><span>‚ÄúBetween 16 to 18 houses were wiped out in the attack,‚Äù Amro Al-Khatib, a resident of the camp, told +972 and Local Call. ‚ÄúWe couldn‚Äôt tell one apartment from the other ‚Äî they all got mixed up in the rubble, and we found human body parts everywhere.‚Äù</span></p>
<p><span>In the aftermath, Al-Khatib recalled around 50 dead bodies being pulled out of the rubble, and around 200 people wounded, many of them gravely. But that was just the first day. The camp‚Äôs residents spent five days pulling the dead and injured out, he said.</span></p>

</div>
<p><span>Nael Al-Bahisi, a paramedic, was one of the first on the scene. He counted between 50-70 casualties on that first day. ‚ÄúAt a certain moment, we understood the target of the strike was Hamas commander Ayman Nofal,‚Äù he told +972 and Local Call. ‚ÄúThey killed him, and also many people who didn‚Äôt know he was there. Entire families with children were killed.‚Äù</span></p>
<p><span>Another intelligence source told +972 and Local Call that the army </span><a href="https://www.israelhayom.co.il/news/defense/article/14992654"><span>destroyed a high-rise building</span></a><span> in Rafah in mid-December, killing ‚Äúdozens of civilians,‚Äù in order </span><a href="https://www.israelhayom.co.il/news/defense/article/14992654"><span>to try to kill</span></a><span> Mohammed Shabaneh, the commander of Hamas‚Äô Rafah Brigade (it is not clear whether or not he was killed in the attack). Often, the source said, the senior commanders hide in tunnels that pass under civilian buildings, and therefore the choice to assassinate them with an airstrike necessarily kills civilians.</span></p>
<p><span>‚ÄúMost of those injured were children,‚Äù said Wael Al-Sir, 55, who witnessed the large-scale strike believed by some Gazans to have been the assassination attempt. He told +972 and Local Call that the bombing on Dec. 20 destroyed an ‚Äúentire residential block‚Äù and killed at least 10 children.</span></p>
<p><span>‚ÄúThere was a completely permissive policy regarding the casualties of [bombing] operations ‚Äî so permissive that in my opinion it had an element of revenge,‚Äù D., an intelligence source, claimed. ‚ÄúThe core of this was the assassinations of senior [Hamas and PIJ commanders] for whom they were willing to kill hundreds of civilians. We had a calculation: how many for a brigade commander, how many for a battalion commander, and so on.‚Äù</span></p>
<p><span>‚ÄúThere were regulations, but they were just very lenient,‚Äù said E., another intelligence source. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve killed people with collateral damage in the high double digits, if not low triple digits. These are things that haven‚Äôt happened before.‚Äù</span></p>

</div>
<p><span>Such a high rate of ‚Äúcollateral damage‚Äù is exceptional not only compared to what the Israeli army previously deemed acceptable, but also compared to the wars waged by the United States in Iraq, Syria, and Afghanistan.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>General Peter Gersten, </span><span>Deputy Commander for Operations and Intelligence </span><span>in the operation to fight ISIS in Iraq and Syria, </span><a href="https://www.defensedaily.com/pentagon-removed-non-combatant-casualty-cut-off-value-doctrine-2018/pentagon/"><span>told</span></a><span> a U.S. defense magazine in 2021 that an attack with collateral damage of 15 civilians deviated from procedure; to carry it out, he had to obtain special permission from the head of the U.S. Central Command, General Lloyd Austin, who is now Secretary of Defense.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>‚ÄúWith Osama Bin Laden, you‚Äôd have an NCV [Non-combatant Casualty Value] of 30, but if you had a low-level commander, his NCV was typically zero,‚Äù Gersten said. ‚ÄúWe ran zero for the longest time.‚Äù</span></p>
<h3>‚ÄòWe were told: ‚ÄúWhatever you can, bomb‚Äù‚Äô</h3>
<p><span>All the sources interviewed for this investigation said that Hamas‚Äô massacres on October 7 and kidnapping of hostages greatly influenced the army‚Äôs fire policy and collateral damage degrees. ‚ÄúAt first, the atmosphere was painful and vindictive,‚Äù said B., who was drafted into the army immediately after October 7, and served in a target operation room. ‚ÄúThe rules were very lenient. They took down four buildings when they knew the target was in one of them. It was crazy.</span></p>
<p><span>‚ÄúThere was a dissonance: on the one hand, people here were frustrated that we were not attacking enough,‚Äù B. continued. ‚ÄúOn the other hand, you see at the end of the day that another thousand Gazans have died, most of them civilians.‚Äù</span></p>
<p><span>‚ÄúThere was hysteria in the professional ranks,‚Äù said D., who was also drafted immediately after October 7. ‚ÄúThey had no idea how to react at all. The only thing they knew to do was to just start bombing like madmen to try to dismantle Hamas‚Äô capabilities.‚Äù</span></p>

</div>
<p>D. stressed that they were not explicitly told that the army‚Äôs goal was ‚Äúrevenge,‚Äù but expressed that ‚Äúas soon as every target connected to Hamas becomes legitimate, and with almost any collateral damage being approved, it is clear to you that thousands of people are going to be killed. Even if officially every target is connected to Hamas, when the policy is so permissive, it loses all meaning.‚Äù</p>
<p><span>A. also used the word ‚Äúrevenge‚Äù to describe the atmosphere inside the army after October 7. ‚ÄúNo one thought about what to do afterward, when the war is over, or how it will be possible to live in Gaza and what they will do with it,‚Äù A. said. ‚ÄúWe were told: now we have to fuck up Hamas, no matter what the cost. Whatever you can, you bomb.‚Äù</span></p>
<p><span>B., the senior intelligence source, said that in retrospect, he believes this ‚Äúdisproportionate‚Äù policy of killing Palestinians in Gaza also endangers Israelis, and that this was one of the reasons he decided to be interviewed.</span></p>
<p><span>‚ÄúIn the short term, we are safer, because we hurt Hamas. But I think we‚Äôre less secure in the long run. I see how all the bereaved families in Gaza ‚Äî which is nearly everyone ‚Äî will raise the motivation for [people to join] Hamas 10 years down the line. And it will be much easier for [Hamas] to recruit them.‚Äù</span></p>
<p><span>In a statement to +972 and Local Call, the Israeli army denied much of what the sources told us, claiming that ‚Äúeach target is examined individually, while an individual assessment is made of the military advantage and collateral damage expected from the attack ‚Ä¶ The IDF does not carry out attacks when the collateral damage expected from the attack is excessive in relation to the military advantage.‚Äù</span></p>
<h3><span>STEP 5: CALCULATING COLLATERAL DAMAGE</span></h3>
<h3>‚ÄòThe model was not connected to reality‚Äô</h3>
<p><span>According to the intelligence sources, the Israeli army‚Äôs calculation of the number of civilians expected to be killed in each house alongside a target ‚Äî a procedure examined in a </span><a href="https://www.972mag.com/mass-assassination-factory-israel-calculated-bombing-gaza/"><span>previous investigation</span></a><span> by +972 and Local Call ‚Äî was conducted with the help of automatic and inaccurate tools. In previous wars, intelligence personnel would spend a lot of time verifying how many people were in a house that was set to be bombed, with the number of civilians liable to be killed listed as part of a ‚Äútarget file.‚Äù After October 7, however, this thorough verification was largely abandoned in favor of automation.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In October, The New York Times </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/16/world/middleeast/gaza-invasion-israel-cellphone-data.html"><span>reported</span></a><span> on a system operated from a special base in southern Israel, which collects information from mobile phones in the Gaza Strip and provided the military with a live estimate of the number of Palestinians who fled the northern Gaza Strip southward. Brig. General Udi Ben Muha told the Times that ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not a 100 percent perfect system ‚Äî but it gives you the information you need to make a decision.‚Äù The system operates according to colors: red marks areas where there are many people, and green and yellow mark areas that have been relatively cleared of residents.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<div id="attachment_175999"><p><a href="https://static.972mag.com/www/uploads/2024/01/F231110AM03.jpg" data-featherlight="image"><img title="Palestinians walk on a main road after fleeing from their homes in Gaza City to the southern part of Gaza, November 10, 2023.

</div>
<p><span>The sources who spoke to +972 and Local Call described a similar system for calculating collateral damage, which was used to decide whether to bomb a building in Gaza. They said that the software calculated the number of civilians residing in each home before the war ‚Äî by assessing the size of the building and reviewing its list of residents ‚Äî and then reduced those numbers by the proportion of residents who supposedly evacuated the neighborhood.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To illustrate, if the army estimated that half of a neighborhood‚Äôs residents had left, the program would count a house that usually had 10 residents as a house containing five people. To save time, the sources said, the army did not surveil the homes to check how many people were actually living there, as it did in previous operations, to find out if the program‚Äôs estimate was indeed accurate.</span></p>
<p><span>‚ÄúThis model was not connected to reality,‚Äù claimed one source. ‚ÄúThere was no connection between those who were in the home now, during the war, and those who were listed as living there prior to the war. [On one occasion] we bombed a house without knowing that there were several families inside, hiding together.‚Äù</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The source said that although the army knew that such errors could occur, this imprecise model was adopted nonetheless, because it was faster. As such, the source said, ‚Äúthe collateral damage calculation was completely automatic and statistical‚Äù ‚Äî even producing figures that were not whole numbers.</span></p>
<h3><span>STEP 6: BOMBING A FAMILY HOME</span></h3>
<h3>‚ÄòYou killed a family for no reason‚Äô</h3>
<p><span>The sources who spoke to +972 and Local Call explained that there was sometimes a substantial gap between the moment that tracking systems like Where‚Äôs Daddy? alerted an officer that a target had entered their house, and the bombing itself ‚Äî leading to the killing of whole families even without hitting the army‚Äôs target. ‚ÄúIt happened to me many times that we attacked a house, but the person wasn‚Äôt even home,‚Äù one source said. ‚ÄúThe result is that you killed a family for no reason.‚Äù</span></p>
<p><span>Three intelligence sources told +972 and Local Call that they had witnessed an incident in which the Israeli army bombed a family‚Äôs private home, and it later turned out that the intended target of the assassination was not even inside the house, since no further verification was conducted in real time.</span></p>
<div id="attachment_174976"><p><a href="https://static.972mag.com/www/uploads/2023/11/F231106ARK01.jpg" data-featherlight="image"><img title="Palestinians receive the bodies of relatives who were killed in Israeli airstrikes, Al-Najjar Hospital, southern Gaza Strip, November 6, 2023.

(Abed Rahim Khatib/Flash90)</p>
</div>
<p><span>‚ÄúSometimes [the target] was at home earlier, and then at night he went to sleep somewhere else, say underground, and you didn‚Äôt know about it,‚Äù one of the sources said. ‚ÄúThere are times when you double-check the location, and there are times when you just say, ‚ÄòOkay, he was in the house in the last few hours, so you can just bomb.‚Äô‚Äù</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Another source described a similar incident that affected him and made him want to be interviewed for this investigation. ‚ÄúWe understood that the target was home at 8 p.m. In the end, the air force bombed the house at 3 a.m. Then we found out [in that span of time] he had managed to move himself to another house with his family. There were two other families with children in the building we bombed.‚Äù</span></p>
<p><span>In previous wars in Gaza, after the assassination of human targets, Israeli intelligence would carry out bomb damage assessment (BDA) procedures ‚Äî a routine post-strike check to see if the senior commander was killed and how many civilians were killed along with him. As revealed in a </span><a href="https://www.972mag.com/gaza-soldiers-civilians-intelligence/"><span>previous +972 and Local Call investigation</span></a><span>, this involved listening in to phone calls of relatives who lost their loved ones. In the current war, however, at least in relation to junior militants marked using AI, sources say this procedure was abolished in order to save time. The sources said they did not know how many civilians were actually killed in each strike, and for the low-ranking suspected Hamas and PIJ operatives marked by AI, they did not even know whether the target himself was killed.</span></p>
<div>
<h3>Most read on +972</h3>

</div>
<p><span>‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt know exactly how many you killed, and who you killed,‚Äù an intelligence source </span><a href="https://twitter.com/yuval_abraham/status/1750123648533324158?lang=en"><span>told Local Call</span></a><span> for a previous investigation published in January. ‚ÄúOnly when it‚Äôs senior Hamas operatives do you follow the BDA procedure. In the rest of the cases, you don‚Äôt care. You get a report from the air force about whether the building was blown up, and that‚Äôs it. You have no idea how much collateral damage there was; you immediately move on to the next target. The emphasis was to create as many targets as possible, as quickly as possible.‚Äù</span></p>
<p><span>But while the Israeli military may move on from each strike without dwelling on the number of casualties, Amjad Al-Sheikh, the Shuja‚Äôiya resident who lost 11 of his family members in the Dec. 2 bombardment, said that he and his neighbors are still searching for corpses.</span></p>
<p><span>‚ÄúUntil now, there are bodies under the rubble,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúFourteen residential buildings were bombed with their residents inside. Some of my relatives and neighbors are still buried.‚Äù</span></p>

							<p>Walking through the spice aisle of a grocery store in 2024, one selection stands out among the rest: saffron. At Whole Foods, 0.5g of ‚ÄúHand-Harvested Saffron Threads‚Äù sells for $8. In other words, it‚Äôs expensive. It‚Äôs pricey even on internet: one website offers just <a href="https://www.paellapans.com/pure-saffron-10-gram-jar/">ten tablespoons (ten grams) of saffron for $120</a>.</p><p><a href="https://bit.ly/30jM88p"><img decoding="async" src="https://daily.jstor.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/jstor_daily_patreon_membership_hat_800.jpg" alt="JSTOR Daily Membership Ad" width="800" height="196"><img src="https://daily.jstor.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/jstor_daily_patreon_membership_hat_mobile_800.jpg" alt="JSTOR Daily Membership Ad"></a></p>
<p>The irony of the Whole Foods saffron is that <em>all</em> saffron must be hand harvested from the <em>Crocus sativus </em>plant, a flower that blooms purple and blue petals in the fall. Saffron is expensive not because it‚Äôs difficult to grow, but because of the labor and tedious timing necessary to extract it from the flower. The prized reddish-orange ‚Äústigmas‚Äù stem from the middle of the plant a few weeks after the flower blooms, and they must be harvested at mid-morning, when the flower is fully open to the Sun.</p>
<p>One gardening website describes the process of harvesting saffron as something that <a href="https://www.grit.com/farm-and-garden/crops/growing-and-harvesting-saffron-zm0z18jfzsar/">should be done with tweezers at a kitchen table</a>. For centuries, saffron has been a prized dye, spice, and scent‚Äîand the harvesting process has not changed much. According <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/4352791?mag=saffron-the-story-of-the-worlds-most-expensive-spice">to a New Zealand study discussed by William C. Waterhouse</a>,</p>
<blockquote><p>in a field with modern planting and fertilization routines, it takes between 70,000 and 200,000 flowers to produce one kilogram of dried saffron threads. The flowers must be picked by hand and the stigmas removed for drying, and the result is that it takes ‚Äúaround 370‚Äì470 hours of work to produce 1 kg of dried saffron.‚Äù</p></blockquote>
<p><em>Crocus sativus</em> was derived from the naturally occurring <em>Crocus cartwrightianus</em>, which likely originated in present-day Iran. The saffron we know today came from humans ‚Äú<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780124166417000808">selecting the specimens with exceptionally long stigmas</a>.‚Äù <em>Crocus sativus</em> is sterile and doesn‚Äôt produce its own fertile seeds. Thus, humans must unearth the corms (underground reproductive roots and stems) and plant them elsewhere.</p>
		
		
<p>One of the earliest references to saffron dates to 2300 BCE, in <em>The Legend of Sargon of Akkad</em>, a Mesopotamian work that describes the birthplace of the founder of the Akkadian empire as ‚Äúcity of saffron.‚Äù The word ‚Äúsaffron‚Äù is very similar in many languages around the world. Etymologists trace the word to the Medieval Latin <a href="https://www.etymonline.com/word/saffron">‚Äúsafranum,‚Äù which comes from the Arabic word az-za‚Äôfaran.</a></p>
<p>In 2022, using ancient art and genetics, <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/news/2022/03/09/frontiers-plant-science-domestication-origin-saffron-crocus-bronze-age-greece/">new research published in <em>Frontiers</em></a> argued that <em>Crocus sativus</em> was first domesticated in Greece in approximately 1700 BCE. Many ancient Minoan art pieces depict saffron, including the fresco of blue monkeys picking saffron below. International trade brought saffron from the present-day Middle East and Mediterranean to Spain, <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/4252797?mag=saffron-the-story-of-the-worlds-most-expensive-spice">where it was likely introduced for cultivation in 921 CE</a>, write scientists C. L. Madan, B. M. Kapur, and U. S. Gupta in a 1966 issue of <em>Economic Botany</em>. Hundreds of years later, saffron could be found everywhere from the fields of England to Russia.</p>

<p><em>Crocus sativus</em> is most famously known for its culinary properties. It‚Äôs the cornerstone flavor in many dishes from around the world, ranging from paella to biryani. Some chefs describe saffron as tasting ‚Äú<a href="https://www.ice.edu/blog/what-is-saffron">slightly earthy and sweet</a>,‚Äù while giving off a ‚Äúsmoky aroma.‚Äù</p>
<p>But saffron is also prized for its medicinal and aromatic value. <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/4254486?mag=saffron-the-story-of-the-worlds-most-expensive-spice">Dov Basker and Moshe Negbi</a> write that Pliny the Elder, a Roman writer and naturalist, ‚Äúascribed [to saffron] general panacean properties [<em>sic</em>].‚Äù According to Madan et al.,</p>
<blockquote><p>Saffron in small doses was formerly attributed with sedative, expectorant, stimulant, stomachic, antispasmodic, antihysteric, and aphrodisiac properties and was also prescribed in fevers, melancholia, and enlargement of the spleen.</p></blockquote>
<p>In some cases, it was even used as an abortifacient.</p>
<p>Saffron can also be used to dye clothing items or skin. For Hindus, saffron is one of the most sacred colors, and is sometimes ‚Äúapplied as a red dye to the forehead,‚Äù write Madan et al. In Rome, explain Basker and Negbi, ‚Äúit was used to color the marriage robe.‚Äù Buddhist monks, too, famously wear robes the color of saffron, though the robes aren‚Äôt dyed with the plant.</p>
<figure id="attachment_313294" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-313294"><img decoding="async" src="https://daily.jstor.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/saffron_the_story_of_the_worlds_most_expensive_spice_3_1050.jpg" alt="Colored line engraving of saffron by C.H.

<p><em>Crocus sativus</em> flowers bloom in the fall for only a few days, and they must be picked in the early hours of the morning, by hand. The labor-intensive nature of the harvesting created a market where saffron is several times more expensive than many other popular spices. <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.2972/hesperia.80.3.0337?mag=saffron-the-story-of-the-worlds-most-expensive-spice">As archaeologist Jo Day explains,</a> ‚Äúthe fifteenth-century royal house of Navarre, for example, paid eight times as much for saffron as for pepper, itself a very costly spice‚Ä¶‚Äù</p>
<p>Today, most saffron is grown in countries where workers are paid less than their Western European counterparts would need to be. <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1051/agro:2007030">The primary producers are Iran, India, and Greece</a>. The luxury price of saffron has even spurred attempts to <a href="https://civileats.com/2018/02/07/american-grown-saffron-could-change-the-spice-trade/">grow it in the United States</a>.</p>
<figure id="attachment_313295" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-313295"><img decoding="async" src="https://daily.jstor.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/saffron_the_story_of_the_worlds_most_expensive_spice_4_1050.jpg" alt="" width="1050" height="700"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-313295">A saffron farm, Torbat heydariyeh, Razavi Khorasan province, Iran via <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Saffronfarm-860808.jpg">Wikimedia Commons&nbsp;</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>Saffron isn‚Äôt a very climate-resilient plant. Though idrought-resistant and thus thriving in <a href="https://www.fao.org/giahs/giahsaroundtheworld/designated-sites/asia-and-the-pacific/qanat-based-saffron-farming-system-in-gonabad/detailed-information/en/">semi-arid regions</a>, it fares poorly in extreme temperatures. Additionally, research suggests that ‚Äú<a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scienta.2004.06.005">a long hot summer delay[s] flower emergence</a>.‚Äù As the climate continues to warm, saffron could take longer to flower‚Äîthus delaying the payout for many small-scale farmers relying on their very small-yield plants. A need for economic diversification may be behind recent efforts by saffron farms to provide <a href="https://friendlyiran.com/iran-tour/iranian-saffron-farm-tour/">opportunities for tourism</a>.</p>

<p><em>Crocus sativus</em> is in many ways still as prized as it was when it was first domesticated. When humans decided the fiery stigmas in the middle of the flower were special, an entire economy emerged around the growth, harvest, and trade of the plant. <em>Crocus sativus </em>is one plant where mechanization has not changed the harvesting process. Such a labor-intensive harvest leads to prices that make us pause as we walk down the spice aisle.</p>

The procedure, developed by the biotechnology firm LyGenesis, marks the beginning of a clinical trial designed for people whose livers are failing, but who have not received an organ transplant.</p><article data-label="Related">

 </article><p>The approach is unusual: researchers injected healthy liver cells from a donor into a lymph node in the upper abdomen of the person with liver failure. The idea is that in several months, the cells will multiply and take over the lymph node to form a structure that can perform the blood-filtering duties of the person‚Äôs failing liver.</p><p>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a very bold and incredibly innovative idea,‚Äù says Valerie Gouon-Evans, a liver-regeneration specialist at Boston University in Massachusetts, who is not involved with the company.</p><p>The person who received the treatment, on 25 March, is recovering well from the procedure and was discharged from the clinic, says Michael Hufford, chief executive of LyGenesis, which is based in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. But physicians will need to closely monitor them for infection because the person needs to take immunosuppressive drugs so that their body doesn‚Äôt reject the donor cells, says Stuart Forbes, a hepatologist at the University of Edinburgh, UK, who is not affiliated with LyGenesis.</p><h2>Organ crisis</h2><p>More than 50,000 people in the United States die each year with liver disease. In the end stage of the disease, scar tissue that has accumulated prevents the organ from filtering toxic substances in the blood, and can lead to infection or liver cancer.</p><p>A liver transplant can help, but there is a shortage of organs: about 1,000 people in the United States die every year waiting for a transplant. Thousands more aren‚Äôt eligible because they are too ill to undergo the procedure.</p><figure>

</figure><p>LyGenesis has been trialling an approach that could help people in this situation ‚Äî and make use of donated livers that would otherwise go to waste because a person on the transplant waiting list with a compatible health profile hasn‚Äôt materialized in time. The company‚Äôs strategy delivers the donor cells through a tube in the throat, injecting them into a lymph node near the liver. Lymph nodes, which also filter waste in the body and are an important part of the immune system, are ideal for growing mini livers, Hufford says, because they receive a large supply of blood and there are hundreds of them throughout the body, so if a few are used to generate mini livers, plenty of others can continue to function as lymph nodes.</p><p>The treatment has so far worked in mice<sup><a href="#ref-CR1" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">1</a></sup>, <a href="https://atcmeetingabstracts.com/abstract/ectopic-hepatocyte-transplantation-into-the-lymph-nodes-in-a-fully-mismatched-allogeneic-dog-model-using-tacrolimus-and-prednisone/" data-track="click" data-label="https://atcmeetingabstracts.com/abstract/ectopic-hepatocyte-transplantation-into-the-lymph-nodes-in-a-fully-mismatched-allogeneic-dog-model-using-tacrolimus-and-prednisone/" data-track-category="body text link">dogs</a> and pigs<sup><a href="#ref-CR2" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">2</a></sup>. To test the therapy in pigs, researchers restricted blood flow to the animals‚Äô livers, causing the organs to fail, and injected donor cells into lymph nodes. Miniature livers formed within two months and had a cellular architecture resembling a healthy liver. Researchers even found cells that transport bile, a digestive fluid produced by the liver, in the mini livers of the pigs. In this case, they saw no build-up of bile acid, suggesting that the mini organs were processing the fluid.</p><p>Hufford says there‚Äôs reason to think that the organs won‚Äôt grow indefinitely in the lymph nodes. The mini organs rely on chemical distress signals from the failing liver to grow; once the new organs have stabilized blood filtering, they will stop growing because that distress signal disappears, he says. But it‚Äôs not yet clear precisely how large the mini-livers will become in humans, he adds.</p><p>The company aims to enrol 12 people into the phase II trial by mid-2025 and publish results the following year, Hufford says. The trial, which was approved by US regulators in 2020, will not only measure participant safety, survival time and quality of life post-treatment, but will also help to establish the ideal number of mini livers to stabilize someone‚Äôs health. The clinicians running the trial will inject liver cells in up to five of a person‚Äôs lymph nodes to determine whether the extra organs can boost the procedure‚Äôs success rate.</p><h2>A stop-gap measure</h2><p>However, mini livers might not relieve all of the complications of end-stage liver disease, says Forbes, who has formed his own company to tackle liver disease using genetically modified immune cells that stimulate repair. One of the most serious of these is portal hypertension, in which the build-up of scar tissue compresses blood vessels in the liver and can cause internal bleeding.</p><article data-label="Related">

 </article><p>Hufford acknowledges that the mini livers are not expected to address portal hypertension, but the hope is that they can provide a stopgap until a liver becomes available for transplant, or make people healthy enough to undergo a transplant. ‚ÄúThat would be amazing, because these patients currently have no other treatment options,‚Äù Gouon-Evans says.</p><p>LyGenesis has ambitions beyond mini livers, too. The company is now testing similar approaches to grow kidney and pancreas cells in the lymph nodes of animals, Hufford says.</p><p>If the liver trial is successful, Gouon-Evans says, it would be worth investigating whether a person‚Äôs own stem cells could be used to generate the cells that seed the lymph nodes. This technique could create personalized cells that capture the diversity of cells in the liver and don‚Äôt require immunosuppressive drugs, she says.</p>

<p>Ten years have passed since Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 vanished after departing from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, with 239 people aboard. Military and scientific personnel spent months combing unexplored reaches of the Indian Ocean, and though they failed to find the Boeing 777, the quest highlighted the fact that beneath the waves, vast areas of Earth‚Äôs ocean are still a mystery.</p>

<p><a href="https://seabed2030.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Seabed 2030</a> is a long-term mapping project attempting to fully chart the seafloor and reveal all features 100 meters or larger by 2030. But with just a quarter of the job now done, it still faces tremendous challenges.</p>

<figure><blockquote><p>‚ÄúMaps enable us to manage how we utilize marine space, [guide] ocean commerce and use of resources, mitigate our impacts, and achieve an improved understanding of threats such as tsunami, storm surges, and underwater landslides.‚Äù</p></blockquote></figure>

<p>The <a href="https://www.gebco.net/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">General Bathymetric Chart of the Oceans</a> (GEBCO) and <a href="https://www.nippon-foundation.or.jp/en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nippon Foundation</a>, a Japanese nonprofit that funnels profits from motorboat racing to philanthropic causes, established <a href="https://eos.org/articles/momentum-grows-for-mapping-the-seafloor" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Seabed 2030</a> in 2017. The aim was to use ocean mapping to support United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 14, namely, to ‚Äúconserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development.‚Äù At the time, only 6% of the ocean floor had been mapped to modern standards, according to the project.</p>


<p>‚ÄúMaps enable us to manage how we utilize marine space, [guide] ocean commerce and use of resources, mitigate our impacts, and achieve an improved understanding of threats such as tsunami, storm surges, and underwater landslides,‚Äù said hydrographic surveyor <a href="https://seabed2030.org/people/jamiemcmichaelphillips/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jamie McMichael-Phillips</a>, Seabed 2030‚Äôs project director. ‚ÄúEssentially, we cannot manage what we don‚Äôt know.‚Äù</p>

<h3>New Discoveries</h3>

<p>An oft-repeated observation is that we know more about the surface of Mars than Earth‚Äôs seafloor. But that has been changing with recent discoveries. Off the coasts of Central and South America, researchers with the Schmidt Ocean Institute, a Seabed 2030 partner, <a href="https://schmidtocean.org/cruise/seamounts-of-the-southeast-pacific/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">found four seamounts in January 2024</a>, including a massive one covering 450 square kilometers that is 2,681 meters tall, which is about 5 times the <a href="https://www.wtc.com/about/buildings/1-world-trade-center#:~:text=Soaring%20to%20a%20symbolic%201%2C776,an%20iconic%20New%20York%20landmark.&amp;text=With%20entrances%20on%20all%204,traffic%20of%20visitors%20%26%20office%20tenants." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">height of New York City‚Äôs One World Trade Center</a>.</p>

<p>At a depth of 1,150 meters, the giant seamounts were well hidden beneath the waves. To find these features, researchers aboard the institute‚Äôs R/V <em>Falkor (too)</em> looked for clues on the surface of the ocean. <a href="https://www.star.nesdis.noaa.gov/socd/lsa/AltBathy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Satellite altimetry</a> data can show variations in the height of the ocean surface caused by gravity anomalies. A slight depression could point to a trench, and a rise could reflect the presence of a seamount.</p>

<p>‚ÄúThe most significant aspect of our findings is the validation of the satellite altimetry data that we used to target these seamounts,‚Äù said <a href="https://schmidtocean.org/person/john-fulmer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">John Fulmer</a>, lead technician aboard the <em>Falkor (too)</em>. ‚ÄúAs all of our findings were in international waters, there is no apparent political significance to speak of, but the ease with which we were able to identify potential seamounts is a testament to the importance of collective and open data resources at our disposal.‚Äù</p>

<h3>Bringing New Tools to Bear</h3>

<p>Crowdsourcing and the use of open-source data are crucial to the Seabed 2030 project. It relies on data donations from a range of sources: scientists and philanthropists; offshore survey companies; and fishing, cruise, and cargo vessel operators. In November 2023, for instance, Seabed 2030 announced the donation of a data set covering 8,000 square kilometers of remote areas that are difficult to reach. U.K.-based remote sensing company <a href="https://seabed2030.org/2023/11/22/sizeable-data-contribution-from-argans-to-seabed-2030-fills-critical-gaps-in-definitive-ocean-map/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ARGANS (Applied Research in Geomatics, Atmosphere, Nature and Space) provided the high-resolution bathymetric data</a> derived from satellite observations, one of the main data-gathering methods along with aircraft-based lidar sensing and sonar readings. In another example, the <a href="https://seabed2030.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/sawpap_rmc_march2019_final.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Japan Coast Guard donated to GEBCO a large bathymetry data set</a> covering areas around Japan and Antarctica, according to Haruka Ogawa, a researcher in the coast guard‚Äôs <a href="https://www1.kaiho.mlit.go.jp/jhd-E.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hydrographic and Oceanographic Department</a>.</p>

<p>All Seabed 2030 data are uploaded to the free-access GEBCO grid of the seafloor. The grid shows that 24.9% has been mapped to the Seabed 2030 resolution, leaving about 75% to be done over the next 6 years if the project‚Äôs goal is to be met. That‚Äôs a massive undertaking considering challenges such as permanent ice cover near the poles and the fact that about half of the global ocean is deeper than 3,200 meters.</p>

<p>Because vessels are usually needed for the job, it makes for a slow, costly endeavor with a bias toward areas with expertly equipped ships, said <a href="https://www.mun.ca/geography/people/faculty/katleen-robert/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Katleen Robert</a>, a seafloor and habitat mapping researcher at Memorial University of Newfoundland, in Canada. She said she sees autonomous vehicles, both underwater and surface, as having the largest impact on how much of our oceans we will map in the near future.</p>

<p>‚ÄúThese will act as force multipliers and enable us to acquire higher-resolution data and repeat data sets to monitor changes over time,‚Äù said Robert, who is not directly involved with Seabed 2030, although expedition data she was involved with are supporting it.</p>

<p>In 2023, Seabed 2030 partnered with U.S. company <a href="https://www.saildrone.com/news/seabed-2030-partnership-to-map-the-ocean" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Saildrone</a> to promote the use of uncrewed hydrographic vessels. Powered mainly by wind and solar, Saildrone‚Äôs 20-meter surveyor drone can gather multibeam sonar data to depths of 7,000 meters for a fraction of the operating cost of crewed ships. One surveyor found a 1,000-meter seamount off California during a months-long surveying mission that saw 35-knot winds and 5-meter swells, according to the company.</p>

<figure><blockquote><p>‚ÄúWe know that we will be much closer to a fully mapped planet than the 6% that had been mapped when the project started.‚Äù</p></blockquote></figure>

<p>Other researchers are hoping other forms of artificial intelligence will accelerate the mapping mission. In addition to surface and underwater exploration vessels, researchers at the Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology (<a href="https://www.jamstec.go.jp/e/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">JAMSTEC</a>) are deploying deep learning techniques to enhance the resolution of existing topographic data.</p>

<p>The approach using convolutional neural networks is ‚Äúsurprisingly effective‚Äù and can be used as a complementary method to direct depth sensing, said <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/scientific-contributions/Eiichi-Kikawa-2178206065" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Eiichi Kikawa</a>, a data scientist at JAMSTEC. He added that a paper on the research has been submitted for publication.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs too early to tell whether these tools could help Seabed 2030 meet its goal in 6 years, but the project is relying on more partnerships to increase coverage of the seafloor.</p>

<p>‚ÄúWe are aware of the magnitude of the challenge that still remains and are working with the global community to push to complete the job by 2030,‚Äù McMichael-Phillips said. ‚ÄúHowever, with the progress that has already been made, and with the time left until the end of the decade, we know that we will be much closer to a fully mapped planet than the 6% that had been mapped when the project started.‚Äù</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/articles/2024/04/03/improvements-static-analysis-gcc-14-compiler">https://developers.redhat.com/articles/2024/04/03/improvements-static-analysis-gcc-14-compiler</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39917509">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
          
<p>I work at Red Hat on <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/">GCC, the GNU Compiler Collection</a>.&nbsp;For the last five releases of GCC, I've been working on <code>-fanalyzer</code>, a static analysis pass that tries to identify various problems at compile-time, rather than at runtime. It performs "symbolic execution" of <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/topics/c">C</a> source code‚Äîeffectively simulating the behavior of the code along the various possible paths of execution through it.</p>

<p>This article summarizes what's new with <code>-fanalyzer</code> in <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-14/changes.html">GCC 14</a>, which I hope will be officially released sometime in April 2024.</p>

<h2>Solving the halting problem?</h2>

<p>Obviously <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halting_problem">I'm kidding with the title</a> here, but for GCC 14 I've implemented a new warning: <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Static-Analyzer-Options.html#index-Wanalyzer-infinite-loop">-Wanalyzer-infinite-loop</a>&nbsp;that's able to detect some simple cases of infinite loops.</p>

<p>For example, consider the following C code:</p>

<pre><code>void test (int m, int n)
{
  float arr[m][n];
  for (int i = 0; i &lt; m; i++)
    for (int j = 0; j &lt; n; i++)
      arr[i][j] = 0.f;
  /* etc */
}
</code></pre>

<p>If you look closely, you'll see that the user probably made the second <code>for</code> statement by copying the first one, but forgot to change the increment clause from an <code>i</code> to a <code>j</code>.</p>

<p>GCC 14's <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Static-Analyzer-Options.html#index-fanalyzer">-fanalyzer</a>&nbsp;option successfully detects this, with this output:</p>

<pre><code> warning: infinite loop [CWE-835] [-Wanalyzer-infinite-loop]
    5 |     for (int j = 0; j &lt; n; i++)
      |                     ~~^~~
  'test': events 1-5
    |
    |    5 |     for (int j = 0; j &lt; n; i++)
    |      |                     ~~^~~  ~~~
    |      |                       |     |
    |      |                       |     (4) looping back...
    |      |                       (1) infinite loop here
    |      |                       (2) when 'j &lt; n': always following 'true' branch...
    |      |                       (5) ...to here
    |    6 |       arr[i][j] = 0.f;
    |      |       ~~~~~~~~~        
    |      |             |
    |      |             (3) ...to here
    |
</code></pre>

<p>The output could be more readable here‚Äîyou have to read the events in order of their numbers, from <code>(1)</code> to <code>(5)</code>. For GCC 15 I hope to improve this, perhaps with ASCII art that highlights the path taken by control flow.</p>

<p>I find the Compiler Explorer website very useful for trying out code snippets with different compilers and options. You can try the above example on it <a href="https://godbolt.org/z/vn55nn43z">here</a>.</p>

<h2>Visualizing buffer overflows</h2>

<p>The analyzer gained support in GCC 13 for bounds checking with a <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Static-Analyzer-Options.html#index-Wanalyzer-out-of-bounds">-Wanalyzer-out-of-bounds</a>&nbsp;warning.</p>

<p>For example, given the out-of-bounds write in <code>strcat</code> in:</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;string.h&gt;

void test (void)
{
  char buf[10];
  strcpy (buf, "hello");
  strcat (buf, " world!");
}
</code></pre>

<p>The analyzer emits this message:</p>

<p>I've been unhappy with the readability of these messages: it describes some aspects of the problem, but it's hard for the user to grasp exactly what the analyzer is "thinking."</p>

<p>So for GCC 14, I've added the ability for the analyzer to emit text-based diagrams visualizing the spatial relationships in a predicted buffer overflow. For the above example (which you can try <a href="https://godbolt.org/z/qM3hYKzjx">here in Compiler Explorer</a>) it emits the diagram shown in Figure 1.</p>

<figure role="group">

  </figure><figcaption>Figure 1:&nbsp;Visualizing buffer overflows in GCC 14.</figcaption></figure><p>This diagram shows the destination buffer populated by the content from the <code>strcpy</code> call, and thus the existing terminating <code>NUL</code> byte used for the start of the <code>strcat</code> call.</p>

<p>For non-ASCII strings such as this:</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;string.h&gt;

void test (void)
{
  char buf[11];
  strcpy (buf, "„Çµ„ÉÑ„Ç≠");
  strcat (buf, "„É°„Ç§");
}
</code></pre>

<p>It can show the UTF-8 representation of the characters (Figure 2).</p>

  </figure><figcaption>Figure 2: Visualizing non-ASCII strings in GCC 14.</figcaption></figure><p>This demonstrates that the overflow happens partway through the <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E3%83%A1">„É° character (U+30E1)</a>.

<h2>Analyzing C string operations</h2>

<p>I've put some work into better tracking C string operations in GCC 14's analyzer.</p>

<p>One of the improvements is that the analyzer now simulates APIs that scan a buffer expecting a null terminator byte, and will complain about code paths where a pointer to a buffer that isn't properly terminated is passed to such an API.</p>

<p>I've added a new function attribute <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Common-Function-Attributes.html#index-null_005fterminated_005fstring_005farg-function-attribute">null_terminated_string_arg(<em>PARAM_IDX</em>)</a>&nbsp;for telling the analyzer (and human readers of the code) about parameters that are expected to be null-terminated strings. For example, given this buggy code:</p>

<pre><code>extern char *
example_fn (const char *p)
  __attribute__((null_terminated_string_arg (1)))
  __attribute__((nonnull));

char *
test_unterminated_str (void)
{
  char str[3] = "abc";
  return example_fn (str);
}
</code></pre>

<p>Here, the analyzer correctly complains that <code>str</code> doesn't have a null terminator byte, and thus <code>example_fn</code> will presumably read past the end of the buffer:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;source&gt;: In function 'test_unterminated_str':

<h2>Taint analysis</h2>

<p>The analyzer has a form of "taint analysis", which tracks attacker-controlled inputs, places where they are sanitized, and places where they are used without sanitization. In previous GCC releases this was too buggy to enable by default, with lots of false positives, so I hid it behind an extra command-line argument. I've fixed many bugs with this, so for GCC 14 I've enabled this by default when <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Static-Analyzer-Options.html#index-fanalyzer">-fanalyzer</a>&nbsp;is selected. This also enables these 6 taint-based warnings:</p>

<ul><li><a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Static-Analyzer-Options.html#index-Wanalyzer-tainted-allocation-size">-Wanalyzer-tainted-allocation-size</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Static-Analyzer-Options.html#index-Wanalyzer-tainted-array-index">-Wanalyzer-tainted-array-index</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Static-Analyzer-Options.html#index-Wanalyzer-tainted-assertion">-Wanalyzer-tainted-assertion</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Static-Analyzer-Options.html#index-Wanalyzer-tainted-divisor">-Wanalyzer-tainted-divisor</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Static-Analyzer-Options.html#index-Wanalyzer-tainted-offset">-Wanalyzer-tainted-offset</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Static-Analyzer-Options.html#index-Wanalyzer-tainted-size">-Wanalyzer-tainted-size</a></li>
</ul><p>For example, here's an excerpt from <a href="https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-2210">CVE-2011-2210</a> from the Linux kernel:</p>

<pre><code>extern struct hwrpb_struct *hwrpb;

SYSCALL_DEFINE5(osf_getsysinfo, unsigned long, op, void __user *, buffer,
		unsigned long, nbytes, int __user *, start, void __user *, arg)
{
	/* [...snip...] */

	/* case GSI_GET_HWRPB: */
		if (nbytes &lt; sizeof(*hwrpb))
			return -1;

		if (copy_to_user(buffer, hwrpb, nbytes) != 0)
			return -2;

		return 1;

	/* [...snip...] */
}
</code></pre>

<p>You can see <a href="https://godbolt.org/z/sqsx8avfG">a more full version at Compiler Explorer</a>. In particular, I added <code>__attribute__((tainted_args))</code> to the <code>__SYSCALL_DEFINEx</code> macro to indicate to the analyzer that the arguments to <code>osf_getsysinfo</code> are coming from across a trust boundary, and thus should be considered tainted.</p>

<p>With GCC 14, the analyzer is able to detect the vulnerability (again, edited somewhat for brevity):</p>

<pre><code>&lt;source&gt;: In function 'sys_osf_getsysinfo':

</code></pre>

<p>The issue is that the attempt to sanitize <code>nbytes</code> was written as</p>

<pre><code>if (nbytes &lt; sizeof(*hwrpb))</code></pre>

<p>when it should have been</p>

<pre><code>if (nbytes &gt; sizeof(*hwrpb))</code></pre>

<p>With a fixed version of that conditional, the <a href="https://godbolt.org/z/vecezenKj">analyzer is silent</a>.</p>

<p>I'm continuing to work on running the analyzer on the kernel to look for vulnerabilities (and fix false positives in the analyzer).</p>

<h2>Try it out!</h2>

<p>We're still fixing bugs, but we hope that <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-14/changes.html">GCC 14</a> will be ready to officially release (as 14.1) sometime in April 2024.</p>

<p>With my "downstream" hat on, we're already using the prerelease (GCC 14.0) within <a href="https://fedoramagazine.org/announcing-fedora-linux-40-beta/">Fedora 40 Beta</a>.</p>

<p>Finally, you can use the <a href="https://godbolt.org/z/YTx3Pfocn">excellent Compiler Explorer site</a> to play with the new compiler. Have fun!</p>

In the future, we plan to automatically optimize storage classes for data so you can avoid manually creating rules and better adapt to changing data access patterns.</p><p>For data stored in the Infrequent Access storage class, the pricing components will be similar to <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/pricing/">what you‚Äôre used to with R2</a>: storage, <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/pricing/#class-a-operations">Class A operations</a> (writes, lists), <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/pricing/#class-b-operations">Class B operations</a> (reads), and data retrieval (processing). Data retrieval is charged per GB when data in the Infrequent Access storage class is retrieved and is what allows us to provide storage at a lower price. It reflects the additional computational resources required to fetch data from underlying storage optimized for less frequent access. And when the time comes, and you do need to use your data, there are still no egress fees.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html-->

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/04/02/ftc_boss_apple_daily_show/">https://www.theregister.com/2024/04/02/ftc_boss_apple_daily_show/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39916939">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p><span>Comment</span> Generally the head of US government agencies and comedy don't mix, but on Monday night Lina Khan, boss of the Federal Trade Commission, was on the Daily Show recounting how the agency is going after Amazon, Facebook and others over monopolistic practices. She also got evidence of her <em>persona non grata</em> status with Cook &amp; Co.</p>
<p>Khan was welcomed onto the telly news commentary show, chaired once again by Jon Stewart, with cheers from the crowd - again not something many US government officials hear. The exception to this is possibly Rob Joyce, the former White House cybersecurity coordinator and recently <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.nsa.gov/Press-Room/Press-Releases-Statements/Press-Release-View/Article/3681065/national-security-agency-announces-retirement-of-cybersecurity-director/">retired</a> NSA cybersecurity director, who got a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2018/01/22/rob_joyce_hacking/">standing ovation</a> at the Shmoocon infosec conference after a presentation on how he hacks Christmas tree lights for fun.</p>
<p>In the 20-minute interview, Khan gave details on an ongoing lawsuit against Amazon's behavior - notably allegedly spamming search results pages and hiking fees on small businesses, which she said was "harming customers."</p>

    

<p>You can replay her appearance on the Comedy Central / Paramount+ / kinda YouTube program below.</p>

        


        

<p>
  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaDTiWaYfcM" data-media="x-videoplayer">Youtube Video</a>
</p>
<p>It was going to be a tough fight, she said, since her watchdog agency has just 1,200 staff and Amazon has "monopoly money," and can throw ten times that number of lawyers at the case. "We're pretty out-gunned but not out-matched," she asserted.</p>

        

<p>But then Stewart dropped his bombshell: After a two-season podcast series with Apple he told Khan he wanted to get her on the show but Cupertino really wasn't keen.</p>
<p>"Apple asked us not to do it, to have you. They literally said 'please don't talk to her'... I didn't think they cared for you," Stewart said. Khan made an admirable, and nearly successful, attempt to keep a straight face.</p>
<p>Stewart also alleged that Apple refused to let his team make jokes about AI. He quit the podcast abruptly last October, reportedly citing Apple's heavy handed approach to censoring certain topics and guests.</p>

        

<p>"This just shows the dangers when you concentrate so much power and so much decision-making in a small number of companies," she argued.</p>
<p>"Going back all the way to the founding there was a recognition that in the same way that you need the Constitution to create checks and balances in our political sphere, you also needed the antitrust and anti-monopoly laws to safeguard against concentration of economic power because you don't want an autocrat of trade in the same way you don't want a monarch."</p>

</ul>
<p>The amount of consolidation in the tech industry is harming competition, she argued. The FTC's case against Meta (<a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2020/12/09/facebook_crushed_competitors_to_maintain/">started</a> before Khan got the top job) was a case in point - Facebook realized it couldn't defeat Instagram and WhatsApp, so just bought them, she asserted.</p>
<h3>So, how's that working out? Pretty good it seems</h3>
<p>When Khan <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2021/06/16/lina_khan_ftc/">was appointed</a> FTC chair in 2021 it must have sent shivers down the spine of many in the tech industry, particularly in Seattle.</p>
<p>Her 2017 <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.yalelawjournal.org/pdf/e.710.Khan.805_zuvfyyeh.pdf">paper</a> [PDF] titled "Amazon's antitrust paradox" lays out the case that too few players exert a disproportionate amount of power in the tech industry.</p>
<p>And while traditionally monopolies were thought of as a single company dominating the industry (<em>cough</em>, Microsoft in the 1990s), customers are still shafted if even a few businesses corner a market.</p>
<p>As an immigrant to Silicon Valley and the San Francisco Bay Area it is astonishing to this humble vulture that this free-market nation is anything but in so many areas. Though it depends on where one lives, good luck getting a decent, healthy choice of ISP or cellphone carrier. And for a region that is a major tech hub of America the internet speeds and prices came as a rude shock.</p>
<p>Coming from Europe where telcos fight for your business, the change was remarkable. This hack may have been somewhat terse with a Verizon staffer trying to tell me that paying for text messages (an engineering function that carries the most minimal of data loads) was cheap at the price of just $5 a month. But with so little choice such predatory pricing is possible.</p>
<p>So far, the FTC appears to be getting much more muscular in going after alleged monopolistic practices, and it's about time. Frankly it's insane that an agency with such an important role in ensuring fair and open markets has such tiny staffing levels and funding.</p>
<p>But while the regulator is small it does have legal powers, and is increasingly asserting them. The question is how far can they be pushed, and with what consequences.</p>
<p>On <em>The Register</em>, when folks get fined we generally cite the sometimes large figures involved as a proportion of current profit, to give some perspective. When the FTC imposed a $5bn fine on Facebook back in 2019 over the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2019/07/12/ftc_facebook_settlement_proposal/">Cambridge Analytica scandal</a>, for example, that amounted to one percent of its market cap. Zuckerberg must have been shaking in his sneakers.</p>
<p>And this was the point Khan made: "Over the last couple of decades we've seen how businesses can just treat fines as a cost of doing business. And we need to make sure we're actually deterring illegal behavior."</p>
<p>The Tl;dr: Businesses only obey the bottom line. ¬Æ</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The way that most physicists teach and talk about partial differential equations is horrible, and has surprisingly big costs for the typical understanding of the foundations of the field even among professionals.  The chief victims are students of thermodynamics and analytical mechanics, and I‚Äôve mentioned before that the <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/titles/content/sicm/book-Z-H-5.html#%_chap_Temp_2">preface</a> of Sussman and Wisdom‚Äôs <em>Structure and Interpretation of Classical Mechanics</em> is a good starting point for thinking about these issues.  As a pointed example, in this blog post I‚Äôll look at how badly the Legendre transform is taught in standard textbooks,<a href="#footnote-20" id="refmark-20"><sup killerfootnote=""><b><big>a‚Äâ‚Äâ</big></b></sup></a> and compare it to how it <i>could</i> be taught.  In a subsequent post, I‚Äôll used this as a springboard for complaining about the way we record and transmit physics knowledge.</p><p>Before we begin: turn away from the screen and see if you can remember what the Legendre transform accomplishes <em>mathematically</em> in classical mechanics.<a href="#footnote-1" id="refmark-1"><sup killerfootnote=""><b><big>b‚Äâ‚Äâ</big></b></sup></a> I don‚Äôt just mean that the Legendre transform converts the Lagrangian into the Hamiltonian and vice versa, but rather: what key mathematical/geometric property does the Legendre transform have, compared to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_transforms">cornucopia of other function transforms</a>, that allows it to connect these two conceptually distinct formulations of mechanics?</p><p>(Analogously, the question ‚ÄúWhat is useful about the Fourier transform for understanding translationally invariant systems?‚Äù can be answered by <a href="https://terrytao.wordpress.com/2009/04/06/the-fourier-transform/">something like</a> ‚ÄúTranslationally invariant operations in the spatial domain correspond to multiplication in the Fourier domain‚Äù or ‚ÄúThe Fourier transform is a change of basis, within the vector space of functions, using translationally invariant basis elements, i.e., the Fourier modes‚Äù.)</p><h4>The status quo</h4><p>Let‚Äôs turn to the canonical text by Goldstein for an example of how the Legendre transform is usually introduced.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <p>We‚Äôre <a href="https://sequin.io/?ref=blog.sequin.io">Sequin</a>. We stream data from services like Salesforce, Stripe, and AWS to messaging systems like Kafka and databases like Postgres. As an infrastructure company, we questioned if we really need a SPA. So, we started with LiveView, which helped us move fast but left us wanting more. This post is about that journey.
</p>
<p>Phoenix's <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix_live_view/Phoenix.LiveView.html?ref=blog.sequin.io">LiveView</a> has polarized our team. Compared to SPA, there are components and features that we‚Äôre able to build 2-3x faster. Conversely, there are components and features that are frustrating to build or feel very counterintuitive.</p>
<p>Said another way, LiveView makes a lot of things easy. But it also makes some easy things hard.</p>
<p>This created tension. Do we keep forging down this path? Or do we give in and convert our app to a SPA?</p>
<p>Fortunately, we found a companion library called <a href="https://github.com/woutdp/live_svelte?ref=blog.sequin.io">LiveSvelte</a>. LiveView enables a development experience with Svelte that‚Äôs unlike any other fullstack paradigm I‚Äôve used.</p>
<p>The team agrees: this is a killer way to build.</p>
<p>To appreciate the LiveView+Svelte paradigm, I‚Äôll start by explaining how LiveView works and what makes it different. Then, I‚Äôll detail the friction we encountered with a pure LiveView approach. At that point, you‚Äôll be able to appreciate what LiveSvelte offers.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-liveview">What is LiveView</h2>
<p>LiveView offers a very unique way to build web applications.</p>
<p>In a traditional server-rendered web application, the server is stateless. The client requests a page and the server renders it. All client actions route back to the server, which re-renders the next page.</p>
<p>In a SPA, the client is in charge of building pages. It leverages a backend API to read and write data. Client apps are stateful (e.g. <code>useState</code> in React).</p>
<p>In LiveView, the server is in charge of rendering the page. But it‚Äôs stateful. Actions in the frontend are handled by the backend, but the server <em>incrementally</em> updates the DOM, much like in a SPA.</p>
<p>At a high-level, the reason a SPA is complex is because distributed systems are complex. Supporting a client JS app is supporting a microservice (and one that runs in a hostile, untrusted environment, no less!)</p>
<p>In <em>theory</em> your frontend app uses a backend REST API that <em>could</em> be used to support lots of different services and clients. In reality, the needs of your frontend app are unique. So your backend routes and controllers explode with functions that serve the needs of a single client.</p>
<p>If nothing else, this complexity just means shaving a lot of yaks. Each request requires a fair bit of plumbing on both the frontend and the backend. Callstacks can easily exceed half a dozen layers:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>onMount</code></li>
<li><code>await api.fetchUsers</code></li>
<li><code>parseResponse</code></li>
<li><code>Router.handle(/api/users)</code></li>
<li><code>AuthPlug.verify_cookie</code></li>
<li><code>UsersController.index</code></li>
<li><code>Users.list_for_org</code></li>
<li><code>ApiHelpers.prepare_response</code></li>
</ul>
<p>The promise of LiveView is that you get to create rich client-side experiences without the frontend microservice. You're back to the much simpler world where you can query the database in the function adjacent to the function that renders your table rows. If a new row comes in, you just need to push it to your table, and LiveView will update the client for you.</p>
<p>But in addition, you also get to enjoy building an app using the stateful paradigm of frontend frameworks. It's much easier and faster to build rich interaction patterns this way vs prior backend paradigms where you'd need to "rebuild the world" on each request.</p>
<h2 id="where-liveview-makes-easy-things-hard">Where LiveView makes easy things hard</h2>
<p>There's a lot of good stuff in LiveView. But there are also real thorns.</p>
<p>There are two primary areas that we struggled with LiveView:</p>
<h3 id="client-side-state-is-inevitable">Client-side state is inevitable</h3>
<p>There is a (literal) speed of light limitation with this approach: your server can only be <em>so close</em> to your users.</p>
<p>Invariably, you‚Äôre going to need to do some stuff client-side. Animations, tooltips, showing/hiding DOM elements, disabling form fields, etc.</p>
<p>For example, there‚Äôs a form in our app with two interdependent dropdowns. Selecting an option in the first dropdown allows our server to generate the list for the second dropdown. To get the best UX, you want to disable the second dropdown immediately after the first dropdown changes. Then, when it‚Äôs repopulated by the server, you can re-enable it:</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.sequin.io/content/images/2024/03/CleanShot-2024-03-28-at-10.58.11-1.gif" alt="Two dropdowns, the second is disabled after the first changes">
</p>
<p><em>Simulating 1000ms of roundtrip latency between the client and the server.</em></p>
<p>To pull this off, as far as we could tell, you need to use two independent concepts in LiveView:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use the <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix_live_view/Phoenix.LiveView.JS.html?ref=blog.sequin.io">JS module</a> to disable the second dropdown when the first dropdown changes.</li>
<li>Use a <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix_live_view/js-interop.html?ref=blog.sequin.io#client-hooks-via-phx-hook">hook</a> to register an event listener on the second dropdown. Then, send an action to re-enable the second dropdown from the backend.</li>
</ul>
<p>And for slightly more complex interaction patterns, you‚Äôll need to incorporate a <em>third</em> concept, LiveView state. For example, maybe you only want to re-enable the second dropdown in certain conditions.</p>
<p>The way these three concepts fit together is not obvious (we‚Äôre still not sure this is the right pattern!)</p>
<p>So, while the server is in charge of a lot of DOM changes, it can‚Äôt command all of them. You use JS and hooks to sprinkle in JavaScript where needed. These tools feel side-chained to core LiveView, and therefore their patterns of use are not obvious. And the more JS and hooks you use, the more of your DOM state now exists <em>outside</em> of LiveView.</p>
<p>This is a stark contrast to a paradigm like React. In React, it‚Äôs state and actions all the way down. With that core concept, you can do most anything. And there is no blurry line between DOM state and component state.</p>
<p>React can take that approach because there‚Äôs no latency between client-side actions and client-side state. This means you can let React‚Äôs state paradigm handle every action and transition. Because all of LiveView‚Äôs state is server-side, it has to contend with the latency between client-side actions and server-side state. This means that while LiveView state <em>looks like</em> other frontend frameworks, the model is actually quite different.</p>
<p>Take input fields, for example. In React, a character can‚Äôt be inserted into an input field without routing through state. This unlocks a powerful programming model, where your component re-renders ‚Äì and therefore responds ‚Äì to every keystroke. It gives the state and action paradigm a lot of reach, where you can use one core concept (<code>useState</code>) to solve a huge space of problems.</p>
<p>In LiveView, it‚Äôs more accurate to say that the input field is changed by the user, <em>and then</em> a short while later LiveView finds out about it and reacts to it. With no latency, <em>it looks a lot like React</em>. But with increased latency, it‚Äôs quite a different paradigm.</p>
<p>In frontend frameworks like React, you need to contend with server-side latency all the time. But <em>when</em> a high-latency action is going to take place is clear (i.e. you‚Äôre fetching from a server). In LiveView, the boundary is murkier.</p>
<h3 id="three-components">Three components</h3>
<p>LiveView has three different types of components: LiveViews, LiveComponents, and Components.</p>
<p>LiveViews and LiveComponents are like stateful components in React, whereas Components are like functional components.</p>
<p>Importantly, a LiveView will always be the uppermost parent component. You render LiveComponents and Components as children underneath a LiveView.</p>
<p>In React, it's easy to switch between stateful and functional components‚Äìjust add or remove <code>useState</code> hooks. The API for both are the same (they both accept props in the same way). And outside state, they have an identical feature set. For example, they can both register and respond to DOM events in the same way.</p>
<p>The ease of switching between component types is important. As an app matures, you‚Äôre constantly factoring out components. You‚Äôre figuring out which bits should be reused, what should be generalized, where state should live, etc.</p>
<p>In LiveView, all three components are very different. As a result, refactoring a LiveView into a LiveComponent is surprisingly cumbersome.</p>
<p>In particular:</p>
<ul>
<li>The syntax for rendering and passing props to LiveViews and LiveComponents is different.</li>
<li>The lifecycle of LiveViews and LiveComponents are different.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix_live_view/Phoenix.LiveComponent.html?ref=blog.sequin.io#module-unifying-liveview-and-livecomponent-communication">communication options</a> between LiveViews and LiveComponents are different. For example, you <code>send</code> to LiveViews but <code>send_update</code> to LiveComponents.</li>
<li>LiveComponents are not processes, and so can't interact with the rest of the system like LiveViews can.</li>
</ul>
<p>That last point is what makes LiveComponents so different and so frustrating. The limitations <em>make sense</em>: A LiveView is a process. That's one of the best parts about a LiveView, they're "just processes" and so they can fit into your Elixir/OTP system like every other process. For example, you can use pub/sub in a LiveView to subscribe to system-wide changes.</p>
<p>A LiveComponent is <em>not</em> its own process, they are modules invoked by a LiveView. The parent LiveView process holds the state for all subcomponents. So, a LiveView has a <code>pid</code>, state, and an inbox; a LiveComponent does not. This means the LiveView also has to handle all message routing for its child LiveComponents.</p>
<p>This is in keeping with Elixir/OTP design principles: processes are the building blocks. To give LiveComponents the same powers of independent state management and action handling, they would each need to be their own process.</p>
<p>Still, for the life of me, I <em>really</em> struggled with LiveComponents. So often, I wanted to send my LiveComponent an event/action but didn't have a good way to do it. You end up using <code>send_update</code>, which is an awkward API. We couldn't decide: do we send <em>actions</em> via <code>send_update</code>, or do we use it to patch state? If we use it to patch state, how do we tell in our <code>update</code> clause whether we're mounting or updating?</p>
<h2 id="the-elusive-%E2%80%9Cliveview-way%E2%80%9D">The elusive ‚ÄúLiveView way‚Äù</h2>
<p>LiveView often made us feel like we were ‚Äúmissing something.‚Äù The ‚ÄúLiveView way‚Äù feels elusive.</p>
<p>Perhaps LiveView is in an uncanny valley. It shares a lot in common with contemporary frontend frameworks. So, our ‚ÄúReact brains‚Äù and intuitions would kick in, driving us to use old patterns‚Äìbut those would often lead to a dead end. More alienness would have forced us to recognize the differences and to approach problems differently.</p>
<p>You can do a lot with just LiveView state and actions. But there are limits, and when you hit them you need to switch paradigms.</p>
<p>It has components to help you organize and reuse code. But due to differences between JavaScript and Elixir, LiveView can‚Äôt really offer the same isomorphic component trees without a ton of abstraction, and so has LiveViews and LiveComponents.</p>
<p><strong>This is what makes LiveSvelte so promising</strong>. As you‚Äôll see, it shifts more responsibility to the frontend. It embraces the fact that the frontend will have its own state. And it lets you take advantage of all the maturity of contemporary JavaScript component frameworks.</p>
<h2 id="liveview-svelte">LiveView + Svelte</h2>
<p>LiveSvelte lets you render Svelte components from LiveView. It's an awesome paradigm.</p>
<p>There‚Äôs a couple different ways to render Svelte from your LiveViews, but the most basic way looks like this:</p>
<pre><code># LiveView component
defmodule Web.SyncLive.Form do
  def render(assigns) do
    assigns = 
      assigns
      |&gt; Map.put(:encoded_collections, Enum.map(assigns.collections, &amp;encode_collection/1))
      |&gt; Map.put(:encoded_errors, encode_errors(assigns.changeset))
  
    ~H"""
      &lt;.svelte
        name="MyForm"
        props={
          %{
            collections: @encoded_collections,
            credential_options: @credential_options,
            errors: @encoded_errors,
          }
        }
        socket={@socket}
      /&gt;
    """
  end
end
</code></pre>
<p>This is an Elixir module, the LiveView. Inside the render, we first take our Elixir data structures and encode them for the frontend. We like the pattern of explicitly encoding Elixir structs and such as plain maps before passing to Svelte, like this:</p>
<pre><code>  defp encode_collection(%Collection{} = collection) do
    %{
      "id" =&gt; collection.id,
      "slug" =&gt; collection.slug,
      "name" =&gt; collection.name
    }
  end
</code></pre>
<p>We‚Äôre able to set props on the Svelte component. Those are passed down as you‚Äôd expect to the component:</p>
<pre><code>// Svelte component
&lt;script&gt;
  export let resource;
  export let credential_options = [];
  export let errors = {};
  export let live;
&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>One of the props that LiveSvelte sets for us is the <code>live</code> prop. To communicate from the Svelte component back up to the LiveView, we can call <code>live.pushEvent</code>. For example, check how easy it is to send the server changes to the form:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;script&gt;
  // ...
  $: {
    live.pushEvent("form_updated", { form }, () =&gt; {});
  }
&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>This is a reactive block in Svelte. It will be executed whenever the variable <code>form</code> is changed. (Kind of like a <code>useEffect</code>, where <code>form</code> is the dependency.)</p>
<p>The LiveView can handle and respond to the <code>pushEvent</code> using typical Elixir message handling semantics:</p>
<pre><code># In the LiveView
# ...
  @impl LiveView
  def handle_event("form_updated", %{"form" =&gt; form}, socket) do
    params = decode_params(socket, form)
    {:noreply, merge_changeset(socket, params)}
  end
  
  defp merge_changeset(socket, params) do
    changeset = Collection.create_changeset(socket.assigns.resource, params)

    assign(socket, :changeset, changeset)
  end
</code></pre>
<p>We first decode the params from the frontend, reversing any encoding/mapping we did on the way out. Then, <code>merge_changeset/2</code> updates our changeset. If there are any validation errors in the changeset, those will make their way back to the frontend via the <code>errors</code> prop.</p>
<p>So, you have data flow from Elixir down to the component via props. The LiveView process can update props at any time to cause the Svelte component to re-render. Any other communication can happen via the websocket.</p>
<p>The boundary between the two is very clear‚Äìjust as clear as in any SPA.</p>
<p>What's most game-changing, though, is that you have a <em>backend, stateful process</em> that is collaborating with a <em>frontend, stateful process</em>.</p>
<p>And it's <em>so</em> fun and productive.</p>
<p>The three powerhouse properties:</p>
<ol>
<li>The backend controls the props on the frontend component.</li>
<li>The frontend <em>and</em> the backend are stateful.</li>
<li>You have a private, bi-directional communication channel between the two <em>where either side can initiate a message to the other</em>.</li>
</ol>
<p>#1 is made possible thanks to LiveView‚Äôs rendering paradigm: re-renders on the server are automatically pushed and applied to the client. This lets the server update props on the component just like a JS parent component can!</p>
<p>#2 is possible because a LiveView is a process. Processes are how Elixir encapsulates and reduces state.</p>
<p>#3 is made possible by the persistent websocket that LiveView gives you, wired to the frontend.</p>
<p>Consider the differences between this paradigm and a SPA:</p>
<p>First, all browser routing happens via the backend. This is a great simplifier. (In a regular SPA you have to maintain <em>two</em> sets of routes, one for the browser and one for your API.)</p>
<p>Second, the backend is stateful. It knows what route you‚Äôre on. Which resource you‚Äôre working with. Each action it handles can be far more incremental, as it‚Äôs applying a state change to itself vs rebuilding state from scratch.</p>
<p>Third, communication between the frontend and backend is private and coupled, as it should be. You‚Äôre not ‚Äúpolluting‚Äù your server‚Äôs public routes with a bunch of RPC calls that support a single component. When you see a <code>pushEvent</code> in the client, you know exactly where the handler for that is ‚Äì in the collaborating Elixir module.</p>
<p>Fourth, functionality is split across just two files. Sure, the backend module will call out to your backend functions (e.g. fetch data from database) and the frontend will import components and styles. But roundtrips between the two aren‚Äôt routing through a stack of API modules, routers, and controllers.</p>
<p>Fifth, communication between frontend and backend is far less ceremonious. The backend can simply update props to inform frontend changes. And the frontend can <code>pushEvent</code> without needing handlers for expired tokens, timeouts, or outages. It‚Äôs binary: either the websocket is open which means the server is open for business, or it‚Äôs not in which case LiveView helpfully shows the user a global ‚Äúdisconnected‚Äù banner.</p>
<p>In the simplest terms, the frontend microservice is eliminated.</p>
<p>What you end up with feels like such a great split of responsibilities with very little boilerplate. All your business logic is on the backend ‚Äì how you load data, <em>which</em> data to load, how to sort and filter the data, your validators, etc. Your frontend code is stupid simple. In Svelte, it‚Äôs all (1) <code>if/end</code> blocks to conditionally render stuff (2) animations and (3) a few dead simple <code>pushEvent</code> functions back to the server.</p>
<p>That last part has been blowing my mind. The typical SPA frontend is full of so much logic, usually <code>map</code>, <code>reduce</code>, and <code>filter</code> in order to process server data, prepare data for display, or prepare data for the server. In a LiveSvelte app, all this can just happen server-side. The LiveView can prepare data exactly as the Svelte component needs it. This keeps complexity in your server language, in your server's data structures, and in your server's test suite.</p>
<p>The backend LiveView and the frontend Svelte component aren't so much coupled as they are two halves: the LiveView only renders that Svelte component, and that Svelte component is only ever rendered by that LiveView.</p>
<p>In contrast to a ‚Äúregular‚Äù LiveView, this paradigm:</p>
<ul>
<li>Embraces state and state transitions in the frontend.</li>
<li>Creates a clear boundary layer between the frontend and backend.</li>
<li>Leverages Svelte‚Äôs component paradigm, which like other contemporary JS frameworks is very mature and familiar.</li>
<li>In general, lets great frontend frameworks do what they do best! A pure LiveView approach doesn‚Äôt let you tap into this huge ecosystem. (For example, Svelte comes with great animation primitives.)</li>
</ul>
<p>By moving more into the frontend, we no longer felt like we were straddling an awkward middleground.</p>
<p>We chose LiveSvelte because React didn't have a similarly complete LiveView library. The joy of working with Svelte has been a very happy bonus. Because LiveView does the heavy lifting with state management, our state management in Svelte is very simple. For basic state and reactivity, Svelte is the lightest and fastest frontend framework I've worked with. We also prefer its templating features to React's, namely getting to use <code>if/else</code> instead of ternary operators and its conditional property setting.</p>
<p>Further, Svelte 5 is around the corner, and we're bullish on its <a href="https://svelte.dev/blog/runes?ref=blog.sequin.io">runes</a>. We think it makes Svelte even easier to pick up and reason about, meaning everyone on the team is empowered to traverse the stack.</p>
<p>I‚Äôm now convinced LiveView shines brightest as a backend-for-frontend. By rendering frontend components, incrementally updating them, maintaining a stateful backend process, and providing a websocket API, it creates a tremendously productive platform for frontend applications.</p>
<p>If you‚Äôre using LiveView and resonated with any of the friction I highlighted, you need to give this a try. If you‚Äôve never used LiveView, you‚Äôll find that this paradigm <em>lowers</em> the learning curve. This is because you‚Äôre able to use a lot of the JavaScript framework primitives you‚Äôre used to.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>You've just made a class.
You made a <code>__init__</code> method.
Now what?</p>
<p>Python includes <em>tons</em> of <a href="https://www.pythonmorsels.com/what-are-dunder-methods/" target="_blank">dunder methods</a> ("double underscore" methods) which allow us to deeply customize how our custom classes interact with Python's many features.
What dunder methods could you add to your class to make it friendly for other Python programmers who use it?</p>
<p>Let's take a look at <strong>every dunder method in Python</strong>, with a focus on when each method is useful.</p>
<p>Note that the Python documentation refers to these as <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-special-method" target="_blank">special methods</a> and notes the synonym "magic method" but <em>very</em> <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#reserved-classes-of-identifiers" target="_blank">rarely</a> uses the term "dunder method".
However, "dunder method" is a fairly common Python colloquialism, as noted in my <a href="https://www.pythonmorsels.com/terms/" target="_blank">unofficial Python glossary</a>.</p>
<p>You can use the links scattered throughout this page for more details on any particular dunder method.
For a list of all of them, see the cheat sheet in the final section.</p>
<div>
<p><a href="#cheat-sheet">Just show me the cheat sheet</a>
</p></div>
<h2 id="the-3-essential-dunder-methods">The 3 essential dunder methods üîë</h2>
<p>There are 3 dunder methods that <em>most</em> classes should have: <a href="https://www.pythonmorsels.com/what-is-init/" target="_blank"><code>__init__</code></a>, <a href="https://www.pythonmorsels.com/customizing-string-representation-your-objects/" target="_blank"><code>__repr__</code></a>, and <a href="https://www.pythonmorsels.com/overloading-equality-in-python/" target="_blank"><code>__eq__</code></a>.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Operation</th>
<th>Dunder Method Call</th>
<th>Returns</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><code>T(a, b=3)</code></td>
<td><code>T.__init__(x, a, b=3)</code></td>
<td><code>None</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>repr(x)</code></td>
<td><code>x.__repr__()</code></td>
<td><code>str</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>x == y</code></td>
<td><code>x.__eq__(y)</code></td>
<td>Typically <code>bool</code></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>The <a href="https://www.pythonmorsels.com/what-is-init/" target="_blank"><code>__init__</code></a> method is the <strong>initializer</strong> (not to be confused with the <a href="#construction-and-finalizing" target="_blank">constructor</a>), the <a href="https://www.pythonmorsels.com/customizing-string-representation-your-objects/" target="_blank"><code>__repr__</code></a> method customizes an object's string representation, and the <a href="https://www.pythonmorsels.com/overloading-equality-in-python/" target="_blank"><code>__eq__</code></a> method customizes what it means for objects to be <em>equal</em> to one another.</p>
<p>The <code>__repr__</code> method is particularly helpful at the <a href="https://www.pythonmorsels.com/using-the-python-repl/" target="_blank">the Python REPL</a> and when debugging.</p>
<h2 id="equality-and-hashability">Equality and hashability üü∞</h2>
<p>In addition to the <code>__eq__</code> method, Python has 2 other dunder methods for determining the "value" of an object in relation to other objects.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Operation</th>
<th>Dunder Method Call</th>
<th>Returns</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><code>x == y</code></td>
<td><code>x.__eq__(y)</code></td>
<td>Typically <code>bool</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>x != y</code></td>
<td><code>x.__ne__(y)</code></td>
<td>Typically <code>bool</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>hash(x)</code></td>
<td><code>x.__hash__()</code></td>
<td><code>int</code></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Python's <code>__eq__</code> method typically returns <code>True</code>, <code>False</code>, or <a href="https://www.pythonmorsels.com/when-to-use-notimplemented/" target="_blank"><code>NotImplemented</code></a> (if objects can't be compared).
The default <code>__eq__</code> implementation relies on the <code>is</code> operator, which checks for <strong><a href="https://www.pythonmorsels.com/equality-vs-identity/" target="_blank">identity</a></strong>.</p>
<p>The default implementation of <code>__ne__</code> calls <code>__eq__</code> and negates any boolean return value given (or returns <code>NotImplemented</code> if <code>__eq__</code> did).
This default behavior is usually "good enough", so <strong>you'll almost never see <code>__ne__</code> implemented</strong>.</p>
<p>Hashable objects can be used as keys in dictionaries or values in sets.
All objects in Python are <a href="https://www.pythonmorsels.com/what-are-hashable-objects/" target="_blank">hashable</a> by default, but if you've written a custom <code>__eq__</code> method then your objects <em>won't</em> be hashable without a custom <code>__hash__</code> method.
But <strong>the hash value of an object must never change</strong> or <a href="https://pym.dev/p/2ysgz/" target="_blank">bad things will happen</a> so <strong>typically only <em>immutable</em> objects implement <code>__hash__</code></strong>.</p>
<p>For implementing equality checks, see <a href="https://www.pythonmorsels.com/overloading-equality-in-python/" target="_blank"><code>__eq__</code> in Python</a>.
For implementing hashability, see <a href="https://www.pythonmorsels.com/making-hashable-objects/" target="_blank">making hashable objects in Python</a>.</p>
<h2 id="orderability">Orderability ‚öñÔ∏è</h2>
<p>Python's comparison operators (<code>&lt;</code>, <code>&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;=</code>, <code>&gt;=</code>) can all be overloaded with dunder methods as well.
The comparison operators also power functions that rely on the relative ordering of objects, like <code>sorted</code>, <code>min</code>, and <code>max</code>.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Operation</th>
<th>Dunder Method Call</th>
<th>Returns</th>

<tbody>

<td><code>__le__</code></td>
<td>Typically <code>bool</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>&gt;=</code></td>
<td><code>__ge__</code></td>
<td>Typically <code>bool</code></td>

</tbody>
</table>
<p>If you plan to implement all of these operators in the <em>typical</em> way (where <code>x &lt; y</code> would be the same as asking <code>y &gt; x</code>) then the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functools.html#functools.total_ordering" target="_blank"><code>total_ordering</code> decorator</a> from Python's <code>functools</code> module will come in handy.</p>
<h2 id="type-conversions-and-string-formatting">Type conversions and string formatting ‚öóÔ∏è</h2>
<p>Python has a number of dunder methods for converting objects to a different type.</p>
<table>
<thead>

<tr>
<td><code>str(x)</code></td>

</tbody>
</table>
<p>The <code>__bool__</code> function is used for <a href="https://www.pythonmorsels.com/truthiness/" target="_blank">truthiness</a> checks, though <code>__len__</code> is used as a fallback.</p>
<p>If you needed to make an object that acts like a number (like <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/decimal.html" target="_blank"><code>decimal.Decimal</code></a> or <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/fractions.html" target="_blank"><code>fractions.Fraction</code></a>), you'll want to implement <code>__int__</code>, <code>__float__</code>, and <code>__complex__</code> so your objects can be converted to other numbers.
If you wanted to make an object that could be used in a <code>memoryview</code> or could otherwise be converted to <code>bytes</code>, you'll want a <code>__bytes__</code> method.</p>
<p>The <code>__format__</code> and <code>__repr__</code> methods are different string conversion flavors.
Most string conversions rely the <code>__str__</code> method, but the default <code>__str__</code> implementation simply calls <code>__repr__</code>.</p>
<p>The <code>__format__</code> method is used by all <a href="https://www.pythonmorsels.com/string-formatting/" target="_blank">f-string conversions</a>, by the <code>str</code> class's <code>format</code> method, and by the (rarely used) built-in <code>format</code> function.
This method allows <code>datetime</code> objects to <a href="https://www.pythonmorsels.com/string-formatting/#formatting-datetime-objects" target="_blank">support custom format specifiers</a>.</p>
<h2 id="context-managers">Context managers üö™</h2>

<p>The <code>__iter__</code> method is used by the <code>iter</code> function <em>and</em> for all forms of iteration: <a href="https://www.pythonmorsels.com/writing-a-for-loop/" target="_blank"><code>for</code> loops</a>, <a href="https://www.pythonmorsels.com/what-are-list-comprehensions/" target="_blank">comprehensions</a>, <a href="https://www.pythonmorsels.com/tuple-unpacking/" target="_blank">tuple unpacking</a>, and <a href="https://www.pythonmorsels.com/unpacking-iterables-iterables/" target="_blank">using <code>*</code> for iterable unpacking</a>.</p>
<p>While the <code>__iter__</code> method is necessary for creating a custom iterable, the <code>__next__</code> method is necessary for creating a custom iterator (which is much less common).
The <code>__missing__</code> method is only ever called by the <code>dict</code> class on itself, unless another class decides to implement <code>__missing__</code>.
The <code>__length_hint__</code> method supplies a length guess for structures which do not support <code>__len__</code> so that lists or other structures can be pre-sized more efficiently.</p>
<p>Also see: <a href="https://www.pythonmorsels.com/iterator-protocol/" target="_blank">the iterator protocol</a>, <a href="https://www.pythonmorsels.com/making-the-len-function-work-on-your-python-objects/" target="_blank">implementing <code>__len__</code></a>, and <a href="https://www.pythonmorsels.com/supporting-index-and-key-lookups/" target="_blank">implementing <code>__getitem__</code></a>.</p>
<h2 id="callability">Callability ‚òéÔ∏è</h2>
<p>Functions, classes, and all other <a href="https://www.pythonmorsels.com/callables/" target="_blank">callable objects</a> rely on the <code>__call__</code> method.</p>

<p>When a class is called, its <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-metaclass" target="_blank">metaclass</a>'s <code>__call__</code> method is used.
When a class <em>instance</em> is called, the class's <code>__call__</code> method is used.</p>

<h2 id="arithmetic-operators">Arithmetic operators ‚ûó</h2>
<p>Python's dunder methods are often described as a tool for "operator overloading".
Most of this "operator overloading" comes in the form of Python's various arithmetic operators.</p>
<p>There are two ways to break down the arithmetic operators:</p>

<p>The unary <code>+</code> operator typically <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16819023/whats-the-purpose-of-the-pos-unary-operator-in-python" target="_blank">has no effect</a>, though some objects use it for a specific operation.
For example <a href="https://www.pythonmorsels.com/using-counter/#removing-negative-counts" target="_blank">using <code>+</code> on <code>collections.Counter</code> objects</a> will remove non-positive values.</p>
<p>Python's arithmetic operators are often used for non-arithmetic ends: <a href="https://www.pythonmorsels.com/sequence/" target="_blank">sequences</a> use <code>+</code> to concatenate and <code>*</code> to self-concatenate and <a href="https://www.pythonmorsels.com/practical-uses-of-sets/" target="_blank">sets</a> use <code>&amp;</code> for intersection, <code>|</code> for union, <code>-</code> for asymmetric difference, and <code>^</code> for symmetric difference.
Arithmetic operators are sometimes overloaded for more creative uses too.
For example, <code>pathlib.Path</code> objects <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html#operators" target="_blank">use <code>/</code> to create child paths</a>.</p>
<h2 id="in-place-arithmetic-operations">In-place arithmetic operations ‚ôªÔ∏è</h2>
<p>Python includes many dunder methods for <strong>in-place</strong> operations.

<p>All of Python's binary arithmetic operators work in <strong>augmented assignment statements</strong>, which involve using an operator followed by the <code>=</code> sign to assign to an object while performing an operation on it.</p>
<p>Augmented assignments on <strong>mutable objects</strong> are <a href="https://www.pythonmorsels.com/augmented-assignments-mutate/" target="_blank">expected to mutate the original object</a>, thanks to the mutable object implementing the appropriate dunder method for in-place arithmetic.</p>
<p>When no dunder method is found for an in-place operation, Python performs the operation followed by an assignment.
<strong>Immutable objects typically do <em>not</em> implement dunder methods for in-place operations</strong>, since they should return a new object instead of changing the original.</p>
<h2 id="built-in-math-functions">Built-in math functions üßÆ</h2>
<p>Python also includes dunder methods for many math-related functions, both <a href="https://www.pythonmorsels.com/built-in-functions-in-python/#type" target="_blank">built-in functions</a> and some functions in the <code>math</code> library.</p>

<p>Python's <code>divmod</code> function performs <a href="https://www.pythonmorsels.com/integer-division/" target="_blank">integer division</a> (<code>//</code>) and a modulo operation (<code>%</code>) at the same time.
Note that, just like the many binary arithmetic operators, <code>divmod</code> will also check for an <code>__rvidmod__</code> method if it needs to ask the <em>second</em> argument to handle the operation.</p>
<p>The <code>__index__</code> method is for making integer-like objects.
This method losslessly converts to an integer, unlike <code>__int__</code> which may perform a "lossy" integer conversion (e.g. from <code>float</code> to <code>int</code>).
It's used by operations that require <em>true</em> integers, such as <a href="https://www.pythonmorsels.com/slicing/" target="_blank">slicing</a>, indexing, and <code>bin</code>, <code>hex</code>, and <code>oct</code> functions (<a href="https://pym.dev/p/2k9zt/" target="_blank">example</a>).</p>

<p>The <code>__getattribute__</code> method is called for <em>every</em> attribute access, while the <code>__getattr__</code> method is only called after Python <em>fails</em> to find a given attribute.
All method calls and attribute accesses call <code>__getattribute__</code> so implementing it correctly is challenging (due to accidental <a href="https://www.pythonmorsels.com/what-is-recursion/" target="_blank">recursion</a>).</p>
<p>The <code>__dir__</code> method should return an iterable of attribute names (as strings).
When <a href="https://www.pythonmorsels.com/built-in-functions-in-python/#dir" target="_blank">the <code>dir</code> function</a> calls <code>__dir__</code>, it converts the returned iterable into a sorted list (like <a href="https://www.pythonmorsels.com/sorting-in-python/" target="_blank"><code>sorted</code></a> does).</p>
<p>The built-in <code>getattr</code>, <a href="https://www.pythonmorsels.com/python-setattr/" target="_blank"><code>setattr</code></a>, and <code>delattr</code> functions correspond to the dunder methods of the same name, but they're only intended for dynamic attribute access (not <em>all</em> attribute accesses).</p>

<p>Now we're getting into the really unusual dunder methods.
Python includes many dunder methods for metaprogramming-related features.</p>

<p>The <code>__prepare__</code> method customizes the dictionary that's used for a class's initial namespace.
This is used to pre-populate dictionary values or customize the dictionary type (<a href="https://pym.dev/p/23wfv/" target="_blank">silly example</a>).</p>
<p>The <code>__instancecheck__</code> and <code>__subclasscheck__</code> methods override the functionality of <code>isinstance</code> and <code>issubclass</code>.
Python's ABCs use these to practice <a href="https://www.pythonmorsels.com/goose-typing/" target="_blank">goose typing</a> (<a href="https://www.pythonmorsels.com/duck-typing/" target="_blank">duck typing</a> <em>while</em> type checking).</p>
<p>The <code>__init_subclass__</code> method allows classes to hook into subclass initialization (<a href="https://pym.dev/p/246z6/" target="_blank">example</a>).
Classes <em>also</em> have a <code>__subclasses__</code> method (on their <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-metaclass" target="_blank">metaclass</a>) but it's not typically overridden.</p>
<p>Python calls <code>__mro_entries__</code> during <a href="https://www.pythonmorsels.com/inheriting-one-class-another/" target="_blank">class inheritance</a> for any base classes that are not <em>actually</em> classes.
The <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.NamedTuple" target="_blank"><code>typing.NamedTuple</code></a> function uses this to pretend it's a class (<a href="https://pym.dev/p/2qgzd/" target="_blank">see here</a>).</p>
<p>The <code>__class_getitem__</code> method allows a class to be subscriptable (<em>without</em> its metaclass needing a <code>__getitem__</code> method).
This is typically used for enabling fancy type annotations (e.g. <code>list[int]</code>).</p>
<h2 id="descriptors">Descriptors üè∑Ô∏è</h2>
<p><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-descriptor" target="_blank">Descriptors</a> are objects that, when attached to a class, can hook into the access of the attribute name they're attached to on that class.</p>

<h2 id="asynchronous-operations">Asynchronous operations ü§π</h2>
<p>Want to implement an asynchronous context manager?
You need these dunder methods:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>__aenter__</code>: just like <code>__enter__</code>, but it returns an awaitable object</li>
<li><code>__aexit__</code>: just like <code>__exit__</code>, but it returns an awaitable object</li>
</ul>
<p>Need to support asynchronous iteration?
You need these dunder methods:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>__aiter__</code>: must return an asynchronous iterator</li>
<li><code>__anext__</code>: like <code>__next__</code> or non-async iterators, but this must return an awaitable object and this should raise <code>StopAsyncIteration</code> instead of <code>StopIteration</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Need to make your own awaitable object?
You need this dunder method:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>__await__</code>: returns an iterator</li>
</ul>
<p>I have little experience with custom asynchronous objects, so look elsewhere for more details.</p>

<p>Calling a class returns a new class instance thanks to the <code>__new__</code> method.
The <code>__new__</code> method is Python's <strong>constructor method</strong>, though unlike constructors in many programming languages, you should almost <em>never</em> define your own <code>__new__</code> method.
To control object creation, prefer the initializer (<code>__init__</code>), not the constructor (<code>__new__</code>).
<a href="https://pym.dev/p/28r9m/" target="_blank">Here's an odd <code>__new__</code> example</a>.</p>
<p>You could think of <code>__del__</code> as a "destructor" method, though it's actually called the <strong>finalizer method</strong>.
Just before an object is deleted, its <code>__del__</code> method is called (<a href="https://pym.dev/p/2hexg/" target="_blank">example</a>).
Files implement a <code>__del__</code> method that closes the file and any binary file buffer that it may be linked to.</p>
<h2 id="library-specific-dunder-methods">Library-specific dunder methods üß∞</h2>
<p>Some standard library modules define custom dunder methods that aren't used anywhere else:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.pythonmorsels.com/dataclasses/" target="_blank">dataclasses</a> support a <code>__post_init__</code> method</li>
<li><code>abc.ABC</code> classes have a <code>__subclasshook__</code> method which <code>abc.ABCMeta</code> calls in its <code>__subclasscheck__</code> method (more in <a href="https://www.pythonmorsels.com/goose-typing/" target="_blank">goose typing</a>)</li>
<li>Path-like objects have a <code>__fspath__</code> method, which returns the file path as a string</li>
<li>Python's <code>copy</code> module will use the <code>__copy__</code> and <code>__deepcopy__</code> methods if present</li>
<li>Pickling relies on <code>__getnewargs_ex__</code> or <code>__getargs__</code>, though <code>__getstate__</code> and <code>__setstate__</code> can customize further and <code>__reduce__</code> or <code>__reduce_ex__</code> are even lower-level</li>
<li><code>sys.getsizeof</code> relies on the <code>__sizeof__</code> method to get an object's size (in bytes)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="dunder-attributes">Dunder attributes üìá</h2>
<p>In addition to dunder methods, Python has many non-method <strong>dunder attributes</strong>.</p>
<p>Here are some of the more common dunder attributes you'll see:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>__name__</code>: name of a function, classes, or module</li>
<li><code>__module__</code>: module name for a function or class</li>
<li><code>__doc__</code>: <a href="https://www.pythonmorsels.com/docstrings/" target="_blank">docstring</a> for a function, class, or module</li>
<li><code>__class__</code>: an object's class (call <a href="https://www.pythonmorsels.com/built-in-functions-in-python/#type" target="_blank">Python's <code>type</code> function</a> instead)</li>
<li><code>__dict__</code>: most objects store their attributes here (see <a href="https://www.pythonmorsels.com/where-are-attributes-stored/" target="_blank">where are attributes stored?</a>)</li>
<li><code>__slots__</code>: classes using this are more memory efficient than classes using <code>__dict__</code></li>
<li><code>__match_args__</code>: classes can define a tuple noting the significance of positional attributes when the class is used in structural pattern matching (<code>match</code>-<code>case</code>)</li>
<li><code>__mro__</code>: a class's method resolution order used when for attribute lookups and <code>super()</code> calls</li>
<li><code>__bases__</code>: the direct parent classes of a class</li>
<li><code>__file__</code>: the file that defined the module object (though not always present!)</li>
<li><code>__wrapped__</code>: functions decorated with <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functools.html#functools.wraps" target="_blank"><code>functools.wraps</code></a> use this to point to the original function</li>
<li><code>__version__</code>: commonly used for noting the version of a package</li>
<li><code>__all__</code>: modules can use this to customize the behavior of <code>from my_module import *</code></li>
<li><code>__debug__</code>: running Python with <code>-O</code> sets this to <code>False</code> and disables Python's <code>assert</code> statements</li>
</ul>
<p>Those are only the more commonly seen dunder attributes.
Here are some more:</p>
<ul>
<li>Functions have <code>__defaults__</code>, <code>__kwdefaults__</code>, <code>__code__</code>, <code>__globals__</code>, and <code>__closure__</code></li>
<li>Both functions and classes have <code>__qualname__</code>, <code>__annotations__</code>, and <code>__type_params__</code></li>
<li>Instance methods have <code>__func__</code> and <code>__self__</code></li>
<li>Modules may also have <code>__loader__</code>, <code>__package__</code>, <code>__spec__</code>, and <code>__cached__</code> attributes</li>
<li>Packages have a <code>__path__</code> attribute</li>
<li>Exceptions have <code>__traceback__</code>, <code>__notes__</code>, <code>__context__</code>, <code>__cause__</code>, and <code>__suppress_context__</code></li>
<li>Descriptors use <code>__objclass__</code></li>
<li>Metaclasses use <code>__classcell__</code></li>
<li>Python's <code>weakref</code> module uses <code>__weakref__</code></li>
<li><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#type-annotation-types-generic-alias-union" target="_blank">Generic aliases</a> have <code>__origin__</code>, <code>__args__</code>, <code>__parameters__</code>, and <code>__unpacked__</code></li>
<li>The <code>sys</code> module has <code>__stdout__</code> and <code>__stderr__</code> which point to the original <code>stdout</code> and <code>stderr</code> versions</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, these dunder attributes are used by various standard library modules: <code>__covariant__</code>, <code>__contravariant__</code>, <code>__infer_variance__</code>, <code>__bound__</code>, <code>__constraints__</code>.
And Python includes a built-in <code>__import__</code> function which you're not supposed to use (<code>importlib.import_module</code> is preferred) and CPython has a <code>__builtins__</code> variable that points to the <code>builtins</code> module (but this is an implementation detail and <code>builtins</code> should be explicitly imported when needed instead).
Also importing from the <code>__future__</code> module can enable specific Python feature flags and Python will look for a <code>__main__</code> module within packages to make them runnable as CLI scripts.</p>
<p>And that's just <em>most</em> of the dunder attribute names you'll find floating around in Python. üòµ</p>

<p>The above table has a slight but consistent <em>untruth</em>.
Most of these dunder methods are not <em>actually</em> called on an object directly but are instead called on the <em>type</em> of that object: <code>type(x).__add__(x, y)</code> instead of <code>x.__add__(y)</code>.
This distinction mostly matters with metaclass methods.</p>
<p>I've also purposely excluded library-specific dunder methods (like <code>__post_init__</code>) and dunder methods you're unlikely to ever define (like <code>__subclasses__</code>).
See those below.</p>

<p>So, Python includes 103 "normal" dunder methods, 12 library-specific dunder methods, and at least 52 other dunder attributes of various types.
That's over 150 unique <code>__dunder__</code> names!
I <strong>do not recommend</strong> memorizing these: let Python do its job and look up the dunder method or attribute that you need to implement/find whenever you need it.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that <strong>you're not meant to invent your own dunder methods</strong>.
Sometimes you'll see third-party libraries that <em>do</em> invent their own dunder method, but this isn't encouraged and it can be quite confusing for users who run across such methods and assume they're "<em>real</em>" dunder methods.</p>

    <a href="https://redict.io/posts/2024-04-03-redict-7.3.0-released/">Redict 7.3.0 is now available</a>
    <br><small>Drew DeVault</small>
  </h2>
  
  <h5>April 3, 2024</h5>



  

  



<p>The Redict community is pleased to announce the release of Redict 7.3.0, the
first stable version of our copyleft fork of Redis¬Æ OSS 7.2.4.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> You can
download the release <a href="https://codeberg.org/redict/redict/releases/tag/7.3.0">on Codeberg</a>, or download one of our official
<a href="https://redict.io/docs/install/containers/">container images</a> from registry.redict.io.</p>
<p>We have written comprehensive documentation detailing our <a href="https://redict.io/docs/redis-compat/">compatibility with
Redis¬Æ OSS 7.2.4</a>, which also provides detailed documentation for
various migration scenarios, such as for users of the official Redis¬Æ
containers on Docker Hub, downstream package maintainers, and so on.</p>
<p>We have tested Redict thoroughly with a variety of migration scenarios, but we
may have missed a detail that pertains to your use-case. If you have any issues
or questions with respect to the migration process, please <a href="https://redict.io/docs/community">join our community
spaces</a> to get help.</p>
<h2 id="why-redict">
  Why Redict?
  <a href="#why-redict">#</a>
</h2>
<p>You may be wondering why Redict would be of interest to you, particularly when
compared with <a href="https://www.linuxfoundation.org/press/linux-foundation-launches-open-source-valkey-community">Valkey</a>, another Redis¬Æ fork that was announced on Thursday.</p>
<p>In technical terms, we are focusing on stability and long-term maintenance, and
on achieving excellence within our current scope. We believe that Redict is near
feature-complete and that it is more valuable to our users if we take a
conservative stance to innovation and focus on long-term reliability instead.
This is in part a choice we‚Äôve made to distinguish ourselves from Valkey, whose
commercial interests are able to invest more resources into developing more
radical innovations, but also an acknowledgement of a cultural difference
between our projects, in that the folks behind Redict place greater emphasis on
software with a finite scope and ambitions towards long-term stability
rather than focusing on long-term growth in scope and complexity.</p>
<p>We will happily pull useful changes from software with permissive licenses, such
as Valkey, to improve Redict; such is the value of permissive software and the
key advantage of free software generally. However, we will do so at a more
conservative pace, so that our users can enjoy stability first and shiny new
features second. We are also going to focus on establishing and maintaining a
good relationship with downstream distributions, prioritizing their needs with
respect to tasks such as de-vendoring Lua and jemalloc.</p>
<p>Redict also has social and political aims which differ from other forks. In
short, we believe in an approach which is built from an independent, grassroots,
and community-focused means of building our software. We are not governed by the
consensus of a small group of commercial interests, but rather by an independent
and community-driven consensus. Importantly, we have also chosen to protect our
software from further exploitation by applying the Lesser GNU General Public
License (LGPL) to our work.</p>
<p>Our choice of license prevents the hard work of our contributors from being
incorporated into the now-proprietary Redis¬Æ software, and from any future
attempts to create proprietary distributions of Redict. However, our choice of
the LGPL balances this concern with the needs of commercial users&nbsp;‚Äì we
have selected this license in part to ensure that cloud providers can continue
to offer Redict to their customers without being subject to onerous compliance
regimes.</p>
<blockquote>
  <strong>Note</strong>: Check out our <a href="https://redict.io/docs/license">About the license</a> page for more
information about the license of Redict.
</blockquote>

<p>We‚Äôve made these choices because we believe they are essential in providing for
a future which is based on free software, and in which the rug cannot be pulled
out from under our users and contributors again. We believe it is essential to
make these choices now, at the onset of our fork, especially in response to the
crisis that the Redis¬Æ community is faced with at the hands of its
commercial stewards. If you don‚Äôt want your investment in this software to risk
another artificial crisis in the name of profit, if you want to enjoy the
protection of copyleft and a guarantee that your software will remain free, then
we encourage you to adopt Redict for your needs.</p>
<p>We have also taken this opportunity to re-evaluate our infrastructure and double
down on using free software. Rather than continuing to use the proprietary
GitHub forge, we have elected to use the non-profit, free software
<a href="https://codeberg.org/">Codeberg</a> as our home, and we run our continuous
integration on <a href="https://sourcehut.org/">SourceHut</a>, which is also free software.
Moreover, rather than gathering on Discord, we have chosen instead to set up our
community on <a href="https://redict.io/docs/community">Matrix and IRC</a>. We believe that the Redis¬Æ license
change provides us an opportunity to focus on our values as members of the free
software community, to exercise solidarity, and to lend our strength to
re-enforce the broader free software ecosystem. As such, we felt it important to
choose free software solutions for our infrastructure needs.</p>
<h2 id="acknowledgements">
  Acknowledgements
  <a href="#acknowledgements">#</a>
</h2>
<p>I‚Äôd like to extend a personal ‚Äúthanks‚Äù to everyone who was involved in bringing
this fork to life. In particular, Micke Nordin and Hugo, for their work on the
Redict containers; Lucas Dohmen, for his extensive work on the documentation and
website; and Anna, for her work forking and maintaining <a href="https://codeberg.org/redict/hiredict">hiredict</a>; as well as
everyone who contributed small patches here and there, and everyone who helped
with the rapid turn-around and testing of Redict‚Äôs release candidates. Shoutout
to @janWilejan for designing our logo, and to everyone else who submitted their
artwork for consideration.</p>
<p>Thanks are also due, of course, to all of the many contributors who worked on
Redis¬Æ OSS, commercial contributors and independent contributors alike,
whose work forms the foundation of our codebase, as well as all of those who
worked on the extensive Creative Commons documentation that was adapted for
Redict. We also extend our gratitude to the community downstream of Redis¬Æ
OSS, including downstream distributions, cloud services, and countless users,
all of whom nourished its growth as free software.</p>
<h2 id="whats-next">
  What‚Äôs next?
  <a href="#whats-next">#</a>
</h2>
<p>We focused on a very conservative set of changes for the initial release, to
maximize backwards compatibility and ease the transition for new users. Going
forward, we do have some plans to make conservative improvements.</p>
<p>Among the planned changes are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Modernizing the build system (<a href="https://muon.build/">muon</a> is the leading
candidate)</li>
<li>Forking the <em>ecosystem</em>, in particular Redis¬Æ client libraries (this is a
great way for you to help!)</li>
<li>De-vendoring dependencies such as Lua and jemalloc</li>
</ul>
<p>Lucas is also planning to invest heavily in Redict‚Äôs documentation, such that we
become the reference of choice for all participants in this ecosystem. Anna has
some changes planned for <a href="https://codeberg.org/redict/hiredict">hiredict</a> as well (our fork of the official Redis¬Æ
C client library), including build system improvements and better conformance
with Unix norms.</p>
<p>We will also be happy to consider improvements from any community member ‚Äì come
join us! We will welcome you as equals ‚Äì independent and commercial users
alike!</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article class="page">







<section id="pagebody" role="main">
<p>Was the ssh backdoor the only goal that "Jia Tan" was pursuing
with their multi-year operation against xz?</p>

<p>I doubt it, and if not, then every fix so far has been incomplete,
because everything is still running code written by that entity.</p>

<p>If we assume that they had a multilayered plan, that their every action was
calculated and malicious, then we have to think about the full threat
surface of using xz. This quickly gets into nightmare scenarios of the
"trusting trust" variety.</p>

<p>What if xz contains a hidden buffer overflow or other vulnerability, that
can be exploited by the xz file it's decompressing? This would let the
attacker target other packages, as needed.</p>

<p>Let's say they want to target gcc. Well, gcc contains a lot of
documentation, which includes png images. So they spend a while getting
accepted as a documentation contributor on that project, and get added to
it a png file that is specially constructed, it has additional binary data
appended that exploits the buffer overflow. And instructs xz to modify the
source code that comes later when decompressing <code>gcc.tar.xz</code>.</p>

<p>More likely, they wouldn't bother with an actual trusting trust attack on
gcc, which would be a lot of work to get right. One problem with the ssh
backdoor is that well, not all servers on the internet run ssh. (Or
systemd.) So webservers seem a likely target of this kind of second stage
attack. Apache's docs include png files, nginx does not, but there's always
scope to add improved documentation to a project.</p>

<p>When would such a vulnerability have been introduced? In February, "Jia
Tan" wrote a <a href="https://git.tukaani.org/?p=xz.git;a=commitdiff;h=de5c5e417645ad8906ef914bc059d08c1462fc29">new decoder for xz</a>.
This added 1000+ lines of new C code across several commits. So much code
and in just the right place to insert something like this. And why take on
such a significant project just two months before inserting the ssh
backdoor? "Jia Tan" was already fully accepted as maintainer, and doing
lots of other work, it doesn't seem to me that they needed to start this
rewrite as part of their cover.</p>

<p>They were working closely with xz's author Lasse Collin in this, by
indications exchanging patches offlist as they developed it. So Lasse
Collin's commits in this time period are also worth scrutiny, because
they could have been influenced by "Jia Tan". One that
caught my eye comes immediately afterwards:
<a href="https://git.tukaani.org/?p=xz.git;a=commitdiff;h=e0c0ee475c0800c08291ae45e0d66aa00d5ce604">"prepares the code for alternative C versions and inline assembly"</a>
Multiple versions and assembly mean even more places to hide such a
security hole.</p>

<p>I stress that I have not found such a security hole, I'm only considering
what the worst case possibilities are. I think we need to fully consider
them in order to decide how to fully wrap up this mess.</p>

<p>Whether such stealthy security holes have been introduced into xz by "Jia
Tan" or not, there are definitely indications that the ssh backdoor was not
the end of what they had planned.</p>

<p>For one thing, the "test file" based system they introduced
<a href="https://openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/03/30/15">was extensible</a>.
They could have been planning to add more test files later, that backdoored
xz in further ways.</p>

<p>And then there's the matter of the disabling of the Landlock sandbox. This
was not necessary for the ssh backdoor, because the sandbox is only used by
the <code>xz</code> command, not by liblzma. So why did they potentially tip their
hand by adding that rogue "." that disables the sandbox?</p>

<p>A sandbox would not prevent the kind of attack I discuss above, where xz is
just modifying code that it decompresses. Disabling the sandbox suggests
that they were going to make xz run arbitrary code, that perhaps wrote to
files it shouldn't be touching, to install a backdoor in the system.</p>

<p>Both deb and rpm use xz compression, and with the sandbox disabled,
whether they link with liblzma or run the <code>xz</code> command, a backdoored xz can
write to any file on the system while dpkg or rpm is running and noone is
likely to notice, because that's the kind of thing a package manager does.</p>

<p>My impression is that all of this was well planned and they were in it for
the long haul. They had no reason to stop with backdooring ssh, except for
the risk of additional exposure. But they decided to take that risk, with
the sandbox disabling. So they planned to do more, and every commit
by "Jia Tan", and really every commit that they could have influenced
needs to be distrusted.</p>

<p>This is why I've suggested to Debian that they
<a href="https://bugs.debian.org/1068024">revert to an earlier version of xz</a>.
That would be my advice to anyone distributing xz.</p>

<p>I do have a <a href="https://git.joeyh.name/index.cgi/xz-unscathed/">xz-unscathed</a>
fork which I've carefully constructed to avoid all "Jia Tan" involved
commits. It feels good to not need to worry about <code>dpkg</code> and <code>tar</code>.
I only plan to maintain this fork minimally, eg security fixes.
Hopefully Lasse Collin will consider these possibilities and address
them in his response to the attack.</p>

<p>The French news service contexte.com has today published the latest Belgian Presidency‚Äôs proposal for introducing indiscriminate <a href="https://www.patrick-breyer.de/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/2024-03-28-conseil-csam-compromis-presidence-belge.pdf">chat control scanning of private messages for illegal content. </a>The proposal covers the entire regulation and is therefore ready for endorsement. The proposal is to be discussed tomorrow in a Council law enforcement working party. The <a href="https://netzpolitik.org/2024/internes-protokoll-eu-staaten-weiter-uneins-ueber-chatkontrolle/">political points of contention will then be decided in COREPER</a> in order to adopt the position by June.</p>



<p>The leaked proposal shows that the core of the EU Commission‚Äôs extreme initial proposal is to be retained unchanged, warns MEP and most prominent opponent of chat control Patrick Breyer (Pirate Party):</p>



<p>‚ÄúAs the Council‚Äôs legal service has confirmed, the latest move does not change the nature of detection orders. Millions of private chats and private photos of law-abiding citizens are to be searched and leaked using flawed technology, without them being even remotely connected to child sexual abuse ‚Äì this destroys our digital privacy of correspondence. Despite lip service being paid to encryption, client-side scanning is to be used to undermine previously secure end-to-end encryption in order to turn our smartphones into spies ‚Äì this destroys secure encryption.</p>



<p>Now is the time to take to the barricades in favour of privacy and secure encryption, because EU governments that have been critical so far are praising the repackaged plans, which means that the blocking minority no longer stands. Not even a written opinion of the Council‚Äôs legal service on this obvious violation of fundamental rights has been requested, it seems.</p>



<p>If the EU governments actually go into trilogue negotiations with this radical position, experience shows that the Parliament risks gradually abandoning its initial position behind closed doors and agreeing to bad and dangerous compromises that fundamentally put our online security at risk.‚Äù</p>



<p>In detail Breyer criticises the proposed text as follows: ‚ÄûLimiting bulk chat searches to ‚Äòhigh-risk services‚Äô is meaningless because every communication service is misused also for sharing illegal images and therefore has an imminently high risk of abuse. Ireland ‚Äì one of the strongest proponents of chat control ‚Äì would be classifying the major services. In any case, the service used is no justification for searching the private chats of millions of citizens who are not even remotely connected to any wrongdoing.</p>



<p>Informing law enforcement only of repeat hits is also meaningless, as falsely flagged beach pictures or consensual sexting rarely involve just a single photo. The EU Commissioner for Home Affairs has herself herself stated that three out of four of the disclosed chats and photos are not actionable for the police. These algorithms and hash databases are totally unreliable in distinguishing legal from illegal content.‚Äù</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="featured">
                         <p>
            April 1st, 2024</p><!-- .entry-meta -->
        <p>We take stacks and heaps for granted nowadays, but back in the very old days of computing, computers operated without a stack or a heap.</p>
<p>Tell a recent college graduate this, and you may as well tell them that there was a time when you didn‚Äôt have instant access to millions of cat videos.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs not too hard to imagine computing without dynamic memory allocation. You just have to use fixed-size memory buffers for everything. If you have to operate on variable-sized data, you reserved a fixed-size buffer of some capacity that is large enough to accommodate any data you would reasonably be expected to process, and if somebody asked for more, you just exited the program with a fatal error. If you were really nice, you would provide a compile-time configuration so your clients could adjust the maximum capacity to suit their datasets. And if you were really fancy, you wrote a custom allocator that operated on that fixed-size buffer so people could ‚Äúallocate‚Äù and ‚Äúfree‚Äù memory from the buffer.</p>
<p>But operating without a stack? How did you call a function if you didn‚Äôt have a stack for the return address or local variables?</p>
<p>Here‚Äôs how it worked.</p>
<p>First, the compiler defined a secret global variable for each inbound function parameter, plus another secret global variable for each function to hold the return address. It also defined a secret global variable for each of the function‚Äôs local variables.</p>
<p>To generate a function call, the compiler assigned the parameter values to the corresponding secret global variables, assigned the return address to the function‚Äôs secret ‚Äúreturn address variable‚Äù, and then jumped to the start of the function.</p>
<p>The function read its parameters from its secret global variables, and used the pre-defined secret global variables that corresponded to its logically local variables. When the function was finished, it jumped to the address held in the function‚Äôs secret ‚Äúreturn address variable.‚Äù</p>
<p>For example, suppose you had code like this, written in a C-like language:</p>
<pre>int add_two_values(int a, int b)
{
    int c = a + b;
    return c;
}

void sample()
{
    int x = add_two_values(31415, 2718);
}
</pre>
<p>This would be transformed by the compiler into something like this:</p>
<pre>int a2v_a;
int a2v_b;
int a2v_c;
void* a2v_retaddr;

int add_two_values()
{
    a2v_c = a2v_a + a2v_b;

    return_value_register = a2v_c;
    goto a2v_retaddr;
}

int sample_x;
void sample()
{
    a2v_a = 31415;
    a2v_b = 2718;
    a2v_retaddr = &amp;resume;
    goto add_two_values;
resume:
    sample_x = return_value_register;
}
</pre>
<p>Check it out: We did a function call and return without a stack!</p>
<p>Now, you can optimize the ABI by, say, passing some of these values in registers rather than globals. For example, most processors had a special ‚Äúlink‚Äù register and a special instruction ‚Äúbranch with link‚Äù that automatically set the link register equal to the address of the instruction after the ‚Äúbranch with link‚Äù instruction, And maybe you optimize the calling convention to pass the first two parameters in registers, resulting in this:</p>
<pre>int a2v_a;
int a2v_b;
int a2v_c;
void* a2v_retaddr;

int add_two_values()
{
    a2v_a = argument_register_1;
    a2v_b = argument_register_2;
    a2v_retaddr = link_register;

    a2v_c = a2v_a + a2v_b;

    return_value_register = a2v_c;
    goto a2v_retaddr;
}

int sample_x;
void sample()
{
    argument_register_1 = 31415;
    argument_register_2 = 2718;
    branch_with_link add_two_values;
    sample_x = return_value_register;
}
</pre>
<p>There was just one catch: You can‚Äôt do recursion.</p>
<p>Recursion doesn‚Äôt work because a recursive call would overwrite the return-address variable with the return address of the recursive call, and when the outer call completed, it would jump to the wrong place.</p>
<p>The programming languages of the day solved this problem by simply declaring it illegal: They didn‚Äôt support recursion.¬π</p>
<p><b>Bonus chatter</b>: Some compilers were even sneakier and used self-modifying code: The special return-address variable was really the address field of the jump instruction at the end of the function!</p>
<p>This was occasionally not so much a sneaky trick as a practical necessity: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIX"> The processor might not support indirect jumps either</a>!</p>
<p>After the practical value of subroutines was recognized, quite a few processors added a subroutine call instruction that worked by storing the return address at the first word of the subroutine, and beginning execution at the second word of the subroutine. To return from a subroutine, you execute an indirect jump through the subroutine start label. (As I recall, some processors stored the return address at the word <i>before</i> the first instruction of the subroutine.) Here‚Äôs what it looked like using a made-up assembly language:</p>
<pre>add_two_values:
    nop                     ; return address goes here
    add   r1 = r1, r2       ; actual subroutine begins here
    jmp   @add_two_values   ; indirect jump to return address

sample:
    mov   r1 = 31415        ; first parameter
    mov   r2 = 2718         ; second parameter
    bsr   add_two_values    ; call subroutine
    st    sample_x = r1     ; save return value
</pre>
<p>When the CPU executed the <code>bsr</code> branch-to-subroutine instruction, it stored the return address into the first word of <code>add_two_values</code> (overwriting the sacrificial <code>nop</code>) and began execution at the following instruction, the <code>add r1 = r1, r2</code>.</p>
<p>¬π FORTRAN initially didn‚Äôt even support subroutines! Those were added in 1958. And support in FORTRAN for recursion didn‚Äôt become standard until 1991, and even then, you had to explicitly declare your subroutine as <code>RECURSIVE</code>.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-headline="The Rise and Fall of 3M‚Äôs Floppy Disk" data-elid="2667647674" data-post-url="https://spectrum.ieee.org/3m-floppy" data-authors="Ernie Smith" data-page-title="The Rise and Fall of 3M‚Äôs Floppy Disk - IEEE Spectrum"><p><em>A version of this post </em><a href="https://tedium.co/2023/11/17/3m-floppy-disks-history/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>originally appeared</em></a><em> on</em><a href="https://tedium.co/" target="_blank"><em>Tedium</em></a><em>, Ernie Smith‚Äôs newsletter, which hunts for the end of the long tail. </em></p><p>
	If you ask the average person what the company 3M does, odds are if they have a few gray hairs hanging out on their scalp, they might say that the company makes floppy disks. Now, this was once true, but 
	<a href="https://www.3m.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">if you look on 3M‚Äôs own website</a>, you will see no mention of this legacy‚Äîit‚Äôs a firm that sells abrasive materials, adhesive tapes, filters, films, personal protective equipment, and medical equipment. (Younger people, if they recognize 3M, it‚Äôs probably because of Post-it notes, or more recently its N95 masks)
</p><p>
	Floppies have had a surprisingly long life‚Äîin January 2024, 
	<a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/01/floppy-disk-requirements-finally-axed-from-japan-government-regulations/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Japan announced</a> it will no longer require floppy-disk copies of government submissions. But 3M got out of the data-storage business about 28 years ago, when it transferred its floppy disk manufacturing to a spin-off called Imation. Imation is still around, under the name Glassbridge Enterprises, but with a much smaller profile.
</p><p><img alt="One yellow and one orange Imation 3M 3 \u00bd inch floppy diskettes on a gray background." data-rm-shortcode-id="09f8f834227ac15c2241ffede9966750" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" data-runner-src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/one-yellow-and-one-orange-imation-3m-3-u00bd-inch-floppy-diskettes-on-a-gray-background.jpg?id=51890455&amp;width=980" height="1250" id="d995a" lazy-loadable="true" src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/one-yellow-and-one-orange-imation-3m-3-u00bd-inch-floppy-diskettes-on-a-gray-background.jpg?id=51890455&amp;width=980" width="2000"><small placeholder="Add Photo Caption...">3M‚Äôs spin-off, Imation, continued producing floppy disks after 3M itself left the business. </small><small placeholder="Add Photo Credit..."><a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/">IEEE Spectrum</a></small></p><p>
	Even with that said, those gray-hairs will frequently claim that of the many makers of floppies out there, 3M made the best ones. Given that, I was curious to figure out exactly why 3M became the most memorable brand in data storage during the formative days of computing, and why it abandoned the product.
</p><h2>How 3M Became a Key Innovator in the Production of Magnetic Data Storage</h2><p>
	Now, to be clear, 3M did not invent magnetic storage‚Äîthat was done by Austro-German engineer 
	<a href="https://www.computerhistory.org/storageengine/audio-recorder-uses-low-cost-magnetic-tape/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Fritz Pfleumer</a>, in 1928. He created audio tape, a recording medium that started as broad strips of paper coated with iron-powder granules, and eventually moved to less-fragile cellulose acetate with help from what would become another big name in floppy disks, BASF. At first, the innovation didn‚Äôt spread outside of Germany because of World War II.
</p><p>
	Nor was 3M the first company to popularize magnetic media‚Äî
	<a href="https://tedium.co/2022/08/26/tape-hiss-noise-history/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">that was Ampex</a>, which commercialized the tape recorder in the late 1940s. That was the point when magnetic tape turned into a major innovation in the world of music‚Äîone that, famously, <a href="https://ethw.org/First-Hand:Bing_Crosby_and_the_Recording_Revolution" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Bing Crosby got to first</a> because he gave financial support to Ampex. Incidentally, Ampex‚Äôs later spinoff, Memorex, represented <a href="https://tedium.co/2021/09/03/memorex-tape-history/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Silicon Valley‚Äôs first true startup</a>.
</p><blockquote>‚ÄúOf all the businesses 3M has shed over its 100 years, the two seminal decisions that people point to as most significant involved the sale of 3M‚Äôs Duplicating Products business to Harris Corporation in Atlanta, Georgia, and the spin-off of 3M‚Äôs data-storage and imaging-systems businesses in 1996 creating a new company called Imation in Oakdale, Minnesota...‚Äù</blockquote><p>
	Before World War II, one company did attempt to manufacture a tape recorder in the U.S. based on Pfluemer‚Äôs magnetic-tape invention. That firm, the Brush Development Co., 
	<a href="https://www.radiomuseum.org/dsp_hersteller_detail.cfm?company_id=2092" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">had developed a device called the Soundmirror</a>, produced by a Hungarian inventor named Semi J. Begun, who was likely something of a competitor to Pfleumer: Also a German, he had moved to the United States and developed a steel-based magnetic tape. The invention was used by the U.S. military during the war, and the company revisited the idea immediately after. But, it needed someone to manufacture magnetic tape for it to use.
</p><p>
	As author David Morton noted in his 2006 book 
	<em>Sound Recording: The Life Story of a Technology</em>, <a href="https://www.google.com/books/edition/Sound_Recording/0ZmjkJwxyWcC?hl=en&amp;gbpv=1&amp;pg=PA121&amp;printsec=frontcover" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">3M was one of the best-suited companies on the market</a> to help Brush out. That‚Äôs because the groundbreaking work that the company had done to develop pressure-sensitive adhesive tape was an essential element of making magnetic tape effective.

	Strangely enough, Richard Gurley Drew, the inventor of much of 3M‚Äôs tape technology, was a musician‚Äîhe played banjo in a local orchestra‚Äîwhen he took a job with the company. He probably didn‚Äôt realize he was inventing a key element of 20th-century recording technology when he observed that auto body shops needed a way to ‚Äúmask off‚Äù areas of vehicles that were being whittled down with sandpaper, but his observation would prove useful to the invention of masking tape.

You might know his invention, developed in 1925, as Scotch Tape.
</p><p>
	In 1930, he followed it up with another invention that was even more amazing‚Äîtape made from cellophane, which by its nature was totally transparent. Another 3M employee developed the tape dispenser, and the two inventions reshaped offices the world over.
</p><p>
	So, when Brush looked to others to produce its recording medium, 3M was well positioned to help out due to magnetic tape‚Äôs similarity with its Scotch Tape. Brush eventually moved to other manufacturers, like Dupont. But the experience led 3M to continue developing metal-oxide tape technology, leading to the creation of the Scotch 111 reel-to-reel tape, which was one of the most popular types used in recording studios throughout the 1950s, according to the 
	<a href="https://museumofmagneticsoundrecording.org/Manufacturers3M.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Museum of Magnetic Sound Recording</em></a>.
</p><p>
	I admittedly have long had a fascination with these reel-to-reel tapes. A number of years ago, back when I lived in Milwaukee, I found a couple of blank reel-to-reel tapes created by 3M using the Scotch name. I bought them from a junk store, and maybe paid $2 for them. They managed to follow me through three states and five cities, and now sit on 
	<a href="https://midrange.tedium.co/issues/bless-this-mess/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">my intentionally organized pile of junk</a>. Based on my analysis of the container and the logotype it uses, they date to the mid-1960s or earlier. (No, I have not tried to record on them.)

	For years, 3M‚Äôs reel-to-reels had one of the strongest reputations in the music industry; they were built to be of superhigh quality. But you might be wondering, how did 3M make the leap from reel-to-reel tape to floppies? It feels like just as strange a leap as a masking tape company developing reel-to-reel audio tape.
	<br></p><p>
	But, again, it happened.
</p><h3>How 3M‚Äôs Tapes Went From Music to Data</h3><p>
	3M didn‚Äôt develop the floppy disk drive, either. 
	<a href="https://tedium.co/2023/07/22/alan-shugart-floppy-disk-history/" target="_blank">IBM did, and Shugart Associates further improved it</a> by making it small enough for regular users.

	But 3M, much as with mechanical tape, was well positioned to improve on it, leveraging its skills with mechanical media in the budding computing industry. In a way, 3M came to media manufacturing from the opposite direction than its disk-selling competitor Memorex did. Memorex started with computers and gradually came to develop and improve tape-based technology, which eventually evolved into floppy disks. On the other hand, 3M started with the raw materials and the manufacturing processes, and combined those into computing‚Äôs greatest commodity item, the floppy disk.
</p><p>
	3M got into the floppy disk market around the 
	<a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=pWBoOXVjuZ0C&amp;pg=PT10#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">fall of 1973</a>. It was not the only manufacturer of disks out there‚Äîsome names from this era include Verbatim, Control Data, Dysan, and BASF. Most of these companies started with computing technology‚Äîfor example, Dysan worked closely with Shugart Associates on the 5.25-inch floppy. But 3M wasn‚Äôt alone in starting with the raw materials. BASF, a German chemical manufacturer, has a somewhat similar corporate history and logo design to fellow thick-Helvetica enthusiast 3M. (Though 3M obviously <a href="https://www.basf.com/global/en/who-we-are/history/chronology/1925-1944/1939-1945.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">never associated with the Nazis</a> during World War II, so there‚Äôs that.)

	3M didn‚Äôt rest on its laurels with the floppy disk either, and tried to push the technology further, most notably with 
	<a href="https://www.storagenewsletter.com/2018/09/25/history-1991-floptical-by-insite-peripherals/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Floptical disk technology</a>, which Jim Adkisson, who helped create the 5.25-inch floppy at Shugart Associates, developed in the 1980s. A partnership of 3M, Maxell, and <a href="https://tedium.co/2016/12/06/iomega-zip-disk-click-of-death-history/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Iomega</a> created the Floptical disk, which could hold 20 megabytes of data on something that looked a lot like a 3.5-inch floppy. Unfortunately the floptical disk flopped, losing out to products like Iomega‚Äôs iconic <a href="https://www.computinghistory.org.uk/det/22978/Iomega-Zip-Drive-100-Parallel/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Zip drives</a>.
</p><p>
	3M also worked in more specialized media, developing high-capacity optical disks that fit into standard floppy and optical disk mechanisms, as well as high-end tape drives intended for the server room rather than your cassette player.
</p><p>
	In many ways, 3M was out front on one of the most important elements of computing and was making huge profits from it. But by the end of 1995, those days were done. What changed?
</p><p><span data-rm-shortcode-id="7620f5c6d1db2474feabc8fb1ec83bbc"><iframe frameborder="0" height="auto" type="lazy-iframe" scrolling="no" data-runner-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bOHKgENMcGQ?rel=0" width="100%"></iframe></span><small placeholder="Add Photo Caption...">3M advertised its floppy disk as more reliable than the competition in no uncertain terms. </small></p><h3>What Led 3M to Kick a Multibillion-Dollar Business to the Curb</h3><p>
	By 1995, 3M‚Äôs magnetic-media arm had evolved into a US $2.3 billion business, according to
	<a href="https://content.time.com/time/subscriber/article/0,33009,985024-1,00.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Time</em></a>, which made it a significant chunk of 3M‚Äôs overall offering.
</p><p>
	But at that time, high technology‚Äî
	<em>especially</em> consumer technology‚Äîwas starting to look like a bad bet for legacy companies. This was around the same period that AT&amp;T, still smarting from misadventures like the <a href="https://www.inverse.com/input/features/fax-on-the-beach-the-story-of-atts-eo-communicator-90s-ipad-flop" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">EO Personal Communicator</a>, spun off Bell Labs as Lucent Technologies.
</p><p>
	3M‚Äôs story, in its own words, suggests a similar crisis of culture. In 
	<a href="https://multimedia.3m.com/mws/media/171240O/3m-century-of-innovation-book.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>A Century of Innovation</em></a>, a book published by the company in 2002, around the time of its 100-year anniversary, the company compared the creation of the spin-off, which it called ‚Äúthe most wrenching decision in its history,‚Äù to that of its determination eight years earlier to sell its Duplicating Products Division, which sold copying machines:
</p><p><em>Of all the businesses 3M has shed over its 100 years, the two seminal decisions that people point to as most significant involved the sale of 3M‚Äôs Duplicating Products business to Harris Corporation in Atlanta, Georgia, and the spin-off of 3M‚Äôs data-storage and imaging-systems businesses in 1996 creating a new company called Imation in Oakdale, Minnesota, near 3M headquarters. The two decisions have several elements in common‚Äîboth involved businesses that 3M created and, in fact, ranked number one in the marketplace for decades. They were ‚Äúhomegrown‚Äù businesses‚Äîlargely created within 3M and commercialized and built with the energy of many internal sponsors and champions. The businesses were risky because the products were based on pioneering technologies. They not only changed the basis of competition; they also created all new, global industries. The businesses were highly profitable for decades, and they represented a significant share of the company‚Äôs total annual revenues. They also produced many of 3M‚Äôs next generation of leaders.</em></p><p>
	So what happened? Essentially, despite the company‚Äôs success working in industrial and professional settings, doing things for consumers like producing videotapes, floppy disks, and cassettes meant moving out of its comfort zone. These products, initially developed for businesses, grew so popular that they suddenly needed to be available at every big-box store and drugstore alike, and, Post-its aside, retail was not a fit for the kind of company 3M was.
</p><p>
	But more significantly, other companies were simply better at undercutting, and per the corporate biography, that required some tough decisions to be made:
</p><p><em>While it sold its products for little or no profit, its competition sold their products for even less. Even though the consumer business had huge growth potential, 3M had little experience with a low-cost, low-profit-margin model.</em></p><p><em> The markings were clear‚Äîexit this business, even though 3M invented it. To stay in the ‚Äúdog fight‚Äù meant 3M had to invest enormous amounts of money in order to remain the low-cost producer, with no assurance that profit margins ever would improve. ‚ÄúExiting it was the right decision,‚Äù [former senior vice president Al] Huber said.</em></p><p>
	Seeing what came after, it‚Äôs hard to disagree. While floppies were still a significant medium in the mid-1990s, it was obvious that they would not be enough capacity for the next generation of data hoarders. It would only be a couple of years before Apple would put the first dagger in the heart of the floppy disk with 
	<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IMac_G3" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the iMac</a>, breaking with tradition by releasing a personal computer in 1998 with no built-in floppy disk drive.
</p><p><span data-rm-shortcode-id="5b53a6e7ab0f74ffc4d7a5fed5a851a5"><iframe frameborder="0" height="auto" type="lazy-iframe" scrolling="no" data-runner-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3qkQi3zZVhg?rel=0" width="100%"></iframe></span><small placeholder="Add Photo Caption...">Imation carried on a floppy-disk ad campaign through the late 1990s. </small></p><p>
	That was a harbinger of what was to come. Within a decade of the decision, floppy drives, compact cassettes, and videotapes‚Äîthe three key elements of 3M‚Äôs move into consumer-driven magnetic media‚Äîhad fallen by the wayside. Imation, still active today, is owned by O-Jin Corp., a Korean technology company 
	<a href="http://www.imation.com/board/bbs/board.php?bo_table=news_en&amp;wr_id=11" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">that basically bought it for its trademarked name</a>.</p><p>Much like its one-time competitor Memorex, Imation is a technology ghost kitchen. Its former corporate parent 3M, meanwhile, has a market cap of $51.33 billion at the time of this writing.</p><h3>3M‚Äôs Magnetic Legacy</h3><p>
	In a lot of ways, I think 3M‚Äôs persisting deep association with computing, despite the fact that the company left the field decades ago, comes down to the fact that it had a very recognizable logo design during its computer heyday.</p><p><span></span>My first experience with 3M was seeing its bright red logo on floppy disks used in classrooms with Apple IIe computers in the late 1980s and early ‚Äô90s. 3M was instantly recognizable among those responsible for creating the disks we needed to load up <em>Number Munchers</em> and <em>Commander Keen</em>, and as a result, its name is forever imprinted into the brains of retro-tech nerds the world over. It is a memory that gives me warm feelings.
</p><p>
	But 3M, for a number of reasons, is not a company that carries a lot of goodwill with younger generations. For example, the company is closely associated with the manufacturing of a variety of chemicals, including PFOS (Perfluorooctane sulfonate), a key ingredient in Scotchguard and other water-resistant materials. It‚Äôs one of many PFAS (perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl) substances that are believed to be harmful to humans.
</p><p>
	The floppy disks that I and other elder millennials associate with a company that was essential to our youthful computing experience are long gone, shuttled away as a non-core business for a giant corporation that is best described as an amalgamation of non-core businesses loosely held together by a logo and backing in chemistry and raw materials.
