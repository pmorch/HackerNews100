<p>We’ve spent a lot of time thinking about tables. Tables—like plots—are crucial as a last step toward presenting information. There is surprising sophistication and nuance in designing effective tables. Over the past 5,000 years, they’ve evolved from simple grids to highly structured displays of data. Although we argue that the mid-1900s served as a high point, the popularization and wider accessibility of computing seemingly brought us back to the simple, ancient times.</p>
<p>Okay, it’s not all <em>that bad</em> but the workers of data are today confronted with an all-too-familiar dilemma: copy your data into a tool like Excel to make the table, or, display an otherwise unpolished table. Through the exploration of the qualities that make tables shine, the backstory of tables as a display of data, and the issues faced today, it’s clear how we can solve the <strong>great table dilemma</strong> with <a href="https://github.com/posit-dev/great-tables"><strong>Great Tables</strong></a>.</p>

<h3 data-anchor-id="what-is-a-table-really">What is a table, really?</h3>
<p>Before getting to what makes tables <em>shine</em> we should first define what a table is. This is surprisingly hard! But I believe it can be boiled down to two basic rules:</p>
<ul>
<li>the data is represented as columns and rows</li>
<li>the data is primarily text</li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s look at an example of a simple table with actual data to tie this theory to practice.</p>

</table>

</div>
<p>
A table of named individuals along with a select set of characteristics.
</p>
<p>This table arranges records containing personal characteristics as columns and rows. Each person is a row, and each characteristic makes up a different column. The characteristics use different types of data, like dates, numbers, and text. This arrangement makes it easy to look up individual values or make comparisons across the different rows or columns.</p>
<p>Note that there are horizontal lines separating the rows. This aesthetic touch, while not strictly required for a table, serves as a visual reinforcement for separating the individual rows.</p>
<p>The order of the columns matters, and that we start with the <code>Name</code> column here is no accident. If that column were the last (i.e., furthest to the right), it would be slightly more confusing for the reader since the subject for the record isn’t immediate. In addition to order, column labels play an important role for indicating what data is in each column. They’re not always necessary but in most cases they remove the guesswork for what type of data is contained within each column.</p>
<p>We’ll go into some detail later about how <a href="https://github.com/posit-dev/great-tables"><strong>Great Tables</strong></a> provides affordances for structuring information for better legibility and how the package can be used to adorn the table with other structural elements. For now, our conception of a table can be summarized in this schematic.</p>
<p><img src="https://posit-dev.github.io/great-tables/blog/design-philosophy/a_simple_table.png"></p>
<p>
A simple table has: (1) cells containing data, (2) an arrangement of columns and rows, and (3) column labels to describe the type data in each column.
</p>
<p>Now, let’s go back: way back. In examining where tables came from, we might better understand the great story of tables.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-early-history-of-tables">
<h3 data-anchor-id="the-early-history-of-tables">The early history of tables</h3>
<p>Tables emerged from square grids. When grids are made like this, you invariably generate containers that may hold some sort of information. The earliest known examples of grids go very far back in human history. Twenty-five thousand year old representations of the grid are found on the walls of the Lascaux and Niaux caves in France<a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://posit-dev.github.io/great-tables/blog/design-philosophy/cave_grids.png"></p>
<p>
Reproductions of early grids found on cave walls.
</p>
<p>In the second century BC, the Greek astronomer Hipparchus used latitude and longitude to locate celestial and terrestrial positions<a href="#fn2" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>. At around AD 150, Ptolmey published <em>Geographia</em>, which contains 25 geographical maps accompanied by methodologies for their construction using grids<a href="#fn3" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>. The Romans employed a grid system called <em>centuriation</em>, which can be described as land measurement (using surveyors’ instruments) to realize the formation of square grids using roads, canals, or agricultural plots<a href="#fn4" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a>.</p>
<p>When agriculture became more widespread (ca. 10,000 years ago), there was the need to document and manage economic transactions to do with farming, livestock, and the division of labor. In the fourth millennium BC, Mesopotamian cities that traded with far way kingdoms needed to keep such records. Clay tablets recovered from the ancient Sumerian city of Uruk show early yet sophisticated tables. Here is a drawing of one of the recovered tablets, which contains an accounting of deliveries of barley and malt from two individuals for the production of beer<a href="#fn5" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://posit-dev.github.io/great-tables/blog/design-philosophy/uruk_tablet_with_annotations.png"></p>
<p>
Drawing of clay tablet from Sumerian city of Uruk, circa 3200-3000 BC. Uruk III Tablet (MSVO 3, 51, Louvre Museum, Paris, France). Annotated with the meanings of the columns, rows, and cells.
</p>
<p>Note that the recovered tablet is meant to be read from right to left. Inside each box is an ideogram (a symbol that represented a word or idea) and a numerical value representing a quantity.</p>
<p>Its structure is where things get super interesting:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rows: there are roughly two rows, each corresponding to an individual.</li>
<li>Columns: the first two columns from the right contain counts of malt (rightmost column) and barley (second rightmost column).</li>
<li>Subtotals: the third column from the right sums barley and malt within each individual, and the left-most column displays the grand total.</li>
</ul>
<p>As a bonus, the table has a footer, since the bottom row contains the name of the official in charge.</p>
<p>Zooming ahead about a thousand years, you start to see more systematically structured tables. Here’s a photo of a cuneiform tablet that was originally from Mesopotamia (from the Temple of Enlil at Nippur, ca. 1850 BC)<a href="#fn6" id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a>, containing sources of revenue and monthly disbursements for 50 temple personnel.</p>
<p><img src="https://posit-dev.github.io/great-tables/blog/design-philosophy/nippur_cuneiform_tablet.png"></p>
<p>

</p>
<p>You can see right away that there is a more regular grid and, if you probe deeper, there are more similarities than differerences with the tables of today. While difficult to pick them out, the following table elements are present<a href="#fn7" id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>column headings (month names) and row titles (names/professions of individuals).</li>
<li>cells with no information (look at the blank or smooth cells along rows)</li>
<li>numerical values in the cells</li>
<li>subtotals for each individual every six months</li>
<li>grand totals</li>
<li>annotations with explanatory notes</li>
</ul>
<p>Later on, tables were less inscribed on clay and more on wax tablets, papyrus, and paper. The media have changed, writing technologies have changed, and the design and presentation of tables also went through changes.</p>
</section>
<section id="midcentury-modern-tables">
<h3 data-anchor-id="midcentury-modern-tables">Midcentury modern tables</h3>
<p>Perhaps the best period for tables was around the middle of the 20th century. Technologies for table (and surrounding document) preparation included the offset printer, the typewriter, and varitype<a href="#fn8" id="fnref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> (my favorite). The technologies were sufficiently advanced as to allow the precise typesetting of table elements. While of course constrained by the limited space available on pages, tabular design at this point had many workable solutions for fitting tables into single pages or dispersing the tabular content across multiple pages. The combination of advanced printing technology with advanced knowledge of tabular design resulted in <em>beautiful tables</em>.</p>
<p>There’s no greater embodiment of that pairing of technology and design than the <a href="https://www2.census.gov/library/publications/1949/general/tabular-presentation.pdf"><em>Manual of Tabular Presentation</em></a><a href="#fn9" id="fnref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a>, written and published by the United States Bureau of the Census. It is truly a remarkable work which goes into great detail on how the department imagines the ideal designs of information-rich tables. The work articulates the different parts of a table (and each part is given a descriptive name), sparing no detail when describing those different table parts in rigorous detail. Throughout its hundreds of pages, the authors make strong recommendations on what to do (and what <em>not</em> to do) for many tabulation scenarios. When poring over the tables visually depicted in the book, you can’t help but see that tables can both look really good <em>and</em> contain a density of information. The promise and the result is a balance of form and function.</p>
<p>We at <a href="https://github.com/posit-dev/great-tables"><strong>Great Tables</strong></a> borrow liberally from this work because many of its tabular design principles are just as good now as they were back then (and we’ll talk about what we took from that work in the next section). We’ll end this brief section with a visual montage of snippets from the <em>Census Manual</em>, which provides a glimpse of the sound advice on offer.</p>
<p><img src="https://posit-dev.github.io/great-tables/blog/design-philosophy/snippets_from_manual_tablular_presentation.png"></p>

Little nuggets of wisdom from the <em>Census Manual</em>. This may very well be the ultimate book on tabular design.

<section id="the-late-history-of-tables">
<h3 data-anchor-id="the-late-history-of-tables">The late history of tables</h3>
<p>With computing technologies becoming more accessible by the 1970s and 1980s, people were able to generate tables in both electronic and print form. The democratization of computational tables arguably began with VisiCalc in 1979, a massive success that initiated the computing category of spreadsheeting software. There’s an undeniable advantage to having data analyzed and transformed in computing environments, but, this comes at a cost. This is what it looked like:</p>
<p><img src="https://posit-dev.github.io/great-tables/blog/design-philosophy/visicalc.png"></p>
<p>
This is a table in VisiCalc (earliest example of a table in a spreadsheet application). It’s pretty crude compared to the tables in print but the advantage here is that you can calculate values quickly.
</p>
<p>The grid cells couldn’t be styled with borders for presentation purposes, the values couldn’t be formatted, and the tables couldn’t even be printed. I mean, <a href="https://www.pcjs.org/software/pcx86/app/other/visicalc/1981/">try it out</a> and you’ll see that this is quite limited in more than a few ways.</p>
<p>Over time, and this took about 10-15 years, tables-within-spreadsheets got a little easier on the eyes. By the early 1990s, Excel could paint borders on your tables, better typographical support was available, and the formatting of values was fully-featured (though, <a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/computing/prevent-excel-from-reformatting-two-numbers-to-a-date-and-month/">wonky</a>). Great! Problem solved, right? Not really.</p>
<p>While Excel tables from the last three decades looked much better than 1980s-spreadsheet-borne tables, they could never hold a candle to the what was shown in the <em>Census Manual</em> (no matter how much of an Excel expert you became). Further to this, data analysis started to became a thing accomplished outside of Excel. One example of that is Python and its use inside Jupyter notebooks. We now have a bag of problematic scenarios</p>
<ul>
<li>all Python: analyze data and generate tables all in Python (bad tables)</li>
<li>all Excel: analyze data and make tables in Excel (less flexible analysis)</li>
<li>split-brained: analyze data in Python, copy over to Excel to make tables (not reproducible)</li>
</ul>
<p>All of these are suboptimal solutions. We propose that it is far better to do everything in Python: the data ingestion, the data analysis, and the data visualization. The visualization step is what’s done for plots and other types of graphics composed from data, it shouldn’t be any different when it comes to generating summary tables.</p>

<h3 data-anchor-id="approach-to-tables-taken-by-great-tables">Approach to tables taken by <strong>Great Tables</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/posit-dev/great-tables"><strong>Great Tables</strong></a> restores the elegance of midcentury tables with the power of a coding interface. With <a href="https://github.com/posit-dev/great-tables"><strong>Great Tables</strong></a> anyone can make beautiful tables in Python. Our framework expresses a table as a combination of six independent components. With this framework, you can structure the table, format the values, and style the table. We firmly believe that the methods offered in the package enable people to construct a wide variety of useful tables that work across many disciplines.</p>
<p>You build with <a href="https://github.com/posit-dev/great-tables"><strong>Great Tables</strong></a> iteratively, starting off with your table body from code, adding styling, formatting and other components.&nbsp;Here is a schematic that outlines our terminology and depicts how the different table components are related to each other:</p>
<p><img src="https://posit-dev.github.io/great-tables/blog/design-philosophy/composition_of_a_table_in_GT.png"></p>
<p>
A schematic with the complete set of table components that can be utilized in <strong>Great Tables</strong>.
</p>
<p>Note the following six component pieces:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Table Header</strong>: a place for a title and subtitle, where you can succinctly describe the table content</li>
<li><strong>Column Labels</strong>: the column labels define the content of each column, and spanners are headings over groups of columns</li>
<li><strong>Stub Head</strong>: the ‘top-left’ location, where a label could be used in a variety of ways</li>
<li><strong>Row Stub</strong>: for row information, including row grouping labels</li>
<li><strong>Table Body</strong>: contains cells and so it’s where the data lives</li>
<li><strong>Table Footer</strong>: a place for additional information pertaining to the table content</li>
</ul>
<p>Here’s a table that takes advantage of the different components available in <a href="https://github.com/posit-dev/great-tables"><strong>Great Tables</strong></a>. It contains the names and addresses of people.</p>

<p>
A table of named individuals redone, <strong>Great Tables</strong> style!
</p>
<p>Notice that there is a blue row stub component that makes the row labels distinct from the body of the table. This is important because each person described forms a unique observation and we want to highlight the subject of each row. The heading provides context on what’s contained within the table. The two column spanners arrange the columns into sensible groupings (e.g., ‘Location’). The consistent use of blue lines and cell backgrounds gives the table a professional look.</p>
<p>If you look at the table code above you’ll see that every method for modifying the table starts with <code>tab_</code>. These particular methods are concerned with adding a table component (e.g., <code>tab_header()</code> creates a <strong>Table Header</strong>) and they’re designed to be easy and straightforward to use.</p>
<section id="formatting">
<h4 data-anchor-id="formatting">Formatting</h4>
<p>Table structuring is important, but not the only thing. Tables in different disciplines have a certain set of display requirements specific for any values shown. Even something as simple as a number can be formatted in many different ways depending on a community’s norms and expectations. This extends to a very wide area when we consider that dates, times, and currencies also need to be formatted.</p>
<p>Depending on your display requirements, a raw value like 134,000 could presented as:</p>
<ul>
<li>scientific notation (<code>fmt_scientific()</code>): 1.34 × 10<sup>5</sup></li>
<li>a number in the German locale (<code>fmt_number()</code>): 134.000,00</li>
<li>a compact integer value (<code>fmt_integer()</code>): 134K</li>
</ul>
<p>The problem grows worse when values need to be conveyed as images or plots. If you’re a medical analyst, for example, you might need to effectively convey whether test results for a patient are improving or worsening over time. Reading such data as a sequence of numbers across a row can slow interpretation. But by using <em>nanoplots</em>, available as the <code>fmt_nanoplot()</code> formatting method, readers can spot trends right away. Here’s an example that provides test results over a series of days.</p>

<p>Notice that if you hover over the data points, you still get values for each of the days. We designed nanoplots to be stripped down plotting visualizations that balance the quick visual interpretation of a plot against the compactness of a table.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/posit-dev/great-tables"><strong>Great Tables</strong></a> contains a lot of functionality for formatting. If you peeked at the code in the above table displays you might have noticed there are methods beginning with <code>fmt_</code> (i.e., <code>fmt_date()</code>, <code>fmt_integer()</code>, <code>fmt_nanoplot()</code>). We want to make many formatting methods available to serve different users’ needs. We also want them to be easy to use, but with many useful options to provide flexibility for all your formatting tasks.</p>

<h4 data-anchor-id="great-tables-is-focused-on-display">Great Tables is focused on display</h4>
<p>There are myriad ways that people interact with tables. <a href="https://github.com/posit-dev/great-tables"><strong>Great Tables</strong></a> is focused on the display of tables for publication and presentation. If you’re analyzing data in a database, you might want a simple table display that offers controls to navigate and filter hundreds, thousands, maybe even more records. And that is great for those situations.</p>
<p>The publication of results is a entirely different task, and the emphasis here is on structuring, formatting, and styling. We believe that beautiful table displays should do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>make information easier to digest</li>
<li>provide extra context wherever needed</li>
<li>adhere to the style of the document or of the organization</li>
</ul>
<p>We wanted to help the type of user that wanted to present data in this way. This is typically what you see in journal articles, in books, and in reports. We think the area of static summary tables deserves it’s own focus. This class of tables can look <em>great</em> and we offer various <code>opt_*()</code> methods in the <a href="https://github.com/posit-dev/great-tables"><strong>Great Tables</strong></a> API so it’s that much easier to provide a great table to your readers.</p>

<h3 data-anchor-id="in-conclusion">In conclusion</h3>
<p>Tables have come a long way and we’ve learned a lot from our continued research in tabular design. We hope to make the <a href="https://github.com/posit-dev/great-tables"><strong>Great Tables</strong></a> package useful for your generation of summary tables. Given there’s ample room for innovation in this area, we’ll keep plugging away at doing that work to improve the API. We measure success by the quality of the tables the package is able to produce and we always keep that goal top of mind.</p>
<p>We’re very excited about where things are going with <a href="https://github.com/posit-dev/great-tables"><strong>Great Tables</strong></a> and we geniunely appreciate community feedback. If ever you want to talk tables with us, you’re always welcome to jump into our <a href="https://discord.com/invite/Ux7nrcXHVV">Discord Server</a> and drop us a line!</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <p>A paleolithic man crouches in the bushes, waiting for something to catch his attention. The tiniest movement kick-starts the bloodlust, that hard-wired desire to <em>just fucking get it</em>. He flings a projectile in its direction, an arrow or a spear maybe — weapons that create just the right amount of distance between his own body and that of his prey. This is important. If his aim is true, if the animal drops lifelessly to the ground, he will have accomplished two things: one, dinner. Two, and perhaps more important, he will have won.</p><p>Human history, or so conventional wisdom goes, is a story of violent, merciless competition. We have come to embrace the idea that a succession of one thing defeating another literally is history, whether that’s between species, political leaders, or conflicting ideologies. In our inherited notion of human history, our caveman — and he is always a man — comes home from a hard day on the plains with a wildebeest or a deer slung over his shoulder. His adoring cavewife and cavekids tuck into the prize around the campfire, as the winner recounts the tale of his courage and heroism. Just as significant as the prize, that hard-won carcass of meat, is the story. The drama. Many stories, told in chronological order, are what we call history (perhaps why, in German, the word for story and history are identical: <em>Geschichte</em>.)</p><p>This muddle of history and heroism has given us theories of Great Men, and a truly incomprehensible number of World War II documentaries, and also goes some way to explaining our current and insufficient appraisal of climate change. Capitalism, or so wrote Marx back in 1844, supposedly alienates us from four different things: from ourselves, from each other, from the products of our labor, and from nature. We develop an adversarial relationship with each. “Nature”(a constructed, slippery category that shifts over time) can, or even must, be tamed: capricious rivers are diverted, genomes are edited, crude oil is transformed into fuel.</p><p>The unpredictability brought on by climate change should, in theory, disrupt this thinking. The catastrophic repercussions of human activity, like melting glaciers and collapsing ecosystems, tell us that “nature” was never really “mastered” after all. Yet the same story persists: humans will win. We must. We always win. Not long ago, I saw a poster in central London, presumably put there by some university department, that said something like “Don’t worry. We’re on it” — the ‘it’ being the solution to climate change. The sheer hubris of some of the techno-fixes being bandied about with varying levels of seriousness, like sending a mirror the size of Greenland into space or pumping clouds of sulphur dioxide into the air, border on the dystopian. Conferences may have replaced the campfire, but the principle is basically the same: it’s the story, the legend, that matters.</p><hr><p>Storytelling is a way of configuring and reconfiguring worlds; narratives can bring realities into being. I once took a writing workshop with someone who swore by power posing — the idea that adopting a wide stance with one’s arms raised quite literally invokes stature — and she would spend a minute before every reading “hacking” confidence into her body. With her arms above her head and her legs astride, she swore the technique changed her mentality and made her feel like she controlled the room. Without it, she claimed, she would be a gibbering, nervous wreck. However daft you might think power posing is, I was always impressed by her ability to slip fiction into the realm of the real.</p><blockquote data-hash="61301914"><span>Questioning the spear’s phallic, murderous logic, instead Le Guin tells the story of the carrier bag, the sling, the shell, or the gourd.</span></blockquote><p>The generative potential of storytelling is especially pronounced in speculative fiction, a genre that mines our current reality as raw material for imaginary worldbuilding (this includes things like sci-fi, fantasy and horror). The genre’s patron saint, Ursula Le Guin, died last year aged 88, but she left behind her a breathtaking legacy of fiercely intelligent books and short stories imbued with her own anarcho-feminist, anticolonial politics. One of her best-known novels, <em>The Dispossessed</em>, imagines a small, separatist planet administered according to anarcho-syndicalist principles, what she subtitles an “ambiguous utopia” full of contradictions and complexity. On the planet Anarres, prison does not exist, work is voluntary, any claim to ownership is dismissed as “propertarian” — yet, despite all this, greed and power can still take hold. It feels like a book of thinking aloud, in which Le Guin is trying to figure out different realities through writing. It speaks to the kind of writer Le Guin was: generous and open minded, investigative and bursting with ideas, willing to be wrong, yet always reaching for a world free from harm.</p><p>“The Carrier Bag Theory of Fiction,” an essay Le Guin wrote in 1986, disputes the idea that the spear was the earliest human tool, proposing that it was actually the receptacle. Questioning the spear’s phallic, murderous logic, instead Le Guin tells the story of the carrier bag, the sling, the shell, or the gourd. In this empty vessel, early humans could carry more than can be held in the hand and, therefore, gather food for later. Anyone who consistently forgets to bring their tote bag to the supermarket knows how significant this is. And besides, Le Guin writes, the idea that the spear came before the vessel doesn’t even make sense. “Sixty-five to eighty percent of what human beings ate in those regions in Paleolithic, Neolithic, and prehistoric times was gathered; only in the extreme Arctic was meat the staple food.”</p><p>Not only is the carrier bag theory plausible, it also does meaningful ideological work — shifting the way we look at humanity's foundations from a narrative of domination to one of gathering, holding, and sharing. Because I am, despite my best efforts, often soppy and sentimental, I sometimes imagine this like a really comforting group hug. But it’s not, really: the carrier bag holds things, sure, but it’s also messy and sometimes conflicted. Like when you’re trying to grab your sunglasses out of your bag, but those are stuck on your headphones, which are also tangled around your keys, and now the sunglasses have slipped into that hole in the lining.</p><p>Le Guin’s carrier bag is, in addition to a story about early humans, a method for storytelling itself, meaning it’s also a method of history. But unlike the spear (which follows a linear trajectory towards its target), and unlike the kind of linear way we’ve come to think of time and history in the West, the carrier bag is a big jumbled mess of stuff. One thing is entangled with another, and with another. Le Guin once described temporality in her Hainish Universe (a confederacy of human planets that feature in a number of her books) in the most delightfully psychedelic terms: “Any timeline for the books of Hainish descent would resemble the web of a spider on LSD.”</p><p>This lack of clear trajectory allowed Le Guin to test out all kinds of political eventualities, without the need to tie everything neatly together. It makes room for complexity and contradiction, for difference and simultaneity. This, I think, is a pretty radical way of looking at the world, one that departs from the idea of history as a long line of victories. Le Guin describes her discovery of the carrier bag theory as grounding her “in human culture in a way I never felt grounded before.” The stick, sword, or spear, designed for “bashing and killing,” alienated her from history so much that she felt she “was either extremely defective as a human being, or not human at all.”</p><hr><p>The only problem is that a carrier bag story isn’t, at first glance, very exciting. “It is hard to tell”, writes Le Guin, “a really gripping tale of how I wrested a wild-oat seed from its husk, and then another, and then another, and then another, and then another, and then I scratched my gnat bites, and Ool said something funny, and we went to the creek and got a drink and watched newts for a while, and then I found another patch of oats…”</p><p>As well as its meandering narrative, a carrier bag story also contains no heroes. There are, instead, many different protagonists with equal importance to the plot. This is a very difficult way to tell a story, fictional or otherwise. While, in reality, most meaningful social change is the result of collective action, we aren’t very good at recounting such a diffusely distributed account. The meetings, the fundraising, the careful and drawn-out negotiations — they’re so boring! Who wants to watch a movie about a four-hour meeting between community stakeholders?</p><p>The introduction of a singular hero, however, replicates a very specific and historical power relation. The pioneers and the saviors: likely male, likely white, almost certainly brimming with unearned confidence. The veneration of the hero reduces others into victims: those who must be rescued. “The prototypical savior is a person who has been raised in privilege and taught implicitly or explicitly (or both) that they possess the answers and skills needed to rescue others,” writes Jordan Flaherty in his book <em>No More Heroes</em>. To be a hero is fundamentally privileged, and any act of heroism reinforces that privilege.</p><p>The carrier bag story, with its lack of heroes, is a collective rather than individualist endeavor. It’s this that differentiates the carrier bag from Walter Benjamin’s “ragpicker,” an emblematic modernist figure who “early in the morning, bad tempered and a tad tipsy, spears remnants of discourse and fragments of language with his stick and throws them, grumbling, into his cart.” Engaged in endless bricolage, the ragpicker is a serial appropriator — it’s John Cage taking the Balinese gamelan as his own, it’s Picasso’s “primitivism.” The carrier bag gatherer, meanwhile, is no lone genius (genius being its own kind of heroism, after all), but rather someone rooted in a shared existence.</p><hr><p>We will not “beat” climate change, nor is “nature” our adversary. If the planet could be considered a container for all life, in which everything — plants, animals, humans — are all held together, then to attempt domination becomes a self-defeating act. By letting ourselves “become part of the killer story,” writes Le Guin, “we may get finished along with it.” All of which is to say: we have to abandon the old story.</p><p>The social theorist Donna Haraway, who has been deeply influenced by Le Guin’s writings, implores us to tell other stories about this weird shared reality: “It matters what stories tell stories,” she writes. “It matters what worlds world worlds.” We are still learning how to tell stories about climate change. It is fundamentally a more-than-human problem, one that simultaneously affects all communities of people, animals, plants — albeit asymmetrically. The kind of story we need right now is unheroic, incorporating social movements, political imagination and nonhuman actors. In this story, time doesn’t progress in an easily digestible straight line, with a beginning, middle and end. Instead there are many timelines, each darting around, bringing actions of the past and future into the present. It collapses nature as a category, recognizing that we’re already a part of it. In a climate change story, nobody will win, but if we learn to tell it differently more of us can survive.</p> <p> Siobhan Leddy is a writer, editor, and researcher living in Berlin. </p> </div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p><strong>tl;dr:</strong>
			Deep technical analysis of the <code>CONTINUATION</code> Flood: a class of vulnerabilities within numerous HTTP/2 protocol implementations. In many cases, it poses a more severe threat compared to the Rapid Reset: a single machine (and in certain instances, a mere single TCP connection or a handful of frames) has the potential to disrupt server availability, with consequences ranging from server crashes to substantial performance degradation. Remarkably, requests that constitute an attack are not visible in HTTP access logs. <strong>A simplified security advisory and list of affected projects can be found in: <a href="https://nowotarski.info/http2-continuation-flood/">HTTP/2 <code>CONTINUATION</code> Flood</a>.</strong>
		</p><section>
			<h2 id="preface">Preface</h2>
<p>In October 2023 I learnt about HTTP/2 Rapid Reset attack, dubbed <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/identity-security/google-cloud-mitigated-largest-ddos-attack-peaking-above-398-million-rps">“the largest DDoS attack to date”</a>. I didn’t have deep knowledge of HTTP/2 back then. I knew it’s basics like frames or HPACK but I was focusing more on <a href="https://nowotarski.info/http-chunk-extensions/">HTTP/1.1 protocol</a> and <a href="https://nowotarski.info/golang-textproto-reader/">programming languages</a> vulnerabilities. I decided to dedicate time to exploring HTTP/2 from a security analysis perspective after concluding my then-current research.</p>
<h2 id="a-quick-intro-to-http2">A quick intro to HTTP/2</h2>
<p>The main difference between HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 is that the later is a binary protocol and client and server exchange <em>frames</em> instead of text lines. There are many frame types, including some control frames that does not transmit data but rather allow configuration of an HTTP/2 session (like <code>SETTINGS</code> or <code>WINDOW_UPDATE</code>). To make this vulnerability easy to understand I need to present two frames: <code>HEADERS</code> frame and <code>CONTINUATION</code> frame. For those who would like to catch up, the best way to learn it is by reading <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9204">RFC9204</a>.</p>

<p><img src="https://nowotarski.info/continuation_frames_light.svg">

</p>

<p><img src="https://nowotarski.info/continuation_frames_dark.svg">

</p>

<p><code>HEADERS</code> frames allow sending HTTP headers of, both, request and response. The headers are stored in field block fragment and are encoded using <code>HPACK</code>, encoding algorithm that allows compression of header data. It is using static and dynamic tables of commonly used headers and Huffman encoding for the rest of headers. As other frames, this one can have some flags set, along them:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>END_HEADERS</code>: when set, tells the counterparty that this frame contains all the headers they wanted to send,</li>
<li><code>END_STREAM</code>: when set, tells the counterparty that there will be no request/response body.</li>
</ul>
<p>The frames also have a maximum size, configured at the beginning of communication. If a received frame exceeds the allowed size the connection is dropped with a protocol error. So what happens if a single <code>HEADER</code> frame is not enough to store all the headers? It sends the frame with <code>END_HEADERS</code> flag unset and continues the stream of headers using <code>CONTINUATION</code> frame.</p>
<h2 id="continuation-frame"><code>CONTINUATION</code> frame</h2>
<p><code>CONTINUATION</code> frames are very similar to <code>HEADER</code> frames but they have just one flag: <code>END_HEADERS</code> which has the same function: when set the counterparty knows that more headers are coming in the following <code>CONTINUATION</code> frames.</p>
<p>To sum it up, if headers exceed a single frame allowed size they are split in a frame stream:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>HEADERS</code> (no <code>END_HEADERS</code> flag),</li>
<li><code>CONTINUATION</code> (no flags),</li>
<li><code>CONTINUATION</code> (no flags),</li>
<li>…</li>
<li><code>CONTINUATION</code> (<code>END_HEADERS</code> <strong>set</strong>),</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://nowotarski.info/continuation_good_light.svg">

</p>

<p><img src="https://nowotarski.info/continuation_good_dark.svg">

</p>
<p>After the last frame, either <code>DATA</code> frame is sent (contains request data) or HTTP/2 stream ends.</p>
<h2 id="continuation-flood-vulnerability"><code>CONTINUATION</code> Flood Vulnerability</h2>
<p>What if a client starts a new HTTP/2 stream and sends <code>HEADERS</code> and <code>CONTINUATION</code> frames but <code>END_HEADERS</code> flag is <strong>never</strong> set? This would create an infinite stream of headers that HTTP/2 server would need to parse and store in memory.</p>

<p><img src="https://nowotarski.info/continuation_bad_light.svg">

</p>

<p><img src="https://nowotarski.info/continuation_bad_dark.svg">

</p>
<p>In HTTP/1.1 world, servers are protected from infinite headers by two mechanisms:</p>
<ul>
<li>Header size limit: if headers list exceed the allowed size, the connection is dropped.</li>
<li>Request / headers timeouts: if the request/headers are not sent in timely manner, the connection is dropped.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the last couple of months I checked dozens of implementations and, somehow, these protections were not implemented (or implemented incorrectly) even in major HTTP/2 servers, most notably: Apache httpd, Envoy and many HTTP/2 packages or codecs. I can divide outcomes of the bugs related to this vulnerability in the following categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>CPU exhaustion. Reading the extra headers cause increased CPU usage, it results in slowness responding to other requests but in many cases it was just a matter of number of active HTTP/2 connections that are required to completely block the server from responding.</li>
<li>Out Of Memory crash using multiple connections. Headers from <code>CONTINUATION</code> frames are stored in memory but there is a headers list size limit. At the same time there is no headers timeout. This means that an attacker can send headers up to the limit and just wait. Each connection occupies memory indefinietly.</li>
<li>Out Of Memory crash using a <strong>single</strong> connection. Some implementations simply kept reading headers into memory until memory was full which forced the OS to kill the process.</li>
<li>Crash after a <strong>few frames sent</strong>. This is a special, most severe category. Just a few frames are required to crash the server because of implementation bugs when a connection is disconnected mid-<code>CONTINUATION</code> stream.</li>
</ul>
<p>No <code>END_HEADERS</code> flag means that a request is not properly closed. Requests of malicious client would not be saved to access log making this attack hard to debug: in many cases analyzing raw traffic bytes would be necessary to understand the nature of this vulnerability.</p>
<p>In next sections I will demonstrate cases above using real vulnerabilities found in production code.</p>
<h2 id="cpu-exhaustion-golang-case">CPU exhaustion: Golang case</h2>
<p>Golang was an example of the CPU exhaustion caused by <code>CONTINUATION</code> Flood. As many other implementations, Golang devs built an abstraction class called <code>http2MetaHeadersFrame</code> which encapsulates one <code>HEADERS</code> frame and zero or more <code>CONTINUATION</code> frames, and their HPACK decoder. Headers data is processed within a single call to <code>readMetaFrame</code> (<code>h2_bundle.go</code> from Go 1.21.3).</p>
<p>The HPACK decoder in Golang has multiple params and modes. One of them is <code>SetEmitEnabled</code> which enables or disables emitting of decoded headers. This is done to stop headers emission in case of errors or when the header size limit is reached.</p>

<p>The vulnerability may not be clear at the first sight: the decoder is properly configured to stop emitting headers once limit is reached. However, it will still decode headers written to it, just without emiting them. Given that the <em>feeding loop</em> above can only be stopped by <code>END_HEADERS</code> flag or an error from <code>ReadFrame</code> an attacker fully controls how long the HPACK decoder will receive new bytes. With no <code>END_HEADERS</code>, this function will never return and HPACK will keep decoding headers as long as the attacker sends them.</p>
<h2 id="out-of-memory---http-2-ruby-gem-case--">Out of Memory<!-- raw HTML omitted --></h2>
<p>Out of Memory are probably the most boring yet severe cases. There is nothing special about it: no strange logic, no interesting race condition and so on. The implementations that allow OOM simply did not limit the size of headers list built using <code>CONTINUATION</code> frames. Implementations without header timeout required just a single HTTP/2 connection to crash the server.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>In implementations with idle timeout it was often possible to send multiple HTTP/2 connections that occupied portions of RAM very close to the allowed per-connection limit and then sending the last <code>CONTINUATION</code> frame byte-by-byte every few seconds to keep the connection alive.</p>

</code></pre><p>After several retries I correlated this crash to the exact moment when my HTTP/2 client disconnects from the Node.js server. This made sense because the <code>assert()</code> call was inside the <code>Http2Session</code> destructor. Let’s take a look at the code (Node.js v21.5.0):</p>

</span></span><span><span>535</span><span><span>}</span></span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Node.js is embedding <a href="https://nghttp2.org/">nghttp2</a> library for HTTP/2 connections handling. <code>current_nghttp2_memory_</code> is used to track memory allocated by nghttp2 internals and the assertion in the destructor simply ensures that all nghttp2 artifacts are properly removed from memory which happens in <code>reset</code> method (line 533). The value is updated: increased and decreased in several places in the code, often in a nghttp2 callback functions.</p>
<p>There was no other option than to check nghttp2 internals and see who is to blame: Node.js by incorrectly calculating the memory usage, or nghttp2 by giving invalid data used in calculations. After quite a long investigation I couldn’t find anything wrong with calculations which pointed to a possibility of a race condition: <code>current_nghttp2_memory_</code> value was updated elsewhere, at the same time when <code>~Http2Session</code> was being executed.</p>
<p>I found an instance of this case: <code>reset()</code> and nghttp2 callback when <code>CONTINUATION</code> frame is parsed are executed together. When <code>CONTINUATION</code> frame arrives the following chain on events occur when state machine is in <a href="https://github.com/nghttp2/nghttp2/blob/48168eacdb7815375747cd01b886d65a5c4e0931/lib/nghttp2_session.c#L6892"><code>NGHTTP2_IB_EXPECT_CONTINUATION</code> state</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>we go the happy path so state is changed to <code>NGHTTP2_IB_READ_HEADER_BLOCK</code>, from there it calls:</li>
<li><code>session_after_header_block_received</code> which calls:</li>
<li><code>session_call_on_frame_received</code> which calls:</li>
<li><code>on_frame_recv_callback</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The last one calls <code>OnFrameReceive</code> callback in Node.js and later: <code>HandleHeadersFrame</code> which does some memory counter update:
</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="cpp"><span><span>1454</span><span>  <span>DecrementCurrentSessionMemory</span><span>(</span><span>stream</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>current_headers_length_</span><span>);</span>
</span></span><span><span>1455</span><span>  <span>stream</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>current_headers_length_</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span></span></span></code></pre></div>

</span></span><span><span>749</span><span>  <span>}</span></span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Now, when <code>HandleHeadersFrame</code> and <code>Http2Session::~Http2Session()</code> are executed at the same time it’s possible that they will update the <code>current_session_memory_</code> variable at the same time:</p>
<p><code>Http2Session::~Http2Session()</code>

</span></span></span><span><span>533</span><span><span></span><span>session_</span><span>.</span><span>reset</span><span>();</span></span></span></code></pre></div>
<code>DecrementCurrentSessionMemory</code>:

<p>This is why <code>CHECK_EQ</code> fails as <code>current_nghttp2_memory_</code> value is negative.</p>
<h2 id="comparison-to-previous-http2-vulnerabilities">Comparison to previous HTTP/2 vulnerabilities</h2>
<p>There were a couple of HTTP/2 vulnerabilities in the past. In 2019, a batch of them was reported by Netflix and Google. They are listed in CERT/CC Vulnerability Note <a href="https://kb.cert.org/vuls/id/605641/">VU#605641</a> and the most similar are:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>CVE-2019-9516, also known as 0-Length Headers Leak</p>
<p>The attacker sends a stream of headers with a 0-length header name and 0-length header value, optionally Huffman encoded into 1-byte or greater headers. Some implementations allocate memory for these headers and keep the allocation alive until the session dies. This can consume excess memory, potentially leading to a denial of service.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><code>CONTINUATION</code> Flood is different than CVE-2019-9516 because rather than sending empty headers, an attacker sends many random headers up to the frame size limit configured by the server.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>CVE-2019-9518, also known as Empty Frame Flooding</p>
<p>The attacker sends a stream of frames with an empty payload and without the end-of-stream flag. These frames can be DATA, HEADERS, CONTINUATION and/or PUSH_PROMISE. The peer spends time processing each frame disproportionate to attack bandwidth. This can consume excess CPU, potentially leading to a denial of service.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>CVE-2019-9518 is about sending empty frames. The <code>CONTINUATION</code> Flood consists of the largest possible frames that occupy memory and consume CPU cycles while being decoded.</p>
<p>In October 2023 the details of “Rapid Reset”, a zero day in HTTP/2 protocol, were published and the vulnerability was immedietly dubbed <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/identity-security/google-cloud-mitigated-largest-ddos-attack-peaking-above-398-million-rps">“the largest DDoS attack to date”</a>. The details of this attack are explained in Cloudflare’s <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/technical-breakdown-http2-rapid-reset-ddos-attack">article</a>, and while the severity of this vulnerability is different across many implementations, I think it’s important to list main points explaining why the new vulnerability seems to be more severe:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rapid Reset used a combination of <code>HEADERS</code> (with <code>END_STREAM</code> and <code>END_HEADERS</code> flags set) and <code>RST_STREAM</code> frames which means that standard mitigations like rate limiting could at least limit the damage. Also, the server admin would see a lot of inbound server requests and be alerted. <strong>During <code>CONTINUATION</code> Flood attack not a single request is made (no <code>END_HEADERS</code> flag)! Admins do not see any requests in the logs!</strong></li>
<li>In many implementations <strong>just one</strong> TCP connection was enough to crash the server (and in some cases with a very small amount of data sent) during the <code>CONTINUATION</code> Flood attack. On contrary, Rapid Reset was used in DDoS attacks (in most cases using a botnet was required for an attack to be successful).</li>
</ul>

<p>According to <a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/adoption-and-usage">Cloudflare Radar</a> the HTTP/2 traffic accounts for around 60% of all human HTTP traffic (data excluding bots):</p>
<p><img src="https://nowotarski.info/cf_radar_http2.png" alt="HTTP/2 distribution stats"></p>
<p>Given that Cloudflare Radar estimates HTTP traffic data above 70% of all internet transfer and significance of affected projects I believe that we can assume that large part of internet was affected by an easy-to-exploit vulnerability: in many cases just a single TCP connection was enough to crash the server. Don’t forget that HTTP runs not only websites but significant portion of APIs (RESTful APIs). Availability issues with important business and government APIs and websites could incur losses of millions of dollar. Or cause chaos, for example: Poland, the main supplier of heavy weapons to Ukraine which also operates the most important military hub near Ukraine border, <a href="https://www.euronews.com/2024/03/06/poland-experiences-increase-in-ddos-attacks-from-russia">experiences increase in DDoS attacks</a> originating from Russia.</p>
<p><img src="https://nowotarski.info/cf_radar_traffic.png" alt="HTTP/2 in total traffic"></p>
<p>Had it been exploited in the wild, this would have been very hard to debug without proper HTTP/2 knowledge by the server administrators. This is due to the fact that none of malicious HTTP requests connected to this vulnerability is properly closed. The requests would not be visible in the server access logs and due to lack of advanced frame analytics in most of HTTP/2 servers this would have to be handled by manual, tedious raw connection data analysis.</p>
<p><strong>This vulnerability class posed a significant risk to the internet safety!</strong> Because of this I am glad that <a href="https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/">CERT/CC</a> decided to open a Vulnerability Coordination case to track this issue after I reported it in January 2024. Working on a responsible disclosure of this vulnerability with technology giants and open source projects was a great experience. It would be impossible to check so many implementations by a single resesearcher so Vulnerability Coordination is irreplaceable tool for handling issues that affect multiple vendors. Other than opening the case, CERT/CC decided to publish a <a href="https://kb.cert.org/vuls/id/421644">Vulnerability Note</a> about this issue, which is quite rare: only a few notes are published each year. Thank you to Christopher Cullen for handling the issue on CERT/CC side.</p>

<div><h3>The “Great American” Criteria</h3>
<p>Key to the process of defining the preferred route of the Great American Rail-Trail with states and trail partners was confirming a route across the country that would provide the highest-quality experience for all types of trail users—from long-distance cyclists and runners to casual daily explorers and everyone in between. Trail criteria were developed to ensure the Great American Rail-Trail would provide safe, nonmotorized travel on a route that is entirely walkable and bikeable. These trail criteria specify that:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Great America Rail-Trail be one contiguous route that is reasonably direct between Washington, D.C., and Washington State, and across each of the states it traverses.</li>
<li>It will be separated from vehicle traffic—a minimum of 80 percent initially and ultimately entirely separated when the trail is complete.</li>
<li>It will comprise existing trails to the extent possible and will represent trail priorities of the states and local jurisdictions that will host it.</li>
<li>It will follow the most feasible route with regards to topography, geography and political priorities.</li>
<li>It will serve as a catalyst for local economic development, including providing services for long-distance travelers.</li>
</ul>

<p>The Great American Rail-Trail is a trail for everyone—separated from vehicle traffic, with gentle grades and an unparalleled experience. Key to the process of defining the preferred route of the Great American Rail-Trail was confirming a route across the country that would provide the highest-quality experience for all types of trail users—from long-distance cyclists and runners to casual daily explorers and everyone in between.</p>



<p>RTC worked in close partnership with dozens of state agency representatives and hundreds of trail partners from across the country to assess and define the preferred route for the Great American to ensure a contiguous and reasonably direct route as well as one that complemented state priorities. This is America’s trail, and it is the trail of each of the states that will call it home.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody"><p>After almost three years since the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FM4fQmIhEqPG8uGp5o9A-mnPB5BOeScZYpkHjo0KKA8/edit?usp=sharing">initial design document</a> and <a href="https://github.com/search?q=repo%3Av8%2Fv8+%5Bsandbox%5D&amp;type=commits&amp;s=committer-date&amp;o=desc">hundreds of CLs</a> in the meantime, the V8 Sandbox — a lightweight, in-process sandbox for V8 — has now progressed to the point where it is no longer considered an experimental security feature. Starting today, the <a href="https://g.co/chrome/vrp/#v8-sandbox-bypass-rewards">V8 Sandbox is included in Chrome's Vulnerability Reward Program</a> (VRP). While there are still a number of issues to resolve before it becomes a strong security boundary, the VRP inclusion is an important step in that direction. Chrome 123 could therefore be considered to be a sort of "beta" release for the sandbox. This blog post uses this opportunity to discuss the motivation behind the sandbox, show how it prevents memory corruption in V8 from spreading within the host process, and ultimately explain why it is a necessary step towards memory safety.</p><h2 id="motivation" tabindex="-1">Motivation <a href="#motivation">#</a></h2><p>Memory safety remains a relevant problem: all Chrome exploits <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lkNJ0uQwbeC1ZTRrxdtuPLCIl7mlUreoKfSIgajnSyY/edit?usp=sharing">caught in the wild in the last three years</a> (2021 – 2023) started out with a memory corruption vulnerability in a Chrome renderer process that was exploited for remote code execution (RCE). Of these, 60% were vulnerabilities in V8. However, there is a catch: V8 vulnerabilities are rarely "classic" memory corruption bugs (use-after-frees, out-of-bounds accesses, etc.) but instead subtle logic issues which can in turn be exploited to corrupt memory. As such, existing memory safety solutions are, for the most part, not applicable to V8. In particular, neither <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/case-memory-safe-roadmaps">switching to a memory safe language</a>, such as Rust, nor using current or future hardware memory safety features, such as <a href="https://newsroom.arm.com/memory-safety-arm-memory-tagging-extension">memory tagging</a>, can help with the security challenges faced by V8 today.</p><p>To understand why, consider a highly simplified, hypothetical JavaScript engine vulnerability: the implementation of <code>JSArray::fizzbuzz()</code>, which replaces values in the array that are divisible by 3 with "fizz", divisible by 5 with "buzz", and divisible by both 3 and 5 with "fizzbuzz". Below is an implementation of that function in C++. <code>JSArray::buffer_</code> can be thought of as a <code>JSValue*</code>, that is, a pointer to an array of JavaScript values, and <code>JSArray::length_</code> contains the current size of that buffer.</p><pre><code> <span>1.</span> <span>for</span> <span>(</span><span>int</span> index <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span> index <span>&lt;</span> length_<span>;</span> index<span>++</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span><br> <span>2.</span>     JSValue js_value <span>=</span> buffer_<span>[</span>index<span>]</span><span>;</span><br> <span>3.</span>     <span>int</span> value <span>=</span> <span>ToNumber</span><span>(</span>js_value<span>)</span><span>.</span><span>int_value</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><br> <span>4.</span>     <span>if</span> <span>(</span>value <span>%</span> <span>15</span> <span>==</span> <span>0</span><span>)</span><br> <span>5.</span>         buffer_<span>[</span>index<span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>JSString</span><span>(</span><span>"fizzbuzz"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><br> <span>6.</span>     <span>else</span> <span>if</span> <span>(</span>value <span>%</span> <span>5</span> <span>==</span> <span>0</span><span>)</span><br> <span>7.</span>         buffer_<span>[</span>index<span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>JSString</span><span>(</span><span>"buzz"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><br> <span>8.</span>     <span>else</span> <span>if</span> <span>(</span>value <span>%</span> <span>3</span> <span>==</span> <span>0</span><span>)</span><br> <span>9.</span>         buffer_<span>[</span>index<span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>JSString</span><span>(</span><span>"fizz"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><br><span>10.</span> <span>}</span></code></pre><p>Seems simple enough? However, there's a somewhat subtle bug here: the <code>ToNumber</code> conversion in line 3 can have side effects as it may invoke user-defined JavaScript callbacks. Such a callback could then shrink the array, thereby causing an out-of-bounds write afterwards. The following JavaScript code would likely cause memory corruption:</p><pre><code><span>let</span> array <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>Array</span><span>(</span><span>100</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><br><span>let</span> evil <span>=</span> <span>{</span> <span>[</span>Symbol<span>.</span>toPrimitive<span>]</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span> array<span>.</span>length <span>=</span> <span>1</span><span>;</span> <span>return</span> <span>15</span><span>;</span> <span>}</span> <span>}</span><span>;</span><br>array<span>.</span><span>push</span><span>(</span>evil<span>)</span><span>;</span><br><span>// At index 100, the @@toPrimitive callback of |evil| is invoked in</span><br><span>// line 3 above, shrinking the array to length 1 and reallocating its</span><br><span>// backing buffer. The subsequent write (line 5) goes out-of-bounds.</span><br>array<span>.</span><span>fizzbuzz</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></code></pre><p>Note that this vulnerability could occur both in hand-written runtime code (as in the example above) or in machine code generated at runtime by an optimizing just-in-time (JIT) compiler (if the function was implemented in JavaScript instead). In the former case, the programmer would conclude that an explicit bounds-check for the store operations is not necessary as that index has just been accessed. In the latter case, it would be the compiler drawing the same incorrect conclusion during one of its optimization passes (for example <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial-redundancy_elimination">redundancy elimination</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bounds-checking_elimination">bounds-check elimination)</a> because it doesn't model the side effects of <code>ToNumber()</code> correctly.</p><p>While this is an artificially simple bug (this specific bug pattern has become mostly extinct by now due to improvements in fuzzers, developer awareness, and researcher attention), it is still useful to understand why vulnerabilities in modern JavaScript engines are difficult to mitigate in a generic way. Consider the approach of using a memory safe language such as Rust, where it is the compiler's responsibility to guarantee memory safety. In the above example, a memory safe language would likely prevent this bug in the hand-written runtime code used by the interpreter. However, it would <em>not</em> prevent the bug in any just-in-time compiler as the bug there would be a logic issue, not a "classic" memory corruption vulnerability. Only the code generated by the compiler would actually cause any memory corruption. Fundamentally, the issue is that <em>memory safety cannot be guaranteed by the compiler if a compiler is directly part of the attack surface</em>.</p><p>Similarly, disabling the JIT compilers would also only be a partial solution: historically, roughly half of the bugs discovered and exploited in V8 affected one of its compilers while the rest were in other components such as runtime functions, the interpreter, the garbage collector, or the parser. Using a memory-safe language for these components and removing JIT compilers could work, but would significantly reduce the engine's performance (ranging, depending on the type of workload, from 1.5–10× or more for computationally intensive tasks).</p><p>Now consider instead popular hardware security mechanisms, in particular <a href="https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2023/08/mte-as-implemented-part-1.html">memory tagging</a>. There are a number of reasons why memory tagging would similarly not be an effective solution. For example, CPU side channels, which can <a href="https://security.googleblog.com/2021/03/a-spectre-proof-of-concept-for-spectre.html">easily be exploited from JavaScript</a>, could be abused to leak tag values, thereby allowing an attacker to bypass the mitigation. Furthermore, due to <a href="https://v8.dev/blog/pointer-compression">pointer compression</a>, there is currently no space for the tag bits in V8's pointers. As such, the entire heap region would have to be tagged with the same tag, making it impossible to detect inter-object corruption. As such, while memory tagging <a href="https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2023/08/mte-as-implemented-part-2-mitigation.html">can be very effective on certain attack surfaces</a>, it is unlikely to represent much of a hurdle for attackers in the case of JavaScript engines.</p><p>In summary, modern JavaScript engines tend to contain complex, 2nd-order logic bugs which provide powerful exploitation primitives. These cannot be effectively protected by the same techniques used for typical memory-corruption vulnerabilities. However, nearly all vulnerabilities found and exploited in V8 today have one thing in common: the eventual memory corruption necessarily happens inside the V8 heap because the compiler and runtime (almost) exclusively operate on V8 <code>HeapObject</code> instances. This is where the sandbox comes into play.</p><h2 id="the-v8-(heap)-sandbox" tabindex="-1">The V8 (Heap) Sandbox <a href="#the-v8-(heap)-sandbox">#</a></h2><p>The basic idea behind the sandbox is to isolate V8's (heap) memory such that any memory corruption there cannot "spread" to other parts of the process' memory.</p><p>As a motivating example for the sandbox design, consider the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_space_and_kernel_space">separation of user- and kernel space</a> in modern operating systems. Historically, all applications and the operating system's kernel would share the same (physical) memory address space. As such, any memory error in a user application could bring down the whole system by, for example, corrupting kernel memory. On the other hand, in a modern operating system, each userland application has its own dedicated (virtual) address space. As such, any memory error is limited to the application itself, and the rest of the system is protected. In other words, a faulty application can crash itself but not affect the rest of the system. Similarly, the V8 Sandbox attempts to isolate the untrusted JavaScript/WebAssembly code executed by V8 such that a bug in V8 does not affect the rest of the hosting process.</p><p>In principle, <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/12MsaG6BYRB-jQWNkZiuM3bY8X2B2cAsCMLLdgErvK4c/edit?usp=sharing">the sandbox could be implemented with hardware support</a>: similar to the userland-kernel split, V8 would execute some mode-switching instruction when entering or leaving sandboxed code, which would cause the CPU to be unable to access out-of-sandbox memory. In practice, no suitable hardware feature is available today, and the current sandbox is therefore implemented purely in software.</p><p>The basic idea behind the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FM4fQmIhEqPG8uGp5o9A-mnPB5BOeScZYpkHjo0KKA8/edit?usp=sharing">software-based sandbox</a> is to replace all data types that can access out-of-sandbox memory with "sandbox-compatible" alternatives. In particular, all pointers (both to objects on the V8 heap or elsewhere in memory) and 64-bit sizes must be removed as an attacker could corrupt them to subsequently access other memory in the process. This implies that memory regions such as the stack cannot be inside the sandbox as they must contain pointers (for example return addresses) due to hardware and OS constraints. As such, with the software-based sandbox, only the V8 heap is inside the sandbox, and the overall construction is therefore not unlike the <a href="https://webassembly.org/docs/security/">sandboxing model used by WebAssembly</a>.</p><p>To understand how this works in practice, it is useful to look at the steps an exploit has to perform after corrupting memory. The goal of an RCE exploit would typically be to perform a privilege escalation attack, for example by executing shellcode or performing a return-oriented programming (ROP)-style attack. For either of these, the exploit will first want the ability to read and write arbitrary memory in the process, for example to then corrupt a function pointer or place a ROP-payload somewhere in memory and pivot to it. Given a bug that corrupts memory on the V8 heap, an attacker would therefore look for an object such as the following:</p><pre><code><span>class</span> <span>JSArrayBuffer</span><span>:</span> <span><span>public</span> <span>JSObject</span></span> <span>{</span><br>  <span>private</span><span>:</span><br>    byte<span>*</span> buffer_<span>;</span><br>    size_t size_<span>;</span><br><span>}</span><span>;</span></code></pre><p>Given this, the attacker would then either corrupt the buffer pointer or the size value to construct an arbitrary read/write primitive. This is the step that the sandbox aims to prevent. In particular, with the sandbox enabled, and assuming that the referenced buffer is located inside the sandbox, the above object would now become:</p><pre><code><span>class</span> <span>JSArrayBuffer</span><span>:</span> <span><span>public</span> <span>JSObject</span></span> <span>{</span><br>  <span>private</span><span>:</span><br>    sandbox_ptr_t buffer_<span>;</span><br>    sandbox_size_t size_<span>;</span><br><span>}</span><span>;</span></code></pre><p>Where <code>sandbox_ptr_t</code> is a 40-bit offset (in the case of a 1TB sandbox) from the base of the sandbox. Similarly, <code>sandbox_size_t</code> is a "sandbox-compatible" size, <a href="https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:v8/include/v8-internal.h;l=231;drc=5bdda7d5edcac16b698026b78c0eec6d179d3573">currently limited to 32GB</a>.<br>Alternatively, if the referenced buffer was located outside of the sandbox, the object would instead become:</p><pre><code><span>class</span> <span>JSArrayBuffer</span><span>:</span> <span><span>public</span> <span>JSObject</span></span> <span>{</span><br>  <span>private</span><span>:</span><br>    external_ptr_t buffer_<span>;</span><br><span>}</span><span>;</span></code></pre><p>Here, an <code>external_ptr_t</code> references the buffer (and its size) through a pointer table indirection (not unlike the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_descriptor">file descriptor table of a unix kernel</a> or a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/WebAssembly/JavaScript_interface/Table">WebAssembly.Table</a>) which provides memory safety guarantees.</p><p>In both cases, an attacker would find themselves unable to "reach out" of the sandbox into other parts of the address space. Instead, they would first need an additional vulnerability: a V8 Sandbox bypass. The following image summarizes the high-level design, and the interested reader can find more technical details about the sandbox in the design documents linked from <a href="https://chromium.googlesource.com/v8/v8.git/+/refs/heads/main/src/sandbox/README.md"><code>src/sandbox/README.md</code></a>.</p><figure><img alt="" height="458" loading="lazy" src="https://v8.dev/_img/sandbox/sandbox.svg" width="567"><figcaption>A high-level diagram of the sandbox design</figcaption></figure><p>Solely converting pointers and sizes to a different representation is not quite sufficient in an application as complex as V8 and there are <a href="https://issues.chromium.org/hotlists/4802478">a number of other issues</a> that need to be fixed. For example, with the introduction of the sandbox, code such as the following suddenly becomes problematic:</p><pre><code>std<span>::</span>vector<span>&lt;</span>std<span>::</span>string<span>&gt;</span> <span>JSObject</span><span>::</span><span>GetPropertyNames</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span><br>    <span>int</span> num_properties <span>=</span> <span>TotalNumberOfProperties</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><br>    std<span>::</span>vector<span>&lt;</span>std<span>::</span>string<span>&gt;</span> <span>properties</span><span>(</span>num_properties<span>)</span><span>;</span><p>    <span>for</span> <span>(</span><span>int</span> i <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span> i <span>&lt;</span> <span>NumberOfInObjectProperties</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span> i<span>++</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span><br>        properties<span>[</span>i<span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>GetNameOfInObjectProperty</span><span>(</span>i<span>)</span><span>;</span><br>    <span>}</span></p><p>    <span>// Deal with the other types of properties</span><br>    <span>// ...</span></p></code></pre><p>This code makes the (reasonable) assumption that the number of properties stored directly in a JSObject must be less than the total number of properties of that object. However, assuming these numbers are simply stored as integers somewhere in the JSObject, an attacker could corrupt one of them to break this invariant. Subsequently, the access into the (out-of-sandbox) <code>std::vector</code> would go out of bounds. Adding an explicit bounds check, for example with an <a href="https://chromium.googlesource.com/v8/v8.git/+/0deeaf5f593b98d6a6a2bb64e3f71d39314c727c"><code>SBXCHECK</code></a>, would fix this.</p><p>Encouragingly, nearly all "sandbox violations" discovered so far are like this: trivial (1st order) memory corruption bugs such as use-after-frees or out-of-bounds accesses due to lack of a bounds check. Contrary to the 2nd order vulnerabilities typically found in V8, these sandbox bugs could actually be prevented or mitigated by the approaches discussed earlier. In fact, the particular bug above would already be mitigated today due to <a href="http://issues.chromium.org/issues/40228527">Chrome's libc++ hardening</a>. As such, the hope is that in the long run, the sandbox becomes a <strong>more defensible security boundary</strong> than V8 itself. While the currently available data set of sandbox bugs is very limited, the VRP integration launching today will hopefully help produce a clearer picture of the type of vulnerabilities encountered on the sandbox attack surface.</p><h2 id="performance" tabindex="-1">Performance <a href="#performance">#</a></h2><p>One major advantage of this approach is that it is fundamentally cheap: the overhead caused by the sandbox comes mostly from the pointer table indirection for external objects (costing roughly one additional memory load) and to a lesser extent from the use of offsets instead of raw pointers (costing mostly just a shift+add operation, which is very cheap). The current overhead of the sandbox is therefore only around 1% or less on typical workloads (measured using the <a href="https://browserbench.org/Speedometer3.0/">Speedometer</a> and <a href="https://browserbench.org/JetStream/">JetStream</a> benchmark suites). This allows the V8 Sandbox to be enabled by default on compatible platforms.</p><h2 id="testing" tabindex="-1">Testing <a href="#testing">#</a></h2><p>A desirable feature for any security boundary is testability: the ability to manually and automatically test that the promised security guarantees actually hold in practice. This requires a clear attacker model, a way to "emulate" an attacker, and ideally a way of automatically determining when the security boundary has failed. The V8 Sandbox fulfills all of these requirements:</p><ol><li><strong>A clear attacker model:</strong> it is assumed that an attacker can read and write arbitrarily inside the V8 Sandbox. The goal is to prevent memory corruption outside of the sandbox.</li><li><strong>A way to emulate an attacker:</strong> V8 provides a "memory corruption API" when built with the <code>v8_enable_memory_corruption_api = true</code> flag. This emulates the primitives obtained from typical V8 vulnerabilities and in particular provides full read- and write access inside the sandbox.</li><li><strong>A way to detect "sandbox violations":</strong> V8 provides a "sandbox testing" mode (enabled via either <code>--sandbox-testing</code> or <code>--sandbox-fuzzing</code>) which installs a <a href="https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:v8/src/sandbox/testing.cc;l=425;drc=97b7d0066254778f766214d247b65d01f8a81ebb">signal handler</a> that determines if a signal such as <code>SIGSEGV</code> represents a violation of the sandbox's security guarantees.</li></ol><p>Ultimately, this allows the sandbox to be integrated into Chrome's VRP program and be fuzzed by specialized fuzzers.</p><h2 id="usage" tabindex="-1">Usage <a href="#usage">#</a></h2><p>The V8 Sandbox must be enabled/disabled at build time using the <code>v8_enable_sandbox</code> build flag. It is (for technical reasons) not possible to enable/disable the sandbox at runtime. The V8 Sandbox requires a 64-bit system as it needs to reserve a large amount of virtual address space, currently one terabyte.</p><p>The V8 Sandbox has already been enabled by default on 64-bit (specifically x64 and arm64) versions of Chrome on Android, ChromeOS, Linux, macOS, and Windows for roughly the last two years. Even though the sandbox was (and still is) not feature complete, this was mainly done to ensure that it does not cause stability issues and to collect real-world performance statistics. Consequently, recent V8 exploits already had to work their way past the sandbox, providing helpful early feedback on its security properties.</p><h2 id="conclusion" tabindex="-1">Conclusion <a href="#conclusion">#</a></h2><p>The V8 Sandbox is a new security mechanism designed to prevent memory corruption in V8 from impacting other memory in the process. The sandbox is motivated by the fact that current memory safety technologies are largely inapplicable to optimizing JavaScript engines. While these technologies fail to prevent memory corruption in V8 itself, they can in fact protect the V8 Sandbox attack surface. The sandbox is therefore a necessary step towards memory safety.</p></div></div>]]></description>

    <p><img src="https://hforsten.com/img/pulsed/fmcw_vs_pulsed_radar.svg" width="70%/"></p><p>FMCW and pulse radar architectures.</p>
</div>

<p>I have <a href="https://hforsten.com/third-version-of-homemade-6-ghz-fmcw-radar.html">previously made several FMCW radars</a> that
have worked well. FMCW (Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave) radar is quite easy
and cheap to make. It uses separate transmit and receive antennas, which avoids
the need for switching between receiving and transmitting. It mixes the received
signal with the transmitted signal, resulting in a low output frequency, making it
possible to use low-speed analog-to-digital converter (ADC). However, big,
serious radars typically aren't FMCW radars, instead they are pulse radars.
Switching one antenna between transmit and receive modes allows them to use just
one antenna. When an antenna diameter is measured in meters it matters a lot how
many are needed. Pulse radar can use large transmit power without worrying about
saturating the receiver, which is a big issue with FMCW radar. Pulse radar is
also better for measuring velocity of fast-moving targets as it can transmit
pulses more frequently, resulting in larger maximum unambiguous Doppler shift
it can measure.</p>
<p>For these reasons, FMCW radars are usually used in short range applications such as
automotive radars and aircraft altimeters, while pulse radars are used mainly
for long-range applications such as weather radars, aircraft detection, and
synthetic aperture radar imaging from aircraft or satellite.</p>
<p>Pulse radar is much more difficult to design than FMCW radar. To share one
antenna, very fast switching between transmit and receive is needed. Radar pulses
travel at the speed of light, and for example, if switching from transmit to
receive takes 1 microsecond, all the reflections from targets in 150-meter
distance would be missed during the switching time. Sharing one antenna
causes the radar to have a minimum detection distance, which can be hundreds of
meters which makes it unsuitable for short-range operation.</p>
<p>Another difficulty is that pulse radar requires much faster ADC to capture the
received pulses. FMCW radar mixes transmitted and received waveforms which
results in a low-frequency sine wave for each target at the mixer output, for
short-range operation, it's possible to use ADC sampling frequency of 1 MHz or
even less while using hundreds of MHz of RF bandwidth. Pulse radar requires
much faster ADC, typically fast enough to sample the whole RF bandwidth of the
transmitted pulse. The range resolution of the radar is determined by the RF
bandwidth, and for useful range resolution ADC sampling rate should be hundreds
of MHz or even over 1 GHz. This fast ADCs are very expensive and require
expensive digital electronics to handle all the data.</p>
<p>This article is about my experiences building a modern pulse radar utilizing
fast digital signal processing cheaply.</p>

<p>There are many kinds of pulse radars, and the one I want to make is a pulse
compression radar that supports arbitrary waveforms. Generating only linear
frequency sweeps could be simpler and sufficient for many practical
applications, but it wouldn't be as interesting.</p>
<p>The requirement for arbitrary waveform means that there needs to be
a digital-to-analog converter (DAC) with large enough sampling rate to generate
the transmitted waveform. The receiver also needs an ADC with large enough sample
rate to sample the whole RF bandwidth.</p>
<div id="centered">
    <p><img src="https://hforsten.com/img/pulsed/pulsed_rf_block.svg" width="60%/"></p><p>Radar RF side block diagram.</p>
</div>

<p>Above is the block diagram of the radar. The architecture is very similar to
software-defined radio (SDR) and it could be used as a radio too. The radar has
two time-multiplexed receiver antennas with transmitter being shared with one of
them. I added the second receiver channel mainly because it was very cheap, it
only requires additional switch, LNA and SMA connector. The second receiver
channel makes it possible to use the radar also in FMCW mode.</p>
<p>In a proper radar system some filtering would be useful at both transmitter and
receiver, but I left it out here to save money.</p>
<div id="centered">
    <p><img src="https://hforsten.com/img/pulsed/zero_and_nonzero_if_transmitter.svg" width="90%/"></p><p>Superheterodyne and zero-IF (direct conversion)
    transmitters. Superheterodyne mixing to IF frequency is done digitally.</p>
</div>

<p>TX and RX are zero-IF architecture. This is not ideal from a performance point
of view but it's the cheapest option. The output of all mixers contains not only
the desired frequency-shifted signal but also local oscillator (LO) leakage and
image signals, which is the same signal as the desired one but mixed at the
opposite side of the LO frequency. If DAC generated the signal at offset
frequency it would be possible to filter out the unwanted frequencies at the
mixer output with a bandpass filter, but with zero-IF transmitter these unwanted
frequencies overlap the signal, making it impossible to filter them out with
a fixed filter.</p>
<p>Similarly, these same nonidealities are also present at the receiver. These
nonidealities cause distortion of the received waveform, leading to increased
range sidelobes for each target.</p>
<p>While superheterodyne architecture would provide better performance,
implementing it would require more hardware and my goal is to make a working
system with minimal budget. With zero-IF architecture many of the nonidealities
can be compensated sufficiently digitally. Predistorting the DAC output signal
can compensate for the mixer nonidealities, resulting in a clean output signal.
Receiver output signal can also similarly be modified digitally to remove many
of the nonidealities if they can be characterized to sufficient precision.</p>

    domain and instantenous frequency.</p>
</div>

<p>The DAC outputs a <a href="http://whiteboard.ping.se/SDR/IQ">complex IQ signal</a> that is
modulated by the IQ mixer to the LO frequency and transmitted by the antenna,
transmit/receive switch is then switched to receive and reflected signal is
sampled by the receiver. Each target reflects some of the transmitted signal and
the reflected signal is a sum of the signals from each target.</p>
<p>Complex IQ format allows representing both positive and negative frequencies at
the baseband. At the transmitter IQ modulator the I and Q signals are mixed
against LO and 90 degree phase shifted LO and summed. The result is
that positive baseband frequencies are shifted above the LO frequency and
negative frequencies at baseband below the LO frequency.</p>

    correlating with the reference signal the power from pulse is
    concentrated.</p>
</div>

<p>To get the target locations convolution is calculated against the transmitted
signal. At the time instance where there was a target the received
and transmitted signals correlate and convolution results is large, when there
isn't a signal there isn't a correlation and convolution result is small. In
practice the convolution is calculated using fast Fourier transform (FFT) as
that is faster in practice than calculating the convolution in time domain.</p>
<p>In the above plot sidelobes can be seen around the two targets in the result.
These result from the convolution output not being completely zero when the
waveform isn't aligned. Multiplying the reference pulse by a windowing function
can be used to control the sidelobes of the convolution output. Windowing
function can also be applied to the transmitted pulse to further decrease the
sidelobes. Drawback of windowing is that it widens the mainlobe and results in
slightly worse range resolution. How much sidelobes are traded for resolution
can be controlled by the used windowing function.</p>

    FFT.</p>
</div>

<p>Besides the distance to the target, radar can also measure velocity of the
target from how phase of the received signal changes during many measurements.
By sending a burst of pulses and calculating FFT over the number of pulses
dimension, the targets are separated both in velocity and range in the resulting
range-Doppler map.</p>
<p>Velocity could be also measured from change of distance, but the beauty of using
phase shift of the received signal is that velocity can be obtained from the
same measurement as the distance, multiple objects at the same range but with
different velocities can be separated, and the measurement accuracy is much
better. Detecting multiple objects at the same range with different velocity
is important for separating moving objects from stationary objects such as
ground, trees, and buildings that can have a large reflected signal that would
otherwise mask a small moving object.</p>
<p>Measuring angle of the target would also be possible with multiple antennas, but
in this case with one antenna there isn't angle information.</p>

<div id="centered">
    <p><img src="https://hforsten.com/img/pulsed/xadcs.png.pagespeed.ic.hvJUWZ1TvY.png" width="60%/"></p><p>2 channel LVDS interface ADCs with &gt;10 bits, sample rate vs price from Digikey.</p>
</div>

<p>ADC sample rate is one of the most important parameters for the system as it
determines the maximum RF bandwidth that the system can receive. ADC sample rate
should be as fast as is affordable. In general, it's much easier to make the RF
side and DAC to have greater bandwidth than ADC, and it's ADC bandwidth that
limits the system.</p>
<p>The requirement for ADC is having at least two channels, this is required for
IQ sampling, and LVDS output interface. Two one-channel ADCs could also be used
but it's disadvantageous from PCB area and routing perspective. The fastest ADCs
usually have JESD204B digital interface, the problem with it that it requires
high-end FPGA with high-speed serial transceivers and those are in general too
expensive for my budget. LVDS is the highest speed interface that can be
connected to regular FPGA I/O pins.</p>
<p>In the above plot are all 2 channel ADC with LVDS interface and at least 10
bits. The best sample rate for price is
<a href="https://www.ti.com/product/ADS4229">ADS4229</a> with 250 MHz sample rate for 58
EUR / piece in single quantity. Even higher ADC sample rate would be very
desirable, but any higher sample rate than this would get much more expensive.
There is one two channel 8-bit ADC with 500 MHz sample rate for 73 EUR
/ piece, but it has 20 dB lower SNR than the 12-bit ADC and doubling the sample
rate would only give back 3 dB SNR. Low bit ADC would decrease the dynamic range
of the receiver making it more prone to saturation, and it would require more
gain before the ADC, so I decided against using it despite the higher sample rate.</p>
<p>Suitable DACs are easier to find, and I chose to use
<a href="https://www.ti.com/product/DAC3174">DAC3174</a> two-channel 14-bit 500 MHz DAC
costing 33 EUR / piece. While the system bandwidth is limited by the ADC, it's
useful to have more than enough bandwidth on the DAC to make filtering easier.</p>
<h3 id="adc-filter">ADC filter</h3>
<p>ADC requires anti-aliasing filter before it to limit the signal frequency to
below half of sample rate (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nyquist_rate">Nyquist rate</a>) to avoid aliasing. To get the largest usable bandwidth
the cutoff frequency of the anti-aliasing low-pass filters should be as close as
possible to the Nyquist rate, but this makes implementation of the filter
difficult as it needs to have very sharp cutoff.</p>
<p>Filter should also have equal amplitude and group delay on the passband.
Amplitude requirement is easy to understand, we don't want to have different
frequencies attenuated different amounts. Group delay measures how much
different frequencies are delayed by the filter. If the group delay difference
is too large for different frequencies, the received pulse is distorted by the
filter decreasing its correlation to the reference pulse. In practice, this
shows up as higher sidelobes.</p>
<div id="centered">
    <p><img src="https://hforsten.com/img/pulsed/xadc_lowpass_sim.png.pagespeed.ic.6PdegRt1M2.png" width="80%/"></p><p>ADC lowpass simulation setup.</p>
</div>

<p>Source impedance of the IQ demodulator is 50 ohms differential. ADC input is also
differential, and its impedance varies with frequency having high impedance at
lower frequencies, but at higher frequencies the input capacitance is
significant. ADC datasheet provides a model for the ADC input which I added to
the simulation setup. It suggests adding a resistor at the input that sets
the input impedance, series resistors to limit ringing due to bond wires and
additional resistor and capacitor across inputs to filter sampling glitches.
While adding a 50 ohm resistor across the ADC input would be good for filter
design perspective it attenuates the signal too much as there already isn't
enough gain in the receiver and the IQ demodulator linearity decreases with low
output impedance. I added instead 200 ohm resistor to minimize the signal
attenuation. This makes the filter design challenging, as the high
load impedance requires using small capacitors and large inductors. Higher
impedance also increases the effect of sampling glitches, which are caused by
ADC input sampling capacitors rapidly sampling the input signal. Adding IF
amplifier would have made the filter design easier.</p>
<p>100 nF series capacitors decouple the DC levels of IQ demodulator and ADC.
While it would be good to have DC coupled signals, the DC levels of IQ
demodulator and ADC are different and any significantly different DC levels
would limit the maximum AC signal range.</p>
<div id="centered">
    <p><img src="https://hforsten.com/img/pulsed/adc_lowpass_f.svg" width="70%/"></p><p>Simulated frequency response of the ADC lowpass
    filter. Nyquist frequency marked with vertical line.</p>
</div>

<p>The cutoff frequency of the filter is set at 100 MHz and there should be -20 dB
attenuation at the Nyquist frequency of 125 MHz. Up to about 60 MHz both
magnitude and group delay are very good, above that it could be better but its
hard to improve with these constraints. There is some variation in the passband
magnitude that would have been smaller with 50 ohm impedance. Group delay is
relatively good at medium frequencies, at very low frequencies AC coupling
capacitor causes the delay to shoot up and near the cutoff frequency there is
a peak in the delay. The filter response can be compensated digitally if its
a problem.</p>
<h3 id="dac-anti-alias-filter">DAC anti-alias filter</h3>
<div id="centered">
    <p><img src="https://hforsten.com/img/pulsed/dac_lowpass_f.svg" width="70%/"></p><p>Simulated frequency response of the DAC lowpass
    filter. Nyquist frequency marked with vertical line.</p>
</div>

<p>Digital-to-analog converter is also a sampled system, and it has unwanted aliases
at the output that need to be filtered out. The sample rate of DAC is 500 MHz
which compared to required signal bandwidth of 100 MHz makes the filter design
much easier. The alias frequencies are in the range 400 to 500 MHz for 0 to 100
MHz signal.</p>
<p>The filter is designed to have flat magnitude and group delay below 100 MHz and
in the simulator both look very good. Cutoff frequency is just above 100 MHz so
that the peak in group delay is above 100 MHz. The aliases are much further away
in frequency than with the ADC, and they are attenuated at least 65 dB more than
the signal. This amount of attenuation is more than enough for the DAC aliases
to not cause any issues, but it does mean that they are visible at the RF
output.  If the signal power is 30 dBm, then the image signal is about -35 dBm.
For proper radar the attenuation likely should be higher to avoid radiating
power at other than the allocated frequency band.</p>
<h2 id="fpga">FPGA</h2>
<div id="centered">
    <p><img src="https://hforsten.com/img/pulsed/xzynq-mp-core-dual.png.pagespeed.ic.n5a6bvGZR3.png" width="40%/"></p><p>Xilinx Zynq FPGA block diagram. The chip has
    two-core ARM CPU and programmable logic with fast interconnect between them.</p>
</div>

<p>Using just a microcontroller isn't possible for this application. FPGA is
required for accurate timing of pulse generation and for managing the ADC and
DAC data. Accurate timing of pulse generation is critical for proper operation.
Switching between transmit and receive needs to be done quickly and accurately,
any timing error in pulse triggering or in the receiver will be visible as large
distance error.</p>
<p>Pricing of the FPGAs is very bizarre. Looking at Digikey or other resellers many
of the suitable parts have prices starting in hundreds of dollars and
better ones can cost several thousand. However, the exact same parts can be
found for fraction of price from China. For some reason, Zynq 7020 is one of the
cheapest Zynq FPGAs in China available at $17, while the exact same part from
Digikey costs $173.</p>
<p>Zynq 7020 has dual-core ARM-A9 CPU and typical FPGA programmable logic in the
same package. Having also a CPU core is useful as it can handle communication to
PC. It can also run Linux and I added SD-card for Linux file system if I want to
use it, but initially software is running without any operating system.</p>
<h2 id="digital-design">Digital design</h2>
<div id="centered">
    <p><img src="https://hforsten.com/img/pulsed/pulsed_digital_block.svg" width="60%/"></p><p>Block diagram of digital interfaces.</p>
</div>

<p>With fast ADC and DAC moving a lot of data, it's important to consider whether the
system can keep up. In the above block diagram, digital interfaces between
important blocks have been drawn. The FPGA SoC consists of two parts: processing
system (PS), which is dual-core ARM A9 CPU, and programmable logic (PL), which is
programmable FPGA fabric. They are connected to each other through with four 
64-bit <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_eXtensible_Interface">AXI</a> buses.
Their clock frequency is configurable and, in this case, it's set to 130 MHz
which is near the upper limit that it can work. One AXI bus is reserved for ADC
Direct Memory Access (DMA) and other for DAC DMA, there's also a third, lower
speed AXI bus (not drawn in the diagram) for configuring the registers in the
programmable logic.</p>
<p>A fast connection to the PC is needed to quickly transfer captured ADC samples.
Initially, the digital processing will be done on PC, but it should be
possible to do it on FPGA too for some applications. If the interface to PC is
much slower than the ADC data generation rate, it limits how often the radar can be
triggered. For target tracking, this means slower update rate of target
positions.</p>
<p>1 Gbps Ethernet is the fastest interface to PC that can be easily connected to
this FPGA chip. USB 3 is another possible choice, offering 5 Gbps speed with
easy connection to PC, but it would require an external USB 3 transceiver chip
and more effort to make it work.</p>
<p>The system has a single DDR3 DRAM chip that is connected to the PS side of the FPGA.
While the memory chip could be clocked faster, the memory interface speed is
limited by the FPGA memory controller to 1066 MHz. Memory bus width is 16-bits. 
The memory controller supports up to 32-bits, but it would require adding a second
DDR3 chip and the higher bandwidth is not necessary in this system.</p>
<p>ADC samples are received by the PL side, which has a small FIFO buffer and DMA
controller transfer them to DRAM through the PL side. DAC also has its own DMA
channel, but DMA uses only one AXI bus limiting it to 8.3 Gbps, which is less
than what the DAC needs. It's also important to note that DDR3 bandwidth is less
than the sum of the DAC and ADC bandwidths, making streaming DAC samples from
DRAM while storing ADC samples at the same time impossible. For this reason,
there is a small 1 MB memory on the PL side that stores DAC samples. Pulse samples
are transferred from PC to DRAM through Ethernet, then DMA transfers them to the
small memory on the PL where they are transferred to the DAC every pulse.</p>
<p>A small DAC memory limits the pulse length to 130 µs, but it's plenty for pulse
radar. A 130 µs pulse corresponds to 20 km minimum detection distance, and
typical pulse length is about 1 µs. The pulse could also be generated on PL,
eliminating the need for memory, but lookup table implementation makes it easier
to change pulse parameters such as windowing function, pre-distortion, and test
different types of pulse waveforms.</p>
<h2 id="rf-design">RF design</h2>
<div id="centered">
    <p><img src="https://hforsten.com/img/pulsed/xpulsed_pcb_3d_rf.jpg.pagespeed.ic.H6GSk5i7Xa.jpg" width="60%/"></p><p>RF parts take only a small portion of
    the PCB area. It's also a small amount of required work on the project
    although it seems like it should be the important part.</p>
</div>

<p>With the digital parts out of the way it's time to look at the RF side.
Designing the RF parts is relatively straight forward. Similar to my previous
radars, the operating frequency will be around 6 GHz. This is the highest
frequency with many off-the-shelf cheap components due to many consumer
applications.</p>
<p>RF part consists of: IQ modulator, IQ demodulator, PLL for generating the LO
frequency, power amplifier, low noise amplifiers and switches.</p>
<p>IQ modulator should have low LO leakage, high image rejection, enough output
power to drive PA without needing another amplifier, and baseband voltage level
compatible with the DAC output voltage range. There aren't that many
possible commercial chip alternatives and most of them are very similar in
performance. Same applies also to the IQ demodulator.</p>
<p>Choosing a power amplifier was more difficult. While big, expensive radars often
have transmit power measured in kW or even MW, but that's unrealistic in this
case.  I would like to have at least 1 W peak RF power but there are
surprisingly few choices at 6 GHz band despite WLAN applications
that require power amplifiers. The best suitable amplifier I found was <a href="https://www.skyworksinc.com/Products/Amplifiers/SE5004L">Skyworks
SE5004L</a>, which has
2 W typical output 1 dB compression point and high gain of 32 dB, but its
documentation is severely lacking. There isn't any graph of gain vs frequency
and it requires some external components, but there aren't any values for them in
the datasheet. The solution for external components is found in the SE5004L-EK1
evaluation kit documentation, which has the schematic of the evaluation board of
this chip. It's also out of stock at the moment at common resellers although
it's available at some Chinese resellers. In the end I did decide to go with it
because there aren't many other cheap alternatives with enough output power.</p>
<p>Switching speed of the T/R switch is very important, and it should have high
enough power handling capability to handle the 1 W power amplifier output
without blowing up or distorting the signal. Especially the fast switching speed
is a though requirement that rules out many options. I ended up choosing
<a href="https://cdn.macom.com/datasheets/MASW-007588.pdf">MASW-007588</a> switch that has
55 ns switching speed and 37 dBm 1 dB compression point. While 55 nanoseconds is fast,
in that time light travels 16.5 meters. There are better switches specifically
made for this kind of applications, but they are too expensive for my budget.</p>
<p>Another option would be to use circulator instead of switch. This is
common for higher power radars as circulators can handle hundreds of Watts of
power, and there is no switching speed. There are some circulators for this
frequency, but big issue with them is that they are very large and much more
expensive than simple switch.</p>
<p>The receiver should have enough amplification that the RF noise floor is above
the ADC quantization noise floor. The RF noise floor spectrum at the ADC input
can be calculated as <span>\(kT\)</span>, where <span>\(k\)</span> is the Boltzmann constant and <span>\(T\)</span> is
temperature in Kelvin. This results in power density of about -174 dBm/Hz at
room temperature.</p>
<p>LNA amplifies the thermal noise and adds some noise to it which is determined by
LNA's noise figure. Switches and PCB lines have some losses. IQ demodulator's
voltage conversion gain can be used to calculate the output voltage density at
the ADC input.</p>
<p>ADC noise floor can be calculated from SNR specification, 69.4 dBFs (decibels
relative to full scale) in this case, sample rate 250 MHz, and maximum input
voltage 2 V peak-to-peak (0.707 Vrms). Noise is then 69.4 dB below 0.707 Vrms
maximum input voltage for each sample, and there are 250 million samples in one
second which equals bandwidth of one Hertz. This gives the ADC noise floor
density of -156 dBV/Hz.</p>
<p>Calculating the RF noise floor at the ADC input after considering the whole
signal chain from starting from LNA gives noise floor of about -155 dBV/Hz. This
is barely not enough gain. RF noise floor should be much higher than the ADC
noise floor, typically about 10 dB, so that the ADC quantization noise doesn't
increase the noise of the whole receiver. An ADC driver amplifier could easily have
enough gain, but low-frequency amplifiers with high enough bandwidth are
surprisingly expensive. In the end, I just decided to have few dB higher noise
floor.</p>
<h2 id="maximum-detection-range">Maximum detection range</h2>
<p>The maximum detection range of the radar can be calculated as following:</p>
<p>The transmitter transmits a pulse of length <span>\(t_s\)</span> with average power of <span>\(P_t\)</span>,
which is radiated by the transmitter antenna with gain <span>\(G\)</span>.
The power density (<span>\(W/m^2\)</span>) at distance <span>\(r\)</span> can be written using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friis_transmission_equation">Friis'
equation</a> as <span>\(P_t G
/ (4 \pi r^2)\)</span>. This power is reflected by a target with a radar cross-section of
<span>\(\sigma\)</span> and some of it is reflected back to the radar. The received power depends
on the effective area of the receiving antenna: <span>\(P_r = P_t G A_e / ((4\pi
r^2)^2)\)</span>. <span>\(A_e\)</span> can be written in terms of the antenna gain as <span>\(A_e = \lambda^2
G / 4 \pi\)</span>, where <span>\(\lambda\)</span> is the wavelength of the RF signal. The equation for
the received power at the receiver input can be written as:</p>
<p>$$P_r = \frac{P_t G^2 \lambda^2 \sigma}{(4\pi)^3 r^4}$$</p>
<p>This is the received power from one pulse. To increase the received power, multiple
received pulses can be coherently summed. It's important that the summation is
coherent so that the phases of the received pulses are aligned. In practice,
instead of summing, an FFT is used so that power from moving targets can be
coherently summed and separated from each other.</p>
<p>To get the maximum detection range, we need to find the minimum
detectable received power. The detection performance is limited by the noise of
the receiver. Thermal noise density (W/Hz) of the receiver is <span>\(kT\)</span>, where <span>\(k\)</span> is
the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnson%E2%80%93Nyquist_noise#Derivation">Boltzmann constant</a> and
<span>\(T\)</span> is the receiver temperature in Kelvin. The receiver amplifies this thermal
noise and adds its own noise to it. The noise factor, <span>\(F\)</span>, of the receiver is
how much higher the noise floor of the output is compared to theoretical thermal
noise floor if there wouldn't be any added noise. This can be calculated from
the receiver gain, RF amplifier's noise figure and ADC's noise floor.</p>
<p>To get the noise floor, we need to multiply the thermal noise density <span>\(kT\)</span> by the
receiver noise factor <span>\(F\)</span> and the receiver's noise bandwidth <span>\(B\)</span>. The correct
noise bandwidth to use is the minimum bandwidth after all the signal processing
which noise can't be separated from the signal. For example, by taking the Fourier
transform of the input signal, we can discard all the frequency bins that are
beyond where our signal is, and noise at those discarded frequencies won't
affect the detection capabilities of the receiver. Pulse compression ideally
collects all of the power of a pulse within a bandwidth of <span>\(1/t_s\)</span> for a linear
frequency sweep. However, in practice, FFT windowing functions and any mismatch
between reference and received pulses will decrease this slightly.</p>
<p>The minimum detectable signal should be higher than the noise floor by some
margin. The threshold value for detections can be chosen freely, but there is
a trade-off: if we accept detections that are only just above the noise floor,
occasionally some of them may be false detections resulting from noise
just happening to be above the detection threshold. The probability of false alarm
depends on the method used to estimate the signal-to-noise ratio of the
detection. For an ideal detector, the false alarm probability can be calculated
based on the probability that normally distributed noise is above the detection
threshold. Common threshold value is usually around 13 to 15 dB.</p>
<p>At the maximum detection distance the received power is equal to minimum
detectable signal:</p>
<p>$$\frac{n P_t G^2 \lambda^2 \sigma}{(4\pi)^3 r^4} = \frac{kTFS}{t_s}$$</p>
<p>,where <span>\(n\)</span> is the number of pulses, and <span>\(S\)</span> is the detection threshold compared
to the noise floor. Solving for <span>\(r\)</span> gives the maximum detection range:</p>
<p>$$r_{\text{max}} = \sqrt[4]{\frac{n t_s P_t G^2 \lambda^2 \sigma}{(4\pi)^3 kTFS}}$$</p>

<p>In the above table are estimations of the radar system parameters. Plugging
these values in the equation gives a maximum detection distance for target with
1 <span>\(m^2\)</span> radar cross-section of 1200 meters. This might be slightly
optimistic, as there are losses in the cables to antennas, loss from antenna
efficiency, losses from mismatch, and atmosphere attenuation. However, the
maximum detection distance should still be about 1 km. At this maximum distance
the average received power from a target is equal to the minimum detection
threshold. Therefore, on average, a target at this distance is detected 50% of
the time. Due to normally distributed noise, there is a chance that a target at
shorter distance is not detected, and a target at longer distance could be
detected. However, because of the fourth power dependence of the received power,
the probability of detection drops quickly at larger distances.</p>

</div>

<p>Practical implementation of the system requires designing a printed circuit
board (PCB) that integrates all the components. The system has both RF and
high-speed digital circuits that require careful PCB routing to make sure that
they function correctly.</p>
<p>The PCB has six layers, and I don't think the FPGA can be routed with any less 
layers. The material is standard FR-4, which isn't ideal for RF routing since it's
quite lossy, but it isn't a big issue in this case since the RF trace length is
kept very short.</p>
<h2 id="ddr3-routing">DDR3 routing</h2>

</div>

<p>DDR3 DRAM memory connected to the PS side of the FPGA runs at 533 MHz clock
frequency with two transfer per clock cycle. The memory uses the DDR3L standard,
which is a low-voltage version of the DDR3 standard with a 1.35 V operating
voltage instead of the normal DDR3 1.5 V supply voltage. While this isn't very
fast by the modern standards, it still requires some care with the routing.
Memory traces should be length matched, have correct characteristic impedance,
and be terminated properly to minimize reflections.</p>
<p>The nominal characteristic impedance of DDR3 traces is 40 ohms. A shared address
bus is fly-by routed to all memory chips and terminated with a 40 ohm resistor
to VTT supply, which is at half of the memory supply voltage. Each memory chip
has its own data traces with on-chip termination. There are also few control
lines that are routed to all memory chips. With only one memory chip on the PCB,
the routing is much simpler.</p>
<p>The memory bus can be simulated with circuit simulators before being
manufactured. Professional programs have ways to do finite element simulation of
the PCB, but this is quite difficult with open source software. FPGA and memory
chip driver and receiver electrical models are provided as
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Input/output_Buffer_Information_Specification">IBIS</a>
files. I used <a href="https://www.kicad.org/">KiCad</a> to design the PCB and it's
supposed to include IBIS support but it was unclear how to use it. I ended up
using
<a href="http://www.spisim.com/products/free-apps/spisim_ibis-a-free-web-app-for-simulating-ibis-using-free-simulators/">SPISim_IBIS</a>
web app to convert the IBIS models to SPICE netlists and simulate them with <a href="https://ngspice.sourceforge.io/">ngspice</a>.</p>

</div>

<p>I was interested in simulating if address bus termination resistors can be left
out in this case where there is only one memory chip, and it's mounted close to
the FPGA. I have seen this done on at least one FPGA development board, and it
would save some PCB space if termination resistors could be left out.</p>

</div>

<p>Normally, an eye diagram is used to analyze the timing margin of the memory bus.
However, it's not easy to simulate it with ngspice, so I just added a pulse
source and did a transient simulation plotting the voltage at the memory chip
input. With 120 ps line delay, 40 ohm line impedance, and termination resistance
the memory chip input voltage looks fine. High and low thresholds are 0.81 and
0.54 V according to the memory chip datasheet, and the signal looks very good in
the simulator.</p>
<div id="centered">
    <p><img src="https://hforsten.com/img/pulsed/ddr3_no_term.svg" width="50%/"></p><p>DDR3 databus without termination resistors.</p>
</div>

<p>Without termination resistors, the voltage looks fine from the threshold level
point of view. However, there is significant under and overshoot. Supply
voltages are 0 V and 1.35 V, and the memory chip input voltage overshoots by about
0.7 V, which is enough to forward bias the ESD (Electrostatic discharge)
protection diodes of the memory chip. This might be fine in practice, but memory
chip datasheet says that the overshoot should be limited to maximum of 0.4 V.
For this reason, I added the address line termination resistors.</p>
<div id="centered">
    <p><img src="https://hforsten.com/img/pulsed/ddr3_term_60.svg" width="50%/"></p><p>DDR3 databus with 60 ohm line and 50 ohm
    termination resistors.</p>
</div>

<p>While removing the termination resistors violates the datasheet guarantees, it's
possible in this case to use 60 ohm line impedance and 50 ohm termination
resistors with minimal difference in the signal integrity. The benefit of using
higher line impedance is that it results in narrower line on PCB allowing for
denser layout. A 40 ohm trace is 0.24 mm wide, while 60 ohm trace is 0.10 mm wide.
Using narrower trace also allows having more distance between different traces,
which decreases cross-talk between traces. 50 ohm termination resistor is
close enough to the trace impedance, and since 50 ohms resistors are needed on
other places on the PCB, using 50 ohm resistor allows removing one resistor
value from the bill of materials, making the assembly slightly cheaper.</p>

    the termination resistors on the left. Top left is the top layer and bottom
    right is the bottom one advancing horizontally.</p>
</div>

<p>Above is the final DDR3 routing on all the PCB layers. Layers 2 and 6 are
ground, 5 is supply voltage, and others are reserved for signals. Two grounds are
needed for correct impedances on the top, middle, and bottom traces of the PCB.
With only one ground plane, the distance from the signal to ground would be too
large on either the top or bottom layer. Data bus traces are swapped within the byte
boundary to make the routing easier. The traces are length-matched with squiggly
lines, and some traces are manually drawn on the ground and supply layers to
decrease the size of slots in the planes due to vias. The trace matching
requirement is ±10 ps according to the Zynq PCB design guide, which is
approximately ±2mm in trace length. However, considering the faster memory chip
and having only one memory chip, the actual margin should be much greater. There
is also some delay difference inside the FPGA package which should be considered
in the length matching.</p>
<h2 id="transmission-line-termination">Transmission line termination</h2>
<p>The T/R switch needs to be switched as fast as possible to minimize dead time
between transmit and receive, and the same applies for the IQ modulator enable pin.
The FPGA I/O pin driver strength can be controlled, and with the highest drive
strength it has a rise time of about 400 ps at the switch input in simulator.
However, few centimeters of PCB trace between the FPGA and switch input functions as
a transmission line, which has significant effect at these frequencies.</p>
<p>The switch input pin is not matched to 50 ohms, and a typical CMOS input has
high input impedance. This causes reflections, which severely distorts the
switching waveform.</p>
<div id="centered">
    <p><img src="https://hforsten.com/img/pulsed/switch_termination_sch.svg" width="50%/"></p><p>Termination of switch input with capacitor and
    resistor.</p>
</div>

<p>To minimize reflections, the transmission line should be terminated to the
characteristic impedance of the transmission line, which is 50 ohms in this
case. Placing a 50 ohm resistor to ground near the switch input pin would
work, but it would sink DC current and cause the DC voltage to drop. Termination
to supply voltage has a similar issue except that now voltage can't reach 0 V.</p>
<p>Termination with a 50 ohm resistor in series with a small capacitor solves the DC
level issue. Capacitor value should be tuned so that high-frequency reflections
are absorbed without affecting the low frequencies too much.</p>

<p>Above is the simulated voltage at the switch input. Transmission line length was
300 ps, and termination capacitor was set to 12 pF. Without termination there is
significant over and undershoot, and a risk that the voltage drops below the
threshold voltage slowing the switching. With the termination, the waveform is much
cleaner.</p>
<h2 id="power-supply">Power supply</h2>
<p>Analog electronic components are sensitive to supply voltage noise. This is
especially important for RF receiver with input signal at the level of the
thermal noise floor.</p>
<p>Switching regulators have good efficiency, often around 90%, but their output has
switching noise that is significantly higher than the thermal noise floor. If
this noise isn't filtered properly, it will couple into the received and
transmitted waveforms and cause interference at the receiver. A linear regulator,
often called low-dropout regulator (LDO) for historical reasons, functions as 
a variable resistor, dissipating enough power to ensure that the output voltage
is at the correct level. The output noise is much lower, but if the voltage drop is
too large the efficiency is terrible.</p>
<div id="centered">
    <p><img src="https://hforsten.com/img/pulsed/xldo_psrr.png.pagespeed.ic.-BDKH1ixK2.png" width="50%/"></p><p>Power supply rejection rate (PSRR) of TPS7A7001 LDO.</p>
</div>

<p>To have both good efficiency and low noise, it's common to have a switching
regulator followed by an LDO to filter the switching noise. However, this
isn't enough filtering in this case. LDO filters well very low
frequencies, but it's filtering capability drops at the higher frequencies.
Above is the power supply rejection ratio (PSRR) of the LDO I'm using. For
example, with a 1 mV amplitude, 2.5 MHz signal at the LDO input is attenuated by
about 15 dB, resulting in about 200 µV amplitude signal at the output.</p>
<p>The requirement for minimum power supply filtering can be obtained with few
assumptions about the coupling of the noise. The smallest signal level is at the
input of the receiver LNA. The thermal noise floor is -174 dBm/Hz at room
temperature. With a 10 ms measurement time, the bandwidth is 100 Hz. This
results in a maximum of -154 dBm power at the LNA input. At 50 ohm impedance,
this corresponds to 5 nV RMS voltage. If the LNA supply voltage is modulated by
noise, it affects the gain of the amplifier, and the supply voltage noise is
mixed to the RF signal. In practice, the allowed noise amplitude can be
larger since there is usually some power supply rejection at the LNA for
low-frequency supply voltage noise to the output RF frequency, but it's usually
not specified in the datasheet. With a 10 mV worst-case switching noise amplitude,
the required attenuation is 120 dB to reach the noise floor. LDO can be assumed
to filter about 10 dB, and we can assume another 10 dB power supply rejection
from the RF components, which sets the power supply filtering requirement to 100
dB.</p>

    parasitics drawn individually.</p>
</div>

<p>The required power supply filter can be designed with ferrite beads. They are
inductors that are lossy at high frequencies. A capacitor is needed after the
ferrite bead to complete the low-pass filter. The series resistance and
inductance of the capacitor are crucial at these frequencies, and they are
included in the schematic, assuming an SMD ceramic capacitor.</p>
<div id="centered">
    <p><img src="https://hforsten.com/img/pulsed/ferrite_sim_f.svg" width="60%/"></p><p>Ferrite bead filter frequency response.</p>
</div>

<p>The above filter achieves 100 dB attenuation at 1 MHz. The switching frequency is
2.5 MHz, and this filter works well at that frequency. However, it has a resonance at 30
kHz, which increases the noise at the output at that frequency. This is caused by
the ferrite bead behaving like an low-loss inductor at low frequencies which resonates
with the capacitor due to a lack of resistance that would dampen the resonance. It
can be fixed in two ways: adding resistance in series with the capacitor or
increasing the capacitance. Resistance could be also added in series with the
ferrite bead, but this is possible only if the DC current is small.</p>

    ferrite bead with 200 µF capacitance. The response is underdamped and
    increasing capacitor ESR would decrease the oscillation.</p>
</div>

<p>An important limitation of the ferrite bead filter is its time domain response. If
the output current changes quickly, the inductance of the ferrite bead tries to
keep the current through it constant, which means that the output capacitor needs
to supply the high-frequency current. If the output capacitor is small, it can't
supply the current, and the output voltage drops. If there isn't enough
resistance either in series with the ferrite bead or in series with the
capacitor, the output voltage oscillates before settling. Especially the power
amplifier that has high current draw needs a lot of capacitance to ensure that
the supply voltage doesn't drop as it's switched on.</p>
<p>The time domain response can be improved by placing the ferrite bead before the
LDO. The LDO is then able to keep the output voltage constant while the input
voltage dips, but it needs to be ensured that the voltage after the ferrite bead
doesn't dip too low so that the LDO stays in regulation. I placed one ferrite
bead before the LDO and a second one before each analog component. The first one
filters the switching noise, and the second ferrite bead adds additional
filtering for each IC. Besides filtering the switching noise, the second ferrite
bead for each IC also improves the isolation between components, which is
desired between transmitter and receiver. Having a ferrite bead close to each
component also reduces the length of the trace that can work as an antenna to
pick up radiated noise.</p>
<p>In total, the PCB has nine different supply voltages. There are six
supplies for FPGA and digital electronics: 1.0 V for FPGA core supply, 1.8 V,
2.5 V, and 3.3 V for various digital chips, 1.35 V and 0.675 V for DDR3 RAM. The
noise on these rails isn't too important for the system performance. Analog
electronics have low-noise 1.8 V, 3.3 V, and 5.0 V rails with linear regulators
and ferrite bead filtering.</p>

    the right side, FPGA out of view on the left side.</p>
</div>

<p>The ADC connects to the FPGA with a 12-bit wide LVDS bus. The ADC also generates a clock
signal that is center-aligned to the data. The sampling rate of the ADC is 250
MHz, and there are two channels with one channel's data on the rising edge and the other on
the falling edge of the clock. This data rate is too fast for the FPGA to capture
statically, requiring dynamic capture that uses adjustable delay lines to
correct for the signal delay programmatically. These delay lines also make the
length-matching requirement for the PCB routing quite loose.</p>
<p>The DAC also has an LVDS interface but it operates at 500 MHz with 14-bits. This
FPGA doesn't have adjustable output delay lines, so the line lengths must be
length-matched to make sure that the DAC can capture the data. The DAC datasheet
provides setup and hold times for the interface, and plugging these values into
the FPGA synthesizer tool indicates that the timing can be met with ±25 ps trace
delay, which corresponds to about ±4 mm difference in the data trace lengths
compared to the clock trace. Even higher delay might work, but it's good practice
to match the interface as well as possible, especially since it can't be
adjusted in software like the ADC interface.</p>
<p>On the FPGA side, it's important to set the supply voltages for the banks with
LVDS to 2.5 V with this FPGA part. For the receiver, only this voltage works
correctly with internal 100 ohm termination. Using internal 100 ohm
termination instead of external 100 ohm resistors on each data line makes the
routing easier and saves PCB space. The DAC LVDS transmitter also needs a 2.5
V supply voltage for both common mode and differential voltages to be compatible
with what the DAC expects.</p>

<p>The Ethernet interface needs an external PHY chip that is between the Ethernet

which can be found for $1 in single quantities from China. While the RTL8211E version of
the chip is found on many FPGA development boards, the F version is much more
uncommon. The challenge with this chip is that officially the datasheet is
provided only under NDA. However, it is available from the Chinese resellers
with big "Confidential" and "Not for public release" labels. However, the
datasheet isn't quite clear on how it should be connected, and there aren't any
example schematics in it. Searching this chip on Google, I did find few
schematics of boards using it, which gave me some confidence that I can wire it
correctly. See the above schematic on how it should be wired for FPGA if you are
also looking to use it.</p>
<p>Important note about the Zynq FPGA is that the Ethernet interface doesn't meet
the RGMII interface (FPGA to Ethernet chip interface) specifications when used
with 3.3 V supply voltage. Because of this, I had to set the FPGA PS side supply
voltage to 1.8 V, which requires adding level shifters for SD card and UART that

</div>

<p>Accurate timing of the whole system is very important. Several clock signals are
unavoidable since the ADC runs on 250 MHz, the DAC runs at 500 MHz, and the FPGA
requires even lower clock frequency. The FPGA does have several phase-locked
loops that can be used to generate clocks, but accuracy of their output isn't
good enough. For a 100 MHz clock the tools predict a peak-to-peak jitter of 130
ps, while the clock generator chip has about 4 ps peak-to-peak jitter. ADC and
DAC require very clean clocks with minimal jitter, and any timing error on the
sampling clock <a href="https://www.analog.com/en/resources/analog-dialogue/articles/the-easy-steps-to-calculate-sampling-clock-jitter-for-isolated-precision-high-speed-daqs.html">reduces the signal-to-noise
ratio</a>.</p>
<p>Everything involved in the radar signal generation or processing should run on
synchronized clock signals. For example, if the ADC and DAC would run with
completely unrelated clocks, the pulses wouldn't stay synchronized in phase as
the clocks would slightly drift. Phase drift would make coherent summing of
multiple pulses impossible and seriously harm the performance of the radar.</p>
<p>There are two unrelated clocks on the PCB. PS side of the FPGA has its own 33
MHz crystal and it generates clocks for DDR3, CPU, and peripherals from
it. 133 MHz bus clock is also generated from it, which is passed to the programmable
logic side of the FPGA. The PL side uses an external clock generator chip
<a href="https://www.ti.com/product/CDCM6208">CDCM6208</a> to generate several 250 MHz and
500 MHz clocks from a single 25 MHz crystal. These clocks are all phase
synchronized to each other. The PS side's own independent clock
is that on power up the clock generator has not been programmed yet. The PS side
has its own independent clock, which is needed for programming the clock
generator. The independent clock domains of PS and PL don't cause issues
with proper clock domain crossings.</p>
<p>The ADC outputs a 250 MHz clock with the data to the FPGA, which is
internally divided by two and used to clock the pulse timing logic. This
makes the FPGA logic also synchronized to the clock generator. Frequency
division is required because 250 MHz clock is too fast for the FPGA logic. The
clock division makes that for each 125 MHz clock cycle, two ADC samples are received
from both channels for total of 48 bits of data. There is a FIFO for clock
domain crossing to the PS side's 133 MHz, and DMA transfers the samples through
a 64-bit AXI bus to the DDR3 memory. 133 MHz is used because it needs to be faster
than the 125 MHz input clock and this clock needs to be generated by PS so it
can't be the PL 125 MHz clock.</p>
<p>The FPGA needs to output a 500 MHz clock with the data to the DAC, and for this
purpose, a 500 MHz signal is routed to the FPGA. The FPGA has internal clock
generators, but they are not used for this purpose because their jitter is too
high. 500 MHz is too high frequency to route on the global clock network of the
FPGA, but it's possible to route it on the I/O clock network that is only routed
to the I/O buffers. That means no logic can be clocked at 500 MHz, but the chip
has <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SerDes">serdes</a> that can be clocked from the
I/O clock at each pin, which can take four bits at the rising edge of the
250 MHz clock and output them at both rising and falling edges of the 500 MHz
I/O clock.</p>

<p>I ordered the PCB from a Chinese manufacturer, including assembly. They sent me
two assembled pieces and three empty PCBs. Some uncommon components were
not available for assembly, and I had to order those separately and solder them
myself. These included all the most expensive components such as ADC, DAC and
PLL. Luckily, the FPGA was available for assembly, which saved me the trouble of
soldering the large 484-pin BGA package myself.</p>
<p>Quality of the PCB looks good, especially considering the price, which is only
a fraction of what it would have costed me locally. However, only one of the two

them.</p>
<p>The suspiciously cheap $15 FPGA had equally suspiciously date and lot codes
covered (white rectangles on the FPGA chip in the picture above). I have
a development board of the same series chip with markings intact, so it definitely

<p>The first step to bring up the board is to program the FT2232H chip,

</div>

<p>FPGA software consists of ADC and DAC LVDS interfaces, pulse timing that
enables and disables switches, PA, LNAs and other components at the right time,
AXI registers that enable the PS to configure the programmable logic, two DMA
channels for ADC and DAC samples, and SPI interfaces for ADC, DAC, PLL, and clock
generator.</p>
<p>Most of the signal processing is done on the PC, and the FPGA mainly passes the
data around. However, it would be a good idea to have digital filtering and
decimation for the received samples on the FPGA. When the transmitted pulse
bandwidth isn't very large, for example when it isn't centered at zero
frequency, it's possible to do mixing digitally, filter the samples, and reduce
the sample rate. This would enable reducing the amount of data that needs to be
sent to PC and increase the frame rate of the radar.</p>


<p>LVDS receiver is based on Xilinx appnote
<a href="https://docs.xilinx.com/v/u/en-US/xapp1017-lvds-ddr-deserial">xapp1017</a>. It
connects two delay lines and flip-flops to each LVDS lane with delay difference
set so that they sample the signal with 1/2 bit delay. State machine changes the
delays so that the master flip-flop samples at the center of the data eye. The
dynamically adjusted delay is able to compensate for PCB routing and FPGA
internal delay differences.</p>

<p>The pulse timing circuit is just a counter with equality comparisons for each
possible event that can be programmed with AXI registers. The timing circuit is
triggered from the PS side of the FPGA, starting the counter that triggers
every subsystem on the FPGA and every external chip at the exact correct clock
cycle. It also has a loop functionality that can trigger the pulse multiple times
with precise repetition interval to support sending a burst of pulses.</p>
<p>Accurate timing of the burst is essential for accurate target velocity
measurement. Any timing inaccuracy between ADC and DAC transfers to inaccuracy
in the measured distance. A single 125 MHz clock cycle timing error in ADC or
DAC triggering translates to a 1.2 m error in the measured distance.</p>

<p>The length of the recording is 33 ms which is 8 million samples. The noise floor
average is -139 dBFs which is about what it should be. However, there are several
interference signals visible, the biggest are multiples of 25 MHz. Their
amplitude is about -100 dBFs which corresponds to about 15 µV RMS at ADC input,
so they aren't very large. DC offset of the ADC is also visible as very large
peak at zero frequency.</p>
<p>The source of the interferences is fractional spurs caused by the PLL. They can
be changed by changing the PLL output frequency, PLL settings and LO input

<p>The spurs are minimized when PLL output frequency is integer multiple of the PLL

run the PLL phase detector, and it is divided by two by the PLL reference input
divider. With 125 MHz PLL reference clock setting the output frequency to 5.75
GHz makes it integer multiple and almost completely gets rid of the spurs. 5.875
is another close multiple that works well also with RF electronic side. There is
still a spur at -125 MHz, but this is expected as it is the phase detector

<p>Noise floor of the ADC is higher at low frequencies due to 1/f noise of the ADC.

<p>The receiver was set to record 1 µs before and 2 µs after the transmitted

but there is a clear difference between transmitted and received waveforms.</p>

<li>Spike before 1 µs caused by the transmitter being switched on.</li>
<li>Pulse has DC offset caused by the LO leakage from the transmitter, I signal

<li>Higher baseband frequencies are attenuated more causing a slight drop at the edges of the

<p>Above is the plot of the pulse compression output of the non-calibrated pulse
with -50 dB <a href="https://www.mathworks.com/help/signal/ref/taylorwin.html">Taylor
window</a> applied to the
reference pulse normalized to the peak level. The sidelobe level is -21 dBc,
which is far above the ideal level.</p>
<p>The biggest error is caused by the LO leakage from the transmitter. LO leakage
from the transmitter is mixed down to DC at the receiver because they share the
same LO signal. Since DC level of the balanced linear frequency
sweep is non-zero, convolution with the reference sweep gives non-zero result
wherever there is a non-zero LO leakage that causes the flat correlation output
from 0.5 µs to 1.5 µs.</p>
<p>To improve the sidelobe level LO leakage needs to be compensated. It can be done
by adjusting the transmitter waveform so that it has LO signal in opposite phase
that cancels the leakage signal. However, before LO leakage compensation ADC DC
offset should be compensated since received is used to measure the LO leakage
and DC offset of the ADC interferes with it.</p>
<p>DC offset of the ADC is compensated by only triggering the receiver with
transmitter disabled. The only signal at the ADC is thermal noise and DC offset.
DC level can be measured and subtracted from all subsequent measurements.</p>
<p>With ADC DC offset compensated the LO leakage can be measured by triggering the
sweep and outputting only zeros from DAC. Ideally there shouldn't be anything
transmitted, but due to LO leakage there is signal transmitted at LO frequency
which mixes down to DC at the receiver. DC level of the transmitted signal is
adjusted such that the ADC input is zero which results in zero LO leakage.</p>

    compensation.</p>
</div>

<p>With LO leakage compensation the impulse response looks much nicer. Sidelobe
level is -36 dB which is few dB above the ideal -42 dB. There is also a very
long -60 dB straight line after the sweep that is caused by the high pass
behaviour of the AC coupling capacitors between IQ demodulator and ADC.</p>

</div>

<p>The reason for the long flat part is that there is a non-zero DC level after the
sweep. Baseband frequency sweep has non-zero DC component and when it passes
through the high-pass filter it changes the output DC level. Convolution result
of frequency sweep with a constant results in non-zero output.</p>
<p>The issue could be reduced by decreasing the high-pass filter cutoff frequency.
The AC coupling capacitor is only 100 nF which puts the high-pass cutoff
frequency at about 10 kHz. DC offset caused by the high-pass could be also
<a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6755581">compensated digitally</a>.</p>
<p>The decrease in amplitude as frequency increases is quite clear here. <a href="https://www.analog.com/en/resources/technical-articles/equalizing-techniques-flatten-dac-frequency-response.html">DAC sinc
response</a>
is compensated digitally, so that isn't the cause for the amplitude drop. The ADC
filter was supposed to be quite flat in amplitude, but during manufacturing
I had to substitute a different inductor than what I initially chose to use. The
substitute inductor has higher series resistance and amplitude isn't as flat.
I do have the correct inductors, but I haven't replaced them yet.</p>

<p>Other solution for the DC offset issue is modulating the frequency sweep so that
sweep doesn't include zero frequency, essentially using non-zero IF. Above is

</div>

<p>Calculating the pulse compression of the offset sweep gives much cleaner result.
The DC offset issue caused by the high-pass filter is completely removed.
Sidelobe level is still 2 dB higher than ideal but this is already quite nice
looking impulse response. Ideal sidelobes are higher than with 100 MHz sweep
because time-bandwidth product is lower and mainlobe is also widened because of
the lower bandwidth. The disadvantage of the modulated sweep is that maximum usable
bandwidth of the sweep is half of what can be used with a zero centered sweep.</p>

</div>

<p>Sidelobes caused by low time-bandwidth product of the pulse can be reduced with
transmitted pulse windowing. Window function reduces the effective bandwidth of
the transmitted waveform, so it increases the mainlobe width and reduces the
range resolution. Transmitter side windowing also decreases the average energy
per pulse as the waveform is tapered off at the start and end of the pulse which
decreases signal-to-noise ratio. One good windowing function for transmitter
side is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Window_function#Tukey_window">Tukey
window</a>. It just
slightly tapers beginning and end of the waveform with middle being at the
maximum amplitude. Tukey window has a parameter α that can be used to control
how much it windows, with α=0 being equal to no windowing. With α=0.1 the pulse
energy, and the receiver SNR, is decreased by 0.8 dB.</p>

<p>Compared to the same pulse without TX window adding Tukey window to the
transmitter greatly decreases the far-away sidelobes. At 500 ns offset the
sidelobe level has decreased by about 20 dB. The measured sidelobe level is
slightly higher than what it should be ideally.</p>
<p>Receiver and transmitter IQ imbalance isn't yet calibrated and there is some
frequency dependent distortion from the ADC and DAC filters. However, the

</div>

<p>When switching to reception T/R switch is switched from transmitter to receiver.
If PA is kept enabled due to its high gain it has high enough output noise that
even when with attenuation from the switch isolation it's still larger than
the thermal noise floor of the LNA.</p>
<p>T/R switch can be switched in about 50 nanoseconds but enabling and disabling
PA is much slower, it takes about 10 µs. Unfortunately this long PA
switching time means that when using a single antenna the receiver noise is
higher due to leaked PA noise.</p>
<p>If the input to PA is thermal noise of 50 ohm resistor (-174 dBm/Hz) it's
amplified by PAs gain of 32 dB and it adds its own noise to it too. Usually 
amplifiers noise figure would be reported in the datasheet but this PA doesn't
have it listed. PA noise figure can be rather high, 5 - 10 dB wouldn't be too
unusual, as they usually aren't optimized to be particularly low noise. With
these figures the noise floor at the PA output is about -135 dBm/Hz. T/R switch
has limited isolation, exact value for leakage between these ports isn't
reported in the datasheet, but 26 dB is the reported typical isolation to the
antenna port and isolation between the input ports is usually little better.
This means that PA noise at the LNA input is about -165 dBm/Hz which is larger
than the thermal noise floor of -174 dBm/Hz and the PA noise limits the receiver
performance if it's not switched off.</p>
<p>Noise figure of the receiver is about 5 dB, so the measured noise floor with
receiver connected to T/R switch should be about 5 dB higher, instead of
calculated 10 dB with noiseless receiver. Actually measuring the ADC noise floor
with PA on, when the receiver is connected to T/R switch the noise floor is 2.1 dB
higher than when it's connected to the other port. It matches well with the
theory considering the big uncertainties in all of the values.</p>
<p>When using two antennas the second receiver switch can be switched to RX2 and
the LNA on the RX1 can be switched off which improves the isolation sufficiently
that PA leakage doesn't affect the receiver noise.</p>

</div>

<p>To get from ADC samples to target detections some more software is required. In
general the transmitted signal is a burst of pulses and the first step is to
pulse compress each received pulse. After pulse compression the next step is to
take FFT over the number of pulses dimension. This sums the power from the
different pulses according to velocity of the target. This is called
range-Doppler processing and its output is a 2D image with range on one axis and
Doppler velocity on the other. Amplitude of each pixel corresponds to
the amount of power received at that distance and velocity.</p>
<p>After range-Doppler processing the output is a 2D array of the received power
for each range-Doppler bin. To get to target detections we need to identify the
bins where there is a target. We also want to separate interesting
targets such as moving vehicles from non-interesting targets (clutter) such as
sidelobes, trees, ground, and other stationary targets.</p>
<p>The targets in the range-Doppler map could be identified by the amplitude. If
a bin's amplitude is high enough above the noise floor then it likely
corresponds to a real target and is not just noise. The detection threshold, 
how much a target needs to be above the noise floor, needs to be chosen to
balance false alarm rate and missed detections. In general the noise floor power
isn't constant in the range-Doppler map. It can vary as function of time, there
can be sidelobes from other nearby targets and clutter, for example ground
reflections, can also be considered noise since we don't want to detect each
patch of ground as a target. Instead of setting a fixed noise floor it's
estimated by averaging nearby bins. For each pixel in the radar map, noise floor
is calculated by averaging nearby bins and if amplitude of the bin being tested
is larger than threshold times the calculated noise floor then we mark detected
target at that location. This is called CFAR (Constant False Alarm Rate)
algorithm.</p>
<p>For high amplitude targets there are going to be false detections from
sidelobes. After the targets are detected we check if they correspond to
a sidelobe of a larger target and unmark it. This is simply done by checking if
there is a much larger target in same row or column. Target is also required to
have larger amplitude than adjacent bins, this causes only the peak location of
each compressed pulse to be detected.</p>
<p>We now have a list of ranges and velocities for detected targets at the accuracy
of the radar resolution. Range and velocity measurement accuracy can be improved
by interpolating the peak location.</p>

and velocity including uncertainty, and it provides a way to assign each
detection to specific target by considering probabilities that detection is from
that target.</p>
<p>Tracking uses <a href="https://stonesoup.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html">Stonesoup Python
library</a>, which is
a library for general object tracking. Specifically radar tracking is heavily
based on the <a href="https://stonesoup.readthedocs.io/en/latest/auto_tutorials/10_Simulation_%26_Tracking_Components.html#sphx-glr-auto-tutorials-10-simulation-tracking-components-py">StoneSoup
tutorial</a>.
StoneSoup tutorial explains the tracking well, so I won't repeat it too much
here.</p>
<p>The biggest change from the example is that example is for tracking object in 2D
with measurement providing it's 2D position but not velocity. Radar measures
distance and velocity of each target, but there is no angle information so only
1D tracking is possible.</p>
<p>Transition model for the target is set as <a href="https://stonesoup.readthedocs.io/en/latest/stonesoup.models.transition.html#stonesoup.models.transition.linear.ConstantAcceleration">constant
acceleration</a>.
Kalman filter estimates acceleration from the measurements and the next
prediction for the target position is made assuming that acceleration is
constant.</p>

</div>

<p>I tested the radar by setting the radar on a side of a road and measuring
traffic passing by. Pulse length is 2 µs, the bandwidth is 150 MHz, the number of pulses
is 1024, RX length is 5 µs with 7 µs delay before the next pulse. I used two
antennas with separate TX and RX antenna. Antennas are <a href="https://hforsten.com/horn-antenna-for-radar.html">horn antennas that
I made myself</a>.</p>
<p>150 MHz bandwidth corresponds to 1 meter distance resolution. It's important to
note that resolution is not the same as accuracy. Resolution is how close two
point targets can be to be separated in the measurement. One target can be measured
with better accuracy than resolution with accuracy depending on signal-to-noise
ratio.</p>
<p>12 µs time between pulses equals 83 kHz pulse repetition frequency. The pulse
interval determines the maximum unambiguous target velocity. Velocity
measurement is based on measuring phase change between pulses, and if target
moves at high enough speed that it moves several wavelengths between pulses,
there is no way for radar to know what that multiple is, causing the measured
velocity to be ambiguous.</p>
<p>If the target moves half a wavelength between pulses, it causes a full wavelength distance change since the radar pulse goes from the radar to the target and back. At this speed, the phase
increases by a full wavelength at each measurement, which looks identical to if the
target was stationary. If we don't have information on which direction the
target is moving, we also need to consider that a signal increasing 90 degrees in
phase every measurement looks identical to a signal that decreases by 270 degrees
every measurement. The unambiguous velocity measurement range must be divided by
two for negative and positive velocities, resulting in velocity measurement range:</p>
<p>$$v_\text{max} = \frac{\lambda}{4 t_d}$$</p>
<p>,where <span>\(\lambda\)</span> is RF wavelength and <span>\(t_d\)</span> is pulse repetition interval.</p>
<p>With 5.8 GHz RF frequency and 12 µs pulse repetition interval, the unambiguous
velocity measurement range is from -1077 m/s to +1077 m/s. This is over three
times the speed of sound, and there won't be any issues with velocity ambiguities
when measuring cars.</p>
<p>The Doppler velocity resolution is the unambiguous velocity measurement range divided
by the number of pulses, which is 2155 m/s / 1024 = 2.1 m/s in this case. This is the
minimum velocity difference that two targets at the same range need to have to be
detected as two separate targets. As with the distance accuracy, the velocity
measurement accuracy for a single target is better than velocity resolution and
improves with signal-to-noise ratio.</p>

<p>Above is cellphone video synced with a radar range-Doppler map. CFAR
detections are plotted as red plus symbols on the range-Doppler map and 
listed in the order of decreasing SNR on the top right. On the radar image,
Y-axis is the Doppler velocity in m/s with negative values towards the radar,
X-axis is the distance in meters. The large line at the zero Doppler velocity is
reflections from stationary targets.</p>
<p>On the list in the upper right, "frame" is the number of the sweep burst in the
radar measurement file, "t" is the time from the first frame, and "detections" is
the number of CFAR detections. Detections with a velocity less than 0.1 m/s are
filtered out to avoid marking every stationary object as a detection.</p>
<p>Comparing the camera footage to the radar measurements it's easy to correlate
the radar detections to cars in the camera footage for close targets. There is
some shadowing as cars on the foreground block the view of farther away objects,
but the radar is able to detect objects not well visible in the camera footage
quite well. The radar can detect cars up to about 400 m, limited by the
line of sight. Beyond that the road turns and the view is blocked.</p>
<p>The effect of the DC offset is also visible as very large sidelobes in the range
direction. These sidelobes decrease the ability to detect smaller objects near
larger ones. Especially towards the end the farthest away car is not always
detected by the CFAR as its amplitude isn't sufficiently larger than the
sidelobes overlapping it.</p>

</p>

<p>Above is the same measurement, but now with Kalman tracker. The tracker assigns
CFAR detections to targets with unique IDs. It's able to track multiple
targets, but shadowing and sidelobes cause it to not get enough detections
from further away blocked targets, and it loses track of them. The uncertainty
in their position increases so much that the track deletion threshold is
reached. When they become visible again, a new ID is assigned for them. The tracking
software could be improved to reduce this problem, but this is just a testing of
the radar and I don't want to spend too much time tuning it for this application.</p>

</div>

<p>Above is the received signal of all 1024 pulses from one measurement plotted on
the same graph. They overlap very well. There is a small change in the phase
during the measurement for moving objects, which is enough to separate the moving
objects from stationary ones. There is a large return from leakage and nearby
objects at the start, and the received signal from longer time delays that
correspond to farther away targets are much weaker.</p>

</p>

<p>While using a large bandwidth sweep centered at DC works, sidelobes
caused by the high-pass filter are visible in the results. For second test, I set
the RF bandwidth to 75 MHz with 38 MHz modulation frequency so that the
frequency sweeps from 0.5 MHz to 75.5 MHz. Other parameters were kept the same.</p>
<p>This time, as expected, the very wide sidelobes caused by the DC offset aren't
visible. Range resolution is only half of what is was previously, but it doesn't really
cause any issues with tracking of the cars. They are large enough that even with
a 2 meter range resolution, there isn't any issues with separating them.</p>
<p>The frame rate is about only half of what is was before. The amount of data should
be the same, and I'm not really sure why it's so much slower this time?</p>
<p>At the beginning, a second reflection of the passing car is visible at double the
distance and velocity. The radar signal reflects from car, to a sign that is
right next to me, back to car, and then is received by the radar. It's much
weaker in amplitude and its spread out which causes it to not be detected as
a target by CFAR.</p>
<p>In this measurement, there's a cyclist coming towards the radar which is not
detected as a target. The reason for it is that the cyclist's speed isn't large
enough to separate it well enough from the stationary targets. When CFAR target
detection is calculated, all of the nearby stationary targets are included in
the noise floor calculation for low-speed targets. The large noise floor causes
that the small radar cross section of the cyclist isn't sufficiently above the
noise floor to be detected.</p>
<p>For this application, a higher RF frequency would be beneficial. Doubling the RF
frequency would double the Doppler velocity bin separation and decrease the
maximum unambiguous Doppler velocity by two. Common police radar speed guns
operate at around 10 to 35 GHz, although nowadays
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lidar">lidar</a>, which operates near visible light,
is starting to be more common for traffic monitoring.</p>

    <p><img src="https://hforsten.com/img/pulsed/xdetections_snr.png.pagespeed.ic.G2u4VXfwy_.png" width="60%/"></p><p>SNR of detected objects as calculated by CFAR vs distance.</p>
</div>

<p>SNR of the radar detections is quite good at this range. The maximum SNR at 450
m distance is around 35 dB, while just farther away at 550 m there are no
detections. This is because of line of sight, there is no clear path beyond 450
m. Radar SNR should decrease as fourth power of distance, which corresponds to
12 dB drop when the distance is doubled. The radar should be able to detect
traffic at even longer distances if there is a clear line of sight.</p>
<p>From this measurement, it isn't clear if the radar link budget is as good as
designed, since the radar cross-section of the targets isn't known. Even
a typical car cross section can vary a lot depending on the model and the look
angle. The radar link budget could be verified by measuring a target with a known
radar cross section, typically a corner reflector. However, I don't have
a corner reflector. It wouldn't be too difficult to make one with few triangular
pieces of PCB, and it just would require some effort.</p>

    <p><img src="https://hforsten.com/img/pulsed/xfull_rd.png.pagespeed.ic.jOewLOVpzR.png" width="60%/"></p><p>Full range-doppler map.</p>
</div>

<p>The unzoomed range-Doppler map shows how small the view on the videos is on the
Doppler axis. The maximum unambiguous velocity is over 1000 m/s. On the range
direction, negative distances correspond to pulses that arrive before the start
of the transmitted pulse. There shouldn't be any signal there except for
sidelobes from targets at positive distances. The noise floor drops at the edges
of the range direction because of zero padding in pulse compression.</p>
<h2 id="single-antenna">Single antenna</h2>
<p>The previous measurements were made with two antennas, one transmitting and the
other receiving. In the next measurement, I have only one antenna that is switched
between transmit and receive modes. The pulse was set to the same parameters as the
low-IF measurement, except for pulse length, which was decreased from 2 µs to
1 µs to improve detection of close objects.</p>
<p>With one antenna, receiver can only be switched on at the earliest just after
the end of the transmission. 1 µs at the speed of light is equal to 300 meters, but
radar signal needs to travel to the target and back, so minimum distance to
receive the full pulse is 150 meters. However, while it isn't possible to
receive the full pulse from shorter distances, it's possible to receive
a partial pulse. Pulse compression with only a partial pulse reduces distance
resolution and SNR, but it should allow detecting targets at much lower
distances.</p>

</p>

<p>Targets below 150 m distance can be detected but the range resolution worsen
quickly to unusable levels. Minimum range that radar can detect targets with
these settings is about 40 m. In this plot marker is drawn on the tracker
predicted location instead of CFAR detections as before.</p>
<p>The tracker parameters were tuned a little bit for this measurement and the
tracking performance is better than in the earlier measurements.</p>

</div>

<p><a href="https://hforsten.com/img/pulsed/pulsed_schematic.pdf">Schematic</a> of the radar is 
available. It should be useful for also as a software-defined radio with some
modifications or reference for other applications that require FPGA. Firmware
and software isn't available at the moment, since I'm not sure if I should make
those public.</p>
<p>Cost was 330 USD for PCB manufacturing and assembly of two PCBs and additional
225 EUR (240 USD) for components from Digikey that I soldered myself. This is
including 24% VAT and shipping costs. There aren't any similar commercial pulse
compression radars in the same price range and even software defined radios with
similar RF bandwidth are much more expensive.</p>
<p>The designed radar is fundamentally similar to modern large radars. It utilizes
digital signal processing, supports arbitrary waveforms and has very large
maximum unambiguous target Doppler velocity due to high pulse repetition
frequency. Only the maximum range is shorter than large radars due to low output
power and small antenna.</p>

                        <p>A new Washington’s Lottery AI mobile site turned a user’s photo into softcore pornography, forcing them to take the website down “out of an abundance of caution.”</p>
<p>When Megan, a 50-year-old mother based in Tumwater, visited the new AI-powered mobile site from <a href="https://www.walottery.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Washington’s Lottery</a> on March 30, she thought she was in for some frivolous fun. <a href="https://testdriveawin.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Test Drive A Win</a> allows users to digitally throw a dart at a dartboard featuring dream vacations you can pay for with the money you win in the lottery. Depending on where the dart lands, you can either upload a headshot or take one on your phone to upload, and the AI superimposes your image into the vacation spot.</p>
<p>Megan landed on a “swim with the sharks” dream vacation option. She was shocked at one of the AI photos Washington’s Lottery spit out. It was softcore porn.</p>

<h2>How did the the Washington’s Lottery site push out porn?</h2>
<p>Megan says she used the in-site option to take a photo of her face to upload. The photo that was created shows a smiling AI version of Megan, but almost completely nude.</p>
<p>In the image, Megan is sitting on a bed, with a bathing suit bottom on, but no top. Her bare breasts are exposed. The background of the image appears to show the bedroom in an aquarium, with fish swimming around her. There is a Washington’s Lottery logo in the bottom right corner.</p>
<p>“Our tax dollars are paying for that! I was completely shocked. It’s disturbing to say the least,” Megan explained to the Jason Rantz Show on KTTH.</p>
<p>Megan feared that the image could potentially get out and that it would happen to another website visitor. She told a friend, who happens to know someone at Washington’s Lottery, what happened.</p>
<p>“I also think whoever was responsible for it should be fired,” she added.</p>

<h3>Washington’s Lottery pulled the site offline</h3>
<p>It’s unclear how or why AI created this particular image, given the rules governing the content. The Jason Rantz Show on KTTH could not, of course, authenticate the image. However, a spokesperson for Washington’s Lottery confirmed they received a report that the image was created by the AI system.</p>
<p>Approximately three hours after an inquiry by the Jason Rantz Show on KTTH, Washington’s Lottery pulled the site offline. They also provided a statement.</p>
<p>“We were made aware that a single user of the AI platform was purportedly provided an image that did not adhere to the built-in parameters set by the developers. Prior to launch, we agreed to a comprehensive set of rules to govern image creation, including that people in images be fully clothed. We have not seen the image that the AI provided to this user, but out of an abundance of caution we took the website down,” the spokesperson confirmed to the Jason Rantz Show on KTTH.</p>
<p>The spokesperson did not confirm when they first heard of the issue. He also did not explain why Washington’s Lottery waited until after my inquiry before turning the site offline.</p>
<p>Megan is pleased the site has been removed. She says she hopes any back-end settings that need to be adjusted are, in fact, adjusted.</p>
<h3>UPDATE: 4/2/24, 7:38 p.m.</h3>
<p>A spokesman for Washington’s Lottery sent the following statement to the Jason Rantz Show on KTTH Tuesday night:</p>
<blockquote><p>We heard about this earlier this week. As soon as we did, we had the developers check all the parameters for the platform and were comfortable with the settings, but after further internal discussions today, we chose to take down the site out of an abundance of caution, as we don’t want something like this purported event to happen again.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.thenewlede.org/2024/03/us-court-blocks-epa-order-to-eliminate-pfas-in-plastic-containers/">https://www.thenewlede.org/2024/03/us-court-blocks-epa-order-to-eliminate-pfas-in-plastic-containers/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39929310">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

        				<p>A US appeals court has vacated an action by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) &nbsp;ordering a company to stop producing plastic containers that leach toxic per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) into pesticides, household cleaners, condiments, and many other products.</p>
<p>The 5<sup>th</sup> US Circuit Court of Appeals on March 21 <a href="https://peer.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/3_22_24-Fifth-Circuit-Opinion.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ruled</a> that the EPA exceeded its statutory authority when it <a href="https://www.epa.gov/reviewing-new-chemicals-under-toxic-substances-control-act-tsca/epa-orders-issued-inhance" target="_blank" rel="noopener">issued orders</a> to Texas-based Inhance in December prohibiting the company from manufacturing or processing PFAS through its fluorination process for containers.</p>
<p>The EPA move came after the agency determined that types of PFAS created during the fluorination process “are highly toxic and present unreasonable risks that cannot be prevented other than through prohibition of manufacture.”</p>
<p>The agency issued the orders under the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA), which authorizes the EPA to regulate and screen chemicals produced or imported into the US.</p>
<p>But Inhance challenged the EPA’s action, arguing that the EPA improperly sought to take action against the company under a section of TSCA dealing with new uses of chemicals, and that Inhance’s process did not constitute a new use.</p>
<p>The court agreed that the fluorination technique Inhance uses to prevent liquids from leaking out of its plastic containers – a process that creates PFAS chemicals – does not count as a significant new use since Inhance has been using this process since 1983.</p>
<p>The EPA’s interpretation of the law “distorts TSCA’s framework and defies common sense,” the court opinion states. The agency could pursue action against Inhance under a different section of TSCA, but would be required to conduct a cost-benefit analysis of the action, the court stated.</p>
<p>When asked for comment, the EPA said it is reviewing the court’s decision.</p>
<p>Inhance in a <a href="https://www.inhancetechnologies.com/news/fifth-circuit-unanimously-rules-in-favor-of-inhance-technologies" target="_blank" rel="noopener">statement</a> called the court’s decision a “decisive victory” and said that it would avert disruption to “downstream industries” and related supply chain impacts.</p>
<p>The company’s continued use of its PFAS-producing fluorination technique for high-density polyethylene (HDPE) containers is “unconscionable” given that there are safe alternatives, said Kyla Bennett, director of science policy for the watchdog group Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility (PEER).</p>
<p>“I suspect there will be liability lawsuits coming,” she said. “When you have this much PFAS – especially PFOA [perfluorooctanoic acid] – leaching into products, someone is going to sue.”</p>
<p>In February, PEER and the Center for Environmental Health (CEH) <a href="https://www.thenewlede.org/2024/02/epa-is-illegally-concealing-data-about-pfas-in-millions-of-plastic-containers-lawsuit-alleges/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">filed a lawsuit against the EPA</a> claiming that the agency violated TSCA by refusing to provide health and safety data about PFAS chemicals in Inhance’s plastic containers, with the EPA citing “confidential business information.”</p>
<p>There are thousands of PFAS chemicals, which do not break down naturally and contaminate waterways across the US and most Americans’ blood. Studies in both laboratory animals and humans suggest that exposure to some PFAS chemicals can <a href="https://www.epa.gov/superfund/proposed-designation-perfluorooctanoic-acid-pfoa-and-perfluorooctanesulfonic-acid-pfos" target="_blank" rel="noopener">harm various organs and systems in the human body</a>, including the heart, liver, kidneys, and immune system, according to the EPA.</p>
<p>Previous research has demonstrated that PFAS can leach from containers, including a 2023&nbsp;<a href="https://beyondpesticides.org/dailynewsblog/2023/03/pfas-leaches-into-ketchup-mayo-other-common-foods-elevating-health-hazards/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">study</a>&nbsp;by Notre Dame University, which found PFAS in ketchup and mayonnaise, and a 2022 <a href="https://www.thenewlede.org/2022/09/epa-confirms-pfas-leach-from-shipping-containers-into-food-other-products/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">study</a> by the EPA that found eight PFAS chemicals leaching from the walls of shipping containers into their liquid contents.</p>
<p>The mosquito control company Clarke Mosquito has switched to using containers with a non-fluorinated barrier protection for its pesticide. The EPA <a href="https://www.thenewlede.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/EPA-Clarke-letter.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reviewed the move</a> in 2021 and determined that the company chose acceptable substitutes.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p>There are only a few opportunities to make a living by getting good at creating tables to facilitate high-frequency math that end-users will find entertaining but will have predictable statistical properties at scale.</p><p>One of them is designing roleplaying games. Seems like an interesting topic but someone else will have to write about it. In this column, the dragon sleeps on a hoard of interchange revenue, you slay him to get credit cards rewards points, and the card issuer running the game merrily chuckles at players’ misperception that they are dragons. No, silly, they’re much realer and much richer.</p><p>A disclaimer off the top: I used to work at, and am still an advisor of, Stripe. A major portion of the Stripe economic model is charging businesses money to take payments on credit cards. Stripe’s two largest costs are paying smart people and paying interchange, and of the two, one would feel a lot better to cut.&nbsp;</p><p>Another disclaimer: Due to long-standing practice, I am (homeopathically) exposed to the common equity of financial services companies that my family uses, so that I can call up Investor Relations if I ever need to escalate a routine banking issue. My family’s main U.S. bank happens to be Chase, which is mentioned below.</p><p>Almost everybody writing about credit cards on the Internet receives some sort of spiff if you sign up after clicking through tagged links in their material. That is not my business model (people <a href="https://www.bitsaboutmoney.com/memberships/">pay me to write</a> about financial infrastructure), but is probably one you want to be cognizant of every time you read about credit cards online.</p><p>As we have <a href="https://www.bitsaboutmoney.com/archive/how-credit-cards-make-money/">discussed previously</a>, credit cards have multiple different ways of earning money, but the most important one to this discussion is interchange. It is a fee, ultimately paid by the card-accepting business, which gets sliced up between various parties in the credit card ecosystem to incentivize them to put their logos in the wallets and on the phones of well-heeled customers and increase the amount they spend and the frequency with which they spend it. (In industry, we sometimes distinguish interchange—which mostly goes to the issuing bank—and scheme fees—which mostly go to the credit card brand itself—but as interchange is much larger, let’s just call them both interchange for simplicity.)</p><p>Interchange is generally a percentage fee based on the final transaction size plus optionally a per-transaction fee. You can just <a href="https://usa.visa.com/content/dam/VCOM/download/merchants/visa-usa-interchange-reimbursement-fees.pdf">look up</a> the <a href="https://www.mastercard.us/content/dam/public/mastercardcom/na/us/en/documents/merchant-rates-2023-2024.pdf">rates</a>, but I strongly recommend you don’t, as you will be reduced to gibbering madness. (It took many smart people many years of work before Stripe could deterministically predict almost all interchange it was charged in advance of actually getting billed for it.)</p><p>To highlight something which is routinely surprising for non-specialists: interchange fees are not constant and fixed. They are set based on quite a few factors (<em>gibbering madness intensifies</em>) but, most prominently, based on the rank of card product you use. The more a card product is pitched to socioeconomically well-off people, the more expensive interchange is. Credit card issuers <em>explicitly and directly</em> charge the rest of the economy for the work involved in recruiting the most desirable customers.</p><p>The basic intuition underlying rewards cards as a product is that highly desirable customers have options in how they spend their money. You can directly influence them to use your rails by making those rails more lucrative, more fun, or both for the customer. And so card issuers (and the networks) compete with each other for so-called “share of wallet” by bidding with interchange.</p><p>This is not quite as sophisticated as the system of dueling robots which bids for your attention every time you open a page on the Internet with an ad on it. The bids are generally speaking pretty static and made years in advance, at or before the time a user signs up for a card product, with relatively minor adjustments made over time. Program managers at card issuers are extremely, extremely sensitive to upsetting the apple cart and churning loyal users, and so they attempt to avoid doing this except when circumstances make it unavoidable.</p><h2 id="why-isn%E2%80%99t-every-card-a-rewards-card">Why isn’t every card a rewards card?</h2><p>Different regions have ended up with different equilibria in the rewards game. In the United States, card acceptance is expensive and the rewards economy is <em>robust</em>. In Japan, card acceptance is expensive and the rewards economy is fairly muted due to—ahem—effective collusion by issuers. In Europe, card acceptance is cheap by regulatory fiat and so rewards are far less common (or commonly lucrative) than in the U.S.</p><p>Similarly, debit card rewards used to be fairly common in the United States until the Dodd-Frank Act <a href="https://www.bitsaboutmoney.com/archive/debit-cards-are-hidden-financial-infrastructure/">capped debit card interchange</a> (with a very important carveout for small banks in the Durbin amendment). When interchange is regulated, the size of the pie isn’t large enough to give the end-user of the card a tasty slice, and so they get nothing.</p><p>But we can see that, even scoping to credit cards in the United States, not every card is a rewards card. What explains why CapitalOne, for example, offers rewards for its Quicksilver card but not the Platinum Mastercard? Is <a href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/quicksilver">mercury</a> attempting to burnish its image after that horrible toxicity thing?</p><figure><img src="https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/kjmVEJNeGC6Ndngtsm1xQVAhBv2NIrlRxdYO54jeQMZE_kCZBJLxHhZsVWj8V_V6ZBtiHz4E2c9mDKOANWjEbUobYcJsKsy8NNAR2hwxmtIf6QTU7ZCLljy8ZCyAAFAUjsCeAZqUXXIXPI8QTTpOnzU" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1600" height="574"><figcaption><span>Three of Capital One's many offerings.</span></figcaption></figure><p>Partly, this is that different users have different jobs-to-be-done for credit cards. (Many users of credit cards, potentially including some readers of this column, believe that they are the typical users of credit cards. No users of credit cards are typical.)</p><p>Credit cards are both a payment instrument and an access point for a revolving credit line. That they are an expensive way to borrow money is one of the first things said in any personal finance text. They are also one of the most accessible ways to borrow money, and that is their primary value proposition for many users, typically ones lower on the socioeconomic ladder. These users spend relatively little in a month compared to their revolving balance, which they continuously pay interest on. It trivially follows that most money on their accounts is earned via net interest margin and not from interchange.</p><p>To the extent these users notice numerically defined features of their credit cards, which is somewhat dubious, it is the headline APR (cost of credit) and their credit limits. “Starter” cards and other products aimed at this user group typically have no rewards; they instead use interchange income to “bid down” the headline APR. Interchange functions as a subsidization of the cost of credit throughout the economy by businesses which want to sell things to people who would use credit to buy things. The limit case of this is Buy Now, Pay Later, where the cost of credit is <a href="https://www.bitsaboutmoney.com/archive/buy-now-pay-later/">subsidized straight to free</a>.</p><p>The heaviest credit card <em>spenders</em>, and this fact is both uncontroversial and flies in the face of what many personal finance columnists believe, are wealthy and sophisticated. They use credit cards primarily as payment instruments. Issuers compete aggressively for their business, which is quite lucrative. This is not because they pay much in interest, because while they have higher headline APRs they only rarely revolve balances. It is because “clipping the ticket” via interchange on a high volume of transactions is an excellent business to be in.</p><p>How dramatic is this? Allow me to reproduce a graph from <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2330942">Regulating Consumer Financial Products: Evidence from Credit Cards</a>. (This paper is something of the Rosetta stone for credit card issuance as a field, both in that it is a single source for understanding a huge range of human endeavor and in that it stands in for a very large literature that nobody else reaches for to be the first citation when the Rosetta Stone already exists. If you see an unlabeled graph on Twitter about credit cards, it was probably lifted from this paper.)<br></p><figure><img src="https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/qS9_ADww9fJP_bRDLuovsaHR-yhqnHLSBlE_a2o9hri4Mc-LUX0gjHhRVabD7dAimzd7JUQGYey-GsaQghWATfLlJGDROmOAJyvFAIF_J37Qylgs0U6e2sCk6JHTWy46lsNSsFn4DaQpSdraD8H1Pjg" alt="" loading="lazy" width="626" height="488"><figcaption><span>Interchange income net of rewards expenses heavily favors high FICO users.</span></figcaption></figure><p>As you can see, as a percentage of Average Daily Balance (ADB), even after rewards expense, interchange gets very sharply more lucrative at the top of the credit score distribution (740+, which is roughly 10% of accounts). The difference is <em>actually larger than you see here</em>, since credit lines and ADB also increase with credit score, for predictable reasons. (Rich people consume more than poor people on an absolute basis, film at eleven.)</p><h2 id="the-complexity-spectrum-of-rewards-products">The complexity spectrum of rewards products</h2><p>The simplest reward products are straight “cashback”. The issuer totals up all of one’s net purchases (all purchases less refunds) in a statement period. It then credits the user with a particular percentage of that for each statement. Either automatically or periodically at the user’s request, it transforms some of that notional banked credit into a statement credit, decreasing the amount the user needs to pay to cover their purchases in the current month.</p><p>This is as simple as it gets and we’re already necessarily handwaving away libraries worth of complexity. (For example, calculation of net purchases needs to be fairly robust against adversarial collaboration of users and merchants or the issuer gets turned into a money pump within a matter of days and will not likely be able to detect or reverse this condition for at least several weeks. This has happened many, many times. Credit card issuers, when they screw this up, lose millions of dollars and dry their tears on money.)</p><p>Anyhow, in the mists of history, that percentage started flat; typically, 1%. The math supporting this is typically fairly simple: take in 140bps as revenue, pay the user 100 bps as effectively a cost of customer acquisition, keep some portion of 40 bps as one’s margin.</p><p>In nations other than ones with effective cartel-like behavior by issuers, this equilibrium was not stable, because competing issuers would bid e.g. 1.25% cash back on the same underlying economics and compete for share of wallet. This happened extremely robustly, for decades.</p><p>One iteration of this game was cash back “categories”. Particularly post-Internet, certain cohorts of customers were most interested in the headline cashback percentage rate. Issuers began to design products which were more complicated, such as “1% cash back in principle, however, 1.5% cash back at gas stations.”</p><h2 id="a-fun-rabbit-hole-about-credit-card-acceptance">A fun rabbit hole about credit card acceptance</h2><p>A huge percentage of all credit cards are “co-branded”; they are issued by a financial institution but bear the name of some other institution which inspires a lot of loyalty. A teeny, tiny percentage of co-branded cards name e.g. tertiary educational institutions. Most name a business that a customer has an intense, ongoing relationship with: Costco, their airline of choice, etc.</p><p>Co-branded cards are <em>extremely</em> big business. One subtlety about them: a co-branded card will often have a special rewards tier for the business named on the card. This is partially that business choosing, as a marketing expense, to split some of their core margin with their most loyal customers (<em>overwhelmingly</em> the target audience for the co-branded card). But, surprisingly to many non-specialists, that is not the sole source of margin to reward cardholders with.</p><p>This is because, at the scale of the largest businesses in the world, financial services are cross-sold and structurally interconnected. There is one team in a bank (it happens to be Chase, for what it is worth) attempting to capture Starbuck’s card processing business. There is another team that wants to convince Starbucks to co-brand Chase card products. These two teams <em>can talk to each other</em> prior to making proposals to Starbucks.</p><p>And so, without knowing anything about the payments industry, you can speculate with a very high degree of confidence that Starbucks has received a complicated spreadsheet saying what Chase will charge it for every conceivable type of credit and debit card that wants a latte. A prominent negotiated line on that spreadsheet includes, effectively, a major discount for “on us” transactions: when Chase’s left hand needs to move money from Chase’s right hand because someone wants to pay Starbucks money for their Starbucks using their Starbucks-branded money. (This is easy to conflate with, and is separate from, Starbucks’ extremely impressive stored-value product. <em>That</em> probably mostly <a href="https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/credit-cards/chase-to-sunset-starbucks-credit-card-convert-users-to-freedom-cards">cannibalized</a> their credit product, which… alright, we have to stop the levels of digression somewhere or we’ll be here all day.)</p><p>Because “on us” is structurally cheaper (the transaction literally travels over fewer rails and therefore there are fewer “mouths to feed”) and because it is incentive compatible for all parties to subsidize these transactions, as a card program designer, you have a relatively easy time being generous with regards to this particular cell of your spreadsheet.</p><h2 id="back-to-more-complicated-cases">Back to more complicated cases</h2><p>So imagine you’re the card program designer for a card that, like most cards, does not have a particular named business happily subsidizing your users. You desire to quote a headline cashback number much higher than 1%. But you’d still like to keep some margin from interchange. What could you do?</p><p>One is you make the headline number larger but contingent on something. Say, for example, the card rebates 1.5%, but only for… bookstores. Any bookstore. For all other transactions, it is 1%.</p><p>The thing you would love with this offering is to preferentially attract people who are <em>very emotionally invested in being readers</em> and who spends <em>very little of her on-this-card wallet on books</em>. The emotional investment in the story the card offers brings the customer in; the <em>blended</em> cost to acquire the customer is closer to 1% industry standard and not to the 1.5% headline number.</p><p>Money is fungible, money is fungible, money is fungible, but many people don’t actually orient their lives as if this were true, and so the financial industry meets them where they are and then charges them for the privilege. This user values a dollar more when it is a books-dollar than when it is a food-dollar. You, a credit card program manager, can math out a way to get her as many books-dollars as she is interested in. (This is similar, in spirit, to how Bryrne Hobart <a href="https://marker.medium.com/why-the-survival-of-the-airlines-depends-on-frequent-flyer-programs-2509bd3f25d0">describes</a> airline frequent flyer programs as working. One key difference that credit card program managers have to understand: a source of advantage for frequent flyer miles as a pseudocurrency is that they can turn very-low-marginal-cost inputs, unsold seats, into very-high-perceived-marginal-benefit outputs, “free vacations”. Books-dollars may very well be worth more than a dollar to our target user here, but books-dollars are very difficult to manufacture in quantity for less than about 98ish cents.)</p><p>In principle, you could even offer <em>more</em> than your direct interchange revenue as the headline number, if you were very, very sure that your typical user would not preferentially use your card only to buy books and use a competitor’s card to buy groceries, gasoline, medicine, and similar.&nbsp;</p><p>Now, unfortunately, remember what we said about typical credit card users? That’s <em>right</em>. They don’t exist. Very many of your users will do what you want them to, and use the card in a perfectly-acceptable-but-not-exactly-optimal fashion, and you will have a blended cost very near 1% for them. And very many of your users will do exactly what you most don’t want, and use the card <em>only</em> to buy books.</p><p>This is… far less incentive compatible for you, particularly if you decided that the business of manufacturing books-dollars was so lucrative that you could rebate more than the direct interchange revenue given mix effects. These users will have blended costs very close to your headline number, not to your modeled blended costs.</p><p>These users will even band into tribes, find each other on the Internet, and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/churning/">swap tips</a> for exploiting poor, defenseless credit card program managers like yourself. The tribal elders will eventually run businesses, with names like <a href="https://thepointsguy.com/">The Points Guy</a>, which eventually get quietly acquired by very sophisticated private equity firms. Those PE firms are betting that you continue paying generous per-signup affiliate commissions to Internet properties which send you new card users. You bet you will also paying tens of millions of dollars annually to Frequently Adversely Selected New Accounts Dot Com. And Redditors bet they will continue chortling that they have pulled one over on you, because haha, you’re not nearly as good as they are at fourth grade math or keeping spreadsheets.</p><p>The biggest difference between you and a Redditor is not ability to do fourth grade math or ability to do spreadsheets. Redditors are frequently <em>sophisticated</em> with their spreadsheets; many of them could clearly earn three orders of magnitude more from the financial industry if they stopped thinking that the right way to monetize spreadsheet skill was in gaming credit card signup bonuses.</p><p>The biggest difference is that you’re optimizing <em>over portfolios, over time</em> and Redditors are largely playing in single player mode (and frequently over short horizons). You only care about single or dual player mode to the extent that you avoid obviously degenerate offerings where adverse selecting single players quickly dominate your entire book of business. Which is <em>very much a risk</em>, which is why the bank has smart people like you keeping spreadsheets.</p><p>The Redditors think failure modes for the bank sound like <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/david-philipps-pudding-guy-travel-deals_n_577c9397e4b0a629c1ab35a7">pudding guy</a>. Pudding guy, was, of course, one of the highest-ROI ad buys in the history of capitalism.</p><h2 id="further-refinements-in-cat-and-mouse-games">Further refinements in cat and mouse games</h2><p>But, just like lotteries have to keep reskinning the random number generators or the games get stale and ticket sales go down, credit card program managers have to periodically shake things up for something to cut through their adversaries’ built-in distribution networks and massive, massive marketing budgets.</p><p>One innovation, now 20+ years old, was a <em>rotating</em> favored category for cash-back. So instead of being 1.5% for bookstores 1% all else, it would be 1.5% for groceries in Q1, for gas in Q2, etc etc.</p><p>The theory behind this was pretty simple: many customers attracted by the headline number could be brought in the door by it but would be fairly inattentive after a card was their new “top of wallet” (the default card for spending). Over time, a combination of inattentiveness, changing willingness to spend time playing the game, and rewards caps would bring the portfolio’s cost of rewards close to the baseline and not to the headline reward number.</p><p>If for some reason playing this game interests you, one prominent product is called the Chase Freedom card. It should not be an attractive product for you, given plausible assumptions about the readership of this column, but it is an attractive <em>enough</em> product that probably millions of Americans use it.</p><h2 id="giving-the-customer-more-choices-more-frequently">Giving the customer more choices more frequently</h2><p>If you were hypothetically to have spent the last few years dining with relatively well-off people in SFBA, when it came time to pay for dinner you’d see two credit card products with a combined 90%+ share: Chase Sapphire Reserve (CSR) and an interchangeable American Express card. This, ahem, includes many diners who are professionally connected to upstart payment methods.</p><p>American Express, for a very long time, had an almost mortal lock on the top end of the credit card market. Chase attempted to disrupt that in 2016 by <em>very overtly</em> attempting to buy away their core customer. You can read lots in other places about the original promotion, generally tsk-tsking about how absurdly lucrative it was for customers and how it caused Chase to have a (temporary) loss associated with their cards business. Personally, I think it was one of the most interesting strategic moves in the last 20 years of retail banking, but a full essay on that would require some other-than-public knowledge as to the size of the tsunami that happened after it.</p><p>One thing that is public but not well appreciated: Chase didn’t just <em>decide</em> to create an extremely lucrative-for-the-customer offering out of the goodness of their hearts and out of their own P&amp;L. No, they <em>pitched Visa on this idea</em>. For too long, Visa, you have watched your competitor American Express outcompete every issuer in the Visa system for the best wallets in the world. They can do that because they can afford to, because American Express charges systematically higher interchange rates than Visa does even at its topmost tier. Visa, you should <em>create a new tier </em>where your not-exactly-chosen champions can try to spend those interchange dollars to give American Express a run for their money.</p><p>And, lo, Visa <em>did</em> create a new tier. You can expose yourself to gibbering madness if you want to know what the name for it is. But Chase got Visa to authorize Chase charging almost the entire economy more for credit card acceptance with the specific goal of outcompeting American Express for the most lucrative highest-monthly-spend virtually-never-revolve-a-balance credit card users.</p><p>That was <em>part</em> of what made the numbers work.</p><p>Another part is that the CSR offers a fairly complicated rewards scheme, with a lot of opportunities for people to pick things which feel great but are not optimal. For example, Chase will let you cash out CSR points on a 1:1 basis at either Amazon or Apple, integrated directly into the checkout flows. Those <em>feel great</em>.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/riPQOFhy7wsVEZKEXS-UpuK1fy3wAavV5l0PQKeo7Jq0gr7rBvL-ILrpQNRAonyXBBTi9fCTN_QMGOOzBeP8TMr0J9Dug9mKN59V9qmndT627LMxumoFQQ7TQFoIAtKz8goBElpBM8f-hkuh_p7oTvk" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1206" height="846"><figcaption><span>This image has been edited to remove private information and to highlight, in red, the offering.</span></figcaption></figure><p>People <em>love</em> Amazon and Apple and they love free Amazon and free Apple even more. This is true even among a portion of very sophisticated, wealthy, numerate CSR users, who love this idea so much they click a button designed for suckers.</p><p>Why is that a sucker’s checkout button? Because CSR also includes a feature called Pay Yourself Back which in the past prominently, and today a bit… less prominently, lets you cash out rewards at better than 1:1. You get a 25% bonus if you Pay Yourself Back by nominating past transactions at grocery stores: 10,000 points gets you $125 in statement credits if you are willing to do a trivial amount of clicking to show Chase $125+ in spend at grocery stores.</p><p>Stating the obvious: Chase knows what a computer is and does not require you to actually identify your purchases at grocery stores. This is a product decision to both a) force you to use your card at grocery stores and b) force yourself to say “Chase is getting me free groceries! How nice of them!” on a transaction-by-transaction level once a month to use your card optimally.</p><p>There are many, many other sucker buttons.</p><p>But, because the card is fundamentally targeted at rich, sophisticated people, Chase really does pay out a shedload of rewards. The 3% headline rate for travel and dining plus the 25% Pay Yourself Back kicker means there is a sustained and trivial pathway to get 375 bps out, which is one of the very, very, very few places in the industry where there is a sustained, trivial, uncapped way to get out more than the direct cost of interchange.</p><p>Why does this persist? Partly it is due to the standard credit card portfolio strategy: every time someone uses a CSR on Amazon (and not e.g. the Amazon rewards card, also from Chase) or uses CSR points to buy <a href="https://www.apple.com/">high-margin white plastic</a>, Chase’s contribution margin for the portfolio goes up, and at scale <em>quite a large percentage </em>of customers do this.</p><p>Partly it is due to Chase thinking that they’ll just <em>be so good</em> for their target customer that their target customer <em>will not bother playing the game optimally. </em>That would require the customer carefully maintaining a portfolio of credit relationships and having seven cards saved on their iPhone and not, simply, the CSR.</p><p>Partly it is due to the really interesting strategic reasons for having CSR available: to a much larger degree than American Express, Chase is a diversified financial services empire. The CSR was effectively designed as a wedge product to get something Chase branded into the hands of affluent up-and-coming young urban professionals, with the goal of eventually getting them to not move just their wallet but their entire financial existence (and potentially their current-or-future <em>entities’</em> financial existences) onto Chase.</p><p>The Sapphire mini-brand was so loved that they reused it for a bog-standard premium checking account. (It was named the Chase Sapphire Premium Checking Account, in a decision which probably consumed several tens of millions of dollars of professional effort, and I mean that absolutely descriptively and not as a criticism. I was not in <em>that</em> meeting… but I’ve been in that <em>kind</em> of meeting. Those that have been in it know that it is not in any way a single-meeting single-decisionmaker sort of call.)</p><h2 id="more-directions-to-go-in">More directions to go in</h2><p>The blessing and curse of essays is that they have to end somewhere, and then pick up anew somewhere else. Hopefully the above gives you a bit more context on what is in your wallet.</p><div><p>In the future, we'll likely discuss the complicated iterated game played by the credit card networks and the rest of society regarding interchange rates, how there are high-interchange-high-reward equilibria and low-interchange-low-reward equilibria, the recent settlement where the networks agreed to temporarily decrease interchange, and other topics. </p></div>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://lutrasecurity.com/en/articles/kobold-letters/">https://lutrasecurity.com/en/articles/kobold-letters/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39928558">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>Anyone who has had to deal with HTML emails on a technical level has probably reached the point where they wanted to quit their job or just set fire to all the mail clients due to their inconsistent implementations. But HTML emails are not just a source of frustration, they can also be a serious security risk.</p><p>Imagine you receive an email forwarded by your manager asking you to wire a large sum of money to a bank account. Of course, you have heard of CEO fraud, so you double-check that the email really comes from your manager. It does, and it may even be cryptographically signed – if you do that in your company. However, you are still not convinced, so you call your manager to ensure that the email is legit. He confirms, so you transfer the money.</p><p>Yet this would be the end of the article if this wasn’t a <em>scam</em>. So what went wrong?</p><h2 id="kobold-letters">Kobold letters</h2><img src="https://lutrasecurity.com/en/articles/kobold-letters/kobold_letter.png" alt="Kobold holding a letter by oira.art"><p>The email your manager received and forwarded to you was something completely innocent, such as a potential customer asking a few questions. All that email was supposed to achieve was being forwarded to you. However, the moment the email appeared in your inbox, it changed. The innocent pretext disappeared and the real phishing email became visible. A phishing email you <em>had</em> to trust because you knew the sender and they even confirmed that they had forwarded it to you.</p><p>This attack is possible because most email clients allow CSS to be used to style HTML emails. When an email is forwarded, the position of the original email in the DOM usually changes, allowing for CSS rules to be selectively applied only when an email has been forwarded.</p><p>An attacker can use this to include elements in the email that appear or disappear depending on the context in which the email is viewed. Because they are usually invisible, only appear in certain circumstances, and can be used for all sorts of mischief, I’ll refer to these elements as <em>kobold letters</em>, after the elusive sprites of mythology.</p><p>This affects all types of email clients and webmailers that support HTML email. So pretty much all of them. For the moment, however, I’ll focus on selected clients to demonstrate the problem, and leave it to others (or future me) to extend the principle to other clients.</p><h2 id="thunderbird">Thunderbird</h2><hr><p>This issue was reported to Mozilla on 05.03.2024.<br>The planned release date and a draft of the following section were communicated to Mozilla on 20.03.2024.<br>Possible mitigations have been discussed but will not be implemented until a later date.</p><hr><p>Exploiting this in Thunderbird is fairly straightforward. Thunderbird wraps emails in <code>&lt;div class="moz-text-html" lang="x-unicode"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</code> and leaves them otherwise unchanged, making it a good example to demonstrate the principle. When forwarding an email, the quoted email will be enclosed in another <code>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</code>, moving it down one level in the DOM.</p><p>Taking this into account leads to the following proof of concept:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="html"><span><span><span>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</span>
</span></span><span><span>&lt;<span>html</span>&gt;
</span></span><span><span>

</span></span><span><span>    &lt;<span>style</span>&gt;
</span></span><span><span>        .<span>kobold-letter</span> {
</span></span><span><span>            <span>display</span>: <span>none</span>;
</span></span><span><span>        }
</span></span><span><span>
</span></span><span><span>        .<span>moz-text-html</span><span>&gt;</span><span>div</span><span>&gt;</span>.<span>kobold-letter</span> {

</span></span><span><span>        }
</span></span><span><span>    &lt;/<span>style</span>&gt;
</span></span><span><span>&lt;/<span>head</span>&gt;
</span></span><span><span>
</span></span><span><span>&lt;<span>body</span>&gt;
</span></span><span><span>    &lt;<span>p</span>&gt;This text is always visible.&lt;/<span>p</span>&gt;
</span></span><span><span>    &lt;<span>p</span> <span>class</span><span>=</span><span>"kobold-letter"</span>&gt;This text will only appear after forwarding.&lt;/<span>p</span>&gt;
</span></span><span><span>&lt;/<span>body</span>&gt;
</span></span><span><span>
</span></span><span><span>&lt;/<span>html</span>&gt;
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>The email contains two paragraphs, one that has no styling and should always be visible, and one that is hidden with <code>display: none;</code>. This is how it looks when the email is displayed in Thunderbird:</p><figure><img src="https://lutrasecurity.com/en/articles/kobold-letters/kobold-moz-1.png" alt="A simple email containing the sentence &quot;This text is always visible.&quot;"><figcaption><h4>This email may look harmless...</h4></figcaption></figure><p>As expected, only the paragraph “<em>This text is always visible.</em>” is shown. However, when we forward the email, the second paragraph becomes suddenly visible. Albeit only to the new recipient – the original recipient who forwarded the email remains unaware.</p><figure><img src="https://lutrasecurity.com/en/articles/kobold-letters/kobold-moz-2.png" alt="The sentence &quot;This text will only appear after forwarding.&quot; is now visible."><figcaption><h4>...until it has been forwarded.</h4></figcaption></figure><p>Because we know exactly where each element will be in the DOM relative to <code>.moz-text-html</code>, and because we control the CSS, we can easily hide and show any part of the email, changing the content completely. If we style the kobold letter as an overlay, we can not only affect the forwarded email, but also (for example) replace any comments your manager might have had on the original mail, opening up even more opportunities for phishing.</p><h2 id="outlook-on-the-web">Outlook on the web</h2><hr><p>This issue was reported to Microsoft on 05.03.2024.<br>The planned release date and a draft of the following section were communicated to Microsoft on 20.03.2024.<br>The report was marked as closed by Microsoft on 26.03.204 after deciding not to take any immediate action.</p><hr><p>In <em>Outlook on the web</em> (OWA) the situation is slightly more complicated, as it is a webmailer. Emails are contained in <code>&lt;div class="rps_78fa"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</code>, but the exact class name will change. To prevent the CSS of emails to affect the style of the webmailer, Outlook modifies the email by prefixing all ids and classes with <code>x_</code> and adjust the CSS accordingly.</p><p>Considering all this, we get the following proof of concept:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="html"><span><span><span>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</span>

</span></span><span><span>
</span></span><span><span>&lt;/<span>html</span>&gt;
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>When the email is displayed by OWA, the CSS will look like this:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="html"><span><span>&lt;<span>style</span>&gt;
</span></span><span><span><span>&lt;!</span><span>--</span>
</span></span><span><span>.<span>rps_78fa</span> .<span>x_kobold-letter</span>

</span></span><span><span>	{<span>display</span>:<span>block</span><span>!important</span>}
</span></span><span><span><span>--</span><span>&gt;</span>
</span></span><span><span>&lt;/<span>style</span>&gt;
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>The email will be displayed as expected:</p><figure><img src="https://lutrasecurity.com/en/articles/kobold-letters/kobold-owa-1.png" alt="A simple email containing the sentence &quot;This text is always visible.&quot;"><figcaption><h4>This email could ask for a harmless favour...</h4></figcaption></figure><p>After forwarding, the kobold letter will be enclosed by another <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> and the CSS will be updated again:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="html"><span><span>&lt;<span>style</span>&gt;
</span></span><span><span><span>&lt;!</span><span>--</span>
</span></span><span><span>.<span>rps_78fa</span> .<span>x_x_kobold-letter</span>

</span></span><span><span><span>--</span><span>&gt;</span>
</span></span><span><span>&lt;/<span>style</span>&gt;
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Note that in the second rule, the <code>&gt;</code> between <code>.rps_78fa</code> and <code>div</code> has been dropped. This must be taken into account when creating more complicated selectors. Our proof of concept works as intended:</p><figure><img src="https://lutrasecurity.com/en/articles/kobold-letters/kobold-owa-2.png" alt="The sentence &quot;This text will only appear after forwarding.&quot; is now visible."><figcaption><h4>...or all your money.</h4></figcaption></figure><p>The adjustments that OWA applies to the email do not interfere with the attack, but need to be considered when crafting a kobold letter. As we don’t have an easily recognizable anchor point, this can become a nuisance when trying to create a kobold letter that works for multiple clients at the same time.</p><h2 id="gmail">Gmail</h2><hr><p>This issue was reported to Google on 05.03.2024.<br>The planned release date and a draft of the following section were communicated to Google on 20.03.2024.</p><hr><p>So far, we could define kobold letters as elements that use CSS selectors to be shown or hidden depending on the context in which the email is displayed. By this definition, Gmail is technically not vulnerable to kobold letters because it strips all styling from the email when forwarding it.</p><p>This allows for an even simpler – albeit more limited – attack: It is now sufficient to hide the kobold letter with CSS, and it will automatically appear when forwarded. However, this does not allow the opposite behaviour, where the kobold letter is visible in the original email and invisible in the forwarded email.</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="html"><span><span><span>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</span>
</span></span><span><span>&lt;<span>html</span>&gt;

</span></span><span><span>
</span></span><span><span>&lt;/<span>html</span>&gt;
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This is aided by the fact that when the email is forwarded, the CSS is not removed until after it has been sent:</p><figure><img src="https://lutrasecurity.com/en/articles/kobold-letters/kobold-gmail-1.png" alt="A simple email containing the sentence &quot;This text is always visible.&quot;"><figcaption><h4>Even while commenting on the forwarded message, the illusion is maintained...</h4></figcaption></figure><p>While the second paragraph was clearly not visible in the editor, it is in the resulting email:</p><figure><img src="https://lutrasecurity.com/en/articles/kobold-letters/kobold-gmail-2.png" alt="The sentence &quot;This text will only appear after forwarding.&quot; is now visible."><figcaption><h4>...but in the end it will betray you.</h4></figcaption></figure><p>While it is difficult to fix kobold letters in general without breaking too much, Google could mitigate the problem by removing the CSS already in the editor. This would at least allow the sender to detect the attack before forwarding the email.</p><h2 id="prior-work">Prior work</h2><p>The fact that this is possible in one way or another is neither surprising nor new. Therefore similar issues have been reported in the past:</p><ul><li><a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1796180" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Thunderbird - Modification of replied mail content without knowledge of replier of the mail using CSS</a></li><li><a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1836276" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Treat OpenPGP/SMIME email messages with certain CSS elements as unsigned</a></li><li><a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1731198" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Composition should use inline styling so that styles from quotes don’t leak into the message</a></li></ul><p>The novelty of kobold letters lies in the focus on a specific attack scenario, while looking at multiple email clients. This hopefully will help raise awareness of the risks associated with HTML emails and contribute to the discussion of what trade-offs are acceptable to mitigate these risks.</p><h2 id="outlook-not-the-software">Outlook (not the software)</h2><p>Users can mitigate kobold letters by disabling HTML email altogether or viewing it in a restricted mode (e.g. “plain HTML” in Thunderbird). For email clients, it is more difficult to implement a mitigation, as preventing the use of <code>&lt;style&gt;</code><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> would fix this, but would also break a lot of existing solutions in the email ecosystem. An implementation like the one Google already uses for Gmail could be a compromise that allows for stylized corporate newsletters while limiting the risks of HTML email.</p><p>Unfortunately, for the foreseeable future, it is sadly not realistic to expect email clients to implement robust mitigation. This means that it is up to the users to be aware of the dangers of HTML emails and to take the necessary precautions.</p><figure><img src="https://lutrasecurity.com/en/articles/kobold-letters/This-is-fine.jpg" alt="This is fine meme"><figcaption><h4>But I guess this is fine.</h4></figcaption></figure></article></div>]]></description>

<p>Following a successful pilot project, the northern German federal state of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schleswig-Holstein">Schleswig-Holstein</a> has decided to move from Microsoft Windows and Microsoft Office to Linux and LibreOffice (and other <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software">free and open source software</a>) on the 30,000 PCs used in the local government. As reported on the homepage of the Minister-President:</p>
<blockquote><p>Independent, sustainable, secure: Schleswig-Holstein will be a digital pioneer region and the first German state to introduce a digitally sovereign IT workplace in its state administration. With a cabinet decision to introduce the open-source software LibreOffice as the standard office solution across the board, the government has given the go-ahead for the first step towards complete digital sovereignty in the state, with further steps to follow.</p></blockquote>
<p>The term <strong>digital sovereignty</strong> is very important here. If a public administration uses proprietary, closed software that can’t be studied or modified, it is very difficult to know what happens to users’ data:</p>
<blockquote><p>We have no influence on the operating processes of such [proprietary] solutions and the handling of data, including a possible outflow of data to third countries. As a state, we have a great responsibility towards our citizens and companies to ensure that their data is kept safe with us and we must ensure that we are always in control of the IT solutions we use and that we can act independently as a state.</p></blockquote>
<p>This follows on from the finding by the European Data Protection Supervisor (EDPS) that the <a hrefe="https://blog.documentfoundation.org/blog/2024/03/29/use-of-microsoft-365-breaches-data-protection-law-in-eu/">European Commission’s use of Microsoft 365 breaches data protection law</a>.</p>
<p>In addition, there is this question: <strong>Why should local governments use taxpayers’ money to buy proprietary, closed software from a single vendor?</strong> With LibreOffice and free software, administrations have much more choice <a href="https://www.documentfoundation.org/certified-developers/">where to get the software and support</a>, and can fund local developers to make improvements. In addition, local governments can maintain full control of the software, study its source code, make changes they require and deploy it entirely on their own infrastructure. <a href="https://publiccode.eu/en/">Learn more about “Public Money, Public Code”.</a></p>
<p>So we welcome the decision in Schleswig-Holstein to move its IT administration to free and open source software, for all the benefits it brings, both for the local government and the almost three million citizens of the state.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2><strong>Participants weren’t able to stop data sharing in any of the apps</strong></h2>
<p dir="ltr">In practice, protecting privacy on an Apple device requires persistent and expert clicking on each app individually. Apple's help falls short.</p>
<p dir="ltr">‘The online instructions for restricting data access are very complex and confusing, and the steps required are scattered in different places. There’s no clear direction on whether to go to the app settings, the central settings – or even both,’ says&nbsp;<strong>Amel Bourdoucen</strong>, a doctoral researcher at Aalto.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In addition, the instructions didn’t list all the necessary steps or explain how collected data is processed.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The researchers also demonstrated these problems experimentally. They interviewed users and asked them to try changing the settings.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">‘It turned out that the participants weren’t able to prevent any of the apps from sharing their data with other applications or the service provider,’ Bourdoucen says.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Finding and adjusting privacy settings also took a lot of time. ‘When making adjustments, users don't get feedback on whether they’ve succeeded. They then get lost along the way, go backwards in the process and scroll randomly, not knowing if they've done enough,’ Bourdoucen says.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In the end, Bourdoucen explains, the participants were able to take one or two steps in the right direction, but none succeeded in following the whole procedure to protect their privacy.</p>
<h2><strong>Running out of options</strong></h2>
<p dir="ltr">If preventing data sharing is difficult, what does Apple do with all that data?&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">It’s not possible to be sure based on public documents, but Lindqvist says it’s possible to conclude that the data will be used to train the artificial intelligence system behind Siri and to provide personalised user experiences, among other things.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Many users are used to seamless multi-device interaction, which makes it difficult to move back to a time of more limited data sharing. However, Apple could inform users much more clearly than it does today, says Lindqvist. The study lists a number of detailed suggestions to clarify privacy settings and improve guidelines.</p>
<p dir="ltr">For individual apps, Lindqvist says that the problem can be solved to some extent by opting for a third-party service. For example, some participants in the study had switched from Safari to Firefox.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Lindqvist can’t comment directly on how Google's Android works in similar respects, as no one has yet done a similar mapping of its apps. But past research on third-party apps does not suggest that Google is any more privacy-conscious than Apple.</p>
<p dir="ltr">So what can be learned from all this – are users ultimately facing an almost impossible task?</p>
<p dir="ltr">‘Unfortunately, that's one lesson,’ says Lindqvist.</p></div></div>]]></description>

I found a solution that works surprisingly well using GPT4ALL.<p>I found GPT4ALL (<a href="https://gpt4all.io/" rel="nofollow">https://gpt4all.io</a>) to have a nice-enough GUI, and it runs reasonably quickly on my M1 MacBook Air with 8Gb of ram, and it can be setup to be a completely local solution - not sending your data to the Goliaths.</p><p>GPT4ALL has an option to access local documents, via the Sbert text embedding model (RAG).</p><p>My specific results have been as follows; using the Nous Hermes 2 Mistral DPO and Sbert - I indexed 153 days of my daily writing (most days I write between 2 and 3 thousand words).</p><p>Asking a simple question like "what are the challenges faced by the author?" provides remarkable, almost spooky results (which I won't share here) - which in my opinion are spot-on regarding my own challenges over that the period - and Sbert provides references to which documents it used to generate the answer. Options are available to reference an arbitrary number of documents, however the default is 10. Ideally I'd like to have it reference all 153 documents in the query - I'm not sure if it's a ram or a token issue, however increasing the value of documents referenced has resulted in machine lock-ups.</p><p>Anyhow - that's my experience - hope it's helpful to someone.

<p>My younger child’s MacBook Pro was unsalvageably full. Only a complete wipe would suffice—and then Time Machine failed us.</p>
<p>I love my children, but they do sometimes forget what I do for a living: answer questions and write books about the most troubling problems people have with their Macs, iPhones, and iPads. But when something goes truly wrong, they suddenly remember, “Hey, Dad might know how to fix it!”</p>
<p>So it happened that my younger asked for my help when their M2 MacBook Pro’s storage filled  up while they were downloading a (legitimate, purchased) game using Steam. No problem! I could just empty the trash. Nope, they tried that. Well, what about finding some caches and…nope. I could just go into the Terminal and…ok, that didn’t work either.</p>
<p>Turned out, my kid had managed a neat trick, though they were not alone: they had filled macOS’s startup volume storage so full that the operating system was incapable of deleting files in any fashion. Instead of halting the massive Steam download when the drive became disastrously full, macOS  continued to write files until there was just 41K free on the drive.</p>
<p>I don’t know quite what happened. They didn’t realize their terabyte SSD was quite so filled, as they keep most of their useful files in the cloud. It was likely…er, perfectly legitimate video files. Yeah, I’m sure there was <em>no problem</em> with the copyright there. But they weren’t concerned about retaining them. They just wanted their computer to work again!</p>
<p>I have a theory about what happened. Due to our gigabit Internet connection and the size of the Steam file, macOS outstripped its ability to throttle filling storage because it was also <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/102154.">making a local Time Machine snapshot</a>. The Steam file appeared monolithic to me—one giant file—but clearly not to Time Machine. macOS keeps these snapshots to provide local backups for the last 24 hours even while it’s copying files to an external or networked Time Machine destination. I don’t think macOS tracks these snapshots well, and I suspect a collision of live files on disk with the specially created snapshots.</p>
<p>I went through a succession of file deletion attempts, relying on my own knowledge and searching for similar situations in online forums:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Empty Trash:</strong> Emptying the Trash via the Finder a big “no” (File &gt; Empty Trash). “The operation can’t be completed because the disk is full.” Yes, macOS, I’m already aware of this.</li>
<li><strong>Terminal:</strong> While Terminal would launch, using the standard Unix <code>rm</code> command resulted in a similar error: “No space left on device.” All <code>rm</code> alternatives, like using the <code>find</code> command to search for very large unneeded files and adding the <code>-exec</code> option to run the <code>rm</code> command, failed too. Terminal was a bust.</li>
<li><strong>Disk Utility:</strong> Disk Utility shows Time Machine snapshots on APFS startup volumes, and you can typically select and delete these snapshots, which occupy only the amount of storage space required to contain the differences from the previous snapshot. That failed with a “no space left” error as well.</li>
</ul>
<p>It was time to restart to see if it would clear caches. Unfortunately, restarting left the Mac unable to start up at all. No matter what I tried, it would reach about halfway through the progress bar before failing.</p>
<p>I shifted to recoveryOS, Apple’s somewhat new name for the special disk partition in macOS that lets you run operations on the main startup volume while it’s not mounted, including Disk Utility repairs and reinstallation. From there, I hit the wall as well, as Terminal commands continued to fail with the same error.</p>
<p>I restarted again to access the Apple silicon <a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/transfer-files-a-mac-apple-silicon-mchlb37e8ca7/mac">Share Disk</a> option to mount my kid’s drive on one of my Macs, hoping that over Samba (the disk-sharing protocol), I’d be able to force a deletion. No dice.</p>
<p>At this point, I shifted to stronger medicine. I had a series of Time Machine backups of their drive, including one from the previous evening, and they weren’t terribly concerned about losing data, as they have most things they care about in some kind of cloud storage. Here’s where things went pear-shaped in an entirely different direction.</p>
<p>First, I erased the drive and used macOS Recovery to reinstall Ventura, the native system with which the MacBook Pro had shipped. I then used Migration Assistant at macOS startup to access the networked Time Machine backup. In choosing what files to restore, I unchecked a number to ensure there would be plenty of storage. My kid had a lot of things they could delete, too, they said, and I could give them the Time Machine backup as a mountable drive if they needed access to files that weren’t restored later.</p>
<p>Halfway through, Ventura stalled and wouldn’t resume. I decided to upgrade to Sonoma, the version of macOS that was running at the time the Mac filled its drive. That worked fine—but the upgrade took the Mac to version 14.4, and my kid had had 14.3.1 installed. When I attempted to restore directly at startup, I was told the version different wouldn’t allow it. Now what?</p>
<p>I completed a basic Sonoma user account setup and then ran Migration Assistant. It found the networked Mac on which I manage Time Machine backups and recognized it. However, it refused to mount my child’s backup volume. No matter what I did, “Mount failed” appeared. Digging around in forums, I found that Sonoma has broken the SMB/Samba-based networking mount procedure for Time Machine restores, and no one had found a solution. This appears to still be the case in 14.4.</p>

<p>Because my younger only needed their apps and certain files, we both gave up at that point. I copied their Time Machine backup onto an external 1 TB SSD through this straightforward method:</p>
<ol>
<li>On my Mac, which handles networked backups, I double-clicked the disk image for their computer and then entered their Time Machine volume password. (I always set a networked password for Time Machine volumes.)</li>
<li>I found the disk icon with the latest timestamp and copied this to an empty 1 TB drive.</li>
<li>Ejecting it from my Mac, I connected it to their stub account on their MacBook Pro and copied over the necessary files, including the contents of most of their home directory folders, excluding some large downloads and unneeded (ahem) video files.</li>
</ol>
<p>I gave them the drive so that they could restore anything else they needed if it were missing, and we’ll probably keep it on hand for a while to make sure nothing is missing.</p>
<p>This put them back in business, but I missed two tricks that I could have tried to make things easier:</p>
<ul>
<li>I could have unmounted the Time Machine backup drive from my computer I use for other computers on the network. (I have a separate drive I use for local Time Machine backups from that computer’s startup volume.) Then I could have connected that directly to my kid’s computer and it likely would have become available as a Migration Assistant starting point.</li>
<li>Failing that, I could have copied the virtual disk from the Time Machine disk image I mounted on my Mac of their backup so that the external 1 TB drive I was transferring “looked” like a Mac source volume. I’m not sure if this would have worked, but I didn’t try it. Then, I could have potentially restored directly from it using Migration Assistant.</li>
</ul>
<p>I’m sorry I didn’t try the above, but I had already invested a cumulative couple of hours of my time and over a day of effort while my kid was unconcerned about a perfect directory-to-directory recovery.</p>
<p>I hate to think what people without decades of Mac experience do when confronted with systemic, cascading failures like this when I felt helpless despite what I thought I knew and all the answers I searched for and found on forums.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="__blog-post-container" itemprop="articleBody"><p>By replacing <code>pip</code> with <code>uv</code> in our production images, our build pipeline (and therefore releasing a new version) is a lot faster.
<code>Uv</code> is an extremely fast Python package installer and resolver written in Rust. It is developed by <a href="https://astral.sh/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Astral</a> and it's open source. Check it out on <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/uv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub</a>.</p><p>In the following table, you can see that we can save around 5 hours of execution time on each build.</p><table><thead><tr><th>Arch</th><th>Pip</th><th>UV</th><th>Savings</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>aarch64</td><td>1h 24m 53s</td><td>5m 18s</td><td>~1h 20m</td></tr><tr><td>armhf</td><td>1h 52m 20s</td><td>6m 2s</td><td>~1h 46m</td></tr><tr><td>armv7</td><td>1h 26m 43s</td><td>5m 28s</td><td>~1h 21m</td></tr><tr><td>amd64</td><td>22m 10s</td><td>3m 20s</td><td>~19m</td></tr><tr><td>i386</td><td>17m 37s</td><td>3m 11s</td><td>~14m</td></tr></tbody></table><p>On average, we run the build pipeline 43 times as we create</p><ul><li>31 nightlies (one nightly per day)</li><li>7 beta releases</li><li>5 stable releases (including patch ones)</li></ul><p>In total, we save around 215 hours per month.
With this massive improvement, we can now ship hotfixes even faster, as the pipeline to ship a new version now takes around 20 minutes instead of 2.5 hours.</p><p>The 215 monthly saved execution hours can be used by other jobs and make the CI experience for all developers and our community better.
By replacing <code>pip</code> with <code>uv</code>, we improve our sustainability by using fewer resources to build our images.</p><p><strong>A big thank you to Astral for developing this amazing tool.</strong>
Please check out their <a href="https://astral.sh/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">website</a> and products as they offer, for example, a "lightning" fast linter/formatter for Python too.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<p dir="auto">Logik is an open source FPGA toolchain that fully automates converting RTL to bits, including synthesis, placement, routing, bitstream generation, and analysis. Users enter design sources, constraints, and compile options through a simple <a href="https://github.com/siliconcompiler/siliconcompiler/">SiliconCompiler</a> Python API. Once setup is complete, automated compilation can be initiated with a single line run command.</p>

<p dir="auto">Logik supports most of the features you would expect in a commercial proprietary FPGA tool chain.</p>

<p dir="auto">This code can be run with <code>./adder.py -remote</code> in the <a href="https://github.com/zeroasiccorp/logik/blob/main/examples/adder">examples/adder</a> directory, resulting in an FPGA bitstream at <code>build/adder/job0/convert_bitstream/0/outputs/adder.bin</code>.</p>
<p dir="auto">To test out the generated bitstream, you can upload it to an emulated FPGA device running in the Zero ASIC <a href="https://www.zeroasic.com/emulation?demo=fpga" rel="nofollow">Digital Twin Platform</a>.</p>
