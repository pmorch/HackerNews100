<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div dir="auto"><p><span>In 1862, Japanese travelers arrived in Europe for the first time in 240 years. Their nation, </span><a href="https://worldhistory.substack.com/p/the-jail-goes-by-the-name-of-dejima" rel="">isolated from the rest of the world</a><span> for so long, was reluctantly opening to the outside world. </span></p><p>Imagine being a member of this group — 40 men, many of them samurai, venturing out into a world full of technologies and cultures with which they had minimal experience. Their job was twofold: to learn about some of the wealthiest and most powerful societies in the world and to slow the predatory opening of Japan that had begun with American warships’ arrival in 1854. </p><p><span>In Europe, these men from a country whose technological progress had largely been frozen in the 1600s dazzled at the inventions of the industrial age. When they visited France, the </span><a href="https://www.u-tokai.ac.jp/uploads/2021/03/06-3.pdf" rel="">telegraph</a><span> especially wowed them, as they marveled that messages could cross continents in minutes. </span></p><p>Then they went to experience another budding European technology at the photo studio of Nadar. The famous photographer memorialized a large group of young men from the embassy posing with their swords:</p><p>And the more senior leaders of the mission:</p><p>I wonder what these Japanese diplomats were thinking as they sat, so far from home, having their portraits taken with cutting-edge gadgets by this bohemian weirdo. But they were just doing what everybody who passed through Paris did. If you were an important person, you got your photo snapped at Nadar’s. And, more often than not, he captured something special. </p><p><em>In last week’s post, I looked at Nadar’s rise to prominence and general vibes there — if you missed it, check it out; the rest of this post will make more sense if you do:</em></p><p><em>If you liked that post (or this one), consider subscribing as a free or paid member. I appreciate those of you who are willing and able to provide financial support for this project:</em></p><p><span>Charles Baudelaire didn’t have a word to describe the strange experience of being alive in the middle of the 19th century —  “the </span><a href="https://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/charles_baudelaire_204623" rel="">transitory</a><span>, the fugitive, the contingent” existence in growing cities amidst wild technological and cultural change. So he came up with a new one: “modernity.” Baudelaire’s poems often dealt with scandalous topics and were sometimes banned. Needless to say, he was a fixture in the avant-garde cultural scene despite often being broke and nearly homeless. </span></p><p>In 1855, as he dodged creditors, battled a laudanum addiction, and tried to keep his chronically poor health from flagging, he ended up at Nadar’s portrait studio. Nadar photographed him in his signature style — against a plain backdrop (most of Nadar’s competitors filled their frames with elaborate decoration) that let the personality of his subject speak volumes.</p><p>Baudelaire’s gaze, like his writing, was unnervingly direct:</p><p>But here he gazes out into the distance.</p><p>A few years later, after Baudelaire had succumbed to his various ailments, the painter Edouard Manet created an etching based on Nadar’s photo:</p><p><span>Manet was friends with Nadar. In 1862, Manet’s fame and notoriety were just peaking as he scandalized the Paris art world with his unconventional subject matter and techniques. One of the paintings he created that year was “Young Woman Reclining in Spanish Costume.” The model was a friend of Nadar’s, and Manet </span><a href="https://www.manet.org/young-woman-reclining-in-spanish-costume.jsp" rel="">dedicated</a><span> the canvas: "A mon ami Nadar, Manet."</span></p><p>The painter naturally visited Nadar’s studio fo a portrait; it captures an artist of fierce intelligence:</p><p><span>Nadar got to photograph his idols as well as his friends. By 1855, Alexander Dumas was well-established as one of France’s greatest living writers. As the author of books like </span><em>The Three Musketeers</em><span>, he had captured the imagination of countless young Frenchmen, including Nadar, whose father had published Dumas’ first writing and had hung a portrait of Dumas in his son’s room.  Here, Dumas seems comfortable and full of life:</span></p><p>As I mentioned last week, Dumas was featured in Nadar’s “Pantheon” of the greatest French authors and artists. He shared those honors with George Sand, the feminist author whose personal life was as well-known as her writing. She and Nadar were close friends, and he photographed her often:</p><p><span>Perhaps the biggest name in Nadar’s Pantheon was Victor Hugo, the author of </span><em>The Hunchback of Notre Dame</em><span> and </span><em>Les Miserables</em><span>. Hugo had inspired generations of Romantics and republicans and had, by the time Nadar photographed him in 1884, become a legendary figure in France. In this photo, aged 82, he gazes wearily past the camera. </span></p><p>As the great man died in 1885, Nadar was called in to take a deathbed photograph:</p><p>Soon after, Hugo would pass away. His funeral was attended by two million people. </p><p><span>The next year, Nadar captured another fading lion in the year of his death. </span><a href="https://medium.com/teatime-history/secrets-of-the-19th-centurys-hottest-piano-superstar-3f95a50eca58" rel="">Franz Liszt</a><span> had captured hearts and imaginations as the most charismatic musical performer of the 1830s and 1840s — his concerts were compared to a “demon trying to play his soul free.” By 1886, he was much more frail than he had been in his heartthrob days, but you can still see the light in his eyes:</span></p><p>Soon after this photo was taken, Liszt would push his luck by traveling to Bayreuth to help his daughter run a music festival; the effort exhausted him, and he died there.</p><p>Nadar didn’t only photograph aging legends; he also had an eye for budding stars. He was captivated by the young actress Sarah Bernhardt, who at age 13 had been told by Alexander Dumas that she was a natural acting talent. After a brief, turbulent stint at the prestigious Comédie-Française (she left after smashing an umbrella over a doorman’s head and slapping a more experienced actress in the face), she traveled around Europe and conceived a child with Prince Henri, a Belgian nobleman, in 1864. </p><p>It was in this year that Nadar, who was doing less and less photography because of his growing obsession with hot-air ballooning, was pulled back into the studio by the 20-year-old’s inescapable charisma:</p><p>He would capture her image again and again as she rose to become one of the world’s most famous people. Here she is in 1878:</p><p>And again in 1885:</p><p>Though Bernhardt’s son Maurice, with whom she may have been pregnant in Nadar’s earliest photos of her, was the son of a Belgian aristocrat, she never acknowledged Prince Henri’s paternity, preferring to joke that the father might have been Victor Hugo. </p><p>Nadar doesn’t seem to have photographed Prince Henri, but he did capture another Belgian royal, Leopold II, who would turn out to be one of history’s greatest monsters: </p><p>Maybe I’m reading too much into it, but I think I can see in his deadened, ambitious eyes the character that would later lead Leopold to inflict immense suffering on the people of the Congo for personal gain. The spark of humanity that you can see in the eyes of so many of Nadar’s subjects just isn’t there.</p><p>I’d imagine that Nadar’s political inclinations lay closer to those of the socialist/anarchist Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, captured here in the years before his death in 1865.</p><p><span>Sometimes, Nadar downplayed his art. He once </span><a href="https://www.imaging-resource.com/news/2013/03/22/the-incomparable-nadar-master-photographer-cartoonist-balloonist-of-paris" rel="">said</a><span> that</span></p><blockquote><p>Photography is a marvelous discovery, a science that has attracted the greatest intellects, an art that excites the most astute minds -- and one that can be practiced by any imbecile.</p></blockquote><p>But he also knew that it took a special talent to find the image that would speak to people. Over the last couple of weeks, I’ve spent a lot of time looking at these and other portraits by Nadar. So many of them bring a personality to life. Though separated by almost two centuries, I can now sort of imagine what it must have been like to be in a room with Victor Hugo or Edouard Manet. And that’s thanks to the immense, prolific talent of Nadar, who, false modesty aside, probably knew he was one of the greats. </p><p>After all, Nadar also said this: "In photography, like in all things, there are people who can see and others who cannot even look." </p></div></article></div><div id="discussion"><h4>Discussion about this post</h4></div></div>]]></description>

<p>If you spend most of your time in GNOME, you've probably used something like GNOME Boxes to spin up virtual machines without much hassle. We actually gave it a shoutout in our <a href="https://www.neowin.net/guides/top-10-must-have-apps-for-new-linux-users-in-2025/">list of essential Linux apps for newcomers</a> this year. KDE users, however, have often found themselves relying on <a href="https://virt-manager.org/">tools such as virt-manager</a> or <a href="https://apps.gnome.org/Boxes/">even GNOME Boxes itself</a>. While functional, these don't always feel perfectly at home within the Plasma desktop, and the old <a href="https://github.com/F1ash/qt-virt-manager">qt-virt-manager</a>, a Qt-based alternative, has seen its development stall for years.</p>

<p>Now, a new Virtual Machine Manager is <a href="https://blogs.kde.org/2025/05/18/gsoc-2025-project-intro-developing-karton-the-kde-virtual-machine-manager/">in the works for KDE Plasma</a>. The project, named Karton, has roots dating back to Aaron Rainbolt's original effort to build a QEMU frontend using its command line interface. Later, KDE developer Harald Sitter took over and developed it as a Google Summer of Code project.</p>

<p>Currently, Karton is <a href="https://invent.kde.org/sitter/karton/-/tree/master">actively developed</a> by Derek Lin, a University of Waterloo student participating in Google Summer of Code 2025. His primary aim is to deliver a virtual machine manager that truly belongs in the KDE ecosystem.</p>

                            <!-- PLACE THIS SECTION INSIDE OF YOUR BODY WHERE YOU WANT THE VIDEO PLAYER TO RENDER -->
            

<p>To feel right at home in KDE, Karton is being built with Qt Quick and Kirigami. It uses the libvirt API to handle virtual machines and could eventually work across different platforms.</p>

<p>Right now, development is focused on getting the core parts in place. Lin is working on a new domain installer that ditches direct <strong><code>virt-install</code></strong> calls in favor of libosinfo, which helps detect OS images and generate the right libvirt XML for setting up virtual machines more precisely. He's still refining device configuration and working on broader hypervisor support. Another key part of the work is building a custom SPICE viewer using Qt Quick from scratch:</p>



<p>If you're curious, here's the list of specific deliverables Lin i<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/13cVp2gISwdFwQyPr8tRzERKnerJkGQpMFffLZmmd9bQ/edit?tab=t.0">ncluded in his GSoC proposal</a>, though he notes the proposal itself is a bit outdated:</p>

<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
	<p>Install and configure virtual machines through libvirt’s XML format instead of virt-install CLI</p>

	<ul>
<li>
		<p>Add ability to configure commonly used options in UI</p>
		</li>
		<li>
		<p>Allows for more fine-tuned control of virtual machine options</p>
		</li>
	</ul>
</li>
	<li>
	<p>Implement a custom <a href="https://spice-space.org/">SPICE</a> viewer to allow users to interact with and view the active virtual machine (instead of virt-viewer</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Virtual machine snapshots to restore/backup previous states</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Intuitive UI for displaying virtual machines</p>

	<ul>
<li>
		<p>Making a user-friendly and aesthetically pleasing GUI by addressing community feedback</p>
		</li>
		<li>
		<p>Referencing <a href="https://mac.getutm.app/images/interface@2x.png">MacOS UTM list layout</a> and a preview of the VM</p>
		</li>
		<li>
		<p>Making UI convergent (mobile-friendly)</p>
		</li>
	</ul>
</li>
	<li>
	<p>Retrieving virtual machine status updates using the libvirt API virEventRegisterImpl function instead of using the default built-in event loop.</p>

	<ul>
<li>
		<p>Allows it to be integrated with custom Qt event loops</p>
		</li>
		<li>
		<p>Reduces current latency with loading virtual machine list page</p>
		</li>
	</ul>
</li>
	<li>
	<p>Adding a browse tool which lists commonly installed operating systems</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>GPU/memory usage graph as done in virt-manager</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Feature to switch between connecting to <a href="https://blog.wikichoon.com/2016/01/qemusystem-vs-qemusession.html">QEMU hypervisor with session (user) and system (root)</a>.</p>

	<ul>
<li>
		<p>GNOME Boxes seems to only support “session”, however adding support for “system” could be useful for non-KVM/Linux backends like bhyve (FreeBSD) or Hyper-V</p>
		</li>
	</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>For those interested in the timeline, Lin's GSoC proposal says the official GSoC coding starts June 2, 2025. The goal is to have a working app ready by the midterm evaluation around July 14, 2025, with the final submission due September 1, 2025.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>I used to use <span id="undefined" data-source="{&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Roam&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Roam&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:&quot;3&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;/c/roam&quot;}"><a href="https://every.to/c/roam">Roam</a></span> every day, but I don’t use it much anymore. Based on what I can see on Twitter, and a casual survey of friends, I don’t think I’m alone.</p><p>A year ago, the idea of networking our notes with bi-directional links became the biggest thing in the <span id="undefined" data-source="{&quot;text&quot;:&quot;tools&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Productivity Tools&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:&quot;105&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;/c/productivity-tools&quot;}"><a href="https://every.to/c/productivity-tools">tools</a></span> for thought space since Vannevar Bush described the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memex" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">memex</a>. Top-down hierarchies and tag systems became the <a href="https://every.to/superorganizers/beware-of-pet-explanations" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">pet explanation</a> du jour for everything that was wrong with <span id="undefined" data-source="{&quot;text&quot;:&quot;note-taking&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Note-taking&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:&quot;104&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;/c/note-taking&quot;}"><a href="https://every.to/c/note-taking">note-taking</a></span>. So we all hustled on to the Double-Bracket Express determined to build our own networked knowledge graphs. But where did we actually go? At least for me—and most of the people I know—we got a garbage dump full of crufty links and pieces of text we hardly ever revisit. And we feel guilty and sad about it.</p><p><a href="https://d24ovhgu8s7341.cloudfront.net/uploads/editor/posts/2032/optimized_4OCp4GMkdM0zVMMOvrDr48_dbAqXZN_dlOnLVH3IdTwcLnaQZA0R4NMpHCx4g7rWZu_5VM30xWAKHMwVKsSGrJBm08tozembK6_kL8zxeQ_lKViNrv5TcHmuYe_16G9tw1ETjxh5.png?link=true" target="_blank"><img src="https://d24ovhgu8s7341.cloudfront.net/uploads/editor/posts/2032/optimized_4OCp4GMkdM0zVMMOvrDr48_dbAqXZN_dlOnLVH3IdTwcLnaQZA0R4NMpHCx4g7rWZu_5VM30xWAKHMwVKsSGrJBm08tozembK6_kL8zxeQ_lKViNrv5TcHmuYe_16G9tw1ETjxh5.png"></a></p><p><em>(It is a very appealing looking garbage dump, however.)</em></p><p>There are probably a host of reasons why this happened: Roam’s product velocity seems to be incredibly slow, there still isn’t really a good mobile experience, they’ve had well-documented community issues—the list goes on.</p><p>But there’s one main reason that I don’t use it anymore:</p><p>When I write my notes the thought, ‘Where am I going to put this?<em>’</em> plagues me every time. It’s a direct and immediate pain. And it sometimes gets in the way of me even taking notes at all. I have this sensation many times a day and it’s deeply uncomfortable.&nbsp;</p><p>Roam’s job was to get rid of that pain. And it did—for a while. But now it’s back.</p><p>.&nbsp; &nbsp; .&nbsp; &nbsp; .</p><p>The core idea that caught on with Roam is the concept of a bidirectional link. Previous note-taking systems allowed linking in only one direction: you could link from one note to another, but the note being linked to had no automatic link back to the original note.</p><p>Bi-directional linking, by contrast, creates a link from the first note to the second, and from the second to the first automatically. Roam made this extremely easy to accomplish—just by typing pieces of your notes in [[ brackets ]] you could link between notes, and even create new ones if the note you were linking to didn’t already exist.</p><p>The idea was to create a highly-networked system of notes with lots of links between them. By doing so, you could increase serendipitous encounters with old notes, and decrease your risk of losing a note, and generally get more out of the whole note-taking experience, or indeed life itself:</p><p>I believed that if I used it, I’d learn more from my experiences because I wouldn’t forget them. I’d take away more lessons from the books I’d read because I’d always have them close at hand. I’d make better decisions, produce better writing, and maybe my hair would even start to look as lustrous as Conor’s.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://d24ovhgu8s7341.cloudfront.net/uploads/editor/posts/2032/optimized_aPJ0I4WAbRihoGai9e_Mwxutin-ZafX-Ri6D8aPyblW9MReyFzlAnybhUUDSwJXfcjmiraQDULsEnx3TyQHt47DuCG0xpTZWfgdEWPEc7usCFE7TtVOAQSZHg-mH-zBhjUTbcoLu.png?link=true" target="_blank"><img src="https://d24ovhgu8s7341.cloudfront.net/uploads/editor/posts/2032/optimized_aPJ0I4WAbRihoGai9e_Mwxutin-ZafX-Ri6D8aPyblW9MReyFzlAnybhUUDSwJXfcjmiraQDULsEnx3TyQHt47DuCG0xpTZWfgdEWPEc7usCFE7TtVOAQSZHg-mH-zBhjUTbcoLu.png"></a></p><p><a href="https://d24ovhgu8s7341.cloudfront.net/uploads/editor/posts/2032/optimized_MRMZ-LxVxMkNfzEHFpV4QH2RjYrnNYfiSTqOiQtkHEBx-51CJ7RjYYT3VUgQwyhF7T0xev6CnZWbekZDJkdcn30dZN5H8neqZNpGI5piJ0P5qclVx94f8YenZlozhxxupPnzi1y5.png?link=true" target="_blank"><img src="https://d24ovhgu8s7341.cloudfront.net/uploads/editor/posts/2032/optimized_MRMZ-LxVxMkNfzEHFpV4QH2RjYrnNYfiSTqOiQtkHEBx-51CJ7RjYYT3VUgQwyhF7T0xev6CnZWbekZDJkdcn30dZN5H8neqZNpGI5piJ0P5qclVx94f8YenZlozhxxupPnzi1y5.png"></a></p><p><em>(Side-by-side comparison.

If I plotted out the percent of my time writing bidirectional links vs. actually looking at my notes and clicking through the links in them, this is what I estimate it would look like:</p><p><a href="https://d24ovhgu8s7341.cloudfront.net/uploads/editor/posts/2032/optimized_rB6vgjRjXQWNu0DgRZStEDc_6vgzNoWnrHIWIehzQKuLanjM3qeqC1AQOAYA2rgvMCEmPh0kq-92_xNnBdpsxCJix5O0FWH7L95iR5W_NKmGNR_Sd-4IptTl475JMHyuHjA4RRIG.png?link=true" target="_blank"><img src="https://d24ovhgu8s7341.cloudfront.net/uploads/editor/posts/2032/optimized_rB6vgjRjXQWNu0DgRZStEDc_6vgzNoWnrHIWIehzQKuLanjM3qeqC1AQOAYA2rgvMCEmPh0kq-92_xNnBdpsxCJix5O0FWH7L95iR5W_NKmGNR_Sd-4IptTl475JMHyuHjA4RRIG.png"></a></p><p>It turns out that I am rarely in a position, while writing or thinking, where I want to glance through lots of old notes as a way to figure out what to say or do. Mostly that feels like sifting through stale garbage.&nbsp;</p><p>My most common behavior is to Actually Write the Notes. That’s why Roam needs to help me with the thought, ‘I don’t know where to put this.<em>’</em> If it does that well, it makes the vast majority of my time spent in the app a breeze. If it does that poorly, it makes my experience so painful that I want to switch systems.&nbsp;</p><p>The genius of bi-directional linking is that when I first started to use it, the neurotic hamster in my head decided to turn down the volume knob on the ‘Where should I put this?<em>’</em> question.&nbsp;</p><p>Why? Bidirectional linking is a very good story. Roam’s job is to make me believe that if I just surround pieces of my notes like this [[ ]] I won’t really have to worry about finding the note again. It’s now networked! The need to take notes far outstripped the need to review them (see: graph above), so Roam solved my problem.&nbsp;</p><p>After some time though, reality started to sink in. ‘I am not really going back through all of these notes as often as I thought I would.<em>’</em> My next automatic assumption is that if they were just organized better I might go through them more. And so, the question starts to creep in again. ‘Where should I put this?<em>’</em></p><p>Once I’m back to thinking this way, all sorts of other problems that I have with Roam start to creep in. ‘Where is the mobile app?’ And, ‘why doesn’t it feel like the product is improving? And, ‘why does everything feel like a mess?’<em> </em>All of these problems were present, but none were important so long as I believed Roam was solving my core issue. But now that it’s not,<em> </em>suddenly, point-solution alternatives like Apple Notes and Things start to feel appealing. And the whole thing unravels.</p><p>I used to use Roam for lots of things: a daily diary, book notes, keeping track of lists like my todo list, and taking meeting notes.</p><p>Today, this is my stack:</p><ul>
<li>
<strong>Daily Diary</strong> / paper notebook</li>
<li>
<strong>Book Notes</strong> / split between Roam and Muse</li>
<li>
<strong>To-do List</strong> / Things</li>
<li>
<strong>Meeting Notes</strong> / Apple Notes</li>
</ul><p>The whole thing moved away from Roam because I started to worry again about where to put things.</p><p>This might seem trivial, or useless, or reductive. But it is actually quite valuable. If we're really using Roam to regulate the emotional experience of not knowing where to put a note, then that suggests a lot of product changes Roam could make to perform better at that job.&nbsp;</p><p>.&nbsp; &nbsp; .&nbsp; &nbsp; .</p><h2>Search</h2><p>The easiest way for Roam to fix this would be to improve&nbsp; the search function. If I believe that I can find anything again with the right search query, the neurotic hamster in my brain gets less bent out of shape about where I will put the note.</p><p>But right now, searching in Roam feels like a claustrophobic mess:</p><p><a href="https://d24ovhgu8s7341.cloudfront.net/uploads/editor/posts/2032/optimized_77p4eVvk1LF1qsDm-KgDQooChAFeL70WeZqSkc9DEUe4g66NHT-1JFWL7wZ6t5bCmgZihMLX3Zm1cCKnbWpORt07bnqTXZNMnqPYOIc-5gL161aXUqPUVzpZwtyUsm2yFgRt7kac.png?link=true" target="_blank"><img src="https://d24ovhgu8s7341.cloudfront.net/uploads/editor/posts/2032/optimized_77p4eVvk1LF1qsDm-KgDQooChAFeL70WeZqSkc9DEUe4g66NHT-1JFWL7wZ6t5bCmgZihMLX3Zm1cCKnbWpORt07bnqTXZNMnqPYOIc-5gL161aXUqPUVzpZwtyUsm2yFgRt7kac.png"></a></p><p>The first result is a gigantic paragraph of text, with <em>zero</em> context attached to it to help me understand where it comes from or why it might be relevant. Same thing if I continue scrolling:</p><p><a href="https://d24ovhgu8s7341.cloudfront.net/uploads/editor/posts/2032/optimized_MtTuTLpPUBUD7yLiyfGFggnT42FEyIfWj3oHkDeHT_YC2jWU1LHiNiXMCt1hB45mCQdGUR1MRSK5RaKSGd5F8dNyT-jJW1ugcgy4riB3nPhNeIOZOjeVN6Ugd1ePE2SOAQse6UkM.png?link=true" target="_blank"><img src="https://d24ovhgu8s7341.cloudfront.net/uploads/editor/posts/2032/optimized_MtTuTLpPUBUD7yLiyfGFggnT42FEyIfWj3oHkDeHT_YC2jWU1LHiNiXMCt1hB45mCQdGUR1MRSK5RaKSGd5F8dNyT-jJW1ugcgy4riB3nPhNeIOZOjeVN6Ugd1ePE2SOAQse6UkM.png"></a></p><p>If I’m looking for one quote in particular, I might be able to scroll through this pretty quickly to find what I want. But it’s not easy to combine search terms together, or do anything like a fuzzy search to get me closer to what I want in case something is misspelled:</p><p><a href="https://d24ovhgu8s7341.cloudfront.net/uploads/editor/posts/2032/optimized_5uvc8lE5PZD6aSTKKBmIPrIMfVFOilTR1z2_QtAANPkCsky-JBotr25In6EvIE4yd_xOxb8AxVNm2OYJmhjyh1ybAmnNYtNt4luyYN9xi8OdpvI8pgFs0r-QjaTyhvhpSoxp0YZW.png?link=true" target="_blank"><img src="https://d24ovhgu8s7341.cloudfront.net/uploads/editor/posts/2032/optimized_5uvc8lE5PZD6aSTKKBmIPrIMfVFOilTR1z2_QtAANPkCsky-JBotr25In6EvIE4yd_xOxb8AxVNm2OYJmhjyh1ybAmnNYtNt4luyYN9xi8OdpvI8pgFs0r-QjaTyhvhpSoxp0YZW.png"></a></p><p>The same kind of search works <em>way</em> better in Apple Notes, and the interface is cleaner. So I’m much more likely to use it.</p><h2>Automated Taxonomy</h2><p>Of course, search doesn’t solve all problems. As I wrote about in <a href="https://every.to/superorganizers/the-notetaking-cold-war-591898" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Notetaking Cold War</a>, part of the point of bi-directional linking is to create a bottoms-up taxonomy of your ideas, to be able to create an infinitely flexible <span id="undefined" data-source="{&quot;text&quot;:&quot;organizational&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Organization&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:&quot;278&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;/c/organization&quot;}"><a href="https://every.to/c/organization">organizational</a></span> system that changes as your uses for the information you’ve collected change.</p><p>I think there’s a lot of value in Roam’s language-like flexibility. But it’s also really clear to me that most people take notes about a few kinds of things:</p><ul>
<li>People</li>
<li>Meetings</li>
<li>Books</li>
<li>Companies</li>
<li>Tasks</li>
<li>Projects</li>
</ul><p>There are probably a few more—basically all kinds of proper nouns. Surrounding your proper nouns manually with double brackets just feels like a waystation on the road to creating an automated taxonomy and discovery system for notes. There’s no fundamental reason why the Photos app on my phone should be able to automatically compile a pleasing slideshow with music about a road trip I took 6 years ago, while my note-taking app can’t do the same thing.</p><p>Of course, this is a huge challenge in itself. There are many reasons automated note organization and discovery is harder than the same thing for photos. For examples, here is a randomly selected photo from my camera roll:</p><p><a href="https://d24ovhgu8s7341.cloudfront.net/uploads/editor/posts/2032/optimized_2mzuGZWIilIJYHVntQjdTET9b1AW-vXbMDx4zckgmzHbtX5lyYuxnE2sYb8CSvRHXDOZ_7oP5rKKtq9m_KJp1QRwPlkuYGWzO8U-EvrKB_ARIJ74rxf-PcGarPKi-YDSmQDRDYm9.jpeg?link=true" target="_blank"><img src="https://d24ovhgu8s7341.cloudfront.net/uploads/editor/posts/2032/optimized_2mzuGZWIilIJYHVntQjdTET9b1AW-vXbMDx4zckgmzHbtX5lyYuxnE2sYb8CSvRHXDOZ_7oP5rKKtq9m_KJp1QRwPlkuYGWzO8U-EvrKB_ARIJ74rxf-PcGarPKi-YDSmQDRDYm9.jpeg"></a></p><p>Seriously, that was random. Instant dopamine hit. Stick a better filter on it and it would be even better. Here’s a randomly selected note from my Roam:</p><ul>
<li>[[Interstitial Journal]]</li>
<li>{{[[DONE]]}} Get out Talk Therapy</li>
<li>{{[[DONE]]}} Digest edits</li>
<li>{{[[TODO]]}} Read</li>
<li>{{[[TODO]]}} Write for an hour</li>
<li>{{[[TODO]]}} Nap</li>
</ul><p>First, it’s incomprehensible. I have to load a lot of context into my brain to understand it. But once I do, it’s a snooze. Even if we somehow limited our selection to notes that actually have interesting content, it doesn’t fare much better. Here’s another random note:</p><p>“Well, we found that when she went back to the very source of a symptom and described it all to me, then that symptom disappeared on its own—with no need for any hypnotic suggestion——"&nbsp;</p><p>This quote is interesting, but I have to remember a lot in order to figure out <em>why</em> I thought it was interesting in the first place. And I could’ve looked at 10 photos in the meantime.</p><p>Of course, this could be solved by a better note-taking system on my part. Something closer to the <a href="https://every.to/superorganizers/forget-forgetting-build-a-zettelkasten-299960" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">actual Zettelkasten ideal</a> that I’d like to strive for. But ideally, the software helps where I fall down.</p><p>So in order for Roam to truly solve my ‘Where should I put this?’<em> </em>question, it would need to both be able to find the right note for me at the right time (difficult) but also be able to show me the right portion of it in the right way so that I can instantly feel a *click* and know why it’s relevant (much harder).</p><h2>What’s Next</h2><p>It gives me zero pleasure to write about why Roam isn’t working for me anymore. It should be noted, it’s also easier to play Monday Morning quarterback on this kind of thing than it is to actually build the product. I hope they figure it out—but mostly I hope that <em>someone</em> figures it out.</p><p>The underlying genius of Roam is that it is structured not like a tool, but like a programming language. <a href="https://every.to/superorganizers/the-notetaking-cold-war-591898" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">It’s based on the insight that the best way to organize information depends on how you’re going to use it</a>, and that information can be used in an infinite number of ways. So having an infinitely flexible organization system—like a programming language—is the best foundation for a note-taking system.</p><p>As I wrote about 2 years ago in the <a href="https://every.to/superorganizers/the-opportunity-in-productivity-621007" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Opportunity in Productivity</a>, I still have a feeling that the way forward lives in more <span id="undefined" data-source="{&quot;text&quot;:&quot;automation&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Productivity&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:&quot;2&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;/c/productivity&quot;}"><a href="https://every.to/c/productivity">automation</a></span>. Even programming languages have IDEs that automate and autocomplete many of the mundane tasks of programming. Hell, with <a href="https://copilot.github.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">CoPilot</a>, they’re even starting to program for you now. </p><p>It’s time our notes do the same thing.</p>

<h4><em>$30 Homebrew Automated Blinds Opener</em></h4>
</center>
<p>
<a href="https://sifter.org/~simon/journal/ims/20240718/closeup.jpg"><img src="https://sifter.org/~simon/journal/ims/20240718/closeup.jpg"></a></p>
<p>
In the spirit of my <a href="https://sifter.org/~simon/journal/20210531.html">thermostat</a> and <a href="https://sifter.org/~simon/journal/20200706.html">dishwasher controller</a>,
I managed to cobble together a decent blinds opener in a short weekend almost entirely from spare parts on
hand.  This design is very much what I could do quickly with what I had, so probably not worth copying, but
perhaps it can be an inspiration.
</p>
<p>
It is intentionally the world's slowest blinds opener:  It's purpose is to open the blinds very gradually
(and silently!) in the morning (because at this latitude, natural sunrise is wayy too early this time of year).
Right now it takes about 8 minutes running at full speed, and can easily be slowed down just by running for,
say, 30 seconds at a time between pauses.
</p>
<p>
One key component is the silicone(?) motor mount, which I had previously salvaged from a dead
Phillips water flosser and happened to be close enough to the right size for the geared motor
I bought.  That's the one hard-to-find component, and not included in the cost breakdown.
The rest I very-quickly threw together in freecad and 3d printed for negligible cost.  Only the magnet cuff required
two takes (magnet was too loose) -- the rest I lucked out and got right on the first go.  So
the whole thing came together in a day and a half including software (helped that it only took
minutes to integrate into <a href="https://sifter.org/~simon/journal/20240412.html">my home automation system</a>).
</p>
<p>
In the order I designed/printed things:
</p>
<p>
The cuff (and cap) that holds the magnet to the motor's butt (note this does <em>not</em> rotate
with the motor shaft--it only measures the small rotation of the whole motor within the silicone
mount shown below, from which we can infer the torque and detect when the blinds are closed).  Ignore
the other water flosser guts in the background:
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://sifter.org/~simon/journal/ims/20240718/cuff.jpg"><img src="https://sifter.org/~simon/journal/ims/20240718/cuff.jpg"></a></p>
<p>
The mount that holds the motor and encoder.  Chose to solder the wires on the encoder so I didn't have to worry about push-connectors vibrating loose:
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://sifter.org/~simon/journal/ims/20240718/mount.jpg"><img src="https://sifter.org/~simon/journal/ims/20240718/mount.jpg"></a></p>
<p>
Two double-throw relays.  The motor terminals go to the center, and +5v and ground go to the NO and NC respectively.  In
that config, one relay runs the motor forward, and the other reverse.  And if you accidentally have both on at the same
time, it just connects both motor terminals to 5v, which is harmless:
</p>
<p>

<p>
The mount above has an extra ridge (not really visible) which slots into this wall bracket:

<a href="https://sifter.org/~simon/journal/ims/20240718/bracket.jpg"><img src="https://sifter.org/~simon/journal/ims/20240718/bracket.jpg"></a></p>
<p>
I tossed a box over the electronics until I have the time to make a more aesthetic cover for the whole shebang:

<a href="https://sifter.org/~simon/journal/ims/20240718/installed.jpg"><img src="https://sifter.org/~simon/journal/ims/20240718/installed.jpg"></a></p>
<p>
The whole design ended up shockingly simple.   I thought I might need more components, but the 12v motor
runs fine (and quietly!) on 5v and only draws about 50mA, and the encoder has pull-up resistors (for I2C)
built in, and the relays work fine w/3.3v signals on 5v power, so it was truly just a matter of wiring
everything together using the 5v and 3.3v pins of the ESP to tap power from the USB.

</p>
<p>
I connected the motor to the blinds wand with some surgical tubing (and some other random
flexy tubing I had to pad the motor shaft up a bit) which mostly worked (and helps maintain
vibration isolation for noise), but it's not quite strong enough to really cinch the blinds
tight at the end so I wrapped a few turns of silicone tape over that and then some blue tape
just to cover up the sticky.  Probably this would have been better solved with one more layer
of a larger diameter tubing, but I didn't have any on hand.
</p>
<p>
The other issue is, not surprisingly, the motor doesn't just rotate around its axis within
its mount, it twists in various ways which move the magnet off-center from the encoder,
which the encoder really doesn't like.  The result is very non-monotonic (bad) and path-dependent
(surprising, and very bad), <em>but</em> there was enough signal coming through I was still
able to ballpark the torque and get it to shut off when the blinds are the right amount of
tight.  (And for opening them it's easy -- just run for 8 minutes and that puts them pretty
reliably at mid position.)
</p>
<p>
Here at 7000 seconds, the blinds are cinched closed, and then I opened them a bit:

<p>
So I would <em>not</em> recommend the magnetic encoder approach.  I just used it because
I bought a 5 pack a while back and never used them.  But I <em>do</em> like the torque
as the main feedback mechanism, since it's the most important thing to know:  You really
do want it to stop if the torque goes high, no matter the reason.  And once you have that,
you can detect the closed position (in either direction) by "feel", and can find intermediate
positions well enough just with timing.  Not sure how else I could (so easily) measure the
torque, though--if you have any suggestions, let me know.
</p>
<p>
With the soft mount, the motor vibration is totally isolated, and it all runs nearly
silently.  The relays are a bit loud, but the box muffles them pretty well, and right
now there's just one faint click when it first turns on.  The blinds themselves creak
a bit when they're turned this slow, but quieter than typical rain sounds.  Right now
the occasional creaking of the blinds is the only way I even know it's running--it's
that quiet!
</p>
<p>
So now I just send a target percent-open to my blinds on my HA network (or push the
open or close button I added to my phone panel), and there they go.
(And by default they close at dusk and open at desired-dawn.)
</p>
<p>
Not bad for a short-weekend project.  (Though just gathering the photos, links, and writing this entry has extended that into a long-weekend.  Ugh.)

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><blockquote><p>"You can’t really know where you are going until you know where you have been." - Maya Angelou. </p></blockquote><p>The age-old mission to capture and make sense of our knowledge and experiences echoes through history, from Thomas Jefferson's Commonplace book detailing his ideas on government to Marcus Aurelius's Meditations saturated with quotations and personal reflections.</p><p>However, this pursuit to preserve knowledge isn't without its own set of fears. Are our deepest thoughts private? Are we spending a disproportionate time customizing our notes system than benefiting from it? Will our preferred notes system last the sands of time? </p><p>These were the questions that motivated me to step outside conventional offerings and build my own solution. I'm sharing my story here not to prescribe, but to demonstrate it's okay to color outside the lines. Perhaps my journey to create a simple, secure, and lasting 'note vault' will spark ideas for how you can better cultivate your own knowledge garden.</p><h2 id="conventional-knowledge-gardens"><span>Conventional<!-- --> </span><span>knowledge<!-- --> </span><span>gardens<!-- --> </span></h2><p>A personal knowledge management systems (PKMS), also known as "second brain" is are central repositories for actively collecting one's meaningful insights, ideas and inspirations encountered throughout life. The benefit of decades of notes accruing and reinforcing knowledge is immense. That is why critically analyzing what you need your PKMS to achieve is crucial. </p><p>The most commonly used PKMS or note-taking apps today are Notion, Obsidian, Evernote and Logseq. The problem is that PKMS come and go. Could you see yourself using your note-taking app you use today in 30 years? Probably not. Do you ever have concerns around the privacy of your notes? Are you spending more time setting up your notes system rather than managing your notes? What does an effective and timeless PKMS even look like?</p><h2 id="pulling-at-a-thread"><span>Pulling<!-- --> </span><span>at<!-- --> </span><span>a<!-- --> </span><span>thread<!-- --> </span></h2><p>My PKMS journey started with Obsidian. For those unfamiliar with Obsidian, it's a digital notebook that lives only on your computer. Its special feature is letting you internally link related notes together similar to Wikipedia. Beyond linking, its true power comes from the huge range of plugins. Out of all the great community plugins, Dataview is my personal favorite. <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://obsidian.rocks/dataview-in-obsidian-a-beginners-guide/">Dataview</a> is a powerful scripting tool which pulls data from markdown notes to generate tables, graphs, and other insights.</p><p>Obsidian was a great tool for me personally for a long time. But I felt frustrated when I wanted to access my notes on my phone while on-the-go and saw that I had to pay for this feature. Obsidian charges $8 a month to access the same notes across multiple devices. While not a huge amount for such a useful app, it adds up to an eye-watering amount - almost $1,000 if I planned to use Obsidian for a decade. I was surprised at this fee because I thought Obsidian was open-source. I later realized that the Obsidian community plugins are open-source, but Obsidian itself is, in fact, not. These were the same plugins I was spending an inordinate abount of time <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://github.com/s-blu/obsidian_dataview_example_vault/blob/b6740b4d8a7e0b408669563e1b3c4028df36e207/20%20Dataview%20Queries/Show%20a%20Goals%20Overview%20with%20progress%20bars%20for%20included%20projects%20and%20overall%20progress.md">personalizing Obsidian with</a>, rather than being productive.</p><p>I started to have concerns about the longevity of the plugins and app itself. Some of you may remember when Evernote aggressively limited free users to <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://henry-chong.com/blog/the-downfall-of-evernote/">50 notes</a>, many users migrated their notes elsewhere. I was one of those users.</p><p>After some mental gymnastics weighing if I should continue with Obsidian, I found solace when asking myself <em>"Can I see myself using this in 20 years?"</em>. I couldn't. The thought of cyclically migrating notes from one PKMS to another every 5 years, as I had done from Evernote to Notion to Obsidian, made me feel tired. So I grabbed some coffee and began my search for the digital equivalent of the <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Svalbard_Global_Seed_Vault">Svalbard Global Seed Vault</a>, but for my notes.</p><h2 id="my-perfect-note-vault"><span>My<!-- --> </span><span>perfect<!-- --> </span><span>note<!-- --> </span><span>vault<!-- --> </span></h2><p>Key requirements were that my new PKMS needed to be easy to use, offer a plugin-like experience and be secure. Privacy and security were paramount. I didn't want my innermost thoughts being exposed to a <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/23andMe_data_leak">23andMe data leak</a> scenario. Data security aside, I have a hard time trusting for-profit companies will keep their hands out of the cookie jar. I can imagine there's a killing to be made from targeted advertisements online using your notes or for them to be used to train AI. I wanted to know with certainty that I control my data. Entrusting a company to store my notes for free, couldn't give me that assurance.</p><p>Being a full-stack software engineer, the answer was obvious. I should step outside the commercial-PKM ecosystem entirely - I should build my own.</p><p>But if it's so obvious, why aren't other developers rolling out their own PKMS? Perhaps I'm the first to discover this or perhaps developers aren't writing about their custom PKMS. My guess is that commercial note-taking apps have larger, more vocal communities that drown out the murmurings of other DIY solutions.</p><p>It was here I decided to pull the trigger to build and host my own PKMS. It felt pertinent to write about it so others feel confident to do so too. Spoiler - it sounds like a daunting feat, but in reality it was so comically easy my only regret is that I hadn't done it years ago.</p><h2 id="the-note-vault"><span>The<!-- --> </span><span>note<!-- --> </span><span>vault<!-- --> </span></h2><p>Here's how my PKMS looks as of writing. I can create a note, update it in markdown format and then preview what the note looks like in rendered markdown.</p><p><img alt="gif using the PKMS's markdown editor" src="https://notes.holeytriangle.com/assets/0f1cfdfb-ed3d-450e-8701-8ef7a9f2d7a5"></p><p>Finally, I can access my notes from my phone too, right where I left off. No monthly fees for this feature either.</p><p><img alt="Using the PKMS from my phone with a thumbs up sign" src="https://notes.holeytriangle.com/assets/e12f4587-b8a5-4739-9b16-7e925037ac9b"></p><p>Since my PKMS is hosted online to manage notes across devices, I have multiple layers of security to ensure my notes are kept private.</p><p><img alt="the PKMS's login screen with an empty form" src="https://notes.holeytriangle.com/assets/c42ab6b2-4eae-4956-b886-50d70aacba70"></p><p>And if I ever want to move to greener pastures, all my notes are stored in Markdown so I can export them with two command lines to my terminal. Here's an under-the-hood view of how my notes are stored in the database - just text! <a target="_self" rel="noreferrer" href="#1"><sup>1</sup></a></p><p><img alt="shows the markdown output from a database query" src="https://notes.holeytriangle.com/assets/2847aa38-5356-4e1d-80d9-feb5e738eee2"></p><h2 id="benefits-of-a-note-vault"><span>Benefits<!-- --> </span><span>of<!-- --> </span><span>a<!-- --> </span><span>note<!-- --> </span><span>vault<!-- --> </span></h2><p>I've found that consistently collecting and reviewing valuable information promotes a deeper engagement with ideas. As a result, I've noticed my memory improving, and I started seeing surprising links between seemingly unrelated topics. Plus, it's created this incredible record of my learning and personal growth.</p><p>I found Ryan Holiday's take on the <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://ryanholiday.net/how-and-why-to-keep-a-commonplace-book/">Commonplace Book</a> particularly insightful for efficiently using a PKM. While Ryan advocates for analog notes, the same principles can be applied to digital notes. While physical writing has its merits, digital notes provide superior search capabilities and flexible organization. Ryan himself states how impracticability of a physical PKMS - "Because mine is a physical box with literally thousands of cards, I don’t carry the whole thing with me". </p><p><img alt="Illustration featuring a system for filing notes" src="https://notes.holeytriangle.com/assets/85ba3989-f61c-4f4f-8764-b1f8c267cbaa"></p><p><small><center>Image sourced from Houghton Library, Public domain, via Wikimedia Commons</center></small></p><p>And that's the beauty of a digital PKMS – it all fits on my phone!</p><p>Additonally, now with AI code generation creating custom PKMS plugins are more accessible than ever before. No longer do we need to install a random developer's plugin that sends our private thoughts who knows where. We can vibe-code our own or use open-source tooling. I used to use an Obsidian plugin to pull uncompleted tasks from todo checklists that were scattered around various notes, but after 10 minutes of prompting Anthropic's Claude, I had my own private equivalent tool.</p><h2 id="a-look-inside"><span>A<!-- --> </span><span>look<!-- --> </span><span>inside<!-- --> </span></h2><p>Using essentially a wrapper around a database made creating my PKMS easy. This wrapper does the heavy lifting, keeping things simple and secure. I went with an open-source platform called <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://directus.io/">Directus</a>, which can be used as a PKMS amongst other things such as a CMS. Directus has authentication and security layers already included, so I was able to start using it in less than a day.</p><p>For readers who have worked with SQL databases or docker containers - I wrote a <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://amberwilliams.io/blogs/the-last-note-system">step-by-step guide on building my own PKMS with Directus</a>.</p><h2 id="a-final-note"><span>A<!-- --> </span><span>final<!-- --> </span><span>note<!-- --> </span></h2><p>I’ve always believed that, much like a garden, how we manage our own knowledge system needs cultivation and continuity to flourish. My own knowledge garden was cultivated from a deep dive into the subject of note systems, driven by a search for a solution to those nagging frustrations I think many of us feel with commercialized systems.</p><p>A knowledge garden isn't always straightforward, and I'll be the first to admit I’ve been guilty of spending considerably more time fiddling with a system, rather than actually using it. It's easy  to fall into analysis paralysis with these system as well as become plagued with paranoia worrying about privacy. So for any system to stick, it has to be genuinely secure and simple.</p><p>There isn't a one-size-fits-all approach to a sizeable amount of things in life, knowledge management being one of these. Inquisitive individuals are likely to be rewarded for exploring different avenues, even unconventional ones, as they lead to a system tailored to one's personal way of thinking and working.</p><p>The path I eventually took, building my own, put an end to exhausting cyclical migrations. It helped me reclaim control over my privacy, and significantly cut down on recurring costs. Especially because it's ran from <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://amberwilliams.io/blogs/vps-for-web-apps">my own VPS</a>. Commercial apps certainly offer out-of-the-box convenience, but by stepping back and focusing on what mattered to me, I found a way that worked profoundly better. <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://amberwilliams.io/blogs/the-last-note-system">Here's how I built my PKMS step-by-step</a>. </p><p>After dogfooding my PKMS for over a year now, I'm capturing and connecting ideas more efficiently than I ever managed with commercial apps. While I sometimes miss the community around commercial apps, I'm hopeful I'll find a niche community of like minded individuals one day. </p><p>If my PKMS journey has resonated with you, or if you're on a similar path, I'd genuinely love to connect. You can find me at any of the socials in the footer.</p><hr>

<p dir="auto">This started as a personal challenge to figure out what modern NLP could tell us about the Voynich Manuscript — without falling into translation speculation or pattern hallucination. I'm not a linguist or cryptographer. I just wanted to see if something as strange as Voynichese would hold up under real language modeling: clustering, POS inference, Markov transitions, and section-specific patterns.</p>
<p dir="auto">Spoiler: it kinda did.</p>
<p dir="auto">This repo walks through everything — from suffix stripping to SBERT embeddings to building a lexicon hypothesis. No magic, no GPT guessing. Just a skeptical test of whether the manuscript has <em>structure that behaves like language</em>, even if we don’t know what it’s saying.</p>

<p dir="auto">The Voynich Manuscript remains undeciphered, with no agreed linguistic or cryptographic solution. Traditional analyses often fall into two camps: <em>statistical entropy checks</em> or <em>wild guesswork</em>. This project offers a middle path — using computational linguistics to assess whether the manuscript encodes real, structured language-like behavior.</p>

<p dir="auto">One of the most important assumptions I made was about how to handle the Voynich words before clustering. Specifically: I stripped a set of recurring suffix-like endings from each word — things like aiin, dy, chy, and similar variants. The goal was to isolate what looked like root forms that repeated with variation, under the assumption that these suffixes might be:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Phonetic padding</li>
<li>Grammatical particles</li>
<li>Chant-like or mnemonic repetition</li>
<li>Or… just noise</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">This definitely improved the clustering behavior — similar stems grouped more tightly, and the transition matrix showed cleaner structural patterns. But it's also a strong preprocessing decision that may have:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Removed actual morphological information</li>
<li>Disguised meaningful inflectional variants</li>
<li>Introduced a bias toward function over content</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">So it’s not neutral — it helped, but it also shaped the results.
If someone wants to fork this repo and re-run the pipeline without suffix stripping — or treat suffixes as their own token class — I’d be genuinely interested in the comparison.</p>

<p>Building my childhood dream PC</p><hr>
 

<!-- <p>When I first got involved with the PC scene, in 1993, the machine I desperately wanted was an IBM PS/1 2168.</p> -->
<p>In 1993, I was 14 and already passionate about computers<a name="back_1" href="#footnote_1"><sup>[1]</sup></a>. That year my mother managed to buy a PC for the household. That was quite an effort for a single mother. My brother Aurelien and I spent every waking hour on this machine, staying up all night on weekends.</p>

<p>Discovering the architecture of the PC, learning to program it, exploring how to manage its memory with <code>CONFIG.SYS</code> and <code>AUTOEXEC.BAT</code>, installing isa cards, drawing with Deluxe Paint, and of course playing games like Dune II, Syndicate, or Day of the Tentacle was so much fun. That time period sets us both on a trajectory towards prolific engineering careers.</p>


<p> One year later we found out the Conforama salesman had tricked us. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyrix_Cx486SLC">Cyrix 486SLC-25Mhz</a> he sold us was just a 386 which could <a href="https://fabiensanglard.net/2168/sc_flies_on_dx2.webp">barely run</a> games like DOOM and Strike Commander in stamp size at minimal details level. Of course the neighbor had an IBM PS/1 2168 486DX2-66Mhz where these games ran butter-smooth at 25fps.</p>

<img loading="lazy" src="https://fabiensanglard.net/2168/2168.webp" width="1000" height="598">

<p>That IBM PC was as gorgeous as it was insanely expensive. Adjusted to inflation it fetched close to $6,000. By the time I was old enough to pick up strawberries during the summer to make my own money, Big Blue had been defeated by PC clones. They exited the desktop market shortly after their Aptiva line flopped. I never got a chance to own that IBM<a name="back_2" href="#footnote_2"><sup>[2]</sup></a>.</p>

<p>During the winter of 2024 I went back in time and gave that 14-year-old the means to acquire his dream PC. This is the story of how I restored an IBM 2168 and maxed out DOOM.</p>

<p>A design screaming "excellence"</p><hr>
<p>Announced in March 1993<a name="back_3" href="#footnote_3"><sup>[3]</sup></a><a name="back_4" href="#footnote_4"><sup>[4]</sup></a>, the 2168 was part of IBM's 30-model line. While other models like the PS/1 2133 came in standard horizontal form-factor, the 2168 was a "Mini-Tower".</p>

<img loading="lazy" src="https://fabiensanglard.net/2168/ad.webp" width="1600" height="877">
<p> I loved the idea of having a handle on the top to make it easy to carry to LAN parties. This is a feature I have always enjoyed and contributed to my appreciation of later machines such as the <a href="https://fabiensanglard.net/fd_proxy/ssd/step6.webp">Apple Mac Pro 2009</a> and the <a href="https://fabiensanglard.net/2168/p620.webp">Lenovo ThinkStation P690</a>.</p>

<p>The user friendliness did not stop at the handle. Unlike many boxy PCs of the era, the PS/1 featured rounded corners on the monitor and system unit, giving it a softer, more approachable look.</p>


<img loading="lazy" src="https://fabiensanglard.net/2168/french.webp" width="721" height="472"> 
<p>The front panel was cleverly designed with a slider to hide the disgracious 5.25" floppy drive and CD drive while leaving the most frequently used 3½" FDD available. An optional grey base offered more stability while completing the signature IBM color palette made of beige, dark grey, and blue.</p>

<p>These many subtle touches made the IBM PS/1 2168 a polished product screaming <i>excellence</i><a name="back_5" href="#footnote_5"><sup>[5]</sup></a>.
</p>





<p>Clicky Keyboard</p><hr>
<p>Another immensely appealing aspect of the IBM PS/1 computer is that they usually came with 
what is considered by many the best keyboard of all time. The overall quality and unmistakable clicky sound of the model M re-enforced the impression of a rock solid, well-built computer.</p>

<img loading="lazy" src="https://fabiensanglard.net/2168/m.webp" width="1625" height="1139">
<p>Big blue even manufactured a Space Saving version (SSK) devoid of a keypad which I found even more beautiful than the full size model. I revisit the topic of the keyboard in another page but will leave the reader with <a href="https://www.clickykeyboards.com/">clickykeyboard.com</a> and the Wikipedia page<a name="back_6" href="#footnote_6"><sup>[6]</sup></a> to learn more.</p>

<div><p>8BitDo makes a fantastic modern keyboard inspired by the M looks and feel.</p><p><a href="https://fabiensanglard.net/2168/8bitdo.webp"><img loading="lazy" src="https://fabiensanglard.net/2168/8bitdo.webp" width="1920" height="1050"></a></p></div>



<p>Documentation</p><hr><p>While most clone PCs came with zero documentation, the IBM PS/1 featured stellar manuals explaining in detail how to maintain and upgrade the machine.</p>

<a href="https://fabiensanglard.net/2168/doc_example1.webp"><img loading="lazy" src="https://fabiensanglard.net/2168/doc_example1.webp" width="1940" height="1228"></a><br>
<a href="https://fabiensanglard.net/2168/doc_example2.webp"><img loading="lazy" src="https://fabiensanglard.net/2168/doc_example2.webp" width="1940" height="1238"></a><br>
<a href="https://fabiensanglard.net/2168/doc_example3.webp"><img loading="lazy" src="https://fabiensanglard.net/2168/doc_example3.webp" width="1940" height="1266"></a>











<p>Expandability</p><hr><p>Another advantage of these IBM PS/1 is that they were upgradable. Contrary to PC clones where everything was often soldered, these came with an Intel Overdrive socket to upgrade the CPU, and extra slots to increase the L1 cache, RAM, and VRAM.</p>

<img loading="lazy" src="https://fabiensanglard.net/2168/2168ad_clean.webp" width="655" height="488">

<p>Expandability via HDDs and ISA cards was provisioned from the ground up and indicated via the computer's codename. The 6 and 8 in 21<b>68</b> respectively refer to the available bays (6) and ISA expansion slots (8).</p>
<img loading="lazy" src="https://fabiensanglard.net/2168/68.webp" width="1290" height="821">
<p>Accordingly, the horizontal form factor PS/1 2133 had three (3) ISA slots and three (3) bays.</p>

<p>Finding a 2168</p><hr><p>As I embarked on the journey to acquire an IBM PS/1 2168 and restore it, it dawned on me this was going to be harder than originally envisioned.</p>

<p>Not only was I going after a thirty-year old machine which most models had been damaged, discarded, or plainly stopped working, I was also going after a popular model. As a proof of its sought-after status, I found many people proudly displaying their setup.</p>

<p>Some loved their machine so much they even kept the original, thirty-years-old receipt.</p>

<a href="https://fabiensanglard.net/2168/2168_fan3_receipt.webp"><img loading="lazy" src="https://fabiensanglard.net/2168/2168_fan3_receipt.webp" width="800" height="1024"></a>
<img loading="lazy" src="https://fabiensanglard.net/2168/2168_fan3.webp" width="800" height="528">
<p>In one particular instance one fan enjoyed the 2168 form-factor so much they <a href="https://au.pcpartpicker.com/b/vCHNnQ">gutted</a> the inside to replace it with modern components.</p>

<p>Beyond the problem introduced by scarcity, I upped the difficulty with two criteria.</p>

<ol>
  <li>I wanted a machine which could still boot.</li>
  <li>Having learned from Epictronics's series<a name="back_7" href="#footnote_7"><sup>[7]</sup></a><a name="back_8" href="#footnote_8"><sup>[8]</sup></a><a name="back_9" href="#footnote_9"><sup>[9]</sup></a><a name="back_10" href="#footnote_10"><sup>[10]</sup></a> that the motherboard frequency was not jumper-adjustable, I wanted a 33Mhz model. This limited the range further down to models with 486SX-33, 486DX-33, and 486DX2-66 CPUs.</li>
</ol>


<p>Crawling eBay</p><hr>
<p>As luck would have it, I found a PS/1 2168-594<a name="back_11" href="#footnote_11"><sup>[11]</sup></a> DX2-66Mhz within a week of searching. It was located in Finland and came with all the original boxes, manuals, and even the dark grey base. The listing showed the machine running Windows 3.1.</p>

<img loading="lazy" src="https://fabiensanglard.net/2168/ebay.webp" width="2826" height="1326">
<p> The seller had it in a lot with two CRTs (one broken, and one for PS/2) that I did not want. After a short negotiation we reached an agreement involving the central unit only.</p>

<p>Having the original box was almost as important as getting the PC. I explained this remote concept to the seller who eventually agreed not to slap a stamp on the PS/1 box. I payed and started praying the seller would pack it well.</p>

  <h2>
    <a href="https://dcurt.is/apple-card-can-disable-your-icloud-account">Apple Card disabled my iCloud, App Store, and Apple ID accounts</a>
  </h2>
	<p>About ten days ago, when I went to update a few apps in the App Store on my Mac, I was met with a curious error.</p>

<p><a href="https://svbtleusercontent.com/qest5zgsbPZ36zkUp7CHo40xspap.png"><img src="https://svbtleusercontent.com/qest5zgsbPZ36zkUp7CHo40xspap_small.png" alt="mac_app_store.png"></a></p>

<p>The internet is filled with stories from people whose Google accounts were locked for unexplained reasons, causing them to lose all of their data, including years of email, so I was somewhat concerned. But I’d never heard of similar cases involving Apple’s services, and I wouldn’t expect such behavior from a customer-focused company like Apple, so I figured it was a glitch and made a mental note to try again later.</p>

<p>The next day, Music.app stopped working.</p>

<p><a href="https://svbtleusercontent.com/oyQJaCT4RtgroGwU2afbHb0xspap.png"><img src="https://svbtleusercontent.com/oyQJaCT4RtgroGwU2afbHb0xspap_small.png" alt="mac_music_app.png"></a></p>

<p>Now I was genuinely worried. I checked my phone and neither the App Store nor Apple Music would work there, either. A few minutes later, Calendar popped up an error – it had stopped syncing. I immediately tried to call Apple Support from my Mac, but Apple’s Handoff feature had been disabled as well. </p>

<p>The first person I spoke to at Apple spent a while researching the issue and then told me there was nothing she could do but escalate the issue, and that I should expect a call <em>“hopefully”</em> within the next day. I asked what the problem might be, and she seemed as confused as I was. Although some Apple services were still working, like iMessage (thank God) and Photos, I was terrified that more services would suddenly become inaccessible or that I would lose the considerable amount of data I have stored in iCloud.</p>

<p>A couple of days later, I became impatient and contacted Apple Support again. This time, the representative mumbled something about Apple Card before saying that he also had no power to help me. Apple ID was a different department, he said, and they could only be contacted by email. He emailed them. I continued to wait.</p>

<p>The next time I tried to use my Apple Card, it was declined. Strange. I checked the Wallet app, and the balance was below the limit. I remembered the Apple support representative mumbling about Apple Card, so I did some digging through my email to see if I could find a connection.</p>

<hr>

<p>As it turns out, my bank account number changed in January, causing Apple Card autopay to fail. Then the Apple Store made a charge on the card. Less than fifteen days after that, my App Store, iCloud, Apple Music, and Apple ID accounts had all been disabled by Apple Card. </p>

<hr>
<h3 id="so-what-happened_3">So what happened? <a href="#so-what-happened_3">#</a></h3>
<p>In mid-January, I bought an M1 MacBook Pro. The checkout flow offered a trade-in credit for an old MacBook Pro I had laying around. The Apple Store said I would receive a “trade-in kit” by mail and then have two weeks to send the old MacBook to Apple. Sounds easy, and definitely a very Apple-like experience. </p>

<p>But the trade-in kit never arrived. I had forgotten about it. When I received an email in mid-February asking about the trade-in, I responded (as it had invited me to do) explaining that I never received the kit and asked for another one. I didn’t get a response.</p>

<p>Very soon after, it seems that Apple simply added the amount of the credit I received when I purchased the M1 MacBook Pro to my Apple Card balance. Normally, this wouldn’t be a problem. Imagine if I had used any other credit card – it would have just been an ordinary charge. But because it was the Apple Store and Apple Card, apparently, things escalated very quickly.</p>

<p>On February 15th, Apple sent me this email:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Action Required: Apple Card</strong></p>

<p>From: Apple <a href="mailto:payment@apple.com">payment@apple.com</a><br>
Reply-to: <a href="mailto:preceivables@apple.com">preceivables@apple.com</a></p>

<p>We’ve been unable to collect full payment for your new iPhone. As a result, we will block the device on the order from further access to the Apple iTunes and Mac App stores, and disable all accounts associated with the device purchased on the order.</p>

<p>To resolve this issue, please call 1-877-255-5923 to speak with an Apple Card Specialist at Goldman Sachs. Once the issue has been resolved, reply to this email so we can charge your card for the difference in value.</p>

<p>For your protection, do not submit credit card information via email.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It appears as though charges from Apple are special, and if your account is not 100% current, Apple will quickly take drastic action. Unfortunately, this email got lost in my inbox and I didn’t see it until I went looking. But it is extremely concerning for several reasons.</p>

<ul>
<li>Apple says it will hold my Apple accounts hostage in order to collect a payment.</li>
<li>It says it is related to an iPhone when it was actually regarding a MacBook Pro. And iTunes no longer exists. The lack of attention to detail is not great given the seriousness of the threat that follows.</li>
<li>It was sent when Apple Card was only a few days past due.</li>
<li>It suggests that charges by Apple on Apple Card are different from other purchases, and this can have serious consequences. (Also: the Apple Card agreement does not mention this technicality.)</li>
</ul>

<p>After fixing the Apple Card issue, I replied to the email as it says, and received this in response: </p>

<p><a href="https://svbtleusercontent.com/7SNnHHaXX7jK7ewzeX4WLC0xspap.png"><img src="https://svbtleusercontent.com/7SNnHHaXX7jK7ewzeX4WLC0xspap_small.png" alt="bounce.png"></a></p>

<p>Great. </p>

<p>By this point, Apple Support had been unable to help me – or to even identify the issue. My App Store, Apple Music, iCloud, and Apple ID accounts were disabled. Replying to the email as instructed resulted in a bounce. </p>

<p>So I used Apple Business Chat to talk with Goldman Sachs. The representative there seemed confused, asked me to wait for quite a while, and then said the only way to reactivate my Apple ID was for him to email a department at Apple and wait for a call back within “a few days”. </p>

<p>Earlier today, I received a call from someone at Apple who explained that I had found the right department – finally! – but that the Apple account re-activation team can only be contacted by email and the process takes <em>at least 3-5 business days</em>. He emailed them.</p>

<p>And now I am once again waiting. </p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> My accounts have been reactivated. </p>

    <p><span>

Jeffrey Yasskin recently </span><a href="https://hachyderm.io/@jyasskin/114520767683101962">pointed
out</a> an <a href="https://issues.chromium.org/issues/391788835">interesting
security bug</a>:

</p><p>

<a href="https://www.jefftk.com/google-logo-ligature-example-big.png"><img src="https://www.jefftk.com/google-logo-ligature-example.png" width="550" height="1152" srcset="https://www.jefftk.com/google-logo-ligature-example.png 550w,https://www.jefftk.com/google-logo-ligature-example-2x.png 1100w"></a></p>


<p>

The idea is, if you had registered <code>googlelogoligature.net</code>
then Chrome on Android (and possibly other Google products) would have
displayed it as <code>Google.net</code>, potentially tricking users
into thinking they were really interacting with Google.

</p>
<p>

To see how this worked, you can try searching Google for <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=%22googlelogoligature%22">["googlelogoligature"]</a>,
and you'll see it shows up as "Google":

</p>
<p>

<a href="https://www.jefftk.com/google-logo-ligature-devtools-big.png"><img src="https://www.jefftk.com/google-logo-ligature-devtools.png" width="550" height="376" srcset="https://www.jefftk.com/google-logo-ligature-devtools.png 550w,https://www.jefftk.com/google-logo-ligature-devtools-2x.png 1100w"></a></p>


<p>

Poking in devtools, this is dependent on the specific font they're
using, "Google Sans".  If I turn that off my "googlelogoligature"
shows just as I typed it:

</p>
<p>

<a href="https://www.jefftk.com/google-logo-ligature-devtools-off-big.png"><img src="https://www.jefftk.com/google-logo-ligature-devtools-off.png" width="550" height="376" srcset="https://www.jefftk.com/google-logo-ligature-devtools-off.png 550w,https://www.jefftk.com/google-logo-ligature-devtools-off-2x.png 1100w"></a></p>


<p>

Fonts can include "ligatures", which let font designers special-case
specific combinations of letters.  These were intended to support
things like "f" followed by "i" blending into "fi" nicely, but the
feature has been (ab)used for many other things, including <a href="https://type.today/en/journal/emoji01">complex emoji</a>.  In
this case, Google Sans has a specific way of drawing
"googlelogoligature" that looks like a mildly stylized "Google".

</p>
<p>

Using a ligature to get the Google logo into text-only interfaces is a
reasonable product decision, but it shouldn't have been added to a
general-purpose font.  And especially shouldn't have been added to a
font used for rendering attacker-controlled text in
security-sensitive contexts.

</p>
<p>

(When I first saw it I thought this might be an example of a <a href="https://www.jefftk.com/p/is-unicode-safe">unicode-driven
vulnerability</a>, but sadly not.)

<li>Display the mode on status line and set <code>'showmode'</code> to false. You can do this with some statusline plugin such as lualine.nvim.</li>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://rakhim.exotext.com/thank-you-google-for-breaking-my-youtube-addiction">https://rakhim.exotext.com/thank-you-google-for-breaking-my-youtube-addiction</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44020653">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <p>Over the past few years, Google has done a surprisingly great job of making YouTube less interesting and engaging — and in turn, less addictive. Maybe they've got some ethical guidelines in the top management now? If so, well done, Google.</p>
<p>Back in the day, when YouTube was mostly about your subscriptions, it was mildly addictive. You’d watch a C++ talk, and the sidebar would actually show you other useful C++ videos. It was relevant, and it kept you watching without feeling like you were drowning in content.</p>
<p>Then they introduced the algorithmic home feed, and that’s when things got intense. You’d open YouTube and get hit with an endless grid of videos tailored to your weird, eclectic mix of interests. Every refresh was like, “Oh, wow, more stuff I didn’t even know I wanted to watch!” It was like YouTube was infinite. </p>
<p>Now? Now it feels like YouTube is trying to bore us into logging off. The homepage just recycles the same 10-20 videos for weeks. It's like a kid in high school trying really hard to expand two sentences into a required 2-page essay by <a href="https://jayd.ml/2025/04/30/someone-at-youtube-needs-glasses.html">increasing the line height and font size</a>, and re-phrasing the same point over and over again.</p>
<p><img src="https://img.exotext.com/1/qcCGARM0puK0m-pSLhwkR.jpg" alt="">
<em>YouTube app on Apple TV feels particularly empty. The same few videos shuffled on each row.</em></p>
<p>Watch two bee videos, and suddenly YouTube decides you’re a bee person for life. Over a decade of watch history, interests, searches, playlists — none of that matters anymore. The user is into bees now. </p>
<p>The search now serves up a couple of videos from channels you've interacted with, prioritizing them over the actual relevance, throws in completely unrelated recommendations, and then sprinkles random Shorts on top. It’s like they’re trying to convince you there’s nothing good left to watch.</p>
<p><img src="https://img.exotext.com/1/PVnazyRa12Es4UyRKeozA.jpg" alt="">
<em>Interested in nautical route planning algorithms? Sure, but what about sexy girls and cars?</em></p>
<p>Honestly, it’s kind of brilliant. If you wanted to make YouTube less addictive, this is how you’d do it — by making it feel pointless and lame. So, thanks, Google. You're actually doing the "don't be evil" thing!</p>

<p dir="auto">BrowserBee is a privacy-first open source Chrome extension that lets you control your browser using natural language. It combines the power of an LLM for instruction parsing &amp; planning, and Playwright for robust browser automation to accomplish tasks.</p>
<p dir="auto">Since BrowserBee runs entirely within your browser (with the exception of the LLM), it can safely interact with logged-in websites, like your social media accounts or email, without compromising security or requiring backend infrastructure. This makes it more convenient for personal use than other "browser use" type products out there.</p>

<ol dir="auto">
<li><strong>Running Playwright in the browser.</strong> Playwright provides a robust and standard interface to LLMs for interacting with modern websites and web apps. Most "browser use" approaches I've come across like <a href="https://github.com/browser-use">Browser Use</a> and <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/playwright-mcp">Playwright MCP</a> are primarily designed for controlling a browser remotely in a backend service-browser fashion which is powerful for enterprise automations, whereas <a href="https://github.com/ruifigueira">@ruifigueira</a> has shown we can neatly wrap Playwright with a browser extension and reduce complexity for end-user use cases.</li>
<li><strong>"Reflect and learn" memory pattern.</strong> Certain setups are rich in feedback for AI agents. This is one of them, where the agent not only has a broad range of tools available to interact with the environment, but also has powerful observation abilities to understand the impact of its actions on the environment. For example, if the agent is tasked with completing a product purchase, where there is a good chance it's able to brute force its way to the end goal by using different tools (such as mouse and keyboard interactions), it can usually tell whether it has succeeded in the task or not by regularly taking screenshots. There is a valuable learning signal here for the agent and by invoking the agent to encode and memorise these learnings we can enhance future performance and increase efficiency on similar tasks, especially for smaller less capable models. In my limited testing, we can sometimes reduce the number of tokens needed (and therefore cost) for a task by 5x or more if we memorize the optimal tool sequence.</li>
<li><strong>Interacting with web pages remains a hard task for LLM-powered agents.</strong> DOMs and screenshots are complex, low-information-density modalities that are slow, expensive, and challenging to process for LLMs. Compare a web page to a piece code for instance: each token in a piece of code carries a lot more information on average than a token in an HTML page or pixels in a screenshot. Therefore we need a combination of cleverly simplified representations as well as cheaper/faster models for this type of product to become fully feasible.</li>
<li><strong>Why use an LLM at all?</strong>. The core value that an LLM agent can provide in this context is in <em>discovering</em> a path or a sequence of actions to accomplish a task which can then be encoded as a set of tool calls, or in fact plain JavaScript (see <a href="https://playwright.dev/docs/codegen" rel="nofollow">Playwright Codegen</a>); once a sequence is already known, it's trivial to follow - no LLM needed.</li>
<li><strong>Privacy-first personal AI tools are the way to go.</strong> There is no doubt that most of us will have some form of an always-on AI servant in the future, and I think the only way we can get there safely is through open source software that interacts transparently with our data and with LLMs. There is a lot of scope for building this type of software, and business models to support it (e.g. offering a hosted version), so I really hope to see and use more robust open source AI assistants.</li>

<h3 id="spaced-repetition-recap">Spaced repetition recap</h3>
<p>Mastering any subject is built on a foundation of knowledge: knowledge of facts, of heuristics, or of problem-solving tactics. If a subject is part of your full-time job, then you’ll likely master it through repeated exposure to this knowledge. But for something you’re working on part-time—like myself <a href="https://domenic.me/part-time-japanese">learning Japanese</a>—it’s very difficult to get that level of practice.</p>
<p>The same goes for subjects in school: a few hours of class or homework a week is rarely enough to build up an enduring knowledge base, especially in fact-heavy subjects like history or medicine. Even parts of your life that you might not think of as learning-related can be seen through this lens: wouldn’t all those podcasts and Hacker News articles feel more worthwhile, if you retained the information you gathered from them indefinitely?</p>
<p>Spaced repetition systems are one of the most-developed answers to this problem. They’re software programs which essentially display flashcards, with the prompt on the front of the card asking you to recall the information on the back of the card. You can read more about them <a href="https://notes.andymatuschak.org/Spaced_repetition_memory_system">in Andy’s notes</a>, or get a flavor from the images below drawn from my personal collection:</p>
<figure>
  <img src="https://domenic.me/images/fsrs-flashcard-sample-1-front.webp" width="912" height="1839" alt="A flashcard front containing the Japanese word 眼科医">
  <img src="https://domenic.me/images/fsrs-flashcard-sample-1-back.webp" width="912" height="1839" alt="A flashcard back containing the pronunciation of 眼科医, as well as its meaning and an example sentence">
  <img src="https://domenic.me/images/fsrs-flashcard-sample-2-front.webp" width="912" height="1839" alt="A flashcard front containing the prompt &quot;Number of neurons in a typical human brain&quot;">
  <img src="https://domenic.me/images/fsrs-flashcard-sample-2-back.webp" width="912" height="1839" alt="A flashcard back containing the answer &quot;86 billion&quot;">
</figure>
<p>What gives these programs their name is how they space out repeatedly prompting you to review the same card, depending on how you self-grade your response. Increasing intervals after correct answers prevents daily reviews from piling up. This is how you can, for example, learn 10 new second-language words a day (3,650 per year!) with only 20 minutes of daily review time.</p>
<p>(If you’re still unconvinced and have some time to spare, I suggest Michael Nielsen’s post <a href="https://augmentingcognition.com/ltm.html">Augmenting Long-term Memory</a>.)</p>
<h3 id="improving-the-scheduling-algorithm">Improving the scheduling algorithm</h3>
<p>So far, this is all well-known. But what’s less widely known is that a quiet revolution has greatly improved spaced repetition systems over the last couple of years, making them significantly more efficient and less frustrating to use. The magic ingredient is a new scheduling algorithm known as <a href="https://github.com/open-spaced-repetition/fsrs4anki/wiki/ABC-of-FSRS">FSRS</a>, by <a href="https://l-m-sherlock.github.io/">Jarrett Ye</a>.</p>
<p>To understand how these systems have improved, first let’s consider how they used to work. Roughly speaking, you’d get shown a card one day after creating it. If you got it right, you’d get shown it again after 6 days. If you get it right a second time, it’d be next scheduled for 15 days later. If you get the card right three times in a row, then it’s 37.5 days later. In general, after the 6-day interval, there’s an exponential backoff, defaulting to 6&nbsp;×&nbsp;2.5<sup>times&nbsp;correct&nbsp;+&nbsp;1</sup>. You can see how, if you keep getting the card right, this can lead to a large knowledge base, with only a small number of reviews per day!</p>
<p>But what if you get it wrong? Then, you’d reset back to day 1! You’d see the card again the next day, then 6 days after that, and so on. (Although missing the card can also adjust its “ease factor”, i.e. the base in the exponential that is by default set to 2.5.) This can be a fairly frustrating experience, as you experience a card ping-ponging between long and short intervals.</p>
<p>If we step back, we realize that this scheduling system (called “SuperMemo-2”) is pretty arbitrary. Where does the rule of 1, 6, 2.5<sup>times&nbsp;correct&nbsp;+&nbsp;1</sup>, reset back on failure come from? It turns out it was <a href="https://super-memory.com/english/ol/sm2.htm">developed by a college student in 1987</a> based on his personal experiments. Can’t we do better?</p>
<p>Recall <a href="https://github.com/open-spaced-repetition/fsrs4anki/wiki/Spaced-Repetition-Algorithm:-A-Three%E2%80%90Day-Journey-from-Novice-to-Expert#spaced-repetition">the theory behind spaced repetition</a>: we’re trying to beat the “forgetting curve”, by testing ourselves on the material “just before we were about to forget it”. It seems pretty unlikely that the forgetting curve for every single piece of knowledge is the same: that no matter what I’m learning, I’ll be just about to forget it after 1 day, then 6 more days, then 15, etc. And sure, we can throw in some modifications to the ease factor, but it’s still pretty unlikely that the ideal review schedule is a perfect exponential, even if you let the base vary a bit in response to feedback.</p>

<p>The insight of the FSRS algorithm is to concretize our goal (testing “just before we are about to forget”) as a prediction problem: <em>when does the probability of recalling a card drop to 90%?</em>. And this sort of prediction problem is something that machine learning systems excel at.</p>
<h3 id="some-neat-facts-about-how-fsrs-works">Some neat facts about how FSRS works</h3>
<p>The above insight—let’s apply machine learning to find the right intervals, instead of using an arbitrary formula—is the core of FSRS. You don’t really need to know how it works to benefit from it. But here’s a brief explanation of some of the details, since I think they’re cool.</p>
<p>FSRS calls itself a “three-component” model because it uses machine learning to fit curves for three main functions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Difficulty, a per-card number between 1 and 10 roughly representing how difficult the card is</li>
<li>Stability, which is how long a card takes to fall from 100% probability of recall to 90% probability of recall</li>
<li>Retrievability, which is the probability of recall after a given number of days</li>
</ul>
<p>For each card, it computes values for these based on <a href="https://github.com/open-spaced-repetition/fsrs4anki/wiki/The-Algorithm">various formulas</a>. For example, the retrievability curve has been <a href="https://expertium.github.io/Algorithm.html#r-retrievability">tweaked over time</a> from an exponential to a power function, to better fit observed data.</p>
<p>The curve-fitting is done using 21 parameters. These parameters start with values derived to fit the curves from tens of thousands of reviews people have previously done. But the best results are found when you run the FSRS optimizer over your own set of reviews, which will adjust the parameters to fit your personal difficulty/stability/retrievability functions. (This parameter adjustment is where the machine learning comes in: the parameter values <a href="https://github.com/open-spaced-repetition/fsrs4anki/wiki/The-mechanism-of-optimization">are found</a> using techniques you may have heard of, like maximum likelihood estimation and stochastic gradient descent.)</p>
<p>Although the core FSRS algorithm concerns itself with predicting these three functions, as a user what you care about is card scheduling. For that, FSRS lets you pick a desired retention rate, with a default of 90%, and then uses those three functions to calculate the next time you’ll see a card, after you review it and grade yourself.</p>
<p>But if you want, you can change this desired retention rate. And because FSRS has detailed models of how you retain information, with its difficulty/stability/retrievability functions, it can simulate what your workload will be for any given rate. The maintainers <a href="https://github.com/open-spaced-repetition/fsrs4anki/wiki/The-Optimal-Retention">suggest</a> that you set the desired retention to minimize your workload-to-knowledge ratio.</p>
<p>This can have fairly dramatic effects: below we see two simulations for my personal Japanese vocab deck, with the orange line being the default 90% desired retention, and the blue line being the 70% desired retention which FSRS has suggested I use to minimize the workload-to-knowledge ratio. The simulation runs for 365 days, adding 10 new cards per day as long as I have less than 200 reviews. As you can see, the 70% desired retention settings have dramatically fewer reviews per day, in less time, while ending with many more cards memorized (because it doesn’t hit the 200 card limit that caps new cards).</p>

<p>(Note that the 90% number used when calculating the stability function is not the same as desired retention. It’s just used to predict the shape of the forgetting curve. The <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3534678.3539081">original paper</a> used half-life, i.e. how long until the card reaches 50% probability of recall, since that’s more academic.)</p>
<h3 id="fsrs-in-practice">FSRS in practice</h3>
<p>If you want to use FSRS, instead of other <a href="https://github.com/open-spaced-repetition/srs-benchmark/blob/main/README.md#superiority">outperformed</a> algorithms, you have to use software that supports it. Thankfully, the leading spaced repetition software, <a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/">Anki</a>, has incorporated FSRS as its default scheduling algorithm since version 23.10, released in 2023-11. You might already be using it!</p>
<p>(The <a href="https://l-m-sherlock.notion.site/The-History-of-FSRS-for-Anki-1e6c250163a180a4bfd7fb1fee2a3043">story</a> of how it got into Anki, by the way, is pretty cool. The creator of FSRS, <a href="https://medium.com/@JarrettYe/how-did-i-publish-a-paper-in-acmkdd-as-an-undergraduate-c0199baddf31">an undergrad at the time</a>, posted on the Anki subreddit about his new algorithm. A commenter challenged him to go implement his algorithm in software, instead of just publishing a paper. He first implemented it as an Anki add-on, and its growing popularity eventually convinced the Anki developers to bring it into the core code!)</p>
<p>Subjectively, I’ve found FSRS to be a huge upgrade to my quality of reviews over the previous, SuperMemo-2–derived Anki algorithm. The review load is much lighter. The feeling of despair when missing a card is significantly minimized, since doing so no longer resets you back to day 1. And the better statistical modeling FSRS provides gives me much more confidence that the cards Anki counts me as having learned, are actually sticking in my brain.</p>
<p>For Japanese language learning specifically, the advantages of FSRS are even stronger when you compare them to the “algorithms” used by two popular subscription services. <a href="https://www.wanikani.com/">WaniKani</a>, a kanji/vocab-learning site, and <a href="https://bunpro.jp/">Bunpro</a>, a grammar-learning site, use <em>extremely</em> unfortunate algorithms, even worse than the 1, 6, 2.5<sup>times&nbsp;correct&nbsp;+&nbsp;1</sup> rule from SuperMemo-2. They instead have picked out other interval patterns, seemingly from thin air:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://knowledge.wanikani.com/wanikani/srs-stages/">For WaniKani</a>: 4 hours, 8 hours, 1 day, 2 days, 7 days, 14 days, 1 month, 4 months, never seen again</li>
<li><a href="https://community.bunpro.jp/t/bunpro-faq-frequently-asked-questions/876/1#heading--21">For Bunpro</a>: 4 hours, 8 hours, 1 day, 2 days, 4 days, 8 days, 2 weeks, 1 month, 2 months, 4 months, 6 months, never seen again</li>
</ul>
<p>These intervals don’t change per user or per card: they don’t even have an adjustable difficulty factor like the 2.5 base. And the idea that you’ll literally never see a card again after the last interval is terrifying, as it means you’re constantly losing knowledge.</p>
<p>But these aren’t even the worst part: the worst thing about these sites’ algorithms is that failing a card <em>moves it down one or two steps in the interval ladder</em>, instead of resetting to the first interval like SuperMemo-2, or predicting the best next interval using machine learning like FSRS. This greatly sabotages retention, wastes a lot of user time, and in general transforms these sites into a daily ritual of feeling bad about what you’ve forgotten, instead of feeling good about what you’ve retained. I wrote about this <a href="https://community.bunpro.jp/t/bunpros-bad-srs-algorithm-is-discouraging/90066">on the Bunpro forums</a> when I decided to ragequit about a year ago, in favor of Anki.</p>
<p>Stepping back, my takeaway from this experience is that Anki is king. People complain about how its UI is created by developers instead of designers, or how you have to find or make your own decks instead of using prepackaged ones. These are all fair complaints. But Anki is maintained by people who actually care about learning efficiently. It receives <a href="https://github.com/ankitects/anki/releases">frequent updates</a> that make it better at that goal. And it’s flexible enough to carry you through any stage of your knowledge-acquisition journey. Putting in the time to master it will provide a foundation that lasts you a literal lifetime.</p>
