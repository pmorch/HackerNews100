<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Future Motion, the maker of the Onewheel electric skateboard, is recalling every one of them, including 300,000 Onewheel self-balancing vehicles in the US. <a href="https://www.cpsc.gov/Recalls/2023/Future-Motion-Recalls-Onewheel-Self-Balancing-Electric-Skateboards-Due-to-Crash-Hazard-Four-Deaths-Reported">Alongside the US Consumer Product Safety Commission</a> (CPSC), the company now seeks to remedy the products after four known death cases — three without a helmet — between 2019 and 2021.</p><p>The recall comes a year after Future Motion took issue with the <a href="https://hothardware.com/news/cpsc-deadly-warning-electric-scooters-recall-ignored">CPSC’s calls for recall</a> and claimed that it tested and found nothing wrong with the Onewheels. At the time, the company <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/future-motion-responds-to-the-cpscs-unjustified-and-alarmist-claims-regarding-onewheels-301680207.html">issued a press release in objection to the CPSC</a> and called the agency’s statements “unjustified and alarmist.” </p><p>Now Future Motion is moving forward with a <a href="https://recall.onewheel.com/safety">voluntary recall</a> it chose not to do almost a year earlier. The company is asking owners to stop using their Onewheels until they take appropriate action. For the newer Onewheel GT, Onewheel Pint X, Onewheel Pint, and Onewheel Plus XR, a software update with a new warning system is the remedy.</p><p>For early adopters, however, the CPSC and Future Motion are telling owners to stop using and discard the original Onewheel and Onewheel Plus. We asked Onewheel chief evangelist Jack Mudd in an email how many of the original units are affected, but Mudd refused to answer. Mudd also wouldn’t tell us why the company claimed there were no issues and publicly resisted issuing a recall back in 2022.</p><p>Mudd did say that the software update for the other models is rolling out worldwide, not just in the US.</p><p>Some crashes occurred due to Onewheel skateboards malfunctioning after being pushed to certain limits. The Onewheel GT, Onewheel Pint X, Onewheel Pint, and Onewheel Plus XR will receive a firmware update that will add a new warning “Haptic Buzz” feedback that riders can feel and hear when the vehicle enters an error state, is low on battery, or is nearing its limits and needs to slow down.</p><p>“This update is the culmination of months of work with the CPSC,” reads the company’s recall website. Last November, it called the CPSC’s warning about Onewheels “misleading” but stated it would “work to enhance the CPSC’s understanding of self-balancing vehicle technology and seek to collaborate with the agency to enhance rider safety.”</p><p>To install the update, owners must connect their Onewheels to the accompanying app and run a firmware update — the process is <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?xs=1&amp;id=1025X1701640&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D4loCxNoM6Yw">fully explained in a new video</a>.</p><p>For early adopters, however, owners can receive a “pro-rated credit of $100 to the purchase of a new board,” according to Mudd. The credit will only be issued after owners confirm that they have disposed of the old model.</p><p>Alongside Future Motion’s blink on the decision to recall Onewheel, the company <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?xs=1&amp;id=1025X1701640&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DKVYxN5MR5CU">shared a new video</a> on YouTube highlighting the new Haptic Buzz feature as well as best practices when riding. “We’ve been working closely with the CPSC for over a year in order to develop this new safety feature,” Mudd says in the video. He adds that ignoring pushback or Haptic Buzz “can result in serious injury or death.” It took engineers a while to whip up Haptic Buzz; perhaps it’s something that would not have been ready in a timely fashion after CPSC’s first whistle last year.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<p><strong>SAN ANTONIO, Sept. 20, 2023</strong> – A new published study led by researchers at The University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio (UT Health San Antonio) has found an association between autism diagnosis in boys and daily consumption of either diet soda or a comparable amount of aspartame by their mothers during pregnancy or breastfeeding.</p>
<p>In this case-control study, boys who had been diagnosed with autism were more than three times as likely as neurotypically developing boys to have been born to mothers who reported consuming one or more servings per day of diet soda, or comparable amounts of the leading artificial sweetener aspartame, during pregnancy or breastfeeding. No statistically significant association was found in female offspring.</p>
<p>“These associations do not prove causality, but taken in concert with reports from earlier studies of increased prematurity and cardiometabolic health impacts among infants and children exposed daily to diet beverages and/or aspartame during pregnancy, our findings raise new questions about potential neurological impacts that need to be addressed,” said Raymond F. Palmer, PhD, senior author of the paper, and professor in the Department of Family and Community Medicine at UT Health San Antonio.</p>
<p>The study, “Daily Early-Life Exposures to Diet Soda and Aspartame Are Associated with Autism in Males: A Case-Control Study,” was published in <em>Nutrients</em>, an international journal of human nutrition, on Aug. 29. Palmer and lead author Sharon Parten Fowler, PhD, MPH, adjunct assistant professor of medicine at UT Health San Antonio, were joined by researchers from School of Public Health campuses in San Antonio and Houston of The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston, and the School of Public Health at San Diego State University.</p>
<figure id="attachment_35370" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-35370"><img decoding="async" src="https://news.uthscsa.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/88263_web.jpg" alt="" width="214" height="314"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-35370">Sharon Parten Fowler, PhD, MPH</figcaption></figure>
<p>Since its introduction, aspartame consumption has been reported to cause neurological problems in some users. It has also been associated with increased health problems among the offspring of animals fed aspartame during pregnancy, and among children whose mothers had consumed diet sodas, other diet beverages and/or aspartame daily during pregnancy.</p>
<p>For the new study, researchers hypothesized that exposure during pregnancy or breastfeeding to at least one can of diet soda per day, or an amount of aspartame equivalent to the dosage in one can of diet cola per day, increases autism risk. The case-control study collected retrospective dietary “recalls,” or written estimates, of diet beverage and aspartame consumption during pregnancy or breastfeeding from mothers of 235 offspring with autism spectrum disorder, and 121 offspring with typical neurological development (the control group).</p>
<p>From these recalls, exposure odds ratios were computed for all offspring diagnosed with autism, and for the subset of offspring with non-regressive – or early-onset – autism. The researchers found that males diagnosed with autism disorder had more than tripled odds of having been exposed daily to these products during pregnancy or breastfeeding, compared with male controls. These exposure odds were greatest among males with non-regressive autism.</p>
<p>“Our findings contribute to the growing literature raising concerns about potential offspring harm from maternal diet beverage and aspartame consumption during pregnancy,” said Fowler, who for the past decade has researched the health impacts of chronic exposure to non-nutritive sweeteners, including the risk of autism, and of cardiometabolic disease in children, adolescents and adults. She is an affiliate member of the International Society for Autism Research.</p>
<p>The researchers conclude that further research – including larger sample sizes of both sexes, and prospective measurement of dietary exposures and additional risk factors – is needed to evaluate these associations in other study populations, and to assess whether they extend to risk of autism spectrum disorder in all offspring.</p>
<p>In the meantime, however, the possibility that early-life exposures to these products through maternal diet might increase offspring neurodevelopmental risk, at least among boys, is of particular concern.</p>
<p>“The findings suggest that women should exercise caution when considering the use of these products during pregnancy and breastfeeding until further assessments are available,” Fowler said. “Maternal consumption of these products during periods of heightened offspring vulnerability represents a modifiable potential risk factor, the elimination of which might help to protect susceptible offspring in the next generation.”</p>

<p>I’ll cut to the chase before I type too many more words:</p>
<pre aria-describedby="shcb-language-1" data-shcb-language-name="CSS" data-shcb-language-slug="css"><span><code><span>textarea</span> {
  <span>form-sizing</span>: normal;
}</code></span><small id="shcb-language-1"><span>Code language:</span> <span>CSS</span> <span>(</span><span>css</span><span>)</span></small></pre>
<p>I came across it via <a href="https://www.amitmerchant.com/textarea-auto-increase-height/">an Amit Merchant blog post</a>. Then followed the thread a little. It all <a href="https://github.com/argyleink/open-props/issues/416">started with a discussion</a>, as these things tend to in this modern world. I think it’s a super weird name choice, but I’m sure if you were super involved in that discussion it would all make sense.</p>
<p>I was surprised to see it already in Chrome Canary with the “web experiments” flag enabled. Of course <a href="https://codepen.io/argyleink/pen/WNLzyJK">Adam is all over it</a>:</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>So useful, good job CSS. </p>
<p>Who knows when that will be usable across all browsers, or if it will definitely ship just like that. I tend to agree with Lea Verou earlier in the discussion that <code>height: max-content</code> feels like a very elegant choice, but I’m not privy to why they didn’t go that way. Also like Lea, if this opens the door for horizontally growing single-line inputs, that’s a win.</p>
<p>My favorite trick of doing this <em>before</em> was using CSS grid. You’d take the text inside the textarea and propagate it to a hidden psuedo element overlaid exactly on top. That stack technique is a classic:</p>
<pre aria-describedby="shcb-language-2" data-shcb-language-name="CSS" data-shcb-language-slug="css"><span><code><span>.grid</span> {
  <span>display</span>: grid;
  <span>grid</span>: stack;
  &gt; *, &amp;::after {
    <span>grid-area</span>: stack;
  }
}</code></span><small id="shcb-language-2"><span>Code language:</span> <span>CSS</span> <span>(</span><span>css</span><span>)</span></small></pre>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-testid="ArticlePageChunks"><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p><span>Every year between</span> September and December, Lubna Dada makes clouds. Dada, an atmospheric scientist, convenes with dozens of her colleagues to run experiments in a 7,000-gallon stainless steel chamber at CERN in Switzerland. “It's like science camp,” says Dada, who studies how natural emissions react with ozone to create aerosols that affect the climate.</p><p>Clouds are the largest source of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230930090902/https://www.wired.com/story/as-the-world-warms-clouds-could-disappear-catastrophically/#:~:text=The%20researchers%20found%20that%20the,stronger%20turbulence%20inside%20the%20clouds.">uncertainty</a> in climate predictions. Depending on location, cloud cover can <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230930090902/https://www.wired.com/story/the-mysterious-warming-hole-in-the-middle-of-the-us/">reflect sunlight away</a> from land and ocean that would otherwise absorb its heat—a rare perk in the warming world. But clouds can also <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230930090902/https://www.wired.com/story/why-the-arctic-is-warming-4-times-as-fast-as-the-rest-of-earth/"><em>trap</em> heat over Arctic and Antarctic ice</a>. Scientists want to know more about what causes clouds to form, and if that effect is cooling or heating. And most of all, says Dada, “We want to know how we humans have changed clouds.”</p><p>In the sky, aerosol particles attract water vapor or ice. When the tiny wet globs get large enough, they become <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230930090902/https://www.wired.com/story/if-clouds-are-made-of-water-how-do-they-stay-in-the-air/">seeds for clouds</a>. Half of Earth’s cloud cover forms around stuff like sand, salt, soot, smoke, and dust. The other half nucleates around vapors released by living things or machines, like the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230930090902/https://www.wired.com/story/how-do-you-know-a-cargo-ship-is-polluting-it-makes-clouds/">sulfur dioxide that arises from burning fossil fuels</a>.</p><p>At CERN, scientists replicate that process by injecting the steel chamber with vapors that represent specific environments. (It’s called the CLOUD chamber, for Cosmics Leaving Outdoor Droplets.) For example, they can mimic the gases found above cities. But Dada, who normally works at the Paul Scherrer Institute in Switzerland, went to CERN to peer into the past. Her team of scientists from around the world wanted to recreate the air above forests, because a “pristine” atmosphere hints at what cloud formation was like before industrialization. “We need this comparison to the time when there were no human emissions,” she says, “so we can fix our climate models.”</p><p>In a paper published <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230930090902/https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adi5297">this month</a> in <em>Science Advances</em>, Dada’s team establishes a new heavy hitter in cloud creation: a kind of chemical released by trees. Trees emit <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230930090902/https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27225125/">natural volatiles</a> like isoprene and monoterpenes, which can spark <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230930090902/https://www.nature.com/articles/nature17953">cloud-forming</a> <a data-offer-url="https://theconversation.com/trees-are-much-better-at-creating-clouds-and-cooling-the-climate-than-we-thought-66713" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://theconversation.com/trees-are-much-better-at-creating-clouds-and-cooling-the-climate-than-we-thought-66713&quot;}" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230930090902/https://theconversation.com/trees-are-much-better-at-creating-clouds-and-cooling-the-climate-than-we-thought-66713" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">chemical reactions</a>. Dada’s new work focuses on an overlooked class of less abundant volatiles called sesquiterpenes, which smell woody, earthy, citrusy, or spicy, depending on the molecule and type of plant or microbe that emits them.</p><p>The team shows that sesquiterpenes are more effective than expected for seeding clouds. A mere 1-to-50 ratio of sesquiterpene to other volatiles <em>doubled</em> cloud formation.</p><p>The role of trees in seeding clouds is important, because it suggests what the sky above some regions might be like if governments manage to tamp down sulfur emissions. In a world with less pollution, plants and trees will become more dominant drivers of cloud formation, an echo of the premodern world.</p><p>This research could help refine estimates of what the atmosphere was like before industrialization. Maybe we’ve been undercounting the world’s aerosol population by overlooking a large portion of those that come from trees. If so, climate models will need retooling.</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>“New particle formation is a pretty hot topic right now,” says Paquita Zuidema, an atmospheric scientist at the University of Miami who was not part of the study. “We’re coming to realize more and more that we don't really know exactly what a pristine atmosphere is like.”</p><p><span>While anthropogenic emissions</span> dominate cloud formation in populated areas, plant volatiles dominate over more pristine land elsewhere. Lab tools have only recently become sensitive enough to understand which ones contribute the most.</p><p>Many discoveries about sesquiterpenes are relatively recent. In 2010, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230930090902/https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1029/2011JD016243">researchers detected them</a> near the Amazon’s forest floor. Higher up in the canopy, sesquiterpenes were harder to track. This suggested that ozone was turning sesquiterpenes into cloud-seeding aerosols. Dada reported a similar system in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230930090902/https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-022-00406-9">Finnish forests and peatlands</a> last year. “We are seeing more and more because our instruments are much better now,” she says. “They are not only in the Amazon.”</p><p>When Dada and her colleagues started the new study, they aimed to test sesquiterpenes’ cloud-making abilities by mimicking the air in a forest that hasn't been corrupted by anthropogenic emissions. They began with a baseline—measuring what happens after ionizing an atmospheric mix of the most common “biogenic” volatiles: isoprene and α-pinene, a monoterpene. This combination seeded clouds, as expected. Then, the team did the same and mixed in a sesquiterpene called β-caryophyllene. It comes from pine and citrus trees and smells like cracked pepper.</p><p>Dada hypothesized that β-caryophyllene should react chemically, forming aerosols and eventually a cloud. She and her team stood in the control room monitoring 15 screens displaying real-time readouts of data like aerosol sizes and concentrations. They would know she was right if a graph of particle sizes on one of the screens changed color. It would grow and turn from blue to banana yellow as cloud seeds become more numerous.</p><p>On the first run, the graph turned yellow. Dada was right. (“We were all screaming ‘Banana! Banana! Banana!’” she recalls.) Adding just 2 percent by volume of β-caryophyllene to the mix doubled cloud formation and caused particles to grow <em>faster</em>. It was the first experiment demonstrating how sesquiterpenes seed clouds. Dada says it showed that even though these are only a fraction of the compounds that trees exhale, “the contribution is huge.”</p><p>“A little bit of sesquiterpene added has a very large effect,” says Jiwen Fan, an atmospheric scientist with Argonne National Lab not involved in the study. Even when sesquiterpenes create “ultrafine” aerosols they can still seed clouds and affect weather. In 2018, Fan showed that when huge rainclouds “ingest” ultrafine aerosols, they form new droplets that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230930090902/https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29371462/">invigorate thunderstorms</a>.</p><p>To Fan, the new data suggests that sesquiterpenes may help better account for the global flow of aerosols. Aerosols make clouds deflect more heat away from Earth—an effect known as “radiative forcing.” (That’s the idea behind <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230930090902/https://www.wired.com/story/the-nightmare-politics-and-sticky-science-of-hacking-the-climate/">plots</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230930090902/https://www.wired.com/story/think-climate-change-is-messy-wait-until-geoengineering/">to geoengineer</a> the atmosphere with aerosols: Artificially seeding clouds that can cool the ground.) More aerosols mean more reflective clouds that look whiter, last longer, and rain less.</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>But scientists have trouble simulating just how many aerosols should be accounted for in models. “It’s been a long-standing problem,” Fan says. “A lot of climate models overestimate anthropogenic aerosol forcing.” Perhaps that is because they are underestimating the prevalence of natural aerosols—from microbes, plants, and trees—before the industrial revolution. “Maybe what we're using as our reference point may actually not be as low-aerosol as we thought,” agrees Zuidema.</p><p>By quantifying how trees make clouds, scientists could better predict the climate’s future—and past. Industrial emissions reduce some warming through radiative forcing, since sulfur aerosols can create reflective clouds. But if biogenic aerosols were more abundant than expected <em>before</em> industrialization, then the contributions from industry matter less.</p><p>It’s hard to predict what this recalculation will tell us about global warming, because there are so many moving parts in a dynamic climate. For example, heat stress, extreme weather, and droughts cause plants to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230930090902/https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28218253/">release more biogenic volatiles</a>—which seed more clouds. Deforestation and heat stress are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230930090902/https://www.wired.com/story/the-very-slow-race-to-move-forests-in-time-to-save-them/">pushing treelines to migrate</a> to higher altitudes and latitudes. That affects <em>where</em> clouds form.</p><p>“It’s a feedback loop,” Dada says. “The climate is affecting the cloud formation, and the clouds are affecting the climate.”</p><p>Better climate models will help scientists predict the best mitigations: “If we need more clouds, if we need less clouds,” Dada says. The catch, though, is that climate models are incredibly computationally demanding. It may not be easy to incorporate the physics of something as tiny as these tree aerosols.</p><p>Dada is back at CERN this autumn for more tests. Her team now wants to see how anthropogenic emissions, like sulfur dioxide, affect the ability of plants to seed clouds. They might slow each other down—or speed each other up. Their goal is to broaden their conclusions to regions that aren’t as pristine as a forest, where there are many kinds of intermingled emissions. “We're trying to add anthropogenic factors, to have a more realistic view about almost everywhere around the world,” she says.</p><p><em>Updated 9-29-2023 at 5:15 ET: This story was updated to correct a reference to Jiwen Fan's 2018 paper.</em></p></div></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>The half-bearded behavioral economist Dan Ariely tends to preface discussions of his work—which has inquired into the mechanisms of pain, manipulation, and lies—with a reminder that he comes by both his eccentric facial hair and his academic interests honestly. He tells a version of the story in the introduction to his breezy first book, “Predictably Irrational,” a patchwork of marketing advice and cerebral self-help. One afternoon in Israel, Ariely—an “18-year-old military trainee,” according to the <em>Times</em>—was nearly incinerated. “An explosion of a large magnesium flare, the kind used to illuminate battlefields at night, left 70 percent of my body covered with third-degree burns,” he writes. He spent three years in the hospital, a period that estranged him from the routine practices of everyday life. The nurses, for example, stripped his bandages all at once, as per the cliché. Ariely suspected that he might prefer a gradual removal, even if the result was a greater sum of agony. In an early psychological experiment he later conducted, he submitted this instinct to empirical review. He subsequently found that certain manipulations of an unpleasant experience might make it seem milder in hindsight. In onstage patter, he referred to a famous study in which researchers gave colonoscopy patients either a painful half-hour procedure or a painful half-hour procedure that concluded with a few additional minutes of lesser misery. The patients preferred the latter, and this provided a reliable punch line for Ariely, who liked to say that the secret was to “leave the probe in.” This was not, strictly speaking, optimal—why should we prefer the scenario with bonus pain? But all around Ariely people seemed trapped by a narrow understanding of human behavior. “If the nurses, with all their experience, misunderstood what constituted reality for the patients they cared so much about, perhaps other people similarly misunderstand the consequences of their behaviors,” he writes. “Predictably Irrational,” which was published in 2008, was an instant airport-book classic, and augured an extraordinarily successful career for Ariely as an enigmatic swami of the but-actually circuit.</p><p>Ariely was born in New York City in 1967 and grew up north of Tel Aviv; his father ran an import-export business. He studied psychology at Tel Aviv University, then returned to the United States for doctoral degrees in cognitive psychology at the University of North Carolina and in business administration at Duke. He liked to say that Daniel Kahneman, the Nobel Prize-winning Israeli American psychologist, had pointed him in this direction. In the previous twenty years, Kahneman and his partner, Amos Tversky, had pioneered the field of “judgment and decision-making,” which revealed the rational-actor model of neoclassical economics to be a convenient fiction. (The colonoscopy study that Ariely loved, for example, was Kahneman’s.) Ariely, a wily character with a vivid origin story, presented himself as the natural heir to this new science of human folly. In 1998, with his pick of choice appointments, he accepted a position at M.I.T. Despite having little training in economics, he seemed poised to help renovate the profession. “In Dan’s early days, he was <em>the</em> most celebrated young intellectual academic,” a senior figure in the discipline told me. “I wouldn’t say he was known for being super careful, but he had a reputation as a serious scientist, and was considered the future of the field.”</p><p>The new discipline might have lent itself to a tragic view of life. Our preferences were arbitrary and incoherent; no narrator was reliable. What differentiated Ariely was his faith that we could be managed. “It is very sad that we are fallible, myopic, vindictive, and emotional,” he told me by e-mail. “But in my view this perspective also means, and this is the optimistic side, that we can do much better.” Take, for example, cheating. If people are utility-maximizing agents, they will fleece as much as they can get away with. Ariely believed, to the contrary, that a potential cheater has to balance two conflicting desires: the urge to max out his gains and the need to see himself as a good person. In experiments, Ariely found that most people cheat when given the opportunity—but just a little. Ariely, who does not shy from cutesiness, called this the “fudge factor.” In turn, he proposed, people might just need to be reminded that they aspire to be decent. In one of his most famous experiments, he asked students to score their own math tests. Half the students had first been asked to list the Ten Commandments. Although most could recall only a few, Ariely found that, in this group, “nobody cheated.” The insight was simple, the intervention subtle, and the consequences enormous.</p><p>Ariely came to owe his reputation to his work on dishonesty. He offered commentary in documentaries on Elizabeth Holmes and pontificated about Enron. As Remy Levin, an economics professor at the University of Connecticut, told me, “People often go into this field to study their own inner demons. If you feel bad about time management, you study time inconsistency and procrastination. If you’ve had issues with fear or trauma, you study risk-taking.” Pain was an obvious place for Ariely to start. But his burn scars heightened his sensitivity to truthfulness. Shane Frederick, a professor at Yale’s business school, told me, “One of the first things Dan said to me when we met was ‘Would you ever date someone who looked like me?’ And I said, ‘No fucking way,’ which was a really offensive thing to say to someone—but it weirdly seemed to charm Dan.” From that moment, Frederick felt, Ariely was staunchly supportive of his career. At the same time, Ariely seemed to struggle with procedural norms, especially when they seemed pointless. Once, during a large conference, John Lynch, one of Ariely’s mentors, was rushed to the hospital. Ariely told me that only family members were allowed to visit. He pretended that his scarring was an allergic reaction and, once he was admitted, spent the night by Lynch’s side. In his telling, the nurse was in on the charade. “We were just going through the motions so that she could let me in,” he told me. But a business-school professor saw it differently. “Dan was seen as a hero because he had this creative solution,” she said. “But the hospital staff, even though they knew this wasn’t a real allergic reaction, weren’t allowed to not admit him. He was just wasting their time because he felt like he shouldn’t have to follow their rules.”</p><figure><p><span><div data-attr-viewport-monitor=""><a data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/cartoon/a25933&quot;}" href="https://www.newyorker.com/cartoon/a25933" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><picture></picture></a><p><span>“Well, technically, I have an abrasive personality and a tendency to alienate everyone around me, but, sure, let’s go with ‘lone wolf.’&nbsp;”</span></p><p><span>Cartoon by Jake Thompson</span></p></div></span></p></figure><p>A decade or so into his career, Ariely’s focus shifted to applied research. A former affiliate told me that Ariely once said, “Some behavioral economist is going to win the Nobel Prize—what do I have to do to be in contention?” (Ariely denies wondering whether he would get the Nobel Prize.) In the spring of 2007, he asked an insurance company if he could replace its ordinary automobile-policy review form with experimental versions of his own. Customers had an incentive to underreport their annual mileage, in order to pay lower premiums. Half the participants were to receive a form that asked them to sign an honesty declaration at the end. The other half were to receive an alternate version, which instructed them to sign a pledge at the beginning. The following year, on his first book tour, Ariely addressed a crowd at Google, where he was later contracted to advise on a behavioral-science project, and referred in passing to the experiment’s results. Those who signed at the beginning, he said, had been more candid than those who signed at the end. “This was all about decreasing the fudge factor,” he said. In 2009, Ariely noted in the <em>Harvard Business Review</em> that the insurance company had updated its own forms to exploit his finding. He hadn’t yet published the study, which, given its obvious importance, might have seemed peculiar. But, at the time, nothing appeared to indicate that the results weren’t trustworthy. “People who go through a tragedy like Dan, with his burn—they have an insight into what’s important in life,” the filmmaker Yael Melamede, who collaborated with Ariely on a documentary about dishonesty, told me. “He was very aware of the dangerous desire to make experiments go your way, to bend reality to your benefit.”</p><p>Despite a good deal of readily available evidence to the contrary, neoclassical economics took it for granted that humans were rational. Kahneman and Tversky found flaws in this assumption, and built a compendium of our cognitive biases. We rely disproportionately on information that is easily retrieved: a recent news article about a shark attack seems much more relevant than statistics about how rarely such attacks actually occur. Our desires are in flux—we might prefer pizza to hamburgers, and hamburgers to nachos, but nachos to pizza. We are easily led astray by irrelevant details. In one experiment, Kahneman and Tversky described a young woman who had studied philosophy and participated in anti-nuclear demonstrations, then asked a group of participants which inference was more probable: either “Linda is a bank teller” or “Linda is a bank teller and is active in the feminist movement.” More than eighty per cent chose the latter, even though it is a subset of the former. We weren’t <em>Homo economicus;</em> we were giddy and impatient, our thoughts hasty, our actions improvised. Economics tottered.</p><p>Behavioral economics emerged for public consumption a generation later, around the time of Ariely’s first book. Where Kahneman and Tversky held that we unconsciously trick ourselves into doing the wrong thing, behavioral economists argued that we might, by the same token, be tricked into doing the right thing. In 2008, Richard Thaler and Cass Sunstein published “Nudge,” which argued for what they called “libertarian paternalism”—the idea that small, benign alterations of our environment might lead to better outcomes. When employees were automatically enrolled in 401(k) programs, twice as many saved for retirement. This simple bureaucratic rearrangement improved a great many lives.</p><p>Thaler and Sunstein hoped that libertarian paternalism might offer “a real Third Way—one that can break through some of the least tractable debates in contemporary democracies.” Barack Obama, who hovered above base partisanship, found much to admire in the promise of technocratic tinkering. He restricted his outfit choices mostly to gray or navy suits, based on research into “ego depletion,” or the concept that one might exhaust a given day’s reservoir of decision-making energy. When, in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, Obama was told that money “framed” as income was more likely to be spent than money framed as wealth, he enacted monthly tax deductions instead of sending out lump-sum stimulus checks. He eventually created a behavioral-sciences team in the White House. (Ariely had once found that our decisions in a restaurant are influenced by whoever orders first; it’s possible that Obama was driven by the fact that David Cameron, in the U.K., was already leaning on a “nudge unit.”)</p><p>The nudge, at its best, was modest—even a minor potential benefit at no cost pencilled out. In the Obama years, a pop-up on computers at the Department of Agriculture reminded employees that single-sided printing was a waste, and that advice reduced paper use by six per cent. But as these ideas began to intermingle with those in the adjacent field of social psychology, the reasonable notion that some small changes could have large effects at scale gave way to a vision of individual human beings as almost boundlessly pliable. Even Kahneman was convinced. He told me, “People invented things that shouldn’t have worked, and they were working, and I was enormously impressed by it.” Some of these interventions could be implemented from above. Brian Wansink, a researcher at Cornell, reported that an attractive wire rack and a lamp increased fruit sales at a school by fifty-four per cent, and that buffet diners likely consumed fewer calories when “cheesy eggs” weren’t immediately at hand. Other techniques were akin to personal mind cures. In 2010, the Harvard Business School professor Amy Cuddy purported to show that subjects who held an assertive “power pose” could measurably improve their confidence and “instantly become more powerful.” In advance of job interviews, prospective employees retreated to corporate bathrooms to extend their arms in victorious V’s.</p><p>In 2017, Thaler won the Nobel Prize for his analysis of “economic decision-making with the aid of insights from psychology.” Some policy nudges did not ultimately survive empirical scrutiny (though early studies showed that making organ donation opt-out rather than opt-in would cause the practice to become more widespread, long-term evaluations suggested that it had little effect), but the bulk of them held up. By that point, however, a maximalist version of the principle—easily absorbed by viral life-hack culture—had become commonplace. Ariely, for his part, predicted that nudges were just the beginning, and held out for more ambitious social engineering. He told me, “I thought that in many cases paternalism is going to be necessary.” At the end of “Predictably Irrational,” he writes, “If I were to distill one main lesson from the research described in this book, it is that we are pawns in a game whose forces we largely fail to comprehend.”</p><p><em>Haaretz</em> once called Ariely “the busiest Israeli in the world.” I met him several times in the past year, although he agreed to speak on the record mostly in writing. A stimulating and slightly unnerving interlocutor, he has coarse black bangs, tented eyebrows, and the frank but hooded aspect of an off-duty mentalist or a veteran card-counter. “Predictably Irrational” considerably expanded his sphere of influence. He started a lab at Duke called the Center for Advanced Hindsight, which was funded by BlackRock and MetLife. He had a wife and two young children in Durham, but spent only a handful of days a month in town. In a given week, he might fly from São Paulo to Berlin to Tel Aviv. At talks, he wore rumpled polos and looked as though he’d trimmed his hair with a nail clipper in an airport-lounge rest room. He has said that he worked with multiple governments and Apple. He had ideas for how to negotiate with the Palestinians. When an interviewer asked him to list the famous names in his phone contacts, he affected humility: “Jeff Bezos, the C.E.O. of Amazon—is that good?” He went on: the C.E.O.s of Procter &amp; Gamble and American Express, the founder of Wikipedia. In 2012, he said, he got an e-mail from Prince Andrew, who invited him to the palace for tea. Ariely’s assistant had to send him a jacket and tie via FedEx. He couldn’t bring himself, as an Israeli, to say “Your Royal Highness,” so he addressed the Prince by saying “Hey.”</p><p>Ariely seemed to know everything and everyone. “What an amazing life to lead,” a former doctoral student in his lab said. “It was like ‘The Grand Budapest Hotel.’&nbsp;” He told people that he’d climbed Annapurna and rafted down the Mekong River. But he was also attentive. “Every single time I went into the room and interacted with Dan, it was unbelievably enjoyable,” the student said. At one talk, he auctioned off a hundred-dollar bill, with the stipulation that the second-highest bidder would also have to pay. The winner owed a hundred and fifty dollars; the loser owed a hundred and forty-five dollars for nothing. Both might have felt like idiots, but Ariely wasn’t scornful; he sympathized. His knowledge of human behavior could be burdensome. “It makes daily interactions a little difficult,” he said. “I know all kinds of methods to convince people to do things I want them to do.” He told me, “Just imagine that you could separate the people who are your real friends from the people who want something from you.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. And now ask yourself if you really want to know this about them.”</p><p>One of his frequent collaborators was Francesca Gino, a rising star in the field. Gino is in her mid-forties, with dark curly hair and a frazzled aspect. She grew up in Italy, where she pursued a doctorate in economics and management. Members of her cohort remember her dedication, industry, and commitment. She first came to Harvard Business School as a visiting fellow, and, once she completed her Ph.D., in 2004, she stayed on as a postdoc. She later said that she went to Harvard for a nine-month stint and never left. This story elides a few detours. By the end of her postdoc, in 2006, she had yet to publish an academic paper, and Harvard did not extend an offer. One of her mentors at Harvard, a professor named Max Bazerman, helped make introductions; she eventually landed a postdoc at Carnegie Mellon. A senior colleague who knew her at the time told me, “That entire experience could plausibly have left her with a keen sense of the fragility and precariousness of academic careers.” At last, she seemed to find her footing, and it soon looked as though she could get almost any study to produce results. She secured a job at U.N.C., where she entered a phase of elevated productivity. According to her C.V., she published seven journal papers in 2009; in 2011, an astonishing eleven.</p><p>Ariely and Gino frequently collaborated on dishonesty. In the paper “The Dark Side of Creativity,” they showed that “original thinkers,” who can dream up convincing justifications, tend to lie more easily. For “The Counterfeit Self,” she and Ariely had a group of women wear what they were told were fake Chloé sunglasses—the designer accessories, in an amusing control, were actually real—and then take a test. They found that participants who believed they were wearing counterfeit sunglasses cheated more than <em>twice</em> as much as the control group. In “Sidetracked,” Gino’s first pop-science book, she seems to note that such people were not necessarily corrupt: “Being human makes all of us vulnerable to subtle influences.” In 2010, she returned to Harvard Business School, where she was awarded an endowed professorship and later became the editor of a leading journal. She dispensed page-a-day-calendar advice on LinkedIn: “Life is an unpredictable journey.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The challenge isn’t just setting our path, but staying on it amidst chaos.” She was a research consultant for Disney, and a speakers bureau quoted clients between fifty and a hundred thousand dollars to book her for gigs. In 2020, she was the fifth-highest-paid employee at Harvard, earning about a million dollars that year—slightly less than the university’s president.</p><p>Gino drew admiring notice from those who could not believe her productivity. The business-school professor said, “She’s not just brilliant and successful and wealthy—she has been a kind, fun person to know. She was well liked even by researchers who were skeptical of her work.” But she drew less admiring notice, too—also from people who could not believe her productivity. As one management scholar told me, “You just cannot trust someone who is publishing ten papers a year in top journals.” Other co-authors, as collateral beneficiaries, weren’t sure what to think. One former graduate student thought that she caught Gino plagiarizing portions of a literature review, but tried to convince herself that it was an honest error. Later, in a study for a different paper, “Gino was, like, ‘I had an idea for an additional experiment that would tie everything together, and I already collected the data and wrote it up—here are the results.’&nbsp;” The former graduate student added, “My adviser was, like, ‘Did you design the study together? No. Did you know it was going to happen? No. Has she sent you the data? No. Something off is happening here.’&nbsp;” (Gino declined to address these allegations on the record.)</p><figure><p><span><div data-attr-viewport-monitor=""><a data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/cartoon/a25894&quot;}" href="https://www.newyorker.com/cartoon/a25894" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><picture></picture></a><p><span>Cartoon by Liana Finck</span></p></div></span></p></figure><p>In late 2010, Gino was helping to coördinate a symposium for an Academy of Management conference, on “behavioral ethics,” which listed Ariely as a contributor. At the time, Gino and Bazerman were researching moral identity. Ariely’s findings with the car-insurance company remained unpublished, but his talks had made the rounds, and his field study seemed like the perfect companion piece for joint publication. “I suggest we add them as co-authors and write up the paper for a top tier journal,” Gino later wrote, by e-mail.</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>The paper, which was published in 2012, became an event. Signing the honesty pledge at the beginning, Ariely found, reduced cheating by about ten per cent. The Obama Administration included the paper’s findings in an annual White House report. Government bodies in the U.K., Canada, and Guatemala initiated studies to determine whether they should revise their tax forms, and estimated that they might recoup billions of dollars a year. Kahneman told me that he saw no reason to disbelieve the results, which were clearly compatible with the orientation of the field. “But many things that might work don’t,” he told me. “And it’s not necessarily clear a priori.”</p><p>Near the end of Obama’s first term, vast swaths of overly clever behavioral science began to come unstrung. In 2011, the Cornell psychologist Daryl Bem published a journal article that ostensibly proved the existence of clairvoyance. His study participants were able to predict, with reasonable accuracy, which curtain on a computer screen hid an erotic image. The idea seemed parodic, but Bem was serious, and had arrived at his results using methodologies entirely in line with the field’s standard practices. This was troubling. The same year, three young behavioral-science professors—Joe Simmons, Leif Nelson, and Uri Simonsohn—published an actual parody: in a paper called “False-Positive Psychology,” they “proved” that listening to the Beatles song “When I’m Sixty-Four” rendered study participants literally a year and a half younger. “It was hard to think of something that was so crazy that no one would believe it, because compared to what was actually being published in our journals nothing was that crazy,” Nelson, who teaches at U.C. Berkeley, said. Researchers could measure dozens of variables and perform reams of analyses, then publish only the correlations that happened to appear “significant.” If you tortured the data long enough, as one grim joke went, it would confess to anything. They called such techniques “p-hacking.” As they later put it, “Everyone knew it was wrong, but they thought it was wrong the way it’s wrong to jaywalk.” In fact, they wrote, “it was wrong the way it’s wrong to rob a bank.”</p><p>The three men—who came to be called Data Colada, the name of their pun-friendly blog—had bonded over the false, ridiculous, and flashy findings that the field was capable of producing. The discipline of judgment and decision-making had made crucial, enduring contributions—the foundation laid by Kahneman and Tversky, for example—but the broader credibility of the behavioral sciences had been compromised by a perpetual-motion machine of one-weird-trick gimmickry. Their paper helped kick off what came to be known as the “replication crisis.” Soon, entire branches of supposedly reliable findings—on social priming (the idea that, say, just thinking about an old person makes you walk more slowly), power posing, and ego depletion—started to seem like castles in the air. (Cuddy, the H.B.S. professor, defended her work, later publishing a study that showed power posing had an effect on relevant “feelings.”) Some senior figures in the field were forced to consider the possibility that their contributions amounted to nothing.</p><p>In the course of its campaign to eradicate p-hacking, which was generally well intended, Data Colada also uncovered manipulations that were not. The psychologist Lawrence Sanna had conducted studies that literalized the metaphor of a “moral high ground,” determining that participants at higher altitudes were “more prosocial.” When Simonsohn looked into the data, he found that the numbers were not “compatible” with random sampling; they had clearly been subject to tampering. (Sanna, at the time, acknowledged “research errors.”) Simonsohn exposed similar curiosities in the work of the Flemish psychologist Dirk Smeesters. (Smeesters claimed that he engaged only in “massaging” data.) The two men’s careers came to an unceremonious end. Occasionally, these probes were simple: one of the first papers that Data Colada formally examined included reports of “-0.3” on a scale of zero to ten. Other efforts required more recondite statistical analysis. Behind these techniques, however, was a basic willingness to call bullshit. Some of the papers in social psychology and adjacent fields demonstrated effects that seemed, to anyone roughly familiar with the behavior of people, preposterous: when maids are prompted to think of their duties as exercise, do they really lose weight?</p><p>Kahneman graciously conceded that he had been wrong to endorse some of this research, and told me, of Data Colada, “They’re heroes of mine.”But not everyone was supportive. Data Colada’s harshest critics saw the young men as jealous upstarts who didn’t understand the soft artistry of the social sciences. Norbert Schwarz, an éminence grise of psychology, interrupted a presentation about questionable research practices at a conference, and later called the burgeoning reform movement a “witch hunt.” A former president of the Association for Psychological Science, in a leaked editorial, referred to such efforts as “methodological terrorism.” When Data Colada posted about Amy Cuddy, it was taken as evidence of borderline misogyny. The Harvard psychologist Daniel Gilbert referred to the “replication police” as “shameless little bullies”; others compared Data Colada to the Stasi. Simonsohn found this analogy hurtful and offensive. “We’re like data journalists,” he said. “All we can do is inform people with power. The only power you have is being right.”</p><p>Simmons, Nelson, and Simonsohn maintain a standing Zoom date once a week. Recently, they invited me to join. They’ve been working together long enough to finish one another’s sentences—the only real pleasure in what they do. Their work can be demoralizing, and after each successive fraud investigation they swear off the practice. “It’s pleasant for maybe an hour,” Simonsohn, who teaches at the Esade Business School, in Barcelona, told me. “You notice how they did it, and it feels great, like you wrote a mystery novel. But then everything feels bad.” Simmons, a professor at Wharton, added, “We have this unfortunate fraud detector in our brain. Obviously, it’s just an internal alarm and you have to then check, but you see results sections that stand out as ‘No no no, that’s not a thing.’&nbsp;” He remarked that Nelson had sent him a screenshot of a figure from a journal; with only a glance, Simmons would have bet his house that the data were fake, but the men didn’t plan to pursue the case. “At this point, it’s like an affliction,” Simmons said. “But if you see it you see it, and then it’s hard to look the other way.”</p><p>There is a propensity to write off such misconduct as a victimless crime. In the spring of 2021, Data Colada was contacted by Zoé Ziani, a recent Ph.D. recipient whose professional trajectory offered an example of the practice’s collateral damage. Ziani is slight and angular, but she projects considerable tensile strength. She grew up in a working-class neighborhood of Paris; her parents had not graduated from college, but she was enchanted by academia. “People were paid just to think and talk about how things work,” she told me. Assessing the fallout of the financial crisis, she found herself wondering how an entire industry could have developed a culture of malfeasance. “Nobody reacted before the worst happened,” she said. “Nobody raised their hands to say, ‘This is really risky, and we should stop.’&nbsp;”</p><p>In graduate school, Ziani took up the question of how individuals form and exploit professional networks—such as the ones she had to assemble from nothing. One recent high-profile contribution to the networking literature was a paper by Gino. Some participants had been asked to think of a time they had networked in an “instrumental” way, and then to fill in the blanks for prompts such as “W _ _ H,” “SH _ _ ER,” and “S _ _ P.” These people were more likely to complete the prompts with such cleaning-related words as “WASH,” “SHOWER,” and “SOAP”—in other words, networking made them feel literally unclean.</p><p>Ziani found Gino’s results implausible, and assumed that they had been heavily p-hacked. She told me, “This crowd is used to living in a world where you have enough degrees of freedom to do whatever you want and all that matters is that it works beautifully.” But an adviser strongly suggested that Ziani “build on” the paper, which had appeared in a top journal. When she expressed her doubts, the adviser snapped at her, “Don’t ever say that!” Members of Ziani’s dissertation committee couldn’t understand why this nobody of a student was being so truculent. In the end, two of them refused to sign off on her degree if she did not remove criticisms of Gino’s paper from her dissertation. One warned Ziani not to second-guess a professor of Gino’s stature in this way. In an e-mail, the adviser wrote, “Academic research is like a conversation at a cocktail party. You are storming in, shouting ‘You suck!’&nbsp;”</p><figure><p><span><div data-attr-viewport-monitor=""><a data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/cartoon/a27975&quot;}" href="https://www.newyorker.com/cartoon/a27975" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><picture></picture></a><p><span>“You know what I like about them? You’d never guess they have kids!”</span></p><p><span>Cartoon by Carolita Johnson</span></p></div></span></p></figure><p>Ziani complied, but her professional relationships had deteriorated, and she soon left the cocktail party for good. When she told me these stories, in a wood-panelled bar at a historic hotel in Boulder, Colorado, she covered her face to cry. Simmons told me that he could name countless people who had similar experiences. “Some people are hurt by this stuff and they don’t even know. They think they’re not good enough—‘It must be me’—so they leave the field,” he said. “That’s where I started to get angry. How many Zoés are there?”</p><p>Ziani had moved to Colorado, in 2020, for her husband’s job. In the spring of 2021, she set out to replicate Gino’s study. She asked for the data, and, after some delay, received it. That April, she used an online survey platform to re-create the experiment. It took a few days, and she found none of the reported effects. She also determined, more worrisomely, that there was almost no way the paper’s effect size could have been naturally generated. “I knew there was something fishy there,” Ziani said. “More than fishy.”</p><p>She and a collaborator (who wished to remain anonymous, for fear of professional retribution) approached Data Colada. The team had had its own doubts about Gino since 2014, but had concluded that a full investigation was more trouble than it was worth. Now, however, they scrutinized her previous work, and found multiple instances of data that seemed to be misbehaving. Ziani said, “The magnitude of the fraud was potentially so gigantic that they didn’t want to be merely one hundred per cent sure but one thousand per cent sure.”</p><p>One day, Ziani came across the field study from the car-insurance paper. This data was the fishiest of all, and she sent the file to Data Colada in triumph. On a Zoom call, Simonsohn looked more closely and realized, “Hey, wait a minute. This wasn’t Francesca?” The study had been conducted by Ariely. Later, they opened the file for Gino’s contribution to the same paper, and that, too, seemed incommensurable with real data. It was difficult not to read this as a sign of the field’s blight. Simmons told me, “We were, like, Holy shit, there are two different people independently faking data on the same paper. And it’s a paper about <em>dishonesty</em>.”</p><p>In 2021, the Data Colada team sent a dossier to Harvard that outlined an array of anomalies in four of Gino’s papers. In her lab study for the car-insurance paper, for example, several observations seemed to be out of order, in a way that suggested someone had moved them around by hand. Those data points, they found, were disproportionately responsible for the result. The team was unable to conceive of a benign explanation for this pattern. They had examined only four papers but noted “strong suspicions” about some of her published data going as far back as 2008. On October 27, 2021, Harvard notified Gino that she was under investigation, and asked her to turn over all “HBS-issued devices” by 5 <em>P.M.</em> that day. According to Gino, the police were called to oversee the process.</p><p>There had always been some bewilderment about Gino. Multiple people told me they found it abnormal that Gino so closely guarded her data at every step of the process. One former co-author said, “H.B.S. is so hierarchical, it’s like the military, and it was unheard of for the more senior person to do the bitch work and let the junior person have the lofty thoughts. But, then again, if I had done the grunt work, we would not have found significant results.” The networking paper that had originally drawn Ziani’s scrutiny had also seemed dubious to the former graduate student. “There were all kinds of red flags about her sample size, significance, and effect size, and I was, like, ‘No way, I’m done with this person,’&nbsp;” she said. Another professor I spoke to didn’t buy one of Gino’s early papers. “When you look at it, it just makes no sense,” he said. But, he added, “even in safe spaces in my world, to bring up that someone is a data fabricator—it’s, like, ‘Our friend John, do you think he might be a cannibal?’&nbsp;”</p><p>Concerns, however, had been raised. In 2012, Lakshmi Balachandra, now a professor at Babson, told Bazerman, Gino’s mentor, that her work seemed too good to be true. Balachandra said, “He basically said to me, ‘Oh, she’s such a hard worker, you could learn a lot from her.’&nbsp;” (Bazerman declined to comment about this on the record.) In 2015, a graduate student lodged a complaint against Gino and one of her colleagues, alleging, primarily, that Gino and the colleague created a tense and belittling environment. The more unsettling charge, though, was that Gino had repeatedly refused to share the raw data from their experiments. Once, after the student didn’t hand over an analysis during a long weekend, Gino ran the study herself and produced much stronger results. On multiple occasions, the student voiced concerns to a faculty review board that Gino was playing games with data, but the board was unresponsive. A three-month investigation concluded, in a confidential report, that none of the people involved had acquitted themselves particularly well, but that no action was warranted. “What incredibly low standards Harvard Business School must have to not take concerns about data manipulation seriously,” she wrote. (Harvard declined to comment on personnel matters.)</p><p>Gino has maintained that she never falsified or fabricated data.&nbsp;In a statement, her lawyer said,&nbsp;“Harvard’s complete and utter disregard for evidence, due process, confidentiality and gender equity should frighten all academic researchers. And Data Colada’s vicious take-down is baseless.” (She declined to comment on other matters on the record.) Lawrence Lessig, a law professor at Harvard, told me he is certain that Gino is innocent. “I’m convinced about her because I know her,” he said. “That’s the strongest reason why I can’t believe this has happened.”</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>This spring, Harvard finalized a twelve-hundred-page report that found Gino culpable. As part of its investigation, Harvard obtained the original data file for one of Gino’s studies from a former research assistant. An outside firm compared that to the published data and concluded that it had been altered not only in the ways Data Colada had predicted but in other ways as well. Gino’s defense, in that case, seems to be that the published data are in fact the real data, and that the “original” data are somehow not. Data Colada titled a blog post about her alleged misdeeds “Clusterfake.”</p><p>According to Gino, she was summoned to the office of the dean, who explained that she would be placed on administrative leave, and that he was instituting perhaps unprecedented proceedings to revoke her tenure. She wept. The dean told her, “You are a capable, smart woman. I am sure you’ll find other opportunities.” That day, journal editors were advised to begin the retraction process.</p><figure><p><span><div data-attr-viewport-monitor=""><a data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/cartoon/a25841&quot;}" href="https://www.newyorker.com/cartoon/a25841" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><picture></picture></a><p><span>“If we see any of my bear friends, pretend I’m mauling you.”</span></p><p><span>Cartoon by Paul Noth</span></p></div></span></p></figure><p>In September, NBC premièred a prime-time procedural called “The Irrational,” starring the “Law &amp; Order” veteran Jesse L. Martin as a behavioral scientist, inspired by Ariely, who helps solve crimes. “Understanding human nature can be a superpower, which is why the F.B.I. ends up calling me,” Martin’s character says. A trade-publication article about the show accidentally described Ariely’s first book as a work of fiction, which inspired Richard Thaler to joke on Twitter, “I have known for years that Dan Ariely made stuff up but now it turns out that it is ok because his book was a novel!” Ariely has also just published a new book, “Misbelief.” In 2020, he writes, the Israeli government sought his help with pandemic-lockdown strategy. “<em>Covid</em> in many ways was the highlight of my career,” he told me. He says that he suggested prompting people to wear masks through the altruistic message of “protect others.” He proposed an app-based solution to the rise in domestic violence: children, invited to imagine themselves as superheroes, were encouraged to report disturbances at home. That summer—in an anecdote left out of his book—he told the Israeli press he had suggested that the Army infect soldiers on a base with the coronavirus as an experiment. (Ariely said that his comments were taken out of context and that this was initially someone else’s idea. The former head of the Israel Defense Forces’ personnel directorate confirmed that he had a “very short” conversation with Ariely and “denied his request immediately.”)</p><p>He writes that he soon became the subject of Israeli <em>covid</em>-denialist conspiracy theories: in a “parallel universe,” he and his “Illuminati friends” were “in cahoots with Bill Gates” to collaborate “with multiple governments to control and manipulate their citizens.” He was called the “chief consciousness engineer” of the “<em>Covid</em>-19 fraud.” One conspiracist posted a photo of Ariely’s burns, he wrote in a draft of the book, and said that his suffering had made him “want to take revenge on the world and kill as many people as possible.” Ariely describes late-night hours spent engaging with trolls online, offering, in one case, to provide his tax returns as proof that his government services were pro bono. The book thrums with a newfound pessimism; Ariely seems to have lost faith in his old parlor tricks. “It’s been a very, very tough few years being exposed to the darkest corners of the Internet and the darkest aspects of human nature,” he told me. It never seems to have occurred to him that the vanity and disdain behind a certain kind of social engineering—keeping the buffet treats just out of reach—might exacerbate ambient resentments.</p><p>It remained unclear, however, how potent those interventions had ever been. As the Data Colada team members learned more about the insurance paper, they found that it had long had an asterisk attached to it. In February, 2011, at the beginning of the collaboration, Ariely had sent an Excel file with the insurance company’s data to Nina Mazar, a frequent co-author, for analysis. She found that the results pointed in the wrong direction—people who had signed at the beginning were <em>less</em> honest. Ariely responded that, in making “the dataset nicer” for her, he had relabelled the condition names, accidentally switching them in the process. He instructed her to switch them back. (When asked recently, Ariely reiterated this account, though he added that someone in his lab might have retyped the condition names for him.)</p><p>Later, when Bazerman reviewed a draft, he was struck by something else. The over-all numbers suggested that people drove an average of twenty-four thousand miles a year, about twice what he would have expected. When asked about this, Ariely was vague: “We used an older population mostly in Florida—but we can’t tell how we got the data, who was the population (they were all AARP members)—and we also can’t show the forms.” This still seemed odd—why would retirees drive more than commuters? Work on the paper halted. Mazar eventually relayed that the mileage data might have reflected not one but multiple years of driving. Bazerman told me, “It was only then that I kept my name on the paper.”</p><p>Four years after publication, Bazerman received an e-mail from a guy named Stuart Baserman, who worked at an Internet insurance company, and had noticed the similar surname on the paper. (Bazerman’s wife suggested that he and Baserman take a DNA test. “Cousin Stu” is now Bazerman’s favorite cousin.) Baserman asked if the paper’s results would hold in an online setting. But several experimental attempts failed, as did a subsequent high-powered lab replication of Gino’s initial lab study. The effect just wasn’t there. (The Guatemalan government, with help from the “nudge unit” in the U.K., had also tried to replicate a version of Ariely’s field study with the insurance company, using tax forms, and found no results.)</p><p>Writing up the failed replication, one of the authors noticed something strange in Ariely’s field-study data: there was a large difference between the baseline mileage—the odometer readings taken prior to the study—of the two cohorts. This seemed like a fatal randomization error. The journal’s editors asked if the authors wanted to retract the original publication. Ariely and Gino were against the idea at the time. Ariely predicted that, if anything, it was the second paper that might have to be retracted. “My strong preference is to keep both papers out and let the science process do its job,” he wrote. He and Mazar were continuing to explore the value of honesty pledges. A former senior researcher at the lab told me, “He assured us that the effect was there, that this was a true thing, and I was convinced he completely believed it.”</p><p>It didn’t take long for Ziani and Data Colada to determine that the odometer readings were inauthentic. In real life, the distribution of how much people drive looks more or less like a bell curve. This data, however, formed a uniform distribution—the same number of people drove about a thousand miles as did twelve thousand miles as did fifty thousand. Most people, when asked to fill out a form, round off unwieldy numbers to the nearest hundred or thousand. But there were few round numbers in the data set. In a small additional kink, the data were written in two different fonts: Calibri and Cambria. In August, 2021, Data Colada detailed these issues in a blog post. The evidence was overwhelming, and all the paper’s authors agreed immediately that the data were bogus. In statements, each disowned any responsibility. Gino, unaware that she was also being investigated by Data Colada, praised the team for its determination and skill: “The work they do takes talent and courage and vastly improves our research field.” Ariely, apparently taken aback, underscored that he had been the only author who handled the data. He then seemed to imply that the findings could have been falsified only by someone at the insurance company.</p><p>The insurance company in question, which was revealed to be the Hartford, was surprised to find that it had anything to do with the now infamous study. According to an agreement that Ariely signed in 2007, he was not allowed to refer to any of the company’s data without permission—permission that, according to the company, he had neither sought nor received. (Ariely said that he would never share something without approval.) In the paper, the data had been attributed to a company in the “southeastern United States,” which now smacked of deliberate misdirection. “We have been based in Connecticut, and not the Southeast, for more than two hundred years,” a company spokesperson told me. The Hartford had, in fact, completed a small pilot study at Ariely’s request, but it hadn’t been fruitful: there was no discernible difference between those who signed at the top and those who signed at the end. The company never updated its forms, as Ariely had claimed. In May of 2008, about two months before Ariely discussed the results at Google, the Hartford sent him a single data set. During the next ten months, the company said, Ariely wrote at least five times to request additional odometer data, but it provided nothing. In February of 2009, all contact with Ariely ceased. (Ariely says that he has limited recollection of this time, and no paper trail.)</p><p>Recently, I obtained the original file of the insurance company’s data.&nbsp;It contains odometer readings for about six thousand cars. These readings are assigned to three different conditions. About half the people were given the company’s “original,” standard form, as a control. (This form couldn’t be tracked down.) On the experimental forms, which have the perfunctory look of a social scientist’s survey materials, a quarter of the participants were instructed to sign a prominent “Pledge of Honesty” at the end, and the remainder to sign one at the beginning. By the time Ariely sent the file to Mazar, three years later, the contents had been transformed.&nbsp;Now the file included about twenty thousand cars, in only two conditions. A comparison of the two files confirms that the data were put through the wringer.&nbsp;About half the cars in the “original” cohort were reassigned to the other conditions, but many appear to have been simply dropped. Among the remaining cars, many never made it to the new file at all, and around half of those that did had their conditions changed. Observations for at least fourteen thousand made-up cars were manufactured, presumably, as Data Colada conjectured, with the help of Excel’s random-number generator—the bulk of which appeared in a different font.&nbsp;According&nbsp;to an unpublished Data Colada analysis, six hundred and fifty of the odometer readings&nbsp;were&nbsp;manually swapped between conditions, which generated the study’s effect.&nbsp;But something went awry along the way, and it wasn’t until Mazar switched the condition labels that the experiment appeared to succeed. Although Ariely told Mazar that he had renamed the conditions, their names are unchanged between the two files. What, then, had he been doing when he was making “the dataset nicer” for her?</p><p>Ariely has consistently denied any role in the data manipulation. “I care about understanding what makes us tick, and I would never falsify any data on any experiment,” he told me. He disavowed any involvement in the “history” of the data, saying that he merely served as a conduit for the file; he claimed that his co-authors and the members of his lab also had access to it. Investigators of data fraud rarely have recourse to the equivalent of surveillance-camera footage, so the culprit’s identity may never be known with certainty. In September, 2021, the Hartford sent Ariely a cease-and-desist letter, warning him that, if he continued to suggest that “The Hartford had any role in the erroneous research published in the study,” it would pursue legal action. In the past two years, Ariely has nevertheless continued, privately in English and publicly in Hebrew, to implicate a nameless figure at the Hartford. As the former senior researcher told me, “What Dan says is that he thinks it was just some low-level employee who was doing someone a favor at the insurance company, but they don’t know who it was, and they can’t find out.&nbsp;” This theory is possible; a crooked or inept employee might have taken the file, wangled it to serve Ariely’s hypothesis, and then re-sent it using a non-Hartford e-mail address. It would then have had to escape Ariely’s notice that six thousand observations across three conditions had become twenty thousand observations across only two. (Ariely said that this was the first time he had heard of the third condition, though it was mentioned in the Hartford’s cease-and-desist letter.) Recently, since Gino was put on leave, Ariely has privately speculated that she could have been responsible. He has also mused to colleagues that a lab member could have made the changes. He told Data Colada, however, that he had been the only one to handle the data, and it would have been an enormous risk for a junior researcher to take. (Ariely said that he would never accuse anyone without evidence.) The metadata for the Excel file that he sent to Mazar note that it was created, and last edited, by a user named Dan Ariely.</p><figure><p><span><div data-attr-viewport-monitor=""><a data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/cartoon/a27448&quot;}" href="https://www.newyorker.com/cartoon/a27448" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><picture></picture></a><p><span>“You can just leave it on that crag, thanks.”</span></p><p><span>Cartoon by Lila Ash</span></p></div></span></p></figure><p>Ariely, with his vaudevillian flair and commitment to provocation, had never been a perfect fit for the academy. Throughout his career, he performed studies that no one else would have had the courage, or the recklessness, to pursue. One study put survey questions to subjects who were actively masturbating. (Ariely found that men, in a state of excitement, could imagine being aroused by a twelve-year-old girl, animals, and shoes.) Another looked into people’s attitudes about dildos and other sex toys. He once proposed outfitting service workers with protuberant fake nipples to see how the devices would affect tips.</p><p>In 2005, Ariely ran an experiment at M.I.T. in which electric shocks were administered to Craigslist volunteers, who had been told that they were testing the efficacy of a painkiller. One of the participants was subjected to more than forty shocks of increasing strength, and broke down in tears. She claims that an assistant in a lab coat told her that she would forfeit payment if she backed out. (The assistant doesn’t recall saying this.) The worst part was the final dehoaxing: in notes from the time, she wrote, “I was informed that there was no pain killer; that they were testing placebos and that all the information that I had been given was fabricated.”</p><p>If you sympathized with Ariely, this represented a return to the glory days of dashing mid-century social psychology. A less charitable interpretation was that the rules were in place for good reason. “I think he didn’t think very highly of his subjects. And I was young, but I wasn’t that gullible,” the participant told me. She complained, and the university found that Ariely’s assistant lacked human-subjects training, which an administrator called a “very serious violation.” Ariely says that he was suspended from data collection for a year. According to the participant’s e-mails from the time, Ariely called her three or four times a day in the hope that they might come to a private resolution, and eventually offered a two-thousand-dollar payment to make the whole thing go away. (Ariely says that he offered only to buy her “a book on the placebo effect.”) He soon agreed—for his own reasons, he said—to leave M.I.T. (A spokesperson for the university declined to comment on personnel matters.) In an e-mail to some of his collaborators, he wrote, “Attached is the most painful paper in the world. Not so much for the subjects but for me.”</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>The car-insurance study was not the only example of iffy data in Ariely’s work. A few years ago, a team of researchers in Hong Kong looked into a well-known 2004 paper about the differences between social and monetary norms, and found that some numbers didn’t make sense. Ariely could not locate the original data, and conceded that he had used a “strange” statistical approach. The journal appended a formal “Expression of Concern” to the original paper.</p><p>In 2018, two researchers in the Netherlands coördinated an extensive international effort to replicate Ariely’s Ten Commandments study, enlisting twenty-five labs. Their results found that asking participants to recall the Ten Commandments led, if anything, to a slight <em>increase</em> in dishonesty. (Ariely holds that this replication was imperfect.) The researchers also encountered a medley of inconsistencies in the way that Ariely had described the study over the years. It was an embellishment to claim, even given the data he initially published, that the intervention had eliminated cheating <em>entirely</em>. Ariely maintained that the study had been conducted at U.C.L.A., by a professor named Aimee Drolet Rossi. When I spoke to Rossi, she told me that she had never participated in the study: “I thought, well, first, what a joke! I don’t believe that study, and I certainly didn’t run it.” U.C.L.A. issued a statement saying that the study hadn’t taken place there. Last year, Ariely, having learned that an Israeli television program was investigating the case, wrote to Rossi, “Do you remember who was the RA that was running the data collection sessions in 2004 and 2005?” Rossi replied, “There was none. That’s the point.” Ariely says that the study took place, and it’s possible that it did, in some form. He told me he now remembers that the surveys were collected at U.C.L.A. but processed by an assistant at M.I.T., which might explain the mixup. He could not provide the assistant’s identity.</p><p>Ariely purported to have learned, from a dental-insurance company, that dentists agree on the presence of a cavity only about half the time. But the insurance company said that it didn’t even collect such data. The Israeli TV documentary, reported by the journalist Itay Rom, dwelled on this allegation, among many others. Ariely was left feeling unfairly persecuted. Yet he has remained almost lackadaisical in his own defense. Ariely has described the use of a modified paper shredder, which allowed him to track when individuals cheated, even when they thought that the evidence had been destroyed. In 2021, researchers expressed doubt that it was even possible to modify a paper shredder in such a way. Ariely’s response was maddeningly fuzzy. On the other hand, a version of the shredder appears to function in a documentary from 2015.</p><p>Ariely often claims poor recall. In some instances, though, he remains alert to context. In the American press, he has consistently said that he was burned at the age of eighteen, when he presumably would have been in the Israeli Army, by a magnesium flare. In 2008, around the time of the press tour for “Predictably Irrational,” the <em>Times</em>, CNN, and NPR reported that he had been injured in a military exercise, and he never corrected the record. (Ariely said that he has never given inaccurate information about his injury.) But in the Israeli media, which could more easily verify military service, he has said that he was burned in an accident as part of the activities of a youth group. Documents from a court ruling in Israel confirm that the accident occurred in an apartment, where kids were mixing chemicals for a nighttime fire ceremony. In more recent years, he has reconciled these two accounts by saying that he was injured, at seventeen, in a youth-group activity during which a magnesium flare exploded. The former senior researcher said, “How do you swim through that murky area of where is he lying? Where is he stretching the truth? What is he forgetting or misremembering? Because he does all three of those things very consistently. So when it really matters—like with the auto insurance—which of these three things is it?”</p><p>One of the confounding things about the social sciences is that observational evidence can produce only correlations. To what extent is dishonesty a matter of character, and to what extent a matter of situation? Research misconduct is sometimes explained away by incentives—the publishing requirements for the job market, or the acclaim that can lead to consulting fees and Davos appearances. As one senior faculty member told me, of bridging the academic and corporate worlds, “You see what the money can buy you, you fly business class on work trips. It tickles you in that little place, and you need to have more of it.” The difference between p-hacking and fraud is one of degree. And once it becomes customary within a field to inflate results, the field selects for researchers inclined to do so. The business-school professor told me that this temptation might be more acute among researchers studying the subject: “You’re thinking about it day in and day out and looking at the prevalence of it, and what you’re finding out is normal people cheat on their taxes and cheat on their spouses, so it feels like people are cheating everywhere.</p><p>“I know this because I fell into the temptation,” she went on. Late one evening, years ago, she was working on a paper in her office. She had run so many studies that had worked, and she had no doubt that the effect she was investigating was real. The paper was key to her career, and she was doubled over with stress. One final study was so close to coming together, but the effect wasn’t quite there. She remembers the moment with absolute clarity. “I thought, Do I tamper with the data?” she said. “We were studying <em>deceit</em>. I finally said to myself, ‘O.K., you can do this bad thing, and then you can put that away in a lockbox in your mind where it never gets opened, and you will never do this again.’ And that is exactly what I did, and I am so mortified.” The paper was a collaboration with Gino. The professor had a breakdown in Gino’s office, and recalled that Gino forgave her instantly, telling her that she was not a bad person. They pulled the paper before publication. “She may well have been doing exactly the same thing,” the professor said.</p><p>The senior colleague told me he could imagine that Gino, early in a career that felt highly contingent, had been similarly led astray. “Having a job at Harvard is really wonderful, and everybody in the world thinking you’re a genius is pretty darn fun,” he said. “I don’t know when she may have started engaging in fraud, but once she learned to sing to the evidence that way, and get it to play her song, I can imagine that it’s impossible to stop.” As part of one survey, she gave participants gift cards to purchase her book on Amazon and tell her what they thought. (As a former participant wrote on Reddit, “Good pay. Shit book. Sorry to see her go.”) Academic psychologists are generally resistant to clinical interpretations, but it’s difficult not to read a lot of Gino’s later work as the return of the repressed. There’s the title of her 2018 book, “Rebel Talent: Why It Pays to Break the Rules at Work and in Life,” or her 2014 paper, now retracted, called “Evil Genius? How Dishonesty Can Lead to Greater Creativity.” The former graduate student told me, “On the one hand, she was this meek Italian woman who used to make polenta for guests—you would never have suspected her. On the other, some of the things she wrote&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. it’s like she’s trying to tell us something.”</p><figure><p><span><div data-attr-viewport-monitor=""><a data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/cartoon/a27910&quot;}" href="https://www.newyorker.com/cartoon/a27910" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><picture></picture></a><p><span>“Don’t make me change the color temperature from soft white to harsh cool, ’cause things will get ugly.”</span></p><p><span>Cartoon by Lynn Hsu</span></p></div></span></p></figure><p>An enduring mystery is that, if Gino faked the data, she seems to have done so on top of a staggering amount of actual work. Sam Swift, a New York City tech executive who worked alongside her at Carnegie Mellon, told me, “It seems way easier to fake research than to do research, so you might want to set yourself up with a relaxed life style—just make up your results and go to the beach.” He continued, “There is a work ethic that intersects with this ethical disorientation that I think is maybe not obvious.”</p><p>Some observers have complained that Ariely, a charismatic man, has received gentler treatment than Gino. This phenomenon may also reflect the affection of his colleagues. Ariely is unfailingly generous: he gave holiday gifts and paid for extravagant ski trips and beach retreats; he provided a BMW and a twenty-thousand-dollar coffee machine for his lab members to use. When a prospective student told him that Harvard was willing to provide a better financial package, he offered a personal loan for the difference. He created what was, by all accounts, a compelling and fun work environment—foosball and office Segways—where people felt free to indulge their wildest experimental notions. He was, both literally and figuratively, an electrifying presence. Another former postdoc said, “On days he came into the lab, people would be, like, ‘He’s here!’ and go line up at his door, and his door was always open.” John Lynch, one of Ariely’s mentors, said, “My experiences with Dan have been completely positive, and I have never seen anything remotely questionable in his scientific conduct.” A lot of Ariely’s work—on helping people save money, for example—still seems to be valid, and perhaps meaningful. The former doctoral student told me, “The thing that I love about Dan was his ability, whenever you were talking with him, to so quickly distill something into an idea. It’s like you’re talking about the fabric of the universe every time.”</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>Yet some believed that Ariely had always had a tortuous relationship with the truth. When Ariely gained public renown, it seemed as though empirical results became a mere prelude to lively storytelling. The former senior researcher told me that she once heard him talking on the radio about a study his lab had conducted. “His numbers were wrong,” she said. Beyond this, she continued, “he misstates entire findings, he talks about research that doesn’t replicate—he just doesn’t really care that much about the facts. It was, like, ‘No, you can’t make these outrageous claims—you’re a scientist!’&nbsp;” (Ariely said that his papers adhere to academic standards, but that he sometimes simplifies how he communicates about his work for a general audience.)</p><p>Ariely and Gino found that creative people cheat more. And people will cheat and lie more when they see people on their own “team” cheating and lying around them. A month after he sent the modified file to Mazar, Ariely applied for, and later won, an N.I.H. grant to look into dynamics that “may compromise the ethicality of scientific reporting.” Gino co-authored a resulting paper, which focussed on dishonesty more generally, and flagged that people cheat as a misguided act of altruism, to help others who could benefit. Honesty researchers have found that fewer people lie about a coin flip—a binary outcome—than exaggerate the number on a die roll, reporting that they rolled a four when they actually rolled a three, especially if a four had come up on a test roll. Ariely has long used conclusions like these to maintain that most people lie a bit. Other researchers argue that the averages are misleading: most people don’t really lie much, but some people are prone to lie a lot. It now seems as though the “fudge factor” was less of an explanation of a phenomenon than a license for it—yet another just-so story about why a little deceit isn’t so bad after all. “I’ll tell you what the research on dishonesty says, but all that came from Dan and Francesca!” the former senior researcher said. “It’s like everything we know about this situation comes from the data that might have been fabricated.”</p><p>Ariely has told me that, “because of my injury and pain in my hands,” it has been decades since he processed data himself. It’s true that those who have worked with Ariely in the years since the car-insurance paper have had a hard time reconciling the fraud allegations with the fact that none of them ever saw him get anywhere close to data. In a 2013 interview, Ariely talked about how much he had enjoyed drinking a glass of wine while analyzing data for a study published in 2008. But by the time he arrived at Duke, a former lab employee told me, “Dan was way too famous to worry about the publication process. There were papers I could barely get him to read.” And, according to several people I spoke to, the work completed by his lab in the past decade or more has been thorough and robust. He hired people who were serious about upstanding research practices; guidelines were instituted to, for example, keep raw data and edited data separate.</p><p>Ariely sometimes spoke about a “Ulysses contract,” a way to feel a temptation without giving in to it. “Maybe this was his version of binding himself to the mast,” the former senior researcher said. “I don’t know if it’s true, but it’s consistent. There are people who are the lifetime fraudsters, and then maybe there are people who had a fraud phase and then recovered and never did it again.” The former senior researcher explained that Ariely was well aware that he lacked an inclination to tell the truth at all costs. Perhaps, she continued, he had accepted safeguards to protect himself from his own worst impulses—an example, in other words, of taking his own scholarship seriously. “He encourages good data practices in other people and really cares about the right things. If Dan met another Dan, he wouldn’t trust that Dan.”</p><p>In August, Gino filed a twenty-five-million-dollar lawsuit, claiming that she had been defamed by Data Colada and wrongly terminated by Harvard. (A Harvard spokesperson said, “Professor Gino has raised allegations in her lawsuit that Harvard vigorously and vehemently denies. We believe that Harvard ultimately will be vindicated.”) Even if the defamation counts are dismissed soon, Gino’s suit will cost Data Colada tens of thousands of dollars in legal fees. The research community has rallied behind the members of Data Colada; a group of colleagues set up a GoFundMe on their behalf, which raised almost two hundred thousand dollars in twenty-four hours. Ariely’s lab has lost two of its biggest funders, and morale is low. Although he remains brash and witty in conversation, he also has an aspect of melancholic self-pity. He wrote to me, in reference to the confusion around the Ten Commandments experiment, “When I was thinking of how to promote Misbelief, I had the idea of creating a misbelief and exposing it on the day of the book’s publication, but maybe this is the way of karma to give me this anyway.” In May of 2022, according to a confidential document, Duke completed an initial inquiry. Investigators concluded that there was “sufficient evidence of the alleged misconduct to warrant a full investigation.” (Ariely and a Duke spokesperson declined to comment on the existence of an investigation.)</p><p>Joe Simmons has been working on a blog post, which Data Colada will probably never publish, called “The Fraud Is Not the Story.” He notes, at the outset, that there is “a very large body of behavioral research that is true and important.” But, he says, there is also a lot of work that is “completely divorced from reality, populated with findings about human beings that cannot be true.” In the past few years, some eminent behavioral scientists have come to regret their participation in the fantasy that kitschy modifications of individual behavior will repair the world. George Loewenstein, a titan of behavioral science and a co-author of Ariely’s masturbation paper, has refashioned his research program, conceding that his own work might have contributed to an emphasis on the individual at the expense of the systemic. “This is the stuff that C.E.O.s love, right?” Luigi Zingales, an economist at the University of Chicago, told me. “It’s cutesy, it’s not really touching their power, and pretends to do the right thing.”</p><p>At the end of Simmons’s unpublished post, he writes, “An influential portion of our literature is effectively a made-up story of human-like creatures who are so malleable that virtually any intervention administered at one point in time can drastically change their behavior.” He adds that a “field cannot reward truth if it does not or cannot decipher it, so it rewards other things instead. Interestingness. Novelty. Speed. Impact. Fantasy. And it effectively punishes the opposite. Intuitive Findings. Incremental Progress. Care. Curiosity. Reality.”</p><p>The Data Colada guys have always believed that the replication crisis might be better understood as a “credibility revolution” in which their colleagues would ultimately choose rigor. The end result might be a field that’s at once more boring and more reputable. That sanguine attitude has been tested by a cascade of corruption. In the weeks after the Gino revelations, some of her co-authors have audited their work, although Gino did not provide original data files for comparison. They wanted to figure out who had collected and analyzed which data, and to exonerate the innocent—especially young people, whose work for the job market or tenure might have been fatally tainted. In one paper, which had several co-authors, data of the apparently unnatural variety were newly uncovered. Although the details aren’t fully clear, Gino seems to have had nothing to do with it. The data may have been altered by another professor. The suspicions have been reported to the university.&nbsp;♦</p></div></div>]]></description>

It said that to exclude intermediaries would make the exemption for journalism ineffective. And media organizations, including The Globe and Mail, the CBC, CTV, Torstar, the Postmedia Network, Rogers Media Inc. and La Presse Inc., intervened to argue that Google plays an important role in disseminating news.</p><p>Justice Wyman Webb, who dissented in the ruling, agreed that Google is no different than a convenience store operator who sells newspapers, or a broadcaster who uses newspapers as a source of information.</p><p>“Google’s stated mission,” he wrote, “is ‘to organize the world’s information and make it universally accessible.’ Google’s purpose in collecting the information found in the newspaper articles is to index this information so that it can be easily found by an individual using the Google search engine.

In carrying out that purpose, Google is agnostic as to the nature of that content: nothing turns on whether or not it is journalistic, let alone on whether it meets certain aspirational standards of journalism.</p><p>“Even if the search happens to return snippets that contain links to journalistic content, that cannot be said to be its purpose when Google is indifferent to whether or not it does so. At a minimum, that cannot be said to be its sole purpose.”</p><p>He also said the questions before the court were more limited than the right to be forgotten. The constitutional protection of freedom of speech did not figure into the court’s analysis.

<p dir="auto"><strong>PruningRadixTrie - 1000x faster Radix trie</strong> for prefix search &amp; auto-complete</p>
<p dir="auto">The PruningRadixTrie is a novel data structure, derived from a radix trie - but 3 orders of magnitude faster.</p>
<p dir="auto">A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radix_tree" rel="nofollow">Radix Trie</a> or Patricia Trie is a space-optimized trie (prefix tree).<br>
A <strong>Pruning Radix trie</strong> is a novel Radix trie algorithm, that allows pruning of the Radix trie and early termination of the lookup.</p>
<div dir="auto"><p>In many cases, we are not interested in a complete set of all children for a given prefix, but only in the top-k most relevant terms.
Especially for short prefixes, this results in a <strong>massive reduction of lookup time</strong> for the top-10 results.
On the other hand, a complete result set of millions of suggestions wouldn't be helpful at all for autocompletion.</p><p>
The lookup acceleration is achieved by storing in each node the maximum rank of all its children. By comparing this maximum child rank with the lowest rank of the results retrieved so far, we can heavily prune the trie and do early termination of the lookup for non-promising branches with low child ranks.</p></div>

<p dir="auto">While 36 ms for an autocomplete might seem fast enough for a single user, it becomes insufficient when we have to serve thousands of users in parallel. Then autocomplete lookups in large dictionaries are only feasible when powered by something much faster than an ordinary radix trie.</p>
<p dir="auto">While a prefix of length=1 is not very useful for the Latin alphabet, it does make sense for CJK languages. Also, there are many more application fields for a fast prefix search algorithm beyond character-wise word completion: Instead of characters, the prefix can be composed of arbitrary items, e.g.
whole words in a query completion, or towns in a long routing sequence.</p>

Authority</p></div></div><div><p>TL;DR</p>
<ul>
<li>Users continue to report various issues with calling 911 emergency services on several Google Pixel smartphones.</li>
<li>These incidents have continued to occur after a possibly related bug was highlighted and fixed in January 2022.</li>
</ul>
</div><p>Back in late 2021, reports had emerged of a weird bug on Google Pixel devices that would render them unable to connect to 911 emergency services. The issue was traced to Microsoft Teams, and both Google and Microsoft issued fixes in early 2022. But it seems that 911 calling is still somewhat randomly broken on Google Pixel devices, and some users are finding this out the hard way.</p><p>Redditor <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/16fax0w/it_finally_happened/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">/u/TonyStamp595SO</a> found themselves in an unfortunate situation where they needed to connect to emergency services immediately. They tried dialing 911 from their <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-pixel-7-specs-price-availability-3220594/">Pixel 7</a>, but the phone failed to connect. The phone would keep dropping the call within a second of pressing the call button, which occurred for three attempts. The Redditor tried dialing from their Pixel 6 Pro next, and it connected immediately, and the emergency was handled.</p><p>This incident by itself is harrowing. But as it turns out, Redditor <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/y039zn/i_compiled_all_the_pixel_911emergency_call/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">/u/10-1-100</a> compiled over 20 such reports last year. The real kicker is that these reports exclude reports older than 2022, as that would include a publicly acknowledged bug that was subsequently “fixed.” The compilation was last updated in January 2023, so there may be other reports that have not yet been highlighted between then and now.</p><p>There are plenty of variables across the reports, ranging from different carriers to Wi-Fi calling. What is common in these reports is that the device is a Google Pixel smartphone.</p><p>To clarify, this bug does not occur on all Pixel devices. Many users report expected behavior when contacting emergency services. However, for these unfortunate reports highlighted above, the phone did not reliably connect to emergency services when it was really needed.</p><p>We’ve contacted Google for a statement and to learn more about the issue. We’ll update this article when we hear back from them.</p><p>In the meantime, you can try to schedule a “test” call to confirm that emergency calling is working on your Pixel smartphone. Remember that you may or may not face issues even after a successful test.</p><div><h2>How to schedule a “test” call to ensure that 911 emergency calling is working on your phone</h2>
<p>According to <em><a href="https://www.911.gov/calling-911/frequently-asked-questions/#:%7E:text=Test%20calls%20can%20be%20scheduled,to%20find%20your%20911%20administrator:~:text=Test%20calls%20confirm,for%20test%20calls." target="_blank">911.gov</a></em> (the official website for the National 911 Program in the US), you can schedule a test call to check whether your Pixel smartphone can successfully place a 911 call. However, a test call is different from directly calling the emergency service!</p>
</div><p>Do NOT directly call 911 for non-emergency "test" calls. Please schedule a call by contacting the non-emergency phone number first.</p><div>
<p>Instead of directly calling 911, you need to schedule a test call with your local 911 call center by contacting its non-emergency phone number.</p>
<ul>
<li>The website advises visiting the <a href="https://www.nasna911.org/contact-911" target="_blank" rel="noopener">National Association of State 911 Administrators</a> site.</li>
<li>Select the state where you live. This will show you the details of your 911 administrator.</li>
<li>Contact the administrator to find out the non-emergency number of your local 911 call center to schedule a test call.</li>
<li>Call the non-emergency number to schedule a day and time for a test call.</li>
<li>Make the test call during this scheduled slot only.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you know or can locate the non-emergency phone number of your local PSAP (Public Safety Answering Point), you can inquire with them to schedule a test call without needing to route through the 911 administrator.</p>

	<div>
		
<p>In collaboration with Boston Consulting Group (BCG), new research from Digital Data Design Institute at Harvard chair and co-founder <a href="https://d3.harvard.edu/our-team/karim-r-lakhani/">Karim Lakhani</a> and others explores field experimental evidence of the effects of AI on knowledge worker productivity and quality. It involved evaluating the performance of 758 consultants, which make up 7% of the individual contributor workforce of the company. The tasks spanned a consultant’s daily work, including creativity, analytical thinking, writing proficiency, and persuasiveness.</p>







<h2>Key Findings</h2>



<ul>
<li>For tasks within the AI frontier, ChatGPT-4 significantly increased performance, boosting speed by over 25%, human-rated performance by over 40%, and task completion by over 12%.</li>



<li>The study introduces the concept of a “jagged technological frontier,” where AI excels in some tasks but falls short in others.</li>



<li>Two distinct patterns of AI use emerged: “Centaurs,” who divided and delegated tasks between themselves and the AI, and “Cyborgs,” who integrated their workflow with the AI.</li>
</ul>



<h2>Shifting the Debate</h2>



<p>The paper argues that the focus should move beyond the binary decision of adopting or not adopting AI. Instead, we should evaluate the value of different configurations and combinations of humans and AI for various tasks within the knowledge workflow.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/09/27/cloudflare-launches-new-ai-tools-to-help-customers-deploy-and-run-models/">https://techcrunch.com/2023/09/27/cloudflare-launches-new-ai-tools-to-help-customers-deploy-and-run-models/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37713222">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
				<p id="speakable-summary">Looking to cash in on the AI craze, Cloudflare, the cloud services provider, is launching a new collection of products and apps aimed at helping customers build, deploy and run AI models at the network edge.</p>
<p>One of the new offerings, Workers AI, lets customers access physically nearby GPUs hosted by Cloudflare partners to run AI models on a pay-as-you-go basis. Another, Vectorize, provides a vector database to store vector embeddings — mathematical representations of data — generated by models from Workers AI. A third, AI Gateway, is designed to provide metrics to enable customers to better manage the costs of running AI apps.</p>
<p>According to Cloudflare CEO Matthew Prince, the launch of the new AI-focused product suite was motivated by a strong desire from Cloudflare customers for a simpler, easier-to-use AI management solution — one with a focus on cost savings.</p>
<p><span>“The offerings already on the market are still very complicated — they require stitching together lots of new vendors, and it gets expensive fast,” Prince told TechCrunch in an email interview. “There’s also very little insight currently available on how you’re spending money on AI; observability is a big challenge as AI spend skyrockets. We can help simplify all of these aspects for developers.”</span></p>
<p>To this end, Workers AI attempts to ensure AI inference always happens on GPUs close to users (from a geographic standpoint) to deliver a low-latency, AI-powered end-user experience. Leveraging ONNX, the Microsoft-backed intermediary machine learning toolkit used to convert between different AI frameworks, Workers AI allows AI models to run wherever processing makes the most sense in terms of bandwidth, latency, connectivity, processing and localization constraints.</p>
<p>Workers AI users can choose models from a catalog to get started, including large language models (LLMs) like Meta’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/07/18/meta-releases-llama-2-a-more-helpful-set-of-text-generating-models/">Llama 2</a>, automatic speech recognition models, image classifiers and sentiment analysis models. With Workers AI, data stays in the server region where it originally resided. And any data used for inference — e.g. prompts fed to an LLM or image-generating model — aren’t used to train current or future AI models.</p>
<p>“Ideally, inference should happen near the user for a low-latency user experience. However, devices don’t always have the compute capacity or battery power required to execute large models such as LLMs,” Prince said. “<span>Meanwhile, traditional centralized clouds are often geographically too far from the end user. These centralized clouds are also mostly based in the U.S., making it complicated for businesses around the world that prefer not to (or legally cannot) send data out of its home country. Cloudflare provides the best place to solve both these problems.”</span></p>
<p>Workers AI already has a major vendor partner: AI startup Hugging Face. Hugging Face will optimize generative AI models to run on Workers AI, Cloudflare says, while Cloudflare will become the first serverless GPU partner for deploying Hugging Face models.</p>
<p>Databricks is another. Databricks says that it’ll work to bring AI inference to Workers AI through MLflow, the open source platform for managing machine learning workflows, and Databricks’ marketplace for software. Cloudflare will join the MLflow project as an active contributor, and Databricks will roll out MLflow capabilities to developers actively building on the Workers AI platform.</p>
<p>Vectorize targets a different segment of customers: those needing to store vector embeddings for AI models in a database. Vector embeddings, the building blocks of machine learning algorithms used by applications ranging from search to AI assistants, are representations of training data that are more compact while preserving what’s meaningful about the data.</p>
<p>Models in Workers AI can be used to generate embeddings that can then be stored in Vectorize. Or, customers can keep embeddings generated by third-party models from vendors such as OpenAI and Cohere.</p>
<p>Now, vector databases are hardly new. Startups like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/04/27/pinecone-drops-100m-investment-on-750m-valuation-as-vector-database-demand-grows/">Pinecone</a> host them, as do public cloud incumbents like AWS, Azure and Google Cloud. But Prince asserts that Vectorize benefits from Cloudflare’s global network, allowing queries of the database to happen closer to users — leading to reduced latency and inference time.</p>
<p>“As a developer, getting started with AI today requires access to — and management of — infrastructure that’s inaccessible to most,” Prince said. “We can help make it a simpler experience from the get-go … We’re able to add this technology to our existing network, allowing us to leverage our existing infrastructure and pass on better performance, as well as better cost.”</p>
<p>The last component of the AI suite, AI Gateway, provides observability features to assist with tracking AI traffic. For example, AI Gateway keeps tabs on the number of model inferencing requests as well as the duration of those requests, the number of users using a model and the overall cost of running an AI app.</p>
<p>In addition, AI Gateway offers capabilities to reduce costs, including caching and rate limiting. With caching, customers can cache responses from LLMs to common questions, minimizing (but presumably not entirely eliminating) the need for an LLM to generate a new response. Rate limiting confers more control over how apps scale by mitigating malicious actors and heavy traffic.</p>
<p>Prince makes the claim that, with AI Gateway, Cloudflare is one of the few providers of its size that lets developers and companies only pay for the compute they use. That’s not completely true — third-party tools like GPTCache can replicate AI Gateway’s caching functionality on other providers, and providers including Vercel deliver rate limiting as a service — but he also argues that Cloudflare’s approach is more streamlined than the competition’s.</p>
<p>We’ll have to see if that’s the case.</p>
<p>“Currently, customers are paying for a lot of idle compute in the form of virtual machines and GPUs that go unused,” Prince said. “We see an opportunity to abstract away a lot of the toil and complexity that’s associated with machine learning operations today, and service developers’ machine learning workflows through a holistic solution.”</p>

The department alleges that Tesla discriminated against Black workers when making decisions about pay, promotions and work assignments. A California judge last year rejected Tesla’s motion to dismiss that case.</p><p>Tesla has claimed that the California department’s lawsuit was politically motivated and has argued that the agency violated state law by suing without first notifying the company of all of the claims or giving it a chance to settle.</p><p>In addition, a Black former elevator operator at the Fremont plant, Owen Diaz, is seeking a third trial in his 2017 lawsuit claiming he was subjected to severe racial harassment after a jury in April awarded him $3.2m.</p><p>A different jury in 2021 had awarded Diaz $137m, but a federal judge said that was excessive and Diaz opted for a new trial instead of a reduced award of $15m.</p><p>Tesla is also facing a class-action lawsuit in California state court over the alleged mistreatment of Black factory workers. About 240 workers have moved to join that lawsuit.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<h2><b>Hello,</b></h2>
<p>I’ve been contacted a few times recently about the sharp decline in descriptive images on the <a href="https://www.ianvisits.co.uk/calendar/">events listings</a>. A picture really helps to show what an event will be like, and people are asking why there’s been a decline in them — however, a problem has arisen over the past year.</p>
<p>Copyright trolls.</p>
<p>I’ve been walloped recently by a cluster of start-up companies that scan websites looking for photo infringements.</p>
<p>If I’ve made the mistake myself, then I put my hands up, guilty m’lord.</p>
<p>However, the vast majority of my “fines” have been because an event venue has used or supplied an image to me, and they either didn’t have permission themselves, or the license they paid for didn’t allow them to use the photo to promote their event on other websites.</p>
<p>As the publisher, I am held to be liable, even when the photo supplier made the mistake.</p>
<p>Legally, I could go back to the venue and tell them to refund the often circa £400 per incident, but most are charities, so I have been sucking up the cost as it just feels wrong to expect small charities to cover the costs they have unwittingly dumped on me, and can ill afford</p>
<p>However, with bills that have reached the thousands over the past few months alone, the only solution is not to use images on events unless I am convinced the venue has a license to use them. Expecting a small organisation to sign consent forms and the like for every single event listing, often where the marketing is done by a part-time person working a couple of days a week… is just not viable.</p>
<p>So, sorry, but I have to reduce the number of header images on events, even though I know how helpful they are.</p>
<p>The events will keep being listed, so you can keep finding <a href="https://www.ianvisits.co.uk/calendar/">wonderful things</a> to do in London, just with fewer photos.</p>
<p>The risks are just too great.</p>
<h2>Help support the ianVisits website</h2>
<p>Also, for a bit over a decade, ianVisits has been providing news and listings about what’s happening in London.</p>
<p>While advertising revenue contributes to funding the website’s costs, online advertising is a rapidly shrinking option for websites to rely on. That is why I have a facility with <a href="https://donorbox.org/support-ianvisits-reporting-and-events-guide">DonorBox</a> where you can support the costs of running the website and the time invested in writing and researching news articles.</p>
<p>Whether it’s a one-off donation or a regular giver, every additional support goes a long way to cover the costs of running the ianVisits website and keeping you regularly topped up with doses of Londony news and facts.</p>
<p>If you like what ianVisits does, then please support the website <a href="https://donorbox.org/support-ianvisits-reporting-and-events-guide"><b>here</b></a>.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
	  <p>This is the next quarterly update of the esp-rs effort, detailing the progress over Q3 2023.</p>
<h2 id="rust-xtensa-compiler">Rust Xtensa Compiler</h2>
<p>We had one big bugfix around hardware <a href="https://github.com/esp-rs/rust/issues/180">floating point unit for ESP32 &amp; ESP32-S3</a>, shout out to <a href="https://github.com/zRedShift">@zRedShift</a> for finding the bug and providing the fix in <a href="https://github.com/espressif/llvm-project/pull/76">llvm-project#76</a>. Along with the bugfix, <a href="https://github.com/zRedShift">@zRedShift</a> also contributed two code generation improvement patches, one to improve the performance of <a href="https://github.com/espressif/llvm-project/pull/77"><code>cttz</code></a> and another to improve the performance of <a href="https://github.com/espressif/llvm-project/pull/78"><code>abs</code>, <code>min</code> and <code>max</code></a>. The Xtensa-related LLVM patches upstream are still in review but are slowly making progress.</p>
<h2 id="esp-hal-no-std">esp-hal - no_std</h2>
<p>Q3 saw the <code>v0.11</code> and <code>v0.12</code> release of esp-hal. Highlights include updating the <code>embedded-hal-*</code> packages to <code>1.0.0-rc.1</code>, ready for the long awaited <code>1.0</code> release of <code>embedded-hal</code>; The addition of deep-sleep support for the <code>ESP32-S3</code>, and new cryptographic accelerator support for ECC, HMAC and RSA. We've made a start on adding support for the low-power core of the ESP32-C6, with some basic GPIO drivers and support for loading the LP code from the main core. Check out the full <a href="https://github.com/esp-rs/esp-hal/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md">changelog</a> for all the details.</p>
<h2 id="esp-wifi-no-std">esp-wifi - no_std</h2>
<p>We added BLE support for the ESP32-C6 in <a href="https://github.com/esp-rs/esp-wifi/pull/262">esp-wifi#262</a>, improved the esp-now async API in <a href="https://github.com/esp-rs/esp-wifi/pull/232">#232</a> along with a bunch of other smaller fixes and improvements! We're gearing up for our first crates.io release, which is long overdue. We've had all the pieces in place for a release, we just didn't get around to doing it! We're currently in the process of improving the docs, and doing some final testing before the release.</p>
<h2 id="esp-idf-hal-std">esp-idf-hal - std</h2>
<p>Async I2S, SPI, ADC and GPIO were added in <a href="https://github.com/esp-rs/esp-idf-hal/pull/279">esp-idf-hal#279</a>, with a follow up PR for UART in <a href="https://github.com/esp-rs/esp-idf-hal/pull/306">esp-idf-hal#306</a>. Huge props to <a href="https://github.com/ivmarkov">@ivmarkov</a> for the tremendous effort here. From the latest <code>v0.42.0</code> release, ESP-IDF version 4.3 is now deprecated for use with Rust. Please see <a href="https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/versions.html#support-periods">ESP-IDFs support schedule</a> for upgrade paths. See the full changelog for esp-idf-hal <a href="https://github.com/esp-rs/esp-idf-hal/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md">here</a>.</p>
<h2 id="esp-idf-svc-std">esp-idf-svc - std</h2>
<p>Bluetooth classic support (for the esp32 only at the moment) has been added, behind the <code>experimental</code> feature flag; BLE is also planned. We are also discussing how to go about adding generic Bluetooth traits in embedded-svc, <a href="https://github.com/esp-rs/embedded-svc/issues/32">here</a>. From the latest release, it will no longer be required to depend on the esp-idf-sys crate or the esp-idf-hal crate directly in your project, instead, this crate will be re-exported by esp-idf-svc as <code>esp_idf_svc::sys</code> and <code>esp_idf_svc::hal</code> respectively.</p>
<h2 id="matter-rs-rs-matter">matter-rs / rs-matter</h2>
<p>rs-matter (previously, matter-rs, but has been renamed due to an existing crate registered on crates.io) has had its first crates.io release! It is now async first (executor agnostic), with support for no_std out of the box, even including QR generation. The rs-matter repo now <a href="https://github.com/project-chip/rs-matter">has some examples</a> which can be run on std platforms, including the espidf std port! For <code>no_std</code> there are two examples of matter usage, <a href="https://github.com/bjoernQ/matter-rs-experiment">one using an esp32c3 (blocking)</a> and another using <a href="https://github.com/ivmarkov/rp-matter">a rp-2040 (async)</a>.</p>

<h3 id="espflash">espflash</h3>
<p>Just a small patch release to report, <code>v2.0.1</code> which added more help text on the CLI commands, and fixed a compilation issue in the <code>cargo</code> dependency.</p>
<h3 id="espsegs">espsegs</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/bjoernQ/espsegs">espsegs</a> is a tool to see what memory is being used by which sections and where on an esp. Once installed, you can simply point the tool to an elf file, and you'll get an output like below:</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p>
  Hello!<br>
  The code refactor of rails presented last week is great, but the motivation for such a task wasn't quite just some shape changes for rails.
</p>

<p>
  As explained last week, we can now define any kind of rail shape, and we had some very specific shapes in mind all along...
</p>

<hr>
<h3>Over or under?</h3>

<p>
  We want multi-level crossings for trains, but how? Bridges or tunnels?
</p>

<p>
  At first it would seem like going underground is the safer bet - we already have experience with belts and pipes doing that. Simple - we draw the entrance and the exit, the middle is magically connected, and that's it?
</p>

<ul>
    <li>The second layer of rails should also be able to use curves and rail signals, otherwise it would be quite limited.
    </li><li>Sometimes you already want to interact with items inside of underground belts, with trains this would be a lot worse as they can run out of fuel, stop at signals etc.
    </li><li>Building curves, signals or interacting with trains inside of a tunnel probably means we need to be able to walk inside.
    </li><li>If we can walk in a tunnel, biters and robots should be able to as well.
    </li><li>If tunnels can have curves, how could you tell which tunnel entrance connects to which exit when looking from the outside?
    </li><li>Tunnels "over" water don't quite feel right.
    </li><li>Drawing tunnels would be surprisingly difficult as we would need to do some expensive masking that Factorio isn't currently capable of.
    </li><li>And more...
  </li></ul>


<p>
  The idea of an elevated rail seems to have much more potential, although drawing in an upper layer certainly won't be easy either.
  <br>
  Also, you just want to boldly see all of your trains in their full glory instead of hiding them somewhere in a cellar!
</p>

<p>
  Such an idea would consist of:
  </p><ul>
    <li><strong>Rail ramp</strong> - The transition between the lower and upper layer.
    </li><li><strong>Elevated rail</strong> - Tracks buildable above most things.
    </li><li><strong>Rail support</strong> - Elevated rails would need supports at some intervals.
  </li></ul>


<p>

  <br><i>Elevated rail system pieces. These were the "greybox" graphics to test the gameplay of the new rail shapes and the ramps, before the final graphics were created.</i>
</p>

<hr>
<h3>Elevated rails</h3>

<p>
  I know you've already scrolled down to see the ramps instead of reading this but it just felt weird not to put a
  paragraph here.
</p>

<p>
  <img src="https://cdn.factorio.com/assets/blog-sync/fff-378-ramp.png">
</p>

<p>
  When we thought about the visual design with Albert and Earendel, we wanted the ramp to be heavy and industrial, but
  at the same time not quite perfectly stable and rigid. After multiple iterations we have arrived to this combination
  of a solid concrete base combined with an upper metal structure.
</p>


<p>
  The concrete base helps clearly show where the ramp touches the ground, while in contrast the metal part has a lot of holes so you could see entities placed behind the ramp most of the time. The metal is painted red, as mostly the only other red entities in Factorio are related to trains, it helps the elevated rails belong to the train family, and stand out in the factory - as they should with their height.
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
  The rail ramp is the new longest entity in the game at 16 tiles long and 4 tiles wide, so you will need to consider where and when to place it. It can only rotate in 4 directions.
</p>

<p>
  <img src="https://cdn.factorio.com/assets/blog-sync/fff-378-support.png">
</p>

<p>
  The rail support follows the style of the ramp, but with the difference that it can be rotated in 8 directions.
</p>

<p>
  <img src="https://cdn.factorio.com/assets/blog-sync/fff-378-rail-support-collision-boxes.png">
</p>

<p>
  It has a roughly 4x4 collision box, with the rotated ones all having the same shape.
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
  The elevated rails can be built between ramps, held by rail supports along the way.
</p>
<p>
  The elevated rail can be constructed above anything except tall entities (rocket silo, roboport, big electric pole, etc.).
</p>
<p>
  They have exactly the same rail shapes as the new ground rails do, and signals can be attached to the elevated rails.
</p>
<p>
  There are fences which help visually distinguish the elevated rails from ground rails, you can also see how they disappear on track crossings.
</p>

  </p>
  <p>
    With the ramp being long and since we have "only" two layers, building a fully multilevel junction can get rather large, but the throughput potential is massive.
    <br>It's worth noting that it's not just the level separation that helps. It's also the fact that we don't need chain signals, so we can shorten the distance between normal rail signals a lot as we don't need to guarantee there's enough space for a train "behind the junction".

  <p>
    Specifically in arrays of train stops, having the exit and entrance on different levels is a game changer.

    In case you decide to route your rails through a lake because why not, islands can become opportunities for multi-level crossings.

  <br><i>But one day, kovarex said "Why doesn't the rail planner just snap to the rail you're pointing at?"
  <br>And since that day it does, rail planner "just connects" to any rail you pick, including between ground and elevated levels.
  <br>This also massively helps mitigate issues related to the rail planner having more directions.</i>
</p>

<p>
  <img src="https://cdn.factorio.com/assets/blog-sync/fff-378-rail-planner-obstacles.png">
  <br><i>The rail planner can often find connections you wouldn't even expect to be possible, which can be mesmerizing to play with...</i>

    ...as a result, this can happen a lot quicker than you'd think.

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>
  Allowing trains to cross paths on different levels has been one of the most requested features for a very long time. We had always felt it makes perfect sense, but trains in Factorio would rarely ever get into serious enough throughput issues to justify adding elevated rails.
</p>
<p>
  The expansion changed this landscape quite a bit though. If we expect players to generally build larger factories than in the base game, train throughput could become an issue, and since you are expected to travel away from the home planet, having a train system that doesn't deadlock would be more important than ever before.
</p>
<p>
  It's not hard to guess that implementing this would require a lot of time, and working on the expansion behind closed doors allowed us some breathing room where we could make bigger experiments.
</p>
<p>
  Between boskid with the mechanics and posila with the drawing code, just the programming took a few months. On the graphics side, we could reuse a lot of initial Blender setup from the rework of ground rails, but that didn't get us very far. The ramps were simply large objects, while the rail supports are a hive of optical hacks as they need to fill their collision boxes. Both the ramps and supports were reworked multiple times to finally get the result that would look and function well.
</p>
<p>
  Especially because of the elevated rail fences, the required sprite count grew very rapidly. This made me use all the tricks in our Blender book and even add completely new Blender Python tools that mostly help with organizing and rendering large amounts of outputs. I got the final iteration to about 90% completion but then it just became too much.
</p>
<p>
  Jerzy already had experience with rail graphics, so I had asked him to help me by finishing the last details and texturing, and then he handled all of the signals and remnants again. It's hard to overstate how much bravery and mental fortitude was required to "just" jump into the Blend file of the elevated rails, and I'd like to thank him for that, again.
  <br>You can probably see from the above images that he did excellently. :)
</p>
<p>
  Between Earendel on concept art, me on most of the 3D process, Jerzy on finishing and together with Albert on re-evaluating multiple major iterarions, the graphics took about 9 months to make. Perhaps we could have taken some simplified route trying to make tunnels work, but we believe the elevated rails offer better gameplay beyond comparison.<br>
  Yet again we can confidently say that properly focusing on some features in the expansion rather than trying to shove more things into 1.0 was a very good decision.
</p>
<p>
  All of the elevated rails will be <strong>only available with the expansion executable</strong>. Their technology can be researched using Production science packs without the need to go to space or any planets. Elevated rails be will one of the standalone official mods next to Quality and Space Age, so you can play a vanilla-like game with just the elevated rails for example, or other mods can just depend on Elevated rails.
</p>

<hr>
<p>
  As always, we are looking forward to all the feedback you are about to elevate.

<p><em><span>“</span>Technology is like a bomb in Myanmar.” —Kyaw Kyaw, frontman of Burmese punk band Rebel Riot <a href="#footnote-1U21" id="ref-1U21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></em></p>
<p>Back in early July, I started working on a quick series of posts about <a href="https://erinkissane.com/the-affordance-loop">online structures of refuge and exposure</a>. In a draft of what I meant to be the second post in the series, I tried to write a tight two or three paragraphs about the role Meta played in the genocide of the Rohingya people in Myanmar, and why it made me dubious about Threads. Over time, those two or three paragraphs turned into a long summary, then a detailed timeline, then an unholy hybrid of blog post and research paper.</p>
<p>What I learned in the process was so starkly awful that I finally set the whole series aside for a while until I could do a lot more reading and write something more substantial. Nearly three months later, I’m ready to share my notes.</p>
<p>Here’s a necessary personal disclosure: I’ve never trusted Facebook, mostly because I’ve been around tech for a long time and everything I’ve ever learned about the company looked like a red flag. Like, I’m <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/06/everything-we-know-about-facebooks-secret-mood-manipulation-experiment/373648/">on the record</a> swearing about it.</p>
<p>But once I started to really dig in, what I learned was so much gnarlier and grosser and more devastating than what I’d assumed. The harms Meta passively and actively fueled destroyed or ended hundreds of thousands of lives that might have been yours or mine, but for accidents of birth. I say<span></span> <span>“</span>hundreds of thousands” because<span></span> <span>“</span>millions” sounds unbelievable, but by the end of my research I came to believe that the actual number is very, very large.</p>
<p>To make sense of it, I had to try to go back, reset my assumptions, and try build up a detailed, factual understanding of what happened in this one tiny slice of the world’s experience with Meta. The risks and harms in Myanmar—and their connection to Meta’s platform—are meticulously documented. And if you’re willing to spend time in the documents, it’s not that hard to piece together what happened.</p>
<p>I started down this path—in this series, on this site, over this whole year—because I want to help make better technologies and systems in service of a better world. And I think the only way to make better things is to thoroughly understand what’s happened so far. Put another way, I want to base decisions on transparently sourced facts and cautiously reasoned analysis, not on assumptions or vibes—mine or anyone else’s.</p>
<p>What I want to promise you, my imaginary reader, is that I’ve approached this with as much care and precision as I can. I cite a lot of documentation from humanitarian organizations and many well-sourced media reports, and also a bunch of internal Meta documentation. What I’m after is maybe something like a <em>cultural-technical incident report</em>. I hope it helps.</p>
<p>This is the first of four posts in the series. Thank you for reading.</p>
<p>I’ve put notes about terms (Meta vs.&nbsp;Facebook, Myanmar vs.&nbsp;Burma, etc.) and sources and warnings in a <a href="https://erinkissane.com/meta-meta">separate meta-post</a>. If you’re someone who likes to know about that kind of thing, you might want to pop that post open in a tab. If you spot typos or inaccuracies, I’m reachable at erin at incisive.nu and appreciate all bug reports.</p>
<p><strong>Content warning:</strong> I’m marking some sections and some cited sources with individual warnings, but this is a story with a genocide at its heart, so be aware of that going in. I’ve also included a small selection of hateful messages in this post and throughout the series so that it’s clear what we’re talking about when we talk about<span></span> <span>“</span>hate speech.” Some contain words that, used in specific contexts, constitute slurs. I put some notes about all of that in the <a href="https://erinkissane.com/meta-meta">meta post</a> as well.</p>
<h2 id="this-is-a-story-about-tech">This is a story about tech</h2>
<p>Even if you never read any further, know this: Facebook played what the lead investigator on the <span>UN</span> Human Rights Council’s Independent International Fact-Finding Mission on Myanmar (hereafter just<span></span> <span>“</span>the <span>UN</span> Mission”) <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-myanmar-rohingya-facebook/u-n-investigators-cite-facebook-role-in-myanmar-crisis-idUSKCN1GO2PN">called a<span></span> <span>“</span>determining role”</a> in the bloody emergence of what would become the genocide of the Rohingya people in Myanmar.<a href="#footnote-2U21" id="ref-2U21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>From far away, I think Meta’s role in the Rohingya crisis can feel blurry and debatable—it was content moderation fuckups, right? In a country they weren’t paying much attention to? Unethical and probably negligent, but come on, what tech company isn’t, at some point?</p>
<p>Plus, Meta has popped up in the press and <a href="https://wapo.st/44kiijx">before Congress</a> to admit that they fucked up and have concrete plans to do better. They lost sleep over it, <a href="https://slate.com/technology/2018/03/facebooks-alleged-role-in-myanmars-violence-is-deeply-concerning-says-facebooks-news-feed-chief.html">said Adam Mosseri</a>, the person in charge of Facebook’s News Feed, back in March of 2018.</p>
<p>By that point in 2018, Myanmar’s military had murdered thousands of Rohingya people, including babies and children, and beaten, raped, tortured, starved, and imprisoned thousands more. About <em>three-quarters of a million</em> Rohingya had fled Myanmar to live in huge, disease-infested refugee camps in Bangladesh.</p>
<p>And Meta?</p>
<p>By that point, Meta had been receiving detailed and increasingly desperate warnings about Facebook’s role as an accelerant of genocidal propaganda in Myanmar for <em>six years</em>.</p>
<hr>
<p>My big hope for the internet is that we handle the shit we need to handle to make sturdier, less poisoned/poisonous ways to connect and collaborate in the gnarly-looking decades ahead. I think that’s not just <em>possible</em>, but that it’s our responsibility to work toward it. Also, I’m pretty sure that despite the best intentions and the most transparent processes, we risk doing enormous harm if we don’t learn from the past. (Maybe even if we do.)</p>
<p>This series is for anyone who, like me—and despite everything not good about the tech world—has found themselves periodically heartened and sustained by open technology projects, online communities, and ways of being together even when we’re far apart.</p>
<p>And the thing I want you, and all of us, to remember about the sudden flowering of the internet in Myanmar in the 2010s is that in the beginning, it was incredibly welcome and so filled with hope.</p>
<h2 id="welcome-to-the-internet">Welcome to the internet</h2>
<p>After decades of crushing state repression, a more democratic regime came into power in Myanmar in 2011 and gradually relaxed restrictions on the internet, and on speech more generally. Journalist and tech researcher Faine Greenwood (they/them) is working in Southeast Asia at the time, and gets <a href="https://faineg.com/facebook-destroys-everything-part-1/">caught up in the spirit of the moment</a>, despite their skepticism about the benefits of the internet:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I’d connected with a Myanmar <span>NGO</span> dedicated to digital inclusion, and through them, I got a chance to meet and interview a number of brilliant and extremely online Burmese people, all of them brimming with long-suppressed, almost giddy, optimism about their country’s technological future.</p>
<p>It was hard for me not to share their enthusiasm, their massive relief at finally getting out from under the jackboot of a military regime that had tried to lock them away from the rest of their world for as long as they could remember. I came away from speaking with them with a warm, happy feeling about how online communication maybe, just maybe, really did have the power to unfuck the world.<a href="#footnote-3U21" id="ref-3U21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>And online communication was coming in fast, as the price of <span>SIM</span> cards, which had been controlled by the ruling junta, dropped from the equivalent of $2,000 <span>USD</span> in 2009, to $250 in 2012, to $1.50 in 2014.<a href="#footnote-4U21" id="ref-4U21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a></p>

<p>In 2015, writer and photographer Craig Mod is working with a team doing internet ethnography in rural Myanmar on behalf of an organization that designs and builds hardware—including modern farming implements—to improve the lives of farmers, who make up the majority of Myanmar’s populace. (Disclosure: Craig and I have halfass-known each other for going on a couple of decades, and I’m a longtime fan of his work.)</p>
<p><a href="https://craigmod.com/essays/smartphones_in_myanmar/">Mod’s essay about his work</a> is clearly the product of a sensitive eye and a nerd’s delight in the way new technology twines up with the unevenly distributed realities of daily life:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The village still lacks electricity although they’ve pooled funds and a dozen newly planted metal-power poles dot the fields, waiting to be wired up. Through our interpreter I ask, Where do you charge? Farmer Number Ten points to a car battery hanging in the corner onto which familiar <span>USB</span> wires are spliced.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The tech is all over the place,<span></span> <span>“</span>cheap but capable,” and Craig wonders if the one-smartphone-per-human result would <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Laptop_per_Child">make Nicholas Negroponte happy</a>. There are no iPhones, no credit cards, no data plans:<span></span> <span>“</span>Everyone buys top-up from top-up shops, scratches off complex serial numbers printed in a small font, types them with special network codes into their phone dialers in a way that feels steampunkish, like they’re divining data. They feel each megabyte.”<a href="#footnote-7U21" id="ref-7U21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<hr>
<p>This is the point in the conversation when it becomes impossible not to talk about Facebook. Because in Myanmar, even back in 2012 and 2013, being online meant being on Facebook.</p>
<p>I’d read about Facebook’s superdominance in Amnesty International’s reporting, in long stories from Reuters and <em>Wired</em> and the <em><span>NYT</span></em> and the <em>Guardian</em>, in books, even in <span>UN</span> reports. But Mod’s notes bring to life both Facebook’s pervasiveness and the way Burmese people actually used it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We ask about apps. The farmer uses [chat app] Viber and Facebook. He says he chats with a few friends on Facebook but mainly people he doesn’t know. Most of his Facebook friends are strangers. He tells us his brother installed the app for him, and set up his account. He doesn’t know the email address that was used. He gets most of his news from Facebook. The election looms and he loves the political updates.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Farmer Number Ten tells us he used to use radio for news but no more. He says he hasn’t turned the radio on in years. Other news apps—like one called TZ—use too much data. He’s data conscious. He uses Facebook mostly at night when the internet is fastest, and cheapest.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And speaking with the proprietor of a cellphone shop:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Facebook is the most popular app, he says. Nine out of ten people who come into the shop want Facebook. Ten months ago <span>SIM</span> prices dropped, data prices dropped, interest in Facebook jumped. I take note. Only half the people who come into the shop already have a Facebook account. The other half don’t know how to make one. I do that for them, he says. I am the account maker.</p>
<p>And what about other apps? He mentions a news app called <span>TZ</span>. Once popular, now less so. He brushes his hand aside and says it’s too data hungry. Everyone is data sensitive he says and reiterates: Facebook. Nobody needs a special app for their interests. Just search for your interest on Facebook. Facebook is the Internet.<a href="#footnote-8U21" id="ref-8U21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>But how did Facebook get to be the internet?</p>
<p>In the early years, there’s a stripped-down version of the app kicking around that used less data than competitors’. But also, when Myanmar’s government opens up to two foreign telecom services, the stronger of the two, Norway’s Telenor,<span></span> <span>“</span>zero-rates” Facebook.<a href="#footnote-9U21" id="ref-9U21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> Essentially, <a href="https://www.accessnow.org/zero-rating-global-threat-open-internet/">zero-rating is a selective subsidy</a>; it means that customers won’t be charged for the data they use for some parts of the internet, but not others. For all of Telenor’s customers, using Facebook is free.</p>
<p>I want to briefly flip ahead to something Meta whistleblower Frances Haugen says in a 2021 interview:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Facebook bought the privilege of being the internet for the majority of languages in the world. It subsidized people’s use of its own platform, and said<span></span> <span>“</span>Hey, you can use anything you want, but you’ll have to pay for that—or you can use our platform for free.” As a result, for the majority of languages in the world, 80 or 90% of all the content in that exists in those languages is on Facebook.<a href="#footnote-10U21" id="ref-10U21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>That this explosion of connectivity presented dangers as well as freedoms is immediately clear to civil society orgs in Myanmar, for two main reasons: The first is the state of comparative innocence with which the vast majority of Burmese people approach the internet. The second is that the political situation in Myanmar is a powderkeg at best.</p>
<p>There’s a third thing, though most people don’t know it yet, which is that Meta’s decision-making about Myanmar reflects no willingness to adjust for the first two. To get to that, we need to start at the beginning.</p>
<h2 id="the-blogger-and-the-monk">The blogger and the monk</h2>
<p>A tiny canned history of modern Myanmar might go like this: In a series of East-India-Company–entangled conflicts, the British Empire took control of Myanmar, then called Burma. From the beginning of the wars in 1824 to 1948, Britain ruled Burma, with a big rupture during <span>WWII</span> when Japan invaded Burma.</p>

<p>After the war, the Burmese government the British left behind was too weak to withstand the combination of vigorous civil conflict with ethnic minorities on the frontiers and a 1962 coup by military leaders.</p>
<p>Beginning in 1962, Burma—renamed Myanmar in English by the ruling junta, but the two names come from the same root—is under incredibly tight military rule. Beginning in 2011, the junta relaxes their grip, and Myanmar begins a precarious transition to a more democratic form of government. Note: All through this entire period, Myanmar’s military, the Tatmadaw, is also waging a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_conflict_in_Myanmar">70-year civil war</a> with armed insurgencies associated with several different ethnic minorities.</p>
<p>Starting the year after Myanmar’s first quasi-democratic general election in 2010, the Burmese government begins granting mass amnesties to the country’s many political prisoners. Hundreds of people—journalists, activists, artists, religious leaders, and many more—are released over the next few years.</p>
<p>In the mass amnesty granted in January of 2012, two of the many prisoners released will go on to found organizations that play major and opposing roles in escalating crises of communal and military violence that Myanmar’s entry to the internet will fuel.</p>
<p>One is Nay Phone Latt, an early blogger and digital rights activist, who was jailed in 2008, <a href="https://ifex.org/imprisoned-burmese-blogger-nay-phone-latt-to-receive-top-pen-honor/">basically for blogging</a> about the 2007 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saffron_Revolution">Saffron Revolution</a> demonstrations. <a href="https://www.burmalink.org/really-worried-countrys-future/">Nay Phone Latt will go on to co-found <span>MIDO</span></a>, an organization dedicated to helping Myanmar’s ordinary citizens reap the benefits of the newly available internet. Over the next several years, <span>MIDO</span> will come up repeatedly in the intense struggle against online hate campaigns, especially on Facebook.<a href="#footnote-11U21" id="ref-11U21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<p>The second is Ashin Wirathu, a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2017/may/12/only-takes-one-terrorist-buddhist-monk-reviles-myanmar-muslims-rohingya-refugees-ashin-wirathu">Buddhist monk jailed in 2003</a> for sermons inciting violence against Myanmar’s Muslim communities.<a href="#footnote-12U21" id="ref-12U21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a> Wirathu will go on to digitize Myanmar’s hardline extremist Buddhist movement, which will play a major role in the coming waves of anti-Muslim violence—also especially on Facebook.</p>
<hr>
<p>In 2013, Faine Greenwood goes back to Myanmar to write about the country’s first Internet Freedom Forum,<span></span> <span>“</span>a gathering dedicated to helping Myanmar’s people take advantage of the new, liberated Internet.” Faine writes about the heady vibes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Nay Phone Latt spoke at the conference, and so did a number of the other brilliant young Burmese tech enthusiasts I’d met before. The mood was still buoyantly optimistic as we circulated from one Post-It note-filled brainstorming session to the next, as we drank tea, discussed Internet freedom regulations and online privacy.</p>
<p>And yet, I could detect a slight edge in the air, a certain trepidation that had grown, mutated into new forms, in the few months since I’d been away […] During the conference, we talked about how hateful talk about the Rohingya was starting to pop up on Facebook, about how it was casting an ominous shadow over the good things about helping more people get online.<a href="#footnote-13U21" id="ref-13U21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The edge in the air and the ominous shadow aren’t just vague feelings—they’re connected to a surge in communal violence the same year of that critical mass amnesty, and to a parallel rise in online hate speech.</p>
<p><span>MIDO</span> co-founder and program director Htaike Htaike Aung spoke on the online dynamics she and her colleagues encountered in the early days:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Unlike in countries where people gradually got used to the Internet and learnt how to find good content, thus learning what is bad content, for Myanmar this hype went straight up and people did not have the time to reflect on what the Internet is actually about. This perception can be summarized in the phrase:<span></span> <span>“</span>Okay, if it’s on the Internet it must be right”. This really is dangerous, particularly if there are people who are using the Internet for the wrong agenda and propaganda.<a href="#footnote-14U21" id="ref-14U21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In 2014, Nay Phone Latt explains <a href="https://www.irrawaddy.com/in-person/hate-speech-pours-poison-heart.html">what he’s seeing and why he’s worried about it</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When we advocate for free speech, reducing hate speech is included.… Speech calling for hitting or killing someone is hate speech, and can spread hate among people and is a risk for society… It is the wrong use of freedom of speech. I am worried about that because it is not only spreading on social media but also by some writers and [Buddhist] monks who are spreading hate speech publicly. […]</p>
<p>If people hate each other, a place will not be safe to live. I worry about that most for our society. In some places, although they are not fighting, hate exists within their heart because they have poured poison into their heart for a long time [through hate speech]. It can explode in anytime.<a href="#footnote-15U21" id="ref-15U21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>So what were Htaike Htaike Aung and Nay Phone Latt and their colleagues seeing that made them so worried? Here are some Facebook comments from all the way back in 2011, sparked by the <span>BBC</span><span></span><span>’</span>s audacity in…<a href="https://www.newmandala.org/bbc-under-fire-on-rohingyas/">referring to Rohingya people as a ethnic group that exists in Myanmar</a> <em>at all</em>. The <span>BBC</span><span></span><span>’</span>s offending infographic had been up for a year before the <span>BBC</span><span></span><span>’</span>s Burmese Facebook page was flooded with comments:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Kick out all Muslim Kalar [Rohingyas, South Asians/Indians] from Burma. If this doesn’t work, then kill them to death. It’s time for Arakan to unite with each other.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Don’t assume that I won’t sharpen my knife. I am ready to make it sharp for the sake of protecting our nation, religion and races against those Bengali cheaters.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>F@#$-ing Kalar, we will slap your face with shoes and cut your heads. Don’t criticize the god with little of what you know. We will set you on fire to death and turn the mosques into wholesales/retail pork markets…<a href="#footnote-16U21" id="ref-16U21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The <a href="https://www.newmandala.org/bbc-under-fire-on-rohingyas/">New Mandala article</a> about the controversy includes memes mocking <span>BBC</span> journalist Anna Jones using vintage 4chan trollface visuals, if that helps situate things for you.</p>
<p>So this is the landscape already in place <em>before</em> Nay Phone Latt was released from prison in 2012. And things don’t get any better as Facebook/internet adoption spikes.</p>
<p>We know now that behind the scenes, Burmese activists and organizations—and concerned westerners—spent this period desperately trying to get Facebook to act on the rapidly rising surge of anti-Rohingya hate speech. But neither those efforts nor public educational/digital literacy campaigns can keep up with what’s happening online.</p>
<h2 id="the-rohingya">The Rohingya</h2>
<p>I need to make a brief detour, about the Rohingya. Here’s Médicins Sans Frontières, from their <a href="https://www.msf.org/rohingya-refugee-crisis-depth">reference page about the Rohingya refugee crisis</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Rohingya are a stateless ethnic group, the majority of whom are Muslim, who have lived for centuries in the majority Buddhist&nbsp;Myanmar, mostly in the country’s north, in Rakhine state. However, Myanmar authorities contest this; they claim the Rohingya are Bengali immigrants who came to Myanmar in the 20th century.</p>
<p>Described by the United Nations in 2013 as one of the most persecuted minorities in the world, the Rohingya are denied citizenship under Myanmar law. <a href="#footnote-17U21" id="ref-17U21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>It’s hard to overstate how contested those basic facts are within Myanmar itself, where successive governments have rejected any recognition of Rohingya <em>existence</em>, let along legitimacy, referring to them instead as illegal<span></span> <span>“</span>Bengali” immigrants.<a href="#footnote-18U21" id="ref-18U21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a> (The Rohingya Culture Center in Chicago has published a <a href="https://rccchicago.org/history-of-the-rohingya/">concise timeline of Rohingya history</a>, and it makes a good, quick orientation.<a href="#footnote-19U21" id="ref-19U21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>19</sup></a>)</p>
<p>Going deeper, things get immediately, bogglingly complicated. My background is inadequate to the task of explaining the entangled ethnic, religious, and political histories of Myanmar in even just Rakhine (formerly Arakan) State, where the Rohingya crisis takes place. What you need to know to understand this series is mostly just that Rohingya people do in fact exist and have long lived under <a href="https://www.hrw.org/report/2020/10/08/open-prison-without-end/myanmars-mass-detention-rohingya-rakhine-state">crushing restrictions</a>. Also that Myanmar’s Buddhist political mainstream has long been concerned with racial purity and security. And openly so: the official motto of the Ministry of Immigration and Population is:<span></span> <span>“</span>The&nbsp;earth will not swallow&nbsp;a&nbsp;race&nbsp;to&nbsp;extinction but another race will.”<a href="#footnote-20U21" id="ref-20U21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>20</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="the-rumors-and-the-killings-2012">The rumors and the killings (2012)</h2>

<p><strong>Content warning:</strong> Violence against men, women, and children.</p>
<p>On the 28th of May, 2012, a Buddhist Rakhine woman called Ma Thida Htwe is killed in a village in Rakhine State. The next day, a newspaper reports that she was raped and murdered by<span></span> <span>“</span>kalars” and calls the killing<span></span> <span>“</span>the worst homicide case in Myanmar.” Almost immediately, graphic photos of her body begin circulating online. <a href="#footnote-21U21" id="ref-21U21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>21</sup></a></p>
<p>The findings of <span>UN</span> Mission note that although Ma Thida Htwe was clearly murdered, both the rape allegation and ethnic origin of the suspected culprits remain in doubt, and that,<span></span> <span>“</span>In the following days and weeks, it was mainly the rape allegation, more than the murder, which was used to incite violence and hatred against the Rohingya.”<a href="#footnote-22U21" id="ref-22U21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>22</sup></a></p>
<p>For the people who’ve been working to whip up anti-Rohingya hatred and violence, the crime against Ma Thida Htwe is a perfect opportunity—and they use it, immediately, to suggest that it’s merely the leading edge of a coming wave of attacks by Rohingya terrorists. Four days after Ma Thida Htwe’s death, on June 1st, Zaw Htay, the spokesman of the President of Myanmar, posts a statement on Facebook warning that<span></span> <span>“</span>Rohingya terrorists” are<span></span> <span>“</span>crossing the border into Myanmar with weapons.” He goes on:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We don’t want to hear any humanitarian or human rights excuses. We don’t want to hear your moral superiority, or so-called peace and loving kindness.… Our ethnic people are in constant fear in their own land. I feel very bitter about this. This is our country. This is our land.<a href="#footnote-23U21" id="ref-23U21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>23</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>On June 3rd, five days after the Rakhine woman’s murder, a nationalist Buddhist group hands out leaflets in a village in southern Rakhine State stating that Muslims are assaulting Buddhist women. A bus carrying ten Rohingya men attempts to pass through the village that same day, and the villagers haul the men out, beat them to death, and destroy the bus. A few days later, Rohingya people in a nearby town riot, killing Buddhist villagers and burning homes. <a href="#footnote-24U21" id="ref-24U21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>24</sup></a></p>

<p>In <a href="https://www.newmandala.org/intolerance-islam-and-the-internet-in-burma-today/">an article published on the academic regional analysis site New Mandala</a> only seven days after the Rohingya men are killed in Rakhine State, Burmese PhD candidate Sai Latt writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What actually triggered public anger? It may have been racial profiling by the ethnic Arakan news agency, Narinjara… When the rape incident took place, the agency published news identifying the accused with their Islamic faith. In its Burmese language news, the incident was presented as if Muslims [read aliens] were threatening local people, and now they have raped and brutally killed a woman. The words—Muslims, Kalar, Islam—were repeatedly used in its news reports. The news spread and people started talking about it in terms of Kalar and<span></span> <span>“</span>Lu Myo Char [i.e.&nbsp;different race/people or alien] insulting our woman”.</p>
<p>Interestingly, Naranjara and Facebook users started talking about the accused rapists as Kalars even when the backgrounds of the accused were still unclear.<a href="#footnote-25U21" id="ref-25U21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>25</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the wave of military and communal violence that follows, members of both Rakhine (the dominant Buddhist ethnicity in Rakhine State) and Rohingya communities commit murder and arson, but the brunt of the attacks falls on the Rohingya. The <span>UN</span> Mission’s findings describe house-burning, looting,<span></span> <span>“</span>extrajudicial and indiscriminate killings, including of women, children and elderly people,” and the<span></span> <span>“</span>mass arbitrary arrests” and torture of Rohingya people by soldiers and police. More than 100,000 people, most of them Rohinyga, are forced from their homes. <a href="#footnote-26U21" id="ref-26U21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>26</sup></a></p>
<p>The next wave of violence comes in October and shows evidence of coordinated planning. According to Human Rights Watch, the fall attacks were<span></span> <span>“</span>organized, incited, and committed by local Arakanese political party operatives, the Buddhist monkhood, and ordinary Arakanese, at times directly supported by state security forces.” The attacks included mass killings of Rohingya men, women, and children, whose villages and homes were burned to the ground, sometimes in simultaneous attacks across geographically distant communities.</p>
<p>In the worst attack that October, police and soldiers in Myanmar’s military, the Tatmadaw, preemptively confiscate sticks and other rudimentary weapons from Rohingya villagers, then stand by and watch while a Rakhine mob murders at least 70 Rohingya people over the course of a single day.</p>
<p>Human Rights Watch reports that 28 children are hacked to death in the attack, including 13 children under the age of 5.<a href="#footnote-27U21" id="ref-27U21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>27</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="every-spark-is-more-likely-to-turn-into-a-fire">Every spark is more likely to turn into a fire</h2>
<p>According to many of Amnesty International’s interviews with Rohingya refugees, the 2012 episodes of communal violence mark the turning point of Myanmar’s slide into intense anti-Rohingya rhetoric, persecution, and, ultimately, genocide. Mohamed Ayas, a Rohingya schoolteacher and refugee, puts it this way:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We used to live together peacefully alongside the other ethnic groups in Myanmar. Their intentions were good to the Rohingya, but the government was against us. The public used to follow their religious leaders, so when the religious leaders and government started spreading hate speech on Facebook, the minds of the people changed.<a href="#footnote-28U21" id="ref-28U21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>28</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoDPsIOSM8c">short 2013 documentary</a>, journalist and filmmaker Aela Callan interviews Richard Horsey, a Myanmar-based political analyst with decades of experience in the country and (now, at least) advisor to The International Crisis Group.</p>
<p>Horsey’s take on the situation in Myanmar accords with the Amnesty interviews:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We’ve seen violence in previous decades by Buddhist populations against Muslim populations, but what’s new is that this information is readily available and transmissible. People are using Facebook and mobile phones, and so you get a much greater resonation every time there’s an issue. Every time there’s a spark, it’s much more likely to turn into a fire.<a href="#footnote-29U21" id="ref-29U21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>29</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the months between the June and October waves of violence in Myanmar, dehumanizing and violence-inciting anti-Rohingya messages continue to circulate on Burmese-language Facebook. Western observers who fly in to conduct investigations emphasize town-hall meetings and pamphlets spreading hateful and violent rhetoric, but—while noting that it was also surging online—write off the internet as a major influence on the events because internet access remains unusual in rural Rakhine State.<a href="#footnote-30U21" id="ref-30U21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>30</sup></a></p>
<p>The very early and very strong concerns of Burmese observers and activists I’ve cited above—Htaike Htaike Aung, Nay Phone Latt, and Sai Latt—about hate speech on <em>Facebook specifically</em> suggest to me that it’s possible that western observers may have underestimated the role of secondhand transmission of internet-circulated ideas, including <em>printed copies</em> of internet propaganda, which are cited as a vector in an interview with another <span>MIDO</span> co-founder, Phyu Phyu Thi. (This exact dynamic—the printed internet—shows up in Sheera Frenkel’s <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/sheerafrenkel/fake-news-spreads-trump-around-the-world">2016 BuzzFeed News article</a>, which cites<span></span> <span>“</span>print magazines called Facebook and The Internet.”)<a href="#footnote-31U21" id="ref-31U21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>31</sup></a></p>
<p>In any case, online and off, hardline Buddhist monks, members of the government, and what <em>appear</em> to be ordinary people are all echoing a few distinct ideas: They claim that the Rohingya are not a real ethnic group, but illegal<span></span> <span>“</span>Bengali” immigrants; subhuman animals who<span></span> <span>“</span>outbreed” Buddhists; indistinguishable from terrorists; an immediate danger to the sexual purity and safety of Buddhist women and to Buddhist Myanmar as a whole. <a href="#footnote-32U21" id="ref-32U21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>32</sup></a></p>

<p>Sai Latt writes in June 2012 that the anti-Rohingya hate campaign is<span></span> <span>“</span>a public and transnational movement orchestrated openly on social media websites,” which includes thousands of people from the Burmese diaspora:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The campaign is so severe that such comments and postings have been littered on thousands of Facebook walls and pages. Thousands of Burmese-speaking Facebook users are exposed to them every single day. Many Facebook groups such as<span></span> <span>“</span>Kalar Beheading Gang” appeared one after another. While it is possible to report abuse to Facebook, there were few Burmese Muslim Facebook users who would report to Facebook. Even when they did successfully, new groups keep appearing frequently.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That Facebook Page,<span></span> <span>“</span>Kalar Beheading Gang,” shows up in the international press as well. It features<span></span> <span>“</span>an illustration of a grim reaper with an Islamic symbol on its robe on a blood-spattered background,” and a stream of graphic photos presented as evidence of Rohingya atrocities. By the time the <em>Hindustan Times</em> article goes to press on June 14, 2012, the Page already has more than 500 likes.<a href="#footnote-33U21" id="ref-33U21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>33</sup></a></p>
<p>When Sai Latt says that what he’s seeing on Facebook is an orchestrated movement, he’s right. Remember Wirathu, the Buddhist monk released in the same amnesty as <span>MIDO</span><span></span><span>’</span>s Nay Phone Latt? Soon after his release from prison, he’s one of the people doing the orchestrating.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvEBaAiy5b4">2013 video interview with the Global Post</a>, Wirathu speaks placidly about the possibility of interfaith problem-solving and multi-ethnic peace—and then, with no transition or change of tone, about Muslims<span></span> <span>“</span>devouring the Burmese people, destroying Buddhist and Buddhist order, forcefully taking action to establish Myanmar as an Islamic country, and forcefully implementing them.” To these absolute fantasies—Muslims make up maybe five percent of Myanmar’s population at this time—Wirathu adds that,<span></span> <span>“</span>Muslims are like the African carp. They breed quickly and they are very violent and they eat their own kind.”<a href="#footnote-36U21" id="ref-36U21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>36</sup></a></p>

<p>In 2013, <em>Time</em> puts Wirathu on the cover of its international editions as<span></span> <span>“</span><a href="https://content.time.com/time/subscriber/article/0,33009,2146000,00.html">The Face of Buddhist Terror</a>.” <em>Time</em> reporter Hannah Beech quotes him in the cover story explaining that 90% of Muslims in Myanmar are<span></span> <span>“</span>radical bad people,” and that Barack Obama is<span></span> <span>“</span>tainted by black Muslim blood.“ <a href="#footnote-37U21" id="ref-37U21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>37</sup></a></p>
<p><img src="https://erinkissane.com/_files/time_cover.jpg" alt="Cover of Time's international editions for July 1, 2013. The photo shows Ashin Wirathu, a Burmese man wearing the crimson robe of a Buddhist monk. His head is shaved and his expression is thoughtful. The cover text reads The Face of Buddhist Terror, in progressively large type, and underneath, How militant monks are fueling anti-Muslim violence in Asia, by Hannah Beech."></p>

<p>It would be hard to overstate Wirathu’s influence in Myanmar during the years leading up to the beginning of the Rohingya genocide. One <span>NGO</span> writes that,<span></span> <span>“</span>It is noteworthy that almost every major outbreak of communal violence since October 2012 in Rakhine state has been preceded by a 969-sponsored preaching tour in the area, usually by [Wirathu] himself.”<a href="#footnote-38U21" id="ref-38U21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>38</sup></a> In fact, the same thing is true of the 2012 violence, though from a little further away: Wirathu led a rally in Mandalay in September of 2012 in support of a proposal by then-President Thein Sein to deport the Rohingya en masse. The worst of the violence in Rakhine State took place the very next month.<a href="#footnote-39U21" id="ref-39U21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>39</sup></a></p>
<p>I think it’s useful to note that the 969/Ma Bha Tha movement Wirathu is associated with is also a force for practical and immediate good among Myanmar’s Buddhist majority—they run or support lots of Buddhist religious education for children, legal aid, donation drives, and relief campaigns. And these things, along with the high esteem in which monks are generally held in Myanmar, makes them seem exceptionally credible.<a href="#footnote-40U21" id="ref-40U21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>40</sup></a></p>
<p>Wirathu himself is beloved not only for his incendiary sermons that<span></span> <span>“</span>defend” Buddhism by demonizing Muslims, but also for his direct involvement in community support. If the project of supporting and defending Buddhism is extended to eliminating the Rohingya, maybe those two kinds of action blur. In Callan’s documentary, Wirathu holds office hours to help ordinary community members solve problems and disputes. His attention flicks constantly between the petitioners kneeling in front of him and the smartphone cradled in his hand.</p>
<p>A few years later, Wirathu—by then running a Facebook empire with nearly 200,000 followers, dozens of Pages, and a full-time staff—sums up the situation:<span></span> <span>“</span>If the internet had not come to [Myanmar], not many people would know my opinion and messages like now,” Wirathu told BuzzFeed News, adding that he had always written books and delivered sermons but that the<span></span> <span>“</span>internet is a faster way to spread the messages.” <a href="#footnote-41U21" id="ref-41U21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>41</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="a-quick-aside">A quick aside</h2>
<p>I don’t want to spend much time on my process, but I do want to make a note about the provenance of a document that would otherwise have unclear sourcing.</p>
<p>Several accounts of Meta’s role in Myanmar’s persecution of the Rohingya include partial lists of the <em>many</em> warnings people on the ground in Burma—and concerned international human-rights watchers—delivered to Meta executives between 2012 and 2018. Taking on the implications of that litany of warnings and missed chances is what first gave me the first taste of the sinking dread that has characterized my experience of this project.</p>
<p>Because of citations in Amnesty International’s big Meta/Myanmar report, I knew there was a<span></span> <span>“</span>briefing deck” floating around somewhere that had more details, but the closest reference I could find led to a dead <span>URL</span> that Archive.org didn’t have, and emailing around didn’t turn anything up.</p>
<p>Eventually, I found a version of it on a French timeline-making site in the form of a <a href="https://time.graphics/fr/line/701589">heavily annotated timeline</a>, and cross-referenced that version with tweets from <a href="https://twitter.com/barnyar/status/1575356987529134080">Htaike Htaike Aung</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/riovictoire/status/1575339725333975040">Victoire Rio</a>, the women credited in the Amnesty report with making the deck. The <span>URL</span> they link to in the tweets is the dead one, but the preview image in their tweets is an exact match for the timeline I found. I cite this timeline a lot below.</p>
<h2 id="the-warnings">The warnings</h2>
<p><a href="https://time.graphics/fr/line/701589"><img src="https://erinkissane.com/_files/rohingya_and_facebook.png" alt="The timeline showing Burmese civil-society and digital-rights leaders' attempts to warn Meta about what it was enabling in Myanmar."></a></p>
<p><em>Screenshot of the timeline discussed above.</em></p>
<p>All the way back in <strong>November of 2012</strong>, <strong>Htaike Htaike Aung</strong>, <span>MIDO</span><span></span><span>’</span>s program director, speaks with Meta’s Director of Global Public Policy and Policy Director for Europe about the proliferation of hate speech on Facebook at a roundtable in Azerbaijan. Eleven months later, in <strong>October 2013</strong>, <strong>Htaike Htaike Aung</strong> brings up her concerns again in the context of<span></span> <span>“</span>rising inter-communal tensions” at a roundtable discussion in Indonesia attended by three Meta policy executives including the Director of Global Public Policy.<a href="#footnote-42U21" id="ref-42U21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>42</sup></a></p>
<p>At the same time, activists and researchers from <span>MIDO</span> and Yangon-based tech-accelerator Phandeeyar<span></span> <span>“</span>followed up over email to ask for ways to get Facebook to review problematic content and address emergency escalations.” Facebook didn’t respond. <span>MIDO</span> and Phandeeyar staff start doing<span></span> <span>“</span>targeted research on hate speech.”<a href="#footnote-43U21" id="ref-43U21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>43</sup></a></p>
<p>In <strong>November of 2013</strong>, <strong>Aela Callan</strong> (whose documentary work I’ve cited) meets with Facebook’s <span>VP</span> of Communications and Public Policy, Eliot Schrage, to warn about anti-Rohingya hate speech—and the fake accounts promoting it—on Facebook.<a href="#footnote-44U21" id="ref-44U21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>44</sup></a> After her visit, Meta puts Callan in touch with <a href="http://internet.org/">Internet.org</a>—the global initiative that would eventually cement Facebook’s hegemony in Myanmar, among other places—and with Facebook’s bullying-focused<span></span> <span>“</span>Compassion Team,” but not with anyone inside Facebook who could actually help.<a href="#footnote-45U21" id="ref-45U21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>45</sup></a></p>
<p>In March 2014, four months before deadly, Facebook-juiced riots break out in Mandalay, <strong>Htaike Htaike Aung</strong> travels to Menlo Park <em>with</em> <strong>Aela Callan</strong> after <a href="https://www.rightscon.org/past-events/silicon-valley-2014/#:~:text=RightsCon%20Silicon%20Valley%202014%20was,to%20check%20out%20the%20Outcomes.">RightsCon Silicon Valley</a>. The two women met with members of Meta’s Compassion Team to try once again to get Facebook to pay attention to the threat its service poses in Myanmar. <a href="#footnote-46U21" id="ref-46U21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>46</sup></a></p>
<p>In the same month, <strong>Susan Benesch</strong>, head of the <a href="https://dangerousspeech.org/">Dangerous Speech Project</a>, coordinates a briefing call for Meta, attended by half a dozen Meta employees, including Arturo Bejar, head of engineering at Facebook.</p>
<p>On the call, <strong>Matt Schissler</strong>, a Myanmar-based human-rights specialist, delivers a grim assessment describing dehumanizing messages, faked photos, and misinformation spreading on Facebook. In <em>An Ugly Truth: Inside Facebook’s Battle for Domination</em>, their 2021 book about Facebook’s dysfunction, reporters Sheera Frenkel and Cecilia Kang describe Schissler’s presentation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Toward the end of the meeting, Schissler gave a stark recounting of how Facebook was hosting dangerous Islamophobia. He detailed the dehumanizing and disturbing language people were using in posts and the doctored photos and misinformation being spread widely.<a href="#footnote-47U21" id="ref-47U21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>47</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Reuters notes that one of the examples Schissler gives Meta was a Burmese Facebook Page called,<span></span> <span>“</span>We will genocide all of the Muslims and feed them to the dogs.” <a href="#footnote-48U21" id="ref-48U21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>48</sup></a></p>
<p>None of this seems to get through to the Meta employees on the line, who are interested in…cyberbullying. Frenkel and Kang write that the Meta employees on the call<span></span> <span>“</span>believed that the same set of tools they used to stop a high school senior from intimidating an incoming freshman could be used to stop Buddhist monks in Myanmar.”<a href="#footnote-49U21" id="ref-49U21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>49</sup></a></p>
<p>Aela Callan later tells <em>Wired</em> that hate speech seemed to be a<span></span> <span>“</span>low priority” for Facebook, and that the situation in Myanmar,<span></span> <span>“</span>was seen as a connectivity opportunity rather than a big pressing problem.”<a href="#footnote-50U21" id="ref-50U21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>50</sup></a></p>
<p>Then comes Mandalay.</p>
<h2 id="facebook-said-nothing"><span>“</span>Facebook said nothing”</h2>
<p>I don’t have space to tell the whole story of the 2014 Mandalay violence here—<a href="https://www.wired.com/story/how-facebooks-rise-fueled-chaos-and-confusion-in-myanmar/">Timothy McLaughlin’s <em>Wired</em> article</a> is good on it—but it has all the elements civil society watchdogs have been worried about: Two innocent Muslim men are falsely accused of raping a Buddhist woman, sensationalist news coverage explodes, and Ashin Wirathu exploits the story to further his cause. Riots break out, and all kinds of wild shit starts circulating on Facebook.</p>
<p>This is exactly the kind of situation Htaike Htaike Aung, Callan, Schissler, and others had been warning Meta could happen—but when it actually arrives, no one at Meta picks up the phone.</p>
<p>As the violence in Mandalay worsens, the head of Deloitte in Myanmar gets an urgent call. Zaw Htay, the official spokesman of Myanmar’s president, needs help reaching Meta. The Deloitte executive works into the night trying to get someone to respond, but never gets through. On the third day of rioting, the government gets tired of waiting and blocks access to Facebook in Mandalay. The block works—the riots died down. And the Deloitte guy’s inbox suddenly fills with emails from Meta staffers wanting to know why Facebook has been blocked.<a href="#footnote-51U21" id="ref-51U21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>51</sup></a></p>
<p>The government wasn’t the only group trying to get through. A few months before, a handful of Facebook employees—including members of policy, legal, and comms teams—had formed a private Facebook group, to allow some of the civil-society experts from Myanmar to flag problems to Facebook staff directly.</p>
<p>With false reports and calls to violence beginning to spread on Facebook in Mandalay, Burmese activists and westerners in the private group try to alert Facebook. They get no response, even after the violence turns deadly. A member of the group later tells Frenkel and Kang:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When it came to answering our messages about the riots, Facebook said nothing. When it came to the internet being shut down, and people losing Facebook, suddenly, they are returning messages right away. It showed where their priorities are.<a href="#footnote-52U21" id="ref-52U21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>52</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>A couple of weeks after the violence in Mandalay in 2014, Facebook’s Director of Policy for the Asia-Pacific region, Mia Garlick, travels to Myanmar for the first time. In a panel discussion, Garlick discusses Meta’s policies and promises to…speed up the translation of Facebook’s Community Standards (its basic content rules) into Burmese. That single piece of translation work—Facebook’s main offering in response to internationally significant ethnic violence about which the company has been warned for two years—takes Meta fourteen months to accomplish and relies, in the end, on the Phandeeyar folks in the private Facebook group.<a href="#footnote-53U21" id="ref-53U21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>53</sup></a></p>
<p>Also in 2014, Meta agrees to localize their reporting tool for hate speech and other objectionable content. Meta employees work with <span>MIDO</span> and other Burmese civil-society people to translate and fine-tune the tool, and they launch it by the end of 2014.</p>
<p>There’s just one problem: As the Burmese civil society people in the private Facebook group finally learn, Facebook has <em>a single Burmese-speaking moderator</em>—a contractor based in Dublin—to review everything that comes in. The Burmese-language reporting tool is, as Htaike Htaike Aung and Victoire Rio put it in their timeline,<span></span> <span>“</span>a road to nowhere.”<a href="#footnote-54U21" id="ref-54U21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>54</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="yet-more-warnings">Yet more warnings</h2>
<p>Heading into 2015, the warnings keep coming:</p>
<p><strong>February 2015:</strong> <strong>Susan Benesch</strong>, founder and director of the <a href="https://dangerousspeech.org/">Dangerous Speech Project</a> at the Berkman Klein Center (that’s the Berkman Center as was, for my fellow olds) gives a presentation called<span></span> <span>“</span>The Dangerous Side of Language” during <em>Compassion Day</em> at Facebook. According to <a href="https://digitalcommons.law.scu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3596&amp;context=historical">this legal filing</a> for a class-action suit against Meta on behalf of the Rohingya, the presentation explains<span></span> <span>“</span>how anti-Rohingya speech is being disseminated by Facebook.”<a href="#footnote-55U21" id="ref-55U21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>55</sup></a></p>
<p><strong>March 2015:</strong> <strong>Matt Schissler</strong> <a href="https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/myanmar-facebook-hate/">travels to Menlo Park</a> to meet with Facebook employees in person. Reuters reports that he<span></span> <span>“</span>gave a talk at Facebook’s California headquarters about new media, particularly Facebook, and anti-Muslim violence in Myanmar. More than a dozen Facebook employees attended, he said.” Frenkel and Kang describe his presentation as documenting<span></span> <span>“</span>the seriousness of what was happening in Myanmar: hate speech on Facebook was leading to real-world violence in the country, and it was getting people killed.”<a href="#footnote-56U21" id="ref-56U21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>56</sup></a></p>
<p>After his meeting at Meta, Schissler has lunch with a few Meta employees, and one of them asked Schissler if he thought Facebook could contribute to a genocide in Myanmar, to which Schissler responded,<span></span> <span>“</span>Absolutely.” Afterwards, Schissler tells Frenkel and Kang, one Facebook employee loudly remarks,<span></span> <span>“</span>He can’t be serious. That’s just not possible.”<a href="#footnote-57U21" id="ref-57U21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>57</sup></a></p>

<p><strong>May 2015:</strong> Another expert comes to Menlo Park to warn Facebook about the dangerous dynamics it was feeding in Myanmar: <strong>David Madden</strong>, founder of Phandeeyar, the technology accelerator in Myanmar. In an interview with Amnesty International, Madden reported that<span></span> <span>“</span>those of us who were working on these issues in Myanmar had a sense that people in Facebook didn’t appreciate the nature of the political situation in the country.”<a href="#footnote-58U21" id="ref-58U21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>58</sup></a></p>
<p>In his meeting with Meta, Madden discusses specific examples of dangerous content and drew a direct analogy between radio news in Rwanda and Meta’s role in Myanmar,<span></span> <span>“</span>meaning it would be the platform through which hate speech was spread and incitements to violence were made.”<a href="#footnote-59U21" id="ref-59U21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>59</sup></a></p>
<p><strong>September 2015:</strong> Mia Garlick, Facebook’s Director of Public Policy, Asia-Pacific, comes to Myanmar to <em>finally</em> launch Facebook’s Burmese-language Community Standards. Phandeeyar puts together a group of<span></span> <span>“</span>15+ civil-society leaders from across Myanmar” to brief Garlick<span></span> <span>“</span>on specific incidents and actors.”<a href="#footnote-60U21" id="ref-60U21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>60</sup></a></p>
<p>In an interview with Amnesty International, <strong>Victoire Rio</strong> reports that several of these leaders specifically tell Garlick that Facebook’s Community Standards aren’t being enforced in Myanmar.<a href="#footnote-61U21" id="ref-61U21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>61</sup></a></p>
<p>Which, of course they aren’t: Reuters reports that in 2015, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/myanmar-facebook-hate/">Facebook employed a total of two (2) Burmese-speaking moderators</a>, expanding to four (4) by the year’s end.<a href="#footnote-62U21" id="ref-62U21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>62</sup></a></p>
<hr>
<p>To sum up a little bit, by the end of 2015, Meta knew—as much as any organization can be said to <em>know</em>—that both international civil society experts <em>and the government of Myanmar</em> believe Facebook had a significant role in the 2014 Mandalay riots.</p>
<p>And they’d been warned, over and over, that multiple dedicated civil-society and human-rights organizations believed that Facebook was worsening ethnic conflict.</p>
<p>They’d been shown example after example of dehumanizing posts and comments calling for mass murder, even explicitly calling for genocide. And David Madden had told Meta staff to their faces that <em>Facebook might well play the role in Myanmar that radio played in Rwanda</em>. Nothing was subtle.</p>
<p>After all that, Meta decided not to dramatically scale up moderation capacity, to permanently ban the known worst actors, or to make fundamental product-design changes to reliably deviralize posts inciting hatred and violence.</p>
<p>Instead, in 2016, it was time to <em>get way more people in Myanmar onto Facebook</em>.</p>
<p><strong>That’s next, in Part <span>II</span>: The Crisis.</strong></p>
