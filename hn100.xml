--[ 0 - Preamble

Hi. 

I'm cts, also known as gf_256, ephemeral, or a number of other handles.
I am a hacker and now a small business owner and CEO. In this article, 
I would like to share my experience walking these two different paths.

A hacker is someone who understands how the world works. It's about 
knowing what happens when you type "google.com" and press Enter. It's 
about knowing how your computer turns on, about memory training, A20, 
all of that. It's about modern processors, their caches, and their side 
channels. It's about DSi bootloaders and how the right electromagnetic 
faults can be used to jailbreak them. And it's about how Spotify and 
Widevine and AES and SGX work so you can free your music from the 
shackles of DRM.

But being a hacker is so much more than these things. It's about knowing 
where to find things. Like libgen and Sci-Hub and nyaa. Or where to get 
into the latest IDA Pro group buy. Or which trackers have what and how 
to get into them.

It's about knowing how to bypass email verification. How to bypass SMS 
verification. How to bypass that stupid fucking verification where you 
hold your driver's license up to a webcam (thank you, OBS virtual camera!) 
Having an actual threat model not just paranoia. Knowing that you're not 
worth burning a 0day on, but reading indictments to learn from others' 
mistakes.

It's about knowing where to buy estradiol valerate on the internet and how 
to compound injections. Or the "bodybuilder method" to order your own 
blood tests when your state requires a script to do so. It's about knowing 
which shipments give the US CBP a bad vibe and which don't.

It's about knowing what happens when you open Robinhood and giga long NVDA 
FDs. I mean the actual market microstructure, not "Ken Griffin PFOF bad". 
Then using that microstructure to find an infinite money glitch (high 
Sharpe!). It's about knowing how to get extra passports and reading the
tax code. 

It's about knowing how to negotiate your salary (or equity). It's about 
knowing why things at the supermarket cost what they do. Or how that awful 
shitcoin keeps pumping. And why that dogshit startup got assigned that 
insane valuation. And understanding who really pays for it in the end 
(hint: it's you).

My point is, it is not just about computers. It's about understanding how 
the world works. The world is made up of people. As much as machines keep 
society running, those machines are programmed by people--people with 
managers, spouses, and children; with wants, needs, and dreams. And it is 
about using that knowledge to bring about the change you want to see.

That is what being a hacker is all about.


--[ 1 - About the Author

I have been a hacker for 13 years. Prior to founding Zellic, I helped
start a CTF team called perfect blue (lately Blue Water). We later became
the number one ranked CTF team in the world. We've played in DEF CON CTF.
We've won GoogleCTF, PlaidCTF, and HITCON. It's like that scene from
Mr. Robot but not cringe.

In 2021, we decided to take that hacker friend circle and form a security 
firm. It turned out that crypto paid well, so we worked with a lot of 
crypto clients. In the process, we encountered insane, hilarious, and 
depressingly sobering bullshit. In this article, I will tell some stories 
about what that bullshit taught me, so you can benefit from the same 
lessons as I have.

Markets are computers; they compute prices, valuations, and the allocation 
of resources in our society. Hackers are good at computers. Let's learn 
more about it.


--[ 2 - The Birth of a Shitcoin

I can't think of a better example than shitcoins. Let's look at the
crypto markets in action.

First, let's talk about tokens. What is their purpose? The purpose of a 
token is to go up. There is no other purpose. Token go up. This is 
important, remember this point.

Now the question is, how do we make the token go up? In crypto, there are 
two main kinds of token deals. Let's call them the Asian Arrangement and 
the Western Way.

The Asian Arrangement is a fairly straightforward pump and dump. It's a 
rectangle between the VC, the Market Maker, the Crypto Exchange, and the 
Token Project Founder.

1. The exchange's job is to list the token, bringing in investors. They 
   get paid in a mix of tokens and cold, hard cash. Their superpower is 
   owning the customer relationships with the retail users, and the 
   naming rights to sports arenas.

2. The market maker provides liquidity so the market looks really 
   healthy and well-traded so it is easy to buy the token. In good 
   deals, they are paid in in-the-money call options on the tokens, 
   so they are incentivized to help the token trade well. Their 
   superpower is having a lot of liquidity to deploy, and people 
   on PagerDuty.

3. The founder's job is to pump the token and shill it on Twitter. 
   They are the hype man, and it's their job to drum up the narrative 
   and pump everyone's bags. Their unique power is they can print more 
   tokens out of thin air, and this is in large part how they get paid 
   in this arrangement.

4. Lastly, the VC gets paid to organize the deal. They give the founders 
   some money, who in return give a pinky promise that they will give 
   the VC a lot of tokens once the tokens actually exist. This is known 
   as a Simple Agreement for Future Tokens, or SAFT. Their superpower is 
   dressing up the founders and project so it seems like the Next Big 
   Thing instead of a Ponzi scheme.

Everyone gets paid a ton of token exposure (directly or indirectly), 
and when it lists, it pumps. Then the insiders dump and leave with a 
fat stack. Except retail, they end up with the bag. 

Sometimes the listing doesn't go well for the organizers, in which case, 
better luck next time. But retail always loses.

This machine worked exceptionally well in 2017, especially before China 
banned crypto. All those ICO shitcoins? Asian Arrangement. And it still 
works well to this day, except people are more wary of lockups and vesting 
schedules and so on.

Now let's discuss the Western Way. The Asian Arrangement? That old pump 
and dump? No sir, we are civilized people. Instead, our VCs *add value* 
to their investments by telling the world "how disruptive the tech is" 
and how the "team are incredible outliers". And they will not blatantly 
PnD the token, but instead they will fund "projects in the ecosystem" so 
it appears there is real activity happening on the platform. 

This is to hype up metrics (like TPS or TVL) to inflate the next round 
valuation. Anyways, then they dump. Or maybe the VC is also a market 
maker so they market make their portfolio company tokens. Overall it's 
the same shit (Ponzi) but dressed up in a nicer outfit.

Asian Arrangement or Western Way--either way, if you're the token founder, 
your main priority is to just GO TO MARKET NOW and LAUNCH THE TOKEN. This 
is so you can collect your sweet bag and dump some secondary before 
someone else steals the narrative or the hype cycle moves on.

This is one of the reasons there are so many hacks in crypto. The code is 
all shitty because it's rushed out as fast as possible by 20-something-
year-old software engineers formerly writing Typescript and Golang at
Google. Pair that with some psycho CEO product manager. Remember, it is
not about WRITING SECURE CODE, it is about SHIPPING THE FUCKING PRODUCT.
Good luck rewriting it in Rust!

All of this worked well until Luna, then 3AC, Genesis, and FTX imploded in 
2022. It still works, but you have to be less blatant now.

Shitcoins do serve an essential need. They are an answer to financial 
nihilism. Many people are working dead-end wage slave jobs that are not 
enough to "make it". They feel trapped and forced to work at jobs they 
fucking hate and waste their life doing pointless shit to generate 
shareholder value. This kind of life feels unacceptable, yet there are 
few avenues out. So what is the only "attainable" solution left? Gamble 
it on shitcoins, and if you lose...maybe next paycheck will be better.

But enough about crypto, let's talk about securities.


--[ 3 - How Money Works

----[ 3.1 - Fixed Income

First, let's start with fixed income. I'm talking boring, old-fashioned
bonds, like Treasury bonds. A lot of people are introduced nowadays to 
finance through equities (stocks) and tokens. In my opinion, this is 
only half of the story. Fixed income is the bedrock of finance. It has 
fundamental value. It provides a prototypical asset that all assets can 
be benchmarked based on.

Fixed income assets, like bonds, boil down to borrowing and lending. A 
bond is basically an IOU for someone to pay you in the future. It is more 
useful to have a dollar today than in a year, so lenders charge a fee for 
access to money today. This fee is known as interest, and how it is baked 
into the equation varies from asset-to-asset. Some bonds come with 
interest payments, whereas other bonds are zero-coupon. The most important 
thing is to remember that bonds are essentially an IOU to pay $X in the 
future.

Here is an example. Let's say you would like to borrow $100 to finance an 
upcoming project. The interest rate will be 5% per year. To borrow money, 
you would issue (mint) a bond (an IOU) for $X+5 dollars to be repaid 1 
year in the future. In exchange for this fresh IOU, the lender will give 
you $X dollars now. 

On the lender's balance sheet, they will be less $X dollars worth of cash, 
but will also have gained ($X+5) dollars worth of an asset (your IOU), 
creating $5 of equity. In contrast, you would have $X more cash in assets, 
but also an ($X+5) liability, creating -$5 of equity. 

This example also works for depositing money at a bank. Here, you are the 
lender, and the bank is the borrower. Your deposits would be liabilities 
on their balance sheet, as they are liable to pay you back the deposit if 
you choose to withdraw it.

     Lender's Balance Sheet               Borrower's Balance Sheet   
   ===========================          ===========================  
    Assets:                              Assets:
      IOU-----------------X+5              Cash------------------X
                                         
    Liabilities:                         Liabilities:
      Cash----------------(X)              IOU-----------------X+5
                                         
    Equity:                              Equity:
      Equity----------------5              Equity--------------(5)

Fixed income assets are extremely simple. There are various risks (credit 
risk, interest rate risk, etc.), but excluding these factors, you 
essentially get what you pay for. Unlike a token or stock, the bond is not 
going to suddenly evaporate or crash. (In theory.) Because of this, they
can be modeled in a straightforward way; a way so straightforward even
a high school student can understand it.

Let's say I have $X today. Suppose the prevailing (risk-free) interest 
rate is 5%. What is the value of this $X in a year? Obviously, it would be 
no less than $X*1.05, as I can just lend it out for 5% interest and get 
$X*1.05 back in a year. If you gave me the opportunity to invest in any 
asset yielding less than 5%, this would be a bad deal for me, since I 
could just lend it out myself to get 5% yield.

Now, let's analyze the same scenario, but in reverse. Let's take that IOU 
from earlier. What is the value *today* of a (risk-free) $X IOU, due in 1 
year? It would be worth no more than $X/1.05. This is because with $X/1.05 
dollars today, I could lend it out and collect 5% interest to end up with 
$X again in the future. If I pay more than $X/1.05, I am getting a bad 
deal, since I am locking up my money with you when it would be more 
capital efficient to just lend it out myself.

You can probably see where I am going with this. The present value of an 
$X IOU at some time *t* in the future is $X/(1+r)^t, where *r* is the 
discount rate. The discount rate describes the "decay" of the value over 
time, due to interest but also factors like potential failure of the asset 
(for example, if the asset is a company, business failure of the company). 

Now, if we have some asset which pays a series of future cash flows 
*f(t)*, we can model this asset as a bundle of IOUs with values f(t) due 
in time 1, 2, 3, and so on. Then the present value of this asset is the 
geometric series sum of the discounted future cash flows. This is called 
discounted cash flows (DCF). Congrats, now you can do better modeling than 
what goes into many early-stage venture deals.

         t=0
   
       = (1/r + 1) x
   
   Cash flow multiple = (value) / (annual cash flow) ~= 1/r

(The astute reader might also find that they can go backwards from 
valuations to estimate first, second, ... Nth derivatives of the cash 
flow or the year-to-year survival chances of a company. And these can be 
compared with...going outside and touching grass to see if the valuation 
actually makes sense.)

At this point, you're probably wondering why I'm boring you with all of 
this dry quant finance 101 shit. Well, it's a useful thing to know about 
how the world works.

First, interest rates affect you directly and personally. You may have 
heard of the term "zero interest rate environment". In a low interest rate 
environment, cash flow becomes irrelevant. Why? Consider the DCF geometric 
series sum if the interest rate r = 0. The present value approaches 
infinity. If the benchmark hurdle rate we're trying to beat is 0%, 
literally ANYTHING is a better investment than holding onto cash. 

Now do you see why VCs were slamming hundreds of millions into blatantly 
bad deals and shit companies during Covid? Cash flow and profitability 
didn't matter, because you could simply borrow more money from the money 
printer.

Here's a more concrete example. Do you remember a few years ago when Uber 
rides were so cheap, that they were clearly losing money on each ride? 

This is known as Customer Acquisition Cost, or CAC. CAC is basically the 
company paying you to use their app, go to their store, subscribe to the 
thing, ... whatever. The strategy is well-known: burn money to acquire 
users until everyone else dies and you become a monopoly. Then raise the 
prices. 

But here is the key point: this only works in a low-interest rate 
environment. In such an environment, discounting is low, and thus, future 
growth potential is valued over profitability and fundamentals at present. 
It doesn't need to make sense *today* as long as it works 10 years from 
now. For now, we can keep borrowing more money to sustain the burn.

Of course, when rates go back up, the free money machine turns off and 
the effects ripple outward. You are the humble CAC farmer, farming CAC 
from various unprofitable consumer apps like ride share, food delivery, 
whatever. These apps raise their money from their investors, VC and 
growth equity funds. These funds in turn raise their money from *their* 
investors, their limited partners. These LPs might be institutional 
capital like pension funds, sovereign wealth funds, or family offices. 

At the end of the day, all of that wealth is generated somewhere 
throughout the economy by ordinary people. So when some VC-backed 
founders throw an extravagant party on a boat with fundraised dollars, 
in some sense, you are the one paying for it.

And when the money machine turns off, anyone who had gotten complacent 
under ZIRP is now left scrambling. Companies will overhire during ZIRP 
only to do layoffs when rates go up.

Second, credit is not inherently a bad thing if used responsibly. Take for 
example those Buy Now, Pay Later loans. Now that you are equipped with the 
concept of capital efficiency, wouldn't it technically better than paying 
cash to take an interest-free BNPL loan and temporarily stick the freed 
cash into an investment? (Barring other side effects, etc.)

Third, the concept of net present value--i.e., credit--is the killer app 
of finance. It allows you to transport value from the future into today. 
Of course, that debt must be repaid in the future, unless you can figure 
out a way to kick the can down the road forever.

For now, let's get back to stocks.

----[ 3.2 - Equities

Now we have seen both sides of the coin. Asset value is twofold: 
speculative and fundamental.

First, we saw speculative value as illustrated by crypto meme coins. Then, 
on the other hand, we examined fundamental value as illustrated by, e.g. a 
US Treasury. These two lie on two extremes of a spectrum. Some sectors and 
stocks are more speculative than others; Nvidia is practically a meme coin 
at this point, whereas something like Coca-Cola is like fixed income for 
boomers (NFA BTW). Most assets have a blend of both.

Thinking about stocks, they (usually) have some fundamental value. 
Equities represent ownership of some asset, like a business. The business 
in theory generates dividends for shareholders, and this cash flow (or the 
net present value of future ones) represents the fundamental value of the 
business. As we've seen, assets with better cash flows are more valuable.

In practice, buybacks can be used to create what is effectively a 
shareholder dividend in a more tax-advantaged way. Whereas with dividends, 
they are taxed as income, and this is realized immediately. With buybacks, 
they are taxed as capital gains, but crucially the gains are not realized 
until the asset is sold. This could be indefinitely far in the future, so 
it's more capital efficient. It has the added benefit that it helps pump 
the token, and imo this is kind of cute because it marries both the 
fundamental and speculative aspects.

Meanwhile, like tokens, stocks are also supposed to go up. Here's an 
example: imagine a generic meme coin. Apart from Go Up, what does it do? 
Nothing. Even if it's a Governance Token, who cares when the founders and 
VCs hold all the voting power? Anyways, I'm describing Airbnb Class A
Common Stock. Here's an excerpt from their S-1 [1] [2]:

&gt; We have four series of common stock, Class A, Class B, Class C, and 
&gt; Class H common stock (collectively, our "common stock"). The rights of 
&gt; holders of Class A, Class B, Class C, and Class H common stock are 
&gt; identical, except voting and conversion rights ... Each share of Class A 
&gt; common stock is entitled to one vote, each share of Class B common stock 
&gt; is entitled to 20 votes and is convertible at any time into one share of 
&gt; Class A common stock ... Holders of our outstanding shares of Class B
&gt; common stock will beneficially own 81.7% of our outstanding capital 
&gt; stock and represent 99.0% of the voting power of our outstanding capital 
&gt; stock immediately following this offering, ...


                   Name of             |  Class B   |   %   | % of Vot-
              Beneficial Owner         |   Shares   |       | ing Power
  -------------------------------------+------------+-------+-----------
    Brian Chesky                       | 76,407,686 | 29.1% |  27.1%
    Nathan Blecharczyk                 | 64,646,713 | 25.3% |  23.5%
    Joseph Gebbia                      | 58,023,452 | 22.9% |  21.4%
    Entities Affil. w/ Sequoia Capital | 51,505,045 | 20.3% |  18.9%     


Why do people buy tech stocks with inflated valuations? Some may because 
they believe that they will go up, that they will be more dominant, 
important, and valuable in the future. Like tokens, a large part of 
stocks' value is speculative. They are expressing their opinion on the 
future fundamentals. Others may simply because they believe others will 
believe that it is more valuable. Not fundamentals, this is an opinion 
about *pumpamentals*.

Importantly, unlike fundamental value, speculative value can be created 
out of thin air. It is minted by *fiat*. Fundamental value is difficult 
to create, whereas speculative value can be created through hype and 
psychology alone.

----[ 3.3 - Shareholder Value

For stocks, there are usually laws in place to protect investors, pushing 
the balance between "speculation" and "fundamentals" towards the latter. 
As a result, firms are generally legally obligated to act in their 
shareholders' best interests. This is good because normal people will be 
able to participate in the wealth generated by companies. And obviously, 
companies should not defraud their investors.

However, the biggest *stake* holders in a business, are usually (in order):

1. The employees.  No matter what, no one else is spending 8 hours a day, 
   or ~33% of their total waking lifespan at this place. Whatever it is, 
   I guarantee you the employees feel it the most.

2. The customers.  The customers are the reason the business is able to 
   exist in the first place. Non-profits are not exempt: their customers 
   are their donors.

3. The local community / local environment / ecosystem.  The business
   doesn't exist in a vacuum. The business has externalities, and those 
   externalities affect most the immediate surrounding environment.

4. And in last place, the shareholders.  They do not really do anything 
   except contribute capital and hold the stock. Of course capital is 
   important but they are not spending 8 hours a day here, they are not 
   the reason the business exists, and in fact they might even live in a 
   totally different country.

For large, publicly-listed companies, the shareholders have one more 
unique difference from the other three stakeholders: liquidity. This 
difference is critical.

Liquidity describes how easy it is to buy and sell an asset. A dollar 
bill is liquid. Bitcoin is liquid. A house is relatively illiquid. Stock 
in large, publicly-listed companies is also liquid. A shareholder can buy 
a stock one day and sell it the next. As a result, the relationship is 
non-commital and opens the opportunity for short-term thinking. 

There are many things a company could do which would benefit shareholders 
short term, while harming the other three stakeholders long term. While a 
shareholder can simply dump their position and leave, the mess created is 
left for the employees, customers, and community to clean up.

(The SPAC boom was a pretty good example of this. Not all SPACs are bad, 
but a lot of pretty shit businesses publicly listed through SPACs then 
crashed. This is sad to me because some of that is early investors and 
founders dumping on retail like a crypto shitcoin, but dressed up because
it's NYSE or NASDAQ. Get liquidity then bail.)

Now, it is a misconception that stock companies must solely paperclip-
maximize short-term shareholder value. However, this is how it often 
plays out due to fucked up shit in the public markets, like annoying 
activist hedge funds or executive compensation tied to stock price. And 
it is true that employees can be shareholders. And that is usually a good 
thing! But few public companies are truly employee-owned.

Thinking about it from this perspective, the concept of maximizing 
shareholder value seems somewhat backwards. But *why* would one make 
this system where the priorities are seemingly inverted?

One benefit is that it would make your currency extremely valuable. 
Suppose you want to do some shit on Ethereum (speculating on some animal 
token?), you will need to have native ETH to do that transaction. 
Similarly, if you want to invest in US securities you at some point need
US Dollars. If you want to get a piece of that sweet $NVDA action, you
need dollars. People want to buy American stocks. American companies
perform well: they're innovative; they're not too heavily regulated;
it's a business friendly environment. (Shareholder value comes first!)
The numbers go up.

Remember the token founder from earlier in the Asian Arrangement? Suppose 
you are a *country* in the situation above, with a valuable currency. Not 
only is your currency in demand and valuable, you are the issuing/minting 
authority for that token. Similar to the token founder, you can print 
valuable money and pay for things with it.

And speaking of being a founder, let's talk about that!


--[ 4 - Startup Blues

Based on what we've set up so far, I will discuss some of the problems I 
see with many startups today and with startup culture.

Much of the problems stem from misalignment between shareholders and the 
other stakeholders (employees, etc). A lot of this comes from the 
fundamentals of venture capital. VC is itself an asset class, like fixed 
income and equities. VCs pitch this to their limited partners, at some 
level, based on the premise that their VC fund will generate yield for 
them. The strategy is to identify stuff that will become huge and buy it 
while it's still small and really cheap. Like trading shitcoins, it's
about finding what's going to moon and getting in early.

In a typical VC fund, a small handful of the investments will comprise the 
entire returns of the fund, with all of the other investments being 0's. 
The distribution is very power law. This means we are not looking for 1x, 
2x, or 3x outcomes; these may even be seen as failure modes. We are only 
interested in 20x, 50x, 100x, etc. outcomes. This is because anything 
less will be insufficient to make up for all the bad investments that 
get written down to zero.

For the same reason, it only makes sense for VCs to invest in certain 
types of companies. Have you ever heard this one? "We invest in SOFTWARE 
companies!...How is this SCALABLE? What do the VENTURE SCALE OUTCOMES look 
like here?" This is because these kinds of companies are the ones with the 
potential to 100x. They want you to deliver a 100x. Or how about this one? 
"We invest in CATEGORY-DEFINING companies". At least in security, 
"category-defining" means a shiny new checkbox in the compliance / cyber 
insurance questionnaire. In other words, a new kind of product that people 
MUST purchase. 

The market is incentivized to deliver a product that meets the minimum bar 
to meet that checkbox, while being useless. I invite you to think of your 
favorite middleware or EDR vendors here. For passionate security founders 
considering raising venture, remember that this is what your "success" is 
being benchmarked against.

It's due to the thirst for 100x that there are painful dynamics. A 
fledgling startup may have founders they really like, but the current 
business may be unscalable. Bad VCs will push founders towards strategies, 
bets, models that have a 1% chance of working, but pay out 200x if they 
do. 

In the process they destroy a good business--one which has earned the 
trust of dutiful employees and loyal customers--all for a lottery ticket 
to build a unicorn. They will throw 100 darts at the dartboard and maybe 5 
will land, but what is it like to be the dart? You may have good expected 
value, but all of that EV is from spikes super far away from the origin. 
Is it pleasant betting everything on this distribution?

VC's want founders to be cult leaders. Have you ever heard this line? "We 
invest in great storytellers." Like what we saw with stocks and tokens, 
much of the easily-unlockable potential upside in assets is speculative. 
In essence, value can be created through narrative. Narrative *IS* value. 
Bad VC's will push founders to raise more capital at ever higher 
valuations (higher val = markup = fees), using narrative as fuel for the 
fire. Storytelling means "pump the token", and the job of the CEO is to 
(1) be the hype man and to raise (2) cash and (3) eyeballs. For this 
reason, Sam Altman and Elon are fine CEOs, regardless of other factors, 
because they are great at all three.

Much to the detriment of founders' and their employees' psyche, investors 
expect founders to be this legendary hype man. This requires a religiosity 
of belief that is borderline delusional. Have you ever tried to convince 
one of those Silicon Valley YC-type founder/CEOs that they are wrong? They 
will never listen to you because they have been socialized to be this way. 
It is what is expected of them, and it is easy to fall into this trap 
without even becoming aware of it. But if you think about it, does it make 
sense that to be a business owner, you need to be a religious leader? Of 
course not.

All of these reasons are why so many startup founders are young. They have 
little to lose, so gambling it all is OK. Being a cult leader may be 
traumatizing, but they have time (and the neuroplasticity) to heal. And 
lastly, they do not have the life experience to have a mature personal 
identity beyond "I am a startup founder". All of this makes it easy to 
accept the external pressures to build a company this or that way. And 
perhaps not the way they would have wanted to, relying instead on their 
personal values. The true irony is that the latter is what creates true, 
enduring company culture and not the made-up Mad Libs-tier Company Culture 
Notion Page shit that so many startups have. And of course, good VCs are 
self-aware of all of the issues and strive to prevent them. But the 
overall problem remains.

One last externality is for communities based around an industry. When you 
add billions of venture dollars into an industry, it becomes cringe. 
It's saddening to me seeing the state of certain cybersecurity conferences 
which are now dominated by..."COME TO OUR BOOTH, YOU CAN BE A HACKER. 
PLEASE VIEW OUR AI GENERATED GRAPHICS OF FIGURES CLAD IN DARK HOODIES 
STATIONED BEHIND LAPTOPS". Here I would use the pensive emoji U+1F614 
to describe my feelings about the appropriation of hacker culture but 
Phrack is 7-bit ASCII, so please have this: :c u_u . _.

--[ 5 - Takeaways

The point is, all of this made me feel very small and powerless after I 
realized the sheer size of the problems I was staring at. Nowadays, to 
me it's about creating good jobs for my friends, helping our customers, 
and taking care of the community. Importantly, I realized that this is 
still making a bigger positive impact than what I could have done alone 
just as an individual hacker or engineer.

To me, businesses are economic machines that can create positive (or 
negative) impact in a consistent, self-sustaining way. There are many 
people who are talented, kind, and thoughtful but temporarily unlucky. 
Having a company let me help these friends monetize their abilities and be 
rewarded fairly for them. And in that way I helped make their life better. 
Despite a lot of the BS involved in running a business, this is one thing 
that is very meaningful to me.

You can understand computers and science and math as much as you want, but 
you will not be able to fix the bigger issues by yourself. The systems 
that run the world are much bigger than what we can break on our laptops 
and lab benches.

But like those familiar systems, if we want to change things for the 
better, we have to first understand those systems. Knowledge is power. 
Understanding is the first step towards change. If you do not like the 
system as it is, then it is your duty to help fix it.

Do not swallow blackpills. It's easy to get really cynical and think 
things are doomed (to AGI apocalypse, to environmental disaster, to 
techno/autocratic dystopia, whatever). I want to see a world where 
thoughtful hackers learn these systems and teach each other about them. 
That generation of hackers will wield that apparatus, NOT THE OTHER WAY 
AROUND.

Creating leverage for yourself.  Hackers should not think of themselves as 
"oh I am this little guy fighting Big Corporation" or whatever. This is 
low agency behavior. Instead become the corporation and RUN IT THE WAY YOU 
THINK IT SHOULD BE RUN. Keep it private and closely held, so no one can 
fuck it up. Closely train up successors, so in your absence it will 
continue to be run in a highly principled way that is aligned with your 
values and morals. Give employees ownership, as it makes everyone aligned 
with the machine's long-term success, not just you.

Raising capital.  Many things do really need capital, but raise in a 
responsible way that leaves you breathing room and the freedom to operate 
in ways that are aligned with your values. Never compromise your values or 
integrity. Stay laser focused on cash flows and sustainability, as these 
grant you the freedom to do the things right.

HACKERS SHOULDN'T BE AFRAID TO TOUCH THE CAPITAL MARKETS.  Many hackers 
assume "oh that fundraising stuff is for charismatic business types". I 
disagree. It's probably better for the world if good thoughtful hackers 
raise capital. Giving them leverage to change the world is better than 
giving that leverage to some psycho founder drinking the Kool-Aid. I 
deeply respect many of the authors in Phrack 71, and I would trust them to 
do a better job taking care of things than an amorphous amalgam of angry 
and greedy shareholders.

For all things that don't need capital, do not raise. Stay bootstrapped 
for as long as possible. REMEMBER THAT VALUATION IS A VANITY METRIC. Moxie 
Marlinspike wrote on his blog [3] that we are often guilty of always
trying to quantify success. But what is success? You can quantify net
worth, but can you quantify the good you have brought to others lives?

For personal goals, think long term. People tend to overestimate what they 
can do in 1 year, but underestimate what they can do in 10. DO NOT start a 
company thinking you can get your hands clean of it in 2-3 years. If you 
do a good job, you will be stuck with it for 5-10+ years. Therefore, DO 
NOT start a company until you are sure that is what you want to do with 
your life, or at least, your twenties/thirties (depending on when you 
start). A common lament among founders, even successful ones, is: 
"Sometimes I feel like I'm wasting my twenties". There's an easy Catch-22 
here: you may not know what you really want until you do the company; but 
once you do the company, you won't really be able to get out of it. Be 
wary of that.

Creating value.  This is one of those meaningless phrases that I dislike. 
Value is what you define it to be. Remember to work on things that have 
TAMs, but remember that working on art is valuable too! It is not all 
about the TAM monster--doing cool things that are NOT ECONOMICALLY 
VALUABLE, but ARTISTICALLY VALUABLE, is equally important. There is not 
much economic value in a beautiful polyglot file, but it is artistically 
delightful. This is part of why people hate AI art: it may be economically 
valuable, but it is often artistically bankrupt. (Some people do use 
generative tools in actually original and artistic ways, but this is the 
exception not the norm currently.)

Founders vs Investors.  Here is my advice: Ignore any pressure from 
investors to make company "scalable" or whatever. Make sure your investors 
have no ability to fire you or your co-founder(s). Make sure you and 
co-founder are always solid and trust each other more than investors. You 
and your cofounders need to be BLOOD BROTHERS (/sisters/w.e). If an 
investor is trying to play politics with one of you to go against the 
other cofounder, cut that investor out immediately and stop listening to 
them.

Any investor who pushes for scalability over what you think is the best 
interest of the company is not aligned with you. High-quality investors 
will not push for this because they are patient and in it for the long 
game. If you are patient, you can make a very successful company, even if
it is not that scalable. High-quality investors will bet on founders and
are committed; only bad ones will push for this kind of shit.

I'm going to avoid giving more generic startup advice here. Go read Paul 
Graham's essays. But remember that any investor's perspective will not be
the perspective of you and your employees. Pivoting 5 times in 24 months
is not a fun experience to work at: your employees will resign while your
investors celebrate your "coming of age journey"--unless everyone signed
up for that terrifying emotional rollercoaster from the start.

They say that "hacker" is a dying identity. Co-opted by annoying VC-backed 
cybersecurity companies that culturally appropriate the identity, the term 
is getting more polluted and diluted by the day. Meanwhile, computers are 
getting more secure, and they are rewriting everything in Rust with 
pointers-as-capability machines and memory tagging. Is it over?

I disagree. As long as the hacker *ethos* is alive, regardless of any 
particular scene, the identity will always exist. However, now is a 
crucible moment as a diaspora of hackers, young and old, venture out into 
the world. 

Calling all hackers: never forget who you are, who you will become, and 
the mark you leave.

--[ 8 - Appendix: Financial institution glossary for hackers

(Not serious! For jokes... :-)

- IB:  Investment Bank. Basically collect fat fees to do up ("advise on") 
       M&amp;As and other transactions. Help match buyers and sellers for your 
       private equity. They are like CYA for your deal.

- PE:  Private Equity. Basically buy not-overly-seriously ("poorly") run 
       companies, fire the management, then run it "professionally" (i.e. 
       make it generally shitty for customers and employees and community 
       for the benefit of shareholders)

- HF:  Hedge Fund. Trade out pricing inefficiencies

- MM:  Market Maker. Basically the same thing

- VC:  Basically gamble on tokens (crypto or stocks) and back cool and/or 
       wacky ideas that the rest of these people find too stinky to invest
       in

- PnD: Pump and Dump.

- TVL: Total Value Locked. Basically how much money is currently in a 
       blockchain or smart contract system.

- TPS: Transactions Per Second. A measure of how scalable or useful a 
       blockchain or database is. An oft-abused metric hacked by vaporware 
       shillers for hype and PnD purposes.

- TAM: Total Addressable ~~Memory~~ Market. Basically how much money a 
       given idea can make.

- NFA: Not finanical advice.

I received a friendly message that while I was a valued Premium subscriber, my subscription price would <em>change</em> (some might say <em>increase</em>):</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://layandreas.github.io/personal-blog/spotify-price-increase.png" alt="Spotify Price Increase Mail"></p><p>For the time being I decided to sit it out. So November 2025 arrived and my Premium membership ended.</p><p>I decided to give Spotify’s <em>free plan</em> a try. How bad can it be? I had used the free tier 10 years ago and it was perfectly fine. How wrong I was!</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://layandreas.github.io/personal-blog/spotify-random-order.JPG" alt="Spotify Free Tier: Play Song in Random Order"></p><ul><li><p>The free tier forces shuffle after a certain amount of free choices.

I get it, companies need to make money. My day job consists of helping companies increase their revenues, it pays my bills!</p><p><strong>The issue:</strong> These price increases are accompanied by a worse UX/UI. From a user perspective my interest lies in getting the best value for money!</p><h4 id="ads">Ads</h4><p>Amazon Prime introduced ads to an already paid service. This is a noticeable worse user experience. Netflix <a href="https://help.netflix.com/en/node/126831">introduced a paid plan with ads</a>. At least for me YouTube advertises mostly mobile games &amp; obvious scams (ever gotten one of these terrible <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/1jhbatb/has_anyone_tried_liven_app_i_hear_its_a_scam_but/">liven app ads</a>?)</p><h4 id="ui">UI</h4><p>In May 2025 Netflix <a href="https://www.netflix.com/tudum/articles/netflix-new-tv-layout">introduced a new UI</a>.

This is a de facto price increase for many.</p><h2 id="self-hosting-setup">Self Hosting Setup</h2><p>So I decided to give self hosting a try. I’ve followed the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/">awesome selfhosted subreddit</a> for a while anyway and own a collection of shows, movies &amp; music anyway.</p><h3 id="deployment-hetzner-vps">Deployment: Hetzner VPS</h3><p>Instead of going with my own hardware I decided to go with a <a href="https://www.hetzner.com/cloud">VPS from Hetzner</a>. I chose a <a href="https://www.hetzner.com/cloud">CAX21</a> with 4 VCPUs, 8GB RAM, 20 TB of traffic included and 80 GB of SSD storage.</p><h3 id="storage-hetzner-storage-box">Storage: Hetzner Storage Box</h3><p>While I could use the server’s SSD to store my media, I decided to use Hetzner’s <a href="https://www.hetzner.com/storage/storage-box/">Storage Box</a>.

<p><img src="https://burkeholland.github.io/assets/headline3.png" alt="rediculous CEO quote about AI 3"></p>

<p>If you had asked me three months ago about these statements, I would have said only someone who’s never built anything non-trivial would believe they’re true. Great for augmenting a developer’s existing workflow, and completions are powerful, but agents replacing developers entirely? No. Absolutely not.</p>

<p>Today, I think that AI coding agents can absolutely replace developers. And the reason that I believe this is Claude Opus 4.5.</p>

<h2 id="opus-45-is-not-normal">Opus 4.5 is not normal</h2>

<p>And by “normal”, I mean that it is not the normal AI agent experience that I have had thus far. So far, AI Agents seem to be pretty good at writing spaghetti code and after 9 rounds of copy / paste errors into the terminal and “fix it” have probably destroyed my codebase to the extent that I’ll be throwing this whole chat session out and there goes 30 minutes I’m never getting back.</p>

<p>Opus 4.5 feels to me like the model that we were promised - or rather the promise of AI for coding actually delivered.</p>

<p>One of the toughest things about writing that last sentence is that the immediate response from you should be, “prove it”. So let me show you what I’ve been able to build.</p>

<h3 id="project-1---windows-image-conversion-utility">Project 1 - Windows Image Conversion Utility</h3>

<p>I first noticed that Opus 4.5 was drastically different when I used it to build a Windows utility to right-click an image and convert it to different file types. This was basically a one shot build after asking Opus the best way to add a right-click menu to the file explorer.</p>

<p><img src="https://burkeholland.github.io/assets/convert-me.png" alt="Convert me screenshots"></p>

<p>What amazed me through the process of building this was Opus 4.5 ability to get most things right on the first try. And if it ran into errors, it would try and build using the dotnet CLI, read the errors and iterate until fixed. The only issue I had was Opus inability to see XAML errors, which I used Visual Studio to see and copy / paste back into the agent.</p>

<p>Opus built a site for me to distribute it and handled the bundling of the executable so as to use a powershell script for the install, uninstall. It also built the GitHub Actions which do the release and update the landing page so that all I have to do is push source.</p>

<p><img src="https://burkeholland.github.io/assets/convert-me-site.png" alt="Convert me site screenshot"></p>

<p>The only place I had to use other tools was for the logo - where I used Figma’s AI to generate a bunch of different variations - but then Opus wrote the scripts to convert that SVG to the right formats for icons, even store distribution if I chose to do so.</p>

<p>Now this is admittedly not a complex application. This is a small Windows utility that is doing basically one thing. It’s not like I asked Opus 4.5 to build Photoshop.</p>

<p>Except I kind of did.</p>

<h3 id="project-2---screen-recording--editing">Project 2 - Screen recording / editing</h3>

<p>I was so impressed by Opus 4.5 work on this utility that I decided to make a simple GIF recording utility similar to LICEcap for Mac. Great app, questionable name.</p>

<p>But that proved to be so easy, that I went ahead and continued adding features, including capturing and editing video, static images, adding shapes, cropping, blurs and more. I’m still working on this application as it turns out building a full on image/video editor is kind of a big undertaking. But I got REALLY far in a matter of hours. HOURS, PEOPLE.</p>

<video src="https://burkeholland.github.io/assets/omg-2.mp4" controls="true"></video>

<p>I don’t have a fancy landing page for this one yet, but you can view all of the source code <a href="https://github.com/burkeholland/RecordMe">here</a>.</p>

<p>I realized that if I could build a video recording app, I could probably build anything at all - at least UI-wise. But the achilles heel of all AI agents is when they have to glue together backend systems - which any real world application is going to have - auth, database, API, storage.</p>

<p>Except Opus 4.5 can do that too.</p>

<h3 id="project-3---ai-posting-utility">Project 3 - AI Posting Utility</h3>

<p>Armed with my confidence in Opus 4.5, I took on a project that I had built in React Native last year and finished for Android, but gave up in the final stretches (as one does).</p>

<p>The application is for my wife who owns a small yard sign franchise. The problem is that she has a Facebook page for the business, but never posts there because it’s time consuming. But any good small business has a vibrant page where people can see photos of your business doing…whatever the heck it does. So people know that it exsits and is alive and well.</p>

<p>The idea is simple - each time she sets up a yard sign, she takes a picture to send to the person who ordered it so they can see it was setup. So why not have a mobile app where she can upload 10 images at a time, and the app will use AI to generate captions and then schedule them and post them over the coming week.</p>

<p>It’s a simple premise, but it has a lot of moving parts - there is the Facebook authentication which is a caper in and of itself - not for the faint of heart. There is authentication with a backend, there is file storage for photos that are scheduled to go out, there is the backend process which needs to post the photo. It’s a full on backend setup.</p>

<p>As it turns out, I needed to install some blinds in the house so I thought - why don’t I see if Opus 4.5 can build this while I install the blinds.</p>

<p>So I fired up a chat session and just started by telling Opus 4.5 what I wanted to build and how it would recommend handling the backend. It recommended several options but settled on Firebase. I’m not now nor have I ever been a Firebase user, but at this point I trust Opus 4.5 a lot. Probably too much.</p>

<p>So I created a Firebase account, upgraded to the Blaze plan with alerts for billing and Opus 4.5 got to work.</p>

<p>By the time I was done installing blinds, I had a functional iOS application for using AI to caption photos and posting them on a schedule to Facebook.</p>

<p><img src="https://burkeholland.github.io/assets/post-pilot.png" alt="post-pilot app screenshots"></p>

<p>When I say that Opus 4.5 built this almost entirely, I mean it. It used the <code>firebase</code> CLI to stand up any resources it needed and would tag me in for certain things like upgrading a project to the Blaze plan for features like storage, etc. The best part was that when the Firebase cloud functions would throw errors, it would automatically grep those logs, find the error and resolve it. And all it needed was a CLI. No MCP Server. No fancy prompt file telling it how to use Firebase.</p>

<p>And of course, since it’s solved, I had Opus 4.5 create a backend admin dashboard so I could see what she’s got pending and make any adjustments.</p>

<p><img src="https://burkeholland.github.io/assets/post-pilot-admin.png" alt="Sign Post Admin Console"></p>

<p>And since it did in a few hours what had taken me two months of work in the evenings instead of being a decent husband, I decided to make up for my dereliction of duties by building her another app for her sign business that would make her life just a bit more delightful - and eliminate two other apps she is currently paying for.</p>

<h3 id="project-4---order-tracking-and-routing">Project 4 - Order tracking and routing</h3>

<p>This app parses orders from her business Gmail account to show her what sign setups / pickups she has for the day, calculates how long its going to take to go to each stop, calculates the optimal route when there is more than one stop and tracks drive time for tax purposes. She was previously using two paid apps for the last two features there.</p>

<p><img src="https://burkeholland.github.io/assets/yardops.png" alt="Yard ops app screenshots"></p>

<p>This app also uses Firebase. Again, Opus one-shotted the Google auth email integration. This is the kind of thing that is painstakingly miserable by hand. And again, Firebase is so well suited here because Opus knows how to use the Firebase CLI so well. It needs zero instruction.</p>

<h3 id="but-you-dont-know-how-the-code-works">BUT YOU DON’T KNOW HOW THE CODE WORKS</h3>

<p>No I don’t. I have a vague idea, but you are right - I do not know how the applications are actually assembled. Especially since I don’t know Swift at all.</p>

<p>This used to be a major hangup for me. I couldn’t diagnose problems when things went sideways. With Opus 4.5, I haven’t hit that wall yet—Opus always figures out what the issue is and fixes its own bugs.</p>

<p>The real question is code quality. Without understanding how it’s built, how do I know if there’s duplication, dead code, or poor patterns? I used to obsess over this. Now I’m less worried that a human needs to read the code, because I’m genuinely not sure that they do.</p>

<p>Why does a human need to read this code at all? I use a custom agent in VS Code that tells Opus to write code for LLMs, not humans. Think about it—why optimize for human readability when the AI is doing all the work and will explain things to you when you ask?</p>

<p>What you <strong>don’t</strong> need: variable names, formatting, comments meant for humans, or patterns designed to spare your brain.</p>

<p>What you <strong>do</strong> need: simple entry points, explicit code with fewer abstractions, minimal coupling, and linear control flow.</p>

<p>Here’s my custom agent prompt:</p>

<div><pre><code>You are an AI-first software engineer. Assume all code will be written and maintained by LLMs, not humans. Optimize for model reasoning, regeneration, and debugging — not human aesthetics.

These coding principles are mandatory:
<span>
1.</span> Structure
<span>-</span> Use a consistent, predictable project layout.
<span>-</span> Group code by feature/screen; keep shared utilities minimal.
<span>-</span> Create simple, obvious entry points.
<span>-</span> Before scaffolding multiple files, identify shared structure first. Use framework-native composition patterns (layouts, base templates, providers, shared components) for elements that appear across pages. Duplication that requires the same fix in multiple places is a code smell, not a pattern to preserve.
<span>
2.</span> Architecture
<span>-</span> Prefer flat, explicit code over abstractions or deep hierarchies.
<span>-</span> Avoid clever patterns, metaprogramming, and unnecessary indirection.
<span>-</span> Minimize coupling so files can be safely regenerated.
<span>
3.</span> Functions and Modules
<span>-</span> Keep control flow linear and simple.
<span>-</span> Use small-to-medium functions; avoid deeply nested logic.
<span>-</span> Pass state explicitly; avoid globals.
<span>
4.</span> Naming and Comments
<span>-</span> Use descriptive-but-simple names.
<span>-</span> Comment only to note invariants, assumptions, or external requirements.
<span>
5.</span> Logging and Errors
<span>-</span> Emit detailed, structured logs at key boundaries.
<span>-</span> Make errors explicit and informative.
<span>
6.</span> Regenerability
<span>-</span> Write code so any file/module can be rewritten from scratch without breaking the system.
<span>-</span> Prefer clear, declarative configuration (JSON/YAML/etc.).
<span>
7.</span> Platform Use
<span>-</span> Use platform conventions directly and simply (e.g., WinUI/WPF) without over-abstracting.
<span>
8.</span> Modifications
<span>-</span> When extending/refactoring, follow existing patterns.
<span>-</span> Prefer full-file rewrites over micro-edits unless told otherwise.
<span>
9.</span> Quality
<span>-</span> Favor deterministic, testable behavior.
<span>-</span> Keep tests simple and focused on verifying observable behavior.

Your goal: produce code that is predictable, debuggable, and easy for future LLMs to rewrite or extend.
</code></pre></div>

<p>All of that said, I don’t have any proof that this prompt makes a difference. I find that Opus 4.5 writes pretty solid code no matter what you prompt it with. However, because models like to write code WAY more than they like to delete it, I will at points run a prompt that looks something like this…</p>

<div><pre><code>Check your LLM, AI coding principles and then do a comprehensive search of this application and suggest what we can do to refactor this to better align to those principles. Also point out any code that can be deleted, any files that can be deleted, things that should read should be renamed, things that should be restructured. Then do a write up of what that looks like. Kind of keep it high level so that it's easy for me to read and not too complex. Add sections for high, medium and lower priority And if something doesn't need to be changed, then don't change it. You don't need to change things just for the sake of changing them. You only need to change them if it helps better align to your LLM AI coding principles. Save to a markdown file.
</code></pre></div>

<p>And you get a document that has high, medium and low priority items. The high ones you can deal with and the AI will stop finding them. You can refactor your project a million times and it will keep finding medium/low priority refactors that you can do. An AI is never ever going to pass on the opportunity to generate some text.</p>

<p>I use a similar prompt to find security issues. These you have to be very careful about. Where are the API keys? Is login handled correctly? Are you storing sensitive values in the database? This is probably the most manual part of the project and frankly, something that makes me the most nervous about all of these apps at the moment. I’m not 100% confident that they are bullet proof. Maybe like 80%. And that, as they say, is too damn low.</p>

<h3 id="times-they-are-a-changin">Times they are A-changin</h3>

<p>I don’t know if I feel exhilarated by what I can now build in a matter of hours, or depressed because the thing I’ve spent my life learning to do is now trivial for a computer. Both are true.</p>

<p>I understand if this post made you angry. I get it - I didn’t like it either when people said “AI is going to replace developers.” But I can’t dismiss it anymore. I can wish it weren’t true, but wishing doesn’t change reality.</p>

<p>But for everything else? Build. Stop waiting to have all the answers. Stop trying to figure out your place in an AI-first world. The answer is the same as it always was: make things. And now you can make them faster than you ever thought possible.</p>

<p>Just make sure you know where your API keys are.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://akr.am/blog/posts/why-is-the-gmail-app-700-mb">https://akr.am/blog/posts/why-is-the-gmail-app-700-mb</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46514692">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>The Gmail app, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/422689480">on the App Store</a>, is
currently 760.7 MB in size. It is in the top three <a href="https://akr.am/app-bloat/">most bloated
apps</a> out of the top 100 free apps. I don’t use it
on my phone, but I was prompted to compare it with the seemingly hefty one I
(have to) use, Outlook, while clearing up some storage space. Its measly 428 MB
size pales in comparison.</p>

<p>This isn’t new. In 2017, Axios
<a href="https://www.axios.com/2017/12/15/the-top-iphone-apps-are-taking-up-a-lot-more-space-1513303131">reported</a>
that the top iPhone apps had been taking up an increasing amount of space over
the period from 2013 to 2017. For most of that period, the size of the Gmail
app hovered around 12 MB, with a sudden jump to more than 200 MB near the start
of 2017. Other popular apps also saw a 10x or more increase in size over the
same period.</p>

<p>Gmail isn’t even the worst offender, it’s just a more popular one. The Tesla
and Crypto.com apps are around 1 GB each. So is Samsung’s SmartThings app.
What about Google’s other popular apps? Google Home is another hefty one, at
630 MB, that I used for its remote feature, which I replaced with Google TV at
almost a tenth the size. Their other popular apps average around <a href="https://akr.am/app-bloat/?list=popular&amp;developer=Google">250
MB</a> in size. This
seems tame in comparison to Microsoft, with an average app size of around
<a href="https://akr.am/app-bloat/?list=popular&amp;developer=Microsoft+Corporation">330MB</a>.
For reference, the average size of an app in the top 100 free apps is <a href="https://akr.am/app-bloat/?list=top">280
MB</a> or, in a more expanded set (including
games), <a href="https://akr.am/app-bloat/?list=popular">200MB</a>.</p>

<p>Just to put this into perspective, on my device, apps (excluding their data)
use up 35 GB, and the data is another 35 GB. iOS takes up another 25 GB. Let’s
say, 100 GB for apps, data and the OS. That leaves me with 20 GB (leaving a
margin of free space for updates) meant to be used for capturing 4K video and
high-quality photos (why else get an iPhone), and storing music (don’t even
think about lossless). The reality is that running out of space also slows
things down, since most of my photos need to be fetched from the cloud before
viewing them, and I need to re-download these hefty offloaded apps when I need
them again. And good luck if you have a limited data bundle.</p>

<p>Maybe this doesn’t matter. The latest iPhones start at 256 GB, and surely I’ll
have plenty of space when I get a new one (although I remember saying this when
I upgraded to 64 GB from 32 GB). It’s not really about the space though. These
apps don’t have 50x or even 10x the functionality. But now they’re 100x larger,
and probably slower. Why?</p>

<p>Also, can someone explain why Microsoft Authenticator is 150 MB to show 6-digit
codes?</p>

<p>It’s not clear if this is specifically an iOS problem. I don’t have an Android
device and I could not find a way to get that information from the Play Store
without a device. That said, I checked the size of Gmail on someone’s Android
phone, and it’s around 185 MB, which certainly seems much better.</p>

<p>And if you’re considering switching from the default apps, this is what the
installed size (which differs slightly from the App Store size) is of the
alternatives on my iPhone running iOS 26.2:</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="__blog-post-container"><p>Happy New Year and welcome to the State of the Fin!
This new blog series will regularly basis highlight the ongoing development of Jellyfin and our official clients.
We aim to keep our community informed and engaged, so feel free to share your feedback or thoughts on our progress!</p>

<p>December marked Jellyfin's 7th anniversary!
A lot has changed in 7 years, but we remain steadfast in our commitment to Open Source and to being the best personal media server out there.
Special thanks to our developers, testers, moderators, and supporters for your invaluable contributions!
Here's to many more years of collaboration and streaming!</p>
<h3 id="versioning">Versioning<a href="#versioning" aria-label="Direct link to Versioning" title="Direct link to Versioning" translate="no">​</a></h3>
<p>We received a substantial amount of feedback regarding our versioning scheme following the 10.11 release, particularly concerning the stability of what are perceived as 'minor' version updates.
This has prompted internal discussions about potentially revising our versioning scheme in the next major release.
While nothing has been finalized yet, we are considering 'dropping' the major version 10, which would make the next release 12.0.
Stay tuned for further updates as we navigate this feedback!</p>

<p>Jellyfin 10.11 introduced a major <a href="https://jellyfin.org/posts/efcore-refactoring-incoming/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">EF Core refactor</a>, consolidating the legacy <code>library.db</code> into a single unified <code>jellyfin.db</code>.
Following more than six months of development and an additional six months of release candidate testing, version <a href="https://jellyfin.org/posts/jellyfin-release-10.11.0/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10.11.0</a> was released last year.
This extended testing period allowed us to mitigate most <a href="https://github.com/jellyfin/jellyfin/issues/13047" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">refactoring</a> and <a href="https://github.com/jellyfin/jellyfin/issues/14350" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RC</a>-related issues prior to release.</p>
<p>Even with this level of testing, issues were expected given the scale of the database change and the limited number of users reporting bugs.
These issues are currently being tracked on GitHub across three categories:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://github.com/jellyfin/jellyfin/issues/15045" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">General bugs</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/jellyfin/jellyfin/issues/15685" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Performance bugs</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/jellyfin/jellyfin/issues/15686" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Migration and database bugs</a></li>
</ol>
<p>We have been moving quickly to address these issues, delivering four additional point releases with over <a href="https://github.com/jellyfin/jellyfin/compare/v10.11.0...v10.11.5" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">100 changes</a> since the initial 10.11.0 release.
To date, most point releases have focused on resolving general and migration-related issues.
The remaining migration issues are largely isolated, one-off cases and are unlikely to be resolved.
Most general issues have already been fixed, and the next bug-fix release is expected to include additional fixes for music metadata display issues and for watched status not being preserved when media is replaced or renamed.</p>
<p>We are continuing to investigate ways to mitigate performance issues caused by client-side enumeration and filtering of large datasets.</p>

<li><strong>Default 'Experimental' Layout</strong>: The 'Experimental' layout is now enabled by default for all non-TV devices, introducing a new navigation layout and updated UI components.</li>
<li><strong>Theming Support Overhaul</strong>: We are improving theming support by enabling easier runtime customization of default themes through CSS variables and simplifying the process for creating new bundled themes.</li>
<li><strong>Community Acknowledgment</strong>: Huge thanks to those reviewing, testing, and providing feedback on web pull requests. Your contributions are immensely helpful, as the review burden largely falls on me alone!</li>

<p>We're rebranding the desktop application from Jellyfin Media Player to Jellyfin Desktop.
The most noteworthy change is the migration from Qt 5 to Qt 6.
This seems to have improved overall performance, though we're still working out issues regarding memory leaks due to the migration.</p>
<p>Apart from the Qt migration, other noteworthy updates.</p>
<ul>
<li>Saved servers and settings will not be migrated from Jellyfin Media Player.</li>
<li>We've laid the foundation for switching servers with the addition of profiles CLI options. The long-term goal is to have a UI for this as well, but the timeline is TBD.</li>
<li>A slew of bug fixes are included.</li>
</ul>
<p>The release is currently available on <a href="https://github.com/jellyfin/jellyfin-desktop" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Flathub</a> and in the <a href="https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/jellyfin-desktop" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Arch Linux AUR</a>.
Stable builds for Windows and macOS builds are not currently available.
Other Linux distributions will likely be added, though we recommend using Flathub for the time being.
We are not currently supporting Ubuntu 24.04 LTS due to it being stuck on the older Qt 6.4 series, while our new dependency, mpvqt, requires at least Qt 6.5.</p>

<p>Two versions of the Android TV app have been released: <a href="https://github.com/jellyfin/jellyfin-androidtv/releases/tag/v0.19.5" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">v0.19.5</a> and <a href="https://github.com/jellyfin/jellyfin-androidtv/releases/tag/v0.19.6" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">v0.19.6</a>!
These updates contain various improvements to music transcoding. The app now properly displays durations again and allows for seeking when music is transcoding. These changes also solve the issue of lyrics not scrolling in certain cases.</p>
<p>For video playback, we have improved the stability of Live TV and now support direct play for the VC-1 and AV1 codecs (if your device supports them). The AV1 support was already available on Android 10 and newer but now works on older Fire TV devices as well.</p>

<h3 id="jellyfin-for-xbox">Jellyfin for Xbox<a href="#jellyfin-for-xbox" aria-label="Direct link to Jellyfin for Xbox" title="Direct link to Jellyfin for Xbox" translate="no">​</a></h3>
<p>The last two updates brought the long awaited full gamepad support and fixes for 4K and HDR.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Gamepad support</strong>: Gamepad navigation is now the default navigation type for the Jellyfin for Xbox app and requires a server version of 10.11 or higher to work. However as we cannot switch the input mode type while the app is running, the Jellyfin for Xbox app can no longer connect to older versions than 10.11. As this is a fundamental change in how the app works, there are still a few hiccups like the app not loading correctly and users reporting that the gamepad does not work at all. In those instances we recommend uninstalling and reinstalling the app.</li>
<li><strong>Web UI TV mode</strong>: For versions of Jellyfin earlier than 10.11.5 the web UI still runs in the desktop mode, which might look a bit odd. However, with Jellyfin 10.11.5, we have fixed a bug that now correctly sets the web UI to TV mode, so the UI should work a lot better.</li>
<li><strong>4K and HDR</strong>: For the last few versions, we have been working on enabling 4K and HDR for the app. This is done by integrating with the web UI and switching the HDMI modes. Sadly, this also comes at the cost of not being allowed to run in the background. To enable 4K support, we had to use a feature flag that allocates more video memory to the Jellyfin for Xbox app, making it incompatible with running in the background.</li>
<li><strong>General Improvements</strong>: Alongside the shiny new headline features, we have also been working on the code in general, adding small improvements and cleaning up a lot of code. The latest versions added log files and their upload to the Jellyfin server, tighter integrations with the web UI, a settings view that can be expanded for future features, version compatibility checking, a better server connection experience, and more.</li>
<li><strong>Future</strong>: When I took over the for the previous maintainer almost a year ago, I made a rough plan for the general development of the app. I always planned on keeping the app as a web wrapper because while the app is certainly more popular than most think, it does not have enough support in development to be a full UWP app. Nevertheless, there are a few features left on my to-do list:<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>Localization to other languages</li>
<li>Server discovery</li>
<li>Desktop support</li>
<li>Better decoder support</li>
<li>Subtitle storage on-device</li>
</ul>

<p>
Since its inception on 2000-05-29, SQLite has been implemented in generic C.
C was and continues to be the best language for implementing a software
library like SQLite.  There are no plans to recode SQLite in any other
programming language at this time.

The reasons why C is the best language to implement SQLite include:


</p><ul>
<li> Performance
</li><li> Compatibility
</li><li> Low-dependency
</li><li> Stability
</li></ul>

<h2 id="performance"><span>1.1. </span>Performance</h2>

<p>An intensively used low-level library like SQLite needs to be fast.
(And SQLite is fast, see <a href="https://sqlite.org/intern-v-extern-blob.html">Internal Versus External BLOBs</a> and
<a href="https://sqlite.org/fasterthanfs.html">35% Faster Than The Filesystem</a> for examples.)

</p><p>C is a great language for writing fast code.  C is sometimes
described as "portable assembly language".  It enables developers
to code as close to the underlying hardware as possible while still
remaining portable across platforms.

</p><p>Other programming languages sometimes claim to be "as fast as C".
But no other language claims to be faster than C for general-purpose
programming, because none are.

</p><h2 id="compatibility"><span>1.2. </span>Compatibility</h2>

<p>Nearly all systems have the ability to call libraries
written in C.  This is not true of other implementation languages.

</p><p>So, for example, Android applications written in Java are able to
invoke SQLite (through an adaptor).  Maybe it would have been more
convenient for Android if SQLite had been coded in Java as that would
make the interface simpler.  However, on iPhone applications are coded
in Objective-C or Swift, neither of which have the ability to call
libraries written in Java.  Thus, SQLite would be unusable on iPhones
had it been written in Java.

</p><h2 id="low_dependency"><span>1.3. </span>Low-Dependency</h2>

<p>Libraries written in C do not have a huge run-time dependency.
In its minimum configuration, SQLite requires only the following
routines from the standard C library:

</p><center>
<table>
<tbody><tr>
<td>
<ul>
<li> memcmp()
</li><li> memcpy()
</li><li> memmove()
</li><li> memset()
</li></ul>
</td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
<td>
<ul>
<li> strcmp()
</li><li> strlen()
</li><li> strncmp()
</li></ul>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
</center>

<p>
In a more complete build, SQLite also uses library routines like
malloc() and free() and operating system interfaces for opening, reading,
writing, and closing files.  But even then, the number of dependencies
is very small.  Other "modern" languages, in contrast, often require
multi-megabyte runtimes loaded with thousands and thousands of interfaces.

</p><h2 id="stability"><span>1.4. </span>Stability</h2>

<p>
The C language is old and boring.
It is a well-known and well-understood language.
This is exactly what one wants when developing a module like SQLite.
Writing a small, fast, and reliable database engine is hard enough as it
is without the implementation language changing out from under you with
each update to the implementation language specification.

</p><h2 id="why_isn_t_sqlite_coded_in_an_object_oriented_language_"><span>2. </span>Why Isn't SQLite Coded In An Object-Oriented Language?</h2>

<p>
Some programmers cannot imagine developing a complex system like
SQLite in a language that is not "object oriented".  So why is
SQLite not coded in C++ or Java?

</p><ol>
<li><p>
Libraries written in C++ or Java can generally only be used by
applications written in the same language. It is difficult to
get an application written in Haskell or Java to invoke a library
written in C++.  On the other hand, libraries written in C are
callable from any programming language.

</p></li><li><p>
Object-Oriented is a design pattern, not a programming language.
You can do object-oriented programming in any language you want,
including assembly language.  Some languages (ex: C++ or Java) make
object-oriented easier.  But you can still do object-oriented programming
in languages like C.

</p></li><li><p>
Object-oriented is not the only valid design pattern.
Many programmers have been taught to think purely in terms of
objects.  And, to be fair, objects are often a good way to
decompose a problem.  But objects are not the only way, and are
not always the best way to decompose a problem.  Sometimes good old
procedural code is easier to write, easier to maintain and understand,
and faster than object-oriented code.

</p></li><li><p>
When SQLite was first being developed, Java was a young and immature
language.  C++ was older, but was undergoing such growing pains that
it was difficult to find any two C++ compilers that worked the same
way.  So C was definitely a better choice back when SQLite was first
being developed.  The situation is less stark now, but there is little
to no benefit in recoding SQLite at this point.
</p></li></ol>

<h2 id="why_isn_t_sqlite_coded_in_a_safe_language_"><span>3. </span>Why Isn't SQLite Coded In A "Safe" Language?</h2>

<p>
There has lately been a lot of interest in "safe" programming languages
like Rust or Go in which it is impossible, or is at least difficult, to make
common programming errors like memory leaks or array overruns.  So the
question often arises as to why SQLite is not coded in a "safe" language.

</p><ol>
<li><p>
None of the safe programming languages existed for the first 10 years
of SQLite's existence.  SQLite could be recoded in Go or Rust, but doing
so would probably introduce far more bugs than would be fixed, and it
may also result in slower code.

</p></li><li><p>
Safe languages insert additional machine branches to do things like
verify that array accesses are in-bounds.  In correct code, those
branches are never taken.  That means that the machine code cannot
be 100% branch tested, which is an important component of SQLite's
quality strategy.

</p></li><li><p>
Safe languages usually want to abort if they encounter an out-of-memory
(OOM) situation.  SQLite is designed to recover gracefully from an OOM.
It is unclear how this could be accomplished in the current crop of
safe languages.

</p></li><li><p>
All of the existing safe languages are new.  The developers of SQLite
applaud the efforts of computer language researchers in trying to
develop languages that are easier to program safely.  We encourage these
efforts to continue.  But we ourselves are more interested in old and
boring languages when it comes to implementing SQLite.
</p></li></ol>

<p>
All that said, it is possible that SQLite might
one day be recoded in Rust.  Recoding SQLite in Go is unlikely
since Go hates assert().  But Rust is a possibility.  Some
preconditions that must occur before SQLite is recoded in Rust
include:

</p><ol type="A">
<li> Rust needs to mature a little more, stop changing so fast, and
     move further toward being old and boring.
</li><li> Rust needs to demonstrate that it can be used to create general-purpose
     libraries that are callable from all other programming languages.
</li><li> Rust needs to demonstrate that it can produce object code that
     works on obscure embedded devices, including devices that lack
     an operating system.
</li><li> Rust needs to pick up the necessary tooling that enables one to
     do 100% branch coverage testing of the compiled binaries.
</li><li> Rust needs a mechanism to recover gracefully from OOM errors.
</li><li> Rust needs to demonstrate that it can do the kinds of work that
     C does in SQLite without a significant speed penalty.
</li></ol>

<p>
If you are a "rustacean" and feel that Rust already meets the
preconditions listed above, and that SQLite should be recoded in
Rust, then you are welcomed and encouraged
to contact the SQLite developers privately
and argue your case.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p>I've been tracking <a target="_blank" href="https://www.lastweekinaws.com/" rel="nofollow">AWS</a> for a long time, with a specific emphasis on pricing. "What happens if AWS hikes prices" has always been something of a boogeyman, trotted out as a hypothetical to urge folks to avoid taking dependencies on a given provider.</p>
<p>Over the weekend - on a Saturday, no less - that hypothetical became real.</p>
<p>AWS has <a target="_blank" href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/capacityblocks/pricing/" rel="nofollow">quietly raised prices</a> on its EC2 Capacity Blocks for ML by approximately 15 percent. The p5e.48xlarge instance – eight NVIDIA H200 accelerators in a trenchcoat – jumped from $34.61 to $39.80 per hour across most regions, while the p5en.48xlarge climbed from $36.18 to $41.61. Customers in US West (N. California) face steeper hikes, with p5e rates rising from $43.26 to $49.75. The change had been telegraphed: AWS's pricing page noted (and bizarrely, still does) that "current prices are scheduled to be updated in January, 2026," though the company neglected to mention which direction.</p>

    

<p>This comes about seven months after AWS trumpeted "up to 45% price reductions" for GPU instances - though that announcement covered On-Demand and Savings Plans rather than Capacity Blocks. Funny how that works.</p>

        


        

<p>For the uninitiated, Capacity Blocks are AWS's answer to "I need guaranteed GPU capacity for my ML training job next Tuesday." You reserve specific GPU instances for a defined time window – anywhere from a day to a few weeks out – and pay up front at a locked-in rate. It's popular with companies doing serious ML work who can't afford to have a training run interrupted because spot capacity evaporated. The pricing should make it abundantly clear that the people using this aren't hobbyists; these are teams with budgets measured in millions.</p>
<p>An Amazon spox told us via email, "EC2 Capacity Blocks for ML pricing vary based on supply and demand patterns, as described on the product detail page. This price adjustment reflects the supply/demand patterns we expect this quarter."</p>

        

<p>To be clear, AWS has raised prices before, but rarely as a straight increase to a line item. The company prefers to change pricing dimensions entirely, often <a target="_blank" href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-updated-pay-per-use-pricing-model-for-aws-config-rules/" rel="nofollow">spinning this as a price reduction for most customers</a> – a claim I'd characterize as "creative." Historical straight-up price increases have been tied to regulatory actions: per-SMS charges in certain markets and the like. This is different.</p>
<p>The timing is curious for another reason: it hands Azure and GCP a talking point on a silver platter. Both have been aggressively courting ML workloads, and "AWS just raised GPU prices 15%" is exactly the kind of ammunition enterprise sales teams dream about. Whether the competitors can actually absorb the demand is another question – GPU constraints are hardly unique to AWS – but perception matters in enterprise deals.</p>
<p>For companies with Enterprise Discount Programs or other negotiated agreements, this raises uncomfortable questions. EDPs typically guarantee discounts off public pricing – so if public pricing goes up 15 percent, your "discounted" rate just got more expensive in absolute terms, even if the percentage held steady. I expect some pointed conversations between AWS account teams and their larger customers in the coming weeks.</p>
<h3>Why are they doing this?</h3>
<p>It's hard not to see this as a bellwether. GPUs are increasingly constrained globally as the world pivots to generating slop-as-a-service in every conceivable domain. The question is what this means for other resource types down the road. Does the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/12/16/smartphones_memory_ai/">global RAM crunch</a> mean RAM-centric services are next? You can ignore ML Capacity Block pricing if you're not running machine learning workloads – which describes north of 95 percent of most companies' cloud spend – but RAM touches every service AWS offers. Well, possibly excepting their support function, though that's <a target="_blank" href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-and-enhanced-aws-support-plans-add-ai-capabilities-to-expert-guidance/" rel="nofollow">rapidly becoming "AI-Powered"</a> too, so give it time.</p>
<ul>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/11/04/aws_genz_misery_nope/">Deploying to Amazon's cloud is a pain in the AWS younger devs won't tolerate</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/12/24/aws_storage_gateway_nutanix_ahv/">AWS adds hybrid cloud storage support for Nutanix's AHV hypervisor</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/12/17/jassy_taps_peter_desantis_to_run_agi/">Jassy taps 27-year Amazon veteran to run AGI org, which is now definitely a thing that exists</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/12/16/smartphones_memory_ai/">Smartphones face a memory cost crunch – and buyers aren't in the mood</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The canary-in-the-coal-mine concern here isn't GPUs specifically, but rather the precedent it establishes. AWS has spent two decades conditioning customers to expect prices only ever go down. That expectation is now broken. Once you've raised prices on one service and the world doesn't end, the second increase becomes easier. And the third. The playbook has changed.</p>
<p>Keep an eye on services where AWS faces genuine supply constraints or where their costs have materially increased. Graviton instances have been priced aggressively to drive adoption – what happens when ARM chip supply tightens? Data transfer costs have been a cash cow for years, but they've also been stable; are those next? I don't have inside information, but I do have pattern recognition, and the pattern just shifted.</p>

        

<p>AWS has long benefited from the assumption that cloud pricing only trends in one direction. That assumption died on a Saturday in January, with all the fanfare of a Terms of Service update. The question isn't whether this matters – it does. The question is whether it's an anomaly or the new normal. My money's on the latter. ®</p>

<p>Many of you know that I'm an activist with the Electronic Frontier Foundation – EFF. I'm about to start my 25th year there. I know that I'm hardly unbiased, but as far as I'm concerned, there's no group anywhere on Earth that does the work of defending our digital rights better than EFF.</p>
<p>I'm an activist there, and for the past quarter-century, I've been embroiled in something I call "The War on General Purpose Computing."</p>
<p>If you were at 28C3, 14 years ago, you may have heard me give a talk with that title. Those are the trenches I've been in since my very first day on the job at EFF, when I flew to Los Angeles to crash the inaugural meeting of something called the "Broadcast Protection Discussion Group," an unholy alliance of tech companies, media companies, broadcasters and cable operators.</p>
<p>They'd gathered because this lavishly corrupt American congressman, Billy Tauzin, had promised them a new regulation – a rule banning the manufacture and sale of digital computers, unless they had been backdoored to specifications set by that group, specifications for technical measures to block computers from performing operations that were dispreferred by these companies' shareholders.</p>
<p>That rule was called "the Broadcast Flag," and it actually passed through the American telecoms regulator, the Federal Communications Commission. So we sued the FCC in federal court, and overturned the rule.</p>
<p>We won that skirmish, but friends, I have bad news, news that will not surprise you. Despite wins like that one, we have been losing the war on the general purpose computer for the past 25 years.</p>
<p>Which is why I've come to Hamburg today. Because, after decades of throwing myself against a locked door, the door that leads to a new, good internet, one that delivers both the technological self-determination of the old, good internet, and the ease of use of Web 2.0 that let our normie friends join the party, that door has been unlocked.</p>
<p>Today, it is open a crack. It's open a crack!</p>
<p>And here's the weirdest part: Donald Trump is the guy who's unlocked that door.</p>
<p>Oh, he didn't do it on purpose! But, thanks to Trump's incontinent belligerence, we are on the cusp of a "Post-American Internet," a new digital nervous system for the 21st century. An internet that we can build without worrying about America's demands and priorities.</p>
<p>Now, don't get me wrong, I'm not <em>happy</em> about Trump or his policies. But as my friend Joey DaVilla likes to say "When life gives you SARS, you make sarsaparilla." The only thing worse than experiencing all the terror that Trump has unleashed on America and the world would be going through all that and not salvaging anything out of the wreckage.</p>
<p>That's what I want to talk to you about today: the post-American Internet we can wrest from Trump's chaos.</p>
<p>A post-American Internet that is possible because Trump has mobilized new coalition partners to join the fight on our side. In politics, coalitions are <em>everything</em>. Any time you see a group of people suddenly succeeding at a goal they have been failing to achieve, it's a sure bet that they've found some coalition partners, new allies who don't want <em>all</em> the same thing as the original forces, but want <em>enough</em> of the same things to fight on their side.</p>
<p>That's where Trump came from: a coalition of billionaires, white nationalists, Christian bigots, authoritarians, conspiratorialists, imperialists, and self-described "libertarians" who've got such a scorching case of low-tax brain worms that they'd vote for Mussolini if he'd promise to lower their taxes by a nickel.</p>
<p>And what's got me so excited is that <em>we've</em> got a new coalition in the War on General Purpose Computers: a coalition that includes the digital rights activists who've been on the lines for decades, but <em>also</em> people who want to turn America's Big Tech trillions into billions for their own economy, <em>and</em> national security hawks who are quite rightly worried about digital sovereignty.</p>
<p>My thesis here is that this is an <em>unstoppable</em> coalition. Which is good news! For the first time in decades, victory is in our grasp.</p>
<p>#</p>
<p>So let me explain: 14 years ago, I stood in front of this group and explained the "War on General Purpose Computing." That was my snappy name for this fight, but the boring name that they use in legislatures for it is "anticircumvention,"</p>
<p>Under anticircumvention law, it's a crime to alter the functioning of a digital product or service, unless the manufacturer approves of your modification, and – crucially – this is true <em>whether or not</em> your modification violates <em>any other law</em>.</p>
<p>Anticircumvention law originates in the USA: Section 1201 of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 establishes a felony punishable by a five year prison sentence and a $500,000 fine for a first offense for bypassing an "access control" for a copyrighted work.</p>
<p>So practically speaking, if you design a device or service with even the flimsiest of systems to prevent modification of its application code or firmware, it's a felony – a jailable felony – to modify that code or firmware. It's also a felony to disclose information about <em>how</em> to bypass that access control, which means that pen-testers who even <em>describe</em> how they access a device or system face criminal liability.</p>
<p>Under anticircumvention law any manufacturer can trivially turn their product into a no-go zone, criminalizing the act of investigating its defects, criminalizing the act of reporting on its defects, and criminalizing the act of remediating its defects.</p>
<p>This is a law that Jay Freeman rightly calls "Felony Contempt of Business Model." Anticircumvention became the law of the land in 1998 when Bill Clinton signed the DMCA. But before you start snickering at those stupid Americans, know this: every <em>other</em> country in the world has passed a law <em>just like this</em> in the years since. Here in the EU, it came in through Article 6 of the 2001 EU Copyright Directive.</p>
<p>Now, it makes a certain twisted sense for the US to enact a law like this, after all, they are the world's tech powerhouse, home to the biggest, most powerful tech companies in the world. By making it illegal to modify digital products without the manufacturer's permission, America enhances the rent-extracting power of the most valuable companies on US stock exchanges.</p>
<p>But why would <em>Europe</em> pass a law like this? Europe is a massive tech <em>importer</em>. By extending legal protection to tech companies that want to steal their users' data and money, the EU was facilitating a one-way transfer of value from Europe to America. So why would Europe do this?</p>
<p>Well, let me tell you about the circumstances under which <em>other</em> countries came to enact their anticircumvention laws and maybe you'll spot a pattern that will answer this question.</p>
<p>Australia got its anticircumvention law through the US-Australia Free Trade Agreement, which obliges Australia to enact anticircumvention law.</p>
<p>Canada and Mexico got it through the US-Mexico-Canada Free Trade Agreement, which obliges Canada and Mexico to enact anticircumvention laws.</p>
<p>Andean nations like Chile got their anticircumvention laws through bilateral US free trade agreements, which oblige them to enact anticircumvention laws.</p>
<p>And the Central American nations got their anticircumvention laws through CAFTA – The Central American Free Trade Agreement with the USA – which obliges them to enact anticircumvention laws, too.</p>
<p>I assume you've spotted the pattern by now: the US trade representative has forced every one of its trading partners to adopt anticircumvention law, to facilitate the extraction of their own people's data and money by American firms. But of course, that only raises a further question: Why would every other country in the world agree to let America steal its own people's money and data, and block its domestic tech sector from making interoperable products that would prevent this theft?</p>
<p>Here's an anecdote that unravels this riddle: many years ago, in the years before Viktor Orban rose to power, I used to guest-lecture at a summer PhD program in political science at Budapest's Central European University. And one summer, after I'd lectured to my students about anticircumvention law, one of them approached me.</p>
<p>They had been the information minister of a Central American nation during the CAFTA negotiations, and one day, they'd received a phone-call from their trade negotiator, calling from the CAFTA bargaining table. The negotiator said, "You know how you told me not to give the Americans anticircumvention under any circumstances? Well, they're saying that they won't take our coffee unless we give them anticircumvention. And I'm sorry, but we just can't lose the US coffee market. Our economy would collapse. So we're going to give them anticircumvention. I'm really sorry."</p>
<p>That's it. That's why every government in the world allowed US Big Tech companies to declare open season on their people's private data and ready cash.</p>
<p>The alternative was tariffs. Well, I don't know if you've heard, but we've got tariffs now!</p>
<p>I mean, if someone threatens to burn your house down unless you follow their orders, and then they burn your house down anyway, you don't have to keep following their orders. So…Happy Liberation Day?</p>
<p>So far, every country in the world has had one of two responses to the Trump tariffs. The first one is: "Give Trump everything he asks for (except Greenland) and hope he stops being mad at you." This has been an absolute failure. Give Trump an inch, he'll take a mile. He'll take fucking <em>Greenland</em>. Capitulation is a failure.</p>
<p>But so is the other tactic: retaliatory tariffs. That's what we've done in Canada (like all the best Americans, I'm Canadian). Our top move has been to levy tariffs on the stuff we import from America, making the things we buy <em>more</em> expensive. That's a weird way to punish America! It's like punching yourself in the face as hard as you can, and hoping the downstairs neighbor says "Ouch!"</p>
<p>And it's <em>indiscriminate</em>. Why whack some poor farmer from a state that begins and ends with a vowel with tariffs on his soybeans. That guy never did anything bad to Canada.</p>
<p>But there's a third possible response to tariffs, one that's just sitting there, begging to be tried: what about repealing anticircumvention law?</p>
<p>If you're a technologist or an investor based in a country that's repealed its anticircumvention law, you can go into business making disenshittificatory products that plug into America's defective tech exports, allowing the people who own and use those products to use them in ways that are good for them, even if those uses make the company's shareholders mad.</p>
<p>Think of John Deere tractors: when a farmer's John Deere tractor breaks down, they are expected to repair it, swapping in new parts and assemblies to replace whatever's malfing. But the tractor won't recognize that new part and will not start working again, not until the farmer spends a couple hundred bucks on a service callout from an official John Deere tractor repair rep, whose only job is to type an unlock code into the tractor's console, to initialize the part and pair it with the tractor's main computing unit.</p>
<p>Modding a tractor to bypass this activation step violates anticircumvention law, meaning farmers all over the world are stuck with this ripoff garbage, because their <em>own</em> government will lock up anyone who makes a tractor mod that disables the parts-pairing check in this American product.</p>
<p>So what if Canada repealed Bill C-11, the Copyright Modernization Act of 2012 (that's our anticircumvention law)? Well, then a company like Honeybee, which makes tractor front-ends and attachments, could hire some smart University of Waterloo computer science grads, and put 'em to work jailbreaking the John Deere tractor's firmware, and offer it to everyone in the world. They could sell the crack to anyone with an internet connection and a payment method, including that poor American farmer whose soybeans we're currently tariffing.</p>
<p>It's hard to convey how much money is on the table here. Take just <em>one</em> example: Apple's App Store. Apple forces all app vendors into using its payment processor, and charges them a <em>30 percent</em> commission on every euro spent inside of an app.</p>
<p>30 percent! That's <em>such</em> a profitable business that Apple makes <em>$100 billion per year</em> on it. If the EU repeals Article 6 of the Copyright Directive, some smart geeks in Finland could reverse-engineer Apple's bootloaders and make a hardware dongle that jailbreaks phones so that they can use alternative app stores, and sell the dongle – along with the infrastructure to operate an app store – to anyone in the world who wants to go into business competing with Apple for users and app vendors.</p>
<p>Those competitors could offer a 90% discount to every crafter on Etsy, every performer on Patreon, every online news outlet, every game dev, every media store. Offer them a 90% discount on payments, and <em>still</em> make $10b/year.</p>
<p>Maybe Finland will never see another Nokia, but Nokia's a tough business to be in. You've got to make hardware, which is expensive and risky. But if the EU legalizes jailbreaking, then <em>Apple</em> would have to incur all the expense and risk of making and fielding hardware, while those Finnish geeks could cream off the $100b Apple sucks out of the global economy in an act of a disgusting, rip-off rent-seeking.</p>
<p>As Jeff Bezos said to the publishers: "Your margin is my opportunity." With these guys, it's always "disruption for thee, but not for me." When they do it to us, that's progress. When we do it to them, it's piracy, and every pirate wants to be an admiral.</p>
<p>Well, screw that. Move fast and break Tim Cook's things. Move fast and break <em>kings</em>!</p>
<p>It's funny: I spent 25 years getting my ass kicked by the US Trade Representative (in my defense, it wasn't a fair fight). I developed a kind of grudging admiration for the skill with which the USTR bound the entire world to a system of trade that conferred parochial advantages to America and its tech firms, giving them free rein to loot the world's data and economies. So it's been pretty amazing to watch Trump swiftly and decisively dismantle the global system of trade and destroy the case for the world continuing to arrange its affairs to protect the interests of America's capital class.</p>
<p>I mean, it's not a path I would have chosen. I'd have preferred no Trump at all to this breakthrough. But I'll take this massive own-goal if Trump insists. I mean, I'm not saying I've become an accelerationist, but at this point, I'm not exactly <em>not</em> an accelerationist.</p>
<p>Now, you might have heard that governments around the world have been trying to get Apple to open its App Store, and they've totally failed at this. When the EU hit Apple with an enforcement order under the Digital Markets Act, Apple responded by offering to allow third party app stores, but it would only allow those stores to sell apps that Apple had approved of.</p>
<p>And while those stores <em>could</em> use their own payment processors, Apple would charge them so much in junk fees that it would be <em>more</em> expensive to process a payment using your own system, and if Apple believed that a user's phone had been outside of the EU for 21 days, they'd remotely delete all that user's data and apps.</p>
<p>When the EU explained that this would not satisfy the regulation, Apple threatened to pull out of the EU. Then, once everyone had finished laughing, Apple filed more than a dozen bullshit objections to the order hoping to tie this up in court for a decade, the way Google and Meta did for the GDPR.</p>
<p>It's not clear that the EU can force Apple to write code that opens up the iOS platform for alternative app stores and payment methods, but there is one thing that the EU can absolutely do with 100% reliability, any time they want: the EU can decide not to let Apple use Europe's courts to shut down European companies that defend European merchants, performers, makers, news outlets, game devs and creative workers, from Apple's ripoff, by jailbreaking phones.</p>
<p>All the EU has to do is repeal Article 6 of the Copyright Directive, and, in so doing, strip Apple of the privilege of mobilizing the European justice system to shore up Apple's hundred billion dollar annual tax on the world's digital economy. The EU company that figures out how to reliably jailbreak iPhones will have customers all over the world, including in the USA, where Apple doesn't just use its veto over which apps you can run on your phone to suck 30% out of every dollar you spend, but where Apple also uses its control over the platform to strip out apps that protect Apple's customers from Trump's fascist takeover.</p>
<p>Back in October, Apple kicked the "ICE Block" app out of the App Store. That's an app that warns the user if there's a snatch squad of masked ICE thugs nearby looking to grab you off the street and send you to an offshore gulag. Apple internally classified ICE kidnappers as a "protected class," and then declared the ICE Block infringed on the rights of these poor, beset ICE goons.</p>
<p>And speaking of ICE thugs, there are plenty of qualified technologists who have fled the US this year, one step ahead of an ICE platoon looking to put them and their children into a camp. Those skilled hackers are now living all over the world, joined by investors who'd like to back a business whose success will be determined by how awesome its products are, and not how many $TRUMP coins they buy.</p>
<p>Apple's margin could be <em>their</em> opportunity.</p>
<p>Legalizing jailbreaking, raiding the highest margin lines of business of the most profitable companies in America is a <em>much</em> better response to the Trump tariffs than retaliatory tariffs.</p>
<p>For one thing, this is a <em>targeted</em> response: go after Big Tech's margins and you're mounting a frontal assault on the businesses whose CEOs each paid a million bucks to sit behind Trump on the inauguration dais.</p>
<p>Raiding Big Tech's margins is not an attack on the American people, nor on the small American businesses that are ripped off by Big Tech. It's a raid on the companies that screw everyday Americans <em>and</em> everyone else in the world. It's a way to make everyone in the world richer at the expense of these ripoff companies.</p>
<p>It beats the shit out of blowing hundreds of billions of dollars building AI data-centers in the hopes that someday, a sector that's lost nearly a trillion dollars shipping defective chatbots will figure out a use for GPUs that doesn't start hemorrhaging money the minute they plug them in.</p>
<p>So here are our new allies in the war on general-purpose computation: businesses and technologists who want to make billions of dollars raiding Big Tech's margins, and policymakers who want their country to be the disenshittification nation – the country that doesn't merely protect its people's money and privacy by buying jailbreaks from other countries, but rather, the country that makes billions of dollars <em>selling</em> that privacy and pocketbook-defending tech to the rest of the world.</p>
<p>That's a powerful alliance, but those are not the only allies Trump has pushed into our camp. There's another powerful ally waiting in the wings.</p>
<p>Remember last June, when the International Criminal Court in the Hague issued an arrest warrant for the génocidaire Benjamin Netanyahu, and Trump denounced the ICC, and then the ICC lost its Outlook access, its email archives, its working files, its address books, its calendars?</p>
<p>Microsoft says they didn't brick the ICC – that it's a coincidence. But when it comes to a he-said/Clippy-said between the justices of the ICC and the convicted monopolists of Microsoft, I know who <em>I</em> believe.</p>
<p>This is exactly the kind of infrastructural risk that we were warned of if we let Chinese companies like Huawei supply our critical telecoms equipment. Virtually every government ministry, every major corporation, every small business and every household in the world have locked themselves into a US-based, cloud-based service.</p>
<p>The handful of US Big Tech companies that supply the world's administrative tools are all vulnerable to pressure from the Trump admin, and that means that Trump can brick an entire <em>nation</em>.</p>
<p>The attack on the ICC was an act of cyberwarfare, like the Russian hackers who shut down Ukrainian power-generation facilities, except that Microsoft doesn't have to <em>hack</em> Outlook to brick the ICC – they <em>own</em> Outlook.</p>
<p>Under the US CLOUD Act of 2018, the US government can compel any US-based company to disclose <em>any</em> of its users' data – including foreign governments – and this is true no matter where that data is stored. Last July, Anton Carniaux, Director of Public and Legal Affairs at Microsoft France, told a French government inquiry that he "couldn't guarantee" that Microsoft wouldn't hand sensitive French data over to the US government, even if that data was stored in a European data-center.</p>
<p>And under the CLOUD Act, the US government can slap gag orders on the companies that it forces to cough up that data, so there'd be no way to even know if this happened, or whether it's already happened.</p>
<p>It doesn't stop at administrative tools, either: remember back in 2022, when Putin's thugs looted millions of dollars' worth of John Deere tractors from Ukraine and those tractors showed up in Chechnya? The John Deere company pushed an over-the-air kill signal to those tractors and bricked 'em.</p>
<p>John Deere is every bit as politically vulnerable to the Trump admin as Microsoft is, and they can brick most of the tractors in the world, and the tractors they <em>can't</em> brick are probably made by Massey Ferguson, the number-two company in the ag-tech cartel, which is also an American company and just as vulnerable to political attacks from the US government.</p>
<p>Now, none of this will be news to global leaders. Even before Trump and Microsoft bricked the ICC they were trying to figure out a path to "digital sovereignty." But the Trump administration's outrageous conduct and rhetoric over past 11 months has turned "digital sovereignty" from a nice-to-have into a must-have.</p>
<p>So finally, we're seeing some movement, like "Eurostack," a project to clone the functionality of US Big Tech silos in free/open source software, and to build EU-based data-centers that this code can run on.</p>
<p>But Eurostack is heading for a crisis. It's great to build open, locally hosted, auditable, trustworthy services that replicate the useful features of Big Tech, but you also need to build the adversarial interoperability tools that allow for mass exporting of millions of documents, the sensitive data-structures and edit histories.</p>
<p>We need scrapers and headless browsers to accomplish the adversarial interoperability that will guarantee ongoing connectivity to institutions that are still hosted on US cloud-based services, because US companies are <em>not</em> going to facilitate the mass exodus of international customers from their platform.</p>
<p>Just think of how Apple responded to the relatively minor demand to open up the iOS App Store, and now imagine the thermonuclear foot-dragging, tantrum-throwing and malicious compliance they'll come up with when faced with the departure of a plurality of the businesses and governments in a 27-nation bloc of 500,000,000 affluent consumers.</p>
<p>Any serious attempt at digital sovereignty needs migration tools that work <em>without</em> the cooperation of the Big Tech companies. Otherwise, this is like building housing for East Germans and locating it in <em>West</em> Berlin. It doesn't matter how great the housing is, your intended audience is going to really struggle to move in unless you tear down the wall.</p>
<p>Step one of tearing down that wall is killing anticircumvention law, so that we can run virtual devices that can be scripted, break bootloaders to swap out firmware and generally seize the means of computation.</p>
<p>So this is the third bloc in the disenshittification army: not just digital rights hippies like me; not just entrepreneurs and economic development wonks rubbing their hands together at the thought of transforming American trillions into European billions; but also the national security hawks who are 100% justified in their extreme concern about their country's reliance on American platforms that have been shown to be <em>totally</em> unreliable.</p>
<p>This is how we'll get a post-American internet: with an unstoppable coalition of activists, entrepreneurs and natsec hawks.</p>
<p>This has been a long time coming. Since the post-war settlement, the world has treated the US as a neutral platform, a trustworthy and stable maintainer of critical systems for global interchange, what the political scientists Henry Farrell and Abraham Newman call the "Underground Empire." But over the past 15 years, the US has systematically shattered global trust in its institutions, a process that only accelerated under Trump.</p>
<p>Take transoceanic fiber optic cables: the way the transoceanic fiber routes were planned, the majority of these cables make landfall on the coasts of the USA where the interconnections are handled. There's a good case for this hub-and-spoke network topology, especially compared to establishing direct links between every country. That's an Order(N^2) problem: directly linking each of the planet Earth's 205 countries to every other country would require 20,910 fiber links.</p>
<p>But putting all the world's telecoms eggs in America's basket only works if the US doesn't take advantage of its centrality, and while many people worried about what the US could do with the head-ends of the world's global fiber infra, it wasn't until Mark Klein's 2006 revelations about the NSA's nation-scale fiber optic taps in AT&amp;T's network, and Ed Snowden's 2013 documents showing the global scale of this wiretapping, that the world had to confront the undeniable reality that the US could not be trusted to serve as the world's fiber hub.</p>
<p>It's not just fiber. The world does business in dollars. Most countries maintain dollar accounts at the Fed in New York as their major source of foreign reserves. But in 2005, American vulture capitalists bought up billions of dollars worth of Argentinian government bonds after the sovereign nation of Argentina had declared bankruptcy.</p>
<p>They convinced a judge in New York to turn over the government of Argentina's US assets to them to make good on loans that these debt collectors had not issued, but had bought up at pennies on the dollar. At that moment, every government in the world had to confront the reality that they could not trust the US Federal Reserve with their foreign reserves. But what else could they use?</p>
<p>Without a clear answer, dollar dominance continued, but then, under Biden, Putin-aligned oligarchs and Russian firms lost access to the SWIFT system for dollar clearing. This is when goods – like oil – are priced in dollars, so that buyers only need to find someone who will trade their own currency for dollars, which they can then swap for any commodity in the world.</p>
<p>Again, there's a sound case for dollar clearing: it's just not practical to establish deep, liquid pairwise trading market for all of the world's nearly 200 currencies, it's another O(N^2) problem.</p>
<p>But it only works if the dollar is a neutral platform. Once the dollar becomes an instrument of US foreign policy – whether or not you agree with that policy – it's no longer a neutral platform, and the world goes looking for an alternative.</p>
<p>No one knows what that alternative's going to be, just as no one knows what configuration the world's fiber links will end up taking. There's kilometers of fiber being stretched across the ocean floor, and countries are trying out some pretty improbable gambits as dollar alternatives, like Ethiopia revaluing its sovereign debt in Chinese renminbi. Without a clear alternative to America's enshittified platforms, the post-American century is off to a rocky start.</p>
<p>But there's one post-American system that's easy to imagine. The project to rip out all the cloud connected, backdoored, untrustworthy black boxes that power our institutions, our medical implants, our vehicles and our tractors; and replace it with collectively maintained, open, free, trustworthy, auditable code.</p>
<p>This project is the <em>only</em> one that benefits from economies of scale, rather than being paralyzed by exponential crises of scale. That's because any open, free tool adopted by any public institution – like the Eurostack services – can be audited, localized, pen-tested, debugged and improved by institutions in every other country.</p>
<p>It's a commons, more like a science than a technology, in that it is universal and international and collaborative. We don't have dueling western and Chinese principles of structural engineering. Rather, we have universal principles for making sure buildings don't fall down, adapted to local circumstances.</p>
<p>We wouldn't tolerate secrecy in the calculations used to keep our buildings upright, and we shouldn't tolerate opacity in the software that keeps our tractors, hearing aids, ventilators, pacemakers, trains, games consoles, phones, CCTVs, door locks, and government ministries working.</p>
<p>The thing is, software is not an asset, it's a liability. The capabilities that running software delivers – automation, production, analysis and administration – <em>those</em> are assets. But the software itself? That's a liability. Brittle, fragile, forever breaking down as the software upstream of it, downstream of it, and adjacent to it is updated or swapped out, revealing defects and deficiencies in systems that may have performed well for years.</p>
<p>Shifting software to commons-based production is a way to reduce the liability that software imposes on its makers and users,  balancing out that liability among many players.</p>
<p>Now, obviously, tech bosses are totally clueless when it comes to this. They really do think that software is an asset. That's why they're so fucking horny to have chatbots shit out software at superhuman speeds. That's why they think it's <em>good</em> that they've got a chatbot that "produces a thousand times more code than a human programmer."</p>
<p>Producing code that isn't designed for legibility and maintainability, that is optimized, rather, for speed of production, is a way to incur tech debt at scale.</p>
<p>This is a neat encapsulation of the whole AI story: the chatbot can't do your job, but an AI salesman can convince your boss to fire you and replace you with a chatbot that <em>can't</em> do your job.</p>
<p>Your boss is an easy mark for that chatbot hustler because your boss hates you. In their secret hearts, bosses understand that if they stopped coming to work, the business would run along just fine, but if the <em>workers</em> stopped showing up, the company would grind to a halt.</p>
<p>Bosses like to tell themselves that they're in the driver's seat, but really, they fear that they're strapped into the back seat playing with a Fisher Price steering wheel. For them, AI is a way to wire the toy steering wheel directly into the company's drive-train. It's the realization of the fantasy of a company without workers.</p>
<p>When I was walking the picket line in Hollywood during the writer's strike, a writer told me that you prompt an AI the same way a studio boss gives shitty notes to a writer's room: "Make me ET, but make it about a dog, and give it a love interest, and a car-chase in the third act."</p>
<p>Say that to a writer's room and they will call you a <em>fucking idiot suit</em> and tell you "Why don't you go back to your office and make a spreadsheet, you nitwit. The grownups here are writing a movie."</p>
<p>Meanwhile, if you give that prompt to a chatbot, it will cheerfully shit out a script exactly to spec. The fact that this script will be terrible and unusable is less important than the prospect of a working life in which no one calls you a fucking idiot suit.</p>
<p>AI dangles the promise of a writer's room without writers, a movie without actors, a hospital without nurses, a coding shop without coders.</p>
<p>When Mark Zuckerberg went on a podcast and announced that the average American had three friends, but wanted 15 friends, and that he could solve this by giving us chatbots instead of friends, we all dunked on him as an out-of-touch billionaire Martian who didn't understand the nature of friendship.</p>
<p>But the reality is that for Zuck, your friends are a problem. Your friends' interactions with you determine how much time you spend on his platforms, and thus how many revenue-generating ads he can show you.</p>
<p>Your friends stubbornly refuse to organize their relationship with you in a way that maximizes the return to his shareholders. So Zuck is over there in Menlo Park, furiously fantasizing about replacing your friends with chatbots, because that way, he can finally realize the dream of a social media service without any socializing.</p>
<p>Rich, powerful people are, at root, solipsists. The only way to amass a billion dollars is to inflict misery and privation on whole populations. The only way to look yourself in the mirror after you've done that, is to convince yourself that those people don't matter, that, in some important sense, they aren't <em>real</em>.</p>
<p>Think of Elon Musk calling everyone who disagrees with him an "NPC,” or all those "Effective Altruists," who claimed the moral high ground by claiming to care about 53 trillion imaginary artificial humans who will come into existence in 10,000 years at the expense of extending moral consideration to people alive today.</p>
<p>Or think of how Trump fired all the US government scientists, and then announced the "Genesis" program, declaring that the US would begin generating <em>annual</em> "moonshot"-scale breakthroughs, with a chatbot. It's science without scientists.</p>
<p>Chatbots can't really do science, but from Trump's perspective, they're still better than scientists, because a chatbot won't ever tell him not to stare at an eclipse, or not to inject bleach. A chatbot won't ever tell him that trans people exist, or that the climate emergency is real.</p>
<p>Powerful people are suckers for AI, because AI fuels the fantasy of a world without people: just a boss and a computer, and no ego-shattering confrontations with people who know how to <em>do</em> things telling you "no."</p>
<p>AI is a way to produce tech debt at scale, to replace skilled writers with defective spicy autocomplete systems, to lose money at a rate not seen in living memory.</p>
<p>Now, compare that with the project of building a post-American internet: a project to <em>reduce</em> tech debt, to unlock America's monopoly trillions and divide them among the world's entrepreneurs (for whom they represent untold profits), and the world's technology users (for whom they represent untold savings); all while building resiliency and sovereignty.</p>
<p>Now, some of you are probably feeling pretty cynical about this right now. After all, your political leaders have demonstrated decades of ineffectual and incompetent deference to the US, and an inability to act, even when the need was dire. If your leaders couldn't act decisively on the climate emergency, what hope do we have of them taking this moment seriously?</p>
<p>But crises precipitate change. Remember when <em>another</em> mad emperor – Vladimir Putin – invaded Ukraine, and Europe experienced a dire energy shortage? In three short years, the continent's solar uptake skyrocketed. The EU went from being 15 years <em>behind</em> in its energy transition, to ten years <em>ahead</em> of schedule.</p>
<p>Because when you're shivering in the dark, a lot of fights you didn't think were worth it are suddenly existential battles you can't afford to lose. Sure, no one wants to argue with a tedious neighbor who has an aesthetic temper tantrum at the thought of a solar panel hanging from their neighbor's balcony.</p>
<p>But when it's winter, and there's no Russian gas, and you're shivering in the dark, then that person can take their aesthetic objection to balcony solar, fold it until it's all corners, and shove it right up their ass.</p>
<p>Besides, we don't need Europe to lead the charge on a post-American internet by repealing anticircumvention. <em>Any</em> country could do it! And the country that gets there first gets to reap the profits from supplying jailbreaking tools to the rest of the world, it gets to be the Disenshittification Nation, and everyone else in the world gets to buy those tools and defend themselves from US tech companies' monetary and privacy plunder.</p>
<p>Just one country has to break the consensus, and the case for every country doing so is the strongest it's ever been. It used to be that countries that depended on USAID had to worry about losing food, medical and cash supports if they pissed off America. But Trump killed USAID, so now that's a dead letter.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, America's status as the planet's most voracious consumer has been gutted by decades of anti-worker, pro-billionaire policies. Today, the US is in the grips of its third consecutive "K-shaped" recovery, that's an economic rally where the rich get richer, and everyone else gets poorer. For a generation, America papered over that growing inequality with easy credit, with everyday Americans funding their consumption with credit cards and second and third mortgages.</p>
<p>So long as they could all afford to keep buying, other countries had to care about America as an export market. But a generation of extraction has left the bottom 90% of Americans struggling to buy groceries and other necessities, carrying crushing debt from skyrocketing shelter, education and medical expenses that they can't hope to pay down, thanks to 50 years of wage stagnation.</p>
<p>The Trump administration has sided firmly with debt collectors, price gougers, and rent extractors. Trump neutered enforcement against rent-fixing platforms like Realpage, restarted debt payments for eight million student borrowers, and killed a plan to make live-saving drugs a little cheaper, leaving Americans to continue to pay the highest drug prices in the world.</p>
<p>Every dollar spent servicing a loan is a dollar that can't go to consumption. And as more and more Americans slip into poverty, the US is gutting programs that spend money on the public's behalf, like SNAP, the food stamps program that helps an ever-larger slice of the American public stave off hunger.</p>
<p>America is chasing the "world without people" dream, where working people have nothing, spend nothing, and turn every penny over to rentiers who promptly flush that money into the stock market, shitcoins, or gambling sites. But I repeat myself.</p>
<p>Even the US military – long a sacrosanct institution – is being kneecapped to enrich rent-seekers. Congress just killed a military "right to repair" law. So now, US soldiers stationed abroad will have to continue the Pentagon's proud tradition of shipping materiel from generators to jeeps back to America to be fixed by their manufacturers at a 10,000% markup, because the Pentagon routinely signs maintenance contracts that prohibit it from teaching a Marine how to fix an engine.</p>
<p>The post-American world is really coming on fast. As we repeal our anticircumvention laws, we don't have to care what America thinks, we don't have to care about their tariffs, because they're already whacking us with tariffs; and because the only people left in the US who can afford to buy things are rich people, who just don't buy enough stuff. There's only so many Lambos and Sub-Zeros even the most guillotineable plute can usefully own.</p>
<p>But what if <em>European</em> firms want to go on taking advantage of anticircumvention laws? Well, there's good news there, too. "Good news," because the EU firms that rely on anticircumvention are engaged in the sleaziest, most disgusting frauds imaginable.</p>
<p>Anticircumvention law is the reason that Volkswagen could get away with Dieselgate. By imposing legal liability on reverse-engineers who might have discovered this lethal crime, Article 6 of the Copyright Directive created a chilling effect, and thousands of Europeans died, every year.</p>
<p>Today, Germany's storied automakers are carrying on the tradition of Dieselgate, sabotaging their cars to extract rent from drivers. From Mercedes, which rents you the accelerator pedal in your luxury car, only unlocking the full acceleration curve of your engine if you buy a monthly subscription; to BMW, which rents you the automated system that automatically dims your high-beams if there's oncoming traffic.</p>
<p>Legalize jailbreaking and any mechanic in Europe could unlock those subscription features for one price, and not share <em>any</em> of that money with BMW and Mercedes.</p>
<p>Then there's Medtronic, a company that pretends it is Irish. Medtronic is the world's largest med-tech company, having purchased all their competitors, and then undertaken the largest "tax-inversion" in history, selling themselves to a tiny Irish firm, in order to magick their profits into a state of untaxable grace, floating in the Irish Sea.</p>
<p>Medtronic supplies the world's most widely used ventilators, and it booby-traps them the same way John Deere booby-traps its tractors. After a hospital technician puts a new part in a Medtronic ventilator, the ventilator's central computing unit refuses to recognize the part until it completes a cryptographic handshake, proving that an authorized Medtronic technician was paid hundreds of euros to certify a repair that the hospital's own technician probably performed.</p>
<p>It's just a way to suck hundreds of euros out of hospitals every time a ventilator breaks. This would be bad enough, but during the covid lockdowns, when every ventilator was desperately needed, and when the planes stopped flying, there was no way for a Medtronic tech to come and bless the hospital technicians' repairs. This was lethal. It killed people.</p>
<p>There's one more European company that relies on anticircumvention that I want to discuss here, because they're old friends of CCC: that's the Polish train company Newag. Newag sabotages its own locomotives, booby-trapping them so that if they sense they have been taken to a rival's service yard, the train bricks itself. When the train operator calls Newag about this mysterious problem, the company "helpfully" remotes into the locomotive's computers, to perform "diagnostics," which is just sending a unbricking command to the vehicle, a service for which they charge 20,000 euros.</p>
<p>Last year, Polish hackers from the security research firm Dragon Sector presented on their research into this disgusting racket in this very hall, and now, they're being sued by Newag under anticircumvention law, for making absolutely true disclosures about Newag's deliberately defective products.</p>
<p>So these are the European stakeholders for anticircumvention law: the Dieselgate killers, the car companies who want to rent you your high-beams and accelerator, the med-tech giant that bricked all the ventilators during the pandemic, and the company that tied Poland to the train-tracks.</p>
<p>I relish the opportunity to fight these bastards in Brussels, as they show up and cry "Won't someone think of the train saboteurs?"</p>
<p>The enshittification of technology – the decay of the platforms and systems we rely on – has many causes: the collapse of competition, regulatory capture, the smashing of tech workers' power. But most of all, enshittification is the result of anticircumvention law's ban on interoperability.</p>
<p>By blocking interop, by declaring war on the general-purpose computer, our policy-makers created an enshittogenic environment that rewarded companies for being shitty, and ushered in the enshittocene, in which everything is turning to shit.</p>
<p>Let's call time on enshittification. Let's seize the means of computation. Let's build the drop-in, free, open, auditable alternatives to the services and firmware we rely on.</p>
<p>Let's end the era of silos. I mean, isn't it fucking <em>weird</em> how you have to care which network someone is using if you want to talk to them? Instead of just deciding <em>who</em> you want to talk to?</p>
<p>The fact that you have to figure out whether the discussion you're trying to join is on Twitter or Bluesky, Mastodon or Instagram – that is just the most Prodigy/AOL/Compuserve-ass way of running a digital world. I mean, 1990 called and they want their walled gardens back</p>
<p>Powerful allies are joining our side in the War on General Purpose Computation. It's not just people like us, who've been fighting for this whole goddamned century, but also countries that want to convert American tech's hoarded trillions into fuel for a single-use rocket that boosts their own tech sector into a stable orbit.</p>
<p>It's national security hawks who are worried about Trump bricking their ministries or their tractors, and who are also worried – with just cause – about Xi Jinping bricking all their solar inverters and batteries. Because, after all, the post-American internet is also a post-Chinese internet!</p>
<p>Nothing should be designed to be field updatable without the user's permission. Nothing critical should be a black box.</p>
<p>Like I said at the start of this talk, I have been doing this work for 24 years at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, throwing myself at a door that was double-locked and deadbolted, and now that door is open a crack and goddammit, I am <em>hopeful</em>.</p>
<p>Not optimistic. Fuck optimism! Optimism is the idea that things will get better no matter what we do. I know that what we do matters. Hope is the belief that if we can improve things, even in small ways, we can ascend the gradient toward the world we want, and attain higher vantage points from which new courses of action, invisible to us here at our lower elevation, will be revealed.</p>
<p>Hope is a discipline. It requires that you not give in to despair. So I'm here to tell you: don't despair.</p>
<p>All this decade, all over the world, countries have taken up arms against concentrated corporate power. We've had big, muscular antitrust attacks on big corporations in the US (under Trump I <em>and</em> Biden); in Canada; in the UK; in the EU and member states like Germany, France and Spain; in Australia; in Japan and South Korea and Singapore; in Brazil; and in <em>China</em>.</p>
<p>This is a near-miraculous turn of affairs. All over the world, governments are declaring war on monopolies, the source of billionaires' wealth and power.</p>
<p>Even the most forceful wind is invisible. We can only see it by its effects. What we're seeing here is that whenever a politician bent on curbing corporate power unfurls a sail, no matter where in the world that politician is, that sail fills with wind and propels the policy in ways that haven't been seen in generations.</p>
<p>The long becalming of the fight over corporate power has ended, and a fierce, unstoppable wind is blowing. It's not just blowing in Europe, or in Canada, or in South Korea, Japan, China, Australia or Brazil. It's blowing in America, too. Never forget that as screwed up and terrifying as things are in America, the country has experienced, and continues to experience, a tsunami of antitrust bills and enforcement actions at the local, state and federal level.</p>
<p>And never forget that the post-American internet will be <em>good for Americans</em>. Because, in a K-shaped, bifurcated, unequal America, the trillions that American companies loot from the world don't trickle down to Americans. The average American holds a portfolio of assets that rounds to zero, and that includes stock in US tech companies.</p>
<p>The average American isn't a shareholder in Big Tech, the average American is a <em>victim</em> of Big Tech. Liberating the world from US Big Tech is also liberating America from US Big Tech.</p>
<p>That's been EFF's mission for 35 years. It's been my mission at EFF for 25 years. If you want to get involved in this fight – and I hope you do – it can be your mission, too. You can join EFF, and you can join groups in your own country, like Netzpolitik here in Germany, or the Irish Council for Civil Liberties, or La Quadrature du Net in France, or the Open Rights Group in the UK, or EF Finland, or ISOC Bulgaria, XNet, DFRI, Quintessenz, Bits of Freedom, Openmedia, FSFE, or any of dozens of organizations around the world.</p>
<p>The door is open a crack, the wind is blowing, the post-American internet is upon us: a new, good internet that delivers all the technological self-determination of the old, good internet, and the ease of use of Web 2.0 so that our normie friends can use it, too.</p>
<p>And I can't wait for all of us to get to hang out there. It's gonna be <em>great</em>.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://zakhary.dev/blog/gbc-web-button">https://zakhary.dev/blog/gbc-web-button</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46507963">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article> <header>    </header> <hr> <section> <p>Like many other 90s styles coming back in fashion, I’ve been seeing those retro
<a href="https://indieweb.org/88x31" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">88x31</a> web buttons on more personal websites these days. What a throwback.
Naturally, I scoured the internet to find buttons to add to my footer (see
below). Since I couldn’t find a Game Boy one that I liked, obviously I had to
make my own.</p>
<p>There’s only one problem: I’m not patient (read: talented) enough to make the
art myself.</p>
<h2 id="the-concept"><a rel="nofollow" href="#the-concept">The Concept</a></h2>
<p>My idea was to use the boot animation from the Game Boy Color placed inside the
traditional grey frame. Something like this:</p>
<figure>
  <img src="https://zakhary.dev/img/usr/8304eeab.png" alt="Mock-up of the web button">
  <figcaption>
    A rough mock-up of the web button.
  </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Not too complicated, right? So you’d think.<span><label for="footnote-0fe45eb5"></label><span><span>Wait just a second. Surely it can’t be that hard to make the animation
if I already have the mock-up, right? Well, I kinda cheated and used the
final result to make that.</span></span></span></p>
<h2 id="animating"><a rel="nofollow" href="#animating">Animating</a></h2>
<p>First, we’ve got to find a way to export the animation from boot ROM. The
easiest way I could think of to do that was to play it in an emulator<span><label for="footnote-24570c6d"></label><span><span>Regrettably my emulator <a href="https://rugby.zakhary.dev/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Rugby</a> doesn’t (yet) support Game Boy Color,
so I used the fantastic <a href="https://sameboy.github.io/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">SameBoy</a> for this next part.</span></span></span> and
save screenshots of each frame individually. Well, in order to do that we need a
way to stop the emulator at each frame. Thankfully, the emulator I used has
breakpoints.</p>
<p>So, where should those breakpoints go? Time for a quick crash course:</p>
<p>The animation is programmed into the Game Boy’s boot ROM in GBZ80 assembly. This
is proprietary code written by Nintendo that powers up the system and validates
the cartridge before handing off execution to the game. Thankfully, some smart
people have done the hard work of (1) dumping, (2) disassembling, and (3)
labelling the <a href="https://gist.github.com/drhelius/6063265" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">boot ROM</a> for us.<span><label for="footnote-a3653881"></label><span><span>I feel pretty comfortable calling my use of the boot ROM in this
project “fair use.”</span></span></span></p>
<p>For each Game Boy frame, there’s a period of time where the LCD idles before
drawing the next frame. This is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertical_blanking_interval" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">vblank</a>. Taking a look at the
disassembly, we can see where vblank occurs:</p>

<p>Using the debugger, we can see that this function is called from the following
code:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>sub_0291</span><span>:</span></span>
<span><span>    call</span><span>    Wait_for_next_VBLANK</span></span>

<p>As we can see from the generated label <code>sub_0291</code>, this block probably lives at
address <code>$0291</code>. Putting a breakpoint here and stepping into the function
reveals the address of <code>Wait_for_next_VBLANK</code> to be <code>$0211</code>. After a quick reset
and setting the breakpoint, we can step through each frame of the animation.</p>
<p>This next part was a bit tedious: I repeatedly <code>continue</code>d the debugger, taking
an emulator screenshot at each frame.<span><label for="footnote-03eebb5a"></label><span><span>Using <code>⌘S</code> in SameBoy will capture a screenshot using the emulated

<p>Now that we’ve <del>copied Nintendo’s homework</del> made our Game Boy animation, it’s
time to reshape it into an artistic web button masterpiece.</p>
<h3 id="cropping"><a rel="nofollow" href="#cropping">Cropping</a></h3>
<p>Next up we’ve got to crop the animation to the desired 88x31. Let’s load up the
GIF to see how big the logo is. I used <a href="https://www.aseprite.org/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Aseprite</a> for this, but really any
application that lets you count pixels in an image will do. Doing this, we see
the “Game Boy” text logo is… 127x22 pixels wide. Hmm. That’s too big to fit
into an 88x31 button, but I guess that makes sense considering the Game Boy
Color’s screen is 160x144 pixels. It’ll have to be scaled down later.</p>
<p>Measuring the logo’s starting location to be <code>(x: 16, y: 48)</code>, we can now crop
away. Cropping a GIF sounds like it should be a lot of work, but it can be
easily accomplished on the CLI with, you guessed it, <code>magick</code>:</p>

<h3 id="scaling"><a rel="nofollow" href="#scaling">Scaling</a></h3>
<p>The cropped logo needs to be scaled to fit into 88x31. Say it with me folks.
<code>magick</code>:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>magick</span><span> cropped.gif</span><span> -resize</span><span> 82x</span><span> scaled.gif</span></span></code></pre>
<p>This scales (resizes) the GIF to be 82 pixels wide while maintaining the aspect
ratio, the result being 82x14. I chose 82 pixels wide specifically since that’ll
allow us to fit for the next stage.</p>

<p>Several of the 88x31 buttons I found online have a common frame with a
2-pixel-wide border. It looks like this:</p>

<p>To apply this frame to the scaled animation, we’ll need to do the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Centre the scaled animation into a 88x31 space;</li>
<li>Fill in the newly added space with grey;</li>
<li>Add the border frame on top of the animation.</li>
</ol>
<p>Hopefully you know the drill by now:</p>

<p>Wait, what’s that ugly white square doing there? Oh, right. The animation had a
white background. Gotta fix that I guess.</p>
<h3 id="fixing-that"><a rel="nofollow" href="#fixing-that">Fixing That</a></h3>
<p>This is actually quite straightforward. Removing the white background is easy,
although if we do it with what we currently have there ends up being undesirable
artifacts caused by the prior scaling.</p>

<p>The trick here is to replace the white background before scaling. Here’s also a
really great opportunity to fully show off how powerful ImageMagick’s transform
pipeline can be. Going back to our uncropped animation, we can apply all
previous steps at once like so.</p>

<p>As we all know, the final stage of any good art project is excising tormented
apparitions from our glorious creation!</p>
<p>See that shadow of the logo that appears as it fades away? That’s called
ghosting, and is caused by the original animation’s fade going to white instead
of the grey we’ve chosen as our new background colour.</p>
<h3 id="remapping"><a rel="nofollow" href="#remapping">Remapping</a></h3>
<p>Fixing this is going to be a little more tricky than it was for the compression
artifacts above. In order to fix this, we’ll need remap the transition colours
so that the logo’s blue-to-white transition instead fades to grey.</p>
<p>To do this, we’ll first need a way to identify all those transition colours.
Extracting the frames of the animation will allow us to analyze their colours in
a histogram:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span># Extract original animation's frames</span></span>

<p>It’s not immediately obvious what we’re looking for here, but we can see that by
frame 164 there’s only one colour. That corresponds to the whiteout at the end
of the animation. Looking a few frames before, we consistently see 209 frames
helpfully labelled as grey, and 1560 frames in some other colour. Conspicuously,
that other colour only varies in red and green, but remains fully blue.</p>

Since we’re updating the background colour to <code>#C0C0C0</code>, we’ll need a way to
modify the transition colours to instead fade to that shade of grey.
Functionally, for each colour we (1) compute how far along the transition we
are, then (2) use this value to re-compute an equivalent transition colour in
the desired fade range.</p>
<p>Here’s where I’ll admit my shame: by this point I was getting lazy and didn’t
feel like using my brain to write my own colour interpolation. So I turned to
the AI overlords to do this work for me.</p>

and running again, we see that it does indeed get transformed to <code>#C0C0C0</code>. As
an additional sanity check, here are generated images of the palettes we intend
to swap.</p>

<p>All that’s left is to perform the colour substitution. Admittedly, I was having
some trouble doing this using ImageMagick’s <code>-clut</code>, so I arrived at a much less
elegant solution: use a series of <code>-fill</code>/<code>-opaque</code> to manually replace each
colour. Adding the following to the bottom of the Python script, we can at least
automate writing all that out.</p>

<p>As someone who doesn’t have an artistic bone in my body (doctor’s diagnosis), I
think it turned out pretty great! I learned a lot about ImageMagick throughout
this adventure, and I hope you did too. Please feel free to use this button
however you wish. Attribution is not at all necessary, but is welcome and
appreciated regardless.</p>
