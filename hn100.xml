<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><a href="https://wise.com/">Wise</a> has stolen more than $60,000 AUD from us, and refuses to let us access it.</p><p><a href="https://secretlab.games/">We’ve</a> had a Wise account for around 5 years (since they were called TransferWise). It’s been a really useful way to transact in foreign currencies, and pay for things when we’re travelling for work.</p><p>In early-April 2025, Wise asked us to provide some additional information on our Ultimate Beneficial Owners (UBOs) by uploading a statement of shareholders, and the ID of the owners. Perfectly reasonable stuff for an entity that pretends to be a bank to ask for.</p><p>In response, in early-April 2025, we uploaded a <a href="https://asic.gov.au/online-services/search-asic-registers/search-fees/">paid ASIC Extract</a> for the business, and scans of the passports of the two UBOs. The message requesting additional information on UBOs went away, and the account continued ticking along.</p><p>On 6 May 2025, with no notice, and with no out of the ordinary or large transactions happening, Wise started declining our card on all transactions, and blocking any ACH/wire transfers out of the account.</p><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://hey.paris/posts/wise/wise1.png"></figure><p>There is a link on each declined transaction that says offers a way to fix it:</p><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://hey.paris/posts/wise/wise2.png"></figure><p>Alas, it does not, and has never worked:</p><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://hey.paris/posts/wise/wise3.png"></figure><p>Every time a transaction declines, we also get an email from Wise:</p><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://hey.paris/posts/wise/wise4.png"></figure><p>But again, alas, the “Unblock your account” button in this email also goes to an unhelpful page:</p><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://hey.paris/posts/wise/wise5.png"></figure><p>Lodging a support ticket yields an unhelpful response:</p><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://hey.paris/posts/wise/wise6.png"></figure><p>And replying makes them more confusing:</p><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://hey.paris/posts/wise/wise7.png"></figure><p>And then, more confusing still, when they ask for the same documents they already had, again:</p><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://hey.paris/posts/wise/wise8.png"></figure><p>Calling results in someone in their call centre telling us it’s a “bug” and will be “fixed soon”, or that I need to upload more documents. And when asked what documents, they list the same document we already uploaded (an ASIC Extract). And round and round we go.</p><p>So, we’re out $60,000+ AUD, and Wise refuses to help.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>From early-morning school drop-offs to seniors booking rides to the hospital, from suburban commuters seeking a faster link to the metro to families visiting ancestral graves, Shanghai is rolling out a new kind of public bus — one that’s designed by commuters, and launched only when enough riders request it.</p><p>Branded “DZ” for <em>dingzhi</em>, or “customized,” the system invites residents to submit proposed routes through a city-run platform. Others with similar travel needs can opt in or vote, and if demand meets the threshold — typically 15 to 20 passengers per trip — the route goes live.</p><p>More than 220 DZ routes have already launched across all 16 city districts. Through an online platform opened May 8, users enter start and end points, preferred times, and trip frequency. If approved, routes can begin running in as little as three days.</p><p>One of the first test cases was DZ301, a pilot route linking a major metro station with surrounding residential blocks, schools, and office buildings. “The average daily passenger flow is 250 to 260 people — 170 to 180 during the morning peak and 70 to 80 in the evening,” Wu Yongming, deputy manager at Jiushi Bus Company,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thepaper.cn/newsDetail_forward_30436791" target="_blank">told</a>&nbsp;domestic media.</p><p>The route originated from a resident’s request submitted last December. In response, transit staff conducted on-site research, observing foot traffic, speaking with commuters, and calculating turnover times during peak hours. Drivers then ran trial runs to fine-tune the schedule before the route officially launched.</p><p>Chen Xiaohong, a professor at Tongji University’s School of Transportation, said the system builds on Shanghai’s dense transit network to better match capacity with demand, improving both convenience and resource use during peak travel.</p><p>Proposed routes appear on a “Popular Customization” page, where others can opt in to help reach the launch threshold. Group bookings can also fast-track approval. Fares are market-based, and while they follow basic public transit standards, no discounts are currently offered for students, seniors, or other groups.</p><p>Wang Yixiang, deputy director of the city’s Passenger Transport Department,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.sh.xinhuanet.com/20250509/cef13b1418e547ea93ff0ca0767de033/c.html" target="_blank">said</a>&nbsp;the new platform shortens what was once a slow, bureaucratic process for launching new routes. But he acknowledged early challenges: passenger demand is uneven, public awareness remains low, and planning still relies heavily on manual fieldwork.</p><p>“Going forward, we need to improve route planning, upgrade platform functions, and boost visibility,” Wang said.</p><p><em>(Header image: A “DZ” bus arrives at a residential area in Shanghai, 2025.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        

        
        
        <p><i>May 13, 2025</i></p>
        
        
        <div>
            <p>Every so often I come across a paper, blog post, or (occasionally) video that
completely changes how I think about a topic in programming languages and
compilers. For some of these posts, I can’t even remember how I thought about
the idea <em>before</em> reading it—it was that impactful.</p>

<p>Here are some of those posts in no particular order:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://wingolog.org/archives/2022/12/10/a-simple-semi-space-collector">a simple semi-space collector</a> by Andy Wingo brought the concept
of a Cheney/copying/compacting garbage collector from theory to practice for
me. The garbage collector core<sup id="fnref:gc-bug" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:gc-bug" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> in the post is tiny, extensible, and
can be understood in an afternoon.</li>
  <li><a href="https://pypy.org/posts/2022/07/toy-optimizer.html">Implementing a Toy Optimizer</a> by CF Bolz-Tereick changed how
I think about instruction rewrites in an optimizer. No more find-and-replace.
Instead, use a forwarding pointer! I love union-find. The whole toy optimizer
series is fantastic: each post brings something new and interesting to the
table.</li>
  <li><a href="https://pypy.org/posts/2024/08/toy-knownbits.html">A Knownbits Abstract Domain for the Toy Optimizer, Correctly</a> by
CF Bolz-Tereick is a two-for-one. It both introduced me to a new abstract
domain for optimizers and changed how I think about Z3. Before, I vaguely
knew about Z3 as this thing that can check numeric operations, kind of. The
post, however, uses Z3 as a proof engine: if Z3 can’t find a counterexample,
the code is correct<sup id="fnref:correctness" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:correctness" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>. Furthermore, it uses Z3 as a verifier <em>for
Python code</em> by using the same Python code on both Z3 objects and normal
Python objects.</li>
  <li><a href="https://cfallin.org/blog/2021/03/15/cranelift-isel-3/">Cranelift, Part 3: Correctness in Register Allocation</a> by
Chris Fallin also made proofs more accessible, but in a different way.
Instead of proving your register allocator correct on <em>all</em> inputs, prove it
correct on one input: the current code. This means that in production, you
either get a correct register allocation or a meaningful crash. Additionally,
it uses fuzzing as a state space exploration tool that can identify bugs by
making the verifier fail.</li>
  <li><a href="https://swtch.com/~rsc/regexp/regexp2.html">Regular Expression Matching: the Virtual Machine Approach</a> by Russ
Cox made regular expression engines make sense to me. In the blog post is a
small regular expression engine in under 50 lines of readable code. As a side
effect, it also made coroutines/fibers/schedulers more understandable because
its implementation of nondeterminism makes regex “threads” in user-space.</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/karpathy/micrograd">micrograd</a> by Andrej Karpathy is a tiny implementation of neural
networks with no libraries (not even NumPy). It’s how I came to understand
machine learning and even write some blog posts about it.</li>
  <li><a href="https://gist.github.com/pizlonator/cf1e72b8600b1437dda8153ea3fdb963">How I implement SSA form</a> by Fil Pizlo changed how I think about
union-find. Instead of either storing an additional pointer inside every
object or having a side-table, add an <code>Identity</code> tag that can store the
pointer. Unlike the other two approaches, this is a destructive rewrite, but
it saves space. It also introduces two new things that I am still mulling
over: Phi/Upsilon form and TBAA-style heap effects.</li>
  <li><a href="https://webkit.org/blog/10308/speculation-in-javascriptcore/">Speculation in JavaScriptCore</a> is another absolute banger
by Fil Pizlo. I learn new things every time I re-read this post, which
describes how JSC’s various optimizers work (and I guess how Fil thinks about
optimizers).</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZI198eFghJk">Modernizing Compiler Design for Carbon Toolchain</a> is a talk by
Chandler Carruth on the design of the Carbon compiler. About 29 minutes into
it Chandler sets <em>incredibly aggressive</em> compile-time budgets and explains
how the compiler is architected to fit in that time budget. At around 40
minutes, he starts explaining per-layer how this works, starting at the
lexer.</li>
  <li><a href="https://aosabook.org/en/500L/a-python-interpreter-written-in-python.html">A Python Interpreter Written in Python</a> by Allison Kaptur
made bytecode interpreters (and, specifically, how CPython works internally)
click for me.</li>
  <li><a href="https://eli.thegreenplace.net/2012/08/02/parsing-expressions-by-precedence-climbing">Parsing expressions by precedence climbing</a> by Eli
Bendersky presented an understandable and easier-to-develop alternative to
traditional hand-written recursive descent parsers. It both made parsers less
scary to me and also at the same time illustrated how precedence climbing is
the same algorithm as recursive descent but instead of having 10 different
functions with similar structure, it uses one function and a table.</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/k0kubun/ruby-jit-challenge">Ruby JIT Challenge</a> by Takashi Kokubun is a great start
to code generation and it is more general than JIT, too. In the post he also
shows off a cool approach to register allocation that I had not seen before:
fold your stack operations at compile-time to operate on a virtual stack of
physical registers.</li>
  <li><a href="https://bernsteinbear.com/assets/img/11-ghuloum.pdf">An Incremental Approach to Compiler Construction</a>
(PDF) by Abdulaziz Ghuloum brought compilers and code generation from a
mystical multi-pass beast down to an understandable single-pass form. I like
how it implements each feature end-to-end, one by one.</li>
  <li><a href="https://borretti.me/article/lessons-writing-compiler">Lessons from Writing a Compiler</a> by Fernando Borretti puts
into words this stripey implementation strategy in the first section, which
is really neat.</li>
  <li><a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3434304">egg: Fast and extensible equality saturation</a> by [multiple authors]
changed how I think about optimizers and pass ordering. Why <em>not</em> just
generate the compressed hypergraph of all possible versions of an expression
and then pick the “best” one? I mean, there are a couple of reasons, but it
was mind-expanding.</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/rfcs/blob/main/accepted/cranelift-egraph.md">Cranelift: Using E-Graphs for Verified, Cooperating Middle-End
Optimizations</a> by Chris Fallin showed that e-graphs are
workable and remarkably effective in a production compiler, even if you don’t
do the “full shebang”.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.philipzucker.com/smart_constructor_aegraph/">Acyclic Egraphs and Smart Constructors</a> by Phil Zucker further
explores acyclic egraphs in the small. This one was a slow burn: I read it
when it came out, didn’t really get it, and then months later it clicked
more. I’m sure that in a few months it’ll click again.</li>
  <li><a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/ProgrammingLanguages/comments/mrifdr/treewalking_interpreters_and_cachelocality/gumsi2v/">This Reddit comment</a> by Bob Nystrom and <a href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~asampson/blog/flattening.html">Flattening
ASTs</a> by Adrian Sampson are a double whammy that led to two
things: 1) AST storage can be really compact, almost like bytecode 2) a
really interesting discussion on Mastodon about massively-parallel lock-free
abstract interpretation if IRs were stored like this. This (and some off-hand
comments by Cliff Click about bump-allocation only taking “a few clocks”)
changed how I think about allocating and referring to IR nodes.</li>
</ul>

<p>I hope you enjoy the readings!</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="content">
            

<p>2025, May 13</p>
<hr>
<h2>Preface</h2>
<ul>
<li>A "take-home assignment" in the world of Software Developer interviews, is a challenge sent to candidates for them to implement a code solution that solves the challenge.</li>
<li>In this blog post I describe my experience doing a "take-home assignment" for a company that I deemed reputable, and I hope to shine some light on the absurdity of this practice. I will show you what kind of requirements are asked of candidates, for free, without any remorse towards wasting their time.</li>
</ul>
<h2>I am searching for a job, so I sent my CV</h2>
<p>I sent my CV for a role at Kagi Search, the description of the role can be found here:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://archive.md/tRsED">https://archive.md/tRsED</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The summary in that link would be:</p>
<pre><code>Requirements

- Proven experience in building backend systems
- Proficiency in Go
- Strong understanding of scaling and maintaining backend systems
- Ability to collaborate effectively with SREs and other team members.
- Solid understanding of containerization technologies like Docker
</code></pre>
<h2>My application was answered</h2>
<p>So I got an email, saying that I was selected for a take-home assignment. Something like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thank you for your interest in working at Kagi. We were impressed by your application and would like to move forward with the next stage of our selection process.</p>
<p>As part of our evaluation, we'd like you to complete the Kagi Developer Assessment that will showcase your skills and approach to problem-solving.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It can be found in the following URL:&nbsp; <a href="https://hackmd.io/@antonios/SkeEpQeh1l">https://hackmd.io/@antonios/SkeEpQeh1l</a>
Once you complete it, please reach out and we'll review it and, if successful, invite you for a follow-up interview where we'll discuss your approach and solution in detail.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The URL for the take-home is archived here: <a href="https://archive.md/A95Ju">https://archive.md/A95Ju</a>. I copy-pasted the requirements into the next paragraph so you don't have to open the link.</p>
<h2>The take-home</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>The project is to build a minimal, terminal-inspired email client, with the following requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Email client can either be in the terminal (i.e. a TUI) or a web app</li>
<li>Should have basic email viewing + sending functionality</li>
<li>Can use a fake backend (DB, in-memory, etc) or real IMAP/POP/JMAP/etc backend</li>
<li>Does <strong>not</strong> have to handle rich text messages, just plaintext</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>This project tests your ability not only to code, but to deal with ambiguity and open-endedness, which is essential in R&amp;D projects like Kagi Labs.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Do the project in a way that shows off your skills as a developer</li>
<li>Deliverable is the completed project, in a GitHub repo and deployed anywhere so we can easily test it.</li>
<li>Create a README file with setup instructions</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>And don't hesitate to tell us if you have any questions!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These instructions are extremely broad, and the size of the project is quite large too.</p>
<p>Usually I turn down these kind of unpaid homework, but I had heard about Kagi Search as a reputable company, so I got rid of my inhibitions and bit the bullet.</p>
<h2>Communication with Hiring Manager</h2>
<p>Because the instructions are so broad, I proceeded to deliver some questions over email to the Hiring Manager. I got answers such as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We always have a lot of candidates, some they do the basic, some provide a lot of extra features, great documentation and decision making explanations, deployment for demoing, and future thoughts on what would be next. From hiring point of view, we prefer stronger assessments.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>to which I asked:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> What <strong>kind</strong> of extra feature do you value highly?  <strong>'kind</strong>' meaning something like '<strong>UX improvement</strong>', or '<strong>pretty UI</strong>', or '<strong>privacy related</strong>', or '<strong>something that showcases a lot of complexity</strong>'.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>to which he replied:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>That is part of the assessment itself, see what kind of extra features you can come up if any.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>.... that's very little information to work with, so I came up with a strategy. I would write an implementation plan detailing the entire deliverable before actually writing the code, if my proposal is accepted that means it should be good enough to get a phone interview, maybe even an offer, right? Nope. Despite my efforts to agree on all these terms on email before investing an entire week of full-time effort, it seems none of my efforts meant anything to the Hiring Manager.</p>
<h2>My proposal</h2>
<p>A summary of my proposal is as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A webapp with golang accessible online, deployed through AWS using ECS Fargate, with SSL (https), integrated with an email sender provider, with authentication through a login screen, with the ability to send emails through a form, and displaying incoming emails in the user interface.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Below I include the email that I sent to the manager with the detailed proposal, this is a long one, so scroll down to the next header if you prefer:</p>
<hr>
<p>Hi Antonio De Dios,</p>
<p>It is me again :)</p>
<p>I hope it is ok that I keep sending you emails, it's just that I am taking the assessment very seriously.</p>
<p>I have done a little research and I want to offer a proposal of features for the <strong>deliverable</strong>. I also want to ask for a bit more time, as this is the first day in which I found time for the project, and this weekend I will not be available to work on it.</p>
<p>So here is my proposal:</p>
<p><strong>Delivery date: Sunday EOD March 30,</strong></p>
<p>This is two business days later than the two-week mark since you sent me your first email.</p>
<p><strong>Deliverable:</strong></p>
<p>Email client, deployed to "the cloud" (AWS), sends and receives emails through an email provider such as Postmark, written in Golang with a web UI, leveraging APIs and libraries to work efficiently.</p>
<p><strong>Reasoning:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Even though this is a backend role, adding a web frontend displays a breadth of knowledge about web technology that remains relevant for backend development. The solution will also include a database, a classic piece of backend roles.</li>
<li>Deploying to AWS with Infra-as-Code tooling, not part of the assessment requirements, but most definitely relevant to the job description due to: IaC tooling, Docker tooling, networking concepts, resiliency. Additionally, this makes it much easier to look at the final result, as opposed to locally building some code. And the infra implementation makes for good interview conversation.</li>
<li>Using an email service such as Postmark simplifies the stack without sacrificing functionality. This kind of implementation remains relevant for many real-world applications for various reasons, such as protecting senders from bounced emails. It is also relevant in the sense that integrating APIs is the bread-and-butter of backend development.</li>
<li>While writing the solution in Golang makes it relevant to the job, I will also pick a combination of Golang libraries and frameworks to deliver the result in an efficient manner.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Specs:</strong></p>
<p>These are the implementation details that I have settled on using for this given solution:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>For the Golang backend I will be using the following libraries:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://pocketbase.io/">Pocketbase</a>, a backend framework that leverages SQLite as the database.</li>
<li><a href="https://templ.guide/">TEMPL</a>, an HTML templating library for golang. This keeps the work on the backend, which helps with speed and avoids going into too much frontend, which would be more relevant for a frontend role (avoids SPA/JavaScript).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>For the Infra-as-code I will use <a href="https://www.pulumi.com/">Pulumi</a>. For Pulumi I will use the TypeScript SDK because it offers the most brevity in configuration.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For the Email Service Provider, I will use <a href="https://postmarkapp.com/">Postmark</a>, this allows me to manage email easily with the usage of Postmark's API and my own database. This circumvents the usage of IMAP/POP, whilst useful standard protocols, a lot of complexity is involved in integrating them properly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The UI will be kept simple, showing pagination for sent and received emails. In addition to the requirements of the assessment, there will be a login screen and two accounts will be provided for the demo.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Stretch goals:</strong>
These are goals which I would like to meet, but I cannot promise due to the time constraint:</p>
<ul>
<li>Backups and resiliency:
<ul>
<li>In the scenario of the service going offline for whatever reason, it would be great if the service is restarted without losing data.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>CONCLUSION</strong></p>
<p>This is my proposal for the assessment. Coming up with the proposal has taken me some time and I would like to know what kind of response I could expect from Kagi if I drive it to completion. Looking forward to your answer!</p>
<p>Kind regards,</p>
<p>Jose</p>
<hr>
<p>That is where my email ends.</p>
<h2>The Hiring Manager's answer to my proposal</h2>
<p>The answer was so low effort, that it should have given me a clue as to the lack of seriousness from the manager, but I tried to view it in a positive light. I realize now, I am naive. So this was the reply I got:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hi Jose,&nbsp;
This is all very exciting. Looking forward to receiving your submission.
Thanks for keeping me updated.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You will notice that my question went completely ignored. I asked:</p>
<ul>
<li>"I would like to know what kind of response I could expect from Kagi if I drive it to completion."</li>
</ul>
<p>All I got was:</p>
<ul>
<li>"This is all very exciting"</li>
</ul>
<p>Still, this is somewhat of a positive answer, correct? Well, I would have much rather preferred if my proposal had been rejected right there, and my time had been respected.</p>
<p>After all, this is plenty of information to determine whether the solution will be good enough to move me forward into a role.</p>
<h2>My solution</h2>
<p>I delivered on all promises. It took me an entire week of full-time effort. This is an extreme commitment from my side, but I assumed that nailing the take-home would put me very close to a good job.</p>
<p>If you want to look at a demo of the web application, use this youtube link:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://youtu.be/yY1sVXMkP_o">https://youtu.be/yY1sVXMkP_o</a></li>
</ul>
<p>If you want to look at the code for the solution, with very extensive documentation, use this GitHub link:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/Sleepful/mymail">https://github.com/Sleepful/mymail</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>The rejection email</h2>
<p>After getting an automated rejection email, I asked for feedback, to which I got this email:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We normally don’t provide feedback at this stage.&nbsp;
We have had other submissions that were simpler and stronger, &nbsp;so we decided to continue forward with these candidates.&nbsp;
We receive a lot of interest and applications for each position at Kagi which makes selection processes is extremely competitive.
We value you as a user and as job candidate and would like to invite you to keep an eye on future positions and continue applying.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Really?</p>
<ol>
<li>If he wanted a simpler solution, he could have told me on <em><strong>March 18</strong></em>, when I submit my proposal.</li>
<li>If my solution was weak for the role, he could have told me on <em><strong>March 18</strong></em>, also when I submit my proposal. There is no way the judgement changed between the proposal submission and <em><strong>March 31</strong></em>, when I submitted the deliverable deployed for demoing.</li>
<li>It is <em><strong>May 13</strong></em> right now, a month and a half after I got rejected and the job advertisement is still up. I understand that companies are using the same advertisement to fill multiple roles, but clearly this isn't some kind of competition where the winner seats are taken, they are still advertising the seats and it is anyone's guess how many people have gone through the same trick for an imaginary prize.</li>
<li>The original project instructions mentioned that deploying the project for demoing would be nice, but not a required step. After I made my submission, the instructions changed to make it a strict requirement for the project to be deployed. So it is funny that my project is so weak, yet it made them update the guidelines to something stricter. Go figure.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Concluding thoughts</h2>
<p>This is sad for all applicants as a whole, many whom are unemployed and are on a timer towards bankruptcy. Imagine if you were unemployed, your savings are only going to last you so long, and companies demand that you spend the little time you have left on unpaid work. But what choice do we have once we are in a desperate position? Perhaps next time I am asked for one of these unpaid assignments I will link them to this blog, although you have to understand that if someone is going hungry or facing eviction, they don't have much choice in the matter.</p>
<h2>Can we have better selection processes?</h2>
<p>I definitely believe that we can. I also dislike leetcode-style interviews, the programming puzzles that require the candidate to solve a problem during a video-call. This week I failed a "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Change-making_problem">coin change</a>" problem, well I passed about half of the tests in less than 50 minutes, but I did not have enough time to implement the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backtracking">backtracking</a> part of the solution with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clojure">Clojure</a>, a programming language that I learned as a hobby and also spent an entire week practicing for this Clojure-based role.</p>
<p>Are there no other options? Of course there are. One such example would be to do a live code review. This could be done asynchronously or synchronously. It could allow actually talking through topics and issues that relate to the challenges in a real software project. This would allow to surface much more of the knowledge in an experienced software engineer. As opposed to the leetcode-style interviews which select for people that memorized some canned leetcode problem well enough to be really efficient at writing the exact code to solve it.</p>
<p>I am not completely against live coding, it is a tool to determine basic coding literacy, but does it make someone a better programmer if they can solve <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knapsack_problem">knapsack</a> in 50 minutes instead of 2 hours? Heck, I don't think it matters if someone takes longer solving it. Solving these code puzzles under a timer is far removed from the day-to-day responsibilities of an engineer working on an old or new software product.</p>
<p>Lets do better, and please, unless you are in a desperate position, start rejecting roles that ask for this kind of unpaid work. Make it so that they lose all the top talent.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

	  <p>Sometimes it takes a kid to ask a question no one has considered before.</p>


			

<p>A couple of years ago, Binghamton University Associate Professor <a href="https://www.binghamton.edu/biomedical-engineering/people/profile.html?id=ggerman">Guy German</a> published research about why human skin wrinkles when you stay in the water too long. Received wisdom held that the water swelled your skin and made your fingers wrinkly, but little to no research had been done to prove that.</p>

<p>What German and his team at the Biological Soft Matter Mechanics Laboratory found is that blood vessels beneath the skin actually contract after prolonged immersion, and that’s where the wrinkles come from.</p>

<p><a href="https://theconversation.com/why-do-fingers-get-wrinkly-after-a-long-bath-or-swim-a-biomedical-engineer-explains-204726" target="_blank">He wrote about the research for The Conversation</a> — a nonprofit news organization that asks academics to share their expertise on current topics — as part of its Curious Kids feature. One of the follow-up questions stumped him, though.</p>

<p>“A student asked, ‘Yeah, but do the wrinkles always form in the same way?’ And I thought: I haven’t the foggiest clue!” said German, a faculty member at the <a href="https://www.binghamton.edu/watson">Thomas J. Watson College of Engineering and Applied Science</a>’s <a href="https://www.binghamton.edu/biomedical-engineering">Department of Biomedical Engineering</a>. “So it led to this research to find out.”</p>

<p>In <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1751616125000517?via%3Dihub" target="_blank">a paper recently published in the <i>Journal of the Mechanical Behavior of Biomedical Materials</i></a>, German and Rachel Laytin ’23, MS ’24, show that, yes, the topography patterns remain constant after multiple immersions.</p>

<p>“Blood vessels don’t change their position much — they move around a bit, but in relation to other blood vessels, they’re pretty static,” German said. “That means the wrinkles should form in the same manner, and we proved that they do.”</p>

<p>The research put subjects’ fingers in water for 30 minutes, taking photos and then repeating the immersion under the same conditions at least 24 hours later. By comparing the images, German and Laytin found the same patterns of raised loops and ridges after both immersions.</p>

<p>They also made an interesting side discovery: “We’ve heard that wrinkles don’t form in people who have median nerve damage in their fingers,” German said. “One of my students told us, ‘I’ve got median nerve damage in my fingers.’ So we tested him — no wrinkles!”<b> </b></p>

<p>As much fun as it was to figure out something a child asked, the research also could have real-world applications in forensics, such as fingerprinting at crime scenes and identifying bodies found after prolonged water exposure. German’s father, a retired U.K. police officer, faced some of these challenges during his law enforcement career.<b> </b></p>

<p>“Biometrics and fingerprints are built into my brain,” he said. “I always think about this sort of stuff, because it’s fascinating.”</p>



<p>German is eager to further explore questions about skin immersion with his students: “I feel like a kid in a candy store, because there’s so much science here that I don’t know. We thank the people at The Conversation and the wonderful question they asked us, because it does create cool new science.”</p>	  <!-- 126 <p>Research shows fingers wrinkle the same way with every water immersion</p> -->

            <guid>43978435</guid>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://corrode.dev/blog/flattening-rusts-learning-curve/">https://corrode.dev/blog/flattening-rusts-learning-curve/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43978435">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    

      <p>I see people make the same mistakes over and over again when learning Rust.
Here are my thoughts (ordered by importance) on how you can ease the learning process.
My goal is to help you save time and frustration.</p>
<h2 id="let-your-guard-down"><a href="#let-your-guard-down" aria-label="Anchor link for: let-your-guard-down">Let Your Guard Down</a></h2>
<p>Stop resisting. That’s the most important lesson.</p>
<p>Accept that learning Rust requires adopting a completely different mental model than what you’re used to.
There are a ton of new concepts to learn like lifetimes, ownership, and the trait system.
And depending on your background, you’ll need to add generics, pattern matching, or macros to the list.</p>
<p>Your learning pace doesn’t have much to do with whether you’re smart or not or if you have a lot of programming experience.
Instead, what matters more is <strong>your attitude toward the language</strong>.</p>
<p>I have seen junior devs excel at Rust with no prior training and senior engineers struggle for weeks/months or even give up entirely. Leave your hubris at home.</p>
<p>Treat the borrow checker as a co-author, not an adversary. This reframes the relationship.
Let the compiler do the teaching: for example, this works great with lifetimes, because the compiler will tell you when a lifetime is ambiguous.
Then just add it but take the time to reason about <em>why</em> the compiler couldn’t figure it out itself.</p>
<pre data-lang="rust"><code data-lang="rust"><span><span><span><span>fn</span> </span><span>longest</span></span><span><span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>:</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>str</span>, <span>y</span><span>:</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>str</span></span><span><span><span>)</span></span></span></span><span> <span><span>-&gt;</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>str</span></span> </span><span><span><span>{</span>
</span></span></span><span><span><span>    <span>if</span> x<span>.</span><span>len</span><span><span>(</span></span><span><span>)</span></span> <span>&gt;</span> y<span>.</span><span>len</span><span><span>(</span></span><span><span>)</span></span> <span><span>{</span>
</span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span>        x
</span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span>    </span><span><span>}</span></span> <span>else</span> <span><span>{</span>
</span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span>        y
</span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span>    </span><span><span>}</span></span>
</span></span></span><span><span><span></span><span><span>}</span></span></span>
</span></code></pre>
<p>If you try to compile this, the compiler will ask you to add a lifetime parameter.
It provides this helpful suggestion:</p>
<pre data-lang="rust"><code data-lang="rust"><span><span>1</span> <span>|</span> <span><span><span>fn</span> </span><span>longest</span></span><span><span>&lt;</span><span>'a</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span><span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>:</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>'a</span> <span>str</span>, <span>y</span><span>:</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>'a</span> <span>str</span></span><span><span><span>)</span></span></span></span><span> <span><span>-&gt;</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>'a</span> <span>str</span></span> </span><span><span><span>{</span>
</span></span></span><span><span><span>  <span>|</span>           <span>+</span><span>+</span><span>+</span><span>+</span>     <span>+</span><span>+</span>          <span>+</span><span>+</span>          <span>+</span><span>+</span>
</span></span></span></code></pre>
<p>So you don’t have to guess what the compiler wants and can follow its instructions.
But also sit down and wonder <em>why</em> the compiler couldn’t figure it out itself.</p>
<p>Most of the time when fighting the compiler it is actually exposing a design flaw.
Similarly, if your code gets overly verbose or looks ugly, there’s probably a better way.
Declare defeat and learn to do it the Rust way.</p>
<p>If you come from a dynamic language like Python, you’ll find that Rust is more verbose in general.
Most of it just comes from type annotations, though.
Some people might dismiss Rust as being “unelegant” or “ugly”, but the verbosity actually serves a good purpose and is immensely helpful for building large-scale applications:</p>
<ul>
<li>First off, you will read the code more often than you write it,
which means type annotations will give you more local context to reason with.</li>
<li>Second, it helps immensely with refactoring because the compiler can check if you broke any code while you move things around.
If your code turns out to look very ugly, take a step back and ask if there’s a simpler solution.
Don’t dismiss the language right away.</li>
</ul>
<p>Turn on all <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/clippy/">clippy lints</a> on day one – even the pedantic ones.
Run the linter and follow the suggestions religiously.
Don’t skip that step once your program compiles.</p>
<p>Resistance is futile.
The longer you refuse to learn, the longer you will suffer;
but the moment you let your guard down is the moment you’ll start to learn.
Forget what you think you knew about programming and really start to listen to what the compiler, the standard library, and clippy are trying to tell you.</p>
<h2 id="baby-steps"><a href="#baby-steps" aria-label="Anchor link for: baby-steps">Baby Steps</a></h2>
<p>I certainly tried to run before I could walk.
That alone cost me a lot of precious time.</p>
<p>Don’t make it too hard on yourself in the beginning.
Here are some tips:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use <code>String</code> and <code>clone()</code> and <code>unwrap</code> generously; you can always refactor later – and refactoring is the best part about Rust!
I wrote an article on saving yourself time during that phase <a href="https://corrode.dev/blog/prototyping">here</a>.</li>
<li>Use simple if or match statements before starting to learn some of the more idiomatic <code>.and_then</code> etc. combinators</li>
<li>Avoid async Rust in week 1. The additional rules are a tax on people still learning the core ownership model.</li>
</ul>
<p>Don’t introduce too many new concepts at the same time!
Instead, while you learn about a new concept, have an editor open and write out a few examples.
What helped was to just write some code in the <a href="https://play.rust-lang.org/">Rust playground</a> and try to get it to compile. Write super small snippets (e.g., one <code>main.rs</code> for one concept) instead of using one big “tutorial” repo.
Get into the habit of throwing most of your code away.</p>
<p>I still do that and test out ideas in the playground or when I brainstorm with clients.</p>
<p>For instance, here’s one of my favorite code snippets to explain the concept of ownership:</p>
<pre data-lang="rust"><code data-lang="rust"><span><span><span><span>fn</span> </span><span>my_func</span></span><span><span><span>(</span><span>v</span><span>:</span> String</span><span><span><span>)</span></span></span></span><span> </span><span><span><span>{</span>
</span></span></span><span><span><span>    <span> do something with v
</span></span></span></span><span><span><span></span><span><span>}</span></span></span>
</span><span>
</span><span><span><span><span>fn</span> </span><span>main</span></span><span><span><span>(</span></span><span><span><span>)</span></span></span></span><span> </span><span><span><span>{</span>
</span></span></span><span><span><span>    <span>let</span> s <span>=</span> <span>String</span><span><span>::</span></span>from<span><span>(</span><span><span>"</span>hello<span>"</span></span></span><span><span>)</span></span><span>;</span>
</span></span></span><span><span><span>    <span>my_func</span><span><span>(</span>s</span><span><span>)</span></span><span>;</span>
</span></span></span><span><span><span>    <span>my_func</span><span><span>(</span>s</span><span><span>)</span></span><span>;</span> <span> error, but why?
</span></span></span></span><span><span><span></span><span><span>}</span></span></span>
</span></code></pre>
<p>Can you fix it?
Can you explain it?
Ask yourself what would change if <code>v</code> was an <code>i32</code>.</p>
<p>If Rust code looks scary to you, <strong>break it down</strong>.
Write your own, simpler version, then slowly increase the complexity.
Rust is easier to write than to read.
By writing lots of Rust, you will also learn how to read it better as well.</p>
<h2 id="be-accurate"><a href="#be-accurate" aria-label="Anchor link for: be-accurate">Be Accurate</a></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>How you do anything is how you do everything.
– An ancient Rust proverb</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can be sloppy in other languages, but not in Rust.
That means you have to be accurate while you code or the code just won’t compile.
The expectation is that this approach will save you debugging time in the future.</p>
<p>I found that the people who learn Rust the fastest all have great attention to detail.
If you try to just get things done and move on, you will have a harder time than if you aim to do things right on your first try.
You will have a much better time if you re-read your code to fix stupid typos before pressing “compile.”
Also build a habit of automatically adding <code>&amp;</code> and <code>mut</code> where necessary as you go.</p>
<p>A good example of someone who thinks about these details while coding is
Tsoding. For example, watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0KIDIOL_i4">this stream where he builds a search engine in Rust from scratch</a> to see what I mean.
I think you can learn this skill as long as you’re putting in your best effort and give it some time.</p>
<h2 id="don-t-cheat"><a href="#don-t-cheat" aria-label="Anchor link for: don-t-cheat">Don’t Cheat</a></h2>
<p>With today’s tooling it is very easy to offload the bulk of the work to the computer.
Initially, it will feel like you’re making quick progress, but in reality, you just strengthen bad habits in your workflow.
If you can’t explain what you wrote to someone else or if you don’t know about the tradeoffs/assumptions a part of your code makes,
you took it too far.</p>
<p>Often, this approach stems from a fear that you’re not making progress fast enough.
But you don’t have to prove to someone else that you’re clever enough to pick up Rust very quickly.</p>
<h4 id="walk-the-walk"><a href="#walk-the-walk" aria-label="Anchor link for: walk-the-walk">Walk the Walk</a></h4>
<p>To properly learn Rust you actually have to write a lot of code by hand.
Don’t be a lurker on Reddit, reading through other people’s success stories.
Have some skin in the game!
Put in the hours because there is no silver bullet.
Once it works, consider open sourcing your code even if you know it’s not perfect.</p>
<h4 id="don-t-go-on-auto-pilot"><a href="#don-t-go-on-auto-pilot" aria-label="Anchor link for: don-t-go-on-auto-pilot">Don’t Go on Auto-Pilot</a></h4>
<p>LLMs are like driving a car on auto-pilot.
It’s comfortable at first, but you won’t feel in control and slowly, that uneasy feeling will creep in.
Turn off the autopilot while learning.</p>
<p>A quick way to set you up for success is to learn by writing code in the Rust Playground first.
Don’t use LLMs or code completion. Just type it out!
If you can’t, that means you haven’t fully internalized a concept yet.
That’s fine!
Go to the standard library and read the docs.
Take however long it takes and then come back and try again.</p>
<p>Slow is steady and steady is fast.</p>
<h4 id="build-muscle-memory"><a href="#build-muscle-memory" aria-label="Anchor link for: build-muscle-memory">Build Muscle Memory</a></h4>
<p>Muscle memory in programming is highly underrated.
People will tell you that this is what code completion is for, but I believe it’s a requirement to reach a state of flow:
if you constantly blunder over syntax errors or, worse, just wait for the next auto-completion to make progress,
that is a terrible developer experience.</p>
<p>When writing manually, you will make more mistakes.
Embrace them!
These mistakes will help you learn to understand the compiler output.
You will get a “feeling” for how the output looks in different error scenarios.
Don’t gloss over these errors.
Over time you will develop an intuition about what feels “rustic.”</p>
<h4 id="predict-the-output"><a href="#predict-the-output" aria-label="Anchor link for: predict-the-output">Predict The Output</a></h4>
<p>Another thing I like to do is to run “prediction exercises” where I guess if code will compile before running it.
This builds intuition.
Try to make every program free of syntax errors before you run it.
Don’t be sloppy.
Of course, you won’t always succeed, but you will get much better at it over time.</p>
<h4 id="try-to-solve-problems-yourself-only-then-look-up-the-solution"><a href="#try-to-solve-problems-yourself-only-then-look-up-the-solution" aria-label="Anchor link for: try-to-solve-problems-yourself-only-then-look-up-the-solution">Try To Solve Problems Yourself, Only <em>Then</em> Look Up The Solution.</a></h4>
<p>Read lots of other people’s code. I recommend <a href="https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep"><code>ripgrep</code></a>, for example,
which is some of the best Rust code out there.</p>

<p>Don’t be afraid to get your hands dirty.
Which areas of Rust do you avoid?
What do you run away from?
Focus on that.
Tackle your blind spots.
Track your common “escape hatches” (unsafe, clone, etc.) to identify your current weaknesses.
For example, if you are scared of proc macros, write a bunch of them.</p>
<h4 id="break-your-code"><a href="#break-your-code" aria-label="Anchor link for: break-your-code">Break Your Code</a></h4>
<p>After you’re done with an exercise, break it! See what the compiler says.
See if you can explain what happens.</p>
<h4 id="don-t-use-other-people-s-crates-while-learning"><a href="#don-t-use-other-people-s-crates-while-learning" aria-label="Anchor link for: don-t-use-other-people-s-crates-while-learning">Don’t Use Other People’s Crates While Learning</a></h4>
<p>A poor personal version is better than a perfect external crate (at least while learning).
Write some small library code yourself as an exercise.
Notable exceptions are probably <code>serde</code> and <code>anyhow</code>, which can save you time dealing with JSON inputs and setting up error handling that you can spend on other tasks
as long as you know how they work.</p>
<h2 id="build-good-intuitions"><a href="#build-good-intuitions" aria-label="Anchor link for: build-good-intuitions">Build Good Intuitions</a></h2>
<p>Concepts like lifetimes are hard to grasp.
Sometimes it helps to draw how data moves through your system.
Develop a habit to explain concepts to yourself and others through drawing.
I’m not sure, but I think this works best for “visual”/creative people (in comparison to highly analytical people).</p>
<p>I personally use <a href="https://excalidraw.com/">excalidraw</a> for drawing.
It has a “comicy” feel, which takes the edge off a bit.
The implication is that it doesn’t feel highly accurate, but rather serves as a rough sketch.
Many good engineers (as well as great Mathematicians and Physicists) are able to visualize concepts with sketches.</p>
<p>In Rust, sketches can help to visualize lifetimes and ownership of data or for architecture diagrams.</p>
<h2 id="build-on-top-of-what-you-already-know"><a href="#build-on-top-of-what-you-already-know" aria-label="Anchor link for: build-on-top-of-what-you-already-know">Build On Top Of What You Already Know</a></h2>
<p>Earlier I said you should forget everything you know about programming.
How can I claim now that you should build on top of what you already know?</p>
<p>What I meant is that Rust is the most different in familiar areas like control flow handling and value passing.
E.g., mutability is very explicit in Rust and calling a function typically “moves” its arguments.
That’s where you have to accept that Rust is just <em>different</em> and learn from <em>first principles</em>.</p>
<p>However, it is okay to map Rust concepts to other languages you already know.
For instance, “a trait is a bit like an interface” is wrong, but it is a good starting point
to understand the concept.</p>
<p>Here are a few more examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>“A struct is like a class (minus the inheritance)”</li>
<li>“A closure is like a lambda function (but it can capture variables)”</li>
<li>“A module is like a namespace (but more powerful)”</li>
<li>“A borrow is like a pointer (but with single owner).”</li>
</ul>
<p>And if you have a functional background, it might be:</p>
<ul>
<li>“<code>Option</code> is like the <code>Maybe</code> monad”</li>
<li>“Traits are like type-classes”</li>
<li>“Enums are algebraic data types”</li>
</ul>
<p>The idea is that mapping concepts helps fill in the gaps more quickly.</p>
<p>Map what you already know from another language (e.g., Python, TypeScript) to Rust concepts.
As long as you know that there are subtle differences, I think it’s helpful.</p>
<p>I don’t see people mention this a lot, but I believe that <a href="https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Rosetta_Code">Rosetta Code</a> is a great resource for that.
You basically browse their list of tasks, pick one you like and start comparing the Rust solution with the language you’re strongest in.</p>
<p>Also, port code from a language you know to Rust.
This way, you don’t have to learn a new domain at the same time as you learn Rust.
You can build on your existing knowledge and experience.</p>
<ul>
<li>Translate common language idioms from your strongest language to Rust. E.g., how would you convert a list comprehension from Python to Rust?
Try it first, then look for resources, which explain the concept in Rust. For instance, <a href="https://corrode.dev/blog/iterators">I wrote one</a> on this topic specifically.</li>
<li>I know people who have a few standard exercises that they port to every new language they learn.
For example, that could be a ray-tracer, a sorting algorithm, or a small web app.</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, find other people who come from the same background as you.
Read their blogs where they talk about their experiences learning Rust.
Write down your experiences as well.</p>
<h2 id="don-t-guess"><a href="#don-t-guess" aria-label="Anchor link for: don-t-guess">Don’t Guess</a></h2>
<p>I find that people who tend to <em>guess</em> their way through challenges
often have the hardest time learning Rust.</p>
<p>In Rust, the details are everything.
Don’t gloss over details, because they always reveal some wisdom about the task at hand.
Even if you don’t care about the details, they will come back to bite you later.</p>
<p>For instance, why do you have to call <code>to_string()</code> on a thing that’s already a string?</p>
<pre data-lang="rust"><code data-lang="rust"><span><span>my_func</span><span><span>(</span><span><span>"</span>hello<span>"</span></span><span>.</span><span>to_string</span><span><span>(</span></span><span><span>)</span></span></span><span><span>)</span></span>
</span></code></pre>
<p>Those stumbling blocks are learning opportunities.
It might look like a waste of time to ask these questions and means that it will take longer to finish a task,
but it will pay off in the long run.</p>
<p>Reeeeeally read the error messages the compiler prints.
Everyone thinks they do this, but time and again I see people look confused while the solution is right there in their terminal.
There are <code>hints</code> as well; don’t ignore those.
This alone will save you sooo much time.
Thank me later.</p>
<p>You might say that is true for every language, and you’d be right.
But in Rust, the error messages are actually worth your time.
Some of them are like small meditations: opportunities to think about the problem at a deeper level.</p>
<p>If you get any borrow-checker errors, refuse the urge to guess what’s going on.
Instead of guessing, <em>walk through the data flow by hand</em> (who owns what and when).
Try to think it through for yourself and only try to compile again once you understand the problem.</p>
<h2 id="lean-on-type-driven-development"><a href="#lean-on-type-driven-development" aria-label="Anchor link for: lean-on-type-driven-development">Lean on Type-Driven Development</a></h2>
<p>The key to good Rust code is through its type system.</p>
<p>It’s <strong>all</strong> in the type system.
Everything you need is hidden in plain sight.
But often, people skip too much of the documentation and just look at the examples.</p>
<p>What few people do is <em>read the actual function documentation</em>.
You can even click through the standard library all the way to the source code to read the thing they are using.
There is no magic (and that’s what’s so magical about it).</p>
<p>You can do that in Rust much better than in most other languages.
That’s because Python for example is written in C, which requires you to cross that language boundary to learn what’s going on.
Similarly, the C++ standard library isn’t a single, standardized implementation, but rather has several different implementations maintained by different organizations.
That makes it super hard to know <em>what exactly is going on</em>.
In Rust, the source code is available right inside the documentation. Make good use of that!</p>
<p>Function signatures tell a lot!
The sooner you will embrace this additional information, the quicker you will be off to the races with Rust.
If you have the time, read interesting parts of the standard library docs.
Even after years, I always learn something when I do.</p>
<p>Try to model your own projects with types first.
This is when you start to have way more fun with the language.
It feels like you have a conversation with the compiler about the problem you’re trying to solve.</p>
<p>For example, once you learn how concepts like expressions, iterators and traits fit together,
you can write more concise, readable code.</p>
<p>Once you learn how to encode invariants in types, you can write more correct code
that you don’t have to run to test. Instead, you can’t compile incorrect code in the first place.</p>
<p>Learn Rust through “type-driven development” and let the compiler errors guide your design.</p>

<p>Before you start, shop around for resources that fit your personal learning style.
To be honest, there is not that much good stuff out there yet.
On the plus side, it doesn’t take too long to go through the list of resources
<em>before</em> settling on one specific platform/book/course.
The right resource depends on what learner you are.
In the long run, finding the right resource saves you time because you will learn quicker.</p>
<p>I personally don’t like doing toy exercises that others have built out for me.
That’s why I don’t like Rustlings too much; the exercises are not “fun” and too theoretical. I want more practical exercises.
I found that <a href="https://projecteuler.net/">Project Euler</a> or <a href="https://adventofcode.com/">Advent of Code</a> work way better for me.
The question comes up quite often, so I wrote a blog post about <a href="https://corrode.dev/blog/rust-learning-resources-2025">my favorite Rust learning resources</a>.</p>
<h4 id="don-t-just-watch-youtube"><a href="#don-t-just-watch-youtube" aria-label="Anchor link for: don-t-just-watch-youtube">Don’t Just Watch YouTube</a></h4>
<p>I like to watch YouTube, but exclusively for recreational purposes.
In my opinion, watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/theprimeagen">ThePrimeagen</a> is for entertainment only.
He’s an amazing programmer, but trying to learn how to program by watching someone else do it is like trying to learn how to become a great athlete by watching the Olympics.
Similarly, I think we all can agree that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/JonGjengset">Jon Gjengset</a> is an exceptional programmer and teacher, but watching him might be overwhelming
if you’re just starting out. (Love the content though!)</p>
<p>Same goes for conference talks or podcasts: they are great for context, and for soft-skills, but not for learning Rust.</p>
<p>Instead, invest in a good book if you can.
Books are not yet outdated and you can read them offline, add personal notes, type out the code yourself and get a
“spatial overview” of the depth of the content by flipping through the pages.</p>
<p>Similarly, if you’re serious about using Rust professionally, buy a course or get your boss to invest in a trainer.
Of course, I’m super biased here as I run a Rust consultancy, but I truly believe that it will save you and your company countless
hours and will set you up for long-term success. Think about it: you will work with this codebase for years to come. Better make that experience a pleasant one.
A good trainer, just like a good teacher, will not go through the Rust book with you, but watch you program Rust in the wild and give you personalized feedback about your weak spots.</p>
<h2 id="find-a-coding-buddy"><a href="#find-a-coding-buddy" aria-label="Anchor link for: find-a-coding-buddy">Find A Coding Buddy</a></h2>
<p>“Shadow” more experienced team members or friends.</p>
<p>Don’t be afraid to ask for a code review on Mastodon or the <a href="https://users.rust-lang.org/">Rust forum</a> and return the favor and do code reviews there yourself.
Take on opportunities for pair programming.</p>
<h4 id="explain-rust-code-to-non-rust-developers"><a href="#explain-rust-code-to-non-rust-developers" aria-label="Anchor link for: explain-rust-code-to-non-rust-developers">Explain Rust Code To Non-Rust Developers</a></h4>
<p>This is such a great way to see if you truly understood a concept.
Don’t be afraid to say “I don’t know.”
Then go and explore the answer together by going straight to the docs.
It’s way more rewarding and honest.</p>
<p>Help out with OSS code that is abandoned.
If you put in a solid effort to fix an unmaintained codebase, you will help others while learning how to work with other people’s Rust code.</p>
<p>Read code out loud and explain it.
There’s no shame in that!
It helps you “serialize” your thoughts and avoid skipping important details.</p>
<p>Take notes.
Write your own little “Rust glossary” that maps Rust terminology to concepts in your business domain.
It doesn’t have to be complete and just has to serve your needs.</p>
<p>Write down things you found hard and things you learned.
If you find a great learning resource, share it!</p>
<h2 id="believe-in-the-long-term-benefit"><a href="#believe-in-the-long-term-benefit" aria-label="Anchor link for: believe-in-the-long-term-benefit">Believe In The Long-Term Benefit</a></h2>
<p>If you learn Rust because you want to put it on your CV, stop.
Learn something else instead.</p>
<p>I think you have to actually <em>like</em> programming (and not just the idea of it) to enjoy Rust.</p>
<p>If you want to be successful with Rust, you have to be in it for the long run.
Set realistic expectations: You won’t be a “Rust grandmaster” in a week but you can achieve a lot in a month of focused effort.
There is no silver bullet, but if you avoid the most common ways to shoot yourself in the foot, you pick up the language much faster.
Rust is a day 2 language. You won’t “feel” as productive as in your first week of Go or Python, but stick it out and it will pay off.
Good luck and have fun!</p>

            <span>Abstract:</span>Large language models (LLMs) have achieved notable success in code generation. However, they still frequently produce uncompilable output because their next-token inference procedure does not model formal aspects of code. Although constrained decoding is a promising approach to alleviate this issue, it has only been applied to handle either domain-specific languages or syntactic features of general-purpose programming languages. However, LLMs frequently generate code with typing errors, which are beyond the domain of syntax and generally hard to adequately constrain. To address this challenge, we introduce a type-constrained decoding approach that leverages type systems to guide code generation. For this purpose, we develop novel prefix automata and a search over inhabitable types, forming a sound approach to enforce well-typedness on LLM-generated code. We formalize our approach on a foundational simply-typed language and extend it to TypeScript to demonstrate practicality. Our evaluation on the HumanEval and MBPP datasets shows that our approach reduces compilation errors by more than half and significantly increases functional correctness in code synthesis, translation, and repair tasks across LLMs of various sizes and model families, including state-of-the-art open-weight models with more than 30B parameters. The results demonstrate the generality and effectiveness of our approach in constraining LLM code generation with formal rules of type systems.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p id="speakable-summary">Fabled startup investor and accelerator Y Combinator has some choice words for Google in an amicus brief it just submitted in the U.S.’s monopoly case against the search giant.</p>

<p>In the <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25940482-govuscourtsdcd22320513001/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">brief</a>, YC charged that Google is a “monopolist” that has “stunted” the U.S. startup ecosystem by making VC firms like itself hesitate to fund web search and AI startups in what it calls a “kill zone” around Google.</p>







<p>“Google has chilled independent firms like YC from funding and accelerating innovative startups that could otherwise have challenged Google’s dominance,” YC wrote in the filing. “The result is a landscape that has been artificially stunted and stagnant.”</p>

<p>YC’s brief says it’s currently seeking to fund startups developing question-based and agentic AI tools that could transform how people interact with information on the internet. But YC says there’s a “clear risk” that Google will use its monopoly power to slow down the future of those markets.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“Google has effectively frozen the web search and text advertising markets for over a decade,” YC wrote.</p>

<p>The brief, filed May 9, was <a href="https://x.com/pitdesi/status/1921307098543178070" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">spotted</a> on X by VC Sheel Mohnot, the general partner of Better Tomorrow Ventures and a prolific social media poster.</p>

<p>But YC isn’t calling for an immediate breakup of Google, as its CEO Garry Tan <a href="https://x.com/garrytan/status/1921308365445296545" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">made clear in a reply to Mohnot.</a></p>


<p>Rather, YC is arguing Google should curb practices it considers anti-competitive, like paying Apple billions of dollars to make Google the iPhone’s default search engine. It also wants Google to do things it argues would help startups, like opening up Google’s search index so others can train LLMs on it.</p>

<p>For perspective, Google’s search algorithms have been its highly prized secret since its inception. For YC to ask the government to force Google to open it up to competitive LLMs is almost like demanding the government make Microsoft Windows open source, or forcing Amazon to freely deliver packages for competitors.</p>

<p>If Google doesn’t implement such changes within a five-year time frame, then YC advocates for the government to force Google to divest or spin out parts of itself. YC CEO Tan <a href="https://x.com/garrytan/status/1921308365445296545" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">characterized</a> this idea in an X post as a “spinoff hammer” threat.&nbsp;He also posted that “we love Google” but wants “little tech” to succeed, too, in a <a href="https://x.com/garrytan/status/1921319298640892373" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">separate X thread</a>.</p>

<p>To recap, last year <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/08/05/google-loses-massive-antitrust-case-over-search/">Google lost a massive antitrust case over its dominance of the search market</a>. While Google appeals the decision, the U.S. government is mulling potential punishments (“remedies”) that Google might be required to implement, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/20/doj-google-must-sell-chrome-to-end-monopoly/">such as spinning off Chrome.</a> Those remedies are expected to be <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/06/technology/google-search-antitrust-remedies.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">delivered</a> by August 2025.</p>







<p>YC’s stance may come as a surprise to those who have followed its latest partnerships with Google: Most notably, Google Cloud <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/08/01/google-cloud-now-has-a-dedicated-cluster-of-nvidia-gpus-for-y-combinator-startups/">gave YC startups access to a dedicated cluster of Nvidia GPUs</a> last year. Google co-founder Larry Page also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/09/y-combinator-scored-a-surprise-win-when-larry-page-came-to-speak/">made a rare in-person appearance</a> to speak at a YC event in December.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Google <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2013/10/02/google-acquires-yc-backed-flutter-a-gesture-recognition-technology-startup/">has also acquired</a> at least two YC-backed startups: Flutter in 2014, and Fridge <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/google-makes-its-first-aquisition-and-buys-social-group-startup-fridge-2011-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">in 2011.</a> It also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/07/03/googles-gradient-backs-yc-alum-infisical-to-solve-secret-sprawl/">invested in YC startup Infisical</a> through its Gradient fund in 2023.&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, YC is also closely tied to OpenAI, which is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/31/openai-launches-its-google-challenger-chatgpt-search/">now directly competing against Google on search</a>. OpenAI’s CEO Sam Altman used to run YC, while OpenAI was the first group <a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/blog/openai" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">affiliated</a> with YC Research.&nbsp;</p>

<p>That’s something Mohnot <a href="https://x.com/pitdesi/status/1921307098543178070" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">pointed to</a> on X, writing that the biggest beneficiary of YC’s proposed remedies, by far, would be OpenAI, rather than YC’s famously early-stage startups, while commenting that the amicus brief “paints Google as more powerful than it is.”</p>

<p>TechCrunch asked YC how it would respond to this critique, and whether it has any specific examples of areas that it probably would have funded had it not been for Google. So far, YC hasn’t responded to our comment request.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Google didn’t respond to a request for comment about YC’s amicus brief, either. However, it <a href="https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/public-policy/doj-search-remedies-framework/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">argued</a> in a blog post last year that the DOJ’s proposals are “radical and sweeping” and would hurt consumers, business, and developers.</p>

<h2><strong>TL;DR</strong> - We should train future large AI models in space to make use of abundant solar energy, cooling, and the ability to freely scale up.</h2>
<p>Hey all, we're building data centers in space. We’re launching our first satellite next year, which will have the most powerful GPUs ever put in space by &gt;100x. We will launch a larger iteration each year until we reach gigawatt scale.</p>
<h2 id="the-problem"><strong>❌The Problem</strong></h2>
<p>Future hyperscale data centers will put a huge strain on electricity grids, freshwater distribution, and the Western world’s permitting systems. It will simply not be possible to deploy multi-gigawatt scale data centers rapidly in the way we build data centers today.</p>
<h2 id="our-solution"><strong>✨Our Solution</strong></h2>
<p>We take advantage of falling launch costs to make use of inexpensive solar energy in space and low-cost passive radiative cooling, rapidly scaling up orbital data centers almost indefinitely without the physical or permitting constraints faced on Earth. This will ensure we can continue training ever larger models without destroying the environment.</p>

<p>CocoIndex makes it easy to build and maintain knowledge graphs with continuous source updates. In this blog, we will process a list of documents (using CocoIndex documentation as an example). We will use LLM to extract relationships between the concepts in each document. We will generate two kinds of relationships:</p>
<ol>
<li>Relationships between subjects and objects. E.g., "CocoIndex supports Incremental Processing"</li>
<li>Mentions of entities in a document. E.g., "core/basics.mdx" mentions <code>CocoIndex</code> and <code>Incremental Processing</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>The source code is available at <a href="https://github.com/cocoindex-io/cocoindex/tree/main/examples/docs_to_knowledge_graph" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CocoIndex Examples - docs_to_knowledge_graph</a>.</p>

<p>We are constantly improving, and more features and examples are coming soon.

<p>All nodes for Neo4j need two things:</p>
<ol>
<li>Label: The type of the node. E.g., <code>Document</code>, <code>Entity</code>.</li>
<li>Primary key field: The field that uniquely identifies the node. E.g., <code>filename</code> for <code>Document</code> nodes.</li>
</ol>
<p>CocoIndex uses the primary key field to match the nodes and deduplicate them. If you have multiple nodes with the same primary key, CocoIndex keeps only one of them.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Deduplication of nodes with the same primary key" src="https://cocoindex.io/blogs/assets/images/deduplicate-6feb8a0f7caa9da640436f7dc18715da.png" width="2750" height="825"></p>
<p>There are two ways to map nodes:</p>
<ol>
<li>When you have a collector just for the node, you can directly export it to Neo4j.</li>
<li>When you have a collector for relationships connecting to the node, you can map nodes from selected fields in the relationship collector. You must declare a node label and primary key field.</li>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://duskos.org/">https://duskos.org/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43976862">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page">

<p>Dusk OS is a 32-bit Forth and big brother to <a href="http://collapseos.org/">Collapse OS</a>. Its
<a href="https://git.sr.ht/~vdupras/duskos/tree/master/item/fs/doc/design/purpose.txt">primary purpose</a> is to be maximally useful during the <a href="http://collapseos.org/why.html">first
stage of civilizational collapse</a>, that is, when we can't produce
modern computers anymore but that there's still many modern computers around.</p>
<p>It does so by aggressively prioritizing <a href="https://git.sr.ht/~vdupras/duskos/tree/master/item/fs/doc/design/simple.txt">simplicity</a> at the
cost of <a href="https://git.sr.ht/~vdupras/duskos/tree/master/item/fs/doc/design/limits.txt">unorthodox constraints</a>, while also aiming to make
<a href="#operator">operators</a> happy.</p>
<p>Dusk OS innovates by having an <a href="https://git.sr.ht/~vdupras/duskos/tree/master/item/fs/doc/comp/c.txt">"almost C" compiler</a> allowing it to
piggy-back on UNIX C code, through a modest <a href="https://git.sr.ht/~vdupras/duskos/tree/master/item/fs/doc/design/port.txt">porting effort</a>, to
reach its goals and stay true to its design constraints with a minimal effort.</p>
<p>The end result is a system that has a very high "power density", high enough to
issue a <a href="#challenge">challenge to the conventional software culture</a>.</p>
<p>You can read on for more details, but the impatient among you might prefer
taking the <a href="https://git.sr.ht/~vdupras/duskos/tree/master/item/fs/doc/tour.txt">Dusk Tour</a>.</p>
<h2>Status</h2>
<ul>
<li>Can run on:<ul>
<li>Bare metal on those CPUs:<ul>
<li>i386 (BIOS or EFI)</li>
<li>amd64 (EFI)</li>
<li>ARM</li>
<li>RISC-V</li>
<li>m68k</li>
<li><a href="https://git.sr.ht/~vdupras/duskos/tree/master/item/deploy/README.md">List of supported targets</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://git.sr.ht/~vdupras/dusk-wasm">WebAssembly</a></li>
<li><a href="https://git.sr.ht/~vdupras/duskos/tree/master/item/usermode/README.md">At native speed on top of "regular" OSes</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Can read, write, create and boot from FAT12/FAT16 (no FAT32 for now) volumes.</li>
<li>Has an <a href="https://git.sr.ht/~vdupras/duskos/tree/master/item/fs/doc/comp/c.txt">"almost C" compiler</a> which, despite its "almost" qualifier,
  is capable of compiling quite complex "real world" code.</li>
<li>Very small footprint. Designed to run smoothly on 30 years old machines.
  Almost anything that has a 32-bit CPU in fact.</li>
<li>Simple and terse. For example, the total lines of code involved in having a
  fully booted bare metal i386 PC Dusk system running on a FAT16 with a C
  compiler, i386 assembler and a Grid text editor is less than 6000.</li>
<li>It completely self-hosts on all its targets. That is, a machine running Dusk
  OS has all the tools necessary to either improve itself or produce a media to
  run Dusk OS on another machine.</li>
<li>In order to bootstrap itself from something else than itself, it also has a
  <a href="https://git.sr.ht/~vdupras/duskos/tree/master/item/posix/README.md">POSIX-compatible VM</a> written in C that is able to generate images
  for all its targets.</li>
<li>Excluding the <a href="https://git.sr.ht/~vdupras/duskos/tree/master/item/fs/doc/oberon.txt">Oberon system (WIP)</a>, documented externally, has more
  documentation than code.</li>
<li>Licensed under CC0, effectively placing it in the public domain.</li>
</ul>
<p>List of ported codebases:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <code>puff()</code> algorithm from <a href="https://github.com/madler/zlib">zlib</a></li>
<li>DWC USB controller driver from Plan 9</li>
<li>Michael Schierl's RISC5 emulator allowing Dusk to run
  <a href="https://git.sr.ht/~vdupras/duskos/tree/master/item/oberon/README.md">Project Oberon</a>.</li>

<h2>Getting Dusk</h2>
<p>Dusk OS's git repository is <a href="https://git.sr.ht/~vdupras/duskos">hosted on sourcehut</a>. The regular way of
getting it will be to clone the repository from there. You can try to run it
directly from the <code>master</code> branch or you can target one of its
<a href="https://git.sr.ht/~vdupras/duskos/tree/master/item/CHANGELOG.md">releases</a> using the release tags (for example <code>v11</code>).</p>
<p>More information about how to build and run Dusk OS is available in the
<a href="https://git.sr.ht/~vdupras/duskos">root README</a> as well as in its <a href="https://git.sr.ht/~vdupras/duskos/tree/master/item/fs/doc">documentation</a>.</p>
<p>Becoming a Dusk <a href="#operator">operator</a> is an involving process. It's possible
that you're interested in tasting a bit of Dusk's power before you dive into
this wonderful adventure of learning Forth and Dusk. You're in luck, there's
the <a href="https://git.sr.ht/~vdupras/duskos/tree/master/item/fs/doc/tour.txt">Dusk Tour</a> which doesn't require prior Forth knowledge and allows
you to dip your toes in it.</p>
<p>For deployments to actual machines, there's also the
<a href="https://git.sr.ht/~vdupras/duskos/tree/master/item/deploy/README.md">Dusk OS Deployments collection</a> that can be of use.</p>
<p>There is also the option of building <a href="https://git.sr.ht/~vdupras/duskos/tree/master/item/usermode/README.md">Dusk Packages</a> on top of other
OSes. You can look at <a href="https://git.sr.ht/~vdupras/dusk-examples">Dusk Packages examples</a> for a quick start.</p>
<h2>Discuss Dusk</h2>
<p><a href="https://duskos.org/discuss.html">Details here</a></p>
<h2>Funding</h2>
<p>I began a sabbatical from working on modern technology in 2023, which I hope to
extend indefinitely. To that end, I've put up a <a href="https://duskos.org/services.html">service offering</a>
that I hope might help me towards that goal. On that front, I have good reasons
to be optimistic as the <a href="https://git.sr.ht/~vdupras/duskos/tree/master/item/SPONSORS">sponsors</a> ball is already rolling!</p>
<p>Moreover, I believe that my work on Dusk OS and Collapse OS could be
significant enough to some people that it could end up being <a href="https://duskos.org/funding.html">philanthropically
funded</a>. If you're rich and inspired by this work, please consider it.</p>
<h2>Why build this OS?</h2>
<p>Most modern operating systems can do whatever we want them to do. Why do we
need another one? Simplicity.</p>
<p>It's difficult to predict post-collapse conditions, but we can suppose that
many <a href="#operator">operators</a> will need to use their machines in novel and
creative ways. Hackability of the operating system then becomes paramount. Open
source modern operating systems all can be modified to fit its user's needs,
but their complexity limits the likelihood that the user is able to do so. A
simpler OS increases this likelihood.</p>
<p>But we can't have our cake and eat it too, right? Either you have a simple toy
OS or a complex one. Well, maybe not?</p>
<p>Its instigator (and, I guess, some of its <a href="https://git.sr.ht/~vdupras/duskos/tree/master/item/AUTHORS">authors</a> and <a href="https://git.sr.ht/~vdupras/duskos/tree/master/item/SPONSORS">sponsors</a> too)
believes that in the history of computing, Forth has been under-explored. Its
approach to simplicity is, I think, revolutionary. It has significant
shortcomings when system specifications become more complex (Forth hates
complexity and doesn't manage it well), but I believe it possible to elegantly
marry it with languages that like complexity better.</p>
<p>This mix could provide the operator with computing powers rarely seen with
other approaches. We've got to try it.</p>

<h3>A challenge to the conventional software culture</h3>
<p>While the primary purpose of this operating system is related to civilizational
collapse, it's also in big part a reaction to the modern software stack. That
stack is disgustingly complicated. It's a product of the compounded effect of a
software culture that breeds complexity and had the opportunity to build upon
itself over decades, unchecked and unchallenged, oozing its inscrutable pus at
every corner.</p>
<p>The further we let that culture creep out, the harder it is to get out of it.
Hardware follows it dutifully -- and in the same spirit of spurious complexity
-- making clean slate approaches more and more out of reach... but not
impossible yet!</p>
<p>Dusk OS has an amazing "power density", that is, it packs a lot of power in a
very small package. This density allows it to do many things that the modern
stack can do at a fraction of the complexity cost.</p>
<p>It is partly intended as a wake up call to software developers: the regular way
to develop software today is stupid and wasteful and has been for the last 30
years. This stupidity and wastefulness feeds itself and makes us design bigger
and stupider<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> hardware to cater to bigger and stupider software.</p>
<p>We don't need this. All this sweat, tears and blood (because yes, blood is
involved in having a global supply chain enabling these crazily complex
machines we produce) is futile because the conventional approach to computing is
an evolutionary dead end.</p>
<p>There are other ways and we urgently need to explore them. Forth is such a way.
It had a hard time adapting to bigger machines because of its affinity for
simplicity which makes it a bad fit to spurious hardware complexity.</p>
<p>Dusk OS aims to bridge that gap and be a Forth that, yes, is a bit more complex
than your run-of-the-mill Forth, but is careful to keep that very high "power
density" making Forth revolutionary and use that spurious power that modern
hardware gives us, thus competing better, feature-wise, with the modern software
stack.</p>
<h2>Features making Dusk OS special</h2>
<h3>A whole OS built from source on boot</h3>
<p>One thing that makes Dusk OS special is that it boots from a tiny kernel
weighting less than 4 <strong>kilobytes</strong>. From this tiny core, on boot, it
builds its way up, <em>from source code</em>, to a system that has a functional C
compiler, which then allows it to bootstrap itself some more, from source
code.</p>
<p>This peculiarity of Dusk OS has interesting properties. The nicest one, in my
humble opinion, is that this allows us to sidestep the <em>entire</em> problems of
binary compatibility and relocation and only deal with source compatibility.
So, no ELF, no binutils, only code that is designed to run from where it was
generated in the first place. This is so much simpler!</p>
<p>Object files? Global symbols? Nah. C functions are simple Forth words.</p>
<h3>Harmonized Assembly Layer</h3>
<p>Dusk features what we call the <a href="https://git.sr.ht/~vdupras/duskos/tree/master/item/fs/doc/hal.txt">Harmonized Assembly Layer</a> (HAL for short).
This is a cross-CPU assembler, on which the C compiler relies, which prioritizes
implementation and usage simplicity, but is also designed to generate efficient
native code.</p>
<h3>Shortest path to self-hosting for an "almost C" compiler</h3>
<p>Dusk OS self-hosts in about 500 lines of assembly and a few hundred lines of
Forth (the exact number depends on the target machine). From there, it
bootstraps to DuskCC, which is roughly 1200 lines of Forth code. To my
knowledge, Dusk OS is unique in that regard.</p>
<p>You can pick any C compiler that requires POSIX and it will automatically
require orders of magnitude more lines of code to bootstrap because you need
that POSIX system in addition to the C compiler. So even if you pick a small C
compiler such as tcc, you still need a POSIX system to build it, which is
usually in the millions of LOCs.</p>
<p>To be fair, Dusk OS is not the first project thinking of optimizing that path.
<a href="https://github.com/fosslinux/live-bootstrap">Efforts at making our modern software world bootstrappable</a>
lead to an "almost C", <a href="https://git.sr.ht/~oriansj/M2-Planet">M2-Planet</a> with a feature set comparable to
DuskCC with very few lines of code. M2-Planet itself is about 5K lines of code
and the various stages that lead to it are generally a few hundred lines each.
The project initially ran on top of regular kernels (as in "fat kernels with
lots of code"), but some bare metal stages (<a href="https://github.com/ironmeld/builder-hex0">1</a>,
<a href="https://git.stikonas.eu/andrius/stage0-uefi">2</a>) were created and now this little chain end up being
comparable to Dusk in terms of lines of code. Still more than Dusk, but in the
same ballpark.</p>
<p>Although this path is short and technically leads you to an "almost C"
compiler, you can hardly use it because it has no "real kernel" (those bare
metal stages mentioned above are enough to compile M2-Planet, but really not
much else, they're extremely limited) and no shell. You'll need those if you
want to use your shiny compiler.</p>
<p>One of your best picks, should you try this path, would be <a href="https://www.fiwix.org/">Fiwix</a>, a
minimal POSIX i386 kernel weighting less than 50K lines of C+asm. But then,
M2-Planet is not enough. You need to compile tcc (which M2-Planet can compile
after having applied a few patches) which weights 80K. Userspace is worse.
Bash+coreutils are 400K, even busybox is 190K. We still end up with a pretty
minimal and simple system, but it's still a lot more code than Dusk.</p>
<p>So, unless someone tells me about some option I don't know about, DuskCC is
quite innovative on the aspect of self-hosting path length.</p>
<h3>Dusk OS is pretty fast</h3>
<p>The code generated by Dusk OS holds pretty well to modern compilers with fancy
optimizations and millions of lines of code.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://duskos.org/sieve.html">Byte Sieve benchmark done on a i386 NetBSD system</a>,
the DuskCC version of the sieve is almost as fast as GCC's unoptimized build and
the HAL's translation of the Sieve algorithm blows past GCC's unoptimized build
to nearly reach the speed of <code>GCC -O2</code>!</p>
<p>And it gets better! HAL's design allows efficiency to naturally "bubble up" to
higher level code with impressive results. For example, there's the
<a href="https://git.sr.ht/~vdupras/dusk-examples">"charcount" example</a> which pits Dusk's <code>rfind</code> against POSIX's
<code>regex(3)</code>. For this particular and simple use case (count occurrences of
characters range in a big file), Dusk is 15% faster than Debian bookworm amd64's
<code>regex(3)</code> implementation.</p>

<h2>Who is Dusk for?</h2>
<p>Dusk OS doesn't have users, but <em>operators</em>. What's the difference? Control.
You <em>use</em> a phone, you <em>use</em> a coffee machine, hell you even <em>use</em> a car these
days. But you <em>operate</em> a bulldozer, you <em>operate</em> a crane, you <em>operate</em> a
plane.</p>
<p>You <em>use</em> Linux, you <em>use</em> Windows. You <em>operate</em> Dusk OS.</p>
<p>Can you <em>operate</em> Linux? Sure, if you're some kind of god<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>, in the same way
that you can <em>operate</em> a Tesla if you're a top Tesla engineer. But you're much
more likely to be able to <em>operate</em> a landmower than a Tesla.</p>
<p>When you <em>operate</em> a system, there is no problem that can arise that will make
you powerless. Sure, you can have a hardware failure that hopelessly breaks your
system, but at least you'll be able to identify that failure and know for sure
that there is no software solution or workaround. That's control.</p>
<p>The Dusk operator is someone who's <a href="http://collapseos.org/why.html#creative">creative</a>, close to hardware, can
read a datasheet. Dusk shines when one wants to poke around the hardware
without limit.</p>
<p>It compares favorably to other more complete OSes because there's no concurrent
process to mess with your poking and the driver structure is more approachable,
hackable due to its stricter scope and savvier target audience. Also, there is
no "userland". Every tool that Dusk provides or that the operator builds can be
directly used on system memory. No middleman.</p>
<p>Let's use an example. Let's say you're on a notebook that runs on a chipset of
Intel's ICHn family. You read the datasheet and see "oh, nice, there's an SPI
interface in there. Maybe that it's not hooked to anything on the notebook,
let's play with it."</p>
<p>Now, that chipset is very, very central to the computer. There are good chances,
on a BSD or Linux system, that if you begin poking around its registers, you'll
step on someone else toes and crash the system because, for example, of some
other process that needed to read from disk at the same time.</p>
<p>In Dusk, you could completely break the SATA controller, you'll still be golden
as long as you don't access mass storage. Because Dusk doesn't have
concurrency, you have tight control over what happen or doesn't happen on the
machine, so all you need to do is to avoid words that access mass storage. That
gives you ample wiggling space for your hacking session.</p>
<p>To be clear: this is also possible with a custom made BSD or Linux, but you're
going to have to strip a lot of pieces from your distro before you get there
and some of those pieces might be useful debugging tools which will be
difficult to retrofit because they need a wider system. You'll also need a
higher cognitive space to fit BSD/Linux wider abstractions in your mind.</p>

On November 17, 2023, the board of OpenAI <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/sam-altman-firing-openai-future/">fired</a> company CEO Sam Altman. His friend Chesky leapt into action—publicly defending his pal on X, getting on the phone with Microsoft’s CEO, and throwing himself into the thick of Altman’s battle to retake OpenAI. Five days later Altman <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/sam-altman-officially-returns-to-openai-board-seat-microsoft/">prevailed</a>, and Chesky—“I was so jacked up,” he says—turned his buzzing mind to his own company, <a href="https://www.wired.com/tag/airbnb/">Airbnb</a>.</p><p>Thanksgiving weekend was beginning. The Chesky extended family had already held their turkey get-together a week earlier, and the Airbnb CEO had no holiday plan. He was completely alone in his sprawling San Francisco apartment except for Sophie, his golden retriever.</p><p>Still wired out of his mind from the cathartic corporate rescue, Chesky began to write. He wanted to bust the company he’d cofounded out of its pigeonhole of short-term home rentals. Amazon, he was fond of pointing out, was first an online bookstore before it became the everything store. Chesky had long believed that Airbnb should expand in a similar way. But things kept getting in the way—dealing with safety <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/airbnb-party-ban-shootings-police/">issues</a>, <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/new-york-city-airbnb-law-one-year-results/">fighting regulation</a>, coping with the existential crisis of a global pandemic. The company was in danger of being tagged with the word that ambitious entrepreneurs dread like the plague: <em>mature</em>.</p><p>Now Chesky was emboldened to lay out his vision. Home rentals are simply a service, so why stop there? Airbnb could be <em>the</em> platform for booking all sorts of services. While other apps cover specific sectors—food delivery, home maintenance, car rides—Chesky figured that Airbnb’s experience in attractively displaying homes, vetting hosts, and responding to crises could make it more trustworthy than competitors and therefore the go-to option for virtually anything.</p><p>In a frantic typing spree at the dining room table, on the couch, the bed, and at times in his office, Chesky specced out how he would redesign the Airbnb app. Its users—now at 2 billion—would open up the app not only at vacation time but whenever they needed to find a portrait photographer, a personal trainer, or someone to cook their meals. Chesky reasoned that Airbnb would need to significantly strengthen its identity verification. He even thought he could get people to use the app as a credential, something as respected as a government-issued ID. If he could transform Airbnb into a storefront for real-world services, Chesky thought, he’d catapult his company from a nearly $10-billion-a-year business into one that boasted membership in tech’s pantheon.</p><p>Over the next few days, Chesky spilled these thoughts into an Evernote document. “I was basically going from room to room just pouring out this stream-of-consciousness manifesto, like Jack Kerouac writing <em>On the Road</em>,” he says, referring to the frenetically produced single roll of teletype paper that catalyzed the beat movement. “I dusted off all my ideas from 2012 to 2016,” Chesky tells me. “I basically said, ‘We’re not just a vacation app—we’re going to be a platform, a community.’” By Friday he had around 10,000 words, “incomprehensible to anyone but me.” He began to refine it, and by the time the weekend was over, Chesky had distilled his document down to 1,500 words.</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><figure><p><span>PHOTOGRAPH: GABRIELA HASBUN</span></p></figure><p>After the holiday, Chesky gathered his leadership team into a conference room. He handed the team copies of his memo à la Jeff Bezos and waited as his direct reports took it in. “Usually when I share ideas, people aren’t bought in,” he says. “But this time, there wasn’t a lot of feedback. People were really excited. And two years later, that document will now be executed with an exacting detail to what I wrote.”</p><p>This month, Airbnb will launch the first stage of its more than $200 million reinvention: a panoply of more than 10,000 vendors peddling a swath of services in 260 cities in 30 countries. It is also revitalizing an unsuccessful experiment the company began in 2016: offering bespoke local activities, or what it calls “experiences.” The next stage, launch date unspecified, involves making your profile on Airbnb so robust that it’s “almost like a passport,” as Chesky puts it. After that comes a deep immersion into AI: Inspired by his relationship with Altman, Chesky hopes to build the ultimate agent, a super-concierge who starts off handling customer service and eventually knows you well enough to plan your travel and maybe the rest of your life.</p><p>“Brian’s been badly underrated as a tech CEO,” Altman says of his friend. “He's not usually mentioned in the same breath as Larry Page or Bill Gates, but I think he is on a path to build as big of a company.”</p><p>That’s a stretch—Airbnb is nowhere near the size of those oligarchic powers. But Chesky was feeling the need for big changes; While impressive, Airbnb’s growth rate doesn’t suggest that the company will soon reach the trillion-dollar heights of Google and Microsoft. “I’m 43 and at a crossroads, where I can either be almost done or just getting started,” he tells me. “There's a scenario where I'm basically done. Airbnb is very profitable. We've kind of, mostly, nailed vacation rentals. But we can do more.”</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p><span>In early April,</span> I visited Chesky at the company’s lavish San Francisco headquarters. The relaunch was five weeks away. The second floor—where signs warn employees not to bring visitors—had become a sprawling eyes-only command center. The walls were covered with dozens of large poster boards, each one featuring a city, that read as if a group of McKinsey consultants had tackled a fourth-grade geography assignment. Austin, Texas, was written up as “a funky come-as-you-are kind of place” with a handful of “first principles,” one of which was “Outlaw of Texas,” with pointers to food trucks and vintage markets. Another so-called principle was “Live and Alive,” referring to music venues and bat watching; a third was “Dam Lakes,” referring to various water sports. Other blindingly obvious notations included barbeque, tacos, and the two-step. The Paris poster painted a “revolutionary” city marked by slow living and enduring culture.</p><p>Chesky strode up and greeted me enthusiastically. Dressed in a slim T-shirt that exposed his swole physique, he bounced on his heels with a jittery energy that reminded me of the first time I met him, in January 2009. He had just joined Y Combinator’s famous program for startups, and he and his classmates were at a party at the home of YC cofounder Paul Graham. (Graham told me then that he thought Airbnb’s business plan was crazy but was impressed by their determination.) I mentioned to Chesky that I was headed to Washington, DC, for Barack Obama’s inauguration, and he and his cofounders immediately tried to convince me to use their service to sleep on someone’s couch. I declined, but somehow over the next 15 years they managed to sell the idea to 2 billion people, including me, and now the company has a market cap worth more than Marriott.</p><p>Chesky ushers me into a conference room to get a preview of the new Airbnb app. His engineers and designers have rebuilt the app from scratch, and he waves around a stick of lip balm as a talisman as he talks me through the redesign. Also in the room is his product marketing head, Jud Coplan, while his vice president of design, Teo Connor, Zooms in from London. While customers likely think of Airbnb as a travel company, its leaders view the operation as an achievement in design. Which makes sense; both Chesky and his cofounder Joe Gebbia were students at the Rhode Island School of Design.</p><figure><p><span>Airbnb's new user interface featuring experiences and services.</span><span>COURTESY OF AIRBNB</span></p></figure></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>Chesky explains that historically, people used Airbnb only once or twice a year, so its design had to be exceptionally simple. Now the company is retooling for more frequent access. Open the app, and you see a trio of icons that act as gateways to the expanded functions. Within minutes Chesky and his lieutenants are applauding the cheery, retro style of the icons—a house for traditional rentals, a hotel bell for services, and a Jules Verne-ish hot-air balloon representing activities. “We really thought deeply about the metaphor—what was the right visual to express an experience?” says Connor. Once they decided on the balloon, they drilled into how much fire should belch from the basket. The icons were drawn by a former Apple designer whose name Chesky would not divulge. “He’s a bit of a secret weapon,” he says.</p><p>A less-secret weapon is Chesky’s collaboration with the iconic, also ex-Apple, industrial designer Jony Ive. Chesky’s north star, it should be said, is Apple. “Steve Jobs, to me, is like Michelangelo or da Vinci,” he says. Despite never meeting Jobs, “I feel like I know him deeply, professionally, in a way that few people ever did, in a way that you only possibly could by starting a tech company as a creative person and going on a rocket ship,” Chesky says. By hiring Ive’s LoveFrom company and working with Jobs’ key collaborator, Chesky gets a taste of the famous Jobs/Ive dynamic. Ive himself doesn’t make that comparison, but he does praise Chesky’s design chops. “There are certain tactical things where I hope that sometimes I'm of use to Brian, just as as a fellow designer,” Ive says. “But the majority of our work has been around ideas and the way we frame problems and understand opportunities.”</p><p>Another key part of the app is the profile page. “You need trust,” Chesky says—meaning a verifiable identity. Airbnb has been vetting the new vendors, which it calls “service hosts.” For months, Chesky says, an army of background researchers has been scrutinizing the résumés, licenses, and recommendations of chefs, photographers, manicurists, masseuses, hair stylists, makeup artists, personal trainers, and aestheticians who provide spa treatments such as facials and microdermabrasions. They’re all being professionally photographed.</p><div data-testid="GenericCallout"><figure><p><span>Airbnb's new guest profile interface.</span><span>COURTESY OF AIRBNB</span></p></figure></div><p>For the next phase—turning Airbnb’s user profiles into a primary internet ID—Connor and her team have engaged in some far-out experimentation. She rattles off a list of technologies they’ve been exploring, including biometrics, holograms, and the reactive inks used to deter counterfeiting on official ID cards. But it’s far from easy to become a private identity utility (hello, Facebook), and even Chesky notes that getting governments to accept an Airbnb credential to verify identity is “a stretch goal.”</p><p>Now that a whole slew of people will have new reasons to chat with each other and coordinate plans, Airbnb has also enhanced its messaging functions. Fellow travelers who share experiences can form communities, stay in touch, even share videos and photos. “I don’t know if I want to call it a social network, because of the stigma associated with it,” says Ari Balogh, Airbnb’s CTO. So they employ a fuzzier term. “We think of it as a connection platform,” he says. “You’re going to see us build a lot more stuff on top of it, although we’re not an advertising system, thank goodness.” (My own observation is that any for-profit company that can host advertising will, but whatever.)</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>This brings us to the services—the heart and soul of this reinvention. Those now on offer seem designed to augment an Airbnb stay with all the stuff that drives up your bill at a luxury resort, like a DIY White Lotus. It will be interesting to see how the company handles the inevitable cases of food poisoning or bad haircuts (and skeezy customers), but Airbnb can draw on its 17 years of experience with dirty sheets, all-night discos on the ground floor, or a host who is literally terrorizing you. Eventually, Chesky says, Airbnb will offer “hundreds” of services, perhaps as far-ranging as plumbing, cleaning, car repair, guitar lessons, and tutoring, and then take its 15 percent fee.</p></div><div data-testid="RowWrapper"><figure><p><span>Crafted cuts by Bryan, Chicago, Illinois</span><span>COURTESY OF AIRBNB; LYNDON FRENCH</span></p></figure><figure><p><span>Train with Steve Jordan, Trainer to the Stars, Los Angeles, California</span><span>COURTESY OF AIRBNB; JACKIE BEALE</span></p></figure></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>The other key feature of the company’s reinvention, of course, is Experiences. If the idea sounds familiar, that’s because Airbnb launched a service by that name almost a decade ago, with pretty much the same pitch: special activities for travelers, like architects leading tours of buildings or chefs showing people how to fold dumplings.</p><p>It flopped, although Airbnb never formally pulled the plug. Chesky’s excuses include tactical errors: After a big initial splash, the company didn’t follow up with more marketing, and it didn’t establish a strong flow of new experiences. But the big reason, he says, was that it was too early. Now the company has five times as many customers and an ecosystem to support the effort. “It was like our Newton,” says Chesky, referring to Apple’s handheld device that predated the iPhone. (Another Apple reference, for those keeping score.)</p><p>Chesky’s crew has arranged for more than 22,000 experiences in 650 cities, including a smattering of so-called “originals,” with people at the top of their field—star athletes, Michelin chefs, famous celebrities. In the pipeline is Conan O’Brien selling a perch behind a mic in his podcast studio. (Don’t expect it to air.) Taking a lesson from his earlier flop, Chesky has planned a steady cadence of these short-term promotional stunts, which, of course, is what the Conan experience ultimately is. “We’re going to have thousands of originals and maybe one day hundreds of thousands—a regular drumbeat of some of the biggest iconic celebrities,” Chesky says.</p><p>He shows me how someone could take a trip to, say, Mexico City and book experiences instantly. “Fun fact—I’ve always dreamed of being a professional wrestler in Mexico. I want to be a <em>luchador</em>!” he tells me, then immediately regrets it.

In any case, you’d share the photos with others in your group. (But don’t call it a social network.)</p></div><div data-testid="RowWrapper"><figure><p><span>Megan Thee Stallion in Los Angeles, California</span><span>COURTESY OF AIRBNB; ADRIENNE RAQUEL</span></p></figure><figure><p><span>Horseback riding through four hidden temples of the Inkas, Cusco, Peru</span><span>COURTESY OF AIRBNB; PAZ OLIVARES-DROGUETT</span></p></figure></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p><span>Airbnb’s planned transformation</span> tracks with another reinvention: that of its leader.</p><p>Chesky had originally taken the title of CEO over his two pretty-much equal cofounders because his personality was more forward facing—it wasn’t even formalized until 2010. But then, in 2011, the company had its first real crisis when a host publicly shared a horror story about how an Airbnb guest from deep, deep hell pillaged and trashed her home. What wasn’t stolen—the customer broke into a locked closet to grab a passport, cash, and heirloom jewelry—was ravaged and burned in the fireplace. “The death-like smell from the bathroom was frightening,” wrote the host. The story threatened to destroy the cheerful person-to-person vibe the company had cultivated. It didn’t help that Airbnb’s initial response was clueless and weak.</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>Chesky stepped up to become the face of the company and instituted overdue safety protocols. Over the next few years, Chesky cemented his alpha status. In 2018 his cofounder Joe Gebbia stepped down from daily duties, though he still sits on the board. (Recently Gebbia has been in the news for his very public participation in DOGE’s remaking of the US government. When asked about it at a Q and A session with employees, Chesky said that Gebbia was free to have his own opinions, but they are not the company’s. Chesky did not attend Trump’s inauguration.) The third cofounder, Nathan Blecharczyk, is still with the company, though it’s notable that as I sat in meetings with over a dozen executives, the only time his name came up was when I mentioned it.</p><p>Chesky was totally in charge during the pandemic, when Airbnb lost 80 percent of its business in eight weeks. He laid off a quarter of the staff. Now that bookings surpass pre-2020 levels, he thinks the company is stronger. And he learned a big lesson: “The pandemic was the turning point of the company,” he says. “My first principle became ‘Don’t apologize for how you want to run your company.’ Most of all you should not apologize for being in the details. The number one thing people want to do is keep you out of the details.”</p><p>When Chesky shared some of these views at a Y Combinator event in 2024, Paul Graham was inspired to <a data-offer-url="https://www.paulgraham.com/foundermode.html" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.paulgraham.com/foundermode.html&quot;}" href="https://www.paulgraham.com/foundermode.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">write an essay</a> called “<a href="https://www.wired.com/story/plaintext-want-to-get-into-founder-mode-you-should-be-so-lucky/">Founder Mode</a>.” Graham used Chesky’s story to argue that only the person who created a company knows what is best, and the worst mistake is to listen to management types who haven’t built their own. The essay struck a nerve; people were stopping Chesky on the street and yelling “Founder mode!” Someone dropped off a baseball hat for him with those words; it now sits on a shelf in his conference room.</p><p>Chesky, meanwhile, has been deep in the details, especially on this reinvention, itself kind of a classic founder move. “I did review work before the pandemic, but people kind of hated it. There were negative associations to a CEO reviewing everything; it’s considered micromanaging.” Also, his idol Steve Jobs was famous—infamous?—for his unsparing criticism. Chesky contends that once he went all-in on dishing out criticism, with no sheepishness, people seemed happier. But even if they weren’t, he’d do it anyway. Curious to see how this worked, I arranged to attend a Chesky review.</p><p>Gathered in a conference room, the design and engineering teams presented near-final app tweaks affecting how hosts set up their services. Chesky seemed fairly pleased with what he was seeing—so much so that he apologized to me afterward that I didn’t get to see him go animal with his underlings. Nonetheless, even during this lovefest of a product review, Chesky babbled a constant stream of minor corrections. <em>The cursor is oddly centered … Those visual cues are a little confusing … We need a subtle drop shadow here … The next line doesn’t seem centered vertically … That address input is pretty awkward … That button looks oddly short, is it supposed to be that short? … That shimmer, do we think we need it? Get rid of it … That top module doesn’t make sense … We need to rewrite all the copy on this page … I think we need a better empty state … That title’s not clear …</em></p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>The group shuffles out satisfied and a bit stunned that they got away so easy. But when I meet Chesky a day later to sum things up, he tells me that I’d just missed a spicier product review. Then he gets serious, explaining what the reinvention means to him. “I felt a little bit like the vacation rental guy,” he says. “Like we as a company are a little underestimated.” He brings up Apple again, saying that both companies embody the idea that a business relationship can generate emotion. “My ambition is kind of like the ambition of an artist and designer,” he says.</p><p>At that point Chesky gets a little woo. “Magic, in hindsight, is not technology,” he says as he reflects on Apple’s wizardry. What he’s realized is that magic lies in forging connections with those who offer you a bed, a microdermabrasion, a sparring match in a lucha libre ring. “The magic that is timeless is, like, the stuff you remember at the end of your life.”</p><p>He lets that sit for a minute. Then he puts a cap on that insight, sounding less like a CEO than a life coach. “I’ve never had a dream with a device in it,” he says. Leave it to the subconscious to highlight what matters. That said, his <em>day</em> dreams certainly involve a new kind of device. In his off hours he’s helping with a secret project headed by his friends Altman and Ive to create a device that Altman says is the next step beyond computers. (“This is not theoretical memo-swapping,” Altman tells me. “We’re hard at work on it, prototyping.”)</p><p>But that’s somewhere off in the future. In the realm of products that actually exist in the world, Chesky will have to face competition from dozens of domain leaders including Yelp, Instacart, DoorDash, Ticketmaster, Hotels.com, Tinder, OpenTable, and Craigslist, to name but a few. You can probably add Apple, Meta, and Microsoft, since Chesky wants Airbnb to be a universal credential and what certainly looks like a social network. Even Steve Jobs might have blinked at taking on that crowd all at once.</p><hr><p><em>Images styled by Jillian Knox.</em><br><em>Featuring: Liv Skinner, Liv Well and Francesca Lopez, Zinnia Wildflower Bakehouse</em></p><p><em>Let us know what you think about this article.

        <p>
            <i>
                <time datetime="2025-05-13T16:00Z">

            </i>
        </p>
    

    <p>While recently traveling to the U.S., I was completely locked out of my TD Personal Banking account.</p>
<p>TD relies heavily on SMS-based two-factor authentication (2FA) for customer logins. I had, quite reasonably, disabled my Canadian SIM to avoid the usual price gouging and roaming charges.</p>
<p>Luckily, I had their proprietary “TD Authenticate” app installed, thinking it would serve as a viable alternative. But when I opened TD Authenticate, I had been logged out, and logging back in required, you guessed it, an SMS message to my now-inaccessible Canadian number.</p>
<p>I had the authentication app. I had my credentials. But the system’s design created an inescapable catch-22.</p>
<p>This is a textbook case of security punishing the user instead of protecting them.</p>
<p>TD doesn’t offer TOTP support. No passkeys. No fallback email verification. Just a fragile, closed loop with a single point of failure, and one that failed entirely in a very foreseeable scenario.</p>
<p>Despite years of progress in digital identity and authentication standards, many Canadian financial institutions remain stuck with brittle, outdated authentication flows that fail from both a security and usability perspective.</p>
<p>In the case of SMS-based 2FA, it isn’t just inconvenient, it’s actively harmful.</p>
<h2 id="the-problem-with-sms-based-2fa">The Problem With SMS-Based 2FA</h2><p>SMS has long been discredited as a secure second factor.</p>
<p>As far back as 2017, <a href="https://www.nist.gov/">NIST</a> explicitly <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3-Implementation-Resources/63B/Authenticators/">discouraged the use of SMS for delivering one-time codes</a>. With <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/">CISA</a> describing it as a <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/2023-01/fact-sheet-implementing-phishing-resistant-mfa-508c.pdf">“last resort MFA option”</a> and <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/2023-01/fact-sheet-implementing-phishing-resistant-mfa-508c.pdf">“temporary solution while organizations transition to a stronger MFA implementation.”</a></p>
<p>The problem is that SMS-Based 2FA leaves users vulnerable to cyber-attacks, as threat actors can exploit protocol vulnerabilities and use social-engineering to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Intercept 2FA codes sent via text messages</li>
<li>Take control of a user’s phone number with a SIM Swap.</li>
<li>Trick the user into revealing their 2FA code with phishing.</li>
</ul>
<p>In 2023, the <a href="https://www.cyber.gc.ca/en">Canadian Centre for Cyber Security</a> reiterated exactly this message, saying:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Only consider short message service (SMS) codes as an authentication factor for low-risk logins. SMS is insecure as codes are sent in unencrypted form. An increasing number of cyber attacks involves threat actors intercepting SMS codes through SIM swapping, phishing or other social engineering attacks.”</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cyber.gc.ca/en/guidance/steps-effectively-deploying-multi-factor-authentication-mfa-itsap00105">https://www.cyber.gc.ca/en/guidance/steps-effectively-deploying-multi-factor-authentication-mfa-itsap00105</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don’t think anyone considers a bank account “low-risk.” Yet here we are, still relying on SMS as the default, and sometimes only, 2FA option</p>
<h2 id="proprietary-otp-apps-a-marginal-improvement-at-best">Proprietary OTP Apps: A Marginal Improvement at Best</h2><p>In an effort to move beyond SMS, some banks, TD included, have rolled out their own proprietary OTP apps rather than adopting the open <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6238">TOTP standard (RFC 6238)</a>.</p>
<p>The result? Slightly better security. Significantly worse usability.</p>
<p>These apps often:</p>
<ul>
<li>Don’t integrate with password managers or platform authenticators.</li>
<li>Require a login before you can generate a code, which defeats the purpose of an authenticator app.</li>
<li>Offer no support for hardware tokens or modern passkeys.</li>
</ul>
<p>Even worse, these apps often become excuses, a reason to avoid implementing the open, interoperable standards that actually make a difference.</p>
<h2 id="what-good-authentication-looks-like-in-2025">What Good Authentication Looks Like In 2025</h2><p>A modern authentication flow in 2025 should be built around strong, user-friendly, standards-based mechanisms:</p>
<ul>
<li>Passkeys (FIDO2/WebAuthn): Phishing-resistant, device-based login using biometrics. Excellent UX and security.</li>
<li>TOTP Support: Let users use <em>any</em> standard authenticator (Authy, Google Authenticator, Microsoft Authenticator, 1Password, etc.).</li>
<li>Hardware Security Keys: FIDO2 keys like YubiKey for users who want maximum assurance.</li>
<li>Secure Recovery Paths: Trusted devices, or recovery codes, not SMS.</li>
<li>Password Manager Compatibility: Seamless autofill and passkey support across trusted password managers and OS keychains.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="security-shouldnt-punish-the-user">Security Shouldn't Punish The User</h2><p>Authentication flows too often feel like they were designed in a vacuum, engineered by siloed security teams and product managers with no regard users.
If a system breaks in common scenarios, like international travel, it’s not a secure system. It’s a hostile one.</p>
<h2 id="banks-must-do-better">Banks Must Do Better</h2><p>TD isn’t the only offender, but it’s a glaring example of how not to do authentication in 2025.
The refusal to support basic standards like passkeys or TOTP isn’t just an inconvenience, it’s a security liability that actively harms users and undermines trust.
There’s no excuse anymore. The standards exist. The risks are well-documented.
If your authentication flow still relies on SMS and a brittle proprietary app, it’s long past time for a serious overhaul.
Security and usability are not mutually exclusive. Achieving both requires systems designed with competence, foresight, and actual consideration for the user experience.</p>
<h3 id="postscript-three-years-later-still-broken">Postscript: Three Years Later, Still Broken</h3><p>By the way, that trip to the U.S. happened three years ago. Nothing has changed since.</p>
<p>I’ve emailed TD about this issue (basically saying what I said in this blog post), we’ll see what they say.</p>
<p>And let’s be honest, this whole conversation is just touching the surface. The real progress starts when we talk about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-sovereign_identity">Self-Sovereign Identity</a>, <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-1.0/">DIDs</a>, and decentralized auth infrastructure.</p>
<p>But that’s a blog post for another day.</p>
<p>And don’t even get me started on logging into accounts at the Canada Revenue Agency.</p>

<p>The reconciliation bill primarily focuses on cuts to Medicaid access and increased health care fees for millions of Americans. The AI provision appears as an addition to these broader health care changes, potentially limiting debate on the technology's policy implications.</p>
<p>The move is already inspiring backlash. On Monday, tech safety groups and at least one Democrat criticized the proposal, reports <a href="https://thehill.com/policy/technology/5296022-schakowsky-criticizes-republicans-ai-ban/">The Hill</a>. Rep. Jan Schakowsky (D-Ill.), the ranking member on the Commerce, Manufacturing and Trade Subcommittee, called the proposal a "giant gift to Big Tech," while nonprofit groups like the Tech Oversight Project and Consumer Reports warned it would leave consumers unprotected from AI harms like deepfakes and bias.</p>
<h2>Big Tech’s White House connections</h2>
<p>President Trump has already <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/01/trumps-day-one-orders-saving-tiktok-creating-doge-and-ending-censorship/">reversed</a> several Biden-era executive orders on AI safety and risk mitigation. The push to prevent state-level AI regulation represents an escalation in the administration's industry-friendly approach to AI policy.</p>
<p>Perhaps it's no surprise, as the AI industry has cultivated close ties with the Trump administration since before the president took office. For example, Tesla CEO Elon Musk <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/05/bill-gates-accuses-elon-musk-of-killing-children-with-doge-led-usaid-cuts/">serves</a> in the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), while entrepreneur David Sacks acts as <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-appoints-former-paypal-coo-david-sacks-ai-crypto-czar-2024-12-06/">"AI czar,"</a> and venture capitalist Marc Andreessen reportedly <a href="https://www.thefp.com/p/marc-andreessen-on-ai-tech-censorship-trump-democrats">advises</a> the administration. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/01/trump-announces-500b-stargate-ai-infrastructure-project-with-agi-aims/">appeared with Trump</a> in an AI datacenter development plan announcement in January.</p>
<p>By limiting states' authority over AI regulation, the provision could prevent state governments from using federal funds to develop AI oversight programs or support initiatives that diverge from the administration's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/11/trump-victory-signals-major-shakeup-for-us-ai-regulations/">deregulatory stance</a>. This restriction would extend beyond enforcement to potentially affect how states design and fund their own AI governance frameworks.</p>

            Computer scientists at ETH Zurich discover new class of vulnerabilities in Intel processors, allowing them to break down barriers between different users of a processor using carefully crafted instruction sequences. Entire processor memory can be read by employing quick, repeated attacks.

<div>
                
                	<h2><b>In brief</b></h2>
                
                
                <ul> 
 <li>The new class of vulnerabilities in Intel processors arises from speculative technologies that anticipate individual computing steps.</li> 
 <li>Openings enable gradual reading of entire privilege memory contents of shared processor (CPU).</li> 
 <li>All Intel processors from the last 6 years are affected, from PCs to servers in data centres.</li> 
</ul>
            </div>
<div>
                
                
                <p>Anyone who speculates on likely events ahead of time and prepares accordingly can react quicker to new developments. What practically every person does every day, consciously or unconsciously, is also used by modern computer processors to speed up the execution of programs. They have so-called speculative technologies which allow them to execute instructions on reserve that experience suggests are likely to come next. Anticipating individual computing steps accelerates the overall processing of information.</p> 
<p>However, what boosts computer performance in normal operation can also open up a backdoor for hackers, as recent research by computer scientists from the Computer Security Group (COMSEC) at the Department of Information Technology and Electrical Engineering at ETH Zurich shows. The computer scientists have discovered a new class of vulnerabilities that can be exploited to misuse the prediction calculations of the CPU (central processing unit) in order to gain unauthorised access to information from other processor users.</p> 
<h2><b>PC, laptop and server processors all affected</b></h2> 
<p>“The security vulnerability affects all Intel processors,” emphasises Kaveh Razavi, head of COMSEC. “We can use the vulnerability to read the entire contents of the processor’s buffer memory (cache) and the working memory (RAM) of another user of the same CPU.” The CPU uses the RAM (random access memory) and cache to temporarily store calculation steps and information that is likely to be needed next.</p> 
<p>This vulnerability fundamentally undermines data security, particularly in the cloud environment where many users share the same hardware resources. It affects the processors of the world’s largest CPU manufacturer, which are used in PCs and laptops, as well as those used in data centre servers.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
<h2><b>Nanosecond gap in authority check</b></h2> 
<p>The so-called BPRC (Branch Predictor Race Conditions) emerge during a brief period of a few nanoseconds when the processor switches between prediction calculations for two users with different permissions, explains Sandro Rüegge, who has been examining the vulnerability in detail over the past few months. </p>
            </div>
<div>
                        <figure>
            <img alt="  In the illustration, a hacker manages to overcome the protective measures (privileges) at step 3." src="https://ethz.ch/en/news-and-events/eth-news/news/2025/05/eth-zurich-researchers-discover-new-security-vulnerability-in-intel-processors/_jcr_content/wide_content/image/image.imageformat.1286.1020709684.png">

			      To compute faster, a predictor in the computer processor anticipates certain calculation steps. Hackers can exploit these anticipations to bypass security barriers and access confidential information. In the illustration, a hacker manages to overcome the protective measures (privileges) at step 3.&nbsp;(Illustration: ETH Zurich / COMSEC, HK)</p>
			  </figcaption>
			</figure>
    
                    </div>
<div>
                
                
                <p>Breaking through the built-in protective barriers between users, known as privileges, is possible because the permissions for individual activities are not stored at the same time as the calculations. With special inputs, it is now possible to cause ambiguity in the sequence of events when changing users, resulting in incorrect assignment of privileges. An attacker could exploit this in order to read an information byte (a unit consisting of eight binary 0/1 pieces of information).</p> 
<h2><b>Unlocking entire contents of memory byte by byte</b></h2> 
<p>The disclosure of a single byte would be negligible. However, the attack can be repeated in quick succession, allowing the contents of the entire memory to be read over time, explains Rüegge. “We can trigger the error repeatedly and achieve a readout speed of over 5000 bytes per second.” In the event of an attack, therefore, it is only a matter of time before the information in the entire CPU memory falls into the wrong hands. &nbsp;</p> 
<h2><b>Part of a series of security vulnerabilities</b></h2> 
<p>The vulnerability that the ETH Zurich researchers have now identified is not the first to be discovered in the speculative CPU technologies introduced in the mid-1990s. In 2017, Spectre and Meltdown were the first two vulnerabilities of this kind to hit the headlines, and new variants have been appearing regularly ever since. Johannes Wikner, a former PhD student in Razavi's group, already identified a vulnerability known as Retbleed back in 2022. He exploited traces of speculatively executed instructions in the CPU’s cache to access information from other users.</p> 
<h2><b>Suspicious signal reveals vulnerability</b></h2> 
<p>The starting point for the discovery of the new vulnerability class was work that followed on from the Retbleed investigations. “I examined the functions of the protective measures that Intel had introduced to patch up the Retbleed vulnerability,” says Johannes Wikner.</p> 
<p>In doing so, he discovered an unusual signal from the cache memory that appeared regardless of whether the protective measures were enabled or disabled. Rüegge then took over detailed analysis of the cause of the signal and, based on this work, was able to uncover the new attack vector.</p> 
<h2><b>Fundamental architectural problem</b></h2> 
<p>The vulnerability was discovered back in September 2024. Since then, Intel has implemented protective measures to secure its processors. Nevertheless, there are many indications that the problem is more serious. “The series of newly discovered vulnerabilities in speculative technologies is an indication of fundamental flaws in the architecture,” Razavi points out. “The gaps have to be found one by one and then closed.”</p> 
<p>Closing these sorts of gaps requires a special update to the processor’s microcode. This can be done via a BIOS or operating system update and should therefore be installed on our PCs in one of the latest cumulative updates from Windows.</p>

<p>   You may have heard of Christian Bök. You <a href="https://www.rifters.com/crawl/?p=1719">may</a> have <a href="https://www.rifters.com/crawl/?p=1821">read</a> about <a href="https://www.rifters.com/crawl/?p=6289">him</a> on this very blog if you’ve been hanging out here long enough. Perhaps you were even one of the very select few to witness the seminal talk I gave back in 2016<sup><sup><a id="post-11511-footnote-ref-0" href="#post-11511-footnote-0">[1]</a></sup></sup>—“ScArt: or, How to Tell When You’ve Finished Fucking”— which climaxed with a glowing description of Bök’s magnum opus, then still in progress. And if you read <em>Echopraxia</em>, you’ll have encountered—without even knowing it— a brief cameo of that work near the end, suggesting that at least in the Blindopraxia timeline, he’d brought his baby to fruition. </p>



<p>
  Truth to tell, I didn’t know if he was actually going to pull it off for the longest time. I thought he’d given up years ago.
</p>

This is excerpted from a book of <em>poetry.</em></sub><br><sup>All of these pictures are.</sup></figcaption></figure></div>



<p>
  The story so far: back in the early two-thousands Christian Bök, famous for accomplishments lesser poets would never even dream of attempting (he once wrote <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eunoia_(book)">a book</a> in which each chapter contained only a single vowel) started work on the world’s first biologically-self-replicating poem: the <em>Xenotext Experiment</em>, which aspired to encode a poem into the genetic code of a bacterium. Not just a poem, either: a <em>dialog</em>. The DNA encoding one half of that exchange (“Orpheus” by name) was designed to function both as text and as a functional gene. The protein it coded for functioned as the other half (“Eurydice”), a sort of call-and-response between the gene and its product. The protein was also designed to fluoresce red, which might seem a tad gratuitous until you realize that “Eurydice”’s half of the dialog contains the phrase “the faery is rosy/of glow”.
</p>



<p>
  Phase One involved engineering Orpheus and Eurydice into the benign and ubiquitous <em>E. coli</em>, just to work out the bugs. Ultimately, though, the target microbe was <em>Deinococcus radiodurans</em>: also known as “Conan the Bacterium” on account of being one of the toughest microbial motherfuckers on the planet. To quote Bök himself:
</p>



<p><span>   Astronauts fear it. Biologists fear it. It is not human. It lives in isolation. It grows in complete darkness. It derives no energy from the Sun. It feeds on asbestos. It feeds on concrete. It inhabits a gold seam on level 104 of the Mponeng Mine in Johannesburg. It lives in alkaline lakelets full of arsenic. It grows in lagoons of boiling asphalt. It thrives in a deadly miasma of hydrogen sulphide. It breathes iron. It breathes rust. It needs no oxygen to live. It can survive for a decade without water. It can withstand temperatures of 323 k, hot enough to melt rubidium. It can sleep for 100 millennia inside a crystal of salt, buried in Death Valley. It does not die in the hellish infernos at the Städtbibliothek during the ﬁrebombing of Dresden. It does not burn when exposed to ultraviolet rays. It does not reproduce via the use of dna. It breeds, unseen, inside canisters of hairspray. It feeds on polyethylene. It feeds on hydrocarbons. It inhabits caustic geysers of steam near the Grand Prismatic Spring in Yellowstone National Park. </span></p>



<p>
  I’d love to quote all seven glorious and terrifying pages, but to keep within the bounds of Fair Use I’ll skip ahead to the end:
</p>



<p><span> 
  It is totally inhuman. It does not love you. It does not need you. It does not even know that you exist. It is invincible. It is unkillable. It has lived through five mass extinctions. It is the only known organism to have ever lived on the Moon. It awaits your experiments.</span>
</p>



<p>
  As things turned out, it had to await somewhat longer than expected. The project hinged upon molecular techniques that did not exist when the experiment began. Christian taught himself the relevant skills— genetics, proteomics, coding— and enlisted a team of scientists (not to mention a supercomputer or two) to invent them. His audacity was more than merely inspiring; some might even call it infuriating. As I railed back in 2016:
</p>



<p>  <span> It was fine when Art came to science in search of inspiration; that’s as it should be. I suppose it was okay— if a little iffy— when Science started going back to Art for solutions to scientific and technical problems. But this crosses a line: with <em>The Xenotext</em>, we have reached the point where Science is being used <em>solely to assist in the creation of new art</em>. Scientists are developing new techniques just to help Christian finish his bloody poem. </span></p>



<p>   <span>Up to now, we’ve generally been in the driver’s seat. Insofar as a relationship even existed, Science was the top, Art the Bottom. But Art has now started driving Science. Science has discovered its inner sub. </span></p>



<p>
  As a former scientist myself, I was not quite sure how to feel about that. But however that was, I knew Christian Bök was to blame.
</p>



<p>
  Fortunately, Science got a reprieve. The project hit a bump at <em>E. coli</em>. Eurydice fluoresced but the accompanying words got mangled. When they eventually cleared that hurdle and moved to Phase Two, <em>Deinococcus </em>fought back, shredding the code before it ever had a chance to express. Conan, apparently, does not <em>like</em> people trying to play with its insides. It’s already got its genes set up just the way it likes them. Unkillable.
</p>



<p>
  That, as far as I knew, was where the story ended ten years ago. Christian released <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Xenotext-Book-1-Christian-B%C3%B6k/dp/1552453219?crid=GYWK6A1WEQZY&amp;dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.uKuwl4n9Dbe0ci2-giIjX1qKhpmiowgO7JLDua2yNQQ.ZqfLpMXR-_qIkcPgArJXF8lbK-s5CfYL4AjD_QA1YL8&amp;dib_tag=se&amp;keywords=the+xenotext&amp;qid=1746985656&amp;s=books&amp;sprefix=the+xenotext%2Cstripbooks-intl-ship%2C98&amp;sr=1-1"><em>The Xenotext: Book One</em></a> in 2015, documenting his efforts and gift-wrapping them in some gorgeous and evocative bonus content, but the prize remained out of reach. He headed off to Australia to follow other pursuits; then to that oversurveilled and repressive shithole known as the United Kingdom. We fell out of touch. I assumed he’d given up on the whole project.
</p>



<p>
  Oh me of little faith.
</p>



<p>   Because now it’s 2025, and he fucking <em>did it</em>. The Xenotext is live and glowing in <em>Deinococcus radiodurans</em>: iterating away inside that immortal microbial bad-ass that <em><span>feeds on stainless steel</span></em>, that <em><span>resides inside the core of reactor no. 4 at Chernobyl</span></em>, that <em><span>does not die in the explosion that disintegrates the Space Shuttle Columbia during orbital reentry</span></em>. Christian Bök did not give up. Christian Bök did not fail. Christian Bök is going to outlive civilization, outlive most of the biosphere itself.  </p>



<p>   The rest of us might think we achieve artistic immortality if our work lasts a century or three. Bök blows his nose at such puny ambitions. <em>His</em> work might get deciphered by Fermi aliens who finally make it to our neighborhood a billion years from now. It could be iterating right up until the sun swallows this planet whole. </p>

It would be well worth the price just for the the acrobatics and anagrams and sonnets, for the way it remixes science and fiction and the classic canon of dead white Europeans<sup><sup><a href="#post-11511-footnote-1" id="post-11511-footnote-ref-1">[2]</a></sup></sup>. It contains poetry to entrance people who hate poetry. It juggles space exploration and the Fermi Paradox and the potentially extraterrestrial origins of Bacteriophage φx174. But its rosy flickering heart is that dialog iterating away in Conan even as I type. A reinvention, almost a quarter-century in the making. A fucking monument if you ask me, equal parts revelation and revolution.

<p>
  If you happen to live in or around Toronto, it’s getting an official launch on May 27 at The Society Clubhouse, 967 College St, from 7-9pm. It’s one of a half-dozen Coach House titles that will be launched that night, and no doubt all six authors are worthy in their own right. Still. You know who I’m going for.
</p>



<p>
  Maybe I’ll see some of you there.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.marginalia.nu/log/a_119_pdf/">https://www.marginalia.nu/log/a_119_pdf/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43973721">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><p>The search engine has recently gained the ability to index the PDF file format. The change will deploy over a few months.</p><p>Extracting text information from PDFs is a significantly bigger challenge than it might seem.
The crux of the problem is that the file format isn’t a text format at all, but a graphical format.</p><p>It doesn’t have text in the way you might think of it, but more of a mapping of glyphs to coordinates on “paper”. These
glyphs may be rotated, overlap, and appear out of order, with very little semantic information
attached to them.</p><p>You should probably be in awe at the fact that you can open a PDF file in your favorite viewer (or browser), hit ctrl+f, and search for text.</p><figure><a href="https://www.marginalia.nu/log/a_119_pdf/vertical.png"><img src="https://www.marginalia.nu/log/a_119_pdf/vertical.png"></a><figcaption>Vertical, rotated text, next to horizontal text.</figcaption></figure><p>Meanwhile the search engine preferrably wants clean HTML as input.</p><p>The absolute best way of doing this is these days is likely through a vision based machine learning model,
but that is an approach that is very far away from scaling to processing hundreds of gigabytes of PDF files
off a single server with no GPU.</p><p>Thankfully this isn’t a completely unexplored problem, it was possible to start off with <a href="https://pdfbox.apache.org/">PDFBox</a>’
PDFTextStripper class, which <em>sort of</em> solves the problem, but with a lot of limitations that means
it isn’t quite suitable fo the search engine’s needs, as it does as it says on the box, extract the text from a PDF
with no regards for headings or other semantics, which are incredibly important relevance signals.</p><p>Following are some of the modifications made to provide a pdf-to-text extraction that is better suited to the search engine’s needs.</p><h2 id="identifying-headings">Identifying headings</h2><p>A simple way we can look for headings is to seek a semibold or heavier line of text that is isolated from other
text, this works when headings are bolded, but not all headings are bolded!</p><figure><a href="https://www.marginalia.nu/log/a_119_pdf/education.png"><img src="https://www.marginalia.nu/log/a_119_pdf/education.png"></a><figcaption>Excerpt of the first page of "Can Education be Standardized? Evidence from Kenya", working version</figcaption></figure><p>As we see in the example above, many headings instead rely on font size instead.</p><p>This poses a problem, as font-sizes are very much specific to the document itself, one document may have its
body in 10pt with 16pt headings, another may use 14pt and 20pt instead! Finding a global breakpoint is futile,
instead it’s more effective to build some font size statistics instead.</p><figure><a href="https://www.marginalia.nu/log/a_119_pdf/fontsizes.png"><img src="https://www.marginalia.nu/log/a_119_pdf/fontsizes.png"></a><figcaption>Distribution of font sizes in "Can Education be Standardized?"</figcaption></figure><p>Here page 1 is the front page with an abstract and author listing, page 9 is text with a heading, and page 10 is just text.
There is some degree of noisiness to the font size distribution caused by subscripts, footnotes, and so forth.</p><p>We can see the distributions of pages 9 and 10 are fairly similar, but page 1 deviates significantly.</p><p>For each page there tends to be one dominant font size, which is generally the body text (note the logarithmic y-scale).</p><p>The differences in distribution hints that we may want to use not per-document statistics, but per-page statistics, since particularly the font choices on the first page often deviates from the rest. In the case of “Can education be standardized…”, font size 17 is used for the title of the document, but font size 14 is used for headings later on.</p><p>Attaching some factor of about 20% to the median font size of each page seems to fairly reliably identify headings. There are of course always exceptions,
but this catches most of the important cases.</p><h3 id="joining-consecutive-headings">Joining consecutive headings</h3><p>Headings are often split into multiple lines, often for stylistic reasons. This means we sometimes want to join consecutive lines of heading text into one,
and deciding when to perform this operation is not entirely trivial. I won’t provide any real solution to this, but mostly try to highlight why it’s a tricky problem.</p><figure><a href="https://www.marginalia.nu/log/a_119_pdf/right_justified_heading.png"><img src="https://www.marginalia.nu/log/a_119_pdf/right_justified_heading.png"></a><figcaption>An example of a multiline heading, right justified, followed by additional bolded text.</figcaption></figure><p>The case above combines a two-line title with the popular aesthetic choice of a heading justified to the right–which casuses problems as indenting a line is also often an indicator of a paragraph break–following the title is another semibolded line of text (the author’s name) and some lines down we have a heading that is not bolded at all.</p><p>This is another case where we’re unlikely to find a fool-proof rule for joining. Joining consecutive headings with the same font size and weight seems to mostly do a good job, but there are plenty of cases where it produces undesirable results.</p><figure><a href="https://www.marginalia.nu/log/a_119_pdf/double_irrelevant_heading.png"><img src="https://www.marginalia.nu/log/a_119_pdf/double_irrelevant_heading.png"></a><figcaption>An example of two unrelated headings following each other with similar font size and weight.</figcaption></figure><h2 id="identifying-paragraphs">Identifying Paragraphs</h2><p>PDFTextStripper does a decent job of identifying paragraphs. It uses a clever mix of looking at line spacing and indentation to figure out when to break a paragraph. It does have some room for improvement though, particularly with regards to the line spacing logic.</p><p>Its biggest problem is that it uses a fixed break point for line separation where above that point, lines are not in the same paragraph, not taking account for the fact that documents use different line spacing. Especially in academic drafts and preprints, 1.5-2x line spacing is fairly common! Having a too large value means we interfere with the header identification, as some headers are absorbed into paragraphs of body text, so we need a robust solution here.</p><p>We can fix this shortcoming by again applying a similar statistical technique to what we did with font sizes. Let’s consider a page of text, shown below. This is a text that PDFTextStripper would have dealt with with no greater issues, but it makes for a clearer explanation so we’ll consider it anyway.</p><figure><a href="https://www.marginalia.nu/log/a_119_pdf/line-spacing-text.png"><img src="https://www.marginalia.nu/log/a_119_pdf/line-spacing-text.png"></a><figcaption>Excerpt of page 5 of "The role of phronesis in knowledge-based economy"; showing four different blocks of text separated by different spaces.</figcaption></figure><p>If we build a histogram of the distances between lines for this text, we’ll find an illustration like below.</p><figure><a href="https://www.marginalia.nu/log/a_119_pdf/linespaces.png"><img src="https://www.marginalia.nu/log/a_119_pdf/linespaces.png"></a><figcaption>Distance between lines in page 5 of "The role of phronesis in knowledge-based economy", Ceglarska.</figcaption></figure><p>We tend to have fairly large outliers here, so using an average approach is unlikely to perform well, the median however ends up being exactly the line distance used in the body. So again it’s possible to tack some factor onto this, and end up with a heuristic for separating paragraphs that will survive any line spacing!</p><h2 id="in-conclusion">In Conclusion</h2><p>Extracting text from a PDF is never going to be perfect, since the format really wasn’t designed for that sort of operation, and there are a number of trade-offs when choosing which “good enough”-solution to use. A search engine is primarily interested in relevance signals, such as headings, it’s very happy if it can identify an abstract, and get a somewhat coherent picture of the remaining text. So in that sense, it’s possible to approach a solution that deals with most relevant documents in a somewhat graceful fashion.</p><h2 id="sample-texts-used">Sample texts used</h2><dl><dt>Can Education be Standardized?

When you connect your Samsung phone to an external display, DeX presents a desktop-like interface allowing you to launch multiple apps in floating windows and control everything with a keyboard and mouse. While DeX remains exclusive to Samsung devices, Google is finally working on its own version. We now have a first look at what Android’s upcoming desktop mode will look like on Pixel phones.</p><div data-container-type="content"><p>

Note that the previously seen "Desktop View" text in the description was changed to say "desktop windowing" in Beta 4.</p></div><p>Before I show you Android’s new desktop mode, keep in mind that what you’re about to see is Google’s unfinished work. Desktop mode almost certainly won’t launch in the upcoming <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/android-16-features-3484159/">Android 16</a> stable release, which is why we’re not referring to it as an Android 16 feature. Instead, it could arrive in one of the upcoming quarterly releases of Android 16, but if it does, it’ll likely be available only as an opt-in developer option. Google still has a lot of work to do before releasing its DeX competitor, but I’m hoping it’ll be ready for Android 17’s release next year.</p><p>With that out of the way, here’s a video showing what Android’s desktop mode looks like right now:</p><p>Compared to the current, barebones desktop interface that appears when you connect a Pixel device to an external display, Android’s new desktop mode actually displays the taskbar and status bar. The taskbar is a big addition, as it provides access to your pinned apps and a better version of the app drawer. The <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/android-taskbar-recent-apps-3488476/">taskbar can also show recent apps</a> while in desktop mode, making it easier to multitask.</p><p>Speaking of multitasking, it’s possible to launch multiple apps in floating windows simultaneously using the new desktop mode. It’s also possible to freely move, resize, or snap windows to the side, just like on desktop operating systems. This makes it easy to drag and drop content from one app to another, provided the apps you’re using support drag-and-drop.</p><div><picture><source sizes="(min-width: 64rem) 51.25rem, 80vw" srcset="https://www.androidauthority.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Android_desktop_mode_windows_side_by_side-scaled.jpg.webp 2560w, https://www.androidauthority.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Android_desktop_mode_windows_side_by_side-64w-36h.jpg.webp 64w, https://www.androidauthority.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Android_desktop_mode_windows_side_by_side-1000w-563h.jpg.webp 1000w, https://www.androidauthority.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Android_desktop_mode_windows_side_by_side-1920w-1080h.jpg.webp 1920w, https://www.androidauthority.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Android_desktop_mode_windows_side_by_side-1536w-864h.jpg.webp 1536w, https://www.androidauthority.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Android_desktop_mode_windows_side_by_side-675w-380h.jpg.webp 675w, https://www.androidauthority.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Android_desktop_mode_windows_side_by_side-300w-170h.jpg.webp 300w, https://www.androidauthority.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Android_desktop_mode_windows_side_by_side-1280w-720h.jpg.webp 1280w, https://www.androidauthority.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Android_desktop_mode_windows_side_by_side-840w-472h.jpg.webp 840w" type="image/webp"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" sizes="(min-width: 64rem) 51.25rem, 80vw" title="Android desktop mode windows side by side" srcset="https://www.androidauthority.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Android_desktop_mode_windows_side_by_side-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://www.androidauthority.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Android_desktop_mode_windows_side_by_side-64w-36h.jpg 64w, https://www.androidauthority.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Android_desktop_mode_windows_side_by_side-1000w-563h.jpg 1000w, https://www.androidauthority.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Android_desktop_mode_windows_side_by_side-1920w-1080h.jpg 1920w, https://www.androidauthority.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Android_desktop_mode_windows_side_by_side-1536w-864h.jpg 1536w, https://www.androidauthority.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Android_desktop_mode_windows_side_by_side-675w-380h.jpg 675w, https://www.androidauthority.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Android_desktop_mode_windows_side_by_side-300w-170h.jpg 300w, https://www.androidauthority.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Android_desktop_mode_windows_side_by_side-1280w-720h.jpg 1280w, https://www.androidauthority.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Android_desktop_mode_windows_side_by_side-840w-472h.jpg 840w" alt="Android desktop mode windows side by side" src="https://www.androidauthority.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Android_desktop_mode_windows_side_by_side-scaled.jpg"></picture><div><p>Mishaal Rahman / Android Authority</p></div></div><p>These features are considered table stakes for any desktop UI, but it’s important that Google nails the basics first. From what I can tell, Google is essentially adapting the <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/android-15-qpr-2-beta-1-desktop-windowing-3481557/">desktop windowing mode available on tablets</a> to phones that are hooked up to an external display. For context, Google introduced desktop windowing on tablets with the first quarterly release of <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/android-15-features-3401939/">Android 15</a>, allowing tablets to launch multiple apps in freeform windows under a new windowing environment. This windowing environment only worked on the built-in display and not external ones, which is why it remained exclusive to tablets. It appears Google is now bringing this same windowing environment to external displays in an upcoming update.</p><p>This makes sense as a starting point, but a phone hooked up to an external display shouldn’t provide the exact same experience as a tablet. The phone’s screen is still usable, so there needs to be a way to control the phone using the same peripherals. As we already revealed, though, Google is adding <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/android-16-external-display-management-3533257/">PC-like external display tools to Android</a>, including the ability to rearrange displays, seamlessly move the mouse between them, and more.</p><p>Google’s version of desktop mode is long overdue, but I’m still here for it. If the company truly wants to <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/chrome-os-becoming-android-3500661/">unify its desktop operating efforts behind Android</a>, then it needs to beef up Android’s desktop windowing capabilities. Making desktop mode available to more Android devices will go a long way in making Android apps work better on large screens. I’m just hoping that Google commits to this project and doesn’t release it in a half-baked state.</p><p><strong>Got a tip?

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article id="article-body"><div><p><span>T</span>oday, I am resigning from the National Science Board and the Library of Congress Scholars Council.&nbsp;</p><p>Even as the White House threatens the foundational tenets of <a href="https://time.com/6693684/donald-trump-constitutional-bullying-democracy-threat-president-lawsuit/">constitutional democracy</a> and continues to <a href="https://time.com/7273450/trump-administration-gut-health-institutions/">slash funding</a> for essential social services, it is tempting to hope that the public institutions charged with promoting and protecting knowledge will, nevertheless, soldier on with their mission. I did.&nbsp;</p><p>Since January 2025, scientists and librarians, program officers and policy analysts at the National Science Foundation, the Library of Congress, and other federal offices and agencies have focused on their work, despite an increasingly hostile political environment. We’ve also seen civil servants fired and <a href="https://time.com/7267383/donald-trump-department-education/">accused</a> of not making the mark, vendors’s contracts <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/09/us/politics/doge-musk-contracts-agencies.html">ignored</a>, and grants and fellowships <a href="https://time.com/7216299/nih-budget-cuts-science-research-funding/">cancelled</a>.&nbsp;</p></div><div><p>Perseverance has its limits. The erosion of these institutions’ integrity—and the growing realization that it is impossible to fulfill their missions in good faith—has made the cost of continuing untenable. This is why I must step away from my work with two federal institutions I care deeply about. </p><p>In both these roles, over the past few years, I've been asked to serve on diverse bodies that offer guidance about how the Executive and Legislative branches can be stewards of knowledge and create structure to enable discovery, innovation, and ingenuity. In the instance of the National Science Board, this ideal has dissolved so gradually, yet so completely, that I barely noticed its absence until confronted with its hollow simulacrum.</p><p>I have encountered increasing barriers to the exercise of honest counsel. These repeated obstacles of procedural circumvention, particularly insidious to those of us who have long advocated for more democratic and inclusive knowledge systems, represent not just personal frustration, but institutional regression.</p></div><div><p>Freedom of expression is not merely an abstract principle, or even a constitutional right, but a practical necessity for meaningful advisory work. In Ray Bradbury's <em>Fahrenheit 451</em>, published as short stories in the late 1940s and as a novel in 1953, warned not only of the destruction of books, but of a society in which people had lost the desire to read them. <a href="https://time.com/7284644/trumps-erasure-of-women/">The parallel today</a> is not only the administration’s <a href="https://time.com/7209261/communications-by-federal-health-agencies-will-be-temporarily-reviewed-by-trump-appointees/">effort</a> to destroy and suppress knowledge, but also the institution’s willingness to accept the cultivated <a href="https://time.com/7209300/trumps-biological-truth-executive-order-is-not-true/">irrelevance</a> of it—a challenge that undermines any serious effort to conduct research, inform policy, or guide public institutions.</p><div><p>The National Science Foundation (NSF)—established as an independent agency through the National Science Act of 1950 and marking its 75th anniversary this week—<a href="https://time.com/7259548/why-government-should-pay-for-university-research-costs/">traces its roots</a> to Vannevar Bush’s landmark <a href="https://nsf-gov-resources.nsf.gov/2023-04/EndlessFrontier75th_w.pdf">report</a>, “Science, the Endless Frontier,” addressed to President Harry S. Truman. But we might also see the establishment of this premier research institution as reflecting a response to fears depicted by Bradbury. The NSF can be understood not only as a catalyst of scientific promise for national purpose, but also as a guarded response to fears about centralized control over knowledge and thought, shaped by the dark shadows of the Third Reich and the emerging Red Scare.</p><p>The NSF’s investments have shaped some of the most transformative technologies of our time—from <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/news/precious-time">GPS</a> to <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/impacts/internet#:~:text=The%20U.S.%20National%20Science%20Foundation,email%20message%20using%20the%20ARPANET.">the internet</a>—and supported vital research in the social and behavioral sciences that helps the nation understand itself and evaluate its progress toward its democratic ideals. So in 2024, I was honored to be appointed to the National Science Board, which is charged under 42 U.S. Code § 1863 with establishing the policies of the Foundation and providing oversight of its mission. </p></div></div><div><p>But the meaning of oversight changed with the arrival of <a href="https://time.com/7222251/doge-musk-federal-workers-government/">DOGE</a>. That historical tension—between the promise of scientific freedom and the peril of political control—may now be resurfacing in troubling ways. Last month, when a National Science Board <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/nsb/news/news_summ.jsp?cntn_id=311196#:~:text=April%2025%2C%202025,as%20Director%20of%20the%20Foundation.">statement</a> was released on occasion of the April 2025 resignation of Trump-appointed NSF Director Sethuraman Panchanathan, it was done so without the participation or notice of all members of the Board.&nbsp;</p><div><p>Last week, as the Board held its 494th meeting, I listened to NSF staff say that DOGE had by fiat the authority to give thumbs up or down to grant applications which had been systematically vetted by layers of subject matter experts.</p><p>Our closed-to-the-public deliberations were observed by Zachary Terrell from the DOGE team. Through his Zoom screen, Terrell showed more interest in his water bottle and his cuticles than in the discussion. According to <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-01312-8"><em>Nature</em></a> Terrell, listed as a "consultant" in the NSF directory, had accessed the NSF awards system to block the dispersal of approved grants. The message I received was that the National Science Board had a role to play in name only. </p></div></div><div><p>This episode reflects a deeper concern: the erosion of meaningful guidance. I was still free to discuss my concerns at the board meeting, but it was increasingly clear that it was just a performance without any impact. The advisory body had been transformed into a ceremonial assemblage. Consultation occurred without consequence. When grant applications are vetoed and whole organizations restructured, the freedom to speak becomes meaningless when disconnected from the possibility of being heard.</p><p>All of this is threatened by the creeping normalization of authoritarian approaches to <a href="https://time.com/6985760/autocrats-weaponize-chaos-essay/">knowledge management</a> and <a href="https://time.com/6969851/academic-freedom-is-more-important-than-ever-now/">academic freedom</a>. The National Science Board has not been disbanded like so many other statutorily established, independent agencies in the federal government. But preservation of form provides little consolation when function has been strategically neutralized, mirroring the backsliding that scholars have thoroughly documented: maintaining legitimacy for institutions that no longer honor their founding purposes. This hollowing out is not just about governance in the abstract, it has material consequences for which research questions get asked, which datasets get produced, which knowledge gets produced, and which perspectives shape our understanding of pressing societal challenges. It has consequences for the integrity of knowledge itself.</p></div><div><p>The second institution from which I am departing is also demonstrating symptoms of democratic decay. In 2023, I was appointed by the Librarian of Congress to the Scholars Council, which advises the Kluge Chairs program, the Kluge Prize for the Study of Humanity, and other library programming intended to get ideas out of the stacks and into society by “reinvigorat[ing] the interconnection between thought and action,” “bridging the divide between knowledge and power,” and “narrow[ing] the gap between thinkers and doers.”</p><p>Last week, the Librarian of Congress, Dr. Carla Hayden, was summarily <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/09/us/politics/hayden-library-of-congress-dei.html">dismissed</a> via an email addressed to “Carla” from a White House HR administrator. The Trump Administration claimed that she was fired for “things she had done at the Library of Congress in the pursuit of DEI and putting inappropriate books in the library for children.” It is true that Hayden was repeatedly on record as saying the Library should be for <em>all</em> Americans. And it is <a href="https://www.loc.gov/about/frequently-asked-questions/#:~:text=The%20Library%20of%20Congress%20is%20a%20research%20library%2C%20and%20books,with%20a%20photo%20on%20it.">false</a> that the Library, which is intended to hold <em>all</em> books published in the United States, lends books to <a href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/05/09/congress/trump-carla-hayden-firing-congress-00340034">children</a>. The ouster of Hayden is part of a broader pattern of political targeting of women and Black public servants across the federal government.</p></div><div><p>Dr. Carla Hayden was a leader in the digitization of libraries and a steadfast advocate for their public mission. Her dismissal signals more than a routine personnel shift—it reflects a deeper contest over who controls the curation and dissemination of knowledge in the digital age. That contest became even more apparent two days later, when the Trump Administration <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/05/10/trump-u-s-copyright-official-00340306">fired</a> her direct report, Shira Perlmutter, the Register of Copyrights. Perlmutter’s office had just released a <a href="https://www.copyright.gov/ai/Copyright-and-Artificial-Intelligence-Part-3-Generative-AI-Training-Report-Pre-Publication-Version.pdf">report</a> concluding that while generative AI poses novel challenges to copyright law, these could be addressed through voluntary licensing and market-based solutions—rather than statutory changes to the fair use doctrine. At a time when questions about AI and intellectual property are front of <a href="https://d1dth6e84htgma.cloudfront.net/Subtitle_C_Communications_4e3fbcc3bc.pdf?ref=404media.co">mind</a>, the Library of Congress’s oversight of the U.S. copyright system is more consequential than ever.</p><p>The steady accumulation of procedural adjustments, each seemingly minor, stand to systematically and collectively alter the purpose and impact of our institutions. The dismissal of Hayden, who took the helm of the Library of Congress with a vow to extend its resources to <em>all </em>of us, represents not merely a personnel change but a statement about what kind of knowledge stewardship is deemed acceptable.</p></div><div><p>To watch these changes unfold without naming them for what they are is to participate in a collective amnesia about how knowledge infrastructures shape power relations. Like the shopkeeper in an authoritarian society <a href="https://hac.bard.edu/amor-mundi/the-power-of-the-powerless-vaclav-havel-2011-12-23">described</a> by Vaclav Havel in his essay “The Power of the Powerless,” who participates in his own oppression through small daily acts of complicity, placing a party slogan in his window not out of conviction but out of habit. To remain on advisory boards that have been stripped of meaningful advisory function is to become that shopkeeper, to lend legitimacy to a process that has been systematically delegitimized.</p><p>What then, is the responsible course of action? For me, the answer now lies in refusal, the withdrawal of participation from systems that require dishonesty as the price of belonging. My resignation represents such a refusal, not a surrender of responsibility but an assertion of it.</p></div><div><p>This is not to condemn those who remain. There is value in continued presence, in bearing witness, in working for reform from within. But there comes a point when presence itself becomes an endorsement, when working within the system becomes indistinguishable from working for it.</p><p>In her Nobel <a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/literature/1993/morrison/lecture/">lecture</a> in 1993, the writer Toni Morrison observed:</p><p><em>"Oppressive language does more than represent violence; it is violence; does more than represent the limits of knowledge; it limits knowledge. Whether it is obscuring state language or the faux-language of mindless media; whether it is the proud but calcified language of the academy or the commodity driven language of science; whether it is the malign language of law-without-ethics, or language designed for the estrangement of minorities, hiding its racist plunder in its literary cheek—it must be rejected, altered and exposed."</em></p><p>The aim of my resignation is to break free of powers that seek to limit knowledge and silence voice. To signal that certain boundary lines have been crossed. To insist that advisory roles must expand knowledge and be more than appendages to predetermined decisions.</p></div><p>I follow political economist Albert O. Hirschman, in his seminal <a href="https://www.hup.harvard.edu/books/9780674276604">work</a> <em>Exit, Voice, and Loyalty</em>, who offered a framework for understanding responses to institutional decline. Exit (leaving) and voice (speaking up) need not be mutually exclusive strategies. My resignations are both, an exit that amplifies the voice of others. By departing these advisory roles, I aim to speak more clearly in my own language about what they have become and what they ought to be. This is not an abandonment of loyalty to these institutions' missions, but rather, its highest expression.</p></article></div></div>]]></description>

    <p>How high is the stress I am talking about? You are commuting all you think is that you might snap today, you might quit today. That is what I am calling a high-stress work environment. You know after a certain point the job becomes disposable and you are making a list in your head of who you are going to say "fuck you" to as you storm out of the building.</p>
<p>The reality in this environment is that everyone is stressed and you are not unique. The person pressing you is being pressed on by another guy. Everyone hates their job and everyone likes the movie "Office Space" daydreaming about quitting and dating Jennifer Aniston, who happens to be beautiful but stupid enough to not see that.</p>
<p>The reality is that if you quit, you DO NEED these connections to get a new job in the form of a recommendation. Do not snap at people. You may think the job is disposable, but the reality is that the memory is not. You will always be "that guy". You will always be the person who said "fuck you" to them, even though you were both in a pile of shit neck-deep.</p>
<p>So, prioritize relationships. If you are doing something, forget about deadlines or significance, think of the other person who is begging you and how it impacts them. Every relationship is a human relationship, so do not let the "professional environment" corrupt that.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/05/13/eu_security_bug_database/">https://www.theregister.com/2025/05/13/eu_security_bug_database/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43972438">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p>The European Vulnerability Database (EUVD) is now fully operational, offering a streamlined platform to monitor critical and actively exploited security flaws amid the US struggles with budget cuts, delayed disclosures, and confusion around the future of its own tracking systems.</p>
<p>As of Tuesday, the <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://euvd.enisa.europa.eu/">full-fledged version of the website</a> is up and running.</p>
<p>"The EU is now equipped with an essential tool designed to substantially improve the management of vulnerabilities and the risks associated with it," ENISA Executive Director Juhan Lepassaar said in a statement announcing the EUVD.&nbsp;</p>

    

<p>"The database ensures transparency to all users of the affected ICT products and services and will stand as an efficient source of information to find mitigation measures," Lepassaar continued.</p>

        


        

<p>The European Union Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA) first announced the project in June 2024 under a mandate from the EU's Network and Information Security 2 Directive, and quietly rolled out a limited-access beta version last month during a period of uncertainty surrounding the United States' <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/04/25/cve_board_funding/">Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) program</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Register</em> readers — especially those tasked with vulnerability management — will recall that the US government's funding for the CVE program was <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/04/16/homeland_security_funding_for_cve/">set to expire</a> in April until the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, aka CISA, swooped in at the 11th hour and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/04/16/cve_program_funding_save/">renewed the contract</a> with MITRE to operate the initiative.</p>

        

<p>More broadly, Uncle Sam has been hard at work <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/05/06/cisa_budget_cuts/">slashing CISA</a> and other <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/04/08/cisa_cuts_threat_intel/">cybersecurity funding</a> while key federal employees responsible for the US government's secure-by-design program have <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/04/22/top_cisa_officials_jump_ship/">jumped ship</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Plus, on Monday, CISA said it would <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/05/12/cisa_vulnerabilities_updates_x/">no longer</a> publish routine alerts - including those detailing exploited vulnerabilities - on its public website. Instead, these updates will be delivered via email, RSS feeds, and the agency's account on X.</p>
<p>With all this, a cybersecurity professional could be forgiven for doubting the US government's commitment to hardening networks and rooting out vulnerabilities.</p>

        

<p>Enter the <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://euvd.enisa.europa.eu/">EUVD</a>. The EUVD is similar to the US government's <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://nvd.nist.gov/">National Vulnerability Database</a> (NVD) in that it identifies each disclosed bug (with both a CVE-assigned ID and its <a href="https://euvd.enisa.europa.eu/faq" rel="nofollow">own EUVD identifier</a>), notes the vulnerability's criticality and exploitation status, and links to available advisories and patches.</p>
<p>Unlike the NVD, which is still <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/04/14/security_in_brief/">struggling with a backlog of vulnerability submissions</a> and is not very easy to navigate, the EUVD is updated in near real-time and highlights both critical and exploited vulnerabilities at the top of the site.</p>

</ul>
<p>The EUVD provides three dashboard views: one for critical vulnerabilities, one for those actively exploited, and one for those coordinated by members of the <a target="_blank" href="https://csirtsnetwork.eu/" rel="nofollow">EU CSIRTs network</a>.</p>
<p>Information is sourced from open-source databases as well as advisories and alerts issued by national CSIRTs, mitigation and patching guidelines published by vendors, and exploited vulnerability details.</p>
<p>ENISA is also a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.enisa.europa.eu/news/another-step-forward-towards-responsible-vulnerability-disclosure-in-europe" rel="nofollow">CVE Numbering Authority (CNA)</a>, meaning it can assign CVE identifiers and coordinate vulnerability disclosures under the CVE program. Even as an active CNA, however, ENISA seems to be in the dark about what's next for the embattled US-government-funded CVE program, which is only under contract with MITRE until next March.</p>
<p>The launch announcement notes that "ENISA is in contact with MITRE to understand the impact and next steps following the announcement on the funding to the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures Program." ®</p>

    <tr><td></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"></td><td><div><p>Hey HN, we’re Tyrone and Guang, founders of Miyagi Labs (<a href="https://miyagilabs.ai/">https://miyagilabs.ai</a>), an AI-powered education platform that transforms educational YouTube videos into interactive courses. It helps you learn better through active practice and personalized feedback.</p><p>We use LLMs to automatically generate quizzes, practice questions, and real-time feedback from any educational video or resource—turning passive watching into active learning. Here’s a short demo: <a href="https://youtu.be/alO7FaorHOY" rel="nofollow">https://youtu.be/alO7FaorHOY</a>.</p><p>Improving education has always been tricky. Bloom’s 2-sigma problem (showing that a high-quality personal tutor is far more effective than conventional methods) has persisted, even as technology has advanced.</p><p>We met at MIT as CS majors and have always been passionate about education. Over the years, we’ve become teachers and experts in subjects like chess, algorithms, math, languages, and ninja warrior. A common theme was that we both heavily relied on YouTube to learn.</p><p>YouTube has incredible content for learning pretty much anything, but it’s buried in a lot of distractions. Also, passively watching videos is far less effective than taking notes, asking questions, and doing practice problems, which is what we aim to do with Miyagi Labs.</p><p>Our solution is essentially a multi-step function that takes in a YouTube playlist (or list of any resources) and outputs an entire course with summaries, questions, answers, and more. The pipeline is roughly: video/resource —&gt; transcript/text —&gt; chunks —&gt; summary and question —&gt; answers to questions, with some other features along the way.</p><p>We mostly use prompting and different models at each step to make the course as useful as possible. Certain topics require more practice problems vs. comprehension, and we’d use reasoning models for highly technical subjects.</p><p>We launched about three months ago and currently have 400+ courses and partnerships with some businesses and awesome creators. Some of our popular courses include 3Blue1Brown’s linear algebra course, a botany course on plants and ecology, and YC’s How to Start a Startup series.</p><p>Our product resembles classical MOOC-style course platforms in terms of UI, but is more interactive. It’s really easy to ask a question or receive custom feedback compared to a static course on Coursera. It’s also comparable to AI tutor sites, but we try to build more of a community and require less activation energy as a learner. We’re basically betting that AI can hugely improve education, but that students still want to learn from their favorite creators and want baseline shared resources for standard topics that are then augmented with personalized features.</p><p>You can try it here: <a href="https://miyagilabs.ai/">https://miyagilabs.ai</a> (no login required for most courses—but if you sign up you can also create your own course).</p><p>We’d love your feedback on what kinds of videos/resources you’d like to learn from, what’s missing from current learning tools, and if you know any creators or educators who would like to collaborate. Happy to hear any feedback and answer any questions!</p></div></td></tr>        <tr><td></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"></td><td><form action="comment" method="post"></form></td></tr>  </tbody></table>
