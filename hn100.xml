<p>Google just launched Gemini 2.5 Pro on March 26th, claiming to be the best in coding, reasoning and overall everything. But I mostly care about how the model compares against the best available coding model, Claude 3.7 Sonnet (thinking), released at the end of February, which I have been using, and it has been a great experience.</p>



<p>Let’s compare these two coding models and see if I need to change my favourite coding model or if Claude 3.7 still holds.</p>



<h2 id="h-tl-dr">TL;DR</h2>



<p>If you want to jump straight to the conclusion, I’d say go for <strong>Gemini 2.5 Pro</strong>, it’s better at coding, has one million in context window as compared to Claude’s 200k, and you can get it for free (a big plus). However, Claude’s 3.7 Sonnet is not that far behind. Though at this point there’s no point using it over Gemini 2.5 Pro.</p>



<p>Just an article ago, <a href="https://composio.dev/blog/claude-3-7-sonnet-vs-grok-3-vs-o3-mini-high/">Claude 3.7 Sonnet</a> was the default answer to every model comparison, and this remained the same for quite some time. But here you go, Gemini 2.5 Pro takes the lead. </p>

<h2 id="h-brief-on-gemini-2-5-pro">Brief on Gemini 2.5 Pro</h2>



<p>Gemini 2.5 Pro, an experimental thinking model, became the talk of the town within a week of its release. Everyone’s talking about this model on Twitter (X) and YouTube. It’s trending everywhere, like seriously. The first model from Google to receive such fanfare.</p>



<p>And it is <strong>#1 in the LMArena</strong> just like that. But what does this mean? It means that this model is killing all the other models in coding, math, Science, Image understanding, and other areas.</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/zf0c4kp8j091hzerwjto.png" alt=""></figure>



<p>Gemini 2.5 pro comes with a <strong>1 million token context window,</strong> with a 2 million context window coming soon. 🤯</p>



<p>You can check out other folks like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@t3dotgg">Theo-t3</a> talking about this model to get a bit more insight into it:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Google won. (Gemini 2.5 Pro is INSANE)" width="1000" height="563" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/A0V4km88tFc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>It is the best coding model to date, with an accuracy of about 63.8% on the SWE bench. This is definitely higher than our previous top coding model, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, which had an accuracy of about 62.3%.</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ce6yvu56s5wff9iiod8l.png" alt=""></figure>



<p>This is a quick demo Google shared on this model of building a dinosaur game.</p>



<figure><p>

</p></figure>



<p>Here’s a quick benchmark of this model on Reasoning, Mathematics, and Science. This confirms that the model is not just suitable for coding but also for all your other needs. They claim it’s an all-rounder. 🤷‍♂️</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/22b0a4ffg37ev7w9o7we.png" alt=""></figure>



<p>This is all cool, and I’ll confirm the claim, but in this article, I will mainly be comparing the model on coding, and let’s see how well it performs compared to Claude 3.7 Sonnet.</p>



<h2 id="h-coding-problems">Coding Problems</h2>



<p>Let’s compare these two models in coding. We’ll do a total of 4 tests, mainly on WebDev, animation and a tricky LeetCode question.</p>



<h3 id="h-1-flight-simulator">1. Flight Simulator</h3>



<p><strong>Prompt:</strong> Create a simple flight simulator using JavaScript. The simulator should feature a basic plane that can take off from a flat runway. The plane’s movement should be controlled with simple keyboard inputs (e.g., arrow keys or WASD). Additionally, it generates a basic cityscape using blocky structures, similar to Minecraft.</p>



<p><strong>Response from Gemini 2.5 Pro</strong></p>



<p>You can find the code it generated here: <a href="https://gist.github.com/shricodev/5fc44c03fde651f5bea7008919377c1d">Link</a></p>



<p>Here’s the output of the program:</p>



<figure><video controls="" src="https://composio.dev/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/flight_sim_gemini_2-1.mp4"></video></figure>



<p>I definitely got exactly what I asked for, with everything functioning, from plane movements to the basic Minecraft-styled block buildings. I can’t really complain about anything here. 10/10 for this one. </p>



<p><strong>Response from Claude 3.7 Sonnet</strong></p>



<p>You can find the code it generated here: <a href="https://gist.github.com/shricodev/b22a2d583f1a56beb2df2dcf636a1a88">Link</a></p>



<p>Here’s the output of the program:</p>



<figure><video controls="" src="https://composio.dev/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/flight_sim_claude.mp4"></video></figure>



<p>I can see some issues with this one. The plane clearly faces sideways, and I don’t know why. Again, it was out of control once it took off and went clearly outside the city. Basically, I’d say we didn’t really get a completely working flight simulator here.</p>



<p><strong>Summary:</strong></p>



<p>It’s fair to say that Gemini 2.5 really got this correct in one shot. But the issues with the Claude 3.7 Sonnet code aren’t really that big to resolve. Yeah, we didn’t really get the output as expected, and it’s definitely not close to what Gemini 2.5 Pro got us.</p>



<h3 id="h-2-rubik-s-cube-solver">2. Rubik’s Cube Solver</h3>



<p>This is one of the toughest questions for LLMs. I’ve tried it with many other LLMs, but none could correct it. Let’s see how these two models do this one.</p>



<p><strong>Prompt:</strong> Build a simple 3D Rubik’s Cube visualizer and solver in JavaScript using Three.js. The cube should be a 3×3 Rubik’s Cube with standard colours. Have a scramble button that randomly scrambles the cube. Include a solve function that animates the solution step by step. Allow basic mouse controls to rotate the view.</p>



<p><strong>Response from Gemini 2.5 Pro</strong></p>



<p>You can find the code it generated here: <a href="https://gist.github.com/shricodev/1c7ed9967d03c6f5f9b8fd2ad46bcba1">Link</a></p>



<p>Here’s the output of the program:</p>



<figure><video controls="" src="https://composio.dev/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/rubiks_cube_gemini_2.mp4"></video></figure>



<p>It’s impressive that it could do something this hard in one shot. With the 1 million token context window, I can truly see how powerful this model seems to be.</p>



<p><strong>Response from Claude 3.7 Sonnet</strong></p>



<p>You can find the code it generated here: <a href="https://gist.github.com/shricodev/e4c12edb3384323be43f1196522eb6f2">Link</a></p>



<p>Here’s the output of the program:</p>



<figure><video controls="" src="https://composio.dev/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/rubiks_cube_claude_3.7.mp4"></video></figure>



<p>Again, I was kind of disappointed that it had the same issue as some other LLMs: failing with the colours and completely failing to solve the cube. I did try to help it come up with the answer, but it didn’t really help.</p>



<p><strong>Summary:</strong></p>



<p>Here again, Gemini 2.5 Pro takes the lead. And the best part is that all of it was done in one shot. Claude 3.7 was really disappointing, as it could not get this one correct, despite being one of the finest coding models out there.</p>



<h3 id="h-3-ball-bouncing-inside-a-spinning-4d-tesseract">3. Ball Bouncing Inside a Spinning 4D Tesseract</h3>



<p><strong>Prompt:</strong> Create a simple JavaScript script that visualizes a ball bouncing inside a rotating 4D tesseract. When the ball collides with a side, highlight that side to indicate the impact.</p>



<p><strong>Response from Gemini 2.5 Pro</strong></p>



<p>You can find the code it generated here: <a href="https://gist.github.com/shricodev/866c2207af82416edfb240818c3ddf73">Link</a></p>



<p>Here’s the output of the program:</p>



<figure><video controls="" src="https://composio.dev/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/gemini_2.5_tesserect.mp4"></video></figure>



<p>I cannot notice a single issue in the output. The ball and the collision physics all work perfectly, even the part where I asked it to highlight the collision side works. This free model seems to be insane for coding. 🔥</p>



<p><strong>Response from Claude 3.7 Sonnet</strong></p>



<p>You can find the code it generated here: <a href="https://gist.github.com/shricodev/b54d5b5bda033f6784637c19c50a845b">Link</a></p>



<p>Here’s the output of the program:</p>



<figure><video controls="" src="https://composio.dev/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/claude-bouncing-ball-1.mp4"></video></figure>



<p>Wow, finally, Claude 3.7 Sonnet got an answer correct. It also added colors to each side, but who asked for it? 🤷‍♂️ Nevertheless, I can’t really complain much here, as the main functionality seems to work just fine.</p>



<p><strong>Summary:</strong></p>



<p>The answer is evident this time. Both models got the answer correct, implementing everything I asked for. I won’t really say that I like the output of Claude 3.7 Sonnet more, but it definitely put in quite some work compared to Gemini 2.5 Pro.</p>



<h3 id="h-4-leetcode-problem">4. LeetCode Problem</h3>



<p>For this one, let’s do a quick LeetCode check with to see how these models handle solving a tricky LeetCode question with an <strong>acceptance rate of just 14.9%</strong>: <a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-value-sum-by-placing-three-rooks-i/description/">Maximum Value Sum by Placing 3 Rooks</a>.</p>



<p>Claude 3.7 Sonnet is known to be super good at solving LC questions. If you want to see how <strong>Claude 3.7</strong> compares to some top models like <strong>Grok 3</strong> and <strong>o3-mini-high</strong>, check out this blog post:</p>

<span></span>
<span></span></code></pre></div>



<p><strong>Response from Gemini 2.5 Pro</strong></p>



<p>Given how easily it answered all three of the coding questions we tested, I have quite high hopes for this model.</p>



<p>You can find the code it generated here: <a href="https://gist.github.com/shricodev/6e1fd99d04a10a3ff7d82934770387d7">Link</a></p>



<p>It did take quite some time to answer this one, though, and the code it wrote is kind of super complex to make sense of. I think it answered it more complicated than required. But still, the main thing we’re looking for is to see if it can answer it correctly.</p>



<p>As expected, it also answered this tough LeetCode question in one shot. This is one of the questions I got stuck on when learning DSA. I’m not sure if I’m happy it did. </p>



<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/avp4adkc0d9gij4bff8d.png" alt=""></figure>



<p><strong>Response from Claude 3.7 Sonnet</strong></p>



<p>I hope this model will crush this one, as in all the other coding tests I’ve done, Claude 3.7 Sonnet has answered all of the LeetCode questions correctly.</p>



<p>You can find the code it generated here: <a href="https://gist.github.com/shricodev/5730c52c5b057cd2098d4a04674338b6">Link</a></p>



<p>It did write correct code but got TLE, but if I have to compare the code’s simplicity, I’d say this model made the code simpler and easier to understand.</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/fxxc2mfzbcvmt3anak3n.png" alt=""></figure>



<p><strong>Summary:</strong></p>



<p>Gemini 2.5 got the answer correct and also wrote the code in the expected time complexity, but Claude 3.7 Sonnet fell into TLE. If I have to compare the code simplicity, Claude 3.7’s generated code seems to be better.</p>



<h2 id="h-conclusion">Conclusion</h2>



<p>For me, Gemini 2.5 Pro is the winner. We’ve compared two models that are said to be the best at coding. The big difference I see in the model stats is just that Gemini 2.5 Pro has a slightly higher context window, but let’s not forget that this is an experimental model, and improvements are still on the way.</p>



<p>Imagine this model’s performance after a <strong>2M token context window.</strong></p>



<p>Google’s been killing it recently with such solid models, previously with the Gemma 3 27B model, a super lightweight model with unbelievable results, and now with this beast of a model, Gemini 2.5 Pro.</p>



<p>By the way, if you are here, Composio is building the skill repository for agents. You can connect LLMs to any application from Gmail to Asana and get things done quickly. You can use <a href="https://mcp.composio.dev/">MCP servers</a>, or directly add the <a href="https://docs.composio.dev/tool-calling/introduction">tools to LLMs</a> in the traditional agentic way.</p>

					<div>
					<p>The demoscene has become <a href="https://levandekulturarv.se/forteckningen/element/demoscenen">a national UNESCO-heritage in Sweden</a>, thanks to an application that <a href="https://scenesat.com/">Ziphoid</a> and me did last year. This has already happened in several European countries, as part of the international <a href="https://demoscene-the-art-of-coding.net/">Art of Coding</a> initiative to make the demoscene a global UNESCO heritage. I think this makes plenty of sense, since the demoscene is arguably&nbsp;the oldest creative digital subculture around. It has largely stuck to its own values and traditions throughout the world’s technological and economical shifts, and that sort of consistency is quite unusual in the digital world.</p>
<p>The main idea of the demoscene is to compete with productions that maximize a certain hardware, but that’s not what all demosceners like to do. My demogroup <a href="https://demozoo.org/groups/10273/">Hack n’ Trade</a> for example, cares more about making weird stuff, and there are plenty of other groups like that. Some demosceners don’t release anything at all, but might do important work to keep the scene alive (BBS-trading, organizing parties, preserving software…).</p>
<p>I’ve written plenty of <a href="https://goto80.com/writing">papers</a> and <a href="https://chipflip.wordpress.com/">blog posts</a> about the demoscene, and I’ve often felt a gap between the stuff I write as a researcher and my personal experience of the demoscene. There is certainly an international demoscene with big events and huge releases that can be described in general terms, but what has mattered more to me is the local scenes, the small parties and the people you hang out with. Meeting up with a bunch of friends and making weird computer stuff “for no reason, really” is a great setting. That’s what I enjoy the most, in the end. For other sceners, it’s different.</p>
<p>There is a sort of diversity in the scene that is difficult to capture and generalize. The Swedish coder with a well-paid programming job and a busy family life might consider the demoscene as an escape to his teenage years, while the LSD-munching raver from France who trades illegal warez on BBSs and makes weird pixel art considers the scene as a free culture without corporate or art world bullshit. There’s room for both in the scene, because it is werdly conservative and open at the same time. And perhaps that is one of the reasons why it should be considered an intangible heritage.</p>

<p dir="auto">This is a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for WhatsApp.</p>
<p dir="auto">With this you can search you personal Whatsapp messages, search your contacts and send messages to either individuals or groups.</p>
<p dir="auto">It connects to your <strong>personal WhatsApp account</strong> directly via the Whatsapp web multidevice API (using the <a href="https://github.com/tulir/whatsmeow">whatsmeow</a> library). All your messages are stored locally in a SQLite database and only sent to an LLM (such as Claude) when the agent accesses them through tools (which you control).</p>
<p dir="auto">Here's an example of what you can do when it's connected to Claude.</p>

<p dir="auto">This application consists of two main components:</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Go WhatsApp Bridge</strong> (<code>whatsapp-bridge/</code>): A Go application that connects to WhatsApp's web API, handles authentication via QR code, and stores message history in SQLite. It serves as the bridge between WhatsApp and the MCP server.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Python MCP Server</strong> (<code>whatsapp-mcp-server/</code>): A Python server implementing the Model Context Protocol (MCP), which provides standardized tools for Claude to interact with WhatsApp data and send/receive messages.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Data Storage</h3><a id="user-content-data-storage" aria-label="Permalink: Data Storage" href="#data-storage"></a></p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>All message history is stored in a SQLite database within the <code>whatsapp-bridge/store/</code> directory</li>
<li>The database maintains tables for chats and messages</li>
<li>Messages are indexed for efficient searching and retrieval</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Usage</h2><a id="user-content-usage" aria-label="Permalink: Usage" href="#usage"></a></p>

<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">MCP Tools</h3><a id="user-content-mcp-tools" aria-label="Permalink: MCP Tools" href="#mcp-tools"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Claude can access the following tools to interact with WhatsApp:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><strong>search_contacts</strong>: Search for contacts by name or phone number</li>
<li><strong>list_messages</strong>: Retrieve messages with optional filters and context</li>
<li><strong>list_chats</strong>: List available chats with metadata</li>
<li><strong>get_chat</strong>: Get information about a specific chat</li>
<li><strong>get_direct_chat_by_contact</strong>: Find a direct chat with a specific contact</li>
<li><strong>get_contact_chats</strong>: List all chats involving a specific contact</li>
<li><strong>get_last_interaction</strong>: Get the most recent message with a contact</li>
<li><strong>get_message_context</strong>: Retrieve context around a specific message</li>
<li><strong>send_message</strong>: Send a WhatsApp message to a specified phone number</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Technical Details</h2><a id="user-content-technical-details" aria-label="Permalink: Technical Details" href="#technical-details"></a></p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>Claude sends requests to the Python MCP server</li>
<li>The MCP server queries the Go bridge for WhatsApp data or directly to the SQLite database</li>
<li>The Go accesses the WhatsApp API and keeps the SQLite database up to date</li>
<li>Data flows back through the chain to Claude</li>
<li>When sending messages, the request flows from Claude through the MCP server to the Go bridge and to WhatsApp</li>
</ol>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Troubleshooting</h2><a id="user-content-troubleshooting" aria-label="Permalink: Troubleshooting" href="#troubleshooting"></a></p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>If you encounter permission issues when running uv, you may need to add it to your PATH or use the full path to the executable.</li>
<li>Make sure both the Go application and the Python server are running for the integration to work properly.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Authentication Issues</h3><a id="user-content-authentication-issues" aria-label="Permalink: Authentication Issues" href="#authentication-issues"></a></p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><strong>QR Code Not Displaying</strong>: If the QR code doesn't appear, try restarting the authentication script. If issues persist, check if your terminal supports displaying QR codes.</li>
<li><strong>WhatsApp Already Logged In</strong>: If your session is already active, the Go bridge will automatically reconnect without showing a QR code.</li>
<li><strong>Device Limit Reached</strong>: WhatsApp limits the number of linked devices. If you reach this limit, you'll need to remove an existing device from WhatsApp on your phone (Settings &gt; Linked Devices).</li>
<li><strong>No Messages Loading</strong>: After initial authentication, it can take several minutes for your message history to load, especially if you have many chats.</li>
<li><strong>WhatsApp Out of Sync</strong>: If your WhatsApp messages get out of sync with the bridge, delete both database files (<code>whatsapp-bridge/store/messages.db</code> and <code>whatsapp-bridge/store/whatsapp.db</code>) and restart the bridge to re-authenticate.</li>
</ul>

</div><h4>&nbsp;By Tony Bartelme</h4><p><em><a href="mailto:tbartelme@postandcourier.com">tbartelme@postandcourier.com</a></em></p><h4>1. DECISION</h4><p>A dark mass of clouds hung low over North Charleston as Marine Col. Charles "Tre" Del Pizzo began his descent. It was a Sunday afternoon, late September 2023. Del Pizzo's hands were on the control stick and throttle of an F-35B Lightning II, the U.S. military’s most advanced stealth fighter, a $136 million supercomputer with wings. The F-35B can hover like a helicopter, and Del Pizzo planned to use that technology to land.</p><p>Del Pizzo had just finished a training sortie over the Atlantic with a second F-35B pilot, practicing tactics at upwards of 500 mph at seven times the force of gravity. He needed to experience this jet’s strengths and weaknesses. At 48, he was a full bird colonel getting ready to command a squadron in Yuma, Ariz., a high-visibility assignment to fine-tune the Marines’ aviation strategies and procedures, including those for the F-35B.</p><p>As he closed in on Charleston Air Force Base, he knew he’d hit some bumps. Forecasters earlier had said the weather would improve, but the opposite happened. Heavy clouds moved in like a big gray curtain. He shot through some turbulence, streaks of precipitation on the canopy, zero visibility. He’d use his instruments to get through it all. No big deal. Pilots do instrument landings all the time in crud like this.</p><p>And the F-35 was packed with instruments, cameras and sensors&nbsp;— all feeding a torrent of data into computers linked to his <a href="https://www.postandcourier.com/news/special_reports/f35-crashes-sc-ejection-stealth-fighter-jet/article_5be03418-2809-11ef-9c5c-9f4069551d75.html" target="_blank">$400,000 helmet display</a>. The helmet itself was an engineering wonder, custom built for each pilot. It had a dark visor that displayed the jet’s speed, altitude and targeting information, all of which moved with his head. The jet had cameras mounted on the bottom of the plane that streamed videos to the visor. If he looked down, this fusion of data and optics allowed him to see through the plane’s smooth shark-gray shell.</p><p>Suddenly, at 1:32:05 p.m., his helmet flickered. What was that? The plane seemed to be OK. Then the visor erupted in flashes of alerts. Failures in flight control systems, avionics, cooling, navigation, GPS, communications. Audio alerts sounded: whoop, whoop, whoop. Then the helmet and main displays went dark; the audio alerts stopped. About 15 seconds had passed.</p><p>Military aviators are taught to make quick decisions using an “OODA Loop”— observe, orient, decide and act. The goal is to cycle through the loop’s four phases faster than your opponent. In this case, Del Pizzo’s opponents were the weather and his jet. The helmet display flashed back on. He ran a loop. Observe, orient: Jet still in the clouds, about 750 feet above ground, still in his control, descending glide path, about 800 feet per minute. Decide, act: Execute a missed approach procedure and get away from the ground.&nbsp;</p><p>He pulled back the stick to climb, pushed the throttle forward for thrust.&nbsp;Raised the landing gear. Pressed a button that converts the jet from vertical mode to conventional. Then the helmet display went dark again, as if rebooting. He tried to radio his wingman, the control tower. Nothing. Coms out. Then it flashed on, along with another thunderstorm of alerts, more than 25 messages telling him that the jet was in deep trouble and getting worse. Whoop, whoop, whoop.</p><p>About 30 seconds had passed.</p><p>The helmet and main display failed a third time, differently now, as if powering down for good. Instruments gone, a sea of gray outside his window. Is the plane responding? He pulled the throttle back. He glanced at the small backup panel between his legs. He heard what sounded like a motor spooling down. The engine? He felt the nose of the aircraft tilt upward. He felt a falling sensation. He still couldn’t see the ground. Was he still over the base? Over the trees?</p><p>Forty-one seconds. Decide, act: <em>The jet’s going into the trees, and I’m going with it.</em> In one quick motion, he reached between his legs for the yellow handle, put his left hand over his right wrist.</p><p>And pulled.</p><div><figure>

To make quicker ones, pilots train like professional athletes, doing rep after rep until important decisions are intuitive and instantaneous.</p><p>Effective procedures are key. At their essence, procedures are based on actions people took in the past that proved to be good ones, decisions worth repeating in the future, especially under pressure. Having procedures in place also means that when something goes sideways you’re protected, not punished&nbsp;— as long as you followed those preset rules. All this makes you and your unit faster and more confident warfighters, especially in combat, when second-guessing can be fatal.</p><p>This was the system Del Pizzo grew up in, the system he followed as a young Marine flying AV-8B Harriers. It’s the system he trusted while training and flying more than 2,800 hours in 12 different military aircraft, 759 hours in combat. The system that led to a stream of promotions, to decorations like the Defense Superior Service Medal, Legion of Merit, Bronze Star, 19 Air Medals. It’s the system that propelled him to a coveted command assignment. One that had his superiors saying he could someday make general. A system that gave him a profound sense of belonging that only other Marines really understand. <em>Semper fi.</em></p><p>And after those 41 seconds in the cockpit of a failing stealth fighter, it’s a system that betrayed him.</p><p>His story, shared here for the first time, details his journey back into the cockpit after the mishap, and then how that journey suddenly ended when the Marines relieved him of command more than a year after he pulled the ejection handle. His story answers many questions about what happened that stormy Sunday afternoon in 2023 over North Charleston, but also raises new ones with stakes that go beyond his mishap: Did the Marines create a dangerous precedent by relieving Del Pizzo? One that makes pilots hesitate to punch out of a malfunctioning aircraft?</p><p>And, from another altitude: As everything from cars to fighter jets become more dependent on technology, who’s to blame when those machines fail you?</p><div><figure><span data-toggle="modal" data-photo-target=".photo-d7032fe7-ccf5-4a4f-a52a-2ab81c5af409" data-instance="#gallery-items-80d55e4a-f600-11ef-8ef4-03f14319ce57-photo-modal" data-target="#photo-carousel-80d55e4a-f600-11ef-8ef4-03f14319ce57">

        </figure></div><h4>3. FLYER</h4><p>Del Pizzo always wanted to fly. You can see the proof in the old photos. They’re displayed on the laptop he opened recently on the countertop of a mostly empty house near Washington, D.C.</p><p>There he was in a time-faded snapshot, age 2 or 3, smiling in a cockpit of a retired A-4 Skyhawk at a Florida air base, the same jet his father flew in Vietnam. A huge white helmet covered the boy’s bright red hair.</p><p>And in another shot, about the same age, swallowed up by his dad’s khaki uniform shirt with his Navy wings and ribbons. And there in a third photo, grinning even more in his dad’s Navy dress jacket, his father holding him and smiling, too.</p><p>Del Pizzo looked away from the laptop. Around him, the house had an echo that empty houses have. He and his family will move in soon. After 31 years in the Marines, he’d finally retired, honorable discharge. He’d arrived that morning after driving from Yuma in a rented U-Haul, his Jeep towed behind.</p><p>Del Pizzo is a thin man with thick hair that’s still red. He doesn’t quite fit the movie star version of the cocky fighter jet jock. He’s confident but freely tosses out self-deprecating jokes. He speaks more easily about others in his life than himself. Like his grandfather.</p><p>Next to his laptop on the kitchen counter was the metal canteen cup his grandfather carried in World War II, hand-etched with the European countries he marched through under Gen. George Patton’s command. “He was a poor Italian kid in Philly who married the rich Irish girl he met at church, one of those guys who could hear a song once and then play it on the piano without taking lessons.”</p><p>Growing up, Del Pizzo thought he’d end up in the Navy like his father. “My dad could fix anything on the car. You know, it's funny what you lose in generations — like I have no Italian language skills, no car-fixing skills. But I guess I got the pilot gene.”</p><div><figure><span data-toggle="modal" data-photo-target=".photo-51587d30-1f24-52a9-8017-2cd2bfcc48f4" data-instance="#gallery-items-80d55e4a-f600-11ef-8ef4-03f14319ce57-photo-modal" data-target="#photo-carousel-80d55e4a-f600-11ef-8ef4-03f14319ce57">

My dad loved flying, and I don’t remember a time in my life growing up that I didn’t want to fly jets just like my dad.”</p><p>At 17, he did boot camp at Parris Island in South Carolina, but he still thought he'd end up in the Navy like his father. From boot camp, he went to Auburn University, mixing college with military training during summers. He also made a course correction. The Marines offered him a faster route to flying jets than the Navy. After graduating with a degree in criminal justice, he flew straight into flight school in Pensacola, Fla.</p><p>By then, he already had his pilot’s license, and his love of flight only grew as he logged more time in the air: the eerie night skies, the early mornings when you broke through the cloud bank and saw the rising sun resting on top of it. It might be raining and dark below, but above it was wonderful.</p><p>“When I'm in the air, I feel like that's where I'm supposed to be.

        </figure></div><h4>4. COMBAT</h4><p>By 25, he was flying Harriers, the jump jet created by Great Britain, a stubby, muscular aircraft that was the first fighter to take off and land vertically like a helicopter. His call sign was “Cheez,” which loosely rhymed with the way he pronounced Del Pizzo (Peezo).&nbsp;The Harrier’s ability to hover allowed pilots to land without runways. But they were beasts to fly.</p><p>During the Harrier’s first two decades of service, at least <a href="https://newslit.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/LA-Times-_Marines-Lose-One-Third-of-Harrier-Fleet_.pdf" target="_blank">45 Marines</a> died in noncombat incidents, making it one of the military’s most dangerous&nbsp;airplanes to fly. Over time, the Marines made adjustments and improved procedures, and the mishap rate <a href="https://www.usni.org/magazines/proceedings/2024/july/lessons-harrier" target="_blank">declined.</a> But the Corps still typically picked the most skilled pilots to fly these finicky birds.</p><p>In 2003, Del Pizzo was deployed to the Middle East for Operation Iraqi Freedom. It was his first combat deployment, and his father met him just as he was about to leave. They hadn’t talked much about Vietnam, so he was a little surprised when his father hugged him and said: “You know, I went to war so you wouldn’t have to.”</p><p>But soon Del Pizzo was crossing into Iraqi airspace with 11 other Harriers and hundreds of U.S. and allied aircraft. The sun had just set. The darkening sky was filled with Iraqi long-range artillery shells flying over them. Ballistic missiles headed toward them. He saw explosions over a hill where Marines on the ground breached a defense. But when it came time to drop his 1,000-pound bomb, it wouldn’t release, stuck because something was too tight. OODA Loop time. Observe: Bomb still there. Orient: Plane OK. Decide, act: Continue with the mission and get the jet back to the base.</p><p>Roughly a decade later, he was flying a Harrier to New Mexico for an exercise. At about 25,000 feet, a fire broke out in the avionics bay, frying the plane's electronics, radar, main displays and systems that stabilized the plane. He worked with air traffic controllers to guide him in, and he landed without incident.&nbsp;</p><p>Military aviators who knew him said he had an uncanny ability to stay “ahead of the jet”&nbsp;— calmly manage a flood of information about targets, threats, troops on the ground, while piloting a plane at 500 mph. “If you were flying north into Iraq, he was the guy you wanted to lead the mission,” said Guy Berry, a retired Marine lieutenant colonel and former Harrier pilot.</p><p>Time passed, and Del Pizzo’s trajectory through the Marine Corps moved upward and steady: deployments to Afghanistan, Kuwait and Japan; deployments to Bahrain for combat missions into Syria for Operation Inherent Resolve. He flew Harriers off amphibious assault ships. At the Pentagon, he was assigned to the Joint Chiefs of Staff working on Southeast Asia policy, and with Navy staff on amphibious expedition warfare. He worked in the F-35 Joint Program Office, where he served as the senior Marine representative and at Marine Headquarters. His mentors included Marine generals.</p><p>In 2022, he was selected to take command of Marine Operational Test and Evaluation Squadron 1 in Yuma, referred to as VMX-1. It was a choice assignment where Marines test their aircraft to make sure procedures and standards work in real-world scenarios.</p><p>To Del Pizzo, commanding VMX-1 would be the pinnacle of his career as a military aviator. Good procedures and standards tested in Yuma could save Marines’ lives in the field. But he wouldn’t formally take command that year. The Marines were short of colonels, and he was assigned more duties at the Pentagon. In the interim, he also needed to learn how to fly the F-35B. And to do that, he traveled to Beaufort.</p><div><figure><span data-toggle="modal" data-photo-target=".photo-56304bcf-f7d0-4fab-8a2d-76d6f04fb372" data-instance="#gallery-items-80d55e4a-f600-11ef-8ef4-03f14319ce57-photo-modal" data-target="#photo-carousel-80d55e4a-f600-11ef-8ef4-03f14319ce57">

A slight rise offers a brief view of runways and khaki outdoor canopies shading F-35Bs. A sign at the base entrance says, "The 'noise' you hear is the sound of freedom."</p><p>It’s one of two Marine F-35B training centers, with the second in San Diego. It has advanced simulators and a time-tested curriculum. “Hands down, it was the best training I’d ever had, world-class,” Del Pizzo said.</p><p>He flew an F-35B for the first time in April 2023, returning to the Beaufort base with a smile on his face. The jet was the most impressive machine he’d ever flown, a mind meld with computers and brute force.</p><p>As a future commander of VMX-1, he needed to know as much about the F-35B as possible. The F-35 is the military’s most ambitious weapons system, a <a href="https://www.gao.gov/blog/f-35-will-now-exceed-2-trillion-military-plans-fly-it-less" target="_blank">$2 trillion</a> investment over the next 50 years in the nation’s air defense capabilities. The jet has three variations: the F-35A, used mainly by the Air Force; the F-35B, which can hover; and the F-35C, which has a more robust structure for carrier landings. All three variants have a stealthy shape and advanced composite shells to evade enemy radar.</p><p>But its real value is in the electronics inside; computers and sensors take over some of the pilot’s duties, so pilots become quarterbacks, directing other planes to their targets or serving as forward spotters for ground artillery.&nbsp;</p><p>But complex systems can come with potential flaws; because these systems build on one another, failures can propagate like a virus.</p><div><figure>

    </div><h4>5. THE FALL </h4><p>After you pull the <a href="https://www.postandcourier.com/news/special_reports/ejection-seat-whats-it-like-fighter-jet/article_6ce2e270-4e91-11ef-be20-6b8fa536919f.html" target="_blank">ejection handle</a> on a fighter jet, straps on the seat instantly pin your arms and legs so they don’t flail when you hit the slipstream. Air bags inflate around your neck and head. A line of explosives above your head shatters the canopy. Rockets on the seat fire, launching you and the seat with a force 18 times greater than gravity. By the time the chute opens, only 3 seconds have passed.</p><p>Fighter pilots know that about one of 10 ejections lead to death, and one out of 3 end up with spinal damage or other severe injuries.</p><p>When&nbsp;Del Pizzo&nbsp;pulled the handle, he heard a bang like a shotgun shell. Shards of metal dug into his neck from the explosives that blasted the canopy apart.</p><p>“The next thing I remember, as I began to come up the seat rail, my helmet and mask got ripped off in the wind stream, ripped straight off my face.&nbsp;</p><p>“I remember feeling the precipitation on my face, and then just being pulled back as the drogue chute opened and slowed me down.” (A drogue chute is a small parachute that stops the pilot from tumbling.)</p><p>“And I could hear the engine noise from the airplane. With my helmet off, it was pretty loud. What I heard was complete chaos. Things falling around me. And that's when I thought the airplane is going to come down and hit me, because I felt like the airplane was out of control, right? I thought&nbsp;the airplane is going to hit me, and I'm going to die here in this parachute.”</p><p>He wouldn’t learn until much later that after he ejected, the jet converted from its vertical mode to conventional and kept flying.</p><p>A few more seconds passed, and he dropped below the clouds. Another OODA Loop. Observe, orient: He could see the ground now, but no sign of the plane crash; he was above a neighborhood, heading toward power lines. Decide, act: A survival kit attached to a lanyard dangled below him; he released it to avoid snagging in the wires; he reached up for the chute’s toggles and steered toward a house. He aimed for a backyard about the size of an average living room.</p><p>He landed by the back fence, his chute tangling in the trees. It was raining. His back hurt. He walked to the house’s backdoor and knocked.</p><p>A shocked family opened the door.</p><p>“They were looking at me in my wet flight suit in their backyard, with me telling them I needed to call 911.”</p><p>After a moment, a woman and her son ushered him into the kitchen. The father helped Del Pizzo stop some bleeding from the shrapnel wounds. The son called 911, and after briefly talking to the dispatcher, handed Del Pizzo the phone.</p><p>“I’m the pilot,” Del Pizzo can be heard saying in the <a href="https://www.postandcourier.com/f35-pilot-ejection-911-call-from-resident-copy/video_fa7ddf6c-7462-11ef-a78e-173b3807343e.html" target="_blank">recording</a>. “We need to get rescue rolling. I’m not sure where the airplane is. It would have crash-landed somewhere. I ejected.”</p><p>The dispatcher was slow to understand, and Del Pizzo said it was unfair to criticize her, as some on social media did after news organizations posted the 911 recording. What happened was highly unusual, he said. Something that dispatchers probably wouldn’t see in their own training. Uppermost in his mind as he talked to the dispatcher and arriving paramedics: What happened to the jet?</p><p>“My biggest fear was that I’d hurt someone.”</p><p>Paramedics loaded him in an ambulance, and they sped to the Medical University of South Carolina in downtown Charleston. During the trip, he accidentally pocket-dialed his eldest teenage son, who could only hear voices and sirens in the background.</p><p>At some point, he called his wife, Jessica, who was at their youngest son’s flag football game. He knew that mishaps trigger investigations. Protocols required him to keep details at a minimum. So the conversation was short on specifics, mainly that he was alive.</p><p>In the ambulance, he kept asking if the plane crash had hurt anyone. No, the paramedics told him, there was no word of a crash. Same thing in the hospital.</p><p>“I thought the plane would come down in someone’s backyard, or hit someone’s house, and that horrified me.”</p><p>But why wasn’t there any news? An ejected pilot without a plane crash? It was like a surreal riddle. He was so baffled that at one point he turned to a doctor.</p><p>“I asked, ‘Am I dead?’ No one could give me any information about the airplane.”</p><p>There, in the emergency room, he also learned he’d broken his back.</p><div><figure><span data-toggle="modal" data-photo-target=".photo-0eb7e6a2-ff3d-11ef-a5f1-b750abf11c34" data-instance="#gallery-items-80d55e4a-f600-11ef-8ef4-03f14319ce57-photo-modal" data-target="#photo-carousel-80d55e4a-f600-11ef-8ef4-03f14319ce57">

MYSTERY</h4><p>In military aviation circles, an unintended incident that leads to a death, injury or significant property damage is called a “mishap”&nbsp;—&nbsp;not an accident&nbsp;— and mishaps trigger a cascade of investigations. The probes into Del Pizzo’s mishap were especially sensitive given the secrecy of the F-35’s stealth technology and capabilities, and what happened after he ejected.</p><p>Instead of the smoking hole he expected below him, the jet climbed at a 5-degree angle to about 9,300 feet, then descended in a long right turn. It flew for 11 minutes and 21 seconds, an average speed of at least 350 mph. In Williamsburg County, the jet clipped the tops of trees. The jet crashed near a swamp and fields in a community called Indianland. Investigators later pegged its speed on impact at 635 mph.</p><p>In heavily redacted documents later released by the military, investigators also described an “electrical malfunction” that knocked out radios, tactical navigation systems, landing guidance systems and a key transponder that would have automatically sent the jet’s location to air traffic controllers. The loss of that tracking device and the jet’s stealthy design made it more difficult to pinpoint the crash site.</p><p>Hours passed without news of a crash. The void created an opening, especially on social media. It didn’t help when an Air Force spokesperson sought help from the public. A stealth fighter missing? Memes popped up with a sign on a telephone pole, with a photo of an F-35 and a caption: “Have you seen this plane?” Could the military really lose such a connected plane?</p><p>In the hospital, Del Pizzo suspected an electrically charged media storm was brewing outside. A Marine buddy showed up after driving all night from North Carolina.</p><p>“He was following things on social media and said, ‘You’re trending on Twitter.’ I laughed, and then he said: ‘No, it’s not you. It’s the airplane.’ ”</p><p>His wife, Jessica, soon arrived.</p><p>“He’s not on social media much, but I took away his phone,” she recalled. “I didn’t want him to see those memes.”</p><p>At one point, Del Pizzo heard the commandant of the Marines, Gen. Eric M. Smith, wanted to speak with him. That surprised Del Pizzo.&nbsp;Maybe it was merely an effort to express concern to a fellow Marine. But such a conversation could go against standard protocols to keep investigations as objective and influence-free as possible.</p><p>“I think it was surrounding some of the things going on in the media at the time,” Del Pizzo said, “and maybe he wanted some answers.”</p><p>He learned later that a senior officer persuaded Smith not to talk to him. It was a hint of the mishap’s sensitivity and the trouble to come.</p><p>After about 24 hours without a crash site location, a South Carolina&nbsp;Civil Air Patrol team identified a promising target near Hemingway based on its analysis of radar pings. Search teams moved in. Residents told them they’d heard a loud bang and flash that Sunday afternoon. A military fire official noted scorched trees near Boggy Swamp and found the debris, closing one loop.</p><p>But more questions lingered as military workers sealed off the site: Why did Del Pizzo eject when the plane continued to fly? Had something gone wrong with the plane's technology?&nbsp;Did Del Pizzo punch out too early?</p><p>Against this backdrop, Del Pizzo and his wife left the hospital, him in a back brace. He had cracked vertebrae in his lower and middle back, but doctors said his prognosis was good. After a night in a local hotel, they went to Charleston International Airport and waited for a flight back to Washington, D.C.</p><p>“It was good to get out of that area because so many people were talking about it,” Jessica Del Pizzo recalled. “But I remember that at the airport we looked at each other and said how weird it was to be getting in an airplane.”</p><div><figure><span data-toggle="modal" data-photo-target=".photo-5987113f-fc90-46e2-a067-2ffc02ca24d6" data-instance="#gallery-items-80d55e4a-f600-11ef-8ef4-03f14319ce57-photo-modal" data-target="#photo-carousel-80d55e4a-f600-11ef-8ef4-03f14319ce57">

LESSONS </h4><p>Three separate investigations would explore what happened and why, each with a different focus.</p><p>A Navy Aviation Mishap Board had teams of F-35 aviators, engineers and experts. Its goal was to identify mistakes and weaknesses, and draw up lessons to prevent future mishaps. Underlying the board’s work were legal protections that prevented superiors from punishing pilots and crews for anything they told investigators. Results of this investigation aren’t released to the public.</p><p>The second investigation was the Field Flight Performance Board. Its main aim: Look at the pilot's actions.&nbsp;Led by a senior F-35 pilot, it also included experienced military aviators and experts. The board's report typically isn't released to the public.</p><p>The third was the Marines’ <a href="https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/postandcourier.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/4/46/446c318c-97b8-11ef-b000-fbe8827d168d/6723d0738533f.pdf.pdf" target="_blank">Command Investigation</a>. A senior officer handled this one.&nbsp;These probes usually have a limited scope. Their goal is primarily legal: to determine whether a pilot engaged in misconduct. Results of this investigation can be released to the public.</p><p>The first two investigations came to similar conclusions, according to Del Pizzo, officials knowledgeable about the reports’ contents and documents obtained by The Post and Courier through open records laws: Del Pizzo’s aircraft experienced a significant electrical malfunction, one that knocked out key systems&nbsp;— including displays and navigation aids he needed to land in severe weather. Knobs to radios weren’t working, making it difficult to contact air traffic controllers or his wingman for guidance. A small backup display was partially functional, but Del Pizzo had to look down to see it.</p><p>This and the zero-visibility conditions likely contributed to a phenomenon known as spatial disorientation, where your inner ear tricks you into feeling that you’re dizzy or falling.</p><p>Both investigations noted that nothing in the military’s training and simulator work prepared pilots for a crescendo of systems failures in severe weather at a low altitude. In fact, the F-35B’s flight manual said, “the aircraft is considered to be in out of controlled flight (OCF) when it fails to respond properly to pilot inputs,” adding, “if out of control below 6,000 feet AGL (above ground level): EJECT.”</p><p>Both investigations concluded that most highly experienced pilots with similar levels of experience in an F-35 would have punched out of the plane.</p><p>The Field Flight Performance Board lauded Del Pizzo’s record and potential to move on after the mishap.</p><p>“Colonel Del Pizzo is a career-long high performing naval aviator and Marine officer. There is no indication that Colonel Del Pizzo was overconfident in his abilities or reckless in mission execution … The board unanimously believes that Colonel Del Pizzo exercised sound judgment in his actions on 17 September 2023.”</p><p>And both investigation boards made numerous recommendations, including new scenarios in simulators and changes in training. In Del Pizzo’s mind, that was how the system was supposed to work.</p><p>But the officer in charge of the third investigation came to a different conclusion. The officer agreed that Del Pizzo followed procedures under difficult conditions, and that Del Pizzo didn’t engage in any misconduct. However, he found the mishap “occurred as a result of pilot error, in that the MP (mishap pilot) incorrectly diagnosed an OCF flight emergency and ejected from a flyable aircraft.”</p><p>His report pegged the cost of the plane's loss at $136 million.</p><p>Del Pizzo reviewed that report in early 2024, while still recovering from his broken back. He disagreed with the logic. Without a massive system failure while flying blind in the clouds, he wouldn’t have ejected. This investigation also went beyond its normal scope of determining misconduct, which Del Pizzo and other experienced aviators interviewed for this story said was highly unusual. But Command Investigation reports typically didn’t carry the same weight as the other two safety investigations.&nbsp;</p><p>And the report’s conclusion that he was to blame didn’t seem to affect his career arc.</p><p>His back healed, and he was cleared to fly fighter jets again. By April 2024, seven months after the mishap, he was back in Beaufort,&nbsp;climbing into an F-35B, feeling a sense of gratitude for another chance. Those flights also would solve another mystery.</p><p>Just before he ejected, he heard what he thought was the engine spooling down. But flying again in the F-35B he realized it wasn’t the engine, it was the powerful lift fan the plane uses in hover mode. The sound of the fan slowing down contributed to the illusion that he’d lost power and was falling. An important lesson to pass on to future pilots, he thought.</p><p>And he was still on track to take command of VMX-1 in Arizona.</p><p>"I kept asking headquarters, 'Am I good?' Almost every week." They kept giving him the green light. "The aviation leadership couldn't have been more supportive."</p><p>In May 2024, he began moving his family to Yuma. That same month, he received&nbsp;the Legion of Merit for his work at the Pentagon. Smith, the Marine commandant, visited Yuma that summer and seemed pleased. Del&nbsp;Pizzo said at one point, Smith asked him about his future career plans. Del Pizzo said that he was weighing his options. Smith told him that command of VMX-1 wasn’t his last chapter as a Marine. “We put you here for a reason,” which Del Pizzo interpreted as a vote of confidence in his future in the Marines.</p><p>Marine officers are regularly evaluated for their fitness to command, a report card of sorts that the commandant uses for promotions. Del Pizzo’s were stellar. Signed by two generals, one report in mid-2024 said: “Absolutely must promote, GO (general) potential&nbsp;… Cheez is a pure professional with unlimited future potential … Has my highest recommendation for promotion.”</p><p>Another report later in 2024 said Del Pizzo’s work in Yuma was “setting the course for Marine Aviation’s future … highest recommendation for promotion … Place where our Corps’ hardest problems must be solved … Col. Del Pizzo’s potential in our Corps is unlimited.”</p><p>So he was stunned when he got the call last October: After 103 days of command in Yuma, the commandant had relieved him of duty.</p><p>Effective immediately.</p><div><figure><span data-toggle="modal" data-photo-target=".photo-37b796b5-5a81-5de7-a82f-46314ceeb85c" data-instance="#gallery-items-80d55e4a-f600-11ef-8ef4-03f14319ce57-photo-modal" data-target="#photo-carousel-80d55e4a-f600-11ef-8ef4-03f14319ce57">

BETRAYAL</h4><p>The news came in a video call with one of the two generals who had written that Del Pizzo had unlimited promotion potential.</p><p>“I thought it was just a chance to catch up,” Del Pizzo recalled. “I thought, ‘This is great. I get some one-on-one time with the bosses and talk about how things are going.’ ”</p><p>Instead, the conversation moved immediately to the mishap.</p><p>The lieutenant general told him he’d done nothing wrong during his command in Yuma, but that a press release was about to be issued about Command Investigation’s findings. Smith, the commandant, had reviewed the report again and decided that Del Pizzo shouldn’t have such a high-visibility command. Results from the other two investigations, the ones that concluded Del Pizzo hadn’t been at fault, wouldn’t be released. The Marines would explain the sudden relief of command by saying it was due to a “loss of trust and confidence,” which hit Del Pizzo like a dagger because it implied misconduct.</p><p>Stunned, Del Pizzo asked if he could have a small change of command ceremony&nbsp;— hand over the squadron’s flag as a way of thanking the people who had been so welcoming when he took over.</p><p>Request denied.</p><p>Soon, more than 300 Marines, sailors and civilians under his command in Yuma were told that he had been relieved for “misdiagnosis of an out-of-control flight situation.” Until then, only a small circle of people knew he’d ejected from the F-35B in South Carolina.</p><p>Del Pizzo called his wife, Jessica,&nbsp;to meet him at the their&nbsp;home off base. He didn’t explain. She wondered why he didn't just send her a text.</p><p>“I walked in the door and saw his face, and he looked completely defeated."</p><p>Like her husband, she struggled to understand the timing and the treatment. All three investigations had been done in early 2024, but the Marines still gave him a green light to take command? Why put him and his family through a cross-country move? What had changed between early 2024 and that fall?</p><p>“We replayed it all the time, going back and forth,” she recalled. “And we couldn’t figure it out.”</p><p>Del Pizzo asked to speak to the commandant directly.</p><p>“Obviously, I had a lot of questions.”</p><p>Request denied.</p><div><figure><span data-toggle="modal" data-photo-target=".photo-15d74b13-64d1-4f0c-8a32-717c4c2b323f" data-instance="#gallery-items-80d55e4a-f600-11ef-8ef4-03f14319ce57-photo-modal" data-target="#photo-carousel-80d55e4a-f600-11ef-8ef4-03f14319ce57">

WRECKAGE</h4><p>The F-35 program is the Defense Department’s most expensive weapons program, a decades-long push to replace many of the military’s earlier generation fighters, from F-16s to Harriers. The military has at least 630 F-35s across the Air Force, Navy and Marines, with plans to build a fleet of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gao.gov/blog/f-35-will-now-exceed-2-trillion-military-plans-fly-it-less#:~:text=Across%20the%20military%20there%20are,(a%2044%25%20increase)." target="_blank">2,400 jets</a>&nbsp;over the coming years.</p><p>But in 2023, the year of Del Pizzo’s mishap, F-35Bs were fully available for missions only 15 to 36 percent of the time, the <a href="https://www.gao.gov/assets/d24106703.pdf" target="_blank">Government Accountability Office</a> reported. Critics of the F-35 cite the program’s costs and manufacturing delays. One big concern has been the jet's computers and software.</p><p>Two months before Del Pizzo’s mishap, the Defense Department <a href="https://www.defensenews.com/air/2024/07/11/pentagon-to-accept-deliveries-of-lockheed-f-35s-after-year-long-pause/#:~:text=The%20first%20F%2D35s%20that,cover%20U.S.%20Air%20Force%20operations." target="_blank">stopped accepting</a> some newly built F-35s over frustration with Lockheed Martin’s pace of installing better displays and more powerful computers. Those technology upgrades are <a href="https://www.defenseone.com/business/2025/03/f-35-get-new-software-summer-theres-no-date-yet-planned-full-upgrade/403536/" target="_blank">only now</a> set to be in place this summer. Test pilots reportedly have had to reboot their radar and electronic warfare systems in midair, another <a href="https://www.gao.gov/assets/gao-24-106909.pdf" target="_blank">GAO report</a> said.</p><p>The exact cause of the electrical malfunction in Del Pizzo’s mishap is hidden in redacted documents, pages the military said it blacked out for national security purposes. Unredacted portions ruled out some causes, though. Thunderstorms were in the area, but bolts at the time of the mishap were 20 miles away and couldn’t have fried the plane’s electronics. Investigators noted that the aircraft entered heavy rain five minutes before Del Pizzo ejected. But a Marine spokesperson said its investigation found no evidence that rainwater caused the electrical malfunction.</p><p>Del Pizzo isn’t one of the F-35’s critics. In fact, he’s a big cheerleader of the technology and the jet’s potential. He sees its evolution through the lens of a Harrier pilot. Harriers had even more issues but became one of the military’s aviation stalwarts because of constant improvements in technology and procedures. He’d seen firsthand during his work at the Pentagon how tirelessly people in the F-35 program were working to do the same for that jet.</p><p>Learning lessons was key, which is one reason he was so concerned about the way he was relieved of command. Punishing him moved the spotlight away from the jet’s issues.</p><p>“We needed to take a hard look at that to prevent it from happening again,” he said. “In aviation, we have a culture. When there are errors, when things don't go as planned, we learn from them. If you don’t do that, then you have a culture of fear. And if you have a culture of fear, then people are going to be paralyzed and not be able to make decisions. And that's how people end up getting hurt. That's how people end up getting killed.”</p><p>Some active duty and retired military aviators familiar with Del Pizzo's situation were appalled by his treatment.</p><p>"We fired a guy because of a press release," said one.</p><p>Another added that the treatment of Del Pizzo sends a dangerous message: If you eject, your career is over. "The easiest thing to do is blame the pilot."</p><p>The Post and Courier provided officials at Marine Headquarters with a list of questions about the commandant's decision to relieve Del Pizzo, the timing of his order and whether he factored in whether his decision set a dangerous precedent for Marine aviators in the future. The newspaper also offered Gen. Smith a chance to respond personally. Marine officials acknowledged receiving the questions but did not provide any answers.</p><div><figure><span data-toggle="modal" data-photo-target=".photo-9eafd81c-3c60-5b9e-aece-009d4346144d" data-instance="#gallery-items-80d55e4a-f600-11ef-8ef4-03f14319ce57-photo-modal" data-target="#photo-carousel-80d55e4a-f600-11ef-8ef4-03f14319ce57">

Reaching a destination means constant adjustments to turbulence, air traffic and sometimes human errors.</p><p>Lives and careers have their own kinds of turbulence and course-changers. As Del Pizzo recently&nbsp;unpacked his U-Haul at the family’s newly rented home near Washington, D.C., he talked about adjustments in his life, namely what it was like to be newly retired from an institution that had for so long been part of his identity.</p><p>He’s at peace with his decision to eject, though his mind also can start spinning what-ifs. What if the forecast had been more accurate? What if the cloud cover had been just a few hundred feet higher and he’d been able to see the ground? What if he had radio contact and could talk to his wingman? What if he decided not to retire? The commandant's order to relieve him probably killed any chances of promotion. What if he'd stuck it out? It can be difficult to close those loops.</p><p>The deeper pain comes from what happened more than a year after he pulled the ejection handle.</p><p>“Maybe it was just a business decision,” Del Pizzo said of the commandant’s move to relieve him of command. “But there's a human element that you have to take care of. You can't just discard someone because it's inconvenient or a bad headline, right? You need to make sure you take care of the people. That's how you maintain that culture of trust.”</p><p>As he unpacked, schoolyard sounds could be heard in the distance. Yellow-and-gray plastic moving crates were stacked in the living room. Two friends, both retired military, showed up to help him get settled. You don’t really retire from the Marines. You’re still part of a group of people who helped forge who you are, and that never leaves you.</p><p>He’d soon head back to Yuma to close the house down there, flying into the new unknowns of civilian life, questions lingering in the slipstream of 41 seconds of sensory chaos above North Charleston and 31 years as a Marine that ended because of someone else’s decision.</p><div><figure><span data-toggle="modal" data-photo-target=".photo-23ab741c-41f0-5d5c-aa13-53c62a2669dd" data-instance="#gallery-items-80d55e4a-f600-11ef-8ef4-03f14319ce57-photo-modal" data-target="#photo-carousel-80d55e4a-f600-11ef-8ef4-03f14319ce57">

Tony Bartelme’s previous reports in 2024 dove deep into the F-35’s history and pros and cons, while exploring the vacuum of information. Charles “Tre” Del Pizzo’s decision to tell his story answers many of those questions. He agreed to do so because he said he hoped lessons could be learned to help future Marines.</p><p>To corroborate his story and other aspects of military investigation procedures, The Post and Courier interviewed a half-dozen military aviators, most of whom requested anonymity. The newspaper also interviewed F-35 experts, both critics and supporters. The newspaper obtained more than 700 pages of heavily redacted documents about the incident from the Defense Department and local law enforcement agencies. Del Pizzo provided documentation of his military record and fitness reports for our review.</p><p>Bartelme and Robert Scheer traveled to Washington, D.C., for in-person interviews. Funding for the project was supported by the newspaper’s nonprofit <a href="https://postandcourierfund.com/" target="_blank">Public Service and Investigative Fund</a>.</p><div><figure><span data-toggle="modal" data-photo-target=".photo-bf87a46d-6a1e-5e13-8b34-3f0bd1506b86" data-instance="#gallery-items-80d55e4a-f600-11ef-8ef4-03f14319ce57-photo-modal" data-target="#photo-carousel-80d55e4a-f600-11ef-8ef4-03f14319ce57">

<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Description</h2><a id="user-content-description" aria-label="Permalink: Description" href="#description"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">This is a framework that is intended for creating and preparing Windows 98 installation ISO images in a way that is optimized for extremely quick installation, similar to <em>nLite</em>, but with a completely different method and context.</p>
<p dir="auto">It takes the root file system of an already installed Windows 98 system and packages it, whilst allowing drivers and tools to be slipstreamed at will.</p>
<p dir="auto">For the installer, it uses Linux as a base, paired with some tools to allow hard disk partitioning and formatting, as well as  a custom installer with a custom data packing method that is optimized for streaming directly from CD to the hard disk without any seeking.</p>
<p dir="auto">Bottom line, this means that the effort for the user to build an ISO is higher than for example nLite, but the degree of customizability is also massively increased.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">How fast is it really?</h2><a id="user-content-how-fast-is-it-really" aria-label="Permalink: How fast is it really?" href="#how-fast-is-it-really"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">On a Pentium III class machine with ATA / ATAPI Ultra DMA available for all storage devices, Windows 98 -- using an ISO built with this framework -- can be installed from CD in roughly 60-90 seconds.</p>

<p dir="auto">There are several provided methods to boot into Windows 98 QuickInstall:</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto">CD/DVD-ROM boot</p>
<p dir="auto">The Windows 98 QuickInstall ISO image can be booted on any computer that supports floppy-emulation CD-ROM boot.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Recommended if you have a PC that supports CD-ROM boot.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">1.44M floppy boot with DOS (<code>dosflop.img</code>)</p>
<p dir="auto">This is a 1.44M floppy disk image that contains FreeDOS and <code>LOADLIN</code> to boot the kernel directly off the CD-ROM.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Recommended</strong> if you have a computer that does not support CD-ROM boot or wish to install from a hard disk.</p>
<p dir="auto"><em>Also recommended if you have the QuickInstall files on an ATA/ATAPI media or other device that is exposed using Int 13h</em></p>
<p dir="auto">If you have a SCSI CD-ROM, the image must be modified accordingly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">1.44M floppy boot with tiny kernel (<code>floppy.img</code>)</p>
<p dir="auto">This is a 1.44M floppy disk image that contains a proper kernel.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Recommended only</strong> if you have QuickInstall on a non-ATA/ATAPI media and your BIOS does not support CD-ROM boot.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>The kernel on this image is limited in functionality, driver support and does not enable kernel logs (no <code>printk</code>, no <code>dmesg</code>)</strong></p>
<p dir="auto">Due to the strong compression, it takes a very long time to boot on slow systems. It is only meant as a last resort.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">Removable media such as USB Flash Drives</p>
<p dir="auto">Using the system preparation script it is possible to create bootable USB images. The steps to do so are described below.</p>

<p dir="auto">This script serves the purpose of preparing an installation for packaging into an ISO and/or USB image file.</p>
<p dir="auto">It takes the following parameters:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto"><code>--iso &lt;ISO&gt;</code></p>
<p dir="auto">Instructs the script to create an ISO image with the given file name</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><code>--usb &lt;USB&gt;</code></p>
<p dir="auto">Instructs the script to create an USB key image with the given file name</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><code>--osroot &lt;OSROOT&gt;</code></p>
<p dir="auto">Specifies a Windows 98 / ME system root directory ("<em>OS Root</em>") to be used.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>This can be specified multiple times, in which case the installation wizard will show a selection menu.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><code>--extra &lt;EXTRA&gt;</code></p>
<p dir="auto">Instructs the script to add the files in this directory to the final ISO/USB output.</p>
<p dir="auto">Default: <code>_EXTRA_CD_FILES_</code> in the framework directory</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>This can be specified multiple times, all the files in all the directories will be added in this case</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><code>--drivers &lt;DRIVERS&gt;</code></p>
<p dir="auto">Instructs the script to process <em>slipstream</em> all drivers in this directory.</p>
<p dir="auto"><em>Slipstream</em> means that these drivers will be installed automatically when the hardware for them is detected at any point of the installation's lifetime, even when the hardware is not yet present at the time of installation.</p>
<p dir="auto">Default: <code>_DRIVER_</code> in the framework directory. It already contains a curated selection of drivers.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>This parameter can only be specified once.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><code>--extradrivers &lt;EXTRADRIVERS&gt;</code></p>
<p dir="auto">Instructs the script to process all drivers in this directory and add them into the extra drivers directory.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>These drivers are NOT slipstreamed</strong> and thus not automatically installed. They are however made available on the resulting installation media and can be installed by pointing the Windows 98 / ME <code>Add New Hardware</code> wizard to the <code>DRIVER.EX</code> directory on the media.</p>
<p dir="auto">The reason for this folder's existence is the vast selection of hardware available for the operating systems and the varying compatibility / size of them.</p>
<p dir="auto">Very large drivers are recommended to go in here, as well as drivers for which it cannot be assumed that different versions have different compatibility and speed.</p>
<p dir="auto">For example, it is better to choose an older driver for an older <em>nVidia GeForce</em> card even though a newer one would also support this hardware for speed reasons, whilst the newer driver should also be available, in case newer hardware is present.</p>
<p dir="auto">Default: <code>_EXTRA_DRIVER_</code> in the framework directory. It already contains a curated selection of drivers.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>This parameter can only be specified once.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><code>--verbose VERBOSE</code></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">This parameter controls console output verbosity of the script.</p>
<p dir="auto">Where <code>VERBOSE</code> is either <code>True</code> or <code>False</code>.</p>
<p dir="auto">The default is <code>False</code>.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>This parameter is currently broken, sorry. It's always quiet.</strong></p>

<ul dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto">Install Windows 98 / ME in a virtual machine or emulator, just as you want it.
I recommend using 86Box using the following configuration:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Machine:
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Machine Type: Slot 1</li>
<li>Achine: [i440BX] ABIT BF6</li>
<li>CPU type: Intel Pentium II (Deschutes)</li>
<li>Memory: 64 MB</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Display:
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Video: [ISA] VGA (or any video card that does not have an integrated driver in Windows 98 / ME)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Network:
<ul dir="auto">
<li>None, <em><strong>VERY IMPORTANT TO MAKE SURE NETWORK DRIVER SETUP STAYS INTACT!!</strong></em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Hard disks:
<ul dir="auto">
<li>IDE (0:0), <em><strong>raw image</strong></em>, big enough to install the operating system.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">It is recommended that you install Windows in APM mode, because ACPI is a buggy mess (<code>setup /p i</code>).</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>WARNING:</strong> The operating system <em><strong>must</strong></em> be installed from the HARD DISK and it must contain a folder containing the Windows 98 CAB files from the CDROM. Otherwise, drivers can not be slipstreamed.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>NOTE:</strong> It is recommended that NO extra drivers are installed in this VM.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">Configure the Windows 98 / ME installation as you wish. Examples:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Machine name</li>
<li>User name</li>
<li>System options</li>
<li>Themes</li>
<li>Patches</li>
<li>Utilities</li>
<li>Software</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">Shut down the virtual machine and <strong>DO NOT TURN IT BACK ON</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">Use 7zip or an imaging software and extract the entire root of the
partition you installed Windows 98 to.</p>
<p dir="auto">Extract all files into a directory. We will call this the <em>OS Root</em>. The default for this is <code>_OS_ROOT_</code> in the framework directory.</p>
<p dir="auto">On Windows, you can open the image file using the 7zip File Manager or the 7zip context menu. Or WinImage, et cetera.</p>
<p dir="auto">On Linux, you can do this with by using '7z' from the p7zip-full package.</p>
<p dir="auto"><code>7z x -o_OS_ROOT_/ /path/to/image/file</code></p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>WARNING:</strong> Only <em>one</em> Windows directory is allowed, and only <em>one</em> Windows setup files CAB directory. If you install using 98Lite, make sure that the 98Lite setup directory is the sole carrier of these CABs.</p>
<p dir="auto"><em>INFO: The script detects the Windows directory by finding <code>WIN.COM</code></em>
<em>INFO: The CAB file directory is detected by finding <code>PRECOPY2.CAB</code></em></p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>This location must be specified when running the script by using the <code>--osroot</code> parameter.</strong></p>

<li>
<p dir="auto">Add any extra files you wish added to the ISO to a directory of your choice. By default this is <code>_EXTRA_CD_FILES</code> in the framework directory.</p>
<p dir="auto">This can include drivers that you do not wish to be processed with the QuickInstall tools, e.g. drivers that contain bundled software.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>If you choose a non-default directory for this, you must specify it using the <code>--extra</code> parameter.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">Run the following command to build the package:</p>

<p dir="auto">A: This is a weird glitch that happens on Windows hosts where files created after DST are suddenly are offset by one hour.</p>
<p dir="auto">In the future, the sysprep script will work with Hard Disk image files, which will make this a non-issue.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Workaround 1:</strong> Re-extract the files from the hard disk image you used as the base to create your image</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Workaround 2:</strong> Create images on Linux</p>

                  <p><span>A fragile 13th century manuscript fragment, hidden in plain sight as the binding of a 16th-century archival register, has been discovered in Cambridge and revealed to contain rare medieval stories of Merlin and King Arthur.</span></p>
                  <p><span>The manuscript, first discovered at </span><a href="https://www.lib.cam.ac.uk/" target="_blank"><span>Cambridge University Library</span></a><span> in 2019, has now been identified as part of the <em>Suite Vulgate du Merlin</em>, a French-language sequel to the legend of King Arthur. The story was part of the Lancelot-Grail cycle, a medieval best seller but few now remain.</span></p>
                  <p><span>There are less than 40 surviving manuscripts of the <em>Suite Vulgate du Merlin</em>, with each one unique since they were individually handwritten by medieval scribes.&nbsp;This latest discovery has been identified as having been written between 1275 and 1315.</span></p>

                  </figure>
                  <p><span>The manuscript had survived the centuries after being recycled and repurposed in the 1500s as the cover for a property record from Huntingfield Manor in Suffolk, owned by the Vanneck family of Heveningham.&nbsp;</span></p>
                  <p><span>It meant the remarkable discovery was folded, torn, and even stitched into the binding of the book - making it almost impossible for Cambridge experts to access it, read it, or confirm its origins.</span></p>
                  <p><span>What followed the discovery has been a ground-breaking collaborative project, showcasing the work of the University Library’s </span><a href="https://www.lib.cam.ac.uk/collections/departments/chil" target="_blank"><span>Cultural Heritage Imaging Laboratory</span></a><span> (CHIL) and combining historical scholarship with cutting-edge digital techniques, to unlock the manuscript's long-held secrets - without damaging the unique document.&nbsp;</span></p>

                  <p><span>This one is believed to belong to the short version of the <em>Vulgate Merlin</em>, and small errors—such as the mistaken use of the name "Dorilas" instead of "Dodalis"—</span><span> will help Dr Fabry-Tehranchi and her colleague Nathalie Koble (ENS Paris), to trace its lineage among surviving manuscripts.&nbsp;</span></p>

                  <p><span>The text is written in Old French, the language of the court and aristocracy in medieval England following the Norman Conquest and this particular fragment belongs to the genre of Arthurian romances which were intended for a noble audience, including women.&nbsp;</span></p>

                  <p><span>The fragment tells two key episodes from the end of the <em>Suite Vulgate du Merlin</em>. The first part recounts the victory of the Christians against the Saxons at the Battle of Cambénic.

                    </blockquote>
                  </div>
                  <p>A multidisciplinary team comprising curators, conservators, and imaging specialists from across the University of Cambridge, including departments such as Archives and Modern Manuscripts, Conservation &amp; Heritage, and Collections and Academic Liaison, all worked together with CHIL to analyse and digitise the fragment.</p>
                  <p><span>The methods undertaken by Amélie Deblauwe</span><span>, Błażej Mikuła </span><span>and Maciej Pawlikowski from CHIL, with the support of Jennifer Murray from the Library’s </span><a href="https://www.lib.cam.ac.uk/collections/departments/conservation-department" target="_blank"><span>Conservation Department</span></a><span>, allowed them to unfold the fragment <em>virtually</em> and access hidden parts of the text.</span></p>
                  <p><span>To achieve this, the team undertook:</span></p>
                  <p><span><strong>Multispectral Imaging (MSI)</strong> </span><span><br>This technique used in CHIL involved capturing the fragment in various wavelengths of light, from ultraviolet to infrared. <p>The high-resolution images produced by MSI allowed the team to enhance the readability of the text.

												<p><em>“Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.” -U.S. Constitution, First Amendment.</em></p>
<div id="attachment_70858"><p><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-70858" decoding="async" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/1stamendment.png" alt="" width="747" height="508"></p><p id="caption-attachment-70858">Image: Shutterstock, zimmytws.</p></div>
<p>In an address to Congress this month, <strong>President Trump</strong> claimed he had “brought free speech back to America.” But barely two months into his second term, the president has waged an unprecedented attack on the First Amendment rights of journalists, students, universities, government workers, lawyers and judges.</p>
<p>This story explores a slew of recent actions by the Trump administration that threaten to undermine all five pillars of the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which guarantees freedoms concerning speech, religion, the media, the right to assembly, and the right to petition the government and seek redress for wrongs.</p>
<h2>THE RIGHT TO PETITION</h2>
<p>The right to petition allows citizens to communicate with the government, whether to complain, request action, or share viewpoints — without fear of reprisal. But that right is being assaulted by this administration on multiple levels. For starters, many GOP lawmakers are now heeding their leadership’s advice to stay away from local town hall meetings and avoid the wrath of constituents affected by the administration’s many federal budget and workforce cuts.</p>
<p>Another example: President Trump recently <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/18/politics/opm-privacy-team-fired/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fired most of the people</a> involved in processing <strong>Freedom of Information Act</strong> (FOIA) requests for government agencies. FOIA is an indispensable tool used by journalists and the public to request government records, and to hold leaders accountable.</p>
<p>The biggest story by far this week was the bombshell from The Atlantic editor <strong>Jeffrey Goldberg</strong>, who recounted how he was <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2025/03/trump-administration-accidentally-texted-me-its-war-plans/682151/?gift=DjgA9DZGvABas7wFCM-ptk0vpPuikYUZT9Ej3cJbK1s&amp;utm_source=copy-link&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=share" target="_blank" rel="noopener">inadvertently added to a Signal group chat</a> with <strong>National Security Advisor Michael Waltz</strong> and 16 other Trump administration officials discussing plans for an upcoming attack on Yemen.</p>
<p>One overlooked aspect of Goldberg’s incredible account is that by planning and coordinating the attack on Signal — which features messages that can auto-delete after a short time — administration officials were evidently seeking a way to avoid creating a lasting (and potentially FOIA-able) record of their deliberations.</p>
<p>“Intentional or not, use of Signal in this context was an act of erasure—because without Jeffrey Goldberg being accidentally added to the list, the general public would never have any record of these communications or any way to know they even occurred,” <strong>Tony Bradley</strong> <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/tonybradley/2025/03/26/what-everyone-has-missed-about-the-trump-administration-signal-scandal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote this week at Forbes</a>.</p>
<p>Petitioning the government, particularly when it ignores your requests, often requires challenging federal agencies in court. But that becomes far more difficult if the most competent law firms start to shy away from cases that may involve crossing the president and his administration.</p>
<p>On March 22, the president issued <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/03/preventing-abuses-of-the-legal-system-and-the-federal-court/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a memorandum</a> that directs heads of the Justice and Homeland Security Departments to “seek sanctions against attorneys and law firms who engage in frivolous, unreasonable and vexatious litigation against the United States,” or in matters that come before federal agencies.</p>
<p>The POTUS recently issued several executive orders railing against specific law firms with attorneys who worked legal cases against him. On Friday, the <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-28/trump-says-he-s-reached-100-million-pro-bono-deal-with-skadden" target="_blank" rel="noopener">president announced</a> that the law firm of <strong>Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meager &amp; Flom</strong> had agreed to provide $100 million in pro bono work on issues that he supports.</p>
<p>Trump issued <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/03/addressing-remedial-action-by-paul-weiss/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">another order</a> naming the firm <strong>Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton &amp; Garrison</strong>, which ultimately agreed to pledge $40 million in pro bono legal services to the president’s causes.</p>
<p>Other Trump executive orders targeted law firms <strong>Jenner &amp; Block</strong> and <strong>WilmerHale</strong>, both of which have attorneys that worked with special counsel Robert Mueller on the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. But this week, two federal judges in separate rulings <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/28/politics/law-firms-fighting-trump-executive-order/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">froze parts of those orders</a>.</p>
<p>“There is no doubt this retaliatory action chills speech and legal advocacy, and that is qualified as a constitutional harm,” wrote <strong>Judge Richard Leon</strong>, who ruled against the executive order targeting WilmerHale.</p>
<p>President Trump recently took the extraordinary step of calling for the impeachment of federal judges who rule against the administration. Trump called <strong>U.S. District Judge James Boasberg</strong> <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/03/18/trump-impeachment-judge-deportations-00235173" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-tracking="mpos=&amp;mid=&amp;lindex=&amp;lcol=" aria-label=" (Opens in a new window)">a “Radical Left Lunatic”</a> and urged he be removed from office for blocking deportation of Venezuelan alleged gang members under a rarely invoked wartime legal authority.</p>
<p>In a rare public rebuke to a sitting president, <strong>U.S. Supreme Court Justice John Roberts</strong> <a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/us-chief-justice-roberts-calls-judges-impeachment-are-inappropriate-after-trump-2025-03-18/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">issued a statement on March 18</a> pointing out that “For more than two centuries, it has been established that impeachment is not an appropriate response to disagreement concerning a judicial decision.”</p>
<p>The U.S. Constitution provides that judges can be removed from office only through impeachment by the House of Representatives and conviction by the Senate. The Constitution also states that judges’ salaries cannot be reduced while they are in office.</p>
<p>Undeterred, <strong>House Speaker Mike Johnson </strong>this week suggested the administration could still use the power of its purse to keep courts in line, and even <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/now/video/speaker-mike-johnson-floats-possibility-of-congress-eliminating-federal-courts-235397189724" target="_blank" rel="noopener">floated the idea of wholesale eliminating federal courts</a>.</p>
<p>“We do have authority over the federal courts as you know,” Johnson said. “We can eliminate an entire district court. We have power of funding over the courts, and all these other things. But desperate times call for desperate measures, and Congress is going to act, so stay tuned for that.”</p>
<h2>FREEDOM OF ASSEMBLY</h2>
<p>President Trump has taken a number of actions to discourage lawful demonstrations at universities and colleges across the country, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-says-federal-funding-will-stop-colleges-schools-allowing-illegal-protests-2025-03-04/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">threatening to cut federal funding</a> for any college that supports protests he deems “illegal.”</p>
<p>A Trump <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/additional-measures-to-combat-anti-semitism/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">executive order in January</a> outlined a broad federal crackdown on what he called “the explosion of antisemitism” on U.S. college campuses. This administration has asserted that foreign students who are lawfully in the United States on visas do not enjoy the same free speech or due process rights as citizens.</p>
<p><strong>Reuters</strong> reports that the acting civil rights director at the <strong>Department of Education</strong> (DOE) <a href="https://www.ed.gov/about/news/press-release/us-department-of-educations-office-civil-rights-sends-letters-60-universities-under-investigation-antisemitic-discrimination-and-harassment" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on March 10 sent letters to 60 educational institutions</a> warning they could lose federal funding if they don’t do more to combat anti-semitism. On March 20, Trump issued an order calling for <a href="https://www.ed.gov/about/news/press-release/statement-president-trumps-executive-order-return-power-over-education-states-and-local-communities" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the closure of the DOE</a>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, <strong>U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement</strong> (ICE) agents have been <a href="https://apnews.com/article/immigration-detainees-students-ozturk-khalil-78f544fb2c8b593c88a0c1f0e0ad9c5f" target="_blank" rel="noopener">detaining and trying to deport</a> pro-Palestinian students who are legally in the United States. The administration is targeting students and academics who spoke out against Israel’s attacks on Gaza, or who were active in campus protests against U.S. support for the attacks. <strong>Secretary of State Marco Rubio</strong> <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/education/5218410-ice-arrests-tufts-alabama-students-trump-immigration-crackdown-rumeysa-ozturk-khalil/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">told reporters Thursday</a> that at least 300 foreign students have seen their visas revoked under President Trump, a far higher number than was previously known.</p>
<p>In his first term, Trump threatened to use the national guard or the U.S. military to deal with protesters, and in campaigning for re-election he promised to revisit the idea.</p>
<p>“I think the bigger problem is the enemy from within,” Trump told <strong>Fox News</strong> in October 2024. “We have some very bad people. We have some sick people, radical left lunatics. And I think they’re the big — and it should be very easily handled by, if necessary, by National Guard, or if really necessary, by the military, because they can’t let that happen.”</p>
<p>This term, Trump acted swiftly to remove the top judicial advocates in the armed forces who would almost certainly push back on any request by the president to use U.S. soldiers in an effort to quell public protests, or to arrest and detain immigrants. In late February, the president and <strong>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth</strong> fired the top legal officers for the military services — those responsible for ensuring the Uniform Code of Military Justice is followed by commanders.</p>
<p>Military.com <a href="https://www.military.com/daily-news/2025/02/24/people-are-very-scared-trump-administration-purge-of-jag-officers-raises-legal-ethical-fears.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">warns</a> that the purge “sets an alarming precedent for a crucial job in the military, as President Donald Trump has mused about using the military in unorthodox and potentially illegal ways.” Hegseth told reporters the removals were necessary because he didn’t want them to pose any “roadblocks to orders that are given by a commander in chief.”<span id="more-70660"></span></p>
<h2>FREEDOM OF THE PRESS</h2>
<p>President Trump has sued a number of U.S. news outlets, including <strong>60 Minutes</strong>, <strong>CNN</strong>, <strong>The Washington Post</strong>, <strong>The New York Times</strong> and other smaller media organizations for unflattering coverage.</p>
<p>In a $10 billion lawsuit against 60 Minutes and its parent <strong>Paramount</strong>, Trump claims they selectively edited an interview with former <strong>Vice President Kamala Harris</strong> prior to the 2024 election. The TV news show last month published transcripts of the interview at the heart of the dispute, but Paramount is <a href="https://apnews.com/article/cbs-60-minutes-lawsuit-trump-pelley-58339cc1a1eb52739bb365e2e8c6d8bc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reportedly considering a settlement</a> to avoid potentially damaging its chances of winning the administration’s approval for a pending multibillion-dollar merger.</p>
<p>The president <a href="https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/crime-and-courts/2025/02/25/dismissal-sought-donald-trump-lawsuit-pollster-ann-selzer-des-moines-register-iowa-poll/79442387007/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sued The Des Moines Register</a> and its parent company, <strong>Gannett</strong>, for publishing a poll showing Trump trailing Harris in the 2024 presidential election in Iowa (a state that went for Trump). The POTUS also is <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/07/21/trump-libel-suit-pulitzer-prize-00169975" target="_blank" rel="noopener">suing the Pulitzer Prize board</a> over 2018 awards given to The New York Times and The Washington Post for their coverage of purported Russian interference in the 2016 election.</p>
<p>Whether or not any of the president’s lawsuits against news organizations have merit or succeed is almost beside the point. The strategy behind suing the media is to make reporters and newsrooms think twice about criticizing or challenging the president and his administration. The president also knows some media outlets will find it more expedient to settle.</p>
<p>Trump also sued <strong>ABC News</strong> and <strong>George Stephanopoulos</strong> for stating that the president had been found liable for “rape” in a civil case [Trump was found liable of sexually abusing and defaming E. Jean Carroll]. ABC parent <strong>Disney</strong> settled that claim by agreeing to donate $15 million to the Trump Presidential Library.</p>
<p>Following the attack on the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, <strong>Facebook</strong> blocked President Trump’s account. Trump sued <strong>Meta</strong>, and after the president’s victory in 2024 Meta <a href="https://www.wsj.com/us-news/law/trump-signs-agreement-calling-for-meta-to-pay-25-million-to-settle-suit-6f734c8c?mod=article_inline" target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-label="Go to https://www.wsj.com/us-news/law/trump-signs-agreement-calling-for-meta-to-pay-25-million-to-settle-suit-6f734c8c?mod=article_inline">settled</a> and agreed to pay Trump $25 million: $22 million would go to his presidential library, and the rest to legal fees. <strong>Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg</strong> also announced Facebook and Instagram would <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/07/tech/meta-censorship-moderation/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">get rid of fact-checkers</a> and rely instead on reader-submitted “community notes” to debunk disinformation on the social media platform.</p>
<p><strong>Brendan Carr</strong>, the president’s pick to run the <strong>Federal Communications Commission</strong> (FCC), has pledged to “dismantle the censorship cartel and restore free speech rights for everyday Americans.” But on January 22, 2025, the FCC reopened complaints against ABC, <strong>CBS</strong> and <strong>NBC</strong> over their coverage of the 2024 election. The previous FCC chair had dismissed the complaints as attacks on the First Amendment and an attempt to weaponize the agency for political purposes.</p>
<p>According to Reuters, the complaints call for an investigation into how ABC News moderated the pre-election TV debate between Trump and Biden, and appearances of then-Vice President Harris on 60 Minutes and on NBC’s “Saturday Night Live.”</p>
<p>Since then, the FCC has opened investigations into <strong>NPR</strong> and <strong>PBS</strong>, <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/01/30/nx-s1-5281162/fcc-npr-pbs-investigation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">alleging</a> that they are breaking sponsorship rules. The <strong>Center for Democracy &amp; Technology </strong>(CDT), a think tank based in Washington, D.C., <a href="https://cdt.org/insights/when-it-comes-to-free-speech-the-trump-administration-should-follow-its-own-order/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">noted</a> that the FCC is also investigating <strong>KCBS</strong> in San Francisco for reporting on the location of federal immigration authorities.</p>
<p>“Even if these investigations are ultimately closed without action, the mere fact of opening them – and the implicit threat to the news stations’ license to operate – can have the effect of deterring the press from news coverage that the Administration dislikes,” the CDT’s <strong>Kate Ruane</strong> observed.</p>
<p>Trump has repeatedly threatened to “open up” libel laws, with the goal of making it easier to sue media organizations for unfavorable coverage. But this week, the U.S. Supreme Court <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/supreme-court-thwarts-trump-dream-of-opening-up-libel-laws.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">declined to hear a challenge</a> brought by Trump donor and Las Vegas casino magnate Steve Wynn to overturn the landmark 1964 decision in <em>New York Times v. Sullivan</em>, which insulates the press from libel suits over good-faith criticism of public figures.</p>
<p>The president also has insisted on picking which reporters and news outlets should be allowed to cover White House events and participate in the press pool that trails the president. He barred the <strong>Associated Press</strong> from the White House and Air Force One over their refusal to call the Gulf of Mexico by another name.</p>
<p>And the Defense Department has ordered a number of top media outlets <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/pentagon-doubles-number-news-outlets-rotate-out-office-spaces-2025-02-08/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to vacate their spots at the Pentagon</a>, including CNN, The Hill, The Washington Post, The New York Times, NBC News, Politico and National Public Radio.</p>
<p>“Incoming media outlets include the New York Post, Breitbart, the Washington Examiner, the Free Press, the Daily Caller, Newsmax, the Huffington Post and One America News Network, most of whom are seen as conservative or favoring Republican President Donald Trump,” Reuters reported.</p>
<h2>FREEDOM OF SPEECH</h2>
<p>Shortly after Trump took office again in January 2025, the administration began circulating <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/03/07/us/trump-federal-agencies-websites-words-dei.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lists of hundreds of words</a> that government staff and agencies shall not use in their reports and communications.</p>
<p>The Brookings Institution <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/the-us-government-data-purge-is-a-loss-for-policymaking-and-research/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">notes</a> that in moving to comply with this anti-speech directive, federal agencies have purged countless taxpayer-funded data sets from a swathe of government websites, including data on crime, sexual orientation, gender, education, climate, and global development.</p>
<p><strong>The New York Times</strong> reports that in the past two months, hundreds of terabytes of digital resources analyzing data have been taken off government websites.</p>
<p>“While in many cases the underlying data still exists, the tools that make it possible for the public and researchers to use that data have been removed,” The Times <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/21/climate/government-websites-climate-environment-data.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote</a>.</p>
<p>On Jan. 27, Trump issued <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/documents/deb7af80-48b6-4b8a-8bfa-3d84fd7c3ec8.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a memo</a> (PDF) that paused all federally funded programs pending a review of those programs for alignment with the administration’s priorities. Among those was ensuring that no funding goes toward advancing “Marxist equity, transgenderism, and green new deal social engineering policies.”</p>
<p>According to the CDT, this order is a blatant attempt to force government grantees to cease engaging in speech that the current administration dislikes, including speech about the benefits of diversity, climate change, and LGBTQ issues.</p>
<p>“The First Amendment does not permit the government to discriminate against grantees because it does not like some of the viewpoints they espouse,” the CDT’s Ruane wrote. “Indeed, those groups that are challenging the constitutionality of the order argued as much in their complaint, and have won an injunction blocking its implementation.”</p>
<p>On January 20, the same day Trump issued an executive order on free speech, the president also issued an executive order titled “<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/reevaluating-and-realigning-united-states-foreign-aid/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Reevaluating and Realigning United States Foreign Aid</a>,” which froze funding for programs run by the <strong>U.S. Agency for International Development</strong> (USAID). Among those were programs designed to empower civil society and human rights groups, journalists and others responding to digital repression and Internet shutdowns.</p>
<p>According to the <strong>Electronic Frontier Foundation</strong> (EFF), this includes many freedom technologies that use cryptography, fight censorship, protect freedom of speech, privacy and anonymity for millions of people around the world.</p>
<p>“While the State Department has issued some limited waivers, so far those waivers do not seem to cover the open source internet freedom technologies,” the EFF <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2025/01/executive-order-state-department-sideswipes-freedom-tools-threatens-censorship" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote</a> about the USAID disruptions. “As a result, many of these projects have to stop or severely curtail their work, lay off talented workers, and stop or slow further development.”</p>
<p>On March 14, the president signed <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/03/continuing-the-reduction-of-the-federal-bureaucracy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">another executive order</a> that effectively gutted the <strong>U.S. Agency for Global Media</strong> (USAGM), which oversees or funds media outlets including <strong>Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty</strong> and <strong>Voice of America</strong> (VOA). The USAGM also oversees <strong>Radio Free Asia</strong>, which supporters say has been one of the most reliable tools used by the government to combat Chinese propaganda.</p>
<p>But this week, <strong>U.S. District Court Judge Royce Lamberth</strong>, a Reagan appointee, <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/03/26/nx-s1-5341321/trump-radio-free-europe-radio-liberty-restraining-order" target="_blank" rel="noopener">temporarily blocked USAGM’s closure</a> by the administration.</p>
<p>“RFE/RL has, for decades, operated as one of the organizations that Congress has statutorily designated to carry out this policy,” Lamberth&nbsp;<a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.278524/gov.uscourts.dcd.278524.14.0.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wrote in a 10-page opinion</a>. “The leadership of USAGM cannot, with one sentence of reasoning offering virtually no explanation, force RFE/RL to shut down — even if the President has told them to do so.”</p>
<h2>FREEDOM OF RELIGION</h2>
<p>The Trump administration <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/news/2025/01/21/statement-dhs-spokesperson-directives-expanding-law-enforcement-and-ending-abuse" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rescinded a decades-old policy</a> that instructed officers not to take immigration enforcement actions in or near “sensitive” or “protected” places, such as churches, schools, and hospitals.</p>
<p>That directive was immediately challenged in a case brought by a group of Quakers, Baptists and Sikhs, who argued the policy reversal was keeping people from attending services for fear of being arrested on civil immigration violations. On Feb. 24, a federal judge agreed and <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/02/24/judge-blocks-immigration-enforcement-churches/80043880007/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blocked</a> ICE agents from entering churches or targeting migrants nearby.</p>
<p>The president’s executive order allegedly addressing antisemitism came with <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/01/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-takes-forceful-and-unprecedented-steps-to-combat-anti-semitism/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a fact sheet</a> that described college campuses as “infested” with “terrorists” and “jihadists.” Multiple faith groups expressed alarm over the order, saying it attempts to <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/03/20/nx-s1-5326047/kenneth-stern-antimsietim-executive-order-free-speech" target="_blank" rel="noopener">weaponize antisemitism</a> and promote “<a href="https://www.ucc.org/faith-that-calls-for-welcome-confronts-the-harshest-anti-immigrant-policies-in-modern-u-s-history/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dehumanizing anti-immigrant policies.</a>”</p>
<p>The president also <a href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-national-prayer-breakfast-30ff6f55a2e3c7b8643a15e7b158537d" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> the creation of a “Task Force to Eradicate Anti-Christian Bias,” to be led by Attorney General Pam Bondi. Never mind that Christianity is easily the largest faith in America and that Christians are well-represented in Congress.</p>
<p>The <strong>Rev. Paul Brandeis Raushenbush</strong>, a Baptist minister and head of the progressive <strong>Interfaith Alliance</strong>, issued a statement accusing Trump of hypocrisy in claiming to champion religion by creating the task force.</p>
<p>“From allowing immigration raids in churches, to targeting faith-based charities, to suppressing religious diversity, the Trump Administration’s aggressive government overreach is infringing on religious freedom in a way we haven’t seen for generations,” Raushenbush said.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.au.org/the-latest/press/task-force-anti-christian-bias-trump/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">statement</a> from <strong>Americans United for Separation of Church and State</strong> said the task force could lead to religious persecution of those with other faiths.</p>
<p>“Rather than protecting religious beliefs, this task force will misuse religious freedom to justify bigotry, discrimination, and the subversion of our civil rights laws,” said Rachel Laser, the group’s president and CEO.</p>
<p>Where is President Trump going with all these blatant attacks on the First Amendment? The president has made no secret of his affection for autocratic leaders and “strongmen” around the world, and he is particularly enamored with Hungary’s far-right <strong>Prime Minister Viktor Orbán</strong>, who has visited Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort twice in the past year.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2025/03/trumps-press-freedom-hungary-orban/682060/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">March 15 essay</a> in The Atlantic by Hungarian investigative journalist <strong>András Pethő</strong> recounts how Orbán rose to power by consolidating control over the courts, and by building his own media universe while simultaneously placing a stranglehold on the independent press.</p>
<p>“As I watch from afar what’s happening to the free press in the United States during the first weeks of Trump’s second presidency — the verbal bullying, the legal harassment, the buckling by media owners in the face of threats — it all looks very familiar,” Pethő wrote. “The MAGA authorities have learned Orbán’s lessons well.”</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>An emergency situation that turned out to be mostly a false alarm led a lot of schools in Los Angeles to install air filters, and something strange happened: Test scores went up. By a lot. And the gains were sustained in the subsequent year rather than fading away.</p><div><p>That’s what NYU’s Michael Gilraine finds in a new working paper titled “<a href="https://www.edworkingpapers.com/ai20-188">Air Filters, Pollution, and Student Achievement</a>” that looks at the surprising consequences of the <a href="https://www.cpuc.ca.gov/aliso/">Aliso Canyon gas leak</a> in 2015.</p></div><p>The impact of the air filters is strikingly large given what a simple change we’re talking about. The school district didn’t reengineer the school buildings or make dramatic education reforms; they just installed $700 commercially available filters that you could plug into any room in the country. But it’s consistent with a <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2019/12/11/20996968/air-pollution-cognitive-impact">growing literature on the cognitive impact of air pollution</a>, which finds that everyone from <a href="http://conference.iza.org/conference_files/environ_2019/palacios_j24419.pdf">chess players</a> to <a href="https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/698728">baseball umpires</a> to <a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w19944">workers in a pear-packing factory</a> suffer deteriorations in performance when the air is more polluted.</p><p>If Gilraine’s result holds up to further scrutiny, he will have identified what’s probably the single most cost-effective education policy intervention — one that should have particularly large benefits for low-income children.</p><p>And while it’s too hasty to draw sweeping conclusions on the basis of one study, it would be incredibly cheap to have a few cities experiment with installing air filters in some of their schools to get more data and draw clearer conclusions about exactly how much of a difference this makes.</p><div><p id="the-aliso-canyon-gas-leak-explained"><h2>The Aliso Canyon gas leak, explained</h2></p></div><p>Back on October 23, 2015, employees of the Southern California Gas Company discovered a massive leak in the Aliso Canyon natural gas storage facility near Porter Ranch in the San Fernando Valley. Significant for the larger purposes of the study, the Porter Ranch area is known for having “<a href="https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2008-jan-06-re-guide6-story.html">some of the cleanest air in the Valley year-round</a>.”</p><p>The gas leak was a huge catastrophe from the standpoint of greenhouse gas emissions, but also naturally raised concerns in the local community about the immediate impact on public health.</p><p>Facing political pressure from concerned parents and teachers, Gilraine writes, “the Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) and the owner of the gas well, the Southern California Gas Company, placed air filters in every classroom, office and common area in all schools within five miles of the gas leak at the end of January 2016.”</p><p>Strikingly, however, air testing conducted around the time of the installation of the filters shows that the schools didn’t actually have abnormally high levels of the kinds of pollution that are normally associated with natural gas. Methane is lighter than air, and by the time the filters were installed — nearly three months after the leak — the extra pollution caused was all the way up in the sky and not affecting school buildings.</p><p>Consequently, the installation of the filters served not to remove extra contamination caused by the leak, but simply to clean up the normal amount of background indoor air pollution present in the Valley. That lets Gilraine estimate the difference in student performance for schools just inside the boundary compared to those just outside.</p><p>He finds that math scores went up by 0.20 standard deviations and English scores by 0.18 standard deviations, and the results hold up even when you control for “detailed student demographics, including residential ZIP Code fixed effects that help control for a student’s exposure to pollution at home.”</p><p>For context, this is comparable in scale to some of the most optimistic studies on the potential benefits of smaller class sizes, with <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/research/class-size-what-research-says-and-what-it-means-for-state-policy/">Alan Krueger finding that cutting class size by a third</a> leads to a 0.22 standard deviation improvement in academic performance. Other studies find smaller or even negative effects (because adding teachers means bringing in less experienced or less effective ones), but even accepting the positive findings, it costs much more than $700 per classroom to achieve class size reductions of that scale.</p><div><p id="this-is-a-big-but-not-implausible-number"><h2>This is a big, but not implausible, number</h2></p></div><p>The effect Gilraine finds is strikingly large given that it’s a seemingly trivial intervention.</p><p>But Sefi Roth of the London School of Economics studied university students’ test performance relative to air pollution levels on the day of the test alone<em>. </em>He found that taking a test in a filtered rather than unfiltered room would raise test scores by 0.09 standard deviations. That’s about half the impact Gilraine found, just based on day-of-test air quality. In Gilraine’s natural experiment, students benefited from cleaner air for about four months. Given that context, it’s not incredibly surprising that you could see an impact that’s about twice as large.</p><p>What’s natural to ask — though unknowable from the study before us — is how much more change we could see if students benefited from an entire school year of clean air. Or perhaps an entire school career, from pre-K through high school graduation, of clean air.</p><p>One striking thing about this is the government has long been aware that indoor air pollution is a potential problem. But according to currently prevailing <a href="https://www.epa.gov/indoor-air-quality-iaq/introduction-indoor-air-quality">Indoor Air Quality standards</a>, there was nothing wrong with the air in the schools. Filters were installed because of an essentially unwarranted panic about natural gas.</p><p>And while Los Angeles is a fairly high-pollution part of the country, outdoor particulate levels are higher in many areas — including New York, Chicago, and Houston — than they were in the impacted neighborhood. In other words, there’s no reason to think the impacted schools were unusually deficient in their air quality. They just happen to be the ones that installed filters.</p><div><p id="a-cheap-scalable-initiative"><h2>A cheap, scalable initiative</h2></p></div><div><p>For a sense of scale, <a href="http://www.kipp.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/kipp_scale-up_es.pdf">Mathematica Policy Research’s best evidence on the effectiveness of the highly touted KIPP charter school network</a> finds that after three years at KIPP there is significant improvement on three out of four test metrics — up 0.25 standard deviations on one English test, 0.22 standard deviations on another, and 0.28 standard deviations on one of two math tests.</p></div><p>Those are big gains, and they help explain why there is so much enthusiasm about KIPP in some quarters, even as charter schools remain politically controversial and charters in general seem to produce roughly average results.</p><p>This is bigger than the impact of letting kids benefit from clean air for four months. But installing the full suite of air filters costs about $1,000 per classroom, and continuing to operate them beyond the first year is cheaper than that. And best of all, unlike totally reworking school operations, it could be scaled up very quickly.</p><p>It would be almost trivially easy to get a variety of school districts all around the country to randomly select schools for the installation of air filters. That would rapidly generate a ton of additional data, and if the results continued to be promising, the initiative could be made universal very quickly.</p><p>The benefits, on their face, would be extremely large at a relatively low cost. And since air pollution is generally worse in lower-income communities, you would not only raise test scores nationally, but make progress on the big socioeconomic gaps in student achievement that have proven very difficult to remedy.</p></div></div>]]></description>

Photo by Lev Radin/Pacific Press/LightRocket via Getty Images</em></figcaption></figure></div><p><span>In a developing story, it appears the Trump administration is quietly targeting </span><em>even more </em><span>students for deportation and doing so in a way that is taking universities and the students themselves completely by surprise.</span></p><p><span>According to documentation seen by </span><strong>Zeteo</strong><span> and interviews with university officials, the administration is deploying the rarely-used risk-to-foreign-policy immigration provision they used to detain Mahmoud Khalil to now target students across the country.</span></p><p>University officials say that targeted students hail from the Middle East and Muslim-majority countries. They’ve also reported inconsistent notification patterns: some students have been informed about the revocations by the government, some have not; some only found out after officials manually checked internal visa status databases – while universities and officials themselves have mostly seemed to not be informed by the government.</p><p><span>The Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) appears to be </span><em>manually</em><span> revoking students’ immigration status – an authority typically left to university staff. And some students and universities are not even being made aware of those revocations – setting students up to be taken by immigration agents without even knowing it was coming.</span></p><p>Three university officials, who were given anonymity so they could speak freely, across the country report that, in recent days, student residency statuses in the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System – SEVIS, a database where residency statuses of foreign students are managed – are being changed without their knowledge.</p><p><span>Samah Sisay of the Center for Constitutional Rights told </span><strong>Zeteo</strong><span> that one’s visa being revoked does </span><em>not</em><span> mean that their status would be too. Unlike student visas – which are entry documents that allow someone to enter the country – student </span><em>statuses </em><span>are what allow people to stay in the US. To maintain one’s status, a student has to fulfill certain requirements, like being properly enrolled in classes, keeping documents up to date, and following work restrictions.</span></p><p><span>A student’s </span><em>visa</em><span> could expire or be revoked for any number of reasons, but that wouldn’t necessarily mean their </span><em>status</em><span> to stay would be taken away, too. Some of these </span><em>statuses,</em><span> which are typically overseen by university officers, are now allegedly being unilaterally revoked by ICE instead. While university officers often oversee status in the SEVIS system, Sisay said that DHS can technically revoke status without a university actively disenrolling a student.</span></p><p>Still, the practice is alarming students and university staff across the country. As one official put it, “Someone at ICE pushed a button, and now [students] are ‘illegal’ through a process that absolutely should not be happening.”</p><p><span>According to documentation seen by </span><strong>Zeteo</strong><span> and university officials across the country, the unusual termination of students’ statuses has occurred just in recent days, as Secretary of State Marco Rubio has announced that the State Department has revoked at least 300 visas.</span></p><p><span>The reason? The same little-used rationale the State Department used to detain and attempt to deport Mahmoud Khalil, and an increasing string of students since then: A provision of </span><a href="https://zeteo.com/p/marco-rubio-personally-signed-off" rel="">Section 237 of the Immigration and Nationality Act</a><span> — targeting students on the basis that their presence would have "potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences" for the US.</span></p><p><span>In one case, a student was reportedly notified by the US that their visa was revoked per Section 221(i) of the act – which enables the Secretary of State to revoke visas per their “discretion” – and then that their </span><em>status</em><span> was terminated by Section 237.</span></p><p>In multiple cases, the US cited both the foreign policy provision and another portion of Section 237 to assert that the student was "otherwise failing to maintain their status.”</p><p><span>This </span><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/reichlinmelnick.bsky.social/post/3llh2kp2zjs23" rel="">appears to be what happened</a><span> to Tufts University graduate student </span><a href="https://zeteo.com/p/watch-the-moment-masked-ice-agents" rel="">Rumeysa Ozturk</a><span>, who was detained by masked immigration authorities on Tuesday.</span></p><p>Some university officials are discovering these by sheer accident, encountering the changes as they look through the SEVIS database.</p><p><span>A State Department spokesperson told </span><strong>Zeteo </strong><span>that</span><strong> </strong><span>the department “has broad authority to revoke visas under Section 221(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA),” and that they “exercise that authority when information comes to light indicating that a visa holder may be no longer be eligible for a visa.”</span></p><p>“Generally, the Department is not required to notify an individual of a visa revocation but does so when the Department determines it is practicable,” the spokesperson continued, adding that “the number of revocations is dynamic.”</p><p><span>DHS and the White House did not respond to </span><strong>Zeteo's</strong><span> requests for comment.</span></p><p><span>While much of the discourse surrounding college campuses has revolved around Ivy League colleges, virtually all the cases </span><strong>Zeteo</strong><span> reviewed occurred at state schools across the country.</span></p><p><span>As with several of the recent high-profile cases involving individuals whisked off the street, it’s unclear what </span><em>actual</em><span> grounds have justified the revocation. One university official told </span><strong>Zeteo</strong><span> that a student from the Middle East whose status was revoked said they had not attended protests or had social media posts that might have triggered the move (recall, Rubio’s State Department is reportedly </span><a href="https://www.democracynow.org/2025/3/7/headlines/state_department_deploys_ai_to_deny_visas_to_visitors_with_pro_palestinian_views" rel="">using</a><span> artificial intelligence to monitor social media and revoke student visas).</span></p><p data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://zeteo.com/p/ice-manually-revoking-university-students-residency-status-middle-east?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a href="https://zeteo.com/p/ice-manually-revoking-university-students-residency-status-middle-east?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share" rel=""><span>Share</span></a></p><p>As one university official described the dynamic between student visas and student statuses: “What we appear to be seeing now is that there's no difference, there's no daylight between the two; that there are cancellations happening in SEVIS by the government; we don't really know if all students are getting notified or if some are getting notified…the schools are not getting notified.”</p><p>“We’ve really…never seen something like this, where it is so directly tied together,” they added.</p><p><em><strong>***</strong><span> If you are a student affected by this, or have relevant information about these developments, please contact me via </span><a href="mailto:Prem@zeteonews.com" rel="">email</a><span> or Signal (premthakker.35).</span></em></p><p><em><strong>Prem Thakker</strong><span> is </span><strong>Zeteo’s</strong><span> political reporter.

[0]</p><p>A ray-casting engine is an old style of game engine (think 1990 - Wolfenstein or Duke Nukem). The most famous, well-known example is probably Wolfenstein-3D created by ID software (John Carmack and John Romero etc!) You don’t see these engines used anymore in modern games.</p><p>So to me, they are novel and a great challenge to try and modernise. And for further context, raycasted levels are usually teeny tiny (Wolfenstein 3D or Shadow Warrior are the largest worlds I’ve seen, so nothing impressively scaled). I have never ever come across a raycaster with levels the scale of something like Minecraft. So that’s what my ambition is.</p><p>I spent a period of 2-3 months roughly 8-10 hour days every day on this project, not knowing much C and not knowing anything about game engines or graphics, and average at mathematics.</p><p>But I’m on a break from the project and coding after my 7 year relationship broke down.
 Realised I had tunnel vision with my life and ambitions, and am now “touching grass” daily instead. It’s hard to put effort into your hobbies when you feel other areas of your life are suffering.</p><p>So now I’m lifting weights and doing cardio and reading books instead, trying to keep active and my mind occupied.</p><p>I do want to pick this project back up, I’m really proud of what I was able to achieve with no knowledge coming in and I think the project has good bones.</p><p>And I loved coding, still haven’t found a hobby that scratches a similar itch</p><p>[0] - <a href="https://github.com/con-dog/chunked-z-level-raycaster/blob/master/README.md" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/con-dog/chunked-z-level-raycaster/blob/ma...</a></p></div></td></tr>

Basically, it is a dynamic execution environment using lua that can have full rewind-ability (for complete execution tracing) and pausing - you can execute some code then wait a week or so to continue execution. The idea is you can have a dynamic environment for executing biology experiments where the route changes on the basis of outcomes - something I haven't really seen anywhere else. Then I focused a bit on the pedagogy of LLMs so that you can ask an LLM to generate a protocol, and then when you execute it and get unexpected results, it can automatically debug its own protocol using a code sandbox.</p><p>It all sounds decent in theory but the difference is I actually implemented it and ran a real biology experiment with it (albeit a simple one that I knew wouldn't work)</p><p>Demo here: <a href="https://github.com/koeng101/autodemo" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/koeng101/autodemo</a> (probably watch the video)</p></div></td></tr>

[1] is an interactive fretboard tool for guitarists. I wasn’t quite happy with the way existing tools approached visualization, so I made my own. Too many felt littered with ads or just didn’t work the way I was hoping for.</p><p>It goes beyond just plotting notes there are options to show scales using intervals, roots, note names, etc., plus a chord mode that highlights triads, voicings, and inversions. I’ve found it useful for routine practice start the built-in metronome, pick a voicing or scale pattern, and run through it in time.</p><p>There are also pages covering theory topics like modes and progressions, but the fretboard’s the main draw. It’s something I built for myself and figured others might get some use out of too. I plan to keep adding to it as I think of more things I want to reference probably adding support for additional strings or tunings next?</p><p>The other solves a very specific problem (mostly out of laziness) I do most of my playing using the standalone Neural DSP application on Windows, but I don’t really want to do any mixing in it. So I built a dead simple recording application [2] that doesn’t require firing up a DAW, but still offers a decent UX. It lets me quickly capture riffs and ideas, and later I can just send them to my Mac for mixing if anything seems promising. Haven’t shipped it yet, but I’ve been using it daily and having some friends try it out.</p><p>[1] <a href="https://www.theorycrvft.com/fretboard" rel="nofollow">https://www.theorycrvft.com/fretboard</a></p><p>[2] <a href="https://theorycrvft.gumroad.com/l/otocapture" rel="nofollow">https://theorycrvft.gumroad.com/l/otocapture</a></p></div></td></tr>

The implication here is that the program probably doesn't need a whole lot of interpreter cycles to figure out this single byte each time (given reasonable context size). However, the downside is that you only get 256 levels of signal to work with at tournament selection time. There isn't much gradient when comparing candidates on a specific task.</p><p>The full sequence prediction architecture is expected to produce the entire output (i.e., context window size) for each UTM program invocation. This implies that we may need a much larger # of interpreter cycles to play with each time. However, we get a far richer gradient to work with at fitness compare time (100-1000 bytes).</p><p>Other options could involve bringing BPE into my life, but I really want to try to think different for now. If I take the bitter lesson as strongly as possible, tokenization and related techniques (next token prediction) could be framed as clever tricks that a different computational model could avoid.</p></div></td></tr>

It solves one problem really well:</p><p><i>Capture everything going on in the Family.</i></p><p>Let me elaborate. Families attempt to use a Shared Calendar when things get hectic, but they don't capture everything going on, because most of these events are just too tedious to enter into a traditional Calendar. Voice Assistants are not tailored to capture the kinds of Events that families have. Examples below. So, families either don't use a Calendar, or one person in the family ends up spending too much time keeping everything in sync.</p><p>Examples of flexible events that KIN can handle:
1. Aditi has School board meeting on second Tuesday of every month.
2. Aadi has chess on Tuesdays and Thursdays from 6 to 7, and Saturdays at 11.
3. Rushi has after-school Soccer every Wednesday starting April 3rd, for 10 weeks.
4. Create events from Screenshots or Photos.</p><p>Coming in next Release:
- Send Reminders to other members in the Family! e.g, Remind Aditi to pick up Rushi from School tomorrow at 3 pm.</p></div></td></tr>

To give an idea of time frame,  this was before people were using ReLU.</p><p>Going back to it after the recent advances was incredible seeing how much has happened.   So many times I'd see something and wondered how I could have missed it the first time only to realise it hadn't been invented yet when I did things last time.</p><p>It feels like there is a much higher focus on statistical mathematics now in a way that it permeates everything.   That in itself requires a whole lot of new learning to get to grips with, but I also feel like there might be some value in looking at a lot of these things from a different perspective.    I think I tend to look at things from a more geometric point of view.</p><p>In that vein I  have been looking at some transformers using unit n-sphere embeddings with V values as geodesics, just to see what happens.</p><p>As I learn new things, I keep finding fun new ideas to muck around with,  I'm just an amateur, so I'm not really restricted by areas I look at.   Today I'm wondering about whether Wasserstein distance could be quickly approximated by a learnable method (especially if the inputs had access to parts of the ml components that generated the things being Wasserstein compared).</p><p>I'm almost certainly treading ground well explored by others, but my way of learning seems to be to rapidly jump between many different things picking up a small understanding of each as I go until I just seem to know things that I didn't before.   Focusing on a topic and pushing in that direction never seemed to work for me so much.   This is probably why I am an amateur :-)</p></div></td></tr>

At the moment, it only creates, forwards, and records MIDI note events, so it can't produce audio on its own. It has to be connected to external or virtual MIDI devices that can create sound. Turns out this is too much of a hassle and kind of a deal-breaker for most people (and to be fair, it <i>is</i> a hassle), so now I'm working on adding VST hosting support directly inside the app. If you're not familiar, VST (Steinberg Virtual Studio Technology) is pretty much the industry standard plugin system that most DAWs support. Different VSTs can create and filter audio data, and in a hosted context audio data can be sent between VST instances before going out to the speakers.</p><p>It's been tricky but interesting. VST plugins are basically packaged as DLL files of Windows COM(-ish) objects. Despite primarily being a Windows dev myself, I never worked directly with COM libraries or objects before. My app is written in C#, and .NET does have built-in "COM Interop" support, so it is possible. A few years ago, .NET added a new COM Interop Source Generator system [2, 3], and I'm trying to get it working with that. So far I've been making some progress, but it's still a lot of tedious work to setup.</p><p>(There are libraries/packages out there that implement VST in .NET already, but they mostly focus on plugin creation while I only need hosting. They're a lot heavier and more capable than I need. They also didn't use the newer Source Generator approach, so I figured I'd give it a shot myself.)</p><p>1. <a href="https://www.pulselyre.com/" rel="nofollow">https://www.pulselyre.com/</a></p><p>2. <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/native-interop/comwrappers-source-generation" rel="nofollow">https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/native-int...</a></p><p>3. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZd1SGd7dSU" rel="nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZd1SGd7dSU</a></p></div></td></tr>

It's still very early days, but I'm soo close to finally being willing to share it.</p><p>Close enough to Postgres that apps think it's Postgres, but also runnable as a library like SQLite -- best of both worlds! And then if you're willing to not limit yourself to Postgres compatibility, you also get fancy new technologies like <i>unsigned integers in a database</i>! (Old SQL ecosystem is sometimes ridiculous.)</p><p>My personal journey goes something like this:</p><p>I've always suffered from both SQLite and Postgres idiosyncrasies, and almost always when deploying I've wanted to start out small, not have a big dedicated database server, and have meaningful tests that don't have multi-gigabyte dependencies and runtime assumptions. The idea of having something "close enough to Postgres to not have to learn much new" database with the low-end abilities of SQLite is something I've been wanting for roughly as long as I've known about SQLite -- even more so if it could also replace Postgres and remove the fear of differences between dev/early-stage vs later.</p><p>Much later, I learned about the newly-fashionable OLAP-over-object-store architectures, and I learned about Parquet. That lead to discovering Arrow and DataFusion. Arrow is an in-memory data format intended to be a standard interchange layer. It's basically array per column, which isn't exactly point-query oriented but helps make modern-day CPUs happy; quite well aligned with SIMD processing. DataFusion is a Rust framework that's essentially a query engine, and it has a decent query planner (arguably the hardest part of writing a database). RocksDB supports transactions and does MVCC, which is probably the second hardest part of writing a database. The rest just fell in place: sqlparser-rs is a Rust SQL syntax parser with Postgres etc compatibility nicely worked out. pgwire implements the Postgres wire protocol. Non-legacy clients can use FlightSQL and Arrow IPC for faster data transfer (Postgres wire protocol kinda sucks, it's that old). In-process use from Rust is darn trivial with DataFusion, and other languages can be dealt with by writing a C bridge -- once again, Arrow is an inter-language standard already, so all we need to do is to shove the result data buffers over to a more native "dataframe" library. It looks like I can actually glue these things together with less than a decade of effort!</p><p>There's lot to still worry about, but I'm feeling pretty positive about the project. And if and when I get to replace RocksDB with a pure-Rust data store that has all the right bells and whistles (in-house or not), the end result will be pure Rust, and aligned for modern world of NVMe, io_uring, and what not. That's a world I definitely want to live in.</p><p>Current status: Getting rid of the last `todo!()`s, unwraps etc that would distract from the "look at how robust this thing is" Rust evangelism too much. I need to put in stress tests and fault injection and make sure I'm configuring RocksDB right for transaction isolation and disk persistence. There's <i>tons</i> of missing features, but very few bugs-as-such (0 known that aren't about C++ integration), and missing features all return a decent explanatory error message instead of eating data. The darn thing already works as a SQL database -- largely because it's just DataFusion's query engine and me feeding it table scans. I wrote a SQL database without ever debugging a JOIN! The shortcuts I've been able to take due to help from preexisting projects are huge. For someone who grew up in the world of "every C project has to write basic data structures for themselves because C isn't very modular", it's downright amazing!</p></div></td></tr>

I'm trying to figure out how to TOFU a MFA HW token (yubikey) on first login so we don't even have to trust the IDP. The trick part is to design so if you lose your HW Token you aren't locked out without reintroducing trust. Maybe use a backup code or backup yubikey or the DKIM trick to allow timelocked resets of the HW Token via an email.</p>

				<p>Trump — just like the last time he was in office — is still pretending his bigoted anti-immigrant policies are only in place to ensure the US can rid itself of dangerous foreign criminals. But no one <em>really</em> <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2017/10/12/emails-show-ice-couldnt-find-enough-dangerous-immigrants-to-fulfill-adminstrations-fantasies/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.techdirt.com/2017/10/12/emails-show-ice-couldnt-find-enough-dangerous-immigrants-to-fulfill-adminstrations-fantasies/">believed that last time</a>. And with his return to the Oval Office, any pretense of fairness or concern for constitutional rights has vanished completely.</p>
<p>What we’re getting is <em>exactly</em> what Trump and his supporters want: <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20170126/11283536574/new-trump-executive-order-says-federal-agencies-should-exclude-foreigners-privacy-protections.shtml" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20170126/11283536574/new-trump-executive-order-says-federal-agencies-should-exclude-foreigners-privacy-protections.shtml">the vanishing/banishment</a> of anyone who <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2025/03/04/trumps-anti-woke-task-force-is-combining-sloppy-search-terms-with-nearly-nonexistent-vetting/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.techdirt.com/2025/03/04/trumps-anti-woke-task-force-is-combining-sloppy-search-terms-with-nearly-nonexistent-vetting/">isn’t a straight white male</a>. So, we get what we’re seeing here: the unlawful arrest and detainment of a legal US resident just because ICE knows that, under this regime, it will never really be held accountable for its actions.</p>
<p>Here’s the disturbing latest , <a href="https://www.wbez.org/immigration/2025/03/13/chicago-attorneys-accuse-federal-agents-of-violating-immigrants-rights-and-take-legal-action" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.wbez.org/immigration/2025/03/13/chicago-attorneys-accuse-federal-agents-of-violating-immigrants-rights-and-take-legal-action">reported by Adrian Cardona-Maguigad for WBEZ-Chicago</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>The 22 cases include Chicago resident Julio Noriega, 54, a U.S. citizen who, according to court documents, was arrested, handcuffed and spent most of the night at an ICE processing center in suburban Broadview. He was never questioned about his citizenship and was only released after agents looked at his ID.</em></p>
<p><em>“I was born in Chicago, Illinois and am a United States citizen,” Noriega said in his statement, adding that on Jan. 31, after buying pizza in Berwyn he was surrounded by ICE agents and arrested. Officers took away his wallet, which had his ID and social security card. “They then handcuffed me and pushed me into a white van where other people were handcuffed as well.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>That’s sickening, especially since this all could have been cleared up prior to the arrest and the subsequent several hours of detainment if ICE officers had bothered to check the ID and social security card officers seized from Noriega’s person while they had Julio Noreiga’s actual person. Instead, the officers apparently felt Noriega needed to be subjected to the worst parts of the “justice” system, putting his rights on the back burner until they felt like getting around to verifying the <em>only</em> facts relevant to this arrest.</p>
<p>You’ll notice the opening paragraph refers to <em>22</em> cases. That’s because ICE has managed to reawaken <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/6952165/castanon-nava-v-department-of-homeland-security/?filed_after=&amp;filed_before=&amp;entry_gte=&amp;entry_lte=&amp;order_by=desc" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/6952165/castanon-nava-v-department-of-homeland-security/?filed_after=&amp;filed_before=&amp;entry_gte=&amp;entry_lte=&amp;order_by=desc">mostly dormant legal proceedings</a> brought against it by Immigrant Justice with it cavalier approach to immigration enforcement and the civil rights immigrants and US citizens are entitled to.</p>
<p>ICE had already agreed to knock off this shit more than a half-decade ago, shortly after Trump took office for the first time and initiated his first war on immigrants. </p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Attorneys say these actions violate the&nbsp;<a href="https://immigrantjustice.org/NavaSettlement" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nava Settlement</a>&nbsp;— a 2018 class-action lawsuit filed in response to unlawful arrests by ICE agents who used traffic stops and other tactics to make arrests without a warrant.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Noriega is one of the 22 people listed in the <a href="https://immigrantjustice.org/sites/default/files/uploaded-files/no-content-type/2025-03/164-Nava-v-DHS_Motion-to-Enforce-the-Settlement_03-13-25.pdf" data-type="link" data-id="https://immigrantjustice.org/sites/default/files/uploaded-files/no-content-type/2025-03/164-Nava-v-DHS_Motion-to-Enforce-the-Settlement_03-13-25.pdf">Immigrant Justice filing</a> [PDF]. Multiple others have been arrested and detained without legal basis in recent weeks. Some have been arrested despite ICE officers making it clear they were actually searching for someone else. In many of the cases listed, administrative arrest warrants are being written after arrests have already taken place, using backdated forms that contain pre-written signatures that don’t match the names of the arresting officers. In other cases, crucial information that would pertain to the arrest supposedly justified by the post-facto warrant is missing completely, including the justification for arrest (rather than a simple summons), which is supposed to contain facts that indicate the immigrant being arrested poses a flight risk.</p>
<p>Here’s how that went for Noriega, who is a legitimate US citizen who definitely can’t be arrested without a real warrant (and not the administrative warrants ICE uses). This is from the Immigrant Justice filing asking the court to enforce the stipulations of the settlement it obtained from ICE back in 2018. </p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Julio Noriega is 54 years old, was born in Chicago, and is a U.S. citizen. On January 31, 2025, he was walking near the corner of Cermak Road and Harlem Avenue in Berwyn, Illinois, handing out his resume to local businesses. As he walked out of a Jiffy Lube, he was approached by ICE officers who grabbed and handcuffed him and put him into a van, without an opportunity to explain his citizenship. The officers drove Julio and others around for more than an hour before bringing him to an ICE processing center, where he remained, still handcuffed, for several more hours. All the while, Julio had a wallet containing identification that ICE had confiscated. The officers never showed Julio a warrant, and they did not ask him any questions to ascertain whether he was a noncitizen or a flight risk. After about 10 hours, ICE officers reviewed the contents of Julio’s wallet, realized he was a U.S. citizen, and released him with no money and no paperwork</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>ICE has refused to comment on its warrantless arrest and detainment of an American citizen, citing the “ongoing litigation.” But I’m sure those heading ICE and the DHS are fine with what’s happened here. Some collateral damage is expected when the government engages in bigotry-as-a-service. That it happened to someone with a Latin surname makes it so much easier for ICE, DHS, and Trump’s death cult to swallow. That Noriega has more right to remain in this country than, say, Elon Musk, ultimately doesn’t matter. ICE isn’t looking for dangerous foreign criminals. All it’s looking for is certain skin tones.</p>

<p>A potential supply chain attack on GitHub CodeQL started simply: a publicly exposed secret, valid for 1.022 seconds at a time.</p>



<p>In that second, an attacker could take a series of steps that would allow them to execute code within a GitHub Actions workflow in most repositories using CodeQL, GitHub’s code analysis engine trusted by hundreds of thousands of repositories. The impact would reach both public GitHub (GitHub Cloud) and GitHub Enterprise.</p>



<p>If backdooring GitHub Actions sounds familiar, that’s because it’s exactly what threat actors did in the recent tj-actions/changed-files supply chain attack. Imagine that very same supply chain attack, but instead of backdooring actions in tj-actions, they backdoored actions in GitHub CodeQL.</p>



<p>An attacker could use this to:</p>



<ol>
<li><strong>Compromise intellectual property</strong> by exfiltrating the source code of private repositories using CodeQL.</li>



<li><strong>Steal credentials within GitHub Actions secrets</strong> of workflow jobs using CodeQL and leverage those secrets to execute further supply chain attacks.</li>



<li><strong>Execute code on internal infrastructure</strong> running CodeQL workflows.</li>



<li><strong>Compromise GitHub Actions secrets</strong> of workflows using the GitHub Actions Cache within a repo that uses CodeQL.</li>
</ol>



<p>This is the story of how we uncovered an exposed secret leading to a race condition, a potential supply chain attack, and CVE-2025-24362.</p>



<p><em>Note: Per <a href="https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-vqf5-2xx6-9wfm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GitHub’s advisory</a>, they have found no evidence of compromise to its platform or systems.</em></p>



<h2>How Did We Get Here?</h2>



<p>In January 2025, I took a break from Praetorian’s <a href="https://www.praetorian.com/services/red-team/">Red Team</a> and began three months of research. I aimed to push the limits of public GitHub Actions exploitation, building on presentations we’ve given at <a href="https://johnstawinski.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/us24-khan-stawinski-self-hosted-github-cicd-runners-continuous-integration-continuous-destruction.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Hat</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5P7KatZBr_I" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DEF CON</a>, <a href="https://www.praetorian.com/blog/introducing-gato-for-ci-cd-exploitation/">Schmoocon</a>, and Black Hat Arsenal. Tools and takeaways from this research will be implemented in our <a href="https://www.praetorian.com/services/ci-cd-security-engagement/">CI/CD Professional Services Engagements</a>, and into <a href="https://www.praetorian.com/chariot/">Chariot</a>, our Continuous Threat Exposure Management platform.</p>



<p>I began my research rotation by scanning GitHub Actions workflow artifacts for secrets.</p>



<h2>Secret Scanning</h2>



<p>In August 2024, Palo Alto researcher Yaron Avital <a href="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/github-repo-artifacts-leak-tokens/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">published an article</a> about identifying secrets in workflow artifacts. I had a hunch that there were still secrets to be found, especially since there hadn’t been much public follow-up work since the article.</p>



<p>I built a simple Actions Artifacts Secret Scanner to get started. It downloads artifacts from GitHub Actions workflows, recursively extracts their contents, and scans their contents for secrets with <a href="https://github.com/praetorian-inc/noseyparker">Nosey Parker</a>, Praetorian’s open-sourced secrets scanning tool.</p>



<p>The Actions Artifacts Secret Scanner has been integrated into Chariot and open-sourced as a <a href="https://github.com/praetorian-inc/gato">Gato</a> capability.</p>



<p>After running this scanner for one day, it found a secret that could lead to a supply chain attack on GitHub CodeQL.</p>



<p>But first, I needed to see if the key was usable.</p>



<h2>Background</h2>



<p>CI/CD vulnerabilities sound complicated until you understand the terminology. Let’s catch you up.</p>



<p>GitHub Actions is a continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) platform that allows the execution of code specified within workflows as part of the CI/CD process. When you push code to a GitHub repository or create a pull request, GitHub Actions can automatically build, test, and deploy your code using workflows defined in YAML files.</p>



<p>For example, let’s say you are building a web application that is hosted in AWS. You can configure a GitHub Actions workflow so that whenever you push code to your repository, it is automatically tested and then deployed to AWS.</p>



<p><em>If you are new to GitHub Actions, we’d recommend reading through <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/actions/writing-workflows/quickstart" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">some examples</a>.</em></p>



<p><strong><em>Every workflow run generates a GITHUB_TOKEN</em></strong> — a special, automatically generated GitHub App installation token that allows the workflow to interact with the repository. This token’s permissions can be configured in the workflow file, at the repository level, or at the org level, determining what actions it can perform within the repository.</p>



<p>Put simply:</p>



<ul>
<li>GitHub workflows execute on GitHub runners (typically a VM or Docker containers).</li>



<li>GitHub runners need a way to authenticate to GitHub to do stuff the workflows tell them to do.</li>



<li>For that purpose, they use the GITHUB_TOKEN.</li>
</ul>



<p><br><strong>If the token has high privileges, then token compromise == bad.</strong></p>



<h3>What are Workflow Artifacts?</h3>



<p>We found the publicly exposed secret in a <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/actions/writing-workflows/choosing-what-your-workflow-does/storing-and-sharing-data-from-a-workflow" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GitHub Actions workflow artifact</a>.</p>



<p>GitHub Actions workflows can upload workflow “artifacts” to GitHub Actions. Workflow artifacts can be any file and are saved by that workflow for later use. By default, artifacts are publicly accessible to anyone with read access to the repository and are stored for up to 90 days.</p>



<h3>And Finally, What is CodeQL?</h3>



<p><a href="https://codeql.github.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CodeQL</a> is GitHub’s Code Analysis Engine. The CodeQL actions perform static code analysis on GitHub repositories to try and identify vulnerabilities. They have found <a href="https://securitylab.github.com/codeql-wall-of-fame/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">several hundred CVEs</a> over it’s lifetime, protecting organizations from breaches.</p>



<p>Security tools, like CodeQL, often need access to sensitive systems and data, making them an attractive target to an attacker.</p>



<p>If CodeQL was compromised, one of the most widely used security tools now becomes a backdoor.</p>



<h2>Finding the Token</h2>



<p>After running the Actions Artifact Secrets Scanner for a day, it picked up a token in a <a href="https://github.com/github/codeql-action">github/</a><a href="https://github.com/github/codeql-action" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">codeql-action</a> repository artifact published by <a href="https://github.com/github/codeql-action/actions/runs/12901573957">this </a><a href="https://github.com/github/codeql-action/actions/runs/12901573957" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">run</a>. The Actions Artifact Secrets Scanner downloaded the “my-debug-artifacts” zip uploaded by the “<a href="https://github.com/github/codeql-action/blob/f89b8a7d5239ba6d1a0f243ead94ea9ca5775ae1/.github/workflows/debug-artifacts-failure.yml">PR Check – Debug </a><a href="https://github.com/github/codeql-action/blob/f89b8a7d5239ba6d1a0f243ead94ea9ca5775ae1/.github/workflows/debug-artifacts-failure.yml" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">artifacts</a><a href="https://github.com/github/codeql-action/blob/f89b8a7d5239ba6d1a0f243ead94ea9ca5775ae1/.github/workflows/debug-artifacts-failure.yml"> after failure</a>” workflow, recursively extracted the “my-db-java-partial.zip” file stored inside, and ran Nosey Parker. Within seconds, Nosey Parker flagged a GitHub Token starting with “ghs_” in a crash report.</p>

<p><em>Investigating manually, I confirmed this was a GitHub App token installation token stored in a file containing the environment variables of the GitHub Runner executing the workflow.</em></p>



<h2>Investigating Impact</h2>



<p>Secrets compromise is cool, but what can we do with this token? The impact of a compromised<br><em>GITHUB_TOKEN</em> is minimal if it only has read permissions.</p>



<p>The easiest way to determine the privileges of a <em>GITHUB_TOKEN</em> is to look at workflow logs. To investigate this, I navigated to the “Setup Job” step of the workflow that uploaded the token.</p>

<p><em><strong>The GitHub token had full write privileges.</strong></em></p>



<p>We could spend a lot of time talking about <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/actions/writing-workflows/choosing-what-your-workflow-does/controlling-permissions-for-github_token">each privilege</a>, but let’s focus on the ones that are particularly interesting.</p>



<p>Contents: write – Allows the token to create branches, create tags, and upload release artifacts.<br>Actions: write – Allows you to work with Actions, including trigger workflow_dispatch events.<br>Packages: write – Allows the token to upload packages.</p>



<p>With these privileges, an attacker has a lot of potential for repository tampering, but there is still one issue. These tokens are only valid for the duration of their specific workflow job. That means that once the job is over, the token is useless. Three things needed to happen for an attacker to be able to abuse this token:</p>



<ol>
<li>The token needs to have some sort of write privileges (already confirmed).</li>



<li>The token needs to use V4 of the upload artifact API, as that is the only version that allows you to retrieve an artifact before the job is complete (and after the job is complete, the token is invalid.)</li>



<li>The time between uploading the artifact and completing the job needs to be great enough for us to download, extract, and use the token.</li>
</ol>



<p>If all of these conditions are met, this publicly exposed token could be used to launch a full scale supply chain attack on CodeQL. This was like finding out that the security guard was accidentally leaving their master key in plain sight for a brief moment, over and over again.</p>



<p>We had to determine if the guard left us enough time to steal the key and use it before they returned to their post.</p>



<p>Let’s investigate further. Tick, tock.</p>



<h3>Determining the Artifact Upload Version</h3>



<p>Identifying the artifact upload version is typically straightforward. If a workflow uses<br>actions/upload-artifact@v4***, we can retrieve the artifact before job completion. If it uses an earlier version, we cannot do so.</p>



<p>In this case, CodeQL wasn’t using the <a href="https://github.com/actions/upload-artifact" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">actions/upload-artifact</a> action; they were manually using the upload artifact client in the source code. Code comments indicated it used version 4. That was enough for me to continue.</p>



<p>Now we needed to determine if the job lasted long enough for us to retrieve and use the token.</p>



<h3>Calculating our Execution Time</h3>



<p>Looking at the raw GitHub logs for this workflow, we can see two key timestamps:</p>

<p>“Finalizing artifact upload” occurred at 17:22:09:888.</p>



<p>The final step in the job, “Cleaning up orphan processes”, happened at 17:22:10:911.</p>



<p>That means we had approximately 1.022 seconds to download the artifact, extract the GitHub token, and use it. I noticed the token stayed valid for about a second after the “Cleaning up orphan processes” step, so we’ll call it two seconds.</p>



<p>The guard was giving us two seconds to steal the key and use it before they returned.<br>Is that enough time for an attacker to use this token? Or is this another theoretical vulnerability?</p>



<h2>Start Your Engines</h2>



<p>To test this, I made a Python script <em>artifact_racer.py</em>. Artifact racer performs the following actions.</p>



<ol>
<li>Continuously queries the <em>github/codeql-action</em> GitHub repository until it sees a “PR Check – Debug artifacts after failure” workflow begin.</li>



<li>Monitors the running workflow for artifacts.</li>



<li>Once it sees a “PR Check – Debug artifacts after failure” workflow run, it downloads the artifact and extracts the <em>GITHUB_TOKEN</em>.
<ul>
<li>Shelling out for file operations and downloads was key to increasing the speed, although there are probably ways to make it even faster.</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>Uses the <em>GITHUB_TOKEN</em> to make a new branch.</li>



<li>Use the <em>GITHUB_TOKEN</em> to push an empty file named <code>poc.txt</code> to that branch.</li>



<li><strong>Makes a new tag</strong> for that commit.</li>
</ol>



<p>If I could make a new branch, add a file, and create a tag for that commit, that would prove an attacker could use the token for nefarious purposes before it expired.</p>



<p>Given that the workflow artifact was only ~21MBs, I thought we had a chance. After successfully executing against a test repository, I moved on to the <a href="https://github.com/github/codeql-action">github/codeql-action</a> repository.</p>

<h2>Executing the Proof of Concept</h2>



<p>I ran the racer.</p>



<p>And then I waited.</p>



<p>About two hours later, a “PR Check – Debug artifacts after failure” workflow executed. The racer successfully retrieved the <em>GITHUB_TOKEN</em>, created the branch, pushed the file, and added the tag.</p>

<p><em>The ability to create a tag becomes very important in this attack. Keep that in mind as we go.</em></p>



<p>After confirming the <em>GITHUB_TOKEN</em> could be used within the short time window, we responsibly disclosed this vulnerability to GitHub.</p>



<h2>What if You’re Still Not Impressed?</h2>



<p><strong>Using the GITHUB_TOKEN, an attacker could add malicious code to any unprotected branch</strong>. A covert tactic would be to target feature branches pre-merge, smuggle in a small malicious code change, and wait for it to get merged. This would be especially effective due to how frequently the GitHub Actions bot commits to the CodeQL Actions repository.</p>



<p>They could also add tags that point to specific commits. For example, if they had malicious code on a branch and then added a v3 tag, anyone who manually used codeql-action…@v3 would execute the malicious code. <strong>More on this later</strong>.</p>



<p>Through code execution, you’d be able to compromise any GitHub Actions secret used within that job, as well as exfiltrate the source code of that repository. If their actions were executing on internal infrastructure, which is common with <a href="https://www.praetorian.com/blog/self-hosted-github-runners-are-backdoors/">self-hosted GitHub runners</a>, you’d also have code execution on their internal network or cloud environment.</p>



<p><strong>The impact from this attack would have been very similar to the recent tj-actions/changed-files supply chain attack.</strong></p>



<p><strong>T</strong>his impact is impressive, but it doesn’t quite live up to the claims I made in the beginning. Yes, through these paths, they could launch a supply chain attack against repos manually using the CodeQL actions. However, most organizations don’t include these actions manually. They just go into their repository settings, click “Enable CodeQL”, and go from there.</p>



<p>At first, I assumed that enabling CodeQL in your repository didn’t interact with the github/codeql-action repository at all.</p>



<p><strong><em>I was wrong.</em></strong></p>



<h2>Exponential Impact</h2>



<p>After discussing this issue with some colleagues, I decided to investigate further. What actually happens when you enable CodeQL?</p>



<p><strong>This section is key to understanding the full impact of this vulnerability.</strong> Stick with me.</p>



<p>To investigate, I created my own public repository, “John’s Top Secret Repo”, and enabled CodeQL.</p>



<p>After you enable CodeQL with the default settings, a special GitHub Actions workflow runs in your repository. This CodeQL action won’t show up in your repository workflows, but you can navigate to the workflow logs to see what it is doing.</p>

<p>If this doesn’t shock you, look again. Remember that we have the ability to push tags to the <em>github/codeql-action</em> repository.</p>



<p>CodeQL, under the hood, is executing the actions in the <em>github/codeql-action</em> repository, using the commit referenced by the <em>v3</em> tag. This tag was not immutable, and they were not using <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-for-github-actions/security-guides/security-hardening-for-github-actions">workflow pinning</a> (which GitHub recommends), which meant that an attacker could overwrite the v3 tag using the compromised <em>GITHUB_TOKEN</em>. Now, if an attacker removed and then added a v3 tag to their malicious commit, every single repository using the default CodeQL workflow would execute their malicious code.</p>

<p><em>The Action created when selecting “Advanced CodeQL” also used the reusable github/codeql-action with the v3 tag.</em></p>



<p>The CodeQL actions check out the source code of every repository they run on, which means that a malicious CodeQL action could exfiltrate the source code of any repository using default CodeQL configurations.</p>



<p>This would result in significant disclosure of intellectual property. And if you’ve ever operated on a Red Team, you know how many hardcoded secrets are lying around in private source code repositories.</p>



<h2>But Wait, There’s More</h2>



<p>We’re almost done. But remember, I promised one more thing:</p>



<p><em>4. Compromise GitHub Actions secrets of any workflow using the GitHub Actions Cache within a repo that uses CodeQL</em></p>



<p>When assessing the impact of CI/CD attack paths, I look for ways to compromise GitHub Actions secrets. Usually, those secrets are where the crown jewels live.</p>



<p>If the CodeQL action is executing with write privileges or alongside GitHub Actions secrets, then it’s trivial to use the code execution to exfiltrate those secrets. But the default CodeQL action uses a <em>GITHUB_TOKEN</em> that only has read privileges, so you can’t perform repository write operations, backdoor releases, or use fancy workflow dispatch events to steal secrets, <a href="https://johnstawinski.com/2024/01/11/playing-with-fire-how-we-executed-a-critical-supply-chain-attack-on-pytorch/">like what happened with</a><a href="https://johnstawinski.com/2024/01/11/playing-with-fire-how-we-executed-a-critical-supply-chain-attack-on-pytorch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> </a><a href="https://johnstawinski.com/2024/01/11/playing-with-fire-how-we-executed-a-critical-supply-chain-attack-on-pytorch/">PyTorch</a>.</p>



<p>What the default CodeQL action <em>does</em> do is execute in the main branch of the repository. The main branch of any GitHub repository can write cache entries that will be used by the entire repo. This opens up an opportunity to conduct <strong>GitHub Actions cache poisoning</strong>.</p>



<p>GitHub Actions Cache Poisoning is thoroughly explained <a href="https://adnanthekhan.com/2024/05/06/the-monsters-in-your-build-cache-github-actions-cache-poisoning/">in this </a><a href="https://adnanthekhan.com/2024/05/06/the-monsters-in-your-build-cache-github-actions-cache-poisoning/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">article</a> by Adnan Khan, which documents the discovery and exploitation of cache poisoning. The easiest way to conduct GitHub Actions cache poisoning is by deploying <a href="https://github.com/AdnaneKhan/Cacheract" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cacheract</a>, malware that persists in a build pipeline through cache poisoning.</p>



<p>If an attacker deployed Cacheract in the CodeQL workflow, it would:</p>



<ol>
<li>Predict cache entries</li>



<li>Overwrite these entries with a malicious action</li>



<li>Gain code execution within any workflow that uses <code>action-cache</code> (the Actions Cache is used by most repositories)</li>



<li><strong>Leverage code execution to compromise GitHub Actions secrets used by those workflows, capture privileged GITHUB_TOKENs, and more</strong></li>
</ol>



<p>Even if someone noticed the malicious CodeQL action and remediated the vulnerability, Cacheract would continue poisoning caches.</p>



<p>I spent ten minutes looking for prominent repos that use CodeQL &amp; actions/cache and identified<br><a href="https://github.com/Homebrew/brew" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Homebrew</a>, <a href="https://github.com/angular/angular" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Angular</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/grafana/grafana" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Grafana</a>.</p>



<p>Cache poisoning would allow an attacker to leverage this CodeQL supply chain attack to gain write access to repositories and repository secrets.</p>



<h2>Congratulations, You Made It</h2>



<p>We’ve now hit all the impact highlights I mentioned at the beginning:</p>



<ol>
<li>Compromise intellectual property by exfiltrating the source code of all private repositories using CodeQL.</li>



<li>Steal credentials within GitHub Actions secrets of any workflow job using CodeQL, and leverage those secrets to execute further supply chain attacks.</li>



<li>Execute code on internal infrastructure running CodeQL workflows.</li>



<li>Compromise GitHub Actions secrets of any workflow using the GitHub Actions Cache within a repo that uses CodeQL.</li>
</ol>

<p>Supply chain attacks like these are scary, especially when they start with something as simple as a publicly exposed credential. If this is your first time hearing about abusing GitHub Actions to launch supply chain attacks, I’ll let you in on a secret: <a href="https://www.praetorian.com/blog/tensorflow-supply-chain-compromise-via-self-hosted-runner-attack/">these vulnerabilities</a> <a href="https://www.praetorian.com/blog/compromising-bytedances-rspack-github-actions-vulnerabilities/">occur</a> <a href="https://johnstawinski.com/2024/01/05/worse-than-solarwinds-three-steps-to-hack-blockchains-github-and-ml-through-github-actions/">all </a><a href="https://johnstawinski.com/2024/01/05/worse-than-solarwinds-three-steps-to-hack-blockchains-github-and-ml-through-github-actions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the</a><a href="https://johnstawinski.com/2024/01/05/worse-than-solarwinds-three-steps-to-hack-blockchains-github-and-ml-through-github-actions/"> time</a>.</p>



<p>GitHub Actions abuse has been around for several years, but it is still one of the highest-impact, least-understood vulnerability classes. That is slowly starting to change (emphasis on ~slowly~). The DevOps and security communities need to commit to learning about these vulnerabilities to protect their organizations from risk. Vulnerabilities like this, and the recent tj-actions/changed-files supply chain attack, are starting to bring these issues to the public spotlight. That is why we invest in research to uncover these vulnerabilities and design solutions to prevent them.</p>



<h2>CVE-2025-24362</h2>



<p>A side-effect of this disclosure was <a href="https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-vqf5-2xx6-9wfm">CVE-2025-24362</a>. The publicly exposed <em>GITHUB_TOKEN</em> was within a debug artifact uploaded by the CodeQL Action after a failed code scanning workflow. The CodeQL Actions repository was intentionally triggering this failure, but other users of CodeQL Actions could have exposed their own secrets as environment variables to the workflow, had their workflows experienced a similar failure.</p>



<p><strong>This issue was fixed in CodeQL Action version 3.28.3.</strong></p>



<p>Even though this disclosure resulted in a CVE, the highest potential impact still lies in exploiting that vulnerability against the CodeQL Actions repository and launching a supply chain attack against CodeQL users.</p>



<h2>Remediation</h2>



<p>GitHub had one of the most rapid and impressive remediation responses we have ever seen.</p>



<p>Jan 22, 2025, 3:13 PM UTC: Report Submitted to GitHub<br>Jan 22, 2025, 5:48 PM UTC: GitHub acknowledged receipt of the submission<br>Jan 22, 2025, 6:28 PM UTC: GitHub confirmed the vulnerability, temporarily disabled the “PR Check – Debug artifacts after failure” workflow, and submitted <a href="https://github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2712">this PR</a> to disable debug artifacts upload. This occurred just three hours after submitting the report, which is a very rapid resolution time.<br>Jan 24, 2025: GitHub assigned <a href="https://hackerone.com/hacktivity/cve_discovery?id=CVE-2025-24362" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CVE-2025-24362</a> and published this <a href="https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-vqf5-2xx6-9wfm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">security advisory</a>, which notes they found no evidence of compromise to its platform or systems.</p>



<p>If you are concerned about you’re own GitHub Actions workflow artifacts, you can take the following steps to limit the risk of secrets exposure:</p>



<ul>
<li>ideally, only upload specific files or directories as workflow artifacts</li>



<li>avoid uploading artifacts containing environment variables, the <code>.git/config</code> file, or any files in the runner’s <code>&lt;path_to_runner_dir&gt;/_work/_temp/</code> directory</li>



<li>limit GITHUB_TOKEN permissions to read-only</li>



<li>scan artifacts for secrets prior to uploading</li>
</ul>

<p>One of the questions I get constantly, both in-person and online, is how we went about arranging our household once we became parents. We put so much thought into it, and it’s clearly of interest to folks, that I thought I’d take a moment over my morning coffee and write a brief high-level overview of how we approached this if only for a quick reference guide in the hope it is helpful to someone. It’s also partly my way of paying it forward since both Aaron and I were, and remain, so grateful for the other parents who shared suggestions, ideas, and recommendations about the journey we were about to undertake. It truly is the case that you cannot comprehend the path until you’ve walked it yourself. Kids change <em>everything</em>. Having the boys truly has been both the best, and most difficult, things we’ve ever done because our lives are suddenly not about us anymore. We live for something beyond our own needs and desires, subjugating to a meaningful degree ourselves for the greater good of the family. That change in perspective shifts how one views allocations of time and capital.</p>



<p>To that end: Broadly speaking, Aaron and I have always been big fans of designing <em>systems</em> or <em>frameworks</em> and then setting up our lives and businesses to let those systems or frameworks do the heavy lifting. Those of you who know me realize how true this is. For example, I control my attention span with a certain level of ruthless efficiency because, as an elder millennial, I abhor Silicon Valley’s arrogance thinking it has the right to demand my time. For example:</p>



<ul>
<li>I do not allow cell phones or social media or email to have any first, second, or even tertiary, claim on my attention span. They exist for me to utilize, or not utilize, as a tool. I will often have my phone in an adjacent room and only check messages once or twice a day. I have nearly all notifications turned off on all devices. </li>



<li>I have something like 70 or 80 specialized email addresses and aliases set up to manage personal household functions all going into a centralized system so I can focus on whatever I’m working on all at once, not be distracted.  Some email addresses are checked daily, some quarterly, some a few times a year.</li>



<li>I utilize physical books, print-outs, and/or e-ink readers with no advertisements or other selling features to allow me to focus on whatever text I am studying.  </li>



<li>I do not permit the use of sites like TikTok, partly because as an expert, it is excruciatingly painful to listen to so much misinformation, and partly because I think it is self-defeating to have any sort of short-form content on demand given that it distracts from bigger goals and deeper satisfaction in life.  I think the parallels to nicotine are meaningful.  Several years ago, when the communication services stocks got cheap and we loaded up on them, I acknowledged this was a battle I was going to lose and the only rational thing was to take advantage of the situation since few people cared to listen to me about it.  </li>
</ul>



<p>Stated another way, I very purposefully built a machine, of sorts, so that I am free to be left alone to think or focus on the people in front of me.  I do not believe in centralized devices.  Lately, this has me testing running Linux distributions in Docker containers within virtual machines because I want to be able to get around the increasing insistence that everything be interconnected to everything and everyone else.  I want to be able to turn on a machine, do specialized work on it, and then turn it off.  Nothing may come of this experiment, but it has been a lot of fun to learn the technical side.</p>



<p>Anyway, when we decided to become parents years ago, and went through the time, expense, and emotional process of <a href="https://www.joshuakennon.com/gestational-surrogacy-for-beginners/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">gestational surrogacy</a>, this was no different. We reflected a lot on how we could give our kids the best possible advantages in life; to help them so that as they grew up, and entered adulthood, they were equipped with the tools to not just enjoy life and succeed, but to thrive.  Over the course of a few years, we identified that our goals were to:</p>



<ul>
<li>Make them feel emotionally secure;</li>



<li>Allow them to take risks in a safe environment;</li>



<li>Help them develop autonomy and a sense of self-direction so they could follow their passions and curiosity;</li>



<li>Develop emotional regulation;</li>



<li>Develop strong wills including the ability to delay gratification; and</li>



<li>Protect their attention span so they did not require constant distraction to be happy or content.</li>
</ul>



<h3>Play Time Is Unrestricted But It Occurs in a Carefully Curated World</h3>



<p>We started with the concept of how the kids would play.  The general guideline we used was, “If there were no electricity coming into the house, and no internet, this should still provide hours of entertainment by using your imagination playing in a physical real-world space”.  We created the space, their playroom, and made sure it was stocked with:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Books </strong>– The library is built out and contains hundreds of books. Storybooks. Comic books. Science encyclopedias on different topics such as the universe or North American birds.</li>



<li><strong>Boardgames </strong>– Physical, old-school boardgames, puzzles, and card games. Chutes &amp; Ladders. Candy Land. Hi-Ho Cherry-O. Slapburger.</li>



<li><strong>Musical Instruments</strong> – Besides the two acoustic pianos, we bought them Yamaha recorders, a Chinese tongue drum, a tambourine, etc.</li>



<li><strong>Physical Play Sets</strong> – Wooden replica kid-sized kitchen with cookware, pretend ice cream shops, sandwich shops, etc.</li>



<li><strong>Engineering Toys </strong>– Wooden train tracks, magnetic engineering tiles, Lincoln Logs, building blocks, Hot Wheels, construction equipment replicas from dump trucks to cranes.</li>



<li><strong>Figurines and Plush Toys </strong>– Play sets from movies such as <em>Encanto</em> or <em>Frozen</em>, a ton of Jellycat plush friends, etc.</li>



<li><strong>Costumes </strong>– This includes not only costumes but the accessories such as wigs and props.</li>



<li><strong>Art Sets</strong> – Play-doh sets, watercolors, coloring books, sticker books, etc.</li>



<li><strong>Physical Activity</strong> – Bicycles, tricycles, sidewalk chalk, and other things that can be used outside.</li>
</ul>



<p>Play is generally unrestricted so they can entertain themselves by creating new games or stories. (Don’t get me wrong, we do things like enroll them in swimming lessons, but everything I’ve ever seen shows the importance of free, creative time in childhood development so kids learn how to function and self-regulate rather than rely on authority figures to fill their day on a pre-determined path.) It’s been wild to see how they use that freedom. I’m sure I’m misremembering some of the details given how many variations there are but they’ve built jails out of their engineering tiles, and the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles have locked away bad guys that were arrested by Elsa from <em>Frozen</em> using her ice powers only to have said bad guys escape and destroy a passing train. There was one period where nearly everything was a magic wand and we kept hearing yells of “Fireball!” throughout the house as they pretended to have battle royales.</p>



<p>While play itself is unstructured, the house is not.  This not only helped keep us sane, it also reinforced the magic of the playroom.  For example, when we setup the playroom for them, we made them a deal: We would build them a childhood paradise but toys <em>must</em> remain in the playroom. They are never left out around the house or strewn across the stairs. If they are, they lose them. They get their space, but I get mine for things to be clean and organized. The playroom itself, in contrast, has only a couple of rules:</p>



<ul>
<li>If the playroom gets too messy to the point it is a tripping hazard, everything stops and they have to clean it up (which really only occurs a few times a week since they are pretty good about managing the space).  </li>



<li>They cannot destroy or harm their books, they must show them respect, </li>



<li>They cannot mark on the walls or furniture, </li>



<li>They cannot run in the house or jump off of furniture or towers they build, </li>



<li>They cannot hit each other, and </li>



<li>They cannot speak harshly to one another, which includes requiring them to say, “Thank you,” “Please”, etc.  Throughout your life, your family should be the one rock you depend upon and that you know will always have your back if times get tough.  We support each other, we don’t fight or say things in frustration.</li>



<li>They cannot talk about gross topics at the dinner table.  They have to wait until they are finished eating and allowed to get up, then it’s fair game, again.  That way, they are being considerate of other people.</li>
</ul>



<p>We also adopted a rule from my own parents and childhood: Nearly anything can be forgiven in the house and we don’t get upset about perfectly normal things – e.g., accidents happen, plates break, water gets spilled, shirts get paint on them – except for lying. Both kids learned early on if they lied to us, it was immediate game over for the day. No exceptions. No reprieves for good behavior. No negotiating a different settlement. It was a line that was not crossed because we need to be able to trust their words when they tell us something; to know that if they come to us we will always trust them and be on their side when the cards are down. In exchange, we explained that we hold ourselves to the same standard. We do not lie to them, even in a teasing manner most folks would consider completely innocent. They know that if we tell them something, they can rely on it and they absolutely hold us to it if we make a commitment. If it is a topic they are not old enough to understand, yet, we will tell them, “We think you are too young to know this, we will explain it when you are older.”</p>



<p>Again, by setting this up early, there is almost no required upkeep or stress involved with it. It just <em>works</em>. We set the boundaries at the beginning and stuck to them with no exceptions on these fundamental guidelines so there was tremendous freedom within that framework. They know they have a good thing and abide by the handful of rules since they don’t want to lose it.  </p>



<p>It’s important to note, too, that we also include them in nearly everything. Baking or cooking dinner? They can watch and be involved. Hiring a commercial plumber for the new office? They can listen to the phone call as we negotiate with a vendor and we will stop and explain what we are doing at every step including the <em>“why”</em>. Picking paint colors? They can go to the store with us and we explain the different types of finishes. (More on that in a moment.). Looking at estate sales for furniture? They can be involved and, in some cases, has led to us watching woodworking videos together as we explain how furniture is made and the different styles that exist.</p>



<p>On that topic – video content – we will allow maybe 20 minutes or so of a movie or television show in the morning while they wake up and just want to set but it has to be:</p>



<ul>
<li>A narrative story </li>



<li>In long-form content format </li>



<li>with episodes at least 15 minutes and </li>



<li>no advertisements.</li>
</ul>



<p>This requires an attention span and the ability to follow plot. (Another way we reinforce this is that Aaron or I will read longer stories to them. Right now, I’m going through the original <em>Wizard of Oz</em> and reading it aloud a couple chapters at a time so they can remind me what happened where we left of, reiterating the plot-thus-far to me.) Alternatively, sometimes we will watch the morning news together and I will explain what is happening, though I curate it so the violent stories are not shown at this stage of development. We will selectively use YouTube (with a premium membership so little to no advertisements interrupting the content) to show examples of things we teach them about a la Mr. Rogers style as a mentioned a moment ago. For example, if we talk to them about how crayons are made we will show them a video of the inside of a crayon factory. Otherwise, the only television we watch is a couple of times a week as a family we will pick a movie and watch it together. For example, this week it was Disney’s <em>Wish</em> and the <em>Super Mario Bros.</em> movie.</p>



<p>This was how <a href="https://www.joshuakennon.com/beating-the-original-legend-of-zelda-with-the-kids-apple-now-allows-you-to-merge-your-old-itunes-accounts-the-berkshire-hathaway-shareholder-letter-was-released-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">we ended up playing <em>The Legend of Zelda</em> from the original NES over the past month, finally beating Ganon on Friday night</a>.</p>



<p>It’s been a huge success.  Video game time immediately became the biggest, best reward and despite their entreaties for more play time, by restricting it to blocks of pre-approved time throughout the week, it is also helping us teach them delayed gratification. Over the course of a few weeks, we’ve watched them go from being hyper-active trying to run and jump over everything to patiently waiting for a Goomba or Koopa Troopa to pass rather than going all Leeroy Jenkins on it. Again, the choice was very deliberate. These two old-school games (Mario and Zelda) have two buttons – “A” and “B” – with no advertisements, long-form entertainment, and require patience and planning.</p>



<p>The only exception we allow here, from time to time, is that I will sometimes permit them to sit with me as I play a few minutes of <em>Genshin Impact</em>. They will tell me which characters they want on my team and I’ll allow them to run around the open world looking for treasure chests.</p>



<p>One thing they do not have, and neither Aaron nor I will allow them to use, is a tablet of any kind. There is no scenario in which they get their own iPad or other “smart” mobile device. Heck, if I have to go find an old-school Gameboy so they can play it when we travel, I will. I’ll let them build a custom gaming PC from scratch in elementary school before we let them consume the sort of dopamine-addicting short-form content on advertising riddled platforms designed to manipulate them I mentioned earlier. They’ll learn how the components work; how to install drivers or run databases. I help them set their own webhosting server or teach them how to play Civilization. If we can get the neurological development down first, then they should be immune for life. That way, as they enter adulthood, they have been inoculated against the insidiousness of the digital marketing world.</p>



<h3>The Rules are Different for Grandparents and Great Grandma</h3>



<p>Aaron in particular felt it was important for kids to know that different people have different expectations and that your relationship with others is unique.  As a result, the rules are entirely different for grandparents.  While we still don’t drink any sugar-drinks such as fruit juice – there are certain lines that won’t be crossed – they get to watch more cartoons or eat more cake and ice cream than would otherwise be allowed at home when they are visiting grandma and grandpa.    They also do cool projects, like build actual real birdhouses with hammer, nails, and wood in grandpa’s workshop then paint them.  Grandma basically runs a little pre-school where she teaches them cursive and phonics, which they love.  </p>



<h3>The Point Is, Life Should Be Lived in the Real World</h3>



<p>We take the kids to the fall festival and make s’mores and eat popcorn while jumping in bouncy houses.  We let them pick new restaurants to try.  We let them go with us when we toured real estate during our recent acquisition spree so they could ask questions about what we were doing.  We let them go to the events with the municipality so they can get in police cars, climb onto fire trucks, and see excavators in person.  The goal is for them to be present in the world, not just watch it from a screen.  </p>



<p>We knew that getting it right early would make things vastly easier later, and now that is paying dividends.  Both kids will turn four later this year.  They have none of the behavioral issues we see in some of the other boys and girls their age.  (To be fair, I think a big part of that is we spent a lot of time reinforcing it is okay to <em>feel</em> big feelings, but you have to communicate to us what they are and it doesn’t give you an excuse to be rude or break the rules.  For example, you can feel frustrated, and you can tell us you are frustrated, but it doesn’t mean you can hit your brother or stomp off and refuse to talk.  Acknowledge what you feel but you do not have to let those feelings control you.)  </p>



<h3>This Philosophy Is Even Influencing Our Design Decisions at Home</h3>



<p>As I explained in past posts about our relocation out of California, this belief is the reason we are engaging in a 3-year design project on our properties in Ohio. The goal is to transition the house from largely gray and gray-adjacent colors to a home that could have existed in 1850, 1950, or 2050 and, absent any electrical items or central air conditioning which are visible, you would otherwise have no idea. I’ve shared some pictures of that process thus far, but we continue to knock things off the checklist. It’s been a cathartic escape in the few hours of personal time I get each week given the political, and therefore economic, chaos coming out of Washington, D.C. for the past sixty or so days.</p>



<p>Anyway, the first step was to remove all of the gray and near-gray walls. We ultimately decided on The Benjamin Moore Historical Collection line, which was released in 1976 to celebrate the United States bicentennial. It was made up of 191 colors originating with America’s historical landmarks. It coincided with a movement in the mid-twentieth century to preserve and protect historical home and architectural landmarks with the paint giant working with historians and conservation groups to analyze paint chips and archival documents to reproduce, as closely as possible, the shades that existed in these traditional structures. The pigments tend to be softer. In doing so we wanted our kids to remember actual rooms. With color. The sort of 1990s-era opulence that was so visible at that time, particularly in television and movies.</p>

It has an LRV score of 51.72. The warm cashmere-like neutral will be used to cause darker woods to stand out against it, especially when trimmed in clean white molding. One thing I might want to do is get the French-style solid walnut doors like you see in Parisian apartments and put them between several of the rooms to increase the distinction of spaces as I’m not a big fan of open concepts. (Rooms should be quiet, allow you to focus on whatever you are doing, and maintaining doors also allows you to commit to a theme because not everything has to match every other room in the house.) The big decision will be on an enormous area rug and custom drapes as this will allow us to set the color of the room to almost anything we want. The armoire next to the fireplace is stuffed with board games and warm blankets.</figcaption></figure>

We are also tracking down a wide range of unique and beautiful lamps. The eventual goal, by the time we are done, is that if someone had a book, they should be able to throw themselves into a comfortable chair almost anywhere and within close distance will be a reading lamp and something on which to sit a cup of coffee.</figcaption></figure>

It has an LRV of 9.82. It will end up being a mix of certain Ralph Lauren restaurants and Bridgerton. This is one of those colors that is so deep, and so nuanced in real life, but doesn’t photograph anything like how it ultimately looks. There is a berry undertone to it in person.</figcaption></figure>



<p>The other rooms are on-going. We run tests where we have different colors put up so we can observe them throughout the day and under different weather conditions (overcast snowy days change a room compared to a bright sunny day).  We let thet kids vote on color rankings and take their input seriously.</p>

<p>The office is a whole other project.  There, we finally got the sign up and I am doing a test paint of the lobby and two offices – here we chose Benjamin Moore’s Elmira White HC-84, with an LRV of 64.67, trimmed in Benjamin Moore’s Ivory, with an accent color of Benjamin Moore Tarrytown Green HC-134 with an LRV of 9.71.  The latter was inspired by the area around John D. Rockefeller’s Kykuit estate in New York and has a really beautiful blue pine undertone to it.</p>

<p>Again, I am so, so grateful for this project right now. We’ve done really well in 2025 at Kennon-Green &amp; Co., especially because of some positions we bought back during the tail end of the first time the present administration was in power that have had a spectacular twelve-month run and largely avoided the concentration in a handful of companies trading at stratospheric valuation multiples, but there are some rebalancing operations I’m working on as I study each and every account at the firm. After long days, and sometimes nights, evaluating every new trade declaration on everything from automobiles to timber for home construction, even ten minutes to step away and look at paint or carpet samples is like a mental reset.  </p>



<p>I believe we are on the right track because the other day, I sat down at the table in the kitchen and for a brief moment, it felt like 1990s in a good way.</p>

          <p>A prominent computer scientist who has spent 20 years publishing academic papers on cryptography, privacy, and cybersecurity has gone incommunicado, had his professor profile, email account, and phone number removed by his employer Indiana University, and had his homes raided by the FBI. No one knows why.</p>
<p>Xiaofeng Wang has a long list of prestigious titles. He was the associate dean for research at Indiana University's <a href="https://luddy.indiana.edu/">Luddy School of Informatics, Computing and Engineering</a>, a fellow at the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers and the American Association for the Advancement of Science, and a tenured professor at Indiana University at Bloomington. According to his employer, he has served as principal investigator on research projects totaling nearly $23 million over his 21 years there.</p>
<p>He has also co-authored scores of academic papers on a diverse range of research fields, including cryptography, systems security, and data privacy, including the protection of human genomic data. I have personally spoken to him on three occasions for articles <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2015/06/serious-ios-bug-makes-it-easy-to-steal-users-icloud-passwords/">here</a>, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2013/08/ios-and-android-weaknesses-allow-stealthy-pilfering-of-website-credentials/">here</a>, and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2012/03/flawed-sign-in-services-from-google-and-facebook-imperil-user-acconts/">here</a>.</p>
<h2>"None of this is in any way normal"</h2>
<p>In recent weeks, Wang's email account, phone number, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20241205182256/https://cs.indiana.edu/contact/profile/?XiaoFeng_Wang">profile page</a> at the Luddy School were quietly erased by his employer. Over the same time, Indiana University also removed a profile for his wife, <a href="https://libraries.indiana.edu/nianli-ma">Nianli Ma</a>, who was listed as a Lead Systems Analyst and Programmer at the university's Library Technologies division.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.heraldtimesonline.com/story/news/local/2025/03/28/fbi-department-of-homeland-security-agents-search-house-in-bloomington-indiana/82710451007/">According to</a> the Herald-Times in Bloomington, a small fleet of unmarked cars driven by government agents descended on the Bloomington home of Wang and Ma on Friday. They spent most of the day going in and out of the house and occasionally transferred boxes from their vehicles. TV station WTHR, meanwhile, <a href="https://www.wthr.com/article/news/local/fbi-searches-home-in-carmel-indiana-seizes-boxes-of-evidence/531-969e30e2-e599-4c08-b72c-3ba6227cdb89">reported</a> that a second home owned by Wang and Ma and located in Carmel, Indiana, was also searched. The station said that both a resident and an attorney for the resident were on scene during at least part of the search.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page">

<pre><code>Created at: 2024-08-26
</code></pre>
<p>I've been writing about <strong>things</strong> on a personal website since
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20171124021420/http://marcelonet.com/snippets/">2017</a>.</p>
<p>Most of what I have written features in the category of notes-to-self. Mostly
on how to do A or B.</p>
<p>Only recently I've started polishing notes together and forming posts on
specific topics.</p>
<p>One thing I realised was preventing me of writing more frequently wasn't
the lack of ideas (or motivation), but the trouble of having to deal with
the website builder and platform I was using at the time.</p>
<p>GitHub pages didn't exist at the time and the canonical way was to have an
Apache server running the website in some web provider. I didn't know anything
about Apache and the little I saw didn't interest me, so I looked for an
alternative.</p>
<p>I built my first website with Django (serviced by Nginx) in a server hosted on
Digital Ocean. This is before the Droplets-era, so I had to rent an Ubuntu
machine which costed $5.00 USD per month. That was a bit steep for a dev on a
Brazilian salary considering I had to pay for other services too (registrar,
email, etc).</p>
<p>I was highly motivated to post things as I was still fresh in the web
development world and wanted to know how everything worked. I also had no idea
what I was doing and wanted my own website to be a sandbox where I could try
new things out.</p>
<p>That was my first mistake. Building a "static" website with Django is too
cumbersome. You have to set up views, templates, run the server, get GitHub
hooks for resetting the remote server in Digital Ocean when new commits are
pushed, etc.</p>
<p>Once the romantic view of a newbie blog-poster faded away, handling the whole
apparatus to publish a note took more time than writing the note itself.</p>
<p>At some point I had to make a switch before the website grew too big.</p>
<p>My second take was to ditch the whole website and start from scratch using
a static website generator. I decided to use Nuxt because I was using Vue at
work and the whole set up looked simple to start with.</p>
<p>It was nice in the beginning. I set it up with GitHub Pages. I only had to
get the static site that Nuxt creates via a cli command pushed to my git repo
and GitHub handled the rest for me. That was a major improvement over the
previous infrastructure. On top of that, I could do cool dynamic things with
JavaScript being embedded and having the framework to interact with it.</p>
<p>But I only had one blog post where I needed fancy JavaScript tooling. Soon it
became painful to maintain the website again. Publishing posts involved writing
things in Vue and that was just not an ergonomic way to write regular prose.</p>
<p>Also the framework was a new technology, and maintainers were pushing updates
that broke backwards compatibility. Handling versioning of Vue and Nuxt along
with all their JavaScript dependencies was a big pain point and I had to give
up at some point.</p>
<h2>Now</h2>
<p>Learning from these two past mistakes, I came up with a set of requirements for
my next (and hopefully final) website:</p>
<ol>
<li>Starting a post must be as easy as typing into a blank file.</li>
<li>The website must be statically generated. And Fast.</li>
<li>There should be little to none dependencies for generating the website.</li>
<li>It needs to last for at least the next 10 years.</li>
</ol>
<p>The first requirement is satisfied by writing using markdown files. Writing
this blog post in Neovim looks like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://marcelofern.com/posts/c/why-is-this-site-built-with-c/markdown.png" alt="markdown"></p>
<p>The second requirement is a bit trickier, but it is directly related to the
third.</p>
<p>Writing posts in markdown means that there needs to be a parser to convert the
files to html. I could either code this parser myself and have a beautiful
static site generator with zero dependencies, or I can allow myself a single
dependency.</p>
<p>The problem is that the move from zero dependencies to one dependency is huge.
It feels way bigger than going from 10 dependencies to 100 dependencies.</p>
<p>The problem is that writing a markdown parser isn't the most trivial
enterprise. At the same time, the parser was the only dependency I needed to
have. I managed to convince myself that a dependency was okay and then I moved
on.</p>
<p>My first instinct was to reach out to <a href="https://pandoc.org/">Pandoc</a>. I did so
and implemented a small shell script that could read my directory tree of
markdown files and transpose them to html.</p>
<p>That worked fine for about 20 to 30 markdown files. After that, the process of
converting files to html started to deteriorate in speed. Pandoc is written in
Haskell, and it is not known for being fast at parsing large volumes of files.</p>
<p>An alternative for saving time with recompilation was to update my script so
that only new markdown files or changed ones are marked for recompilation. That
would involve too much wizardry if I wanted to make the script nice and robust.
I didn't want to do that. I didn't want my script to grow so much that I would
need to start adding test cases and coverage.</p>
<p>I also knew that parsing hundreds or even thousands of small files should be
doable in single-digit seconds. The problem was that Pandoc slowed everything
down, so my second requirement was not met.</p>
<p>More over, the whole Pandoc ecosystem requires <strong>a lot of</strong> of dependencies.
227 dependencies and over 400MB of installed size to be exact:</p>

<p>There are too many dependencies for me to trust the environment will be stable
for a long time. The last thing I want to do is deal with backward incompatible
changes on my wee blog.</p>
<p>I looked for a better alternative and found
<a href="http://github.com/mity/md4c">md4c</a>, which is a parser written in C with no
dependencies other than the standard C library. It also has only one header
file and one source file, making it easy to embed it straight into any C
project.</p>
<p>The only work I needed to do was to write a C script (which turned out to be
~250 LOC) to call md4c functions and parse my <code>md</code> files, and then chuck those
converted files into the GitHub Pages repo.</p>
<p>My website converter script, which is all in this <a href="https://gist.github.com/marcelofern/896574e055a05d011449b00217600fe6">250
LOC</a>
source file (less md4c) is feature-complete and runs on any compiler that
supports the C standard from 1999 onwards. There's no platform-dependent code
and it's portable to Windows, Linux, and MacOS.</p>
<p>It runs incredibly well. I have 87 markdown files at the moment and parsing all
those files at the same time from scratch can be done virtually
instantaneously:</p>
<pre><code>[~] time ./scripts/website/converter.bin

real    0m0.115s
user    0m0.087s
sys     0m0.091s
</code></pre>
<p>This allows me to completely flush the whole repo away and create it from
scratch in almost no time. I do not have to worry about creating specific
logic to just re-parse files that have changed or anything fancy like that,
which reduces the burden of maintenance and makes my script smaller and easier
to reason about.</p>
<p>This result was way more reasonable than the amount of time Pandoc took to
parse a mere amount of 87 markdown files, which was over the double-digit
mark (of seconds).</p>
<h2>Outro</h2>
<p>One popular alternative of current days for this problem is
<a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a>. There is nothing inherently bad with Hugo. It is
decently fast (written in Go) and it is easy to get going for a simple website.
It seems better than some alternatives like
<a href="https://github.com/getpelican/pelican">pelican</a> which is written in Python and
thus will be slower to parse md files.</p>
<p>However, Hugo doesn't particularly appeal to me because the framework seems
too big and opinionated for what I need:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hugo takes data files, i18n bundles, configuration, templates for layouts,
static files, assets, and content written in Markdown, HTML, AsciiDoctor, or
Org-mode and renders a static website. Some notable features are multilingual
support, image processing, asset management, custom output formats, markdown
render hooks and shortcodes. Nested sections allow for different types of
content to be separated, e.g. for a website containing a blog and a podcast.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20240808001552/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugo_(software)">source</a></p>
<p>There's a lot in there, so much so that big websites that need a lot of
features (e.g. Smashing Magazine) are capable of relying heavily on Hugo.</p>
<p>Also as much as Hugo looks satisfiable today, I'm not expecting that it won't
keep growing and changing in ways that would make me have to keep up with it
every now and then.</p>
<p>I just need a parser that performs a one-off job of parsing the given markdown
file. There is no benefit of bringing a GC-based language into this type of
problem.</p>
<p>I also wanted my website to use tech that I know will continue to work in the
upcoming decades (my last requirement). There is virtually nothing that beats C
compilers in that area as of today. For any new platform out there the first
thing that needs to happen is getting a C compiler built along with the
standard library (which is probably the only standard lib of popular
programming languages that fits in a <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=C+standard+library+P.J+Plauger">commented book of 500
pages</a>...).
Otherwise, nothing can run in the platform. So I'm hoping this bet will
pay off.</p>

<p dir="auto">If you are currently using an atomic desktop, you can rebase to the latest blue95 image.</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>First rebase to the unsigned image, to get the proper signing keys and policies installed:
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="rpm-ostree rebase ostree-unverified-registry:ghcr.io/winblues/blue95:latest"><pre><code>rpm-ostree rebase ostree-unverified-registry:ghcr.io/winblues/blue95:latest
</code></pre></div>
</li>
<li>Reboot and then rebase to the signed image, like so:
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="rpm-ostree rebase ostree-image-signed:docker://ghcr.io/winblues/blue95:latest"><pre><code>rpm-ostree rebase ostree-image-signed:docker://ghcr.io/winblues/blue95:latest
</code></pre></div>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">It is recommended to create a new user after rebasing.</p>

      <h2 id="whats-faster-than-memcmp">2025-03-30 What's faster than Memcmp?</h2>
<p>In this post I look at improvements in .NET and using Span<t> for performance and portability.</t></p>
<p>I was examining portability issues in a code base that I wanted to migrate from .NET framework 4.8.1 to .NET8. I discovered use of <code>msvcrt.dll</code>. I quickly established it is a <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/1445405/1635976">popular stackoverflow answer</a> for a fast way to compare byte arrays in .NET</p>
<p>The answer as provided, and faithfully copied into codebases, is this:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>[</span><span>DllImport</span><span>(</span><span>"msvcrt.dll"</span><span>,</span> <span>CallingConvention</span><span>=</span><span>CallingConvention</span><span>.</span><span>Cdecl</span><span>)]</span>
<span>static</span> <span>extern</span> <span>int</span> <span>memcmp</span><span>(</span><span>byte</span><span>[]</span> <span>b1</span><span>,</span> <span>byte</span><span>[]</span> <span>b2</span><span>,</span> <span>long</span> <span>count</span><span>);</span>

<span>static</span> <span>bool</span> <span>ByteArrayCompare</span><span>(</span><span>byte</span><span>[]</span> <span>b1</span><span>,</span> <span>byte</span><span>[]</span> <span>b2</span><span>)</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>// Validate buffers are the same length.</span>
    <span>// This also ensures that the count does not exceed the length of either buffer.  </span>
    <span>return</span> <span>b1</span><span>.</span><span>Length</span> <span>==</span> <span>b2</span><span>.</span><span>Length</span> <span>&amp;&amp;</span> <span>memcmp</span><span>(</span><span>b1</span><span>,</span> <span>b2</span><span>,</span> <span>b1</span><span>.</span><span>Length</span><span>)</span> <span>==</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>A big performance improvement in modern .NET is the <code>Span&lt;T&gt;</code> type. The documentation describes it as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Provides a type-safe and memory-safe representation of a contiguous region of arbitrary memory.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That's not a super helpful description, but the summary is that it's stack-allocated rather than heap allocated.</p>
<p><code>Span&lt;T&gt;</code> has an extension method <code>SequenceEqual&lt;T&gt;(this ReadOnlySpan&lt;T&gt; span, ReadOnlySpan&lt;T&gt; other)</code>, and we'll see how it fares.</p>
<div><pre><code>    <span>public</span> <span>static</span> <span>bool</span> <span>EqualsSpan</span><span>(</span><span>ReadOnlySpan</span><span>&lt;</span><span>byte</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>b1</span><span>,</span> <span>ReadOnlySpan</span><span>&lt;</span><span>byte</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>b2</span><span>)</span>
    <span>{</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>b1</span><span>.</span><span>SequenceEqual</span><span>(</span><span>b2</span><span>);</span>
    <span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Let's see how it stacks up against a couple of naive implementations, a <code>for</code> loop and using <code>Enumerable.SequenceEquals</code>:</p>
<div><pre><code>    <span>public</span> <span>static</span> <span>bool</span> <span>EqualsLoop</span><span>(</span><span>byte</span><span>[]</span> <span>b1</span><span>,</span> <span>byte</span><span>[]</span> <span>b2</span><span>)</span>
    <span>{</span>

        <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>b1</span><span>.</span><span>Length</span> <span>!=</span> <span>b2</span><span>.</span><span>Length</span><span>)</span> <span>return</span> <span>false</span><span>;</span>
        <span>for</span> <span>(</span><span>int</span> <span>i</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span> <span>i</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>b1</span><span>.</span><span>Length</span><span>;</span> <span>i</span><span>++)</span>
        <span>{</span>
            <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>b1</span><span>[</span><span>i</span><span>]</span> <span>!=</span> <span>b2</span><span>[</span><span>i</span><span>])</span> <span>return</span> <span>false</span><span>;</span>
        <span>}</span>

        <span>return</span> <span>true</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>

    <span>public</span> <span>static</span> <span>bool</span> <span>EqualsSequenceEqual</span><span>(</span><span>byte</span><span>[]</span> <span>b1</span><span>,</span> <span>byte</span><span>[]</span> <span>b2</span><span>)</span>
    <span>{</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>b1</span><span>.</span><span>SequenceEqual</span><span>(</span><span>b2</span><span>);</span>
    <span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>We compare using two identical arrays since this is typically the worst-case for equality checking, and we're going to benchmark on a range of array sizes: 10 bytes, 1KB, 1MB and 1GB.</p>
<div><pre><code>    <span>[</span><span>Params</span><span>(</span><span>10</span><span>,</span> <span>1</span><span>_024</span><span>,</span> <span>1</span><span>_048_576</span><span>,</span> <span>1073741824</span><span>)]</span>
    <span>public</span> <span>int</span> <span>Length</span> <span>{</span> <span>get</span><span>;</span> <span>set</span><span>;</span> <span>}</span>

    <span>byte</span><span>[]</span> <span>first</span><span>;</span>
    <span>byte</span><span>[]</span> <span>second</span><span>;</span>

    <span>[</span><span>GlobalSetup</span><span>]</span>
    <span>public</span> <span>void</span> <span>Setup</span><span>()</span>
    <span>{</span>
        <span>var</span> <span>r</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>Random</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>);</span>

        <span>first</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>byte</span><span>[</span><span>Length</span><span>];</span>
        <span>second</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>byte</span><span>[</span><span>Length</span><span>];</span>

        <span>r</span><span>.</span><span>NextBytes</span><span>(</span><span>first</span><span>);</span>
        <span>Array</span><span>.</span><span>Copy</span><span>(</span><span>first</span><span>,</span> <span>second</span><span>,</span> <span>Length</span><span>);</span>
    <span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>The setup is straightforward, we fill the first array with random data, and copy the data to the second array.</p>

<p>The first notable result is that for very small arrays, the overhead of calling <code>memcmp</code>  is a waste compared to a naive loop. In .NET Framework, the loop is overall fastest for 10 element arrays. This is not unexpected, but it's important to note; don't try to optimise if you actually have small arrays. The loop does not scale well at all however, and that advantage has completely disappeared by just 1000 elements.</p>
<p>The more biggest difference is between .NET framework and .NET 8. Even the loop is notably faster in .NET 8. There is a bizarre performance regression from .NET 8 to .NET 9 for 1GB arrays, which I will investigate separately to try to confirm that result, it may have been a glitch in the benchmark, given twice the memory allocations and twice the time taken.</p>
<p>When we look at <code>IEnumerable&lt;T&gt;.SequenceEqual</code>, it is <strong>500 times faster for our 1MB array in .NET 8 than in .NET framework</strong>. In .NET8 and .NET9, <code>IEnumerable&lt;T&gt;.SequenceEqual</code> is faster than the version of memcmp I have on my machine.</p>
<p>There wasn't a significant difference between <code>ReadOnlySpan&lt;T&gt;.SequenceEqual</code> and <code>IEnumerable&lt;T&gt;.SequenceEqual</code>, with the difference around the margin of error.</p>
<p><code>memcmp</code> is still a little slower than <code>SequenceEqual</code> across the board. It's still very fast, much faster than naive methods, but it's clearly no longer necessary for achieving high performance for array comparisons. When the original stackoverflow answer was written, there was nothing available in .NET that could come close to that performance, as it was before <code>Span&lt;T&gt;</code> was added to the runtime.</p>
<p>A benefit of the <code>ReadOnlySpan&lt;T&gt;</code> implementation over using <code>IEnumerable&lt;T&gt;.SequenceEqual</code> is that we can also trust that it still perform acceptably when we target .NET Framework.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>If you're using .NET 8 and don't need to run in the .NET Framework runtime, don't write your own utility function and just use <code>IEnumerable&lt;T&gt;.SequenceEqual</code>, it's incredibly fast and doesn't need any external dependencies to just work.</p>
<p>If you're on .NET Framework, then bring in <code>System.Memory</code> and use <code>Span&lt;T&gt;.SequenceEquals</code> instead of relying on external C libraries. Make sure any calls to <code>IEnumerable&lt;T&gt;.SequenceEquals</code> are checked to make sure they aren't operating on large arrays.</p>
<h2 id="other-considerations">Other considerations</h2>
<p>If you regularly need to compare very large arrays and they are append-only and/or are compared more often than constructed, then it may make sense to avoid the comparison entirely by using a data structure that includes and maintains an order-sensitive hash of its contents. Most negative cases can be discounted through a hash comparison before doing the more expensive array comparison. Rebuilding this hash could be expensive for arrays that shuffle or remove items however.</p>
