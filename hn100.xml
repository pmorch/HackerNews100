A few moons ago I was thinking of ways to <a href="http://oldvcr.blogspot.com/2023/09/the-fossil-wrist-pda-becomes-tiny.html">take my Palm OS Fossil Wrist PDA smartwatch mobile</a>. It has no on-board networking libraries but can be coerced into doing PPP over its serial port (via USB) by using the libraries from my Palm m505. Of course, that then requires it be constantly connected to a USB port, which is rather inconvenient for a wristwatch.
</p><p>
But what if the USB connection could be made <em>wirelessly</em>? For a few years, real honest-to-goodness wireless USB devices were actually a thing. Competing standards led to market fracture and the technologies fizzled out relatively quickly in the marketplace, but like the <a href="http://oldvcr.blogspot.com/2021/06/the-parallel-universe-of-firewire-hubs.html">parallel universe of FireWire hubs</a> there was another parallel world of wireless USB devices, at least for a few years. As it happens, we now have a couple of them here, so it's worth exploring what wireless USB was and what happened to it, how the competing standards worked (and how well), and if it would have helped.

You can probably blame Wi-Fi for this: while early patents for Wi-Fi existed as far back as 1991, after the introduction of 802.11 in 1997 and Apple's use of 802.11b <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1MR4R5LdrJw">for the iBook G3 in 1999</a> people really started to believe a completely wireless future was possible — for <em>any</em> device. This was nevertheless another type of network, just one involving only one computer and one user over a short range, which was grandiosely dubbed the "personal area network," or PAN, or WPAN, depending on executive and blood alcohol level. Although initial forms of Bluetooth were the first to arrive in this space, Bluetooth was never intended to handle the very high data rates that some wireless peripherals might require, and even modern high-speed Bluetooth isn't specced beyond 50 megabits/sec (though hold that thought for a later digression). The key basis technology instead was the concept of ultra wide-band, or UWB, which in modern parlance collectively refers to technologies allowing very weak, very wide-spectrum (in excess of 500MHz) signals to become a short range yet high bandwidth communications channel.
</p><p>
Wideband, in this case, is contrasted against the more typical narrowband. In general radio transmission works by modulating a carrier wave of a specified frequency, changing its amplitude (AM), phase, and/or the frequency itself (FM), to encode a signal to be communicated. For terrestrial analogue broadcasting, a good example of narrowband radio, this might be an audio signal carrying some specified frequency range; for FM radio in the United States this audio signal ranges from 30Hz to 15kHz, enough to capture much of the human-audible range, plus various higher frequencies not intended for listening. This collective signal effectively becomes encoded into <i>sidebands</i> on one or both sides of the carrier frequency (even with AM), and per Carson's rule the higher the maximum modulated frequency of the encoded signal then the larger the sidebands (ergo, its <i>bandwidth</i>) must be. As a result, commercial radio stations in particular are often heavily filtered for coexistence to allow many stations to share the band: in the United States, within ITU Region 2, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) divides the FM band from 88.0MHz to 108.0MHz into 100 "channels" of 200kHz each, putting the nominal carrier frequency in the middle of the channel to provide sufficient sideband width for modulation, and strictly regulates any spillover outside those channel boundaries. In practice, most adjacent U.S. FM stations are no closer than 400kHz, a balance between spectrum capacity and signal strength. This typically permits a maximum FM stereo modulated frequency of about 53kHz; frequencies in the aggregate range being transmitted that are unused or unnecessary can be repurposed as <i>subcarriers</i> to emit additional information, such as FM stereo's 19kHz pilot tone subcarrier used to signal receivers, or Microsoft's brief flirtation with one-way transmissions to SPOT smartwatches. Doing so is "free" because the subcarrier frequency is already part of the frequency range.
</p><p>
By contrast, signals like 802.11 Wi-Fi are wideband radio, or at least comparatively wid-<em>er</em> band, because they pass much higher bandwidths. Although 802.11 frequencies (except for the very highest 45/60GHz band) are generally divided into 5MHz channels, people typically only use channels 1, 6 and 11 with 2.4GHz Wi-Fi, for example (or, in later standards, 1, 5, 9 and maybe 13), which spaces them by 20MHz or more. Compare this with medium-wave AM radio, where channel spacing in the United States is just 10kHz and even 9kHz in some countries like Australia, or shortwave radio with only 5kHz spacing.

That brings us to UWB. Ultra wideband has its roots in <i>impulse radar</i>, which is a form of the more familiar pulsed radar (such as the traffic cop at the corner) using much briefer radio pulses. Radar also works on a carrier wave model, but instead of FM or AM, the radar carrier wave is merely pulsed on and off. This is necessary so that the detector during the "off" phase can pick up echoes of the radio pulse transmitted during the "on" phase, and for most applications of radar, the <i>pulse-repetition frequency</i> (PRF) is much less than the frequency of the carrier wave being pulsed. Shorter, more frequent pulses would have theoretically yielded greater precision at close range, but such capability was beyond the electronics available to early radar researchers who were more concerned with long-range detection anyway, where the off phase had to be of sufficient length to detect a distant reflection. By the 1970s, however, the technology had sufficiently advanced that the radar's PRF could approach its carrier frequency, making things like ground-penetrating radar possible. While higher frequencies couldn't travel through ground for great distances, they did yield much better resolution and therefore meaningful data.
</p><p>
To a basic approximation UWB uses the same principle as impulse radar: a series of pulses, potentially as short as picoseconds long, of a particular carrier wave. As the carrier wave itself isn't changing, all of the information is necessarily being encoded in the pulses' timing. Being discontinuous waves, Carson's rule doesn't directly apply to most forms of UWB, but the analogous Shannon capacity limit indicates that rapid modulation from a high PRF would also require significant bandwidth — hence, ultra wide-band. To mitigate UWB transmissions from interfering with narrower-band transmissions on the same frequencies, the pulsed transmissions can be made at very low power, often below the typical noise floor for other transmissions. Naturally this also necessarily limits its range to perhaps a hundred or so metres at most but also makes battery-powered operation highly practical. Its utility in location-finding is because time-of-flight can be measured very quickly and exactly due to the short pulse lengths; when fully active, an Apple AirTag typically transmits a pulse about every other nanosecond.

The FCC first approved UWB for low-power unlicensed use in February 2002 (for comparison, the first commercial Bluetooth device arrived in 1999), though communication systems were only allowed on the upper range from 3.1GHz to 10.6GHz and the FCC also made <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2002/05/16/02-11929/ultra-wideband-transmission-systems">subsequent amendments</a>. A standards group quickly emerged at the IEEE called the IEEE 802.15 Working Group for WPANs, addressing not only UWB but other WPAN-enabling technologies generally. The 802.15 WG had two arms, 802.15.4 for low bandwidth applications which we will not discuss further in this article (Zigbee is probably the most well-known in this category), and 802.15.3 for high bandwidth applications. Subsequently, the WiMedia Alliance was established that summer to capitalize on the new high-bandwidth technology, counting among other early members Eastman Kodak, Motorola, Hewlett-Packard, Intel, Philips, Samsung, Sharp and STMicroelectronics. 802.15.3 had obvious utility in determining precise location, but an extension called 802.15.3a in December 2002 sought to further enhance the standard for high-speed transmission of image and multimedia data. This team started with 23 proposals and whittled them down to two, DS-UWB (alternatively DS-CDMA) and MB-OFDM.
</p><p>
DS-UWB stands for <i>direct sequence ultra wide-band</i>, where the data is simply sent as pulses (as in binary pulse AM) over the entire frequency range in use. However, although the low power of UWB prevents it from interfering with higher-power narrowband signals, an additional layer is needed to prevent UWB transmissions from interfering with each other (i.e., <i>multiple access</i>). DS-UWB uses a system similar to cellular CDMA (code-division multiple access) where each transmitter modulates the data signal with an even higher frequency pseudorandom code known to the receiver, hence its alternative name of DS-CDMA. An interfering transmitter without the same code will have its signals attenuated during the decoding (<i>despreading</i>) process and be ignored. Additionally, by making the transmitted signal require more bandwidth than the original one, the composite signal becomes spread over an even larger frequency range and thus more resistant to narrow-band interference (i.e., <i>direct sequence spread spectrum</i>).
</p><p>
On the other hand, MB-OFDM (<i>multiband orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing</i>) instead employs a massive number of subcarriers to send its data. The basic principle of OFDM, which dates back to Bell Labs in 1966, is to divide up the desired digital signal into multiple bits transmitted in parallel on multiple simultaneous subcarriers. OFDM has many current applications, among others various standards for Wi-Fi and digital TV such as DVB-T and 802.11a/g/n/ac/ah. To avoid interference between the subcarriers yet maximize the channel's capacity, each subcarrier is separated by a minimum frequency distance usually computed as the reciprocal of the useful symbol duration, making each subcarrier <i>orthogonal</i> to the others surrounding it and easily discriminated. MB-OFDM as used here divides the approved range into fourteen 528MHz subbands of 128 subcarriers each, 100 of which are used for data transmission and the remainder for zeroes, guard tones and pilot signals. It solves the multiple access problem by hopping between transmission subfrequencies in a defined pattern (<i>time-frequency coding</i>), meaning each user ideally is on a different one at any given time while also avoiding narrowband intrusion on any one particular frequency. In practice the spec doesn't use all of the subbands simultaneously, bundling them into four <i>bandgroups</i> of three (with a fifth group of two, and a sixth group overlapping two others) and selecting a group as required by local regulation or to compensate for existing sources of interference.

Both technologies are mutually incompatible, and both received substantial and opposing corporate backing largely along the lines of existing patents. The MB-OFDM camp came together as the <a href="https://www.multibandofdm.org/about.html">MultiBand OFDM Alliance</a> in June 2003, founded by Texas Instruments and crucially joined by Intel, while the DS-UWB camp was largely led by Motorola and subsequently Freescale, its inheritor, who had significant investment in CDMA. Although MB-OFDM demanded obviously greater technical complexity, it also presented the prospect of much faster data rates, and as a result the MBOA continued to accrete members despite Motorola's protests. Motorola attempted to develop a compromise lower-speed Common Signaling Mode ("UWB CSM") so DS-UWB and MB-OFDM devices could coexist, but the process descended into squabble, and Motorola pulled out of the WiMedia Alliance to establish the competing <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20040410183724/http://www.uwbforum.org:80/Membership.html">UWB Forum</a> in 2004 exclusively focused on DS-UWB with CSM.
</p><p>
As the standards argument raged in the background, OEMs meanwhile started evaluating potential market applications. After all, just about any potential short-range interconnect could be built on it; proposals to replace or reimplement Bluetooth with UWB were considered, as well as transports for IPv4 networking and FireWire (IEEE 1394). The original wireless USB concept in particular came from Motorola's new spinoff Freescale, who was determined to win the war anyway by getting their chipset to retail first, but also from Intel, who through its heavy influence on the USB Implementers Forum (USB-IF) persuaded the organization to adopt WiMedia's version of MB-OFDM as their officially blessed USB solution for high-speed wireless devices. In February 2004 Intel announced the formation of the Wireless USB (W-USB) Promoter Group, composed of themselves, Agere (now part of Broadcom via the former LSI Logic), Hewlett-Packard, Microsoft, NEC, Philips and Samsung, with an aim for products within the next year. Because the W-USB name clashed with Freescale's initial branding, Intel and the USB-IF eventually settled on CW-USB ("Certified Wireless USB") and the MBOA was merged into the WiMedia Alliance in 2005. Now that the attempt to make an IEEE standard had clearly stalled for good, WiMedia submitted its own specification to Ecma instead, published as ECMA-368, and the 802.15.3a Task Group subsequently disbanded in January 2006.<!-- https://spectrum.ieee.org/no-strings-attached -->
</p><p>
Both Freescale W-USB (later changed to Cord-Free USB and then Cable-Free USB,<!-- https://web.archive.org/web/20061006143735/http://www.uwbforum.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=120&Itemid=2 --> both of which we'll call CF-USB for short) and Intel CW-USB conceptually replicate the host-centric nature of USB 2.0, hewing more or less to the same basic topology but obviously without wires. Both systems supported up to 127 devices and necessarily the over-the-air connection was encrypted, both with AES-128.<!-- https://www.eetimes.com/making-usb-without-wires-work-for-consumers/ --> There were of course no compliant devices yet, nor compliant computers, so both competing standards required a dongle on the PC side and offered wireless USB hubs to connect existing peripherals. The main user-facing difference between Cable-Free and Certified Wireless USB was that CF-USB was intentionally, and in this case ironically, much closer to the wired USB spec. In particular, although CF-USB connections could only go point-to-point — just like a single cord — all USB features and transfer types were supported, even isochronous transfers for real-time data. CF-USB also had the compatibility edge in that the other end would look just like a regular USB hub to the computer, so no software update was necessary. CW-USB, on the other hand, although its virtual bus was much more flexible and devices could be hosts to other devices, wasn't fully backwards-compatible with all USB devices and needed new drivers and operating system support.

CW-USB's new approach predictably yielded new bugs, slowing development. As a result, the simpler CF-USB devices did indeed progress faster, most notably Belkin's Cable-Free USB kit and Gefen's Wireless USB Extender which were demonstrated in 2006 at Winter CES and Macworld. These units used both Freescale's UWB radio and Canadian startup Icron's ExtremeUSB extender chipset, another UWB Forum member, presenting a reportedly perfect USB facsimile to the computer. The Belkin device as presented was a typical dongle-hub affair, but the Gefen set used smaller one-to-one transceivers between a computer and a target device, shown to attendees linking a Mac and a digital camera.
</p><p>
And that was it for CF-USB, because just a couple months later Freescale and parent Motorola unexpectedly pulled out of the UWB Forum in April, citing a desire to focus on their own CF-USB products. Neither of these CF-USB devices reached store shelves: Belkin was forced to retool around MB-OFDM after all, and Gefen completely abandoned their units in lieu of a new, <em>non-</em>UWB wireless USB system that I'll come back to later on. Freescale's team eventually suffered management departures and failed to release any future CF-USB hardware,<!-- https://www.edn.com/uwb-gets-black-eye-review-freescale-quietly-pulls-plug/ --> after which the UWB Forum itself imploded in 2007.

In the meantime the hype around CW-USB grew, as shown in this period advertisement. Intel, startup Alereon and Kodak made the first public demonstration of CW-USB at the Intel Developer's Forum in September 2006.</p><!-- https://www.cnet.com/culture/wireless-usb-poised-to-cut-the-cable/ --><p> Using a USB PC dongle made by Taiwanese OEM Gemtek, exhibitors were shown a PC and a digital camera associating with each other and the PC downloading images from the camera to its desktop, which Intel claimed could run at up to USB 2.0's full 480Mb/s at three metres (110Mb/sec up to 10). One heavily anticipated application was as a docking station you could just walk up to: if you had been previously associated, then boom, you were connected. The bandwidth, Intel promised, would be real and it would be spectacular.
</p><p>
A few months later, Belkin's reworked dongle-hub kit — initially still called "Cable-Free" until Freescale objected — finally emerged for retail sale in 2007. Unfortunately, the chipset switch eliminated Belkin's Mac compatibility and it only came with Windows drivers. Worse, Belkin's hub took it on the chin in <a href="https://www.smallnetbuilder.com/everything-else/other-reviews/belkin-cable-free-usb-slow-expensive-cutting-edge-technology/">various</a> <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2006-12-05-hands-on-with-belkins-cable-free-usb-hub.html">reviews</a>, citing an <em>eighty percent</em> reduction in throughput if the devices were just a foot away, and another 30% on top of that at four feet, with a maximum range of somewhere around six (or one big wall). This probably made it more secure, but definitely not more convenient, and far short of the claimed 10 <em>metre</em> maximum range. It doesn't look like Belkin sold very many.
</p><p>
Another vendor was D-Link, who produced both dongles and hubs along with a starter kit containing one of each. This NOS example, utterly unused in a sealed box, had an original MSRP of about $170 ($225 in 2025 dollars) but showed up on eBay for $12. I couldn't resist picking it up and a couple other cheap CW-USB products to play with, all of which carried the proud and official Certified Wireless USB logo. I made sure one of them was a docking station since that was intended to be the killer app.

In CW-USB parlance for "legacy" wired devices, the computer side is called an HWA (Host Wireless Adapter) and the device side, which could be a hub or an actual device, is called a DWA (Device Wireless Adapter), both of which could be built-in to compliant hardware. What's notable about these packages is that <em>all</em> of them come with an HWA, even though only one of them actually has a DWA <em>hub</em>: the D-Link starter kit (model DUB-9240), consisting of a DUB-2240 4-port DWA USB 2.0 hub and a DUB-1210 HWA. The TRULink #29596 Wireless USB to VGA and Audio Kit has two downstream devices with on-board DWAs, one for a VGA monitor (up to 1600x1200 or 1680x1050) and one for analogue audio, plus its own HWA; the Atlona AT-PCLink Wireless USB DisplayDock offers DVI video, 3.5mm (1/8") audio and two USB ports, officially for your mouse and keyboard. The dock base, interestingly enough, is <em>not</em> a CW-USB device itself: you have to plug a DWA into it (included) which can go in one of two ports depending on physical configuration. In the package Atlona also includes <em>another</em> HWA.
</p><p>
However, since they're all allegedly CW-USB 1.0 compliant, you should be able to use any HWA you want. (Theoretically. That's called "foreshadowing.") The D-Link and TRULink HWAs only support Windows XP SP3 and Vista — there was a short-lived Linux implementation that Intel themselves wrote, but it was very incomplete and eventually removed — and the Atlona HWA does too, but it also claims support for Windows 7 and even Mac OS X (Leopard and Snow Leopard). So our test system will be ...

... my late sister-in-law's black MacBook, the most powerful spec of the A1181 polycarbonate Intel models, a 2.4GHz Penryn Core 2 Duo T8300 running Snow Leopard 10.6.8. We'll use it to run the native Mac drivers as well as the Windows drivers. Unfortunately the optical drive in this laptop is shot and I haven't gotten around to replacing it, and this is one of the models where Boot Camp will not start the installer from an external drive, so we'll be running 64-bit Windows Vista Business — just because it's what I have around, no other particular reason — under VMware Fusion 4. This will limit our testing options a little bit but the native support will still be a good test of performance. (I'll have a note about its PowerPC support a little later, but you can completely forget about it on modern Apple silicon as it relies on forbidden unsigned not-notarized bad-for-ya don't-make-Tim-Cook-cry kernel extensions that will certainly blow up your computer and cause it to sing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvfD5rnkTws">Virus Alert</a> by Weird Al. Get out your Intel if you want to try this.)
</p><p>
That covers the HWA and the HWA-DWA link, but being "USB" (after a fashion) you also need a driver for the device it's connecting to. Fortunately the TRULink and Atlona video systems are both DisplayLink-based, supporting screen mirroring and spanning, for which (Intel) Mac drivers also exist.

In the D-Link box is the HWA-dongle, the DWA-hub and a power adapter for the DWA (5V, 3A). All three HWAs here are bus-powered.

Interestingly, the D-Link DWA-hub has a sticker on the back warning you about insecure wireless access. This is commendable, but CW-USB does not use WEP, WPA or WPA2. (We'll get to something that <em>does</em> later on.)

As CW-USB is effectively a network, there are MACs and PHYs, and so the HWA and any DWAs have MAC addresses.

You'll also note that D-Link's DWA-hub has a PIN. This is part of the CW-USB <i>association</i> process, which is necessary because obviously you don't want malicious USB devices trying to talk to you, and you don't want your next-door neighbour possibly being able to use your printer or read tax returns on your thumb drive. (I didn't know that was deductable!) The process of association generates a new AES-128 session key and records both 128-bit host and device IDs for future recognition. This shared 384-bit association context remains in effect until explicitly disabled: the associated device now won't interact with HWAs it doesn't know, other than to potentially associate with them also, and the HWA will only talk to devices with which it has been associated. It is possible, and absolutely supported, for a device to be associated with multiple HWAs.
</p><p>
Association in CW-USB can be done one of three ways, either by factory pre-association (the TRULink and Atlona devices come pre-associated with their HWAs, for example), numeric association where the device provides an on-screen code (like Bluetooth pairing) or the PIN on the underside of the device can be manually entered (an alpha-numeric code like <tt>D0NTH4CKM3</tt>), or, uniquely, by cable association.

Cable association is where you <em>physically</em> connect the CW-USB device to your PC or Mac via USB cable, let it be recognized by the HWA's driver, and then disconnect it. It then continues to act connected, just via the HWA. The D-Link DWA-hub is cable-associated as part of the installation process, or can be associated by PIN; it is the only one of these three that is not pre-associated. All devices support pre-association and some sort of numeric association, but a physical USB port is naturally required for cable association. It is nevertheless the most secure of the three methods, first because you have to have physical custody of both the device and the computer, second because it's a new and unique key, and third because key creation and distribution occurs entirely via the cable and never over the air. Unfortunately it's not possible to blacklist the other association methods, so you'd better not let your neighbour get your PIN. (You pay <em>how much</em> in mortgage interest??) Some devices like the TRUlinks mercifully do support changing it, but that ability didn't seem universal in the devices I looked at.
</p><p>
In this case, all three devices support cable-association. The D-Link hub and the TRULink devices do so via their USB ports, but the Atlona dock does it by plugging the DWA into the computer instead of the docking base itself.
</p><p>
The reverse process is also obviously possible to de-associate a device, and you can outright block devices as well, though this may require some fiddling if they were pre-associated. Similarly, most devices, including this one, have a reset button which will clear the association context(s) stored in them, removing any undesired linkages.

The HWA appears to have been made by WiQuest. They were possibly the biggest of the WiMedia startups, booting up in Texas in 2003, yet despite their chipsets having an 85% share of the wireless USB market flamed out in 2008 — a pretty damning summation of how <em>not</em> big the wireless USB market ultimately got. A few pieces of WiQuest and their IP are now part of modern Staccato Communications.

The installer is very clear that you are <em>not</em> to plug in either the dongle or the hub until installation is complete and the hub has been cable-associated.

The Wireless USB Control Center is a fairly simplistic application showing all associated devices and their statuses. As we don't have the dongle-HWA installed yet, the hub-DWA is listed as associated but not connected.

The dongles get better reception if they are oriented vertically, so a stiff bendy USB cable is included in the package which you can plug the dongle into. We connect that, which is also passed through to the Vista guest, and its bright orange light illuminates ...

There isn't much else you can do here except deassociate the device, or, if a new device appears in the list, attempt to associate with it.

Likewise, the Advanced tab doesn't let you do much more other than change the channels in use. Here, on a United States system, all of the ones we'll explore in this article defaulted to channel 13.

As a first test, we'll just plug in a regular old USB thumb drive, the exact same drive we were using to copy things into Vista, so we know it works directly connected. Active ports on the hub glow orange. I expected to see Windows configure the device, but instead we got a very surprising error:

</p><p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgAIzOyPu1_xQ3l9jyZLa7utmfyHs9c-rvI9w7tbMT_KS4oXYUregqT70-Mgn6Ht6cBtJL1dgnbOj7NUpomLWt43RKbxD50PsIJUMjKmckk4IUvoOI1H0ZxrE0qRFfERclL-wQ4w9nP8hnL40zK3oLJ4xdpUmD5Tavob7IBy8jUUODzCu98cT4Db32v9n4/s1280/dub9240-9-fail.png"><img alt="" data-original-height="800" data-original-width="1280" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgAIzOyPu1_xQ3l9jyZLa7utmfyHs9c-rvI9w7tbMT_KS4oXYUregqT70-Mgn6Ht6cBtJL1dgnbOj7NUpomLWt43RKbxD50PsIJUMjKmckk4IUvoOI1H0ZxrE0qRFfERclL-wQ4w9nP8hnL40zK3oLJ4xdpUmD5Tavob7IBy8jUUODzCu98cT4Db32v9n4/s320/dub9240-9-fail.png" width="320"></a></p><p>

Windows couldn't even determine what the device was. I'm prepared to admit this might be the VM. In fact, my first attempt at this was with Virtual PC 7 running the included Windows XP SP3 on the Quad G5, and while Windows XP under VPC7 would associate the hub and see the HWA, the HWA kept stuttering and dropping off the bus, even with the G5's performance cranked up to cheesegrater tornado. 
</p><p>
But this wasn't true for all the devices I tried.

For example, I plugged in a iConcepts PDA adapter, which is better understood as a Prolific PL-2303 RS232-to-USB converter, and it was immediately recognized.

However, note well: the device is completely unseen by Mac OS and thus by the VMware Fusion host, even though its guest <em>can</em> see it. Although I found it initially surprising that VMware didn't ask me about the device when I connected it, upon reflection it's perfectly logical that wireless USB devices wouldn't be seen at all by the Mac because we've effectively constructed a new and separate USB bus completely outside of it. For all the devices I connected to the hub-DWA, VMware was absolutely unaware of all of them, including the hub itself; the only device the MacBook and therefore VMware saw was the HWA. This is probably good from a performance view though possibly bad from a device control view.

After scaring up a signed Vista x86_64 driver for Prolific devices, Windows now sees and installs the device, connected to the wireless hub.

That's good news, because the original task that caused us to embark on all this was getting the Palm smartwatch both networked and mobile. USB Palms <a href="http://oldvcr.blogspot.com/2023/09/the-fossil-wrist-pda-becomes-tiny.html">emulate a serial port</a> but only appear on the USB bus when there is activity, such as kicking off a HotSync. Notice the only thing connected to the MacBook is the HWA (all ports are on the left side of this model), but with the watch connected to the hub-DWA the Vista VM sees the new USB device appear.

... because it's an unsigned driver, Windows Vista refuses to load it, and HotSyncing still won't work. I didn't feel like futzing with this more and a regular user would have likely have given up at this point. However, the fact the Prolific did connect and <em>does</em> appear to work suggests this should work on, say, Windows XP.

The PCLink's dock base has two USB ports and two USB ports. The two USB ports (on the top and front) are for where you want to put the DWA, since if you mount this somewhere you'll still want to keep the DWA vertical for best reception. The two USB ports (on the rear) are for your devices, officially the keyboard and mouse, but other low-speed devices will also work since internally it's just a hub (a wired printer would likely be a common application). The DVI video port and 3.5mm audio port are here too, along with the wallwart power port.
</p><p>
The DWA and HWA are on the left, both based on the Wisair WSR601 single-chip system. Wisair was a 2001 startup enterprise of the Israeli RAD Group specifically oriented around UWB, and as such was one of the earliest chipset designers for CW-USB. Indeed, the revised Belkin wireless hub also reportedly used a WSR601, so it's possible this Mac driver could work with that device too. RAD eventually spun Wisair off but its fortunes foundered along with the rest of the wireless USB ecosystem, and it went into receivership in 2012.

The HWA dongle fits nicely in the MacBook's ports, and the jet black colour matches nicely too. A green LED blinks with activity: no blinking indicates no paired device, and blinking rate generally correlates with throughput.

The DWA's twin configurations. Since we were using it on a table, I put the DWA in the top slot instead of the front one.

The most recent set of drivers I could get was version 120.36.1.0. No more obviously recent version appeared on Atlona's Wayback copy. I noted with amusement that an old version of the installer was in the Trash, making the </p><tt>.dmg</tt><p> double the size it needed to be. A </p><tt>help</tt><p> alias points to a small HTML-based manual, but the Windows version has a full PDF available on the disc.

When we restart, a new menubar icon appears which I can well imagine some users confused with Wi-Fi. It has two arcs and a dot. When all are hollow, no HWA has been detected.

Upon plugging in the HWA, the dot at the corner goes solid and the HWA starts hunting for a device in range. Since it comes pre-paired with the dock and the dock was barely six inches away, it didn't have long to wait.

Now connected, the rings all go solid, and you are hooked up to the dock base.

If we look at the status in the System Profiler, we can see the difference when the dock is connected. With the HWA plugged in, we see the dongle (and a suspicious serial number).

With the HWA connected to the dock, however, the driver sets up — as we observed in VMware with Vista — a whole new USB bus of its own, because of course it is, headed by the HWA. While both devices are called a "Wireless HWA Dongle" (you can change this), their USB product IDs differ and this entry is in fact for the DWA.

To my great delight, while installing it on the MacBook I noticed that the installer was Universal (even to 10.2! but that's because it's a BitRock InstallBuilder package) <em>and</em> had a Universal payload, even though Atlona said explicitly it wasn't compatible with PowerPC. I grabbed my great big A1139 17" DLSD PowerBook G4 1.67GHz, the last and mightiest PowerBook which I use as a portable DVD player and Leopard 10.5.8 test system, to see if it would work.

The installer does indeed run. Being BitRock, it's actually Tcl under the hood. Fun fact.

And the menubar icon does indeed appear. However, despite the HWA being visible in System Profiler, it's never recognized by the kernel extension and both the menubar icon and the preference pane insist no host is present. I suspect this is endian-related.

Back on the MacBook, we'll go ahead and install the DisplayLink driver now. I used the most recent one I could get from Atlona's Wayback, which was version 1.7. It's a regular Installer package.

After a restart, when the Mac gets in range of the dock, the screen flashes like a second monitor has been connected (because, as far as Snow Leopard is concerned, one has been) and a new "virtual monitor" appears. We'll come back to this in a little bit when we talk about performance. For now, let's proceed with our original mission: can we get the Fossil Abacus smartwatch to sync <em>this</em> way?

To the best of my knowledge there never was a first-party Palm Desktop that ran natively on Intel. (You can, of course, compile </p><tt>pilot-xfer</tt><p>, but that doesn't give you the rest of the PIM, and Mark/Space's Missing Sync <a href="https://discussions.apple.com/thread/5741192">does not run on Mavericks or later</a>.) Fortunately, this is Snow Leopard, so we have O.G. Rosetta.

Periodically and possibly coincidentally, the icon started occasionally flashing a "1" in the menu bar during and after the test sync. This seems to indicate other interfering activity on the WiMedia bandgroup in use (we'll get to how we know the bandgroup is 1 in a moment). I didn't notice much slowing when this happened, but a HotSync isn't a particularly high-speed transaction either.

Besides the menubar icon, the Atlona driver package also installs a Wireless USB Manager prefpane in System Preferences. (This, too, is Universal and has a PowerPC executable, and it, too, didn't work.) The Wireless USB Dongle appears, which is actually the DWA in the dock, and no other devices.

While you can rename them, and even block them, you cannot disassociate the default device. More importantly, there is no option to actually <em>associate</em> or pair a <em>new</em> device. (Remember what I said about foreshadowing?) This restriction appears to be entirely due to the software and isn't unique to the Mac version; the Atlona manual indicates that the Windows version can't associate new devices either, other than possibly another Atlona dock. Officially it can be re-paired with its original DWA and that's it.

I also tried connecting the D-Link hub with a cable to see if it would associate that way, and still nothing happened. You could plug in a hub into the dock itself, I suppose, but you can't add any additional devices directly.
</p><p>
I did search the hard disk to see if I could figure out where the pairing data was stored and maybe forge an entry of my own, and after some digging around I found <tt>/System/Library/WUSB/CBA.app/Contents/Resources/DB.plist</tt>, which lists associated devices. (The very location of this <tt>.plist</tt> again suggests it wasn't intended for user modification.) Here is the relevant portion, with keys suppressed:

You can identify the WiMedia bandgroup (1, 3.1GHz to 4.8GHz), the 128-bit host and device IDs, and the 384-bit association context (which includes both IDs) in the key-value pairs. Yes, I could insert another device entry easily enough, but I wouldn't know the AES key the other end is using, so I couldn't compute a valid context.

Since this driver is running natively and we're not paying a VM tax, let's see how well video streaming worked since oodles of cableless bandwidth was just about the entire use case for wireless USB.

Here I've simply mirrored the MacBook to my wife's Samsung secondary monitor. The dock is about a foot from the MacBook, out of frame to the left. 

</p><p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhjIzJCmC5JyYx2bixnelNCeeCsv5xjtMic9y3qvIIUzL-tLavLgm5sjqBoFSP7qhUrr4pO9F7osDRFYV1522bwdeDaOpYx-k_v62qQBPHS-hfslNMdn0Cal_lAFqfaPLlC-r58y1zp4JQekA8rSYLWvtq5Y6BLKH9WgIEE0xwPfwzEsXCddkQK6KAxHig/s1280/Screen%20shot%202025-05-03%20at%2010.16.45%20AM.png"><img alt="" data-original-height="800" data-original-width="1280" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhjIzJCmC5JyYx2bixnelNCeeCsv5xjtMic9y3qvIIUzL-tLavLgm5sjqBoFSP7qhUrr4pO9F7osDRFYV1522bwdeDaOpYx-k_v62qQBPHS-hfslNMdn0Cal_lAFqfaPLlC-r58y1zp4JQekA8rSYLWvtq5Y6BLKH9WgIEE0xwPfwzEsXCddkQK6KAxHig/s320/Screen%20shot%202025-05-03%20at%2010.16.45%20AM.png" width="320"></a></p><p>

The Samsung doesn't support exactly the native resolution of the MacBook which is why it looks squashed, but you can see it correctly detected the model. How well does it perform? A good stress test is high-resolution video, which the manual warns you against because it would be choppy. We don't let manuals tell us what to do in this house. Manuals are suggestions. Manuals can sometimes be wrong. Let's play the <a href="http://www.macyourself.com/2008/11/13/grab-the-source-files-for-that-snazzy-leopard-welcome-video/">Snow Leopard welcome video</a> and prove it wrong. (The Snow Leopard welcome video has audio in a separate file, so this comparison movie has no sound.)
</p>
<p>
And, well, the manual wasn't wrong. There is a slight but noticeable lag and there are many dropped frames of video on the mirrored side; the best that could be said is it's watchable. Think "playing YouTube videos over Microsoft Teams screen share" and that would be about right.

On the other hand, it does work rather better as a separate monitor you can span to. This was probably its strongest suit, and I could see myself absolutely using it this way were it not for the fact that other things are also too slow. Let's plug that same USB drive in and try copying the 10.6.8 combo installer, which is a 1.09GB file. With the USB thumb drive connected directly to the MacBook, it takes roughly a minute, give or take. (System rebooted between attempts to ensure no caching.)

The estimated time warbled a bit even though the laptop wasn't moving, and was about six inches from the dock, but was pretty close to the original estimate; my two tries came in at around 10 minutes or roughly 1.9 megabytes (15 megabits) per second in this very unscientific analysis. That's not even close to the promised maximum speed, let alone USB 2.0 directly connected. No wonder these things didn't fly off the shelves.
</p><p>
That said, in my testing the effective range came out better than I thought, even though it remained far short of the promise; it still maintained a connection even around the corner through a couple walls about 10 feet away. Speeds started suffering but it did generally work. When I got down the hall from it, though, the link was lost. It recovered pretty well from this when I moved back into range, considering, but if you stay out of range too long then the Mac may think the devices are gone which is not something you want happening with mounted filesystems.

I'm not going to say much about the TRULink package here except that it also has its own HWA, but unlike Atlona's, its driver lets it associate with other devices and this is supported and documented in the manual. However, I can't tell what chipset it has; the System Profiler identifies it as a "Cables To Go HWA" with vendor $10aa (Cables To Go, TRULink being their brand) and product $0001. Regardless, the Atlona Mac driver will not talk to it. I think their HWA is more professional looking with the screw-on antenna, but that also makes it a bit bulkier than Atlona's HWA, and it only does screen and audio sharing with no USB hub functionality at all — if you want that, you'll have to go get one separately. A nice touch are the PIN association labels and the ability to change them, though the supported PINs are only four digits (cue Spaceballs luggage joke) and the change tool doesn't work in Vista 64-bit.

Were there alternatives to CW-USB at the time other than CF-USB? Surprisingly, at least one, which was sold by two companies. You'll remember I mentioned that when Freescale bailed out on CF-USB Gefen bailed out too, but unlike Belkin Gefen exited UWB completely. Instead, when released in 2007 the revised Gefen Wireless USB Extender, now branded the Gefen Wireless USB <em>2.0</em> Extender, used a much more familiar wireless transport: 802.11g. Yup — it's USB over <em>Wi-Fi</em>.

Completely dispensing with the device-to-device single port original, the 2.0 version was totally redesigned and, with a four-port hub instead, bigger. In a functional sense the new Gefen is yet another dongle-hub kit, except the "dongle" (which Gefen calls the "sender") is the same size as the hub (which Gefen calls the "receiver"), and both also require their own individual power supplies — you'd only have a net reduction in the cables on your desk by moving nearly everything to the receiver. On the other hand, the build quality is excellent and the metal cases are as tough and rugged as its $400 MSRP (about $600 in 2025 dollars).

The Gefen kit, however, is actually a rebadge — of Icron's second attempt at the market, the same Canadian company that created the ExtremeUSB chipset for the doomed original CF-USB units. After the UWB Forum cratered, Icron looked for another wireless option to pair with their chips and found it in 802.11g, creating the Icron WiRanger extender in 2007 which they themselves also sold at retail and licensed to Gefen. Even the physical layout, ports and LEDs are exactly the same; only the case and labels differ, though the Gefen-badged version seems to be more common. Icron calls the sender the LEX ("Local EXtender") and the receiver the REX ("Remote EXtender"). Interestingly, the WiRanger is badged as a "Cable Free USB 2.0 Hub" — no dash, mind you — despite not actually being real Slim Shady Cable-Free USB.
</p><p>
In some ways the new system was less functional than the CF-USB prototype, in some ways more. It remained OS-agnostic and required no new drivers, simply appearing as a regular USB hub to the computer the sender is connected to. Being 802.11g, however, you're still limited to 54 Mbit/sec and indeed half the minimum 110 Mbit/sec claimed by CF-USB, so you might wonder how it can support the full 480 Mbit/s of USB 2.0. The answer is, it doesn't — you get 54 Mbit/s, which all fourteen potentially connected devices must share, and what can't be buffered or retransmitted gets dropped on the ground. Gefen's and Icron's documentation differ on what's not supported — Gefen says no isochronous transfers, Icron says no <em>bulk</em> transfers, and I tend to believe Icron because it's <em>their</em> hardware — but both are clear that high-bandwidth devices like UVC webcams are going to have a bad time: "Icron Technologies Corporation does not guarantee that all USB devices are compatible with the WiRanger and only recommends the product be used with keyboard, mouse, and some flash drives."

Unlike CW-USB's association mating ritual, these devices ship paired, or they can be paired in the field by pointing their IR windows at each other to generate a new shared key. The code stays internal to the devices, so you don't have to junk them if someone got your PIN. (You thought your A/C qualified for a tax credit?) Unfortunately, the encryption is limited to achingly insecure 64-bit WEP despite the fact pretty much any 802.11g radio would have supported at least WPA. It can be placed on other 2.4GHz channels to avoid interference and has much better range than the CW-USB transceivers did (about 100 feet), but in this case that would be a minus because now a wardriver could potentially crack into your device traffic and — worse than your nosy neighbour — remotely fuzz your USB stack at will. Fun, huh?

For this go-around, we're going to hook it up to the 15" 1.25GHz iMac G4 running Tiger 10.4.11 hulking near the kitchen. This is the machine I usually do my Palm OS work on since all my old build tools are on it and it's near the Belkin Bluetooth PAN that <a href="http://oldvcr.blogspot.com/2022/05/gopher-on-palm-pilot-and-pitfalls-of.html">some of my devices use</a>.

Here's the base USB tree before everything comes up.

When the receiver and sender are in range of each other, they will automatically link. This can take up to thirty seconds according to the manual, but here it took about ten.

</p><p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhK_B1j9n6zO92i9ZC4PTJNQ427pUC73SegmRk7s0_qKxxr7l4IX-1AwCjC_AIO32IBOT0lnXt6zRYint3Iqd47MwvufhEILjwcon_17adZPI0ZgQ01QYgDkwtPqQO8kndO-II3mmqJdocY5wbLnMtO83QKJ4N1281I0NAWJW8UxjTcKESOVduAw9izgC4/s1024/Picture%2024.png"><img alt="" data-original-height="768" data-original-width="1024" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhK_B1j9n6zO92i9ZC4PTJNQ427pUC73SegmRk7s0_qKxxr7l4IX-1AwCjC_AIO32IBOT0lnXt6zRYint3Iqd47MwvufhEILjwcon_17adZPI0ZgQ01QYgDkwtPqQO8kndO-II3mmqJdocY5wbLnMtO83QKJ4N1281I0NAWJW8UxjTcKESOVduAw9izgC4/s320/Picture%2024.png" width="320"></a></p><p>

At that point, a new hub appears, like any other USB hub. That's all there is to it.
</p><p>
I wanted to do some performance tests with it, but strangely macOS Sequoia will not recognize the sender when connected to my M1 MacBook Air, even though it worked fine connected to the Raptor POWER9 in Fedora 41 and was seen as a hub there too. So we'll do the tests on the MacBook as well, which also had no problem seeing and using the pair. Again, we'll just copy that same 1.09GB combo installer and see how long it takes.

Because it's a 54Mbit/s radio, I was prepared to see it take substantially longer than the Atlona, but it came up with an 11-minute estimate ...

</p><p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgGevBVqFheiDjc00mpByk6AFAym_L5dkjFK2zhUD9Y-oziaoKC_rYnKvpS90EyZf-GRIPWlSpA2QAKRpcIaQ-dp_V1gT9dDY8lFVGDPb7aJnJKnfHsqQClxKe5xGwabKTLreOJLDaDpR85mov6yjN-BVOqDnenV2fkeASudHtfGz25nUQEe6g6UNX4ZVg/s1280/Screen%20shot%202025-05-03%20at%2010.54.50%20AM.png"><img alt="" data-original-height="800" data-original-width="1280" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgGevBVqFheiDjc00mpByk6AFAym_L5dkjFK2zhUD9Y-oziaoKC_rYnKvpS90EyZf-GRIPWlSpA2QAKRpcIaQ-dp_V1gT9dDY8lFVGDPb7aJnJKnfHsqQClxKe5xGwabKTLreOJLDaDpR85mov6yjN-BVOqDnenV2fkeASudHtfGz25nUQEe6g6UNX4ZVg/s320/Screen%20shot%202025-05-03%20at%2010.54.50%20AM.png" width="320"></a></p><p>

... and took 11 minutes with the sender about three feet away from the receiver. That's not much slower than the Atlona, which supposedly could do the full 480Mbit/s at that short distance yet here it never did. Let's try the watch now.

</p><p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgCU1mpjKN0qCepqs1VHbN1zv-fVVg2PMBKKaZIaCDPSsQcyaFODQt9bF_PcdJI8a9Vk3xW6LOYnH7dg6EfiUh06PesuGV1E1XpZE6tqUYge5P16sDn-c9D-7Ilfo2kb5b-avsCB1oKJo3buj8Du_08BYq2xjIwOkxw77sUG7_MZ6-UqIKFTz2Ez-VMi58/s4080/PXL_20250503_015026885.jpg"><img alt="" data-original-height="3072" data-original-width="4080" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgCU1mpjKN0qCepqs1VHbN1zv-fVVg2PMBKKaZIaCDPSsQcyaFODQt9bF_PcdJI8a9Vk3xW6LOYnH7dg6EfiUh06PesuGV1E1XpZE6tqUYge5P16sDn-c9D-7Ilfo2kb5b-avsCB1oKJo3buj8Du_08BYq2xjIwOkxw77sUG7_MZ6-UqIKFTz2Ez-VMi58/s320/PXL_20250503_015026885.jpg" width="320"></a></p><p>

Kicking off a HotSync with the watch connected to the receiver. Here we're using </p><tt>pilot-xfer</tt><p> from the command line instead of Palm Desktop.

</p><p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjzn7ByYdCnFxwP9KNwNboMbTnjyNrAev5nYEZefpuMlarKIEYXsshQawzseTtPMT-9v7SiiN4gogrmVagaK7IZTI9oWlCZgSg5tWHTrEAvugeu5T5jjPSjZQxKQhUKLtyiLuSukvSzefkhpsmakV6X6pkLhxxu4cU1SHzQn8Hd6NOOPoIMqIo3Lo4M39c/s1024/Picture%2026.png"><img alt="" data-original-height="768" data-original-width="1024" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjzn7ByYdCnFxwP9KNwNboMbTnjyNrAev5nYEZefpuMlarKIEYXsshQawzseTtPMT-9v7SiiN4gogrmVagaK7IZTI9oWlCZgSg5tWHTrEAvugeu5T5jjPSjZQxKQhUKLtyiLuSukvSzefkhpsmakV6X6pkLhxxu4cU1SHzQn8Hd6NOOPoIMqIo3Lo4M39c/s320/Picture%2026.png" width="320"></a></p><p>

This isn't particularly fast, even at close range. It transfered 1777K in 132 seconds, i.e., 13.46KB/sec (107.68Kbit/sec). Compared to a wired sync it's about ten times slower, and transmission tended to be rather bursty. Still, it completed successfully.

So let's try for the brass ring and have the watch completely networked through the iMac, since it's already set up to provide PPP-over-USB to a connected device. We'll use the trusty USB-TCP Bridge here, with its code modified for the Fossil's product and vendor IDs, though you could also use <a href="http://oldvcr.blogspot.com/2025/04/lets-give-provenix-barely-adequate-pre.html">Slirp</a> or </p><a href="http://oldvcr.blogspot.com/2023/06/o-brother-geobook-lets-get-thou-back-on.html"><tt>usb2ppp</tt></a><p>.

I'm able to trigger PPP from the watch in the other room and surf Gopherspace from the watch, just <a href="http://oldvcr.blogspot.com/2023/09/the-fossil-wrist-pda-becomes-tiny.html">as before</a>. It actually doesn't feel much different in terms of speed from a direct connect and I didn't find it particularly unstable. Of what we've explored here, the Gefen box seems the least complicated solution, though the receiver pulled a bit more battery power and of course you'd need a host around to connect through. As such I'm still using the "Raspberry Pi in a camera bag" notion for the time being, but it's nice to see it can work other ways.
</p><p>
My experience with the Gefen/Icron extender was generally consistent with other reviews that found it adequate for undemanding tasks <a href="https://www.mymac.com/gefen-wireless-2-0-usb-extender-review/">like printing</a>. However, it doesn't look like either Icron or Gefen sold many of them, likely due to their unattractive price tag. Icron did announce plans for a much faster wireless USB solution on the 60GHz band using 802.11ad, which with its 7 Gbit/s capacity would easily handle USB 2.0 and even 5 Gbit/s 3.0, but it doesn't seem like the device was ever offered for sale. (A couple people have mentioned to me that there were other ≥802.11ad wireless USB products out there, including WiGig. Their bandwidth was reportedly more than sufficient for video but I don't have any of those devices here, and they are better understood as Wi-Fi routers that also do USB device sharing.) Although Icron still <a href="https://www.icron.com/product-category/usb-extenders/">sells extenders</a>, now as a division of Analog Devices, all of their current products are wired-only.
</p><p>
As for CW-USB, by 2008 few laptops on the market offered the feature, and even for those that did like the Lenovo ThinkPad X200, it was always an extra option. That meant most computers that wanted to connect to a CW-USB device still needed a HWA-dongle, so they still took up a port, and HWAs never got produced in enough numbers to be cheap. On top of that, it further didn't help matters that anything close to the promised maximum bandwidth was hardly ever observed in real-world situations. Device makers, meanwhile, mostly chose to wait out greater availability of CW-USB capable computers, and since that never happened, neither a large number of computers with built-in CW-USB nor CW-USB devices were ever made before the standard was abandoned.
</p><p>
The last stand of UWB as a device interconnect was ironically as a proposal for Bluetooth 3.0+HS, the 2009 optional high-data-rate specification. 3.0+HS introduced AMP (Alternative MAC/PHY) as a bolt-on method, in which low-speed Bluetooth would be used to set up a link and then the high-speed data exchange would occur over the second transport, originally MB-OFDM. With CW-USB fading from the market, however, the WiMedia Alliance closed its doors in 2009 and shed its existing work to the USB-IF, the W-USB Promoter Group and the Bluetooth SIG. This move was controversial with some WiMedia members, who consequently refused to grant access to their intellectual property to the new successor groups, and instead AMP ended up being based on 802.11 as well. The AMP extension was little used and eventually removed in Bluetooth 5.3.
</p><p>
Is there a moral to this story? I'm not quite certain. As so often happens, the best technology didn't win; in my eyes CF-USB had the potential for being more widely adopted because of its simplicity and compatibility, but was ruined when Freescale got greedy and it never recovered. That said, the real question is whether wireless USB <em>itself</em>, with all of its broken promises, was the right approach for the WPAN concept. It's certainly not an indictment of ultra wideband, which is used today more than ever before: many chips are still produced that implement it, the best known undoubtedly being Apple's U1 and U2 chips in iOS and iOS-adjacent devices like the AirTag, and such chips continue to be widely used for things such as precise location fixing and local interactions. UWB has also been used for diverse tasks like tracking NFL players during games or parts during factory assembly, and for autonomous vehicles in particular it's extremely useful.

</p><p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjmwpFFd2dcHS4nkKKfSxPLbor4S18Louz5yFNUr5XxVPnc7CIupVFVU1xZnGACwFhLVp8CD5T-1O4QA1rVZmqiVrlgzfsK9mxbYqM-D-7Kmf7My_iiNQAy7DEbda2BdfrZdYzwyNRQBVIKlFEVD-DK_WvlL5oSAPfH4eeK3lJ0EAh47kSxtNeM2Dki2PA/s2048/IMG_0062_20250503_133506.jpg"><img alt="" data-original-height="1536" data-original-width="2048" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjmwpFFd2dcHS4nkKKfSxPLbor4S18Louz5yFNUr5XxVPnc7CIupVFVU1xZnGACwFhLVp8CD5T-1O4QA1rVZmqiVrlgzfsK9mxbYqM-D-7Kmf7My_iiNQAy7DEbda2BdfrZdYzwyNRQBVIKlFEVD-DK_WvlL5oSAPfH4eeK3lJ0EAh47kSxtNeM2Dki2PA/s320/IMG_0062_20250503_133506.jpg" width="320"></a></p><p>

However, the use of ultra wide-band for high-bandwidth applications has yet to return, and probably the biggest reason is because Bluetooth and Wi-Fi now exceed any throughput and ease-of-use promises made by available UWB silicon. Heck, almost all the pictures in this article were pushed from my Pixel 7 Pro to the M1 MacBook Air via Quick Share, in a way not unlike AMP: Bluetooth is used to identify nearby devices on the same Wi-Fi network, and, if available, Wi-Fi is used to push the data. AirDrop, too, by using Bluetooth to create a peer-to-peer Wi-Fi link. Printers speak Wi-Fi now and so do many cameras, scanners and multi-function office devices, and low bandwidth HIDs like most of today's wireless keyboards, mice or game controllers can all connect with Bluetooth. It turns out that the promise of the WPAN came true after all, slowly and gradually through the evolution of existing technologies, <em>without</em> wireless USB — and we just never noticed.
</p><p>
Maybe <em>that's</em> the moral.

<p dir="auto">There are many great community made GRUB themes to spice up your bootloader before booting into your system proper. Unfortunately, they're spread across multiple sites and it can be difficult to find good ones. As another user told me, the majority of themes on Pling (the largest host of GRUB themes currently) are fairly low effort and can be boring to trawl through. Hence, I decided to put together this page to bring attention to some decent themes I've found around the internet over time. They aren't all absolute masterpieces of course: But they've all at least had a fair amount of effort put into them, with custom backgrounds, fonts, and colours.</p>
<p dir="auto">And don't forget, <strong>themes are extremely easy to customize!</strong> Like a theme's layout but prefer a different background? Just replace the image in its folder with one of your own. Don't like the positioning of a theme's elements? Open the theme.txt and change their values. Want a different colour scheme? They're all set by HEX Values, which you can swap out in seconds. You can even convert almost any font to the type GRUB uses with the grub-mkfont command, then change the <code>item_font</code> line in the theme.txt to use it.
There's loads of potential for customization, you just have to work creatively around the limitations.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <p>Back in 2023 I went through an inter-state move with <a href="https://www.flatrate.com/moving/">Flat Rate Movers,
LTD.</a> (US DOT 488466, MC 254356). They bungled the job, damaged my stuff
and my house, and then refused to talk to me or their own insurance company. I
placed dozens of calls, wrote letters, emails, nothing worked. I finally got
some money for the damage by working with their insurer directly. I know a lot
of folks struggle with moving companies, and figured I’d write up a bit of this
story in case it helps. You can <a href="#finding-their-insurance">skip ahead</a> if you
just want to know about the FMCSA insurer database.</p>
<p>In November 2022 I scheduled the move with Flat Rate. We took a detailed video
inventory of everything to be moved. I paid over $14,000 for an “all inclusive
move”, which, per the move plan, included full packing services, blankets for furniture, boxes for electronics, lamps, and bicycles, a custom crate for a tabletop, and “extended valuation coverage”—their insurance policy.</p>
<p>A few days before the move in March 2023, Flat Rate called to tell me a
five-person team would arrive. When the crew arrived, it wasn’t Flat Rate. It
was a team of two from <a href="https://www.esquiremoving.com/">Esquire Moving Inc</a> (US DOT 2820253, MC 940499). They had
no idea they were supposed to provide packing services. The crate I paid for was nowhere to be found. They didn’t have enough boxes or blankets. I had to have everything out that day, so
there wasn’t any choice—I worked alongside the team for thirteen hours to
complete the packing and move-out.</p>
<p>I let the team handle furniture protection and loading the truck, which was a
mistake. As they unloaded a few days later, I realized much of the furniture had
been completely unprotected. My bicycle wasn’t boxed. Lamps were tossed in
loose. There was extensive damage to furniture, art, books, and my home: I
watched the crew rip a doorframe off the wall. The crew provided me with a
backdated bill of lading only on delivery.</p>
<p>I called Flat Rate a couple days later to discuss my concerns. Their
representive apologized and acknowledged that a crew of two was insufficient. I
sent Flat Rate a detailed email explaining their failure to provide promised
services, accompanied by photographs of the move process and the resulting
damage. I asked for a partial refund, and for Flat Rate to pay for the damage
they caused. I received only an out-of-office auto-response.</p>
<p>On March 21st, I received a generic form letter from Flat Rate’s claims
department. I filled out the claim forms and submitted them on March 25th, and
repeated that I needed more than an insurance claim: Flat Rate obviously failed
to provide the services I’d paid for.</p>
<p>Then things got weird. I placed call after call to the claims department. They
didn’t answer. I left voicemail after voicemail. On April 28th I reached an
actual human, but their computers were apparently down, and no supervisor was
in the building—the representative couldn’t do anything but take down a note
to call me back. They never did. I left another voicemail on May 5th. Again on
May 23rd. Again on August 4th. August 8th. I began to realize that Flat Rate’s
strategy was simply to never answer the phone.</p>
<p>On August 14th, a new hire in the claims department called me: she’d just been
hired and was taking over my case. She dispatched a local furniture company
to inspect the damages and help complete the claim. The inspectors agreed: the
movers had done extensive damage. I provided them with documentation and photos
as well.</p>
<p>On September 14 I called the furniture company and confirmed that yes, they had
submitted their report to Flat Rate. However, the furniture company had a
confidentiality agreement with Flat Rate, and could not release their report to
me. I called their contact at Flat Rate, who didn’t answer, and left a
voicemail. I called the claims representative’s direct line: her number was no
longer in service. On September 19th I got a call from the claims
representative, who promised she’d have a decision by the end of the day. Flat Rate never talked to me again.</p>
<p>I called again and again, but got voicemail every time. I tried a letter from
my lawyers, an arbitration request with the <a href="https://trucking.org/arbitration-loss-and-damages">American Trucking
Association</a>, complaints with the <a href="https://www.usa.gov/agencies/federal-motor-carrier-safety-administration">Federal Motor Carrier Safety
Administration</a>,
the <a href="https://www.dot.ny.gov/index">New York Department of Transportation</a>’s
Motor Carrier complaint department, and the <a href="https://www.dfs.ny.gov/">New York State Department of
Financial Services</a>; none of this went anywhere.</p>
<h2><a href="#finding-their-insurance" id="finding-their-insurance">Finding Their Insurance</a></h2>
<p>Here’s the thing: movers offer coverage, they have claims departments, and they do many insurance-like things in house. But for complicated reasons, they are not actually insurance companies, and are not regulated as such. Their coverage is backstopped by separate, real insurance companies. I eventually discovered I could bypass Flat Rate and talk to their backing insurance company directly. The Federal Motor Carrier Safety
Administration maintains <a href="https://li-public.fmcsa.dot.gov/LIVIEW/pkg_carrquery.prc_getdetail">a public database of moving companies</a>. Putting in their US DOT number
(488466) yields a page with some basic info. At the bottom are links with their
active and pending insurance, and the history of their insurers.</p>
<p><img src="https://aphyr.com/data/posts/381/fmcsa.png" alt="A screenshot of the FMCSA page, with links at the bottom" title="A screenshot of the FMCSA page, with links at the bottom"></p>
<p><img src="https://aphyr.com/data/posts/381/insurance-history.png" alt="A screenshot of their insurer history" title="A screenshot of their insurer history"></p>
<p>The insurance history told me their cargo insurer at the time of my move was
Hanover Insurance Company, with policy RHX H706231. The database also had
Hanover’s phone number. I was able to call Hanover and ask about the
policy—it took a few tries, but I got through to a claims adjuster there who
was able to confirm that yes, I could file a claim directly with Hanover. I
sent over a package of documentation, including the photos and the story so
far.</p>
<p>Hanover Insurance informed me they’d never heard anything about my claim, and
called Flat Rate to check. Over the next few days we discovered that Flat Rate
wasn’t just refusing to answer my calls—they wouldn’t answer calls from their insurance company either. Hanover wasn’t able to obtain the report from the furniture company, but they did agree, on the basis of the photos, to pay a reasonable amount for the damage to cargo. I had a check a few days later.</p>
<p>I’m still unhappy with Flat Rate: they charged me a good deal of money for services
they failed to deliver, and never paid for damage to the house. I was gearing up for small claims court—but during the tail end of this fiasco I was entering a fresh hell of home renovation, and got distracted. If you’re reading this, Flat Rate, you still owe me.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>What happens when you embed geospatial capabilities in generalist data tools? More people engaging with geo data.</p>

<p>I just returned from the inaugural <a href="https://conference.cloudnativegeo.org/CNGConference2025">Cloud-Native Geospatial conference</a>. It was fantastic, I highly recommend you jump in if Jed and team organized another.</p>

<p>One of the core questions discussed in the breakouts and in the halls was how to broaden the geospatial audience. How can we better communicate geo data’s utility, in all industries and domains? Many tactics and case studies were debated, but the one I kept coming back to is that of DuckDB.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.dbreunig.com/img/geo_duckdb.jpeg" alt="Google Search Trends showing the term 'geospatial' flat-lining for years before turning upward in late 2023. This was probably helped by DuckDB, whose rise in this data closely matches the 'geospatial' line."></p>

<p>This chart could’ve been pretty bleak! Interest in “geospatial” (a term that functions well as a proxy for similar terms) declined and flatlined until late 2023 – right when DuckDB released their <a href="https://duckdb.org/docs/stable/extensions/spatial/overview.html">spatial extension</a>.</p>

<p>Now, all the standard caveats about correlation and causation apply, but I’m inclined to believe this chart.</p>

<p>DuckDB lowers the barriers to working with geo data to <em>two lines</em>:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>install</span> <span>spatial</span><span>;</span> 
<span>load</span> <span>spatial</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>If the extension is already installed, it’s only <em>one</em> line.</p>

<p>Prior to this, getting up and running from a cold-start might’ve required installing or even compiling severall OSS packages, carefully noting path locations, standing up a specialized database… Enough work that a data generalist might not have bothered, or their IT department might not have supported it.</p>

<p>With DuckDB spatial, it became possible for casual geospatial work to occur. All within SQL… And that makes the ecosystem bigger.</p>

<p>As I discussed the spatial extension and this chart between sessions at the Cloud Native Geospatial conference, I wondered: would <a href="https://overturemaps.org/">Overture Maps Foundation </a> have the usage it has today without DuckDB spatial? Maybe…but probably not.</p>

<p>I’m excited to help those spikes at the end of the chart continue upward.</p>

<h2>How We Got Here</h2>



<p>When Hardcover started, I was primarily a Ruby on Rails developer. I had experience with JS frontends, but Rails was my <em>jam</em>. I’ve been building things in it since before Rails 1.0, worked at multiple startups that use it, built courses to teach it, spoken at meetups about it, and been to conferences.</p>



<p>I’ve been <em>all in</em> with Rails for a while.</p>



<p>In the late 2010s, single page applications broke out as an alternative way to create applications. It was the JavaScript framework Cambrian Explosion – with jQuery as the common ancestor (in spirit at least).</p>



<p>We had Backbone.js, Ember.js, Angular.js, Vue.js, React.js and many more. I’ve shipped code in each of these frameworks that have been seen by millions people (which is easier than it sounds! I’ve heard you can just <em>do stuff</em> – especially on the Internet).</p>



<p>The biggest point of friction with these frameworks was always how they would integrate with Ruby on Rails. Rails has gone down a different route for it’s sanctioned front-end path – using <a href="https://jasonformat.com/islands-architecture/">Islands Architecture</a>, Stimulus Controllers and other solutions (which are all preferred to Rails previous .rjs syntax).</p>



<p>I’ll be honest: I haven’t spent the time to fully learn this architecture. I can’t criticize it, other than that the code looks <em>weird</em> to me. It does have advantages over JS frameworks, but you’re still writing JS either way.</p>



<p>For most of the past decade, using these popular frameworks in Rails has meant giving up <strong>Server Side Rendering</strong>. In 2021 when I started Hardcover, that one fact alone meant it was out. We knew we’d need to rely on SEO to find new readers and I didn’t want to sacrifice that.</p>



<h3>Enter Next.js</h3>



<p>Right as I was deciding on what framework to use that would allow for SEO + JavaScript, Next.js announced version 9.5  – adding incremental static regeneration and other features that would allow us to render pages with SSR and expire the cache. It sounded perfect.</p>



<p>I setup the initial architecture of Hardcover using Next.js with the pages router, hitting a GraphQL API (Hasura) for getting data, and caching as much as possible using Incremental Static Revalidation. The first load was often a bit slow, but caching helped.</p>



<p>One decision I made during this phase would come back to haunt me: <strong>cache facts on the server, fetch user data in the browser</strong>.</p>



<p>For instance, if you’re viewing a Readers profile, <em>everything</em> we show there would be fetched client-side from our GraphQL API. Our API returns different results depending on your relationship with the reader you’re viewing. Someone can mark a book, list or goal as public, private or only people you follow – which all determine what other readers can see.</p>



<p>This approach left that logic to the API, allowing the front-end to be dumb and just show whatever was returned. It <em>worked</em>.</p>



<p>Behind the scenes we were still using Ruby on Rails for the entire backend. This is what the architecture looked like at the time.</p>

<p>From 2021 to 2022 we continued on building like this. Some pages were getting slower, but we were able to ship fast. We continued innovating, but the app kept getting slower. As more readers joined, we were hitting our API servers <em>hard</em>, and we couldn’t cache anything at that level. If we wanted server side caching, we needed to move that to the server.</p>



<h3>An Wild App Router Appears</h3>



<p>In mid-2022, Next.js launched the App Router – a new way to server side render Next.js apps. I loved the idea. It felt more like Rails which I was used to. We immediately starting migrating Hardcover to this approach.</p>



<p>We switched to fetching all data about facts and users to be fetched on the server using the app directory and React Server Components. This went surprisingly smooth! There were some rough days with next-auth and Apollo to get everything working, but we made it through.</p>



<p>At this point, we used the users API token on the server side to make request to the API –&nbsp;the same token used on the client side. This ensured they would only see data they had access to. In my misunderstanding of Next.js’s caching, I thought those requests would be cached. Since Apollo’s GraphQL requests are POST requests, they weren’t (😱).</p>



<p>Next.js had (has?) no clear tools to understand what was being cached. I could use log statements to debug this, but since Next.js was overriding <code>fetch</code> for their caching, all of my code would be run whether or not it was cached or not.</p>



<p>When the application was migrated from the Pages router to the App router in April 2024, it didn’t speed up as much as I hoped. Now I know it was because the cache wasn’t being used. Back then I didn’t know that. It wasn’t the massive improvement I was hoping for.</p>



<p>Two other things happened around this time that increased our frustration with Next.js and Vercel.</p>



<p>When we moved to the App router, our bill increased – which was anticipated. What we didn’t expect was for a <a href="https://vercel.com/blog/improved-infrastructure-pricing">Pricing Change</a> the month we launched after months of building.</p>



<p>Our hosting bill grew from $30 in April to $142 by June, $354 in August. Hardcover was growing, but 10x cost increase in a few months was too much.</p>



<p>We tried using the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@neshca/cache-handler">@neshca/cache-handler</a> Redis cache handler for Next.js – which did give us the most insight into what was being cached that we’d seen up until that point. However our bill continued to rise.</p>

<p>We migrated to Google Cloud Run to see if it would be cheaper. For the first month or two is was! Our Google Cloud Bills dropped to $311, and then $286. but then continued to climb to $524 in February 2025.</p>



<p><em>Side note: the big orange charge was when someone attempted to download <a href="https://hardcover.app/blog/how-we-survived-10k-requests-second-switching-to-signed-urls" data-type="post" data-id="1801">every image from Google Cloud Storage</a>, which resulted in us moving from Google Cloud Storage to CloudFlare R2.</em></p>



<p>This chart wasn’t looking great if we wanted to reach profitability as a team. Alongside this, our application had gotten significantly slower – both in development and on production. We’d started to using <code>&lt;Suspense&gt;</code> with code splitting for larger JS scripts, but our bundle size wasn’t budging without major changes.</p>



<p>On the local development side things were worse. As new team members joined, I’d have to apologize for how long it would take to load a single page – often up to <em>a minute</em>. That was all compilation time on the Next.js server for our test page.</p>



<p>Next.js must’ve been hearing this same feedback from other developers because they started working on <a href="https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/turbopack">Turbopack</a>, which speeds up compilation. I tried this every month or so, but I was never able to get it to work with Hardcover. I <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rails/comments/1i56kmn/comment/m81aom0/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">hear it’s stable</a> as of the latest version, but we were already deep into the migration by that point.</p>



<p>At this point, we had the following problems with Next.js:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Unclear caching</strong>, which would need a large rewrite to change.</li>



<li><strong>Growing and unpredictable bills</strong> due to serverless architecture</li>



<li><strong>Slow development speeds</strong>, making even small changes take a long time.</li>
</ul>



<p>One additional problem wasn’t Next.js specific, but architecture related: I wanted to switch to getting server side data directly from a database connection rather than through GraphQL. I looked into Prisma, TypeORM and Sequelize to switch.</p>



<p>I had concerns about this approach with a serverless architecture. Our database has a connection limit, which meant we’d need a serverless limit anyways to make sure our database connection pool is sufficient. Either that or move to a cloud database like <a href="https://neon.tech/">Neon</a>, but at our DB size that would be $700/month minimum.</p>



<p>This was a realistic option to speed things up, but the slow development times and higher costs would have continued.</p>



<h2>If Not Next.js, What?</h2>



<p>By August 2024, after 3 years of development with Next.js, I wasn’t optimistic about the issues I’d encountered being addressed. I started looking into alternatives.</p>



<p>My goals for a “better” version were ambitious:</p>



<ul>
<li>Continue to render everything on the server – we need SSR for SEO.</li>



<li>Switch to direct database connection for fetching all data.</li>



<li>Continue to use React.js for the front-end.</li>
</ul>



<p>This led to two real options: Remix or Ruby on Rails. I looked into Remix for about one day before I realized the learning curve was more than I’d be comfortable with for this type of a migration.</p>



<p>When it came to running React with Rails, I found three options:</p>



<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://github.com/reactjs/react-rails">react-rails</a> gem</li>



<li>The <a href="https://github.com/shakacode/react_on_rails">react_on_rails</a> gem</li>



<li>The <a href="https://github.com/inertiajs/inertia-rails">inertia-rails</a> gem</li>
</ul>



<p>I gave each of these a try, building a proof of concept with each. There were parts of each I loved. I think <a href="https://github.com/shakacode/react_on_rails">react_on_rails</a> has the chance at being the fastest of these for the user – but may need the pro version and some support.<br></p>



<h2>Enter Inertia.js</h2>



<p><a href="https://inertiajs.com/">Inertia.js</a> landed in the sweet spot of performance, SSR and just <em>getting out the way</em>. If you follow me on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/adamfortuna.com">BlueSky</a>, you’ve no doubt heard me talking about Inertia over the last few months. 😂</p>



<p>I wasn’t expecting a <a href="https://laravel.com/">Laravel</a> project, which was inspired by Rails, to end up developing something I loved more than The Rails Way. DHH’s software choices have usually been in step with my own (<em>emphasis on software</em>), but we differ when it comes to TypeScript and the front-end. The direction Laravel went with Inertia.js is such a great choice, and I really enjoy building with this paradigm. Here’s how it works in practice:</p>



<p>Before breaking into the individual parts, let’s look at Inertia.js at a high level to get a better idea of what it even does. Here’s how that works in practice for a request – in this example, I’ll use the <a href="https://hardcover.app/">Hardcover homepage</a>.</p>



<p>This page shows a bunch of static data, trending books, a prompt, a Hardcover Live and a few blog posts. All of this data can change whenever, but it makes sense to cache it. Here’s what that entire request looks like:</p>



<h3>A Rails + Inertia.js Request</h3>



<p>At the controller level we do exactly what you’d expect from a Rails application. We have a route which handles this endpoint:</p>



<div>
<p>config/routes.rb</p>


<pre aria-describedby="shcb-language-1" data-shcb-language-name="Ruby" data-shcb-language-slug="ruby"><span><code>Rails.application.routes.draw <span>do</span>
  namespace <span>:clientverse</span>, <span>path:</span> <span>"/"</span> <span>do</span>
    namespace <span>:pages</span>, <span>path:</span> <span>"/"</span> <span>do</span>
      get <span>:home</span>
    <span>end</span>
  <span>end</span>
<span>end</span></code></span><small id="shcb-language-1"><span>Code language:</span> <span>Ruby</span> <span>(</span><span>ruby</span><span>)</span></small></pre></div>



<p>We also scope everything that’s shown to the user under a “clientverse” namespace. That allows us to have a <code>pages_controller.rb</code> which extends from a <code>base_controller.rb</code> for all Inertia.js generated pages.</p>



<p>That <code>base_controller.rb</code> is relatively small.</p>



<div>
<p>app/controllers/clientverse/base_controller.rb</p>


<pre aria-describedby="shcb-language-2" data-shcb-language-name="Ruby" data-shcb-language-slug="ruby"><span><code><span><span>module</span> <span>Clientverse</span></span>
  <span><span>class</span> <span>BaseController</span> &lt; ApplicationController</span>
    <span>include</span> ApplicationHelper
    <span>include</span> ReduxHelper
    <span>include</span> UserHelper
    <span>include</span> ErrorHelper

    before_action <span>:confirm_user</span>
    before_action <span>:confirm_onboarding</span>
    before_bugsnag_notify <span>:add_user_info_to_bugsnag</span>

    helper_method <span>:global_variables</span>
    helper_method <span>:metadata</span>
    helper_method <span>:html_attribute</span>
    helper_method <span>:theme</span>

    inertia_share <span>do</span>
      {
        <span>generatedAt:</span> Time.now.to_i,
        <span>pathName:</span> request.path,
        <span>metadata:</span> default_metadata,
        <span>rootState:</span> root_store,
        <span>userBookStatusMap:</span> InertiaRails.optional { user_books_status_map },
        <span>flash:</span> flash.to_h <span>||</span> {}
      }
    <span>end</span>
  <span>end</span>
<span>end</span></code></span><small id="shcb-language-2"><span>Code language:</span> <span>Ruby</span> <span>(</span><span>ruby</span><span>)</span></small></pre></div>



<p>Most of these helpers aren’t important for this example, but they’ve come in handy. The important one here is the <code>inertia_share</code> call. That allows us to add that data to <em>every</em> Inertia request that comes in. The userBookStatusMap includes the logged in readers status on every book, which we only use that when requested.</p>



<p>The <code>pages_controller.rb</code> extends from this.</p>



<div>
<p>app/controllers/clientverse/pages_controller.rb</p>


<pre aria-describedby="shcb-language-3" data-shcb-language-name="Ruby" data-shcb-language-slug="ruby"><span><code><span><span>module</span> <span>Clientverse</span></span>
  <span><span>class</span> <span>PagesController</span> &lt; BaseController</span>
    <span><span>def</span> <span>home</span></span>
      render <span>inertia:</span> <span>'clientverse/pages/home'</span>, <span>props:</span> home_props
    <span>end</span>

    private

    <span><span>def</span> <span>home_props</span></span>
      Rails.cache.fetch(<span>"pages/home"</span>, <span>expires_in:</span> <span>1</span>.hour) <span>do</span> 
        lives = WordPressService.new.lives(<span>limit:</span> <span>1</span>)
        {
          <span>featuredPrompt:</span> PromptSerializers::PromptSerializer.one(Prompt.find_by(<span>slug:</span> <span>"what-are-your-favorite-books-of-all-time"</span>)),
          <span>trendingBooks:</span> BookSerializers::BookBylineSerializer.many(TrendingBookService.<span>for</span>(<span>start_date:</span> <span>1</span>.month.ago, <span>limit:</span> <span>12</span>)),
          <span>live:</span> lives.empty? ? <span>nil</span> : WordPressSerializers::LiveSerializer.one(lives.first),
          <span>posts:</span> WordPressSerializers::PostSerializer.many(WordPressService.new.posts(<span>limit:</span> <span>3</span>)),
          <span>metadata:</span> default_metadata
        }
      <span>end</span>
    <span>end</span>
  <span>end</span>
<span>end</span></code></span><small id="shcb-language-3"><span>Code language:</span> <span>Ruby</span> <span>(</span><span>ruby</span><span>)</span></small></pre></div>



<p>When the root <code>/</code> route is accessed, this <code>home</code> method will be called. That will render the React.js component at <code>clientverse/pages/home.tsx</code> passing in the props returned from <code>home_props</code>.</p>



<p>The entire props are wrapped in a <code>Rails.cache.fetch</code> block. This decade (+) old feature of Rails still feels like magic. It’ll check the cache (in our case Solid Cache stored in Postgres) for the cache key “pages/home” within the expiration. If it exists, it’ll return that and <strong>never run the code in the block</strong>.</p>



<p>If that cache key doesn’t exist, or it’s past the expiration date, it’ll run the code, save it to cache and return it.</p>



<p><strong>The end result is that loading the entire homepage only takes one query</strong> (if you’re logged out). This makes it super quick.</p>



<p>Ok, we know what to render for this specific page. But we need a place to render this! For that we use what you’d expect for any Rails app: the <code>app/views/application_layout.html.erb</code> file.</p>



<div>
<p><code>app/views/application_layout.html.erb</code></p>


<pre aria-describedby="shcb-language-4" data-shcb-language-name="Ruby" data-shcb-language-slug="ruby"><span><code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;

    &lt;%= vite_stylesheet_tag "application" %&gt;
    &lt;%= vite_react_refresh_tag %&gt;
  &lt;/head</span>&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;%= <span>yield</span> %&gt;
  &lt;<span>/body&gt;
&lt;/html</span>&gt;</code></span><small id="shcb-language-4"><span>Code language:</span> <span>Ruby</span> <span>(</span><span>ruby</span><span>)</span></small></pre></div>



<p>This file still feels a bit magical to me. There are CSRF protection, hot module reloading, SSR hacks, and other custom scripts to work with React.</p>



<p>I expected to need a root element here, but that’s not the case. The entire page you render will be filled into the <code>&lt;%= yield %&gt;</code> section.</p>



<p>For what shows up there, that’s the file we rendered from the&nbsp;controller, in this case <code>app/javascript/pages/clientverse/pages/home.tsx</code>. Here’s what that looks like for us:</p>



<div>
<p><code>app/javascript/pages/clientverse/pages/home.tsx</code>.</p>


<pre aria-describedby="shcb-language-5" data-shcb-language-name="TypeScript" data-shcb-language-slug="typescript"><span><code><span>import</span> Hero <span>from</span> <span>"components/marketing/home/Hero"</span>;

      &lt;TrackBooks /&gt;

      &lt;div className=<span>"h-6"</span> /&gt;

      &lt;AdditionalSections /&gt;

}

export default HomeIndex;
</span></code></span><small id="shcb-language-5"><span>Code language:</span> <span>TypeScript</span> <span>(</span><span>typescript</span><span>)</span></small></pre></div>



<p>That DefaultLayoutWrapper is doing a lot of work of wrapping the the entire application. We have that code in almost every root page shown. This is one area of Inertia.js I haven’t found a good solution for. According to the docs, it’s supposed to be possible to set a default layout, but I haven’t gotten that to work (yet).</p>



<p>We’ve found it’s helpful to create a Type for everything that’s passed into React for each request as well. This could use <a href="https://github.com/ElMassimo/oj_serializers">Oj Serializers</a> (my preferred serialization library), or written by hand. I prefer written by hand, that way the <code>home.props.ts</code> file can live right next to the <code>home.tsx</code> file.</p>



<div>
<p>app/javascript/pages/home.props.ts</p>


<pre aria-describedby="shcb-language-6" data-shcb-language-name="TypeScript" data-shcb-language-slug="typescript"><span><code><span>import</span> BlogPostType, { BlogLiveType } <span>from</span> <span>"types/BlogPostType"</span>;

<span>type</span> HomeProps = {
  featuredPrompt: PromptSerializersPrompt;

<p>Side note: We use the Ruby <a href="https://github.com/ElMassimo/types_from_serializers">types_from_serializers</a> gem to generate TypeScript types for all serializers. That allows us to set a type in a serializer and see it across the entire stack. 🤯 I owe <a href="https://github.com/ElMassimo">Máximo Mussini</a> big for how much time this has saved (and he wrote <a href="https://github.com/ElMassimo/vite_ruby">vite_ruby</a> too! A real Ruby Hero).</p>



<p>In this component we’re not actually accepting any of these props! We passed them, but we didn’t use them. We can use them wherever we need them. For example, in the <code>&lt;TrendingBooks /&gt;</code> component:</p>



<div>
<p>app/javascript/components/marketing/home/TrendingBooks</p>


<pre aria-describedby="shcb-language-7" data-shcb-language-name="TypeScript" data-shcb-language-slug="typescript"><span><code><span>import</span> { usePage } <span>from</span> <span>"@inertiajs/react"</span>;
<span>import</span> BookTrendingGroup <span>from</span> <span>"components/BookGroup/groups/BookTrendingGroup"</span>;
<span>import</span> { BookTrendingContextType } <span>from</span> <span>"components/BookGroup/types"</span>;
<span>import</span> Container <span>from</span> <span>"hardcover-ui/components/Container"</span>;
<span>import</span> HomeProps <span>from</span> <span>"pages/clientverse/pages/home.props"</span>;

<span>const</span> context: BookTrendingContextType = {
  link: <span>"/trending/recent"</span>,
  duration: <span>"90day"</span>,
};

<span>export</span> <span>default</span> <span><span>function</span> <span>TrendingBooks</span>(<span></span>) </span>{
  <span>const</span> { trendingBooks } = usePage&lt;HomeProps&gt;().props;
  <span>if</span> (trendingBooks.length === <span>0</span>) {
    <span>return</span> <span>false</span>;
  }

  <span>return</span> (
    &lt;Container size=<span>"md"</span> variant=<span>"layout"</span> className=<span>"mt-12 overflow-hidden"</span>&gt;
      &lt;BookTrendingGroup size=<span>"lg"</span> books={trendingBooks} context={context} /&gt;
    &lt;<span>/Container&gt;
  );
}
</span></code></span><small id="shcb-language-7"><span>Code language:</span> <span>TypeScript</span> <span>(</span><span>typescript</span><span>)</span></small></pre></div>



<p>The <code>usePage</code> hook will grab that argument from the passed in props at the highest level and use them. The same can be done in our Layout page to get the users data, like when we show the current users avatar when logged in.</p>



<p>This covers most of the render cycle. The one missing piece is the entry point – that <code>application.tsx</code> script included in the layout. This script gave me some of the most headaches, so I’m going to include our exact one here in case it helps someone else.</p>



<div>
<p>app/javascript/entrypoints/application.tsx</p>


<pre aria-describedby="shcb-language-8" data-shcb-language-name="TypeScript" data-shcb-language-slug="typescript"><span><code><span>// Add this polyfill to fix a warning with Redux</span>

<p>This will make every page available and render it. In production, we set the VITE_SSR variable, which switches this to hydrate mode. Just ignore the <code>unknown as any</code> statement. 😂</p>



<p>If you’ve had success with other solutions here, I’d love to chat.</p>



<h3>The Vite Server</h3>



<p>Inertia works extremely well with Vite. In our case, we have a separate Vite process that runs a Vite server locally. Here’s our local <code>docker-compose.yml</code> file for this.</p>

<p>Combined that with a production Docker image that runs <code>VITE_SSR</code>=”true” <code>./bin/vite build --ssr</code> on deploy, and we only need to generate the main assets once.</p>



<p>This setup allows the Rails server to talk to the Vite server to get what it needs. Sometimes that’s generating a page using SSR, other could mean just providing the CSS and JS needed to run the page.</p>



<p>Similar to any Rails Application, we set an asset host which all JS and CSS goes through ( <code>config.asset_host = "https://static.hardcover.app"</code> ). This host is cached at the CloudFlare level with long-expiration dates.</p>



<p>You might also notice the <code>RUN_MIGRATIONS</code> part there. That’s used within our <code>bin/docker-entrypoint</code> script to determine which server runs migrations – which only needs to happen on one server.</p>



<div>
<p>bin/docker-entrypoint</p>

<p>I don’t love this, but it works. We have a staging one that’s pretty similar. I suspect there would be better ways to send over the VITE public variables. I compile the docker image and upload it as part of a Kamal release using the command:</p>


<pre><span><code>kamal deploy build --push -d production</code></span></pre>


<p>I switched to to a Makefile command and added deployment to it.</p>



<div>
<p>Makefile</p>


<pre aria-describedby="shcb-language-13" data-shcb-language-name="CSS" data-shcb-language-slug="css"><span><code># <span>.PHONY</span>: <span>deploy</span>

</code></span><small id="shcb-language-13"><span>Code language:</span> <span>CSS</span> <span>(</span><span>css</span><span>)</span></small></pre></div>



<p>With this, I can run <code>make</code> or <code>make deploy</code> to deploy the app to production, or <code>make deploy-staging </code>to send my local workspace there.</p>



<p>Since this upload happens from my computer rather than a post commit hook, it does need to be run locally. Eventually I’ll move this to a GitHub action.</p>



<h2>Still Room For Improvement</h2>



<p>This setup isn’t perfect. There are a few parts that still are a little rough around the edges.</p>



<p>As I mentioned earlier, I haven’t successfully gotten <strong><a href="https://inertia-rails.dev/guide/pages#default-layouts">shared layouts</a></strong> to work. That does mean each request will re-rendering the entire page – not just the subparts relevant to the current route. That was OK for us, since most route changes are an entire page update. It does mean the header/footer get re-rendered. This happens client-side, so it’s not a full page reload, just a content reload. It’s more of a React component re-render than a full reload.</p>



<p><strong>SSR mode</strong> has been tough to debug. I haven’t found a way to easily get it running without doing a full compile, setting a bunch of variables and reproducing production. This makes debugging SSR hydration errors on productions tricky.</p>



<p>There’s <strong>limited documentation</strong> for Inertia.js and especially Ruby on Rails with Inertia. The <a href="https://inertia-rails.dev/">Inertia Rails gem docs</a> are AMAZING and did handle just about all of my questions. Sometimes it’s tricky to understand if a problem is in Rails, Inertia-Rails, Inertia.js, React.js or Vite. The Inertia.js Discord has been GREAT. Each time I’ve asked a question I’ve had an answer within minutes (which were always my problem, not a framework issue).</p>



<p>Switching from using <strong>Promises</strong> to control <code><strong>Suspense</strong></code> layers to <code>InertiaRails.optional</code> with <code>import { Deferred } from '@inertiajs/react'</code> has felt a bit weird. It’s effectively the same, but it’s the React Way. I guess I’m already abandoning the Ruby Way, so I can’t be dogmatic about the React Way either. 😅</p>



<h2>Railsy React</h2>



<p>What I love about this setup is that I’m able to generate everything using familiar Ruby and Rails tools, and then use React.js for the entire front-end. There’s a lot I didn’t have to do. There’s no React Router, since it uses the Ruby on Rails Router. In our case, we just needed to change from using <code>next/link</code> to <code>import { Link } from '@inertiajs/react'</code> and it just worked.</p>



<p>I’m excited to use the <code>InertiaRails.optional</code> feature more. For example, on a Book Page we could send down all information about the book immediately (from a cache), then generate everything user-specific and send that down later. This is the Inertia.js equivalent of a streaming response. It’s managed by JS, so it wouldn’t quite by Streaming SSR (which is handled by the server), but it’s close. If you’re only using it for non-SEO data (as we are) then it effectively the same.</p>



<p>One thing we’re not doing is hitting our Rails API directly from the front-end (except in a few Devise-related cases). We have a Hasura GraphQL API that handles most requests. This means we’re not leveraging many other wonderful Inertia.js options – forms, flashes, file uploads and many other things that begin with F.</p>

<p>This is where we’re headed to from an infrastructure level. We’re not quite there yet, but we’re close!</p>



<h2>How’d This Change Impact Hardcover?</h2>



<p>We deployed this migration from Next.js to Rails on March 18, 2025. I’d already setup all the servers, making for an easier migration than I expected. We’ve had a bunch of bugs I’ve been working on, but that’ll be fixed in time.</p>



<p>Almost immediately Google stated showing Hardcover to more readers. That was a sudden, and welcomed surprise.</p>

<p>That was likely because of our increased Google Pagespeed score.</p>

<p>This was <em>considerably</em> faster than Next.js (I should’ve taken a screenshot before!). The Total Blocking Time was usually over one second – which was one part we couldn’t seem to improve. When we moved from Vercel to Google Cloud Run that Total Blocking time even went up a bit – likely because of Vercel’s distributed cloud (I think?). Seeing this go down has been amazing. 🤯</p>



<p>We’re still figuring out how these changes impact readers. As we fix bugs, the site is becoming more stable and just <em>fun to use</em>. Over the last few days we’ve seen visit duration spike to almost 6 minutes – up from 3 minutes. It’s too soon to see if this is a long-term trend, but it’s nice to see this move in that direction.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/1019217/">https://lwn.net/Articles/1019217/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43880068">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>
Just over six months ago, The Economist described the US economy as "<a href="https://www.economist.com/special-report/2024-10-19">the envy of the
world</a>".  That headline would be unlikely to appear now.  The economic
boom referenced in that article feels like a distant memory, markets are
falling, and uncertainty is at an all-time high.  Like everybody else, LWN
is affected by the current turbulence in the political and economic
spheres; we expect to get through this period, but there will be some
challenges.
</p><p>
To put it bluntly: starting around the beginning of March, we have observed
a distinct drop in both new subscriptions and renewals.  That timing
roughly corresponds with the US administration's increasing attacks on the
global system of trade and the economic downturn that has been its result.
As it stands, this subscription drop does not pose an existential threat to
LWN — or to the salaries of its writers — but it is a matter of concern.
</p><p>
We are responding by tightening our belt where we can, but otherwise
working to provide the best coverage of the Linux and free-software
communities, as we always have.  Readers can help, of course, by <a href="https://lwn.net/subscribe/">subscribing</a> if they have not already done so.
Encouraging your employer to set up a <a href="https://lwn.net/op/CorporateSubscriptions.lwn">group subscription</a> is especially
helpful.  Subscriptions are the only thing that has kept LWN operating for
all these years.
</p><p>
Beyond the immediate situation, there are a number of potential problems to
be concerned about.  For example, inflation did not stop after our price
increase in 2022, with the result that subscription dollars buy
significantly less then they once did.  We are <i>not</i> considering a
price increase at this time but, if the situation worsens, we may have to
go there.
</p><p>
For better or worse, LWN is a US-based company, but a large portion of
our subscription sales come from outside the country.  If the backlash
against US companies grows, we are unlikely to escape its effects entirely.
Further attacks on global trade could make it more difficult for us to
accept payments from outside the country, even when the buyer is willing.
In a truly terrible world, there may be attempts to reduce US participation
in (and support for) free software; the probability of that seems low, but
not zero.
</p><p>
Those are all future worries, though. For now, we will focus on getting
through the current economic storms.  The good news is that LWN has been
here since 1998, which is long enough to have been through more than one
difficult cycle.  We are still here, thanks entirely to the steady support
from you, our readers.  Our subscribers, especially, have our gratitude; if
you have not yet subscribed to LWN, please consider doing so now.
</p><p>
Meanwhile our primary focus will remain being worthy of the support you all
have given us since the beginning.  It is the least we can do for all of
you who have made our existence possible for the last 27&nbsp;years.<br clear="all"></p><hr>

<p dir="auto">The source code release of <strong>QModem 4.51</strong>, an MS-DOS telecommunications program authored by John Friel III (1960–2024). This source snapshot reflects the state of QModem "Test-Drive" edition, version 4.51, as it existed in early 1992. The release is presented in the hope it may prove valuable as a historical artifact, for telecommunications enthusiasts, retrocomputing hobbyists, or anyone interested in the inner workings of a classic DOS comms package.</p>
<p dir="auto">QModem was a widely-used terminal communications program for MS-DOS, supporting a rich array of modem protocols, scripting, user customization, modem auto-configuration, and even a "Host Mode" for basic BBS-like operation.</p>

<p dir="auto"><strong>QModem</strong> was developed throughout the 1980s and early 1990s as a competitor to programs such as Procomm, Telix, and others. It provided robust support for:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Many modem speeds and hardware types (8250, 16450, 16550 UARTs, and special hardware)</li>
<li>Internal and external file transfer protocols: XMODEM, YMODEM, ZMODEM, and user-defined protocol support via external drivers</li>
<li>Full-screen dialing directory (the <code>.FON</code> phonebook)</li>
<li>Extensive scripting and automation via its built-in script language</li>
<li>In-program configuration via a full-featured setup menu (<code>Alt-N</code>)</li>
<li>ANSI/VT100/TTY/Avatar terminal emulations</li>
<li>Host Mode: a mini BBS server included in the client!</li>
<li>Scrollback buffer, split screen terminal</li>
<li>Mouse support, custom keyboard macros, and more</li>

<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Turbo Pascal 5.5/6.0</strong> (MS-DOS or DOSBox): This is almost certainly the original toolchain. If you have a copy, opening <code>QMODEM.PAS</code> as the project and compiling (after possibly setting appropriate memory and overlay paths) may work. Some makefiles or batch files, e.g. <code>BUILD.BAT</code>, may be helpful, but will need adaptation to your environment.</p>

<li><strong>No supported modern environment</strong> targets this code directly. Efforts to port or run on anything but MS-DOS/Turbo Pascal 5.x/6.x are purely experimental and will require code and/or dependency adaptation.</li>
<li><strong>Third-party libraries</strong> (Turbo Professional, OpKey, possibly others) are required.</li>
<li><strong>Hardware-dependence</strong>: Much code assumes direct access to PC hardware, BIOS, and serial port interrupts.</li>
<li><strong>Overlay management</strong>: The overlay system (<code>OVERLAY.PAS</code>, etc.) must be supported as originally intended.</li>

<p dir="auto">ANEMLL (pronounced like "animal") is an open-source project focused on accelerating the porting of Large Language Models (LLMs) to tensor processors, starting with the Apple Neural Engine (ANE).</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Goals</h2><a id="user-content-goals" aria-label="Permalink: Goals" href="#goals"></a></p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">The goal is to provide a fully open-source pipeline from model conversion to inference for common LLM architectures running on ANE.
This enables seamless integration and on-device inference for low-power applications on edge devices, ensuring maximum privacy and security.
This is critical for autonomous applications, where models run directly on the device without requiring an internet connection.</p>
<p dir="auto">We aim to:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Provide flexible and easy to use library/framework to port LLMs to ANE directly from Hugging Face models</li>
<li>Provide on-device examples for iOS and macOS swift or C/C++ Applications</li>
</ul>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/05/02/1116059/the-us-approves-crispr-pigs-for-food/">https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/05/02/1116059/the-us-approves-crispr-pigs-for-food/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43879288">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <p>The pigs will join a very<strong> </strong>short list of gene-modified animals that you can eat.<strong> </strong>It’s a short list because such animals are expensive to create, face regulatory barriers, and don’t always pay off. For instance, the US took about 20 years to approve a transgenic salmon with an extra gene that let it grow faster. But by early this year its creator, AquaBounty, had sold off all its fish farms and had only four employees—none of them selling fish.</p>  <p>Regulations have eased since then, especially around gene editing, which tinkers with an animal’s own DNA rather than adding to it from another species, as is the case with the salmon and many GMO crops.</p> 
</div><div> <p>What’s certain is that the pig project was technically impressive and scientifically clever. Genus edited pig embryos to remove the receptor that the PRRS virus uses to enter cells. No receptor means no infection. </p>  <p>According to Matt Culbertson, chief operating office of the Pig Improvement Company, a Genus subsidiary, the pigs appear entirely immune to more than 99% of the known versions of the PRRS virus, although there is one rare subtype that may break through the protection.</p> 
 <p>This project is scientifically similar to the work that led to <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2018/11/25/138962/exclusive-chinese-scientists-are-creating-crispr-babies/">the infamous CRISPR babies</a> born in China in 2018. In that case a scientist named He Jiankui edited twin girls to be resistant to HIV, also by trying to remove a receptor gene when they were just embryos in a dish.</p>  <p>That experiment on humans was widely decried as misguided. But pigs are a different story. The ethical concerns about experimenting are less serious, and the benefits of changing the genomes can be measured in dollars and cents. It’s going to save a lot of money if pigs are immune to the PRRS virus, which spreads quite easily, causing losses of $300 million a year or more in the US alone.</p>  <p>Globally, people get animal protein mostly from chickens, with pigs and cattle in second and third place. A<a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11016693/"> 2023 report</a> estimated that pigs account for 34% of all meat that’s eaten. Of the billion pigs in the world, about half are in China; the US comes in a distant second, with 80 million.</p>  <p>Recently, there’s been a lot of fairly silly news about genetically modified animals. A company called Colossal Biosciences used gene editing to modify wolves in ways it claimed made them resemble an extinct species, the <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/04/08/1114371/game-of-clones-colossals-new-wolves-are-cute-but-are-they-dire/">dire wolf</a>. And then there’s the L.A. Project, an effort run by biohackers who say they’ll make <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/your-next-pet-could-be-a-glowing-rabbit-los-angeles-project-gene-editing-crispr/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.wired.com/story/your-next-pet-could-be-a-glowing-rabbit-los-angeles-project-gene-editing-crispr/">glow-in-the-dark rabbits</a> and have a stretch goal of creating a horse with a horn—that’s right, a unicorn.</p> </div><div><p>Both those projects are more about showmanship than usefulness. But they’re demonstrations of the growing power scientists have to modify mammals, thanks principally to new gene-editing tools combined with DNA sequencing that lets them peer into animals’ DNA.</p></div><div><p>Stopping viruses is a much better use of CRISPR. And research is ongoing to make pigs—as well as other livestock—invulnerable to other infections, including African swine fever and influenza. While PRRS doesn’t infect humans, pig and bird flus can. But if herds and flocks could be changed to resist those infections, that could cut the chances of the type of spillover that can occasionally cause dangerous pandemics.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>  <p>There’s a chance the Genus pigs could turn out to be the most financially valuable genetically modified animal ever created—the first CRISPR hit product to reach the food system. After the approval, the company’s stock value jumped up by a couple of hundred million dollars on the London Stock Exchange.</p>  <p>But there is still a way to go before gene-edited bacon appears on shelves in the US. Before it makes its sales pitch to pig farms, Genus says, it needs to also gain approval in Mexico, Canada, Japan and China which are big export markets for American pork.</p>  <p>Culbertson says gene-edited pork could appear in the US market sometime next year. He says the company does not think pork chops or other meat will need to carry any label identifying it as bioengineered. "We aren't aware of any labelling requirement," Culbertson says.</p>  <p><em>This article is from The Checkup,&nbsp;</em>MIT Technology Review<em>’s weekly health and biotech newsletter.

It's now been a full 12 months without writing a check, marking the longest hiatus in my angel "career." </p><p><span>There isn't enough transparency in angel investing, and my past </span><a href="https://www.halletecco.com/blog/angel-investing-part-1" rel="">posts</a><span> on the topic have been reader favorites. So I decided to share why I stepped back from angel investing after backing 54 companies and what I'm doing instead. </span><em>Next week, I'll follow up with the cold, hard data on my portfolio performance.</em></p><p>A few years ago, people were trying to convince me to raise a fund. There was a lot of money going around for emerging fund managers, and I had enough of a track record to make a reasonable VC. I thought seriously about the opportunity and what it would mean for me personally and professionally. I talked to potential partners and colleagues. I did the math on what size fund we’d need to raise. </p><p>During this exercise, I reflected on why I began angel investing in the first place:</p><ol><li><p><strong>For fun</strong><span>: I </span><em>really</em><span> enjoyed working with founders</span></p></li><li><p><strong>To learn</strong><span>: I wanted the unparalleled opportunity of being at the forefront of innovation and trends</span></p></li><li><p><strong>For the money:</strong><span> I liked investing, and I wanted to put my money to work </span></p></li></ol><p><span>Ultimately, I decided running a VC fund was </span><em>not</em><span> how I wanted to spend my time. In fact, I realized I didn’t even want to spend my time angel investing anymore. Through this exercise, it became clear to me that there were better ways to achieve those goals.</span></p><p>Angel investing follows basic portfolio theory principles—each individual investment carries extreme risk, so you need to build a diverse portfolio. The standard advice is that you need 20-30 investments minimum to have a statistically viable chance of finding a company that returns your entire fund.</p><p>But it’s this same diversification that spreads you too thin. My portfolio became too broad to meaningfully support. I couldn't provide the kind of value that initially drew me to angel investing: working closely with founders to help them succeed.</p><p>What started as a few hours a month quickly grew into a full-time (unpaid) job. When you back 50+ companies, even minor requests add up on a daily basis:</p><ul><li><p>One company needs you to help close a key hire</p></li><li><p>Another is raising a bridge round and wants your input on the deck</p></li><li><p>A third is struggling with a co-founder conflict and needs advice</p></li><li><p>An investor calls asking you to vouch for a portfolio company they’re considering backing</p></li></ul><p>All this happens while new pitches continue to flood your inbox. The result was increasingly shallow interactions with more and more companies, exactly the opposite of what drew me to angel investing in the first place.</p><p>When I started angel investing, one of my primary motivations was to learn. I convinced myself that being on cap tables would give me special insight and keep me current in the industry.</p><p>But when I really thought about it, I realized that angel investing provides surprisingly limited learning opportunities compared to other outlets. Following industry news, hosting a podcast, teaching, writing a book, starting companies, attending conferences, having coffee with founders (without the pressure to invest), and joining advisory boards were equally, if not more, effective ways to learn about the industry.</p><p>I still believe there’s something ✨ magical ✨ you soak in working alongside founders. I just don’t think investing is the only way to get that experience. In fact, I've found that advisory roles and board positions often provide deeper insights than passive investing because you're more actively involved. The reality is that most angel investors get sanitized quarterly updates (if that), which barely scratch the surface of what's really happening in a company. When you're more deeply engaged—even without a financial stake—you get to see the unfiltered challenges and strategic decisions that drive real learning.</p><p>The math simply stopped mathing – especially when weighed against my other priorities.</p><p>Unlike VCs, who are compensated for their work through management fees, angels do it for free while also taking 100% of the financial risk. </p><p>Angel investors also face the longest time horizon for liquidity of any investor. Private equity aims for 3-5 year returns, and VCs typically run 7-10 year fund cycles, but angels usually wait 10+ years for exits. This means angels aren’t just taking company-specific risk, but also the risk of facing more macroeconomic cycles.</p><p>Think about all that's happened since 2009 when I started: multiple presidential administrations, a global pandemic, zero interest rates, and now high inflation and higher interest rates. My investments have had to withstand all of these shifts, and many didn't make it through.</p><p>The post-ZIRP era (2023-2024) created headwinds that even well-positioned startups struggled to navigate. Just since 2023, I have had:</p><ul><li><p><span>One company that raised over $100M, with my shares at one point valued at over $1M on paper, acquired in a fire sale that returned </span><em>zero</em><span> to early investors</span></p></li><li><p>Two others that were also “acquired” with some fanfare in the media, but returned nothing to early investors</p></li><li><p>Four companies shut down after being unable to get to profitability or fundraise</p></li><li><p>Four others that raised money but with painful recapitalizations that effectively wiped out early shareholders</p></li></ul><p>That last bullet was the nail in the coffin for me. For new investors to come in and wipe out early investors just because the market was in their favor was painful. It felt like opportunistic resets that enriched later investors at the expense of early supporters (not to mention early employees).</p><p>It’s also worth noting I've made more money building companies than I have investing in them. Some of that is luck, but founding a company provides something angel investing doesn't: the ability to directly influence outcomes.</p><p>When you account for the opportunity cost of capital, the extreme time horizon, the macro risks, and the possibility of having your ownership severely diluted, the potential returns need to be astronomical to justify the investment. And as my portfolio data shows (which I'll share next week), those returns simply aren’t materializing at the rate needed to offset these risks.</p><p>So what's filling the startup-shaped hole in my life now that I've stopped writing angel checks? I've pivoted to approaches that better align with my original goals:</p><p><em><strong>Depth over breadth</strong></em><br><span>For deeper founder relationships, I joined the board of growth-stage company </span><a href="https://collectivehealth.com/" rel="">Collective Health</a><span>, a startup we invested in over a decade ago at Rock Health. I also helped start </span><a href="http://cofertility.com/" rel="">Cofertility</a><span>, where I serve as Board Chair. </span></p><p><em><strong>Learning out loud</strong></em><br><span>For continued learning, I'm doing all the fun things like hosting a podcast and writing this newsletter/blog. I also teach two courses a year, one at Columbia Business School and one virtually at Harvard Medical School. As Phil Collins said, “In learning, you will teach, and in teaching, you will learn.”  </span></p><p><em><strong><span>Professional capital deployment</span><br></strong></em><span>Lastly, I became a Limited Partner (LP) in a handful of VC funds, basically paying professionals to do the investing on our behalf. It's been three years, so it's still early, but it will be interesting to see if the VC returns are better than direct investing. </span></p><p>I haven't closed the door permanently on angel investing, but any return would look different from my previous approach. For now, I'm enjoying the clarity that comes from a more concentrated focus. Sometimes the best investment decision is deciding not to invest at all.</p><p><em>Next week, I'll share the complete data on my 54 startup investments over 15 years</em><span>—</span><em>including returns, losses, and current portfolio status. </em></p><p data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.halletecco.com/blog/why-i-stopped-angel-investing&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Read on my blog&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a href="https://www.halletecco.com/blog/why-i-stopped-angel-investing" rel=""><span>Read on my blog</span></a></p><p>Health insurance has a Net Promoter Score (NPS) of around 0-10 industry-wide, one of the lowest ratings of any industry.

          <p>A <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5219933">new study</a> analyzing the Danish labor market in 2023 and 2024 suggests that generative AI models like <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/11/chatgpt-was-the-spark-that-lit-the-fire-under-generative-ai-one-year-ago-today/">ChatGPT</a> have had almost no significant impact on overall wages or employment yet, despite rapid adoption in some workplaces. The findings, detailed in a <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5219933">working paper</a> by economists from the University of Chicago and the University of Copenhagen, provide an early, large-scale empirical look at AI's transformative potential.</p>
<p>In "Large Language Models, Small Labor Market Effects," economists <a href="https://www.andershumlum.com/">Anders Humlum</a> and <a href="https://www.economics.ku.dk/staff/phd_kopi/?pure=en/persons/655200">Emilie Vestergaard</a> focused specifically on the impact of AI chatbots across 11 occupations often considered vulnerable to automation, including accountants, software developers, and customer support specialists. Their analysis covered data from 25,000 workers and 7,000 workplaces in Denmark.</p>
<p>Despite finding widespread and often employer-encouraged adoption of these tools, the study concluded that "AI chatbots have had no significant impact on earnings or recorded hours in any occupation" during the period studied. The confidence intervals in their statistical analysis ruled out average effects larger than 1 percent.</p>
<p>"The adoption of these chatbots has been remarkably fast," Humlum told <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/04/29/generative_ai_no_effect_jobs_wages/">The Register</a> about the study. "Most workers in the exposed occupations have now adopted these chatbots... But then when we look at the economic outcomes, it really has not moved the needle."</p>
<h2>AI creating more work?</h2>
<p>During the study, the researchers investigated how company investment in AI affected worker adoption and how chatbots changed workplace processes. While corporate investment boosted AI tool adoption—saving time for 64 to 90 percent of users across studied occupations—the actual benefits were less substantial than expected.</p>
<p>The study revealed that AI chatbots actually created new job tasks for 8.4 percent of workers, including some who did not use the tools themselves, offsetting potential time savings. For example, many teachers now spend time detecting whether students use ChatGPT for homework, while other workers review AI output quality or attempt to craft effective prompts.</p>

<p>I’m obsessed with this basic web need. </p>



<p>You’ve got three pages:</p>



<ul>
<li>index.html</li>



<li>about.html</li>



<li>contact.html</li>
</ul>



<p>You need to put <strong>the same</strong> header on all three pages. </p>



<p>Our developer brains scream at us to ensure that we’re not copying the exact code three times, we’re creating the header <strong>once<em> </em></strong>then “including” it on the three (or a thousand) other pages.</p>

<h2>There are so many solutions to this problem</h2>



<p>We don’t need to list them all here. I <a href="https://css-tricks.com/the-simplest-ways-to-handle-html-includes/">documented <em>some</em> of them</a> one time, but there are many more. </p>



<p>We’ve got JavaScript to go <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch">fetch</a> the HTML and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/insertAdjacentElement">insert</a> it. We’ve got <a href="https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/howto/ssi.html">old school web server directives</a>. Any <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/includes/">static site generator</a> can do it. <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-include">Task runners</a> can do it. <a href="https://handlebarsjs.com/guide/partials.html">Templating languages</a> tend to have include functionality. Any <a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.include.php">backend language</a> can generate HTML on the fly. I’ve seen several <a href="https://www.keithcirkel.co.uk/i-html/">Web Components</a> purpose-built for this. We’ve got <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code>, which technically is a pure HTML solution, but they are bad for overall performance, accessibility, and generally extremely awkward here, but we <a href="https://www.filamentgroup.com/lab/html-includes/#another-demo%3A-including-another-html-file">can extract them</a>. We can just not worry about includes at all and trust our code editors powerful find and replace tools.</p>



<h2>But none of the solutions is HTML</h2>



<p>None of these are a straightforward HTML tag. None of these are just some HTML way of saying “go get this HTML and put it here”, like <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> is for “go get this image and put it here. </p>



<h2>Why?</h2>



<p>No, really, <em>why?</em></p>



<p>CSS can import CSS. JavaScript can import JavaScript. HTML cannot import HTML.</p>



<p>I’m sure there are reasons. Normally, web standards and browsers are all about “paving the cowpaths”, that is, providing solutions around what developers are already doing. We were reaching for third-party JavaScript to help with dates, so <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Temporal">the web platform stepped in</a>. We were using frameworks for page transitions, so <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/View_Transition_API">the web platform stepped in</a>. We used libraries for positioning elements next to each other safely, so <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_anchor_positioning">the web platform stepped in</a>. There are countless examples like this.</p>



<p>I’d wager (counts fingers) pretty much <em>all</em> websites need this ability, and all of them reach for different additional non-web-standard tooling to get it done. That’s <em>weird</em>.</p>



<p>So what are those reasons?</p>



<ul>
<li>Does it wreck the <a href="https://web.dev/articles/preload-scanner">preload scanner</a>? As in, it could have very bad web performance issues?</li>



<li>Would it have to be async and thus have issues with jerky/shifty loading experiences?</li>



<li>Does it introduce some kind of complexity that harms the purity of HTML or something?</li>



<li>Is it the difficulty of handling nested includes? Circular includes?</li>



<li>Is it pushback from web hosting that a feature like this would increase web requests dramatically?</li>



<li>Would the restrictions be too strict to make it useful? Like for whatever reason it’s cool to load images and CSS and JS from other domains, but HTML would likely be restricted.</li>



<li>Is there something problematic about the idea that I haven’t listed here?</li>



<li>Is there actually no real desire for this and I’m just a weirdo thinking there is?</li>
</ul>



<p>If anyone has been a part of these discussions or knows exactly why this is, or you just have general thoughts, leave a comment!</p>
