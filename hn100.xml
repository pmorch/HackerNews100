<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Imagine this scenario: You get pulled over by a robot cop. The robot immediately terminates your driver's license <i>forever</i> for driving an 18-wheeler without proper certification. You point to the Mini Cooper you were driving when the robot pulled you over. The robot ignores you.</p><p>Eventually, a different robot shows up, listens to your defense, sees the Mini Cooper, and watches you start the car with your own keys. There is no 18-wheeler in sight. The new robot says it will get back to you in 5 business days.</p><p>Two weeks go by, and a third different robot tells you your appeal has been denied for "driving in such a way that creates a negative experience for other drivers". All the stuff about 18-wheeler certification is never mentioned or acknowledged again.</p><p>You appeal again and again. All your appeals are heard by yet more robots, who always uphold the original robot's decision, regurgitating the same bland phrase about creating a negative driving experience. THE END</p><p>This is basically what has happened to me with Amazon's KDP. I published my paperback through Ingram Spark and my Kindle eBook through KDP. My eBook passed review and was for sale for a few days. I claimed the paperback on my author central page, where it appeared side by side with the Kindle version. I was told to wait a week and the two versions should link up automatically (so they appear as the same book). If not, I should send an email to Amazon support.</p><p>Then the eBook was blocked, and a day later I got this in an email from KDP's Content Review Team:</p><p>&gt; During our review, we found that the following book(s) creates a misleading customer experience by impairing customers' ability to make good buying decisions.</p><p>&gt; Land Without a Continent: A Road Trip through Mexico and Central America</p><p>&gt; Items that can cause a misleading customer experience include:</p><pre><code>  - Similarity of the contributor name to another author
  - Similarity of the title to a previously published book
  - Similarity of the cover to a previously published book
  - Cover text or images that do not accurately represent the contents of the book
  - Title or subtitle that do not accurately represent the contents of the book
  - Similarity of the description to a previously published known work
</code></pre><p>
I replied to their email pointing out that there is no book with a remotely similar name, description and author name as my book. I even did a reverse image search on my cover, and the only hit was my book on Amazon. It seems obvious to me that their AI-powered fraud detection system hallucinated that I plagiarized my own paperback.</p><p>The next day, they terminated my account. I appealed. I got an automated reply saying to give them 5 business days to review my case. That stretched into two weeks. Finally, I got an email stating my appeal was denied with only this message:</p><p>&gt; We found that you have published titles with misleading metadata (including cover), which creates a negative customer experience.</p><p>It seems like they picked the only one of the six bullet points that couldn't be easily disproven, and ran with it. I continued to email and managed to get a few more informal appeals, all denied with the exact same vague nonsense message. I even emailed jeff@amazon.com.</p><p>I had finally given up, when I got an email from Robert from their Executive Customer Relations Team. Hooray a human being (maybe)! A day later, Robert upheld the termination with the exact same vague reason above and some semi-belligerent language about how this was my last appeal.</p><p>Here's plenty more reading:</p><p>https://writersweekly.com/angela-desk/and-even-more-complaints-about-amazon-kdp-kindle-direct-publishing</p><p>https://www.trustpilot.com/review/kdp.amazon.com</p><p>https://medium.com/@peteylao/my-cover-story-aka-how-i-managed-to-get-my-kdp-account-suspended-terminated-and-finally-fd3631e84aba</p><p>https://judylmohr.com/2024/02/02/my-amazon-nightmares-2024/</p></div></div>]]></description>

			</p>

				<div>
				
				
				
				
				<p>According to <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/646880/confidence-higher-education-closely-divided.aspx" target="_blank">a new Gallup poll</a>, Americans are losing the thread with higher education. Confidence in college has taken a nosedive, with one out of three poll responders claiming they have “little or no confidence” in higher education. This contrasts sharply with a 2015 poll, when 57% of those surveyed claimed to to be fairly or “very” confident in the old hallowed halls.</p>
<p>Poll responders <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/646880/confidence-higher-education-closely-divided.aspx" target="_blank">cited several reasons</a> for a rising ambivalence. But among these, “pushing political agendas, not teaching relevant skills, and being overly expensive,” took the cake. The faith-ebbing trend holds true across all demographics surveyed. Though conservatives skewed quite a bit angrier as a block, with Republicans citing fear of liberal “indoctrination” as a big reason for foregoing four-year-ed.</p>
<p>Perhaps this news won’t shock you to your socks, considering the interlocking crises of 1) <a href="https://www.luminafoundation.org/news-and-views/sticker-shock-americans-say-college-costs-are-too-high-and-unclear/" target="_blank">un-affordability</a>, 2) fresh light on the <a href="https://knowyourdebt.debtcollective.org/student" target="_blank">scam that is student loans</a>, 3) an unpromising job market with diminishing returns for un-STEM professions and 3) the many tortured varietals of “free speech” discourse. Every corner of academia is famously in trouble, from <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/blogs/higher-ed-gamma/adjunctification-gen-ed-0" target="_blank">adjuncts</a> to alumni.</p>
<p>And considering too how <a href="https://www.thenation.com/article/society/student-journalists-campus-repression-palestine-protests/" target="_blank">poorly students have been treated by the mainstream media</a>, I’m personally hard-pressed to imagine the high-ed advocate who <em>could</em> claim full confidence in The University. Still, it’s striking that responders are citing more than material objections. Increasingly, to-college or not-to-college feels like an ethical question.</p>
<p>Even if today’s young person goes in knowing that their private college humanities degree could prove professionally useless, it was plausible till recently that such a degree could at least yield cryptic intellectual benefits.</p>
<p>In a 2020 piece for <em>The New Republic</em>, Dr. Wim Wiewel of Lewis &amp; Clark University outlined <a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/157845/case-liberal-arts-college-coronavirus-crisis" target="_blank">three core goals of a liberal arts education</a>: “to encourage lifelong exploration of the self and one’s own values; to develop the skills needed to embark on meaningful careers; and to prepare for full, and civil, participation in public life.” This rubric surely conveys the enlightenment-era tea yours truly was sipping, when I elected to take on a BFA for a six figure ticket price. But such benefits look starry-eyed from here.</p>
<p>These days, there are very different corridors for “civil participation.” And, thanks to an <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/culture/2022-in-review/the-year-in-quiet-quitting" target="_blank">ongoing interrogation of office life under capitalism</a>, the definition of a “meaningful career” isn’t static, either. “Public life” is increasingly siloed, too, in a country where large parts of the population <a href="https://theintercept.com/2023/09/15/deconstructed-naomi-klein-doppelganger-book/" target="_blank">fail to agree on basic tenets of reality</a>. Let alone how schools should operate.</p>
<p>This is all to say: I get it, youth of America. Ad hoc classes plus robust hobbies plus library creepin’ plus learning a trade with a strong union looks more and more reasonable to me, as a life plan. And a(n unscientifically conducted) poll of the Lit Hub masthead seems to agree. But to each their own.</p>
<p>It could also be a matter of time. As the Gallup poll notes, confidence in community college and two year programs is up.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-hpc="true"><article itemprop="text"><p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">DECstation 2040</h2><a id="user-content-decstation-2040" aria-label="Permalink: DECstation 2040" href="#decstation-2040"></a></p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">1.0 Introduction</h2><a id="user-content-10-introduction" aria-label="Permalink: 1.0 Introduction" href="#10-introduction"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">This document outlines the DECstation 2040, a RP2040 based DECstation 3000
emulator that can run DECWindows. A summary of features:</p>
<p dir="auto">Hardware:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>RP2040, running at 1.8v/300 MHz</li>
<li>32 MB of PSRAM</li>
<li>8 MB SPI flash</li>
<li>uSD card socket</li>
<li>Monochrome VGA at 1024 x 864</li>
<li>Ethernet RMII PHY support (socket on rev 1.5, integrated in rev 2.1)</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Software:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>4 port PSRAM PIO engine</li>
<li>PIO driven VGA, with seperate 16x16 cursor plane overlay</li>
<li>USB HID to DECWindows keyboard and mouse</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">1.1 Software</h2><a id="user-content-11-software" aria-label="Permalink: 1.1 Software" href="#11-software"></a></p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">PIO:</h3><a id="user-content-pio" aria-label="Permalink: PIO:" href="#pio"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The PSRAM/HyperRAM PIO engine provides 42/32 MB/s (write/read) of memory
bandwidth. Further, four PIO engines are used to provide four seperate
read/write memory ports. This allows independent memory access for
the emulated CPU, video DMA, and receive/send Ethernet traffic. Note that
all 32 instruction slots are used.</p>
<p dir="auto">The video PIO engine can support up to a sysclk/2 pixel rate. Thus,
for the 300 MHz sysclk typically used, it is possible to run 1080p60 at
a pixel rate of 148.5 MHz. The default video rate is 1024 x 768 @ 70Hz,
as this matches the screen used for development and the pixel rate
is an integral divisor from sysclk. Only five PIO instruction slots are
used.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">DMA:</h3><a id="user-content-dma" aria-label="Permalink: DMA:" href="#dma"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">To drive the video PIO engine, five DMA channels are used. They are allocated
as follows:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>ctrl_dma_chan - points to DMA channel command packets</li>
<li>data_dma_chan - executes DMA command packets</li>
<li>ps_read_chan - points to PSRAM read data buffer</li>
<li>inc_dma_chan - used to generate loop counter indices</li>
<li>cur_inc_dma_chan - used as cursor loop counter</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">This project uses the RP2040 DMA sniffer to dynamically generate PSRAM
addresses, which eliminates the need to have a per-line PSRAM command packet.
Further, it uses the inc_dma_chan to enable DMA command loops, eliminating
per-line DMA commands needed to send commands to the PIO pixel and PSRAM
PIO engines. This makes the amount of memory needed to drive video
independent of the display format. Currently, 86 DMA command packets are
used vs. approximately 2250 required for 1080p if a per-line DMA structure
was used.</p>
<p dir="auto">In order to eliminate the latency from when the PSRAM PIO engine FIFO
has read data, and its delivery to SRAM, we use the ps_read_chan. This
channel is chained to after a PSRAM DMA command is executed. Without
this channel, the PSRAM PIO engine FIFO would be not be emptied until
the next DMA command is executed. This impacts the non-video PSRAM
channels, as they must wait unitl the video PSRAM command is complete.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">USB:</h3><a id="user-content-usb" aria-label="Permalink: USB:" href="#usb"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The USB HID code supports (at least) two keyboard/mouse combo types:
Rii mini X1 (model: RT-MWK01), purchased at MicroCenter, and Logitech
K830.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Emulator:</h3><a id="user-content-emulator" aria-label="Permalink: Emulator:" href="#emulator"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Dmitry's code at <a href="http://dmitry.gr/?r=05.Projects&amp;proj=33.%20LinuxCard" rel="nofollow">http://dmitry.gr/?r=05.Projects&amp;proj=33.%20LinuxCard</a> was
modified to support the RP2040, as well as adding support for video and USB
mouse/keyboard input. With overclocking and running the assembly language
version of the CPU emulator, Dmitry's Linux image reports a BOGOMIPS rating
of 13.44.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">2.0) Getting started</h2><a id="user-content-20-getting-started" aria-label="Permalink: 2.0) Getting started" href="#20-getting-started"></a></p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">2.1) Hardware</h2><a id="user-content-21-hardware" aria-label="Permalink: 2.1) Hardware" href="#21-hardware"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Build either rev 1.5 or 2.1, using the appropriate emu_brd directory. Please
note that rev 2.1 is still undergoing Ethernet debug, and has exhibited
significant packet drops. I use JLCPCB for board fabrication, and there are
Digikey BOM spreadsheets in doc/bom. Recommend building two boards: one to
use as a 1.8v CMSIS debugger, and the other as the target. Feel free to only
populate the RP2040 related components on the CMSIS debugger.</p>
<p dir="auto">The surface mount parts aren't too troublesome - I find the PSRAM BGA to be
much easier to solder than the RP2040 QFN. My technique is to use a hot-air
SMT rework tool. Recommended assembly steps:</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>Solder the voltage regulator, check for 1.8v and 3.3v when done.</li>
<li>Solder all of the passives, the RP2040, flash, and the USB connectors
if building rev 2.1. (Note that two bodge wires are needed to connect J5
and J11 D+/D- as my assumption that USB-A could serve as non-host connector
was incorrect).
When done, use blink_bringup (below) to check connections. (Edit blink.c
to enable the pins to check).</li>
<li>Solder the HyperRAM chip, run mem_test to check connections.</li>
<li>Solder the voltage translator chips, edit blink.c and run to check
connections.</li>
<li>Solder the connectors.</li>
</ol>
<p dir="auto">For rev 1.5:
Needs modified waveshare LAN8722 board. In addition to the modifications
outlined at: <a href="https://github.com/maximeborges/pico-rmii-ethernet">https://github.com/maximeborges/pico-rmii-ethernet</a>, pin 13 of
the 7 x 2 connector (originally NC) is used as VDDIO for the LAN8722 chip.
To make this modification, cut the existing connection between LAN8722 pin
9 to 3.3v, and route pin 9 to pin 13 of the connector. This allows the use
of 1.8v I/O from the DECstation 2040 board. Also needed is a 6 pin header
to VGA connector. See rev 2.1 schematic for VGA pins needed.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">2.2) Software</h2><a id="user-content-22-software" aria-label="Permalink: 2.2) Software" href="#22-software"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Start with:
<a href="http://dmitry.gr/?r=05.Projects&amp;proj=33.%20LinuxCard" rel="nofollow">http://dmitry.gr/?r=05.Projects&amp;proj=33.%20LinuxCard</a>
Download the images, particularly the ultrix.gui image. This should be placed
on a FAT32 for uMIPS. Edit uc_main.c to select which image to run.</p>
<p dir="auto">Next, go to where this README.md is stored. Then set current directory to sw.
Edit the "source_this" file to reflect the location of the Pico SDK, and source
this file to set the PICO_SDK environment variable for the current session.</p>
<p dir="auto">A good place to start is with the blink_bringup directory. CD to this,
and do:</p>
<p dir="auto"><code>cmake -B build -S .</code></p>
<p dir="auto">Build software via</p>
<p dir="auto"><code>./build.sh</code></p>
<p dir="auto">This will generate an .elf file in build/src. Use picotool to load this onto
the target board. After rebooting, should get "hello, world" on USB serial, as
well as on the hardware serial port. A 500 Hz square wave should be present
on GPIO21 (ret_clk). This can be changed via editing the src/blink.c file.
I use this tool incrementally while soldering the board, to verify connectivity.</p>
<p dir="auto">Next, build the CMSIS debugger. CD to the picoprobe directory and
build with:</p>
<p dir="auto"><code>cmake -B build -DCUSTOMPROBE=1 make -C build</code></p>
<p dir="auto">Program with</p>
<p dir="auto"><code>sudo picotool load build/customprobe.elf</code></p>
<p dir="auto">Now go to the psram directory and do:</p>
<p dir="auto"><code>cmake -B build -S .</code></p>
<p dir="auto">Build software via</p>
<p dir="auto"><code>./build.sh</code></p>
<p dir="auto">This will generate most of the available packages. Of interest are:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>mem_test - a simple memory tester</li>
<li>fb_test - test program for the frame buffer library</li>
<li>fb_mem_test - memory test with frame buffer enabled</li>
<li>pico-rv32ima - RISC-V linux emulation</li>
<li>uMIPS - DECstation emulation</li>
<li>pico_rmii_ethernet_httpd - test program for RMII.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">There are shell scripts to load the above:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>cl_sram.sh   - sd command line</li>
<li>eth_sram.sh  - ethernet test</li>
<li>fb_flash.sh  - framebuffer library test, run from flash</li>
<li>fb_sram.sh   - framebuffer library test, run from SRAM</li>
<li>fbm_flash.sh - memory test with framebuffer enabled, run from flash</li>
<li>fbm_sram.sh  - memory test with framebuffer enabled, run from SRAM</li>
<li>mt_sram.sh   - memory test, run from SRAM</li>
<li>mt_flash.sh  - memory test, run from flash</li>
<li>um_flash.sh - uMIPS emulator, run from flash</li>
<li>um_sram.sh  - uMIPS emulator, run from SRAM</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Running the code:
Connect the debugger board to the SWD port on the target.
Start the CMSIS debugger via sw/start_cmsis.sh.
Execute one of the scripts above. This will load the program into RP2040
SRAM and start it.</p>
<p dir="auto">If you wish to run from flash, comment out the no_flash line in the source CMakeLists.txt. Note that the uMIPS emulator requires "copy_to_ram" to be enabled
when running from flash.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">3.0) Commentary</h2><a id="user-content-30-commentary" aria-label="Permalink: 3.0) Commentary" href="#30-commentary"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">This project has been a voyage of discovery. The first doc/build_log.txt entry
was on 23-mar-2023, but I'd been thinking of building a business card
ever since I'd read Dmitry's LinuxCard web page. I've learned how to
use the RP2040 PIO engines and the DMA subsystem to push pixels. I'm
amazed at how flexible and capable the RP2040 has turned out to be. Hats off
to the RP2040 designers!</p>
<p dir="auto">Most enjoyable moments:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>When the PSRAM PIO engine finally ran the memory test overnight.</li>
<li>When the second solution to the problem of how to get the DMA subsytem
to do a counted loop actually worked without killing SD card access.</li>
<li>When the DMA cursor read data during blanking worked, giving smooth
cursor movement.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Less than enjoyable moments:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Realizing the "optimization" of reordering data on the PSRAM to improve
layout was wrong, after submitting the design to JLCPCB.</li>
<li>Realizing that the first flash part chosen didn't support "Continuous Read
Mode". On the other hand, this did force me to learn how to do SRAM builds,
speeding up development.</li>
<li>Having the wrong footprint for the level translator on rev 1.3.</li>
<li>Finding out that Digikey no longer stocked the Ethernet connector on
rev 2.0, after submitting PCB. Related - the PSRAM was out of stock, so
clicked on the recommended alternative. Was disappointed when the box
showed up, and it was the waferscale part. Tiny, but unsolderable.</li>
</ul>

<ul dir="auto">
<li>Use the ps_get_buf DMA subroutine to setup the cursor PSRAM command. This

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2><a id="does-ai-have-an-isolation-problem-0"></a><strong>Does AI have an isolation problem?&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2><p>Over the past months, we on the Wiz Research Team have conducted extensive tenant isolation research on multiple AI service providers. We believe these services are more susceptible to tenant isolation vulnerabilities, since by definition, they allow users to run AI models and applications – which is equivalent to executing arbitrary code. As AI infrastructure is fast becoming a staple of many business environments, the implications of these attacks are becoming more and more significant.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>We will be presenting our findings from this research project at the upcoming Black Hat conference, in our session “<a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.wiz.io/events/blackhat-wiz-talk"><u>Isolation or Hallucination? Hacking AI Infrastructure Providers for Fun and Weights</u></a>”.&nbsp;</p><p>For the latest installment of this project, we researched SAP’s AI offering, aptly named “SAP AI Core.” This is our 3rd report in the series, following our research on the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.wiz.io/blog/wiz-and-hugging-face-address-risks-to-ai-infrastructure"><u>Hugging Face</u></a> and <a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.wiz.io/blog/wiz-research-discovers-critical-vulnerability-in-replicate"><u>Replicate</u></a> platforms. This blog will explore the vulnerability chain and detail our findings, dubbed “SAPwned,” while also looking at the potential impact and broader takeaways for securing managed AI platforms.&nbsp;</p><h2><a id="executive-summary-4"></a><strong>Executive Summary</strong>&nbsp;</h2><p>The AI training process requires access to vast amounts of sensitive customer data, which turns AI training services into attractive targets for attackers. SAP AI Core offers integrations with HANA and other cloud services, to access customers’ internal data via cloud access keys. These credentials are highly sensitive, and our research goal was to determine if potential malicious actors could gain access to these customer secrets.</p><p>Our research into SAP AI Core began through executing legitimate AI training procedures using SAP’s infrastructure. By executing arbitrary code, we were able move laterally and take over the service – gaining access to customers’ private files, along with credentials to customers’ cloud environments: AWS, Azure, SAP HANA Cloud, and more. <strong>The vulnerabilities we found could have allowed attackers to access customers’ data and contaminate internal artifacts – spreading to related services and other customers’ environments.</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>Specifically, the access we gained allowed us to:&nbsp;</p><ul><li><p>Read and modify Docker images on SAP’s internal container registry&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Read and modify SAP’s Docker images on Google Container Registry&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Read and modify artifacts on SAP’s internal Artifactory server&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Gain cluster administrator privileges on SAP AI Core’s Kubernetes cluster&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Access customers’ cloud credentials and private AI artifacts&nbsp;</p></li></ul><figure><figcaption>Step-by-step illustration of our research findings&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><p>The root cause of these issues was the ability for attackers to run malicious AI models and training procedures, which are essentially code. After reviewing several leading AI services, we believe the industry must improve its isolation and sandboxing standards when running AI models.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>All vulnerabilities have been reported to SAP’s security team and fixed by SAP, as acknowledged <a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://support.sap.com/en/my-support/knowledge-base/security-notes-news/credits-for-security-researchers.html?anchorId=M7#M7"><u>on their website</u></a>. We thank them for their cooperation. No customer data was compromised.&nbsp;</p><p>Following is a technical dive into our vulnerability chain and findings.&nbsp;</p><h2><a id="introduction-the-research-begins-14"></a><strong>Introduction: The research begins</strong>&nbsp;</h2><p>SAP AI Core is a service that allows users to develop, train and run AI services in a scalable and managed way, utilizing SAP’s vast cloud resources. Similar to other cloud providers (and AI infrastructure providers), the customer’s code runs within SAP’s shared environment – posing a risk of cross-tenant access.&nbsp;</p><p>Our research began as an SAP customer, with basic permissions allowing us to create AI projects. So, we started out by creating a regular AI application on SAP AI Core. SAP’s platform allowed us to provide an Argo Workflow file, which in turn spawned a new Kubernetes Pod according to our configuration.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>Example Argo Workflow configuration on SAP AI Core&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><p>This allowed us to run our own arbitrary code within the Pod by design – no vulnerability needed. However, our environment was quite restricted. We quickly realized our Pod had extremely limited network access, as enforced by an Istio proxy sidecar – so scanning the internal network wasn’t an option for us. Yet.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2><a id="bug-1-bypassing-network-restrictions-with-the-power-of-1337-19"></a><strong>Bug #1: Bypassing network restrictions with the power of 1337</strong>&nbsp;</h2><p>The first thing we tried was to configure our Pod with “interesting” privileges. However, SAP’s admission controller blocked all the dangerous security options we tried – for example, running our container as <code>root</code>.&nbsp;</p><p>Despite that, we found two interesting configurations that the admission controller failed to block.&nbsp;</p><p>The first is <code>shareProcessNamespace</code>, which allowed us to share the process namespace with our sidecar container. Since our sidecar was the Istio proxy, we gained access to Istio’s configuration, including an access token to the cluster’s centralized Istiod server.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>Accessing the Istio token via our sidecar container&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><p>The other is <code>runAsUser</code> (and <code>runAsGroup</code>). Although we couldn’t be root, all other UIDs were allowed – including Istio’s UID, which ironically enough was <code>1337</code> (yeah, really). We set our UID to 1337 and successfully ran as the Istio user. Since Istio itself is <a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://istio.io/latest/docs/reference/config/analysis/ist0144/"><u>excluded from Istio’s iptables rules</u></a> – we were now running without any traffic restrictions!&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>Sending requests to the internal network – before and after UID 1337&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><p>Free from our traffic shackles, we started scanning our Pod’s internal network. Using our Istio token, we were able to read configurations from the Istiod server and gain insight on the internal environment – which led us to the following findings.&nbsp;</p><h2><a id="bug-2-loki-leaks-aws-tokens-27"></a><strong>Bug #2: Loki leaks AWS tokens</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2><p>We found an instance of Grafana Loki on the cluster, so we requested the <code>/config</code> endpoint to view Loki’s configuration. The API responded with the full configuration, including AWS secrets that Loki used to access S3:&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>Configuration excerpt from SAP’s Loki server&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><p>These secrets granted access to Loki’s S3 bucket, containing a large trove of logs from AI Core services (which SAP says aren’t sensitive) and customer Pods.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>Partial file list from Loki’s S3 bucket&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><h2><a id="bug-3-unauthenticated-efs-shares-expose-user-files-32"></a><strong>Bug #3: Unauthenticated EFS shares expose user files</strong>&nbsp;</h2><p>Within the internal network, we found 6 instances of AWS Elastic File System (EFS), listening on port 2049. A <a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/HcNmkCRXFdE"><u>common problem</u></a> with EFS instances is their default configuration as public – meaning credentials aren’t needed to view or edit files, as long as you have network access to their NFS ports. These instances were no different, and using simple open-source NFS tools, we were able to freely access the shares’ contents.&nbsp;</p><p>Listing files stored on these EFS instances has revealed mass amounts of AI data, including code and training datasets, categorized by customer ID:&nbsp;</p><figure></figure><figure><figcaption>Partial file list from two EFS shares; each folder represents a different customer ID</figcaption></figure><h2><a id="bug-4-unauthenticated-helm-server-compromises-internal-docker-registry-and-artifactory-37"></a><strong>Bug #4: Unauthenticated Helm server compromises internal Docker Registry and Artifactory</strong>&nbsp;</h2><p>Our most interesting finding on the network was a service named Tiller, which is the server component of the Helm package manager (in version 2).&nbsp;</p><p>Communication with Tiller is made via its gRPC interface on port 44134, which is by default exposed without any authentication.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Querying this server on our internal network revealed highly privileged secrets to SAP’s Docker Registry as well as its Artifactory server:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>Container registry and Artifactory credentials – exposed by Helm server query</figcaption></figure><p>Using these secrets’ read access, a potential attacker could read internal images and builds, extracting commercial secrets and possibly customer data.&nbsp;</p><p>Using the secrets’ write access, an attacker could poison images and builds, conducting a supply-chain attack on SAP AI Core services.&nbsp;</p><h2><a id="bug-5-unauthenticated-helm-server-compromises-k8s-cluster-exposing-google-access-tokens-and-customer-secrets-45"></a><strong>Bug #5: Unauthenticated Helm server compromises K8s cluster, exposing Google access tokens and customer secrets</strong>&nbsp;</h2><p>The Helm server was exposed to both read and write operations. While the read access exposed sensitive secrets (as can be seen above), the server’s write access allowed for a complete cluster takeover.&nbsp;</p><p>Tiller’s <code>install</code> command takes a Helm package and deploys it to the K8s cluster. We created a malicious Helm package that spawns a new Pod with <code>cluster-admin</code> privileges, and ran the install command.&nbsp;</p><p>We were now running with full privileges on the cluster!&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>Partial list of K8s permissions we obtained via Helm&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><p>Using this access level, an attacker could directly access other customer’s Pods and steal sensitive data, such as models, datasets, and code. This access also allows attackers to interfere with customer’s Pods, taint AI data and manipulate models’ inference.&nbsp;</p><p>Furthermore, this access level would have allowed us to view customers’ own secrets – even secrets that are beyond the scope of SAP AI Core. For example, our AI Core account contained secrets to our AWS account (for S3 data access), our SAP HANA account (for Data Lake access), and our Docker Hub account (to pull our images). Using our newfound access level, we queried for those secrets, and managed to access all of them in plaintext:&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>Accessing customer secrets using our K8s permissions&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><p>The same query also revealed an SAP access key to Google Container Registry, named <code>sap-docker-registry-secret</code>. We have confirmed that this key grants both read and write permissions – further enlarging the scope of a potential supply-chain attack.&nbsp;</p><h2><a id="takeaways-54"></a><strong>Takeaways</strong>&nbsp;</h2><p>Our research into SAP AI Core demonstrates the importance of defense in depth. The main security obstacle we were facing was Istio blocking our traffic from reaching the internal network. Once we were able to bypass that obstacle, we gained access to several internal assets that did not require any additional authentication – meaning the internal network was perceived as trusted. Hardening those internal services could have minimized the impact of this attack and downgraded it from a complete service takeover to a minor security incident.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>In line with our previous Kubernetes-related vulnerabilities, this research also demonstrates the tenant isolation pitfalls of using K8s in managed services. The crucial separation between the control plane (service logic) and the data plane (customer compute) is being impacted by the K8s architecture, which allows logical connections between them through APIs, identities, shared compute, and software-segmented networks.&nbsp;</p><p>Furthermore, this research demonstrates the unique challenges that the AI R&amp;D process introduces. AI training requires running arbitrary code by definition; therefore, appropriate guardrails should be in place to assure that untrusted code is properly separated from internal assets and other tenants.&nbsp;</p><h2><a id="disclosure-timeline-59"></a>Disclosure timeline&nbsp;</h2><ul><li><p><strong>Jan. 25, 2024</strong> – Wiz Research reports security findings to SAP&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><strong>Jan. 27, 2024</strong> – SAP replies and assigns a case number&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><strong>Feb. 16, 2024</strong> – SAP fixes first vulnerability and rotates relevant secrets&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><strong>Feb. 28, 2024 </strong>– Wiz Research bypasses the patch using 2 new vulnerabilities, reports to SAP&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><strong>May 15, 2024</strong> – SAP deploys fixes for all reported vulnerabilities&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><strong>Jul. 17, 2024 </strong>– Public disclosure&nbsp;</p></li></ul><h2><a id="stay-in-touch-61"></a>Stay in touch!&nbsp;</h2><p>Hi there!

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>With the R515 driver, NVIDIA released a set of <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/nvidia-releases-open-source-gpu-kernel-modules/" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer">Linux GPU kernel</a> modules in May 2022 as open source with dual GPL and MIT licensing. The initial release targeted datacenter compute GPUs, with GeForce and Workstation GPUs in an alpha state.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At the time, we announced that more robust and fully-featured GeForce and Workstation Linux support would follow in subsequent releases and the NVIDIA Open Kernel Modules would eventually supplant the closed-source driver.&nbsp;</p>



<p>NVIDIA GPUs share a common driver architecture and capability set. The same driver for your desktop or laptop runs the world’s most advanced AI workloads in the cloud. It’s been incredibly important to us that we get it just right.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Two years on, we’ve achieved equivalent or better application performance with our open-source GPU kernel modules and added substantial new capabilities:</p>



<ul>
<li>Heterogeneous memory management (HMM) support</li>



<li>Confidential computing</li>



<li>The coherent memory architectures of our Grace platforms</li>



<li>And more</li>
</ul>



<p>We’re now at a point where transitioning fully to the open-source GPU kernel modules is the right move, and we’re making that change in the upcoming R560 driver release.</p>



<h2 id="supported_gpus">Supported GPUs<a href="#supported_gpus"><i></i></a></h2>



<p>Not every GPU is compatible with the open-source GPU kernel modules.</p>



<p>For cutting-edge platforms such as NVIDIA Grace Hopper or NVIDIA Blackwell, you must use the open-source GPU kernel modules. The proprietary drivers are unsupported on these platforms.</p>



<p>For newer GPUs from the Turing, Ampere, Ada Lovelace, or Hopper architectures, NVIDIA recommends switching to the open-source GPU kernel modules.</p>



<p>For older GPUs from the Maxwell, Pascal, or Volta architectures, the open-source GPU kernel modules are not compatible with your platform. Continue to use the NVIDIA proprietary driver.</p>



<p>For mixed deployments with older and newer GPUs in the same system, continue to use the proprietary driver.</p>



<p>If you are not sure, NVIDIA provides a new detection helper script to help guide you on which driver to pick. For more information, see the <strong>Using the installation helper script</strong> section later in this post.</p>



<h2 id="installer_changes">Installer changes<a href="#installer_changes"><i></i></a></h2>



<p>In general, the default version of the driver installed by all installation methods is switching from the proprietary driver to the open-source driver. There are a few specific scenarios that deserve special attention:</p>



<ul>
<li>Package managers with the CUDA metapackage</li>



<li>Runfile</li>



<li>Installation helper script</li>



<li>Package manager details</li>



<li>Windows Subsystem for Linux</li>



<li>CUDA Toolkit</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="using_package_managers_with_the_cuda_metapackage">Using package managers with the CUDA metapackage<a href="#using_package_managers_with_the_cuda_metapackage"><i></i></a></h3>



<p>When you are installing CUDA Toolkit using a package manager (not the .run file), installation metapackages exist and are commonly used. By installing a top-level <code>cuda</code> package, you install a combination of CUDA Toolkit and the associated driver release. For example, by installing cuda during the CUDA 12.5 release time frame, you get the proprietary NVIDIA driver 555 along with CUDA Toolkit 12.5.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Figure 1 shows this package structure.</p>

CUDA packages before CUDA Toolkit 12.6</em></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Previously, using the open-source GPU kernel modules would mean that you could use the top-level metapackage. You would have had to install the distro-specific NVIDIA driver open package along with the cuda-toolkit-X-Y package of your choice.</p>

<h3 id="using_the_runfile">Using the runfile<a href="#using_the_runfile"><i></i></a></h3>



<p>If you install CUDA or the NVIDIA drivers using the <code>.run</code> file, the installer queries your hardware and automatically installs the best-fit driver for your system. UI toggles are also available to select between the proprietary driver and the open source driver, as you choose.</p>



<p>If you’re installing through the CUDA .run file and using the <code>ncurses</code> user interface, you now see a menu similar to the following:</p>


<div><pre title="">┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐

<h3 id="using_the_installation_helper_script">Using the installation helper script<a href="#using_the_installation_helper_script"><i></i></a></h3>



<p>As mentioned earlier, if you’re unsure which driver to pick for the GPUs in your system, NVIDIA created a helper script to guide you through the selection process.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To use it, first install the <code>nvidia-driver-assistant</code> package with your package manager, then run the script:</p>


<div><pre title="">$ nvidia-driver-assistant
</pre></div>


<h3 id="package_manager_details">Package manager details<a href="#package_manager_details"><i></i></a></h3>



<p>For a consistent experience, NVIDIA recommends that you use package managers to install CUDA Toolkit and the drivers. However, the specific details of which package management systems are used by different distributions or how packages are structured can vary depending on your particular distribution.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This section outlines the specific details, caveats, or migration steps needed for various platforms.&nbsp;</p>



<h4>apt: Ubuntu and Debian-based distributions</h4>



<p>Run the following command:</p>


<div><pre title="">$ sudo apt-get install nvidia-open
</pre></div>


<p>To upgrade using the <code>cuda</code> metapackage on Ubuntu 20.04, first switch to open kernel modules:</p>


<div><pre title="">$ sudo apt-get install -V nvidia-kernel-source-open

$ sudo apt-get install nvidia-open
</pre></div>


<h4>dnf: Red Hat Enterprise Linux, Fedora, Kylin, Amazon Linux, or Rocky Linux</h4>



<p>Run the following command:</p>


<div><pre title="">$ sudo dnf module install nvidia-driver:open-dkms
</pre></div>


<p>To upgrade using the <code>cuda</code> metapackage on dnf-based distros, module streams must be disabled:</p>


<div><pre title="">$ echo "module_hotfixes=1" | tee -a /etc/yum.repos.d/cuda*.repo
$ sudo dnf install --allowerasing nvidia-open
$ sudo dnf module reset nvidia-driver
</pre></div>


<h4>zypper: SUSE Linux Enterprise Server, or OpenSUSE</h4>



<p>Run one of the following commands:</p>


<div><pre title=""># default kernel flavor
$ sudo zypper install nvidia-open
</pre></div>

<div><pre title=""># azure kernel flavor (sles15/x86_64)
$ sudo zypper install nvidia-open-azure
</pre></div>

<div><pre title=""># 64kb kernel flavor (sles15/sbsa) required for Grace-Hopper
$ sudo zypper install nvidia-open-64k
</pre></div>


<h4>Package manager summary</h4>



<p>For simplification, we’ve condensed the package manager recommendations in table format. All releases beyond driver version 560 and CUDA Toolkit 12.6 will use these packaging conventions.</p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Distro</strong></td><td><strong>Install the latest&nbsp;</strong></td><td><strong>Install a specific release&nbsp;</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Fedora/RHEL/Kylin</td><td><code>dnf module install nvidia-driver:open-dkms</code></td><td><code>dnf module install nvidia-driver:560-open</code></td></tr><tr><td>openSUSE/SLES</td><td><code>zypper install <strong>nvidia-open{-azure,-64k}</strong></code></td><td><code>zypper install <strong>nvidia-open-560{-azure,-64k}</strong></code></td></tr><tr><td>Debian</td><td><code>apt-get install <strong>nvidia-open</strong></code></td><td><code>apt-get install <strong>nvidia-open-560</strong></code></td></tr><tr><td>Ubuntu</td><td><code>apt-get install <strong>nvidia-open</strong></code></td><td><code>apt-get install <strong>nvidia-open-560</strong></code></td></tr></tbody></table><figcaption><em>Table 1.

<h3 id="windows_subsystem_for_linux">Windows Subsystem for Linux<a href="#windows_subsystem_for_linux"><i></i></a></h3>



<p>Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) uses the NVIDIA kernel driver from the host Windows operating system. You shouldn’t install any driver into this platform specifically. If you are using WSL, no change or action is required.</p>



<h3 id="cuda_toolkit">CUDA Toolkit<a href="#cuda_toolkit"><i></i></a></h3>



<p>The installation of CUDA Toolkit remains unchanged through package managers. Run the following command:</p>


<div><pre title="">$ sudo apt-get/dnf/zypper install cuda-toolkit
</pre></div>


<h2 id="more_information">More information<a href="#more_information"><i></i></a></h2>

            <pubDate>Wed, 17 Jul 2024 18:28:44 GMT</pubDate>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://pldb.io/blog/brianKernighan.html">https://pldb.io/blog/brianKernighan.html</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40988837">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p><span>November 15, 2022 — </span><a href="https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~bwk/">Dr. Brian Kernighan</a> is a Canadian computer scientist who contributed to the development of <a href="https://pldb.io/concepts/unix.html">UNIX</a> at Bell Labs. Along with Dennis Richie, he co-authored a fundamental book on C, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_C_Programming_Language">The C Programming Language</a>. He has been training the next generation of programmers at Princeton University since 2000 and has been monumental in his contribution to the computer science community at large. He wrote the first documented “Hello World!” program and to that we say, “Hello, Brian!”.</p>
<p><span>*</span></p>
<p><h4>Are there any novel ideas from <a href="https://pldb.io/concepts/awk.html">Awk</a> that have yet to be adopted by others?</h4>
</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Kernighan:</strong> The main idea in Awk was <a href="https://pldb.io/features/hasMaps.html">associative arrays</a>, which were newish at the time, but which now show up in most languages either as library functions (hashmaps in <a href="https://pldb.io/concepts/java.html">Java</a> or <a href="https://pldb.io/concepts/cpp.html">C++</a>) or directly in the language (dictionaries in <a href="https://pldb.io/concepts/perl.html">Perl</a> and <a href="https://pldb.io/concepts/python.html">Python</a>).  Associative arrays are a very powerful construct, and can be used to simulate lots of other data structures.</p>
<p>I guess the <a href="https://pldb.io/features/hasPatternMatching.html">pattern-action</a> paradigm was also not novel but not widely used at the time. It's an effective way to organize some kinds of computations.</p>
<p><span>*</span></p>
<p><h4>When you were making programming languages what references did you use?</h4>
</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Kernighan:</strong> None?  This was a long time ago (think 1970s), and the languages that I have been involved with have all been new and special-purpose so there wasn't much available prior art.  Of course one vital tool was <a href="https://pldb.io/concepts/yacc.html">Yacc</a>, which made it really easy to create and experiment with grammars and have them converted into highly efficient parsers.  <a href="https://pldb.io/concepts/lex.html">Lex</a> did the same thing for the lexical level, again replacing a lot of tedious code with a set of rules.  Lex is certainly an example of a pattern-action language; arguably Yacc is as well, so it's kind of a virtuous cycle.</p>
<p><span>*</span></p>
<p><h4>What would be your advice to young people today who want to get into the field of designing programming languages?</h4>
</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Kernighan:</strong> Try designing and implementing small and special purpose languages. They are lots of fun, often very useful, and a great deal easier than trying to create a replacement for <a href="https://pldb.io/concepts/rust.html">Rust</a> or <a href="https://pldb.io/concepts/cpp.html">C++</a>. Look for things that could be automated if you had the right kind of language to spell out the steps, then create a simple compiler and runtime. Jon Bentley wrote a couple of <a href="https://staff.um.edu.mt/afra1/seminar/little-languages.pdf">articles</a> on this long ago that are still relevant.</p>

<p><em>By David Buchanan, 16<sup>th</sup> July 2024</em></p>
<p>I assume by now that most people have heard of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mw8O-nS75hM">Rabbit R1</a>.</p>
<p>Critics <a href="https://gizmodo.com/rabbit-r1-review-ai-companion-performance-1851452097">unanimously</a> <a href="https://www.wired.com/review/rabbit-r1/">agree</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/2/24147159/rabbit-r1-review-ai-gadget">that</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddTV12hErTc">it</a> <a href="https://www.tomsguide.com/ai/rabbit-r1-review">sucks</a>, and some have accused the company of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPOHf20slZg">deliberate deception</a>. Rabbit Inc. reportedly accepts returns, but customers are so eager to get rid of their R1s that even new-in-box units are selling for well below RRP ($200) on secondary markets.</p>

<em>For Sale: Rabbit R1, Never Used</em></p>

<p>I spent 2 hours trying to get my r1 to do anything remotely useful. [...]</p>
<p>I’d sell mine, but honestly I’d feel bad for the person buying it.</p>
<p>I’d give it away, but would feel bad for the person receiving it.</p>
<p>Any ideas?</p>

<p>Well, here we are!</p>
<p>In this article I'll outline the boot process of the R1, and how (and why) I subverted it to create a <a href="https://www.theiphonewiki.com/wiki/Tethered_jailbreak">"tethered jailbreak"</a> that gives you a root shell on otherwise-stock firmware, all without unlocking the bootloader or making <em>any</em> persistent changes to internal storage.</p>
<p>I'll also talk about my initial findings from poking around inside the "RabbitOS" firmware.</p>
<h2 id="motivations"><a href="#motivations">Motivations</a></h2>
<p>After the headlines caught my attention, I started reverse-engineering a copy of the APK that I found floating around the internet (yes, "RabbitOS" is just an app running in a kiosk-like mode on Android 13 AOSP). There are no "local AI models" or anything like that, so once you understand the API it uses to talk to The Cloud™ you can replace the Rabbit R1 hardware with a small Python script. I reverse-engineered their API, and wrote up my <a href="https://gist.github.com/DavidBuchanan314/aafce6ba7fc49b19206bd2ad357e47fa">findings</a> (it's nothing very exciting, just JSON over a websocket).</p>
<p>By the way, you might've seen headlines about <a href="https://www.404media.co/researchers-prove-rabbit-ai-breach-by-sending-email-to-us-as-admin/">exposed API keys</a>. Those API keys were allegedly leaked from server-side source code, and were never stored on-device (I can attest to the latter).</p>
<p>A week or so ago I bought an R1 on eBay for £122 (which is still way more than it's objectively worth). So why did I buy this garbage, in full knowledge of its garbage-ness?</p>
<p>Well, in subsequent app updates they started obfuscating their code, and I took it personally! I love a good game of cat and mouse (or tortoise and hare?), and the game was on. What secrets are they trying to hide from me?</p>
<p>They're using a commercial obfuscator, and to be honest it's quite good, making my purely static-analysis approach tedious. So, I decided it was time to get an R1 in-hand, to poke and prod at. Yes, I'd already figured out the API, but I didn't want to get locked out in future updates. Not because I especially care about being able to interrogate Rabbit's mediocre APIs, but because my pride is at stake.</p>
<p>I'd also never looked at the boot security of a modern-ish Android device before, so it was an interesting learning opportunity on that front.</p>
<p>During my static analysis of their obfuscated code, I noted logic to detect off-the-shelf analysis tools like Magisk and Frida (if detected, it'd refuse to run). So, I was probably going to have to develop my own tooling. Fun! Of course, I could try to work around their anti-analysis detections, but that's much less fun. The obfuscated code also takes steps to verify that it's running on an R1, as opposed to any other android device, and I <em>could</em> spoof or patch those checks, but that gets boring (and tends not to be a very future-proof approach).</p>
<p>In other words I prefer to be a reverse engineer, rather than an anti-anti-reverse-engineer.</p>
<h2 id="r1-hardware"><a href="#r1-hardware">R1 Hardware</a></h2>
<p>The device uses a <a href="https://wiki.postmarketos.org/wiki/MediaTek_MT6765">MediaTek MT6765</a> SoC, with 4GB of DRAM, and 128GB(!) of eMMC storage. The SoC is an interesting choice for a newly designed product released in 2024, since it has known <a href="https://github.com/amonet-kamakiri/kamakiri">bootrom exploits</a> (since 2019!) The 128GB of storage is also a weird choice, since the device doesn't store much locally. Maybe they intended to develop local ML models and gave up. Or maybe it was just surplus stock being sold at a discount.</p>
<p>R1 owners fairly quickly noticed that although the bootloader is "locked" by default, you can use <a href="https://github.com/bkerler/mtkclient/">mtkclient</a> to unlock and then <a href="https://github.com/RabbitHoleEscapeR1/r1_escape">reflash</a> it with a "custom ROM" and/or root it. It doesn't even need to use the aforementioned bootrom exploit, because the device is permissively configured. However, I'm not too interested in running a custom Android system image, I'm here because I want a closer look at the factory-installed firmware.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: Many are calling the reflashing process a "jailbreak", and I'm not going to argue with them. Just be aware that if you see someone talk about jailbreaking an R1, they might be referring to that.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Although the first boot stages are wide open, subsequent stages implement <a href="https://source.android.com/docs/security/features/verifiedboot/avb">Android Verified Boot 2.0</a>. I could unlock the bootloader and install <a href="https://github.com/topjohnwu/Magisk">Magisk</a> (a root tool which works by patching the <code>boot</code> partition), but this has several issues:</p>
<ul>
<li>It might break OTA delta updates (which, to Rabbit's credit, are regular).</li>
<li>It might get detected by the current anti-analysis code.</li>
<li>It might get detected by <em>future</em> updates that check, for example, <code>ro.boot.verifiedbootstate</code> (which is <a href="https://developers.google.com/android/management/reference/rest/v1/VerifiedBootState">set by AVB</a> depending on how happy it is).</li>
</ul>
<p>All three of these problems are workaround-able, but it'd be so much easier if we could just not cause them in the first place. I want to run as much of the "vanilla" code as possible, with minimally invasive patches to grant me local root privileges, so that I can inspect the app at runtime. The fewer things I change, the fewer things there are for annoying anti-analysis logic to detect.</p>
<p>The solution I came up with was to write a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rootkit#Bootkits">"bootkit"</a> of sorts. Before I tell you how that works, let me explain the default boot process in detail. Fair warning, it's about to get dense.</p>
<h2 id="the-boot-chain"><a href="#the-boot-chain">The Boot Chain</a></h2>
<p>All the boot chain logic comes from MediaTek, the SoC vendor.</p>
<p>The boot process starts in the bootrom (aka brom), which is immutably etched into the CPU silicon, and mapped at physical address 0. The bootrom does very basic hardware initialisation, and then loads the next stage (the "Preloader") from the eMMC <a href="https://pengutronix.de/en/blog/2020-10-15-anpassen-einer-emmc.html">boot0</a> partition, into SRAM. The Preloader is signed, and the bootrom <a href="https://research.nccgroup.com/2020/10/15/theres-a-hole-in-your-soc-glitching-the-mediatek-bootrom/">verifies the signature</a> before executing it. (Edit: Actually, on the R1 it might not verify it at all. More research needed...)</p>
<p>The Preloader initialises DRAM, and then loads 3 images from eMMC GPT partitions into DRAM:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>tee</code> Arm Trusted Firmware (EL3)</li>
<li><code>gz</code> GenieZone Hypervisor (EL2)</li>
<li><code>lk</code> Little Kernel (EL1)</li>
</ul>
<p>It verifies their signatures, and then jumps to LK.</p>
<p>Through some process I don't yet fully understand, LK jumps to ATF, which sets itself up and then jumps to GZ, which sets itself up, before returning back to LK, which continues the boot process. I haven't investigated ATF and GZ in much detail so I might be slightly wrong here.</p>
<p>LK is where the interesting stuff happens though. It implements the aforementioned Android Verified Boot, and as part of that, <a href="https://source.android.com/docs/security/features/verifiedboot/dm-verity">dm-verity</a>, which "provides transparent integrity checking of block devices. dm-verity helps prevent persistent rootkits that can hold onto root privileges and compromise devices. This feature helps Android users be sure when booting a device it is in the same state as when it was last used."</p>
<p>LK loads and verifies the GPT <code>boot</code> partition (from eMMC userdata, not to be confused with eMMC <code>boot0</code>), which contains the Linux kernel and initramfs. If the bootloader is in "locked" state, it will refuse to boot if verification fails. If the bootloader is "unlocked" it will still boot, but with a big scary warning saying that the device cannot be trusted, and it also sets various flags to inform the soon-to-be-booted kernel of this (aka "orange state"). If dm-verity checks fail, the device won't boot even if the bootloader is unlocked (It displays a warning and says "press the power button to continue", but it doesn't work. This may be a bug!)</p>
<p>Assuming the requisite checks have passed, LK finally decompresses and boots the Linux kernel, which in turn executes <code>/init</code> from the initramfs, which in turn mounts the other partitions and does all the other Boot Stuff (which I don't understand too well at present - for my purposes I only need to understand as far as <code>/init</code>).</p>
<p>By the way, it uses the <a href="https://source.android.com/docs/core/ota/ab">A/B</a> partitioning scheme (so when I said <code>boot</code> earlier, that's really either <code>boot_a</code> or <code>boot_b</code> depending on which slot is currently active).</p>
<p>Also by the way, bootloader lock/unlock state is stored in the <code>seccfg</code> GPT partition. The <code>seccfg</code> data is just a few flags, along with an encrypted hash of that data. The hash is encrypted using the SoC's hardware AES engine, acting as a signature/MAC of sorts. Relatedly, the last byte of the <code>frp</code> partition governs whether bootloader unlocking is permitted (e.g. via <a href="https://github.com/RabbitHoleEscapeR1/r1_escape/blob/014e61788637b5a3d5d357b9ccf4f74830b3d455/r1.sh#L85-L104"><code>fastboot flashing unlock</code></a>, which would update <code>seccfg</code> on success).</p>
<h2 id="breaking-the-chain-of-trust"><a href="#breaking-the-chain-of-trust">Breaking the Chain of Trust</a></h2>
<p>Secure boot chains all have a root of trust. In this case, the root of trust is a certificate hash baked into the CPU's efuses, along with the bootrom code that verifies it. However, due to the aforementioned "kamakiri" bootrom exploit, the first link of the chain is irrevocably broken. If we can subvert the first stage, we can in principle subvert all subsequent stages, no matter how "secure" they are in isolation. This hardware is fundamentally incapable of hiding secrets from its users (I wish all hardware was like that, to be honest).</p>
<p>But, we don't even need to use an exploit here. Both the brom and Preloader boot stages feature a USB bootloader mode, which in the r1's case will accept unsigned DA ("Download Agent") images over USB, and allow you to execute them from memory (from SRAM in the case of brom, and DRAM in the case of Preloader).</p>
<p>So, I wrote my own <a href="https://github.com/DavidBuchanan314/rabbit_r1_boot_notes/tree/e799ec802255ef9916505b9d60167959f02960aa/scripts/custom_da">DA payload</a>. It gets loaded into DRAM by Preloader and does the following things, in order:</p>
<ol>
<li>It loads a custom Android <code>boot</code> image over USB into DRAM (containing kernel and initramfs).</li>
<li>It installs a hook in the very last part of Preloader, just before it jumps to LK.</li>
<li>It jumps back into Preloader to continue the regular boot process.</li>
<li>Preloader loads verifies the <code>tee</code>, <code>gz</code> and <code>lk</code> images from eMMC, as it normally would.</li>
<li>Just as Preloader is about to jump to LK, our hook lands, and we take this opportunity to install custom hooks/patches in LK.</li>
<li>LK continues boot as normal, loading and verifying the original <code>boot</code> partition from eMMC.</li>
<li>One of our aforementioned LK hooks is to hook memcpy. When the <code>boot</code> image is getting copied from the "AVB" code over to the "boot linux" part of the code (they seem to be separate modules), we substitute in the custom boot image that we initially loaded over USB.</li>
<li>Another LK hook displays a custom message on the screen, just for style points.</li>
<li>Our custom kernel/initramfs starts booting, while all integrity verification checks pass!</li>
</ol>
<p>LK uses the MMU to provide memory protection, and although the mappings are all identity mappings (virtual address == physical address), it created some headaches for me. I skipped the details above, but I actually have to copy the boot image around multiple times, as different memory ranges are accessible and/or clobbered at different sub-stages of LK's boot process. There's almost certainly scope to simplify this logic, but hey, it works.</p>
<p>At each stage, my general approach is to let the boot process proceed unmodified, let it verify the data that needs to be verified, and then substitute in my patched data right at the last minute, between verification and use. A bit like this:</p>

<p>Just to reiterate, we don't touch flash storage at any point during this process, the entire "jailbreak" process stays in memory only. This also means that once the device is rebooted it's back to a clean slate, which is often useful when reverse engineering.</p>
<p>For the custom boot image, I used the <a href="https://github.com/ng-dst/flashable-android-rootkit">flashable-android-rootkit</a> project, which is essentially a stripped-down version of Magisk. It replaces the default <code>/init</code> binary in the intramfs with one that injects a maximally privileged  user-space service (the "payload"), before continuing the boot process.</p>
<p>The tool used to do the actual boot image patching, <code>magiskboot</code>, also comes from Magisk project. It's intended to be executed on-device, but that's not viable in my case because (until we've jailbroken it at least once) there's no way to run our own code on the R1. Fortunately the <a href="https://github.com/ookiineko/magiskboot_build">magiskboot_build</a> project exists, allowing magiskboot to be compiled and executed on regular linux systems.</p>
<p>For my payload, I wrote a quick-and-dirty TCP bind shell - not very "stealthy" (i.e. potentially detectable by the Rabbit app), but I can always improve this down the line.</p>
<p>Since I'm sending a custom <code>boot</code> image, I could in theory patch the kernel, but I haven't had a need for that yet.</p>
<p>I could also build an entire custom kernel from source, but Rabbit Inc. has chosen to violate the GPL2 license and not make the sources available. Of particular note are their drivers for hall-effect scroll wheel sensing, and camera rotation stepper motor control, which are closed-source and yet statically linked into the GPL'd kernel image. Violations like this are hugely destructive to the free software ecosystem, from which companies like Rabbit Inc. benefit.</p>
<h2 id="pushing-the-payload"><a href="#pushing-the-payload">Pushing the Payload</a></h2>
<p>I started writing my own USB client software in Python, not because there's anything wrong with mtkclient (which already implements everything necessary) but because I wanted to make sure I understood everything as much as possible. Once I had it working, I decided to port it to js/WebSerial, just for fun.</p>
<p>And now I have a webpage that can jailbreak a physically-connected Rabbit R1: <a href="https://retr0.id/stuff/r1_jailbreak/">https://retr0.id/stuff/r1_jailbreak/</a></p>
<p>In the spirit of terrible rabbit-themed puns, I'm naming the jailbreak "carroot".</p>

<p>And once it boots, we can log in and have a quick look around:</p>

<pre>$ rlwrap nc 192.168.0.69 1337
# id
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root) context=u:r:rootkit:s0
# getprop ro.boot.verifiedbootstate
green
</pre>
<p>As you can see, we're root, and the system thinks it's been booted securely, without even needing to <a href="https://github.com/topjohnwu/Magisk/blob/master/docs/details.md#resetprop">tamper</a> with system property values.</p>
<p>Note, my TCP shell is so bare-bones that there's no "#" prompt by default, I added it here for clarity.</p>
<p>The privileged "rootkit" <a href="https://source.android.com/docs/security/features/selinux/concepts#types_attributes_rules">SELinux domain</a> is set up as part of <a href="https://github.com/ng-dst/flashable-android-rootkit">flashable-android-rootkit</a>.</p>
<h2 id="research-process"><a href="#research-process">Research Process</a></h2>
<p>In researching the R1's boot chain I benefited from the work of many other researchers and developers who came before me, notably:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/bkerler/mtkclient">bkerler/mtkclient</a> - Code for manipulating MediaTek devices through the brom/preloader/DA interfaces, and more. Also includes its own links to further learning resources.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/cyrozap/mediatek-lte-baseband-re">cyrozap/mediatek-lte-baseband-re</a> - Baseband-focused, but also includes hardware/boot notes, and links to further resources.</li>
<li><a href="https://juejin.cn/post/6844904089663307790">吴港南/preloader运行流程--基于MT6765</a> ("Preloader operation process - based on MT6765") - contains some helpful diagrams and MT6765-specific notes.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/ng-dst/flashable-android-rootkit">ng-dst/flashable-android-rootkit</a>, <a href="https://github.com/LuigiVampa92/unlocked-bootloader-backdoor-demo">LuigiVampa92/unlocked-bootloader-backdoor-demo</a>, <a href="https://github.com/topjohnwu/Magisk">topjohnwu/Magisk</a> - These projects and their associated documentation cover the later stages of the boot process, from <code>/init</code> onwards.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/RabbitHoleEscapeR1/r1_escape">RabbitHoleEscapeR1/r1_escape</a> - Tools/instructions for flashing "custom ROMs" on the R1.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you look at the iFixit <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/95474/rabbit-r1-and-humane-ai-pin-teardown-the-beginning-of-a-new-device-category">teardown photos</a>, you can see test pads labelled TX and RX. These are of course <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_asynchronous_receiver-transmitter">UART</a> test pads, which were invaluable during my research. The logic levels are 1v8, although they appear to be 3v3 tolerant (at least, 3v3 did not blow mine up).

<p>The Preloader has an annoying feature that disables UART logging unless the volume-up key is being held. The R1 doesn't have a volume-up key, so I had to patch preloader to disable this check (and I can boot a patched Preloader using the bootrom's USB download mode).</p>
<p>I was also able to patch the Linux kernel's commandline flags to emit kernel logs to UART, like so:</p>

<pre>earlycon console=ttyS1,921600
</pre>
<p>These combined patches allowed me to gather <a href="https://github.com/DavidBuchanan314/rabbit_r1_boot_notes/blob/main/uart_boot_logs_with_patch.txt">logs</a> for the whole boot process.</p>
<p>During development of my jailbreak tool, I was able to emit UART logs from my own code, for "printf debugging".</p>
<p>P.S. I think I spy an unpopulated JTAG header, which I have not yet investigated further.</p>
<p>P.P.S. The test pad next to the reset button (accessible through the SIM slot, closest to the edge of the board), can be pulled to ground during reset to force the device to boot into brom's USB mode.</p>

<p>So, what <em>were</em> they trying to hide from us?</p>
<p>To be honest I haven't found anything particularly interesting yet. The analysis has only just begun! A big reason why I'm sharing my jailbreak is the hope that other people will join me in my analysis.</p>
<p>One thing I did notice is that they were logging <em>everything</em> to text files on internal storage:</p>

<p>At the time (July 7th), I noted this publicly in the <a href="https://rabbitu.de/">Rabbitude</a> community discord. I just thought it was funny that they were choosing to fill up their 128GB of storage space with such verbose logging.</p>
<p>But as I and others looked closer, and thought about it more deeply, things became concerning.</p>
<p>These logs include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your precise GPS locations (which are also sent to their servers).</li>
<li>Your WiFi network name.</li>
<li>The IDs of nearby cell towers (even with no SIM card inserted, also sent to their servers).</li>
<li>Your internet-facing IP address.</li>
<li>The user token used by the device to authenticate with Rabbit's back-end API.</li>
<li>Base64-encoded MP3s of everything the Rabbit has ever spoken to you (and the text transcript thereof).</li>
</ul>
<p>This was concerning because:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>There's simply no need to be logging this much data in this much detail, especially on a device with no meaningful hardware security. I dread to think what they're logging on the back-end side of things, too!</p>
</li>
<li><p>There was no end-user-facing way of factory-resetting the device, making the logs effectively permanent. Combine that with the highly active second-hand markets and you have a recipe for disaster. There isn't even a "log out" button on-device!</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Fortunately for whoever I bought my R1 from, I factory reset it using <code>mtkclient</code> before doing anything with it.</p>
<p>Fortunately for everyone else, the latest RabbitOS update (v0.8.112) <a href="https://www.rabbit.tech/security-advisory-071124">addressed this issue</a> while I was midway through writing this article. They reduced logging and added a factory reset settings option!</p>
<p>Credit where it's due, this was a very quick turnaround, and it's the first time I've seen Rabbit being even slightly proactive with regards to user privacy and security issues, as opposed to merely reacting to news articles written about them.</p>
<p>I didn't bother reporting it as a security issue myself, firstly because I hadn't fully thought through the impacts at the time, and secondly because I didn't expect to be taken seriously by the company, based on their prior responses to security issues. I was also preoccupied with working on my jailbreak tool! I guess someone else reported it to them though, and I must admit I was positively surprised by their response. I hope this marks a step in the right direction in their attitude towards security issues. If anything, they made the issue sound <em>more</em> serious than it actually is, rather than trying to downplay it.</p>
<p>It would of course be better if they never logged this stuff in the first place, but it's all part of the "move fast and spray PII everywhere" mindset we've come to expect from the modern tech industry.</p>
<p>This reaffirms my belief that consumers should have full ability to inspect and modify the code that runs on the devices they own. When these abilities are denied by a vendor, I take steps to rectify the situation.</p>
<h2 id="aosp-quotcustomizationsquot"><a href="#aosp-quotcustomizationsquot">AOSP "Customizations"</a></h2>
<p>When the news broke that the RabbitOS was just an <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/rabbit-r1-bespoke-android-3439760/">app running on Android 13</a>, Rabbit's PR spin on the matter was to call it a "very bespoke <a href="https://source.android.com/">AOSP</a> [with] lower level firmware modifications".</p>
<p>So, what are these bespoke modifications?</p>
<p>As I said before, my analysis has only just begun. But as far as I can tell, all they've done is disable any and all Android features that could compromise their single-app kiosk mode experience. For example, there is no navbar, no notification bar, etc. They've even taken (ineffective) steps to prevent people from enabling ADB (There's an app, named "<a href="https://zootopia.fandom.com/wiki/Judy_Hopps">Judy</a>", that runs in the background with the sole purpose of disabling ADB if it's found to be running).</p>
<p>On July 4th, @MarcelD505 shared a very clever <a href="https://x.com/MarcelD505/status/1808975562918039783">"kiosk escape" trick</a> (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67SyjsykWBU">mirror</a>), starting from the wifi captive-portal-login web browser, and ending in the Android system settings app, where various useful changes could be made (not shown in the demo video, but you can also use the Android accessibility settings to adjust the system font sizes, for example).</p>
<p>Rabbit "fixed" this in the latest update by removing the Android system settings app from the device entirely. I'm sure they'll say they did this to "improve security", or something.</p>
<p>If your product's security relies on denying users access to their own system settings, you fucked up somewhere along the line.</p>
<p>So yes, it is a rather bespoke AOSP, but all I've seen thus far are attempts to <em>subtract</em> existing functionality.</p>
<p>The thing that really gets my goat is that there's so much they <em>could</em> be doing. A legitimate reason for not being "just an app" is that regular apps on regular phones have to run within Google or Apple's walled gardens, limiting potentially useful integrations. For example, a regular app <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/21874844">doesn't have permission</a> to initiate a phone call and pipe procedurally generated audio into it. But at present, neither does RabbitOS. It's not even something on their already-overambitious <a href="https://www.rabbit.tech/rabbit-r1">roadmap</a>.</p>
<p>I have yet to see any compelling <em>technical</em> reasons that RabbitOS as-implemented can't just be a regular app on a regular phone.</p>
<p>Maybe you like the idea of a dedicated device for a single task. Like the "iPod Classic" of AI assistants. Just <em>say that</em> then! There's no need to make up bullshit technobabble excuses.</p>
<h2 id="advice-for-regular-r1-users"><a href="#advice-for-regular-r1-users">Advice for Regular R1 Users</a></h2>
<p>If you're worried that your device may have been "jailbroken" against your will, just turn it off and on again. If it boots up normally without any warning messages on the screen, you're <em>probably</em> safe. (Edit: unless brom is configured to allow booting unsigned Preloader images from eMMC, in which case you still can't be sure - I'll test this soon)</p>
<p>Ideally you'd be able to reflash known-safe stock firmware using vendor-provided firmware images, but the vendor does not make such provisions. You should ask them for it!</p>
<p>Never leave your R1 unattended, because any data stored on it could easily be extracted by someone who knows what they're doing.</p>
<p>If you're planning on selling (or donating, or trashing) your R1 device, you should factory reset it first using the newly added settings option.</p>
<h2 id="conclusions"><a href="#conclusions">Conclusions</a></h2>
<p>So to wrap things up:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Rabbit R1 has no special hardware: aside from the scroll wheel and rotating camera, it is a generic MediaTek Android device.</li>
<li>Their AOSP "customizations" mostly consist of removing features to better enforce a single-app kiosk mode.</li>
<li>The Rabbit R1 has ineffective boot-chain security, meaning you can't safely leave your device unattended.</li>
<li>Rabbit Inc. is violating the Linux kernel's GPL license.</li>
<li>None of the above bullet-points are new revelations by me, I'm just spelling them out more clearly.</li>
<li>I'm releasing an experimental Tethered Jailbreak <a href="https://retr0.id/stuff/r1_jailbreak/">tool</a>, to assist researchers in getting access to their own R1s, and eventually letting advanced users extend the device's functionality.</li>
<li>It was discovered that the R1 logs excessive user information to internal storage, in a way that was impossible for regular users to erase. Rabbit Inc. swiftly rectified this prior to publication of this article. They can't fix the known-since-2019 bootrom issues though, since the bootrom is immutable.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="addendum"><a href="#addendum">Addendum</a></h2>
<p>On July 12th, I asked Rabbit Inc. if they had any comments to make on the content of this article, along with explicitly asking them if they had plans for compliance with the GPL license (and I know I'm not the first to ask the latter).</p>
<p>This article does not constitute a security disclosure (I am not raising any <em>new</em> security issues here), but I thought it would be fair to give them an opportunity to make a statement nonetheless, especially with regards to GPL compliance.</p>
<p>As of the end of July 15th, they have not responded.</p>

By contrast, the much larger changes induced by psilocybin fit with participants’ subjective reports of a radical change in consciousness.

Wild bootstrapping is an approach to permutation testing that was designed for models that are not independent and identically distributed, and are heteroscedastic.</p><p>First, a FC change map was generated for every scan by computing, for each vertex, the average distance between its FC seedmap and the FC seedmap for each of that participant’s baseline scans. As each participant had several baseline visits, FC change was computed for baseline scans by computing distance from all other baseline scans (excluding scans within the same visit). This provided a measure of day-to-day variability. Second, the distance value was used as the dependent variable <i>y</i><sub><i>ij</i></sub> in the LME model to generate a <i>t</i>-statistic. Third, a wild bootstrapping procedure was implemented as follows. Several bootstrap samples (<i>B</i> = 1,000) were generated using the Rademacher procedure<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 120" title="Davidson, J., Monticini, A. &amp; Peel, D.

Specifically, a Rademacher vector was generated by randomly assigning −1 or 1 values with equal probability to the residual of&nbsp;each observation. By element-wise multiplication of the original residuals with the Rademacher vector, bootstrap samples were created to capture the variability in the data.</p><p>For the observed <i>t</i>-statistic-map and each bootstrap sample, the TFCE algorithm was applied to enhance the sensitivity to clusters of significant voxels or regions while controlling for multiple comparisons. The value of the enhanced cluster statistic derived from the bootstrap samples was used to create a null distribution under the null hypothesis. By comparing the original observed cluster statistic with the null distribution, <i>P</i> values were derived to quantify the statistical significance of the observed effect. The <i>P</i> values were obtained on the basis of the proportion of bootstrap samples that produced a maximum cluster statistic exceeding the observed cluster statistic.</p><p>The combined approach of wild bootstrapping with the Rademacher procedure and TFCE provided the&nbsp;method to estimate <i>P</i> values for our multilevel (drug condition, participant, session, task) design. This methodology accounted for the complex correlation structure, effectively controlled for multiple comparisons and accommodated potential autocorrelation in the residuals through the Rademacher procedure. By incorporating these techniques, association with psilocybin and other conditions was reliably identified amid noise and spatial dependencies.</p><h3 id="Sec22">Whole-brain FC change</h3><p>For analyses in Figs. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07624-5#Fig1">1e,g</a>, <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07624-5#Fig2">2</a> and <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07624-5#Fig4">4a</a> (bottom), Extended Data Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07624-5#Fig8">3</a> and Supplementary Figs. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07624-5#MOESM1">3</a>, <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07624-5#MOESM1">4</a> and <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07624-5#MOESM1">6</a>, distance calculations were computed on the FC matrix using <i>z</i>-transformed bivariate correlation of time courses from parcellated brain areas<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 62" title="Gordon, E.

This data-driven approach was used to identify how different parameters (for example, task, drug, individual) affect similarity and/or distance between networks.

The FC change analysis (described above) indicated that connectivity at the whole-brain level did not change following psilocybin (Supplementary Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07624-5#MOESM1">1</a>). A screen was conducted with <i>P</i> &lt; 0.05 threshold to identify brain networks or areas showing persistent effects. This analysis identified the anterior hippocampus as a candidate region of interest for persistent FC change (section ‘Baseline/after psilocybin FC change analysis’ in&nbsp;<a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07624-5#MOESM1">Supplementary Methods</a>).</p><p>We assessed change in anterior hippocampus ‘FC change’ pre- versus postpsilocybin using the LME model described previously. In this model, all sessions before psilocybin (irrespective or cross-over order) were labelled as prepsilocybin and all sessions within 21 days after psilocybin were labelled as postpsilocybin.</p><p>As a control, we tested anterior hippocampus FC change pre- versus post-MTP using both the LME model, and an equivalence test. To control for potential persistent psilocybin effects, only the block of scans immediately before and after MTP were used (for example, if a participant took MTP as drug 1, then all baseline scans were labelled as ‘pre-MTP’ and all scans between drugs 1 and 2 were labelled ‘post-MTP’).</p><p>Equivalence testing (to conclude no change in anterior hippocampus after MTP) was accomplished by setting <i>δ</i> = 0.5 standard deviation of FC change across pre-MTP sessions. We computed the 90% CI of change in FC change between pre- and post-MTP sessions. If the bounds of the 90% CI were within ±<i>δ</i>, then equivalence was determined<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 123" title="Lakens, D.

As the body grows older and accumulates damaged proteins and other molecules, the immune system often sees these as signs of a possible infection, says Stuart Cook, a medical researcher who studies IL-11 at Duke–National University of Singapore Medical School.

But the link between the protein and ageing was discovered by accident when Cook’s colleague, molecular biologist Anissa Widjaja, also at Duke–National University of Singapore Medical School, was testing a method for detecting IL-11. She happened to include in her assay a sample of proteins taken from an old rat, and the test revealed that IL-11 levels were much higher in that sample than in those from younger rats.</p><p>The result led the team, which had not previously focused on longevity, to head in a new direction. The researchers tested a variety of samples from young and old mice and found that IL-11 was consistently more abundant in older mouse tissues, including skeletal muscle, fat and liver tissue<sup><a href="#ref-CR1" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">1</a></sup>. When they deleted the gene that codes for the IL-11 protein in some mice, the animals had improved healthspans — they were healthy for longer — and lived 25% longer than mice with normal levels of IL-11.</p><h2>Next steps</h2><p>The team obtained similar results when, for 25 weeks, they used an antibody against IL-11 to block the protein in mice who were 75 weeks old — roughly the equivalent of 55 years for a person. Similar antibodies are being tested in human trials against cancer and fibrosis.</p><p>The magnitude of the response resembles that seen in some studies when mice are treated with <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-02295-6" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-02295-6" data-track-category="body text link">rapamycin</a>, a prominent drug in the anti-ageing field that is being tested for its benefits. But rapamycin has been linked to unwanted side effects, says Cook, who co-founded a Singapore-based company called Enleofen that is developing drugs against fibrosis. “Rapamycin is good for lifespan, but not healthspan,” he says.</p><article data-label="Related">

<p>how are you doing, fellow unemployeds? enjoying riding your bikes midday past the three-piece suits?</p>
<p><a href="https://mattsta.b-cdn.net/panic/software-jobs.png"><img src="https://mattsta.b-cdn.net/panic/software-jobs.png" width="100%"></a></p>
<h3 id="_interest-rates">Interest Rates</h3>
<p>so, uh, what’s going on?</p>
<p><a href="https://mattsta.b-cdn.net/panic/interest-rates.png"><img src="https://mattsta.b-cdn.net/panic/interest-rates.png" width="100%"></a></p>
<p>Basically, all the “free money” went away when the gubbment mandated interest rates go from years of declining-or-near-zero percent to now over 5% (curiously, a 5% increase in the fed rate also caused all credit cards rates to go from 9% to 30% over the same timeframe. what world).</p>
<p>Why would interest rates cause jobs to go away? Remember an interest rate is essentially “the price of money” — a higher interest rate means money is more expensive itself. Also with higher interest rates, organizations with millions and billions of cash sitting idle can park their money in safe government-backed interest accounts<a href="#_fn2" id="_fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> to grow their balances risk-free instead of taking on risk assets seeking outsized returns.</p>
<p>What counts as risk assets avoided during high interest rate periods? Well, funding companies with uncertain futures is a pretty risky asset. So, at times of high interest rates, the weaker companies collapse, strong companies use high interest rates as an excuse to “clean house” every 10 years, then a couple hundred thousand previously high compensation workers discover there are no jobs for anybody anymore over the next 2-4 years.</p>
<p>By the power of drawing two lines, we see <em>correlation is causation</em> and you can’t argue otherwise:</p>
<p><a href="https://mattsta.b-cdn.net/panic/job-rates.png"><img src="https://mattsta.b-cdn.net/panic/job-rates.png" width="100%"></a></p>
<p>interest rates go up, jobs go down. never a miscommunication. you can explain that.</p>
<h2 id="_company-structures">Company Structures</h2>
<p>Why do interest rate increases specifically destroy <em>tech jobs</em> while other sectors like minimum wage part time jobs or construction jobs have been increasing over rising interest rate periods?</p>
<p>Tech companies fall into one of four categories:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>nepo companies</strong> where your friends have unlimited money, so you get to live in a fantasy world of building unrealistic unmarketable dreams using family nepo money. You never have to really interface with reality to ever be proven wrong. See things like the <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/how-the-trendiest-grilled-cheese-venture-got-burnt/">VC funded grilled cheese startup</a> or the <a href="https://www.wired.com/2016/05/juicero-yves-bhar/">VC funded baby food dispenser</a> or the <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/theranos-and-silicon-valleys-fake-it-till-you-make-it-culture/">nextdoor neighbor VC funded medical fraud</a> or the <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/09/18/weworks-neumann-wants-to-live-forever-and-be-the-first-trillionaire.html">VC funded megalomania “i will become king of Earth” desk renting company</a> or the <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/why-silicon-valley-falls-for-frauds/">VC funded stanford drugs-and-sex crypto club</a> not to be confused with the <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/slatestarcodex/comments/17da5r9/peter_thiel_reflects_on_funding_miri_and_yud/">VC funded berkeley apocalypse</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUkHSPdudn4">cult</a>, etc.</li>
<li><strong>speculation companies</strong> where somebody has an idea, but no product yet and no customers, and also no idea if there’s a market for the product, but they get money to try and build an organization to find out if the idea will work anyway.</li>
<li><strong>initial growth companies</strong> where you had an idea, it starts to become popular, so you trade some ownership in exchange for cash/capital funding for growing your ideas into generating as much revenue as possible. This is also where things like the world famous YC incubator and 500 Cats and Techmoan come into play. Initial growth companies are the next step up from a speculation company after products begin experiencing actual customer demand.
<ul>
<li>fun fact: before the modern “tech accelerator” era, each big city, not named san franciso or boston, had something like a “startup boss” where you’d potentially pay hundreds to thousands of dollars to “present your idea” to the local “angel funding mafia” and then, if you passed, they would give you $50,000 in exchange for taking 80% of your company. This status quo lasted for decades until YC proved the system was essentially fools funding fools. The other fun part: after the “startup mafia” in your city legally owned 80% of your company, they would let you work as founder for about 6-18 months then just fire you and replace you with their own friends. At the first 3 companies I worked at, the CEOs were failed lawyer friends of VCs, installed by the VCs to replace the original founders, due to VC using exploitative legal trickery at every turn possible.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>stable era companies</strong> with a repeatable GTM capability with access to customers and recurring revenue cycles. Stable era companies are essentially what normal people think of as “a company” —&nbsp;a self-supporting corporate entity with growth and stability for all involved (usually).</li>
</ul>
<p>Each category of company has its own benefits and drawbacks.</p>
<p>Related to interest rates, the less successful a company, the more it relies on VC funding, and during high interest rate periods VC funding tends to slow down or vanish completely. Higher interest rates also means your <em>customers</em> have more restrictive spending conditions, so your customers will pull back, reduce, or leave too. Interest rate growth kills speculation companies and truncates or collapses initial growth companies into baseline sustenance mode until the economy opens up to take on more risk again.</p>
<h3 id="_company-level-to-compensation-scale">Company Level to Compensation Scale</h3>
<p>When companies have different sizes, funding, revenue, and war chest balances, it all impacts how much compensation lowly employee scum can receive.</p>
<p>For ease of brain math, we’re going to roughly normalize fully loaded compensation to a per-day rate instead of per-year because the numbers feel more meaningful on a daily scale (and just remember to divide all compensation numbers in half to account for employment taxes).</p>
<h4 id="_nepo-company-pay-scale">Nepo Company Pay Scale</h4>
<p>If you are a fancy imaginary nepo company, there’s no limit to what you can pay employees because your entire company is a weird in-group fictional entity. You can be paid $100 per day or $100,000 per day depending on your personal connection to the power structures. There’s no real conclusions to be drawn from imaginary companies paying their friends whatever they can.</p>
<p>Nepo companies are the most frustrating because they suck up all the media attention for being outsized celebrity driven fads (and they also set the tone for <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/innovations/wp/2017/02/25/rip-livingsocial-the-fast-rise-and-slow-demise-of-a-daily-deals-company/">accelerating unsustainable fad-to-failure cycles</a>).</p>
<p>These companies leave you thinking “i could have made much better products with so much less wasted funding. too bad I wasn’t born rich/connected/bro-lyfe.” These companies, due to their imbalance of meta-funding-vs-tiny-impact, usually explode in a huge exposé about fraud and corruption leaving the founders no choice but to either <a href="https://a16z.com/podcast/disrupting-the-worlds-largest-asset-class-with-adam-neumann/">fail upward forever</a> or <a href="https://www.integrityline.com/expertise/blog/elizabeth-holmes-theranos/">do not pass go</a>.</p>
<h4 id="_speculation-company-pay-scale">Speculation Company Pay Scale</h4>
<p>The smallest form of companies (pre-revenue, pre-growth, pre-customer, barely with an idea) are speculation companies doing what they can to get by every day.</p>
<p>Speculation companies are places to work when you’re a crazy child and so ambitious for a juvenile. You won’t see Tim Apple going to work for two 21 year old code bros living in Peoria trying to disrupt Google.</p>
<p>Working at pre-revenue low-idea companies is a real <a href="https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2009/10/07/the-gervais-principle-or-the-office-according-to-the-office/">loser move</a> if you have any personal marketable experience at all.</p>
<p>These companies will have a pay scale somewhere around 50% to 80% of market rate yet expect 200% to 500% more work than any other professional setting. If you’re not living in a $600/month studio apartment, it’s not worth your time (unless you have some insider information about the organization being a secret tax avoidance or money laundering acquisition scam. sometimes zero-product zero-revenue companies go from no idea to being acquired for a couple billion dollars in a year or two —&nbsp;this is a common pattern for “academic researchers” to form a fake company, vest their shares, then get acquired on basically a huge tax-advantaged hiring bonus at some big tech).</p>
<h4 id="_initial-growth-company-pay-scale">Initial Growth Company Pay Scale</h4>
<p>Initial growth companies have been the ruin of many a poor boy.</p>
<p>Initial growth companies are the worst combination of high-risk, low-reward effort-vs-compensation tradeoffs. Sadly, getting trapped in underperforming initial growth companies is something I never realized was a lifetime risk until way too late to save myself. Now I’ve got <em>nothing</em> to show of my life of work, while other people who just picked a better company to work at 20 years ago and never left have been growing their wealth by a couple million dollars per year every year for almost their entire career, all working as just some rando middle manager at multi-trillion-dollar companies.</p>
<p>Initial growth companies are often unprofitable and just huffing VC fumes to stay alive waiting until some combination of “hopes and dreams” activates then the company “takes off” and everything just works out.</p>
<p>While you’re working at an underfunded, under-compensated, low-growth company just to get by, other people you know will be working at multi-trillion dollar companies making 5x to 50x your compensation for doing the same work or less.</p>
<p>The primary purpose of initial growth companies is only to “make the founders rich” and practically nothing else matters.</p>
<p>There are sub-categories of initial growth companies though:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>growth uptrend</strong>, which is <em>potentially</em> interesting if a company is <em>actually</em> working and will survive, because some initial growth companies do turn into real stable era companies (which is the gambler’s lie under-performing downtrend companies really hype to all employees: JOIN US WHILE WE ARE SMALL! WE WILL GROW FROM -$12 million income per year to $300 trillion income per year in six months!!! CATCH THE WAVE!).</li>
<li><strong>growth downtrend</strong>, which is <em>the worst for all involved</em> because you will end up in a decaying cycle of low compensation combined with serial company layoffs because the company is just failing, but refuses to outright cease to exist (working at these is called “wasting your life”).</li>
<li><strong>stable but zero-growth</strong>, which is interesting but not useful. There is no such thing as a zero-growth low-scale company. If there is no growth, you can’t hire or have compensation increases. Likely, if there is no growth, the entire corporate plan will be adjusted into either “coast forever” mode where all employees get reduced to a skeleton crew and 90% of others are laid off so the founders can just collective passive income forever (or sell the company off for parts in a break-even VC acquihire maneuver). Meanwhile, other people you know working in real companies will continue having exponential compensation growth due to their free passive yearly stock allocation on liquid markets.</li>
</ul>
<p>I guess one rule of thumb is it doesn’t make sense to work for companies who aren’t listed on the US stock market. The best time to join Apple was 25 years ago. The next best time is today? Who knows. What is it like to join a company where all the co-workers your same age have made $10+ million over the past 4 years while you are joining with nothing?</p>
<h4 id="_stable-era-company-pay-scale">Stable Era Company Pay Scale</h4>
<p>Stable era companies are long-lived organization not subject to going bankrupt due to quarterly market trends or government economic policy changes.</p>
<p>Stable era companies also have sub-categories:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>stable stable</strong>, which is consistently growing, consistently profitable, and paying employees $5k to $10k per day at current full comp market rates. These are largely flying under the news radar. These companies aren’t Google or Apple, but rather some tractor company or heavy manufacturing company just churning out results for years without destabilizing the world. Stable stable companies do that thing where every quarter they “beat expectations” on their stock reports by a coincidental $0.01 just to prove they are always growing.</li>
<li><strong>stable unstable, stable-qua-ego</strong>, which is a combination of a popular company controlled by a popular “celebrity CEO” figure. These companies tend to be as manic/bipolar/depressed as their CEOs floating between mega growth phases to mega collapse phases then back to mega growth phases in cycles of 6-18 months each. The growth/collapse phases usually don’t impact your $10k to $20k per day compensation unless you get caught in a <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/02/01/metas-year-of-efficiency-everything-wall-street-needed-to-hear.html">“Year of Efficiency”</a> as euphemism for laying off 50,000 employees while the CEO continues to spend $100 million per year buying private islands.</li>
<li><strong>stable neutronium</strong>, which is when a company controls one or more sectors of the global economy and just can’t be broken. They tend to have stable management, exponentially growing stock prices, and thus exponentially growing compensation for useful employees.</li>
</ul>
<p>Under the modern tech landscape, stable “hyperscale ultra-growth” companies are paying experienced employees the equivalent of $10,000 to $50,000 <em>per day</em> if we include the value of their exponentially growing yearly stock grants. Meanwhile, back in the real world, other companies argue salaries shouldn’t increase for 10 years because “who needs money anyway” or “developers are too expensive” so you are stuck with 10 years of no practical salary growth<a href="#_fn3" id="_fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> and no viable passive stock grants (if you can get a job at all).</p>
<p>Big companies are a gift and a curse because with great size comes great ability for outright economic capture manipulation. At a fundamental level, everybody kinda knows big companies aren’t the best places for “good” things because the default mindset is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9NjudKKildo">big company bad</a> so we continue ignoring <a href="https://www.cio.com/article/2513389/vmware-licensing-and-pricing-hikes-what-options-do-you-have.html">corporate exploitative profit capture</a> is <a href="https://www.volico.com/vmware-10x-price-increase-leaves-companies-looking-for-alternatives/">the inevitable way</a> of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/04/broadcom-execs-say-vmware-price-subscription-complaints-are-unwarranted/">the world</a>.</p>
<h2 id="_how-to-get-hired">How to Get Hired</h2>
<p>Tech jobs are paradoxical because everybody agrees on three things:</p>
<ul>
<li>the tech job requirements are completely broken</li>
<li>the tech job interview process is completely broken</li>
<li>yet, every company follows the same hiring process and posts the same job requirements</li>

<p>I think the entire problem of modern tech hiring comes down to the midwit meme:</p>
<p><a href="https://mattsta.b-cdn.net/panic/midwit.png"><img src="https://mattsta.b-cdn.net/panic/midwit.png" width="80%"></a></p>
<p>Let’s ignore the “IQ” axis and just consider “capability points” or some metric for scaling experience and ability.</p>
<p>The key to midwit meme humor is always the “most advanced” people often use simple solutions indistinguishable from people who don’t know what they are doing. Average people are often in the “knows enough to be dangerous” category by over-thinking and over-working and over-processing everything out of lack of more complete experience to discover simpler and cleaner solutions. We find the midwit problem in job interviews all the time where interviewers think they are “elite special evaluators” needing to gatekeep the unwashed hoards of desperate candidates, but interviewers often can’t reliably judge or measure people who have better answers than they expect.</p>
<h3 id="_scaling-laws">Scaling Laws</h3>
<p>According to all the interviews I’ve failed over the years (I don’t think I’ve ever passed an actual “coding interview” anywhere?), the entire goal of tech hiring is just finding people in the 100 to 115 midwit block then outright rejecting everybody else as too much of an unknown risk.</p>
<p>If you fail the weird mandatory performance-on-demand interviews full of random tasks unrelated to the actual job role, interviewers immediately assume you are a 0 to 55, but they can’t actually tell if you are in the 120 to 200 range instead — especially in the case of, well, what if the interviewer has less experience or less knowledge or less ability than the candidate, so the interviewer <a href="https://wiki.c2.com/?BlubParadox">just can’t detect high performing people</a>?</p>
<p>Personally, I’ve had interviews where the hiring manager seemingly doesn’t know how anything works but they are also in charge of the product architecture? You ask why their platform has a dozen broken features when you tried to use it (and it overcharged you by thousands of dollars a month for services not even provided), but you just get blank stares back because the 24 year old “lead senior engineering manager product architect” doesn’t actually know how systems, platforms, architecture, networking, dns, ssh, monitoring, usability, observability, reliability, or capacity planning works? Then, of course, you get rejected under some false pretense of “not having enough experience” when you’re trying to promote developing fixes to their seemingly decaying platform<a href="#_fn4" id="_fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Modern tech hiring, due to <a href="https://research.google/blog/hiring-the-lake-wobegon-strategy/">industry-wide persistent fear mongering</a> about not hiring “secretly incompetent people,” has become a game divorced from meaningfully judging individual experience and impact. Most tech interviews are as relevant to job performance as if hiring a baker required interviewing them about how electron orbitals bind worked gluten together then rejecting bakers who don’t immediately draw a valid orbital configuration.</p>
<p>I remember fully giving up on ever interviewing at Google after an interviewer just barked graph theory questions through a low quality speakerphone with their laptop right next to the microphone so all you could hear is loud typing and an angry man complaining you aren’t solving their irrelevant questions fast enough. The entire industry just kinda accepts candidates should have negative and personally degrading interview experiences where candidates are undermined by some vague sense of social superiority from the interviewers. Sure, it would be great to have big tech $30,000 per day comp packages, but they long ago decided to prefer <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/PPC/comments/1cd862u/the_men_who_killed_google_search/">hiring the wrong people</a> passing the right tests instead actually evaluating people around experience and capability and ambition.</p>

</video>
<p>The weirdest part of watching the tech interview landscape change over the past 20 years is it keeps getting worse everywhere all in the same ways.</p>
<p>“big tech” created the concept of “the coding test” as the primary interview criteria. Why? Google was founded under the mindset of being a “Post-Grad-School Grad School” so they demand everybody pass a mini secondary GRE to walk amongst their austere big wrinkle brain ranks. Soon after Google became successful, the founders joked they wouldn’t be able to pass a Google interview test anymore. Yeah, real funny guys, making a system so selective for anti-ability where useful people can’t even get in the door anymore, great job everybody.</p>
<p>Now, every company from 3 person speculative startups to 50,000 person big tech firms all use <em>the same hiring practices</em> which seems between somewhat inefficient to outright overbearing. In what world should I put in the same effort to join a zero-growth, unprofitable company going out of business in 3 years compared to joining a multi-trillion-dollar company paying 30x the compensation of a startup?</p>
<p>Much like how every company copied the google “big tech big interview over 6-12 weeks” cycle, companies have added an additional interview step copied from Amazon: the “behavioral interview” curse (also see: “the bar raiser curse” as well).</p>
<p>As far as I can tell, the “behavioral interview” is essentially the same as a <a href="https://www.scientology.org/what-is-scientology/the-practice-of-scientology/the-auditing-session.html">Scientology intake</a> session except, you know, for capitalism instead. You have to answer the same 8 questions at every interview around “so what would <em>you</em> do if you had a conflict at work?” where the interviewer treats you like a 5 year old learning about people for the first time instead of acknowledging you as a professional with 0.5, 1, 2, 3 decades of experience.</p>
<p>The current “behavioral interview” weirdness is somewhat of an offshoot from the original idea about “hiring for culture fit,” but traditional “culture fit” evaluation was just personal interviewer <em>vibes</em> around how candidates acted during an interview. We’ve all seen candidates who are uncooperative or excessively negative with no recourse or just weird in an anti-socially draining way, so clearly pass on actively dangerous people, but attempting to codify “is a person a good person” into call-and-response questioning is a fundamentally broken concept.</p>
<p>The actual goal of any “behavioral interview” or “culture fit” estimation is simple, but nobody ever lays it out. The goal of culture checking is <em>only</em>: determine how a candidate handles the tradeoffs between progress vs.&nbsp;kindness.</p>
<p>A secondary goal of the “behavioral interview” is personality homogenization where companies want to enforce not hiring anybody “too different” from their current mean personality engram. Yet, the tech industry is historically full of weird divergent people doing great things for their own reasons (though, due to just basic population growth over the past 20 years, there are tens of millions more “normie computer people” now offsetting all the smaller pool of original “weird computer people”). When you start enforcing personality bubbles outside of <em>what</em> somebody can do, you’re just doing some sort of weird economic eugenics thing <em>(make programming weird again!)</em>.</p>
<p>The trick with “behavioral interview” is there are no true good answers. They want to watch you squirm. The answers depend on:</p>
<ul>
<li>in your hypothetical scenarios about “resolving disagreements,” what is the power dynamic?
<ul>
<li>Am I asking the CEO why we have 50 sales people but only have 3 developers and I’d like more developers?</li>
<li>Am I criticizing an intern for blowing up the site for the 3rd week in a row when they didn’t follow documented deployment guidelines like we’ve reprimanded them for twice before?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>in your hypothetical scenarios about “tell me a time you made a mistake and apologized” relevant to anything? I’m not here to interview about my past failures, so we either make up fake “humble brag” failures or tell you about actual failures which will give you more ammunition to think less of us and tank the entire interview process?
<ul>
<li>It’s the equivalent of bad bid-side negotiators starting with “tell me the lowest price you’ll accept” which isn’t how anything in the world works at all. Interviews are about showing your best side, not trying to micromanage a list of perceived historical faults to a point where you disqualify yourself via your own confessions.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>What level of asking candidates to expose their raw past failures and arguments and disagreements just too much information? You don’t have a right to view the total perspective vortex of every decision in my life as employment criteria. If you want to guarantee team cohesion, build good teams, position managers so they have awareness of everybody’s strengths and weaknesses, and have your managers be experts in conflict resolution.</li>
<li>I think another goal of “behavioral interviews” is to show how much you enjoy compromise. There are compromise tradeoffs though. Finding middle ground between a broken solution and a working solution doesn’t leave you with a working product. Compromise can happen around opinions, but not facts. I always get the feeling interviewers want you to talk about some time you were right then gave up being right for a worse solution just so the other person/department feels better. Are we here to create good products or not?</li>
</ul>
<p>sorry, I think I just failed your behavioral interview again. Good thing I can just interview at another company. Oh, wait, every company asks the same questions and demands the same answers from the same book on “how to do interview good” and if you deviate from the expected answers in the book, no income 4 u. good luck on your unemployment journey until the employment meta changes again.</p>
<p>Looping back to a point: is there some condition when having every company continue to add more interview steps unrelated to job tasks and experience and capability and ambition and insight will just collapse the entire industry? Sorry, you’re not qualified to be a professional software developer because you wore the wrong color shirt to the interview. You should know the color buleruplange is triggering to generation delta, so you clearly are not a culture fit for this job paying $120,000 per hour, and no, we will not be looking over your 25 years of professional experience at all.</p>
<p>Companies seem to forget they are also part of, you know, the <strong>economy</strong> and people need <strong>compensation</strong> to, you know, <strong>not die</strong>, right? If you aren’t acting as an economic engine for helping the most people thrive, what is your purpose as a company?</p>
<h2 id="_everything-bagel-and-a-bag-of-chips">Everything Bagel and A Bag of Chips</h2>
<p>You’ve seen them. I’ve seen them. I call them <em>Everything Bagel</em> job descriptions.</p>
<p>They go something like — As a Software Development Engineer (SDE) at Company, Inc, you will be required to:</p>

<p>like, my dude, your single job requirements are actually 5 entire departments worth of work to be shared across a total of 20 people. yet, you see single-person job descriptions resembling this <em>all over the place</em>.</p>
<p>At some point, half the industry just gave up on the idea any technical person should specialize in anything. Just make it all up as you go along. It’s just typing, how hard can it be? You can’t just demand application developers also be part time amateur aws architects and expect good results. Experience in these roles is built over 5+ years at a time through focused work, but half the industry is now corrupted into “devops means DEVS DO OPS means OPS REQUIRES NO EXPERIENCE means NOTHING REQUIRES EXPERIENCE so FIRE OPS HIRE DEVS and just 15x ALL JOB RESPONSIBILITIES” (without any matching 15x increase in compensation, of course).</p>
<p>Such job descriptions also means: your job is physically impossible. You will always feel drained and incompetent because you can’t actually do everything everyday. You will always be behind because each of those bullet points can be multiple days of work per week just on their own (plus, how are you supposed to be productive in 35 different areas requiring months to years of experience if you actually want to be good at each task?). So, from day 1, you will already be about 4 months behind on your expected job responsibilities and you’ll never catch up. It turns into an endless game of managers and executives saying you are “underperforming” because you have 18 primary tasks, each primary task requires 4 to 20 hours of effort, and every manager wants their task done within 4 hours. You are setup to fail. What’s the point?</p>
<p>Maybe a point is some companies just shouldn’t exist if they can’t afford the fully staffed professional teams required to build and maintain their products? The worst secret in tech is amateur developers are happy to act like entry level workers across 20 arbitrary roles for years (in the absence of never having enough time to focus on building up long-term experience or best practices). You can’t get gud if you are always rushed from task to task without any chance of leveling up knowledge and capability through “deep work” as we would historically expect of professionals.</p>
<h3 id="_field-report-job-experience-notes">Field Report: Job Experience Notes</h3>
<p>Here’s some things I’ve seen in “the real world” over a couple jobs. Some minor details have been altered to protect the guilty.</p>
<p>These are just to highlight how often companies have completely broken internal practices and don’t even know it. The solutions are fairly basic, but you can only see the solutions if you have actual experience knowing how everything works in the first place (and know where experience comes from? 5, 10, 15+ years of <em>actually</em> doing focused work and <em>actually</em> building systems from the ground-up over and over and over again—it takes completely re-building something 3-5 times over anywhere from 3 months to 5 years before you actually start to be good at a task).</p>
<p>How do you document real life when real life is getting more like fiction each day?</p>
<ul>
<li>Company said their “site was slow” and they didn’t know why. I looked at their AWS metrics and the single database server running the entire company was one mysql database with 2 cores and 16 GB RAM they created 5 years ago and never touched again. Their database had grown to 3 TB on the slowest disks AWS offered plus their working set size had grown to about 50 GB. The database was at 99.99% CPU usage, and had been at 99.99% CPU consistently for the past two years based on the built-in AWS metrics. They never looked at metrics or performance because “We are a cloud native company so we don’t do low value non-product-related tasks like system administration.”
<ul>
<li>Solution: I upgraded the database instances to 64 GB ARM servers with reserved IOPS and their batch data transformation tools went from taking 16 hours to 20 minutes. Also the DB replicas went from having 4-6 weeks of replication lag (again, completely unmonitored for years) to real-time sub-second updates across regions.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Company said “their site was slow” and they didn’t know why. Turns out they had two database clusters: one for production and one for research. The research cluster had 8 instances costing $5,000 per month total. The production cluster had 2 instances costing $500 per month total. The research cluster hadn’t been used in two years.
<ul>
<li>Solution: I swapped the sizes so the production cluster now owned all the resources and the unused dev/research cluster had almost no resources. I also switched all instances to ARM so they were cheaper too. The production site went from 7 seconds for an interactive user response to 200 ms for a user response due to the increased capacity. The non-technical company owners had just accepted their system was slow for the past couple years without ever looking into possible fixes because, once again, “the cloud means we never have to manage anything. only agile story point product features matter.”</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Company had a couple custom data processing tools. Their internal data processing API tools were installed on the same 2 EC2 2-core instances as their customer-facing web servers. The data processing tools were CPU heavy and teams complained it took 20 hours to run a full processing batch.
<ul>
<li>Solution: I moved the data processing tools to dedicated containers for auto-scaling via ECS-on-EC2 instances (using fastest EC2 instances available too instead of deprecated EC2 instances like their web servers) and it immediately auto-scaled up to <em>20 to 50 concurrent containers</em> for processing live data instead of being stuck on 2 previous outdated servers only. The data processing times went from 20 hours to 30 minutes. They had been running the previous “only deploy internal APIs on our two 2-core web servers” pattern for 7 years.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>More fun AWS architecture things at various companies like fixing subnet-vs-NAT-gateway deployments to save companies a thousand dollars a day just by altering network paths to avoid NAT gateway fees. Companies often don’t realize AWS isn’t hands off “zero-experience needed magic cloud;” AWS is actually “datacenter as a service” and if you don’t have experience managing datacenters and network architecture and disks and a dozen other system-level platform architectures then your AWS account is probably in a bad state.</li>
<li>Many common things across companies where they just did work 5 years ago and never updated their systems for <a href="https://matt.sh/python-project-structure-2024">modern practices</a>. If you see people using <code>requirements.txt</code> in the wild instead of a <code>poetry</code> lock file or you see people using the decades-long broken python built-in logging framework instead of <code>loguru</code> you can see there’s opportunities for improvement everywhere (amusingly (or sadly) every seven-figure-comp-AI-developer project I see from “big tech labs” are all using amateur python programming practices from 10+ years ago and they don’t even realize it or care to fix it. 🤷‍♂️).</li>
<li>Company said their tool for extracting production data from mysql into redshift went from taking 40 hours last year to taking 80 hours this year and it continues to slow down by the month.
<ul>
<li>Problem: I ran their extraction script and it just did nothing. I added more logging. It did nothing. I added even more logging. The script stalled on startup at trying to <code>SELECT COUNT(*) FROM &lt;table with 3 billion rows&gt;</code> —&nbsp;this step took <em>11 hours</em> alone because the “Senior Lead Data Scientist” who wrote this system (with 6 months of experience in charge of the entire department) didn’t know how databases or AWS or networking work at all (and wasn’t given permission from management to actually learn everything or focus on fixing problems over time when making the data transfer utility). Also, after the 11 hour <code>COUNT(*)</code> completed, they used the count result to <em>only determine the maximum value</em> to run a custom loop of <code>SELECT * FROM &lt;table&gt; LIMIT N OFFSET K</code> where they would write every result to the network EBS storage as a CSV in <code>N</code> batches, then load the CSV and re-save it as <code>.csv.gz</code> to EBS, then re-read the <code>.csv.gz</code> from EBS to upload it to S3. You can’t do this. It makes no sense if you have any experience building complex systems inside AWS (EBS is toxic for reads and writes like that, never create a system doing thousands of micro-writes and micro-reads to/from EBS) or even with mysql from 30 years ago. Also, this pattern of “count all, walk entire table with limit/offset” had made its way into a dozen other internal utilities at the company (copy/paste development ftw) so we had to track down <em>every</em> place it was used to do custom refactors for proper database cursor and streaming write logic everywhere.</li>
<li>Solution: I introduced them to the concept of “database cursors” so you don’t run an 11 hour <code>COUNT(*)</code> up front. Then you don’t have to abuse <code>LIMIT/OFFSET</code> queries. I introduced them to streaming S3 writes with in-line in-memory compression to avoid writing anything to EBS at all. The extraction process went from 80 hours to <strong>40 minutes</strong>. Yet, the company still said they “don’t need to hire people with experience because everything is cloud native so anybody can just figure things out.” — This company tolerated a year of 80 hour data imports because “cloud native” means “experience doesn’t matter” and they didn’t have anybody in the entire company to even detect the problem because “only product features matter, we don’t want to hire low value sysadmins.”</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Company has $10 million in funding and an initial boost of customers trying their products, then the customers start to go away. The solution to customers leaving, as mandated by the fail-upward VCs controlling the company: “hire more sales people.” So, over two years, the company expands their sales and marketing team to 50 people while keeping developer count fixed at 5 people. Eventually, the sales people haven’t closed a sale in 10 months (because the product is so weak nobody wants to buy it), so the solution is to continue the VC demands of hiring 3 more sales people per week plus start laying off developers because the VC mandate is “only sales matter, the product doesn’t matter, sales people can sell anything.”</li>
<li>Various variations on the above theme of “sales above all else” where companies double down on an idea that worked 2-5 years prior but is now just a dead idea in a dead company, but management refuses to expand or “pivot” their product to meet the market. These companies always fail due to executives just doubling down on their personal “executive genius” while developers are screaming “you aren’t letting us build products people actually want…”
<ul>
<li>Historical note: I’ve only worked at startups or initial idea attempted “scale-up” companies, so now my resume is now just a series of 5 completely dead companies nobody cares about, which looks great for applying to jobs. Dead companies doesn’t mean dead useless experience though, yah? Is it my fault I can’t get hired at good companies? I don’t know. It’s not my fault companies fail though. I try to help, but when VC brain disease runs all companies into the ground instead of prioritizing building good products on high performance platforms, there’s only so much you can do before leaving dying companies (then repeat at the next dying company forever?).</li>
</ul></li>
<li>On the same theme of corporate priority: rudderless companies often end up in a situation where they are so desperate for sales, they try to incentivize the sales people with outsized commission packages valued at 200% to 500% of what developers in the company make (meet your sales goals for a seven figure bonus! sorry, developers don’t have a bonus program because the company only cares about sales, but how about another 0.0003% in dead equity after our 3rd down round?). At this point, there’s no value in remaining at a company if sales people are making more than people creating the product(s).</li>
<li>I’ve rejected candidates during interviews too, so I’m not running around advocating <em>everybody</em> should be hired blindly. I’ve seen multiple candidates who refuse to turn on their camera even though it was listed as a remote job with such expectations. You start to think HR just let too many scammers through. One said “I am not allowed to turn my camera on because I have a pact with my husband I am not allowed to be seen on the Internet” (this person also sent a <em>30 page</em> resume which looked like “i do everything, so hire me” from a contractor remote job scam harvesting operation). Another no-cam person said they were “in transit” and refused to turn on a camera even though they were calling through the Zoom app. Sometimes you also have people who just apply too high and hope to get through. We had one person apply for a Senior Python Data Engineer role and they couldn’t name any version of python (they said “something like 2 or 3? i don’t know.”) — those details matter when huge language features and behaviors change once a year with every major point release! don’t be bringing your outdated Python 3.7 sand castle to my Python 3.12 cathedral.</li>
<li>Company founder/CTO who just gets bored on the weekends and starts personally modifying things, breaking live services, then demands developers immediately all go to the office Saturdays at 6pm to fix what he broke because “the company is down.”</li>
<li>Company with bespoke internal platforms for customers where each customer needs its own codebase. The company started by just copying the previous customer codebase into a new customer codebase the first time this happened. Then it happened again and again. Now, 7 years later, the company has 12 repositories all doing 95% the same thing with 5% custom code per customer type. Due to their process being “copy the most recent codebase into a new repo,” the 12 repos have 12 different package lock files and 36 different container deployment strategies ((dev, prod, testing) * 12) and use 5 different versions of Python and each codebase has fragments of bugs sometimes fixed and sometimes not across all the repos.
<ul>
<li>Solution: enough is enough, I gave everybody two days off and just ran through 20 hours of aggressively merging and validating everything into one repository with one package lock file under the most modern python version with 3 clean container deployment strategies covering all customers at once (plus getting type safety checks added everywhere, making common shared modules instead of copy/paste everywhere, centralizing metrics and reporting instead of ad-hoc hand-written output everywhere).</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Company in California with a motto of “never hire Americans because 16 year old outsourced Croatian interns know everything already” asked me to review their architecture. It wasn’t great. Their entire platform was built on 7 year old ubuntu EC2 instances that hadn’t been rebooted in 5 years. They technically had logging, but they had no alerting and no metrics. They basically only looked into product problems if customers complained (but customer complaints had to go through the “account manager” to the “product team” to the “product manager” to the “project manager” before developers would be notified of problems).
<ul>
<li>Solution: I added a combination of EventBridge hooks triggering Lambda Functions to post live AWS service warnings directly into a chat channel. I added a log parser so they would also get real time application notices/warnings via chat when customers were seeing broken features. I added metrics to a dozen of their internal microservices and setup an “infinite scale” prometheus/victoriametrics cluster to collect and log and alert and graph trends over time. The company thought they had 10,000 users per day based on what their Croatian interns were telling the CEO based on a dozen of their front-end-only javascript/spyware analytics plugins, but my internal metrics showed only 300 users per day actually used the backend APIs. great job, everybody! The alerts also showed the company when the CEO’s brother would do things like delete all user data by mistake at 7am (remember to always give your family members full root admin access to all services so they can use generic desktop app database GUIs to edit user data directly, who cares if they delete users or corrupt data all the time?). The alerts also showed fun things like when the “Data Science Team” would write SQL queries over a small 64k row table yet mistakenly generate 12 billion rows of results due to how they wrote 5-level-nested JSON cross product column extraction queries (show me a love story more true than data science people adding nested JSON columns to relational databases).</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The saddest part is when companies <em>have a good chance</em> at surviving a mild downtrend, but either remain so committed to the past or too committed to executive dysfunction where nobody can steer towards a more reality-based future-oriented product direction. I’ve seen companies making $5 million a month in revenue just evaporate over 3 years because their original idea falls out of popularity and the executives refuse to adapt to better ideas. I’ve seen companies go from a billion in funding to being sold for parts because the CEO is too busy buying horses to keep his wife happy instead of actually running the company. I’ve seen companies just give up and get acquired by some big tech because the CEO was offered a personal $100 million gift when he agrees to the acquisition, then 90% of the company is let go after the acquisition. Feels great to work forever on the zero-reward side of a winner-take-most-but-the-winner-aint-you professional economy.</li>
</ul>
<p>Perhaps the saddest thing is it looks like I am a full time architecture-only, no-product-value person, but it’s only because everybody else in these companies has no architecture experience and doesn’t care to learn. Sure, I have 20 years of experience is datacenter build-outs and system architecture and high performance platforms, so when all these modern “cloud native” companies insist on only hiring “app dev javascript” employees without any real platform building experience, we see why all these modern “cloud native” orgs end up with completely broken infrastructure (at least until somebody who has actually accomplished something shows up to fix everything for them—most of these places are stuck in a loop of “we don’t know what we don’t know” so they are unaware of even the right questions to ask or the right systems to build in the first place).</p>
<p>I don’t know about you, but I care about company structure, product issues, platform scalability and reliability, customer usability, developer usability, performance, legal compliance, security, corporate scalability, and team cohesion all at the same time. These are issues which don’t appear on your story point burndown boards because they are cross-functional improvements across multiple departments. Somehow constantly improving and fixing and making everything better in ways nobody else can seem to do isn’t enough to get through a company’s hiring cycle these days though.</p>
<p>Also amusing: I think people will have different reactions to the block of anecdotes above. People will either be “heck yeah fix all the things!” or people will side with “you are clearly incompetent because you didn’t use ‘We’ statements anywhere and you only talked about how you did all the work yourself.” Well, for one these are just highlights. and, for two, there’s only so much “We” you can bring into every task when your team is 4 people having 16 months of tickets backlog’d with management mandating daily story point accounting updates. When you can do individual optimization tasks 3x to 5x faster than sharing the work (no need for synchronizing meetings and knowledge and project setup duplicated across 5 people) sometimes just doing the work and moving on is the best use of resources. We don’t have time to stop the entire product roadmap for “everybody on technical staff fixes everything” because the company refuses to build out actual infrastructure and platform teams (thanks, <em>devops mind virus</em>), so we end up with “single capable person doing the work of what should be 20 people across 5 departments alone” patterns. Sometimes good is just good and you get the work done by <em>doing the f’ing work</em> by any means necessary.</p>

<p>What used to be as simple as “i good wit commputr. u giv jorb?” is now a synthetic convoluted social status driven hierarchy of mind games just to get an initial interview then you are treated as a blank slate having to prove you can even read and write and speak from first principles.</p>
<p>Most interview processes don’t even consider a person’s actual work and experience and capability. You must always open your brain live in front of people to dump out immediate answer to a series of pointless problems because if you can’t solve a pointless problem with no preparation you clearly can’t do anything of value for the rest of your life.</p>
<p>Most of the interview tricks in use now are being repeated by people who learned “how to do interview” from books or 15 year old online interview guides. Modern interviewers don’t seem to always have the full picture of what they are even trying to accomplish from the interview. I was there when people made all these things up the first time in 2006-2009. You are trying to use trickery on me which we made up to stop people less capable than us, and now we are trapped having to constantly prove we aren’t scams when we <em>clearly aren’t scams</em> but nobody trust provable history anymore. Do not cite the Deep Magic to me, Witch — I was there when it was written.</p>
<p>Is my <a href="https://github.com/mattsta/mpreg">distributed hierarchical topological sort automatic dependency resolver data processing system</a> not relevant to experience?</p>
<p>Are my personal <a href="https://matt.sh/crcspeed">improvements to CRC processing</a> not relevant to experience? This work got included by global file formats and people have also decided to use my code to help validate information from the space station. Sorry, it doesn’t count towards any interview capability score though.</p>
<p>What about <a href="https://github.com/mattsta/icli">a CLI for stock market trading both manually and with automation</a> I’ve been noodling on for a couple years and keep improving by the month? Sorry, not relevant to showing your capability, you must reproduce the answer to our toy problem about moving chess pieces through a grid world in 20 minutes or else we think you are just incompetent<a href="#_fn5" id="_fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a>.</p>
<p>(rebuttal people will make: but those are just <em>tasks</em> and those do not illustrate your love for the entire SDLC? did you even assign story poker t-shirt burndown points to tasks? do you even create issues before every change so every commit has an issue number then every commit becomes a PR then every PR goes through CI then is merged after a code review? you can’t just “do things” without 18 management steps between every task!)</p>

<p>Somehow the entire technical industry continues to coalesce around social/political status and power instead of actual experience and ability. You’ve created software used by millions of people? Your software has been resold by every “cloud” for the past 10 years? Sorry, we can’t hire you because you didn’t espouse sufficient emotional loyalty to our One True Founder Kier Eagan. Good luck with your sad little life creating things people use because we only pay for cult loyalists here and you don’t socially qualify. The goal of hiring should be to create more of an <em>us</em> atmosphere and stop excluding people by dreaming up unnecessary technicality trivialities —&nbsp;be an <em>us</em> for once instead of a <em>them!</em></p>

<p>How do we try to exist when we need income, but almost all jobs have become impossible fantasy roles overloaded with divergent tasks trying to cram 5 departments worth of concurrent work into single people? Is it time to rip up our tech industry membership cards and just leave all the roles to overworked amateurs who only know the broken world since they haven’t ever seen a functioning company with professionals in single-purpose professional roles? I don’t know anymore.</p>
<h2 id="_conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Is the rambling complete? Has the stream of consciousness flow terminated?</p>
<p>Of course none of these are <em>unique to me</em> problems. As we started out on this article: the industry broke all the jobs because of too much tech speculation tied to speculative funding, so the funding went away, then the customers went away, now the jobs are gone. We have hundreds of thousands of developers not getting their “tech industry” level salaries anymore, so who am I to whine?</p>
<p>Well, I’m me and this is my site, so neener neener you can’t stop me. It’s a problem for all of us and we speak for all the worms.</p>
<p>The tech roles at most companies are completely busted it seems. I didn’t sign up to be a “software servant” to non-technical product teams who just define tasks and priorities for actually capable people to implement every day. Somewhere along the way the entire industry lost its heart and now most companies are more interested in “playing company” instead of actually carving out created creative contraptions? There is a thing called “Engineering-led management” where, imagine this, the people <em>doing the work</em> are also the ones <em>defining the product</em> and <em>talking to users</em> and <em>defining requirements</em> while <em>implementing features</em> all themselves. You can’t create good products if you have less capable “product idea people” controlling implementation capability. Office Space wasn’t supposed to be our destiny.</p>
<p>I’m probably actually fairly bad at being a single-purpose “SWE SDE SRE” or whatever weird made-up excessively narrow titles people have <a href="https://matt.sh/self-esteem-murder-post-is-out-2022">contrived now</a>. It’s about building products and growing companies, which is difficult to impact when you’re given the mushroom treatment at 90% of companies unable to impact actual organizational and product change (because “know your place, <em>low value menial developer</em>, you just do what the superior <em>project management</em> and <em>ceo vc family executives</em> tell you to do, you can’t actually make decisions or improve usability or have ideas to expand products and fix company problems yourself. you aren’t the right <a href="https://matt.sh/new-developer-shapes">shaped person</a> to make decisions here!”). where is the developer azor ahai to right the world and tip the balance of power back to a majority of productive developers making decisions?</p>
<p>At some point, a switch flipped in the tech job market and “programmer jobs” just turned into zero-agency task-by-task roles working on other people’s ideas under other people’s priorities to accomplish other people’s goals. I feel tech employment was originally more focused around being given problems to find solutions from a “whole business view” then you did everything to generate products and solutions using your best judgment towards a deadline goal without being micromanaged every step of the way (because nobody else knew what you were doing or how to do it to even <em>attempt</em> to micromanage you). When did developers stop being part of the actual product creation process and instead just become <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@durbinmalonster/video/7104742170426641710">“project management task workers?”</a> The nexus of tech industry employee agency destruction seems to be centered around post-2010 tech “elite value capture” where the weirdos who would normally aspire to work on wall street for “quick riches” instead decided they could get rich by just being “thought leaders” to exploit technology. It’s difficult to believe non-technical “idea people” have any relevant capacity to control technical project direction over a long term sustainability horizon. You create good products by creating <em>and</em> using products <em>at an implementation level</em> because products you use and products <em>you personally write</em> are products you have the largest insight into improving the best and the fastest.</p>
<p>How do we deal with professional income inequality where the same role and effort pays $400/day at one company but $20,000/day at another company? At what point is it worth not even working if your compensation doesn’t work out to being at least $10,000 per day anymore? Do we just sit here and die in our overpriced studio apartments where rent increases 7% every year while other ICs doing the same work at better companies are buying 5 vacation houses from doing the same work?</p>
<p>The worst feeling is comparison. Comparison is the death of happiness, as they say. I look at my own place in the world compared to people who just started at Apple or Microsoft 20 years ago then never left, and now they have made eight figures just over the past 4 years while my life path has lead me to… practically nothing. Then the tech inequality continues to compound. Imagine joining a company where the teenage interns have already made a couple million off their passive stock grants and other employees have been making $2MM to $6MM per year over the past 5 years there, while you’re starting over with nothing again for the 5th company in a row so what’s the point in even trying<a href="#_fn6" id="_fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a>. Though, did you know paying rent on a credit card still qualifies for points? Made $60 this month paying rent with credit card point rebates<a href="#_fn7" id="_fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a>. whoops.</p>
<p>What’s next? Who knows. Maybe aliens will blow up the sun to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmological_lithium_problem">strip mine all our solar lithium for their alien hive mind batteries</a> or something.</p>
<h3 id="_whats-worth-working-on">What’s Worth Working On</h3>
<p>Out of all the jobs available, it’s surprising how many of them aren’t the best thing to be doing. As we covered above, you usually want to work at a specific <em>type</em> of company (if you can) to get those $10k to $50k per day rates instead of being stuck at unprofitable companies only paying $400/day salary with no usable equity.</p>
<p>What’s actually worth working on though? Let’s do a rundown.</p>
<p>I have an interesting experiment in using <a href="https://matt.sh/transformer-stock-tracking-demos">non-tokenized inputs to transformer architectures</a> which can be expanded to essentially creating conscious AI robots using arbitrary sensor data from cameras and microphones and encoders, but it would take a couple million united states freedom bucks to build working prototypes.</p>
<p>It’s sad seeing so many broken products in the world while companies refuse to hire you. Here’s a sample of broken things one of those eight figure comp employees (or ten figure comp executives) should have fixed already just from looking at my immediate surroundings (which seems fairly one-sided):</p>
<ul>
<li>iTunes (Apple Music macOS App?) still has a broken UI. Current bugs include: when you “favorite” a song, it often just stops playing all music. When you tap the “back” button in album navigation, it doesn’t do anything the first click, but the second click sends you back two pages. You can’t go back one page at a time, you can only click once for no action then click again to go back two pages. Do the people creating these things not use them?</li>
<li>Still Apple Music App related: the whole information management design architecture around library organization is stuck in 2001. There are so many more useful and creative and impactful ways we could empower users to discover, remix, share, and experience their music libraries besides “one spreadsheet view with tiny icons in rows.” Did Apple run out of ideas and ambition and a drive for creating a better future?</li>
<li>Apple’s entire Feedback system didn’t get any better after they renamed it Feedback. Apple (market cap: $3.5 trillion currently) treats customers like unpaid interns expecting customers to just give them free troubleshooting work with no <em>cooperative internal feedback</em> on reported issues for months or years. Who is managing this? Why has the reporting process been bad for decades? We can fix these things.</li>
<li>Apple’s macOS Control Center app widget constantly uses 1% to 2% CPU (across <em>millions of machines</em>) because it redraws itself 1,000 times per second even though it is always off-screen and completely hidden from the user. This has been known and reported for about two years now, but nobody cares to fix it. Is this one of those things where the developers care, but project management doesn’t understand the problem, so it can never be “prioritized” as a fix?</li>
<li>Why did Apple go with such a weak Vision Pro launch of release-then-abandon? They could have made a dozen more first party world changing productivity experiences instead of expecting independent app developers to just show up and spend millions of dollars developing for a maximum risk minimum reward platform. Really curious how we ended up with “just give them a computer hat with no mind-blowing world-changing app advances” instead of the magic we usually expect from Apple launches? Though, the last iPhone update’s main selling point was basically “we converted a toggle switch to a button” so who even knows anymore? Here’s some free ideas:
<ul>
<li>Really show off the dynamic ability for space occupation for massive data exploration.
<ul>
<li>provide a default professional-level stock market application where people can create a 30 window view of 30 live symbols for real time decisions all positioned in living space</li>
<li>provide a default data exploration application to show off displaying 10 to 50 metrics series charts at once (server metrics, business metrics, anything with a chart; think “Keynote for Time-Series Data”)</li>
<li>spatial AI LLM visualizations capable of showing diverging language output trees for alternate completion paths all around you</li>
<li>spatial geometry understanding environments for beginner, intermediate, advanced stages — so much of math is just <em>figuring out what it looks like in your own head</em> (remember the joke about Windows ships with Minesweeper while Macs ship with Chess? or Macs have a Graphing Calculator by default? Continue bringing advanced educational tools back into the mac ecosystem by default).</li>
<li>spatial explorations of high-dimensional data with zooming in/out/up/down multiple dimensions of spaces to explore geometric surroundings for more data interpretation capabilities</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Wii-Fit-like environments for active mobility engagement</li>
<li>spatial theremin</li>
<li>spatial + AI cooking with ingredient identification and in-view instructions</li>
<li>headshare: just outright swap cameras with somebody else (or maybe as a spatial window showing other people’s live camera feed(s))</li>
<li>remember the face swap app? do live head swaps. fun for the whole family.</li>
<li>live streamed spatial concert experiences</li>
<li>live spatial animal species detector</li>
<li>spatial physics / cosmology simulations</li>
<li>spatial where’s waldo object detector (“where are my keys?” then using AI/machine vision it locates key-shaped objects for you)</li>
<li>spatial knowledge graph navigation (think: view wikipedia, but every link is exploded into a contextual spatial window for easy jumping between)</li>
<li>spatial Apple Intelligence®™¢£ assistant in 3d space where the agent model <em>also</em> draws the assistant’s puppet/creature visual state so it is, effectively, alive</li>
<li>and so much more!</li>
</ul></li>
<li>It’s interesting how Mac Safari uses touch id to “protect” private browsing mode windows, but there’s still half a dozen bugs encountered through basic Safari usage. If I can hit so many bugs constantly, how is an entire company of people using the browser not finding and fixing these bugs every single day?</li>
<li>Apple’s iOS performance degradation. Typing on my iPhone 15 Pro Max is slower than typing on my iPhone 13 Pro Max. Why? I don’t know. The keyboard misses taps all the time where my previous 3-year-older phone feels about twice as responsive when typing. What did they break and why don’t they care?</li>
<li>Why does GitHub continue to make some features worse worse? They changed the home feed from useful details to less useful details and now instead of instantly loading, it shows you a 3-9 second loading spinner saying “One moment please…” — multi-second loading spinners on every page refresh is a really damaged user experience.</li>
<li>Another GitHub trick: look at a repo page logged in vs.&nbsp;logged out. They are using different page templates for logged in vs logged out users and it just looks like a mistake. GitHub has been fairly silent when it comes to addressing any user experience regressions over the past couple years.</li>
<li>Obviously there are dozens of high-impact, high-reward, low-timeline projects to be created or improved in modern AI Lab companies, but “AI Companies” seem to only want to hire 28 year olds with a PhD from Stanford who have worked at Google for 5 years. No real way to get a foot in the door unless you’re related to somebody there already from what I can tell. Sure, they say “you don’t have enough experience,” but what does “experience” mean when half the work they do is making completely new things nobody has ever made before anyway?</li>
<li>There’s tons of work to be explored in practical consumer robotics applications using cost-optimized hardware strategies. I’m pretty sure my plans for a sub-$3,000 human-sized-hexapod would create a few hundred billion dollars in value if we could build it out (add +$100 trillion in value if we attach the robot AI brain to it too).</li>
<li>Various social aspects but less product oriented. How do we stop the world from collapsing? How do we fix an economy where 400 million people who aren’t already in California all want to move to California and become buzzword-driven middle managers at Google? Gotta OKR that KPI so your LTV for the TAM doesn’t go into the red.</li>
<li>What is the balance between companies spending half a trillion dollars on stock buybacks when they also aren’t consistently hiring useful people into positions of authority to improve the world?</li>
<li>People talk about American politicians never retiring, but what about tech executives too? We’re ending up with a lot of executives with 20 to 40 years at these trillion dollar companies and they aren’t moving out to give more people opportunities for advancement.</li>
</ul>
<p>just remember, the opposite of war isn’t peace: it’s creation.</p>
<p>our goal is to make something out of nothing. we need to express, to communicate, to go against the grain —&nbsp;here’s to the crazy ones.</p>
<p>create good things. create good systems. grow products. grow economies. become like the stars.</p>
<p>raggedy man, goodnight,</p>

<li id="_fn2"><p>Oddly, this is the first time in modern history where government interest rate increases haven’t also increased the deposit interest rate for consumer checking accounts.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><h2>Epilogue</h2>

<p>A few days ago I had to replace the old IP camera I use to watch over my dogs and cats, and found out that IP cam technology changed a lot since I bought that old camera. IP cameras are now low-price and ubiquitous. I bought one of those generic models and installed it at my home, expecting to use the same software and network configuration I used before. However, these new cameras do not work the same way. They didn't gave me the same control I had over the old model.</p>

<p>This is the "wonderful" world of P2P camera. My old camera worked by providing an internet webserver where I should connect to receive the images. Simple, but a pain in the ass when you want to access your camera from outside your home LAN. P2P camera are different: Instead of you connecting to the camera, the camera itself connects to a server, and, to see the images, you need to connect your phone to the same server. No matter where you are in the world, if you have an internet connection, you can still receive your camera images. Buuuuut... Despite being easier to configure, this simplicity seemed to also bring some security concerns, and I gave up installing this thing at my home. However, that presented a good opportunity for reverse engineering a third party hardware, and maybe I could even get into the guts of the camera and change the things I didn't like in it.</p>

<p>This series of posts will document this analysis. This is a work in progress. I will add new posts whenever I advance in this study</p>

<h2>Discovering the camera</h2>

<p>Here is the little thing:</p>
<p><img alt="camera" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="dc381684-2d55-4777-b756-ebc5a76cf5df" src="https://dalpix.com/sites/default/files/inline-images/camera.jpg"></p><p>This first difficulty was to find information about the camera. Despite having a company logo printed on its front, I could not find any information about this company on Google. I found several identical cameras being sold online, but under different brands, all of them seem to be Chinese names. The camera box and manual didn't gave any useful information either, on regarding identifying the manufacturer website. It seems there's no easy way to get in touch with them e receive technical support</p>

<p>According to the manual, the only way to configure and operate the camera is by installing an app in your phone. The configuration sequence is:</p>

<ul><li>Power up the camera. Since it is not yet configured, it will create an internet WiFi network, used only for configuration</li>
	<li>Launch the app on your phone. It will find the WiFi network created by the camera and connect to it</li>
	<li>The app will ask your WiFi (home) network name and password. It will send this data to the camera</li>
	<li>The camera connects to Internet using your WiFi and notifies the manufacturer server that it is alive</li>
	<li>The app connects also to the server and now you can control your camera</li>
</ul><p>Ok. But now I don't want to rely on an external server, so let's dig on how the camera work and try to change that</p>

<p>The fist thing is to find if the camera operating system provides a terminal connection, like SSH, so I could control the camera. Using nmap to see if there's any port open:</p>
<p><img alt="nmap" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="01ebe1fc-c343-4b46-938b-bf3141072866" src="https://dalpix.com/sites/default/files/inline-images/nmap.png"></p><p>nmap founds 2 open TCP ports (554 and 5000), neither related to SSH. 554, however, is related to RTSP, a streaming protocol. That could be an option for receiving the camera images. I'll check this later, since I still would need to discover authentication information for this protocol.</p>

<p>nmap also helps by identifying the operating system (Linux 3.X). That's also a good information, because now we know it uses an opensource OS, not any closed proprietary software that would make things way more complicated.</p>

<h2>Analyzing the network traffic</h2>

<p>Since the camera takes my WiFi password to send video and audio from my home to an external server, I believe I should understand exactly what if being done with this data. So I fired up Wireshark to analyze the data transferred during the whole camera setting up procedures</p>

<p>A lot to dislike here. The camera is connecting to a lot of servers that I don't think it should. I have no idea why my camera would need to connect to Google, Alibaba or Facebook, but it is, at least, trying to resolve those addresses via DNS.</p>

<p>One interesting thing: The app informs that there's an update available for the camera firmware. So, probably, the camera figured out this by connecting to its manufacturer server, and the app is asking me if I'll allow the installation. By monitoring the traffic, I see the camera is checking this address: http://upg.cloudlinks.cn/api/device/checkupgrade.ashx?ApiVersion=1&amp;DeviceVersion=419430406&amp;KeyID=73dd8ec6718551f970cdcefd8ec77826&amp;CustomerNO=0</p>

<p>Which returns the following json data:</p>
<p><img alt="update" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="fc6bd6a1-b75f-45ba-87c9-e12490794393" src="https://dalpix.com/sites/default/files/inline-images/update.png"></p><p>So that's the URL for the new firmware version. I can easily download it. However, the manufactures doesn't want anybody spying on its software, so the firmware file is encoded. I'll try to find out how to decode this later. Let's go back to the video stream.</p>

<p>The server receiving my video is easy to identify on Wireshark. Once the camera connects, a lot of data is sent to this IP. However, every time the camera is restarted, a different server is used. The camera probably has a list of several servers it can use, and selects one from this list from time to time. One of them is this:</p>
<p><img alt="server" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="0c2b806f-b03d-4c35-bf8c-f6235eb760b9" src="https://dalpix.com/sites/default/files/inline-images/servidor%20que%20recebe%20o%20video.png"></p><p>Maybe I should be concerned of my video and audio being sent to China, maybe not. I don't know, but I'd rather it not being sent to any other country, since I'm right next to the camera, it could send directly to me. So, let's continue</p>

<p>After configuration, data is initially sent via to a server listening on UDP port 8000. This seems to be an initial connection, maybe the camera and the server use it for some initial handshake. Actual video seems to be sent to UDP port 51892, since the biggest packages go to this port. One interesting thing is that it seems to send a lot of empty data. I would expect a good data compression here, since we're transmitting video to the other side of the world, but this protocol doesn't seem to be very efficient in terms of saving network traffic:</p>
<p><img alt="zeroes" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="799ce152-333e-42a3-9c3b-dcfaf7576236" src="https://dalpix.com/sites/default/files/inline-images/zeroes.png"></p><p>So, I would like to understand more about this protocol, but now I'll be focusing on accessing this Linux system, which I'll try on <a href="https://dalpix.com/reverse-engineering-ip-camera-part-2">part 2 of this a study</a></p>
