<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
			<p><span>Y</span>esterday I was rudely summoned away from a beautiful autumn day of wild foraging by The King.</p>
<p>Specifically, I was given a heads-up about one of the bills which would be in yesterday’s King’s Speech – the first of the King’s reign, and the first and only one of Rishi Sunak’s time in office.</p>
<p>The bill in question is the Investigatory Powers (Amendment) Bill, the outcome of a consultation held over the summer, which I obviously missed being out of work. (Neil Brown <a href="https://decoded.legal/blog/2023/06/consultation-on-changes-to-the-investigatory-powers-act-2016s-notices-regime/">did not miss one word</a> from his tech lawyer perspective, and TechUK <a href="https://www.techuk.org/resource/as-the-government-reviews-the-investigatory-powers-act-s-notices-regime-it-is-vital-we-maintain-proper-checks-and-balances-to-protect-privacy.html">were equally diligent</a> from the service provider perspective.) There was also an <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/independent-review-of-the-investigatory-powers-act-2016--2">independent review</a> which requires prior knowledge of the IPA.</p>
<p>The problem is that aside from the rather legalistic topics dealt with in the summer consultation and independent review, some of which do indeed have merit, the politicians have stepped in.</p>

<p>What we learned yesterday is that the Bill aims to</p>
<ul>
<li>Force technology companies to inform the Home Office in advance of security and privacy features they want to add, including encryption, and force them to disable features which the government objects to;</li>
<li>Increase the power of the Home Office to force non-UK companies to comply with changes it wants them to make to security features without the right to appeal; and</li>
<li>Require companies to comply with a notice before any requested review is completed, depriving companies of the opportunity to seek a review of the appropriateness of notices before being obliged to follow them.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://x.com/katebevan/status/1721861707868324062?s=20">The adoring public was not impressed</a>.</p>
<p>And yes, this all dovetails with the Online Safety Act, in ways I will make no attempt to parse out over morning coffee.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/654a21952f045e001214dcd7/The_King_s_Speech_background_briefing_notes.pdf">official speech souvenir handout</a> noted how these asks will be framed:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make changes to the bulk personal dataset regime to ensure the UK’s intelligence agencies can more effectively make use of less sensitive data, which is already widely available to the public, subject to appropriate safeguards</li>
<li>Expand the oversight regime to support the Investigatory Powers Commissioner to effectively carry out their role, including putting a number of their functions on a statutory basis. This will maintain the robust, transparent, and world-leading safeguards in the regime.</li>
<li>Reform the notices regime, to help the UK anticipate the risk to public safety posed by the rolling out of technology by multinational companies that precludes lawful access to data. This will reduce the risk of the most serious offences such as child sexual exploitation and abuse or terrorism</li>
<li>Update the conditions for use of Internet Connections Records to ensure that these can be used effectively to detect the most serious types of criminal activity and national security threats, underpinned by a robust independent oversight regime</li>
<li>Increase the resilience of the warrantry authorisation processes to ensure the security and intelligence agencies, as well as the National Crime Agency, can always get lawful access to information in a timely way so that they can respond to the most serious national security and organised crime threats.</li>
</ul>
<p>You’ve probably been reading this blog long enough to know how the sausage gets made. These asks, which go well beyond the hair-splitting legal minutiae of the summer consultation and of the independent review, were asks thrown in by the authoritarian wing of the Home Office, who are obviously still enraged that they failed to regulate the entire open internet around Meta via the <a href="https://webdevlaw.uk/2023/04/17/greatest-hits-b-sides-and-unfinished-demo-tracks-or-all-my-blogging-on-the-online-safety-bill/">Online Safety Act</a>.</p>
<p>And let’s state the obvious here: that’s what this is bill about.</p>
<p><em>While we don’t know what is actually in the bill, as it doesn’t exist yet</em>, <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/b9f92f62-9895-4ff4-9e4a-659d217dc9af">it’s already clear</a> that this is the latest salvo in government’s <a href="https://webdevlaw.uk/2020/12/09/facebook-derangement-syndrome/">Meta Vendetta</a>.</p>
<p>You would think that they’d have learned their lesson from spending six years crafting world-leadingly bad legislation around the obsession with getting one company, its suite of products, and its executive leadership (which just happens to include their former political enemy number one).</p>
<p>But this is Conservative digital policymaking we’re talking about. <a href="https://x.com/WebDevLaw/status/1721066591641592255?s=20">It learns nothing from its mistakes</a>.</p>
<p>So without knowing the contents, one thing’s for sure: the sharpest minds on these issues across law, policy, tech, and digital rights need to saddle up for yet another year of going into government meetings, in good faith, with notes prepared and talking points honed, so that they can be shouted at for 58 minutes about Meta, and leave with nothing accomplished.</p>
<p>Plus ça change.</p>
<p>And while everyone obviously needs to show up for this Bill, and yes that includes the people who don’t show up for anything because “politics”, it’s also worth remembering the <em>actual</em> politics of the thing.</p>
<p>First, we will be having a general election no later than January 2025, one which is going to wipe the Conservatives into the third party. That’s why the King’s Speech was so strikingly <em>meh</em>: it’s all tinkering and technocracy to fill twelve months of time, as opposed to the post-EU revolutionary bombast we’ve seen in recent years. And while the public knows full well that the Conservatives are openly shitting the bed on their way out, knowing it will be someone else’s responsibility to change the sheets, they’re not dumb. And certainly not about a bill like this.</p>
<p>Second, while the Home Office has been a rogue outfit for a long time, it’s currently headed by a racist lunatic who, by all accounts from the Westminster gossip chain, is <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-67344806">deliberately trolling the town</a> <em>so that</em> she can <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/nov/08/tory-insiders-suggest-suella-braverman-trying-to-get-sacked">get sacked</a> <em>so that</em> she can work up her leadership challenge to Rishi Sunak. (Yes, there are people who dream of a Braverman-led UK and a Trump-led US. They work hard. They’re working right now.) And what better way to gum up the works for your political rival, who’s riding high on the global AI summit he led last week, than by introducing a law that would <a href="https://x.com/marypcbuk/status/1722003706332209653?s=20">make it impossible</a> for anyone anywhere to do any tech of any kind?</p>
<p>By the way, if you think it isn’t possible for the integrity of the open internet to fall victim, via bad legislation, to backstabbing Tory power grabs, what do you think I’ve been working on since 2016? Like I said. This garbage is what the sharpest tech policy minds in the UK have been dealing with for seven years. Not the work they were born to do.</p>
<p>So while we wait for the IP(A)A to be published, let’s all read up, form up, strategise, and get this right, so that what’s good about the IP(A)A gets sorted and what’s bad about the IP(A)A gets put in the bin. Quickly, cleanly, and definitively.</p>
<p>Look on the bright side: you’ve just had six years of practice.</p>
<p>An aside because fuck yeah I am going there: the IPA and IPCO were one of four disparate policy portfolios I held in my brief stint in a digital rights organisation, on a salary of £28k per year, a salary which in the end they could not sustain for an entire year. Imagine getting up to speed with all of that, above, back to front, including building a relationship with IPCO all for nothing, on a few hours a month, for net pay of less than £500 pcm for that work, in a work environment which was, as they say, suboptimal. It is well past time to have the ugly conversation about how the resourcing and leadership of UK digital rights organisations is failing to contribute to the solution and, indeed, is now becoming part of the problem. </p>

<p>When Anna Carin Elf arrived at her workplace in Gothenburg, she immediately realized something was not right. She works at a library, and she was greeted by several visitors, just like any other day. But this was not any other day — the library was supposed to be closed.</p>



<p>“They were surprised. They thought it was a bit empty,” <a href="https://www.dn.se/sverige/biblioteket-var-stangt-lanade-bocker-anda/">she says</a>. “The people in the library behaved as usual. Many were sitting reading newspapers, some families were in the children’s section and others were searching for books on the computer.”</p>




<p>The library was supposed to be closed for All Saints Day — a celebration sometimes also called <a href="https://www.zmescience.com/feature-post/culture/culture-society/a-short-history-of-halloween/">All Hallows Day, the precursor of Halloween</a>. But the library staff had forgotten to close a door. So people came in, thinking the library was open. Some visitors <a href="https://www.gp.se/kultur/kultur/arvid-var-en-av-hundratals-inne-p%C3%A5-ol%C3%A5sta-biblioteket-1.114743762">realized the library</a> was technically closed and went home, but others did not.</p><!-- Tag ID: zmescience_300x250_InContent -->
 





<p>As people were coming in and out of the library, one librarian (Elf) walked by and noticed the people using the library. She realized what was happening, called her manager and a colleague, and then announced that the library was closing. The visitors calmly folded their books closed and left. </p>



<p>But some left with books.</p><!-- Tag ID: zmescience_300x250_InContent_3 -->




<p>During that day, 446 people visited the city library. A total of 246 books were borrowed. To date, all the books have been returned.</p>



<p>Through a door mistakenly left ajar, the people of Gothenburg demonstrated the power of community and the value they place on the guardianship of shared resources. It was a quiet revolution, an act of civil responsibility that spoke volumes, reaffirming the notion that a library is much more than a building; it is a cornerstone of community, education, and trust.</p>



<p>The City Library published a loving post, thanking people for their well-behaved visits. “Thank you for Saturday, dear Gothenburg,” the library’s <a href="https://www.instagram.com/explore/locations/859585461/gothenburg-public-library/">post read</a>.</p><!-- Tag ID: zmescience_300x250_InContent -->








<p>“It felt good that everyone behaved exactly as usual, they borrowed books, read the newspaper and so on… the citizens of Gothenburg take care of their library. There is obviously a desire to be there,” said one of the library’s visitors, Arvid Jadenius, <a href="https://www.gp.se/kultur/kultur/arvid-var-en-av-hundratals-inne-p%C3%A5-ol%C3%A5sta-biblioteket-1.114743762">for a local publisher</a>.</p>



<p>In a world often marred by headlines of chaos and discord, the story of Gothenburg’s library stands as a testament to the inherent good in society — and shows that libraries truly are one of the beacons of our society. It seems almost poetic that on All Saints Day, a day of remembrance and reverence, the citizens of Gothenburg would unknowingly participate in an act of collective respect and honor for their beloved library.</p>

<p>Sony has announced the Alpha 9 Mark III, the world's first full-frame camera with a global shutter. It can shoot at 120 fps with no blackout and a maximum shutter speed of 1/80,000 sec.</p>
<p>It's a 24.6MP camera that Sony says doesn't compromise on ISO performance or dynamic range. The camera has a base ISO of 250 though, which is likely to mean that its DR is comparable to existing cameras at that sensitivity setting. The global shutter means photos with zero distortion of movement. It promises 8EV of in-body stabilization.</p>

<p>The a9 III is built around the latest Bionz XR processors, giving eight times as much processing power as was present in the a9 II.</p>
<p>The a9 III can shoot 120 fps with full AF conducting calculations between each shot. It can continue this for 1.6secs of 14-bit Raw files: 192 frames and 6GB/s. It can pre-buffer for up to 1 sec, giving a preemptive 120 frames of pre-capture. The camera includes a 'Speed Boost' custom button to prompt the camera to jump from a slower rate up to 120 fps.</p>
<p>Sony has published a list of lenses able to shoot at 120fps with full AE and AF in AF-C mode.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dpreview.com/files/p/articles/7271416294/IMG_7314.jpeg" target="article-7271416294"><img data-thumbnail-height="0" data-thumbnail-width="590" height="443" src="https://4.img-dpreview.com/files/p/E~TS590x0~articles/7271416294/IMG_7314.jpeg" width="590" data-filename="IMG_7314.jpeg" srcset="https://4.img-dpreview.com/files/p/E~TS1180x0~articles/7271416294/IMG_7314.jpeg 2x"></a></p>
<p>CMOS sensors with a global shutter have been available for several years but haven't been able to offer as much dynamic range as conventional, progressive-scan designs. The emergence of Stacked CMOS technology allows the photo diode and readout circuitry to be built as separate layers, providing more space for the readout circuitry without cutting so much into the sensor's capacity to store electrons (which can limit dynamic range).</p>
<p>Sony isn't giving detail of the sensor but it appears to be a two-layer design, not the <a href="https://www.sony-semicon.com/en/news/2021/2021121601.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">three-layer approach</a> being used for some smartphone sensors. This might explain the base ISO of 250, which will ultimately limit the camera's maximum dynamic range. Sony isn't quoting a DR figure for the camera. Unlike the original a9, the a9 III includes the ability to shoot in S-Log3, with base ISO jumping by 3 stops to ISO 2000, to facilitate its greater degree of highlight capture.</p>
<p>The global shutter means the a9 III can sync at up to 1/80,000 sec and eliminates the need for High Speed Sync, and allows this feature with third-party flashes. It also means there's no risk of banding from artificial lights, but the camera has an 'Anti-Flicker' mode that syncs the shutter with the bright point in the light's cycle, to avoid inconsistent exposure.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dpreview.com/files/p/articles/7271416294/IMG_7316_1.jpeg" target="article-7271416294"><img data-thumbnail-height="0" data-thumbnail-width="590" height="443" src="https://4.img-dpreview.com/files/p/E~TS590x0~articles/7271416294/IMG_7316_1.jpeg" width="590" data-filename="IMG_7316_1.jpeg" srcset="https://4.img-dpreview.com/files/p/E~TS1180x0~articles/7271416294/IMG_7316_1.jpeg 2x"></a></p>
<p>It's rated to focus down to -5EV with an F1.8 aperture lens. It adds smaller AF points, alongside Sony's subject recognition modes.</p>
<p>On the video side, it can shoot 4K/60p taken from 6K capture and 4K/120p without any crop. It includes options such as 10-bit 4:2:2 capture, the S-Cinetone profile and '16-bit' Raw video output over HDMI.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dpreview.com/files/p/articles/7271416294/DSC07594.jpeg" target="article-7271416294"><img data-thumbnail-height="0" data-thumbnail-width="590" height="395" src="https://2.img-dpreview.com/files/p/E~TS590x0~articles/7271416294/DSC07594.jpeg" width="590" data-filename="DSC07594.jpeg" srcset="https://2.img-dpreview.com/files/p/E~TS1180x0~articles/7271416294/DSC07594.jpeg 2x"></a></p>
<p>The a9 III has a 2M-dot 3.2" rear screen with full articulation and a tilt-out cradle. It's the same setup as the a7R V and includes an LCD panel which covers the DCI P3 color gamut. It features a 9.44M dot OLED viewfinder with 0.9x magnification. It can run at full resolution at 120fps or with a reduced resolution at 240fps.</p>
<p>Sony says it's moved the shutter button to improve ergonomics, as well as adding a fifth function button to the front of the camera. The difference is immediately apparent when you pick the camera up: the grip tilts your hand backwards slightly, giving a comfortable grip and putting the shutter button immediately under your finger.</p>
<p>The optional battery grip's ergonomics have also been reworked and the battery performance boosted by 15% by treating the two included batteries as a single entity, rather than discharging one and then the other.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dpreview.com/files/p/articles/7271416294/IMG_7340.jpeg" target="article-7271416294"><img data-thumbnail-height="0" data-thumbnail-width="590" height="443" src="https://3.img-dpreview.com/files/p/E~TS590x0~articles/7271416294/IMG_7340.jpeg" width="590" data-filename="IMG_7340.jpeg" srcset="https://3.img-dpreview.com/files/p/E~TS1180x0~articles/7271416294/IMG_7340.jpeg 2x"></a></p>
<p>The a9 III will be available from Spring 2024 at a recommended price of $5999.</p>
<div>
<h3 id="global">What is a global shutter?</h3>
<p>Global shutter is a method of ending an exposure where all the image data is captured simultaneously. This is distinct from most existing shutter systems (electronic and mechanical) that start and end progressively: working their way across the sensor.</p>
<p>There are multiple benefits to such a system, with the most obvious being the elimination of the rolling shutter distortion effect often seen on video and with slow electronic (progressive) shutters.</p>
<p>But another major benefit is that a global shutter can sync with flash at almost any shutter speed. With global shutter it's the duration of the flash burst that becomes the limitation, rather than the length of time it takes to close the shutter (which in turn dictates the shortest period where the whole sensor is exposed). Sony says the a9 III can sync at all shutter speeds (all the way up to 1/80,000 sec).</p>
<p>A global shutter also eliminates the banding that can occur with progressive shutters under flickering lights. Because the image is all captured at exactly the same moment, you don't capture different parts of a light's flicker cycle in different parts of the image. You might capture an image of an LED sign board refreshing, if you use a very high shutter speed, but that's an issue with the LEDs, not the camera, which is accurately capturing a single moment in time.</p>
</div>
<p>It also says it will be introducing firmware updates to the a7S III and the a1, adding features such as breathing compensation. The a7S III will also gain DCI 4K capture. Sony says there will also be a firmware update for the a9 III, adding the ability to continuously shoot with shutter speeds at up to 1/80,000 sec.</p>
<p>All three cameras will also add <a href="https://c2pa.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">C2PA authentication</a> metadata. C2PA is a combination of the efforts of the Content Authentication Initiative and the separate Project Origin initiative.</p>

<h2>Sony Electronics Releases the Alpha 9 III; the World's First Full-Frame Camera with a Global Shutter System<span>i </span></h2>
<p><em>The next-generation Alpha 9 III captures all decisive moments with up to 120 frames per second high-speed shooting, distortion-free and blackout-free images, and flash sync at all shooting speeds</em></p>

<p>SAN DIEGO- Nov. 7, 2023 – Sony Electronics today introduced the Alpha 9 III camera equipped with the world's firsti full-frame global shutter image sensor. ​</p>
<p>The newly developed global shutter image sensor exposes and reads all pixels simultaneously, unlike a rolling shutter sensor that records images sequentially from the top row of pixels to the bottom. The impressive global shutter full-frame image sensor enables the camera to shoot at burst speeds up to 120 frames per second with no rolling shutter distortion or camera blackout. This innovative sensor is combined with Sony’s most advanced AF (autofocus) system to date - boasting AI autofocus with up to 120 times AF/AE focus calculations per second. With the added ability to sync flash at all shooting speeds, the Alpha 9 III opens up a new world of possibilities for professional photographers to capture every decisive moment.</p>
<p>“The Alpha 9 III full-frame camera is a landmark achievement for the industry,” says Yang Cheng, Vice President, Imaging Solutions, Sony Electronics. “Designed with the needs and demands of professional photographers in mind, every single update to this camera – from the sensor to even the size to the button layouts and menu functions – has been made to address specific input and feedback from our community. We have listened and are thrilled to bring the new capabilities of the Alpha 9 III to market---capabilities which allow photographers to capture things they’ve never been able to capture before.” Cheng continued, “For professionals everywhere, they can achieve even more dynamic expressions when the Alpha 9 III is combined with our rich lineup of lenses, in particular with the new 300mm F2.8 G Master OSS – the world’s lightestii large-aperture telephoto lens.”</p>
<h3>Features of the Alpha 9 III Full-Frame Camera</h3>
<h3>A New Dimension of Still Image Performance Created by the World's First<span>i</span> Global Shutter Image Sensor</h3>
<p>The Alpha 9 III is equipped with the newly developed, world's first<span>i</span> global shutter full frame stacked CMOS image sensor with approximately 24.6 effective megapixels<span>iii</span> and built-in memory. Combined with the latest image processing engine BIONZ XR®, the Alpha 9 III achieves blackout-free Continuous Shooting Speed with AF/AE tracking<span>iv</span> of up to approximately 120 fps<span>iv</span>. The Alpha 9 III is supplied with high-density focal plane phase detection AF. A designated AI processing unit uses Real-time Recognition AF to recognize a wide variety of subjects with high precision. By combining high-speed performance of up to 120 fps with highly accurate subject recognition performance, it is possible to easily photograph scenes and moments that cannot be seen with the naked eye<span>iv</span>. The AI processing unit in the Alpha 9 III supports movies as well as still photography with accurate subject form and movement recognition. The Real-time Recognition AF and Real-time Tracking provide a significant improvement in human eye recognition performance, allowing the camera to automatically recognize, track, and focus on the eyes of a specified subject<span>v</span>. The Alpha 9 III is equipped with 8.0 stops<span>vi</span> of optical 5-axis in-body image stabilization, allowing for high-quality image rendering.</p>
<p>Shutter speed is freed from the limitations of conventional mechanical shutter image sensors and achieves a maximum shutter speed of 1/80,000 second (1/16,000 second during continuous shooting)<span>vii</span>, making it possible to capture at high speed without any distortion. When a compatible Sony flash<span>viii</span> is attached, such as the HVL-F60RM2 and HVL-F46RM (sold separately), it is possible to synchronize the flash and take pictures at all shutter speeds up to 1/80,000 second<span>vii</span>. Previously, if the user released the shutter at a speed faster than the flash's synchronization speed, the amount of light would drop sharply, but with the full-speed flash synchronization function, it’s now possible to photograph scenes that could not be easily captured with conventional technology. Also, when shooting stills or movies under LED lighting, the Hi Frequency Flicker function can significantly reduce high-frequency flicker problems by allowing the shutter speed to be finely adjusted to match the flicker frequency while viewing the monitor.</p>
<p>The Alpha 9 III features selectable release lag modes which allows the user to prioritize release lag or viewfinder/monitor display<span>ix</span>. The newly developed Pre-Capture function allows the camera to continuously record up to one second before the shutter is released, making it easy to capture moments that would otherwise be missed. When selected, the Continuous Shooting Speed Boost<span>x</span> function allows for the user to change to a faster, preset speed set by the user at any time during shooting, and enhanced burst stamina ensures that important moments are reliably captured due to a large buffer memory and increased overall system speed allow up to approximately 390 Fine JPEG images<span>xi</span> to be captured in one continuous 30 fps<span>xii</span> burst.</p>
<p>Customizable focus areas have been expanded to include from XS to XL in addition to the previous S, M, and L sizes. The Preset Focus/Zoom function allows preset focus and zoom settings to be memorized in the camera for quick recall when needed<span>xiii</span>. In addition to the existing custom white balance frame size, the user can now select other sizes as needed which allows for fine white balance adjustment after an image has been composed. The Alpha 9 III has upgraded features such as the latest AF algorithms to achieve high AF precision down to light levels as low as EV-5 in AF-S mode (ISO 100 equivalent, F2.0 lens), AF tracking for continuous shooting at F22<span>xiv</span> and a composite RAW shooting function that gives the ability to combine multiple consecutive images into a high-quality composite.</p>
<h3>Advanced Video Performance Without Distortion</h3>
<p>The global shutter image sensor provides distortion-free image expression for videos as well as still images. For example, the user can shoot images of nearby scenery from a fast-moving vehicle such as a car or fast-moving subjects with ease. This camera is the first in the Alpha™ series to be able to record 4K 120p high-frame-rate video without cropping, allowing the user to shoot at the angle of view intended. It is also possible to shoot high-resolution 4K 60p videos with 6K oversampling.</p>
<p>The Alpha 9 III has S-Cinetone™, a unique Sony feature which can create a cinematic look straight out of the camera without post-processing. S-Cinetone was created through the development of the VENICE high-end cinema camera and makes human skin tones and subjects stand out beautifully, creating natural highlights. The Alpha 9 III has the latest video performance including rich gradation performance and S-Log3, and when in Log shooting mode, it can reflect and display the user's favorite imported LUT (lookup table). The Alpha 9 III is compatible with the mobile app "Monitor &amp; Control" for video creators.</p>
<h3>Operability and Reliability for Professionals</h3>
<p>Sony has listened to the voices of professional photographers and created operability and reliability that supports professional users. The shape of the grip is improved and ergonomically designed so that it can be easily held in the palm of the hand to avoid straining the user even when wearing a telephoto lens or using it for long periods of time.</p>
<p>The VG-C5 vertical grip (sold separately), provides the same operability and versatility as when shooting horizontally; the user can comfortably support long shooting sessions. The grip and shutter button area share the same design as the main body, allowing image capture without feeling uncomfortable, with the same operability as the camera. The Alpha 9 III is equipped with a 4-axis multi-angle LCD monitor that can be operated by touch, allowing for intuitive operation using the latest touch menu. The electronic viewfinder uses a 9.44 million-dot Quad XGA OLED and achieves high visibility with the same brightness as the Alpha 7R V and a magnification of approximately 0.90x. Also, a custom button is placed on the front of the camera, and the continuous shooting speed can be changed by operating the custom button assigned with Continuous Shooting Speed Boost with the finger holding the grip, allowing for highly immediate operations. It supports professional photographers when shooting in all environments.</p>
<h3>High-Speed Workflow and Scalability to Support Immediate Delivery</h3>
<p>New features for the Alpha 9 III include a playback image filter that allows the user to efficiently select a large number of images using high-speed continuous shooting, and a function menu that can be used even during image playback, strongly supporting professional workflows from shooting to delivery.</p>
<p>The "Playback Function Menu" can be assigned in advance, so the user can perform protection, smartphone transfer, File transfer protocol, etc. during image playback. The user can select images narrowed down with a playback filter and play them from the function menu, allowing for quick delivery of specific images. The camera has a dedicated microphone for voice memos on the back, and by positioning the built-in microphone near the user’s mouth allows clear recording of audio even in noisy environments. The recorded audio data can be transferred via FTP along with the images. The camera allows the user to set up to 20 presets from the International Press Telecommunications Council (IPTC), an international consultative body in which news organizations from various countries participate. ​</p>
<p>The Alpha 9 III can transfer data up to twice as fast as the Alpha 9 II. 5 GHz communication offers maximum speed and stability for news and sports shooters who need to deliver immediately via FTP, as well as for studio environments. The Alpha 9 III allows stills and movies to be recorded to memory media in numerous ways including the two media slots that support CFexpress Type A cards as well as UHS-I and UHS-II SD cards.</p>
<p>It is compatible with the professional mobile application "Transfer &amp; Tagging" which speeds up the image delivery workflow, and the application "Remote Camera Tool" which allows remote shooting of PCs using wired LAN. Also, Sony plans to support a new version of Camera Remote SDK, a software development kit that allows remote camera operation and changing shooting settings, in Spring 2024.</p>
<p>In addition, the Alpha 9 III is scheduled to support functional enhancements such as FTP operability, relay playback, and C2PA<span>xv</span> ​ format support <span>xvi</span> through a camera software update<span>xvii</span>.</p>
<h3>Firmware Updates for the Alpha 1 and Alpha 7S III Models</h3>
<p>In addition to the release of Alpha 9 III, Sony has announced new firmware updates for the Alpha 1 and Alpha 7S III full-frame mirrorless cameras<span> xvii</span>. The new software will provide both models with some of Sony’s latest imaging technologies including the highly requested Focus Breathing Compensation feature, IPTC and FTP workflow enhancement, and C2PA format support. The firmware will also update the Alpha 1 with Relay Playback, and the Alpha 7S III with DCI 4K 24.00P shooting format. The camera software update will be available in Spring 2024.</p>
<h3>Pricing and Availability</h3>
<p>The Alpha 9 III camera is available for pre-order Nov. 8, 2023, at a variety of Sony's authorized dealers, for a suggested retail price of $5,999.99 USD and $8,299.99 CAN.</p>
<p>The VG-C5 vertical grip is available for pre-order Nov. 8, 2023, at a variety of Sony’s authorized dealers, for a suggested retail price of $399.99 USD and $549.99 CAN.</p>

<p dir="auto">LLMs as a way to browse the web is being explored by numerous startups and open-source projects. With this project, I was interested in seeing if we could only use <a href="https://openai.com/research/gpt-4v-system-card" rel="nofollow">GPT-4V</a>'s vision capabilities for web browsing.</p>
<p dir="auto">The issue with this is it's hard to determine what the model wants to click on without giving it the browser DOM as text. <a href="https://vimium.github.io/" rel="nofollow">Vimium</a> is a Chrome extension that lets you navigate the web with only your keyboard. I thought it would be interesting to see if we could use Vimium to give the model a way to interact with the web.</p>

<h2 tabindex="-1" id="user-content-ideas" dir="auto"><a href="#ideas">Ideas</a></h2>
<p dir="auto">Feel free to collaborate with me on this, I have a number of ideas:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Use <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/assistants/overview" rel="nofollow">Assistant API</a> once it's released for automatic context retrieval. The Assistant API will create a thread that we can add messages too, to keep the history of actions, but it doesn't support the Vision API yet.</li>
<li>Vimium fork for overlaying elements. A specialized version of Vimium that selectively overlays elements based on context could be useful, effectively pruning based on the user query. Might be worth testing if different sized boxes/colors help.</li>
<li>Use higher resolution images, as it seems to fail at low res. I noticed that below a certain threshold, the model wouldn't detect anything. This might be improved by using higher resolution images but that would require more tokens.</li>
<li>Fine-tune <a href="https://github.com/haotian-liu/LLaVA">LLaVa</a> or <a href="https://github.com/THUDM/CogVLM">CogVLM</a> to do this. Could be faster/cheaper. CogVLM can accurately specify pixel coordinates which may be a good way to augment this.</li>
<li>Use JSON mode once it's released for Vision API. Currently the Vision API doesn't support JSON mode or function calling, so we have to rely on more primitive prompting methods.</li>
<li>Have the Vision API return general instructions, formalized by another call to the JSON mode version of the API. This is a workaround for the JSON mode issue but requires another LLM call, which is slower/more expensive.</li>
<li>Add speech-to-text with Whisper or another model to eliminate text input and make this more accessible.</li>
<li>Make this work for your own browser instead of spinning up an artificial one. I want to be able to order food with my credit card.</li>
<li>Provide the frames with and without Vimium enabled in case the model can't see what's under the yellow square.</li>
<li>Pass the Chrome accessibility tree in as input in addition to the image. This provides a layout of interactive elements that can be mapped to the Vimium bindings.</li>

      Using a travel agent to buy a plane ticket&nbsp;or a stockbroker to trade equities seem like relics of the past. And yet, every day, people across America hire a real estate agent to help them sell a home. It’s one of the few industries that has been able to largely avoid the disruption that has helped consumers cut costs in the Internet age.

      And that is largely because of the power of the National Association of Realtors, the largest professional organization in America and a significant lobbying group for the real estate industry.

      But the verdict handed down in a Missouri court on Tuesday that found NAR and two brokerage firms, Homeservices of America and Keller Williams Realty, were liable for $1.8 billion in damages for conspiring to keep commissions artificially high,&nbsp;may mark the beginning of the end of how homes are bought and sold.

      “This matter is not close to being final as we will appeal the jury’s verdict,” said Mantill Williams, NAR vice president of communications. “In the interim, we will ask the court to reduce the damages awarded by the jury.”
  </p>

  <p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cloj31k01000l3b6ijgiboaeh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
      “This is not the end,” said Darryl Frost, spokesperson for Keller Williams.

      The cornerstone of the plaintiff’s argument is that NAR is forcing homesellers to pay an inflated commission that is then split between their agent and the buyer’s agent.&nbsp;The homesellers argued commission sharing as a condition for access to the Multiple Listing Service was unfair and kept commissions artificially high.
  </p>

  <p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cloj31k01000o3b6i4glbjvwx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
      Typically, when a home goes on the market for sale, the seller offers their broker a set commission. For decades, the commission has&nbsp;consistently been around 6% of the sale price, usually with a 3% split for the buyer’s and seller’s agent.
  </p>

  


  <p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cloj31k01000q3b6i9zloguvw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
      In a competitive market, the homesellers argue, the cost of the buyer’s agent’s commission would be paid not by the seller, but by the buyer who received the service. The sellers said that the buyers should be able to negotiate the fee with their agent, and that the sellers should not be on the hook for paying it.
  </p>

  <p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cloj31k01000r3b6iliyvp2z9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
      NAR and the other defendants argued in court that their commissions are always negotiable. They also said that the system of having the seller’s agent split the commission with the buyer’s agent allows buyers, who are already weighed down with expenses like a downpayment, closing costs, inspections and appraisals, to avoid the added expense of having to pay an agent as well.

      Consumer advocates celebrated the verdict and hoped that plaintiffs would also receive their request for the judge to order changes to how commissions are structured in the industry.

      While already large, the award could grow even more — to a total of $5 billion, depending on what the judge decides.

      The jury clearly saw the industry had restricted price competition to a point where it could ensure nearly uniform 5%-6% commissions, said Stephen Brobeck, a senior fellow at the Consumer Federation of America. Jurors made their decision quickly, he said, deliberating for only a few hours.
  </p>

  <p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cloj31k01000v3b6iwgicpier@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
      “The extent of injunctive relief decided by the court will strongly influence whether a price competitive system develops that lowers consumer costs and increases quality of services,” Brobeck said. “We hope that the court will sever the ties between listing agent and buyer agent compensation, freeing sellers from the obligation and need to compensate buyer agents.”

      The longer-term impact of the verdict may be that the pairing of buyer’s agent commission and seller’s agent commission will eventually be separated.

      Analysts from Keefe, Bruyette &amp; Woods, an investment banking firm, said in report released ahead of the verdict that the NAR litigation and related government action is likely to reshape the residential brokerage industry’s commission structure, by eliminating the buyer-broker commission rule, and eventually the practice of listing agents and sellers setting and paying buyer agent commissions.
  </p>

      And since the commission paid to an agent is typically baked into a home price, if they were reduced&nbsp;or were to become more negotiable, home prices could drop as well, they said.
  </p>

  <p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cloj31k0100113b6iksjfc8kw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
      “Short term nothing changes,” said Jen Davis, a Keller Williams agent with Holt Homes Group, in Springfield, Missouri. “Commissions have always been negotiable. That will continue to be the case.”

  <p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cloj31k0100133b6i05cpnigs@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
      “There are buyers that aren’t going to know the steps to buy a home,” Davis said. “They have to pay for a down payment, closing costs, appraisals, inspections. If they also have to come up with money to pay for a buyer’s agent, some just won’t and they’ll get in over their heads or they won’t buy at all. Not having representation will make the market less inclusive.”

      Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has personally and repeatedly thwarted initiatives meant to improve the well-being of teens on Facebook and Instagram, at times directly overruling some of his most senior lieutenants, according to internal communications made public as part of an ongoing lawsuit against the company.
  </p>

      The disclosures highlight Zuckerberg’s sway over decisions at Meta that can affect billions of users. And they also shed light on tensions that have occasionally arisen between Zuckerberg and other Meta officials who have pushed to enhance user well-being.

      Zuckerberg vetoed a 2019 proposal that would have disabled Instagram’s so-called “beauty filters,” a technology that digitally alters a user’s on-screen appearance and allegedly harms teens’ mental health by promoting unrealistic body image expectations, according to the unredacted version of the complaint filed this week by Massachusetts officials.
  </p>

  <p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cloq042ku00043b6h072835z9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
      After sitting on the proposal for months, Zuckerberg wrote to his deputies in April 2020 asserting that there was “demand” for the filters and that he had seen “no data” suggesting the filters were harmful, according to the complaint.
  </p>

  <p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cloq042ku00053b6hpjjrc618@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
      Despite Zuckerberg’s conclusion, the proposal had enjoyed broad support, the lawsuit said, including from Mosseri; Instagram’s policy chief, Karina Newton; the head of Facebook, Fidji Simo, and Meta’s vice president of product design, Margaret Gould Stewart. (Simo and Mosseri had lamented at other times, according to the lawsuit, that a lack of investment in well-being initiatives meant Meta lacked “a roadmap of work that demonstrates we care about well-being.”)
  </p>

  <p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cloq042ku00063b6hqaby4ohv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
      Stewart had first pitched the idea to disable beauty filters, citing recommendations by academics and Meta’s outside advisors, while Newton wrote an email adding it had strong backing from departments including “comms, marketing [and] policy,” the lawsuit said.
  </p>

      But after Chief Technology Officer Andrew Bosworth brought the matter to Zuckerberg’s attention, Zuckerberg ultimately rejected the plan and the filters were allowed to remain, according to the complaint.

  <p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cloqbhrdq00013b6hvk3y3s2d@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
      Stewart later wrote to Zuckerberg, fretting that his decision not to disable the filters could come back to haunt the company.

  <p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cloqbio9v00033b6hataeed6a@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
      “I respect your call on this and I’ll support it,” Stewart wrote, according to a message cited in the complaint, “but want to just say for the record that I don’t think it’s the right call given the risks…. I just hope that years from now we will look back and feel good about the decision we made here.”
  </p>

      In response to the newly unsealed communications, Meta spokesman Andy Stone said such image filters are commonly used in the industry.

  <p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cloq521ck00013b6hetffleuc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
      “While filters exist across every major social platform and smartphone camera, Meta bans those that directly promote cosmetic surgery, changes in skin color or extreme weight loss,” Stone said. “We clearly note when a filter is being used and we work to proactively review effects against these rules before they go live.”

  <p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cloq522un00033b6hpy57iihx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
      Stone added that Meta offers 30 tools to support teens and families, including the ability to set screen-time limits and the option to remove like counts from posts. (In the unredacted portions of the complaint, the Massachusetts suit alleges that the experiment to remove like counts from posts, codenamed Project Daisy, had originally been proposed as an app-wide default but was later downgraded to an opt-in feature that is rarely used.)

      A year after the beauty filter decision, in August 2021, Clegg pressed Zuckerberg to make “additional investment to strengthen our position on wellbeing across the company,” citing a staff recommendation to address issues of addiction, self-harm and bullying, according to the complaint. By this time, the company was just weeks away from being hit with Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen’s bombshell <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-knows-instagram-is-toxic-for-teen-girls-company-documents-show-11631620739?mod=hp_lead_pos7" target="_blank">allegations</a> that Instagram knew its services could be harmful to teens.

      Haugen’s anonymous allegations in September jumpstarted intense scrutiny of Instagram. As Haugen <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/10/04/tech/facebook-whistleblower-frances-haugen-what-we-know/index.html">revealed her identity</a> in October, Mosseri wrote to another Meta product executive that same month in reference to Clegg’s proposal, the lawsuit said, saying he was “really worried” about well-being “but have made little progress.”

      Zuckerberg allegedly remained silent on Clegg’s proposal throughout this time, prompting Clegg to reiterate his concerns to Zuckerberg in November. Finally, Zuckerberg appeared to respond through Meta’s chief financial officer, Susan Li, who “tersely respond[ed] that staffing was too ‘constrained’ to meet the request,” the lawsuit said.

      Li responded similarly on Zuckerberg’s behalf after another product executive, David Ginsberg, emailed Zuckerberg in 2019 highlighting internal and external research suggesting that the company’s services were having a negative impact on people’s well-being. Ginsberg proposed hiring more engineers to build well-being tools to respond to addiction, social comparison and loneliness, but Li “responded that Meta’s leadership team declined to fund this initiative,” according to the complaint.

      Zuckerberg’s rejection of opportunities to invest more heavily in well-being are reflective of his data-centric approach to management, said Arturo Bejar, the former Facebook engineering director and whistleblower who leveled his own allegations last week that Instagram has repeatedly ignored internal warnings about the app’s potential harms to teens.

      “My understanding was that Mark needed causal data,” Bejar said, “for you to be able to demonstrate that because somebody was using a filter, that that would have an impact on how they perceive themselves.”

      “All the people that I’ve talked to internally about this were like… Mark’s level of proof, in order to be able to take the work seriously and act on it, is too high,” Bejar added. “I think it’s an impossible standard to meet.”

      A 2020 internal presentation discussed in the complaint described how Instagram meets teenagers’ desire for “novelty seeking” with “a dopamine hit” through intermittent notifications about comments, follows and other bids for attention that can convey a sense of “approval and acceptance [that] are huge rewards for teens.”

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p><img src="https://www.omegle.com/static/gravestone.png" alt="" width="500" height="500"></p>
<p>“Of all tyrannies, a tyranny sincerely exercised for the good of its victims may be the most oppressive. It would be better to live under robber barons than under omnipotent moral busybodies. The robber baron's cruelty may sometimes sleep, his cupidity may at some point be satiated; but those who torment us for our own good will torment us without end for they do so with the approval of their own conscience.” — C.S. Lewis</p>
<p>“In the beginning the Universe was created. This has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move.” — Douglas Adams</p>
<p>Dear strangers,</p>
<p>From the moment I discovered the Internet at a young age, it has been a magical place to me. Growing up in a small town, relatively isolated from the larger world, it was a revelation how much more there was to discover – how many interesting people and ideas the world had to offer.</p>
<p>As a young teenager, I couldn’t just waltz onto a college campus and tell a student: “Let’s debate moral philosophy!” I couldn’t walk up to a professor and say: “Tell me something interesting about microeconomics!” But online, I was able to meet those people, and have those conversations. I was also an avid Wikipedia editor; I contributed to open source software projects; and I often helped answer computer programming questions posed by people many years older than me.</p>
<p>In short, the Internet opened the door to a much larger, more diverse, and more vibrant world than I would have otherwise been able to experience; and enabled me to be an active participant in, and contributor to, that world. All of this helped me to learn, and to grow into a more well-rounded person.</p>
<p>Moreover, as a survivor of childhood rape, I was acutely aware that any time I interacted with someone in the physical world, I was risking my physical body. The Internet gave me a refuge from that fear. I was under no illusion that only good people used the Internet; but I knew that, if I said “no” to someone online, they couldn’t physically reach through the screen and hold a weapon to my head, or worse. I saw the miles of copper wires and fiber-optic cables between me and other people as a kind of shield – one that empowered me to be less isolated than my trauma and fear would have otherwise allowed.</p>
<p>I launched Omegle when I was 18 years old, and still living with my parents. It was meant to build on the things I loved about the Internet, while introducing a form of social spontaneity that I felt didn’t exist elsewhere. If the Internet is a manifestation of the “global village”, Omegle was meant to be a way of strolling down a street in that village, striking up conversations with the people you ran into along the way.</p>
<p>The premise was rather straightforward: when you used Omegle, it would randomly place you in a chat with someone else. These chats could be as long or as short as you chose. If you didn’t want to talk to a particular person, for whatever reason, you could simply end the chat and – if desired – move onto another chat with someone else. It was the idea of “meeting new people” distilled down to almost its platonic ideal.</p>
<p>Building on what I saw as the intrinsic safety benefits of the Internet, users were anonymous to each other by default. This made chats more self-contained, and made it less likely that a malicious person would be able to track someone else down off-site after their chat ended.</p>
<p>I didn’t really know what to expect when I launched Omegle. Would anyone even care about some Web site that an 18 year old kid made in his bedroom in his parents’ house in Vermont, with no marketing budget? But it became popular almost instantly after launch, and grew organically from there, reaching millions of daily users. I believe this had something to do with meeting new people being a basic human need, and with Omegle being among the best ways to fulfill that need. As the saying goes: “If you build a better mousetrap, the world will beat a path to your door.”</p>
<p>Over the years, people have used Omegle to explore foreign cultures; to get advice about their lives from impartial third parties; and to help alleviate feelings of loneliness and isolation. I’ve even heard stories of soulmates meeting on Omegle, and getting married. Those are only some of the highlights.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there are also lowlights. Virtually every tool can be used for good or for evil, and that is especially true of communication tools, due to their innate flexibility. The telephone can be used to wish your grandmother “happy birthday”, but it can also be used to call in a bomb threat. There can be no honest accounting of Omegle without acknowledging that some people misused it, including to commit unspeakably heinous crimes.</p>
<p>I believe in a responsibility to be a “good Samaritan”, and to implement reasonable measures to fight crime and other misuse. That is exactly what Omegle did. In addition to the basic safety feature of anonymity, there was a great deal of moderation behind the scenes, including state-of-the-art AI operating in concert with a wonderful team of human moderators. Omegle punched above its weight in content moderation, and I’m proud of what we accomplished.</p>
<p>Omegle’s moderation even had a positive impact beyond the site. Omegle worked with law enforcement agencies, and the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, to help put evildoers in prison where they belong. There are “people” rotting behind bars right now thanks in part to evidence that Omegle proactively collected against them, and tipped the authorities off to.</p>
<p>All that said, the fight against crime isn’t one that can ever truly be won. It’s a never-ending battle that must be fought and re-fought every day; and even if you do the very best job it is possible for you to do, you may make a sizable dent, but you won’t “win” in any absolute sense of that word. That’s heartbreaking, but it’s also a basic lesson of criminology, and one that I think the vast majority of people understand on some level. Even superheroes, the fictional characters that our culture imbues with special powers as a form of wish fulfillment in the fight against crime, don’t succeed at eliminating crime altogether.</p>
<p>In recent years, it seems like the whole world has become more ornery. Maybe that has something to do with the pandemic, or with political disagreements. Whatever the reason, people have become faster to attack, and slower to recognize each other’s shared humanity. One aspect of this has been a constant barrage of attacks on communication services, Omegle included, based on the behavior of a malicious subset of users.</p>
<p>To an extent, it is reasonable to question the policies and practices of any place where crime has occurred. I have always welcomed constructive feedback; and indeed, Omegle implemented a number of improvements based on such feedback over the years. However, the recent attacks have felt anything but constructive. The only way to please these people is to stop offering the service. Sometimes they say so, explicitly and avowedly; other times, it can be inferred from their act of setting standards that are not humanly achievable. Either way, the net result is the same.</p>
<p>Omegle is the direct target of these attacks, but their ultimate victim is <em>you</em>: all of you out there who have used, or would have used, Omegle to improve your lives, and the lives of others. When they say Omegle shouldn’t exist, they are really saying that you shouldn’t be allowed to use it; that you shouldn’t be allowed to meet random new people online. That idea is anathema to the ideals I cherish – specifically, to the bedrock principle of a free society that, when restrictions are imposed to prevent crime, the burden of those restrictions must not be targeted at innocent victims or potential victims of crime.</p>
<p>Consider the idea that society ought to force women to dress modestly in order to prevent rape. One counter-argument is that rapists don’t really target women based on their clothing; but a more powerful counter-argument is that, irrespective of what rapists do, women’s rights should remain intact. If society robs women of their rights to bodily autonomy and self-expression based on the actions of rapists – even if it does so with the best intentions in the world – then society is practically doing the work of rapists for them.</p>
<p>Fear can be a valuable tool, guiding us away from danger. However, fear can also be a mental cage that keeps us from all of the things that make life worth living. Individuals and families must be allowed to strike the right balance for themselves, based on their own unique circumstances and needs. A world of mandatory fear is a world ruled by fear – a dark place indeed.</p>
<p>I’ve done my best to weather the attacks, with the interests of Omegle’s users – and the broader principle – in mind. If something as simple as meeting random new people is forbidden, what’s next? That is far and away removed from anything that could be considered a reasonable compromise of the principle I outlined. Analogies are a limited tool, but a physical-world analogy might be shutting down Central Park because crime occurs there – or perhaps more provocatively, destroying the universe because it contains evil. A healthy, free society cannot endure when we are collectively afraid of each other to this extent.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, what is right doesn’t always prevail. As much as I wish circumstances were different, the stress and expense of this fight – coupled with the existing stress and expense of operating Omegle, and fighting its misuse – are simply too much. Operating Omegle is no longer sustainable, financially nor psychologically. Frankly, I don’t want to have a heart attack in my 30s.</p>
<p>The battle for Omegle has been lost, but the war against the Internet rages on. Virtually every online communication service has been subject to the same kinds of attack as Omegle; and while some of them are much larger companies with much greater resources, they all have their breaking point somewhere. I worry that, unless the tide turns soon, the Internet I fell in love with may cease to exist, and in its place, we will have something closer to a souped-up version of TV – focused largely on passive consumption, with much less opportunity for active participation and genuine human connection. If that sounds like a bad idea to you, please consider donating to the <a href="https://supporters.eff.org/donate/join-eff">Electronic Frontier Foundation</a>, an organization that fights for your rights online.</p>
<p>From the bottom of my heart, thank you to everyone who used Omegle for positive purposes, and to everyone who contributed to the site’s success in any way. I’m so sorry I couldn’t keep fighting for you.</p>
<p>Sincerely,<br>

  </header>

  <p>The new Swift 5.9 release contains a number of helpful, new features for debugging code, including an out-of-process, interactive
crash handler to inspect crashes in real time, the ability to trigger
the debugger for just-in-time debugging, along with concurrency-aware
backtracing to make it easier to understand control flow in a program
that uses structured concurrency.</p>

<h3 id="out-of-process-crash-handling">Out-of-Process Crash Handling</h3>

<p>Prior to Swift 5.9, all you would get when your program fails is a message
from the parent process (often the shell) telling you that the child
process crashed:</p>

<div>
<pre><span>$ </span><span>./crash</span>
I'm going to crash now
zsh: segmentation fault  ./crash
</pre>
</div>

<p>On Apple platforms or on Windows, you could look at the crash logs
captured by the operating system’s built-in crash reporter, but on
Linux that’s typically all you had to go on.</p>

<p>Now, instead of the opaque message above, the result looks something like this:</p>

<div>
<pre><span>$ </span><span>./crash</span>

<p>This new feature greatly improves the on-crash debugging experience on Linux, where it is on by default. It is useful on macOS as well, but must be manually
enabled. It is not presently supported on Windows.</p>

<h3 id="interactive-backtraces">Interactive Backtraces</h3>

<p>You might be wondering about the message on the last line of the
in-terminal backtrace above, where it says:</p>

<div><pre><code>Press space to interact, D to debug, or any other key to quit (30s)
</code></pre></div>

<p>Often when developing a program at the terminal, you might find that
the program crashes, but you aren’t able to reproduce the problem.
Without a suitable crash log, that can be very frustrating — you know
your program has a bug, but you don’t know what it was or how to
reproduce it.</p>

<p>The idea behind this feature is that it leaves the program suspended
(by default for 30 seconds, but this is configurable) and provides you
with the opportunity to either attach a debugger, or perform some
additional inspection of the crashed process.</p>

<p>If you tap the spacebar when this prompt appears, you will be
presented with a simple command prompt that allows you to change the
backtracer settings, generate a new backtrace, list loaded images,
display register and memory contents, and get a listing of all of the
threads in the process.  Typing <code>help</code> at the prompt will bring up a
list of available commands:</p>

<div>
<pre><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>help
Available commands:

backtrace  Display a backtrace.
bt         Synonym for backtrace.
debug      Attach the debugger.
exit       Exit interaction, allowing program to crash normally.
help       Display help.
images     List images loaded by the program.
mem        Synonym for memory.
memory     Inspect memory.
process    Show information about the process.
quit       Synonym for exit.
reg        Synonym for registers.
registers  Display the registers.
set        Set or show options.
thread     Show or set the current thread.
threads    Synonym for process.
</pre>
</div>

<p>If you use the <code>debug</code> command or press <code>D</code> at the prompt, the
backtracer will help you to attach a debugger to your program.
Exactly what happens here is platform-dependent.</p>

<p>If you press any other key, or if the 30 second timer runs down, the
program will be allowed to crash normally.</p>

<p>By default, the interactive feature will trigger if your program’s
standard input and output are both attached to a terminal. In many
cases, this means you’ll get the right behavior automatically if
you’re running in a CI system or as part of an automated script,
as those tend to run with the program’s output redirected to a
pipe or a file.</p>

<p>In situations where you do not want this feature enabled, you can
explicitly disable it by setting the environment variable
<code>SWIFT_BACKTRACE</code> to <code>interactive=no</code>. You can also disable the color
output with <code>color=no</code>, as well as combine multiple options like <code>interactive=no,color=no</code>.</p>

<h3 id="structured-concurrency-support">Structured Concurrency Support</h3>

<p>The backtracer is concurrency-aware and will correctly step back
through asynchronous frames.  For example, given the program:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>func</span> <span>level</span><span>(</span><span>n</span><span>:</span> <span>Int</span><span>)</span> <span>async</span> <span>{</span>

<p>On Apple platforms, this feature has no special requirements, but for
other platforms the backtracer needs to be able to look up symbols
to determine whether or not a given frame is asynchronous.  If the
necessary symbols are not available, the backtrace will follow the
normal program stack rather than the async activation chain.  This
will usually result in it showing frames from the concurrency runtime,
which are unlikely to be helpful when debugging most types of problem.</p>

<h3 id="improving-readability">Improving Readability</h3>

<p>The new backtracer also has a number of options to improve readability.</p>

<p>You can configure the maximum number of frames that the backtracer
will generate (the default is 64), but since you might also want to
see frames at the top of the stack, the backtracer also has a setting
for the number of frames to capture there (by default 16).  This is
particularly handy if your program crashes due to excessive recursion,
as you’ll usually see both the recursion and the cause of it, without
being overwhelmed by thousands and thousands of frames.</p>

<p>The backtracer also skips over system frames and Swift thunks by
default.  These are usually not relevant except to compiler or runtime
engineers, and generally result in more confusing output for most
developers.</p>

<p>Additionally, the backtracer will automatically demangle both Swift
and C++ mangled names.</p>

<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>

<p>The new on-crash debugging options in Swift 5.9 help you
debug your programs when they misbehave. The backtracer has a
number of helpful features including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Out-of-process crash handling</li>
  <li>Smart, in-line display of program source, where available</li>
  <li>The option to pause and inspect your crashed program, or even
trigger the debugger for just-in-time debugging</li>
  <li>Support for Swift Concurrency</li>
  <li>Support for C++ name mangling in addition to Swift</li>
  <li>Colorized output for readability</li>
  <li>Expanded configuration options (<a href="https://github.com/apple/swift/blob/main/docs/Backtracing.rst">see
documentation</a>).</li>
</ul>

<p>The new feature is enabled by default on Linux and can be enabled for macOS (<a href="https://github.com/apple/swift/blob/main/docs/Backtracing.rst">see
documentation</a>).
There is no Windows support at present.</p>

<p>Comedic performers frequently show humorous tendencies early in life, often identified as the 'class clown' throughout school.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEFisher19812_12-0"><a href="#cite_note-FOOTNOTEFisher19812-12">[12]</a></sup> Comics recalled mocking the strict nature of school, taking great pleasure in the laughter from their peers.<sup id="cite_ref-:3_4-1"><a href="#cite_note-:3-4">[4]</a></sup> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Smothers" title="Tom Smothers">Tommy Smothers</a> commented that during his schooling experiences;"I got a big kick out of them laughing, but I didn’t know what it was that made them laugh, but I knew I could make people laugh."<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEFisher19813_13-0"><a href="#cite_note-FOOTNOTEFisher19813-13">[13]</a></sup> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnny_Carson" title="Johnny Carson">Johnny Carson</a> also emphasised the role of school in a comedian’s life stating that:<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEFisher19813_13-1"><a href="#cite_note-FOOTNOTEFisher19813-13">[13]</a></sup>
</p>
<blockquote><p>I think, by the fact that you find you can get laughs when you are in school—and this is where most of the guys start, when they are growing up in the neighbourhood—they're jerking around, doing silly things, interrupting the class. It's an attention-getting thing, and that, in effect, is saying, 'Hey, look at me, folks, I'm getting your acceptance.'</p></blockquote>
<p>Despite comedians often being of high intelligence, the school environment was detested and frequently avoided.<sup id="cite_ref-:0_1-1"><a href="#cite_note-:0-1">[1]</a></sup> Comics explained that their teachers lacked understanding and acceptance, identifying their mannerisms as a form of personal exclusion.<sup id="cite_ref-:0_1-2"><a href="#cite_note-:0-1">[1]</a></sup> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woody_Allen" title="Woody Allen">Woody Allen</a> commented that school "was boring, frightening.

I never did the homework."<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEFisher19813_13-2"><a href="#cite_note-FOOTNOTEFisher19813-13">[13]</a></sup> Even though a school’s orientation to order and discipline conflicts with the nature of a comic, it can serve as an initial arena for an individual to realise their ability to produce laughter.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEFisher19814_14-0"><a href="#cite_note-FOOTNOTEFisher19814-14">[14]</a></sup> This discovery creates mixed feelings as frequently the laughter can be directed at themselves with undertones of ridicule or mockery.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEFisher19815_15-0"><a href="#cite_note-FOOTNOTEFisher19815-15">[15]</a></sup> Regardless of the unpleasantness involved, comics are attracted to the ability of 'making' someone laugh and the power it holds.<sup id="cite_ref-:3_4-2"><a href="#cite_note-:3-4">[4]</a></sup>
</p><p>The talent for creating humour directs the individual towards a career in the entertainment industry.

</p><p>A study conducted by Fisher found humour-orientated individuals likely to identify their mothers as demanding, unsympathetic and distant.

<p>The early lives of comedians are characterised by suffering, isolation and feelings of deprivation, where humour is used as an outlet or defence against experienced anxiety.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEJanus1975174_11-2"><a href="#cite_note-FOOTNOTEJanus1975174-11">[11]</a></sup>  German philosopher <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_Nietzsche" title="Friedrich Nietzsche">Nietzsche</a> once described it as; "man alone suffers so excruciatingly in the world that he was compelled to invent laughter."<sup id="cite_ref-26"><a href="#cite_note-26">[26]</a></sup>  The inability to exhibit direct aggression results in expression through the socially acceptable manner of humour.<sup id="cite_ref-:1_27-0"><a href="#cite_note-:1-27">[27]</a></sup>
</p><p>Humour provides the ability to assert control and invincibility in a situation.<sup id="cite_ref-:5_9-1"><a href="#cite_note-:5-9">[9]</a></sup> An example is the British comedian <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spike_Milligan" title="Spike Milligan">Spike Milligan</a>, who suffered from a long cycle of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipolar_disorder" title="Bipolar disorder">manic-depressive</a> states that were onset by severe <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder" title="Mental disorder">mental breakdowns</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-clare_28-0"><a href="#cite_note-clare-28">[28]</a></sup> Milligan was capable of creating light-hearted humour and outrageous ideas, despite his manic state. Finding laughter served as motivation to remedy a depressed mental state and effectively function as self-medication.<sup id="cite_ref-:6_10-1"><a href="#cite_note-:6-10">[10]</a></sup> This process has been described as a safeguard against the formation of hopelessness and subsequent depression.<sup id="cite_ref-29"><a href="#cite_note-29">[29]</a></sup> Additionally, affiliative and self-enhancing humour can be used to predict symptoms of depression, with higher levels shown to correlate with lower levels of depression.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEHugelshoferKwonReffOlson2006335_30-0"><a href="#cite_note-FOOTNOTEHugelshoferKwonReffOlson2006335-30">[30]</a></sup>

<p>The use of inkblot imaging reveals certain characteristics and worries of comedic performers that are not matched in regular actors.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEFisher198120_32-0"><a href="#cite_note-FOOTNOTEFisher198120-32">[32]</a></sup> Fisher identified four key trends that were common for comedians' Rorschach Tests;
</p>
<ul><li>The identification of '<b>not-bad'</b> imagery. This involves a traditional, negative idea that has been misunderstood and is a victim to preconceived views.

<p>A joke dating from at least the 19th century exemplifies the sad clown paradox. The joke involves a doctor recommending his depressed patient to visit a great clown in town (typically named "Pagliacci"), but it turns out that the patient is actually the clown out of costume.

</p><p>The poem was then seen as a story in the 1910s, again, with the performer called 'Grimaldi',<sup id="cite_ref-48"><a href="#cite_note-48">[48]</a></sup> and again from the 1930s,<sup id="cite_ref-49"><a href="#cite_note-49">[49]</a></sup> featuring a clown called 'Grock', suggested as being the Swiss clown <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Adrien_Wettach" title="Charles Adrien Wettach">Charles Adrien Wettach</a>.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-target="readme-toc.content">
            <article itemprop="text"><h2 tabindex="-1" id="user-content-punica-serving-multiple-lora-finetuned-llm-as-one" dir="auto"><a href="#punica-serving-multiple-lora-finetuned-llm-as-one">Punica: Serving multiple LoRA finetuned LLM as one</a></h2>
<p dir="auto"><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18547" rel="nofollow">(paper)</a></p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" id="user-content-overview" dir="auto"><a href="#overview">Overview</a></h2>
<p dir="auto"><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.09685" rel="nofollow">Low rank adapation</a> (LoRA) is a parameter efficient way to add new knowledge to a pretrained LLM. Although the pretrained LLM takes 100s of GB storage, a LoRA finetuned model only adds 1% storage and memory overhead. Punica enables running multiple LoRA finetuned models at the cost of running one.</p>
<p dir="auto">How?</p>
<p dir="auto">Assuming <code>W</code> of shape <code>[H1, H2]</code> is the weight of the pretrained model, LoRA adds two small matrices <code>A</code> of shape <code>[H1, r]</code> and <code>B</code> of <code>[r, H2]</code>. Running a input <code>x</code> on the finetuned model would be <code>y := x @ (W + A@B)</code>, which is the same as <code>y := x@W + x@A@B</code>.</p>
<p dir="auto">When there are <code>n</code> LoRA models, there will be <code>A1</code>, <code>B1</code>, <code>A2</code>, <code>B2</code>, ..., <code>An</code>, <code>Bn</code>.  Given a input batch <code>X := (x1,x2,...,xn)</code> that maps to each LoRA model, the output is <code>Y := X@W + (x1@A1@B1, x2@A2@B2, ..., xn@An@Bn)</code>. The left-hand-side computes the input batch on the pretrained model. It is quite efficient. The latency is almost the same as when there's only one input, thanks to the strong <a href="https://le.qun.ch/en/blog/2023/05/13/transformer-batching/" rel="nofollow">batching effect</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto">We figured out an efficient way to compute the right-hand-side (the LoRA addon). We encapsulate this operation in a CUDA kernel, called Segmented Gather Matrix-Vector multiplication (SGMV), as illustrated below.</p>
<p dir="auto"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/punica-ai/punica/blob/master/assets/sgmv.png"><img src="https://github.com/punica-ai/punica/raw/master/assets/sgmv.png" alt="SGMV"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">In the following microbenchmark figure, we can observe the strong batching effect of the pretrained model. Naive implementation of LoRA is slow, as depicted in the orange line. LoRA implemented via SGMV is effificent and preserves the strong batching effect.</p>
<p dir="auto"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/punica-ai/punica/blob/master/assets/backbone-vs-sgmv.png"><img src="https://github.com/punica-ai/punica/raw/master/assets/backbone-vs-sgmv.png" alt="SGMV is fast and maintains strong batching effect"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The following figure shows the text generation throughput comparison between Punica and other systems, including <a href="https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/">HuggingFace Transformers</a>, <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/DeepSpeed">DeepSpeed</a>, <a href="https://github.com/NVIDIA/FasterTransformer">FasterTransformer</a>, <a href="https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm">vLLM</a>. The benchmark considers different settings of LoRA model popularity. <em>Distinct</em> means that each request is for a different LoRA model. <em>Identical</em> means that all requests are for the same LoRA model. <em>Uniform</em> and <em>Skewed</em> are in between. <strong>Punica achieves 12x throughput compared to state-of-the-art systems.</strong></p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://eslint.org/blog/2022/07/interesting-bugs-caught-by-no-constant-binary-expression/">https://eslint.org/blog/2022/07/interesting-bugs-caught-by-no-constant-binary-expression/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38196644">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <p>In <a href="https://eslint.org/blog/2022/04/eslint-v8.14.0-released">ESLint v8.14.0</a> I contributed a new core rule called <a href="https://eslint.org/docs/rules/no-constant-binary-expression">no-constant-binary-expression</a> which has surprised me with the wide variety of subtle and interesting bugs it has been able to detect.</p>
<p>In this post I’ll explain what the rule does and share some examples of real bugs it has detected in popular open source projects such as Material UI, Webpack, VS Code, and Firefox as well as a few interesting bugs that it found internally at Meta. I hope these examples will convince you to try enabling the rule in the projects you work on!</p>
<h2 id="what-does-no-constant-binary-expression-do%3F" tabindex="-1">What does <code>no-constant-binary-expression</code> do?</h2>
<p>The rule checks for comparisons (<code>==</code>, <code>!==</code>, etc) where the outcome cannot vary at runtime, and logical expressions (<code>&amp;&amp;</code>, <code>??</code>, <code>||</code>) which will either <em>always</em> or <em>never</em> short-circuit.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>+x == null</code> will always be false, because <code>+</code> will coerce <code>x</code> into a number, and a number is never nullish.</li>
<li><code>{ ...foo } || DEFAULT</code> will never return <code>DEFAULT</code> because objects are always truthy.</li>
</ul>
<p>Both of these are examples of expressions that <em>look</em> like they can affect the way the program evaluates, but in reality, do not.</p>
<p>This rule originally started as just an attempt to detect unnecessary null checks. However, as I worked on it, I realized useless null checks were just a special case of a broader category: useless code. Eventually it clicked for me: developers don’t intend to write useless code, and code that does not match the developer’s intent is by definition a bug. Therefore, any useless code you can detect is a bug.</p>
<p>This realization was confirmed for me when I ran the first version of the rule against our code base at Meta, and it detected a wide variety of subtle and interesting bugs which had made it through code review.</p>
<h2 id="real-world-bugs-found-with-no-constant-binary-expressions" tabindex="-1">Real world bugs found with <code>no-constant-binary-expressions</code></h2>
<p>In this section I’ll share a number of types of bugs that this rule can catch. Each includes at least one concrete example detected in a popular open source project. My choice to include real examples here is not to shame anyone or any project, but to drive home the fact that these are errors that any team can easily make.</p>
<h3 id="confusing-operator-precedence" tabindex="-1">Confusing operator precedence</h3>
<p>The most common class of bug the rule finds is places where developers misunderstood the precedence of operators, particularly unary operators like <code>!</code>, <code>+</code> and <code>typeof</code>.</p>
<pre><code><span><span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>!</span>whitelist<span>.</span><span>has</span><span>(</span>specifier<span>.</span>imported<span>.</span>name<span>)</span> <span>==</span> <span>null</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span></span><br><span>  <span>return</span><span>;</span></span><br><span><span>}</span></span></code></pre>

<h3 id="confusing-%3F%3F-and-%7C%7C-precedence" tabindex="-1">Confusing <code>??</code> and <code>||</code> precedence</h3>
<p>When trying to define default values, people get confused with expressions like <code>a === b ?? c</code> and assume it will be parsed as <code>a === (b ?? c)</code>. When in actuality it will be parsed as <code>(a === b) ?? c</code>.</p>
<pre><code><span><span>shouldShowWelcome</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span></span><br><span>  <span>return</span> <span>this</span><span>.</span>viewModel<span>?.</span>welcomeExperience <span>===</span> WelcomeExperience<span>.</span>ForWorkspace <span>??</span> <span>true</span><span>;</span></span><br><span><span>}</span></span></code></pre>
<p><em>From <a href="https://github.com/captbaritone/vscode/blob/ab86e0229d6b4d0cb49cfd6747c92cafcd2bd4af/src/vs/workbench/contrib/testing/browser/testingExplorerView.ts#L118:L118">VS Code</a></em></p>
<p><em>Aside: Observing how frequently developers get confused by operator precedence inspired me to experiment with <a href="https://jordaneldredge.com/blog/a-vs-code-extension-to-combat-js-precedence-confusion/">a VS Code extension</a> to visually clarify how precedence gets interpreted.</em></p>
<h3 id="expecting-objects-to-be-compared-by-value" tabindex="-1">Expecting objects to be compared by value</h3>
<p>Developers coming from other languages where structures are compared by value, rather than by reference, can easily fall into the trap of thinking they can do things like test if an object is empty by comparing with a newly created empty object. Or course in JavaScript, objects are compared by reference, and no value can ever be equal to a newly constructed object literal.</p>
<p>In this example, <code>hasData</code> will always be set to true because <code>data</code> can never be referentially equal to a newly created object.</p>
<pre><code><span>hasData <span>=</span> hasData <span>||</span> data <span>!==</span> <span>{</span><span>}</span><span>;</span></span></code></pre>
<p><em>From <a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/try/rev/0fe5678fb8b71f4eb26f0a153c52d0be45fc5ac1#l3.34">Firefox</a> (also: <a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/try/rev/0fe5678fb8b71f4eb26f0a153c52d0be45fc5ac1#l1.13">Firefox</a>)</em></p>
<h3 id="expecting-empty-objects-to-be-false-or-null" tabindex="-1">Expecting empty objects to be <code>false</code> or <code>null</code></h3>
<p>Another common categrory of JavaScript error is expecting empty objects to be nullish or falsy. This is likely an easy mistake to make for folks coming from a language like Python where empty lists and dictionaries are falsy.</p>
<pre><code><span><span>const</span> newConfigValue <span>=</span> <span>{</span> <span>...</span>configProfiles <span>}</span> <span>??</span> <span>{</span><span>}</span><span>;</span></span></code></pre>

<h3 id="is-it-%3E%3D-or-%3D%3E%3F" tabindex="-1">Is it <code>&gt;=</code> or <code>=&gt;</code>?</h3>
<p>I’ve only seen this particular typo once, but I wanted to include it because it’s a great example of the unexpected types of bugs this rule can catch.</p>
<p>Here, the developer meant to test if a value was greater than or equal to zero (<code>&gt;= 0</code>), but accidentally reversed the order of the characters and created an arrow function that returned <code>0 &amp;&amp; startWidth &lt;= 1</code>!</p>
<pre><code><span><span>assert</span><span>(</span><span>startWidth</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>0</span> <span>&amp;&amp;</span> startWidth <span>&lt;=</span> <span>1</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></span></code></pre>
<p><em>From <a href="https://phabricator.services.mozilla.com/rMOZILLACENTRAL925b8d1ad45f80faee052492b3b43f5120052405">Mozilla</a></em></p>
<h3 id="other-errors-caught-by-no-constant-binary-expression" tabindex="-1">Other errors caught by <code>no-constant-binary-expression</code></h3>
<p>The above five categories of errors are not exhaustive. When I originally ran the first version of this rule on our (very) large monorepo at Meta, it found over 500 issues. While many fell into the categories outlined above, there was also a long-tail of other interesting bugs. Some highlights include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Thinking <code>||</code> allows for set operations: <code>states.includes('VALID' || 'IN_PROGRESS')</code></li>
<li>Thinking primitive functions pass through nulls: <code>Number(x) == null</code></li>
<li>Not knowing primitive <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number/Number">constructors</a> return boxed primitives: <code>new Number(x) === 10</code></li>
</ul>
<p>I never would have set out to lint for these specific issues individually, but by simply trying to identify anything “useless” we were able to find and correct them.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion" tabindex="-1">Conclusion</h2>
<p>As you’ve now seen <code>no-constant-binary-expression</code> is capable of detecting a variety of different types of bugs. The rule accomplishes this not because it’s programmed to look for those specific issues, but because all those bugs have one thing in common: they manifest as useless code.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://labs.quansight.org/blog/building-scipy-with-flang">https://labs.quansight.org/blog/building-scipy-with-flang</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38196412">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>You've probably heard already that Python 3.12 was released recently.
For a while already, we've been getting new feature releases every year,
so perhaps this wasn't big news to you – though there's lots of interesting
stuff in there!</p>
<p>It would appear even more "ordinary" that key packages (think <code>pandas</code>,
<code>matplotlib</code> etc.) in the ecosystem would have a release compatible with the
new Python version shortly after<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-1" id="user-content-fnref-1" data-footnote-ref="true" aria-describedby="footnote-label">1</a></sup>, and broadly speaking, you would be right.
Not that there isn't a huge amount of dedicated maintainers (mostly
volunteers!) working tirelessly behind the scenes to make that happen,
but overall, it's a pretty routine situation.</p>
<p>However, behind the ordinary-seeming "SciPy released builds compatible with
Python 3.12" hides an extraordinary story worth telling, because of how several
unrelated, multi-decade-long timelines happened to clash in a way that could
have very easily led to no Python 3.12-compatible releases for a long time.</p>
<p>To understand why this was such a lucky coincidence (though we tried our best
to tip the scales, <em>a lot</em> of luck was necessary), we need to zoom out a bit
and explore the big players involved in this situation.
Fair warning: In the interest of brevity, the following recap is going to be
incomplete and opinionated.
From our perch on the shoulders of giants, let's take a quick look at the
landscape.</p>
<p>We'll briefly shed some light on the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Why is Fortran still used in so many places?</li>
<li>How is that relevant to Python?</li>
<li>Past struggles of NumPy/SciPy with vanilla Python packaging.</li>
<li>What role conda-forge plays in this context.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you feel you have a good-enough understanding of all this, or not much time,
<a href="#the-situation">skip</a> right past the background. 😉</p>
<h2 id="fortran">Fortran</h2>
<p>… is almost unfathomably old in our day and age.
Started in 1953, first appearing in 1958, it quickly became the most important
programming language of its time, in an age when computing made several
important evolutionary leaps. Most importantly for our story:</p>
<ul>
<li>A lot of scientific code was written in Fortran (meaning often: the
accumulated math knowledge of many decades got crystallised into code), and:</li>
<li>There was a huge number of Fortran compilers, and in the age before Open
Source Software, all of those were proprietary.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="compilers">Compilers</h2>
<p>Depending on how far behind the curtains you've dared to venture, you've
probably at least heard of the concept of a compiler.
Basically, computers have an exceptionally limited amount of operations at
their disposal, and it's agonisingly painful to write anything in those
primitives directly.
The job of the compiler is to translate whatever the programmer is writing in a
given compiled language, and turn it into something the computer can execute.</p>
<p>In many ways they're the closest to the hardware, which is why they often were
hyper-specific to one CPU architecture, or one operating system – not least
because you cannot write an operating system without a compiler, so the two
were often tightly coupled.
For example, Microsoft, from very early on, used its own compiler to create
Windows and all the bits on top of it.</p>
<p>This coupling further compounded the tendencies towards closed source
compilers, because the compiler source code might not only reveal secrets of
the compiler itself, but also of the architecture or the operating system
built with it.
And since vendors were keen to capitalise on every advantage in an intensely
competitive market, there was no incentive to share sources at all.</p>
<p>The pioneer to break that mould was the GNU compiler collection (GCC), which
became one of the key pillars of the nascent Free &amp; Open-Source Software (FOSS)
movement in the 80s and 90s.
The coupling to the operating system still stayed – in this case various
flavours of Unix, most prominently Linux of course – but GCC became a truly
universal compiler when it came to CPU architectures.</p>
<p>Let's visualise this quickly – we have a matrix of Operating Systems (OS) vs.
CPU Architectures; often compilers were specific not just to one OS, but also
1-2 specific architectures (for a long time the most dominant architecture has
been x86, but that has been changing in recent times).
What GCC did was essentially cover an entire column of that matrix, rather than
just 1-2 cells.</p>
<div><table><thead><tr><th>👉 OS<br>👇CPU Arch.</th>
<th>Linux</th>
<th>Windows</th>
<th>macOS</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>x86_32</td>
<td rowspan="6">GCC</td>
<td rowspan="2">MSVC</td>
<td rowspan="3">Apple Clang</td></tr><tr><td>x86_64</td></tr><tr><td>arm64</td>
<td>(added recently)</td></tr><tr><td>aarch64</td>
<td>➖</td>
<td>➖</td></tr><tr><td>ppc64le</td>
<td>➖</td>
<td>➖</td></tr><tr><td>...</td>
<td>➖</td>
<td>➖</td></tr></tbody></table></div>
<p>This matrix would be <em>a lot</em> larger if it included historical OSes and less
common architectures, where support with the respective compiler was often in
a 1:1 relationship (i.e. that combination would cover a single cell in the matrix).
The matrix also does not cover which programming languages a given compiler is
able to process, but for simplicity, you can picture C/C++ here.</p>
<p>Of course, GCC remains usable on macOS due to shared Unix roots, there are ways
to make it work on Windows (through cygwin or MinGW), and the whole truth is
way more <a href="https://www.flother.is/til/llvm-target-triple/">complicated</a> still.
But as a first-order approximation, this shouldn't raise too many eyebrows.</p>
<p>Alright, after a full page about compilers, we can hear you thinking:
"What does all this have to do with Python?!".
And you're right, but just one last thing:</p>
<p>Once a program in C/C++/Fortran/etc. has been compiled, there are <em>a lot</em> of
expectations built into that so-called "binary", which will expect very
explicitly-sized inputs, read things from – and load things into – very
specific CPU registers etc.
Basically, at this point, the training wheels come off, and if you use said
binary under even slightly different circumstances (different sized inputs,
changed order of function arguments, different in-memory layout of some
structure etc., much less another CPU type), you're going to have a bad time.
This is the so-called Application Binary Interface
(<a href="https://pypackaging-native.github.io/background/binary_interface">ABI</a>),
and any compiled program is subject to this.</p>
<h2 id="python">Python</h2>
<p>We won't bore you with the history here, but the immediate thing to note is:
you don't need a compiler to use Python. That's a blessing as well as a curse,
because on the one hand, it dramatically lowers the difficulty of using it,
and on the other hand, this makes Python slow compared to compiled languages.</p>
<p>Python's duck-typing means it will go through many layers of wrapping and
fall-backs, before anything actually is executed.
Sidenote: this process is taken care of by Python's interpreter, which – uh oh…
– has itself been compiled<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-2" id="user-content-fnref-2" data-footnote-ref="true" aria-describedby="footnote-label">2</a></sup>.
Unsurprisingly this approach is slower than a compiled program that will just
run with whatever instructions you've given it (and fail, if any part of the
ABI is violated).</p>
<p>This slow-down doesn't matter so much for prototyping, or general scripting,
but it becomes immensely limiting once there's medium-sized or larger amounts
of data involved.
The best-of-both-worlds solution to this problem was to have performant
compiled code under the hood, but a nice, pythonic "wrapper" around it as the
interface towards the programmer.</p>
<p>Remember all that scientific code that had been written in Fortran?
Things like BLAS and LAPACK were already well-established standards for dealing
with common problems in linear algebra, and so it was an obvious choice to
reuse that when libraries like NumPy and SciPy wanted to expose such
functionality to the Python world.
SciPy additionally also used Fortran code to provide special mathematical
functions and other mathematical tools like interpolation &amp; integration – it's
not like the basic math had changed since the 70s…</p>
<p>However, this came with a terrible price:
Users needed a compiler to install the package.
In the early Python days, when many people were on Linux distributions (which
comes with GCC pre-installed), this was less of an issue.
But it made it extraordinarily difficult to do this in a cross-platform way –
particularly on Windows, it's not common for users to have a compiler
installed, much less know how to use it.</p>
<p>It's even worse on the maintainer-side, because they suddenly need to become
experts in the vagaries of different compilers, linkers and runtime libraries
necessary on different platforms, and with sometimes wildly varying behaviour.</p>
<h2 id="python-packaging">Python packaging</h2>
<p>This situation also happens to be <em>the</em> fundamental problem in Python packaging.
There's so much complexity hiding under the surface, that actually dealing with
it in any kind of sane way is really difficult.
For example, the C &amp; C++ ecosystems never managed to standardise any sort of
build &amp; distribution mechanism, and since Python is wrapping around basically
any flavour of C &amp; C++ code, the problems in Python packaging are a <em>superset</em>
of what's already a hugely pressing issue in C/C++.</p>
<p>The packaging world in Python has had to continually reinvent itself in order
to solve these issues.
It's instructive to check out this
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQsZsgJ30AE&amp;t=200s">historical</a>
overview, to get a feeling of the many iterations things have gone through.</p>
<p><img src="https://labs.quansight.org/posts/building-scipy-with-flang/ABI_meme.jpg" alt="'A meme about a difficult choice in Python packaging, with a cartoon man sweating under the stress of being unable to decide between two buttons labeled &quot;ABI Hell&quot; and &quot;Users need a compiler&quot;'"></p>
<p>One of the biggest problems over the course of this evolution has been
the question about the right way to distribute a package.
Letting users just download the sources is problematic, because:</p>
<ul>
<li>packages can take a lot of time to build.</li>
<li>if the packages is not just pure Python, the user needs a working compiler
setup (and the source code needs to be compatible with that setup!), which is
a huge usability hurdle.</li>
<li>there's no reliable metadata, because even something as fundamental as the
necessary third-party dependencies used to get populated only through running
<code>setup.py</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The alternative – distributing pre-compiled artefacts – is problematic for many
reasons too, and especially fragile in the face of the above-mentioned ABI.
Given the impact of breaking the ABI (random crashes, heisenbugs, etc.), doing
"binary" distribution haphazardly is not an option.</p>
<p>Eventually, a feasible approach for such distribution emerged in the form of
the "wheel" format, which essentially creates a bubble for each package that
brings along all the required libraries, but hides them from others through a
clever mechanism.
While wheels still have some downsides (especially on the maintainer-side),
they are a massive improvement over the situation that existed before, and
nowadays, most Python packages are installable through wheels from PyPI.</p>
<p>But wheels were not around yet at the time when the Scientific Python community
needed to solve some problems they were facing (as well as not versatile enough
conceptually for solving all the key issues involved).
This <a href="http://technicaldiscovery.blogspot.com/2013/12/why-i-promote-conda.html">blog post</a>
by one of the founding contributors of NumPy and SciPy is full of relevant
anecdotes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We in the scientific python community have had difficulty and a rocky history
with just waiting for the Python.org community to solve the [packaging]
problem. With <code>distutils</code> for example, we had to essentially re-write most of
it (as <code>numpy.distutils</code>) in order to support compilation of extensions that
needed Fortran-compiled libraries.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Despite being the product of heroic efforts by many very bright people,
<code>numpy.distutils</code> is generally regarded as a bandaid, and has been in minimal
maintenance mode for years.
This is largely due to fundamental limitations inherent in only having a build
script (e.g. <code>setup.py</code>), without a way to precisely control in advance the
conditions under which a package gets built.
Again from that blog post:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[...] <code>numpy.distutils</code> replaces most of the innards of <code>distutils</code> but is
still shackled by the architecture and imperative approach to what should
fundamentally be a declarative problem.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In many ways, this is what led to the creation of conda:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Therefore, you can't really address the problem of Python packaging without
addressing the core problems of trying to use <code>distutils</code> (at least for the
NumPy stack). The problems for us in the NumPy stack started there and have
to be rooted out there as well. This was confirmed for me at the first PyData
meetup at Google HQ, where several of us asked Guido [van Rossum; Python's
BDFL at the time] what we can do to fix Python packaging for the NumPy stack.
Guido's answer was to "solve the problem ourselves".</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="conda--conda-forge">conda &amp; conda-forge</h2>
<p>Conda was designed to take a more holistic view of all the things that are
required for packaging – including the non-Python bits – and unsurprisingly,
done in a declarative way. The basis for this is a "recipe" that explicitly
defines relevant quantities (e.g. what needs to be present in the build
environment), before the first line of any build script is ever run.</p>
<p>This introduced an unfortunate bifurcation in the Python world, because other
Python tools like pip cannot install conda-packages, yet what conda had done
did not easily fit into the standardisation-by-consensus model<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-3" id="user-content-fnref-3" data-footnote-ref="true" aria-describedby="footnote-label">3</a></sup>, primarily
because many things essential to conda were considered "out of scope" by the
wider Python packaging community.</p>
<p>However, for users and maintainers of packages that are affected by some of the
<a href="https://pypackaging-native.github.io/">deep-seated issues</a> in Python packaging,
it provided a much more powerful solution and got adopted widely – especially
in scientific computing, though by far not everywhere.
While the recipes conda uses are the basis for many key features (e.g. having
enough control to ensure that the ABI is kept consistent, or that packages are
recompiled where necessary), this means in turn that integrating a given
package into the conda world requires creating such a recipe in the first place.</p>
<p>Given the size of the ecosystem, not even a company like Anaconda<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-4" id="user-content-fnref-4" data-footnote-ref="true" aria-describedby="footnote-label">4</a></sup> could
hope to integrate everything that users wanted, and over time, the
community-driven conda-forge channel became <em>the</em> place to do this integration
work.
Anyone can <a href="https://github.com/conda-forge/staged-recipes/">submit</a> recipes
for a package that is missing, or provide fixes for those that are already
being built on so-called "feedstocks".</p>
<p>One of the things that complicates matters is that conda-forge – as a
philosophy – is aiming to support all common platforms, and even some less
common ones.
This multiplies the kind of problems a Linux distribution might have by at
least ~three, because very often a <em>different</em> set of problems will appear
for macOS and Windows.
To have any chance at success, conda-forge uses the platform defaults
(compiler, standard library, ABI, etc.) wherever possible.</p>
<p>Conda-forge is almost 100% volunteer-run, and dependent on public CI resources
like those provided by Azure Pipelines, as well as Anaconda footing the bill
for the hosting and download traffic of all the hosted artefacts.
On top of that, conda-forge cannot arbitrarily package things where the licence
does not allow it.
There is no hidden layer for build tools; anyone can download and install the
packages that the infrastructure is made of (or the underlying docker images),
and that means conda-forge cannot use proprietary compilers<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-5" id="user-content-fnref-5" data-footnote-ref="true" aria-describedby="footnote-label">5</a></sup>, but must use
what's freely available.</p>
<p>Remember how we discussed above that all Fortran compilers are proprietary
(except gfortran as part of GCC), and how GCC is not directly usable on Windows?
This has been a huge issue for conda-forge, especially as the expectation of
general support on Windows became more and more wide-spread.
For a very long time, conda-forge was not able to build SciPy at all due to this.
Instead it had to rely on packages from the Anaconda channels<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-6" id="user-content-fnref-6" data-footnote-ref="true" aria-describedby="footnote-label">6</a></sup>, until some
particularly talented contributors hacked together an unholy amalgamation of
MSVC (c.f. the default ABI on Windows) and gfortran, first in SciPy
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210616203153/https://pav.iki.fi/blog/2017-10-08/pywingfortran.html">itself</a>
and later on the
<a href="https://github.com/conda-forge/scipy-feedstock/pull/146">feedstock</a>
in conda-forge.</p>
<h2 id="the-situation">The situation</h2>
<p>To recap:</p>
<ul>
<li>SciPy uses a lot of Fortran code, having incorporated existing and standard
implementations (like BLAS &amp; LAPACK) for mathematical computations.</li>
<li>This did not play well with Python's native build tools, leading to the
creation of <code>numpy.distutils</code>, which is however considered a bandaid and in
minimal maintenance mode.</li>
<li>The Python packaging world has been continually reinventing itself to
overcome burning problems that are due to the immense complexity being
wrapped by Python packages.</li>
<li>A parallel ecosystem has arisen around conda &amp; conda-forge, for packages
and users that were underserved by the standard tools for Python packaging.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is where our story starts in earnest.
Going back for many years already, the situation around <code>distutils</code> and
<code>setuptools</code> had been a source of great pain in the Python packaging world.
The two (in close interaction) represented the de-facto standard way of
building Python packages, but changing anything about them was extremely hard
because of how many use-cases had to be considered, how much everything had
grown organically, and so on.</p>
<p>The next evolutionary step turned out to be the combination of PEP517 / PEP518,
which promised a level playing field between various possible build tools, and
a way to specify the required information through a new interface
(<code>pyproject.toml</code>).
This eventually gained enough traction that <code>distutils</code> got scheduled for
removal from the Python standard library per version 3.12.</p>
<p>However, this had far-reaching consequences for all the things in Python-land
which had grown around <code>distutils</code>, and even more so for things layered on top.
The maintainers of <code>numpy.distutils</code> took the decision that they're not going
to maintain this layer going forward – even though <code>setuptools</code> ingested much
of the <code>distutils</code> interface, it did so in ways that were subtly incompatible
with what <code>numpy.distutils</code> did, and ultimately no-one wanted to keep
maintaining this old pile of hacks any longer than absolutely necessary.</p>
<p>This kicked off a flurry of work – already years ago, because NumPy and SciPy
are under excellent stewardship – to find a better solution.
SciPy in particular took a long, hard look at the landscape, and
<a href="https://labs.quansight.org/blog/2021/07/moving-scipy-to-meson">decided</a>
to go with Meson as a build tool, which had a nice Python-style feel to it, and
less of the historic baggage or cumbersome DSL of CMake.
This was a far-reaching and forward-looking decision at the time, not least
because Meson did not yet support all the things that would be necessary to
pull things off.</p>
<p>To put this effort into context, all this required many, many engineering
months of highly talented people over the last ~2.5 years.
Unbeknownst to most, we are benefitting from the great foresight of the SciPy
and NumPy developers in tackling the issue this far in advance, rather than
having an "uh oh" moment once Python 3.12 is released.</p>
<p>It's necessary to note that Meson as a build tool has a much broader audience
than Python developers – it is used widely for C &amp; C++ projects for example<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-7" id="user-content-fnref-7" data-footnote-ref="true" aria-describedby="footnote-label">7</a></sup>.
As part of an overall design ideology to bring some much-needed sanity to this
space (and especially the world of C/C++ where no uniform solution exists),
Meson will not let you do things that are sure to go wrong in all but the most
expert hands.</p>
<p>In particular, Meson was going to refuse to accept the MSVC+gfortran
combination that was in use in conda-forge.
In fact, it looked like we were going to be completely boxed in.
As of Python 3.12:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>distutils</code> would be gone, and contemporary <code>setuptools</code> incompatible with
<code>numpy.distutils</code>.</li>
<li>Meson would refuse to work with the hack conda-forge was using.</li>
<li>There were no free (and ABI-compatible) Fortran compilers on Windows <em>at all</em>.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="fortran-the-revival">Fortran, the revival</h2>
<p>While Fortran has long been the butt of the joke in IT departments the world
over, in a curious twist of fate, it has seen a dramatic resurgence over the
last few years.
While the reasons for this are not exactly obvious (at least to us!), a few
possible explanations are:</p>
<ul>
<li>It has relatively simple syntax, and maps well to the structure of
mathematical formulae.</li>
<li>It produces performant code, especially in combination with parallelisation
frameworks like OpenMP.</li>
<li>Due to the large amount of Fortran code in scientific computing, and the
promised performance gains through GPUs, it became an attractive target for
supporting GPU computations.</li>
</ul>
<p>As such, there was renewed vigour in the Fortran compiler space, and several
important developments happened in short succession.
For example, PGI / NVIDIA open sourced a version of their compiler called
pgfortran with a new backend based on LLVM (more on that below), which later
turned into what's now known as "classic" Flang.
In the process of trying to upstream this into LLVM itself, the compiler got
rewritten completely under the name f18, which later turned into "new" Flang
that eventually got merged into LLVM itself.
Pretty much at the
<a href="https://fortran-lang.discourse.group/t/what-is-the-exact-difference-between-llvm-flang-and-lfortran/901/17">same time</a>,
another group started developing a Fortran compiler based on LLVM: LFortran.</p>
<h2 id="llvm--clang">LLVM &amp; Clang</h2>
<p>Further up we had looked at a matrix of Operating Systems versus CPU
architectures, and how most compilers tended to only cover 1-2 "cells", whereas
GCC covered essentially all possible architectures on Linux – i.e. a whole
column of the matrix.</p>
<p>As it happened, the last dimension of universality was tackled by another large
project that grew from a research project into a fully cross-architecture and
cross-platform compiler infrastructure<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-8" id="user-content-fnref-8" data-footnote-ref="true" aria-describedby="footnote-label">8</a></sup>: LLVM, and its flagship compiler Clang.
This was an absolutely massive undertaking, but due to its cross-platform
nature, permissive licensing, and modular infrastructure, has become <em>the</em>
focal point of efforts around all kinds of compiler development.</p>
<p>Without going into the technical details, LLVM provides several so-called
"Intermediate Representations" (IRs), which are somewhere in between machine
code and the code that most programmers write, but in a way that is
language-agnostic.
In particular, it would be possible to target the LLVM IRs from Fortran, and
then automatically benefit from all the "backends" that do most of the heavy
optimization work between the IRs and the actual CPU architecture.</p>
<p>This made LLVM an attractive foundation for these new Fortran compiler efforts,
and both incarnations of Flang as well as LFortran followed this approach,
though with different aims in what they built on top.</p>
<h2 id="compiler-bingo">Compiler bingo</h2>
<p>All of these FOSS Fortran compilers attracted great hope to unblock the general
situation regarding the lack of free Fortran compilers on Windows.
Classic Flang already had preliminary support for Windows, but this never fully
took off, not least as the lion's share of resources behind Flang was
refocussed on getting the rewritten version merged into LLVM itself.</p>
<p>But these were not the only changes happening in this space.
For example, Intel did a major overhaul of their Fortran compiler (also basing
it on LLVM), and started making it freely available, though not open source.
Unfortunately this precludes conda-forge from using it, unless Intel themselves
packages the compilers for us;
we <a href="https://github.com/conda-forge/intel-compiler-repack-feedstock/issues/15">asked</a>,
but there was no timeline.</p>
<p>Furthermore, through the Mingw-w64 project, it slowly started to become possible
to use gfortran with Microsoft's "Universal C Runtime" (UCRT), which is
essentially the biggest hurdle in achieving ABI-compatibility on Windows.
However, switching out the underlying C standard library would represent a
<a href="https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-forge.github.io/issues/1654">major</a>
overhaul in the MinGW stack for windows within conda-forge, and was also not
something we could count on to be ready in time.</p>
<p>For people on the sidelines like ourselves, this turned into something akin to
"Waiting for Godot" – a seemingly endless period as things kept stretching and
stretching and stretching out further into the future.
To give some perspective, things already seemed "not too far out" 3-4 years
<a href="https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-forge.github.io/issues/961#issuecomment-597094501">ago</a>.</p>
<p>At this point you may be asking yourself:
"wait a second… how did SciPy actually switch to Meson, if there are no Fortran
compilers for Windows?"</p>
<h2 id="how-upstream-scipy-does-it-for-now">How upstream SciPy does it (for now)</h2>
<p>While SciPy has some amount of funding through grants and such, and could
conceivably pay for a compiler licence to use for producing wheels, the
requirements of building things in CI regularly – to avoid the otherwise
inevitable bitrot – would cost a lot and not be a judicious use of the limited
funds available.</p>
<p>What ended up happening is that one lone developer managed to custom-build a
MinGW-based toolchain, carefully adapted to use the right-sized integers and to
conform to the MSVC ABI.
This is enough to pass through Meson's sanity checks (after all, GCC is a
consistent toolchain), however it is again subtly-yet-crucially different from
the requirements that would be necessary for wide-spread use in conda-forge.</p>
<h2 id="conda-forge-and-the-migration-problem">conda-forge and the migration problem</h2>
<p>One final aspect in the whole saga is that conda-forge has some additional
constraints in terms of how large-scale maintenance efforts work, e.g.
something like rolling out a new Python version.
Essentially, this means rebuilding all Python-related feedstocks in the order
how they depend on each other, and the only reasonable way to do it at scale is
to do all OSes and architectures at the same time, as they're all built
simultaneously per feedstock.</p>
<p>So it looked conceivable that we'd end up in a situation where:</p>
<ul>
<li>We have no Windows builds for SciPy, because there's no Fortran compiler
conda-forge can use.</li>
<li>Not being able to rebuild SciPy for Python 3.12 on Windows would either
hold up the migration for at least ~1000 packages that depend on SciPy on
all platforms, or we would have to drop Windows from the Python migration
completely, which would be similarly disruptive and a lot of effort to fix
later.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="a-pious-hope">A pious hope</h2>
<p>So while the <code>distutils</code> removal was coming down the line like an oncoming
freight train, all we could try to do was cross our fingers that <em>one</em> Fortran
compiler would be ready in time (most likely either llvm-flang or LFortran), and
be as prepared as possible in terms of having all the other pieces ready to go.
LLVM is a big baby, and keeping all the pieces involved up-to-date is a
non-trivial exercise already<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-9" id="user-content-fnref-9" data-footnote-ref="true" aria-describedby="footnote-label">9</a></sup>, but we put extra effort into trying to
identify potential problems with Flang early on, both in our own
<a href="https://github.com/conda-forge/flang-feedstock/pull/27">infrastructure</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/issues/60730">as well as</a>
<a href="https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/issues/63712">upstream</a>.</p>
<p>But no matter how motivated we were to pursue this, the iron-clad constraints
of FOSS remain at play: no-one can take care of everything, much less keep all
the required knowledge in their head.
That means we need other people's input &amp; feedback – and when everyone's a
volunteer<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-10" id="user-content-fnref-10" data-footnote-ref="true" aria-describedby="footnote-label">10</a></sup>, things can take a while.</p>
<p>As it happened, the release of LLVM 17.0 was coming up, which would be the first
release where Flang had matured enough to remove the <code>-flang-experimental-exec</code>
flag, and was <a href="https://discourse.llvm.org/t/proposal-rename-flang-new-to-flang/69462/33">estimated</a>
to be roughly "0.8 level maturity".
As soon as we had the release candidates built in conda-forge, we tried to throw
it at SciPy, only to realise that Meson did not support the new Flang yet.</p>
<p>Even worse, it wasn't clear which ABI Flang was using (as mentioned above,
conda-forge uses the default ABI on Windows everywhere), not least because the
Clang driver which Flang uses under the hood can target both modes.
Unfortunately, it wasn't clear which mode was being chosen, and generally it
looked like Windows support was (as often happens in FOSS) the least mature
platform.</p>
<p>To top it off, there are also two different standard libraries, two different
runtime libraries and two different linkers to consider in all this – all of
which had the potential to lead to subtle breakage.
At this point, we still hadn't compiled more than a "Hello World!" example with
Flang, so it wasn't even clear that it could compile all of SciPy, much less
pass the test suite...</p>
<h2 id="eucatastrophe">Eucatastrophe</h2>
<p>The final push came once SciPy got <a href="https://github.com/scipy/scipy/pull/19317">ready</a>
to remove support for <code>setup.py</code>, the last link to the "old world" before the
removal of <code>distutils</code>.
With some kind hints from the Meson devs and a bit of persistence, we managed to
teach Meson to be able to handle llvm-flang just enough to compile something.
We eventually passed the first build, and after some more wrangling with Meson,
the first installation too.</p>
<p>What happened next felt like nothing short of magical – while we were expecting
test failures, hangs or even crashes, the test suite… just passed 100%?!</p>
<div><p><code><br><div><p><span> ........................................................................ [ 99%]</span></p></div><div><p><span> .................................................s.......                [100%]</span></p></div><div><p><span> = 54987 passed, 2866 skipped, 245 xfailed, 11 xpassed, 1 warning in 979.88s (0:16:19) =</span></p></div><div><p><span> Resource usage statistics from testing scipy-tests:</span></p></div><div><p><span>    Process count: 43</span></p></div><div><p><span>    CPU time: Sys=0:01:20.6, User=0:29:59.3</span></p></div><div><p><span>    Memory: 1.7G</span></p></div><div><p><span>    Disk usage: 1.8K</span></p></div><div><p><span>    Time elapsed: 0:16:24.6</span></p></div><br></code></p></div>
<p>55'000 tests, and not a single failure? When does that ever happen on the first
try after major surgery?</p>
<p>Somehow, armed only with a pre-release of a still-experimental compiler and a
hastily patched-up build system, we managed to dodge the freight train, and the
migration in conda-forge could progress past SciPy with no more than a few days
delay, rather than being stuck for months.
In the end, the respective SciPy builds in conda-forge were available two days
after the release of Python 3.12.0.</p>
<h2 id="epilogue">Epilogue</h2>
<p>At the end of this journey, we can only marvel at how long and winding the ways
have been that lead us here.
Depending on where you draw the line, hundreds or even thousands of person
years of effort went into the ingredients that were necessary for us to achieve
the final result (SciPy, Meson, Flang, LLVM, LAPACK etc.).
We cannot realistically thank everyone, but a few call-outs nevertheless:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ralf Gommers, for tirelessly positive support and for outstanding
stewardship of NumPy and SciPy, and driving the massive effort to move
SciPy to Meson.</li>
<li>Isuru Fernando, for building &amp; maintaining some of the trickiest pieces in
conda-forge, and consistently helping out with keeping them running or
building on top of them, as well as reviewing with incredible expertise.</li>
<li>The Meson developers, for a clean build system with a solid design philosophy.</li>
<li>The Flang developers, for providing the world with an open source Fortran
compiler that also works on Windows.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>We are also very grateful that this work was supported in part by a grant from
NASA to SciPy, scikit-learn, pandas and NumPy under the NASA ROSES 2020 program.</em></p>
<p>PS. In case you're still wondering what the "eu" in eucatastrophe
<a href="https://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Eucatastrophe">means</a>, it's a neologism coined
by J. R. R. Tolkien from Greek ευ- "good" and καταστροφή "sudden turn".
Quoting from the link above: "In essence, a eucatastrophe is a massive turn in
fortune from a seemingly unconquerable situation to an unforeseen victory,
usually brought by grace rather than heroic effort.
Such a turn is catastrophic in the sense of its breadth and surprise and
positive in that a great evil or misfortune is averted."</p>

    <div property="schema:text"><p>November 8, 2023, Mountain View, CA <strong><em>–</em></strong> <a href="https://www.seti.org/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">The SETI Institute</a>, a non-profit scientific research organization, announced today a philanthropic gift of $200m from the estate of Franklin Antonio, a visionary supporter and catalyst of the work of the SETI Institute for more than 12<strong> </strong>years. Co-founder of communications chip company, Qualcomm, Antonio passed away on May 13, 2022, leaving behind an extraordinary legacy to enable breakthrough science in the search for intelligent life beyond our world.&nbsp;</p>

<div><p>With more than 100 scientists actively conducting research across 173 separate programs, the SETI Institute explores six key science disciplines: Astronomy and Astrophysics; Exoplanets; Planetary Exploration; Astrobiology; Climate and bio-geoscience; and the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI).</p><p>
“Guided by our core mission and Franklin Antonio’s vision, we now have the opportunity to elevate and expedite our research and make new discoveries to benefit all humanity for generations to come,” said SETI Institutes President &amp; CEO Bill Diamond. “In his memory, the SETI Institute will continue its pursuit of one of the biggest and most profound questions in all of science, a question as old as humanity itself – are we alone in the universe?”</p><p>
This gift enables the SETI Institute to undertake more missions and expand research priorities to push the boundaries of human knowledge in exploring life beyond our planet and the origins of life here on Earth. Examples include:<strong> </strong></p></div>

<ul><li>Establish postdoctoral fellowships and internal grants for science and education programs</li>
	<li>Enable the SETI Institute’s research base to expand and extend its reach globally through new international collaborations</li>
	<li>Develop new educational programs and initiatives, particularly focused on reaching and engaging underserved communities</li>
	<li>Support the development of innovative observational technologies and analytical instruments</li>
</ul><div><p>“Not only was Franklin the primary benefactor of SETI research at the Allen Telescope Array (ATA), but he was an integral part of the technical team. His extraordinary knowledge of communications technology was invaluable in upgrading the ATA to the world-class radio telescope instrument it is today,” said Dr. Andrew Siemion, Bernard M. Oliver Chair of SETI Research at the SETI Institute and Director of SETI Research at the University of Oxford.</p><p>
Currently, SETI-focused projects are eligible for only limited federal funding through research grants and otherwise depend entirely on philanthropic support and private funding. As such, Antonio’s gift will also serve to permanently endow core SETI programs and foster new global partnerships.</p><p>
“This gift will impact all research domains of the SETI Institute,” said Dr. Nathalie Cabrol, Director of the Carl Sagan Center for Research. “It will provide our teams the freedom to pursue their own science priorities, and to examine the technological, philosophical and societal impact of their research on our daily lives here on Earth.”</p></div>

<p>Voters in Maine <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/11/07/us/elections/results-maine-question-4-right-to-repair.html?ref=404media.co">overwhelmingly passed a ballot</a> measure Tuesday that enshrines the right to repair cars, a major win for consumers and a blow to auto manufacturers who have spent millions lobbying against similar legislation and fighting against it in the courts.</p><p>“Question 4,” which enshrines consumers’ data access to car diagnostics for the purposes of repair, <a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Maine_Question_4,_%22Right_to_Repair_Law%22_Vehicle_Data_Access_Requirement_Initiative_(2023)?ref=404media.co">passed by a margin of 84.3-15.7</a> in Tuesday’s election with 94 percent of the votes tallied. The yes/no question was simple: “Do you want to require vehicle manufacturers to standardize on-board diagnostic systems and provide remote access to those systems and mechanical data to owners and independent repair facilities?”&nbsp;</p><p>Maine’s vote shows yet again that right to repair in all of its forms is overwhelmingly popular with consumers, and that they are not swayed by fear mongering campaigns from manufacturers. A similar measure in 2020 passed in Massachusetts with 75 percent support from voters.&nbsp;</p><p>In Massachusetts, car manufacturers <a href="https://www.404media.co/biden-administration-changes-mind-says-car-companies-shouldnt-ignore-overwhelmingly-popular-car-repair-law-anymore/">spent tens of millions of dollars</a> on ads that said the law would be used by stalkers and hackers if it was passed. Auto manufacturers have been engaged in a three-year lawsuit there to prevent the law from going into effect. Proponents of the law say it is necessary because car manufacturers are moving toward systems where car diagnostics can only be read wirelessly by people who are authorized by the manufacturer to do so; on cars up to now, such data has been accessible through a wired port underneath the car’s steering wheel.</p><p>“Maine residents have won the right to control their destiny when it comes to car repairs,” Tommy Hickey, director of the Maine Automotive Right to Repair Coalition, told 404 Media. “There’s a new technology in cars, they’ve become computers on wheels, and with this law owners in Maine will be the gatekeepers of that information.” Hickey also worked on the Massachusetts law in 2020.</p><p>Hickey said that after getting crushed in Massachusetts, auto manufacturers didn’t lobby as hard against the Maine law as they did in Massachusetts: “They didn’t spend nearly as much money,” he said. “When you spend $30 million and you lose 75 percent of the vote, I think the writing is on the wall.”</p><p>Nathan Proctor, head of consumer rights group USPIRG’s right to repair project, told 404 Media that “right to Repair is incredibly popular because it’s common sense—at least to those who aren’t manufacturers. Society works best when we are empowered to fix our stuff.”</p><p>The Maine law is a big deal not just for people in Maine. In the past, when states have passed legislation like this, manufacturers have functionally had to make this data available in other states. An earlier law passed in Massachusetts became de-facto national legislation after manufacturers signed a “Memorandum of Understanding” in which they agreed to comply with the law throughout the country rather than face slightly varying laws in every state.</p><p>The CAR Coalition, which is pushing right to repair legislation throughout the country, told 404 Media that “Maine voters' overwhelming show of support for Question 4 adds momentum to the growing national push for right to repair protections. The CAR Coalition will continue this important fight at the federal level with bipartisan bills like the SMART and REPAIR Acts to ensure every American—no matter where they live—has the right to repair the car they own.”</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><strong>Fixing a street name takes a detour</strong></p>
<p>While making a proposal to update Noto fonts for OpenStreetMap tiles, which fixes an issue with
Kurdish labels using <strong>ڵا</strong>, I noticed a street with mismatched parentheses and was anticipating a deep dive into the tile renderer. But the actual problem was somewhere else:</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.georeactor.com/blog-images/osm-1.png"></p><p>
When I looked at the source data in the Map Data view, the full name appeared to be inside the parentheses:</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.georeactor.com/blog-images/osm-2.png">

<br>
Then in the iD editor, I see a third rendering. This one is in line with the English name having (mshko) in parentheses at the end. Something strange must be happening if I see the same text appearing three ways.
</p><p>

<img src="https://blog.georeactor.com/blog-images/osm-3.png"></p><p>
When I paste the name into the Chrome Ctrl+F or address bar, it matches the OpenStreetMap road label (I check some strings here because it's another place where <strong>ڵا</strong> does not render correctly).
</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.georeactor.com/blog-images/osm-4.png"></p>
<p>So what's the real name? I began looking at the string character by character.<br>
The correct string is شەقامی شەوکەت سەعید (مشکۆ)&nbsp;; Let's talk about it.</p>
<p>The user who wrote the name made a mistake and used ( - the open parenthesis - twice. One became the 0th character of the string and one was at the start of the "mshko" string.</p>
<p>Chrome and the tile renderer were correctly recognizing right-to-left text, and rendering both open parentheses opening toward the left.</p>
<p>On the Map Data viewer, my perception that the full string was wrapped by parentheses was caused by this being in a left-to-right language layout.<br>
When the cell is wide enough for the text to be on one line, the string looks like it did in the iD editor input - it's showing one open parenthesis at the left end of the text, then switches to printing Arabic with another open parenthesis before the word مشکۆ. Both of the parens in this line are the character <strong>(</strong>, just the left-most one is appearing out of sequence from where it would be in a right-to-left language string.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.georeactor.com/blog-images/osm-5.png"></p><div><p>
When we set CSS <code>direction: rtl</code>, or HTML <code>dir="auto"</code> (preferable for multilingual context) on this table cell, then it reveals the mismatched parentheses of the original string, like we saw in the tiles and Chrome:
</p></div>
<p><img src="https://blog.georeactor.com/blog-images/osm-6.png"></p><h2 id="takeaways">Takeaways</h2><p>I've corrected the name of this way on OpenStreetMap, and the new name renders correctly in tiles, Map Data, and iD editor.</p>
<p>Setting the tag value column cells to be <code>dir="auto"</code> - this would help spot errors and being in line with the OSM tiles. I made a pull request on the OpenStreetMap website repo, roughly summarizing the problem and this one-liner fix.</p>
<p>Changing the name input of iD editor - this would affect the left-alignment of text input, and could take people by surprise. iD is going through some kind of PR pause / long-needed canvas/GL rewrite, so I'll hold off on proposing changes for now.</p>

<p>People who buy a Fire TV from Amazon are probably looking for a cheap and simple way to get an affordable 4K smart TV. When <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/09/amazon-new-4k-tvs-fire-tv-stick-4k-max-announced/#:~:text=Amazon%20on%20Thursday%20announced%20its,Amazon's%20Fire%20TV%20operating%20system.">Amazon announced its first self-branded TVs</a> in September 2021, it touted them as being a "great value." But owners of the devices will soon be paying for some of those savings in the form of more prominently displayed advertisements.</p>
<p>Charlotte Maines, Amazon's director of Fire TV advertising, monetization, and engagement, detailed the new types of ads that Amazon is selling on Fire TVs. In a <a href="https://www.streamtvinsider.com/advertising/amazon-fire-tv-intros-new-options-advertisers-including-contextual-sponsored-tiles">StreamTV Insider</a> report from November 1, Amazon said the new ads will allow advertisers to reach an average of 155 million unique monthly viewers.</p>
<p>Some of the changes targeting advertisers, like connecting display placement ads with specific in-stream video ads, seem harmless enough. Others could jeopardize the TV-watching experience for owners.</p>
<h2>New ads tied to generative AI Alexa</h2>
<p>For example, Amazon is preparing to make <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/09/amazons-generative-ai-powered-alexa-is-as-big-a-privacy-red-flag-as-old-alexa/">Alexa with generative AI</a> more useful for finding content on Fire TVs. This could help Alexa, which has struggled alongside other tech giants' voice assistants to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/11/amazon-alexa-is-a-colossal-failure-on-pace-to-lose-10-billion-this-year/">generate significant revenue</a>. Amazon gets money every time someone interacts with digital content through Alexa.</p>
<p>However, the company is double-dipping on this idea by also tying ads to generative AI on Fire TVs. When users ask Alexa to help them find media with queries such as "play the show with the guy who plays the lawyer in <em>Breaking Bad,"&nbsp;</em>they will see ads that are relevant to the search.</p>
<p>Amazon has discussed <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/03/with-amazon-alexas-future-in-peril-fire-tvs-offer-a-glimmer-of-hope/">evolving Alexa</a> into a tool that can not only bring you to the right app for the show you want but that can also <em>recommend&nbsp;</em>specific shows based on prompts like the above. This has been one of the most promising potential futures for the voice assistant. But positioning the feature next to ads seems to prioritize advertisers over Fire TV customers.</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>Maines told StreamTV Insider that advertisers had been asking for a way to advertise against Fire TV searches. “It just makes sense to expand our existing sponsor tile offering to show advertisements on the search screen with no extra effort or cost for the advertiser,” she said.</p>
<p>Finally, Amazon is adding "contextual sponsored tiles" that use machine learning to show ads based on whatever content genre or search term the Fire TV user is browsing.</p>
<h2>“Persistent” ads</h2>
<p>Amazon Fire TV users will also start seeing banner ads on the device's home screen for things that have nothing to do with entertainment or media. This ad space was previously reserved for advertising media and entertainment, making the ads feel more relevant, at least. Amazon opening the ad space to more types of advertisers is similar to a move Google TV made <a href="https://www.flatpanelshd.com/news.php?subaction=showfull&amp;id=1674633052">early this year</a>.</p>
<p>The company seems to be aware of how dominating these types of advertisements can be. Maines emphasized to StreamTV Insider how the native ads are "right at the top of the Fire TV's home screen" and take "up half the screen."</p>
<p>Maines continued, telling StreamTV Insider:</p>
<blockquote><p>It’s persistent, so as a customer browses around the UI… they continue to see it.</p></blockquote>
<p>The banner ads will occupy the first slot in the rotating hero area, which Amazon believes is the first thing Fire TV users see. These users may have purchased a Fire TV primarily for streaming content from <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/11/max-users-grandfathered-into-15-99-ad-free-plan-lose-4k-hdr-next-month/">ad-free subscriptions</a>, but Maines described how Fire TVs can still manage to force ads on these users.</p>
<p>StreamTV Insider reported:</p>
<blockquote><p>Maines explained how with on-device ads, even if viewers ultimately choose to watch something that’s not ad-supported, brand advertisers still have the opportunity to get their message in front of viewers and talk to them as they browse and decide what to watch.</p></blockquote>

Despite increasing its own oil production in recent years, New Mexico has no site with repeated methane leaks, unlike in Texas, which Kayrros said is likely due to a <a href="https://www.governor.state.nm.us/2022/07/28/new-mexicos-nationally-leading-oil-and-gas-emissions-rule-becomes-law/" data-link-name="in body link">2021 state law</a> aimed at curtailing methane emissions from industry.</p><p>“The effect that methane has on the global climate is devastating,” said Antoine Rostand, chief executive of Kayrros. “Good operators will re-inject the gas while others will vent it, which means it’s very easy to eliminate leaks of methane that would have a massive impact upon the climate.”</p><p>Rostand said the difference between visible leaks in Texas and New Mexico is “huge” and should spur governments in the US and other countries to crack down on this pollution. “It seems the regulation in New Mexico has had an impact without hurting business,” he said. “It’s a message of hope because it shows that if you have regulation it works. Governments need to take up their responsibilities with this.”</p><p>Methane is emitted from various activities, such as from the raising of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/oct/06/feeding-seaweed-to-cows-can-cut-methane-emissions-says-swedish-report" data-link-name="in body link">livestock</a>, but oil and gas production is the biggest source of the pollutant in the US and emissions have surged amid a frenzy of new drilling, some of it for fossil fuels to be <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/oct/23/louisiana-gas-export-hub-biden-climate-crisis" data-link-name="in body link">exported overseas</a>.</p><p>Texas, despite being at the epicenter of the oil industry, <a href="https://insideclimatenews.org/news/22012023/texas-epa-methane/" data-link-name="in body link">has scant measures</a> to prevent companies from dumping their unwanted methane into the shared atmosphere. It is “really frustrating that Texas continues to allow oil and gas companies to pollute with impunity when we’ve got a great solution staring us in the eye”, said Luke Metzger, executive director of Environment Texas. “Unfortunately it’s clear that Texas is not going to stand up to big oil and adopt sensible standards to cut methane.”</p><figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement"><a data-ignore="global-link-styling" href="#EmailSignup-skip-link-9">skip past newsletter promotion</a><p id="EmailSignup-skip-link-9" tabindex="0" aria-label="after newsletter promotion" role="note">after newsletter promotion</p></figure><figure id="233f51d9-5cc8-44c0-8895-8ffcfdc2270b" data-spacefinder-role="supporting" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement"><div id="img-2"><picture><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8dc98cde4b694b6eb4eea0031038321a31297a4d/0_0_790_757/master/790.jpg?width=380&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 1300px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 1300px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8dc98cde4b694b6eb4eea0031038321a31297a4d/0_0_790_757/master/790.jpg?width=380&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 1300px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8dc98cde4b694b6eb4eea0031038321a31297a4d/0_0_790_757/master/790.jpg?width=300&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 980px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 980px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8dc98cde4b694b6eb4eea0031038321a31297a4d/0_0_790_757/master/790.jpg?width=300&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 980px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8dc98cde4b694b6eb4eea0031038321a31297a4d/0_0_790_757/master/790.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8dc98cde4b694b6eb4eea0031038321a31297a4d/0_0_790_757/master/790.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 660px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8dc98cde4b694b6eb4eea0031038321a31297a4d/0_0_790_757/master/790.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8dc98cde4b694b6eb4eea0031038321a31297a4d/0_0_790_757/master/790.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 480px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8dc98cde4b694b6eb4eea0031038321a31297a4d/0_0_790_757/master/790.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8dc98cde4b694b6eb4eea0031038321a31297a4d/0_0_790_757/master/790.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 320px)"><img alt="Repeated methane emissions from a Midland county, Texas, compressor station between 2019 and 2022." src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8dc98cde4b694b6eb4eea0031038321a31297a4d/0_0_790_757/master/790.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" width="445" height="426.4113924050633" loading="lazy"></picture></div><figcaption><span><svg width="18" height="13" viewBox="0 0 18 13"><path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"></path></svg></span><span>Repeated methane emissions from a Midland county, Texas, compressor station between 2019 and 2022.</span> Photograph: Kayrros</figcaption></figure><p>Environmentalists have pinned their hopes, therefore, on the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), which is finalizing a new federal rule for new and existing drilling sites <a href="https://www.epa.gov/system/files/documents/2022-11/OIl%20and%20Gas%20Supplemental.%20Overview%20Fact%20Sheet.pdf" data-link-name="in body link">that it says will slash methane emissions</a> from these sources by 87% by 2030, compared with 2005 levels.

I noticed a couple of surprises on this graph:</p><ul><li data-preset-tag="p"><p>With the exception of the initial 2013-2014 crypto wave, ML consistently occupied a larger fraction of front-page stories over the last 13 years.</p></li><li data-preset-tag="p"><p>There was a large, long-lived bump in AI/ML stories that peaked in 2018 and tailed off until 2022, when the current wave of LLM hype began.</p></li></ul><h3>Vibes-based commenting</h3><p>Ok, fraction of all posts is an interesting metric, but I’d love to know how HN commenters <!-- --><strong>feel</strong> about the topics… is there a way to answer that question (without breaking the bank)?<!-- --></p><p>First off, I prepared a dataset of all comments on stories that were classified as either crypto or AI-related. That gets me 2.1M comments. Classifying sentiment toward a particular <!-- --><em>topic</em> is probably too complex for a classical sentiment analysis model (someone could write an angry comment defending crypto), so let’s try GPT-3.5 again. To test, I uploaded 4000 comments to a dataset on <!-- --><a href="https://openpipe.ai/" rel="noopener">OpenPipe</a>*, labeled them with both GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 (you can see the prompt I used <!-- --><a href="https://github.com/corbt/hn-analysis/blob/main/generate-story-classification-training-data.ipynb" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>), and used the evals page to compare the outputs side by side:<!-- --></p><p><img alt="" data-framer-asset="data:framer/asset-reference,pqiczRAkz0mCo1XVtT48rWOoK4.png" data-framer-height="1050" data-framer-width="2350" height="525" src="https://framerusercontent.com/images/pqiczRAkz0mCo1XVtT48rWOoK4.png" width="1175"></p><p>You can see at the top right that GPT-3.5 agrees with GPT-4 (labeled as “Original Output”) only 71.5% of the time. That’s not great, since there are only 3 possible classes. Using filters, I can quickly find the outputs that don’t match, and GPT-4’s answers are clearly better most of the time. Ok fine, how much would it cost to just use GPT-4 then? After all, OpenAI just released price cuts!</p><div><pre translate="no"><code># <!-- --><span>Found </span><span>on </span><span>OpenPipe</span>

We could stick with GPT-3.5, but its accuracy isn’t great. And it would still cost $1K, for less trustworthy results.</p><p>We do have another option though, which is to fine-tune our own model! By using fine tuning, we can get better accuracy with a much smaller model than we'd be able to with a general-purpose prompted model. Smaller models mean faster inference, and much lower prices.

The OpenPipe platform also makes creating a fine-tuned model incredibly easy — it’s literally 2 clicks once your dataset is generated.<!-- --></p><p>In this case we'll fine-tune a <!-- --><a href="https://mistral.ai/news/announcing-mistral-7b/" rel="noopener">Mistral 7B</a> model on the dataset.

And since it’s using the same dataset as before, we can compare it head to head with the GPT-3.5 prompt from earlier. We’ve improved our match rate with GPT-4 from 71.5% to 87.8% — not bad!</p><p><img alt="" data-framer-asset="data:framer/asset-reference,byqF3DClm3THkzpjTDCpbSFx0zE.png" data-framer-height="552" data-framer-width="1978" height="276" src="https://framerusercontent.com/images/byqF3DClm3THkzpjTDCpbSFx0zE.png" width="989"></p><p>Of the 12.2% that our fine tune still got wrong, I quickly reviewed a few dozen. In many cases, there really are multiple “correct” answers — for example, GPT-4 classified <!-- --><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24384570" rel="noopener">this comment</a> as positive towards AI, and the fine-tune classified it as neutral. I think both answers are defensible.<!-- --></p><h3>Just the Facts</h3><p>Ok, let’s plot user sentiment over time!

A couple of observations:</p><ul><li data-preset-tag="p"><p>While sentiment towards AI has always been higher than sentiment towards crypto, AI sentiment steadily dropped from 2010-2018 and has been hovering around neutral for the last 5 years.</p></li><li data-preset-tag="p"><p>Crypto sentiment has a much weaker correlation with the crypto hype cycle than I’d expected. Although it seems like right now not many commenters are popping up to defend FTX/SBF. 😂</p></li></ul><p>Ok so admittedly, we haven’t come away with a clean answer to the question in the title (although for the record, I think the answer is “no”). But we’ve found some interesting trends in the stories posted on the front page of HN, as well as the way the average commenter’s opinion has shifted over time. And hopefully we’ve also learned more about how modern LLM-based tools can solve problems in a few hours that only a couple years ago would have taken an ML team weeks!</p><h2>Addendum: HN Sentiment Overall</h2><p>HN user dragonwriter <!-- --><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38194850" target="_blank" rel="noopener">noted that</a> up until recently, sentiment towards crypto and AI was relatively strongly correlated, and wondered if that was an artifact of HN sentiment just getting more negative overall.<!-- --></p><p>I had actually already run the same analysis for Rust and remote work when preparing this post, and removed them in the interest of brevity.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="__blog-post-container" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Today we are announcing our new library, <a href="https://github.com/automerge/automerge-repo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>automerge-repo</code></a>, which makes it vastly easier to build local-first applications with Automerge. Take a look at our <a href="https://automerge.org/docs/quickstart/">quickstart guide</a> or read on for some background and examples.</p><p>For those new to this idea: local-first applications are a way of building software that allows both real-time collaboration (think Google Docs) and offline working (think Git). They work by storing the user's data locally, on their own device, and syncing it with collaborators in the background. You can read more about the motivation for local-first software <a href="https://inkandswitch.com/local-first/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">in our essay</a>, or watch a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHz17gwiOc8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">talk introducing the idea</a>.</p><p>A challenge in local-first software is how to merge edits that were made independently on different devices, and <a href="https://crdt.tech/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CRDTs</a> were developed to solve this problem. Automerge is a fairly mature CRDT implementation. In fact, we wrote this blog post using it! The API is quite low-level though, and Automerge-Core has no opinion about how networking or storage should be done. Often, the first thing developers ask after discovering Automerge was how to connect it into an actual application.</p><p>Our new library, <code>automerge-repo</code>, extends the collaboration engine of Automerge-Core with networking and storage adapters, and provides integrations with React and other UI frameworks. You can get to building your app straight away by taking advantage of default implementations that solve common problems such as how to send binary data over a WebSocket, how often to send synchronization messages, what network format to use, or how to store data in places like the browser's IndexedDB or on the filesystem.</p><p>If you've been intimidated by the effort of integrating Automerge into your application because of these choices, this library is for you. Now you can simply create a repo, point it to a sync server, and get to work on your app.</p><h2 id="automerge-repo-a-simple-example"><code>automerge-repo</code>: a simple example<a href="#automerge-repo-a-simple-example" aria-label="Direct link to automerge-repo-a-simple-example" title="Direct link to automerge-repo-a-simple-example">​</a></h2><p>Let's start by taking a look at a simple example of how <code>automerge-repo</code> works. To begin, create and configure a repository for Automerge documents.</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>const repo = new Repo({</span><br></span><span><span>  storage: new IndexedDBStorageAdapter("automerge-demo"),</span><br></span><span><span>  network: [new WebsocketClientNetworkAdapter("wss://sync.automerge.org")]</span><br></span><span><span>})</span><br></span></code></pre></div><p>The code in the example above creates a repository and adds a storage and network adapter to it. It tells <code>automerge-repo</code> to store all changes in an IndexedDB table called <code>automerge-demo</code> and to synchronize documents with the WebSocket server at <code>sync.automerge.org</code>. The library is designed to support a wide variety of network transports, and we include a simple client/server WebSocket adapter out of the box. Members of the community are already adding support for other transports, such as WebRTC.</p><p>In this example we're connecting to the public test server hosted by the Automerge team, but you can also run your own sync server. In fact, our <a href="https://github.com/automerge/automerge-repo-sync-server" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sync server</a> runs almost the same code as above, but with a different network and storage adapter.</p><div><p><span><svg viewBox="0 0 14 16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M6.3 5.69a.942.942 0 0 1-.28-.7c0-.28.09-.52.28-.7.19-.18.42-.28.7-.28.28 0 .52.09.7.28.18.19.28.42.28.7 0 .28-.09.52-.28.7a1 1 0 0 1-.7.3c-.28 0-.52-.11-.7-.3zM8 7.99c-.02-.25-.11-.48-.31-.69-.2-.19-.42-.3-.69-.31H6c-.27.02-.48.13-.69.31-.2.2-.3.44-.31.69h1v3c.02.27.11.5.31.69.2.2.42.31.69.31h1c.27 0 .48-.11.69-.31.2-.19.3-.42.31-.69H8V7.98v.01zM7 2.3c-3.14 0-5.7 2.54-5.7 5.68 0 3.14 2.56 5.7 5.7 5.7s5.7-2.55 5.7-5.7c0-3.15-2.56-5.69-5.7-5.69v.01zM7 .98c3.86 0 7 3.14 7 7s-3.14 7-7 7-7-3.12-7-7 3.14-7 7-7z"></path></svg></span>note</p><p>The Automerge project provides a public sync server for you to experiment with <code>sync.automerge.org</code>. This is not a private instance, and as an experimental service has no reliability or data safety guarantees. Basically, it's good for demos and prototyping, but run your own sync server for production uses.</p></div><p>Next, create a document and make some changes to it:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>   &gt; const handle = repo.create()</span><br></span><span><span>   &gt; handle.change(doc =&gt; { doc.hello = "World." })</span><br></span><span><span>   &gt; console.log(handle.url)</span><br></span><span><span>   automerge:2j9knpCseyhnK8izDmLpGP5WMdZQ</span><br></span></code></pre></div><p>The code logs a URL to the document you created. On another computer, or in another browser, you could load this document using the same URL, as shown below:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>   &gt; const handle = repo.find("automerge:2j9knpCseyhnK8izDmLpGP5WMdZQ")</span><br></span><span><span>   &gt; console.log(await handle.doc())</span><br></span><span><span>   // why don't you try it and find out?</span><br></span></code></pre></div><p>What's happening here to make all this work? <code>automerge-repo</code> wraps the core Automerge library and handles all the work of moving the bytes around to make your application function.</p><h2 id="key-concepts--basic-usage">Key Concepts &amp; Basic Usage<a href="#key-concepts--basic-usage" aria-label="Direct link to Key Concepts &amp; Basic Usage" title="Direct link to Key Concepts &amp; Basic Usage">​</a></h2><p>Let's go into a bit more detail. For full documentation please see <a href="https://automerge.org/docs/repositories/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the docs</a>.</p><h3 id="repo">Repo<a href="#repo" aria-label="Direct link to Repo" title="Direct link to Repo">​</a></h3><p>Create a repo by initializing it with an optional storage plugin and any number of network adapters. These are the options for initializing a repo:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>export interface RepoConfig {</span><br></span><span><span>  // A unique identifier for this peer, the default is a random id</span><br></span><span><span>  peerId?: PeerId</span><br></span><span><span>  // Something which knows how to store and retrieve binary blobs</span><br></span><span><span>  storage?: StorageAdapter</span><br></span><span><span>  // Something which knows how to send and receive sync messages</span><br></span><span><span>  network: NetworkAdapter[]</span><br></span><span><span>  // A function which determines whether to share a document with a peer</span><br></span><span><span>  sharePolicy?: SharePolicy</span><br></span><span><span>}</span><br></span></code></pre></div><p>Don't let the usage of "peer" confuse you into thinking this is limited to peer to peer connectivity, <code>automerge-repo</code> works with both client-server and peer-to-peer network transports.</p><p>The main methods on Repo are <code>find(url)</code> and <code>create()</code>, both of which return a <code>DocHandle</code> you can work with.</p><h3 id="handle--automerge-urls">Handle &amp; Automerge URLs<a href="#handle--automerge-urls" aria-label="Direct link to Handle &amp; Automerge URLs" title="Direct link to Handle &amp; Automerge URLs">​</a></h3><p>A <code>DocHandle</code> is a reference to an Automerge document that a <code>Repo</code> syncs and stores . The <code>Repo</code> instance saves any changes you make to the document and syncs with connected peers. Likewise, you can listen over the network for to a <code>Repo</code> for any changes it received.</p><p>Each <code>DocHandle</code> has a <code>.url</code> property. This is a string which uniquely identifies a document in the form <code>automerge:&lt;base58 encoded bytes&gt;</code>. Once you have a URL you can use it to request the document from other peers.</p><h3 id="dochandledoc-and-dochandledocsync"><code>DocHandle.doc()</code> and <code>DocHandle.docSync()</code><a href="#dochandledoc-and-dochandledocsync" aria-label="Direct link to dochandledoc-and-dochandledocsync" title="Direct link to dochandledoc-and-dochandledocsync">​</a></h3><p>These two methods return the current state of the document. <code>doc()</code> is an asynchronous method that resolves when a repository loads the document from storage or retrieves it from a peer (whichever happens first), and <code>docSync()</code> is a synchronous method that assumes the document is already available.
The examples below illustrate asynchronously loading a document or synchronously loading a document and then interacting with it:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>&gt; const handle = repo.find("automerge:2j9knpCseyhnK8izDmLpGP5WMdZQ")</span><br></span><span><span>&gt; const doc = await handle.doc()</span><br></span><span><span>&gt; console.log(doc)</span><br></span></code></pre></div><p>Or </p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>&gt; const handle = repo.find("automerge:2j9knpCseyhnK8izDmLpGP5WMdZQ")</span><br></span><span><span>&gt; handle.whenReady().then(() =&gt; {</span><br></span><span><span>  console.log(handle.docSync())</span><br></span><span><span>})</span><br></span></code></pre></div><p>In this latter example we use <code>DocHandle.whenReady</code>, which returns a promise that the repository resolves when it loads a document from storage or fetches it from another peer in the network.</p><h3 id="change-and-onchange"><code>change()</code> and <code>on("change")</code><a href="#change-and-onchange" aria-label="Direct link to change-and-onchange" title="Direct link to change-and-onchange">​</a></h3><p>Use <code>DocHandle.change</code> when you modify a document.</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>&gt; const handle = repo.find("automerge:2j9knpCseyhnK8izDmLpGP5WMdZQ")</span><br></span><span><span>&gt; await handle.doc()</span><br></span><span><span>&gt; handle.change(d =&gt; d.foo = "bar")</span><br></span></code></pre></div><p>The <code>Repo</code> calls <code>DocHandle.on("change")</code> whenever the document is modified – either due to a local change or a sync message being received from another peer.</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>&gt; const handle = repo.find("automerge:4CkUej7mAYnaFMfVnffDipc4Mtvn")</span><br></span><span><span>&gt; await handle.doc()</span><br></span><span><span>&gt; handle.on("change", ({doc}) =&gt; {</span><br></span><span><span>  console.log("document changed")</span><br></span><span><span>  console.log("New content: ", doc)</span><br></span><span><span>})</span><br></span></code></pre></div><h2 id="integrations">Integrations<a href="#integrations" aria-label="Direct link to Integrations" title="Direct link to Integrations">​</a></h2><p><code>automerge-repo</code> provides a set of primitives that you can use to build a wide range of applications. To make this easier, we have built integrations with a few common UI frameworks. You can easily add further integrations and we welcome contributions which integrate with popular frameworks!</p><h3 id="react-integration">React Integration<a href="#react-integration" aria-label="Direct link to React Integration" title="Direct link to React Integration">​</a></h3><p><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@automerge/automerge-repo-react-hooks" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>@automerge/automerge-repo-react-hooks</code></a> makes it easy to use <code>automerge-repo</code> in a React application. Once you've constructed a <code>Repo</code> you can make it available to your React application using <a href="https://automerge.org/automerge-repo/variables/_automerge_automerge_repo_react_hooks.RepoContext.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>RepoContext</code></a>. Once available, call <code>useHandle</code> to obtain a <code>DocHandle</code>:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>function TodoList(listUrl: AutomergeUrl) {</span><br></span><span><span>    const handle = useHandle(listUrl)</span><br></span><span><span>    // render the todolist</span><br></span><span><span>}</span><br></span></code></pre></div><p>Note that when <code>Repo</code> receives changes over the network or registers local changes, the original Automerge document remains immutable, and any modified parts of the document get new objects. This means that React will only re-render the parts of the UI that depend on a part of the document that has changed.</p><h3 id="svelte-integration">Svelte Integration<a href="#svelte-integration" aria-label="Direct link to Svelte Integration" title="Direct link to Svelte Integration">​</a></h3><p><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@automerge/automerge-repo-svelte-store" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>@automerge/automerge-repo-svelte-store</code></a> provides <code>setContextRepo</code> to set the <code>Repo</code> which is used by the <code>document</code> store:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>&lt;script lang="ts"&gt;</span><br></span><span><span>  import { document } from "@automerge/automerge-repo-svelte-store"</span><br></span><span><span>  import { type AutomergeUrl } from "@automerge/automerge-repo"</span><br></span><span><span></span><br></span><span><span>  export let documentUrl: AutomergeUrl</span><br></span><span><span></span><br></span><span><span>  // Doc is an automerge store with a `change` method which accepts</span><br></span><span><span>  // a standard automerge change function</span><br></span><span><span>  const doc = document&lt;HasCount&gt;(documentUrl)</span><br></span><span><span>  const increment = () =&gt; {</span><br></span><span><span>    doc.change((d: HasCount) =&gt; (d.count = (d.count || 0) + 1))</span><br></span><span><span>  }</span><br></span><span><span>&lt;/script&gt;</span><br></span><span><span></span><br></span><span><span>&lt;button on:click={increment}&gt;</span><br></span><span><span>  count is {$doc?.count || 0}</span><br></span><span><span>&lt;/button&gt;</span><br></span></code></pre></div><h2 id="what-about-x">What about <!-- -->&lt;<!-- -->X<!-- -->&gt;<!-- -->?<a href="#what-about-x" aria-label="Direct link to what-about-x" title="Direct link to what-about-x">​</a></h2><p>We'd love to help you make automerge work in your favorite development environment! Please reach out to us on GitHub or via <a href="https://join.slack.com/t/automerge/shared_invite/zt-e4p3760n-kKh7r3KRH1YwwNfiZM8ktw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">our Slack</a>.</p><h2 id="extending-automerge-repo">Extending <code>automerge-repo</code><a href="#extending-automerge-repo" aria-label="Direct link to extending-automerge-repo" title="Direct link to extending-automerge-repo">​</a></h2><p>You can extend <code>automerge-repo</code> by writing new storage or network adapters.</p><h3 id="storage-adapters">Storage Adapters<a href="#storage-adapters" aria-label="Direct link to Storage Adapters" title="Direct link to Storage Adapters">​</a></h3><p>A storage adapter represents some kind of backend that stores the data in a repo. Storage adapters can be implemented for any key/value store that allows you to query a range of keys with a given prefix. There is no concurrency control required (that's implemented in <code>automerge-repo</code>) so you can safely have multiple repos pointing at the same storage. For example, you could implement an adapter on top of Redis.</p><p>The <code>automerge-repo</code> library provides storage adapters for IndexedDB and the file system (on Node).</p><h3 id="network-adapters">Network Adapters<a href="#network-adapters" aria-label="Direct link to Network Adapters" title="Direct link to Network Adapters">​</a></h3><p>A network adapter represents a way of connecting to other peers. Network adapters raise events when a new peer is discovered or when a message is recieved, and implement a <code>send</code> method for transmitting messages to another peer. <code>automerge-repo</code> assumes a reliable, in-order transport for each peer; as long as you can provide this (e.g. using a TCP connection), you can implement an adapter. You could implement an adapter for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluetooth_Low_Energy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BLE</a>, for example.</p><p>The <code>automerge-repo</code> library provides network adapters for WebSocket, MessageChannel, and BroadcastChannel.</p><h3 id="other-languagesplatforms">Other languages/platforms<a href="#other-languagesplatforms" aria-label="Direct link to Other languages/platforms" title="Direct link to Other languages/platforms">​</a></h3><p>This release of <code>automerge-repo</code> is just for javascript. Automerge is a multi-language library though and there are efforts under way to implement <code>automerge-repo</code> on other platforms. The most mature of these is <a href="https://github.com/automerge/automerge-repo-rs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>automerge-repo-rs</code></a>. We welcome contributions and please reach out if you're starting to develop <code>automerge-repo</code> for a new platform.</p><h2 id="beta-quality">Beta Quality<a href="#beta-quality" aria-label="Direct link to Beta Quality" title="Direct link to Beta Quality">​</a></h2><p><code>automerge-repo</code> works pretty well – we're using it at <a href="https://www.inkandswitch.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ink &amp; Switch</a> for a bunch of internal projects. The basic shape of the API is simple and useful, and not having to think about the plumbing makes it much, much faster to get a useful application off the ground. However, there are some performance problems we're working on:</p><ol><li>Documents with large histories (e.g. a collaboratively edited document with &gt;60,000 edits) can be slow to sync.</li><li>The sync protocol currently requires that a document it is syncing be loaded into memory. This means that a sync server can struggle to handle a lot of traffic on large documents.</li></ol><p>These two points mean that we're not ready to say this project is ready for production. </p><p>We're working hard on fixing the performance so that we <em>can</em> say this is ready for production. But if you are interested in experimenting with the library now, or if you are only going to be working with relatively small documents or low traffic sync servers then you are good to go!</p><p>(If you want us to get to production faster, or you have some specific requirements, please consider <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/automerge" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sponsoring</a> Automerge development 🙂)</p><p>Finally, we don't want to give the impression that everything is smooth sailing. <code>automerge-repo</code> solves a bunch of the hard problems people were encountering around networking and storage. There are still plenty of other difficult problems in local first software where we don't have turnkey solutions: authentication and authorization, end-to-end encryption, schema changes, version control workflows etc. <code>automerge-repo</code> makes many things much easier, but it's a frontier out here.</p></div></div>]]></description>

   <p>This story starts in the fourth dimension.</p>   <p>Or, more specifically, with a British mathematician who, in the late 1800s, was intrigued by the fourth dimension and how to teach disinterested children about it.</p>   <p>Charles Hinton wore a lot of hats. He wrote sci-fi stories before there was sci-fi — he called them "scientific romances." At Princeton, where he worked for a time as mathematics instructor, he invented a baseball pitching machine powered by gunpowder. He also practiced polygamy, which was against both the mores and laws of his native England. And when he was convicted of bigamy in the 1880s, he was forced to move his young family to Japan where he found work teaching mathematics.   </p>   
   <p>We will save all of that for the biopic, because for the purposes of <em>this </em>story, Hinton was the unintentional inspiration behind the jungle gym — the patent for which has just turned 100.</p>   <p>It turns out that the history of the jungle gym, and its sibling the monkey bars, is full of weird and delightful twists and sub-plots that take us from Japan to suburban Chicago and touch on child development theories and, yes, theoretical math.</p>   <h3>Imagining dimensions — in bamboo</h3>   <p>Hinton was a mathematician who explored the concept of the fourth dimension and how to represent it. His model of a tesseract as a way to represent the fourth dimension in geometrical space has since inspired a long lineage of science fiction writing and movies — from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHJBdfmeCss"><em>A Wrinkle in Time</em></a> to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJio07EtKYc"><em>Interstellar</em></a>.</p>   <p>Yet it was while living in Japan that Hinton struggled to get his students to adequately wrestle with the concept of the fourth dimension.</p>   <div id="res1211057397">

   <p>"He said, you know, the reason these students can't grasp the fourth dimension is because they were never exposed to the <em>third </em>dimension as children," says Luke Fannin, a primatologist and Ph.D. candidate at Dartmouth College, who became obsessed with finding out where the term "monkey bars" came from (more on that later) and ended up <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/history-monkey-bars-180981556/">becoming something of a Hinton family expert</a>.</p>   <p>Hinton theorized that since we spend so much of our lives simply walking in straight lines, and not using all of the three-dimensional space around us, we have an even harder time making the mental leap to fourth dimension.</p>   
   <p>His solution was to train young children, namely his own kids, to internalize the third dimension. To pull this off, Hinton built his children a series of stacked bamboo cubes. He labeled the bamboo in all three directions, Fannin says: "Where the junctions would be, he would put X, Y, Z coordinates." Then he attempted to turn these stacked cubes into a game. "He would say, 'X2, Y4, Z3 — go! And all the kids would race each other towards the correct coordinate,'" says Fannin. </p>   <p>If that does not sound like a fun game to you, you are not alone. And those bamboo cubes never amounted to much. But years later, Hinton's son Sebastian would recall how much fun it was to climb and swing on them.</p>   <p>"And he goes, 'That's what I remember. I don't remember anything about the math, but I remember that it was so fun,'" says Fannin.</p>   <p>By now it was the early 1920s, and the junior Hinton had moved to Winnetka, Illinois where he worked as a patent lawyer. He dreamed of recreating the bamboo climbing structure of his youth — minus the not very fun math games — and he started describing his plans at a dinner party one night.</p>   <p>Winnetka at this time was a hotbed for progressive education. The village was taken with the educational philosophy of John Dewey, which called for "whole child education." This meant not just teaching reading, writing and arithmetic, but also how to be healthy and active humans.</p>   <p>So, as Hinton was describing his dream climbing structure, the dinner party was stacked with educators, including the superintendent of the Winnetka City Schools, Carleton Washburne. Fannin says he imagines Washburne's eyes widening before telling Hinton, "We need to build this in the schools!"</p>   <p>Soon after, Hinton began filing his early patents for the design, which he registered to something he called JungleGym Inc. And the rest, as they say, is history.</p>   
   <p>If that dinner party had taken place anywhere else in the world, this iconic piece of equipment may never have existed. Or, as Fannin says, "It only stays in Hinton's backyard. It never becomes sort of the cultural mainstay that is now ubiquitous on most playgrounds."</p>   <h3>The difference between monkeys and apes</h3>   <p>From the outside, there's nothing remarkable about the old Victorian home at 411 Linden Street in Winnetka, Illinois, which these days serves as the headquarters for the town's historical society.</p>   <p>Inside, the 30,000 artifacts range from typewriters to vacuum cleaners. But for visitors who walk through a small gate into the back yard, surrounded by 20-foot tall conifers, there's a little bit of a hidden treasure, says Mary Treishman, the executive director of the Winnetka Historical Society.</p>   <p>"We currently don't have a historical plaque on it," she says. "We just have this laminated sign that says, 'Please do not climb on this artifact. It's not safe.'"</p>   <p>That artifact is a 100-year-old jungle gym — the first real version.</p>   <div id="res1210973183">

   <p>To this day, kids sometimes still stumble across it, and Treishman has to politely tell them to stay off.</p>   <p>"I've seen adults come back here and really want to climb it because it reminds them of their childhood," she says, adding that something about the classic bars really animates people. "The memories of this climbing structure are very deep. This is what everyone played on."</p>   <p>Few things last 100 years. Children's toys seem particularly fickle. Pet rocks, pogo sticks and scooters have all had full boom and bust cycles while the jungle gym — unflashy, workman-like, no fuss — keeps children coming back. Why is that?</p>   <p>It may be that the act of swinging and climbing in the jungle gym contains<em> just enough </em>risk, says Ellen Sandseter — a professor at the Department of Physical Education and Health at Norway's Queen Maud University College, and an expert on risky play. </p>   
   <p>Sandseter says the jungle gym, and its sibling the monkey bars, offer a lot of challenging and also risky play, which is a good thing. She says it helps kids' physical development — think motor skills — and their mental health, by building courage and self-confidence while reducing anxiety.</p>   <p>What's more, unlike a lot of newer equipment that tells kids how it's supposed to be used, Sandseter says the beauty of the jungle gym is in its simplicity. </p>   <p>"A monkey bar could be used in many different ways. And it, therefore, also affords creativity among children," she says.</p>   <p>This all may help explain why the jungle gym has endured 100 years. But what about Fannin's original question: how did the monkey bars get their name? Well, in the original 1923 patent for the jungle gym, Hinton seems to imagine children playing on it in language that has an ethereal quality of dreaming, of imagination: </p>   <p><em>"I have designed a climbing apparatus, so proportioned and constructed that it provides a kind of forest top through which a troop of children may play in a manner somewhat similar to that of a troop of monkeys through the treetops in a jungle."</em></p>   <div id="res1211055996">

   <p>"There's an illustration of it in the last patent he had approved. It basically is a jungle gym, and then adhered next to it is the 'Accessory monkey runway,'" says Fannin. AKA, the monkey bars. </p>   <p>It's worth remembering, Hinton was a patent lawyer, not a primatologist. And that behavior — swinging by your arms — is <em>ape </em>behavior, not what monkeys do. So should they be called ape bars?</p>   <p>"If you want to be pedantic about it," says Fannin. "But I love the term monkey bars."</p>   <p>Sadly, Sebastian Hinton never saw his invention get the U.S. Patent Office's stamp of approval. He died in April of 1923, just six months before his patent was officially approved.</p>   
   <p>Much has changed since then: safety concerns have softened materials and rounded edges in playgrounds. But Hinton's simple design that doesn't dictate behavior, but facilitates it, has endured.</p>   <p>Perhaps it's precisely because of this freedom that jungle gyms have afforded children the chance to dream for the last century. And maybe some of them will even dream about new dimensions.</p>   <p><em>Christopher Intagliata contributed to this report.</em></p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>On Friday, the metaphorical ink was still drying on a federal court order barring the NYPD from illegally telling people they can't film the police in the public parts of precinct stations, when SeanPaul Reyes, who had sued the police department after being arrested for doing just that, marched into the 75th Precinct station house in East New York, recording with his phone in one hand, a copy of the judge's order in the other hand.</p><p>"We the people did it," Reyes told his livestream audience in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYMUGQO9Sck" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">video broadcast</a> viewed more than 300,000 times so far. "We won." Sporting sunglasses, a neatly trimmed beard, and a baseball cap that read "We the People," Reyes held forth in the precinct lobby, celebrating the victory. A police employee poked her head into the lobby to find out what Reyes wanted. "I want to make a complaint against the NYPD as a whole," he told her. After several minutes, a police sergeant emerged and handed Reyes a complaint form. Reyes asked him for his name and badge number, then thanked him and the precinct for being in compliance with the federal injunction. "I appreciate you guys not being in contempt of court," he said. The sergeant dutifully nodded.</p><p>Reyes filed his lawsuit in July, after being arrested twice for filming in the public areas of NYPD precinct houses. An NYPD policy, announced in signage in every precinct in the city, forbids filming in station houses. To Reyes, who describes himself as a "First Amendment auditor," that rule was meant to be broken. "The police are there for accountability—if you do something wrong, they hold you accountable," Reyes told Hell Gate. "But how do the people hold the police accountable? There has to be some sort of transparency and accountability for how the police treat people on an everyday basis. That's why I record. I just want to show people how public employees treat people."</p><p>Reyes's <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.602637/gov.uscourts.nysd.602637.1.0.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">lawsuit</a> argued that the NYPD's policy is improper for three reasons: It violates the First Amendment's protections of free speech; it violates a state law and a New York City law, both known as the <a href="https://www.pubadvocate.nyc.gov/press/nyc-council-passes-right-record-police-transparency-legislation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Right to Record Act</a>, which explicitly guarantee the right to record the police, anywhere and any time, so long as the person filming isn't interfering with police work or otherwise breaking the law; and the NYPD instituted its policy without following the Citywide Administrative Procedure Act, which specifies the steps a City agency must take before it can put a new rule in place.</p><p>Judge Jessica Clarke, who ordered the injunction last week, ruled that while the First Amendment claim might be a little more complicated, it seems pretty clear that the NYPD violated the state and municipal Right to Record Acts with its policy. "The Right to Record Acts do not carve out police precinct lobbies as places where individuals are not allowed to record," she wrote in her order. Consequently, according to Clarke, Reyes was "likely to succeed on his claims under the Right to Record Acts."</p><p>Based on that likelihood, Clarke issued a temporary injunction barring the NYPD from enforcing its rule and directing it to take down the signs in every police station that forbid filming.&nbsp;</p><p>That's not the end of Reyes's lawsuit—he is seeking a permanent injunction. With this provisional win under their belts, his legal team will now begin to pursue discovery, gathering information about how the NYPD made its rule in the first place and testing whether there's any evidence to support the NYPD's claim that its policy is necessary to protect the privacy of confidential informants and vulnerable victims of crimes who might be discussing delicate matters in the public spaces of precinct houses.</p><p>The YouTube genre of First Amendment auditors is fairly rich, and encompasses everything from kids filming themselves sassing back during traffic stops to steely-eyed libertarians being coolly intransigent at Border Patrol checkpoints deep in the desert. Reyes was a fan of the genre before he was a practitioner. "My brother-in-law, and as well as myself, we used to watch First Amendment audits and police interaction videos," he said. "Traffic stops, going into government agencies and seeing how they really treat members of the public on a daily basis, things of that nature. It always fascinated me how law enforcement and government officials got so upset about somebody recording them, you know? You would think that they would appreciate the transparency."</p><p>When COVID hit, Reyes, a Long Island resident, was furloughed from his job as a logistics director for a manufacturing company, and he found himself with some time on his hands. "I was like, might as well just pick up the camera," Reyes said. "Nobody really is doing it here at Suffolk County." Suffolk County police officers initially reacted very aggressively to Reyes's efforts to film them, he said, "But to their credit, they learned very quickly how to adapt and retrain their officers to allow filming in public areas," Reyes said. "So I branched out."</p><p>That branching out took Reyes all over the country, as tipsters pointed him to departments that were treating people poorly. Reyes says he distinguishes himself from some other First Amendment auditors by being unfailingly polite. He carries himself in his videos with a sort of jovial formality, conscientiously thanking officers for their time. That manner has built him a following—his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@LongIslandAudit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">YouTube channel </a>has more than 578,000 subscribers, and he says that across all his social media platforms, he has more than a quarter-billion views. Those views bring ad revenue, which Reyes now supports himself on, and he employs a team of colleagues as well. His manner has also earned him the respect of some police departments: He says he's been invited to give First Amendment trainings to departments in New Jersey and Ohio. Eventually, Reyes found his way to Brooklyn, where the NYPD's policy barring the public from recording how they are treated in police precincts seemed ripe for a challenge.</p><p>Reyes may be claiming victory against the NYPD, but—the meek welcome its officers offered Reyes on Friday notwithstanding—the department doesn't show any signs of giving up. It has filed notice that it is <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.602637/gov.uscourts.nysd.602637.30.0.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">appealing</a> the judge's order to the Second Circuit Court of Appeals. A ruling on that appeal could take years. In the meantime, the NYPD is also seeking a stay of the temporary injunction, allowing the department to continue to bar filming in the meantime.</p><p>Reyes's lawyer, Andrew Case of LatinoJustice PRLDF, said that the NYPD's dogged commitment to the dubiously legal policy is characteristic of how the department has approached the entire case. "The NYPD appears to be very resolute about defending the rule and seems to be unwilling to consider other alternatives, that wouldn't run afoul of the Right to Record law," Case said. The NYPD declined to comment on the order, referring questions to the New York City Law Department.&nbsp;</p><p>"The NYPD is committed to protecting the privacy of victims and keeping New Yorkers safe, particularly inside the public areas in precincts," a Law Department spokesperson told Hell Gate in a statement. "While we are disappointed with the court's ruling, we are encouraged by the court's indication that NYPD's policy has a legitimate basis. We are evaluating the City's legal options."</p><p>The NYPD is also continuing to fight another lawsuit brought over its ban on filming in police stations. Patricia Rodney, a grandmother who was <a href="https://hellgatenyc.com/grandmother-arrested-filming-police" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">arrested and had her arm broken</a> by police who thought she was filming them in the outer vestibule of the 62nd Precinct station in Dyker Heights, also has an open lawsuit in federal court. Public Advocate Jumaane Williams, who wrote the New York City Right to Record Act, has <a href="https://hellgatenyc.com/nyc-public-advocate-the-nypd-broke-the-law-arrested-grandmother" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">filed an amicus brief</a> in the case arguing that the NYPD's policy is illegal. The NYPD is seeking to dismiss that case, but the presiding judge has not yet ruled on that motion. The order in Reyes's case isn't binding precedent in Rodney's lawsuit, but it certainly doesn't bode well for the NYPD.&nbsp;</p><p>Back outside the 75th Precinct on Friday, Reyes was ebullient. "This is a major, major win for the people, ladies and gentlemen," he told the camera. "Make sure you guys are smashing that 'like' button and sharing this video so everyone in New York City can see this video and know what we the people can accomplish together. We can accomplish true change. This is just the battle that we won. We still have a war that we need to win."</p></div></div>]]></description>

    <p>Sekos förbundsstyrelse (Service- och kommunikationsfacket) beslutade idag att varsla om sympatiåtgärder till stöd för IF Metalls konflikt med den globala biltillverkaren, Tesla. Skälet till konflikten är att Tesla och deras ägare Elon Musk vägrar att teckna kollektivtal och följa spelreglerna på den svenska arbetsmarknaden.</p>

              


              


    <div>
        <p>– IF Metalls kamp är även vår kamp. Genom att vägra förhålla sig till spelreglerna här i Sverige så försöker Tesla skaffa sig konkurrensfördelar genom att ge arbetarna sämre löner och villkor än de skulle haft med ett kollektivavtal. Det är givetvis helt oacceptabelt. Den strid som nu IF Metall tar är viktig för hela den svenska kollektivavtalsmodellen. Därför har vår förbundsstyrelse valt att lägga ett sympativarsel, säger Sekos förbundsordförande, Gabriella Lavecchia.</p>
<p>Sekos sympatiåtgärder innebär blockad mot utdelning, utlämning och avhämtning av försändelser, brev, paket och pall som görs av PostNord och CityMail till Teslas samtliga arbetsplatser på samtliga orter i Sverige. Detta innebär att exempelvis reservdelar och komponenter till verkstäderna inte kommer levereras av dessa logistikbolag. Blockaden innebär att sympatiåtgärderna kvarstår även om annat företag övertar blockerat arbete.</p>
<p>–&nbsp;Vi backar IF Metall till 100 procent i denna viktiga konflikt. Vi är inne i en viktig period för svensk fackföreningsrörelse och för den svenska modellen. Vi och våra medlemmar kommer att göra allt vi kan för att vi tillsammans ska gå segrande ur denna kamp för rättvisa villkor för Teslas anställda, säger Sekos avtalssekreterare, Ulrika Nilsson.</p>
<p>Sekos stridsåtgärder träder ikraft den <strong>20 november 2023 klockan 01:00</strong></p>
<p>Varsel om utvidgning av konfliktåtgärder kommer att vidtas för det fall åsidosättande av stridsåtgärderna förekommer.</p>

<h2> INTRODUCTION</h2>
<p> Institutions theorists seek to explain institutional stability and change. However, most accounts have a status quo bias, as institutions are portrayed as stable. When change is observed, it is typically through alterations of the formal rules of the institution. These changes are frequently attributed to easily observable exogenous factors, such as external crises, influxes of new ideas, or alterations in actors’ power. However, endogenous processes may also create change and their neglect biases our accounts of institutions.</p>
<p> This paper advances a theory of endogenous institutional change whereby members of an institution react differently to the outcomes of disputes within institutions. Losers (or those who disagree with the outcomes of the disputes) may become demotivated and disempowered, whereas the winners (or those who agree with the outcomes of the disputes) may become galvanized and empowered. If the winners and losers belong to coherent camps with divergent interests and ideas about the institution, disproportionate exits by the losers can cause drastic institutional changes over time. The contribution of this paper is to show theoretically and empirically that consequential change <em>can occur solely endogenously</em> and that population loss can be the mechanism behind such change.<a href="#fn1"><span>Footnote </span>
<sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p> The paper provides a detailed demonstration of this occurring on the English Wikipedia. Beneath the hood of this popular website exists a large community of volunteers (Wikipedia editors) who collaboratively write all Wikipedia content. This population of volunteers comes together in deliberative and democratic fora where they adjudicate what kind of content belongs on the encyclopedia. This paper shows that the English Wikipedia transformed its content over time through a gradual reinterpretation of its ambiguous Neutral Point of View (NPOV) guideline, the core rule regarding content on Wikipedia. This had meaningful consequences, turning an organization that used to lend credence and false balance to pseudoscience, conspiracy theories, and extremism into a proactive debunker, fact-checker and identifier of fringe discourse. There are several steps to the transformation. First, Wikipedians disputed how to apply the NPOV rule in specific instances in various corners of the encyclopedia. Second, the earliest contentious disputes were resolved against Wikipedians who were more supportive of or lenient toward conspiracy theories, pseudoscience, and conservatism, and in favor of Wikipedians whose understandings of the NPOV guideline were decisively anti-fringe. Third, the resolutions of these disputes enhanced the institutional power of the latter Wikipedians, whereas it led to the demobilization and exit of the pro-fringe Wikipedians. A power imbalance early on deepened over time due to disproportionate exits of demotivated, unsuccessful pro-fringe Wikipedia editors. Fourth, this meant that the remaining Wikipedia editor population, freed from pushback, increasingly interpreted and implemented the NPOV guideline in an anti-fringe manner. This endogenous process led to a gradual but highly consequential reinterpretation of the NPOV guideline throughout the encyclopedia.</p>
<p> The paper demonstrates these processes through qualitative content analysis, archival research, and process tracing. First, to document a transformation in Wikipedia’s content, a qualitative content analysis was conducted on a sample of 63 representative articles. Content on the pages was analyzed across time with a predetermined coding scheme (see Boreus and Bergström <a href="#r6"><span>Reference Boreus and Bergström</span>2017</a>; Elkins, Spitzer, and Tallberg <a href="#r11"><span>Reference Elkins, Spitzer and Tallberg</span>2021</a>; Herrera and Braumoeller <a href="#r17"><span>Reference Herrera and Braumoeller</span>2004</a>). The analysis shows that the content changed over time from lending credence to fringe views to delegitimizing the fringe views. Second, to explain why these content changes occurred, the paper uses process tracing on Wikipedia’s archives, analyzing article talk page discussions about rule interpretations, related discussions on general noticeboards, arbitration rulings, and editor sanctions proceedings, as well as the histories of individual Wikipedia editors. Analyses of debates regarding individual articles lend strong support for the theory of endogenous institutional change. Article-by-article evidence is supplemented by an analysis of a sample of referenda where editors are asked to express their views about the NPOV rule’s application to fringe topics. The analysis shows that the disproportionate population loss is systematic across the encyclopedia, as editors who hold the pro-fringe view exit Wikipedia at a higher rate than anti-fringe editors.</p>
<p> These changes occurred despite structural biases in favor of stability. Even though the rules and content on Wikipedia are constantly subject to change, the organization’s decision-making procedures are biased to a conservative status quo. All changes on Wikipedia must be approved through consensus and editors who act contrary to consensus are punished. Furthermore, the transformation was neither an inevitability nor likely outcome of the original design of the institution. A comparison to other versions of Wikipedia demonstrates the contingent nature of the English Wikipedia’s trajectory. For example, even though the Croatian and English Wikipedia share the same core rules, content on the two versions of Wikipedia looks drastically different, as the Croatian Wikipedia lends credence to anti-LGBT rhetoric and pseudohistory (Sampson <a href="#r29"><span>Reference Sampson</span>2013</a>). These outcomes were not intended by Wikipedia’s founders, as shown by their own delineation of the rules in the early years, and in the case of Wikipedia’s co-founder, a complete disavowal of Wikipedia’s transformation.</p>
<p> This paper uses the understudied politics of Wikipedia as a lens through which to examine institutional theories of change. It has two major contributions. One is theoretical, demonstrating how population loss can be an endogenous mechanism of institutional change. Losses in institutional clashes can be demoralizing and inhibiting for the losers, leading them to abandon the institution and leaving the institution in the hands of their adversaries. The winners subsequently have freer rein to push for changes in the institution. This form of change may potentially have explanatory value regarding the trajectories of bureaucracies, political movements, political parties, and professions, as discontented losers within those institutions opt to leave their institution rather than fight an uphill battle against empowered and emboldened winners.</p>
<p> The other contribution is empirical, as the paper provides a comprehensive study of the politics of Wikipedia, a highly consequential organization in the online political information ecosystem. The paper documents a heretofore undocumented transformation in Wikipedia’s content over its life span. While scholars and commentators have remarked in recent years on Wikipedia’s status as a beacon of information in an online space plagued by misinformation, there is no comprehensive analysis of a transformation over Wikipedia’s life span.<a href="#fn2"><span>Footnote </span>

<h2> INSTITUTIONS AND ENDOGENOUS CHANGE</h2>
<p> Most scholarly works on institutions have a status quo bias, as the focus is on accounting for the persistence of institutional arrangements over time. To explain change, scholars tend to look for exogenous factors. For rational choice institutionalists, institutions reflect equilibrium solutions to problems of cooperation between different actors.<a href="#fn3"><span>Footnote </span>
<sup>3</sup></a> In most rationalist accounts of institutions, these equilibria do not become unstable unless the external circumstances change (e.g., through alterations in power), and the appearance of new problems that require new solutions. For sociological institutionalists, institutions reflect shared norms and understandings.<a href="#fn4"><span>Footnote </span>
<sup>4</sup></a> Actors that compose the membership of an institution exist in a social environment where institutional practices become taken for granted. Individual actors have limited agency to alter the existing institutional arrangements. These shared norms do not get altered unless by powerful external sources or through the appearance of norm entrepreneurs. For historical institutionalists, institutions reflect decision-making made at critical junctures, temporal sequencing, and path dependency. Past decision-making has a persistent impact on institutions, contributing to stability over time, even if the existing arrangements are suboptimal. The sources of change tend to be external crises or changes in the broader environment that alter the functions and purpose of institutions.<a href="#fn5"><span>Footnote </span>
<sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p> Recent comparative politics scholarship (particularly in the historical institutionalist tradition; see Bleich <a href="#r4"><span>Reference Bleich</span>2018</a>; Mahoney and Thelen <a href="#r25"><span>Reference Mahoney and Thelen</span>2009</a>; Streeck and Thelen <a href="#r34"><span>Reference Streeck and Thelen</span>2005</a>; Thelen <a href="#r35"><span>Reference Thelen</span>2004</a>) and international relations-oriented research on norm contestation (see Dietelhoff and Zimmermann <a href="#r10"><span>Reference Dietelhoff and Zimmermann</span>2020</a>; Sandholtz <a href="#r30"><span>Reference Sandholtz</span>2008</a>; Sandholtz and Stiles <a href="#r31"><span>Reference Sandholtz and Stiles</span>2009</a>; Wiener <a href="#r39"><span>Reference Wiener</span>2009</a>) have identified rule ambiguity and norm ambiguity, respectively, as promising plausible mechanisms for gradual endogenous change.<a href="#fn6"><span>Footnote </span>
<sup>6</sup></a> The seeds of change lie in the intrinsic inability of rules to apply clearly and unambiguously to most situations that confront members of complex institutions. This permits actors to reinterpret rules and norms through their application in specific instances. However, while this literature points to the plausibility of endogenous institutional change through ambiguity in rule application, many cases are prompted by exogenous causes, such as (i) the involvement of new actors, (ii) environmentally driven changes in the balance of power between actors, and (iii) the appearance of new problems that need solving. While these may be gradual processes of change, the underlying causes are frequently exogenous.<a href="#fn7"><span>Footnote </span>
<sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p> A prominent example of this kind of change in the comparative politics literature is Bleich’s (<a href="#r4"><span>Reference Bleich</span>2018</a>) study of the French High Court’s changing interpretation of hate crime laws over time. Bleich’s explanation for the shift in how the court applied the rules focuses on the entry and influence of new actors, as he delineates how activist organizations influenced how the French High Court interpreted hate crime laws. He also shows that the French High Court was influenced by the European Court of Human Rights. In the international relations literature, a prominent example of this kind of change is Sandholtz’s (<a href="#r30"><span>Reference Sandholtz</span>2008</a>) study on the rules regarding wartime plunder of artistic and cultural artifacts. In Sandholtz’s study, rules regarding wartime plunder were reinterpreted after major wars (the Napoleonic Wars and World War II), as the victims of large-scale plunder pressed to regain their property. In both cases, the rules in question (hate crime laws and rules of war) were broad and unspecified, allowing for different application of the rules in practice. In both Bleich (<a href="#r4"><span>Reference Bleich</span>2018</a>) and Sandholtz (<a href="#r30"><span>Reference Sandholtz</span>2008</a>), a lack of specificity in the wording of the rules permitted changes in application over time, but those changes were caused by exogenous factors (new actors or major wars).</p>
<p> My account of institutional change on Wikipedia contrasts with these other accounts in three ways. First, change was not caused by the entry of new actors, but rather the loss of actors. Whereas other approaches to the study of institutions tend to see the relevant population of an institution as being stable or increasing, my account shows that the loss of a particular population contributed to Wikipedia’s shift. Furthermore, other accounts see conflicts within institutions as resulting in winners and losers where the losers typically remain within the institution. As Conran and Thelen (<a href="#r8"><span>Reference Conran, Thelen, Fioretos, Falleti and Sheingate</span>2016</a>) note, losers remobilize and live to fight another day, which may lead them to change the institution in the future. However, the extent to which that is true depends on the nature of the institution, as well as the characteristics of the conflicts and the participants involved. Losses may entrench power advantages that entail feedback effects and are hard to rebalance, thus ensuring that losers cannot return the institution to the status quo. That was certainly the case on Wikipedia.</p>
<p> Second, power asymmetries are formed on Wikipedia. However, unlike many other studies of institutions, the power asymmetry was not due to broader environmental changes that altered the social or material sources of actors’ power. Rather, power asymmetries formed as actors gained power <em>within</em> the rubrics of the institution itself. In the case of Wikipedia, <em>experience</em> provided a potent source of power, which made victories in early disputes consequential. In other organizations, there may be other power dynamics that are made apparent and entrenched through wins and losses in institutional conflicts.</p>
<p> Third, reinterpretation of Wikipedia’s rules was not prompted by the appearance of new problems that required new solutions. Rather, the practical consequence of the rule reinterpretations on Wikipedia entailed fixing old problems (the presence of sources and content that legitimized fringe perspectives) that in large part stemmed from how the rules had been interpreted in the past.</p>
<p> In contrast to much of the existing literature, this paper argues that institutions which are otherwise portrayed as stable are in fact constantly subject to change from within. The change can occur entirely endogenously.<a href="#fn8"><span>Footnote </span>
<sup>8</sup></a> There are four steps to such change. First, consistent with some of the historical institutionalist and norm scholarship, the seeds of change are located in the intrinsic inability of rules and norms to apply clearly and unambiguously to most situations that confront members of the institution. Second, rule ambiguity creates openings for members to impose new meanings on the rules at the micro level, as the rules are applied to specific situations. Since institutions are composed of actors that have different interests and diverse views, rule interpretations can be a potent source of conflict. Third, the conflicts may be resolved, resulting in winners and losers. The resolutions of these conflicts in favor of actors with certain rule interpretations can alter the balance of power within the institution, as the losers of past conflicts get demobilized, sanctioned, or lose status, whereas the winners get mobilized, elevated, and gain institutional power. Fourth, if actors with similar and overlapping viewpoints and interests (coherent camps) win early and frequent victories across an institution, they may shape how the overarching rules of the institution are understood to work in practice.</p>
<p> For the process to play out in this manner, <em>camps with coherent interests and views</em> must exist (A and B in <a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>). Otherwise, settlements in individual disputes lead to indeterminate long-term results. Additionally, for trajectories to form over time, victories must result in <em>power advantages.</em> In the absence of a meaningful power advantage, losers should be able to regroup and live to fight another day over the interpretation of the rules, with indeterminate long-term results. The relative ease with which actors can exit institutions affects the speed of change. Migrating from a country may entail considerable costs, whereas leaving a voluntary association may be relatively cost-free, which means that rapid change may be more likely in the latter case once a power asymmetry forms. Finally, for the process to play out in this specific manner, it presumes that <em>exogenous factors do not intervene with the process.</em> Both exogenous and endogenous factors can work in tandem, but the contribution of this paper is to show theoretically and empirically that consequential change <em>can occur solely endogenously.</em>

<p> The remainder of this paper provides a detailed demonstration of how this process of endogenous change plays on the English Wikipedia. The paper explains what Wikipedia is, justifies why Wikipedia is a worthy case of inquiry, documents how Wikipedia’s content has transformed over its life span, and explains how this transformation happened.

<h2> WIKIPEDIA AS AN IMPORTANT PART OF THE POLITICAL INFORMATION ECOSYSTEM</h2>
<div data-magellan-destination="sec4" id="sec4">
<h3> The Structure of Wikipedia</h3>
<p> Wikipedia is a nonprofit, multilingual, open-access online encyclopedia started by Jimmy Wales and Larry Sanger in 2001. The encyclopedia is user-generated. Anyone is free to edit it. By May 2021, there were more than 40&nbsp;million registered users, of whom nearly 140,000 were active editors. Wikipedians generally edit pseudonymously, but extant data indicate that Wikipedians are disproportionately white males from the Global North. One in four Wikipedians primarily edit the English language version of Wikipedia (see Hill and Shaw <a href="#r18"><span>Reference Hill and Shaw</span>2013</a>; Wikipedia <a href="#r44">2021b</a>; Yasseri, Sumi, and Kertesz <a href="#r45"><span>Reference Yasseri, Sumi and Kertesz</span>2012b</a>).</p>
<p> Editors must comply with three core Wikipedia content guidelines:</p><ol>
<li>
<p><span>1.</span>
<strong>Neutral point of view (WP:NPOV):</strong> “representing fairly, proportionately, and, as far as possible, without editorial bias, all the significant views that have been published by reliable sources on a topic” (Wikipedia <a href="#r40">2020a</a>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>2.</span>
<strong>No original research (WP:NOR):</strong> “you must be able to cite reliable, published sources that are directly related to the topic of the article, and directly support the material being presented” (Wikipedia <a href="#r41">2020b</a>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>3.</span>
<strong>Verifiability (WP:V):</strong> “verifiability means other people using the encyclopedia can check that the information comes from a reliable source… All material in Wikipedia mainspace, including everything in articles, lists and captions, must be verifiable” (Wikipedia <a href="#r42">2020c</a>).</p>
</li>
</ol><p>WP:NPOV is the guideline at the heart of most disputes on the encyclopedia. The NPOV guideline affects whether something should be covered, the weight of the coverage, and whether the cited sources are reliable. On subjects where there are diverse and incompatible views, “edit wars” frequently arise. These are situations when a change is made to an article (e.g., removal of text, addition of text, and rewording of text), and the change gets reverted, leading to an unstable cycle of additions and reverts of the same content (see Jemielniak <a href="#r20"><span>Reference Jemielniak</span>2014</a>; Tkacz <a href="#r36"><span>Reference Tkacz</span>2015</a>; Yasseri et al. <a href="#r46"><span>Reference Yasseri, Sumi, Rung, Kornai and Kertesz</span>2012</a>).</p>
<p> How does the encyclopedia deal with disputes like these? One might think that such disputes would lead to an inconsistent product where articles look drastically different from day to day, but Wikipedia produces a very stable and consistent product. This is because there are multilayered dispute settlement mechanisms and elaborate norms regarding editor behavior. Wikipedia’s community reaches decisions about rules and content through a combination of deliberative discussions and referenda. These democratic processes have the goal of determining whether content has “consensus.” If a proposed change does not have consensus, the article experiencing edit wars will be returned to the status quo.</p>
<p> A typical edit war will be resolved in the following manner: an editor makes changes to a page. Other editors disapprove of the change and revert the change. The status quo ante is established until a consensus for inclusion can be found on the talk page of the article. Editors may be able to work out mutually acceptable compromises. If they are not able to work out acceptable compromises among the small subset that are engaged with a single article, they can subject the dispute to input from the broader Wikipedia community. For example, if the editors who edit the Margaret Thatcher page are having a dispute that they cannot resolve among themselves, they may take the dispute to noticeboards that are frequented by large numbers of Wikipedians who do not frequent the Thatcher page.</p>
<p> However, these procedures are not always sufficient to establish stability on a page. This is particularly the case on large high-profile articles with stable and coherent camps of editors, frequent editing, and multiple controversial aspects. When articles experience extraordinary levels of edit-warring, editors may request dispute settlement before administrators on the “Administrators Noticeboard” or arbitrators on the “Arbitration Committee.” These bodies primarily adjudicate behavioral problems among Wikipedians rather than adjudicate content directly (that is something for Wikipedia’s deliberative democratic processes to resolve). The bodies tend to sanction the most active and raucous editors on the dysfunctional pages.</p>
<p> Administrators and arbitrators are elected by the Wikipedia userbase. To become an administrator, an editor goes through the “Request for Adminship” process, which is essentially an election on the suitability of an editor to become an administrator. Any experienced editor can make a request for a position as administrator.<a href="#fn10"><span>Footnote </span>
<sup>10</sup></a> The request is unlikely to be granted unless they have a well-established history as a contributor on the encyclopedia and have demonstrated an ability to get along with other editors. The threshold to become an administrator is high, as editors generally require support by 75% of voters. Editors who are new and who behave in divisive ways are unlikely to get the support needed to become administrators.<a href="#fn11"><span>Footnote </span>
<sup>11</sup></a> The English Wikipedia has approximately one thousand administrators.</p>
<p> The Arbitration Committee is vastly smaller, with membership oscillating between 13 and 18 members. Elections to the Arbitration Committee are more formal and eventful processes than the requests for adminship, as the elections occur annually, eligible registered editors are notified about the elections on their user talk page, and cast secret ballots.<a href="#fn12"><span>Footnote </span>
<sup>12</sup></a> Experienced editors who are not divisive are better poised to garner the votes to become arbitrators.</p>

<div data-magellan-destination="sec5" id="sec5">
<h3> Case Selection Justification</h3>
<p> There are several motivating factors in choosing the English Wikipedia as a case to study institutional change: (i) it is an important case; (ii) it is an understudied case; (iii) it could be construed as a least-likely case for institutional change; and (iv) it has unique availability of data, which makes it possible to observe slow, gradual, endogenous processes that result in consequential drastic change over time.</p>
<p> First, Wikipedia is an important institution. One that is worthwhile to study in its own right. <em>Wikipedia.org</em> is one of the most popular websites in the world. The English Wikipedia is frequently at the top or near the top of Google searches for a known person or event in the English language (e.g., Vincent and Hecht <a href="#r37"><span>Reference Vincent and Hecht</span>2021</a>). Wikipedia is also widely perceived as a trustworthy and reliable source of information (e.g., Bruckman <a href="#r7"><span>Reference Bruckman</span>2022</a>), giving it considerable power in public discourse and ideational diffusion. Wikipedia’s influence is also boosted by the fact that Wikipedia pages, unlike other forms of content (such as news reports and scholarship), are often written in summary style and in layman’s terms, thus making the information in Wikipedia articles more accessible to readers. Furthermore, tech giants, such as YouTube, Facebook, Google, and Twitter, have incorporated Wikipedia into their own platforms.</p>
<p> Due to its popularity and perceived trustworthiness, Wikipedia has the power to legitimize and delegitimize subjects. This is a website that can declare whether something is a pseudoscience, a falsehood, a conspiracy theory, or bigotry. World leaders can be described as dictators, perpetrators of violence can be identified, and the effects of implementing certain public policies can be characterized as positive or negative. Additionally, in many cases, it seems clear that actors who are covered by Wikipedia believe that Wikipedia matters, as politicians have on many occasions been exposed as having edited their own Wikipedia pages, and authoritarian regimes have blocked Wikipedia in parts or in its entirety.</p>
<p> Wikipedia’s salience has increased over time, as scholars express concern over the intersection of the Internet and politics. The Internet has displaced traditional gatekeepers, and contributed to the wide diffusion of conspiracy theories, pseudoscience, and extremist rhetoric. Whereas the other major online platforms have been criticized for their role in monetizing, inculcating, and diffusing extremism and misinformation, Wikipedia has often been hailed as an exception: a distinctly positive actor in the online political ecosystem,<a href="#fn13"><span>Footnote </span>
<sup>13</sup></a> an actor that serves a proactive gatekeeping role where it outright debunks, fact-checks, and highlights the errors and fringe nature of the very same discourses popularized on the other platforms.</p>
<p> Second, Wikipedia is an understudied institution in an understudied organizational environment. Aside from its importance in politics, there are several things about Wikipedia as an organization that political scientists and organizational scholars should find intriguing. It is an enormous organization that is based on the open-source or commons-based peer production organizational model (e.g., Benkler <a href="#r2"><span>Reference Benkler</span>2002</a>; Reagle <a href="#r27"><span>Reference Reagle</span>2010</a>; Tkacz <a href="#r36"><span>Reference Tkacz</span>2015</a>). Unlike traditional organizations, such as firms and bureaucracies, Wikipedia is characterized by a lack of “formal hierarchy.” Editors on Wikipedia are not managed and instructed by “managers,” but rather self-assign tasks to do. Editors are not motivated by monetary rewards, unlike members of traditional organizations.</p>
<p> Decision-making on Wikipedia is deliberative and democratic. The rules of Wikipedia are always subject to change, which effectively makes all rules, norms, and content on Wikipedia subject to constant plebiscites. Consequently, Wikipedia both reflects and accentuates processes that are analogous to those in other organizations. Scholars have consequentially used Wikipedia to study collaboration, conflict, polarization, and partisanship, as well as politics and organizational dynamics more broadly (Greenstein, Gu, and Zhu <a href="#r14"><span>Reference Greenstein, Gu and Zhu</span>2021</a>; Heaberlin and DeDeo <a href="#r16"><span>Reference Heaberlin and DeDeo</span>2016</a>; Jemielniak <a href="#r20"><span>Reference Jemielniak</span>2014</a>; Konieczsny 2009; Lerner and Lomi <a href="#r24"><span>Reference Lerner and Lomi</span>2019</a>; Reagle <a href="#r27"><span>Reference Reagle</span>2010</a>; Shi et al. <a href="#r33"><span>Reference Shi, Teplitskiy, Duede and Evans</span>2019</a>; Tkacz <a href="#r36"><span>Reference Tkacz</span>2015</a>; Yasseri et al. <a href="#r46"><span>Reference Yasseri, Sumi, Rung, Kornai and Kertesz</span>2012</a>; Yasseri, Sumi, and Kertesz <a href="#r45"><span>Reference Yasseri, Sumi and Kertesz</span>2012</a>). While Wikipedia has been the subject of study by computer scientists, physicists, information scientists, and sociologists, it has been neglected by political scientists.</p>
<p> Third, Wikipedia could be construed as a least-likely case for institutional change and most-likely case for organizational stability, as the organization has several structural biases in favor of stability and the status quo. The requirement that there needs to be a “consensus” among editors in favor of both addition of content and rule changes should make it hard to enact substantial changes.<a href="#fn14"><span>Footnote </span>
<sup>14</sup></a> In the event of disputes, the guiding rule is to retain the status quo unless a consensus can be established for any change. A minority of editors can therefore block controversial changes. Furthermore, the presence of a large and diverse userbase means that ideational changes among individuals and small groups should not result in frequent or sudden changes over time. Wikipedia also strongly enforces compliance with the rules, which means that large-scale rule violations will not be a likely source of change over time (see Piskorski and Gorbatai <a href="#r26"><span>Reference Piskorski and Gorbatai</span>2017</a>). The strong enforcement leads editors to edit within accepted boundaries and within consensuses. Given these institutional characteristics, one might expect Wikipedia to have a conservative status quo bias.<a href="#fn15"><span>Footnote </span>
<sup>15</sup></a></p>
<p> Furthermore, the founders of Wikipedia have not intervened to cause new interpretations of the guidelines among the userbase. Sanger, who crafted the core NPOV rule, has condemned the interpretations of the guideline that emerged over time.<a href="#fn16"><span>Footnote </span>
<sup>16</sup></a> Wales has held a more agnostic view of change on Wikipedia over time, saying in 2006, “One of the great things about NPOV is that it is a term of art and a community fills it with meaning over time” (Reason <a href="#r28">2006</a>).</p>
<p> Fourth, Wikipedia has a unique availability of data. A major problem in most case-specific accounts of institutional change is the inaccessibility of comprehensive data to evaluate causes and effects. Scholars must rely on a sliver of data that are available to piece together what the preferences of various actors might be, what actions these actors took, and how the preferences and actions of these actors led to institutional change or stability. What adds to the problem is that the publicly available data may fail to reflect the actual processes that led to change. For example, debates may take place in front of cameras and voting may be logged into records, but the meaningful negotiations occur behind closed doors.</p>
<p> In comparison with other institutions, Wikipedia has several advantages in terms of studying institutional change. In other largescale institutions, it is not feasible to identify and collect data on every participant, and to track the behavior of every participant over time. Scholars are often forced to fill gaps with theory or by making assumptions. There is a risk that unobserved variables have a significant impact on outcomes, which makes it hard to make robust claims about the causes of institutional change. On Wikipedia, on the other hand, virtually all edits and comments are logged and open to public viewing. This means that it is possible to trace each input in every debate, as well as to sift through the editing history of each Wikipedia editor. Thus, there is an enormity of relevant data on which to test, refine, and build theories of institutional change.</p>

<h2> RESEARCH DESIGN</h2>
<p> The research design of the paper has two components. First, the paper codes content in the lead of Wikipedia articles, showing a pro-to-anti-fringe shift in content. Second, the paper does process-tracing of trends within Wikipedia’s governance to show how this shift happened (George and Bennett <a href="#r12"><span>Reference George and Bennett</span>2005</a>). In terms of analyzing changes in the content of Wikipedia articles, the paper uses nonautomated qualitative content analysis to classify whether Wikipedia pages use language that legitimizes or delegitimizes fringe positions and entities. An advantage of qualitative content analysis is that it permits analysts to observe subtle, yet meaningful nuances in meaning.<a href="#fn17"><span>Footnote </span>
<sup>17</sup></a> It entails human coding and interpretation of textual sources according to structured and systematic coding schemes (see Boreus and Bergström <a href="#r6"><span>Reference Boreus and Bergström</span>2017</a>; Elkins, Spitzer, and Tallberg <a href="#r11"><span>Reference Elkins, Spitzer and Tallberg</span>2021</a>; Herrera and Braumoeller <a href="#r17"><span>Reference Herrera and Braumoeller</span>2004</a>). More specifically, the paper systematically classified a sample of 63 article leads with a predetermined coding scheme.<a href="#fn18"><span>Footnote </span>
<sup>18</sup></a> The 63 pages were chosen because they are representative of the population of relevant cases: all the pages are on topics that have been linked to pseudoscience, conspiracy theories, extremism, and fringe rhetoric in public discourse.</p>
<p> Within the relevant population, the chosen pages reflect diverse topic areas (health, climate, gender, sexuality, race, abortion, religion, politics, international relations, and history). The pages also vary in terms of the time of creation (some pages were created early and others later), and temporal prominence (the topics covered in the pages were more prominent during different time periods). The pages include biographies (which have more restrictive standards for inclusion of pejorative content) and nonbiographies.</p>
<p> The contents of the chosen Wikipedia pages were classified according to a five-category coding scheme. These categories reflect varying degrees of neutrality. On one end of the spectrum, the language lends credence and legitimacy to fringe views. On the other end, the language firmly delegitimizes the fringe views:</p><ol>
<li>
<p><span>1.</span>
<strong>Fringe normalization:</strong> The fringe position/entity is normalized and legitimized. There is an absence of criticism.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>2.</span>
<strong>Teach the controversy:</strong> The fringe position/entity is presented as a matter of active scientific or political dispute (A says X, B says Y).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>3.</span>
<strong>False balance:</strong> The lead places emphasis on the expertise, credibility, evidence, and arguments of the anti-fringe side (e.g., “some scientists say,” “some medical organizations say”), but the pro-fringe side still gets space to rebut.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>4.</span>
<strong>Identification of the fringe view:</strong> The lead places emphasis on the legitimacy and the overwhelming numbers that compose the anti-fringe side (e.g., “scientific consensus,” “the scientific community”), but space is still given to the pro-fringe side.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>5.</span>
<strong>Proactive fringe-busting:</strong> Space is only given to the anti-fringe side whose position is stated as fact in Wikipedia’s own voice.<a href="#fn19"><span>Footnote </span>
<sup>19</sup></a> The evidence that supports the anti-fringe position is presented, whereas the flaws of the pro-fringe perspective are outlined.</p>
</li>
</ol><p>The paper uses a cross-temporal analysis of each article’s lead, thus tracking changes over time. A stable version of each article was analyzed at the end of each year. Articles were checked more frequently if the pages had frequent and erratic editing patterns. Changes on Wikipedia articles can be accessed through archives that show each change, thus making the study replicable. <a href="#tab1">Table 1</a> and the Supplementary Material include examples of language from each article’s lead. Due to space constraints, changes in nine representative article leads are shown in <a href="#tab1">Table 1</a>, whereas 54 additional articles are in the Supplementary Material.</p><div data-magellan-destination="tab1" id="tab1">

<p> Per the analysis (see <a href="#tab1">Table 1</a> and the Supplementary Material), content on the English Wikipedia shows a clear trend from language that legitimizes fringe positions to language that delegitimizes fringe positions. Newer articles tend to adopt language from the anti-fringe categories at their creation, whereas older articles tend to adopt language that is more fringe-normalizing at their creation. None of the articles move in a direction where they become more fringe-normalizing.</p>
<p> The analysis shows that in its early years, the English Wikipedia adhered to a “strict” NPOV approach whereby Wikipedia content was open to a diversity of opinions and sources, and where Wikipedians could not state contested views as facts in Wikipedia’s own voice. Thus, a typical page on a subject related to pseudoscience and contested science would adopt a “Some say X, others say Y” style, even on topics where mainstream scientific opinion overwhelmingly favored X.</p>

<h2> ENDOGENOUS CHANGE ON WIKIPEDIA</h2>
<div data-magellan-destination="sec8" id="sec8">
<h3> Explaining the Findings</h3>
<p> The paper has demonstrated that English Wikipedia content changed over time. This section seeks to explain <em>why</em> the content changed. In doing so, the paper uses process tracing. The paper systematically analyzes the internal Wikipedia discussion forums where editors duked out content. More specially, the paper analyzes the archived talk pages of the 63 articles and relevant discussions about article content on general noticeboards.<a href="#fn20"><span>Footnote </span>
<sup>20</sup></a> To classify editors into the Anti-Fringe camp (AF) and the Pro-Fringe camp (PF), the paper uses a variety of data sources: the viewpoints expressed by editors on the article talk pages themselves, the views expressed by editors brought up for sanctioning on the Administrators’ noticeboard or the “Requests for Enforcement” page before the Arbitration Committee, and lists of editors brought up in arbitration committee rulings.</p>
<p> These data sources provide article-by-article evidence about relevant individual editors on the pages in question. However, to assess systematically what happens to AF and PF editors across the English Wikipedia (not just the 63 articles), the paper uses a sample of referenda where editors are implicitly asked whether they support a pro- or anti-fringe interpretation of the NPOV guideline. The user histories of the participants in the referenda are then analyzed to uncover whether they are still active or whether they have voluntarily left Wikipedia, substantially reduced their number of contributions, been banned from the relevant topics, or blocked from Wikipedia in its entirety.</p>
<p> The evidence is broadly consistent with the observable implications of the paper’s theory of endogenous institutional change (the processes of the theory are outlined in <a href="#fig2">Figure 2</a>).<a href="#fn21"><span>Footnote </span>

<div><p><span>Figure 2.</span> How Did the NPOV Rule Change?</p>
</div></div>
<p> The key piece of evidence is that PF members disappear over time in the wake of losses, both voluntarily and involuntarily. PF members are those who vote affirmatively for policies that normalize or lend credence to fringe viewpoints, who edit such content into articles, and who vote to defend fellow members of PF when there are debates as to whether they engaged in wrongdoing. Members of AF do the opposite.</p>
<p> The causal mechanism for the gradual disappearance is that early losses demotivated members from PF or led to their sanctioning, whereas members of AF were empowered by early victories. As exits of PF members mount across the encyclopedia, the community increasingly adopts AF’s viewpoints as the way that the NPOV guideline should be understood.</p>
<div data-magellan-destination="sec9" id="sec9">
<h4> Step 1: Rule Ambiguity</h4>
<p> The NPOV rule of Wikipedia is ambiguous in its specific application. During the early period of Wikipedia, Wikipedia’s NPOV rule was understood as indicating a “describe-the-controversy” approach to disputes between sources: Wikipedia should not take sides on contested issues, and Wikipedia should be open to a diverse array of sources. Thus, the policy allowed for inclusion of lower-quality sources, so long as they were attributed. This meant that if sources disagreed in terms of how they covered the topic of homeopathy, the Wikipedia article on homeopathy would present both sides of the issue and avoid taking a firm stance. The Wikipedia page on homeopathy included text that effectively said “Advocates for homeopathy say…” and “Critics of homeopathy say…,” whereas it was frowned upon among early Wikipedians to state decisively in Wikipedia’s own voice that “Homeopathy is a pseudoscientific system of alternative medicine” (as the first line of the Wikipedia page stated in 2020). This was largely in line with Larry Sanger’s intentions when he crafted the NPOV rule (ArsTechnica <a href="#r1">2014</a>).</p>
</div>
<div data-magellan-destination="sec10" id="sec10">
<h4> Step 2: Clashes between Camps over Rule Interpretations</h4>
<p> On contentious topics (e.g., American politics, conspiracy theories, and pseudoscience), editors had vast differences in terms of how they understood the application of Wikipedia’s rules. Editors who were anti-conspiracy theories, anti-pseudoscience, and liberal (the AF camp) pushed understandings of NPOV that took a firm anti-conspiracy-theory and anti-pseudoscience stance. Thus, they argued for reliance on strong sources (such as studies and highly reputable mainstream news outlets), nonuse of lower-quality sources (such as partisan outlets and disreputable outlets), stating claims from strong sources in Wikipedia’s own voice (rather than attributing them as a source’s opinion), firmly stating that minority views are fringe, and stating that falsehoods are falsehoods.</p>
<p> Editors who were more supportive of conspiracy theories, pseudoscience, and conservatism (the PF camp) argued for reliance on sources across a broad range of reliability (in part, because they perceived academics and newspapers of record to be biased), stating claims from sources as if they were always an attributed POV, and avoiding firm stances on the state of a controversy.</p>
<p> On the homeopathy page, this meant that PF members raised questions about relying on reporting by the <em>New York Times</em> and <em>Washington Post</em>, insisted that studies skeptical of homeopathy’s efficacy be phrased as opinion, and sought to include rebuttals by pro-homeopathy organizations and pseudoscientists. AF members held the opposite view, as they sought to phrase skeptical content in Wikipedia’s own voice and strongly opposed content sourced to pro-homeopathy organizations.</p>
</div>
<div data-magellan-destination="sec11" id="sec11">
<h4> Step 3: Formation of a Power Asymmetry</h4>
<p> Over the course of years, AF successfully shaped how to understand the practical application of Wikipedia’s NPOV guideline. These early victories gave AF an upper hand in editing disputes on pages related to conspiracy theories, pseudoscience, and American politics. There was no single critical juncture. Rather, there were many gradual mutually reinforcing steps across several spheres of Wikipedia.</p>
<p> One type of change that was important early in Wikipedia’s development was intervention into content disputes by arbitrators on highly dysfunctional pages. Highly dysfunctional pages are those characterized by edit-warring among a multitude of editors to the point that the pages are unstable over extended periods of time, and editors cannot even agree on the status quo version of the pages.</p>
<p> Two particularly important early arbitration rulings in the early years were the arbitration committee cases on climate change (2005) and pseudoscience (2006), which largely reaffirmed some viewpoints held by AF in those specific disputes and led to sanctions that primarily targeted prolific PF editors (although some AF editors were also targeted) for behavioral wrongdoing. The disputes were at their core about edit-warring between different camps as to whether climate change articles should reflect the scientific consensus on climate change or lend weight to those who dispute the scientific consensus, and broadly about how pseudoscientific ideas and minority scientific perspectives should be framed.</p>
<p> A second type of important changes involve the writing of guidelines to supplement the existing NPOV guideline and clarify how the NPOV guideline should be applied. This includes the creation of the Reliable Sources guideline (2005), which introduced a basic framework for evaluating the reliability of sources, the Fringe Theory guideline (2007), which introduced a basic framework for evaluating minority views and fringe views, and the Reliable Sources (Medicine) guideline (2008), which set a higher quality threshold for sources on medicine-related topics out of a concern that poorly sourced content could cause harm to readers.</p>
<p> These guidelines were crafted by a relatively small set of experienced editors, including many from AF who were involved in active content disputes on topics that related to these rules. All editors can participate in processes to change rules and add supplements to rules. These changes must go through the normal Wikipedia consensus decision-making process. While these particular rules were not written to specifically address content in those disputes, the enactment of these rules as supplemental modifications to the NPOV guideline would prove useful in those disputes. Furthermore, discussions related to those rules showed that editors wanted to privilege science and academic expertise in terms of identifying what is fringe, but the Reliable Sources and Fringe Theory guidelines were broad enough in scope that they could also be used to identify fringe discourse and beliefs outside of science, such as with conspiracy theories and extremist rhetoric in politics.</p>
</div>
<div data-magellan-destination="sec12" id="sec12">
<h4> Step 4: Reinterpretation of Wikipedia’s Rules</h4>
<p> The early victories and selective departures had positive feedback effects for three reasons: (i) they enhanced the value of experience, (ii) they created a numerical advantage, and (iii) they spurred a sourcing bias. Consequently, AF editors experienced greater success in editing, whereas PF editors did not, which led to lopsided exits over time. Together, these factors led AF to increasingly get what it wanted and sway the broader Wikipedia userbase to see one interpretation of the rules as the undisputed accurate interpretation of the rules.</p>
<p> First, experience matters a great deal on Wikipedia, which makes disproportionate exits early on highly consequential. Since Wikipedia is notoriously complicated for new editors to maneuver, experienced editors have a decisive advantage in content disputes (Jemielniak <a href="#r20"><span>Reference Jemielniak</span>2014</a>). Experience helps in understanding the rules, norms, and processes of Wikipedia. This leads to greater success in content disputes and edit wars, as well as makes experienced editors able to drive disruptive “newcomers” away from Wikipedia and instill in newcomers’ certain understandings of how rules should be interpreted. Experience also raises the likelihood of becoming an administrator, thereby gaining the power to enforce the rules and sanction editors.<a href="#fn22"><span>Footnote </span>
<sup>22</sup></a> Additionally, experience increases the likelihood of participation in general noticeboard discussions where sanctions of individual editors and specific rule interpretations are discussed in detail. Experienced editors also become aware of administrator elections and arbitration committee elections, which are important levers of power on Wikipedia.</p>
<p> Second, there is power in numbers. It is easier for PF members to fall afoul of the rules if they are frequently at a numerical disadvantage in editing disputes. It makes them less likely to win content disputes (which are often determined by numbers), forces them to spend more time to advance their views, and makes them more likely to have to edit war (make frequent reverts of AF editors). Whereas multiple AF editors can share the burden of doing reverts of PF’s edits and not violate any edit-warring restrictions, a PF editor may be forced to do multiple reverts, thus risking sanction.</p>
<p> Third, the gradual development of a sourcing hierarchy—whereby some sources were deemed reliable, and others were deemed unreliable—created advantages for AF editors. The culmination of a long, gradual conflict over the use of sources on Wikipedia was the 2017 vote to deprecate (ban) the <em>Daily Mail</em>, a British tabloid, from being used as a source for statements of fact. Over the next 4&nbsp;years, 38 additional sources were deprecated.</p>
<p> The gradual development of the sourcing hierarchy reflects how the Wikipedia community shifted its understanding of reliability over time, facilitated by the experience and numerical advantage of AF. An examination of pages in the early years of Wikipedia shows that Wikipedians had very lax standards for sourcing. By the mid-2000s, momentum had formed to privilege scientific publications. This did not mean that other sources were unusable, but that priority and prominence should be afforded to scientific publications. During these early years, Wikipedians did not appear to distinguish between news sources in terms of reliability in any clear manner. Articles into the 2010s show considerable usage of sources that would ultimately by the mid-2010s be deemed unreliable, including sources that were deprecated from 2017 onward.<a href="#fn24"><span>Footnote </span>
<sup>24</sup></a> Discussions about these sources in the previous years had not concluded with support to prohibit them, demonstrating a change in how the community looked at them. The key difference is that the ranks of PF editors who blocked previous attempts to ban sources had been thinned out considerably by 2017.</p>
<p> This hierarchy of sources has implications both for what kind of content can be added to Wikipedia and how it will be phrased. For example, if the <em>New York Times</em> (a source that Wikipedia editors came to recognize as highly reliable) describes something as a conspiracy theory, whereas the <em>New York Post</em> (a source that Wikipedia editors have determined to be unreliable) differs from that description, then Wikipedia content can be added that firmly states in Wikipedia’s voice that something is a conspiracy theory. Under a previous collective understanding of Wikipedia’s rules, Wikipedia’s content would not give a firm statement in Wikipedia’s voice but would rather attribute particular claims to the <em>Times</em> and attribute rebuttal claims to the <em>Post.</em> Thus, over time, Wikipedia has accepted the use of contested labels and taken sides on contested subjects, ultimately producing a type of content that is distinctly anti-pseudoscience and anti-conspiracy theories, and which has the perception of a liberal bent in U.S. politics.</p>
<p> Each shift in policy further weakened the position of PF in editing disputes and made the editing experience less rewarding for those editors because they ended up on the losing end of content disputes. Over time, PF editors responded in three ways<a href="#fn25"><span>Footnote </span>
<sup>25</sup></a>:</p><ol>
<li>
<p><span>1.</span>
<strong>Fight back:</strong> By increasingly editing against consensus and in violation of new interpretations of Wikipedia policy. These editors were subsequently banned.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>2.</span>
<strong>Withdraw:</strong> By leaving Wikipedia or reducing their contributions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>3.</span>
<strong>Acquiesce:</strong> By gradually adapting to the new interpretations of Wikipedia policy.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p> Article-by-article evidence substantiates these patterns, with prominent PF editors getting banned, retiring, or adjusting to new interpretations of Wikipedia guidelines.<a href="#fn26"><span>Footnote </span>
<sup>26</sup></a> In explaining their departure on their talk page, retired PF editors frequently decried what they perceived as Wikipedia’s increased bias, hostile editing environment, and the pointlessness of fighting against what they described as a cabal.<a href="#fn27"><span>Footnote </span>
<sup>27</sup></a> This stands in contrast to the explanations offered by non-PF members for retiring. Some PF editors proved more flexible to Wikipedia’s changing environment, acquiescing to new interpretations of Wikipedia policy. For example, a PF editor might affirm the new standards in Wikipedia’s sourcing policy by insisting that content from a source like the <em>New York Times</em> should be stated in Wikipedia’s own voice when a <em>Times</em> story criticizes a left-leaning politician or left-leaning cause. However, in doing so, those PF editors help enshrine the emerging new interpretations of Wikipedia guidelines.</p>
<p> In addition to article-by-article evidence of departures of Wikipedia editors, the paper uses a sample of hotly contested referenda (where editors are asked to express their views about the NPOV rule’s application to fringe topics) to gage whether the disappearance of PF editors (measured by their support or opposition for a fringe position) is systemic across the encyclopedia. This is a unique and useful data source that shows that the relative disappearance of PF editors is systemic.</p>
<p> The raw numbers undersell the importance of those who have departed the encyclopedia. Many of the departees were highly prolific experienced editors from PF, whereas many of the editors who sided with AF and disappeared over time were not highly prolific editors in the first place. These disproportionate exits meant that over time, understandings in line with AF’s interpretation of Wikipedia policy become taken for granted as the way the rules should be interpreted, causing gradual institutional changes that amount to a drastic institutional change over a nearly 20-year period.</p>

<h2> ALTERNATIVE EXPLANATIONS</h2>
<p> This paper has sought to explain why content on the English Wikipedia transformed drastically over time. The explanation hinges on endogenous factors related to early victories, feedback effects, and population loss. In this section, the paper examines two key alternative explanations, finding that they are inapplicable and generally inconsistent with the data (three additional alternative explanations are addressed in the Supplementary Material).<a href="#fn28"><span>Footnote </span>
<sup>28</sup></a></p>
<div data-magellan-destination="sec14" id="sec14">
<h3> External Events and Processes</h3>
<p> One alternative hypothesis is that external events caused ideational change among Wikipedians. For example, Donald Trump’s 2016 election, the 2016 Brexit referendum, and the emergence of “fake news” websites may have caused Wikipedians to re-evaluate how they understand the rules of Wikipedia and the role of Wikipedia in society. However, as the paper documented, the transformation on Wikipedia has been gradual over time, preceding prominent shocks from 2016. Furthermore, the emergence of “fake news” websites does not fit neatly with Wikipedians’ decision to deprecate long-standing traditional news sources, such as the <em>Daily Mail.</em> The events of 2015 and 2016 did not bring source reliability to the fore in a new way on Wikipedia. Rather, Wikipedians had intensely debated the reliability of sources for nearly a decade prior. It took Wikipedians until 2017 to start deprecating sources because the editors that previously vetoed such attempts were no longer active on the encyclopedia.<a href="#fn29"><span>Footnote </span>
<sup>29</sup></a></p>
<p> Another version of this hypothesis is that slow exogenous processes led Wikipedians to re-evaluate their own attitudes toward the guidelines. For example, Wikipedians may have increasingly come to hold more pro-LGBT views, stronger anti-racism views, and pro-science attitudes. While attitudinal change can certainly be documented among certain Wikipedians, they have remained very stable among many of those belonging to AF and PF, as they vote consistently for and against certain items in predictable ways over long time periods. If a disproportionate number of PF editors had not disappeared over time, they would have been able to block drastic changes.</p>
<p> A third version of this hypothesis is that the sources that Wikipedia relies on for content changed how they cover pseudoscience, conspiracy theories, and extremism. In other words, the news media and the scientific community changed, not Wikipedia. While it is true that Wikipedia is necessarily a reflection of what sources say, it is not correct that news sources and studies have uniformly moved in the same direction on all the subject matters listed in <a href="#tab1">Table 1</a> and the Supplementary Material. Even on subject matters where coverage has changed, such as climate change, climate change denial sources have changed tactics in how they argue against climate change. Rather than deny that any warming has occurred, they dispute the precise role of human activity, emphasize how “alarmist” mainstream climate scientists are, and highlight events that purportedly contradict the scientific consensus. Rather than reflect these updates to climate change denialism in mainstream sources, Wikipedians have simply excluded or debunked climate change denial rhetoric in articles. Furthermore, the particular sources that continued to promote pseudoscience, conspiracy theories, and extremism were over time ultimately deemed unreliable on Wikipedia.</p>
</div>
<div data-magellan-destination="sec15" id="sec15">
<h3> Influx of New Editors</h3>
<p> Anyone can create a Wikipedia account and edit. It is therefore reasonable to query whether Wikipedia experienced an influx of new editors with new ideas, thus causing the transformation over time. This would mean that the old guard of Wikipedia editors were simply replaced or outmaneuvered by a new breed of editors. There are several reasons why this is unlikely to have caused the transformation. Wikipedia has a very rigid and complex structure of rules and norms. New editors that edit in ways that older editors disapprove of often find themselves in trouble. As highlighted above, experience is a source of power of Wikipedia that makes it easier for the old guard to shape the encyclopedia, both by sanctioning disruptive newcomers and by indoctrinating newcomers into a “correct” way of editing. Newcomers, therefore, find themselves forced to assimilate or be booted off the platform. It is also unlikely that the later generation of Wikipedia editors tended to be more likely to be experts and predisposed to mainstream science than the first movers on Wikipedia. Judging by self-described descriptions of themselves, many of the earliest Wikipedians were scientists or had advanced degrees, in particular among editors on pages related to pseudoscience.</p>

<h2> CONCLUSION</h2>
<p> Since its inception in 2001, Wikipedia has transformed from an encyclopedia that adopted a strict “teach the controversy” approach (whereby a diversity of opinions and sources were reflected in articles) to one where Wikipedia takes firm sides on contested subjects. Whereas Wikipedia used to normalize and lend credence to pseudoscience, conspiracy theories, and fringe rhetoric, it has over time become firmly anti-pseudoscience and anti-conspiracy theories.</p>
<p> This transformation occurred through endogenous processes that were ultimately rooted in rule ambiguity, early dispute outcomes, and population loss. The resolution of early disputes in several areas of the encyclopedia demobilized certain types of editors (while mobilizing others) and strengthened certain understandings of Wikipedia’s ambiguous rules (while weakening other understandings of Wikipedia rules). Change occurred endogenously and gradually, as shared meanings from within Wikipedia’s collective about the rules got altered through a combination of compulsory power (sanctioning of dissenters by elite actors) and productive power (collective delegitimization of certain rule interpretations).</p>
<p> This explanation for institutional change on Wikipedia can plausibly help to explain institutional change in other contexts. We might observe in other institutions that institutional change happens as losers become demotivated and sanctioned, and winners become motivated and rewarded. For example, career bureaucrats might leave public service when the bureaucracy shifts toward policies that they disagree with. The bureaucrats could stay in the bureaucracy and make it harder for opponents to transform the bureaucracy, but they might instead leave the bureaucracy because they find it demotivating to fight uphill against other bureaucrats. Rather than obstruct change, the population loss of dissident bureaucrats can propel change.</p>
<p> Within political movements and parties, we can also see how establishment figures who are out of step with newly dominant ideas choose voluntarily to retire rather than obstruct change within the movement. This can plausibly be seen in the Republican Party, as Trump critics have opted to retire rather than use their position to steer the movement in a direction that they find more palatable. Similarly, victories for one side within a movement may energize winners and encourage like-minded actors to jump on the bandwagon in support of that side. This may help to explain how the Tea Party cemented its control of the Republican Party (Blum <a href="#r5"><span>Reference Blum</span>2020</a>). It may also help to explain how the conservative legal movement gradually accepted the legal theory behind the unconstitutionality of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), which was considered fringe and weak in 2010, but grew in support as conservative justices in lower courts ruled the ACA unconstitutional, ultimately almost leading the Supreme Court to rule that the ACA was unconstitutional in 2012 (a narrow 5-4 decision upheld the law while hobbling aspects of it). It may also explain why certain police department cultures form, as some police are driven out of the organization, while others get boosted. It has also been posited that the stability and strength of illiberal regimes within the European Union have gradually been strengthened as dissatisfied citizens migrate from authoritarian states to liberal states (Kelemen <a href="#r22"><span>Reference Kelemen</span>2020</a>). However, more research is needed to assess the generalizability of this endogenous mechanism for institutional change.</p>

Join us on this historical tour and we'll show you.</p></div><p>Let's travel to Barcelona's old town: the Ciutat Vella district. These narrow streets were enclosed by a wall 🏰 until 1854.</p><div id="step" data-step="9"><p>The population density was high. It was believed that diseases🦠 were spread in the form of poisonous air through miasmas. This is how cholera was depicted in the 19th century 👇</p><p><img src="https://especiales.eldiario.es/spain-lives-in-flats/assets/colera-imagen.jfif" width="100%"></p></div><p>Ildefons Cerdà wanted to demonstrate that the high population density was deadly. With his design of the Eixample, influenced by the hygienist movement, his proposed planning for the city lowered population density and regenerated the air.</p><p>Cerdà thought of open blocks with interior gardens🌳. Speculation truncated his plan. In the end, some areas of the Eixample became denser than the Ciutat Vella.</p><p>Today, Barcelona is one of the tallest and densest cities in the country. So are the municipalities on its periphery, such as L'Hospitalet or Santa Coloma, which grew from the 1950s onwards, as a result of the rural exodus👨🌾.</p><div id="step" data-step="13"><p>Data from the Spanish Cadastre (not includign Euskadi and Navarra) shows this relationship in most Spanish cities. <span>The taller</span> the constructions in the cities are, the higher its population density. In addition to the Barcelona metropolitan area, other urban areas such as Cádiz and Valencia are among the densest and tallest so far.</p><div id="contenedor-circulos-altura-municipios"><p>Comparison between population density and average height of cities with more than 20,000 inhabitants<img src="https://especiales.eldiario.es/spain-lives-in-flats/assets/dedo.png" alt="scroll"></p><p>Source: Spanish Cadastre, INE (Spanish Statistical Office)</p></div></div><p>Between 1950 and 1975, thousands of Spaniards migrated from the countryside🚜to the city🌆. Franco's dictatorship Ministry of Housing promoted the construction of high-rise housing estates to accommodate them.</p><p>This is the "Antonio Rueda" housing group, consisting of 1,002 low-income social housing units. This type of development was influenced by the modern movement.</p><div id="step" data-step="16"><p>During the 60's and 70's more dwellings were built in Spain, and these were higher than ever. Thus, the first 'metropolitan crowns' were created, surrounding the historic nuclei and the 'ensanches' (widenings) of the beginning of the century. 👇</p><p>Buildings with 5 or more stories per decade</p><div><p><img src="https://especiales.eldiario.es/spain-lives-in-flats/assets/grafico-evolucion-mas5plantas.svg" width="100%"></p><p>Source: Spanish Cadastre</p></div></div><div id="step" data-step="17"><p>Housing blocks built under Francoist developmentalism started with four stories because there was no money for elevators. Then came the H-shaped blocks, which incorporated an elevator and more stories so as to make it profitable. The distribution of dwellings in each city according to the number of floors in the building shows this phenomenon.</p><p>For example, most of the industrial belts within large cities concentrate their housing in 5-story buildings. Also developed in the 1970s, other industrial estates such as Fuenlabrada, Alcorcón and L'Hospitalet condense most of their housing in buildings with seven, eight or more floors.</p><div id="contenedor-alturas-grupos-viviendas"><p>Distribution of dwellings in each municipality according to the number of floors of the building<img src="https://especiales.eldiario.es/spain-lives-in-flats/assets/dedo.png" alt="scroll"></p><p>Source: Spanish Cadastre</p></div></div><p>An example of these H-shaped polygon developments is in Móstoles, on the outskirts of Madrid.</p><p>From the 1980s onwards, the rural exodus slowed down. At the same time, the 'urban sprawl'🏡, inspired by American suburbs, arrived in Spain.</p><p>Municipalities such as Sant Cugat del Vallès (Barcelona), Godella (Valencia) or Pozuelo (Madrid) are good examples of urban sprawl.</p><p>The housing is single-family🏠. The population density is very low, which increases the cost of public services.</p><p>But such real estate is a luxury and does not reach many people. Urban sprawl would continue in the form of townhouses🏘️, especially during the 1990s, and housing blocks.</p><p>In Santa Marta de Tormes, in the metropolitan area of Salamanca, there are several developments of townhouses, also called 'pearl necklaces'.</p><div id="step" data-step="24"><p>This change is clearly shown in the evolution of housing built in each decade in Spain. While buildings of five or more floors were in the majority during the first development boom in the 1960s and 1970s, during the real-estate bubble mainly low-rise dwellings were built.</p><div id="contenedor-alturas-evolucion-decadas"><p>Evolution of the number of dwellings built in each decade, according to the number of floors of the building<img src="https://especiales.eldiario.es/spain-lives-in-flats/assets/dedo.png" alt="scroll"></p><p>Source: Spanish Cadastre</p></div></div><p>Parallel to the townhouse fever, and after the polygons and H-blocks, came the next generation of housing blocks: the perimeter block, which would predominate from the 1990s until the bursting of the real-estate bubble and after the recovery.</p><p>Parque Venecia, a neighborhood in Zaragoza, is a prime example of a new neighborhood with perimeter blocks. It was planned in the middle of the bubble and its urbanization began in 2008. Its 7,000 residents, young families with children, <span><a href="https://www.heraldo.es/noticias/aragon/zaragoza/2021/06/27/parque-venecia-cumple-diez-anos-con-el-80-de-los-pisos-ejecutados-y-a-la-espera-de-mas-servicios-en-zaragoza-1502452.html" target="_blank">have denounced the lack of public services. </a></span>.</p><p>These new 'ensanches' offer more affordable housing than the consolidated city and attract the middle classes. They tend to be sparse and disconnected from the city.</p><div id="step" data-step="28"><p>City centers rised in value before the outbreak of COVID-19.

    <p>
      
        <strong>
          Importance:
        </strong>
      
      Time-restricted eating (TRE) has become increasingly popular, yet longer-term randomized clinical trials have not evaluated its efficacy and safety in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D).
    </p>
  

  


              
                


  
    <p>
      
        <strong>
          Objective:
        </strong>
      
      To determine whether TRE is more effective for weight reduction and glycemic control than daily calorie restriction (CR) or a control condition in adults with T2D.
    </p>
  

  


              
                


  
    <p>
      
        <strong>
          Design, setting, and participants:
        </strong>
      
      This 6-month, parallel-group, randomized clinical trial was performed between January 25, 2022, and April 1, 2023, at the University of Illinois Chicago. Participants were aged 18 to 80 years with obesity and T2D. Data analysis was based on intention to treat.
    </p>
  

  


              
                


  
    <p>
      
        <strong>
          Interventions:
        </strong>
      
      Participants were randomized to 1 of 3 groups: 8-hour TRE (eating 12 to 8 pm only, without calorie counting), CR (25% energy restriction daily), or control.
    </p>
  

  


              
                


  
    <p>
      
        <strong>
          Main outcomes and measures:
        </strong>
      
      The primary outcome measure was change in body weight by month 6. Secondary outcomes included changes in hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels and metabolic risk factors.
    </p>
  

  


              
                


  
    <p>
      
        <strong>
          Results:
        </strong>
      
      Seventy-five participants were enrolled with a mean (SD) age of 55 (12) years. The mean (SD) body mass index (calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared) was 39 (7) and the mean (SD) HbA1c level was 8.1% (1.6%). A total of 53 participants (71%) were women. One participant (1%) was Asian, 30 (40%) were Hispanic White, 40 (53%) were non-Hispanic Black, and 4 (5%) were non-Hispanic White. Participants in the TRE group were adherent with their eating window on a mean (SD) of 6.1 (0.8) days per week, and 17 (68%) in the CR group were adherent with their prescribed calorie goals over 6 months. The mean (SD) reduction in energy intake was -313 (509) kcal/d for TRE, -197 (426) kcal/d for CR, and -16 (439) kcal/d for controls. By month 6, body weight decreased significantly in the TRE group (-3.56% [95% CI, -5.92% to -1.20%]; P = .004) but not the CR group (-1.78% [95% CI, -3.67% to 0.11%]; P = .06), relative to controls. Levels of HbA1c decreased in the TRE (-0.91% [95% CI, -1.61% to -0.20%]) and CR (-0.94% [95% CI, -1.59% to -0.30%]) groups, relative to controls, with no differences between the TRE and CR groups. Time in euglycemic range, medication effect score, blood pressure, and plasma lipid levels did not differ among groups. No serious adverse events were reported.
    </p>
  

  


              
                


  
    <p>
      
        <strong>
          Conclusions and relevance:
        </strong>
      
      This randomized clinical trial found that a TRE diet strategy without calorie counting was effective for weight loss and lowering of HbA1c levels compared with daily calorie counting in a sample of adults with T2D. These findings will need to be confirmed by larger RCTs with longer follow-up.

<p><b><span data-contrast="auto">In response to a request for documents pertaining to the decision-making behind the proposed CSAM regulation, the European Commission failed to disclose a list of companies who were consulted about the technical feasibility of detecting CSAM without undermining encryption. This list “clearly fell within the scope” of the Irish Council for Civil Liberties’ request.</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559739&quot;:200}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span data-contrast="auto">The European Ombudsman has now held that the Commission’s failure to disclose the existence of this list constituted “maladministration”.</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559739&quot;:200}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span data-contrast="auto">The technical feasibility question is a major sticking point in the EU negotiations around this file.</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559739&quot;:200}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Numerous experts have warned that it is not technically feasible.

<p><span data-contrast="auto">In December 2022, ICCL filed complaints with the European Ombudsman against the European Commission’s refusal to provide a list of experts who helped the Commission draft the </span><a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=SWD:2022:209:FIN&amp;from=EN"><span data-contrast="none">text</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> related to potential solutions to detect child sexual abuse material in end-to-end encrypted communications.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559739&quot;:200}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">After the Commission acknowledged to the EU Ombudsman that it, in fact, had such a list, but failed to disclose its existence to Dr Kris Shrishak, the Ombudsman held the Commission’s behaviour constituted “maladministration”.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559739&quot;:200}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">The Ombudsman held: “[</span><span data-contrast="none">t]he Commission did not identify the list of experts as falling within the scope of the complainant’s request. This means that the complainant did not have the opportunity to challenge (the reasons for) the institution’s refusal to disclose the document.

<p><span data-contrast="none">The proposed regulation on </span><span data-contrast="auto">child sexual abuse material has been hugely controversial.

<p><span data-contrast="auto">“</span><i><span data-contrast="auto">In light of these concerns, the lack of transparency from the Commission regarding external experts is deeply worrying, more so considering alleged close links between the Commission and lobbyists in the preparation of the regulation</span></i><span data-contrast="auto">”, said </span><span data-contrast="auto">Dr Kris Shrishak, Senior Fellow at ICCL.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span></p>
