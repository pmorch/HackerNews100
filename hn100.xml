                    <p><strong>Since the beginning of November, Instagram and Facebook users who don’t want to be tracked have to pay a “privacy fee” of up to € 251.88 per year. While one (free) click is enough to consent to being tracked, users can only withdraw their consent by going through the complicated process of switching to a paid subscription. This is illegal, as the GDPR clearly states that withdrawing your consent must be “as easy as” giving it. In addition to a </strong><a href="https://noyb.eu/en/noyb-files-gdpr-complaint-against-meta-over-pay-or-okay"><strong>previous </strong><em><strong>noyb </strong></em><strong>complaint</strong></a><strong> relating to the consent phase of the “pay or okay” system, </strong><em><strong>noyb </strong></em><strong>has filed an additional complaint with the Austrian data protection authority today to take into account the withdrawal situation.</strong></p><ul><li><a href="https://noyb.eu/sites/default/files/2024-01/Meta_Withdrawal_Complaint_REDACTED_EN.pdf">Complaint against Meta on the withdrawal issue</a> (EN)</li><li><a href="https://noyb.eu/sites/default/files/2023-11/Complaint%20-%20Meta%20Pay%20or%20Okay%20-%20REDACTED.pdf">Previous complaint relating to the consent phase</a> (EN – Machine translation)</li></ul><p><strong>Meta’s latest attempt to circumvent EU privacy laws.</strong> It has merely been six months since the European Court of Justice (CJEU)<a href="https://noyb.eu/en/cjeu-declares-metafacebooks-gdpr-approach-largely-illegal"> ruled that Meta’s handling of user data was illegal</a>. Yet the social media giant has launched its third attempt to circumvent European privacy laws. Instead of asking users for their consent, Meta is now charging people for choosing a privacy-friendly setting. As of the beginning of November 2023, it costs up to €251.88 a year to maintain your fundamental right to data protection on Facebook and Instagram. Users who don’t want to pay will have to accept being tracked for targeted advertising. <em>noyb </em><a href="https://noyb.eu/en/noyb-files-gdpr-complaint-against-meta-over-pay-or-okay">has already filed a complaint</a> against this approach in November 2023.</p><p><strong>Expensive withdrawal of consent.</strong> But Meta’s seriously flawed approach to free consent isn’t the only issue at hand. Once users have consented to being tracked, there’s no easy way to withdraw it at a later date. This is illegal. Despite Article 7 of the GDPR clearly stating that “it shall be as easy to withdraw as to give consent”, the only option to “withdraw” the (one-click) consent, is to buy a € 251.88 subscription. In addition, the complainant had to navigate through several windows and banners to find the page where he could actually revoke consent.</p><p>Massimiliano Gelmi, data protection lawyer at <em>noyb</em>: <em>“The law is clear, withdrawing consent must be as easy as giving it in the first place. It is painfully obvious that paying € 251,88 per year to withdraw consent is not as easy as clicking an “Okay” button to accept the tracking.”</em></p><p><strong>Clear violation.</strong> The European Data Protection Board (EDPB) even mention monetary costs as an example of a burden that is incompatible with the principle of Article 7 GDPR in its guidelines, making it clear that Meta is making the withdrawal of consent not nearly as easy as to give consent.</p><p><strong>Complaint filed in Austria.</strong> <em>noyb </em>has now filed a complaint with the Austrian data protection authority (DSB) on behalf of one complainant. The authority should order Meta to bring its processing operations in compliance with European data protection law and to provide users with an easy way to withdraw their consent – without having to pay a fee. In addition, <em>noyb </em>suggests that the authorities should impose a fine to prevent further violations of the GDPR. The case will likely be forwarded by the Austrian DSB to the Irish DPC, who is the “lead authority” for Meta in the EU.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
      <p>You used <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/epoll.7.html">epoll</a> to fetch this blog post. For almost anything you do on the Internet the server will be running Linux and it will use <code>epoll</code> to receive and answer your request in a timely and affordable manner.</p>
<ul>
<li>epoll is what makes Go such a great language for writing server software. Here is epoll in <a href="https://github.com/golang/go/blob/f229e7031a6efb2f23241b5da000c3b3203081d6/src/runtime/netpoll_epoll.go#L101-L126">Go’s netpoll</a>.</li>
<li>epoll is what makes nginx the <a href="https://news.netcraft.com/archives/2021/12/22/december-2021-web-server-survey.html">most popular web server</a> in the world (this blog runs nginx). Here is <a href="https://github.com/nginx/nginx/blob/a64190933e06758d50eea926e6a55974645096fd/src/event/modules/ngx_epoll_module.c#L784-L800">nginx’s use of epoll</a>.</li>
<li>and it is often what we mean when we say ‘async’ in most programming languages. For example, of Rust’s two main async frameworks, async-std uses <a href="https://github.com/smol-rs/polling/blob/master/src/epoll.rs#L156-L157">polling</a> and tokio uses <a href="https://github.com/tokio-rs/mio/blob/dca2134ef355b3c0d00e8e338e44e7d9ed63edac/src/sys/unix/selector/epoll.rs#L68">mio</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Aside: All of the above work on many operating systems and support API’s other than <code>epoll</code>, which is Linux specific. The Internet is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usage_share_of_operating_systems#Public_servers_on_the_Internet">mostly made of</a> <a href="https://w3techs.com/technologies/details/os-unix">Linux</a>, so epoll is the API that matters.</p>

<p>The core problem of running a network service, the problem epoll fixes, is that your network is very fast and your clients network is very slow. A server handling a request typically looks like this:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>read the user's request (e.g. a browser HTTP GET)
do what they asked (e.g. load some information from the database)
write a response (e.g. HTML that the browser will display)
</code></pre><p>During the “read” and “write” parts above the server is idle, waiting for data or acknowledgments of that data to move across the network.</p>
<h4 id="before-epoll">Before epoll </h4>
<p>Before epoll the standard way to overcome this was to run a pool of processes each handling a different user request, typically with Apache <a href="https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/prefork.html">mod_prefork</a>. While one process waits on the user to acknowledge a packet of data, a different process can use the CPU. An emerging alternative was to use a thread pool which is lighter than a process pool and could handle low-hundreds of concurrent users. Multi-threading was risky as many libraries were not thread safe. Steven’s 2004 reference <a href="https://amzn.to/3FUlV4n">UNIX Network Programming</a> has a chapter discussing preforked vs prethreaded designs, because those were your options back then.</p>
<p>Then along came everybody, and even hundreds of concurrent users turned out not to be enough. An influential article, <a href="http://www.kegel.com/c10k.html">The C10K problem</a> started this discussion in 1999. It was not uncommon for web requests to timeout. People would <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirror_site">mirror</a> popular sites in an effort to spread the traffic.</p>
<h4 id="the-solution">The solution </h4>
<p>In 2000 Jonathan Lemon solved this problem for FreeBSD 4.3 by designing and building <a href="https://people.freebsd.org/~jlemon/papers/kqueue.pdf">kqueue/kevent</a>, making BSD the early choice for high performance networking.</p>
<p>Independently, in July 2001 Davide Libenzi solved the problem for Linux, with the <a href="http://www.xmailserver.org/linux-patches/nio-improve.html">first draft of epoll</a>, which <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/16026/">evolved</a>, was <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/13481/">merged</a> into Linux kernel 2.5.44 (a development release) in October 2002 and became widely available in December 2003 with the release of stable kernel 2.6.</p>
<p>Jim Blandy has a fantastic <a href="https://github.com/jimblandy/context-switch">comparison of threads vs epoll-based async here</a>.</p>
<h4 id="how-it-works">How it works </h4>
<p>epoll allows a single thread or process to register interest in a long list of network sockets (it supports things other than network sockets such as pipes and terminals, but you rarely have thousands of those). An <code>epoll_wait</code> call will then block until one of those is ready for reading or writing. A single thread using epoll can handle tens of thousands of concurrent (and mostly idle) requests.</p>
<p>The downside of epoll is that it changes the architecture of your application. Instead of a handling each connection with a straightforward <code>{read request, handle, write response}</code>, you now have a main loop more akin to a game engine. The code becomes:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>loop
 epoll_wait on all the connections
 for each of the ready connections:
   continue from where you left off
</code></pre><p>You might be part way through reading a request on one of the ready sockets, and part way through writing a response on another socket. You have to remember your state, do only as much I/O as the socket can take without blocking, and then epoll_wait again. A large part of the popularity of Go, and of the ‘async/await’ model in languages like C#, Javascript and Rust, is that they hide that event loop, allowing you to write straight-line code as if you were still doing thread-per-connection.</p>
<h4 id="conclusion">Conclusion </h4>
<p>Without epoll either the economics of today’s Internet would look quite different (fewer requests per machine, so more machines, costing more money), or we’d be running our servers on a BSD. And without BSD’s kqueue (which preceded epoll by two years), we’d really be in trouble because the only alternatives were proprietary (/dev/poll in Solaris 8 and I/O Completion Ports in Windows NT 3.5).</p>
<p>epoll has been improved since it’s initial release, particularly with EPOLLONESHOT and EPOLLEXCLUSIVE flags, but the core API has stayed the same. epoll solved the C10K problem on Linux, which powers the Internet, allowing us to build fast and cheap Internet services.</p>
<p>Thanks Davide!</p>

<h3 id="addendum-predecessors">Addendum: predecessors </h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Linux had <code>poll</code> and <code>select</code> before <code>epoll</code>. They were designed to handle a handful of file descriptors and they scale O(n) on that count. epoll scales O(1). <a href="https://amzn.to/3r3IVIf">Kerrisk</a> has performance numbers showing poll and select becoming unusable beyond the hundreds of file descriptors, while epoll remains fast into the tens of thousands.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Linux also had signal-driven I/O before <code>epoll</code>. To quote <a href="https://amzn.to/3FUlV4n">UNIX Network Programming</a>:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Unfortunately, signal-driven I/O is next to useless with a TCP socket</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The only real-world use of signal-driven I/O with sockets that the authors were able to find is the NTP server, which uses UDP.</p>

<p>I work in computer graphics for a small company on our own game engine. We also have an in house team of artists creating content for this engine.</p>
<p>I am often tasked with taking suggestions from the artists and implementing them in the engine. The artists have no technical expertise, so I meet with them to understand their ideas and needs, and do so again to explain the functionality, limitations, and so on of my solution.</p>
<p>Recently it happened quite a few times that after such a meeting (where I explained that their requirements aren't 100% achievable and provided an alternative working solution) I get a message from the artists, along with a screenshot of an ostensible but frankly ludicrous solution proposed by ChatGPT. They then ask why I could not do what ChatGPT suggests.</p>
<p>I then have to take the time to explain why ChatGPT's proposed solution wouldn't work, which  is tedious and difficult when the other persons do not understand many of the basic ideas involved. They also seem skeptical, and I get the idea they feel I'm incompetent because as I understand it ChatGPT is very useful in their setting, and they have come to believe it to be the ultimate source of knowledge.</p>
<p>How can I, without being condescending to either my coworkers or their use of ChatGPT, ask them to not make suggestions to me that they personally don't understand and are based solely on ChatGPT?</p>

<p>Thank for your clarifying in the comments, and to bring them up here:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I take the time to understand and consider each suggestion, not rejecting anything out of hand, and share them with my team members (of which there are 17). Their advice has been, thus far, to "just ignore". However, I would not like to treat my co-workers that way.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sounds like you need to break that pattern, but also you don't necessarily want to be the hammer that drops in order to break it - as that rarely gets received in a friendly fashion, especially when they are used to just getting you to answer and consider the ideas.</p>
<p>The solution in that case is quite simple - reach out to your boss/manager, explain that while you appreciate the suggestions, they are not helpful (have example or two ready here), they drain a lot of your time and focus (example or two) but also that you do not wish to be rude to your well-meaning co-workers (keep your face straight saying that) and ask them to step in and be the hammer to curtail the flow of unhelpful and uneducated advice. Focus on the points you can easily prove - that the advice is wrong and it's a time drain - don't go into motives or anything else.</p>
<p>Ultimately that's the best way, as you are not in the place to tell them what to do, just as they cannot really tell you how to resolve an issue, and trying to pull some imaginary rank would likely alienate relationships further, and speaking in friendly way for them to see error of their way was dismissed. So time to call the actual powers to be, and let them manage as they are hired to do.</p>
<p>If the drain then continues, raise it with your boss/manager again.</p>

<p><strong>TL;DR -</strong> If you need this to stop, you need to have proof that the suggestions given to you are of low quality or outright wrong / infeasible. You do not need to differentiate yourself between a suggestion generated by a human or a machine. When someone presents a solution, and you have genuine reasons to turn them down, feel free.</p>
<p>Treat this as, they are not learning from their past interactions with you, and keep providing solutions which are not feasible / plausible in your setting / context. Whether the ideas or suggestions are generated by themselves or via prompt engineering, is not really relevant in this case. As needed, document these interactions, and present to your supervisor / manager, as how you are presented with below-par suggestions and you are investing time to prove the suggestions wrong, time and again.</p>
<p>Eventually when they see a "copy-pasted" content is not going to cut it, they'll put real efforts to make the content worthy.</p>
<hr>
<p>Edit after the comments:</p>
<p>Yes, at the beginning, it is an uphill battle, as the suggestions can be generated using ChatGPT, (or a simple web search, without context and having proper research and adaptation done) in relatively very less time, but it takes much longer to disprove them. However, this is still necessary for below reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>It creates a document trail of your efforts. This does not only show that you are putting effort to filter out the suggestions, it also shows that you are providing explanations and feedback on why or how the suggestions are unfit for the purpose, and you're trying to help your co-workers to improve on themselves.</li>
<li>It shows that you are actually evaluating the solutions, not their source. People cannot cry foul that their suggestions are being ignored because they are "smarter" and generated suggestions by "clever" or "efficient" ways (whatever that means).</li>

<p><strong>Demonstrate it in their own domain</strong></p>
<p>If all else fails, how hard would it be to take one of the artists’ tools that is scriptable and generate scripts for it with ChatGPT? E.g. Blender is scriptable if they use Blender. My guess is many of their tools will be scriptable. Then you could as a teaching moment (maybe as part of a seminar), generate some scripts to create art assets or do something else with the art tool and demonstrate how while the AI gets close and can be helpful for simple tasks, for complex tasks the amount of human intervention is more trouble than it’s worth. This might take a good bit of work on your part finding out which tools are suitably scriptable and coming up with use cases that are of comparable complexity to the code the artists are giving you, and verifying that the AI generated scripts are wrong in a way that the artists will understand, but it could make the case pretty strongly. Obviously don’t do this on the fly—do your homework, verify that the AI really does a consistently and convincingly bad job before hand and run canned examples in the actual seminar; don’t come up with ones on the fly.</p>
<p>The artists may already be using AI but I’m guessing they’re not using it to generate scripts to fully-automate their tools since that’s effectively code and ChatGPT still has a long long way to go to be a competent coder. So if you can show them it’s bad at generating code in their domain, it may click.</p>

<p>As a former game engineer, I note the OP's comment to the question:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I take the time to understand and consider each suggestion, not
rejecting anything out of hand, and share them with my team members
(of which there are 17). Their advice has been, thus far, to "just
ignore". However, I would not like to treat my co-workers that way.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you have a team of 17 all of whom are telling you to "just ignore" it, then I would recommend that you follow the team's consensus. If you must make it a bit more diplomatic, then you could briefly reply, "Our team policy is to not take outside technical suggestions", and/or "If you think this needs escalating, you can address it with our manager".</p>
<p>Edit the exact phrasing to your situation or taste, of course, but I would keep it curt to avoid inviting further interaction on the issue. That is, the further you stray from "just ignore", the worse you're making it for your team. In particular, addressing the ChatGPT-ness invites debate/subterfuge about whether it was really ChatGPT or something else.</p>

<p>“Sorry, but ChatGPT does not have a deeper understanding of what it is talking about, which is very important in computer programs.  It is at best a rough suggestion created by stitching together various snippets and require an experienced developer to debug and fix.  This will most likely take longer and be of inferior quality to what we have already. Thanks anyway for your efforts “</p>
<p>I had ChatGPT tell me how to build OS/2 programs with GitHub actions.  Everything looked fine except GitHub didn’t support it. Hopefully this will also improve - it is still impressive what we have now.</p>

<p>Don't ask your coworkers.</p>
<p>There is a direct conflict in what you want from your coworkers (to not make suggestions that they don't fully understand) and what you have been tasked to do (to take suggestions from artists without any technical expertise).  You need to speak to your boss and clearly explain this conflict and follow their guidance on how to proceed.</p>

<p>There is an answer (with quite a few up votes) that says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you need this to stop, you need to have proof that the suggestions given to you are of low quality or outright wrong / infeasible.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is rather wrong. Your boss expects you to use your judgement about which technologies to use, which to investigate, and how much time to spend investigating different technologies. Go to your boss, present your view on the likely effectiveness of ChatGPT suggestions, and ask your boss how much time they want you to spend understanding them and explaining their problems to other employees. If your boss wants you to waste your time on this, tell them you will, and tell them you expect nothing useful to come from it.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="BodyComponentRenderer"><p><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>For much of the 21st century, software engineering has been seen as one of the safest havens in the tenuous and ever-changing American job market.</p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>But there are a growing number of signs that the field is starting to become a little less secure and comfortable, due to an industry-wide downturn and the <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/n7zxn7/learn-to-write-ai-advancements-mean-code-will-be-written-in-natural-english">looming threat of artificial intelligence</a> that is spurring growing competition for software jobs.&nbsp;</p></span></p><p><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>“The amount of competition is insane,” said Joe Forzano, an unemployed software engineer who has worked at the mental health startup Alma and private equity giant Blackstone.&nbsp;</p></span></p><blockquote data-component="QuoteBlock"><p><em><strong>Has AI affected your job? We want to hear from you. From a non-work device, contact our reporter at maxwell.strachan@vice.com or via Signal at 310-614-3752 for extra security.</strong></em></p></blockquote><p><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>Since he lost his job in March, Forzano has applied to over 250 jobs. In six cases, he went through the “full interview gauntlet,” which included between six and eight interviews each, before learning he had been passed over. “It has been very, very rough,” he told Motherboard.&nbsp;</p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>Forzano is not alone in his pessimism, according to a December survey of 9,338 software engineers performed on behalf of Motherboard by Blind, an online anonymous platform for verified employees. In the poll, nearly nine in 10 surveyed software engineers said it is more difficult to get a job now than it was before the pandemic, with 66 percent saying it was “much harder.”&nbsp;</p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>Nearly 80 percent of respondents said the job market has even become more competitive over the last year. Only 6 percent of the software engineers were “extremely confident” they could find another job with the same total compensation if they lost their job today while 32 percent said they were “not at all confident.”&nbsp;</p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>Over 2022 and 2023, the tech sector incurred <a href="https://layoffs.fyi/" target="_blank">more than 400,000 layoffs</a>, according to the tracking site Layoffs.fyi. But up until recently, it seemed software engineers were more often spared compared to their co-workers in <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/3akddn/i-got-to-break-free-laid-off-tech-workers-search-for-new-purpose-outside-silicon-valley">non-technical fields</a>. One <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/silicon-valleys-talent-spotters-are-now-looking-for-jobs-11669725577" target="_blank">analysis found tech companies cut their recruiting teams</a> by 50 percent, compared to only 10 percent of their engineering departments. At Salesforce, engineers were four times less likely to lose their jobs than those in marketing and sales, which <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/these-tech-workers-say-they-were-hired-to-do-nothing-762ff158" target="_blank">Bloomberg has said</a> is a trend replicated at other tech companies such as Dell and Zoom.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></span><span></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>But signs of dread among software engineers have started to become more common online. In December, one Amazon employee wrote a long post on the anonymous employee platform Blind saying that the “<a href="https://www.teamblind.com/post/Job-Market-is-Terrible-7anaSof8" target="_blank">job market is terrible</a>” and that he was struggling to get interviews of any sort.&nbsp;</p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>The situation is a stark shift from much of the past two decades, when <a href="https://www.princetonreview.com/college-advice/top-ten-college-majors" target="_blank">computer science degrees and coding bootcamps exploded in popularity</a> due to the financial security they both promised. <a href="https://archive.is/jjBty" target="_blank">Entry-level Google software engineers reportedly</a> earned almost $200,000 a year and lived a life full of splashy perks, and engineers always seemed in high demand, meaning the next job was never hard to find.&nbsp;</p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>As an undergraduate at the University of Pennsylvania in the early 2010s, Forzano had decided to major in computer science. The degree had put him in $180,000 of debt, but he saw it as a calculated bet on a sturdy field of work. “The whole concept was [that] it was a good investment to have that ‘Ivy League degree’ in an engineering field,” he said. He thought he’d be set for life.&nbsp;</p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>Early in his career, that seemed to be true. Recruiters spammed him with opportunities, and he was easily able to jump from job to job and became a manager. The field felt so secure that the phrase “learn to code” became a mocking rejoinder whenever people in other fields expressed concern about their own job prospects online.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></span><span></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>But the messages from recruiters have largely dried up since the pandemic, and getting the sort of jobs software engineers took for granted has become much harder. “There's just so much fucking competition,” he said. “It's a completely different landscape.” Thinking back to his decision to major in computer science as an undergraduate, he said he now feels “very naive.”</p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>With the entrance of artificial intelligence into the conversation recently, there have been signs of a sea change in the coding world. AI programs that allow users to write code using natural language or auto-complete code were among the first wave of AI tools to take off. <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/n7zxn7/learn-to-write-ai-advancements-mean-code-will-be-written-in-natural-english">Google CEO Sundar Pichai said last year</a> that AI-powered coding tools had reduced the time it takes workers to complete code by 6 percent.&nbsp;</p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>“In the age of AI, computer science is no longer the safe major,” <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/09/computer-science-degree-value-generative-ai-age/675452/" target="_blank">Kelli María Korducki wrote in </a><em><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/09/computer-science-degree-value-generative-ai-age/675452/" target="_blank">The Atlantic</a></em> in September. Matt Welsh, an entrepreneur who used to serve as a computer science professor at Harvard, told the magazine that the ability of AI to perform software engineering functions could lead to less job security and lower compensation for all but the very best in the software trade.</p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>As of December, software engineers were not expressing much concern about AI making their jobs redundant. Only 28 percent saying they were “very” or “slightly” concerned in the Blind poll, and 72 percent saying they were “not really” or “not at all” concerned.&nbsp;</p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>But when not considering their own situation, the software engineering world’s views on AI became markedly less optimistic. More than 60 percent of those surveyed said they believed their company would hire fewer people because of AI moving forward. &nbsp;</p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>Forzano has not been shy about his trouble, sharing his pursuit for a new job on social media. The decision has led him to feel less alone, he said, as other tech workers expressed similar frustration about not being able to get interviews for jobs they felt overqualified for.&nbsp;</p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>“We're all kind of like, ‘What the fuck is happening?’” he said.</p></span></p></div><div><p><h3>ORIGINAL REPORTING ON EVERYTHING THAT MATTERS IN YOUR INBOX.</h3></p><p>By signing up, you agree to the<!-- --> <a href="https://vice-web-statics-cdn.vice.com/privacy-policy/en_us/page/terms-of-use.html">Terms of Use</a> <!-- -->and<!-- --> <a href="https://vice-web-statics-cdn.vice.com/privacy-policy/en_us/page/privacy-policy.html">Privacy Policy</a> <!-- -->&amp; to receive electronic communications from Vice Media Group, which may include marketing promotions, advertisements and sponsored content.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
      <p>We are going to <strong>stitch three things</strong> together to make Rust objects that <strong>survive program restart</strong>. The memory backing the object will continue existing while the program restarts.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Systemd’s <a href="https://systemd.io/FILE_DESCRIPTOR_STORE/">File Descriptor Store</a> (systemd 254+) allows us to give any file descriptor to systemd, and later ask for it back. The file stays open when we <code>systemctl restart &lt;prog&gt;</code>. Yes this is similar to <a href="https://darkcoding.net/software/systemd-socket-activation-in-go/">socket activation</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <a href="https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/memfd_create.2.html">memfd_create</a> syscall (Linux 3.17+) creates an anonymous file that only exists in memory, and only as long as a reference to it exists. It effectively gives us a file descriptor pointing to a chunk of allocated memory. It behaves like a regular file so we can map it into regular memory with <a href="https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/mmap.2.html">mmap</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rust’s <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/alloc/trait.Allocator.html">Allocator trait</a> which allows us to control the memory an object lives in (Rust nightly since at least 2 years ago). We will select our allocator with <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/boxed/struct.Box.html#method.new_in">Box::new_in</a>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>We will make a Rust allocator which creates a memfd, shares it with systemd, mmap’s it, and uses that memory as the allocation our allocator returns. When the program restarts we ask systemd for our memfds, mmap it, and convert that into our object. Finally we wrap the allocator and the ‘restorer’ in a function which figures out whether we are allocating a new object or recovering an existing one.</p>
<p>Here’s an arbitrary object we will use throught the post:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>// An arbitrary object we'll be using throughout this post
#[allow(dead_code)]
#[derive(Debug, Default)]
struct Person {
    name: [u8; 8],
    credits: u32,
    age: u8,
    is_admin: bool,
    count: u32,
}
</code></pre><p>Note the rather awkward <code>name</code> array. We don’t want any pointers in our object, so no <code>String</code> or <code>Vec</code> because those would also need to go in our permanent memory store.</p>
<h2 id="a-rust-allocator">A Rust Allocator </h2>
<p>If we allocate an object on the heap with <code>Box</code>, by default it will use the sytem allocator, which on Linux uses malloc. <a href="https://darkcoding.net/software/underrust-rust-assembly-output/">Looking at the assembly</a> we see it call <code>__rust_alloc</code> (via <code>GLOBAL_OFFSET_TABLE</code>) which calls <code>__rdl_alloc</code> which calls glibc’s <code>malloc</code>.</p>
<p><code>malloc</code> will get memory from the operating system (<a href="https://darkcoding.net/software/how-memory-is-allocated/">details</a>) by either moving the program break (<code>sbrk</code> syscall) or by memory mapping an anonymous region (via <code>mmap</code> syscall).</p>
<p>Rust (nightly) allows us to implement our own allocator. Here is an allocator that delegates to the system allocator - the allocator you’re using if you don’t know which one you’re using.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>#![feature(allocator_api)]
use std::{
    alloc::{AllocError, Allocator, GlobalAlloc, Layout, System},
    ptr::NonNull,
};

struct DelegateAlloc {}
unsafe impl Allocator for DelegateAlloc {
    fn allocate(&amp;self, layout: Layout) -&gt; Result&lt;NonNull&lt;[u8]&gt;, AllocError&gt; {
        unsafe {
            let ptr = System.alloc(layout);
            let slice = std::slice::from_raw_parts_mut(ptr, layout.size());
            Ok(NonNull::new_unchecked(slice))
        }
    }

    unsafe fn deallocate(&amp;self, ptr: NonNull&lt;u8&gt;, layout: Layout) {
        System.dealloc(ptr.as_ptr(), layout)
    }
}
</code></pre><p>We use it like this:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>    let d = DelegateAlloc {};
    let p = Box::new_in(Person::default(), d);
</code></pre><h2 id="an-allocator-backed-by-persistent-memory">An allocator backed by persistent memory </h2>
<p>Now that we know how to write an allocator, let’s make the memory it uses be in a file systemd owns. We need to call <code>memfd_create</code>, then <code>mmap</code> that file descriptor, and finally give it to systemd.</p>

<p>There are two cases:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Create: When we are creating a new allocation we need to call <code>memfd_create</code>, and then give that file descriptor to systemd by calling <a href="https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/latest/sd_pid_notify_with_fds.html">sd_pid_notify_with_fds</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Restore: When we are starting up we ask systemd for the fd by calling <a href="https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/latest/sd_listen_fds_with_names.html">sd_listen_fds_with_names</a>. Then we only need to <code>mmap</code>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In either case after <code>mmap</code> we end up with a bag of bytes, which we need to convince Rust is a <code>Person</code>. That’s what <code>buf_addr as *mut u8 as *mut T</code> is doing (here <code>T</code> is <code>Person</code>).</p>
<p>We use the allocator like this:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>fn main() -&gt; anyhow::Result&lt;()&gt; {
    let salloc = SystemdAlloc::new("person1".to_string())?;
    let mut p1: Box&lt;Person, SystemdAlloc&gt; = salloc.into_box(Person::default())?;
    p1.count += 1;
    println!("{}", p1.count);
    std:🧵:sleep(std::time::Duration::from_secs(3600));
}
</code></pre><p><code>Person</code> is an arbitrary object, there’s one at the start of this post.</p>
<p>Each object must have a name which we associate with the FD in systemd. On restore that allows us to map the correct FD back to the object.</p>
<p>The memory only exists while the program is active (meaning running or restarting). If the program is stopped systemd will evict it’s file descriptor from the store. Hence the long sleep at the end of main.</p>
<h2 id="systemd-file-descriptor-store">systemd file descriptor store </h2>
<p>Typically now we’d create a systemd <code>.service</code> file making sure to enable the File Descriptor store - it doesn’t default. Here we’ll use <code>systemd-run</code>:</p>
<p><code>systemd-run --user --service-type=exec --unit=remains -p FileDescriptorStoreMax=16 ./target/debug/remains</code></p>
<p>Note that here ‘remains’ is the unit name (–unit=) not the binary. Then we treat it like any other systemd service except it’s in the user scope.</p>
<p>It’s output is in <code>journalctl --user -u remains</code>:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>gktest[277943]: Received 0 fds from systemd
gktest[277943]: Creating new store
gktest[277943]: 1
</code></pre><p>Restart it:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>systemctl --user restart remains
</code></pre><p>Now <code>p1.count</code> increases, it survives restart:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>systemd[4357]: Stopping remains.service
systemd[4357]: Stopped remains.service
systemd[4357]: Starting remains.service
systemd[4357]: Started remains.service
gktest[278030]: Received 1 fds from systemd
gktest[278030]: systemd sent us: person1
gktest[278030]: Restoring
gktest[278030]: 2
</code></pre><p>Stop it like this: <code>systemctl --user stop remains</code>.</p>
<p>After that <code>stop</code> the fd is no longer stored. If we <code>start</code> now the count will reset.</p>
<p>systemd 254+ (Fedora 39+) allows us to set <code>FileDescriptorStorePreserve=yes</code> to keep the store alive even when our program is stopped.</p>
<h2 id="improvements">Improvements </h2>
<p>When I have done <a href="https://darkcoding.net/software/online-upgrades-in-go/">online upgrades in the past</a> the amount of state that I couldn’t recreate was quite small. I either stored that state in Redis or wrote it to a temporary file, as a single serialized object. Hence the systemd allocator above can only allocate once, hopefully that’s all we’d need.</p>
<p>To make it work with multiple objects ideally we could estimate up-front how much space we might need, and size the file and mmap space on first call. This is helpful if all we want is a couple of <code>String</code> or a <code>Vec</code> in we persistent object. The objects could go sequentially in the file, we’d maintain an index of their positions. An mmap can grow (<code>mremap</code> syscall) but there’s no guarantee that there is space to grow into.</p>
<p>If estimating size up-front is not possible we’d need to add a new file whenever the current one can no longer grow. systemd’s <code>FileDescriptorStoreMax</code> will need to be set large enough, and each file will need a unique string passed to <code>sd_pid_notify_with_fds</code>’s <code>FDNAME</code>. A global index points to the file, and each file has an index of offsets to the ojects. And now we’re writing a real memory allocator.</p>
<p>Instead of packing the objects we could make an allocator factory (the design pattern) and have each allocator deal with a single object in a single file. Simpler, but only suitable if we have a limited number of objects.</p>
<p>A fun exercise is to change the allocator to be backed by a disk file. The bytes on disk will be exactly how the object is laid out in memory.</p>
<h2 id="clone-and-pin-notes">Clone and Pin notes </h2>
<p>Let’s go back to this allocation:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>    let mut p1: Box&lt;Person, SystemdAlloc&gt; = salloc.into_box(Person::default())?;
</code></pre><p>If we call this <code>let p2 = p1.clone()</code> (after adding <code>#[derive(Clone)]</code> to <code>Person</code>) the Box isn’t cloned but dereferenced. <code>clone</code> is called directly on <code>Person</code>. We end up with a new Person object on the stack. No problems there.</p>
<p>If instead we do <code>let p2 = Box::clone(p1)</code> the box itself is cloned. A <code>Box</code> internally is a tuple of a pointer and an allocator. We would need to <code>#[derive(Clone)]</code> on <code>SystemdAlloc</code> for it to compile, but that’s just where our problems will start. Rust will clone the allocator and call allocate on it. Our allocator is only designed for single use. See the previous section for notes on that.</p>
<p><code>Pin</code> and async contexts in general are not something an allocator needs to worry about. The object in the allocation might change (e.g. with <code>std::mem::swap</code>) but we are only concerned with the allocation itself, not with what’s inside it. As cliched programmers, we care about the <code>Box</code>, not the <code>Person</code> :-)</p>
<p>Happy allocating!</p>

I retired a year and a half ago, and many of the people I worked with have also left. Justin Garrison hasn’t even left yet, and he just wrote a critical blog post “<a href="https://justingarrison.com/blog/2023-12-30-amazons-silent-sacking/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">Amazon’s Silent Sacking</a>” about the way they are pushing people out. What changed?</p><p id="d3de">Growth slowed. When companies transition from high growth to slow growth or begin shrinking it isn’t just a small change, it needs a fundamentally different approach to management and the culture of the company. I saw this play out while I was at Sun Microsystems as the dot com bubble burst in 2001–2004. Adding headcount and budget every year covers up all kind of problems, it brings a flexibility to operations that becomes part of the culture. When growth is flat to shrinking companies freeze like deer in the headlights, and to make it worse managers start to hoard headcount and play politics to preserve their products. Innovation goes away, micromanagement appears and everyone gets less useful work done. I haven’t seen a good way to gradually manage this situation. The most successful approaches I’ve seen (which Sun didn’t do) are to cut deeply and early by shutting down entire product lines and removing layers of management, so that the company can grow back by opening headcount again. It’s like pruning a sickly tree. If you cut off the dead leaves one by one, you end up with too many branches and shriveled fruit. If you cut back hard, and remove whole branches, the roots provide enough energy for the tree to grow back. This does mean that you have to shut down or sell off entire product lines, and shrink the business. It’s very hard to contemplate and navigate this, which is why most companies don’t do it agressively enough. As an employee, it’s usually best to leave in the first wave of cuts.</p><p id="a158">In the unlikely event that a deep pruning and grow back strategy is happening at your company, and you are still there, the product teams that are left after pruning should try to keep the most experienced employees, lay off the junior ones, and return managers to individual contributor positions where possible. Experienced employees have been through this before, make better judgement calls under stress, and communicate better. There is a tendency to micromanage and add process overhead that needs to be resisted. Simplify processes to <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Delicate-Art-Bureaucracy-Transformation-Wrestler/dp/1950508153" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">reduce bureaucracy</a> and management overhead, speed up time-to-value, and take advantage of the gaps in the market that appear as competitors fail.</p><p id="c50c">Founder led companies often have problems maintaining their innovation culture when the founder moves on. I think this is part of the problem at Amazon, and I was happy to be leaving as Andy Jassy took over from Jeff Bezos and Adam Selipsky took over AWS. Jeff Bezos was always focused on keeping the “Day 1” culture at Amazon, and everyone I talk to there is clear that it’s now “Day 2”. Politics and micromanagement have taken over, and HR processes take up far too much of everyone’s time.</p><p id="977f">There’s another red flag for me when large real estate construction projects take up too much management attention. The plans for Amazon HQ2, and the building of ever larger and fancier office tower blocks in Seattle by Amazon collided with Covid, lockdown and an accelerated work from home movement. The right thing to do coming out of lockdown would have been to write down the real estate investment in one go, re-negotiate the tax incentives that cities provide, embrace remote working, and continue the policy Amazon had at the time, where each director level leader could decide what was best for their teams. Instead, we now have the situation that Amazon management care more about real estate than product. Where is the customer obsession in that? Customers don’t care what the companies buildings are like. As Justin says, they are using Return To Office (RTO) to drive people out of the company without needing to fire them. By analogy, pruning by cutting off the best remaining leaves and fruit buds one at a time, leaving the dead wood behind.</p><p id="674e">[Update] Since posting this I’ve had private messages from people at Amazon thanking me for saying what they aren’t allowed to say internally. “Disagree and commit” has been weaponized to force the RTO policy on everyone. In a group making a decision, it’s usually a majority that agree with the decision, and the people that don’t agree see that they are outnumbered and commit to it. However with RTO I think it is a minority imposing an unpopular policy on everyone else, without supporting data or discussion. Disagreeing is career-limiting, so what we are seeing is “Disagree and quit”. People are interviewing while waiting for their next RSU grant. Someone also said that it’s not “Day 2” it’s “Day 3”, and did I know anywhere that is hiring?.</p><p id="76f2">In summary, I don’t think the situation for Amazon is as bad as it was for Sun in 2002, and in the short term they are going to continue to grow the business slowly. However I do think there’s lessons to be learned, and that the delusion that they can roll back work from home and enforce RTO without killing off innovation is a big problem that will increasingly hurt them over time. I personally hired a bunch of people into AWS, in my own team and by encouraging people to join elsewhere. Nowadays I’d say a hard no to anyone thinking of working there, they have shown that you can’t trust whatever they say during the interview process. Local management gets overruled to relocate people hired to be remote, and to move to locations that they can change arbitrarily. Try and get a job at somewhere growing rapidly with a sensible work location policy like NVIDIA instead.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  
  <p><span>&nbsp;Published on 15 Dec 2023 ·
    &nbsp;Filed in <a href="https://blog.scottlowe.org/categories/explanation">Explanation</a> ·
    &nbsp;304 words (estimated 2 minutes to read)</span></p><p>Building on the earlier article on <a href="https://blog.scottlowe.org/2023/12/11/automatically-transforming-git-urls/">automatically transforming Git URLs</a>, I’m back with another article on a (potentially powerful) feature of <a href="https://www.git-scm.com/">Git</a>—the ability to conditionally include Git configuration files. This means you can configure Git to be configured (and behave) differently based on certain conditions, simply by including or not including Git configuration files. Let’s look at a pretty straightforward example taken from my own workflow.</p>
<p>Here’s a configuration stanza from my own system-wide Git configuration:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="toml"><span><span>[<span>includeIf</span> <span>"gitdir:~/Work/Code/Repos/"</span>]
</span></span><span><span>    <span>path</span> = <span>~/</span><span>Work</span><span>/</span><span>Code</span><span>/</span><span>Repos</span><span>/</span>.<span>gitconfig</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>The key here is the <code>includeIf</code> keyword. In this case, Git will include the referenced configuration file specified by <code>path</code>, <em>if</em> the location of the Git repository matches the path specification after <code>gitdir</code>. Basically, what this means is that <em>all</em> repositories under <code>~/Work/Code/Repos</code> will trigger the inclusion of the additional configuration file.</p>
<p>Here’s the additional configuration file:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="toml"><span><span>[<span>user</span>]
</span></span><span><span>    <span>email</span> = <span>name</span><span>@</span><span>work-domain</span>.<span>com</span>
</span></span><span><span>    <span>name</span> = <span>Scott</span> <span>Lowe</span>
</span></span><span><span>[<span>commit</span>]
</span></span><span><span>    <span>gpgsign</span> = <span>false</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>As long as I group all work-relatd repositories in the specified directory path, these values override the system-wide values. This means I can specify my work e-mail address as the e-mail address to be associated with commits to work-related repositories while all others use a different e-mail address. This configuration also allows me to disable GPG signing of commits for work-related repositories (i.e., repositories in the specified path), since I don’t have a GPG key associated with my work e-mail address.</p>
<p>Could you do this with per-repository configuration settings? <em>Absolutely.</em> This configuration mechanism allows you to apply configuration settings to groups of repositories based on their filesystem location, instead of having to do the same thing on a per-repository basis.</p>

                            <p><a href="http://netflix.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Netflix</a> was founded in the US in 1997, starting initially as a DVD-rental delivery service before finally morphing into more of a VoD streaming service. Today, it serves the US and Canada, Latin America, the Caribbean, and, as of January this year, the <a href="https://thenextweb.com/news/netflix-arrives-in-the-uk-at-5-99-per-month-launches-with-one-month-free-trial" target="_blank" rel="noopener">UK and Ireland</a>, where it finally arrived to exchange blows with LoveFilm.</p>
<p>Cast your mind back to when the company launched the <a href="http://www.netflixprize.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Netflix Prize</a>. Announced in 2006, the prize sought to reward clever people for developing a recommendation algorithm. The company offered $1 million to whoever could improve the accuracy of its existing system, Cinematch, by 10%.</p>
<p>On September 21, 2009 <a href="http://www.netflixprize.com/community/viewtopic.php?id=1537" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">the mammoth prize was given</a> to team <em>BellKor’s Pragmatic Chaos</em>, who produced an algorithm which apparently <a href="http://www.netflixprize.com//leaderboard" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">improved the search by 10.06%</a>.</p>

<h3>Whatever happened to that $1m algorithm?</h3>

Indeed, by the time the algorithm was good to go, Netflix as a business had moved on.</p>
<p>Whilst they acknowledge that the work that went into the final product was immense, Xavier Amatriain and Justin Basilico, Personalization Science and Engineering at Netflix, say that the engineering effort required to achieve the accuracy gains they measured, wasn’t entirely justified.</p>
<p>“This is a truly impressive compilation and culmination of years of work, blending hundreds of predictive models to finally cross the finish line,” they say. “We evaluated some of the new methods offline but the additional accuracy gains that we measured did not seem to justify the engineering effort needed to bring them into a production environment. Also, our focus on improving Netflix personalization had shifted to the next level by then.”</p>
<p>Basically, streaming changed the way its members interacted with Netflix, as well as the type of data available in its algorithms. “For DVDs our goal is to help people fill their queue with titles to receive in the mail over the coming days and weeks; selection is distant in time from viewing, people select carefully because exchanging a DVD for another takes more than a day, and we get no feedback during viewing,” they say. “For streaming members who are looking for something great to watch right now; they can sample a few videos before settling on one, they can consume several in one session, and we can observe viewing statistics such as whether a video was watched fully or only partially.”</p>
<p>But this is an interesting point, in that it highlights the differences between ‘watch now’ and ‘watch later’ behaviours. As TechDirt’s Masnick <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/blog/innovation/articles/20120409/03412518422/why-netflix-never-implemented-algorithm-that-won-netflix-1-million-challenge.shtml" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">says</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>“I also find it interesting that there’s a clear distinction in the kinds of recommendations people that work if people are going to ‘watch now’ vs. ‘watch in the future’.</p>
<p>I think this is an issue that Netflix probably has faced on the DVD side for years: when people rent a movie that won’t arrive for a few days, they’re making a bet on what they want at some future point. And, people tend to have a more… optimistic viewpoint of their future selves. That is, they may be willing to rent, say, an “artsy” movie that won’t show up for a few days, feeling that they’ll be in the mood to watch it a few days (weeks?) in the future, knowing they’re not in the mood immediately.</p>
<p>But when the choice is immediate, they deal with their present selves, and that choice can be quite different. It would be great if Netflix revealed a bit more about those differences, but it is already interesting to see that the shift from delayed gratification to instant gratification clearly makes a difference in the kinds of recommendations that work for people.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Netflix also says that another big change to come about was the move from a single platform onto hundreds of devices, for example when it integrated with Roku and Xbox in 2008, which was already a couple of years into the competition. Then Netflix streaming made it to the iPhone, before hitting Android and range of other connected devices. In short, a one-algorithm approach clearly won’t work across such a wide range of platforms.</p>
<p>It’s also worth noting the global availability of Netflix. It’s now extended beyond the US and in to Canada, 43 Latin-American countries plus the UK and Ireland. It has 23 million subscribers in 47 countries, who streamed 2 billion hours from multiple devices in Q4 2011 alone. Every day 2 million movies and TV shows are queued, and 4 million ratings are generated. So how does personalization cope with such a massive multifaceted jump in usage?</p>
<p>“We have adapted our personalization algorithms to this new scenario in such a way that now 75% of what people watch is from some sort of recommendation,” says Netflix. “We reached this point by continuously optimizing the member experience and have measured significant gains in member satisfaction whenever we improved the personalization for our members.”</p>
<p>Well, $1m may sound like a lot of money for Netflix to pay for something that wasn’t really used, but we’re sure Bob Bell, Martin Chabbert, Michael Jahrer, Yehuda Koren, Martin Piotte, Andreas Töscher and Chris Volinsky from <em>BellKor’s Pragmatic Chaos</em> don’t mind too much.</p>

            <strong>TL;DR</strong> –&nbsp;we finally have a way to create
            <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/custom-elements.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">our own HTML elements</a>
            and use them in any framework we want!
          </p>
          <p>
            Thanks to the popularity of frameworks such as Angular, Vue, and React, component-driven development has
            become a part of our every day lives. Components help us encapsulate styles and behaviors into reusable
            building blocks. They make a lot of sense in terms of design, development, and testing.
          </p>
          <p>Unfortunately, <em>framework-specific</em> components fail us in a number of ways:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>You can only use them in the framework they’re designed for 🔒</li>
            <li>Their lifespan is limited to that of the framework’s ⏳</li>
            <li>
              New frameworks/versions can lead to breaking changes, requiring substantial effort to update components 😭
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Web components solve these problems. They’re
            <a href="https://caniuse.com/#feat=custom-elementsv1" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">supported by all modern browsers</a>, they’re framework-agnostic, and they’re
            <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">part of the standard</a>, so we know they’ll be supported for many years to come.
          </p>
          <p>This is the technology that Shoelace is built on.</p>

            Shoelace provides a collection of professionally designed, highly customizable UI components built on a
            framework agnostic technology. Why spend hundreds of hours (or more) building a design system from scratch?
            Why make a component library that only works with one framework?
          </p>
          <p>With Shoelace, you can:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Start building things faster (no need to roll your own buttons)</li>
            <li>Build multiple apps with different frameworks that all share the same UI components</li>
            <li>Fully customize components to match your existing designs</li>
            <li>Incrementally adopt components as needed (no need to ditch your framework)</li>
            <li>Upgrade or switch frameworks without rebuilding foundational components</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            If your organization is looking to build a design system,
            <a href="https://medium.com/eightshapes-llc/and-you-thought-buttons-were-easy-26eb5b5c1871" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Shoelace will save you thousands of dollars</a>. All the foundational components you need are right here, ready to be customized for your brand. And since
            it’s built on web standards, browsers will continue to support it for many years to come.
          </p>
          <p>
            Whether you use Shoelace as a starting point for your organization’s design system or for a fun personal
            project, there’s no limit to what you can do with it.

            If you need to support IE11 or pre-Chromium Edge, this library isn’t for you. Although web components can
            (to some degree) be polyfilled for legacy browsers, supporting them is outside the scope of this project. If
            you’re using Shoelace in such a browser, you’re gonna have a bad time. ⛷

<p><em>“Software design is preparation for change; change of behavior”</em></p>



<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/171691901-tidy-first">Tidy First?</a> is a new book by Kent Beck. It is a short little book, only about 100 pages (and lots of white space on them), but it contains some deep insights about software development. The book has three parts, going from concrete to abstract. First there is a list of 15 <em>tidyings</em>, which are small refactorings. The next part, <em>Managing</em>, discusses how and when to perform the tidyings. The final part, <em>Theory</em>, presents a great framework for how to think about software development, using the concepts of <em>time value of money</em> and <em>optionality</em>.</p>

<p>The author, Kent Beck, is of course the creator of extreme programming (XP). As <a href="https://henrikwarne.com/2020/04/27/20-5-years-of-xp-and-agile/">I have written before</a>, his article in 1999, presenting XP, gave me the biggest productivity boost of my entire career as a software developer. Even though this is a very short book, it contains a lot of wisdom. It is worth reading slowly, to really digest the content.</p>



<p>A key idea in the book is that before you implement a behavior change (B) in the code, it may be beneficial to first perform one or more structural changes (S). These changes do not alter the program behavior, and are almost trivially simple. These changes are called tidyings. The idea is that by doing these tidyings, the behavior change will be easier to implement.</p>



<h3>Tidyings</h3>



<p>There are 15 tidyings, and they are presented in very short, almost tweet-like, chapters.</p>



<h4>Tidyings I Like the Most:</h4>



<p><strong>Guard clause</strong> – exit a function early if certain conditions are not met. This makes the rest of the function easier to write (no nested if-statements). <strong>Normalize symmetries</strong> – the same logic should be expressed in the same way everywhere it appears, since it makes reading the code easier.</p>



<p>I have noticed that many developers are reluctant to introduce <strong>explaining variables/constants</strong>. The idea here is to extract a subexpression into a variable named after the intention of the expression – typically done after reading the code and realizing what some part of it means. In the author’s words: <em>“In this tidying, you are taking your hard-won understanding and putting it back into the code”</em>.</p>



<p><strong>New interface, old implementation</strong>. If the design was like this, it would be easier to make the change. So create that new interface, and in it delegate to the old interface (for now). I really like this way of thinking, and I am using it often: first I assume I have a function that does XXX, and using that makes the solution easier. Then I create the function that does XXX. In a way it is working backwards – first assuming you have something available, and later implementing it. </p>



<p>The simplest tidying of them all is <strong>chunk statements</strong>, which just means using blank lines to indicate which parts of code are closely related, and which parts a separate. An underestimated practice, even though sometimes it can be hard to know how to chunk things. Too many blank lines can also mean you fit less code on your screen, so it needs to be balanced. <strong>Extract helper</strong> is another underused technique. Like explaining variable, it lets you name a part of the logic. <em>“Interfaces become tools for thinking about problems”</em>. </p>



<p>One tidying that I don’t think I have used before is <strong>one pile</strong>. Normally, tidyings will divide the code up in parts, where each part can be understood in isolation. However, sometimes the way the code is divided can hinder understanding. In this case, bringing it all together in one place can be a way to understand it better. Then it can be subdivided (in a new, easier to understand, way).</p>



<p><strong>Explaining comments/delete redundant comments</strong>. When needed, <a href="https://henrikwarne.com/2021/06/15/on-comments-in-code/">I am all for adding a comment</a> with extra information that is not obvious from the code. Also, if the comment says exactly what the code does, delete the comment (there is a good example in the book how this can happen when tidying).</p>



<h4>Other Tidyings:</h4>



<p>Delete <strong>dead code</strong> – this should be easy, but I often see either dead code, or commented out code, still left in code bases. <strong>Reading order</strong> – put the code in the file in the order that makes the most sense when reading it. This advice is less important in the age of IDEs, where navigating in and out of functions is very easy. Still, keeping functions in a good order doesn’t hurt. It is also similar to <strong>cohesion order</strong> – keeping elements that change together close to each other. There is a similar theme for <strong>move declaration and initialization together</strong> – keep related things together.</p>



<p>If the arguments to a function are in the form of a map/dict, then use <strong>explicit parameters</strong> to make clear what the inputs are.</p>



<p>For many of these, the best way may be to try them and see if the resulting code is better than before. If not, undo the change. Many times I have been too reluctant to make a change to see how it looks (somehow it feels like wasted effort). But I have come to realize that actually seeing the changed code (not just contemplating it) is the best way of evaluating the change.</p>



<h3>Managing</h3>



<p>Each individual tidying is very simple. They only change the structure of the code, never the behavior. Even chaining several tidyings together will result in a change that is easy to understand, and easy to undo if necessary. Sometimes the behavior change will be easier if we tidy first, then implement the change. In other cases, it is better to make the structural changes later, or not at all. This is the reason there is a question mark in the book title. Regardless, structural and behavioral changes should be kept in separate PRs (or at least in separate commits).</p>



<p>In many work places, there are high fixed costs (in time and effort) associated with PR reviews. The ideal solution for this, according to the author, is to not require PR reviews for only tidyings. If this is not feasible, then at least keep the changes in separate commits. </p>



<p>A problem I often encounter is that once you start making behavior changes, you see structural changes that should be done. This results in a mix of B and S changes. Separating them out can be hard. There is a good discussion on how to handle this in the chapter <em>Getting Untangled</em>. Either you ship it as it is (tangled), or you untangle the different changes (I have been doing this using git’s interactive rebase), or you discard all the changes and re-implement the changes. The last option sounds a bit crazy, but the author thinks that this may lead to even better code in the end.</p>



<h3>Theory</h3>



<h4>Beneficially Relating Elements</h4>



<p>Software design is <em>beneficially relating elements</em>. On one extreme there is a single gigantic soup of tiny subelements, for example assembly code with a global namespace. Even though such a program can work and produce the correct output, it would be virtually impossible to modify. The key then is to structure the program to make it understandable and changeable. This is done by creating and deleting elements, and creating and deleting relationships between the elements in a way that aids the overall understandability (this is the <em>beneficially</em> part).</p>



<h4>Time Value of Money, Optionality</h4>



<p>How do we balance keeping the program well-structured with the need to add behavior? Now we get to perhaps my favorite part of the book – relating software development to the concepts of <em>time value of money</em> and <em>optionality</em>. These are in tension with each other, and explain the question mark in the title.</p>



<p>The time value of money simply means that a dollar today is worth more than a dollar tomorrow. Therefore, getting features out quickly, so you can start earning money earlier, is imperative. So don’t tidy first.</p>



<p>However, software creates value in two ways: what it does today, but also in what it <em>could </em>do tomorrow. As noted in the book: <em>“The mere presence of a system behaving a certain way changes the desire for how the system should behave”</em>. This explains why software is never done – using a system makes you continually see new usages for it. Just like options in finance have value even before they are exercised, so do options in software. The options in this case is the structuring of the code that enables quick changes. Tidyings improve the structure, thus creating more, and more valuable, options. Therefore you should tidy first.</p>



<p>Because of this tension between the cases, you have to find a balance for when, and how much, to tidy.</p>



<h4>Coupling</h4>



<p>The key reason a program is expensive to change is that changing one element requires changing other elements (because the elements are coupled with respect to that change). Changing the other elements can in turn necessitate more changes, i.e. cascading changes. Therefore, reducing coupling will reduce the cost of change.</p>



<p><strong>Constantine’s Equivalence</strong> states that the cost of software is roughly equal to the cost of changing it. This cost of change is dominated by the cost of the big, cascading changes. Therefore, the cost of software is approximately equal to the coupling.</p>



<h3>To Keep in Mind</h3>



<p>Here are the key lessons from the book that I want to keep in mind when developing software:</p>



<ul>
<li>What structural change(s) (S) will make the next behavioral change (B) easier to implement?</li>



<li>Keep S and B in separate commits (or even separate PRs).</li>



<li>Create future behavior options by keeping a structure that supports change.</li>



<li>Constantine’s Equivalence: cost(software) ~= coupling</li>
</ul>



<h3>Conclusion</h3>



<p>There is a lot to like about this book. It has many concrete code tidyings you can put to use right away. It also has interesting discussions on how and when to perform them, as well as models to help you think about the tradeoffs present. Throughout the text there are numerous indications that the author has long practical experience, and has thought long and hard about software development.</p>



<p>This book is focused on the individual developer, and is the first in a series of three books. The next book will be about teams of software developers, and the third book will be about the cooperation between developers and non-developers. I really enjoyed Tidy First?, and I am looking forward to reading the next books in the series.</p>

<p>As you lose weight, several adaptations take place in the body to reduce your daily energy expenditure.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For example, a smaller body burns fewer calories than a larger body. Thus, it takes less energy to maintain your weight at the end of a diet than when you began the diet. A smaller body also means you burn fewer calories when exercising and moving around. If you’re in a caloric deficit, you’re eating fewer calories by default, which means less energy is used to digest and store the foods you eat.</p>



<p>So you might start the diet expending 2500 kcals/day, but by the time you end the diet, due to all the mechanisms mentioned above, your daily expenditure might have dropped to 2100 kcals/day.</p>

<p>These adaptations are collectively called ‘metabolic adaptation’, and it’s totally normal and to be expected. After all, the body is just doing its job by trying to save you from what it thinks is impending starvation.</p>



<p>But once you end the diet and transition from a caloric deficit to caloric maintenance, metabolic adaptation is largely reversed. <span title=" Nunes CL et al. 2022 ">1</span></p>



<p>Except in one study.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Not only did the participants experience a staggering amount of metabolic adaptation, but it persisted several years after they’d finished the diet. Since then, this study has become the poster child for metabolic damage––the idea that dieting causes irreversible damage to the metabolism, which makes weight maintenance impossible and sets people up to regain weight.</p>



<p>Recently, Kevin Hall––the lead researcher on the original study––went back and reanalysed the paper and offered a tentative alternative as to why these individuals were experiencing such a massive reduction in their metabolism. Spoiler alert: It likely wasn’t ‘metabolic damage’.</p>



<p>Let’s talk about that.</p>



<h2 id="h-setting-the-scene">Setting the scene</h2>



<p>In 2012, a study investigated the effects of metabolic adaptation on contestants of “The Biggest Loser”––an absolute dumpster fire of reality TV where contestants with obesity engage in several hours of intense exercise and severe caloric restriction to lose as much weight as possible in the hopes of winning a cash prize.<span title=" Johannsen DL et al. 2012 ">2</span></p>



<p>Exercise–especially <a href="https://physiqonomics.com/cardio-or-weights/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">resistance training</a>–can help preserve muscle mass during weight loss, which can mitigate reductions in metabolism and help prevent weight regain. The researchers wanted to determine whether or not this would hold true in the Biggest Loser contestants.</p>



<p>The results showed the contestants did indeed largely <a href="https://physiqonomics.com/preventing-muscle-loss/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">preserve their muscle mass</a>, with most of the weight loss coming from body fat.</p>

<p>Yet, despite the contestants managing to hold onto most of their muscles, their <a href="https://physiqonomics.com/slow-metabolism/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">metabolism</a> took a massive hit. By the end of the 30-week competition, their metabolism had dropped by a whopping 789 (± 483) kcal/d. An amount that was ~500 kcal/d greater than it should have been based on the change in body composition.&nbsp;</p>

In the case of the Biggest Losers, their predicted energy expenditure was 2393 kcals/day but their measured energy expenditure was 1890 kcals/day; thus, metabolic adaptation amounted to 504 kcals/day.</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Just to contextualise this: Up until this study was published, the consensus was metabolic adaptation did occur but was fairly small (3-5%). The Biggest Loser contestants’ metabolism had adapted closer to 20%. <span title=" Astrup A et al. 1999 ">3</span></p>



<p>While this finding was surprising, it wasn’t <em>that</em> shocking; metabolic rate tends to decrease with weight loss, and the greater-than-expected drop in metabolism experienced by the Biggest Losers was likely just a byproduct of the magnitude of weight lost and the extreme training and nutrition protocol they were following. </p>



<p>Just to illustrate how extreme their weight loss protocol was, Kevin Hall, the senior researcher on the Biggest Loser study, did some mathematical modelling and calculated that, while the contestants were on the show, they averaged a 65% caloric deficit while doing more than three hours of intense exercise every day. <span title=" Hall KD. 2013 ">4</span></p>



<h2>The part where it gets weird</h2>



<p>Fast forward to 2016, and 14 of the original 16 Biggest Loser contestants were brought back into the spotlight as researchers wanted to investigate whether the participants were still experiencing metabolic adaptation. <span title=" Fothergill E et al. 2016 ">5</span></p>



<p>To reiterate the point I made at the start: While some metabolic adaptation does occur during weight loss, it’s largely reversed once you return to maintenance.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But this wasn’t the case for the Biggest Losers, who were still experiencing metabolic adaptation years after the show had ended to the tune of ~500 kcals/d. That is, their metabolism was ~500 kcals lower than it should have been based on the weight that was regained.</p>

<p>This finding led to the notion the Biggest Loser participants had ‘damaged’ their metabolism, and all diets were doomed to fail (despite the fact the contestants maintained, on average, a clinically significant ~12% weight loss).</p>



<h2>Time for a plot twist: Metabolic adaptation <em>wasn’t</em> linked with weight regain</h2>



<p>That wasn’t a typo.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Contrary to the researchers’ hypotheses that participants with the highest degree of metabolic adaptation would be the ones who would regain the most weight, the participants with the highest degree of metabolic adaptation were also the ones who more successfully maintained their weight loss.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>What the hell’s going on here?</h3>



<p>A 2017 study looked at how changes in energy intake and physical activity were related to weight regain in The Biggest Loser competition. <span title=" Kerns JC et al. 2017 ">6</span> It found changes in energy intake were <em>not</em> significantly correlated with the weight regained in the six years after the Biggest Loser competition (Image A below). However, physical activity was “significantly inversely related to weight regained” (Image B below).</p>

<p>If you’re wondering where I’m going with all of this, hang tight; we’re almost at the finish line.</p>



<h2>Metabolic damage or constrained energy?</h2>



<p>Around the same time the initial Biggest Loser study was published, a group of researchers led by anthropologist and evolutionary biologist Herman Pontzer published a study on a topic that, on the surface, didn’t seem related at all.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Pontzer had been studying the Hadza––a modern hunter-gatherer population in Tanzania––when he found something bizarre. Despite the Hadza’s high levels of physical activity, once adjusted for fat-free mass, their daily energy expenditure wasn’t too dissimilar from their more sedentary Western counterparts in the US and Europe. <span title=" Pontzer H et al. 2012 ">7</span></p>



<p>In 2016, Pontzer and colleagues published a study putting forward <a href="https://physiqonomics.com/constrained-energy-model/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the constrained energy model</a>: Energy expenditure does increase with more activity, but only to a point. Once physical activity gets really high, the body will adjust other components of the metabolism to keep your daily energy expenditure within a narrow range. <span title=" Pontzer H et al. 2016 ">8</span></p>

<p><strong>So, could a better explanation for the significant reduction in the Biggest Loser contestants’ metabolic rate be a result of the constrained energy model?&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>Recently, Kevin Hall went back and reinterpreted the Biggest Loser study through the lens of the constrained energy model. He noted the contestants’ physical activity levels remained high six years later, with a median increase of ~80% compared to before the competition. Moreover, those participants who sustained the highest levels of physical activity were also the participants who exhibited the greatest degree of metabolic adaptation.&nbsp;<span title=" Hall KD. 2022 ">9</span></p>

<p>In other words, because these contestants maintained high levels of physical activity, their bodies had decreased other components of their metabolism to keep their daily energy expenditure ‘constrained’ within a narrow range per the constrained energy model.</p>



<p>Now, it’s important to mention Kevin Hall’s reinterpretation wasn’t a randomized controlled trial but speculation based on newer research published on the constrained energy model. That said, it does make more sense than the whole, ‘the participants damaged their metabolism’. Especially when considering the Biggest Loser study is the only study to have reported such an extreme level of metabolic adaptation (and one that’s not been replicated since). The rest of the research––where the weight loss protocols haven’t been this insane––suggests some metabolic adaptation does occur during weight loss, but this largely dissipates once you return to maintenance. <span title=" Nunes CL et al. 2022 ">1</span></p>



<h2>What to make of all of this?</h2>



<p>In this reinterpretation of The Biggest Loser study, it seems the greater-than-expected reduction in the contestants’ resting metabolic rate was likely a result of their bodies constraining energy to account for their high levels of physical activity and not because their metabolism was ‘damaged’.</p>



<p>More importantly, metabolic adaptation doesn’t make weight loss impossible, nor does it mean you’re doomed to regain weight. The Biggest Losers saw their metabolic rate tank by over 700 kcals, yet they all lost a serious amount of weight. Additionally, the follow-up study found those who experienced the most metabolic adaptation were also the ones who maintained the most weight loss.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>But we need to keep this study in context</h3>



<p>This was one study done in a very specific population that was engaging in methods of weight loss that, let’s be honest, aren’t practical for any normal person to adhere to. Do you think you can stick to a 65% calorie deficit and engage in several hours of exercise every day for over half a year?</p>



<p>Yeah, didn’t think so.</p>



<p>For everyone else, metabolic adaptation is par for the course when dieting and will largely dissipate as you return to maintenance. And even if some metabolic adaptation does hang around, the real question is: Does it occur to a degree that would meaningfully impact your progress? The research so far would lean towards no.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Metabolic adaptation might result in less weight loss than anticipated <span title=" Martins C et al. 2021 ">10</span> or slightly stretch the timeline to your goal. <span title=" Martins C et al. 2022 ">11</span> But neither of these things will prevent you from losing weight.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This reality underscores two important truths. First, you’re not going to lose weight linearly, and sooner or later, you’ll need to make adjustments to your diet to overcome the metabolism adapting to weight loss. Second, accepting the fact you might well need to eat fewer calories than you <em>think</em> you should be in comparison to someone of the same height, weight, and sex. I’m not going to sit here and act like this doesn’t suck or that it won’t make weight loss a bit more challenging for some, but unfortunately, it is what it is.</p>



<p>Taking all of this together, it’s no surprise then that studies have consistently demonstrated metabolic adaptation isn’t a major roadblock to maintaining weight loss, nor is it the weight gain boogeyman it’s made out to be. <span title=" Martins C et al. 2020 ">12</span></p>



<h2>An important, yet often missed lesson from the Biggest Loser study</h2>



<p>With all of the buzz that ‘metabolic damage’ generates, the more pertinent lesson from the Biggest Loser study tends to get glossed over (aside from Hey, maybe don’t do dumb shit to lose weight): The importance of physical activity for long-term weight maintenance. And it can’t be understated. To quote from a recent systematic review: “Increased physical activity was the most consistent positive correlate of weight loss maintenance.” <span title=" Paixão C et al. 2020 ">13</span></p>



<p>There are several reasons why exercise can help with weight maintenance, but an idea gaining traction over the past few years is ‘energy flux’.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At the end of a diet, you can approach weight maintenance in two ways:</p>



<ol>
<li>You can eat less (compared to what you were eating before the weight loss) paired with low levels of physical activity, known as a ‘low-flux state.’</li>



<li>You can eat slightly more paired with higher levels of physical activity, i.e. a ‘high-flux state.’</li>
</ol>



<p>While both states lead to energy balance, a high-flux state can help mitigate weight regain due to better regulation of appetite and closing the ‘energy gap’––the difference in energy requirements before and after weight loss. <span title=" Melby CL et al. 2019 ">14</span></p>

<p>For example, a 2018 review noted the relationship between physical activity and energy intake being J-shaped: Appetite is dysregulated at low levels of physical activity, creating a mismatch between the energy expended and the amount of food consumed, leading to weight gain. On the other hand, as physical activity increases, so too does satiety signalling, which reduces the amount of food consumed.&nbsp;<span title=" Beaulieu K et al. 2018 ">15</span></p>

<p>This is all fine and dandy. But there’s something that’s probably been gnawing at you as you’ve been reading the last few paragraphs: Won’t the constrained energy model render any increases in physical activity moot?</p>



<p>No, because that isn’t what the constrained energy model suggests. As I mentioned above, the constrained energy model states that physical activity <em>does</em> increase energy expenditure, but after a point, the increase isn’t linear.</p>



<p>For example, Careau and colleagues found energy compensation averaged 28%, with a lot of variance around the mean; leaner individuals experienced less compensation (29.7%), while individuals with more body fat experienced more compensation (45.7%). <span title=" Careau V et al. 2021 ">16</span> So, while some people will experience more compensation than others, any increase in expenditure isn’t wholly negated.</p>







<p>A few years back, I was having a conversation with a friend about metabolic adaptation, and he quipped, “People worry so much about metabolic adaptation, but nobody talks about behavioural adaptation.”</p>



<p>He’s right.</p>



<p>The behaviours and habits you adopt are going to have a far greater impact on your ability to both make and maintain your progress than some transient adaptations that occur during weight loss.</p>



<p>Here’s an example of what I mean. In a recent study, metabolic adaptation was present after participants had lost 5% of their baseline weight (-85 kcals/d), and it persisted after a subsequent 8-month weight maintenance period (-72 kcals/d). <span title=" Nunes CL et al. 2022 ">17</span></p>



<p>But here’s the interesting bit: The researchers found participants slightly decreased their sedentary time and increased the amount of physical activity during the 4-month weight-loss period. But by the end of the study (12-month mark), the participants increased their sedentary time, and their physical activity levels dropped back to baseline. As the researchers write:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The lack of a successful WL [weight loss] and its maintenance may be mostly due to behavioral issues, such as increasing food intake and/or decreasing physical activity.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>And isn’t this what we see in the real world?</p>



<p>Someone starts a fad diet and does <em>all the things</em> for a few weeks or months, and as soon as the diet ends, they go right back to their old behaviours and gain back the weight.</p>



<p>Here’s the thing: People wrongly assume maintenance is this thing that happens after the diet ends. But maintenance begins on day <em>one</em> of your diet. The same habits and behaviours that will help you lose weight are the same habits and behaviours that will help you maintain your weight. Notably:</p>



<ul>
<li>Eat a majority whole food nutrient-rich diet with adequate protein.</li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li>Don’t unnecessarily restrict foods you enjoy, but learn how to make these foods a part of your eating plan.</li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li>Try to get in movement throughout the day and be as physically active as is feasible for you.</li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li>Focus on strength training to build and <a href="https://physiqonomics.com/preventing-muscle-loss/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">maintain muscle</a>​.</li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li>Monitor your progress in some capacity.</li>
</ul>



<p>To slightly amend a popular quote: Genetics load the gun, but your habits and behaviours pull the trigger.</p>



<p>Instead of worrying about things largely out of your control (like metabolic adaptation), be more concerned about the things you can control (see above) because these are the things that will help you make and later maintain progress.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/energy-storage/a-huge-battery-has-replaced-hawaiis-last-coal-plant">https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/energy-storage/a-huge-battery-has-replaced-hawaiis-last-coal-plant</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38941747">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p dir="ltr">Hawaiian Electric’s modeling suggests it can reduce curtailment of renewables by an estimated <span>69</span>% for the first five years thanks to Kapolei Energy Storage, allowing surplus clean electricity that would otherwise go to waste to get onto the&nbsp;grid.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The utility also requested <span></span>​<span>“</span>black-start capability.” If a&nbsp;disaster, like a&nbsp;cyclone or earthquake, knocks out the grid completely, Hawaiian Electric needs a&nbsp;power source to restart it. The Kapolei batteries are programmed to hold some energy in reserve for that purpose. Plus Power located the project near a&nbsp;substation connected to three other power plants so the battery <span></span>​<span>“</span>can be <span>AAA</span> to jump-start those other plants,” Keefe&nbsp;said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The combination of all these abilities in one site — capacity, grid services, black start — leads Keefe to call Kapolei <span></span>​<span>“</span>the most advanced battery energy storage facility on the planet.”</p>
<h2><strong>Model for a&nbsp;reliable clean-energy grid</strong></h2>
<p dir="ltr">The new battery is just the latest dispatch from Hawaii’s long-held spot at the vanguard of the energy transition. This is the state that hit mass rooftop solar adoption first and crafted the <a href="https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/clean-energy/kauai-is-a-clean-energy-leader-its-secret-a-publicly-owned-grid">first utility-scale solar-battery plant</a> in Kauai (not coincidentally, Plus Power <span>CCO</span> Bob Rudd had a&nbsp;hand in that project during his tenure at&nbsp;Tesla).</p>
<p dir="ltr">But when renewables growth and fossil-plant retirements pass a&nbsp;certain threshold, as they have in Hawaii, simply adding more wind, solar or batteries isn’t sufficient. The clean technologies, which run on digitally controlled inverters, have to start maintaining the grid, not just feeding it.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Plenty of other batteries provide frequency services to other grids, and a&nbsp;few of them are larger than Kapolei. But this is the only large-scale battery that we’ve seen capable of combining the basic peak capacity, frequency response, synthetic inertia and grid-rebooting tasks. That’s because Kapolei plays a&nbsp;more central role in its grid than battery plants do elsewhere.</p>
<p dir="ltr">After years of construction, California’s grid battery fleet <a href="https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/batteries/chart-the-remarkable-rise-of-californias-grid-battery-capacity#">surpassed <span>5</span>,<span>000</span>&nbsp;megawatts installed</a> last year, but that only equates to <span>7</span>.<span>6</span>% of the mammoth nameplate capacity of the state’s grid. Kapolei alone constitutes about <span>17</span>% of Oahu’s peak capacity. Hawaiian Electric needed it to take on more responsibility than batteries elsewhere have ever had&nbsp;to.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Take <a href="https://www.nrel.gov/news/program/2020/inertia-and-the-power-grid-a-guide-without-the-spin.html">inertia</a>, which stabilizes grid frequency, as one example. Old plants provide this passively, through the spinning mass of their turbines; inertia didn’t need to be defined and compensated for separately in bygone decades because it was part of the package of running a&nbsp;power plant.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Now, across the country, the grid is moving to a&nbsp;model of maximizing cheap renewables when they are available and burning fuel when renewables aren’t. But the thermal plants need to be spinning to provide inertia — sometimes, on the mainland, renewables get curtailed to keep old coal plants running so they can deliver these grid services, Keefe said. This can be a&nbsp;bad deal for electricity customers, not to mention the climate.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Advanced batteries provide a&nbsp;synthetic version of this inertia through savvy programming of their inverters. This offers a&nbsp;more economic alternative while avoiding unnecessary carbon emissions. They also are faster and more precise — Keefe likened the Kapolei battery to a&nbsp;zippy electric sports car compared to the lumbering diesel bus of old thermal plants. That makes batteries a&nbsp;good technical fit for grids that are becoming increasingly volatile due to the fluctuations of renewable production.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Longer-term, U.S. climate goals require a&nbsp;phaseout of fossil fuels from the electric grid. Hydropower and nuclear plants help deliver valuable grid inertia without carbon emissions, but they aren’t on track to&nbsp;grow.</p>
<p dir="ltr">That’s why this project matters to the clean energy shift everywhere: It’s one of the first real-life examples of how to shift critical grid functions from fossil-fueled plants to clean energy plants. And eventually, the kind of grid services Kapolei has pioneered will have to scale nationwide.<br></p>

<p><span>A small group</span> of volunteers from Israel’s tech sector is working tirelessly to remove content it says doesn’t belong on platforms like Facebook and TikTok, tapping personal connections at those and other Big Tech companies to have posts deleted outside official channels, the project’s founder told The Intercept.</p>



<p>The project’s moniker, “Iron Truth,” echoes the Israeli military’s vaunted Iron Dome rocket interception system. The brainchild of Dani Kaganovitch, a Tel Aviv-based software engineer at Google, Iron Truth claims its tech industry back channels have led to the removal of roughly 1,000 posts tagged by its members as false, antisemitic, or “pro-terrorist” across platforms such as X, YouTube, and TikTok.</p>



<p>In an interview, Kaganovitch said he launched the project after the October 7 Hamas attack, when he saw a Facebook video that cast doubt on alleged Hamas atrocities. “It had some elements of disinformation,” he told The Intercept. “The person who made the video said there were no beheaded babies, no women were raped, 200 bodies is a fake. As I saw this video, I was very pissed off. I copied the URL of the video and sent it to a team in [Facebook parent company] Meta, some Israelis that work for Meta, and I told them that this video needs to be removed and actually they removed it after a few days.”</p>



<p>Billed as both a fight against falsehood and a “fight for public opinion,” according to a post announcing the project on Kaganovitch’s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20231209002510/https://www.linkedin.com/posts/dannykg_israel-hamas-hamasisis-activity-7119952867225985024-nzuV/">LinkedIn profile</a>, Iron Truth vividly illustrates the perils and pitfalls of terms like “misinformation” and “disinformation” in wartime, as well as the mission creep they enable. The project’s public face is <a href="https://t.me/IronTruthBot">a Telegram bot</a> that crowdsources reports of “inflammatory” posts, which Iron Truth’s organizers then forward to sympathetic insiders. “We have direct channels with Israelis who work in the big companies,” Kaganovitch said in an October 13 message to the Iron Truth Telegram group. “There are compassionate ones who take care of a quick removal.” The Intercept used Telegram’s built-in translation feature to review the Hebrew-language chat transcripts.</p>

<p>So far, nearly 2,000 participants have flagged a wide variety of posts for removal, from content that’s clearly racist or false to posts that are merely critical of Israel or sympathetic to Palestinians, according to chat logs reviewed by The Intercept. “In the U.S. there is free speech,” Kaganovitch explained. “Anyone can say anything with disinformation. This is very dangerous, we can see now.”</p>



<p>“The interests of a fact checking or counter-disinformation group working in the context of a war belongs to one belligerent or another. Their job is to look out for the interests of their side,” explained Emerson Brooking, a fellow with the Atlantic Council’s Digital Forensic Research Lab. “They’re not trying to ensure an open, secure, accessible online space for all, free from disinformation. They’re trying to target and remove information and disinformation that they see as harmful or dangerous to Israelis.”</p>



<p>While Iron Truth appears to have frequently conflated criticism or even mere discussion of Israeli state violence with misinformation or antisemitism, Kaganovitch says his views on this are evolving. “In the beginning of the war, it was anger, most of the reporting was anger,” he told The Intercept. “Anti-Israel, anti-Zionist, anything related to this was received as fake, even if it was not.”</p>



<p>The Intercept was unable to independently confirm that sympathetic workers at Big Tech firms are responding to the group’s complaints or verify that the group was behind the removal of the content it has taken credit for having deleted. Iron Truth’s founder declined to share the names of its “insiders,” stating that they did not want to discuss their respective back channels with the press. In general, “they are not from the policy team but they have connections to the policy team,” Kaganovitch told The Intercept, referring to the personnel at social media firms who set rules for permissible speech. “Most of them are product managers, software developers. … They work with the policy teams with an internal set of tools to forward links and explanations about why they need to be removed.” While companies like Meta routinely engage with various civil society groups and NGOs to discuss and remove content, these discussions are typically run through their official content policy teams, not rank-and-file employees.</p>



<p>The Iron Truth Telegram account regularly credits these supposed insiders. “Thanks to the TikTok Israel team who fight for us and for the truth,” read an October 28 post on the group’s Telegram channel. “We work closely with Facebook, today we spoke with more senior managers,” according to another post on October 17. Soon after a Telegram chat member complained that something they’d posted to LinkedIn had attracted “inflammatory commenters,” the Iron Truth account replied, “Kudos to the social network LinkedIn who recruited a special team and have so far removed 60% of the content we reported on.”</p>


<!-- BLOCK(newsletter)[1](%7B%22componentName%22%3A%22NEWSLETTER%22%2C%22entityType%22%3A%22SHORTCODE%22%2C%22optional%22%3Atrue%7D)(%7B%7D) -->

<!-- END-BLOCK(newsletter)[1] -->



<p>Kaganovitch said the project has allies outside Israel’s Silicon Valley annexes as well. Iron Truth’s organizers met with the director of a controversial Israeli government cyber unit, he said, and its core team of more than 50 volunteers and 10 programmers includes a former member of the Israeli Parliament.</p>



<p>“Eventually our main goal is to get the tech companies to differentiate between freedom of speech and posts that their only goal is to harm Israel and to interfere with the relationship between Israel and Palestine to make the war even worse,” Inbar Bezek, the former Knesset member working with Iron Truth, told The Intercept in a WhatsApp message.</p>



<p>“Across our products, we have policies in place to mitigate abuse, prevent harmful content and help keep users safe. We enforce them consistently and without bias,” Google spokesperson Christa Muldoon told The Intercept. “If a user or employee believes they’ve found content that violates these policies, we encourage them to report it through the dedicated online channels.” Muldoon added that Google “encourages employees to use their time and skills to volunteer for causes they care about.” In interviews with The Intercept, Kaganovitch emphasized that he works on Iron Truth only in his free time, and said the project is entirely distinct from his day job at Google.</p>



<p>Meta spokesperson Ryan Daniels pushed back on the notion that Iron Truth was able to get content taken down outside the platform’s official processes, but declined to comment on Iron Truth’s underlying claim of a back channel to company employees. “Multiple pieces of content this group claims to have gotten removed from Facebook and Instagram are still live and visible today because they don’t violate our policies,” Daniels told The Intercept in an emailed statement. “The idea that we remove content based on someone’s personal beliefs, religion, or ethnicity is simply inaccurate.” Daniels added, “We receive feedback about potentially violating content from a variety of people, including employees, and we encourage anyone who sees this type of content to report it so we can investigate and take action according to our policies,” noting that Meta employees have access to internal content reporting tools, but that this system can only be used to remove posts that violate the company’s public Community Standards.</p>



<p>Neither TikTok nor LinkedIn responded to questions about Iron Truth. X could not be reached for comment.</p>

<h2 id="h-keep-bombing">“Keep Bombing!”</h2>



<p>Though confusion and recrimination are natural byproducts of any armed conflict, Iron Truth has routinely used the fog of war as evidence of anti-Israeli disinformation.</p>



<p>At the start of the project in the week after Hamas’s attack, for example, Iron Truth volunteers were encouraged to find and report posts expressing skepticism about claims of the mass decapitation of babies in an Israeli kibbutz. They quickly surfaced posts casting doubt on reports of “40 beheaded babies” during the Hamas attack, tagging them “fake news” and “disinformation” and sending them to platforms for removal. Among a list of LinkedIn content that Iron Truth told its Telegram followers it had passed along to the company was a post demanding evidence for the beheaded baby claim, categorized by the project as “Terror/Fake.”</p>



<p>But the skepticism they were attacking proved warranted. While many of Hamas’s atrocities against Israelis on October 7 are indisputable, the Israeli government itself ultimately said it <a href="https://theintercept.com/2023/10/11/israel-hamas-disinformation/">couldn’t verify</a> the horrific claim about<a href="https://theintercept.com/2023/12/14/israel-biden-beheaded-babies-false/"> beheaded babies</a>. Similarly, Iron Truth’s early efforts to take down “disinformation” about Israel bombing hospitals now contrast with weeks of well-documented airstrikes against multiple hospitals and the deaths of <a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/11/16/1213307710/gaza-doctors-al-shifa-hospital">hundreds of doctors</a> from Israeli bombs.</p>



<p>On October 16, Iron Truth shared a list of Facebook and Instagram posts it claimed responsibility for removing, writing on Telegram, “Significant things reported today and deleted. Good job! Keep bombing! 💪”</p>



<p>While most of the links no longer work, several are still active. One is a video of grievously wounded Palestinians in a hospital, including young children, with a caption accusing Israel of crimes against humanity. Another is a video from Mohamed El-Attar, a Canadian social media personality who posts under the name “That Muslim Guy.” In the post, shared the day after the Hamas attack, El-Attar argued the October 7 assault was not an act of terror, but of armed resistance to Israeli occupation. While this statement is no doubt inflammatory to many, particularly in Israel, Meta is supposed to allow for this sort of discussion, according to internal policy guidance previously reported by The Intercept. The <a href="https://theintercept.com/document/facebook-praise-support-and-representation-moderation-guidelines-reproduced-snapshot/">internal language</a>, which detailed the company’s Dangerous Individuals and Organizations policy, lists this sentence among examples of permitted speech: “The IRA were pushed towards violence by the brutal practices of the British government in Ireland.”</p>



<!-- BLOCK(promote-post)[3](%7B%22componentName%22%3A%22PROMOTE_POST%22%2C%22entityType%22%3A%22SHORTCODE%22%2C%22optional%22%3Atrue%7D)(%7B%22slug%22%3A%22israel-palestine%22%2C%22crop%22%3A%22promo%22%7D) -->  
<!-- END-BLOCK(promote-post)[3] -->



<p>While it’s possible for Meta posts to be deleted by moderators and later reinstated, Daniels, the spokesperson, disputed Iron Truth’s claim, saying links from the list that remain active had never been taken down in the first place. Daniels added that other links on the list had indeed been removed because they violated Meta policy but declined to comment on specific posts.</p>



<p>Under their own rules, the major social platforms aren’t supposed to remove content simply because it is controversial. While content moderation trigger-happiness around mere mentions of designated terror organizations has led to <a href="https://theintercept.com/2022/09/21/facebook-censorship-palestine-israel-algorithm/">undue censorship </a>of Palestinian and other Middle Eastern users, Big Tech policies on misinformation are, on paper, much more conservative. Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube, for example, only prohibit misinformation when it might cause physical harm, like snake oil cures for Covid-19, or posts meant to interfere with civic functions such as elections. None of the platforms targeted by Iron Truth prohibit merely “inflammatory” speech; indeed, such a policy would likely be the end of social media as we know it.</p>



<p>Still, content moderation rules are known to be vaguely conceived and erratically enforced. Meta for instance, says it categorically prohibits violent incitement, and touts various machine learning-based technologies to detect and remove such speech. Last month, however, The Intercept reported that the company had approved <a href="https://theintercept.com/2023/11/21/facebook-ad-israel-palestine-violence/">Facebook ads calling for the assassination</a> of a prominent Palestinian rights advocate, along with explicit calls for the murder of civilians in Gaza. On Instagram, users leaving comments with Palestinian flag emojis have seen these responses <a href="https://theintercept.com/2023/10/28/instagram-palestinian-flag-emoji/">inexplicably vanished</a>. 7amleh, a Palestinian digital rights organization that formally partners with Meta on speech issues, has documented over 800 reports of undue social media censorship since the war’s start, <a href="https://7or.7amleh.org/charts?start_date=10%2F07%2F2023&amp;end_date=12%2F12%2F2023&amp;type=14&amp;platform=&amp;platformIntegrate=&amp;gender=&amp;person_type=&amp;suspended_account=&amp;suspended_content=&amp;affiliation=&amp;affiliation=">according to its public database</a>.</p>



<h2 id="h-disinformation-in-the-eye-of-the-beholder">Disinformation in the Eye of the Beholder</h2>



<p>“It’s really hard to identify disinformation,” Kaganovitch acknowledged in an interview, conceding that what’s considered a conspiracy today might be corroborated tomorrow, and pointing to a recent Haaretz report that an <a href="https://www.haaretz.co.il/news/politics/2023-11-18/ty-article/0000018b-e1a5-d168-a3ef-f5ff4d070000">Israel Defense Forces helicopter may have inadvertently killed Israelis</a> on October 7 in the course of firing at Hamas.</p>



<p>Throughout October, Iron Truth provided a list of suggested keywords for volunteers in the project’s Telegram group to use when searching for content to report to the bot. Some of these terms, like “Kill Jewish” and “Kill Israelis,” pertained to content flagrantly against the rules of major social media platforms, which uniformly ban explicit violent incitement. Others reflected stances that might understandably offend Israeli social media users still reeling from the Hamas attack, like “Nazi flag israel.”</p>



<p>But many other suggestions included terms commonly found in news coverage or general discussion of the war, particularly in reference to Israel’s brutal bombardment of Gaza. Some of those phrases — including “Israel bomb hospital”; “Israel bomb churches”; “Israel bomb humanitarian”; and “Israel committing genocide” — were suggested as disinformation keywords as the Israeli military was being credibly accused of doing those very things. While some allegations against both Hamas and the IDF were and continue to be bitterly disputed — notably who bombed the Al-Ahli Arab Hospital on October 17 — Iron Truth routinely treated contested claims as “fake news,” siding against the sort of <a href="https://theintercept.com/2023/12/20/gaza-israel-biden-netanyahu-war-strategy/">analysis</a> or<a href="https://theintercept.com/2023/11/21/al-shifa-hospital-hamas-israel/"> discussion </a>often necessary to reach the truth.</p>



<!-- BLOCK(pullquote)[4](%7B%22componentName%22%3A%22PULLQUOTE%22%2C%22entityType%22%3A%22SHORTCODE%22%2C%22optional%22%3Atrue%7D)(%7B%22pull%22%3A%22right%22%7D) --><blockquote data-shortcode-type="pullquote" data-pull="right"><!-- CONTENT(pullquote)[4] -->“This post must be taken down, he is a really annoying liar and the amount of exposure he has is crazy.”<!-- END-CONTENT(pullquote)[4] --></blockquote><!-- END-BLOCK(pullquote)[4] -->



<p>Even the words “Israel lied” were suggested to Iron Truth volunteers on the grounds that they could be used in “false posts.” On October 16, two days after an Israeli airstrike killed 70 Palestinians <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/live-blog/israel-hamas-war-live-updates-rcna120252">evacuating from northern Gaza</a>, one Telegram group member shared a TikTok containing imagery of one of the bombed convoys. “This post must be taken down, he is a really annoying liar and the amount of exposure he has is crazy,” the member added. A minute later, the Iron Truth administrator account encouraged this member to report the post to the Iron Truth bot.</p>



<p>Although The Intercept is unable to see which links have been submitted to the bot, Telegram transcripts show the group’s administrator frequently encouraged users to flag posts accusing Israel of genocide or other war crimes. When a chat member shared a link to an Instagram post arguing “It has BEEN a genocide since the Nakba in 1948 when Palestinians were forcibly removed from their land by Israel with Britain’s support and it has continued for the past 75 years with US tax payer dollars,” the group administrator encouraged them to report the post to the bot three minutes later. Links to similar allegations of Israeli war crimes from figures such as popular Twitch streamer Hasan Piker; Colombian President Gustavo Petro; psychologist Gabor Maté; and a variety of obscure, ordinary social media users have received the same treatment.</p>



<p>Iron Truth has acknowledged its alleged back channel has limits: “It’s not immediate unfortunately, things go through a chain of people on the way,” Kaganovitch explained to one Telegram group member who complained a post they’d reported was still online. “There are companies that implement faster and there are companies that work more slowly. There is internal pressure from the Israelis in the big companies to speed up the reports and removal of the content. We are in constant contact with them 24/7.”</p>

<!-- END-BLOCK(cta)[5] -->



<p>Since the war began, social media users in Gaza and beyond have complained that content has been censored without any clear violation of a given company’s policies, a well-documented phenomenon long before the current conflict. But Brooking, of the Atlantic Council, cautioned that it can be difficult to determine the process that led to the removal of&nbsp;a given social media post. “There are almost certainly people from tech companies who are receptive to and will work with a civil society organization like this,” he said. “But there’s a considerable gulf between claiming those tech company contacts and having a major influence on tech company decision making.”</p>



<p>Iron Truth has found targets outside social media too. On November 27, one volunteer shared a link to NoThanks, an Android app that helps users boycott companies related to Israel. The Iron Truth administrator account quickly noted that the complaint had been forwarded to Google. Days later, Google<a href="https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20231205-google-removes-israel-boycott-app/"> pulled NoThanks from its app store</a>, though it was later reinstated. </p>



<p>The group has also gone after efforts to fundraise for Gaza. “These cuties are raising money,” said one volunteer, sharing a link to the Instagram account of Medical Aid for Palestinians. Again, the Iron Truth admin quickly followed up, saying the post had been “transferred” accordingly.</p>



<p>But Kaganovitch says his thinking around the topic of Israeli genocide has shifted. “I changed my thoughts a bit during the war,” he explained. Though he doesn’t agree that Israel is committing a genocide in Gaza, where the death toll has exceeded 20,000, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, he understands how others might. “The genocide, I stopped reporting it in about the third week [of the war].”</p>



<p>Several weeks after its launch, Iron Truth shared an infographic in its Telegram channel asking its followers not to pass along posts that were simply anti-Zionist. But OCT7, an Israeli group that “monitors the social web in real-time … and guides digital warriors,” lists Iron Truth as one of its partner organizations, alongside the Israeli Ministry for Diaspora Affairs, and cites “anti-Zionist bias” as part of the “challenge” it’s “battling against.”</p>



<p>Despite Iron Truth’s occasional attempts to rein in its volunteers and focus them on finding posts that might actually violate platform rules, getting everyone on board has proven difficult. Chat transcripts show many Iron Truth volunteers conflating Palestinian advocacy with material support for Hamas or characterizing news coverage as “misinformation” or “disinformation,” perennially vague terms whose meaning is further diluted in times of war and crisis.</p>



<p>“By the way, it would not be bad to go through the profiles of [United Nations] employees, the majority are local there and they are all supporters of terrorists,” recommended one follower in October. “Friends, report a profile of someone who is raising funds for Gaza!” said another Telegram group member, linking to the Instagram account of a New York-based beauty influencer. “Report this profile, it’s someone I met on a trip and it turns out she’s completely pro-Palestinian!” the same user added later that day. Social media accounts of Palestinian journalist Yara Eid; Palestinian photojournalist Motaz Azaiza; and many others involved in Palestinian human rights advocacy were similarly flagged by Iron Truth volunteers for allegedly spreading “false information.”</p>



<p>Iron Truth has at times struggled with its own followers. When one proposed reporting a link about <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/10/16/why-egypt-gaza-rafah-crossing-vital-for-supplying-aid-amid-israeli-strikes">Israeli airstrikes at the Rafah border crossing between Gaza and Egypt</a>, the administrator account pointed out that the IDF had indeed conducted the attacks, urging the group: “Let’s focus on disinformation, we are not fighting media organizations.” On another occasion, the administrator discouraged a user from reporting a page belonging to a news organization: “What’s the problem with that?” the administrator asked, noting that the outlet was “not pro-Israel, but is there fake news?”</p>



<p>But Iron Truth’s standards often seem muddled or contradictory. When one volunteer suggested going after B’Tselem, an Israeli human rights organization that advocates <a href="https://theintercept.com/2023/10/13/israel-settlers-gaza-palestinians-west-bank/">against the country’s military occupation</a> and <a href="https://theintercept.com/2023/11/29/intercepted-israel-palestine-prisoner-hostage/">broader repression of Palestinians</a>, the administrator account replied: “With all due respect, B’Tselem does publish pro-Palestinian content and this was also reported to us and passed on to the appropriate person.

<h2 id="h-friends-in-high-places"><strong>Friends in High Places</strong></h2>



<p>Though Iron Truth is largely a byproduct of Israel’s thriving tech economy — the country is home to many regional offices of American tech giants — it also claims support from the Israeli government.</p>



<p>The group’s founder says that Iron Truth leadership have met with Haim Wismonsky, director of the controversial Cyber Unit of the Israeli State Attorney’s Office. While the Cyber Unit purports to combat terrorism and miscellaneous cybercrime, critics say it’s used to censor unwanted criticism and Palestinian perspectives, relaying thousands upon thousands of content takedown demands. American Big Tech has proven largely willing to play ball with these demands: A 2018 report from the Israeli Ministry of Justice claimed a <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2021/10/08/israel/palestine-facebook-censors-discussion-rights-issues">90 percent compliance rate across social media platforms</a>.</p>



<p>Following an in-person presentation to the Cyber Unit, Iron Truth’s organizers have remained in contact, and sometimes forward the office links they need help removing, Kaganovitch said. “We showed them the presentation, they asked us also to monitor Reddit and Discord, but Reddit is not really popular here in Israel, so we focus on the big platforms right now.”</p>



<p>Wismonsky did not respond to a request for comment.</p>



<p>Kaganovitch noted that Bezek, the former Knesset member, “helps us with diplomatic and government&nbsp;relationships.” In an interview, Bezek confirmed her role and corroborated the group’s claims, saying that while Iron Truth had contacts with “many other employees” at social media firms, she is not involved in that aspect of the group’s work, adding, “I took on myself to be more like the legislation and legal connection.”</p>



<p>“What we’re doing on a daily basis is that we have a few groups of people who have social media profiles in different medias — LinkedIn, X, Meta, etc. — and if one of us is finding content that is antisemitic or content that is hate claims against Israel or against Jews, we are informing the other people in the group, and few people at the same time are reporting to the tech companies,” Bezek explained.</p>



<p>Bezek’s governmental outreach has so far included organizing meetings with Israel’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs and “European ambassadors in Israel.” Bezek declined to name the Israeli politicians or European diplomatic personnel involved because their communications are ongoing. These meetings have included allegations of foreign, state-sponsored “antisemitic campaigns and anti-Israeli campaigns,” which Bezek says Iron Truth is collecting evidence about in the hope of pressuring the United Nations to act.</p>



<p>Iron Truth has also collaborated with Digital Dome, a similar volunteer effort spearheaded by the Israeli anti-disinformation organization FakeReporter, which helps coordinate the mass reporting of unwanted social media content. Israeli American investment fund J-Ventures, which has reportedly worked directly with the IDF to advance Israeli military interests, has <a href="https://jackpoulson.substack.com/p/inside-the-pro-israel-information">promoted both Iron Truth and Digital Dome</a>.</p>



<p>FakeReporter did not respond to a request for comment.</p>



<p>While most counter-misinformation efforts betray some geopolitical loyalty, Iron Truth is openly nationalistic. An <a href="https://www.ynetnews.com/magazine/article/sy0ojiig6">October 28 write-up</a> in the popular Israeli news website Ynet — “Want to Help With Public Diplomacy? This is How You Start”— cited the Telegram bot as an example of how ordinary Israelis could help their country, noting: “In the absence of a functioning Information Ministry, Israeli men and women hope to be able to influence even a little bit the sounding board on the net.” A <a href="https://www.bizportal.co.il/globalmarkets/news/article/820311">mention</a> in the Israeli financial news website BizPortal described Iron Truth as fighting “false and inciting content against Israel.”</p>



<p>Iron Truth is “a powerful reminder that it’s still people who run these companies at the end of the day,” said Brooking. “I think it’s natural to try to create these coordinated reporting groups when you feel that your country is at war in or in danger, and it’s natural to use every tool at your disposal, including the language of disinformation or fact checking, to try to remove as much content as possible if you think it’s harmful to you or people you love.”</p>



<p>The real risk, Brooking said, lies not in the back channel, but in the extent to which companies that control the speech of billions around the world are receptive to insiders arbitrarily policing expression. “If it’s elevating content for review that gets around trust and safety teams, standing policy, policy [into] which these companies put a lot of work,” he said, “then that’s a problem.”</p>

<p>Last spring, a friend of a friend visited my office and invited me to Langley to speak to Invisible Ink, the CIA’s creative writing group.</p>
<p>I asked Vivian (not her real name) what she wanted me to talk about.</p>
<p>She said that the topic of the talk was entirely up to me.</p>
<p>I asked what level the writers in the group were.</p>
<p>She said the group had writers of all levels.</p>
<p>I asked what the speaking fee was.</p>
<p>She said that as far as she knew, there was no speaking fee.</p>
<p>I dwelled a little on this point.</p>
<p>She confirmed that there was no speaking fee.</p>
<p>When an organization has, say, financed the overthrow of the government of Guatemala, you would think there might be a speaking fee. But I was told that, in lieu of payment, the writing group would take me out to lunch in the executive dining room afterward. I would also have my picture taken in front of the CIA seal, and I could post that picture anywhere I wanted.</p>
<p>“So my visit wouldn’t be classified?”</p>
<p>Vivian confirmed that I could tell anyone I wanted. “Just don’t tell them my name—or I’ll have to kill you. Just kidding!”<span id="more-166475"></span></p>
<p>As I considered the invitation, I kept wondering why I’d been invited. I don’t write about CIA-adjacent topics, nor am I successful enough a novelist that people outside a small circle—one that I doubt includes U.S. intelligence agencies—know my name. So the invite was a bit of a mystery. This was the second-most common question that came up when I told writer friends about it, topped only by: “No speaking fee?” At first, I wondered whether the gig was part of a recruitment strategy. But it doesn’t take a vast intelligence apparatus to know that I am not intelligence material, not least because I am a professional writer.</p>
<p>Next I wondered if my visit could be used as soft-diplomacy propaganda. Look how harmless we are! We let writers come to our headquarters and pose for pictures. The CIA had veered into this type of literary boosterism before—supporting, for example, the founding of the very magazine for which I am writing this piece. So it wasn’t out of the question. In 2021, I had turned down an invitation from the government of Saudi Arabia for an all-expenses-paid trip to a writers’ retreat at al-‘Ulā, as I didn’t want to be a part of their arts and culture whitewashing. But in the end, I couldn’t think of a way that I’d be a useful propaganda tool for the CIA—unless they anticipated me writing this essay (in which case, kudos CIA)—and so I said yes.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>On the agreed-upon morning a few weeks later, I left my apartment in D.C. and drove into the haze of Canadian wildfire smoke that was floating over the city. By the time I turned off the George Washington Parkway at the George Bush Center for Intelligence exit, and on to a restricted usage road, I was already nervous. I’m the kind of person who weighs and measures my suitcases before flying, lest I be scolded at the airport, and I do not like driving down roads with signs like <small>EMPLOYEES ONLY</small> and <small>WILL BE ARRESTED.</small></p>
<p>At the gate intercom, I gave my name and social security number—Vivian had gathered this information and more ahead of time, over a series of phone calls, each from a different phone number—and a police officer gave me a visitor’s badge that was to be <em>displayed on my person at all times</em>. He warned me that I was to be<em> escorted at all times</em>.</p>
<p>I met Vivian in a lot between the first gate and the second gate, where her car was the only one parked. She gave me another badge that appeared identical to the first. I left my phone in my car as instructed, and we got into Vivian’s car and drove to the second gate. That was when things started not going as planned.</p>
<p>Four agitated police officers blocked our way.</p>
<p>“He can’t leave his car here!” they yelled when Vivian rolled down her window.</p>
<p>“But I cleared this ahead of time,” Vivian said.</p>
<p>“He can’t leave his car here. It’s a security risk.”</p>
<p>“But how am I supposed to escort him if we can’t drive together?”</p>
<p>“Ma’am,” one of them said, “I just do parking.”</p>
<p>It turned out that, like in many bureaucracies, the individual parts that made up the CIA were siloed, and there was no point in arguing about logical contradictions.</p>
<p>Vivian gave up and drove me back to my car, clearly stressed. I told her it wasn’t a big deal—I would just follow her.</p>
<p>The problem, she said, was that we wouldn’t be able to park in the same lot. And I had to be escorted at all times. And employee parking at the CIA was a mess. “It’ll take me forever just to walk to you.”</p>
<p>She resolved that she would simply park in VIP visitor parking with me, and if she got a ticket, she got a ticket. “Just follow me.”</p>
<p>I got in my car and followed her to the gate. I watched from behind the wheel as she drove up to the gate, talked to one of the police officers, and drove off past the gate at a good clip, very much not being followed by me.</p>
<p>I pulled up to the gate, and an aggressive police officer questioned me about why I had two badges.</p>
<p>“Didn’t it seem strange to you to get a second badge when you’d just got your first one?”</p>
<p>“I’ve never been here before,” I said. “Everything seems strange to me.”</p>
<p>A different cop told him to give it a rest, handed me a third badge, and asked if I needed directions to VIP parking. I have a terrible sense of direction—I once got lost at Costco for so long that they had to call my mom over the PA; I was fifteen—and Google Maps isn’t much use at Langley.</p>
<p>The nice cop said that I needed to turn right and follow the road until the sixth left. There I would see a line of squad cars and a gate, where my badge would swipe me in.</p>
<p>“If you see a helicopter, you’ve gone too far,” he said. “Just loop back around. Don’t make a U-turn.”</p>
<p>When I later told Vivian about the mean cop and the nice one, she said, “They’re always doing that good cop–bad cop thing.”</p>
<p>“For parking?”</p>
<p>“For everything!”</p>
<p>I found the VIP parking on my first try. I held my badge out to the scanner. The gate rose! I drove in. And drove. And drove. And drove. In circles, because all the spaces in the small VIP lot were taken. I couldn’t leave the parking lot—I wasn’t supposed to be unescorted anywhere on campus, but at least in visitor parking my presence was somewhat explainable—so I kept circling the lot, accumulating sweat. Finally, someone left. I parked, got out, took a breath of ashy air, and wondered what to do next. I was relieved to see Vivian’s car stuck at the VIP gate, negotiating with the voice on the intercom.</p>
<p>“They won’t let me into VIP parking,” she explained as I got into her car. “They said it’s a security risk.”</p>
<p>We turned back onto the main road and drove for a bit. And then, after a bend, there appeared an abundance of parked cars. Cars upon cars upon cars. I’d never seen a parking lot this big, outside of professional sporting events. The quadrants were labeled by color, the rows by letter; we weaved through row after row of Virginia plates, from Blue D all the way up to Purple V without finding a spot.</p>
<p>I asked Vivian how many people worked at the CIA.</p>
<p>“Maybe two million?” She smiled and confessed that she had no idea, even though I was made to understand that she had been at the CIA, and in the writing group, for a number of years.</p>
<p>As we snaked through line after line of cars, Vivian told me that if you worked here and wanted to avoid a twenty-minute walk from your car, you had to be at the office by 7 <small>A.M.</small> I wondered if this was intentional—a way to encourage long hours, like the tech companies that offer employees free dinners in the cafeterias that don’t open until 6:30 <small>P.M.</small> Or if it was the result of expansion necessitated by the post-9/11 surveillance state and the popularity of phones that record our every movement. As Kerry Howley notes in <em>Bottoms Up and the Devil Laughs: A Journey Through the Deep State</em>, we have created and stored more data in the twenty-first century than in the rest of human history combined. If the government wants to find coherent stories in all that data, I thought as I looked at the vastness of the lot, someone has to comb through it.</p>
<p>At first, we couldn’t find the conference room. Like me, Vivian wasn’t allowed to bring her phone into the main building, but even if she had, I don’t know who she would’ve called for directions. CIA officers generally don’t know their coworkers’ last names. (The Starbucks at Langley is the only Starbucks where baristas aren’t allowed to ask for your name.) So I am without photos or notes, but walking through the main building at Langley, is, in my memory, like walking through an airport terminal in a major metropolis, crossed with a hospital, crossed with an American mall, crossed with an Eastern European university. It’s big and gleaming and cold and brutal, all at once. There was a hall of presidential portraits with notes from commanders in chief to the Secret Service, all of them written in elegant fountain pen, except for Donald Trump’s, which was written in Sharpie and said “I’M SO PROUD OF YOU!”</p>
<p>We finally found the conference room, through a side door in the CIA Museum. It was unclear who this museum was for, but it was not a bad museum, full of objects of interest: pieces of the Berlin Wall, tie-clip cameras, Soviet bugging devices, et cetera, displayed in glass cases. Six people were seated at the conference table inside the conference room, which was windowless and had a big CIA seal on the wall.</p>
<p>“Sorry we’re late!” Vivian announced.</p>
<p>“Strip search?” one of the men joked.</p>
<p>“Parking,” I said.</p>
<p>A collective groan. The goddamned parking.</p>
<p>I began by asking what people were writing. Surprisingly, none of the CIA writers were writing spy novels. They were working on short stories. Self-published dystopian sci-fi. A presidential biography. Upmarket fiction. A personal blog, which I was told to check out if I ever wanted a really good muffin recipe. The writing group was organized around what sounded like a listserv announcing periodic meetings to whatever members were available that day. Only about half the people in the room seemed to know one another.</p>
<p>I talked a little bit about writing beginnings and working through false starts. I read the first page of my latest novel, explained why I’d set the first scene in the U.S. when the rest of the novel takes place in Ukraine, and went through all the false starts I’d taken to get where I was going. One officer raised their hand and asked about establishing voice in first versus third person. Another asked about revision techniques. Another about the shift from writing alone to working with an editor. It was the least remarkable Q&amp;A I’ve ever been a part of.</p>
<p>I had a little time to kill before our lunch reservation—seating time in the executive dining room was not flexible—so Vivian took me to the gift shop.</p>
<p>Given that almost no one’s allowed inside Langley and the people who work for the CIA aren’t supposed to advertise it, it was, like with the museum, a bit of a mystery who the gift shop was for. The shelves were stocked with T-shirts (Central Intelligence Agency), mugs (Central Intelligence Agency), and novelty barbecue sauce (Top Secret Recipe!). There was also a Pride Month display (Central Intelligence Agency in rainbow). I bought a Pride Month pen for four dollars.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The dining room was long and mostly empty—apparently a security thing—with white tablecloths and a long wall of windows looking out at the swampy greenery of northern Virginia. Or I was told that it normally looked out at greenery. Today it looked out at wildfire smoke. The menu was essentially cafeteria food—normal American fare. I ordered a burger with sweet potato fries and a Coke from a businesslike waitress in a white dress shirt.</p>
<p>The CIA officer seated next to me asked if I thought it was worth getting a literary agent. I said yes, and she seemed skeptical.</p>
<p>“In my other work,” she explained, “I can get movie people attached.”</p>
<p>I still have no idea what she meant.</p>
<p>While we waited for our food, the writer of dystopian sci-fi confirmed that if you work for the CIA, lawyers have to vet anything you publish. But they were more lenient than I would’ve guessed. She said that one of her novels had helped change how the agency viewed fiction versus nonfiction. While reading her novel, the lawyers decided that just because a character in a novel says something doesn’t mean that the author necessarily agrees, so there should be more leeway for CIA fiction writers. (Which suggests CIA lawyers are more nuanced literary critics than half of Goodreads.)</p>
<p>Obviously you can’t share classified information, I was told. You can’t violate the Hatch Act, showing your political affiliation, and you’re also not supposed to violate the <em>Washington Post</em> rule, which was: Would the CIA be embarrassed if this were in tomorrow’s <em>Washington</em> <em>Post</em>? (This seemed trickiest to determine.)</p>
<p>Another officer mentioned that, since the CIA has people doing things abroad that could be considered dubious, you had to be sensitive about that. I asked what they meant when they said dubious, which resulted in a change of topic. I asked if they knew of any issues with someone trying to publish something that they couldn’t get approved.

<p>“It was interesting to learn what you all can and can’t write about,” I said to Vivian. “I didn’t realize you had so much freedom to write about your jobs.”</p>
<p>We passed through the security turnstile and walked over a giant CIA seal, which I recognized from several movies, painted on the marble floor.</p>
<p>“The last thing in the world I’d want to write about is this place,” Vivian said at the door. “I can’t imagine anything more boring.”</p>

<p>Humans have dreamed about traveling to other star systems and setting foot on alien worlds for generations. To put it mildly, interstellar exploration is a very daunting task.</p><p>As Universe Today explored in a <a href="https://www.universetoday.com/163132/tiny-swarming-spacecraft-could-establish-communications-with-proxima-centauri/">previous post</a>, it would take between 19,000 and 81,000 years for a spacecraft to reach Proxima Centauri using conventional propulsion (or those that are feasible using current technology). On top of that, there are numerous risks when traveling through the interstellar medium (ISM), not all of which are well-understood.</p><p>Under the circumstances, gram-scale spacecraft that rely on directed-energy propulsion (AKA lasers) appear to be the only viable option for reaching neighboring stars in this century.</p><p>Proposed concepts include the<span> </span><a href="https://www.nasa.gov/general/swarming-proxima-centauri/">Swarming Proxima Centauri</a>, a collaborative effort between<span> </span><a href="https://www.space-initiatives.com/">Space Initiatives Inc.</a><span> </span>and the<span> </span><a href="https://i4is.org/">Initiative for Interstellar Studies</a><span> </span>(i4is) led by Space Initiative's chief scientist<span> </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tmeubanks/">Marshall Eubanks</a>. The concept was recently selected for<span> </span><a href="https://www.nasa.gov/general/swarming-proxima-centauri/">Phase I development</a><span> </span>as part of this year's<span> </span><a href="https://www.nasa.gov/stmd-the-nasa-innovative-advanced-concepts-niac/">NASA Innovative Advanced Concepts</a><span> </span>(NIAC) program.</p><p>According to Eubanks, traveling through interstellar space is a question of distance, energy, and speed. At a distance of 4.25 light-years (40 trillion km; 25 trillion mi) from the Solar System, even Proxima Centauri is unfathomably far away.</p><p>To put it in perspective, the record for the farthest distance ever traveled by a spacecraft goes to the<span> </span><em><a href="https://voyager.jpl.nasa.gov/">Voyager 1</a></em><span> </span>space probe, which is currently more than 24 billion km (15 billion miles) from Earth. Using conventional methods, the probe accomplished a maximum speed of 61,500 km/h (38,215 mph) and has been traveling for more than 46 years straight.</p><p>In short, traveling at anything less than relativistic speed (a fraction of the speed of light) will make interstellar transits incredibly long and entirely impractical. Given the energy requirements this calls for, anything other than small spacecraft with a maximum mass of a few grams is feasible. As Eubanks told Universe Today via email:</p><blockquote>
<p><em>"Of course, rockets are a common way to go fast. Rockets work by throwing "stuff" (typically hot gas) out the back, the momentum in the stuff going backwards equaling that in the velocity increase of the vehicle in the forward direction. The essence of rocketry is that it is only really efficient if the velocity of the stuff going backwards is comparable to the velocity you want to gain going forward. If it isn't, if it is very much smaller, you just can't carry enough stuff to gain the velocity you want.</em></p>
</blockquote><blockquote>
<p><em>"The trouble is that we have no technology – no energy source – that would enable us to throw out a lot of stuff at anything like 60,000 km/sec, and so rockets won't work. <a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/antimatter" data-linkid="73014" data-postid="116276" rel="nofollow" target="_self">Antimatter</a> might conceivably enable this, but we just don't understand antimatter well enough – and can't make anywhere near enough of it – to make this a solution, probably for many decades to come."</em></p>
</blockquote><p>In contrast, concepts like Breakthrough Starshot and the Proxima Swarm consist of "inverting the rocket" – i.e., instead of throwing stuff out, stuff is thrown at the spacecraft. Instead of heavy propellant, which constitutes the majority of conventional rockets, the energy source for a lightsail is photons (which have no mass and move at the speed of light).</p><p>But as Eubanks indicated, this does not overcome the issue of energy, making it even more important that the spacecraft be as small as possible.</p><p>"Bouncing photons off of a laser sail thus solves the speed-of-stuff problem," he said.</p><p>"But the trouble is, there is not much momentum in a photon, so we need a<span> </span><em>lot<span> </span></em>of them. And given the power we are likely to have available, even a couple of decades from now, the thrust will be weak, so the mass of the probes needs to be very small – grams, not tons."</p><p>Their proposal calls for a 100-gigawatt (GW) laser beamer boosting thousands of gram-scale space probes with laser sails to relativistic speed (~10-20 percent of light). They also proposed a series of terrestrial light buckets measuring a square kilometer (0.386 mi<sup>2</sup>) in diameter to catch the light signals from the probes once they are well on their way to reaching Proxima Centauri (and communications become more difficult).</p><p>By their estimates, this mission concept could be ready for development around midcentury and could reach Proxima Centauri and its Earth-like exoplanet (<a href="https://exoplanets.nasa.gov/exoplanet-catalog/7167/proxima-centauri-b/">Proxima b</a>) by the third quarter of this century (2075 or after).</p><figure id="attachment_116316" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-116316"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/01/swarming_proxima_centauri_nasa.webp" alt="diagram showing a swarm of probes approaching proxima centauri, improving their odds of arriving" width="1024" height="587" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/01/swarming_proxima_centauri_nasa.webp 1024w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/01/swarming_proxima_centauri_nasa-642x368.webp 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/01/swarming_proxima_centauri_nasa-724x415.webp 724w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/01/swarming_proxima_centauri_nasa-768x440.webp 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/01/swarming_proxima_centauri_nasa-600x344.webp 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-116316">A graphic depiction of the Swarming Proxima Centauri project. (<a href="https://www.nasa.gov/general/swarming-proxima-centauri/">Thomas Eubanks/NASA</a>)</figcaption></figure><p>In a<span> </span><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.07061.pdf">previous paper</a>, Eubanks and his colleagues demonstrated how a fleet of a thousand spacecraft could overcome the difficulties imposed by interstellar travel and maintaining communications with Earth through swarm dynamics.</p><p>"By raising the collecting area to a doable 1 km<sup>2</sup><span> </span>and having many probes coordinate their sending, we can get a reasonable (if smaller) bit rate," he added.</p><p>However, the eight-year round-trip lag on communications imposed by interstellar distances and <a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/general-relativity" data-linkid="73026" data-postid="116276" rel="nofollow" target="_self">General Relativity</a> makes controlling the probes remotely from Earth impossible.</p><p>As such, the swarm must possess an extraordinary degree of autonomy when it comes to navigation (coordinating a thousand probes) and deciding what data is returned to Earth. While these strategies address distance, energy, and speed (at least for the time being), there is still the issue of how much it will cost to create the swarm and the associated infrastructure.</p><p>The single greatest expense will be the laser array itself, whereas the gram-scale craft will be reasonably cheap to produce. As Eubanks told Universe Today in a<span> </span><a href="https://www.universetoday.com/163132/tiny-swarming-spacecraft-could-establish-communications-with-proxima-centauri/">previous article</a>, their proposal can be developed with a budget of $100 billion.</p><p>But as Eubanks emphasized (then and now), the benefits of the mission architecture they've envisioned are legion, and the payoff of sending a swarm of probes to Proxima Centauri would be astronomical:</p><blockquote>
<p><em>"The simple fact is that the cost of a laser-propelled interstellar mission, with light-weight probes and a huge laser system to propel them to the stars, will be dominated by capital costs – the costs of the laser system."</em></p>
<p><em>"The probes themselves will be pretty cheap by comparison. So, if you can send one, you should send lots. Clearly, sending a lot of probes brings the advantage of redundancy." </em></p>
<p><em>"Space travel is risky, and interstellar travel is likely to be especially risky, so if we send a lot of probes, we can tolerate a high loss rate. But we can do a lot more."</em></p>
</blockquote><blockquote>
<p><em>"We want to look for signs of biology and even technology, and so it would be good to get probes very close to the planet, to get good pictures and spectra of the surface and atmosphere." </em></p>
<p><em>"That will be tough for one probe, as we don't know very well where the planet will be 24-plus years in the future. By sending a bunch of probes in a spread, at least a few should get close to the planet, giving us the close-up view we want."</em></p>
</blockquote><p>Beyond that, Eubanks and his colleagues hope that the development of a coherent swarm of robotic probes will have applications closer to home.

For them, the research took many years but is closer to realization than ever.</p><p>"It's been a long time – almost a decade – and we feel honored to be selected," said Eubanks.
