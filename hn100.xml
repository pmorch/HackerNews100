Within the 4th generation we find the monochrome Game Boy and its revisions, and in the next generation resides the Game Boy Color (shipped after the demise of the <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/virtual-boy/">Virtual Boy</a>). The good news is that this article covers both ends. So, in the end, you’ll get a good understanding of how the Game Boy works and how its technology subsequently evolved to become the Game Boy Color.</p><hr><h2 id="cpu">CPU</h2><p>Instead of placing many off-the-shelf chips on the motherboard, Nintendo opted for a <strong>single-chip design</strong> to house (and hide) most of the components, including the CPU. This type of chip is called <strong>System On Chip</strong> (SoC) and, in this case, it’s been specifically crafted for this console, enabling Nintendo to tailor it to their needs (power efficiency, anti-piracy and extra I/O, among other things). At the same time, this chip can’t be found in any retail catalog, meaning competitors back then had a harder time cloning it.</p><p>That being said, the SoC found on the Game Boy is referred to as <strong>DMG-CPU</strong> or <strong>Sharp LR35902</strong> <sup id="bibref:1"><a href="#bib:cpu-realboy" role="doc-biblioref">[1]</a></sup> and, as the name indicates, it’s manufactured by <strong>Sharp Corporation</strong>. This company, along with Ricoh (the <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/nes/#a-bit-of-context">NES’ CPU supplier</a>), enjoyed a close relationship with Nintendo.</p><h3 id="the-cpu-core">The CPU core</h3><p>Within DMG-CPU, the main processor is a <strong>Sharp SM83</strong> <sup id="bibref:2"><a href="#bib:cpu-gekkio" role="doc-biblioref">[2]</a></sup> and it’s a mix between the Z80 (the same CPU used on the <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/master-system/#cpu">Sega Master System</a>) and the Intel 8080. It runs at <strong>~4.19 MHz</strong>, which is faster than the average 1-MHz CPU, but remember clock speeds <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/master-system/#relative-comparison">can be deceiving</a>.</p><figure><a href="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/gameboy/dmg_cpu.018e810ee7d690ab8ff9978bd7853a2b348121ca85d64214c259c5875026524e.png"><picture><img alt="Image" width="300" height="238" src="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/gameboy/dmg_cpu.018e810ee7d690ab8ff9978bd7853a2b348121ca85d64214c259c5875026524e.png" loading="lazy"></picture></a><figcaption>The DMG-CPU, found on the Game Boy’s motherboard.</figcaption></figure><p>Now, back when I did the <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/master-system/">analysis of the Master system</a>, I explained the Z80 is itself a superset of the 8080. So, what does the SM83 actually have and lack from those two? <sup id="bibref:3"><a href="#bib:cpu-steil" role="doc-biblioref">[3]</a></sup></p><ul><li>Neither the Z80’s <code>IX</code> or <code>IY</code> registers nor the 8080’s <code>IN</code> or <code>OUT</code> instructions are included. This means that <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/master-system/#accessing-the-rest-of-the-components">I/O ports</a> are not available. I’m not certain if that’s just a measure to reduce costs, but one thing for sure is that components will have to be <strong>completely memory-mapped</strong> <sup id="bibref:4"><a href="#bib:cpu-fayzullin" role="doc-biblioref">[4]</a></sup>.</li><li>Only Intel 8080’s set of registers are implemented.

They optimise certain operations related to the way Nintendo/Sharp arranged the hardware. One example is the new <code>LDH</code> instruction (meaning ‘load from high RAM’ <sup id="bibref:5"><a href="#bib:cpu-ldh" role="doc-biblioref">[5]</a></sup>), which has been specifically included to operate the second half of the memory map (where addresses start at <code>$ff</code>) and, most importantly, fits in a single byte (instead of requiring two or more).</p><h4 id="the-color-effect">The Color effect</h4><p>Almost 10 years later, after the abandonment of the <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/virtual-boy/">Virtual Boy</a> and its <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/virtual-boy/#cpu">cutting-edge hardware</a>, a humble successor arrived: the <strong>Game Boy Color</strong>. Inside it, there’s a new SoC named <strong>CPU CGB</strong> that carries a few additions. However, its SM83 CPU core remains the same, except for its doubled clock speed (now running at <strong>~8.38 MHz</strong>).</p><p>It’s hard to think that after a decade Nintendo would still bundle the same CPU, but such decision does come with the following advantages:</p><ul><li>Developers can re-use their current skills to program the new console.</li><li>There’s a cost saving by not having to re-design their system to work for a new architecture.</li><li>Backwards compatibility becomes possible without considerable effort. In fact, Nintendo implemented it by programming two modes of operation on CPU CGB:<ul><li><strong>Normal mode</strong>: The SM83 operates at <strong>~4.19 MHz</strong>.</li><li><strong>Dual-speed mode</strong>: The SM83 operates at <strong>~8.38 MHz</strong>.</li></ul></li></ul><p>Albeit, this comes at the cost of adopting outdated technology by late-90s standards. You only have to look at the <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/playstation/##tab-1-1-a-bit-of-history">state of the CPU market</a> to notice the capabilities Nintendo was missing out (to be fair, Nintendo did try with the <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/virtual-boy/">Virtual Boy</a>).</p><h3 id="hardware-access">Hardware access</h3><p>The SM83 maintains an <strong>8-bit data bus</strong> and a <strong>16-bit address bus</strong>, so up to <strong>64 KB of memory</strong> can be addressed.

The PPU arbitrates access to VRAM.</figcaption></figure><p>Nintendo fitted <strong>8 KB of RAM</strong> on the motherboard, this is for general purpose use (which they call <strong>Work RAM</strong> or ‘WRAM’) <sup id="bibref:8"><a href="#bib:cpu-nintendo" role="doc-biblioref">[8]</a></sup>. Notice that this is four times larger than what the <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/nes/">NES</a> included.</p><p>There’s an additional <strong>127 B</strong> of RAM housed in the SoC. It goes by many names (‘H’, ‘High’, ‘Working’ and ‘Stack’ RAM) but the purpose is the same: provide a small space for data that must be accessed instantly, such as the stack. It’s not technically faster to access than general RAM, but it’s an area prioritised for the CPU. You’ll see what this means when you reach the ‘Graphics’ section, where I discuss the DMA component.</p><figure><a href="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/gameboy/cgb-ram.d8debd194bbc6a0b64ea7ec1b2bc3a7c38a28551e75b4d2c0ede5f3690a152b9.png"><picture><img alt="Image" width="527" height="344" src="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/gameboy/cgb-ram.d8debd194bbc6a0b64ea7ec1b2bc3a7c38a28551e75b4d2c0ede5f3690a152b9.png" loading="lazy"></picture></a><figcaption>Expanded memory architecture of the CGB (Game Boy Color). Again, the PPU arbitrates access to VRAM.</figcaption></figure><p>Later on, with the Color variant, Nintendo enlarged WRAM to <strong>32 KB</strong>. However, since the CPU remained unchanged (particularly its addressing capabilities), it’s not possible to connect all the new memory without first overflowing the available address space. To tackle this, Nintendo’s engineers implemented <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/nes/#going-beyond-existing-capabilities">bank switching</a>. Originally found in <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/nes/#cartridgegame-data">NES cartridges</a>, the Game Boy Color uses the same principle to access those 32 KB only using 8 KB of memory space. The trick is simple: the last 4 KB can be swapped using eight different banks. Consequently, the CPU bundles an extra register (called <code>SVBK</code>) acting as the bank switcher, this is what developers must use to examine the extended memory.</p><hr><h2 id="graphics">Graphics</h2><p>All graphics calculations are done by the CPU, and then the <strong>Picture Processing Unit</strong> or ‘PPU’ renders them. This is another component found inside DMG-CPU and it’s based on the <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/nes/#graphics">predecessor’s graphics chip</a> (of the same name).</p><p>The picture is displayed on an integrated LCD screen, it has a resolution of <strong>160×144 pixels</strong> and, in the case of the monochrome Game Boy, shows <strong>4 shades of grey</strong> (white, light grey, dark grey and black). Since the original Game Boy has a green LCD, the picture will look <em>greenish</em>.</p><p>If you’ve read the NES article before, you may remember that the PPU was designed to follow the CRT beam. However (and for obvious reasons), we got an LCD screen in the Game Boy. Well, the new PPU also follows that methodology as LCDs require to be refreshed too. In doing so, this console will enjoy <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/nes/##tab-5-4-background-split">CRT-based effects</a> that previously enabled NES developers to come up with imaginative content.</p><h3 id="organising-the-content">Organising the content</h3><figure><a href="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/gameboy/ppu.0adaeb84d076416fb4cbeb3f70d69c81ec850b2ed5ca17b6873d80e6eda47542.png"><picture><img alt="Image" width="644" height="332" src="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/gameboy/ppu.0adaeb84d076416fb4cbeb3f70d69c81ec850b2ed5ca17b6873d80e6eda47542.png" loading="lazy"></picture></a><figcaption>Memory architecture of the PPU.</figcaption></figure><p>The PPU is connected to <strong>8 KB of VRAM</strong> or ‘Display RAM’. In doing so, it also provides arbitrated access to the CPU. Those 8 KB will contain most of the data the PPU will need to render graphics. The remaining materials will instead be stored inside the PPU, as they require faster access rates.</p><p>The game is in charge of populating the different areas with the correct type of data. Moreover, the PPU exposes registers so the game can instruct the PPU on how that data is organised. Nevertheless, there are many rules to follow (you’ll see it in the following sections).</p><h3 id="constructing-the-frame">Constructing the frame</h3><p>Let’s see how the PPU manages to draw stuff on the screen.

You will see now what are the additions of the so-called ‘Color’ model of this brand.</p><h4 id="modes-of-operation">Modes of operation</h4><p>To begin with, for compatibility reasons, the new PPU has <strong>two modes of operation</strong>. Yet, Nintendo wanted Color users to see enhancements even with the monochrome-only games. Consequently, the two modes of operation are as follows:</p><ul><li><strong>CGB mode</strong>: Extended PPU mode with all the visual improvements that comprise the new Game Boy Color games.</li><li><strong>DMG mode</strong>: Traditional mode with all the extras disabled. However, you’ll see in the ‘Operating System’ section that monochrome games are nonetheless enhanced with colour palettes.</li></ul><h4 id="organising-the-new-content">Organising the (new) content</h4><p>The CGB motherboard now houses <strong>16 KB of VRAM</strong> instead, which is double the original VRAM amount. Due to the CPU’s addressing limitations, this new arrangement is implemented in the form of <strong>two 8 KB banks</strong>, with a new register (called <code>VBK</code>) acting as a switcher. On the other side, the PPU can access the two banks at the same time. At the end of the day, this means programmers only need to fill the VRAM banks with the help of <code>VBK</code>, and then specify in the tile map the bank where the tile is found, so the PPU can take care of the rest.</p><p>That being said, what can you do with the extra VRAM? Many things:</p><ul><li>Store more tiles.</li><li>Store more palettes, especially <em>coloured</em> ones.</li><li>Extend the tile metadata space to encode more effects and address extra palettes.</li></ul><h5 id="the-visuals">The visuals</h5><p>Thanks to the new PPU, programmers can now define colour palettes with <strong>32,768 colors</strong> to choose from.</p><p>Firstly, developers must now populate a new area called <strong>Palette Memory</strong>, which stores up to <strong>eight colour palettes</strong> that encode <strong>four colours</strong> <sup id="bibref:10"><a href="#bib:cpu-nintendo" role="doc-biblioref">[10]</a></sup>. Each entry fits in a 16-bit value (2 bytes) and only 15 bits are used. Palette Memory is not addressed by the CPU, however, a new register is used as a buffer to write over this memory. This is what the CPU follows to define the palettes.</p><p>Having said that, Background and Window tiles can reference any of those eight palettes. The same happens with Sprite tiles, except they are constrained to three-colour palettes, as one entry is reserved for the ‘transparent’ colour.</p><p>Moving on, <strong>Tile sets are now twice as big</strong>. Thus, programmers can store double the amount of tiles in VRAM. <strong>Background/Window Tile maps have been extended</strong> as well, resulting in extra meta-data being encoded. Consequently, expanding the capabilities of these layers. For instance, their tiles can now be <strong>horizontally and vertically flipped</strong>, saving the game from storing duplicated graphics in VRAM (which, in turn, can be exploited to draw more unique content).</p><p>Furthermore, CPU CGB also bundles <strong>two extra DMA units</strong>, both can copy the contents of the Game Pak or WRAM to VRAM, but their timings differ <sup id="bibref:11"><a href="#bib:cpu-nintendo" role="doc-biblioref">[11]</a></sup>:</p><ul><li><strong>General-purpose DMA</strong>: The transfer will happen at any time and the DMA will get priority over any other memory access. So, programmers need to be careful about when to use this component (i.e.&nbsp;during or outside scanning) and how (the amount of data to copy), as misuse can lead to screen tearing (VRAM access will be blocked during the transfer).</li><li><strong>Horizontal Blank (H-Blank) DMA</strong>: The transfer will only happen during H-Blank periods. This avoids screen artifacts, but can only transfer content in batches of 16 Bytes, and pauses during LCD scanning.</li></ul><p>Once more, these units offer programmers new possibilities to provide richer content, as they take advantage of periods originally left for idling.</p><hr><h2 id="audio">Audio</h2><p>The audio system is carried out by the <strong>Audio Processing Unit</strong> (APU), a <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/master-system/#audio">PSG chip</a> with four channels <sup id="bibref:12"><a href="#bib:audio-wiki" role="doc-biblioref">[12]</a></sup>.</p><p>Curiously enough, this is one of the few sections that hasn’t evolved on either model.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://github.com/macos-fuse-t/fuse-t">https://github.com/macos-fuse-t/fuse-t</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38775579">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-target="readme-toc.content">
            <article itemprop="text"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Abstract</h2>
<p dir="auto">FUSE-T is a kext-less implementation of FUSE for macOS that uses NFS v4 local server instead of a kernel extension.<br>
The main motivation is to replace 'macfuse' project (<a href="https://osxfuse.github.io/" rel="nofollow">https://osxfuse.github.io/</a>) that implements its own kext to make fuse work.
With each version of macOS it's getting harder and harder to load kernel extensions. Apple strongly discourages it thus making software distributions that use 'macfuse' difficult to install. Additionally, the 'macfuse' kext is unstable, may cause frequent system crashes and kernel lock-ups. Given those limitations many software publishers are unable to use 'macfuse' project anymore.</p>
<p dir="auto">FUSE-T doesn't make use of kernel extension, it implements its own userspace server that converts between FUSE protocol and NFS and let macOS mount NFS volume instead of a kernel filesystem.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">The main features of FUSE-T</h2>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Drop-in replacement for 'macfuse' (<a href="https://osxfuse.github.io/" rel="nofollow">https://osxfuse.github.io/</a>). API headers in libfuse are unchanged so there's no need to change anything in filesystem implementation. The APIs are compatible with 'macfuse' but differ from the Linux version of libfuse and this is because the 'macfuse' project was not updated in sync with the Linux version</li>
<li>Kext-less, no kernel extensions needed</li>
<li>NFSv4 protocol to better support macOS features such as extended attributes, file locks and others</li>
<li>Stable, easy to mount and unmount volumes with macOS built-in tools, no need for proprietary fusermount</li>
<li>Performance, FUSE-T offers much better performance and this is due to excellent macOS client side NFSv4 implementation</li>
</ul>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">How FUSE-T works</h2>
<p dir="auto">When a filesystem issues a mount API call, libfuse launches a FUSE-T NFS server that exposes a local TCP port to the macOS mount proccess and another communication channel to libfuse. After that a macOS mount_nfs command is executed and NFS rpcs are getting called on the server.
The server converts NFS rpc calls into FUSE requests that emulate original kernel-libfuse protocol. Those requests are executed in libfuse and corresponding FUSE filesystem, then the result is converted back to the macOS NFS client.
After the filesystem process dies the NFS server terminates as well and it also unmounts the NFS folder mounted previously.</p>

They might then administer another treatment, such as chemo or radiation therapy, to kill any cancer cells they missed.</p><p>Even if a person is cancer-free after this, there’s always a chance of the melanoma coming back, and certain types are considered <a href="https://www.aimatmelanoma.org/after-treatment/what-is-recurrence/">high-risk for recurrence</a>, including ones that are particularly thick or that had metastasized (spread to other parts of the body) prior to treatment.&nbsp;</p><blockquote>
<p> “This is a pretty significant improvement, a pretty dramatic improvement over standard of care.”</p>
<cite>Stephen Hoge</cite></blockquote><p><strong>The </strong><strong>cancer vaccine</strong><strong>:</strong> Moderna and pharma giant Merck are developing an mRNA-based cancer vaccine, mRNA-4157 (V940), for people who’ve had high-risk melanomas removed.</p><p>The vaccine works by instructing the body to make up to 34 “neoantigens.” These are proteins found only on the cancer cells, and Moderna personalizes the vaccine for each recipient so that it carries instructions for the neoantigens on <em>their</em> cancer cells.</p><p>The idea behind the vaccine is that, by prompting the body to make these proteins, it can prepare the immune system to quickly identify and attack any new cancer cells bearing them, preventing recurrence.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What’s new? </strong>In the ongoing phase 2b KEYNOTE-942 study, Moderna and Merck are comparing the cancer vaccine’s ability to prevent melanoma recurrence or death when combined with Keytruda, Merck’s FDA-approved cancer treatment, to Keytruda alone.</p><p>In 2022, they reported that the <a href="https://www.freethink.com/health/mrna-cancer-vaccine">combo therapy</a> reduced high-risk patients’ risk of recurrence or death by 44% compared to only Keytruda in the two years after treatment.</p><p>They’ve now <a href="https://investors.modernatx.com/news/news-details/2023/Moderna-And-Merck-Announce-mRNA-4157-V940-In-Combination-with-KeytrudaR-Pembrolizumab-Demonstrated-Continued-Improvement-in-Recurrence-Free-Survival-and-Distant-Metastasis-Free-Survival-in-Patients-with-High-Risk-Stage-IIIIV-Melanoma-Following-Comple/default.aspx">announced</a> that people who received both therapies were 49% less likely to experience recurrence or death a median of three years after treatment compared to people in the Keytruda-only group. They were also 62% less likely to experience distant metastasis or death.</p><p>“The durability of the responses is really strong — they’re essentially rock solid through this time,” Moderna President Stephen Hoge <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/benefits-moderna-merck-melanoma-vaccine-plus-keytruda-extend-three-years-2023-12-14/">told Reuters</a>. “This is a pretty significant improvement, a pretty dramatic improvement over standard of care with just Keytruda alone.”</p><figure><blockquote><p>“We think that in some countries the product could be launched under accelerated approval by 2025.”</p><cite>Stephane Bancel</cite></blockquote></figure><p><strong>Looking ahead:</strong> The KEYNOTE-942 study is relatively small, with just 157 participants, but Moderna and Merck have already <a href="https://investors.modernatx.com/news/news-details/2023/Merck-and-Moderna-Initiate-Phase-3-Study-Evaluating-V940-mRNA-4157-in-Combination-with-KEYTRUDA-pembrolizumab-for-Adjuvant-Treatment-of-Patients-with-Resected-High-Risk-Stage-IIB-IV-Melanoma/default.aspx">launched a phase 3 trial</a> for the combination cancer therapy that will include more than 1,000 people with high-risk melanoma.</p><p>The companies are also looking beyond melanoma, <a href="https://investors.modernatx.com/news/news-details/2023/Merck-and-Moderna-Initiate-INTerpath-002-a-Phase-3-Study-Evaluating-V940-mRNA-4157-in-Combination-with-KEYTRUDA-pembrolizumab-for-Adjuvant-Treatment-of-Patients-with-Certain-Types-of-Resected-Non-Small-Cell-Lung-Cancer-/default.aspx">launching</a> a phase 3 trial testing the cancer vaccine in people with non-small cell lung cancer — and if these trials go well, it might not be long before the personalized therapy reaches patients.</p><p>“We think that in some countries the product could be launched under accelerated approval by 2025,” Moderna CEO Stephane Bancel <a href="https://www.barrons.com/news/moderna-ceo-says-melanoma-vaccine-could-be-available-by-2025-32ee9605">told AFP</a>.</p><p><em>We’d love to hear from you!

    </div><p>The reintroduction of wolves in Colorado this month will proceed as planned after a federal judge on Friday 15 Dec. denied ranchers' request to stop the state's efforts to allow for further environmental analysis.</p>


										      
																																	<p>U.S. District Judge Regina Rodriguez denied a request by the Colorado Cattlemen's Association and Gunnison County Stockgrowers' Association to halt the reintroduction of the controversial canines, finding it "contrary to the public's interest in seeing <a href="https://phys.org/tags/gray+wolves/" rel="tag">gray wolves</a> released in Colorado."</p>
<p>Voters approved the reintroduction in 2020, and <a href="https://phys.org/tags/wolves/" rel="tag">wolves</a> could be on the ground in Colorado as early as Monday.</p>
<p>The request for the delay was filed as part of a federal <a href="https://phys.org/tags/lawsuit/" rel="tag">lawsuit</a> the two ranching groups filed Monday against Colorado Parks and Wildlife and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. The lawsuit alleges the government agencies violated the National Environmental Policy Act by failing to prepare an environmental impact statement about the wolves while renewing a cooperative agreement between the two agencies about conserving <a href="https://phys.org/tags/endangered+species/" rel="tag">endangered species</a>.</p>
<p>But Rodriguez found the agencies did comply with the National Environmental Policy Act through "extensive public involvement," including several opportunities for public comment and peer review.</p>
<p>"While the Petitioners who have lived and worked on the land for many years are understandably concerned about possible impacts of this reintroduction, neither these possible impacts nor their assertions under the Administrative Procedures Act are sufficient for this Court to grant the extraordinary relief they seek," Rodriguez wrote in the ruling, which was published late Friday.</p>

																																						
																																			<p>The lawsuit and subsequent filings by the livestock groups asked to halt the reintroduction, which is mandated to take place by the end of 2023. The cattlemen's lawsuit alleges the reintroduction could harm the endangered Gunnison sage grouse populations and kill or stress cattle.</p>
<p>Andrew Spann, president of the Gunnison County Stockgrowers' Association, testified during a court hearing Thursday that he wants to see an analysis of how the eventual population of hundreds of wolves would affect the lands, recreation and economies of Colorado.</p>
<p>"This issue is not just producers worried about their cows being killed. … This about what are the impacts and how are we going to address those going forward," Spann said.</p>
<p>But potential harm to sage grouse or cattle does not rise to the level of irreparable harm that would cause the court to intervene, Rodriguez wrote in the ruling.</p>
<p>"To satisfy its burden of proving irreparable harm, the party seeking injunctive relief must show that the harm is 'certain and great' and not speculative," Rodriguez wrote. "Here, Petitioners have not presented evidence demonstrating that harm will occur if their requested relief is not granted, nor have they demonstrated such harm, if it did occur, would be irreparable."</p>
<p>During the Thursday hearing, Lisa Reynolds, attorney for Colorado Parks and Wildlife, said the ranchers' lawsuit was a "last-ditch effort" to halt the reintroduction, which has been in the works since voters in 2020 approved the reintroduction.</p>

																																			<p>"Now, at the eleventh hour they want to put a halt to the three-year plan for reintroduction under the guise of a need for more study and analysis," Reynolds said.</p>
<p>Attorneys for Colorado Parks and Wildlife and the Fish and Wildlife Service on Thursday argued that they did not need to conduct an environmental impact review to renew the cooperative agreement, which has been in place for decades. The federal agency has never prepared an environmental impact statement when renewing similar legal agreements across the country, said Brian Herman, attorney for the Fish and Wildlife Service.</p>
<p>Further, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service did conduct an environmental impact review for the reintroduction of wolves, although under a different federal process, Herman said. The service analyzed the environmental impact of reintroducing wolves while preparing the federal 10(j) rule that will allow for the killing or hazing of wolves in certain circumstances.</p>
<p>Wildlife advocacy groups slammed the lawsuit, calling it "ridiculous," "flimsy" and a "red herring."</p>
<p>"For the past three years, the concerns of ranchers and livestock owners have been elevated in painstaking and deliberate state and federal processes," Lindsay Larris, <a href="https://phys.org/tags/wildlife/" rel="tag">wildlife</a> program director for WildEarth Guardians, said in a statement. "Government officials have bent over backward to accommodate this special interest, but apparently, nothing but the complete absence of wolves on the landscape will be enough."</p>

																																						
																																			<p>Although Rodriguez denied the request to delay the reintroduction, the lawsuit will proceed in federal court, along with another lawsuit filed against the reintroduction.</p>
<p>Conservation groups, including the Center for Biological Diversity and Defenders of Wildlife, praised the court order in statements Friday.</p>
<p>"I'm relieved that the court saw right through the livestock industry's self-serving and meritless arguments," said Alli Henderson, southern Rockies director at the Center for Biological Diversity, in a statement. "Both science and Colorado voters have very clearly told us that wolves belong here. Once wolves are reintroduced, they'll help restore balance to our state's ecosystems."</p>
<p>Colorado Conservation Alliance and two of its <a href="https://phys.org/tags/board+members/" rel="tag">board members</a> on Thursday sued the Fish and Wildlife Service and Colorado Parks and Wildlife in federal court alleging the environmental impact statement completed for the 10(j) rule was insufficient. The analysis did not look at potential impacts to the endangered Mexican wolf and did not adequately look at how wolves might affect deer, elk and other prey, the lawsuit states.</p>
<p>The lawsuit asks the judge to halt the reintroduction until a more thorough environmental impact statement is completed. A hearing has not yet been set in that lawsuit, nor have the two <a href="https://phys.org/tags/government+agencies/" rel="tag">government agencies</a> filed legal responses to the lawsuit.</p>

    </div><p>Patients are more likely to fall, get new infections, or experience other forms of harm during their stay in a hospital after it is acquired by a private equity firm, according to a new study led by researchers at Harvard Medical School.</p>

                                        
                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                    <p>The research, <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/10.1001/jama.2023.23147?guestAccessKey=e0cef9be-d55c-4bcf-8892-412af8f24355">published</a> Dec. 26 in <i>JAMA</i>, is among a handful of recent nationwide analyses of how <a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/private+equity/" rel="tag">private equity</a> takeovers affect the quality of patient care in hospitals. The increases are seen in conditions or outcomes deemed preventable and are key measures of hospital safety and quality.</p>
<p>The findings come amid growing concerns about private <a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/equity/" rel="tag">equity</a>'s increasing role in U.S. health care, with <a href="https://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/explainer/2023/nov/private-equity-role-health-care">$1 trillion invested in the past decade</a>.</p>
<p>"We had previously found that private equity acquisitions led to higher charges, prices, and societal spending," said Zirui Song, associate professor of health care policy and medicine in the Blavatnik Institute and director of research in the Center for Primary Care at HMS. "Now, we're learning that there are also downstream concerns for the clinical quality of care delivered to <a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/hospital+patients/" rel="tag">hospital patients</a>."</p>
<p>The researchers said the findings are alarming because they may reflect bottom-line incentives overshadowing patient care and safety.</p>
<p>"Hospital success is measured not only in dollars or the number of patients who pass through the doors, but also in lives saved, complication rates, patient satisfaction, and a number of other quality and safety metrics," said HMS research fellow Sneha Kannan, a physician in the Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care at Massachusetts General Hospital. "We need to make sure we fully understand the costs and benefits of this prominent new force in health care."</p>
<p>The economic repercussions of private equity acquisitions are not a new concern. Previous studies by Song and co-author Joseph Dov Bruch of the University of Chicago indicate that this high-debt, for-profit financial model of hospital ownership may also lead <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2769549">to increased spending</a> and <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama-health-forum/fullarticle/2795946">other economic implications</a>. Many have expressed concerns about hospital bankruptcies under private equity ownership that often leave underserved populations with limited access to care. But up until now, the effects of private equity deals on <a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/382/bmj-2023-075244">patient health and quality of care</a> have remained understudied and poorly understood.</p>

                                                                                                        <!-- Google middle Adsense block -->
    
                                                                                                                                            <h2>Why private equity is different</h2>
<p>"When health systems buy hospitals, they generally do not use borrowed money," said Song, who is also an internal medicine physician at Mass General. "In contrast, the classic private equity buyout uses a small amount of cash, but a large amount of debt."</p>
<p>A <a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/private+equity+firm/" rel="tag">private equity firm</a> raises some capital from investors and borrows the rest, putting debt on the acquired hospital with its physical assets, such as land and buildings, as collateral for the loan. The acquired hospital must then generate revenue to pay down that debt.</p>
<p>Private equity generates revenue by charging management fees to its investors—commonly, pension funds, endowments, and other institutions or individuals—as well as by focusing on high-revenue procedures, cost-cutting, reorganization, and financial engineering.</p>
<p>One argument in favor of private equity investments is that many struggling hospitals need capital and management expertise. However, most private equity buyouts are of successful operations. Private equity firms want to buy going concerns that are able to take on debt and generate revenue in the short run. These <a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/financial+pressures/" rel="tag">financial pressures</a> can create perverse incentives favoring profit over patients, the researchers say.</p>

                                                                                                                                            <h2>Private equity and quality of care</h2>
<p>For this study, the researchers examined insurance claims data for all fee-for-service Medicare hospitalizations from 2009 to 2019, totaling more than 600,000 hospitalizations at 51 private equity hospitals and more than 4 million hospitalizations at 259 similar hospitals not acquired by private equity. The hospitals not acquired by private equity served as the control group to control for other factors that may have affected outcomes.</p>
<p>The researchers compared how often patients experienced certain outcomes before and after the hospital was acquired by private equity. For example, they looked at how often patients fell while in the hospital or how often they developed an infection after a procedure or a surgery. The team also analyzed the makeup of the patient populations and various other outcomes such as how often patients died, how long they stayed at the hospital, and how often they ended up readmitted after leaving the hospital.</p>
<p>After a hospital was acquired by private equity, admitted Medicare patients had a 25% increase in hospital-acquired complications, compared with patients admitted before acquisition. Patients also had 27% more falls and 38% more bloodstream infections caused by central lines, which are temporary surgically inserted ports that allow easy intravenous access for patients receiving repeated drug infusions or other treatments.</p>
<p>The increase was seen despite private equity hospitals' placing 16% fewer central lines than before the buyout. All of these results were calculated while taking into account changes, trends, and patterns over the same period of time at peer hospitals not owned by private equity to isolate the differences that were due to the change in ownership.</p>
<p>Curiously, the study found a small drop in hospital deaths at private equity hospitals. This, the researchers said, may be due to social and demographic factors—private equity patients were younger and less disadvantaged than those at peer hospitals not owned by private equity. It may also be due to patients getting transferred more often out of private equity hospitals. When the researchers followed patients longer after discharge, the small decrease in deaths dissipated within a month after leaving the hospital.</p>

                                                                                                        <!-- Google middle Adsense block -->
    
                                                                                                                                            <h2>Framework for policy solutions</h2>
<p>Policymakers, insurance companies, and public sector bodies have grown increasingly concerned about protecting patients and societal resources from the effects of private equity transactions.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Song and Christopher Cai, a HMS clinical fellow in medicine at Brigham and Women's Hospital, outlined <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2804025">such a policy framework</a> in a <i>JAMA</i> viewpoint article, which included regulating fraud and abuse, increasing antitrust oversight, reducing moral hazard (such as by lowering the debt used in acquisitions), protecting against inflated prices, and transparency in reporting of private equity acquisitions.</p>
<p>Currently, only private equity acquisitions over $111.4 million must be reported. This threshold may capture many hospital acquisitions but leaves out most acquisitions of physician practices.</p>
<p>"Private equity firms have historically operated in the shadows in health care," Kannan said. "Going forward, it's important to lift the veil and increase transparency."</p>
<p>And both researchers and policymakers should be rigorous in their efforts to understand how private equity changes health care operations and the downstream consequences, the authors cautioned.</p>
<p>"Patients and providers, investors and taxpayers, employers and insurers, all have a stake in this," Song said. "Understanding what the corporatization of health care delivery means is a goal shared by many across society."</p>

<p>Apple is banned from selling the Watch Series 9 and Watch Ultra 2 in the US after President Joe Biden’s administration refused to grant a reprieve from a trade tribunal’s decision that it had infringed another company’s patents.</p>
<p>Apple confirmed on Tuesday it had appealed against the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/10/apple-watch-facing-potential-ban-after-losing-masimo-patent-case/">earlier ruling from the US International Trade Commission</a>, which stems from a patent dispute with health technology company Masimo.</p>
<p>Biden’s administration had 60 days from the ITC decision, which was handed down in October, to decide whether to allow it to take effect. The authority to decide whether to intervene was delegated by the White House to the US trade representative, Katherine Tai.</p>
<p>“After careful consultations, Ambassador Tai decided not to reverse the ITC’s determination and the ITC’s decision became final on December 26 2023,” Tai’s office said in a statement on Tuesday.</p>
<p>In a statement, Apple said it strongly disagreed with the ITC’s decision and exclusion order and was “taking all measures to return Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Ultra 2 to customers in the US as soon as possible.”</p>
<p>Ahead of a final decision from the White House, Apple had said it would preemptively halt sales of the affected models in the US on its website from December 21, and in physical stores from December 24.</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>It is exceptionally rare for the White House to wade into such cases, although the Obama administration vetoed a patent ban on iPhones and iPads in 2013 during the company’s legal dispute with Samsung.</p>
<p>The ruling deals a blow to Apple, which is already facing a slowdown in hardware sales this year. Earlier models of the Apple Watch remain available in the US, and Apple says the ban will have no impact on service for customers who have already bought the new models.</p>
<p>The case stems from a legal dispute between Apple and Irvine, California-headquartered Masimo over patents on the technology for measuring blood oxygen levels on the devices. The method, known as pulse oximetry, measures oxygen in the blood by shining light into the wrist.</p>
<p>Apple first introduced the technology in 2020, in an effort to draw in more consumers and give them the incentive to upgrade with new features on the device. Masimo said Apple copied its patented technology.</p>
<p>The US International Trade Commission ruled in Masimo’s favor, issuing a “limited exclusion order” against Apple’s products.</p>
<p>Masimo has separately sued Apple in federal court alleging trade secret violations. A trial in that case ended with a hung jury in May.</p>
<p>Apple is similarly embroiled in litigation with medical wearables company AliveCor over the heart rate monitoring technology on its watches. In December 2022 the ITC upheld a judge’s ruling that Apple violated AliveCor’s patents.</p>
<p>But that same month, the US Patent Trial and Appeal Board invalidated the AliveCor patents at the center of the dispute, putting any potential ban on hold pending appeals.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/12/26/thermal_management_is_changing/">https://www.theregister.com/2023/12/26/thermal_management_is_changing/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38772980">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p><span>Analysis</span> As Moore's Law slowed to a crawl, chips, particularly those used in AI and high-performance computing (HPC), have steadily gotten hotter. In 2023 we saw accelerators enter the kilowatt range with the arrival of Nvidia's GH200 Superchips.</p>
<p>We've known these chips would be hot for a while now – Nvidia has been teasing the CPU-GPU <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/08/09/nvidia_gracehopper_hbm3e/">franken-chip</a> for the better part of two years. What we didn't know until recently is how OEMs and systems builders would respond to such a power-dense part. Would most of the systems be liquid cooled? Or, would most stick to air cooling? How many of these accelerators would they try to cram into a single box, and how big would the box be?</p>
<p>Now that the first systems based on the GH200 make their way to market, it's become clear that form factor is very much being dictated by power density than anything else. It essentially boils down to how much surface area you have to dissipate the heat.</p>

    

<p>Dig through the systems available today from Supermicro, Gigabyte, QCT, Pegatron, HPE, and others and you'll quickly notice a trend. Up to about 500 W per rack unit (RU) – 1 kW in the case of Supermicro's MGX <a target="_blank" href="https://www.supermicro.com/en/accelerators/nvidia/mgx" rel="nofollow">ARS-111GL-NHR</a> – these systems are largely air cooled. While hot, it's still a manageable thermal load to dissipate, working out to about 21-24 kW per rack. That's well within the power delivery and thermal management capacity of modern datacenters, especially those making use of rear door heat exchangers.</p>

        


        

<p>However, this changes when system builders start cramming more than a kilowatt of accelerators into each chassis. At this point most of the OEM systems we looked at switched to direct liquid cooling. Gigabyte's <a target="_blank" href="https://www.gigabyte.com/Enterprise/High-Density-Server/H263-V11-rev-LAW1" rel="nofollow">H263-V11</a>, for example, offers up to four GH200 nodes in a single 2U chassis.</p>
<p>That's two kilowatts per rack unit. So while a system like Nvidia's air-cooled DGX H100 with its eight 700 W H100s and twin Sapphire Rapids CPUs has a higher TDP at 10.2 kW, it's actually less power dense at 1.2 kW/RU.</p>

        

<p>There are a couple advantages to liquid cooling beyond a more efficient transfer of heat from these densely packed accelerators. The higher the system power is, the more static pressure and air flow you need to remove the heat from the system. This means using hotter, faster fans that use more power – potentially as much as 20 percent of system power in some cases.</p>
<p>Beyond about 500 W per rack unit, most of the OEMs and ODMs seem to be opting for liquid cooled chassis as fewer, slower fans are required to cool lower-power components like NICs, storage, and other peripherals.</p>
<p>You only have to look at HPE's Cray EX254n blades to see just how much a liquid-cooled chassis has. That platform can <a target="_blank" href="https://www.hpe.com/us/en/newsroom/press-release/2023/11/hewlett-packard-enterprise-and-nvidia-accelerate-ai-training-with-new-turnkey-solution.html" rel="nofollow">support</a> up to four GH200s. That's potentially 4 kW in a 1U compute blade and that's not even counting the NICs used to keep the chips fed with data.</p>

        

<p>Of course, the folks at HPE's Cray division do know a thing or two about cooling ultra-dense compute components. It does, however, illustrate the amount of thought systems builders put into their servers, not just at a systems level but at the rack level.</p>
<h3>Rack level takes off</h3>
<p>As we mentioned before with the Nvidia DGX H100 systems, cooling a multi-kilowatt server on its own is something OEMs are well acquainted with. But as soon as you try and fill a rack with these systems, things become a bit more complicated with factors like rack power and facility cooling coming into play.</p>
<p>We dove into the challenges that datacenter operators like Digital Reality have had to overcome in order to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nextplatform.com/2023/05/30/mgx-nvidia-standardizes-multi-generation-server-designs/">support dense deployments of these kinds of systems</a> over on our sibling publication <em>The Next Platform</em>.</p>
<p>In many cases, the colocation provider needed to rework its power and cooling infrastructure to support 40-plus kilowatts of power and heat required to pack four of these DGX H100 systems into a single rack.</p>
<p>But if your datacenter or colocation provider can't supply that kind of power rack or contend with the heat, there's not much sense in trying to make these system's this dense when most of the rack is going to sit empty.</p>

</ul>
<p>With the launch of the GH200, we've seen Nvidia focus less on the individual systems and more on rack-scale deployments. We caught our first glimpse of this during Computex this spring with its DGX GH200 cluster.</p>
<p>Rather than a bunch of dense GPU-packed nodes, the system is actually <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/05/29/nvidia_dgx_gh200_nvlink/">comprised</a> of 256 2U nodes each with a single GH200 accelerator inside. Combined, the system is capable of pumping out an exaFLOPS of FP8 performance, but should be much easier to deploy at a facilities level. Instead of 1.2 kW/RU now you're looking at closer to 500 W/RU, which is right about where most OEMs are landing with their own air-cooled systems.</p>
<p>More recently we've seen Nvidia condense a smaller version of this down to a single rack with the GH200-NVL32 <a target="_blank" href="https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/one-giant-superchip-for-llms-recommenders-and-gnns-introducing-nvidia-gh200-nvl32/" rel="nofollow">announced</a> in <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/11/28/aws_graviton_trainium/">collaboration with AWS at Re:Invent this fall</a>.</p>
<p>That system packs 16 1U chassis, each equipped with two GH200 nodes, into a single rack and meshes them together using nine NVLink switch trays. Needless to say, at 2 kW/RU of compute these are dense little systems and thus were designed to be liquid cooled from the get-go.</p>
<h3>Hotter chips on the way</h3>
<p>While we've focused on Nvidia's Grace Hopper Superchips, the chipmaker is hardly the only one pushing TDPs to new limits in pursuit of performance and efficiency.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, AMD <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/12/06/amd_mi300_gpu/">spilled</a> the tea on its latest AI and HPC GPUs and APUs, which see the company's Instinct accelerators jump from 560 W last gen to as high as 760 W. That's still not the kilowatt of power demanded by the GH200, but it's a sizable increase.</p>
<p>More importantly, AMD CTO Mark Papermaster <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/12/08/amd_cto_interview/">told</a> <em>The Register</em> that there's still plenty of headroom to push TDPs even higher over the next few years.</p>
<p>Whether this will eventually drive chipmakers to mandate liquid cooling for their flagship parts remains unanswered. According to Papermaster, AMD is going to support air and liquid cooling on their platforms. But as we've seen with AMD's new MI300A APU, continuing to opt for air cooling will almost certainly mean performance concessions.</p>
<p>The MI300A is nominally rated for 550 W. That's far less than the 850 W we'd been led to believe it'd suck down under load, but given adequate cooling, it can run even hotter. In an HPC-tuned system, like those developed by HPE, Eviden (Atos), or Lenovo, the chip can be configured to run at 760 W.</p>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>The first step in building my text editor is to implement the core API. If you’re wondering why I want to do this, the original article is <a href="https://www.averylaird.com/programming/2017/09/22/the-text-editor/">here</a>.</p>

<p>I researched several data types, and I tried to be <em>language agnostic</em>. I wanted my decision to not be influenced by any particular language, and first see if there was a “best way” out there, solely based on operations. Of course, a “best way” rarely exists. However, in the case of text manipulation and storage, there are some clear “worst ways” and “better ways.”</p>

<h2 id="the-worst-way">The Worst Way</h2>

<p>The worst way to store and manipulate text is to use an array. Firstly, the entire file must be loaded into the array first, which raises issues with time and memory. Even worse still, every insertion and deletion requires each element in the array to be moved. There are more downsides, but already this method is clearly not practical. The array can be dismissed as an option rather quickly.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>By the way: this isn’t a challenge. Please don’t try to find worse ways to manipulate text.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="a-good-way">A Good Way</h2>

<p>Another option is a binary tree structure called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rope_(data_structure)">rope</a>. Skip to the <a href="#a-rope">next section</a> if binary trees aren’t your thing.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you are unfamiliar with binary trees, check out <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_tree">this</a> as a starting point.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Basically, the string is split into sections, and stored in the leaves. The weight of each leaf is the length of the string segment. The weight of each non-leaf node is the total length of the strings on its left subtree. For example, in the diagram<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> below, node \(E\) is a leaf with a string segment \(6\) characters long. Therefore, it has a weight of \(6\), as well as its parent node. However, node \(B\) has a weight of \(9\), because nodes \(E\) and \(F\) together have a length of \(9\).</p>

<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/8986fc0e21194eb3f0a009ef73b3ebffc159ee68/2bf14/static/rope-data-structure.png" alt="Source: Wikipedia, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rope_(data_structure)"></p>

<p>This is a lot more efficient than an array. A rope has two main operations, <code>Split</code> and <code>Concat</code> (concatenation). <code>Split</code> splits one string into two strings at a given index, and <code>Concat</code> concatenates two strings into one. You can preform either an insert or delete with either of these two basic operations. To insert characters, you can split the string once (where you want to insert the content) and concatenate it twice (on either side of the inserted content). Deletions work similarly, by splitting the string twice, and concatenating them again without including the deleted content.</p>

<p>There’s a big downside. Using a rope is quite confusing and complicated. It’s difficult to explain even in an abstract manner. Working out the kinks in real life, while still making the code maintainable and readable, seems like a nightmare. What’s more, it still uses a lot of space. It didn’t seem like the best option yet, so I kept looking.</p>

<h2 id="a-better-way">A Better Way</h2>

<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gap_buffer">Gap Buffer</a> is much simpler than the rope. The idea is this: operations on text are often localized. Most of the time, we’re not jumping all over the document. So, we create a “gap” between characters stored in an array. We keep track of how large the gap is by using pointers or array indices. Let’s examine two cases (using pointers):</p>

<dl>
  <dt><strong>Insertion</strong></dt>
  <dd>The gap is a certain size to begin with. We copy over the inserted content, and if it exceeds the size of the gap, we expand the gap.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
  <dt><strong>Deletion</strong></dt>
  <dd>We shift the pointers of the gap to include the deleted content.</dd>
</dl>

<p>This is makes a lot of sense. We are plagued somewhat by the same issues as an array; under certain circumstances, if we move too far from the gap, every element in the array will have to be moved. However, it’s most likely that this is a rare occurrence for the average user. It is quite possible that the speed gained with most operations will outweigh the inefficiency of certain edge cases. In fact, the editor I’m writing this in – <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">Emacs</a> – uses a gap buffer, and it’s probably the fastest editor I’ve ever used. That fact alone is a pretty convincing argument to use a gap buffer. But if I’m starting from scratch, I want every aspect of the software to be the best option there is. And maybe there’s a better(est) way.</p>

<h2 id="the-betterest-way">The Better(est) Way</h2>

<p>A couple months ago, <a href="https://www.rosslaird.com/">my Dad</a> asked me for help with a problem. He was converting one of <a href="https://www.rosslaird.com/stones-throw/">his books</a> to markdown, and there was an issue with the footnotes. In markdown, footnotes do not automatically number themselves<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>; they need to be labelled with either a number or some text, like this: <code>[^1]</code> or <code>[^footnote]</code>. The definition is the same, with a colon at the end.</p>

<p>He had used pandoc to mostly convert the document, but every footnote had the format <code>[^#]</code>. It was my job to make a script to replace every <code>#</code> with a number, starting from \(1\).</p>

<p>Easy, right?</p>

<p>Well, that’s what I thought. I whipped up a regex, scanned through the document, and replaced all occurrences of the pattern with an increasing integer. And, it spat out garbage.</p>

<p>Why? Because I had made a really, really obvious mistake. The counter doesn’t always take up the same amount of space. The script kept overwriting content, and the offset grew larger the more footnotes were replaced. There’s a simple fix: keep track of how much more space you take up, and add that to your current position in the document. I made that one simple change, and everything worked perfectly. Without knowing it at the time, I had used a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piece_table">Piece Table</a>.</p>

<p>The Wikipedia page for the Piece Table is only 8 lines long (Yikes!) Even more concerning, it mentions Microsoft Word among the examples of editors that use piece tables. However, the piece table is a very promising structure. What’s more, at its conception Word was lightning fast with infinite redo/undo, as explained in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160308183811/http://1017.songtrellisopml.com/whatsbeenwroughtusingpiecetables">this interesting article</a> by a Microsoft developer. If you have the time, it’s a cool read.</p>

<p>In 1998, Charles Crowley wrote <a href="https://www.cs.unm.edu/~crowley/papers/sds.pdf">a paper</a> investigating the pros and cons of various data structures used in text editors. His paper includes the structures we covered, like gap buffers, arrays, and ropes. He concluded that – from a basis of speed, simplicity, and structure – the piece table was the leading method. From my point of view, the piece table is also the most elegant solution.</p>

<p>We need two buffers: the original file (read-only), and a new file that will contain all of our added text (append-only). Lastly, we have a table that has three columns: file, start, length. This is which file to use (original or new), where the text segment starts in each file (pre-edit), and the length of the segment. Here’s an example:</p>

<div><pre><code>Original File: A_large_span_of_text   (underscores denote spaces)
New File:      English_

File           Start         Length
-----------------------------------
Original           0              2
Original           8              8
New                0              8
Original          16              4

Sequence: A_span_of_English_text
</code></pre></div>

<p>Keep in mind that the <code>Start</code> index is <em>not relative</em> to previous edits. This is something that gets handled at runtime by adding the length of each previous edit (like what I did to fix my footnote script). Since the length is already included in the table, this is a trivial step.</p>

<p>I like this solution the most because:</p>

<ol>
  <li>It’s <strong>elegant</strong>. Only the minimal amount of information is recorded.</li>
  <li>It’s <strong>simple</strong>. We run through the table, and do the necessary operations. We don’t need to re-balance or traverse a binary tree.</li>
  <li>It’s <strong>fast</strong>. This solution has the <em>potential</em> to be lightning fast. There are some additional optimizations to take into account, which are explained in detail <a href="http://www.catch22.net/tuts/piece-chains">here</a></li>
</ol>

<p>The piece table method certainly has its complications, and there are different variations in implementation. It is certainly a daunting task. I’m going to see how far I get. Another article will accompany my attempts to implement the piece table method.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
			
			<h2>Shiny new things</h2>
<p>Introducing a brand new editor for Markdown tables. Table rows and columns are now easier to create, edit, sort, reorder, select, copy, and paste. These new table features can also be accessed via context menu, command palette, and hotkeys. Tables are still saved to plain text Markdown.</p>

<p>To add a table to a note, right click and choose <em>Insert → Table</em>, or use the command palette.</p>
<p>Once you insert a table, you can add new columns and rows by clicking on the sides of the table. Add text with inline formatting. Press <code>tab</code> to navigate between cells.</p>
<h2>Improvements</h2>
<h3>Properties</h3>
<ul>
<li>Properties can now be renamed globally. Renaming will cause the property to be modified in each corresponding file and the search is case-insensitive.</li>
<li>Global Search: Search now works with non-string property values. Search for boolean values <code>[property:TRUE]</code> or <code>[property:FALSE]</code> or empty values <code>[property:EMPTY]</code>. You can also use inequality operators to search for things like <code>[some_property:&gt;10]</code>.</li>
<li>Global properties view can now be filtered.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Editing experience</h3>
<ul>
<li>New formatting menu. You can now right click in the editor to change text formatting, paragraph styles, and insert elements such as lists and tables.</li>
<li>Right-click on a callout to quickly change the callout type from a list of default callout type options.</li>
<li>Pressing <code>Tab</code> when the <code>#</code> autocomplete is active will autocomplete the highlighted suggestion. If the highlighted suggestion has a <code>/</code> in it, like "#projects/in-review", <code>Tab</code> will autocomplete by <em>segment</em>, so "#projects" then press again to get "/in-review".</li>
</ul>
<h3>Sync</h3>
<ul>
<li>When viewing the version history for a file, changes made by the same user on the same device will now be grouped together. And Markdown will be rendered to more closely match reading mode.</li>
<li>Number of vaults has increased from 5 to 10</li>
<li>Maximum file size has increased from 100MB to 200MB</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://github.com/obsidianmd/obsidian-help/assets/10565871/bf2334dd-6add-4dfa-9adb-67ff183746ec" alt="Sync version history"></p>
<h3>Quality of life</h3>
<ul>
<li>The Outline view now has a "collapse all" button as well as a search field for filtering the list of headings in the file.</li>
<li>Files from outside Obsidian can now be dropped anywhere in the File Explorer pane instead of on top of the vault name. Similarly, dropping a file on top of any item in a folder will cause the file to get imported into that particular folder.</li>
<li>Pressing <code>Ctrl/Command-F</code> in any view with a search input (including Backlinks or Properties) will now focus the search input.</li>
<li>Menu options within the <code>...</code> pane menu (the <code>...</code> in the tab header) as well as the tab menu (right clicking on a tab) have been cleaned up and should now show more relevant options.</li>
<li>Copy, cut, and paste items in the Bookmarks view (works via hotkey only currently).</li>
<li>Bookmarks: Removed the "Bookmark this block..." context menu item.</li>
<li>Added new "Show trash" command to open the .trash folder in filesystem.</li>
<li>The Appearance section in settings has been reordered for clarity.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Onboarding</h3>
<ul>
<li>Obsidian will now use the system setting for light or dark mode by default, you can change this in Appearance settings.</li>
<li>Improved the experience when creating a new vault from scratch. If you select "Create new vault," the created vault will include a <code>welcome.md</code> file and show a side-by-side view with the Graph view.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Bug fixes</h3>
<ul>
<li>The active context menu is now automatically dismissed when the view navigates away or a modal appears.</li>
<li>Clicking 'New file' on an empty tab should open the new file in the current tab instead of creating a new one.</li>
<li>Properties: Fixed issue where properties view sometimes displayed a stale value when switching between files.</li>
<li>Properties: Fixed bug where pressing the left arrow key (<code>←</code>) the start the input would cause the input to blur.</li>
<li>Word count and character count status bar items now ignore frontmatter.</li>
<li>Bookmarks: Fixed several edge cases where drag and drop would fail to work, including dragging an item to the bottom of the bookmark list.</li>
<li>Fixed bug where canceling a drag would not cause the actively hovered element to remove its styling.</li>
<li>Unclosed <code>[[</code> will no longer cause the next line to get rendered as a link.</li>
<li>Updated "Auto pair brackets" behavior so that <code>[[link]]'s</code> can be typed without the apostrophe getting paired.</li>
<li>Hover preview is no longer positioned on top of the cursor or target element if there isn't enough room to display the preview box.</li>
<li>Editor selection is no longer blurred when resizing a tab group.</li>
<li>Search: Minor tweak to avoid the content shifting a lot as the search counter ticks upward.</li>
<li>Vim: Fixed issue with character movements not respective atomic ranges.</li>
<li>Vim: Fixed issue where <code>O</code> on the first line of a file with properties would put the cursor in the wrong position.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Developers</h2>
<ul>
<li>As of 1.5.0, the <a href="https://obsidian.md/blog/goodbye-legacy-editor/">Legacy editor has been completely removed</a> from Obsidian.</li>
<li><a href="https://docs.obsidian.md/Reference/CSS+variables/Editor/Table">New CSS table variables for selection and dragging</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>Breaking changes</h2>
<ul>
<li>File Explorer and Tags pane both received a small code refactor. This might affect some plugins that rely on the internal JS structure. Themes should not be affected.</li>
<li>Tags can no longer end in a <code>/</code>.</li>
</ul>

<article>


<p>I wouldn't mind this <strong>huge</strong> ad so much if the pancake mix was made with lentil flour...on second thought, that doesn't sound good:</p>

<img src="https://www.openmymind.net/assets/forposts/website-catalogs/walmart-1.png" alt="walmart search result showing ads instead of results">

<p>And if I complain about not being able to sort by price/quality (or weight), I assume some people will point out that choice adds complexity. But it's hard to understand what value this choice is adding:</p>

<img src="https://www.openmymind.net/assets/forposts/website-catalogs/walmart-2.png" alt="facet with a single option">

<p>Since we're talking about facets, I'm curious what category those other 632 products fall under:</p>

<img src="https://www.openmymind.net/assets/forposts/website-catalogs/walmart-3.png" alt="category facets showing 16 total products despite having 648 results">

<p>At costco, a search for "rice" yields this amazing facet:</p>

<img src="https://www.openmymind.net/assets/forposts/website-catalogs/costco-1.png" alt="Each facet contains all the products">

<p>Surprise, the search returned 25 results (seriously).</p>

<p>I'm particularly intrigued by rice that isn't vegan, lactose free, or gluten free:</p>

<img src="https://www.openmymind.net/assets/forposts/website-catalogs/costco-2.png" alt="Rice facet showing only 1 vegan option">

<p>The sorting made me check wiki to see how much revenue they have ($242 billion):</p>

<img src="https://www.openmymind.net/assets/forposts/website-catalogs/costco-3.png" alt="Case-sensitive sorting of brands">

<p>There must be a term in information theory that describes what's going on here:</p>

<img src="https://www.openmymind.net/assets/forposts/website-catalogs/redmart-1.png" alt="Search for 'alcohol' returns non-alcohol results">

<p>You can't tell, but the 2nd result <em>is also</em> alcohol free (the first 10 results are). For any Singaporean thinking that Alibaba ruined Lazada who ruined Redmart: no.</p>

<p>I don't think anyone would be offended if I said e-commerce in the Philippines has a lot of catching up to do. But this first page search result is something else (yes, they sell a lot of other laundry detergent):</p>

<img src="https://www.openmymind.net/assets/forposts/website-catalogs/landers-1.png" alt="Search for 'laundry detergent' returns umbrellas">

<p>The inspiration for this post is that nintendo.com lets you filter for <code>2+</code> players, but that includes single system, local wireless and online. So there's no way to get a list of games that supports couch coop. Unless you want to check 1680 games that is:</p>

<img src="https://www.openmymind.net/assets/forposts/website-catalogs/nintendo-1.png" alt="1680 2+ player games">

<p>Haha, J/K. The search won't return more than 1000 records.</p>

<p>And while we're talking about nintendo.com, if you goto Games &gt; Nintendo Switch Games:</p>

<img src="https://www.openmymind.net/assets/forposts/website-catalogs/nintendo-2.png" alt="nintendo.com homepage top nav">

<p>You'll get 120 games and only 120 games. Of course the list of switch games isn't under Games &gt; Nintendo Switch Games that would be silly. But, for days I've tried and failed to figure out what these 120 games have in common and why they get this special treatment. I can't sleep.</p>

<p>A pretty major milestone has been achieved: Britain has become the first major country to halve its carbon emissions. The rapid pace of UK environmental progress means that our output is now below 319 million tonnes&nbsp;– half the 652 million tonnes at our 1970 peak. This is in spite of Britain now having a far larger population and economy than 50 years ago.</p>

<p>The Thanksgiving long weekend (23-26 November) in 2023 was an interesting one for OpenZFS, that I managed to land myself in the middle of. The short version of events is that an apparent silent data corruption bug was discovered, which is kind of the worst case scenario for a data storage system.</p>
<p>It was a pretty intense few days for me, initially one of a few people looking into the bug, and then later being involved in working out a fix, talking to downstream vendors, responding to private and public messages with users, my own customers and the press, and doing damage control. It was mostly done with by the end of the weekend, though took a couple of weeks to mop up, and overall I’d rate it a qualified success for the project.</p>
<p>I’ve been writing this post on and off since then. A lot happened, and I have a lot of thoughts, and I wanted to get them all down, but it got too much. So this post just covers the bug itself, and I’m hoping to write more about the fuzzier stuff soon. If you’re reading this months later and I still haven’t, maybe <a href="https://despairlabs.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#8fe7eae3e3e0cfebeafcffeee6fde3eeedfca1ece0e2">ping me</a> and remind me that I promised!</p>
<h2 id="free-filesystem-lesson">Free filesystem lesson</h2>
<p>To understand what happened, you need to know a little bit about OpenZFS internals. If you have been paying attention to <a href="https://github.com/openzfs/zfs/issues/15526">the whole kerfuffle</a>, then you might recognise some of the moving parts as we go along!</p>
<h3 id="what-is-a-file-really">What is a file, really?</h3>
<p>If you lift the lid on a OpenZFS filesystem (or volume!) you’ll find that OpenZFS is an object store. The top-level object is called an “object set” (or just “objset”), and can be thought of as just a giant array of objects. In turn, each object has two parts:</p>
<ul>
<li>the “dnode”, which is a kind of metadata header that describes the object’s type, size, etc, and carries a pointer to its first data block</li>
<li>the object data, which is a tree of blocks, either an “indirect” block that just points to more blocks, or a “data” block, which is, well, data.</li>
</ul>
<p>For the purposes of this discussion, we can consider a simplified view of the world, with the objset at the top, a list of dnodes, each with a count of attached data blocks, and then a list of data blocks.</p>



    <img src="https://despairlabs.com/blog/posts/2023-12-25-openzfs-data-corruption-bug/dnodes.png" alt="">
    


<p>There isn’t more to it in concept. Higher-level filesystem concepts are just built out of more objects, for example, a directory is just a special kind of object (internally called a “ZAP”) that is just a dictionary of name → object index.</p>
<h3 id="not-all-data-is-data">Not all data is data</h3>
<p>If a data block contains all zeroes, we can use a little optimisation. Instead of allocating real space on the disk just to store a whole bunch of zeroes, we can instead keep a note to say “this block is all zeroes”. We don’t have to store anything then, because we can recreate it on request. This note is called a “hole”, and is what gives a “sparse file” its “sparseness”.</p>
<p>So here are our files again, with some holes:</p>



    <img src="https://despairlabs.com/blog/posts/2023-12-25-openzfs-data-corruption-bug/holes.png" alt="">
    


<p>In every way, these look like they did before: the dnode still reports how many blocks they have. All that changes is that if something tries to read from one of the hole blocks, OpenZFS will create a data buffer as normal, but instead of actually going to disk and getting the data to put in the buffer, it will just zero the buffer. Less space required, fewer IO operations to spend. Lovely!</p>
<h3 id="the-fastest-disks-are-memory">The fastest disks are memory</h3>
<p>Unfortunately, disks are slow, even very fast ones. Memory, however, is very fast. So, when you make a change to a file, say, write some new data to the end of it, OpenZFS makes that change in memory only, and later writes it (and any other changes) down to disk. This is fast, because it only touches memory, and can make the later disk part even faster, eg your program may have written over part of a file, then written over the same part again, so when it comes to to write the change to disk, it only has to write the final state, not both changes.</p>
<p>Of course, keeping changes in memory means we need extra housekeeping information to know that we have changes to write out when the time comes. We call the changed things “dirty”, and to track this, we keep some lists.</p>
<p>The objset has a list of dirty dnodes, and each dnode has a list of dirty blocks. So after our write, we have some nice linked lists of dirty things, ready to be written out.</p>



    <img src="https://despairlabs.com/blog/posts/2023-12-25-openzfs-data-corruption-bug/dirty.png" alt="">
    


<p>There is one crucially important detail, of course: until that data is written to disk, the version in memory is the latest, and what the application believes exists (applications don’t really know a whole lot about this disk stuff). So anything inside OpenZFS that wants to consider the current state of an object has to look at the dirty information as well, to know if its looking at the latest or not.</p>
<h3 id="data-first">Data first</h3>
<p>When it comes time to write everything out, first the blocks are written:</p>



    <img src="https://despairlabs.com/blog/posts/2023-12-25-openzfs-data-corruption-bug/data-written.png" alt="">
    


<p>And then the dnodes go out, and everything is on disk.</p>



    <img src="https://despairlabs.com/blog/posts/2023-12-25-openzfs-data-corruption-bug/dnode-written.png" alt="">
    


<p>I’ve of course left out a million tiny details, not least of which is the whole copy-on-write thing. This is a useful conceptual model though; in this part of the code you can largely take for granted that the layers below you will take care of all that.</p>
<h2 id="beware-of-holes">Beware of holes</h2>
<p>The crux of this bug is around hole detection.</p>
<p>Sometimes an application wants to know where the holes in a file are. A file copying program is a good example: its whole job is to read all the data from one file, and write it to another. If it can find out that there’s a hole, then it saves itself the trouble of reading that block, and it also tell the filesystem to make a hole in the copy too. Even less space and fewer IO operations to think about. Extra lovely!</p>
<p>For a program to find out about holes, it can call <a href="https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/lseek.2.html"><code>lseek()</code></a> with the <code>SEEK_HOLE</code> or <code>SEEK_DATA</code> options, which say “tell me the position of the next hole” or “next data”.</p>
<p>Holes are actually stored on disk in OpenZFS as a zero-length block pointer. There’s also a clever optimisation, which is that if a program writes a full list of zeroes, the compression system will notice and “compress” it down to a hole. However, block pointers and compression belong to the IO layer, which is quite a way away from the object layer (the DMU).</p>
<p>As a result, there’s no way currently to discover if a dirty block will eventually be stored as a hole. For this reason, <code>lseek()</code> checks if the dnode is dirty, and if so, it waits for it to be written out before it goes looking for holes.</p>
<h3 id="hidden-dirt">Hidden dirt</h3>
<p>So now we come to the actual bug: the dirty check. Recall how we track dirty things:</p>



    <img src="https://despairlabs.com/blog/posts/2023-12-25-openzfs-data-corruption-bug/dirty.png" alt="">
    


<p>Before <a href="https://github.com/openzfs/zfs/pull/15571">we fixed it</a>, the dirty check for <code>lseek()</code> used to be “is this dnode on the dirty list?”. Note that this is a subtly different question from what we actually want to know, which is “is this dnode dirty?”.</p>
<p>And there’s the bug. There is a moment in the dnode write process where the dnode is taken off the “dirty” list, and put on the “synced” list. This happens before the data blocks are written out, so there is a moment where the dnode looks like this:</p>



    <img src="https://despairlabs.com/blog/posts/2023-12-25-openzfs-data-corruption-bug/dirty-gap.png" alt="">
    


<p>This gap is <em>tiny</em>. Hard to estimate, but we’re talking tens of CPU instructions. But if <code>lseek()</code> comes along in that moment, the dirty check fails, so it goes into the “search for data/holes” stage. And because that only sees fully allocated and written blocks, it actually sees something more like this:</p>



    <img src="https://despairlabs.com/blog/posts/2023-12-25-openzfs-data-corruption-bug/not-clean.png" alt="">
    


<p>And so, if a program asks about holes, it may well end up wrongly finding them in the last couple of blocks of the file.</p>
<h3 id="the-idea-of-data">The idea of data</h3>
<p>Of course, the data is there, and if the program had only read it, it would have found this, but OpenZFS gave it reason to believe that it wasn’t there, so it didn’t bother.</p>
<p>This whole madness started because <a href="https://github.com/openzfs/zfs/issues/15526#issuecomment-1823575126">someone posted an attempt at a test case</a> for a different issue, and then that <a href="https://github.com/openzfs/zfs/issues/15526#issuecomment-1823633960">test case started failing</a> on versions of OpenZFS that didn’t even have the feature in question. The key part of that test was that it used the <code>/bin/cp</code> program from <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/coreutils.html">GNU Coreutils</a>, which is almost ubiquitous on Linux systems. In v9.2 it started using <code>lseek()</code> to discover holes in source files.</p>
<p>When a new file is created, it starts life as:</p>



    <img src="https://despairlabs.com/blog/posts/2023-12-25-openzfs-data-corruption-bug/new-file.png" alt="">
    


<p>That is, just the metadata, no data.</p>
<p>When we add some data, it becomes:</p>



    <img src="https://despairlabs.com/blog/posts/2023-12-25-openzfs-data-corruption-bug/new-dirty.png" alt="">
    


<p>If we manage to catch it just right though, it looks like:</p>



    <img src="https://despairlabs.com/blog/posts/2023-12-25-openzfs-data-corruption-bug/new-hole.png" alt="">
    


<p><code>cp</code>’s opening move is <code>lseek(…, 0, SEEK_DATA)</code>, which is to say, “find the first data item from position 0”. When it works, it returns <code>0</code>, because that’s where the data is. If it fails, it sets error <code>ENXIO</code>, that is: no data here. So <code>cp</code> doesn’t read, and it writes zeroes (or a hole!) to the output.</p>
<p>Incidentally, that’s why this isn’t “corruption” in the traditional sense (and why a scrub doesn’t find it): no data was lost. <code>cp</code> didn’t read data that was there, and it wrote some zeroes which OpenZFS safely stored.</p>
<h2 id="the-long-way-home">The long way home</h2>
<p>In the course of exploring the problem, we found that setting the config parameter <code>zfs_dmu_offset_next_sync=0</code> defanged the reproducer. This quickly became the recommended workaround. It also brought some confusion of its own, as it appeared to improve performance, leading some to wonder if they should just leave it off permanently. It also turns out that it doesn’t actually stop the bug from occurring, just makes it vastly more difficult to hit. All this has been extremely difficult to explain, which naturally means I should expect success if I have one more go at it.</p>
<h3 id="transaction-pipeline">Transaction pipeline</h3>
<p>To understand this part we need to know a little about the transaction pipeline.</p>
<p>At any point in time, OpenZFS has three transactions in flight.</p>
<ul>
<li>The OPEN transaction, which receives new changes as they arrive.</li>
<li>The QUIESCING transaction, where the changes are combined and prepared to be written to disk.</li>
<li>The SYNCING transaction, which is being written out to disk right now.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once the SYNCING transaction is written, everything is moved along. QUIESCING becomes the new SYNCING, OPEN moves to QUIESCING, and a new OPEN transaction is created. There’s more details of course, but this is the basic idea.</p>
<p>Changes are only added to the OPEN transaction. Once it moves to the next state, it can’t be modified again. So a busy object can end up with changes on multiple transactions. And this means that when we ask “is this object dirty?”, what we’re actually asking is “is this object dirty on transaction N?” or “is this object dirty on any transaction?”</p>
<h3 id="diary-of-a-change">Diary of a change</h3>
<p>Here’s a visual representation of how changes flow through the transaction pipeline. This is conceptual, of course - “clean” objects are not on any transaction, but then again, “transactions” are not a real thing either.</p>
<p>So lets imagine a nice normal clean object, on the current transaction.</p>



    <img src="https://despairlabs.com/blog/posts/2023-12-25-openzfs-data-corruption-bug/txg0.png" alt="">
    


<p>We append a block to it, which makes it dirty in memory in memory on the current transaction.</p>



    <img src="https://despairlabs.com/blog/posts/2023-12-25-openzfs-data-corruption-bug/txg1.png" alt="">
    


<p>On the next transaction, we append another block to it. Yellow here shows the changes that aren’t on disk yet but are considered “unchanged” on this transaction.</p>



    <img src="https://despairlabs.com/blog/posts/2023-12-25-openzfs-data-corruption-bug/txg2.png" alt="">
    


<p>This time we don’t make any modifications, so this object is “clean” on the OPEN transaction. The first change we made is now on the SYNCING transaction, and starts getting written out.</p>



    <img src="https://despairlabs.com/blog/posts/2023-12-25-openzfs-data-corruption-bug/txg3.png" alt="">
    


<p>The transactions move along again and the second change starts getting written out.</p>



    <img src="https://despairlabs.com/blog/posts/2023-12-25-openzfs-data-corruption-bug/txg4.png" alt="">
    


<p>All changes are are now written.</p>



    <img src="https://despairlabs.com/blog/posts/2023-12-25-openzfs-data-corruption-bug/txg5.png" alt="">
    


<h3 id="everywhere-is-dirty">Everywhere is dirty</h3>
<p>Earlier I wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The objset has a list of dirty dnodes, and each dnode has a list of dirty blocks. So after our write, we have some nice linked lists of dirty things, ready to be written out.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But with multiple transactions in flight, we actually need a dirty dnode list and a dirty block list for each transaction, which means things actually look more like this:</p>



    <img src="https://despairlabs.com/blog/posts/2023-12-25-openzfs-data-corruption-bug/dnode-lists.png" alt="">
    


<p>This of course means the dirty check is more complex too. I wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As a result, there’s no way currently to discover if a dirty block will eventually be stored as a hole. For this reason, <code>lseek()</code> checks if the dnode is dirty, and if so, it waits for it to be written out before it goes looking for holes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The user’s view of the object (via system calls like <code>lseek()</code> is whatever is on the OPEN transaction. Because looking for holes means looking at the on-disk state, that means we have to wait until <em>all</em> pending changes are on disk. So our dirty check here has to be “is this object dirty on any transaction?”, which means checking if the dnode is on <em>any</em> dirty list.</p>
<h3 id="wait-for-service">Wait for service</h3>
<p>Recall that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>lseek()</code> checks if the dnode is dirty, and if so, it waits for it to be written out before it goes looking for holes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Even if the object is dirty only on a single transaction, that wait can be long if the pool is very busy. So OpenZFS has a config option, <code>dmu_offset_next_sync</code> which controls what the <code>dmu_offset_next()</code> function (one of the work functions implementing <code>lseek()</code>) does when the dnode is dirty.</p>
<p>If set to <code>0</code>, and the object is dirty, then instead of waiting, the function simply returns an error, which causes <code>lseek()</code>  to return “data here”. This is allowed; its always safe to say there’s data where there’s a hole, because reading a hole area will always find “zeroes”, which is valid data. It can mean a loss of efficiency, because the application can’t do special things for holes, but at least the data is always intact. And because its a simple dirty check, its fast.</p>
<p>If its set to <code>1</code> (the default), it will wait instead. Specifically, it will do a dirty check, and if its dirty, it will wait until the currently-syncing transaction is written out. Then it will do another dirty check; if the object is still dirty, it will return an error (and so <code>lseek()</code> returns “data here”), and if clean, it will go into hole detection as normal.</p>
<p>So now we understand the apparent performance gain with <code>dmu_offset_next_sync=0</code> (it just never waits). But why does that also appear to mitigate the bug?</p>
<h3 id="doubly-dirty">Doubly dirty</h3>
<p>Recall that the bug occurs in the moment where the dnode is taken off the dirty list, but not yet put on the syncing list, and in that moment its not a list, so its erroneously considered to be clean.</p>
<p>Since there’s actually multiple lists, but this gap only occurs on the SYNCING list, it gives some idea of where the window you have to hit is. Its not a change “just made”, but actually made two transactions ago (from the perspective of the user). On a quiet system that can be whole seconds ago. On a busy object, with changes on multiple in-flight transactions, a single dirty check (ie <code>dmu_offset_next_sync=0</code>) is always going to result in “dirty”, and so <code>lseek()</code> returning “data here”, because even if there’s a gap on the SYNCING list, the dnode will also be on the OPEN or QUIESCING dirty lists, and so still be dirty. So the only time we can hit a gap is for the “some time later” case. Not out of the question, but incredibly difficult for any non-contrived workload (or even contrived - to my knowledge its <a href="https://github.com/openzfs/zfs/issues/15526#issuecomment-1826104073">only been seen on a quite large and unusual ARM64 system</a>, and even then its hard to hit).</p>
<p>In the “wait for sync” mode (<code>dmu_offset_next_sync=1</code>), we have two dirty checks, and either of them can go wrong. For the first check to fail its the same as above, the “some time later” case. Its the second that is more interesting, with a wait in between.</p>
<p>To get the wrong answer, the dnode must only be on the SYNCING list, so that when its removed, its not on any other lists. The two dirty checks are one transaction apart, so for the second to <em>incorrectly</em> return “clean”, the dnode must be dirty on two consecutive transactions. That’s not hard to arrange of course, but that alone isn’t really going to make much difference.</p>
<p>The difference is just the timing. The first (or only) dirty check can happen any time; whenever <code>lseek()</code> is called. The second however is always called just the after the transaction has synced and the next one is beginning sync. The object in question is dirty there, and is removed from the dirty list and added to the syncing list before it starts syncing, which means there’s a better-than-usual chance that its happening just as <code>dmu_offset_next()</code> loops and does the dirty check. Overall, it raises the chances of hitting the gap and getting the wrong answer.</p>
<h2 id="a-clone-in-time">A clone in time</h2>
<p>The original bug appeared to point to block cloning as being the cause of the problem, and it was treated as such until the problem was reproduced on an earlier version of OpenZFS without block cloning. This didn’t end up being the case, and it initially being blamed is perhaps a symptom of a deeper problem, but that’s for another post.</p>
<p>However some people did report that disabling block cloning entirely appeared to helped. So far we haven’t really found any reason why it would make a difference, other than at a distance by changing the timing - its faster to apply a clone than a write, because there’s no actual data to copy or write, so that allows more dirty dnodes and/or more transactions to be processed in a shorter amount of time. This alone means nothing, as the gap is still the same amount of time, but with other variables like hardware and workload, it could change it in the right way.</p>
<p>Another reason cloning was implicated was that the bug had been seen on FreeBSD. Its <code>/bin/cp</code> is not the Coreutils one, and doesn’t look for holes, but does call <code>copy_file_range()</code>, which hands off copying to the kernel to do the copy however it would like. This function has become known as “the cloning function” because the kernel might choose to service the copy via clones. However on FreeBSD it will also use <code>lseek()</code> under the hood to try to replicate holes in the file, and so can run into the same problem. <code>copy_file_range()</code> on Linux doesn’t do this, and that’s most peoples experience of cloning, leading to confusion.</p>
<p>That’s not to say there isn’t problems with block cloning at all - there’s a few known, which is why its currently disabled by default in OpenZFS releases. The upcoming 2.2.3 release will fix some significant issues with block cloning, and a comprehensive test suite is coming together. How block cloning became the whole thing it is, and the interaction with this and other issues in the public perception, is something I want to write more about, but this has gone on long enough.</p>
<h2 id="history-of-a-bug">History of a bug</h2>
<p>This bug has a long history, as can be seen by reading multiple earlier patches that made changes around it. All had seen <em>something</em> wrong, but hadn’t fully understood it.</p>

That alone is not a bug; it might be that there’s something else preventing the off-list gap being hit (eg another lock), so maybe the bug was never in this version of ZFS. What has changed is that its no longer possible to understand the dirty state directly; its now reliant on what’s happening elsewhere in the system.</p>
<p>I’m not really blaming anyone - complex problems sometimes require complex solutions! Its just one of those things that the details of are long forgotten, so its on the reader to make sure they understand it, without much external guidance. There’s more to say about this, but not here.</p>
<h2 id="turn-tape-over">Turn tape over</h2>
<p>In the end its not a data corruption bug <em>as such</em>, but possibly that’s splitting hairs. As you see though, it has existed a long long time, and is fiendishly difficult to hit in almost all real-world scenarios, and even harder to hit <em>undetected</em>. It does reinforce the standard mantras about storage though: take backups, test your backups.</p>
<p>I’ll never exactly be happy about a data-loss bug, but what I am happy about is the way that a whole group of people appeared over a holiday weekend and worked together to solve an ancient mystery. I loved being a part of it, and I’m now looking for ways to get that happening in more proactive and less desperate situations.</p>
<p>That’s all for now. Hopefully more soon about all the other thoughts I had while working on this!</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  
  <task-lists disabled="" sortable="">
    <div>
      <p dir="auto">'Twas the night before Christmas, when all through the code<br>
Not a core dev was merging, not even Guido;<br>
The CI was spun on the PRs with care<br>
In hopes that green check-markings soon would be there;<br>
The buildbots were nestled all snug under desks,<br>
Even PPC64 AIX;<br>
Doc-writers, triage team, the Council of Steering,<br>
Had just stashed every change and stopped engineering,</p>
<p dir="auto">When in the "PRs" tab arose such a clatter,<br>
They opened GitHub to see what was the matter.<br>
Away to CPython they flew like a flash,<br>
Towards sounds of <code>PROT_EXEC</code> and <code>__builtin___clear_cache</code>.<br>
First <a href="https://github.com/brandtbucher/cpython/blob/justin/Tools/jit/README.md">LLVM was downloaded, unzipped</a><br>
Then the Actions were running <a href="https://github.com/brandtbucher/cpython/blob/justin/Tools/jit/build.py">a strange new build script</a>,<br>
When something appeared, they were stopped in their tracks,<br>
<a href="https://gist.github.com/brandtbucher/d6397b1d106c55164b32df27d53eb7b8"><code>jit_stencils.h</code></a>, generated from <a href="https://github.com/brandtbucher/cpython/blob/justin/Tools/jit/template.c">hacks</a>,<br>
With their spines all a-shiver, they muttered "Oh, shit...",<br>
They knew in a moment it must be a JIT.</p>
<p dir="auto">More rapid than interpretation it came<br>
And it copied-and-patched every stencil by name:<br>
"Now, <code>_LOAD_FAST</code>! Now, <code>_STORE_FAST</code>! <code>_BINARY_OP_ADD_INT</code>!<br>
On, <code>_GUARD_DORV_VALUES_INST_ATTR_FROM_DICT</code>!<br>
To the top of the loop! And down into the call!<br>
Now cache away! Cache away! Cache away all!"<br>
But why now? And how so? They needed a hint,<br>
Thankfully, Brandt gave a great talk at the sprint;<br>
So over to <a href="https://youtu.be/HxSHIpEQRjs" rel="nofollow">YouTube</a> the reviewers flew,<br>
They read <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3485513" rel="nofollow">the white paper</a>, and <a href="https://sillycross.github.io/2023/05/12/2023-05-12" rel="nofollow">the blog post</a> too.</p>
<p dir="auto">And then, after watching, they saw its appeal<br>
Not writing the code themselves seemed so unreal.<br>
And the platform support was almost too easy,<br>
ARM64 Macs to 32-bit PCs.<br>
There was <a href="https://github.com/brandtbucher/cpython/blob/justin/Python/jit.c">some runtime C</a>, not too much, just enough,<br>
Basically a loader, relocating stuff;<br>
It ran every test, one by one passed them all,<br>
With not one runtime dependency to install.<br>
Mostly build-time Python! With strict static typing!<br>
For maintenance ease, and also nerd-sniping!</p>
<p dir="auto">Though dispatch was faster, the JIT wasn't wise,<br>
And the traces it used still should be optimized;<br>
The code it was JIT'ing still needed some thinning,<br>
With code models small, and some register pinning;<br>
Or <a href="https://discourse.llvm.org/t/rfc-exposing-ghccc-calling-convention-as-preserve-none-to-clang/74233" rel="nofollow">new calling conventions</a>, shared stubs for paths slow,<br>
Since this JIT was brand new, there was fruit hanging low.<br>
It was awkwardly large, parsed straight out of the ELFs,<br>
And they laughed when they saw it, in spite of themselves;</p>
<p dir="auto">A <code>configure</code> flag, and no merging this year,<br>
Soon gave them to know they had nothing to fear;<br>
It wasn't much faster, at least it could work,<br>
They knew that'd come later; no one was a jerk,<br>
But they were still smart, and determined, and skilled,<br>
They opened a shell, and configured the build;<br>
<code>--enable-experimental-jit</code>, then made it,<br>
And away the JIT flew as their "+1"s okay'ed it.<br>
But they heard it exclaim, as it traced out of sight,<br>
"Happy JIT-mas to all, and to all a good night!"</p>

            <p><b>Posted by</b> Rampant Coyote on August 12, 2014</p>
            
                        
<p><em>One of my most popular posts was also my very first… which has since been lost to the Great Blog Devouring of ’14. So…&nbsp; here’s the post from over ten years ago (has it been that long?!?!?!) about an event from almost twenty years ago. Still stuff I have to remind myself about some days.</em></p>
<p><a href="http://rampantgames.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/warhawk_1.jpg"><img decoding="async" fetchpriority="high" src="http://rampantgames.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/warhawk_1-300x225.jpg" alt="warhawk_1" width="300" height="225" srcset="https://rampantgames.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/warhawk_1-300x225.jpg 300w, https://rampantgames.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/warhawk_1.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"></a>In October of 1994, I’d just started as an honest-to-goodness videogame programmer at a small startup called SingleTrac which later went on to fame and glory (but unfortunately not much in the way of fortune) with such titles as <strong>Warhawk</strong>, the <strong>Twisted Metal</strong> series, and the <strong>Jet Moto</strong> series. But at the time, the company was less than 20 employees in size and had only been officially in business for about a month. It was sometime in my first week possibly my first or second day. In the main engineering room, there was a whoop and cry of success.</p>
<p>Our company financial controller and acting HR lady, Jen, came in to see what incredible things the engineers and artists had come up with. Everyone was staring at a television set hooked up to a development box for the Sony Playstation. There, on the screen, against a single-color background, was a black triangle.</p>
<p>“It’s a black triangle,” she said in an amused but sarcastic voice. One of the engine programmers tried to explain, but she shook her head and went back to her office. I could almost hear her thoughts… “We’ve got ten months to deliver two games to Sony, and they are cheering over a black triangle? <em>THAT</em> took them nearly a month to develop?”</p>
<p>What she later came to realize (and explain to others) was that the black triangle was a pioneer. It wasn’t just that we’d managed to get a triangle onto the screen. That could be done in about a day. It was the journey the triangle had taken to get up on the screen. It had passed through our new modeling tools, through two different intermediate converter programs, had been loaded up as a complete database, and been rendered through a fairly complex scene hierarchy, fully textured and lit (though there were no lights, so the triangle came out looking black). The black triangle demonstrated that the foundation was finally complete the core of a fairly complex system was completed, and we were now ready to put it to work doing cool stuff. By the end of the day, we had complete models on the screen, manipulating them with the controllers. Within a week, we had an environment to move the model through.</p>
<p>Afterwards, we came to refer to certain types of accomplishments as “black triangles.” These are important accomplishments that take a lot of effort to achieve, but upon completion you don’t have much to show for it only that more work can now proceed. It takes someone who really knows the guts of what you are doing to appreciate a black triangle.</p>
<p>Years later,&nbsp;I was chatting with another SingleTrac alumnus, and was excitedly relating my work on the multiplayer code. I’d spent a little over a week working on the underlying architecture, trying to make it clean and reliable and easy to use. It was all UDP rather than TCP/IP (for speed), so I created my own “guaranteed delivery” protocol for those rare packets that needed to be guaranteed. I’d rarely worked low-level network code before, so it was kind of a new experience. When all was said and done, I had another computer join the game and boom! There it was, on the host machine. Wow. No updates, it did next to nothing, but the core architecture was there. The rest SHOULD come together quickly. Explaining this to my buddy over IM, I explained, “It’s a black triangle.” He understood what I meant immediately. It’s a convenient shorthand metaphor.</p>
<p>So feel free to steal the term. And when progress seems a little slow because you are doing a bunch of hardcore architecture work, just remember it’s a black triangle.</p>

<p>So here’s a program written in a hurry, possibly in the style of a college CS student in about week six of learning C++ as a taught course. It’s simple, it works, and it can (naturally) be improved upon:</p>

<p>Not all choices can be made at compile-time, sometimes including which function (of several possibilities) to invoke. This article aims to cover all of the methods available to Modern C++ when selecting which function to call, with the decision made at runtime (based upon user input, for example). Terms covered in this article include function pointers, function objects, virtual functions and lambdas.</p>

<p>In this article we’re going to look at a feature new to C++23 which supports a way to return an error condition from a function where a result value was anticipated. This is enabled in a new header <code>&lt;expected&gt;</code> which (as far as I am aware) does not require specific compiler support. (MSVC 19.37 with <code>/std:c++latest</code> was used to test the program code in this article.)</p>

<p>When writing C++, we like to do as much of the work as possible at compile time; with C++ being a statically-typed language, we know the type(s) involved when compilation is taking place. In this article we’ll look at how to pass and receive, variables and results, of differing types depending on the nature of the function call itself. The four methods we will examine are: function overloading, template specialization, tag dispatch, and SFINAE.</p>

<p>Concepts finally appeared in the language with the completion of C++20—I say finally as work to specify them had been going on continuously since before the release of C++11. This article attempts to explain their rationale and usage, with examples that should compile on any up-to-date C++ compiler when specifying <code>-std=c++20</code> (or <code>/std:c++20</code> for MSVC).</p>



<p>So why do we need concepts when template syntax has been available since C++98? Put simply, templates have been (successfully) used in ways that were never envisaged; however the reporting of invalid instantiations and similar errors has not kept pace. Also, the use of <code>auto</code> in function parameter lists gives us template syntax “invisibly”, which the novice/intermediate coder may not expect.</p>

<p>Traits and policy classes are often used with C++ generics, but their role and purpose is often something of an enigma even to experienced C++ programmers. The definitions of these two terms overlap to some extent, and could be summarized as follows:</p>



<ul>
<li>Traits represent natural additional properties of a template parameter.</li>



<li>Policies represent configurable behavior for generic functions and types.</li>
</ul>



<p>In this article the example code will show use of both of these two, with type information obtained through a (specialized) traits class and functionality obtained from a (generic) policy class.</p>

<p>Functional programming (FP) is a discipline and practice of computer science where Mathematical concepts come to the fore. There are a number of popular FP languages out there, but we can stay with C++ and explore some of the themes of FP by using a subset of familiar syntax. In this article we’ll look at a number of FP concepts, such as purity, immutability and use of higher-order functions, and how they can be concisely and usefully represented in Modern C++.</p>



<h3>1. Purity</h3>



<p>A function is considered pure if its operation depends only upon its formal input parameters, that is not accessing any external (global) state. Global state in FP is a little like the historical Goto statement, shunned but sometimes necessary, and so is by design abstracted away as much as possible. A C++ lambda is pure if it has an empty capture clause, for example:</p>

<p>In the previous articles of this mini-series we’ve covered the use of custom serialization and deserialization functions to generate and interpret XML. In this article we’ll look at how to add to existing classes to give them the ability to utilize the (de-)serialization logic already written. The process is similar to before: create an in-memory model and then serialize it, or start with blank containers and then read in the data, checking for errors.</p>

<p>In the previous articles we’ve looked at creating an in-memory XML hierarchy (or DOM), and serializing from and deserializing to this memory model. In this article we’re going to look at querying the DOM in a similar fashion to JavaScript methods such as <code>document.getElementById()</code> available in a browser. The scheme chosen is to overload <code>operator []</code> (twice) and provide other convenience methods such as <code>name()</code> and <code>numberOfChildren()</code>.</p>

<p>The complement of serialization is deserialization, and this is typically more difficult as it requires character- or pattern-matching of the input, plus checking for erroneous input. To match a stream of XML the possibility of using <code>std::getline()</code> was considered, but this is too inflexible as regards whitespace. Stream input to a <code>std::string</code> was also considered, but again this is unsuitable as breaking all input at whitespace is not what is needed.</p>

<p>Data held in memory must be saved to a store in order to outlive the running-time of the program it belongs to. Simply dumping binary data to disk is not usually the best way, or even a practicable way, of achieving this (think security issues, endianness, 32-bits/64-bits etc.)</p>



<p>The terms “serialization” and its companion “deserialization” are used to describe the conversion between the in-memory model and a (usually textual) disk-file representation. As an example, consider a web-browser which reads an HTML web page (and its dependencies) from a network connection and converts (deserializes) it into a format which can be manipulated through the DOM (Document Object Model). In this article we’ll concentrate more on serialization, which is often a simpler task.</p>

<p>Learning a new programming language is hard, and is especially daunting when as a novice programmer the compiler rejects pretty much every program you write the first time you try to compile it. Of course, compiler errors and warnings are important as they encourage you to write correct code and ensure that your program actually runs at all, and works as expected.</p>



<p>C++ has traditionally been seen as one of the harder programming languages for beginners to pick up; ideally you should already  have some coding experience under your belt in (an)other programming language(s) before trying to learn Modern C++. This mini-series intends to examine the parts of C++ that novice (and more experienced) programmers sometimes fail to understand fully, leading to buggy and/or sub-optimal code.</p>

<p>In this article we’re going to continue the theme of a class-designer’s toolkit, looking at adding generics (template functionality) to C++ classes. Templates have been around since C++98, and almost all C++ programmers will have used them: <code>std::vector&lt;int&gt;</code> has the type <code>int</code>  as a parameter, itself being a specialization of a generic class. Any user-defined type can be used as a type parameter, having equal status to the built-in types.</p>



<h3>Generic classes</h3>



<p>Classes which are preceded by a the <code>template</code> keyword are automatically turned into generic classes. These classes can have any number of template parameters, we’re going to concentrate on classes having just one, this being a template type parameter. The class definition starts of as follows:</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://sambleckley.com/writing/lab-notebooks.html">https://sambleckley.com/writing/lab-notebooks.html</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38769700">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In college I worked as a developer in several science labs, including a chemistry lab. Even us computational folks were told to keep lab notebooks, and the protocols for your lab notebook were quite strict. At the time, I was not very good at using my notebook (or at doing the science, frankly). Over the intervening years, I’ve come to understand and value what they were for; and now I keep lab books for almost all my software engineering work.</p> <h2 id="whats-a-lab-notebook">What’s a lab notebook?</h2> <p>It’s a disciplined record of what you do and think each day.</p> <p>One of the hardest things about software engineering is that, while it’s often possible to understand the code you committed, it’s usually impossible to see all the things you tried first, that didn’t work. This is a trap for other developers, and even your future self, where a seemingly better solution gets tried again and again, and each time the same problem arises. But since the failure never gets committed, no record of the attempt is left. I suspect most experienced developers can remember a time where their memory saved a team hours or even weeks of work, simply by saying “ah, we tried [clever solution] a few years ago, but ran into problems X, Y, and Z. So we’d need to solve those problems before we try again.”</p> <p>A lab notebook takes that kind of information <em>out</em> of your memory and puts it somewhere safe and permanent.</p> <p>Also, too many developers rely on their working memory, and end up burning out because they are afraid to leave a problem halfway. If the entire plan of attack exists only in your head, taking a lunch break can be disastrous.</p> <p>A lab notebook makes it safe to stop work at any time.</p> <p>As a consultant, it’s perfectly possible for old client to call me up and ask for advice, or an explanation of something I did for them. It’s no fun for anyone to say “sorry, I’ve worked on 5 other client projects since then, I have no memory of what I was doing.” On the other hand, it feels great to roll over to my bookshelf, grab the notebook associated with that client, and find a detailed explanation of what I did and why.</p> <p>In a meeting, writing in a notebook is socially more graceful than typing on a laptop. On a laptop, you might be answering email, or on facebook, or backchannel-chatting.</p> <p>A paper notebook is a way of signalling you’re present and listening.</p> <p>Finally, and least compelling, the <a href="https://www.workfront.com/blog/eudaimonia-machine-blueprint-virtual-workplace">Eudaimonia Machine</a> office design gets some attention from design and tech people every few months. Few people really discuss what goes in the library/archive room of the machine. One answer: your old lab notebooks.</p> <h2 id="what-are-the-rules">What are the rules?</h2> <p>I said there was a lot of discipline associated with a lab notebook. This is in part for forensics. If plagiarism/data falsification/ethics/etc concerns arise over some scientist’s research, the lab notebook can be valuable exonerating evidence — but only if the discipline is kept.</p> <p>Software engineering doesn’t have quite the same forensic constraints, but the same disciplines have nevertheless been valuable for me. Here are some of the major points:</p> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Always in pen.</strong></p> <p>Your goal is not to preserve the <em>outcome</em> of your thoughts — that’s your code. Your goal is to preserve the <em>process</em> of your thoughts. So no erasing, no blacking out. You can put a single line through anything spelled or written incorrectly.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Always <em>during</em></strong></p> <p>Write down what the problem is, what you’re about to do, and what you expect the result to be. Treat your work as an experiment! This is especially valuable for junior developers who are still in a “try everything until something works” frame of mind. Forcing yourself to hypothesize what’s actually wrong is really valuable; and there’s nothing wrong with expecting a negative result (“I don’t think the problem is X, but it’s easy to prove it, so…”)</p> <p>If during the actual process, you deviate from your written plan, write down the deviation, and why you’re doing so.</p> <p>Don’t wait until after you’re “done” — because “done” might mean six hours from now.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Always <em>forward</em>.</strong></p> <p>If you write something on Monday and realize you were wrong on Tuesday, write the correction in Tuesday’s entry. This is a lab <em>journal</em> — from the French “daily”. If you had a misconception, you <em>want</em> a record of that, as well as a record of why you were wrong. You can (and should) add a small note to the original entry pointing to the page where you correct yourself — but don’t obscure what you originally wrote.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Keep a table of contents</strong></p> <p>The first pages of your notebook should be a table of contents; with a few words summarizing what is on each page. Make it easy to answer questions about what you did, and why, even if years have passed.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Keep a habit</strong></p> <p>At the start of each day, read yesterday’s pages. Write down what you intend to do today. At the end of each day, read through today’s pages, and add an entry to your table of contents.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Summarize when necessary</strong></p> <p>If you’ve spent a messy week going round in circles, and you lab notebook has become hard to follow, feel free to take a page to summarize what you’ve learned and where you ended up. Flag it specially in your table of contents.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Store safely</strong></p> <p>At the end of a project, label the spine of your notebook, and store it safely with your others. It should be easy to access if questions ever come up.</p> </li> </ul> <p>These aren’t all the guidelines — pick a research university and I guarantee they’ll have some multi-page document explaining all the protocols surrounding your lab notebook — but these are the ones that have stuck with me.</p> <h2 id="what-notebook-should-i-use">What notebook should I use?</h2> <p>I use full-size gridded notebooks from <a href="https://velasciences.com/">Vela</a>. They’re made locally, and specifically designed for use as lab notebooks, so they have page numbers, page titles and dates, tables of contents, and so on all built-in; they make keeping the above disciplines easy. Vela also sell notebooks covered in material designed for use in wet labs; if you’re a clumsy person, an extra few dollars can make your coffee spill no big deal.</p> <p>They’re expensive, but I rarely use more than one per client, and I’m confident they’ve been worth it every time.</p> <p>(I have no relationship to Vela; I-just-think-theyre-neat.gif)</p> <h2 id="isnt-this-just-a-bullet-journal-isnt-this-just-a-planner-etc">Isn’t this just a bullet journal? Isn’t this just a planner? Etc.</h2> <p>Sure, do whatever works for you. I call it a lab notebook.</p> </div></div>]]></description>

<b> Explanation: </b> 
Single shots like this require planning. 

The first step is to realize that such an amazing 
<a href="https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap150624.html">triple-alignment</a> actually takes place.

The second step is to find the best location to photograph it.

But it was the third step: being there at exactly the right time -- 
and when the sky was clear -- that was the hardest.

Five times over six years the photographer tried and found 
<a href="https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap210613.html">bad weather</a>. 

Finally, just ten days ago, the 
<a href="https://climatekids.nasa.gov/menu/weather-and-climate/">weather</a> 
was perfect, and a photographic dream was realized.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
  

  
  <p>written on Monday, December 25, 2023
  

  </p><p>You likely know that I've contributed <a href="https://lucumr.pocoo.org/projects">significantly to the Open Source community</a>, that I work <a href="https://sentry.io/welcome/">for an Open Source Company</a>, that we got <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36971490">shit for calling ourselves
Open Source</a> and that we
subsequently created <a href="https://fsl.software/">a new license</a> to address
at least some of these concerns.  I also shared <a href="https://lucumr.pocoo.org/2023/11/19/cathedral-and-bazaaar-licensing/">my personal thoughts</a> on that license recently
which unfortunately promptly <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38331173">attracted a bunch more negative comments</a> for that.  That
introduction might make me sound a tad bitter, so let's talk about
something else.</p>
<p>This Christmas I <a href="https://twitter.com/mitsuhiko/status/1738930820998369593">received a 3D printer</a> and I love
it for two reasons.  Firstly, it was an unexpected gift from my wonderful
wife, who chose it.  She organized me a brand new <a href="https://bambulab.com/en/a1">Bambu Lab A1</a> 3D printer.  It has been a few years since
I toyed around with 3D printing and it was mostly in the context of other
people assembling printers.  That's because even though I love toying
around with software, I cannot say the same for hardware.  This printer,
however, is remarkably easy to set up and use, significantly boosting my
enjoyment in this hobby.  For this purchase she had to balance my love for
Open Source with user friendly technology and I think given the good
experience, she chose well.</p>
<p>The printer comes with a brief guide for the initial setup.  In about 15
minutes of removing some screws and mounting some components we were off
to the races.  The cloud account appears optional but after scanning a QR
code I could operate it from my phone too.  It's quick, it's super plug and
play and it just feels like an incredibly well put together product.</p>
<p>Since I've had to leave the printer at home over the holidays, I've been
engaging in related activities like reading up, creating models, and
exploring the slicer software.  Emotions surrounding this printer are
<em>charged</em>.  If you step into the wrong parts of the internet you find a
lot of hate.  Some of it might be warranted, but others just feels
incredibly out of proportion.  I've noticed a fair amount of controversy
surrounding the printer online, largely centered on its Chinese origins,
its optional cloud service, and its impact on the Open Source 3D printing
community.  I won't talk much about the China part <a href="#footnote-1" id="footnote-reference-1">[1]</a> here, but I do
want to talk about the cloud and license aspect.</p>
<p>The reason I even write about this printer is the licensing situation and
a bit of a rant about Open Source communities.  Here is what I believe is
currently happening, and I'm saying this as a person that knew next to
nothing until a few days ago about 3D printing: Bambu Labs is making some
other players in that space reconsider Open Source.</p>
<p>Bambu entered the industry in a very different way than anyone else
before.  They offer a user friendly experience at a very attractive price
point (lower than some of the competition).  They also added built-in
cloud service stuff and with a really good quality.  But it's a space
dominated by Open Source hardware and software.  And they don't really do
that.  Bambu seems to add new people into the 3D printing community who
don't don't care (or not as much) about Open Source.  Yet Bambu heavily
relied on Open Source software to put them on the map.</p>
<p>If you open their Bambu Studio, you can see that it's built on top of
<a href="https://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer">PrusaSlicer</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/supermerill/SuperSlicer">SuperSlicer</a>, both of
which are Open Source.  As both of those are licensed under AGPL (which is
a very viral license), <a href="https://github.com/bambulab/BambuStudio">so is Bambu Studio</a>.  But none of the firmware or
hardware designs of the Bambu printer are.  In fact, Bambu apparently is
also loading itself up with patents over in China, so they probably don't
care about Open Source much at all.  If I were Prusa (which in many ways
was the user friendly, dominant player before) I wouldn't be very happy.</p>
<p>So let's discuss Prusa: The Bambu A1 competes with Prusa's MK4 model
but is signficantly cheaper, faster and does more.  For the price of one
Prusa MK4 with shipping I could buy three Bambu A1 printers or two Bambu
A2 printers plus the AMS addon which adds multi-color printing.  There is
absolutely no reason to buy a Prusa MK4 today unless you want to support
Open Source or a European company (Prusa is from Czechia).</p>
<p>I was able tell that Prusa is reconsidering their Open Source approach and
that with a few days as a member of this community because people are
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/prusa3d/comments/10g6fgv/prusa_giving_up_on_its_open_source_roots/">complaining</a>
(The MK4 firmware is not Open Source).  Prusa is not hiding that they are
reconsidering their ways thanks to a blog post by their founder about how
they are <a href="https://blog.prusa3d.com/the-state-of-open-source-in-3d-printing-in-2023_76659/">reconsidering their Open Source ways</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[…] things we’ve been doing at Prusa Research for over ten years were
only possible thanks to the great <strong>3D printing community</strong> and
<strong>open-source philosophy</strong>. However, the new printers and software
releases have made me think again about the current state of open
source in the 3D printing world. How sustainable it is, how our
competitors deal with it, what it brings to the community, and what
troubles us as developers.  Consider this article as a <strong>call for
discussion</strong> – as a kick-off that will (hopefully) open up a new
perspective on the connection between open-source licensing, consumer
hardware, and software development.</p>
<p>[…]</p>
<p>The open-source movement relies on the fact that <strong>everyone involved
plays by the same rules</strong>.</p>
<p>—Josef Průša in <a href="https://blog.prusa3d.com/the-state-of-open-source-in-3d-printing-in-2023_76659/">The state of open-source in 3D printing in 2023</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I strongly recommend reading that entire post, because it captures quite
well the challenging situation that Open Source companies are in.  My take
on this is very much the same as for our own situation at Sentry: building
a true Open Source company is hard.  Under the OSI definition of Open
Source you are put at a massive disadvantage as you are prevented from
putting protections in place that shield you from other competitors in
that place that chose not to play by the same rules but can leverage your
source.</p>
<p>Historically the GPL has provided some protections here, but in all
reality in the modern world it doesn't.  That's because distribution is
really no longer the defining element.  Yes, Bambu Studio has to be AGPL
licensed because so is what it's built on, but in many ways that's just the
enabler for a proprietary system that they have in place.  They have
reaped years of benefits from this, benefiting from the work of others.
Some paid, but also from many who contributed for free.</p>
<p>Here is what I think would be a negative outcome: if this situation forces
companies like Prusa to abandon their Open Source practices.</p>
<p>However, I believe this situation reaffirms my belief that licenses like
our <a href="https://fsl.software/">FSL</a> (TL;DR: it includes a two-year
commercial non-compete period, after which it transitions to either MIT or
Apache 2, depending on the choice) are a viable alternative, even though
they are not considered Open Source by today's definition.  Because one
thing is absolutely clear to me: Bambu carries inherent risk for me as a
user.  They manufacture the parts and provide the firmware.</p>
<p>If they go out of business, owning their device becomes much riskier than
owning printers from the Open Source community.  For an end-user, having an
Open Source license is a far stronger proposition.  That's why I find the
comparison of the FSL to a “source available” or even “proprietary”
license somewhat insulting. A hypothetical FSL-inspired license for Open
Source hardware would grant a hardware company a limited-time non-compete
advantage over other players in the space, while giving users and the
community the assurance that they hold the keys after two years.</p>
<p>The world around us is changing, and so must we as the Open Source
community.  Software distribution is no longer the main focus, with much
emphasis now on services.  The situation also changes for successful Open
Source hardware communities.  Their innovations are slowly reaching more
users, many of whom do not value Open Source as much. In some ways, the
protections in Open Source that worked in a commercial context are no
longer effective.</p>
<p>What Bambu has done — and which I believe will be appreciated in the long
term — is to make their products more accessible to a broader audience.  They
introduced 3D printing to people who were previously unwilling to invest
the time.  This means there's more potential for profit for everyone
involved, but it also means that it will be harder for Open Source to
compete, especially if Open Source entities don't get a grip of their user
experience and business models.  As a user, I wish I could have the Bambu
experience with an Open Source-like model, where the risk is managed over
the long term, while allowing the companies that create these products to
pay their employees and continue innovating.</p>

In some ways if I were to have to worry about something from a

cause a lot more problems to me.  If I were to never be able to go to
China again, very little in my life would change.</td></tr>

<p><b>Check out the second sequel too: <a href="https://austinhenley.com/blog/challengingalgorithms.html">Challenging algorithms and data structures every programmer should try</a>.</b></p>

<p>I talk to a lot of students and professional developers that often want to start a side project, but aren't sure what to build. Below is a handful of software projects that taught me a lot. In fact, they're great because you could build them multiple times and learn new things each time. So whenever I don't know what to build or I want to learn a new programming language or framework, I start with one of these:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Text editor</li>
    <li>2D game - Space Invaders</li>
    <li>Compiler - Tiny BASIC</li>
    <li>Mini operating system</li>
    <li>Spreadsheet <small>(<i>hard!</i>)</small></li>
    <li>Video game console emulator <small>(<i>hard!</i>)</small></li>
</ul>


<br><h3>Text Editor</h3>

<p>We use text editors everyday, but do you know how it really works? Ignoring all of the fancy features that your favorite editor has, how would you implement a textbox that supports a movable text cursor and selecting, inserting, and deleting text? No, you can't use the builtin textbox component from your favorite GUI framework!</p>

<p>The biggest challenge is figuring out how to store the text document in memory. My first thought was to use an array, but that has horrible performance if the user inserts text anywhere other than the end of the document. Luckily, there are some nice data structures to learn to solve this.</p>

<p>Another hurdle was learning how a text cursor behaves in popular editors. For example, if I press the up arrow key with the cursor in the middle of the document, where will the cursor move? Same column? Not if that line is shorter. Keep pressing up. The cursor will snap back to the original column once a line is long enough. It turns out that the cursor has a memory for the column and tries to get back to it. It is these details that I never noticed until I tried to implement it.</p>

<img src="https://austinhenley.com/blog/images/textcursor.gif">

<p>After implementing the basic editor, I challenge you to implement two more features: undo/redo and word wrapping. Implementing undo/redo in an efficient way was mind blowing to me! I first tried keeping an array of previous states, then tried the Memento pattern, before finally settling on the Command pattern. Word wrapping forces you to separate the <i>visual</i> aspects of a text line from the memory aspects.</p>


<p>Things to learn:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Data structures for storing the text: array, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rope_(data_structure)">rope</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gap_buffer">gap buffer</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piece_table">piece table</a>.</li>
    <li>Behavior and implementation of the text cursor.</li>
    <li>Design patterns for undo/redo: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memento_pattern">memento</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_pattern">command</a>.</li>
    <li>Abstractions to separate the visual and memory aspects of the text.</li>
</ul>

</ul>


<br><h3>2D game - Space Invaders</h3>

<p>Even the most simple games require some unique data structures and design patterns. The idea here is to implement a well-defined game from start to finish without getting bogged down on the other fun stuff (e.g., game design and art). Also, it is best if you use a barebones 2D graphics library (e.g., SDL, SFML, PyGame), not a big game engine that'll hide all of the interesting bits from you.</p>

<img src="https://austinhenley.com/blog/images/spaceinvaders.png">

<p>First, you'll have to learn to draw to the screen. I had no idea how this worked. You are actually clearing the screen then drawing each portion of the screen in rapid succession, many times a second, to create the effect that objects are moving.</p>

<p>Second, you'll learn all about the game loop. A game is effectively looping between drawing, getting user input, and processing the game logic.</p>

<p>Third, you'll learn how to process user input. I never paid attention to the subtlties of initially pressing, holding, and releasing keys or mouse buttons, let alone handling things like a double click. And how often do you check for user input? If you are constantly checking then that means the rest of the game is frozen!</p>

<p>Fourth, you'll learn how to create and manage all of your game objects and their state. For example, how do you generate a dynamic number of enemies? The factory pattern helps a lot.</p>

<p>Fifth, you'll learn how to apply the game's logic. When do bullet positions get updated? When do more enemies come onscreen? How do you know when an enemy is destroyed? When is the game over? I had never used the modulo operator prior to making games but it is littered all over my games' code.</p> 

<p>Once you get the basic game working, add a title screen menu, a game over screen, make sure the game runs at the same speed even on different computers, and explore how to implement more interesting enemies with AI. Still not enough? Add shader effects, sound, and online multiplayer!</p>


<p>Things to learn:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Drawing to the screen.</li>
    <li>Handling user input.</li>
    <li>Game loop.</li>
    <li>Creating and managing a dynamic number of objects (e.g., <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factory_(object-oriented_programming)">factory pattern</a>).</li>
    <li>State machines for enemy AI.</li>
    <li>Playing sound.</li>
    <li>Using shaders.</li>
    <li>Networking for online features.</li>
</ul>

<br><h3>Compiler - Tiny BASIC</h3>

<p>The most-eye opening projects I have worked on are compilers. Even now, if I have a free Sunday afternoon to do some coding, chances are it is a compiler. It is a great feeling when you create something that enables others to create more things. By implementing one I had to learn so much more about the intricacies of compilers that I normally would never think about (e.g., when do expressions get implicitly type converted).</p>

<p>I suggest writing the compiler from scratch for a very small BASIC-like language (see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiny_BASIC">Tiny BASIC</a>) and compile to any other language that you know well. For example, you could write a Tiny BASIC compiler in Python that outputs C# code. It does <b>not</b> have to output assembly or C! Avoiding those will let you focus on the compiler itself.</p>

<img src="https://austinhenley.com/blog/images/peaybasic.png">

<p>The first hurdle is figuring out how to lex (or tokenize) the input code. Then you will parse the code, that is check the structure of the input and produce a tree representation of the code. The recursive descent parsing technique is beautiful! Next you will semantically check the input, ensuring the code makes sense and that the type rules are being followed. Finally, you can generate output!</p>

<p>This project has a ton of existing resources to help you, and a simple compiler can be completed in a few days. Don't let the jargon scare you. Plus the possibilities are endless to what you can add! Once you have the basic compiler working, you can add a standard library (in PeayBASIC I added simple 2D graphics functionality), optimization passes, and improve the error messages. Finally, you should write some example programs in your own language to show off to the world!</p>

<br><h3>Mini Operating System</h3>

<p>Over the years I have found myself applying fundamental concepts from operating systems to a variety of domains, like games and even predictive models of human behavior. In a classroom setting the algorithms and data structures used by operating systems might seem abstract or useless, but they really are useful. Implementing an operating system also helped me understand far more about what is going on under the hood.</p>

<img src="https://austinhenley.com/blog/images/marzos.png">

<p>There is a bit of a learning curve and some barriers to get started since it is dependent on hardware. However, by following a book or tutorial then you should be able to get a bootable OS working that can run your own programs. I highly recommend my colleague's free online book, <a href="http://osblog.stephenmarz.com/index.html">Making a RISC-V Operating System using Rust</a>.</p>

<h3>Spreadsheet</h3>

<p>A spreadsheet application, like Excel, combines some of the challenges from a text editor with those of a compiler. You'll have to learn how to represent the cell contents in memory and implement an interpreter for the programming language used for equations.</p>

<br><h3>Video game console emulator</h3>

<p>Writing an emulator (or virtual machine) for a video game console combines the challenges of writing a compiler, an operating system, and a compiler all into one. It is quite rewarding to play a real game made by someone else with your emulator!</p> 

<p>Emulating a real video game console means writing a virtual machine that pretends to function just like the actual CPU and other hardware components. This allows you to run games designed for the video game console with your emulator.</p>

<p>I recommend starting by emulating CHIP-8, which is a simple, fictitious console, before moving on to a real video game console. The NES, SNES, Gameboy, and Gameboy Advance are all quite feasible to emulate, with a far amount of documentation and open source emulators already, though they each have their own quirks to make things interesting (e.g., certain games may rely on undocumented bugs/features of the specific hardware). There is also the PICO-8, which has become a very profitable "fantasy" console.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>WILMINGTON, N.C. (WECT) - Chief Judge Richard Myers ruled on Wednesday that the state violated the First Amendment when it told retired engineer Wayne Nutt to stop expressing his opinions about engineering without a state license, per an Institute for Justice announcement.</p><p>Nutt used his experience as an engineer to give his opinions about the designs of public works on the Internet. The NC Board of Examiners and Surveyors claimed that this was punishable by a misdemeanor unless he obtained a professional engineer’s license from the state.</p><p>“This is a win for more than just me,” said Wayne. “There are a lot of people in the same situation—people who have expertise that they’ve been blocked from talking about. This decision is an affirmation that the First Amendment protects all of our rights to share what we know.”</p><p>You can read the full opinion <a href="https://ij.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Nutt-v.-Ritter-opinion.pdf" target="_blank">online here</a> and find WECT’s previous coverage below:</p><p><i>Copyright 2023 WECT.
