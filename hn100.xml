<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>I‚Äôve written <em>a bit</em> about <a href="https://nixos.org/">Nix</a> and I still face moments where foundational aspects of the package system confounds and surprises me.</p>

<p>Recently I hit an issue that stumped me as it break some basic comprehension I had on how Nix works. I wanted to produce the build and runtime graph for the Ruby interpreter.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>&gt;</span> nix-shell <span>-p</span> ruby

<span>&gt;</span> which ruby
/nix/store/mp4rpz283gw3abvxyb4lbh4vp9pmayp2-ruby-3.3.9/bin/ruby

  <span>$(</span>nix-store <span>--query</span> <span>--deriver</span> <span>$(</span>which ruby<span>))</span>

<span>ls</span>: cannot access <span>'/nix/store/24v9wpp393ib1gllip7ic13aycbi704g-ruby-3.3.9.drv'</span>:

</code></pre></div>

<p>Huh. ü§î</p>

<p>I have Ruby but I don‚Äôt seem to have the derivation, <code>24v9wpp393ib1gllip7ic13aycbi704g</code>, file present on my machine.</p>

<p>No worries, I think I can <code>--realize</code> it and download it from the NixOS cache.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>&gt;</span> nix-store <span>--realize</span> /nix/store/24v9wpp393ib1gllip7ic13aycbi704g-ruby-3.3.9.drv
don<span>'t know how to build these paths:
  /nix/store/24v9wpp393ib1gllip7ic13aycbi704g-ruby-3.3.9.drv
error: cannot build missing derivation '</span>/nix/store/24v9wpp393ib1gllip7ic13aycbi704g-ruby-3.3.9.drv<span>'
</span></code></pre></div>

<p>I guess the NixOS cache doesn‚Äôt seem to have it. ü§∑</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This was actually perplexing me at this moment. In fact there are <a href="https://discourse.nixos.org/t/how-to-get-a-missing-drv-file-for-a-derivation-from-nixpkgs/2300/1">multiple</a> <a href="https://discourse.nixos.org/t/why-isnt-deriver-and-realize-identity-functions-see-example/47490/1">discourse</a> posts about it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My mental model however of Nix though is that I must have first evaluated the derivation (drv) in order to determine the output path to even substitute. How could the NixOS cache not have it present?</p>

<p>Is this derivation wrong somehow? Nope. This is the derivation Nix believes that produced this Ruby binary from the <code>sqlite</code> database. ü§®</p>

<div><pre><code><span>&gt;</span> sqlite3 <span>"/nix/var/nix/db/db.sqlite"</span> 
    <span>"select deriver from ValidPaths where path = 
    '/nix/store/mp4rpz283gw3abvxyb4lbh4vp9pmayp2-ruby-3.3.9'"</span>
/nix/store/24v9wpp393ib1gllip7ic13aycbi704g-ruby-3.3.9.drv
</code></pre></div>

<p>What does the binary cache itself say? Even the cache itself thinks this particular derivation, <code>24v9wpp393ib1gllip7ic13aycbi704g</code>, produced this particular Ruby output.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>&gt;</span> curl <span>-s</span> https://cache.nixos.org/mp4rpz283gw3abvxyb4lbh4vp9pmayp2.narinfo |<span>\</span>
  <span>grep </span>Deriver
Deriver: 24v9wpp393ib1gllip7ic13aycbi704g-ruby-3.3.9.drv
</code></pre></div>

<p>What if I try a different command?</p>

<div><pre><code><span>&gt;</span> nix derivation show <span>$(</span>which ruby<span>)</span> | jq <span>-r</span> <span>"keys[0]"</span>
/nix/store/kmx8kkggm5i2r17s6l67v022jz9gc4c5-ruby-3.3.9.drv

<span>&gt;</span> <span>ls</span> /nix/store/kmx8kkggm5i2r17s6l67v022jz9gc4c5-ruby-3.3.9.drv
/nix/store/kmx8kkggm5i2r17s6l67v022jz9gc4c5-ruby-3.3.9.drv
</code></pre></div>

<p>So I seem to have a completely different derivation, <code>kmx8kkggm5i2r17s6l67v022jz9gc4c5</code>, that resulted in the same output which <em>is not</em> what the binary cache announces. WTF? ü´†</p>

<p>Thinking back to a previous post, I remember touching on <a href="https://fzakaria.com/2025/03/28/what-s-in-a-nix-store-path">modulo fixed-output derivations</a>. Is that what‚Äôs going on? Let‚Äôs investigate from first principles. ü§ì</p>

<p>Let‚Äôs first create <code>fod.nix</code> which is our <em>fixed-output derivation</em>.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>let</span>
  <span>system</span> <span>=</span> <span>builtins</span><span>.</span><span>currentSystem</span><span>;</span>
<span>in</span> <span>derivation</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>name</span> <span>=</span> <span>"hello-world-fixed"</span><span>;</span>
  <span>builder</span> <span>=</span> <span>"/bin/sh"</span><span>;</span>
  <span>system</span> <span>=</span> <span>system</span><span>;</span>
  <span>args</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span> <span>"-c"</span> <span>''</span><span>
</span><span>    echo -n "hello world" &gt; "$out"</span><span>
</span><span>  ''</span> <span>];</span>
  <span>outputHashMode</span> <span>=</span> <span>"flat"</span><span>;</span>
  <span>outputHashAlgo</span> <span>=</span> <span>"sha256"</span><span>;</span>
  <span>outputHash</span> <span>=</span> <span>"b94d27b9934d3e08a52e52d7da7dabfac484efe37a5380ee9088f7ace2efcde9"</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>‚òùÔ∏è Since this is a <em>fixed-output derivation</em> (FOD) the produced <code>/nix/store</code> path will not be affected to changes to the derivation beyond the contents of <code>$out</code>.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>&gt;</span> nix-instantiate fod.nix
/nix/store/k2wjpwq43685j6vlvaarrfml4gl4196n-hello-world-fixed.drv

<span>&gt;</span> nix-build fod.nix
/nix/store/ajk19jb8h5h3lmz20yz6wj9vif18lhp1-hello-world-fixed
</code></pre></div>

<p>Now we will create a derivation that uses this FOD.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>{</span> <span>fodDrv</span> <span>?</span> <span>import</span> <span>./fod.nix</span> <span>}:</span>

<span>let</span>
  <span>system</span> <span>=</span> <span>builtins</span><span>.</span><span>currentSystem</span><span>;</span>
<span>in</span>
<span>builtins</span><span>.</span><span>derivation</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>name</span> <span>=</span> <span>"uses-fod"</span><span>;</span>
  <span>inherit</span> <span>system</span><span>;</span>
  <span>builder</span> <span>=</span> <span>"/bin/sh"</span><span>;</span>
  <span>args</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span> <span>"-c"</span> <span>''</span><span>
</span><span>    echo </span><span>${</span><span>fodDrv</span><span>}</span><span> &gt; $out</span><span>
</span><span>    echo "Good bye world" &gt;&gt; $out</span><span>
</span><span>  ''</span> <span>];</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>The <code>/nix/store</code> for the output for this derivation <em>will change</em> on changes to the derivation <strong>except</strong> if the derivation path for the FOD changes. This is in fact what makes it ‚Äúmodulo‚Äù the fixed-output derivations.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>&gt;</span> nix-instantiate uses-fod.nix
/nix/store/85d15y7irq7x4fxv4nc7k1cw2rlfp3ag-uses-fod.drv

<span>&gt;</span> nix-build uses-fod.nix
/nix/store/sd12qjak7rlxhdprj10187f9an787lk3-uses-fod
</code></pre></div>

<p>Let‚Äôs test this all out by changing our <code>fod.nix</code> derivation.
Let‚Äôs do this by just adding some <em>garbage</em> attribute to the derivation.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>@@ -4,6 +4,7 @@</span>
   name = "hello-world-fixed";
   builder = "/bin/sh";
   system = system;
<span>+  garbage = 123;
</span>   args = [ "-c" ''
     echo -n "hello world" &gt; "$out"
   '' ];
</code></pre></div>

<p>What happens now?</p>

<div><pre><code><span>&gt;</span> nix-instantiate fod.nix
/nix/store/yimff0d4zr4krwx6cvdiqlin0y6vkis0-hello-world-fixed.drv

<span>&gt;</span> nix-build fod.nix
/nix/store/ajk19jb8h5h3lmz20yz6wj9vif18lhp1-hello-world-fixed
</code></pre></div>

<p>The path of the derivation itself, <code>.drv</code>, has changed but the output path <code>ajk19jb8h5h3lmz20yz6wj9vif18lhp1</code> remains consistent.</p>

<p>What about the derivation that leverages it?</p>

<div><pre><code><span>&gt;</span> nix-instantiate uses-fod.nix
/nix/store/85wkdaaq6q08f71xn420v4irll4a8g8v-uses-fod.drv

<span>&gt;</span> nix-build uses-fod.nix
/nix/store/sd12qjak7rlxhdprj10187f9an787lk3-uses-fod
</code></pre></div>

<p>It also got a new derivation path but the output path remained unchanged. üòÆ</p>

<p>That means changes to <em>fixed-output-derivations</em> didn‚Äôt cause new outputs in either derivation <em>but</em> it did create a complete new tree of <code>.drv</code> files. ü§Ø</p>

<p>That means in <a href="https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs">nixpkgs</a> changes to <em>fixed-output</em> derivations can cause them to have new store paths for their <code>.drv</code> but result in dependent derivations to have the same output path. If the output path had already been stored in the NixOS cache, then we lose the link between the new <code>.drv</code> and this output path. üí•</p>

<p><img src="https://fzakaria.com/assets/images/derivation_madness.svg" alt="Derivation graphic"></p>

<p>The amount of churn that we are creating in derivations was unbeknownst to me.</p>

<p>It can get even weirder! This example came from <a href="https://github.com/ericson2314">@ericson2314</a>.</p>

<p>We will duplicate the <code>fod.nix</code> to another file <code>fod2.nix</code> whose only difference is the value of the garbage.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>@@ -4,7 +4,7 @@</span>
   name = "hello-world-fixed";

</span>   args = [ "-c" ''
     echo -n "hello world" &gt; "$out"
   '' ];
</code></pre></div>

<p>Let‚Äôs now use both of these in our derivation.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>{</span> <span>fodDrv</span> <span>?</span> <span>import</span> <span>./fod.nix</span><span>,</span>

</span><span>  ''</span> <span>];</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>We can now instantiate and build this as normal.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>&gt;</span> nix-instantiate uses-fod.nix
/nix/store/z6nr2k2hy982fiynyjkvq8dliwbxklwf-uses-fod.drv

<span>&gt;</span> nix-build uses-fod.nix
/nix/store/211nlyx2ga7mh5fdk76aggb04y1wsgkj-uses-fod
</code></pre></div>

<p>What is weird about that?</p>

<p>Well, let‚Äôs take the JSON representation of the derivation and remove one of the inputs.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>&gt;</span> nix derivation show <span>\</span>
    /nix/store/z6nr2k2hy982fiynyjkvq8dliwbxklwf-uses-fod.drv <span>\</span>

<span>"/nix/store/6p93r6x0bwyd8gngf5n4r432n6l380ry-hello-world-fixed.drv"</span>
<span>"/nix/store/yimff0d4zr4krwx6cvdiqlin0y6vkis0-hello-world-fixed.drv"</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>We can do this because although there are two input derivations, we know they both produce the same output!</p>

<div><pre><code><span>@@ -12,12 +12,6 @@</span>
       "system": "x86_64-linux"
     },
     "inputDrvs": {

         "dynamicOutputs": {},
         "outputs": [
</code></pre></div>

<p>Let‚Äôs load this modified derivation back into our <code>/nix/store</code> and build it again!</p>

<div><pre><code><span>&gt;</span> nix derivation add &lt; derivation.json

/nix/store/211nlyx2ga7mh5fdk76aggb04y1wsgkj-uses-fod
</code></pre></div>

<p>We got the same output <code>211nlyx2ga7mh5fdk76aggb04y1wsgkj</code>. Not only do we have a <code>1:N</code> trait for our output paths to derivations but we can also take certain derivations and completely change them by removing inputs and still get the same output! üòπ</p>

<p>The road to Nix enlightenment is no joke and full of dragons.</p>

          </h3>
          <p>The Nim Team is happy to announce version 2.2.6, the third patch release for our stable release, Nim 2.2.</p>

<p>It comes six months after the 2.2.4 release and it contains <a href="https://github.com/nim-lang/Nim/compare/v2.2.4...v2.2.6">141 commits</a>, bringing bugfixes and improvements.</p>

<p>If you‚Äôre still on Nim 1.6, take a look at the <a href="https://nim-lang.org/blog/2023/08/01/nim-v20-released.html">version 2.0 release article</a> to see all the features you‚Äôre missing.
If you‚Äôve been using Nim 2.0, the <a href="https://nim-lang.org/blog/2024/10/02/nim-220-2010.html">version 2.2 release article</a> shows the improvements available in Nim 2.2.</p>

<p>The Nim 2.2.6 changelog is available <a href="https://github.com/nim-lang/Nim/blob/v2.2.6/changelog.md">here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="highlights">Highlights</h2>

<p>Exception handling combined with Nim‚Äôs <code>async</code> is more stable than ever before
as the underlying closure iterator transformation has been rewritten.</p>

<p>The compiler is now smart enough to produce a move operation for <code>return obj.field</code>.
Previously it performed a copy.
Expect your code to run slightly faster due to this and other minor performance improvements.</p>

<h2 id="installing-nim-226">Installing Nim 2.2.6</h2>

<p>Check out if the package manager of your OS already ships version 2.2.6 or
install it as described <a href="https://nim-lang.org/install.html">here</a>.</p>

<p>If you have installed a previous version of Nim using <code>choosenim</code>,
getting Nim 2.2.6 is as easy as:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>$ </span>choosenim update self
<span>$ </span>choosenim update stable
</code></pre>
</div>

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> We recommend you to install and use the latest version of <code>choosenim</code>, v.0.8.16, available in <a href="https://github.com/nim-lang/choosenim">our choosenim repo</a>.</p>

<p>GitHub releases now support immutability, adding a new layer of supply chain security. With immutable releases, assets and tags are protected from tampering after publication, so the software you publish‚Äîand your users consume‚Äîremains secure and trustworthy.</p>
<h3 id="about-immutable-releases"><a href="#about-immutable-releases">About immutable releases</a></h3>
<p>Immutable releases offer:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Immutable assets</strong>: Once you publish a release as immutable, its assets can‚Äôt be added, modified, or deleted. This helps protect distributed artifacts from supply chain attacks.</li>
<li><strong>Tag protection</strong>: Tags for new immutable releases are protected and can‚Äôt be deleted or moved.</li>
<li><strong>Release attestations</strong>: Immutable releases receive signed attestations so you can easily verify the authenticity and integrity of assets, both on GitHub and in external environments.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="how-to-enable-immutable-releases"><a href="#how-to-enable-immutable-releases">How to enable immutable releases</a></h3>
<p>You can enable immutable releases at the repository or organization level in your settings. Once enabled:</p>
<ul>
<li>All new releases are immutable (i.e., assets are locked and tags are protected).</li>
<li>Existing releases remain mutable unless you republish them.</li>
</ul>
<p>Disabling immutability doesn‚Äôt affect releases created while it was enabled. They remain immutable.</p>
<h3 id="release-attestations-and-verification"><a href="#release-attestations-and-verification">Release attestations and verification</a></h3>
<p>Release attestations let you verify that an artifact is authentic and unchanged, even outside GitHub. Attestations use the <a href="https://docs.sigstore.dev/about/bundle/">Sigstore bundle format</a>, so you can easily verify releases and assets using the GitHub CLI or integrate with any Sigstore-compatible tooling to automate policy enforcement in your CI/CD pipelines. For instructions on how to verify the integrity of a release, see <a href="https://docs.github.com/code-security/supply-chain-security/understanding-your-software-supply-chain/verifying-the-integrity-of-a-release?tool=cli?utm_source=changelog-docs-immutable-releases&amp;utm_medium=changelog&amp;utm_campaign=universe25">our docs on verifying the integrity of a release</a>.</p>

            <p>Nearly everyone has experienced it: After a night of poor sleep, you don‚Äôt feel as alert as you should. Your brain might seem foggy, and your mind drifts off when you should be paying attention.</p><p>A new study from MIT reveals what happens inside the brain as these momentary failures of attention occur. The scientists found that during these lapses, a wave of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flows out of the brain ‚Äî a process that typically occurs during sleep and helps to wash away waste products that have built up during the day. This flushing is believed to be necessary for maintaining a healthy, normally functioning brain.</p><p>When a person is sleep-deprived, it appears that their body attempts to catch up on this cleansing process by initiating pulses of CSF flow. However, this comes at a cost of dramatically impaired attention.</p><p>‚ÄúIf you don‚Äôt sleep, the CSF waves start to intrude into wakefulness where normally you wouldn‚Äôt see them. However, they come with an attentional tradeoff, where attention fails during the moments that you have this wave of fluid flow,‚Äù says Laura Lewis, the Athinoula A. Martinos Associate Professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, a member of MIT‚Äôs Institute for Medical Engineering and Science and the Research Laboratory of Electronics, and an associate member of the Picower Institute for Learning and Memory.</p><p>Lewis is the senior author of the study, which <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-025-02098-8" target="_blank">appears today</a> in <em>Nature Neuroscience</em>. MIT visiting graduate student Zinong Yang&nbsp;is the lead author of the paper.</p><p><strong>Flushing the brain</strong></p><p>Although sleep is a critical biological process, it‚Äôs not known exactly why it is so important. It appears to be essential for maintaining alertness, and it has been well-documented that sleep deprivation leads to impairments of attention and other cognitive functions.</p><p>During sleep, the cerebrospinal fluid that cushions the brain helps to remove waste that has built up during the day. In a 2019&nbsp;<a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aax5440" target="_blank">study</a>, Lewis and colleagues showed that CSF flow during sleep follows a rhythmic pattern in and out of the brain, and that these flows are linked to changes in brain waves during sleep.</p><p>That finding led Lewis to wonder what might happen to CSF flow after sleep deprivation. To explore that question, she and her colleagues recruited 26 volunteers who were tested twice ‚Äî once following a night of sleep deprivation in the lab, and once when they were well-rested.</p><p>In the morning, the researchers monitored several different measures of brain and body function as the participants performed a task that is commonly used to evaluate the effects of sleep deprivation.</p><p>During the task, each participant wore an electroencephalogram (EEG) cap that could record brain waves while they were also in a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scanner. The researchers used a modified version of fMRI that allowed them to measure not only blood oxygenation in the brain, but also the flow of CSF in and out of the brain. They also measured each subject‚Äôs heart rate, breathing rate, and pupil diameter.</p><p>The participants performed two attentional tasks while in the fMRI scanner, one visual and one auditory. For the visual task, they had to look at a screen that had a fixed cross. At random intervals, the cross would turn into a square, and the participants were told to press a button whenever they saw this happen. For the auditory task, they would hear a beep instead of seeing a visual transformation.</p><p>Sleep-deprived participants performed much worse than well-rested participants on these tasks, as expected. Their response times were slower, and for some of the stimuli, the participants never registered the change at all.</p><p>During these momentary lapses of attention, the researchers identified several physiological changes that occurred at the same time. Most significantly, they found a flux of CSF out of the brain just as those lapses occurred. After each lapse, CSF flowed back into the brain.</p><p>‚ÄúThe results are suggesting that at the moment that attention fails, this fluid is actually being expelled outward away from the brain. And when attention recovers, it‚Äôs drawn back in,‚Äù Lewis says.</p><p>The researchers hypothesize that when the brain is sleep-deprived, it begins to compensate for the loss of the cleansing that normally occurs during sleep, even though these pulses of CSF flow&nbsp;come with the cost of attention loss.</p><p>‚ÄúOne way to think about those events is because your brain is so in need of sleep, it tries its best to enter into a sleep-like state to restore some cognitive functions,‚Äù Yang says. ‚ÄúYour brain‚Äôs fluid system is trying to restore function by pushing the brain to iterate between high-attention and high-flow states.‚Äù</p><p><strong>A unified circuit</strong></p><p>The researchers also found several other physiological events linked to attentional lapses, including decreases in breathing and heart rate, along with constriction of the pupils. They found that pupil constriction began about 12 seconds before CSF flowed out of the brain, and pupils dilated again after the attentional lapse.</p><p>‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs interesting is it seems like this isn‚Äôt just a phenomenon in the brain, it‚Äôs also a body-wide event. It suggests that there‚Äôs a tight coordination of these systems, where when your attention fails, you might feel it perceptually and psychologically, but it‚Äôs also reflecting an event that‚Äôs happening throughout the brain and body,‚Äù Lewis says.</p><p>This close linkage between disparate events may indicate that there is a single circuit that controls both attention and bodily functions such as fluid flow, heart rate, and arousal, according to the researchers.</p><p>‚ÄúThese results suggest to us that there‚Äôs a unified circuit that‚Äôs governing both what we think of as very high-level functions of the brain ‚Äî our attention, our ability to perceive and respond to the world ‚Äî and then also really basic fundamental physiological processes like fluid dynamics of the brain, brain-wide blood flow, and blood vessel constriction,‚Äù Lewis says.</p><p>In this study, the researchers did not explore what circuit might be controlling this switching, but one good candidate, they say, is the noradrenergic system. Recent research has shown that this system, which regulates many cognitive and bodily functions through the neurotransmitter norepinephrine, oscillates during normal sleep.</p><p>The research was funded by the National Institutes of Health, a National Defense Science and Engineering Graduate Research Fellowship, a NAWA Fellowship, a McKnight Scholar Award, a Sloan Fellowship, a Pew Biomedical Scholar Award, a One Mind Rising Star Award, and the Simons Collaboration on Plasticity in the Aging Brain.</p>

            <span>Abstract:</span>Large language models (LLMs) have shown significant progress in reasoning tasks. However, recent studies show that transformers and LLMs fail catastrophically once reasoning problems exceed modest complexity. We revisit these findings through the lens of large reasoning models (LRMs) -- LLMs fine-tuned with incentives for step-by-step argumentation and self-verification. LRM performance on graph and reasoning benchmarks such as NLGraph seem extraordinary, with some even claiming they are capable of generalized reasoning and innovation in reasoning-intensive fields such as mathematics, physics, medicine, and law. However, by more carefully scaling the complexity of reasoning problems, we show existing benchmarks actually have limited complexity. We develop a new dataset, the Deep Reasoning Dataset (DeepRD), along with a generative process for producing unlimited examples of scalable complexity. We use this dataset to evaluate model performance on graph connectivity and natural language proof planning. We find that the performance of LRMs drop abruptly at sufficient complexity and do not generalize. We also relate our LRM results to the distributions of the complexities of large, real-world knowledge graphs, interaction graphs, and proof datasets. We find the majority of real-world examples fall inside the LRMs' success regime, yet the long tails expose substantial failure potential. Our analysis highlights the near-term utility of LRMs while underscoring the need for new methods that generalize beyond the complexity of examples in the training distribution.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-journey-hook="grid-wrapper" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><figure data-testid="cne-audio-embed-figure"></figure><p>Last week, as <em>ICE</em> raids ramped up in New York, city residents set about resisting in the ways they had available: confronting agents directly on sidewalks, haranguing them as they processed down blocks, and recording them on phone cameras held aloft. Relentless <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2025/08/11/ices-spectacle-of-intimidation">documentation</a> has proved something of an effective tool against President Donald Trump‚Äôs empowerment of <em>ICE</em>; agents have taken to wearing masks in fear of exposure, and the proliferation of imagery showing armed police and mobilized National Guard troops in otherwise calm cities has underlined the cruel absurdity of their activities. Activist memes have been minted on social media: a woman on New York‚Äôs Canal Street, dressed in a polka-dotted office-casual dress, flipping <em>ICE</em> agents off; a man in Washington, D.C., throwing a Subway sandwich at a federal agent in August. The recent ‚ÄúNo Kings‚Äù marches were filled with protesters in inflatable frog costumes, inspired by a similarly outfitted man who got pepper-sprayed protesting outside the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Building in Portland, Oregon. Some might write the memes off as resistance porn, but digital content is at least serving as a lively defense mechanism in the absence of functional politics.</p><p>At the same time, social media has served as a reinvigorated source of transparency in recent weeks, harking back to the days when Twitter became an organizing tool during the Arab Spring, in the early twenty-tens, or when Facebook and Instagram helped fuel the Black Lives Matter marches of 2020. The grassroots optimism of that earlier social-media era is long gone, though, replaced by a sense of posting as a last resort. After Trump authorized the deployment of the National Guard <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/the-lede/the-conflict-on-the-streets-of-chicago">in Chicago</a> earlier this month, the governor of Illinois, J.&nbsp;B. Pritzker, told residents to ‚Äúrecord and narrate what you see‚Äîput it on social media.‚Äù But, if the anti-<em>MAGA</em> opposition is taking advantage of the internet, <em>ICE</em> and the Trump Administration are, too. Right-wing creators have been using the same channels to identify and publicize targets for raids. According to reporting in Semafor, the Trump-friendly YouTuber Nick Shirley‚Äôs videos of African migrant vendors on Canal Street seemed to help drive recent <em>ICE</em> sweeps of the area. <em>ICE</em> itself is also working to monitor social media. The investigative outlet <em>The Lever</em> found documents revealing that the agency has enlisted an A.I.-driven surveillance product called Zignal Labs that creates ‚Äúcurated detection feeds‚Äù to aid in criminal investigations. According to reporting in <em>Wired</em>, <em>ICE</em> also has plans to build out a team of dozens of analysts to monitor social media and identify targets. Recent videos, identified by 404 Media and other publications, have purportedly shown <em>ICE</em> agents using technology developed by the data-analytics firm Palantir, founded by Peter Thiel and others, to scan social-media accounts, government records, and biometrics data of those they detain. Social media has become a political panopticon in which your posts are a conduit for your politics, and what you post can increasingly be used against you.</p><p>Meanwhile, a new wave of digital tools has emerged to help surveil the surveillants. The apps ICEBlock, Red Dot, and DEICER all allow users to pinpoint where <em>ICE</em> agents are active, forming an online version of a whisper network to alert potential targets. Eyes Up provides a way for users to record and upload footage of abusive law-enforcement activity, building an archive of potential evidence. Its creator is a software developer named Mark (who uses only his first name to separate the project from his professional work); he was inspired to create Eyes Up earlier this year, when he began seeing clips of <em>ICE</em> abductions and harassment circulating on social media and worried about their shelf life. As he put it to me, ‚ÄúThey could disappear at any given moment, whether the platforms decide to moderate, whether the individual deletes their account or the post.‚Äù</p><p>Ultimately, the app itself was also vulnerable to sudden disappearance. After launching, on September 1st, Eyes Up accumulated thousands of downloads and thousands of minutes of uploaded footage. Then, on October 3rd, Mark received a notice that Apple was removing the app from its store on the grounds that it may ‚Äúharm a targeted individual or group.‚Äù Eyes Up is not alone. ICEBlock and Red Dot have been blocked from both Apple and Google‚Äôs app stores, the two largest marketplaces; DEICER, like Eyes Up, was removed by Apple. Pressure on the tech platforms seemed to come from the Trump Administration; after a deadly shooting at an <em>ICE</em> field office in Dallas in late September, the Attorney General, Pam Bondi, said in a statement to Fox News Digital that ICEBlock ‚Äúput ICE agents at risk just for doing their jobs.‚Äù Mark is contesting Apple‚Äôs decision about Eyes Up through its official channels, and the creator of ICEBlock, Joshua Aaron, has argued that his app should be treated no differently than services, such as Google‚Äôs Waze, that allow users to warn one another of highway speed traps. But for now they must try to make do with a limited reach.</p></div><div data-journey-hook="grid-wrapper" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>The politicized removal of these tools reflects an irony‚Äî<em>ICE</em> is aggrieved that its own tactics have been turned against it. Mark described a ‚Äúdouble standard‚Äù: applications of technology that are friendly to the Administration‚Äôs goals are going unchallenged, in part because tech companies have become increasingly willing to support the President‚Äôs whims. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs clear whose rules they‚Äôre following, who they are trying to win over,‚Äù Mark said. Like other forms of self expression, digital-communication technology has become dangerously circumscribed under Trump; only the tools that exist independent of Big Tech seem like safe bets for dissent. Posting clips of the polka-dotted-dress lady on social media might be cathartic, but it will take the resistance only so far.</p><p>Still, we record and we post because it‚Äôs better than the alternative, which is suffering governmental predations in silence. This past weekend, a friend of mine in Washington, D.C., where I live, sent a photo she had taken of armed National Guard members patrolling the Sunday-morning farmers‚Äô market in Dupont Circle. Trump‚Äôs militarized policing has operated on and off in the city <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2025/08/25/trump-sends-in-the-national-guard">since August</a>, when the Administration seized control of the local police force, and residents have become all too accustomed to seeing camouflaged troops intrude on our daily routines. Most often, I encounter them walking through largely empty residential streets in the middle of the afternoon, and I take photos with my phone to mark the ominous superfluity of the exercise: our President‚Äôs extreme and dangerous response to a nonexistent emergency. Sharing footage is a small reminder that this is really happening.&nbsp;‚ô¶</p></div></div>]]></description>

<p dir="auto">Kimi Linear is a hybrid linear attention architecture that outperforms traditional full attention methods across various contexts, including short, long, and reinforcement learning (RL) scaling regimes.
At it's core is Kimi Delta Attention (KDA)‚Äîa refined version of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06464" rel="nofollow">Gated DeltaNet</a> that introduces a more efficient gating mechanism to optimize the use of finite-state RNN memory.</p>
<p dir="auto">Kimi Linear achieves superior performance and hardware efficiency, especially for long-context tasks. It reduces the need for large KV caches by up to 75% and boosts decoding throughput by up to <math-renderer data-run-id="f25158f9fd31eccbf36457b4050ca2f6">$6\times$</math-renderer> for context as long as 1M tokens.</p>
<p dir="auto">We open-sourced the KDA kernel in <a href="https://github.com/fla-org/flash-linear-attention/tree/main/fla/ops/kda">FLA</a>, and released two versions model checkpoints trained with 5.7T tokens.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
			
<p>For years, one of my businesses has been a regular user of <strong>Wise</strong> (formerly TransferWise). Wise is a financial service that lets you send and receive money across currencies, often at a better rate and lower fee than traditional banks. Sounds great, right?</p>



<p>Until it isn‚Äôt.</p>



<p>This is our story ‚Äì a sobering, frustrating, and frankly <em>appalling</em> experience that ended with our business and personal accounts being shut down, without any meaningful reason, support, or recourse.</p>



<p>And all we did? We <strong>updated our address</strong>.</p>



<hr>



<h2><strong>üè¢ A Routine Change Turned Nightmare</strong></h2>



<p>Like many businesses, we recently moved into a new office. Alongside the usual updates to suppliers and records, we updated our <strong>physical address</strong> with Wise. Not long after, we received an email requesting us to <strong>verify</strong> the new address.</p>



<p>Fair enough ‚Äì we had no problem with that.</p>



<p>Wise provided a dropdown list of acceptable documents: a lease agreement, rates notice, tax document, utilities bill, or telecommunications bill. Due to our company structure, most of those documents are in the name of our parent company or show our PO Box (which NZ Post requires, since they won‚Äôt deliver to our street address). But we had a <strong>telecommunications bill</strong> that ticked every box:</p>



<ul>
<li>Correct entity name ‚úÖ</li>



<li>Correct physical street address ‚úÖ</li>



<li>Even detailed our fibre connection at the new premises ‚úÖ</li>
</ul>



<p>So we uploaded it ‚Äì and assumed that would be the end of it.</p>



<p><strong>We were so wrong.</strong></p>



<hr>



<h2><strong>üìû The Call That Made No Sense</strong></h2>



<p>Days later, we received an email: our document was <strong>rejected</strong>. </p>



<blockquote>
<figure><img decoding="async" width="593" height="327" src="https://shaun.nz/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-1.png" alt="" srcset="https://shaun.nz/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-1.png 593w, https://shaun.nz/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-1-300x165.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 593px) 100vw, 593px"></figure>
</blockquote>



<p>No clear reason. So, I called Wise and explained the situation to the customer service representative.</p>



<p>Her response left me stunned.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>‚ÄúThe document was rejected because it was a <em>tax invoice</em>, not a <em>bill</em>.‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Wait‚Ä¶ what?</p>



<p>I paused, trying to process this. I politely explained that in <strong>New Zealand, a ‚Äútax invoice‚Äù is a legal form of a bill</strong> ‚Äì even down to the name ‚Äútax invoice‚Äù being a legal requirement by IRD, and that‚Äôs how telecommunications companies issue invoices here. But she refused to accept it.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>‚ÄúIt needs to say <em>Telecommunications Bill</em> at the top,‚Äù she insisted.</p>
</blockquote>



<blockquote>
<p>‚ÄúA tax invoice isn‚Äôt acceptable.‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>



<p>This is simply <strong>not true</strong>, and completely out of touch with New Zealand‚Äôs business documentation standards. The rep wouldn‚Äôt budge.</p>



<hr>



<h2><strong>üß† The ‚ÄúSolution‚Äù That Was Beyond Belief</strong></h2>



<p>Still trying to find a solution, I asked: <em>what do you recommend I do then?</em></p>



<p>Her answer?</p>



<blockquote>
<p>‚ÄúYou should find a local shared workspace, lease a desk under your company name, change your registered office to that address, and use that lease document to verify your address with us.‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Yes, you read that right.</p>



<p>Wise‚Äôs advice was to <strong>artificially lease a desk we didn‚Äôt need, change our registered address, and use that document</strong> ‚Äì just to verify an address we actually operate from.</p>



<p>I asked to speak to a manager. That request was <strong>refused</strong>. She told me, flatly:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>‚ÄúI <em>am</em> providing you with the correct information.‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>



<p>A bit more back and forth‚Ä¶ then the call <strong>was disconnected</strong>.</p>



<hr>



<h2><strong>üìû A Glimmer of Hope ‚Äì Then The Hammer Falls</strong></h2>



<p>Later that day, I received a call back from Wise ‚Äì not from a manager (because apparently, <strong>Wise doesn‚Äôt have managers</strong>), but from a more ‚Äúsenior‚Äù representative.</p>



<p>This rep was <strong>more empathetic</strong> and agreed the document should have been acceptable. She escalated the issue, resubmitted the document herself, and said she‚Äôd personally follow up if it was rejected again.</p>



<p>Progress, I thought.</p>



<p>Until the next morning.</p>



<hr>



<h2><strong>üö´ ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve Restricted Your Account‚Äù</strong></h2>



<p>I woke to an email with a stunning subject line:</p>



<blockquote>
<p><strong>‚ÄúWe‚Äôve restricted your account‚Äù</strong></p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="525" height="467" src="https://shaun.nz/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-2.png" alt="" srcset="https://shaun.nz/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-2.png 525w, https://shaun.nz/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-2-300x267.png 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 525px) 100vw, 525px"></figure>
</blockquote>



<p>Just like that, our <strong>entire business account</strong> was locked. No warning. No reason. No discussion.</p>



<p>We could no longer send or receive money, use our Wise cards, or even contact support. The email stated:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>‚ÄúDue to our current risk policies, your account will be closed in a few months. You will not be able to use support channels.‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Even worse? My <strong>personal Wise account</strong> was locked too. The same personal account which did have its address fully verified, by a rates invoice for my personal address.</p>



<p>Both had <strong>funds inside</strong>.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="915" height="115" src="https://shaun.nz/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-4.png" alt="" srcset="https://shaun.nz/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-4.png 915w, https://shaun.nz/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-4-300x38.png 300w, https://shaun.nz/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-4-768x97.png 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 915px) 100vw, 915px"></figure>



<hr>



<h2><strong>üßæ An ‚ÄúAppeal‚Äù That Wasn‚Äôt an Appeal</strong></h2>



<p>The email offered an option to <strong>appeal</strong>. Naturally, I did.</p>



<p>The appeal process asked for our <strong>articles of incorporation</strong> and <strong>share registry</strong>. No problem.</p>



<p>Then it asked us to provide our preferred currency, and <strong>bank account details to refund the balances</strong>.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="490" src="https://shaun.nz/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-3-1024x490.png" alt="" srcset="https://shaun.nz/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-3-1024x490.png 1024w, https://shaun.nz/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-3-300x144.png 300w, https://shaun.nz/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-3-768x368.png 768w, https://shaun.nz/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-3.png 1059w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>Wait‚Ä¶ I thought this was an appeal? A chance to discuss and resolve the issue?</p>



<p>Nope.</p>



<p>That was the end. There was <strong>no opportunity to explain anything</strong>, no communication, no questions asked. The decision was made, and we were <strong>locked out</strong>, permanently.</p>



<hr>



<h2><strong>üîÅ Let‚Äôs Recap</strong></h2>



<p>To summarise the absurdity of this:</p>



<ul>
<li>We moved office, and updated our address with Wise</li>



<li>We provided a legal, NZ-compliant <strong>telecommunications bill</strong> showing our entity and address</li>



<li>It was rejected because it was labelled a ‚ÄúTax Invoice‚Äù</li>



<li>A rep told us to lease a coworking desk elsewhere just to get a different document</li>



<li>A senior rep agreed we were right, and escalated it</li>



<li>Then <strong>our accounts were shut down ‚Äì with no explanation or recourse</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>Even trying to call support now gets an automated message: ‚ÄúBecause your account is restricted, we cannot connect you.‚Äù</p>



<hr>



<h2><strong>‚ö†Ô∏è Our Final Word: Be Very, Very Careful</strong></h2>



<p>We had used Wise for <strong>years</strong>. Regular monthly supplier payments. International stock orders. Five-figure transactions. Never a problem ‚Äì until this. A minor change triggered a totally flawed process that <strong>completely shut us out</strong>, with no transparency or logical path to resolution.</p>



<p>We‚Äôre not alone ‚Äì a quick search shows <strong>many others facing similar horror stories</strong> with Wise.</p>



<p>So this is my word of warning:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>üí° <strong>Don‚Äôt put all your eggs in the Wise basket.</strong></p>
</blockquote>



<p>If you‚Äôre a business, don‚Äôt rely on them as your sole means of transferring funds. For us, it‚Äôs back to traditional banks ‚Äì slower, yes, but at least <strong>they have humans you can talk to, and actual escalation paths</strong>.</p>



<hr>



<h2>üßæ <strong>28th October update on our Wise debacle ‚Äì it gets worse.</strong></h2>



<p>Following the so-called ‚Äúappeal‚Äù (which gave us no option to provide any information), we received the unsurprising outcome: Wise has decided to <strong>keep our accounts closed</strong> as we had <strong>breached their acceptable use policy</strong>. ü§®</p>



<blockquote>

</blockquote>



<p>What was surprising, however, was the <strong>reason</strong> they gave after I queried what was breached in Wise‚Äôs Acceptable Use Policy:</p>



<p>I was told my <strong>personal account</strong> was being closed for allegedly breaching their Acceptable Use Policy ‚Äî specifically, section 1.4.e, which states <em>‚Äúyou may not use your personal Wise account to receive business payments.‚Äù</em></p>



<blockquote>
<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="751" height="193" src="https://shaun.nz/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-7.png" alt="" srcset="https://shaun.nz/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-7.png 751w, https://shaun.nz/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-7-300x77.png 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 751px) 100vw, 751px"></figure>
</blockquote>



<p>That‚Äôs‚Ä¶ news to me.</p>



<p>I‚Äôve <strong>never</strong> used my personal account for business transactions ‚Äî in fact, over 99% of transfers were to overseas family members. When I asked for clarification or examples, I got none. Just a vague statement and the very strange line:</p>



<blockquote>
<p><em>‚ÄúJust because we can‚Äôt offer you our services going forward doesn‚Äôt mean that we think your business activities are illegal or illegitimate ‚Äî it just means that we don‚Äôt support those types of activities.‚Äù</em></p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="772" height="375" src="https://shaun.nz/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-8.png" alt="" srcset="https://shaun.nz/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-8.png 772w, https://shaun.nz/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-8-300x146.png 300w, https://shaun.nz/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-8-768x373.png 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 772px) 100vw, 772px"></figure>
</blockquote>



<p>What activities?! Again, <strong>no explanation provided.</strong></p>



<p>To make matters worse ‚Äî our business account‚Äôs refund transfer <strong>failed</strong>. Why? Because it requires documentation ‚Äî the <strong>same documentation</strong> Wise previously rejected for address verification, claiming a <em>telecommunications tax invoice isn‚Äôt a bill</em>.</p>



<blockquote>
<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="397" height="373" src="https://shaun.nz/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-9.png" alt="" srcset="https://shaun.nz/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-9.png 397w, https://shaun.nz/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-9-300x282.png 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 397px) 100vw, 397px"></figure>
</blockquote>



<p>After a few days, the transfer was then cancelled as of course, Wise was unable to ‚Äúverify‚Äù us.</p>



<blockquote>
<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="389" height="144" src="https://shaun.nz/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-10.png" alt="" srcset="https://shaun.nz/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-10.png 389w, https://shaun.nz/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-10-300x111.png 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 389px) 100vw, 389px"></figure>
</blockquote>



<p>So now our <strong>funds are in limbo</strong>, their support ticket is marked ‚Äúfinal response,‚Äù and our attempts to get clarity have gone nowhere. We‚Äôve escalated the issue to <strong>Financial Services Complaints Ltd</strong>, Wise‚Äôs dispute resolution provider in New Zealand.</p>



<p>üéØ <strong>TL;DR:</strong> Nothing resolved.</p>



<p>Funds stuck. No clear reason. No accountability. Wise still gets a 0/10 from us.</p>



<p>This isn‚Äôt just poor service ‚Äî it‚Äôs unacceptable.</p>



<p><strong>Think twice before trusting Wise with your money.</strong></p>

<p dir="auto">MinecraftHDL was the final undergraduate design project made by three students in the Electrical, Computer &amp; Software Engineering department at McGill University.</p>
<p dir="auto">It is by no means bug-free or even complete; It produces objectively inferior circuits to 'hand-made' redstone designs, and is not intended to be used in modded survival. It can generate almost any verilog circuit, however only simple designs will actually be testable in-game since any moderately-complex design will end up being longer than the maximum number of blocks loaded in Minecraft.</p>
<p dir="auto">Additionally, we are currently unable to synthesize sequential circuits, aka any circuits with a loopback or feedback. That means no memory, no counters or any circuit that could hold a state.</p>
<p dir="auto">MinecraftHDL is an educational tool to illustrate on a macro-scopic scale how microelectronic digital circuits are designed and produced. It is a great way to introduce younger audiences to the world of digital design and can also be used to illustrate the difference between software and hardware design to undergraduate engineers taking their first RTL class.</p>

</p>
<p dir="auto">The circuit I generate above is a 2bit adder. It takes two numbers of two bits and adds them. At the end of the gif I set both input numbers to '11' which is the binary representation of the number 3. Then I move to the output and we see that O3=1, O2=1, and O1=0, this gives the binary number '110' which is indeed 6.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
     <p>Recently I had a long call with an old friend who was facing an age-old
predicament that I‚Äôve been seeing more and more these days:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Lucked out, worked hard, employer is crushing it, and now she‚Äôs sitting on a
large amount of paper money gains at her startup</li>
  <li>Company does a
<a href="https://www.joinprospect.com/learn/tender-offers">tender offer</a>, either
buying their stock back or allowing a third party to come in and buy shares</li>
  <li>Employees might be allowed to sell, say, 10% (or whatever) of their equity</li>
  <li>So here‚Äôs the question: do you sell, or do you roll the dice and risk it
longer?</li>
</ul>

<p>I took a tender offer on my early GitHub shares, and it comes up <em>a lot</em> in
emails and conversations with others I run across in the startup world. It‚Äôs a
decision can be annoyingly agonizing. And there‚Äôs a lot of conflicting advice
out there, each with different motivations behind it. I‚Äôve added to that, too,
with lots of advice over the years of ‚Äúlook at all the alternatives in front of
you and make an even-headed decision‚Äù.</p>

<p>Anyway, fuck it, here‚Äôs the bottom line: <strong>take that money, queen</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="gambling-with-your-life">Gambling with your life</h2>

<p>I‚Äôve found it helpful to look at your life as a gamble: a set of probabilities
that add up to whether or not you should make a decision a certain way. Assuming
you‚Äôre in this situation, you might be looking at a windfall of, say, half a
million to tens of millions of dollars. That‚Äôs wildly lucky, and can be
life-changing money.</p>

<p>Two massive motivators in this decision:</p>

<ul>
  <li>It‚Äôs way easier to make more money when you already have money.</li>
  <li>Successful startups are an insane mix of timing and luck ‚Äî no matter what
people who sell online courses will tell you ‚Äî and if you‚Äôre at a point where
your imaginary gains are truly life-altering‚Ä¶ you‚Äôve already won. Now: try not
to lose.</li>
</ul>

<p>I‚Äôm here to tell you: don‚Äôt fuck it up. It‚Äôs easy to assume two things, because
we‚Äôre <em>Startup People</em> who are <em>Bold</em> and certainly will <em>Change The World</em> (by
increasing query performance by 6%):</p>

<ul>
  <li>we assume that this will be just the first of many correct startup decisions
we will make and every four years we‚Äôll be faced with this decision</li>
  <li>that the startup we‚Äôre at will only go up and to the right because that‚Äôs all
it‚Äôs ever done and surely it won‚Äôt face hard times both internally or
externally</li>
</ul>

<p>Successful startups sometimes fuck up. I interviewed at Zenefits about a month
before the first bad press came at them- back then it was one of the
fastest-growing companies of all time. One of the execs interviewed me and
guaranteed I‚Äôd become stupid rich if I joined. It was obvious to them they were
all going to be gazillionaires in no time at all. I came away with dozens of
utterly insane stories I continue to tell over drinks, and frankly was horrified
at how much of a clusterfuck everything internally was. But you talk to them and
they were all convinced they could do no wrong. (Except for head of
infrastructure- he was the most interesting person I interviewed with and we had
a fantastic discussion about how fucked up the infrastructure was. Figures that
the earliest to know something are the ones who see it break the most.)</p>

<p>All of this to say: it‚Äôs easy to become delusional while at a startup ‚Äî in fact,
you could argue that the best startups have that cult-like delusion built into
their DNA. But things can change. Or the external structures can change. I don‚Äôt
have to tell you that tech is in a bubble right now; everyone knows it, everyone
knows it‚Äôs going to pop, but no one knows when or the extent of it. There have
been hundreds or thousands of startups over the decades, staffed with the best
and brightest, with revenue, with customers‚Ä¶ and they‚Äôve still bitten the
bullet. That‚Äôs the game. So don‚Äôt look a gift horse in the mouth; take the
horse‚Äôs wallet instead. (Sometimes my metaphors don‚Äôt always land.)</p>

<h2 id="its-a-forcing-function">It‚Äôs a forcing function</h2>

<p>You reading all this and thinking it doesn‚Äôt apply to you? That your startup is
<span><em>c r u s h i n g</em></span> it and that by
selling, you‚Äôre leaving <em>so much money</em> on the table? Good. One of the reasons I
wrote this in this way is to act like a forcing function: get you to be
horrified at the thought and make you critically analyze if holding on to your
stock makes sense or not. It‚Äôs like the advice of flipping a coin to make a
decision, and as the coin is in the air you‚Äôll learn which decision it is that
you‚Äôre hoping it will land on.</p>

<p>I will say this, though: I did take a tender offer after I left GitHub, it was a
wildly stressful decision, but I have zero regrets today. I took something like
10% off the table, which had a positive impact on my abysmal emotional health at
the time, and had GitHub ultimately eaten it, I would have had at least
something left to show for all the work I had put into the company.</p>

<p>Amusingly enough, this post itself stemmed from conversations with
<a href="https://x.com/gallagherbilly">Billy Gallagher</a>, the founder of
<a href="https://www.joinprospect.com/">Prospect</a>, one of my angel investments. They do
scenarios and projections of early equity stakes, and I basically told him that
I‚Äôm too horrified of doing the retroactive math behind taking the tender and
dealing with all the stock fuckups GitHub subjected us to. It‚Äôs probably a large
number. But I don‚Äôt think about it at all today. Would have been helpful at the
time, sure, but the stress is a product of the time, and likely not one that
will stick with you forever‚Ä¶ if that helps you make these decisions.</p>

<p>I also found it helpful to realize something logistical, too: the money you take
today is, you know, still money. You can invest it, diversify it, grow it. The
exponential growth of startup equity makes the more linear ‚Äî but still
compounding ‚Äî growth of ‚Äúnormal‚Äù investing feel like you‚Äôre just losing out, but
you‚Äôre still compounding that cash. It doesn‚Äôt just disappear.</p>

<h2 id="you-can-afford-to-not-be-perfect">You can afford to not be perfect</h2>

<p>So yeah- all of this is good to think about. Run the numbers. Model different
scenarios. Get a real understanding of the trade-offs here.</p>

<p>Sometimes it‚Äôs helpful to ‚Äúget permission‚Äù from someone ‚Äî anyone ‚Äî though. Like,
that it‚Äôs acceptable to make this tradeoff. When GitHub got acquired, one of the
best pieces of advice I got was: <em>you can afford to not be perfect</em>. There‚Äôs
this weird pressure out there that every single financial decision needs to be
optimized for every little bit of performance‚Ä¶ but sometimes you can miss the
forest for the trees with that. You can also drive yourself mad, and forget why
you‚Äôre doing all this in the first place.</p>

<p>I‚Äôd also be remiss to not mention that this isn‚Äôt entirely a ‚Äúrich person
problem‚Äù. I‚Äôve known many paper millionaires who were functionally broke: they
had school debt, or were putting their partner through school, or had kids with
costly needs, or they were responsible for multiple families or generations who
were relying upon them. Liquidity in startups is increasingly harder to come by
these days. Life is constantly about planning for <em>the future</em>, whenever that
thing might come. Sometimes it‚Äôs helpful to think about <em>today</em>, too.</p>
