<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Mankind versus a hostile AI! From The Terminator to The Matrix to Ex Machina and beyond, so many movies and TV shows have explored the idea of artificial intelligence attempting to take over the world. Some of these films may be getting on in years, but the best sci-fi never feels dated. For Alien, 2001: A Space Odyssey, and many others, the ideas and concepts at the heart of the truly great films are timeless. It's not the sci-fi trappings like the blinking lights and special effects that make them movies we want to revisit time and again.</p><p>One of the earliest entries of the AI genre came in 1970 – way before audiences had any real sense of where the digital revolution was about to take the world – with the overlooked classic Colossus: The Forbin Project. It remains, 53 years after it was released, one of the most gripping and prophetic films to ask the question: What happens when we create something that is smarter than us?</p><p>The film’s title refers to Colossus, a super-computer that is basically Skynet 14 years before The Terminator even came out. <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/why-the-young-and-the-restless-star-eric-braeden-almost-turned-down-an-iconic-movie-role.html/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>James Cameron is apparently a fan</u></a> of Colossus: The Forbin Project, and it doesn’t seem like a stretch to say that he and Gale Anne Hurd were at least partially inspired by the 1970 picture when they wrote their franchise-starter.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2023/10/06/forbin-1-1696631105804.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" alt="The end of humanity's dominance is only a matter of time for Dr. Charles Forbin (Eric Braeden)." src="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2023/10/06/forbin-1-1696631105804.jpg?width=1280&amp;fit=bounds&amp;height=720&amp;quality=20&amp;dpr=0.05"></a><figcaption>The end of humanity's dominance is only a matter of time for Dr. Charles Forbin (Eric Braeden).</figcaption></figure></output><p>After kicking things off with the Universal Pictures logo – a rotating Earth that’s about to be overcome by a new world order – Colossus immediately if subtly predicts its premise with a pair of shots that quickly flash by. To the sound of trippy electronic sound effects and a vibrating score, we see the beeping light of what is <em>maybe </em>an EKG machine, followed by an out-of-focus eyeball… but wait a second. Is that actually some kind of computer read-out that’s beeping? And maybe that’s not an eyeball at all, but a camera lens staring at us through hazy focus?</p><p>In 1970, you couldn’t pause the tape… uh, DVD… uh, stream to be sure, though a little later we see that the EKG thingy is in fact a monitor device built into Colossus. But the blurring of the line between computer and human being is clear. And while that’s an idea that had so effectively been conveyed just two years earlier with 2001: A Space Odyssey’s HAL 9000, Colossus: The Forbin Project took that evolution one step further as its computer eventually approaches something closer to… godhood.</p><p>Also shooting for godhood, perhaps, is Dr. Charles Forbin (Eric Braeden), the brilliant if short-sighted mind behind Colossus, which the U.S. President (Gordon Pinsent) sees as the ultimate in Cold War technology. A super-computer designed to control the country’s nuclear arsenal, Colossus – just like in that song about, well, God – will soon have the whole world in its hands.</p><p>We first meet Forbin as he tours the top-secret facility where Colossus’ brain is housed, switching on gizmos that are meant to portray the most sophisticated computer imaginable in the 1970s, but which look mainly like flashing blinkies and colorful buttons. There’s not a touchscreen in sight! Of course, when this film was made, the very notion of how we would interact with computers in the 21st century was inconceivable for most people. The GUI (graphical user interface) that is commonplace now – essentially, interacting with machines through graphics instead of text – wouldn’t really be invented for another three years. The microchip had only been created 12 years earlier! So the filmmakers here had to figure out how we would communicate with a computer like Colossus.</p><p>The answer? Through a LED-light news ticker and a teletype.</p><p>Considering how often Hollywood has botched its depictions of computers – often endowing them with abilities that don’t make sense, like when a character only has to do some fast typing on a keyboard to magically move plot or action forward – it’s fairly remarkable how convincing Colossus is as a machine. Convincing and scary. This is what makes good sci-fi – striking imagery or hyper-accurate depictions of future tech are secondary to high stakes and captivating storytelling.</p><p>Take the scene where Colossus’ communication line to its Soviet counterpart – another newborn super-brain called Guardian – is severed by the humans. A world map in the White House situation room shows Colossus trying to find a new path to its sibling. It almost feels desperate – sad – as the computer fruitlessly reaches out for its friend, as depicted visually on the map as various telecom pathways. But then Colossus drops a message on its news ticker: “IF LINK NOT RESTORED ACTION WILL BE TAKEN IMMEDIATELY.”</p><p>Actually, that’s not a message. It’s a threat. Up until now, the illusion of human control has kept Forbin and the rest on their perch. But when the President gets on the line – the user has to dictate what they want to say to Colossus to an underling, who types it into a device that’s even bigger than the typewriter I took to college with me – he makes things worse, and the computer announces that it’s launching a nuclear missile directed at the Soviet Union. Guardian does the same, aimed at the US.</p><p>What follows is a flurry of teletype sounds – type-type-type-type – and beeps and increasingly nervous voices as Forbin tries to negotiate with his creation. The Michel Colombier score intensifies as suddenly we’re on a countdown clock. Multiple video conference screens feature the scrambling Soviets while the camera trains on the world map, where simple yellow-white lines indicate the two missiles passing one another on their way to their final destinations.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Colossus is a tight 100 minutes of increasingly ratcheted-up tension as the cocky Forbin and the clueless President watch their control of the world disappear utterly and completely.</p></div><p>It’s an incredibly gripping sequence, culminating in Forbin giving the computer what it wants. Four tense-as-hell minutes after the first missile launch, the sequence ends with one aborted attack, one destroyed Soviet town, and Colossus one step closer to full dominance over man.</p><p>That’s the type of action the film provides – it’s basically just a bunch of guys in a room talking to a news ticker. It’s simple and there’s no need for high-tech frills. But man, is it unforgettable. Still, it’s no surprise that most of the movie posters for Colossus: The Forbin Project focus on a minor character who is gunned down midway through the film, since that death takes place during one of the few more traditional “action” scenes.</p><p>Directed by Joseph Sargent, a TV helmer who was transitioning to a full-time feature career and would soon turn out the classic NYC subway thriller The Taking of Pelham One Two Three, Colossus is a tight 100 minutes of increasingly ratcheted-up tension as the cocky Forbin and the clueless President watch their control of the world, slowly at first, but eventually in runaway-train-like fashion, disappear utterly and completely.</p><p>Early in the film, the charming Forbin gives a Steve Jobs-like presentation about how impressive his new tech is (the only thing missing is the black turtleneck). Speaking of Jobs, it’s interesting that the not-too-distant future depicted here doesn’t seem to have any room for Big Tech. Colossus is apparently a government-funded project, and Forbin has to bend to the will of the President at times – even more so in the book on which the movie is based. That said, the film predicts some of the workplace and lifestyle developments that have since become commonplace for us. Zoom calls are basically a thing, as is a work-from-home ethos – at least for Forbin and his team, who all live on a sort of campus where work and play are intermixed. Eventually, Forbin is forced to live under the constant gaze of an ever-watchful Colossus, which perhaps isn’t all that different for some of us who are forever tied to our tech, social media and otherwise.</p><div><p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2023/10/06/forbin-3a-1696632645112.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" alt="Eventually, Forbin cannot escape the watchful eye of Colossus, not even in his home." src="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2023/10/06/forbin-3a-1696632645112.gif?width=1280&amp;fit=bounds&amp;height=720&amp;quality=20&amp;dpr=0.05"></a><figcaption>Eventually, Forbin cannot escape the watchful eye of Colossus, not even in his home.</figcaption></figure></output></p></div><p>During that earlier presentation at the White House, Forbin – standing in front of a portrait of Washington no less as he unwittingly signs away mankind’s freedom – had asked rhetorically, “Is Colossus capable of creative thought?” His answer at the time is no. So when, shortly thereafter, Colossus outgrows his creator in a matter of days, it’s got to be a tough pill to swallow. (In a great sequence, Colossus and Guardian begin to communicate via basic math – 2+2=4 and so on – but before too long, they’ve advanced to theoretical mathematics and are breaking new ground on topics that the human scientific community hasn’t even been close to touching.)</p><p>But that’s the real trick, isn’t it? From Frankenstein to HAL to Scarlett Johansson’s Samantha in Her, the genre has a long history of man creating something that, once created, can no longer be controlled. Forbin, in his quest for more knowledge and scientific dominance, made a mind greater than his own. Indeed, early on, when he attempts to punish Colossus like a bratty child and seems to briefly win back control of the computer, his assistant asks if he’s disappointed. Forbin only chuckles in response, but it’s right there: Deep down, there’s a part of the scientist who wants his creation to be “more.” And if that means letting a super-computer run the planet Earth… Eh, whaddaya gonna do?</p><p>It’s the genie out of the bottle syndrome, and while the current AI situation that we are facing in 2023 may be far less dramatic than Dr. Forbin’s nightmare scenario – no AI in the real world has blown up a city yet as far as I know – the bottom line is that much of the reasoning and arguments made in favor of the development of AI are the same as the promises Forbin and the President make: “[It will be used as] an aide to the solution of the many problems that we face on this Earth...”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>The 25 Best Sci-Fi Movies</h3></div></output><p>By the end of Colossus: The Forbin Project, the solution to those many problems means that Colossus/Guardian have inherited the Earth, and Forbin is a prisoner in his own life, working as a slave to his creation. Mankind may be better off because of Colossus, but it’s no longer calling the shots. The final moments of the film are perfect, early-’70s bleak sci-fi: Forbin finally breaks down in rage and frustration as the now seemingly all-knowing, all-seeing Colossus reads out its benevolent plans for humankind’s future. That includes a promise that, in time, Forbin will come to regard the machine with love. That Forbin’s last words, as the computer – and we – watch him simultaneously from every angle, are “Never!” means nothing to the AI. See, Colossus has evolved past mere man, and it knows better now.</p><p>It’s got the whole world in its hands.</p><p><em>Talk to Executive Editor Scott Collura on Twitter at </em><a href="https://twitter.com/ScottCollura" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>@ScottCollura</strong></em></a><em>, or listen to his </em><a href="https://www.spreaker.com/show/transporter-room-3-the-star-trek-podcast" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>Star Trek podcast, Transporter Room 3</strong></em></a><em>.

            <p>One promising approach to treating Type 1 diabetes is implanting pancreatic islet cells that can produce insulin when needed, which can free patients from giving themselves frequent insulin injections. However, one major obstacle to this approach is that once the cells are implanted, they eventually run out of oxygen and stop producing insulin.</p>

<p>To overcome that hurdle, MIT engineers have designed a new implantable device that not only carries hundreds of thousands of insulin-producing islet cells, but also has its own on-board oxygen factory, which generates oxygen by splitting water vapor found in the body.</p>

<p>The researchers showed that when implanted into diabetic mice, this device could keep the mice’s blood glucose levels stable for at least a month. The researchers now hope to create a larger version of the device, about the size of a stick of chewing gum, that could eventually be tested in people with Type 1 diabetes.</p>

<p>“You can think of this as a living medical device that is made from human cells that secrete insulin, along with an electronic life support-system. We’re excited by the progress so far, and we really are optimistic that this technology could end up helping patients,” says Daniel Anderson, a professor in MIT’s Department of Chemical Engineering, a member of MIT’s Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research and Institute for Medical Engineering and Science (IMES), and the senior author of the study.</p>

<p>While the researchers’ main focus is on diabetes treatment, they say that this kind of device could also be adapted to treat other diseases that require repeated delivery of therapeutic proteins.</p>

<p>MIT Research Scientist Siddharth Krishnan is the lead author of the <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2311707120" target="_blank">paper</a>, which appears today in the <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</em>. The research team also includes several other researchers from MIT, including Robert Langer, the David H. Koch Institute Professor at MIT and a member of the Koch Institute, as well as researchers from Boston Children’s Hospital.</p>

<p><strong>Replacing injections</strong></p>

<p>Most patients with Type 1 diabetes have to monitor their blood glucose levels carefully and inject themselves with insulin at least once a day. However, this process doesn’t replicate the body’s natural ability to control blood glucose levels.</p>

<p>“The vast majority of diabetics that are insulin-dependent are injecting themselves with insulin, and doing their very best, but they do not have healthy blood sugar levels,” Anderson says. “If you look at their blood sugar levels, even for people that are very dedicated to being careful, they just can’t match what a living pancreas can do.”</p>

<p>A better alternative would be to transplant cells that produce insulin whenever they detect surges in the patient’s blood glucose levels. Some diabetes patients have received transplanted islet cells from human cadavers, which can achieve long-term control of diabetes; however, these patients have to take immunosuppressive drugs to prevent their body from rejecting the implanted cells.</p>

<p>More recently, researchers have shown similar success with islet cells derived from stem cells, but patients who receive those cells also need to take immunosuppressive drugs.</p>

<p>Another possibility, which could prevent the need for immunosuppressive drugs, is to encapsulate the transplanted cells within a flexible device that protects the cells from the immune system. However, finding a reliable oxygen supply for these encapsulated cells has proven challenging.</p>

<p>Some experimental devices, including one that has been tested in clinical trials, feature an oxygen chamber that can supply the cells, but this chamber needs to be reloaded periodically. Other researchers have developed implants that include chemical reagents that can generate oxygen, but these also run out eventually.</p>

<p>The MIT team took a different approach that could potentially generate oxygen indefinitely, by splitting water. This is done using a proton-exchange membrane — a technology originally deployed to generate hydrogen in fuel cells — located within the device. This membrane can split water vapor (found abundantly in the body) into hydrogen, which diffuses harmlessly away, and oxygen, which goes into a storage chamber that feeds the islet cells through a thin, oxygen-permeable membrane.</p>

<p>A significant advantage of this approach is that it does not require any wires or batteries. Splitting this water vapor requires a small voltage (about 2 volts), which is generated using a phenomenon known as resonant inductive coupling. A tuned magnetic coil located outside the body transmits power to a small, flexible antenna within the device, allowing for wireless power transfer. It does require an external coil, which the researchers anticipate could be worn as a patch on the patient’s skin.</p>

<p><strong>Drugs on demand</strong></p>

<p>After building their device, which is about the size of a U.S. quarter, the researchers tested it in diabetic mice. One group of mice received the device with the oxygen-generating, water-splitting membrane, while the other received a device that contained islet cells without any supplemental oxygen. The devices were implanted just under the skin, in mice with fully functional immune systems.</p>

<p>The researchers found that mice implanted with the oxygen-generating device were able to maintain normal blood glucose levels, comparable to healthy animals. However, mice that received the nonoxygenated device became hyperglycemic (with elevated blood sugar) within about two weeks.</p>

<p>Typically when any kind of medical device is implanted in the body, attack by the immune system leads to a buildup of scar tissue called fibrosis, which can reduce the devices’ effectiveness. This kind of scar tissue did form around the implants used in this study, but the device’s success in controlling blood glucose levels suggests that insulin was still able to diffuse out of the device, and glucose into it.</p>

<p>This approach could also be used to deliver cells that produce other types of therapeutic proteins that need to be given over long periods of time. In this study, the researchers showed that the device could also keep alive cells that produce erythropoietin, a protein that stimulates red blood cell production.</p>

<p>“We’re optimistic that it will be possible to make living medical devices that can reside in the body and produce drugs as needed,” Anderson says. “There are a variety of diseases where patients need to take proteins exogenously, sometimes very frequently. If we can replace the need for infusions every other week with a single implant that can act for a long time, I think that could really help a lot of patients.”</p>

<p>The researchers now plan to adapt the device for testing in larger animals and eventually humans. For human use, they hope to develop an implant that would be about the size of a stick of chewing gum. They also plan to test whether the device can remain in the body for longer periods of time.</p>

<p>“The materials we’ve used are inherently stable and long-lived, so I think that kind of long-term operation is within the realm of possibility, and that’s what we’re working on,” Krishnan says.</p>

<p>“We are very excited about these findings, which we believe could provide a whole new way of someday treating diabetes and possibly other diseases,” Langer adds.</p>

<p>The research was funded by JDRF, the Leona M. and Harry B. Helmsley Charitable Trust, and the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering at the National Institutes of Health.</p>

        <div itemprop="articleBody">
            <p>Last week, I had a fascinating conversation with a reader around frustration and unhappiness at work. Much of it was totally obvious to both of us, but it occurred to me that this probably <em>isn't</em> to everyone, which is why almost all of my colleagues (in very cushy, non-stressful jobs) nonetheless need therapy. And if it isn't obvious to everyone, it's worth writing about.</p>
<p>I now believe that this stems from a failure to recognize the gap, frequently vast, between what is being <em>said</em> by a person and what is being felt, and how this discrepancy applies to organizations too.</p>
<p>It was sparked by reference to a concept called the <em>honne-tatemae</em> divide, which are Japanese concepts related to the true feelings of an individual and the front they present in public. I don't actually know anything about the Japanese context beyond this one Wikipedia article, so this has been dropped entirely so that I seem worldly and to give us vocabulary less onerous than "what you really think" and "what you're forced to say".</p>
<h2 id="i-tatemae">I. Tatemae</h2>
<p>I have never met a single manager at any large company that has not said they want to be <em>data driven</em>. I have also never seen a single one of them take any steps that could actually move them in this direction.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the average annual salary for a Power BI developer places them in the 90th percentile of my country's annual income. For those of you unfamiliar with Power BI, you connect it to data sources and then it makes visualizations for managers to gawk at, and it is so simple to use that it is not inconceivable to me that you could <em>actually</em> train a monkey to make a bar chart with the correct application of positive reinforcement and peanuts.</p>
<p>There are a handful of people who do amazing things in Power BI, but the hard truth is that most people who work in it are <em>really</em> just dragging-and-dropping bar charts onto a page after connecting it to a spreadsheet, being paid absolutely exorbitantly, and then if they're smart, going home and despairing. This is because Power BI tracks usage metrics and almost all dashboards are completely unused.</p>
<p>My current organization has 8000 staff members, and I used to glance over the usage metrics of the dashboards my old team produced. I believe three dashboards were used, out of somewhere around 50 - 100. Of those being visited, it usually turned out they were being visited by members of our team checking to see if the data had refreshed for the day. I'd estimate the cost of maintaining our team was approximately $1,000,000, for an organization that supposedly can't afford to waste that money.</p>
<p><em>Why?</em></p>
<p>Management has no choice but to say that they want to be data driven. It's not like they can just come out and <em>say</em> that it's all fucked - so they say the only thing that is available. We are going through a "digital transformation", and that is why all of these efforts don't generate any revenue and drive staff to misery. It will be better once this current initiative successfully completes, even though we have never demonstrated the ability to successfully complete a similar initiative at any point in the past.</p>
<h2 id="ii-honne">II. Honne</h2>
<p>There are two pressures that drive the garbled stream of corporate of nonsense at organizations.</p>
<h2 id="i-sturgeons-law">I. Sturgeon's Law</h2>
<p>The first one is <em>very</em> simple, and I sometimes lose sight of it while I'm deep in the theory mines of incentives and other smarter takes. 90% of everything is crud, and that explains almost everything. Most managers have never had an independent thought on how to manage people effectively (hence the Agile parroting), most programmers don't know what an abstraction is, etc, etc. This is the <em>overwhelming</em> factor even though it isn't a satisfying answer, but it has done more for my own peace of mind than anything that follows.</p>
<p>I used to be pretty good on the fencing circuit - as in, olympic fencing, with the swords. It never occurred to me <em>for even a goddamn second</em> that we could win competitions without having good, smart people that understood the sport and trained hard. If we lose because Derek didn't turn up to practice for six months, I might be pissed off and upset, but I am not <em>spiritually confused</em> about why my efforts aren't rewarding me.</p>
<p>I have no idea what possesses us to turn up at work and think that we can accomplish anything with fucking Derek over there calling the shots while slamming their empty head onto a keyboard as rapidly as Jira will allow him to create cards we won't finish, but for some reason it's a thing that happens.</p>
<p>Derek will repeat whatever brain-dead thing is in vogue but they are <em>very stupid</em> and will repeat literally anything that sounds popular, plus will never question that they have never had an unambiguous success over their entire career. This means they will inevitably become promoted over time, because unlike the rest of us who have to put in <em>effort</em> and pay what a friend of mine terms <em>soul cost</em> to act like a sycophant, they believe it sincerely.</p>
<h2 id="ii-sturgeons-law-again">II. Sturgeon's Law Again</h2>
<p>Here's the pressure if you're in the 10% of people that aren't crud at their jobs - you're surrounded by people that <em>are</em> crud.</p>
<p>Don't get me wrong - I <em>am</em> that terrible person at many things. There are fencing teams where I'd be absolute dead weight. My piano playing leaves much to be desired. Last week, I managed to stub the little toe on both feet, on the same day, on two separate occasions, and I have on at least one occasion absentmindedly dropped a teaspoon into the trash instead of a tea bag.</p>
<p>However I don't do any of that professionally. In professional settings, approximately <em>all</em> of my time goes into solving problems introduced by people that are just indescribably bad.</p>
<p>I work on a platform that cost my organization an eye-watering sum of money to produce, over the span of two years, and the engineers responsible for it elected to use spreadsheets to control the infrastructure, so we now have a spreadsheet with 400 separate worksheets that powers but one part of this whole shambling mess.</p>
<p>Can you imagine the kind of havoc such people could wreak upon infrastructure and code if left unchecked?</p>
<p>Is there <em>any</em> chance a team with people like that is going to produce good results? Obviously not. Do most teams at large organizations have at least one person like that? Sweet merciful Christ, in both my first, second, and perhaps even third-hand experience, whatever that means, it's possible that <em>half of all teams consist entirely of that person</em>.</p>
<p>Can my manager keep their job if they honestly say "There is no chance this team will ever hit its objectives"? <em>Fuck</em> no, if they did that they'd be <em>gone</em>, so the system is constantly selecting for people that are either too dumb to realize it's hopeless, too perversely incentivized to be honest, or too deep into despair to <em>admit to themselves</em> it is hopeless.</p>
<h2 id="iii-ignoring-is-bliss">III. Ignoring Is Bliss</h2>
<p>From the Tao of Programming:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A novice asked the Master: "In the East, there is a great tree-structure that men call 'Corporate Headquarters'. It is bloated out of shape with vice presidents and accountants. It issues a multitude of memos, each saying 'Go Hence!' or 'Go Hither!' and nobody knows what is meant. Every year new names are put onto the branches, but all to no avail. How can such an unnatural entity exist?"</p>
<p>The Master replied: "You perceive this immense structure and are disturbed that it has no rational purpose. Can you not take amusement from its endless gyrations? Do you not enjoy the untroubled ease of programming beneath its sheltering branches? Why are you bothered by its uselessness?"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I quote the above because it is very funny, and because the only thing that has brought me clarity is totally ignoring anything management says unless I have a very good reason to believe the person I am speaking to has intelligence, integrity, <em>and</em> has come to terms with the fact that large organizations are inherently dysfunctional, which happens rarely.</p>
<p>I have a friend that was denied a raise after working at a company diligently for five years - there was no budget, he was told. He was upset, and ended up spending a year traveling the world on sabbatical.</p>
<p>While he was away, a new position opened up in the same department, for the same job title - it was a permanent role, theoretically exactly the same job he was doing in an identical team with the same managers. They gave me that job, all the money he asked for, plus another hefty sum on top of it.</p>
<p>Management saying there was no budget <em>meant nothing</em> - it is purely a thing they are forced to say, and if the person saying it was not particularly insightful, they even believed it. The <em>only</em> thing an organization can do that means <em>anything</em> is actually solving your problem, and <em>any</em> words to the effect of "we'll address your concerns soon" or "we just need to do some planning around this", etc, should just be ignored wholesale.</p>
<p>These days, I ignore everything they've said about salary (I just state a number and don't budge, and they usually just give me what I want despite saying it was impossible), I ignore everything they say around work culture and the teams they want to build (I don't factor it into my decisions around whether it's a team I'd like to join because I know it isn't trustworthy), and frankly, sometimes I just ignore them because fuck 'em, why not?</p>
<p>Similarly, I let them talk as much as they want about work culture or whatever. These are the endless gyrations of the great tree structure, rustling in the wind. Actually <em>remove</em> the staff that no one works to work with or who terrorize their subordinates and I'll know you're serious about performance. Reward people for staying, and I'll know you're serious about valuing people. Anything short of that is less than worthless, because you've wasted valuable time I could have been listening to music.</p>
<p>It's much more peaceful to solve a few problems, not waste a single iota of my energy on creating systemic change unless we're going to try curing cancer, then log off to touch grass. Realizing that no mere <em>words</em> can demonstrate an appetite for true change was necessary for me to make that change in my life - hopefully it does the same for someone else.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="maincontent"><p>A long-lost Amazon documentary described as “the holy grail of Brazilian silent cinema” has been rediscovered nearly a century after it went missing.</p><p><em>Amazonas, </em><em>Maior Rio do </em><em>Mundo </em>(Amazon: Longest River in the World)was stolen from the original director, Silvino Santos, shortly after it was made in 1918. Just over a decade later, it had completely disappeared. The film resurfaced earlier this year in a Czech archive and was identified by specialists in Italy and Brazil.</p><p>“It’s basically a miracle,” said Sávio Stoco, the Brazilian expert on Santos who confirmed the discovery. “We didn’t have the slightest hope that this work would one day be found.”</p><p>A Portuguese-born cinematographer who spent most of his life in the Amazon, Santos was one of the main non-fiction film-makers of early 20th century Brazilian cinema. He is best remembered for his 1922 documentary <em>No </em><em>Paiz das Amazonas</em> (In the Country of the Amazons), which experts read as an attempted remake of his lost production.</p><p>The 1918 film is considered a rare gem of Brazilian cinematography for its length, subject matter, and quality of composition. Featuring fascinating footage of the Amazon forest’s diverse landscapes and inhabitants – including some of the earliest known moving images of the Indigenous Witoto people – the feature-length film “mixes different dimensions of the documentary genre into a very enjoyable narrative for the viewer”, explains Stoco, a professor of visual arts at the federal university of Pará in Belém.</p><figure id="06f00dee-1395-4db3-9447-a2d986d6a0d8" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement"><div id="img-2"><picture><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0301ecce6f96583530d7e90c953287dd2d690187/0_0_2232_1769/master/2232.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0301ecce6f96583530d7e90c953287dd2d690187/0_0_2232_1769/master/2232.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 660px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0301ecce6f96583530d7e90c953287dd2d690187/0_0_2232_1769/master/2232.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0301ecce6f96583530d7e90c953287dd2d690187/0_0_2232_1769/master/2232.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 480px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0301ecce6f96583530d7e90c953287dd2d690187/0_0_2232_1769/master/2232.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0301ecce6f96583530d7e90c953287dd2d690187/0_0_2232_1769/master/2232.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 320px)"><img alt="A still from Amazonas, Maior Rio do Mundo (Amazon: Longest River in the World) by the director Silvino Santos." src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0301ecce6f96583530d7e90c953287dd2d690187/0_0_2232_1769/master/2232.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" width="445" height="352.69041218637994" loading="lazy"></picture></div><figcaption><span><svg width="18" height="13" viewBox="0 0 18 13"><path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"></path></svg></span><span>The 1918 film is considered a gem of Brazilian cinematography for its length, subject matter, and quality of composition.</span> Photograph: Národní filmový archiv, Prague</figcaption></figure><p>Santos takes his audience on a remarkably detailed journey through the Amazon, alternating close-up shots of caimans, jaguars and tropical flora with footage of Indigenous rituals and longer sequences showcasing the region’s extractive industries: rubber, the Brazil nut, timber, fishing, even the egret feathers that were a staple of women’s fashion at the time.</p><p>The lost documentary gained mythical status in Brazil with the story of its disappearance, which was recorded by Santos in an unpublished memoir written shortly before his death in 1969.</p><p>Shot over three years in the Peruvian and Brazilian Amazon, the film vanished before it could be screened in Brazil and bankrupted its Manaus-based production company. The negative was stolen by an associate of Santos, Propércio de Mello Saraiva, who was negotiating the documentary’s international sale.</p><p>Instead Saraiva pocketed the print, claimed he was the director, and fraudulently signed a deal with Gaumont to distribute the film in England, where it was retitled <em>Wonders of the Amazon. </em>The documentary circulated to great acclaim in Europe for a few years, but by 1931 all traces of it had vanished.</p><p>“It is still in the orbit of the planets,” Santos wrote in his memoir.</p><p>However, a negative copy of an older, now disintegrated nitrate print of the film survived at the Národní filmový archiv, in Prague, where it had been miscatalogued as a US production from around 1925. Doubting its labelling, a curator sent a copy earlier this year to Jay Weissberg, a specialist in silent cinema.</p><figure id="084a2ad6-9b19-430a-b979-ae05df715435" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement"><gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props="{&quot;richLinkIndex&quot;:12,&quot;element&quot;:{&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2023/sep/29/brazils-first-ever-minister-for-indigenous-peoples-it-is-time-for-the-world-to-look-at-our-way-of-life&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Brazil’s first-ever minister for Indigenous peoples: ‘It is time for the world to look at our way of life’&quot;,&quot;prefix&quot;:&quot;Related: &quot;,&quot;role&quot;:&quot;richLink&quot;,&quot;elementId&quot;:&quot;084a2ad6-9b19-430a-b979-ae05df715435&quot;},&quot;ajaxUrl&quot;:&quot;https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk&quot;,&quot;format&quot;:{&quot;display&quot;:0,&quot;theme&quot;:0,&quot;design&quot;:0}}" config="{&quot;renderingTarget&quot;:&quot;Web&quot;}"></gu-island></figure><p>“Within seconds, I knew it was not 1925, it was much earlier, and it certainly had nothing to do with anything anyone in the US might have made,” says Weissberg, who is director of Italy’s Pordenone silent film festival where the documentary will be screened this week.</p><p>Stoco then confirmed Weissberg’s hunch that the Amazon footage was “the holy grail of Brazilian [silent] documentaries”.</p><p>Further showings are planned later this year in the Czech Republic and Brazil, although screening the documentary today raises questions about Santos’s colonialist gaze.</p><p>“It is of course a film marked by the perspective of the time and by its financiers, who were members of Manaus’s commercial elite,” says Stoco.</p><p>As well as its unabashed focus on publicising the forest’s economic potential, the film exoticises Indigenous peoples without acknowledging the horrors they faced .</p><p>The early 20th century rubber boom enslaved and exterminated Indigenous communities, including the Witoto who were forced out of isolation in their native Colombia, with some communities fleeing to Peru and Brazil. Early in his career, Santos was funded by a notorious Peruvian rubber baron.</p><p>“[He] couldn’t talk about the atrocities that were taking place,” Stoco says, arguing that the film remains important precisely for its perspective of the Amazon as “a region to be exploited” – a view that continues to drive the devastation of the rainforest and its native populations today.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<p dir="auto">This project covers two intertwined use cases:</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>Continuous and regular dumps of one or all <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/" rel="nofollow">PostgreSQL</a> databases at a given
host in a format that permits recovery in case of disasters.  This is
<code>backup.sh</code>.</li>
<li>Continuous and regular copying of these dumps in a compressed form to a
(supposedly) remote directory in order to facilitate offsite backup and
recovery in case of disasters. This is <code>offsite.sh</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p dir="auto">The project is tuned for usage within a Dockerised environment and each tool
described below performs only one backup or compression.  Typical scenarios will
periodically restart containers based on this image using a host-wide cron-like
daemon such as <a href="https://github.com/efrecon/dockron">dockron</a>.</p>

<p dir="auto">An example <a href="https://docs.docker.com/compose/" rel="nofollow">compose</a> file is provided as a plausible real-life scenario.  The
file <code>docker-compose.yml</code> starts up the following containers:</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li><code>db</code>, an instance of the PostgreSQL database.</li>
<li><code>pgbackup</code>, which runs <code>backup.sh</code> once and will perform a backup of all
databases when it starts.</li>
<li><code>davbackup</code>, which runs <code>offsite.sh</code> once and will copy the latest backup to
another volume in compressed form. This could be a WebDAV mounted volume,
even though it isn't since this is just an example.</li>
<li><code>pulse</code>, runs an instance of <code>efrecon/dockron</code> and will restart the two
previous containers from time to time so they can regularly perform their
operations.</li>

</article><h2>A
religious offering?</h2><p>Archaeologists
have found five gold foil figures in the last couple of weeks.</p><p>Three of
them were found where the wall of the temple once
stood. Two of them were found in separate post holes.</p><p>Finding a gold
foil figure is spectacular and rare in itself. But the five gold foil figures that
were found at Hov this time offer something extra: They were found and
excavated where they were most likely originally placed. Knowing where something
was once placed helps archaeologists understand more.</p><p>“It’s extra
special that we can link the gold foil figures to the various parts of the
building's construction,” Stene says.</p><p>The many gold
foil figures found here earlier were discovered in and around another post hole
in the old temple, on the opposite side of the two that recently appeared.</p><p> It's possible that some of the gold foil figures they found here earlier were also placed in the wall, but there's uncertainty about exactly where they were once found. Now, with these three that we found under the actual structure of the wall, it's clear that they were intentionally placed there before the wall's construction," Stene says.</p><p data-lab-font_weight="font-weight-normal">One of the
theories about what the gold foil figures were used for is that they may have
served as a form of <span data-lab-font_weight="font-weight-normal">admission ticket</span> to a temple like the one that once stood here at Hov. </p>
<p>But an admission ticket doesn’t lie under a wall.</p><p data-lab-font_weight="font-weight-normal">“Modern
excavation has provided more knowledge about this,” Stene says. “The gold foil
figures in the post hole were not visible to people. Those we found in the wall
would also not have been visible to others. So this doesn't appear to be an admission ticket, but rather an offering or a religious act to protect the building."</p><figure data-element-guid="58a219f5-cf93-409e-8b56-de3378926276">

<h2>A small,
but prominent pagan temple</h2><p>The temple at
Hov was discovered by pure chance in 1993. County conservator Harald Jacobsen drove
along the E6 and noticed the soil. He thought it looked like what
archaeologists call cultural layers, meaning soil where traces of humans are
found. A small investigation proved that he was right, and the finding of two gold
foil figures indicated that this was no ordinary place.</p>



<!-- placeholder(#1) -->


<p data-lab-font_weight="font-weight-normal">Smaller
excavations during the 2000s led to the discovery of 28 gold foil figures, and
what is referred to as a temple, a house for pagan religious practices.</p><p>One of the
reasons archaeologists believe this was a temple, besides the gold foil figures,
is the absence of other finds that would be natural if people lived there, like
cooking pots and whetstones.&nbsp;</p><p>A proper
excavation of the area had to wait until this year, in connection with the E6
Roterud-Storhove road project. Throughout the autumn and winter, C14 dating
will finally determine if it is true that the temple has stood here since
around the year 600 – and right up to the 11th century.</p><p>“Based on what we have interpreted as post holes, it's not unreasonable to think that a building has stood here that has looked the same for several hundred years. That's not a problem, as long as you maintain the building by
replacing the load-bearing posts as they rot,” Stene says. </p><p>With its
15–16 metres in length, the house is small. Residential homes of the time could
easily be 20-30 metres long.</p><p data-lab-font_weight="font-weight-normal">“Because it’s
relatively small, we believe the structure served a solely ritualistic function,” says
Stene. “It probably wasn't where they had their feasts. Those were likely held in a larger hall, but maybe they had drinking ceremonies here. Maybe it was just the select circle in society, the elite, who were allowed to enter."</p><p data-lab-font_weight="font-weight-normal">The&nbsp;archaeologists also believe the building was fairly tall.&nbsp;</p><p>“It
probably stood out in the landscape. If you came to Mjøsa by boat, it was
probably clearly visible,” Stene says. </p><figure data-element-guid="de9f3460-1756-4414-a618-5c61db98a1ed">

</article><h2>Gold foil
figures in buildings</h2><p>Ingunn
Marit Røstad, archaeologist at the Museum of Cultural History in Oslo, is an expert on the
Merovingian period in Norway and gold foil figures. She also believes there are
more gold foil figures out there.</p><p data-lab-font_weight="font-weight-normal">“Bornholm
is very special, even in Denmark. There aren't that many other find sites
there,” Røstad points out.</p><p data-lab-font_weight="font-weight-normal">There are
also other regional differences: In Denmark, there are more individual
figures, whereas in Norway and Sweden, it is mostly couples that are
depicted. </p><p>“But more of these small pieces of gold keep appearing. Either through excavation or with metal detectors. So, more
could pop up in various places in Norway as well,” she says.</p><p>Due to the continuous new finds, the number of gold foil figures must be regularly updated. The latest numbers Røstad has from 2019 indicate that a total of 3,243 gold foil figures
have been found in Scandinavia – 2,708 of them on Bornholm.</p><p>Røstad also
points out that what’s especially unique about the new gold foil figures from
Hov is that they were found in the ground, where they lay. Archaeologists call
it context – the place where something is found is part of the story.</p><p>“Of all the
thousands of gold foil figures we have, only a few have been found on-site and
excavated,” Røstad says. “So, it’s extremely valuable that we get good context
for the finds from Hov.”</p><p data-lab-font_weight="font-weight-normal">What stands
out when gold foil figures are actually excavated – as opposed to just being randomly
found in a field – is that archaeologists find them in association with
buildings.</p><figure data-element-guid="584a4b0f-0a19-41ae-b357-e844b875ddc5">

<h2>Pictures
of the elite</h2><p>Røstad does
not place much stock in the theory that the gold foil figures were admission tickets to the temple.</p><p data-lab-font_weight="font-weight-normal">They do not
have holes suggesting that they were sewn onto clothing, and apart from a few
exceptions from Bornholm, they do not have&nbsp;fastenings suggesting
they are jewellery.</p><p>They are
dated to the Merovingian period due to the style of clothing and jewellery depicted
on the men and women. </p><p data-lab-font_weight="font-weight-normal">“People assume
that they’re showing the elite’s clothing during this period,” Røstad says. “A
sort of idealised depiction of elite clothing, featuring the elaborate hairstyle
that the women have with a distinctive knot. You also see beads, special types of brooches, drinking cups, and drinking horns, which date them to the Merovingian
period.”</p><p data-lab-font_weight="font-weight-normal">A common
interpretation of the gold foil figures is that they have some sort of ritual
significance. Many believe that the couple depicted is the god Frøy and the goddess Gerd. Perhaps the gold foil figures were part of a symbolic act
when people celebrated weddings?</p><figure data-element-guid="53d29dd6-915a-47cf-b8db-a61d421a19e3">

<h2>Of divine
lineage?</h2><p>Another
interpretation deals with the idea that the most powerful families of this time
claimed they could trace their lineage back to the gods, and that the gold foil
figures in some way signaled that they were of divine lineage.</p><p data-lab-font_weight="font-weight-normal">“This was
used to legitimise ruling; you were a leading family because you were descended
from the gods,” Røstad says. “Even though they’re tiny, the gold foil figures could
have been very significant. Not as jewellery worn visibly to show status, but
perhaps they were part of some kind of ritual placement at the high seat
where the king or jarl sat.” </p><p>The first gold
foil figures were found in 1725. In a text from 1791, they were referred to as ‘gullgubber’
(golden old men), and the name just stuck. Even though the vast majority of them actually depict both a man and a woman.</p><p>———</p><p>Translated by Alette Bjordal Gjellesvik.</p><p><a href="https://forskning.no/arkeologi/gullskatt-funnet-utenfor-lillehammer-blir-ikke-stort-mer-spektakulaert-enn-dette/2252591">Read

			Have you ever wanted to test (from the command line) whether a port on another machine can be reached from yours? When some app of your can't seem to connect to a given port, you may want to test things from the command line. (The problem may be that the service using that port has stopped or is blocked by a firewall--it may be that you're mistaken in the port you are trying to use, or perhaps even the ip address, domain name, or machine name.)    </p><p>
There are in fact many tools which can help with this task, some of which will be familiar to those on *nix systems, but Windows users who've been around a while (or who learned from such folks) may try to rely on the good ol' telnet command (as in <i>telnet <machine> <port></port></machine></i>). Unfortunately, they often find out how <b>Microsoft has disabled that tool by default for over a decade</b> (since Windows Vista), and while it <a href="https://www.makeuseof.com/enable-telnet-windows/">can be easily enabled</a>, they may be prevented or understandably reluctant to do that.    </p><p>
In this post, I want to show a couple of command-line alternatives which can do the job easily, <b>one best suited for powershell users (Test-NetConnection)</b>, and and two of which would suit those who prefer the command line (cmd) and which are now built-into Windows (the past few years): <b>ssh and curl</b>. No, this is not their primary job but they will suit for this task and it may surprise some to learn they're even built-in options. I'll conclude with still other options available to those on *nix environments (who of course can also use ssh and curl), especially nc (netcat). </p><p> Topics:  </p><ul>  <li><a href="https://www.carehart.org/blog/2023/10/1/ps">Option 1) Powershell's nifty Test-NetConnection</a></li><a href="https://www.carehart.org/blog/2023/10/1/ps">  </a><li><a href="https://www.carehart.org/blog/2023/10/1/ps"></a><a href="#win">Yes, Windows has included ssh and curl for a few years!</a></li>  <li><a href="#curl">Option 2) Using curl to test connectivity to a port</a>, including how the curl command responds if the port CANNOT or CAN be reached</li>  <li><a href="#ssh">Option 3) Using ssh to test connectivity to a port</a>, including how that command responds in those cases</li>  <li><a href="#other">Using other cli tools on Linux, Unix, MacOS</a></li>  <li><a href="#why">On understanding WHY the port being checked could not be reached</a></li>  </ul>    <h2 id="ps">Option 1) Powershell's nifty Test-NetConnection</h2>    <p>
<b>Update:</b> this first section has been added since my original post. Thanks to Mark Gregory for <a href="https://www.carehart.org/blog/2023/10/1/testing_port_reachability_with_other_than_telnet#c3D1D347A-C432-43A4-B9FC06F0CDF4EB1A">his kind comment suggesting it</a>.    </p><p>
If you're a powershell user (or are ok using it, even if you favor still using the traditional Windows CMD for the command line), there's a nice cmdlet that can do this task of testing a connection to a port, Test-NetConnection, as in:    </p><p>Test-NetConnection <span>&lt;machine&gt;</span> -port <span>&lt;port&gt;</span></p>    <p>
Of course, <i>machine</i> can be an ip address, domain name, machine name, etc., and it need not be a machine other than yours: it can be your own.      </p><p>
So for instance, someone might test if their SQL Server was reachable on the machine "dbserver" at port 1433 using:    </p><p>Test-NetConnection dbserver -port 1433</p>    <p>
The UI of the tool will appear as it tries to connect, and regardless of its results, in the end it will report true or false, as in:  </p><p>Response includes TcpTestSucceeded: True</p>    <p>
For some readers, that's really all you need to hear and you can stop. For those interested to learn more (who may want to propose other alternatives), please do read on.    </p><h2>What about the long delay if the port is NOT open</h2>    <p>
You may notice that this Test-NetConnection cmdlet will hang if the port on the machine trying to be reached is not available. That hang-time is as much about your a TCP timeout set at the OS level for your machine (from which you're running the test.) I discuss this more later with regard to curl and ssh (which offer options to override that timeout).    </p><p>
Sadly, at this writing, there's no option to override that timeout for Test-NetConnection. (Others have noticed and raised the concern. See <a href="https://copdips.com/2019/09/fast-tcp-port-check-in-powershell.html">this post</a> for a couple of powershell approaches addressing this issue.)    </p><h2>Other ways do exist to test connectivity to such specific apps</h2>    <p>
<b>Update:</b> I previously had these few paragraphs in the next section, but I am moving them up to here because they're natural questions following the example I've offered, which I also use for the other variants below.    </p><p>
And yes, I'm well aware that there are other means by which one could test connectivity to something like SQL Server (or mysql or redis, etc.) from the commandline, using dedicated tools offered for each. The point of this post was to present approaches that works with ANY service whose port accessibility you're checking.    </p><p>
Finally, I'm also aware that there are other ways to find what ports are open on a given machine (port scanning tools) as well as whether and what ports are open on your machine, such as via good ol' netstat or UI tools like curports, to the more modern tool built into Windows (since Vista) called Resource Monitor. The focus here is again on a cli approach to test the accessibility of a port on any machine--versus finding if its one of many open ports, valuable though that info may be.    </p><p>
Anyway, moving on, for those who may still favor CMD (the command prompt) over powershell, you won't find it offering that nifty Test-NetConnection (though again you can call powershell commands from cmd). Instead, you may find some comfort in using curl or ssh, instead, which are covered in the remainder of this post.     </p><h2 id="win">Yes, Windows has included ssh and curl for a few years!</h2>    <p>
So as for ssh and curl, let me point out first some news which may have been missed by many (including those who try to help others or who write about IT matters). You don't NEED to "install putty" anymore: <b><u>Windows has included ssh (an openssh client) for a few years, since later versions of Windows 10 and Server 2019</u></b>.  And the same is true of curl (a command-line browser).    </p><p>
If you want to confirm this, just open a Windows command prompt and type ssh (it should be found within your Windows path, and so should run), which will return brief help for the command. Same with curl!    </p><p>
Now granted, I realize that using curl or ssh to test the availability of a port (especially on another server) is not the real purpose of those tools--any more than it was the purpose of telnet. But the point is that these generally do "work" well, so they're  tools to consider for one's arsenal. And again, I'll cover other tools that you may be able to obtain or find in some Linux distros (or MacOS or Unix) at the end of this post.    </p><p>
Considering also that you find either curl or ssh to suit you better for some situations, I will discuss them both. And I could have presented either one first. I offer curl first as some may be more comfortable with that, if they don't have much experience with ssh. Again the key point is that both these tools should be available to everyone reading this, unless they're on very old deployments of Windows.    </p><h2 id="curl">Option 2) Using curl to test connectivity to a port</h2>    <p>
So let's look first at using curl to test if a port can be reached (though really, I'd recommend option 1 above or option 3 below, for reasons which will become clear):    </p><p>curl <span>&lt;machine&gt;</span>:<span>&lt;port&gt;</span></p>    <p>
Note there's a colon between the machine and the port.  Again, <i>machine</i> could be an ip address, domain name, machine name, etc.     </p><p>
So for instance, someone might test if their SQL Server was reachable on the machine "dbserver" at port 1433 using:    </p><p>curl dbserver:1433</p>    <p>
So let's talk about what one may see depending on whether the connection via curl can or cannot be made. Of course, normally one uses curl to visit a given page on a given site, but again we're just "hacking" it to have it try to merely connect.     </p><h2>How the curl command responds if the port CANNOT be reached, and dealing with hang time</h2>    <p>
If somehow that machine (or ip address or domain name) cannot be reached, the request will hang (more on that in a moment) and then the curl command will respond with this error:    </p><p>curl: (<span>28</span>) Failed to connect to <span>&lt;machine&gt;</span>: <span>&lt;port&gt;</span> after <span>&lt;duration&gt;</span>: ms: Couldn't connect to server</p>    <p>
The key is that this tells us that that the port could not be reached. (As for "why not", neither curl nor ssh can help with that. I discuss that at the end.)    </p><p>
As for this "hang time" waiting to connect, this is something telnet did also. The amount of time it will wait is technically defined by your OS, and is known generically as the TCP timeout time.  A difference with curl versus telnet is that you CAN control how long you're willing for the curl command to await using the command's optional <i>connect-timeout</i> flag, as in the following example to set a 1-second timeout:    </p><p>curl --connect-timeout 1 <span>&lt;machine&gt;</span>:<span>&lt;port&gt;</span></p>    <p>
Finally, if you find it does not stop trying to connect within the number of seconds indicated, do beware that the curl tool may be attempting different additional connections than you may realize. Add the -v arg to the command, to see more verbose output, including details of the connections it's attempting.    </p><p>curl -v --connect-timeout 1 <span>&lt;machine&gt;</span>:<span>&lt;port&gt;</span></p>    <p>
So that's how the tool can tell us (or be tweaked regarding) the failure to connect. Let's move on to what it may show if it CAN connect.    </p><h2>How the curl command responds if the port CAN be reached</h2>    <p>
Remembering that curl is first and foremost a command-line http client, if the connection is successful AND there's a web server on the other end (with a default web page to satisfy this request), <b>the command will respond showing us the output of the page</b>, whatever it is. :-) Or if it does not exist, it will perhaps show the content returned in the form of some sort of 404 error page. (And yes, there are ways to pipe its output to a file or the bit bucket, but I leave you to check out the docs for that.)    </p><p>
If instead the port being tested could be reached but it is NOT for a web server (which may be more common for folks seeking to "test a port's accessibility"), then the curl command will respond (immediately) with an error:    </p><p>curl: (<span>52</span>) Empty reply from server</p>    <p>
And <b>given that our goal again is just to know if the port can be reached, there's value in getting that immediate error: the port CAN be reached.</b>    </p><p>
(Another beneficial difference of this over the old telnet approach is that with that, a successful connection would show a blank screen if the connection, awaiting commands. You'd have to know telnet keystrokes and commands to break out of that, or you might close the terminal window if testing the port was your only reason for opening it.)    </p><p>
But maybe you feel itchy about using curl for this task. Well, if you can be persuaded, there is again the alternative of using ssh...    </p><h2 id="ssh">Option 3) Using ssh to test connectivity to a port</h2>    <p>
As for using ssh to test if a port can be reached, you could do something like this:  </p><p>ssh -p <span>&lt;port&gt;</span> <span>&lt;machine&gt;</span></p>    <p>
Again, <i>machine</i> could be an ip address, domain name, machine name, etc.  (And those two values of machine and port are indeed the reverse order of both the curl above and the traditional telnet.)      </p><h2>How the ssh command responds if the port CANNOT be reached, and dealing with hang time</h2>    <p>
If the port CANNOT be reached, then (like with curl and telnet) the command will hang for an extended period of time before failing with an error like:  </p><p>ssh: connect to host <span>&lt;machine&gt;</span>  port <span>&lt;port&gt;</span>: Connection timed out</p>    <p>
So with my example above, I'd receive this if SQL Server was not listening or inaccessible:  </p><p>ssh: connect to host dbserver port 1433: Connection timed out</p>    <p>
And as in the case of curl, if you want to override that long TCP timeout time for your OS, you can do that with the command's optional ConnectTimeout flag. The following to set a 1-second timeout:    </p><p>ssh -o ConnectTimeout=1  -p <span>&lt;port&gt;</span> <span>&lt;machine&gt;</span></p>    <p>
(And as with curl, if you find it does not stop trying to connect within the number of seconds indicated, do beware that the ssh tool may be attempting different connections than you realize. add the -v arg to the command, to see more details of the connections it's attempting.)    </p><p>
Again, as for "why" it can't be reached, see the end of this port for ideas to consider.    </p><h2>How the ssh command responds if the port CAN be reached</h2>    <p>
If on the other hand the port CAN be reached, the ssh command <b>will respond immediately</b>, which is nice. And that's what makes this (like curl) indeed a helpful tool (.     </p><p>
That said, note that if the port you're checking is technically not an ssh port, the command will also report an "error":   </p><p>kex_exchange_identification: Connection closed by remote host</p>    <p>
In the case of using the command for this test of port connectivity, we can ignore that error. Again, <b>at least this confirms that the port could be reached, which was our primary goal.</b>    </p><h2 id="other">Using other cli tools on Linux, Unix, MacOS</h2>    <p>
Before wrapping up this post, I mentioned at the open how this this technique may appeal to Windows users more than those on *nix OS's, as they not only already have long had the two tools above, but they have still other tools they can use for this task of testing for whether a port can be reached, such as  netcat/nc, which could handle this just as simply:    </p><p>nc -zv <span>&lt;machine&gt;</span> <span>&lt;port&gt;</span></p>    <p>
And as for port-scanning (the broader process of determining what ports are open on a given machine), there is the classic (and powerful) nmap command, but it's beyond the scope of this post (as its related tool ncat, which is not the same as netcat above).    </p><h2 id="why">On understanding WHY the port being checked could not be reached</h2>    <p>
Finally, I realize some may wonder how to know WHY a port can't be reached, but neither of these tools can help with that: they merely respond one way if the port CAN be reached and another if it cannot.     </p><p>
As I noted at the opening, the reach a port may not be open is that the service you're trying to reach is not enabled. Or maybe there's a firewall blocking access to it (which blocking could be specific to your machine from you are attempting to make the connection). There may be a firewall in the OS of the machine you're talking to, or one that's been installed there as software, or there may be one on the network you're connecting to, etc.    </p><p>
Or you may simply have the wrong value for the port you are testing, or the ip address, domain name, machine name, etc.     </p><p>
Before we wrap up, note that sometimes you may find that a given machine can be identified any of many different ways--such that a port may be "open" to you if you try a way that's different from what you're trying (so try an ip address if you have a domain name, or vice-versa, or perhaps try a subdomain if you know of one, and so on).    </p><p>
Often, you will need to get on the server itself (which you can't reach) and attempt these or other tools THERE, to find out if the port is correct in the first place.    </p><h2>Conclusion</h2>    <p>
I hope I've helped you see how curl and ssh (and nc) can be handy tools to have in your arsenal, when you just want to quickly test port accessibility from the commandline. For those on Windows, you can stop trying to install telnet to do a quick port test: just use curl or ssh! :-) That was really the primary motivation of my post here.    </p><p>
And let me know how it goes.    </p><p>
Indeed, this is one of those topics where there may be dark corners, edge cases, and unexpected situations where results differ. I'm sure some people have more experience to share, whether other gotchas or tips, or still other tools that may be built-in to Windows or *nix. As for other tools one might obtain, those are less interesting as again the post here is about built-in tools, because often people are working in environments (especially on servers or containers) where they're not necessarily free to/wanting to install software.    </p><p>

			<p>It’s no secret that the Trump administration has fostered a culture of corruption in which special interests and big donors advance their interests at the expense of everyday people. Perhaps no policy area exemplifies this corruption more than the issue of drug pricing.</p>
<p>President Trump has long promised to stand up to the pharmaceutical industry and lower prescription drug prices, but he has avoided taking serious action to drive down prices while at the same time filling top spots in his administration with industry insiders. This administration’s culture of corruption, which continues a decadeslong practice of political pandering to the pharmaceutical industry, carries a real cost; Americans spent&nbsp;$535 billion<a href="#f1" tooltip=""><sup>1</sup></a>&nbsp;on prescription drugs in 2018, an increase of 50 percent since 2010. These price increases far surpass inflation, with Big Pharma increasing prices on its most-prescribed medications by anywhere from 40 percent to 71 percent from 2011 to 2015.<a href="#f2" tooltip=""><sup>2</sup></a></p>

			<p>Moreover, pharmaceutical companies receive substantial U.S. government assistance in the form of publicly funded basic research and tax breaks, yet they continue to charge exorbitant prices for medications. But the issue goes beyond cost. In America, more than 1 million individuals suffer from Type 1 diabetes<a href="#f3" tooltip=""><sup>3</sup></a>, a condition where the body cannot make insulin, which is essential for getting glucose (also known as blood sugar) into cells from the bloodstream. Without insulin, glucose accumulates in the bloodstream<a href="#f4" tooltip=""><sup>4</sup></a>, causing dangerously high blood sugar levels. Among all Americans suffering from diabetes, at least 1 in 4<a href="#f5" tooltip=""><sup>5</sup></a> have said that they engaged in insulin rationing—a tactic of using less insulin than is needed in order to make the doses last longer—as a direct result of the skyrocketing price of the drug. A vial of insulin, which is the only life-sustaining option for Type 1 diabetics, retails at &nbsp;around $300.<a href="#f6" tooltip=""><sup>6</sup></a> A 2018 study commissioned by the Congressional Diabetes Caucus found that the price of&nbsp;insulin has doubled since 2012<a href="#f7" tooltip=""><sup>7</sup></a>; in the 10 years prior, the price of insulin nearly tripled. Despite the dangers of insulin rationing, which can lead to diabetic ketoacidosis, a fatal condition, many Americans have no other choice. That was the case for&nbsp;Antroinette<a href="#f8" tooltip=""><sup>8</sup></a>, whose daughter was rationing insulin due to the high cost and died at the age of 22 as a result.</p>
<div>
<h3>Insulin facts</h3>
<ul>
<li>Access to insulin for patients with Type 1 diabetes is a matter of life or death.<a href="#f9" tooltip=""><sup>9</sup></a></li>
<li>While insulin has existed since the1920s<a href="#f10" tooltip=""><sup>10</sup></a>, the price since then has skyrocketed, especially in recent years. Prices for insulin increased by 197 percent between 2002 and 2013, from $4.34 per milliliter to $12.92 per milliliter.<a href="#f11" tooltip=""><sup>11</sup></a></li>
<li>There are three insulin manufacturers serving the United States: Eli Lilly and Co., Novo Nordisk A/S, and Sanofi SA.</li>
<li>Eli Lillyannounced<a href="#f12" tooltip=""><sup>12</sup></a>&nbsp;in March 2019 that it would begin selling a generic version of its Humalog insulin at half the price. The medication, known as lispro, will cost $137.35 per vial. To compare pricing,&nbsp;a 2018 study<a href="#f13" tooltip=""><sup>13</sup></a>&nbsp;estimated that the cost of making a year’s worth of insulin for one patient ranges from $78 to $133.</li>
<li>Ahead of its hearing on drug pricing in February 2019, the U.S. Senate Committee on Finance sent aletter<a href="#f14" tooltip=""><sup>14</sup></a>&nbsp;to Eli Lilly asking why insulin is priced&nbsp;so astonishingly high. A vial of NovoLog, one type of insulin, costs<a href="#f15" tooltip=""><sup>15</sup></a> anywhere from $14 to $300 in the United States but only $48 in Singapore, $14 in India, $6 in Austria, and $0 in Italy.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h3>American taxpayers fund basic research</h3>
<p>Billions of taxpayer dollars go into the creation and marketing<a href="#f16" tooltip=""><sup>16</sup></a> of new drugs. <em>The Los Angeles Times</em> reports that, “Since the 1930s, the National Institutes of Health has invested close to&nbsp;$900<a href="#f17" tooltip=""><sup>17</sup></a> billion in the basic and applied research that formed both the pharmaceutical and biotechnology sectors.” Despite taxpayers’ crucial investment, U.S. consumers are increasingly paying more for their prescription drugs.</p>
<p>A&nbsp;2018&nbsp;study<a href="#f18" tooltip=""><sup>18</sup></a>&nbsp;on the National Institute of Health’s (NIH) financial contributions to new drug approvals found that the agency “contributed to published research associated with&nbsp;every one of the 210&nbsp;new drugs approved by the Food and Drug Administration from 2010–2016.”&nbsp;More than&nbsp;$100 billion&nbsp;in NIH funding went toward research that contributed directly or indirectly to the 210 drugs approved during that six-year period. The&nbsp;NIH Research Project Grant (R01)<a href="#f19" tooltip=""><sup>19</sup></a>—which supports health-related research—was by far the most common kind of grant used to fund the science that supported the new drugs.&nbsp;In all, NIH gave out nearly 118,000<a href="#f20" tooltip=""><sup>20</sup></a> R01 grants related to those drugs from 2010 to 2016.</p>

			<h3>Federal perks for Big Pharma add up</h3>
<p>Pharmaceutical companies also benefit from research and development tax credits.&nbsp;The federal R&amp;D tax credit was first introduced in 1981 to encourage private sector&nbsp;investment in pioneering research.<a href="#f21" tooltip=""><sup>21</sup></a> This tax credit is available to businesses that attempt to develop new, improved, or&nbsp;technologically advanced products or trade processes.<a href="#f22" tooltip=""><sup>22</sup></a> In 2015, former President Barack Obama signed into law the&nbsp;Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act<a href="#f23" tooltip=""><sup>23</sup></a>, which made these tax credits permanent and extended them to small businesses and startup companies.</p>
<p>Pharmaceutical industries also receive a tax deduction for their marketing and advertising expenses. According to a report in the <em>Journal of the American Medical Association</em>, “From 1997 through 2016, medical marketing expanded substantially, and spending increased from&nbsp;$17.7 to $29.9 billion,<a href="#f24" tooltip=""><sup>24</sup></a> with direct-to-consumer advertising for prescription drugs and health services accounting for the&nbsp;most rapid growth, and&nbsp;pharmaceutical marketing to health professionals&nbsp;accounting for most promotional spending.” The report also found that from 1997 through 2016, “the number of advertisements … increased from&nbsp;79,000 (including 72,000 television commercials) in 1997 to 4.6 million (663,000 television<a href="#f25" tooltip=""><sup>25</sup></a>&nbsp;commercials) in 2016.”</p>
<h3>Big Pharma’s drug pricing maximizes profits</h3>
<p>Despite these taxpayer subsidies, prescription drug prices are nonetheless increasing at an alarming rate. In 2019, price increases&nbsp;from drug manufacturers affected more than 3,400<a href="#f26" tooltip=""><sup>26</sup></a> drugs. For example, Allergan, a major pharmaceutical manufacturer, raised prices on 51 drugs, just more than half its portfolio. Some medications&nbsp;that Allergan manufactures saw a 9.5 percent jump in cost, while others saw a 4.9 percent increase in cost.<a href="#f27" tooltip=""><sup>27</sup></a> Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd., the largest generic drug manufacturer in the world,&nbsp;increased its drug prices by more than 9 percent.<a href="#f28" tooltip=""><sup>28</sup></a> These sharp increases in&nbsp;price&nbsp;occur&nbsp;as companies&nbsp;continue to report millions of dollars in revenue. In 2018, Allergan reported $15.8 million<a href="#f29" tooltip=""><sup>29</sup></a> in revenue, while Teva Pharmaceuticals reported $18.8 million<a href="#f30" tooltip=""><sup>30</sup></a> in revenue.</p>
<p>Pharmaceutical companies’ profit margins receive significant bumps when they launch new drugs, specifically specialty drugs, used to treat life-threatening conditions. These drugs often cost more than most Americans can afford. Pharmaceutical companies have stated that the prices are high because the drugs are difficult to manufacture. In 2013, for example, industry giant Gilead Sciences launched Sovaldi, a hepatitis C drug, at $1,000 per pill<a href="#f31" tooltip=""><sup>31</sup></a>, or $84,000<a href="#f32" tooltip=""><sup>32</sup></a> per treatment, which could last 12 to 24 weeks.<a href="#f33" tooltip=""><sup>33</sup></a> After an 18-month investigation into the company’s pricing, the Senate Finance Committee concluded that Gilead had pursued a marketing and pricing strategy designed to “maximize revenue with little concern for access or affordability.”<a href="#f34" tooltip=""><sup>34</sup></a></p>
<p>Drug companies also benefit from patents, which give them monopoly power for their on-patent products. These patents ensure that prices remain high by reducing competition. Drug patents last for 20 years after the filing date. Pharmaceutical companies have also employed tactics such as evergreening and thicketing to prolong a drug’s exclusivity. When evergreening, pharmaceutical companies make certain modifications to a drug such as changing its<a href="#f35" tooltip=""><sup>35</sup></a> chemical composition slightly or making an external change as minor as adding a stripe to a pill<a href="#f36" tooltip=""><sup>36</sup></a> in order to preserve their patents. A 2018 study in the <em>Journal of Law and the Biosciences</em> found that 78 percent<a href="#f37" tooltip=""><sup>37</sup></a> of new drug patents awarded in the past decade went to drugs that already existed. Seventy percent <a href="#f38" tooltip=""><sup>38</sup></a> of the nearly 100 bestselling drugs extended their exclusivity protections at least once, and 50 percent extended their patents more than once. The second tactic—thicketing—involves flooding the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and the courts with excessive patents and applications to make it difficult for competing firms to secure patents. These tactics help preserve pharmaceutical companies’ monopolies and ensure that drug prices remain uncompetitive and thus less affordable for everyday Americans.</p>
<p>While consumers continue to pay the price of this market manipulation, a Government Accountability Office (GAO) report on the pharmaceutical industry found that these unfair practices are significantly enriching manufacturers. As the report stated, “Among the largest 25 companies, annual average profit margin fluctuated between&nbsp;15 and 20 percent.”<a href="#f39" tooltip=""><sup>39</sup></a> The GAO contextualizes these profits by comparing the pharmaceutical industry’s profits with those of its counterparts, stating that “the annual average profit margin across non-drug companies among the largest 500 globally fluctuated between 4 and 9 percent.”</p>
<p>In 2018 alone, the CEOs of major pharmaceutical companies Allergan, Johnson &amp; Johnson, and Pfizer Inc. made a total of $90 million.<a href="#f40" tooltip=""><sup>40</sup></a> Meanwhile,&nbsp;according to a CBS News report, Americans spent&nbsp;$535 billion<a href="#f41" tooltip=""><sup>41</sup></a> on prescription drugs in 2018—an increase of 50 percent since 2010.<a href="#f42" tooltip=""><sup>42</sup></a> As pharmaceutical industry&nbsp;profits increase<a href="#f43" tooltip=""><sup>43</sup></a>, everyday Americans—whose tax dollars play a critical role in funding the research and development of these medications—are not receiving anything close to a fair return on their investment.</p>
<p>A recent Pew Charitable Trusts study found that Americans spent $65.8 billion<a href="#f44" tooltip=""><sup>44</sup></a> out of pocket in 2016 for retail prescription drugs, up from $59.5 billion in 2012. The high cost of prescription drugs is a significant driver of medical debt<a href="#f45" tooltip=""><sup>45</sup></a> because Americans are increasingly reliant on medication to&nbsp;manage long-term chronic conditions.<a href="#f46" tooltip=""><sup>46</sup></a> Additionally, the high cost of prescription drugs has forced many Americans to take drastic measures, including foregoing taking their medications as prescribed or traveling abroad in order to save on medications. A 2019 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention study found that 11.4 percent<a href="#f47" tooltip=""><sup>47</sup></a> of adults aged 18 to 64 did not take their prescription drugs as prescribed in order to reduce how much they spent on their medications. And, as NPR recently reported, “The U.S government estimates that close to&nbsp;1 million<a href="#f48" tooltip=""><sup>48</sup></a>&nbsp;Americans&nbsp;in California alone go to Mexico annually for health care, including to buy prescription drugs.” In May 2019,&nbsp;a group of Americans<a href="#f49" tooltip=""><sup>49</sup></a>&nbsp;living with Type 1 diabetes traveled to Canada to purchase insulin and&nbsp;call on&nbsp;the U.S. government to regulate the cost of lifesaving drugs.&nbsp;The costs associated with traveling abroad make it logistically and financially impractical for most Americans. Further, traveling abroad presents certain health risks given that some countries have lax drug certification standards compared with FDA standards.</p>

			<h3>President Trump’s broken promises on drug pricing</h3>
<p>In an interview with <em>Time </em>magazine ahead of being chosen as its Person of the Year in 2016, Trump said, “I’m going to bring down drug prices. I don’t like what’s happened with drug prices.”<a href="#f50" tooltip=""><sup>50</sup></a> He promised to bring Americans’ drug spending down to $0 by negotiating drug prices.<a href="#f51" tooltip=""><sup>51</sup></a> Trump made grandiose promises on drug pricing but almost three years later has only managed to deliver a handful of half-measures, illustrating his administration’s lack of commitment to lowering drug prices. One of Trump’s proposals from his so-called presidential blueprint<a href="#f52" tooltip=""><sup>52</sup></a> included eliminating some rebates paid by drug companies<a href="#f53" tooltip=""><sup>53</sup></a> that hide the true cost of drugs. However, the Congressional Budget Office estimated that the measure would actually increase federal spending on Medicare and Medicaid by $177 billion.<a href="#f54" tooltip=""><sup>54</sup></a> The Trump administration also announced a regulation that would require TV ads for drugs to include the list price.<a href="#f55" tooltip=""><sup>55</sup></a> Some experts believe this policy will be ineffective<a href="#f56" tooltip=""><sup>56</sup></a> at making pharmaceutical companies lower list prices or end price hikes for drugs and will only confuse or mislead consumers rather than help them.<a href="#f57" tooltip=""><sup>57</sup></a> These half-measures, combined with Trump surrounding himself with high-level Big Pharma officials, clearly communicates that the administration is not on track to lower drug costs for Americans.</p>
<p>Congress has done little to address the problem of high drug prices. Instead, many members continue to enjoy&nbsp;cozy relationships with the pharmaceutical industry. The industry spent more than&nbsp;$62 million in the 2016 congressional elections—the&nbsp;most it has ever spent on political campaigns.<a href="#f58" tooltip=""><sup>58</sup></a> The massive influx of campaign cash benefited&nbsp;members of both parties, including&nbsp;those that sit on committees with jurisdiction over drug pricing.<a href="#f59" tooltip=""><sup>59</sup></a>&nbsp;Big Pharma’s investment has paid off as recently as July 2019, when the Senate Finance Committee failed to pass an amendment on the&nbsp;Prescription Drug Pricing Reduction Act of 2019, which&nbsp;would have allowed Medicare to negotiate drug prices with manufacturers.<a href="#f60" tooltip=""><sup>60</sup></a><u>&nbsp;</u>Medicare’s ability to negotiate on drug prices, which is currently prohibited by law, “would provide the leverage needed to lower drug costs.”<a href="#f61" tooltip=""><sup>61</sup></a></p>
<p>Despite his promise to be tough on Big Pharma, President Trump has proven to be a friend to the industry. Big Pharma officials have filled at least 16<a href="#f62" tooltip=""><sup>62</sup></a> current or former positions in the Trump administration, and many of Trump’s top health advisers have been industry insiders or close to the pharmaceutical companies. Trump’s first secretary of health and human services, former Rep. Tom Price (R-GA), was a longtime friend of the industry<a href="#f63" tooltip=""><sup>63</sup></a> in Congress, where he not only pushed Big Pharma’s agenda but also benefited from it financially.<a href="#f64" tooltip=""><sup>64</sup></a> Price, who drew scrutiny for more than $300,000 in health care stock trades, was eventually forced to resign in 2017<a href="#f65" tooltip=""><sup>65</sup></a> as a result of his illicit use of private jets on the taxpayers’ dime.</p>
<p>In 2017, Trump nominated Joe Grogan<a href="#f66" tooltip=""><sup>66</sup></a> to a top position at the U.S. Office of Management and Budget. Grogan spent five years as a lobbyist for Gilead—the pharmaceutical company that is infamous for its sky-high prices on a cure for hepatitis C.<a href="#f67" tooltip=""><sup>67</sup></a> Since joining the administration, Grogan has led drug-pricing proposals and participated in Trump’s Drug Pricing and Innovation Working Group.”<a href="#f68" tooltip=""><sup>68</sup></a> However, the working group has proposed pharma-friendly measures such as implementing monopoly rights outside of the United States, speeding up approval from the FDA for new drugs, and eliminating price cuts for hospitals in impoverished areas.</p>
<p>President Trump chose to replace Price with Alex Azar, the former president of&nbsp;Eli Lilly—one of the companies that is working to keep drug prices high while everyday Americans suffer—to oversee his efforts to address drug pricing as secretary of health and human services.</p>
<p>In 2018, pharmaceutical companies spent more than $283 million in lobbying dollars<a href="#f69" tooltip=""><sup>69</sup></a>, with Eli Lilly spending just less than $6.8 million in 2018.<a href="#f70" tooltip=""><sup>70</sup></a> While Azar, Trump’s chief health adviser, was president of Eli Lilly, the company drastically increased insulin prices. Eli Lilly is currently defending itself against a class-action lawsuit<a href="#f71" tooltip=""><sup>71</sup></a> accusing&nbsp;the company&nbsp;of colluding with pharmacy benefit managers—individuals who negotiate drug pricing and availability with drug companies for&nbsp;the&nbsp;government and other insurance plans—to&nbsp;increase&nbsp;prices. Big Pharma and pharmacy benefit managers have been playing a blame game<a href="#f72" tooltip=""><sup>72</sup></a>&nbsp;while lawmakers—who have held several hearings in the&nbsp;U.S. House of Representatives<a href="#f73" tooltip=""><sup>73</sup></a>&nbsp;and the U.S.&nbsp;Senate<a href="#f74" tooltip=""><sup>74</sup></a>—try to find the source of America’s drug pricing problem.</p>
<p>Given the sway that Big Pharma has with the administration, the industry has no plans to reduce prescription drug prices or reverse past price gouging. For his part, President Trump tried but failed to pass the American Health Care Act of 2017, which would have hurt millions of Americans while benefiting the pharmaceutical industry, among others. However, he was successful in signing into law a new tax bill that lowered the corporate tax rate by 14 percent, allowing pharmaceutical companies, including those with ties to the Trump administration, to save a total of $76 billion.<a href="#f75" tooltip=""><sup>75</sup></a> After the tax law was enacted, Eli Lilly received a tax cut of nearly $4.5 billion on offshore profits.<a href="#f76" tooltip=""><sup>76</sup></a> Instead of using these tax savings to lower drug prices, big pharmaceutical companies such as Eli Lilly together used $45 billion of their total tax savings<a href="#f77" tooltip=""><sup>77</sup></a> to benefit shareholders via stock buyback programs. After President Trump helped Eli Lilly save billions, Azar, the company’s top executive, was confirmed to head the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services<a href="#f78" tooltip=""><sup>78</sup></a> at the beginning of the following year.</p>

			<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Although the Trump administration keeps promising to lower drug prices, drug costs continue to climb as Americans suffer and pharmaceutical companies profit and their CEOs line their pockets. The government-funded research and major tax benefits that these pharmaceutical companies enjoy help them stay profitable. Meanwhile, they continue to hike up the costs of drugs, particularly life-sustaining drugs such as insulin.</p>
<p>Big Pharma can play this game indefinitely, benefiting from this culture of corruption, using allies in the administration and in Congress to grow their profit margins while everyday people suffer. But there are steps lawmakers can take to reduce the influence of special interests, including Big Pharma.<a href="#f79" tooltip=""><sup>79</sup></a> For example, lobbyists are currently allowed to fundraise for candidates for federal office—and many of them provide far more financial support beyond the $2,800 per candidate limit by hosting fundraising events and bundling contributions. Banning lobbyists from fundraising<a href="#f80" tooltip=""><sup>80</sup></a> for candidates would reduce special-interest influence over the legislative process. Another way to limit corrupting conflicts of interest is to ban members of Congress from accepting campaign donations from entities under the jurisdiction of the committees on which the serve. It is understood that conflicts can easily arise from committee contributions, which explains why 88 percent of voters support this prohibition.<a href="#f81" tooltip=""><sup>81</sup></a> Additionally, Washington’s infamous revolving door between private industry and government must be closed. Proposals to do so include a lifetime lobbying ban on members of Congress and a five-year lobbying ban on senior congressional staffers.<a href="#f82" tooltip=""><sup>82</sup></a></p>
<p>As Americans are caught trying to decide whether to pay for rent or medicine, pharmaceutical companies continue to reap government benefits.&nbsp;Reducing drug prices and the costs that everyday people must pay is not possible without fixing the broken system in Washington.</p>
