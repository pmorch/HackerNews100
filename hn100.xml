<p>12th November 2024</p>



<p>There’s a whole lot of buzz around the new <a href="https://qwenlm.github.io/blog/qwen2.5-coder-family/">Qwen2.5-Coder Series</a> of open source (Apache 2.0 licensed) LLM releases from Alibaba’s Qwen research team. On first impression it looks like the buzz is well deserved.</p>
<p>Qwen claim:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Instruct has become the current SOTA open-source code model, matching the coding capabilities of GPT-4o.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That’s a <em>big</em> claim for a 32B model that’s small enough that it can run on my 64GB MacBook Pro M2. The Qwen published scores look impressive, comparing favorably with GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 Sonnet (October 2024) edition across various code-related benchmarks:</p>
<p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2024/qwen-scores.jpg" alt="In benchmark comparisons, Qwen 2.5 Coder (32B Instruct) outperforms both GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 Sonnet on LiveCodeBench, Spider, and BIRD-SQL metrics, falls behind on MBPP, Aider, and CodeArena, shows mixed results on MultiPL-E, and performs similarly on HumanEval and McEval benchmarks."></p>
<p>How about benchmarks from other researchers? Paul Gauthier’s <a href="https://aider.chat/docs/leaderboards/">Aider benchmarks</a> have a great reputation and <a href="https://twitter.com/paulgauthier/status/1856018124031832236">Paul reports</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The new Qwen 2.5 Coder models did very well on aider’s code editing benchmark. The 32B Instruct model scored in between GPT-4o and 3.5 Haiku.</p>
<p>84% 3.5 Sonnet,
75% 3.5 Haiku,
74% Qwen2.5 Coder 32B,
71% GPT-4o,
69% Qwen2.5 Coder 14B,
58% Qwen2.5 Coder 7B</p>
<p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2024/qwen-paul.jpg" alt="Those numbers as a chart"></p>
</blockquote>
<p>That was for the Aider “whole edit” benchmark. The “diff” benchmark <a href="https://twitter.com/paulgauthier/status/1856042640279777420">scores well</a> too, with Qwen2.5 Coder 32B tying with GPT-4o (but a little behind Claude 3.5 Haiku).</p>
<p>Given these scores (and the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1gp84in/qwen25coder_32b_the_ai_thats_revolutionizing/">positive buzz on Reddit</a>) I had to try it for myself.</p>
<p>My attempts to run the <a href="https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Instruct-GGUF">Qwen/Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Instruct-GGUF</a> Q8 using <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm-gguf">llm-gguf</a> were a bit too slow, because I don’t have that compiled to use my Mac’s GPU at the moment.</p>
<p>But both the <a href="https://ollama.com/">Ollama</a> version <em>and</em> the <a href="https://github.com/ml-explore/mlx">MLX</a> version worked great!</p>
<p>I installed the Ollama version using:</p>
<pre><code>ollama pull qwen2.5-coder:32b
</code></pre>
<p>That fetched a 20GB quantized file. I ran a prompt through that using my <a href="https://llm.datasette.io/">LLM</a> tool and Sergey Alexandrov’s <a href="https://github.com/taketwo/llm-ollama">llm-ollama</a> plugin like this:</p>
<pre><code>llm install llm-ollama
llm models # Confirming the new model is present
llm -m qwen2.5-coder:32b 'python function that takes URL to a CSV file and path to a SQLite database, fetches the CSV with the standard library, creates a table with the right columns and inserts the data'
</code></pre>
<p>Here’s <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/0a47f9e35a50d4e25a47826f4ab75dda">the result</a>. The code worked, but I had to work around a frustrating <code>ssl</code> bug first (which wouldn’t have been an issue if I’d allowed the model to use <code>requests</code> or <code>httpx</code> instead of the standard library).</p>
<p>I also tried running it using the Apple Silicon fast array framework MLX using the <a href="https://github.com/riccardomusmeci/mlx-llm">mlx-llm</a> library directly, run via <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/uv">uv</a> like this:</p>
<pre><code>uv run --with mlx-lm \
  mlx_lm.generate \
  --model mlx-community/Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Instruct-8bit \
  --max-tokens 4000 \
  --prompt 'write me a python function that renders a mandelbrot fractal as wide as the current terminal'
</code></pre>
<p>That gave me a <em>very</em> <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/1cc1e0418a04dbd19cd281cf9b43666f">satisfying result</a>—when I ran the code it generated in a terminal I got this:</p>
<p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2024/mlx-fractal.jpg" alt="macOS terminal window displaying a pleasing mandelbrot fractal as ASCII art"></p>
<p>This is a really promising development. 32GB is just small enough that I can run the model on my Mac without having to quit every other application I’m running, and both the speed and the quality of the results feel genuinely competitive with the current best of the hosted models.</p>

<p>Given that code assistance is probably around 80% of my LLM usage at the moment this is a meaningfully useful release for how I engage with this class of technology.</p>

I want to thank users Makefile, acgs, sergey, Timo W., sharkcz, Hpela, Alvaro64, Chuck(G), Theoryboy, modem7, Toportyán, Hak Foo, sorphin, ajacocks, Eudimorphodon, lowen, jonny64, HoJoPo, mogwaay, upnorth and sqpat for their responses, constructive ideas and discussions, and technical feedback!</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">In particular I want to thank Johann (jonny64) who took an active concern and participation in my project to help reverse engineer the PAL chips on the 5170 mainboard.
This process has been extremely difficult and Johann helped a lot by programming python scripts to quickly be able to analyze large volumes of logic equation information.
Resulting from our cooperation Johann has developed a reverse engineering python program called "pete" and a script which can generate the PAL fuse maps from reverse analysis which can be directly programmed into a GAL. He is planning, or has published his work in the mean time on GitHub so be sure to search for his project here if you are doing similar work on PAL ICs used in old devices.</p>
<p dir="auto">User Alvaro64 from Spain was very kind to provide friendly discussions and various information and he even offered me to borrow his legacy Intel mainboard for checking and analysis.</p>
<p dir="auto">I was happy to see some reactions from Sergey who also did some amazing work to design and build various classic PCs. He developed a BIOS of his own and a HD Floppy supporting BIOS extension.</p>
<p dir="auto">User lowen gave me some very useful time saving tips in using CPLD programmable logic from Atmel/Microchip, to be able to more easily and quickly get started with suitable CPLD parts in this project.
This will be my first programmable logic project which I will explain below.
User Eudomorphodon provided me some valuable feedback in terms of which type of logic would be possible to exist within the IBM PALS which was a big issue and problem to determine exactly what IBM did in their PAL programming, literally costing me a few weeks.
User sharkcz was very helpful for pointing me to the Copam PC-501 schematics where I found more clues about the 80287 coprocessor control circuits which are also located in a PAL on the IBM 5170.
User Chuck(G) also provided various information and wrote extensive useful information about PAL chips and how to reverse engineer them.</p>
<p dir="auto">I thank Charles MacDonald for developing his PAL read adapter and PA.EXE software which reduces the logic equations.
As I mentioned, Johann(jonny64) developed his own version of a PAL analyzer named "pete" which can do a few more advanced things to be able to do very important logic reductions and conclusions on RAW PAL read data from Charles' adapter. Especially is "pete" able to detect certain inputs on a PAL which sometimes switch to operating as an output. So the scripts Johann made can conclude this mode of operation by itself and also can reduce the subsequent logic consequences of this operation mode in the logic equations. If we don't have this automatic function from pete, it will be the person doing the analysis who will need to reason what is happening back from the observations, which is what I have initially done myself, it was quite a frustrating process to discover what was happening exactly inside the PAL U87 which caused me a lot of stress and lost sleep!</p>
<p dir="auto">Also a special thanks goes out to user LimeProgramming (Adam) here on GitHub for making his excellent USB to serial mouse project with the RP2040!
<a href="https://github.com/LimeProgramming/USB-serial-mouse-adapter">https://github.com/LimeProgramming/USB-serial-mouse-adapter</a>
He kindly agrees for his project to be integrated into mine in a modified form, thank you Adam!</p>
<p dir="auto">During my work I always keep meeting other enthousiasts, a special mention deserves Luca (Retro*Tech) from Italy who supported me with encouraging words and expressed the kind wish to contribute some helpful hardware items for my research and development work. Thanks Luca!</p>
<p dir="auto">Thanks to sqpat for the friendly discussions about how to enhance my project, for sending me two of his verified high clock rate 286 CPUs, and for his suggested assembly code to make a shadow copy of all ROM code into shadow RAM. This change made 20MHz operation a reality! Do remember to check out <a href="https://github.com/sqpat/RealDOOM">his project RealDoom here on GitHub</a>!</p>
<p dir="auto">Thank you dreNorteR for your helpful assembly code contributions and X86 programming tips for detecting a warm boot to support shadow copy functions!</p>
<p dir="auto">Everyone else who showed an interest in my work and commented and replied to all my posts, thanks for your help and friendship!</p>

<p dir="auto">After elaborately studying the available source design files which inspired the system, I conceived this design with my own variations, circuit additions and changes which I see as improvements according to my personal design views and preferences.</p>
<p dir="auto">My purpose was a good and clear recreation in my own methods, and never to exactly copy the original.
This project also serves to document the historical 16 bit AT PC design by implementing the fundamental concepts in a functional build which incorporates a lot of the original design concepts and functions which Don Estridge of IBM conceived. I admire Don and his work and I will attempt to explain in this text why his 16 bit AT concept was so important and elemental in promoting the industry standard development process!</p>
<p dir="auto">I have designed various I/O control circuits using the chip manufacturer datasheets to determine the proper interfacing methods, ports etc suitable for this 286 AT design.
I also searched in many IO port documents to determine how to interface the onboard devices.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">How the project took more solid form</h2><a id="user-content-how-the-project-took-more-solid-form" aria-label="Permalink: How the project took more solid form" href="#how-the-project-took-more-solid-form"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">I started by finding a suitable mainboard for study, testing and analysis. I found a few examples from NCR and ARC however these proved to be frustratingly unstable and in a poorly operating condition. By no means would I have been able to base this project on those designs. Luckily I found an Ebay auction which offered an IBM 5170 mainboard for a very reasonable price. I repaired this mainboard and I have extensively tested it out. The IBM has the added advantage of being completely documented in their schematics which was very useful for this project.</p>
<p dir="auto">I proceeded to draft modern KiCad schematics for the 5170 and subsequently modified the IBM designs to suit this project as much as possible. This involved removing the DRAM support logic and parity checking mechanisms from the schematics. Next I needed to reverse engineer the contents of PAL U87 which is elemental in the 5170 operation. Without the U87 design, a 5170 and its schematics will be useless and missing the vital operating circuits without which we have no AT! At the time there was not any documentation of the logic contained inside U87 to be found anywhere. So I proceeded to discover the logic by analysis. I used the method developed by Charles MacDonald initially and discussed with Johann to develop a utility program python script which I needed to form my conclusions about the actual operation of the U87 PAL.
Finally we succeeded to crack the design and even further simplify the logic equations of U87 to their most likely original PAL source code as originally created, probably by Don Estridge himself. If anyone has more information on how he developed the AT, please contact me, I am very much interested!</p>
<p dir="auto">After I had the complete design of the 5170, I had to evaluate the large amount of logic chips which would be involved in case I would choose to use TTL chips only to implement the whole design. From the equations of U87, I could conclude why IBM chose this path of development. Adding all this additional logic would make the PCB even larger and make this whole concept impossible to properly implement on a single PCB in a practical PCB size. So I have concluded that I will need to use programmable logic in order to reduce the PCB area needed. And since I needed to use programmable logic anyway, I decided I had better do it properly to benefit from this concept the most. So I chose the ATF1508AS CPLD with the help and advice of user lowen.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Development path leading up to the first design revision</h2><a id="user-content-development-path-leading-up-to-the-first-design-revision" aria-label="Permalink: Development path leading up to the first design revision" href="#development-path-leading-up-to-the-first-design-revision"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">After reverse engineering PAL U87, I proceeded to draft schematics and did some initial parts placements on the mainboard. This quickly led me to conclude that in order to integrate many necessary devices onboard as planned, I would need to shift the entire memory subsystem and decoder CPLD onto a ISA adapter card. The BIOS and option ROM EPROMS are still placed on the mainboard because I like it more this way in a more traditional view of typical mainboards of the time.</p>
<p dir="auto">I proceeded to draft my modified and new design of this project into schematics using KiCad and Quartus.</p>
<p dir="auto">The complete design including my changes and additions is contained in and needs:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>a full ATX size mainboard PCB</li>
<li>three 84 pin PLCC CPLDs which can be plugged into through-hole sockets</li>
<li>a ISA memory subsystem card PCB containing the footprints for a total of 15MB of fully decoded SRAM memory.
This card provides 640KB of conventional memory, 128KB of UMBs at D0000 and E0000 segments with disable jumpers, and 14MB of XMS memory.
Each set of two 512KB SRAM ICs provides an additional megabyte of RAM for the system.
The amount of memory can be chosen by populating the desired amount of SRAM chips.
So basically this ISA slot card takes the function of the historically more typical DRAM SIMMs and implements the full PC memory space in SRAM memory.
Please note to observe the pin 1 mark of your particular RAM ICs and make sure you are not using a reversed pinout SRAM which would need to be soldered in flipped over orientation!</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">The mainboard provides two 16 bit IDE ports, a 8 bit SCSI port, a floppy drive interface, 16 bit Realtek LAN, USB to serial mouse using RP2040, discrete simplified LPT port, ATX power supply control, reset logic, and various LEDs to indicate certain system functions. The 64k BIOS is contained in two EPROMs on the mainboard and there is also a 32kb sized option ROM EPROM socket included on the mainboard. The design of this project is meant to use the XT-IDE BIOS option ROM software developed by XT IDE universal BIOS team, which needs to be configured and programmed into an option ROM EPROM IC which can be placed in the option ROM socket on the mainboard.</p>

<p dir="auto">IBM released the 5170 on the market for a price which no competitor on the PC market could equal at the time. For a long period of time, the AT went without any competition!
IBM even could not meet the demand of new units.
The 5170 offered substantial performance increases which raised the PC standard to a whole new level of usage, and formed a true competing product for mini computers at the time.
But the AT was much more than those aspects when you dive deep into the technology which powers it. IBM succeeded in creating a 16 bit PC which achieved 100% compatibility with all previous 8-bit hardware and software. When you study how this was done, you realize it was no small thing! In order to achieve this they created some pretty ingenious mechanisms of 8 to 16 bit data byte conversions for which they even synchronized and modified the CPU cycles on the 80286 by delaying them while the data bytes are being converted with perfect timings. The more I studied this principle, the more respect I developed for the work by IBM engineers. To provide such advanced conversion technology in the AT was a stroke of genious and this has played an extremely important role in the historic success of the 16 bit AT PC and it further solidified the success of the emerging industry standard. When you look at computer history, this achievement of true backward compatibility is truly amazing to behold and in my opinion this is a much overlooked fact. To the user it is almost invisible because everything simply works and is fully functional. 8 And 16 bit technology just works seemlessly and perfectly together. But for those who study everything in full detail, this reveils some amazing technology and circuits developed by IBM which deserve some proper respect and credit.</p>

<p dir="auto">I recommend using a BIOS other than the IBM one mainly because the IBM BIOS is known to contain restrictions in operation and verifies the clock speed to lockout operation if the speed is raised.
So any similar BIOS to the IBM 5170 from other sources would possibly qualify to run on this project.
There have been BIOS code produced by ARC, COPAM, NCR and MR BIOS to name a few examples.
MR BIOS is the most elegant BIOS at the moment. It may sometimes misdetect the COM port chip, erasing the CMOS RAM will reset detection.
Recommended to backup the CMOS RAM with a utility to file as soon as the COM port is detected.
Restoring that file and a CTRL-ALT-DEL ensures that you can use the mouse properly.
The Quadtel BIOS for 5170 is best at detecting all hardware though less elegant looking, but 100% reliable.</p>

<p dir="auto">The mainboard and ISA memory card are built and extensively tested.
The CPLD programs are verified and debugged, and latest versions are uploaded here in a single archive containing all the CPLD design projects and JED files.</p>
<p dir="auto">There is no Turbo function in the design, the CPU internal clock speed is verified at 16Mhz, tested for many hours.
Recommended a Harris 286 rated at 16Mhz. Higher speeds pending, waiting for further testing and verification.
When using sockets, please find tight fitting and reliable ones.
There is a lot of garbage being sold on the internet, stable contacts are a requirement of 16Mhz CPU clock operation.
If your system freezes, the most likely reason is a loose contact so re-insert all ICs.</p>

<p dir="auto">It is currently not recommended to add the RTL8019AS chip on the mainboard.
On my setup this created a lot of interference.
In fact I recommend a UMC UM9008 LAN card instead.
FTP transfer works most reliable when "putting" a large archive backup for example into the remote FTP server.
This allows to transfer gigabytes without any freeze.
For archiving and backups ARJ is recommended on this type of system.
If you want to play Doom, I highly recommend the Doom8088 project here at GitHub
Make sure to add enough RAM, for example 8 chips will make 4MB of RAM.
All RAM should be added in sequence, and will be automatically detected by the BIOS.
All RAM above 1MB is technically XMS memory (HIMEM.SYS) and DOS can be loaded into high memory.
128 KB of UMB blocks in segment D and E fully available for loading TSR drivers, needs UMB RAM clearing and UMB driver by Marco van Zwetselaar same as on XT PC.</p>
<p dir="auto">VGA card: recommended a Trident TVGA9000B card. Otherwise just test what you have.
Usually older and slower cards may not work at 16Mhz CPU clock.</p>
<p dir="auto">The DMA controllers operate at 5.33Mhz at 1/3 division from 16Mhz FDC clock, this is slightly over spec but with newer date DMA chips this seems fine. Tested and verified formatting and booting from floppy disks, using disk images to restore to floppy disk, all appears to function 100% reliably using this DMA clock speed. This can benefit games where sound data is loaded via DMA for example so the game routines experience less delays from loading the sound.</p>

<p dir="auto">I have replaced all the output system control signals previously coming from the 82284 and 82288 with my own custom logic.
So this makes the 82284 and 82288 chips no longer necessary for this project. This means that some level of rewiring is needed for the current PCB. I have done these upgrades in such a way that a minimal amount of wires will need to be added. Compared to the whole system it's not that much.
The System controller now receives the double clock frequency from an oscillator, and controls the CPU clock, CPU synchronization to the /RES input and system /RESET net.
All the system control is now generated by the System control CPLD by extensive state machine logic which I created. I was inspired after finding an article by Doug Kern of AMD in a documentation book full of applications for AMD programmable logic. So one of the example application was the replacement of the 82284 and 82288. Doug had created his own version of the 82284 and 82288 using a custom CPU cycle type. After a few brief tests using his method, I decided to design my own version of such logic. Basically I started from scratch, having only the datasheets of the 82284, 82288, and 80286 as a source of information. I have done many measurements and analysis of the system and the resulting design is my recreation. After seeing what Doug created using a state machine model of logic, I also decided to design my own state machine which facilitates very straight forward interpretation of the state bits in other logic areas. So the system controller now outputs all the system control signals, and we no longer need the 82284 and 82288. This upgrade also allows much faster logic to take over these functions inside the CPLDs.</p>

<p dir="auto">When working with CPU speeds of 20MHz and higher, it's no longer reliable to use ROM chips to initialize the system from. So I started work on a Shadow RAM system, encouraged by sqpat and dreNorteR on the VCF forums. Sqpat and dreNorteR gave me some sound advice on the assembly commands needed for shadow copying the BIOS and option ROM space into a shadow RAM area. I changed the RESET jump command to jump into my code, which then continues to jump into the BIOS INIT/POST entry point. Next I developed a system to switch the Shadow RAM into place after the copy is completed by writing to a memory location in the 0C0000 memory region. After testing this system, immediately I saw a big improvement in my 20MHz tests.</p>

<p dir="auto">The 74LS646 used in the IBM 5170 AT design is another part which needs substitution. So I proceeded to analyze and rewrite the logic of the 74LS646, specifically as used in the 5170 AT logic. The result is that the 74LS646 can be replaced by a single 74F245 transceiver and a 74F574 latch. I have tested this solution extensively and it now has the added advantage that the functions of the 74LS646 can now be replaced with much faster 74F type logic.</p>

<p dir="auto">I have done extensive testing with the RTC and CMOS RAM chip. In my tests, I achieved the most reliable results using a DS12885 chip, which I recommend using. The two jumpers next to the RTC need to be set accordingly for the DS12885 chip. Also, I suggest that no battery is really needed as long as you leave the ATX PSU on the power cable and the back power switch set to the ON position. The circuits on the mainboard will provide power to the RTC and RTC clock generator in order to advance the system clock and keep the CMOS settings. So there is no need to be working with potentially harmful batteries in the system if you prefer not to, as I also do.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Getting 20MHz to function reliably</h2><a id="user-content-getting-20mhz-to-function-reliably" aria-label="Permalink: Getting 20MHz to function reliably" href="#getting-20mhz-to-function-reliably"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Operating the system at 20MHz needs a few modifications:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Shadow RAM</li>
<li>CPU clock cycle control, meaning to manipulate the CPU clock for certain operations like reading the VGA BIOS, accessing the VGA RAM. These memory map areas are behind the VGA controller and thus this interpretation of memory causes some delays which needs adjustment of the cycles. I have created decoding which can also be expanded and upgraded to facilitate other areas of memory or I/O as needed to accommodate slower expansion cards or system chips.</li>
<li>extending the ALE signal, the ALE signal is normally of the same period length as one double CPU clock. However around 18MHz and above, this is simply getting too short for the address latches on the ISA slots to reliably store the address states for all the cycles. So this means that the ALE signal needs further enhancement. I have tried various mechanisms, and the best result was achieved by extending the ALE signal to start earlier at the CPU assertion of S1/S0 status signals, and to remain within the CPU state of T_STATUS. Using this method can extend the ALE signal long enough to reliably be able to catch the address states at 20MHz.</li>
<li>changing the logic type of many of the transceivers and latches in the system to speed up the bus.</li>
<li>At 20MHz, the System controller CPLD has difficulty terminating the cycles at 1 wait state, which results in skewing the cycle termination one cycle more than the logic is set to. Which is fine for I/O operations which are inherently slower than fast memory access. For speeding up the 16 bit memory access I have reduced the circuit to zero wait states. With the added wait state by frequency limits of the System controller, we now get a single wait state. This results in 13322 writes per millisecond using the "VIDSPEED.EXE *" test.</li>
<li>the option ROM is now no longer a separate ROM chip but included in the system BIOS ROM positions. The SA16 line needs to be wired to pin 1 on both these ROMS and the memory decoder in the 20MHz version is already updated to support this. The lower half of the ROM chips provides 32KB of option ROM space at 0C8000 - 0CFFFF. This allows for example XT-IDE ROM routines to run at fast 16 bit RAM speeds using the shadow RAM system. So the option ROM socket needs to be left empty and the ROMs replaced with fast types of 64KB flash ROM chips which support the standard DIP ROM pin locations.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Mostly the system now operates on 74F logic. Certain areas need HCT, ALS and HC logic.
20MHz Is really stretching the capabilities of the 10ns CPLDs. I am not sure how much higher the system could run, though I have been able to get into the MR BIOS menu at 25 MHz a few times. But that is far from a functional system. At 20MHz, in windows there is some minor graphics glitching going on, though it's nothing like freezing the system or causing resets. Other than some glitching, the system keeps running fine. In DOS the system is completely stable and I have not seen any problems running games or software in DOS.</p>

<p dir="auto">I should mention, building this system is an advanced work, not for novice builders. The designs need some understanding of the system in order to be able to do the modification wiring on the mainboard. You will need to know which signal goes where by looking at the quartus projects. Some signals are wired between the CPLDs which carry the same net names. I am working on a layout upgrade to include all the changes, which will eventually be released, however this is a lot of work because many areas of the PCB need to be reworked. Changing some of the logic also invites moving circuits around slightly, which will cost even more time than the modifications. I also decided to not include the RTL8019AS and the SCSI controller. The SCSI chips are too hard to find, and the RTL8019AS proved not a stable device on this system. Instead I decided to use a ISA card with a UMC9008AF network chip. I may decide to take an easier path and simply connect everything together in the new configuration, and just leaving some empty spaces on the board where chips were removed. Maybe it's not efficient, however the function of the system is the real goal that we want to achieve.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">What's next now?</h2><a id="user-content-whats-next-now" aria-label="Permalink: What's next now?" href="#whats-next-now"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Since we have a working AT concept system design, it's now possible to upgrade the core 5170 system concept into a 486 based AT PC design. I will attempt to first feature a 486DX type CPU and forcing it in 16 bit mode. This will make the transition later into a full 32 bit system more easy. So I am working on this concept now. This new design will feature one of more FPGAs for replacing much of the system logic, and to provide and control the system RAM memory. It's my intention to use the fastest affordable memory type which can hopefully support a very clock-efficient CPU function in the new design. The system will be featured using custom cards which fulfill certain functions. Such as a FPGA and memory card, a CPU card, and a core AT logic card. I also have ideas to design the system in such a way that also other solutions would be possible to form a system. Such as when a mainboard with chipset logic is badly damaged because of battery chemicals, someone could opt to move the chipset ICs onto a card and use that card to form a new ATX PC system. Basically it would be giving new life to the chipset ICs in a new design. These are just some of the research phase outlines of the next project, so due to alteration depending on what will be the best design method in my vision.</p>
<p dir="auto">I will continue my work in <a href="https://github.com/rodneyknaap/atx-486at-mainboard">a new project repository here on GitHub</a> which features research, development and design information for my next generation system.
This system will support at least the 286 CPU and the 486DX CPU, and later possibly others.</p>

<p>In the twisting vaults of a subway, metro, or U-Bahn, there’s often no reliable cell service, wifi, or GPS.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Which means you had no good way of keeping track of your stops or ETA when underground.</p>

<p>You had to look out the window for signs on the platform, listen for station announcements, or tilt your neck 90° to read one of those digital screens. How perfectly quaint!</p>



<p><strong>Here’s the bad news:</strong> we don’t have a hundred billion dollars to build ground-penetrating GPS satellites. <strong>The good news:</strong> we have Étienne, Ayser, Jonathan and Luc!</p>



<p>Thanks to our clever engineering, we can now predict your location in a subway tunnel using your phone’s vibration signature. Simply:</p>



<p>1. Start a trip with GO</p>

<h4><strong>Step 1: basic motion classification</strong></h4>



<p>Once you enter a train tunnel with bad GPS, the magic begins. First, we have to figure out where you are between stations. For that, we need to confirm that you’re on a moving train!</p>



<p>To get our bearings, let’s look at some accelerometer data from Stephen, the fastest-walking Transit employee, which he recorded on his phone during his commute to our Montreal office:</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" width="2000" height="830" data-attachment-id="14749" data-permalink="https://blog.transitapp.com/go-underground/phone-acceleration-during-a-commute-en/" data-orig-file="https://blog.transitapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Phone-acceleration-during-a-commute-EN.png" data-orig-size="2000,830" data-comments-opened="0" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="Phone acceleration during a commute EN" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://blog.transitapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Phone-acceleration-during-a-commute-EN-705x510.png" data-large-file="https://blog.transitapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Phone-acceleration-during-a-commute-EN.png" src="https://blog.transitapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Phone-acceleration-during-a-commute-EN.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.transitapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Phone-acceleration-during-a-commute-EN.png 2000w, https://blog.transitapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Phone-acceleration-during-a-commute-EN-768x319.png 768w, https://blog.transitapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Phone-acceleration-during-a-commute-EN-1536x637.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px"></figure>



<p>Fast but also meticulous, Stephen labeled the different parts of his trip, like:</p>



<ul>
<li>when he started walking</li>



<li>when he descended a set of stairs</li>



<li>when he was waiting on the platform</li>



<li>when the train started moving, when it stopped, etc.<br></li>
</ul>



<p>With inspiration from one of our <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_transform">favourite French mathematicians</a>, we can clean up Stephen’s acceleration data and turn it into frequency data, which can start to give us an idea about what’s happening on a moving train vs. elsewhere.</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" width="2000" height="800" data-attachment-id="14668" data-permalink="https://blog.transitapp.com/go-underground/frequencies-during-a-commute-4/" data-orig-file="https://blog.transitapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Frequencies-during-a-commute-5.png" data-orig-size="2000,800" data-comments-opened="0" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="Frequencies during a commute" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://blog.transitapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Frequencies-during-a-commute-5-705x510.png" data-large-file="https://blog.transitapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Frequencies-during-a-commute-5.png" src="https://blog.transitapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Frequencies-during-a-commute-5.png" alt="Spectrogram showing frequencies in hertz (Hz) during a trip in the subway, with the vertical axis indicating frequencies (0 to 12 Hz) and the horizontal axis showing the elapsed time in seconds.

<p>There’s a few clues. For one, when Stephen’s train is moving his phone vibrates at ~5 Hz, versus ~2 Hz when he’s walking. But the pattern isn’t clear-cut, with lots of random noise and harmonic frequencies (those fainter pink lines cascading above the more vivid red ones) muddying up the picture.</p>



<p>To definitively say “this is a moving train” vs. “this is not” we need to train a machine to classify motion types — a task which requires A LOT of training data.</p>



<hr>



<h4><strong>Step 2: gathering ground truth</strong></h4>



<p>We asked Stephen and his valiant colleagues to repeat the exercise: but now labeling data for hundreds of trips across dozens of cities, so that we could build a generalized model to say “yes! moving train!” regardless of the type of train or tracks being used.</p>



<p>Our trusty emissaries Étienne and Elijah were sent down from Montreal to collect vibration data on our app’s most popular underground system: the <a href="https://transitapp.com/en/region/nyc">New York City</a> subway.</p>

<p>Armed with iPhones, Androids, and MetroCards, they spent a week riding the MTA’s buses and trains, labeling each step of every trip:</p>

<p>We’d rely on their data for clues to distinguish between on-a-train vibrations vs. other vibrations in a train station.</p>



<p>Which meant Elijah and Étienne had to ride the escalators and elevators up and down for hours at a time, vigilantly annotating each time they stopped to catch their breath.</p>



<p>They eventually rode every subway line in New York, from the Bronx to Brighton Beach, across the Queensboro, Manhattan, and Williamsburg Bridges (where there is cell service) back through the rickety Canarsie Tunnel (where there is not).</p>



<hr>



<h4><strong>Step 3: training our motion classifier</strong></h4>



<p>After cleaning and processing our data, we could begin training our motion classifier to distinguish “moving train!” from “not moving train!”.</p>



<p>We start by feeding the model our unlabelled sensor data and ask it to randomly guess whether the phone is on a moving train, a stopped train, walking, going up an escalator, et cetera. We verify these guesses against our manual annotations (the “ground truth”) and add logic to guide our model to more accurate predictions.</p>



<p>After a great deal of tinkering, our model can now confidently predict if someone is on a moving train – or if their phone is just vibin’.</p>

<p>Now that we know when a rider is moving underground, the next step is to make that information useful: <strong>where, precisely, is their train?</strong></p>



<hr>



<h4><strong>Step 4: making a location prediction</strong></h4>



<p>It was time to add one last model to the mix, aptly named <strong><em>The Mixer.</em></strong></p>



<p>We trained this model to weigh…</p>



<ol>
<li>the motion type prediction<strong> </strong>(aka “is this a moving train?”)&nbsp;</li>



<li>the last-known location of the user</li>



<li>whether the last-known location came recently or a long time ago</li>



<li>the train schedule</li>
</ol>

<p>This is the holy grail of underground detection:<strong> since you can predict where a rider is, you can show them where they are on a map, update their ETA, and tell them when to get off at the right station.</strong></p>



<p>It’s a step up from the status quo method of detecting your location underground. No more relying on spotty GPS — or bobbing and weaving between incomprehensibly tall humans to read those digital screens!</p>

<p><strong>What’s even more wonderful? Our station counting works completely offline. </strong>Both of our models (the motion classifier, and the mixer) have been compressed into tiny files that run on your phone, without sending any data to Transit’s servers.</p>



<p>No tracking. No cookies. Your vibration data is your own damn business!</p>



<hr>



<h4><strong>Want to try out our underground detection for yourself?</strong></h4>



<p>Easy: just find yourself an underground train, open Transit, start a trip with GO, and watch the stations tick down, one-by-one! We’ve helped riders detect 1.5 million underground stations and ~400,000 trips during our initial tests.</p>



<p>GO’s step-by-step navigation was already being used by millions of aboveground riders in<a href="https://transitapp.com/en/region"> 600+ cities</a> — including folks propelled by bikes, since our launch of <a href="https://blog.transitapp.com/go-bike/">GO Bike</a> last month.</p>



<p>Now, their subterranean train-riding counterparts can rely on it more confidently in areas with bad service, so Transit can be their guiding light from end-to-end in every tunnel.</p>

<p>I tried everything but couldn’t turn this Raspberry Pi 5 into the World’s Fastest Pi 5. Unfortunately, we can’t quite claim that title … despite the software reporting 4 GHz.</p>

<h2><span id="Introduction"></span>Introduction<span></span></h2>



<p>We tried everything to make our Pi the fastest Pi in the world. That includes changing the operating system, subzero cooling with liquid nitrogen, boosting the power circuitry, and even swapping out the crystal oscillator.In this blog post I try to share some of the findings and insights from the several weeks of Pi hacking in collaboration with ElmorLabs. </p>



<p>Let’s start where we left off: in <a href="https://skatterbencher.com/2024/07/18/skatterbencher-77-raspberry-pi-5-overclocked-to-3000-mhz/">SkatterBencher #77</a> I overclocked the Raspberry Pi 5 to 3 GHz with a slightly improved air cooler. It appears that the PMIC voltage controller is a key limiting factor for achieving higher frequencies. Not only does the PMIC impose voltage configuration limitations but we also saw the Pi shut down at high power consumption levels.</p>

<p>Therefore, I decided to beef up the power circuitry using the ElmorLabs AMPLE-X1. But I’ll get back to that later, because the first concern for maximizing performance is the operating system.</p>



<h2><span id="Raspberry_Pi_OS_NUMA_Patch"></span>Raspberry Pi OS + NUMA Patch<span></span></h2>



<p>In preparation for the record attempt, it’s important to prepare the operating system first. Coming from Ubuntu in my SkatterBencher guide, there’s two things we can improve:</p>



<ol>
<li>Change to the official Raspberry Pi OS, and</li>



<li>Apply the NUMA patch</li>
</ol>



<p>The official Raspberry Pi operating system can easily be <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/operating-systems/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">downloaded from the website</a>. Alternatively, you can also use the Raspberry Pi Imager software which does all the hard work for you.</p>

<p>I first learned about the <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/raspberry-pi/raspberry-pi-5-patch-boosts-performance-up-to-18-via-numa-emulation-geekbench-tests-reveal-gains-in-both-single-and-multi-threaded-performance" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">NUMA patch</a> when discussing Raspberry Pi overclocking on the Tom’s Hardware Guide <a href="https://skatterbencher.com/2024/06/28/talking-raspberry-pi-5-overclocking-on-the-pi-cast-181/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Pi Cast #181</a> a couple of months ago. It boils down to this: <a href="https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20240625125803.38038-1-tursulin@igalia.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">NUMA emulation</a> enables the BCM2721 memory controller to better utilize parallelism in physical memory chip organization.</p>



<p>I followed <a href="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2024/numa-emulation-speeds-pi-5-and-other-improvements">Jeff Geerling’s guide</a> on enabling the NUMA patch. Combining the Raspberry Pi operating system and applying the NUMA emulation patch improved the benchmark performance significantly.</p>

<h2><span id="Liquid_Nitrogen_Cooling"></span>Liquid Nitrogen Cooling<span></span></h2>



<p>The next step of preparing the Raspberry Pi for higher voltages and frequencies is ensuring we have superior cooling. Preferably, extreme cooling like liquid nitrogen. The place to be for liquid nitrogen testing in Taipei, Taiwan, is of course the <a href="https://elmorlabs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ElmorLabs</a> office.</p>



<p>The Raspberry Pi 5 has a small-footprint PCB with quite a lot of tall components spread around the PCB. So, we can’t use a regular container like our AI LN2 container or the ElmorLabs Volcano. However, we found this tiny chipset LN2 pot. This container is heavy enough that it can just sit on top of the SoC and provide enough cooling even at ambient. After all, the SoC is barely using any power.</p>

<p>I first ran Geekbench at 3200 MHz as a performance sanity check and <a href="https://browser.geekbench.com/v6/cpu/7600778" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">I achieved</a> 1000 in single-core and 2000 in multi-core in for the first time.</p>



<p>Then, I tried increasing the operating frequency with low ambient temperatures of 20 degrees Celsius. However, as you can see, with ambient temperatures I could only set the clock to 3600 MHz. Once I tried 3700 MHz the Pi would lock up.</p>

<p>Reducing the temperature to minus 40 degrees resulted in the same type of crash: the Pi just locks up at 3.7 GHz. Strange! I also hooked up the ElmorLabs EVC2 to talk to the Renesas PMIC directly and elevate every voltage rail. However, none of them seemed to have any impact on the maximum clock frequency.</p>



<p>For those interested: the Raspberry Pi 5 only starts having operating problems around -90 degrees Celsius. Not bad at all!</p>

<p>Hitting a frequency wall at any temperature is &nbsp;rather odd behavior because any modern SoCs should normally scale with both temperature and voltage, unless there’s an external bottleneck imposing a limit. But the lack of temperature scaling suggests that perhaps there would also be a lack of voltage scaling.</p>



<p>But, there’s only one way to find out!</p>



<h2><span id="Raspberry_Pi_%E2%80%9CAmplified%E2%80%9D"></span>Raspberry Pi “Amplified”<span></span></h2>



<p>In the <a href="https://skatterbencher.com/2024/07/18/skatterbencher-77-raspberry-pi-5-overclocked-to-3000-mhz/">SkatterBencher guide</a>, I mention that the Raspberry Pi is shutting down in high load scenarios which use the NEON instructions.</p>



<blockquote>
<p><em>“If we have a closer look at the PassMark benchmark, we find that the benchmark crashes specifically at the NEON sub-test. […] If we track the current, voltage, and power of the VDD_core during the workload, we find that the NEON subtest is significantly more power-intensive than any other benchmark. We can see peak current exceeding 15 amps and the power consumption exceeding 18 watts.</em></p>



<p><em>When the benchmark crashes, the Raspberry Pi shuts down, and we can’t even communicate with the PMIC unless we manually press the power button. This suggests the instability is not caused by too high frequency, but perhaps some other mechanism such as over-current or over-temperature protection. Based on the voltage telemetry provided by the Python script, it doesn’t seem like it’s an under-volt issue. However, unfortunately, the PMIC debug options are not available at the moment.”</em></p>

<p>To address this problem – as well as the 1.2V voltage limit – we need to beef up the power circuit. And, once again, ElmorLabs comes to the rescue with the Ample-X1 Power Card.</p>



<h3><span id="ElmorLabs_AMPLE-X1"></span>ElmorLabs AMPLE-X1<span></span></h3>



<p>The <a href="https://www.elmorlabs.com/product/elmorlabs-ample-x1-power-card/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ElmorLabs AMPLE-X1</a> is a power card that uses a single-phase step-down buck converter. It is optimized for operating from a 12V power supply but can work with down to 4.5V input. It achieves up to 91.7% efficiency and the parameters can be monitored and controlled digitally by connecting it to EVC2.</p>



<p>To hook up the AMPLE-X1 to the Raspberry Pi 5, we need to perform some hard-to-reverse and definitely-warranty-voiding modifications.</p>



<ol>
<li>Remove the inductors of the 4-phase SoC to disconnect the PMIC from the SoC.</li>



<li>Scratch off the PCB mask to expose more of the copper plane for Vcc and Gnd.</li>



<li>Solder thick, short wires between the Raspberry Pi and the AMPLE-X1.</li>



<li>Make sure the AMPLE-X1 is set by default around 1.0V (it can provide up to 5.0V!)</li>
</ol>

<p>Once that’s done, it’s time to try if the Pi still boots up. This is not guaranteed because sometimes the SoC has two-way communication with the PMIC to ensure correct bootup procedure. Luckily, it works. The important step is to turn on the AMPLE-X1 power to the SoC before connecting the USB Type-C to power the other rails and initiate bootup.</p>

<p>Now, we can use the <a href="https://elmorlabs.com/product/elmorlabs-evc2se/">ElmorLabs EVC2</a> to adjust the output voltage as well as monitor the output current and power. You can use the EVC2 on a secondary system, like a Windows laptop, or use the unofficial Linux package available for download from the ElmorLabs discord here: <a href="https://discord.com/channels/514312075686838282/830630797962641468/1204348733249159218" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://discord.com/channels/514312075686838282/830630797962641468/1204348733249159218</a> (<a href="https://cdn.skatterbencher.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/EVC2_1.0.1.18_Linux.zip" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">backup</a>).</p>



<p>Here’s an example of the AMPLE-X1 peaking at 25.5W during a Passmark run.</p>

<p>With the beefed-up power circuit, we can now increase the voltage to get higher frequency. We tried increasing the voltage from 1.2V all the way up to 1.55V. Unfortunately, we didn’t achieve a single additional step of MHz. This is, unfortunately, aligns with the lack of temperature scaling.</p>



<p>But why?</p>



<h2><span id="Crystal_Oscillator"></span>Crystal Oscillator<span></span></h2>



<p>There are many reasons why the SoC frequency wouldn’t scale with temperature or voltage. For example, it could be a PLL locking problem like we’ve seen with <a href="https://skatterbencher.com/2023/08/23/5800-mhz-intel-tiger-lake-with-liquid-nitrogen/">Intel Tiger Lake</a>. Or it could be that a specific IP block linked to the Arm cores is also getting overclocked. Or, it could be a specific PLL ratio being unstable.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, most of these issues are hard to debug without the proper development tools. However, we can try one last thing to see if maybe the Arm core PLL is causing issues: swapping out the crystal oscillator. The idea is simple: we swap the fixed crystal oscillator with a variable oscillator. That allows us to change the PLL ratio for frequencies exceeding 3.6 GHz.</p>



<h3><span id="ElmorLabs_ECB"></span>ElmorLabs ECB<span></span></h3>



<p>The default clock crystal is a 54MHz crystal which is on the backside of the PCB. It can be removed with some heat. Next, we replace it with the <a href="https://elmorlabs.com/product/elmorlabs-ecb-external-clock-board/">ElmorLabs External Clock Board</a>. Now, we can adjust the input clock lower or higher than the default 54 MHz.</p>

<p>Upwards, we immediately ran into a limitation of around 56 MHz. However, downwards adjustment was much easier, and the Raspberry Pi 5 could go as low as 46 MHz.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.skatterbencher.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/el_ecb_46mhz-png.webp" data-slb-active="1" data-slb-asset="933138521" data-slb-group="8837"><img data-od-xpath="/*[1][self::HTML]/*[2][self::BODY]/*[2][self::DIV]/*[2][self::DIV]/*[1][self::DIV]/*[1][self::MAIN]/*[1][self::DIV]/*[1][self::DIV]/*[1][self::DIV]/*[1][self::ARTICLE]/*[1][self::DIV]/*[57][self::FIGURE]/*[1][self::A]/*[1][self::IMG]" data-dominant-color="7f797a" data-has-transparency="false" loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="https://cdn.skatterbencher.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/el_ecb_46mhz-1024x576.webp" alt="elmorlabs ecb at 46 mhz" srcset="https://cdn.skatterbencher.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/el_ecb_46mhz-1024x576.webp 1024w, https://cdn.skatterbencher.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/el_ecb_46mhz-300x169.webp 300w, https://cdn.skatterbencher.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/el_ecb_46mhz-768x432.webp 768w, https://cdn.skatterbencher.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/el_ecb_46mhz-1536x864.webp 1536w, https://cdn.skatterbencher.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/el_ecb_46mhz-png.webp 1920w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></figure>



<p>With 46 MHz, we can set the Arm frequency to 4000 MHz. As you can see, the Broadcom vcgencmd tool also reports as 4 GHz. But of course, the real frequency is much lower because the crystal oscillator reference clock is lower. The actual frequency is 4,000 / 54 x 46 = 3,407 MHz.</p>

<p>Again, we run into the same frequency wall as we saw with temperature and voltage adjustments: about 3.4 GHz for benchmarks and 3.6 GHz as maximum configurable frequency.</p>



<p>Oh, I did try to run Geekbench at the fake 4 GHz and, good news, it was able to catch the result isn’t legitimate. Great job!</p>

<h2><span id="Conclusive_Thoughts"></span>Conclusive Thoughts<span></span></h2>



<p>So, that’s basically it … we’ve tried everything we could reasonably come up with to push the Raspberry Pi 5 to 4 GHz. But despite the much lower temperatures, much higher voltages, and even a different crystal oscillator … 3.6 GHz is the highest possible frequency.</p>



<p>But all things considered, I’m still very happy to have put in the time and effort to learn about Raspberry Pi overclocking. It gave me the opportunity to learn more about Linux and ARM, as well as pursue really advanced hardware modifications. I see this experience as a pivotal work forming a foundation for future experiments.</p>



<p>I want to thank Jon from ElmorLabs for all the help and tools provided for this overclocking experiment. Without his help, this project would not have been possible!</p>



<p>I thank you for reading and <a href="https://www.patreon.com/skatterbencher">the Patreons</a> for the support. If you have any questions or comments, please drop them in the comment section below.&nbsp;</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="block-jeffgeerling-system-main">
          
<article>

  

      
  
  <div><p>I had to pause some of my work getting <a href="https://github.com/geerlingguy/raspberry-pi-pcie-devices/issues/680">a current-gen AMD graphics card running on the Pi 5</a> and <a href="https://github.com/geerlingguy/sbc-reviews/issues/52">testing a 192-core AmpereOne server</a> to quickly post on the M4's efficiency.</p>

<p><img width="700" height="auto" src="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/sites/default/files/images/m4-mac-mini-on-desk.jpg" alt="M4 Mac mini on desk"></p>

<p>I expected M4 to be better than M1/M2 (I haven't personally tested M3), and I hoped it would at least match the previous total-system-power efficiency king, a tiny arm SBC with an RK3588 SoC... but I didn't expect it to jump forward <em>32%</em>. Efficiency gains on the Arm systems I test typically look like 2-5% year over year.</p>

<p>The M4 mini I just bought reaches <strong>6.74 Gflops/W</strong> on the HPL benchmark.</p>

<p>I can get 283 Gflops at 42W, versus 264 at 66W on my M1 Max Mac Studio (for a round 4.00 Gflops/W).</p>

<p>The chip isn't the <em>fastest</em> at everything, but it's certainly the most <em>efficient</em> CPU I've ever tested. And that scales down to idle power, too—it hovers between 3-4W at idle—which is about the same as a <em>Raspberry Pi</em>.</p>

<p>This is total system power draw, too—not just the CPU.</p>

<p>And the system I bought includes 10 Gigabit Ethernet and 32 GB of RAM; most systems I've used consume 4-6W just <em>running the 10 GbE controller</em>!</p>

<p>In <a href="https://www.myelectronics.nl/us/19-inch-125u-rack-mount-for-3x-mac-mini-2024.html">1.25U of rack space</a>, you could run three Mac minis, idling around 10W, giving almost a teraflop of CPU performance. (Not to mention there's a fast GPU/NPU, 10 GbE, and tons of high speed Thunderbolt IO in the back.)</p>

<p><em>If only they didn't put the power button on the bottom.</em></p>

<p>You can check out all my <a href="https://github.com/geerlingguy/top500-benchmark">top500-benchmark results</a> on GitHub, and follow my progress <a href="https://github.com/geerlingguy/sbc-reviews/issues/57">testing out the M4 mini here</a>.</p>

<p>I haven't tested an M4 Pro Mac mini yet, so I'm not sure if the efficiency is any better or worse.</p></div>

Which will probably take as long as it took to actually write the book. You can see the release notes on the leanpub page.</p>
<p>And I've got a snazzy new cover:</p>

<p>(I don't actually like the cover that much but it <em>looks</em> official enough until I can pay an actual cover designer.)</p>
<h2>"Five" Unusual Raku Features</h2>
<p>Last year I started learning Raku, and the sheer bizarreness of the language left me describing it as <a href="https://buttondown.com/hillelwayne/archive/raku-a-language-for-gremlins/" target="_blank">a language for gremlins</a>. Now that I've used it in anger for over a year, I have a better way of describing it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Raku is a laboratory for language features.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is why it has <a href="https://docs.raku.org/language/concurrency" target="_blank">five different models of concurrency</a> and eighteen ways of doing anything else, because the point is to <em>see</em> what happens. It also explains why many of the features interact so strangely and why there's all that odd edge-case behavior. Getting 100 experiments polished and playing nicely with each other is much harder than running 100 experiments; we can sort out the polish <em>after</em> we figure out which ideas are good ones.</p>
<p>So here are "five" Raku experiments you could imagine seeing in another programming language. If you squint.</p>
<h3><a href="https://docs.raku.org/type/Junction" target="_blank">Junctions</a></h3>
<p>Junctions are "superpositions of possible values". Applying an operation to a junction instead applies it to every value inside the junction.  </p>
<div><pre><span></span><code>&gt; <span>2</span><span>|</span><span>10</span>
<span>any</span>(<span>2</span>, <span>10</span>)

&gt; <span>2</span><span>&amp;10</span> + <span>3</span>
<span>all</span>(<span>5</span>, <span>13</span>)

&gt;(<span>1</span><span>&amp;2</span>) + (<span>10</span><span>^</span><span>20</span>)
<span>all</span>(<span>one</span>(<span>11</span>, <span>21</span>), <span>one</span>(<span>12</span>, <span>22</span>))
</code></pre></div>
<p>As you can probably tell from the <code>all</code>s and <code>any</code>s, junctions are a feature meant for representing boolean formula. There's no way to destructure a junction, and the only way to use it is to collapse it to a boolean first.</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code>&gt; (<span>1</span><span>&amp;2</span>) + (<span>10</span><span>^</span><span>20</span>) &lt; <span>15</span>
<span>all</span>(<span>one</span>(<span>True</span>, <span>False</span>), <span>one</span>(<span>True</span>, <span>False</span>))

<span># so coerces junctions to booleans</span>
&gt; <span>so</span> (<span>1</span><span>&amp;2</span>) + (<span>10</span><span>^</span><span>20</span>) &lt; <span>15</span>
<span>True</span>

&gt; <span>so</span> (<span>1</span><span>&amp;2</span>) + (<span>10</span><span>^</span><span>20</span>) &gt; <span>0</span>
<span>False</span>

&gt; <span>16</span> %% (<span>3</span><span>&amp;5</span>) ?? <span>"fizzbuzz"</span> !! *
*
</code></pre></div>
<p>The real interesting thing for me is how Raku elegantly uses junctions to represent quantifiers. In most languages, you either have the function <code>all(list[T], T -&gt; bool)</code> or the method <code>[T].all(T -&gt; bool)</code>, both of which apply the test to every element of the list. In Raku, though, <code>list.all</code> doesn't take <em>anything</em>, it's just a niladic method that turns the list into a junction. </p>
<div><pre><span></span><code>&gt; <span>my</span> <span>$x</span> = <span>&lt;1 2 3&gt;</span>.<span>all</span>
<span>all</span>(<span>1</span>, <span>2</span>, <span>3</span>)
&gt; <span>is-prime</span>(<span>$x</span>)
<span>all</span>(<span>False</span>, <span>True</span>, <span>True</span>)
</code></pre></div>
<p>This means we can combine junctions. If Raku didn't already have a <code>unique</code> method, we could build it by saying "are all elements equal to exactly one element?"</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code>&gt; <span>so</span> {.<span>all</span> == .<span>one</span>}(<span>&lt;1 2 3 7&gt;</span>)
<span>True</span>

&gt; <span>so</span> {.<span>all</span> == .<span>one</span>}(<span>&lt;1 2 3 7 2&gt;</span>)
<span>False</span>
</code></pre></div>
<h3><a href="https://docs.raku.org/type/Whatever" target="_blank">Whatevers</a></h3>
<p><code>*</code> is the "whatever" symbol and has a lot of different roles in Raku.<sup id="fnref:analogs"><a href="#fn:analogs">1</a></sup> Some functions and operators have special behavior when passed a <code>*</code>. In a range or sequence, <code>*</code> means "unbound".</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code>&gt; <span>1</span>..*
<span>1</span><span>..</span><span>Inf</span>

&gt; (<span>2</span>,<span>4</span>,<span>8</span>...*)[<span>17</span>]
<span>262144</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>The main built-in use, though, is that expressions with <code>*</code> are lifted into anonymous functions. This is called "whatever-priming" and produces a <code>WhateverCode</code>, which is indistinguishable from other functions except for the type.</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code>&gt; {<span>$_</span> + <span>10</span>}(<span>2</span>)
<span>12</span>

&gt; (* + <span>10</span>)(<span>2</span>)
<span>12</span>

&gt; (^<span>10</span>).<span>map</span>(* % <span>2</span>)
(<span>0</span> <span>1</span> <span>0</span> <span>1</span> <span>0</span> <span>1</span> <span>0</span> <span>1</span> <span>0</span> <span>1</span>)
</code></pre></div>
<p>There's actually a bit of weird behavior here: if <em>two</em> whatevers appear in the expression, they become separate positional variables. <code>(2, 30, 4, 50).map(* + *)</code> returns <code>(32, 45)</code>. This makes it easy to express <a href="https://docs.raku.org/language/operators#infix_..." target="_blank">a tricky Fibonacci definition</a> but otherwise I don't see how it's better than making each <code>*</code> the same value.</p>
<p>Regardless, priming is useful because <em>so many</em> Raku methods are overloaded to take functions. You get the last element of a list with <code>l[*-1]</code>. This <em>looks</em> like standard negative-index syntax, but what actually happens is that when <code>[]</code> is passed a function, it passes in list length and looks up the result. So if the list has 10 elements, <code>l[*-1] = l[10-1] = l[9]</code>, aka the last element. Similarly, <code>l.head(2)</code> is the first two elements of a list, <code>l.head(*-2)</code> is all-but-the-last-two.</p>
<p>We can pass other functions to <code>[]</code>, which e.g. makes implementing ring buffers easy.</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code>&gt; <span>my</span> <span>@x</span> = ^<span>10</span>
[<span>0</span> <span>1</span> <span>2</span> <span>3</span> <span>4</span> <span>5</span> <span>6</span> <span>7</span> <span>8</span> <span>9</span>]

&gt; <span>@x</span>[<span>95</span> % *]--; <span>@x</span>
[<span>0</span> <span>1</span> <span>2</span> <span>3</span> <span>4</span> <span>4</span> <span>6</span> <span>7</span> <span>8</span> <span>9</span>]
</code></pre></div>
<h3><a href="https://docs.raku.org/language/regexes" target="_blank">Regular Expressions</a></h3>
<p>There are two basic standards for regexes: POSIX regexes and Perl-compatible regexes (PCRE). POSIX regexes are a terrible mess of backslashes and punctuation. PCRE is backwards compatible with POSIX and is a more terrible mess of backslashes and punctuation. Most languages follow the PCRE standard, but Perl 6 breaks backwards compatibility with an entirely new regex syntax. </p>
<p>The most obvious improvement: <a href="https://docs.raku.org/language/regexes#Subrules" target="_blank">composability</a>. In most languages  "combine" two regexes by concating their strings together, which is terrible for many, many reasons. Raku has the standard "embed another regex" syntax: <code>/&lt; foo &gt;+/</code> matches one-or-more of the <code>foo</code> regex without <code>foo</code> "leaking" into the top regex. </p>
<p>This already does a lot to make regexes more tractable: you can break a complicated regular expression down into simpler and more legible parts. And in fact this is how Raku supports <a href="https://docs.raku.org/language/grammars" target="_blank">parsing grammars</a> as a builtin language feature. I've only used grammars once but it <a href="https://www.hillelwayne.com/post/picat/" target="_blank">was quite helpful</a>.</p>
<p>Since we're breaking backwards compatibility anyway, we can now add lots of small QOLs. There's a <a href="https://docs.raku.org/language/regexes#Modified_quantifier:_%,_%%" target="_blank">value separator</a> modifier: <code>\d+ % ','</code> matches <code>1</code> / <code>1,2</code> / <code>1,1,4</code> but not <code>1,</code> or <code>12</code>. <a href="https://docs.raku.org/language/regexes#Lookaround_assertions" target="_blank">Lookaheads</a> and non-capturing groups aren't nonsense glyphs. <code>r1 &amp;&amp; r2</code> only matches strings that match <em>both</em> <code>r1</code> and <code>r2</code>. Backtracking can be stopped with <a href="https://docs.raku.org/language/regexes#Preventing_backtracking:_:" target="_blank">:</a>. Whitespace is ignored by default and has to be explicitly enabled in match patterns.</p>
<p>There's more stuff Raku does with actually <em>processing</em> regular expressions, but the regex notation is something that might actually appear in another language someday. </p>

<h3><a href="https://docs.raku.org/language/operators#Hyper_operators" target="_blank">Hyperoperators</a></h3>
<p>This is a small one compared to the other features, but it's also the thing I miss most often in other languages. The most basic form <code>l&gt;&gt;.method</code> is basically equivalent to <code>map</code>, except it also recursively descends into sublists.</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code>&gt; [<span>1</span>, [<span>2</span>, <span>3</span>], <span>4</span>]&gt;&gt;.<span>succ</span>
[<span>2</span> [<span>3</span> <span>4</span>] <span>5</span>]
</code></pre></div>
<p>This is more useful than it looks because any function call <code>f(list, *args)</code> can be rewritten in "method form" <code>list.&amp;f(*args)</code>, so <code>&gt;&gt;.</code> becomes the generalized mapping operator. You can use it with whatevers, too.</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code>&gt; [<span>1</span>, [<span>2</span>, <span>3</span>], <span>4</span>]&gt;&gt;.&amp;(*+<span>1</span>)
[<span>2</span> [<span>3</span> <span>4</span>] <span>5</span>]
</code></pre></div>
<p>Anyway, the more generalized <em>binary</em> hyperoperator <code>l1 &lt;&lt; op &gt;&gt; l2</code><sup id="fnref:spaces"><a href="#fn:spaces">2</a></sup> applies <code>op</code> elementwise to the two lists, looping the shorter list until the longer list is exhausted. <code>&gt;&gt;op&gt;&gt;</code> / <code>&lt;&lt; op&lt;&lt;</code> are the same except they instead loop until the lhs/rhs list is exhausted. Whew!</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code>&gt; [<span>1</span>, <span>2</span>, <span>3</span>, <span>4</span>, <span>5</span>] <span>&lt;&lt;+&gt;</span>&gt; [<span>10</span>, <span>20</span>]
[<span>11</span> <span>22</span> <span>13</span> <span>24</span> <span>15</span>]

&gt; [<span>1</span>, <span>2</span>, <span>3</span>, <span>4</span>, <span>5</span>] <span>&lt;&lt;+&lt;&lt; [10, 20]</span>
<span>[11 22]</span>

<span>&gt; [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] &gt;&gt;</span>+&gt;&gt; [<span>10</span>, <span>20</span>]
[<span>11</span> <span>22</span> <span>13</span> <span>24</span> <span>15</span>]

<span># Also works with single values</span>
&gt; [<span>1</span>, <span>2</span>, <span>3</span>, <span>4</span>, <span>5</span>] <span>&lt;&lt;+&gt;</span>&gt; <span>10</span>
[<span>11</span> <span>12</span> <span>13</span> <span>14</span> <span>15</span>]

<span># Does weird things with nested lists too</span>
&gt; [<span>1</span>, [<span>2</span>, <span>3</span>], <span>4</span>, <span>5</span>] <span>&lt;&lt;+&gt;</span>&gt; [<span>10</span>, <span>20</span>]
[<span>11</span> [<span>22</span> <span>23</span>] <span>14</span> <span>25</span>]
</code></pre></div>
<p>Also for some reason the hyperoperators have separate behaviors on two hashes, either applying <code>op</code> to the union/intersection/hash difference. </p>
<p>Anyway it's a super weird (meta)operator but it's also quite useful! It's the closest thing I've seen to <a href="https://hillelwayne.com/post/j-notation/" target="_blank">J verbs</a> outside an APL. I like using it to run the same formula on multiple possible inputs at once.</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code>(<span>20</span> * <span>10</span> <span>&lt;&lt;-&gt;</span>&gt; (<span>21</span>, <span>24</span>)) <span>&lt;&lt;*&gt;</span>&gt; (<span>10</span>, <span>100</span>)
(<span>1790</span> <span>17600</span>)
</code></pre></div>
<p>Incidentally, it's called the hyperoperator because it evaluates all of the operations in parallel. Explicit loops can be parallelized by prefixing them with <a href="https://docs.raku.org/language/statement-prefixes#hyper,_race" target="_blank"><code>hyper</code></a>.</p>
<h3><a href="https://docs.raku.org/type/Pair" target="_blank">Pair Syntax</a></h3>
<p>I've talked about pairs a little in <a href="https://buttondown.com/hillelwayne/archive/unusual-basis-types-in-programming-languages/" target="_blank">this newsletter</a>, but the gist is that Raku hashes are composed of a set of pairs <code>key =&gt; value</code>. The pair is the basis type, the hash is the collection of pairs. There's also a <em>ton</em> of syntactic sugar for concisely specifying pairs via "colon syntax":</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code>&gt; <span>my</span> <span>$x</span> = <span>3</span>; :<span>$x</span>
<span>x</span> =&gt; <span>3</span>

&gt; :<span>a</span><span>&lt;$x&gt;</span>
<span>a</span> =&gt; <span>"$x"</span>

&gt; :<span>a</span>(<span>$x</span>)
<span>a</span> =&gt; <span>3</span>

&gt; :<span>3</span><span>a</span>
<span>a</span> =&gt; <span>3</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>The most important sugars are <code>:key</code> and <code>:!key</code>, which map to <code>key =&gt; True</code> and <code>key =&gt; False</code>. This is a really elegant way to add flags to a methods! Take the definition of <a href="https://docs.raku.org/type/Str#method_match" target="_blank">match</a>:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>method</span> <span>match</span>(<span>$pat</span>, 
    :<span>continue</span>(:<span>$c</span>), :<span>pos</span>(:<span>$p</span>), :<span>global</span>(:<span>$g</span>), 
    :<span>overlap</span>(:<span>$ov</span>), :<span>exhaustive</span>(:<span>$ex</span>),

</code></pre></div>
<p>Probably should also mention that in a definition, <code>:f(:$foo)</code> defines the parameter <code>$foo</code> but <a href="https://docs.raku.org/language/signatures#Argument_aliases" target="_blank">also aliases it</a> to <code>:f</code>, so you can set the flag with <code>:f</code> or <code>:foo</code>. Colon-pairs defined in the signature can be passed in anywhere, or even stuck together:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code>&gt; <span>"abab"</span>.<span>match</span>(<span>/../</span>)
｢<span>ab</span>｣
&gt; <span>"abab"</span>.<span>match</span>(<span>/../</span>, :<span>g</span>)
(｢<span>ab</span>｣ ｢<span>ab</span>｣)
&gt; <span>"abab"</span>.<span>match</span>(<span>/../</span>, :<span>g</span>, :<span>ov</span>)
(｢<span>ab</span>｣ ｢<span>ba</span>｣ ｢<span>ab</span>｣)

<span># Out of order stuck together</span>
&gt; <span>"abab"</span>.<span>match</span>(:<span>g:ov</span>,<span> /../</span>)
(｢<span>ab</span>｣ ｢<span>ba</span>｣ ｢<span>ab</span>｣)
</code></pre></div>
<p>So that leads to extremely concise method configuration. Definitely beats <code>match(global=True, overlap=True)</code>!</p>
<p>And for some reason you can place keyword arguments <em>after</em> the function call:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code>&gt; <span>"abab"</span>.<span>match</span>(:<span>g</span>,<span> /../</span>):<span>ov:2nd</span>
｢<span>ba</span>｣
</code></pre></div>
<h2>The next-gen lab: Slangs and RakuAST</h2>
<p>These are features I have no experience in and <em>certainly</em> are not making their way into other languages, but they really expand the explorable space of new features. <a href="https://raku.land/zef:lizmat/Slangify" target="_blank">Slangs</a> are modifications to the Raku syntax. This can be used for things like <a href="https://raku.land/zef:elcaro/Slang::Otherwise" target="_blank">modifying loop syntax</a>, <a href="https://raku.land/zef:raku-community-modules/Slang::Piersing" target="_blank">changing identifiers</a>, or adding <a href="https://raku.land/zef:raku-community-modules/OO::Actors" target="_blank">actors</a> or <a href="https://raku.land/github:MattOates/BioInfo" target="_blank">DNA sequences</a> to the base language.</p>
<p>I <em>barely</em> understand <a href="https://dev.to/lizmat/rakuast-for-early-adopters-576n" target="_blank">RakuAST</a>. I <em>think</em> the idea is that all Raku expressions can be parsed as an AST from inside Raku itself.</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code>&gt; <span>Q/my $x; $x++/</span>.<span>AST</span>
<span>RakuAST::StatementList</span>.<span>new</span>(
  <span>RakuAST::Statement::Expression</span>.<span>new</span>(
    <span>expression</span> =&gt; <span>RakuAST::VarDeclaration::Simple</span>.<span>new</span>(
      <span>sigil</span>       =&gt; <span>"\$"</span>,
      <span>desigilname</span> =&gt; <span>RakuAST::Name</span>.<span>from-identifier</span>(<span>"x"</span>)
    )
  ),
  <span>RakuAST::Statement::Expression</span>.<span>new</span>(
    <span>expression</span> =&gt; <span>RakuAST::ApplyPostfix</span>.<span>new</span>(
      <span>operand</span> =&gt; <span>RakuAST::Var::Lexical</span>.<span>new</span>(<span>"\$x"</span>),
      <span>postfix</span> =&gt; <span>RakuAST::Postfix</span>.<span>new</span>(<span>"++"</span>)
    )
  )
)
</code></pre></div>
<p>This allows for things like writing Raku in different languages:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>say</span> <span>Q/my $x; put $x/</span>.<span>AST</span>.<span>DEPARSE</span>(<span>"NL"</span>)
<span>mijn</span> <span>$x</span>;
<span>zeg-het</span> <span>$x</span>
</code></pre></div>
<h3>Bonus experiment</h3>
<p>Raku comes with a "<a href="https://rakudo.org/star" target="_blank">Rakudo Star</a>" installation, which comes with a set of <a href="https://github.com/rakudo/star/blob/master/etc/modules.txt" target="_blank">blessed third party modules</a> preinstalled. I love this! It's a great compromise between the maintainer burdens of a large standard library and the user burdens of making everybody find the right packages in the ecosystem.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Blog Rec</h2>
<p>Feel obligated to recommend some Raku blogs! Elizabeth Mattijsen posts <a href="https://dev.to/lizmat" target="_blank">a ton of stuff</a> to dev.to about Raku internals. <a href="https://www.codesections.com/blog/" target="_blank">Codesections</a> has a pretty good blog; he's the person who eventually got me to try out Raku. Finally, the <a href="https://raku-advent.blog/" target="_blank">Raku Advent Calendar</a> is a great dive into advanced Raku techniques. Bad news is it only updates once a year, good news is it's 25 updates that once a year.</p>

          <p>Spotify has lost all enthusiasm for the little music devices it sold for just half a year. Firmware hackers, as usually happens, have a lot more interest and have stepped in to save, and upgrade, a potentially useful gadget.</p>
<p>Spotify's idea a couple years ago was a car-focused device for those who lacked Apple CarPlay, Android Auto, or built-in Spotify support in their vehicles, or just wanted a dedicated Spotify screen. The <a href="https://carthing.spotify.com/">Car Thing</a> was a $100 doodad with a 4-inch touchscreen and knob that attached to the dashboard (or into a CD slot drive). All it could do was play Spotify, and only if you were a paying member, but that could be an upgrade for owners of older cars, or people who wanted a little desktop music controller.</p>
<p>But less than half a year after it fully released its first hardware device, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/05/pleas-for-open-sourcing-refunds-as-spotify-plans-to-brick-car-thing-devices/">Spotify gave up on the Car Thing</a>&nbsp;due to "several factors, including product demand and supply chain issues." A Spotify rep told Ars that the Car Thing was meant "to learn more about how people listen in the car," and now it was "time to say goodbye to the devices entirely." Spotify indicated&nbsp;<a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/05/spotify-wont-open-source-car-thing-but-starts-refund-process/">it would offer refunds</a>, though not guaranteed, and moved forward with plans to brick the device in December 2024.</p>
<h2>It was always open source, just not publicly</h2>
<p>Enter Dammit Jeff, a YouTuber who dove into his device and shows off some alternative software ideas for it (as we first saw <a href="https://blog.adafruit.com/2024/11/12/what-to-do-with-the-spotify-car-thing/">on Adafruit's blog</a>). He even likes the little thing, noting that its wheel feels great, and that the four buttons on the top—originally meant for favorite playlists—present a lot of possibilities.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>

    <div data-article-body="">

        

      

      <p>Siberian summers do not last long. The snows linger into May, and the cold weather returns again during September, freezing the <a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/taiga">taiga</a> into a still life awesome in its desolation: endless miles of straggly pine and birch forests scattered with sleeping bears and hungry wolves; steep-sided mountains; white-water rivers that pour in torrents through the valleys; thousands of miles of icy bogs. This forest is one of the last and greatest of Earth’s wildernesses. It stretches from Russia’s Arctic regions to as far south as Mongolia, and east from the Urals to the Pacific: millions of square miles of sparsely populated nothingness.</p>

<p>When the warm days do arrive, though, the taiga blooms, and for a few short months it can seem almost welcoming. It is then that man can see most clearly into this hidden world—not on land, for the taiga can swallow whole armies of explorers, but from the air. Siberia is the source of most of Russia’s oil and mineral resources, and, over the years, even its most distant parts have been overflown by oil prospectors and surveyors on their way to backwoods camps where the work of extracting wealth is carried on.</p>

<p>Thus it was in the remote south of the forest in the summer of 1978. A helicopter sent to find a safe spot to land a party of geologists was skimming the tree line 100 or so miles from the Mongolian border when it dropped into the thickly wooded valley of an unnamed tributary of the <a href="http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/364/Abakan-River">Abakan River</a>, a seething ribbon of water rushing through dangerous terrain. The valley walls were narrow, with sides that were close to vertical in places, and the skinny pine and birch trees swaying in the rotors’ downdraft were so thickly clustered that there was little chance of finding a spot to set the aircraft down.</p>

<p>However, peering intently through his windscreen in search of a landing place, the pilot saw something that should not have been there. It was a clearing on a mountainside, wedged between the pine and larch and scored with what looked like long, dark furrows. The baffled helicopter crew made several passes before reluctantly concluding that this was evidence of human habitation—a garden that, from the size and shape of the clearing, must have been there for a long time.</p>

<p>It was an astounding discovery. The mountain was more than 150 miles from the nearest settlement in an area that had never been explored. The Soviet authorities had no records of anyone living in the district.</p>

<p>The four scientists sent into the district to prospect for iron ore were told about the pilots’ sighting, and it perplexed and worried them. “In the taiga, it’s less dangerous to run across a wild animal than a stranger,” as Russian journalist Vasily Peskov wrote in <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Lost-Taiga-Fifty-Year-Religious-Wilderness/dp/0385472099">Lost in the Taiga: One Russian Family’s 50-Year Struggle for Survival and Religious Freedom in the Siberian Wilderness</a></em>. Rather than wait at their own temporary base, ten miles away, the scientists decided to investigate. The group’s leader, a geologist named Galina Pismenskaya, said they “chose a fine day and put gifts in our packs for our potential friends”—though, just to be sure, she recalled, “I did check the pistol that hung at my side.”</p>

      <p>A Russian journalist provides a haunting account of the Lykovs, a family of Old Believers, or members of a fundamentalist sect, who in 1932 went to live in the depths of the Siberian Taiga and survived for more than fifty years apart from the modern world.</p>
      </div>
  </div>
<p>As the intruders scrambled up the mountain, heading for the spot pinpointed by their pilots, they began to come across signs of human activity: a rough path, a staff, a log laid across a stream and finally a small shed filled with birch-bark containers of cut-up dried potatoes. Pismenskaya told Peskov:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Beside a stream there was a dwelling. Blackened by time and rain, the hut was piled up on all sides with taiga rubbish—bark, poles, planks. If it hadn’t been for a window the size of my backpack pocket, it would have been hard to believe that people lived there. But they did, no doubt about it. … Our arrival had been noticed, as we could see.</p>

<p>The low door creaked, and the figure of a very old man emerged into the light of day, straight out of a fairy tale. Barefoot. Wearing a patched and repatched shirt made of sacking. He wore trousers of the same material, also in patches, and had an uncombed beard. His hair was disheveled. He looked frightened and was very attentive. … We had to say something, so I began: “Greetings, grandfather! We’ve come to visit.”</p>

<p>The old man did not reply immediately. … Finally, we heard a soft, uncertain voice: “Well, since you have traveled this far, you might as well come in.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The sight that greeted the geologists as they entered the cabin was like something from the Middle Ages. Jerry-built from whatever materials came to hand, the dwelling was not much more than a burrow—“a low, soot-blackened log kennel that was as cold as a cellar,” with a floor consisting of potato peel and pine-nut shells, wrote Peskov. Looking around in the dim light, the visitors saw that it consisted of a single room. It was cramped, musty and indescribably filthy, propped up by sagging joists—and, astonishingly, home to a family of five. As Pismenskaya told the author:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>[The] silence was suddenly broken by sobs and lamentations. Only then did we see the silhouettes of two women. One was in hysterics, praying: “This is for our sins, our sins.” The other, keeping behind a post … sank slowly to the floor. The light from the little window fell on her wide, terrified eyes, and we realized we had to get out of there as quickly as possible.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Led by Pismenskaya, the scientists backed hurriedly out of the hut and retreated to a spot a few yards away, where they took out some provisions and began to eat. After about half an hour, the door of the cabin creaked open, and the old man and his two daughters emerged—no longer panicked and, though still obviously frightened, “frankly curious.” Warily, the three strange figures approached and sat down with their visitors, rejecting everything that they were offered—jam, tea, bread—with a muttered, “We are not allowed that!” When Pismenskaya asked, “Have you ever eaten bread?” the old man answered: “I have. But they have not. They have never seen it.” At least he was intelligible. The daughters spoke a language distorted by a lifetime of isolation. “When the sisters talked to each other, it sounded like a slow, blurred cooing.”</p>

</figure>
<p>Slowly, over several visits, the full story of the family emerged. The old man’s name was Karp Osipovich Lykov, and he was an <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Old-Believers">Old Believer</a>—a member of a fundamentalist Russian Orthodox sect, worshiping in a style unchanged since the 17th century. Old Believers had been <a href="http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=fZKbsRzTvLkC&amp;pg=PA27&amp;dq=old+believers+peter+the+great&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=08kBUa65LKWc0QW3qYCICA&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwADgK#v=onepage&amp;q=old%20believers%20peter%20the%20great&amp;f=false">persecuted</a> since the days of Peter the Great, and Lykov talked about it as though it had happened only yesterday. For him, Peter was a personal enemy and “the Antichrist in human form”—a point he insisted had been amply proved by the czar’s <a href="http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=-Ag2bbYzgacC&amp;pg=PA72&amp;dq=peter+the+great+beard+tax&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ookCUZW8I-eS0QWbtYCYBA&amp;ved=0CDoQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=peter%20the%20great%20beard%20tax&amp;f=false">campaign to modernize Russia</a> by forcibly “[chopping] off the beards of Christians.” These centuries-old hatreds were conflated with more recent grievances; Karp was prone to complain in the same breath about a merchant who had refused to make a gift of 26 <em><a href="https://financial-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Pood">poods </a></em>of salt to the Old Believers sometime around 1900. As the geologists filled him in on what he’d missed, he used a similar lens to form opinions about current events:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The events that had excited the world were unknown here. The Lykovs did not know any famous names and had heard only vaguely about the past war. When in recalling the “first world war” with Karp Osipovich the geologists engaged him in conversation about the last one, he shook his head: “What is this, a second time, and always the Germans.

<p>Things had only gotten worse for the Lykov family when the <a href="http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=8jkFD4ZXjd8C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=The+Plot+to+Kill+God:+Findings+from+the+Soviet+Experiment+in+Secularization&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=k4oCUbmnO4ml0AWT4YCoAg&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20Plot%20to%20Kill%20God%3A%20Findings%20from%20the%20Soviet%20Experiment%20in%20Secularization&amp;f=false">atheist Bolsheviks</a> took power. Under the Soviets, isolated Old Believer communities that had fled to Siberia to escape persecution began to retreat ever further from civilization. During the purges of the 1930s, with Christianity itself under assault, a Communist patrol had shot Lykov’s brother on the outskirts of their village while Lykov knelt working beside him. He had responded by scooping up his family and <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/meet-the-last-lykov-000001-v20n4/">bolting into the forest</a>.</p>

<p>That was in 1936, and there were only four Lykovs then—Karp; his wife, Akulina; a son named Savin, who was around 9 years old; and Natalia, a daughter who was only 2. Taking their possessions and some seeds, they had retreated ever deeper into the taiga, building themselves a succession of crude dwelling places, until at last they had fetched up in this desolate spot. Two more children had been born in the wild—Dmitry in 1940 and Agafia in 1944—and their knowledge of the outside world came entirely from their parents’ stories. The family’s principal entertainment, Peskov noted, “was for everyone to recount their dreams.”</p>

<p>The Lykov children knew there were places called cities where humans lived crammed together in tall buildings. They had heard there were countries other than Russia. But such concepts were no more than abstractions to them. Their only reading matter was prayer books and an ancient family Bible. Akulina had taught her children to read and write using sharpened birch sticks dipped into honeysuckle juice as pen and ink. When Agafia was later shown a video of a horse on the geologists’ television set, she recognized it from her mother’s stories. “A steed!” she exclaimed. “Papa, a steed!”</p>

<p>But if the family’s isolation was hard to grasp, the unmitigated harshness of their lives was not. Traveling to the Lykov homestead on foot was astonishingly arduous, as Peskov would later learn firsthand. On his first visit to the Lykovs in the 1980s, the writer—who would appoint himself the family’s chief chronicler—noted that “we traversed 250 kilometers [155 miles] without seeing a single human dwelling!”</p>

<p>Isolation made survival in the wilderness close to impossible. Dependent solely on their own resources, the Lykovs struggled to replace the few things they had brought into the taiga with them. They fashioned birch-bark galoshes in place of shoes. Clothes were patched and repatched until they fell apart, then replaced with hemp cloth grown from seed.</p>

<p>The Lykovs had carried a crude spinning wheel and, incredibly, the components of a loom into the taiga with them. A couple of kettles served them well for many years, but when rust finally overcame them, the only replacements they could fashion came from birch bark. Since these could not be placed in a fire, it became far harder to cook. By the time the Lykovs were discovered, their staple diet was potato patties mixed with ground rye and hemp seeds.</p>

<p>In some respects, Peskov wrote, the taiga did offer abundance: “Beside the dwelling ran a cold, clear stream. Stands of larch, spruce, pine and birch yielded all that anyone could take. … Bilberries and raspberries were close to hand, firewood as well, and pine nuts fell right on the roof.”</p>

<p>Yet the Lykovs lived permanently on the edge of famine. It was not until the late 1950s, when Dmitry reached manhood, that they first trapped animals for their meat and skins. Lacking guns or even bows, they could hunt only by digging traps or pursuing prey across the mountains until the animals collapsed from exhaustion. Dmitry built up “astonishing endurance” and could hunt barefoot in winter, sometimes returning to the hut after several days with a young elk across his shoulders. More often than not, though, there was no meat, and their diet gradually became more monotonous. Wild animals destroyed their crop of carrots, and Agafia recalled the late 1950s as “the hungry years”:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We ate the rowanberry leaf, roots, grass, mushrooms, potato tops and bark. We were hungry all the time. Every year we held a council to decide whether to eat everything up or leave some for seed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Famine was an ever-present danger in these circumstances, and in 1960 it snowed in June. The hard frost killed everything growing in their garden, and by spring the family had been reduced to eating leather shoes, bark and straw. Akulina chose to see her children fed, and in February 1961 she died of starvation.</p>

<p>The rest of the family were saved by what they regarded as a miracle: a single grain of rye sprouted in their pea patch. The Lykovs put up a fence around the shoot and guarded it zealously night and day to keep off mice and squirrels. At harvest time, the solitary spike yielded 18 grains, and from this they painstakingly rebuilt their rye crop.</p>

<p>As the Soviet geologists got to know the Lykov family, they realized that they had underestimated their abilities and intelligence. Old Karp was usually delighted by the latest innovations that the scientists brought up from their camp, and though he steadfastly refused to believe that man had set foot on the moon, he adapted swiftly to the idea of satellites. The Lykovs had noticed them as early as the 1950s, when “the stars began to go quickly across the sky,” and Karp himself conceived a theory to explain this: “People have thought up something and are sending out fires that are very like stars.”</p>

<p>“What amazed him most of all,” Peskov recorded, “was a transparent cellophane package. ‘Lord, what have they thought up—it is glass, but it crumples!’” Even at the end of his life, when he was in his 80s, Karp held grimly to his status as head of the family. His eldest child, Savin, dealt with this by casting himself as the family’s unbending arbiter in matters of religion. “Savin was strong in his faith, but he was a harsh man,” his own father said of him, and Karp seems to have worried about what would happen to his family after he died if Savin took control. Certainly the eldest son would have encountered little resistance from Natalia, who always struggled to replace her mother as cook, seamstress and nurse.</p>

<p>The two younger children, on the other hand, were more open to change and innovation. “Fanaticism was not terribly marked in Agafia,” Peskov wrote, and in time he came to realize that the youngest of the Lykovs “had a sense of humor and irony and knew how to poke fun at herself.” Agafia’s unusual speech—she had a singsong voice and stretched simple words into polysyllables—convinced some of her visitors she was slow-witted. On the contrary, she was markedly intelligent, helping Savin with the difficult task, in a family that possessed no calendars, of keeping track of time. She thought nothing of hard work, either, excavating a new cellar by hand late in the fall and working on by moonlight when the sun had set. Asked by an astonished Peskov whether she was not frightened to be out alone in the wilderness after dark, she replied: “What is there to be afraid of?”</p><figure>

</figure>
<p>Of all the Lykovs, though, the geologists’ favorite was Dmitry, a consummate outdoorsman who knew all of the taiga’s moods. He was the most curious and perhaps the most forward-looking member of the family. It was he who had built the family stove, and all the birch-bark buckets that they used to store food. Perhaps it was no surprise that he was also the most enraptured by the scientists’ technology. Once relations had improved to the point that the Lykovs could be persuaded to visit the Soviets’ camp, downstream, he spent many happy hours in its little sawmill, marveling at how easily a circular saw and lathes could finish wood. “It’s not hard to figure,” Peskov wrote. “The log that took Dmitry a day or two to plane was transformed into handsome, even boards before his very eyes. Dmitry felt the boards with his palm and said: ‘Fine!’”</p>

<p>Karp Lykov fought a long and losing battle with himself to keep all this modernity at bay. When they first got to know the geologists, the family would accept only a single gift—salt. (Living without it for four decades, Karp said, had been “true torture.”) Over time, however, they began to take more. They welcomed the assistance of their special friend among the geologists—a driller named Yerofei Sedov, who spent much of his spare time helping them to plant and harvest crops. They eventually accepted blankets, wool socks, grain and even a flashlight. Once, when Agafia was asked why she would use a battery-powered flashlight when she wouldn’t accept matches, she “didn’t know how to respond,” wrote Peskov. “She only confirmed that matches were indeed a sinful thing.” Meanwhile, the sin of television, which the family encountered at the geologists’ camp, “proved irresistible for them”:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>On their rare appearances in camp, they would invariably sit down and watch. Karp Osipovich sat directly in front of the screen. Agafia watched, poking her head out from behind a door. She tried to pray away her transgression immediately—whispering, crossing herself—and once again stuck her head out. The old man prayed afterward, diligently and in one fell swoop.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Perhaps the saddest aspect of the Lykovs’ strange story is the rapidity with which the family went into decline after they re-established contact with the outside world. In the fall of 1981, three of the four children followed their mother to the grave. According to Peskov, their deaths were not, as some have <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/meet-the-last-lykov-000001-v20n4/">speculated</a>, the result of exposure to diseases to which they had no immunity. Both Savin and Natalia suffered from kidney failure, most likely a result of their harsh diet. But Dmitry died of pneumonia, which might have begun as an infection he acquired from his new friends.</p>

<p>His death shook the geologists, who tried desperately to save him. They offered to call in a helicopter and have him evacuated to a hospital. But Dmitry, in extremis, would abandon neither his family nor the religion he had practiced all his life. “We are not allowed that,” he whispered just before he died. “A man lives for howsoever long God grants.”</p>

<p>When all three Lykovs had been buried, the geologists attempted to talk Karp and Agafia into leaving the forest and returning to be with relatives who had survived the persecutions of the purge years, and who still lived on in the same old villages. But neither of the survivors would hear of it.</p>

<p>Agafia did accept one invitation around this time. The Soviet government offered to take her on tour across the country, and she agreed to go. Her father stayed behind, but she spent a month on the road, soaking up everything she had missed. When the trip ended, she returned to her old life. “It’s scary out there,” Agafia told <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/meet-the-last-lykov-000001-v20n4/"><em>Vice</em></a> in 2013. “You can’t breathe. There are cars everywhere. There is no clean air. Each car that passes by leaves so many toxins in the air. You have no other option but to stay at home.”</p>

<p>Soon after Agafia’s sojourn, Karp Lykov died in his sleep on February 16, 1988, 27 years to the day after his wife, Akulina. Agafia buried him on the mountain slopes with the help of the geologists, then turned and headed back to her home. The Lord would provide, and <a href="https://stranniki.blogspot.com/2009/02/how-to-live-substantively-in-our-times.html">she would stay</a>, she said—as indeed she did. “The taiga reclaimed her,” author Isabel Colegate wrote in <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Pelican-Wilderness-Hermits-Solitaries-Recluses/dp/158243591X">A Pelican in the Wilderness: Hermits, Solitaries and Recluses</a></em>. “She felt it was her home.”</p>

<p>More than 30 years later, this child of the taiga lives on in the wilderness. However, as her health has declined—she turned 80 earlier this year—she has started <a href="https://www.thetimes.com/uk/politics/article/agafia-the-soviet-peasant-queen-of-putins-russia-finds-an-oligarch-for-a-friend-bd0w0xhhp">accepting more help</a>. Lately, much of that help comes from the Russian billionaire <a href="https://www.forbes.com/profile/oleg-deripaska/">Oleg Deripaska</a>, who paid for a new wooden cottage to be built for her several years ago. She also acquired a satellite telephone, which she uses daily, and volunteers frequently travel to her isolated home to deliver supplies and help her manage daily affairs, particularly during the cold winters.</p>

<p>Agafia will not leave. But we must leave her, seen through the eyes of Sedov on the day of her father’s funeral:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I looked back to wave to Agafia. She was standing by the river break like a statue. She wasn’t crying. She nodded: “Go on, go on.” We went another kilometer and I looked back. She was still standing there.</p>

    <p>Small teams with shared email addresses (i.e. hello@ or support@) have been stuck between a rock and a hard place for far too long.</p>

    <p>Sharing a login to an inbox requires a delicate dance to avoid stepping on toes and missing important replies. When that inevitably breaks down, the search for tools leads you through a swamp of overpriced help-desk tools with overcomplicated features built for much, much larger teams.</p>

    <p>Whether you’re doing customer support, dealing with clients, managing your community, or something else entirely, we believe your team deserves better. That’s why we built <strong>Jelly</strong>.</p>

    <p><strong>Jelly</strong> is our take on a shared inbox. It’s just email, with a few handy features built for <em>teams</em>:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Everyone on your team has their own login and can take point on an email. It’s as simple as saying “I’ve got this.” Always see who-has-what at a glance and say goodbye to stepping on each other’s toes!</li>
      
      <li>Everyone can easily keep track of all communications across the team with a robust notification system and activity log. No more losing conversations in someone else’s inbox!</li>
    </ul>

    <p><mark><strong>Jelly</strong> has been a real game-changer for our team, and we’re confident it will be for yours too.</mark></p>

    <p>Oh, and did we mention it’s <em>affordable</em>? There are plenty of shared inboxes out there, but they’re incredibly expensive and bloated with features that small teams don’t need. How expensive? Try $20+ per user per month. That’s over $240 a year just for one user—in this economy!?</p>

    <p><strong>Jelly</strong> charges a reasonable flat fee per account, so you can bring your whole team without having to worry about seat limits. Even our plan table is simple and straight-forward:</p>

							<p>It was dinnertime on October 30, 2024, when police handcuffed Brittany Patterson in front of three of her four children and drove her to the station in Fannin County, Georgia. She was then fingerprinted, photographed, and dressed in an orange jumpsuit.</p> <p>Hours earlier, around noon, Patterson had driven her eldest son to a medical appointment. Her youngest son, 11-year-old Soren, intended to come along but wasn't around when it was time to leave.</p> <p>"I figured he was in the woods, or at grandma's house," says Patterson, who lives on 16 acres with her kids and her father. (Her husband works out of state). There is no shortage of family in the vicinity. Patterson's mother and sisters live just two minutes away.</p> <p>Soren, however, was not playing in the woods. He had decided to walk to downtown Mineral Bluff, a town of just 370 people. It's not quite a mile from his house. A woman who saw him walking alongside the road—speed limit: 25 in some places, 35 in others—asked him if he was OK. He said yes.</p> <p>Nevertheless, she called the police.</p> <p>A female sheriff picked up the boy and called Patterson. "She asked me if I knew he was downtown and I said no," says Patterson.</p> <p>Patterson was upset that Soren had gone to town without letting anyone know, but says there was hardly reason to worry.</p> <p>"I was not panicking as I know the roads and know he is mature enough to walk there without incident," she says.</p> <p>The sheriff disagreed.</p> <p>"She kept mentioning how he could have been run over, or kidnapped or 'anything' could have happened," recalls Patterson.</p> <p>The sheriff drove Soren home and left him with his grandfather. After returning to the house, Patterson scolded her son—and that, she thought, was that.</p> <p>But at 6:30 p.m. that night, the sheriff returned with another officer. They told Patterson to turn around and put her hands behind her back. As three of her kids watched, Patterson was handcuffed. The sheriff took her purse and phone, put her in the cruiser, and hauled her off to jail.</p> <p>To Patterson, none of this made sense. She had grown up in the area with plenty of unsupervised time to wander and play and was raising her kids that way, too.</p> <p>"The mentality here is more Free-Range," she says.</p> <p>Patterson was soon released on a $500 bail. The next day, a case manager from the Division of Family and Children Services (DFCS) came out for a home visit, and even went to interview Patterson's oldest son at his school. The case manager told Patterson that everything seemed fine, but declined to comment to&nbsp;<em>Reason.</em></p> <p>A few days later, DFCS presented Patterson with a "safety plan" for her to sign. It would require her to delegate a "safety person" to be a "knowing participant and guardian" and watch over the children whenever she leaves home. The plan would also require Patterson to download an app onto her son's phone allowing for his location to be monitored. (The day when it will be illegal <em>not </em>to track one's kids is rapidly approaching.)</p> <p>Patterson did not want to be compelled to track her son. Recalling <a href="https://reason.com/2022/02/08/melissa-henderson-babysit-covid-arrest-blairsville/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://reason.com/2022/02/08/melissa-henderson-babysit-covid-arrest-blairsville/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1731429996083000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0uzP0i7GRjdBZYR4CSUa5A">a similar case</a>, she contacted attorney David DeLugas.

He recorded the conversation, which is legal in Georgia. The ADA told DeLugas that if Patterson would sign the safety plan, the criminal charges would be dropped.</p> <p>DeLugas responded that if Patterson had to sign a safety plan simply because her son walked someplace without her knowing his exact location, it would stop him from visiting friends or having any independence whatsoever. But the ADA maintained that Soren had been in danger, and thus a safety plan was necessary.</p> <p>The matter was left unsettled.</p> <p>With safety plans, the veiled threat is that if you don't sign, your children could be taken away, says DeLugas. In this case, he says, the unspoken deal seems to be: Sign it and the state won't prosecute. If the state&nbsp;<em>does&nbsp;</em>prosecute, Patterson could face a reckless conduct charge, a $1,000 fine, and a year in jail.</p> <p>DeLugas would like to see Georgia pass a law that permits the authorities to check up on kids and then leave them be as long as they aren't hurt, in distress, or in actual, immediate danger from an identifiable source. Meanwhile, as if this case could not get weirder, DCFS just mailed Soren a birthday card signed by the case manager. Soren turned 11 over the weekend.</p> <p>Birthday greetings do not change the facts. Patterson knows that refusing to sign the safety plan could get her in trouble. But she is resolute.</p> <p>"I will not sign," she says.</p>						</div></div>]]></description>

Through the Pledge, many other companies are also stepping up to the plate, paying maintainers at least $2,000 per year per dev on staff and blogging about it annually to drive awareness and accountability.</p><p>If your company would like to be <a href="https://opensourcepledge.com/members/"><u>part of this movement</u></a> alongside the likes of <a href="https://blog.laravel.com/taylors-morning-routine-laravels-open-source-pledge"><u>Laravel</u></a>, <a href="https://www.herodevs.com/blog-posts/herodevs-joins-the-oss-pledge-supporting-the-future-of-openjs-and-beyond"><u>HeroDevs</u></a>, <a href="https://blog.stackblitz.com/posts/stackblitz-joins-osspledge/"><u>StackBlitz</u></a>,&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.gitbutler.com/open-source-pledge-2024/"><u>GitButler</u></a>, and, as of today, <a href="https://www.sanity.io/blog/sanity-joins-the-open-source-pledge">Sanity</a>, learn <a href="https://opensourcepledge.com/join/"><u>how to join</u></a>.</p><h2 id="sentrys-distributions-for-2024-"><a href="#sentrys-distributions-for-2024-"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" version="1.1"><path d="M10.8786797,6.05025253 L15,1.92893219 C16.7967298,0.132202428 19.6206785,-0.0112433245 21.5814287,1.49859493 C21.7515515,1.62959474 21.9151761,1.77304049 22.0710678,1.92893219 C24.0236893,3.88155365 24.0236893,7.04737854 22.0710678,9 L17.9497475,13.1213203 C17.5592232,13.5118446 16.9260582,13.5118446 16.5355339,13.1213203 C16.1450096,12.7307961 16.1450096,12.0976311 16.5355339,11.7071068 L20.6568542,7.58578644 C21.8284271,6.41421356 21.8284271,4.51471863 20.6568542,3.34314575 C19.4852814,2.17157288 17.5857864,2.17157288 16.4142136,3.34314575 L12.2928932,7.46446609 C11.9023689,7.85499039 11.2692039,7.85499039 10.8786797,7.46446609 C10.4881554,7.0739418 10.4881554,6.44077682 10.8786797,6.05025253 Z M13.1213203,17.9497475 L9,22.0710678 C7.04737854,24.0236893 3.88155365,24.0236893 1.92893219,22.0710678 C-0.0236892706,20.1184464 -0.0236892706,16.9526215 1.92893219,15 L6.05025253,10.8786797 C6.44077682,10.4881554 7.0739418,10.4881554 7.46446609,10.8786797 C7.85499039,11.2692039 7.85499039,11.9023689 7.46446609,12.2928932 L3.34314575,16.4142136 C2.17157288,17.5857864 2.17157288,19.4852814 3.34314575,20.6568542 C4.51471863,21.8284271 6.41421356,21.8284271 7.58578644,20.6568542 L11.7071068,16.5355339 C12.0976311,16.1450096 12.7307961,16.1450096 13.1213203,16.5355339 C13.5118446,16.9260582 13.5118446,17.5592232 13.1213203,17.9497475 Z M4.75735931,17.8284271 L17.8284271,4.75735931 C18.2189514,4.36683502 18.8521164,4.36683502 19.2426407,4.75735931 C19.633165,5.1478836 19.633165,5.78104858 19.2426407,6.17157288 L6.17157288,19.2426407 C5.78104858,19.633165 5.1478836,19.633165 4.75735931,19.2426407 C4.36683502,18.8521164 4.36683502,18.2189514 4.75735931,17.8284271 Z" fill="currentColor"></path></svg></a>Sentry’s Distributions for 2024 </h2><p>Our main distributions this year are as follows:</p><table><tbody><tr><th><p><b>Recipient</b></p></th><th><p><b>Amount ($)</b></p></th></tr><tr><td><p>Django</p></td><td><p>30,000</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>OSI</p></td><td><p>30,000</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Outreachy</p></td><td><p>25,000</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Python</p></td><td><p>16,500</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>OpenJS</p></td><td><p>15,000</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Rust</p></td><td><p>15,000</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>rrweb</p></td><td><p>15,000</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>SPI (PostgreSQL)</p></td><td><p>15,000</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Geomys (Go)</p></td><td><p>15,000</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>PHP</p></td><td><p>12,000</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Apache</p></td><td><p>10,000</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Ruby Central</p></td><td><p>10,000</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>.NET</p></td><td><p>10,000</p></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><p>sum</p></td><td><p>218,500</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>% of overall budget</p></td><td><p>29</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>Armin Nehzat at thanks.dev helped me manage these relationships again.

Insofar as we are successful, we will need to have a lot more conversations about how to <i>allocate</i> those funds.</p><p>I see a lot of proposals around allocation that require companies to pay more attention to their dependencies through bounties, goals, perks, and whatnot. The problem is that attention is <i>expensive</i>. There are way too many of you maintainers for me to decide precisely what to pay each one of you individually based on a full review of your contributions and circumstances. We need approaches to allocation that require <i>less</i> attention, especially to win over companies who care a lot less about Open Source maintainers than Sentry does. Write a big check, pick a few high-level ecosystems, … and then what? I see two options: algorithms and people.</p><p>On the one hand, platforms such as thanks.dev, Open Collective, and GitHub Sponsors can keep developing and refining algorithms for allocation. We are really early days on this. Platforms have an opportunity to differentiate and earn the community’s trust by developing allocation algorithms openly and transparently.</p><p>On the other hand, I see an opportunity for the leadership of FOSS foundations to take on more responsibility. Their scope has been <a href="https://openpath.chadwhitacre.com/2024/the-future-of-foss-foundations/"><u>expanding for decades</u></a>. Newer entities such as the PHP Foundation intentionally <a href="https://thephp.foundation/foundation/#foundation-activities"><u>focus on paying maintainers</u></a>, at least for the core, if not the wider library ecosystem. The Pledge intends to pay maintainers so Open Source stays healthy. Ecosystem foundations seem to me to be a natural venue for each community to hash out for itself the best way to distribute funds toward that end.</p><p>One way or another, we’re proud at Sentry to run our own Open Source funding program for the fourth year in a row and to continue driving this wider conversation. We’re grateful to all of you maintainers out there, and we invite other companies to join us in paying the maintainers through the <a href="https://opensourcepledge.com/"><u>Open Source Pledge</u></a>.</p></div></div>]]></description>

                </p></div>

                
                <p>The Spin community is proud to introduce <a href="https://github.com/fermyon/spin/releases/tag/v3.0.0">Spin 3.0</a> — the latest major release of <a href="https://developer.fermyon.com/spin">Spin</a>, the open source developer tool for building, distributing, and running serverless WebAssembly (or Wasm) applications <em>everywhere</em>.</p>
<p>Since <a href="https://www.fermyon.com/blog/introducing-spin">the initial release of Spin back in 2022</a>, we have seen a growing community of passionate developers excited about the benefits they get from using Wasm: tiny, portable binaries, with <a href="https://fermyon.github.io/spin-benchmarks/criterion/reports/spin-executor__noop/concurrency-1/index.html">incredibly low startup latency</a> and massive throughput; and we have seen developers use Spin to build and run apps in some of the most diverse places: from Kubernetes and conventional cloud platforms, to cars, factory floors, or even experimenting with running Spin apps in space.</p>
<h2>Spin 3.0 Highlights</h2>
<p>We, the folks working on Spin, love Wasm for how lightweight it is, the quick cold start times and the superior safety guarantees. These properties make Wasm exciting for server side use cases, scenarios where containers are too slow or too big, situations where sandboxing is essential and for serverless use cases where you only want to use compute you actually need and portability is key. But Wasm is the gift that keeps on giving because we are just now scratching the surface of what Wasm can do for developers.</p>
<h3>Why We’re More Excited About Wasm Than Ever</h3>
<p>If you aren’t familiar, WebAssembly provides a common bytecode format and compile target across programming languages. The WebAssembly Component Model takes that a step further and standardizes interfaces for components using WebAssembly Interface Types (WIT). WIT enables components to interoperate regardless of what language the components were originally written in and that’s where things get even more exciting. When you compile to a WebAssembly component, you can then use that component as a library or a dependency in another program written in an <em>entirely different language</em>. Now, there’s a lot that goes into being able to do this behind the scenes, and it’s not an entirely simple task. </p>
<h3>Component Dependencies - Polyglot Programming Made Easy</h3>
<p>Spin 3.0 introduces a workflow for this type of development in the hopes of making it seamless to do things like write a library for some compute intensive task in Rust and use that as a dependency in a JavaScript application. Or perhaps you’re not a Rust developer and don’t feel like learning it overnight? No problem. Fetch a component someone else already built from an OCI registry. Component dependencies can be stored, discovered, and fetched from OCI registries giving you the npm/NuGet/<a href="http://crates.io/">crates.io</a> style experience but for Wasm. Now, I think this particular feature is wild and could go on about it for at least a thesis, but there are even more Spin 3.0 topics to discuss so feel free to dig deeper in the component dependencies documentation <a href="https://developer.fermyon.com/spin/v3/writing-apps#using-component-dependencies">here</a> and in the demo later on.</p>
<h3>Selective Deployments - Build As One, Deploy Selectively</h3>
<p>You can now run a subset of components in a Spin application either locally with Spin CLI or <a href="https://www.spinkube.dev/docs/topics/selective-deployments">via SpinKube</a>. Spin 3.0 includes a new experimental flag: <code>spin up --component-id</code> that allows you to specify which components from your Spin application to run. In SpinKube, the containerd-shim-spin and spin-operator projects both support selective deployment of compoennts and there is a new <code>components</code> section in the SpinApp Custom Resource Definition (CRD) spec that enables selective deployment of components from a Spin application. This unlocks new scenarios for platform engineers who want to selectively run components on nodes that meets certain requirements. It also provides a streamlined workflow for developers who choose to develop a single Spin application containing multiple components while still giving platform engineers flexibility on how to split up and run components in a way that makes sense at deploy time.</p>
<h3>Deeper Integration With WASI Standards</h3>
<p>We’re big fans of standards in the Spin project. We both contribute to WASI APIs as we learn more about the needs of the community and also work to integrate them into the Spin project so folks can benefit from the collaboration and knowledge in the upstream WebAssembly community. With that said, we’re proud to announce that both the <a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/wasi-keyvalue">WASI Key-Value</a> and <a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/wasi-config">WASI Config</a> APIs are now officially supported in Spin. This marks an important next step in the journey to bringing <a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/wasi-cloud-core">WASI cloud core</a>, a WASI proposal for standardizing a set of APIs applications can use to interact with a common set of cloud services, into Spin.</p>
<h3>OpenTelemetry (OTel) Integration - Observability With Batteries Included</h3>
<p>Observability is essential for today’s application development and runtime environments, and we’ve been experimenting with how to ensure Spin applications can integrate seamlessly into existing observability stacks since Spin 2.4. Spin 3.0 now officially supports <a href="https://developer.fermyon.com/spin/v2/observing-apps#observing-applications">OpenTelemetry (OTel) observability in Spin applications</a>. This unlocks integrating Spin application observability with all of the great tools you already use today like Grafana, Jaegar, Prometheus and more. Spin applications have the ability to export metrics and provide distributed tracing out of the box, not to mention the <a href="https://developer.fermyon.com/spin/v2/observing-apps#using-the-otel-plugin"><code>spin otel</code> plugin</a> makes setting up an observability stack even easier. We’re taking what we’ve learned and contributed upstream to the <a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/wasi-observe">WASI observe</a> specification and are working with the community to continue to tackle improvements in this area.</p>
<h3>Spin Factors - A Major Runtime Refactor</h3>
<p>Last but not least for this post, we’ve done a HUGE refactor of the Spin internals with a feature called Spin Factors where a “factor” encapsulates a host functionality feature. Before Factors, host functionality was encapsulated in what we called “host components” but the more we added to Spin, the “soup-ier” things got. Another factor (get it?) in the creation of Spin Factors was the increase in the number of projects that are embedding Spin. These embeddings have slightly different environments and needs so we outgrew this concept of a “host component” and built an entirely new abstraction called Spin Factors based on these learnings. In turn, this allows the Spin runtime to be more modular. Everyone is a snowflake and we’re here for that. It’s also a bit easier now to extend the Spin runtime for your needs albeit it does require forking the project, but it’s possible and a big step in the right direction.</p>
<h2>Demos - Spin 3.0 In Action</h2>
<p>Here is an example of what you can do with the new component dependencies feature in Spin 3.0. This is all built on top of the standards work happening across the ecosystem, with the streamlined developer experience we are building into Spin.</p>
<p>The workload scenario is simple. We are building an image transformation application with 3 major components:</p>
<ul>
<li>a front-end component where users can upload images and select their transformation</li>
<li>an HTTP API component that receives images uploaded by users and the desired transformation</li>
<li>an image manipulation component that performs the actual transformation</li>
</ul>
<p>The common solution today is to use the same programming language for both your HTTP API component and the image manipulation component. If that is not possible or performant enough, then you might split the image manipulation component into its own microservice.</p>
<p>Using the power of Spin 3.0, we are going to use the new component dependency feature to build the image manipulation component in Rust, and consume that as a dependency from a JavaScript/TypeScript component that will act as our HTTP API. This shows the power of component dependencies feature as it allows us to use the right tool for the job.</p>
<p>Let’s start with writing <a href="https://github.com/radu-matei/spin-deps-image-manipulation/blob/main/lib/wit/world.wit">the interface for our image manipulation component</a>. We’ll define our image manipulation package (using <a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/component-model/blob/main/design/mvp/WIT.md">the WIT format</a>) which contains one interface with two image transformations (grayscale and sepia):</p>
<pre><code>package component:image-manipulation-lib;
...
/// Image manipulation interface.
interface image-manipulation {
    /// Error returned by image manipulation components.
    variant image-error {
        image-error(string),
        io-error(string),
        unknown(string),
    }
    /// Type representing an image.
    type image = list&lt;u8&gt;;
    /// Apply the grayscale transformation to the input image.
    grayscale: func(img: image, quality: u8) -&gt; result&lt;image, image-error&gt;;
    /// Apply the sepia transformation to the input image.
    sepia: func(img: image, quality: u8) -&gt; result&lt;image, image-error&gt;;
}
</code></pre>
<p>To implement this component in Rust, we will use a cargo component and a popular Rust image transformation library (photon-rs). Here is what the skeleton of the component implementation looks like:</p>
<pre><code>impl Guest for Component {
    fn grayscale(img: Image, quality: u8) -&gt; Result&lt;Image, ImageError&gt; {
        // perform the grayscale transformation using a performant Rust lib
    }

    fn sepia(img: Image, quality: u8) -&gt; Result&lt;Image, ImageError&gt; {
        // perform the sepia transformation using a performant Rust lib
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>We can build this into a Wasm component using cargo component. Now we’re now ready to publish this component to an OCI compliant registry using the latest work of the ecosystem around distributing Wasm components, <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasm-pkg-tools">wkg</a>, or the new experimental plugin we are building for Spin that uses it, <a href="https://github.com/fermyon/spin-deps-plugin"><code>spin deps</code></a>:</p>
<pre><code>$ cargo component build --release
  Generating bindings for image-manipulation-lib (src/bindings.rs)
   Compiling image-manipulation-lib v0.1.0
    Finished `release` profile [optimized] target(s) in 5.20s
    Creating component target/wasm32-wasip1/release/image_manipulation_lib.wasm

$ spin deps publish target/wasm32-wasip1/release/image_manipulation_lib.wasm \
    --registry fermyon.com \
    --package fermyon-experimental:image-manipulation-lib@6.0.0
	
    Published fermyon-experimental:image-manipulation-lib@6.0.0
</code></pre>
<p>We now have <a href="https://github.com/orgs/fermyon/packages/container/wasm-pkg%2Ffermyon-experimental%2Fimage-manipulation-lib/302562897?tag=6.0.0">a Wasm component that is published in a registry</a> that we can now consume from a Wasm component written in an entirely different language!</p>
<p>We can continue building our image manipulation service by creating the HTTP API component in TypeScript which takes a dependency on the Rust component we just built:</p>
<pre><code># create a new Spin application based on the TypeScript template
$ spin new -t http-ts image-manipulation-http-api

# add a dependency to the image manipulation component we pushed to the registry
$ spin deps add --registry fermyon.com \
		fermyon-experimental:image-manipulation-lib@6.0.0
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>spin deps</code> plugin walks us through selecting the right interface from the package we published and adds it as a dependency to our TypeScript component in the application manifest (spin.toml):</p>
<pre><code>[component.image-manipulation-http-api.dependencies]
"component:image-manipulation-lib/image-manipulation" = { 
    version = "^6.0.0", 
    registry = "fermyon.com", 
    package = "fermyon-experimental:image-manipulation-lib" 
}
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: the spin deps plugin is experimental and will most likely change in the near future. If you are interested in dependency management and distributing Wasm components using registries, join our <a href="https://discord.gg/AAFNfS7NGf">Discord server</a>!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We can now consume the dependency from our TypeScript component:</p>
<pre><code>import { grayscale, sepia } from "component:image-manipulation-lib/image-manipulation"

// ...

switch (transform) {
    case "grayscale":
        transformed = grayscale(new Uint8Array(body), quality);
        break;
    case "sepia":
        transformed = sepia(new Uint8Array(body), quality);
        break;
    default:
        throw new Error("Unknown image transform");
}
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>Check the <a href="https://github.com/radu-matei/spin-deps-image-manipulation">demo repository</a> for the complete application and build setup. It also contains an example of consuming the same image manipulation component from a Rust HTTP API.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can use all the built-in Spin features for <a href="https://developer.fermyon.com/spin/v3/kv-store-api-guide">key/value data</a>, <a href="https://developer.fermyon.com/spin/v3/variables">configuration</a>, or <a href="https://developer.fermyon.com/spin/v3/sqlite-api-guide">relational databases</a>. If you need inspiration, the HTTP API component in this example uses the key/value store to cache transformed images.</p>
<p>At this point, we can build the entire application using <code>spin build</code> and run it locally using <code>spin up</code>, which takes care of all necessary steps for our composition.</p>

<p>You can get full observability out of the box in your local setup using the <a href="https://developer.fermyon.com/spin/v2/observing-apps#using-the-otel-plugin">OpenTelemetry plugin</a> for Spin:</p>

While the Hearing Aid features can be </span><em>controlled</em><span> via macOS, they must be enabled through an iOS device, so we had to teleport the iPad.</span></p><p><span>At this point, a friend explained that modern devices position you within cities by using a combination of WiFi SSIDs + MAC addresses of routers and devices around you as well as GPS </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wi-Fi_positioning_system" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">to triangulate</a><span> your location. This was also the reason that our WiFi only iPad was able to display an accurate location in apps even though it had neither GPS nor cellular.</span></p><p><span>There are a couple of open source WiFi location databases out there, we chose to sign up on </span><a href="https://wigle.net/" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">Wigle</a><span>, and pull some data that we could broadcast on an ESP32 and trick iOS into thinking that we were actually in Menlo Park, California. </span></p><p><span>In order to make this work, we </span><a href="https://github.com/thel3l/skylift-internal" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">forked and modified</a><span> the awesome </span><a href="https://github.com/adamhrv/skylift" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">Skylift</a><span> project. This works by making an ESP32 cycle through WiFi SSIDs in rapid sequence, essentially simulating the air from another part of the world. We also bumped the number of SSIDs to cycle up through to 100 from 10.</span></p><p><span>This however would not be sufficient—we have a </span><em>lot</em><span> of WiFi networks in the homes around Lagrange Point, and needed to either dampen or overpower their strength so that the device would not be report any other networks around. It was time to build a Faraday cage.</span></p><p><span>This was easily the most fun part of this exercise. To build our initial version of the cage, we lined and wrapped a cardboard box with Aluminium foil. </span><em>Inside</em><span> the box, we had an ESP32 broadcasting SSIDs from California at the iPad, and connected the iPad to a laptop for console logs and also internet access. </span></p><p>Since WiFi and a microwave operate at the same frequency (2.4GHz), we ran our leaky microwave at full power to block out any persistent network signals in the air.</p><p>We finally set up a script to reboot the iPad and turn on the network after 5 minutes inside the box. If all went well, the iPad would wake up in California! </p><div><figure><a target="_blank"

<p>Anyone who uses Twitter a lot knows that it's a big place. Not just that it has a lot of active users, but more that there are lots of different parts.</p>
<p>Over time, everybody develops their own mental map of the landscape, infering how vast and foreign the whole network is from hints and clues, stray tweets escaping containment, and chance encounters in a big account's replies. But we never get to see the whole thing for real.</p>
<p>We can't make a map of all of Twitter, because the data isn't available and scraping it would be difficult and illegal. But we can do it for <a href="https://bsky.app/">BlueSky</a>, which has seen massive growth over the last several months thanks to Twitter's ongoing antagonization of its userbase and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blocking_of_Twitter_in_Brazil">Brazil banning Twitter</a> outright in October 2024.</p>
<p>Here's a sneak peek at the final result.</p>
<p>
  <img srcset="https://assets.joelgustafson.com/2024-11-12/Screenshot 2024-11-10 at 3.09.46 https://joelgustafson.com/posts/2024-11-12/PM.jpg 2x" width="1838" src="https://assets.joelgustafson.com/2024-11-12/Screenshot%202024-11-10%20at%203.09.46%20PM.jpg" node="[object Object]">
</p>
<p>You can also explore the map interactively at <a href="https://aurora.ndimensional.xyz/">https://aurora.ndimensional.xyz</a>, although you'll need desktop Chrome/Chromium since it uses WebGPU.</p>
<hr>
<p>The first step is getting the data. To keep things manageable, I'm just working with the <em>follow graph</em>. In this graph, each follow is treated like a single undirected edge, so "mutuals" have two edges between them that essentially weight the edge double.</p>
<p>BlueSky is build on the <a href="https://atproto.com/">AT protocol</a>, designed to realistically support anyone who wants to self-host their own data on their own PDS (<em>personal data server</em>). But all we really care about for this project is the WebSocket firehose exposed by the "relay" service <code>bsky.network</code> that the BlueSky team runs, which aggregates all the events from the main <code>*.bksy.social</code> PDS, and also every independent PDS who asks to be indexed. We can just open a WebSocket at <code>wss://bsky.network/xrpc/com.atproto.sync.subscribeRepos</code> and see every type of event streaming in from the entire network in real time, currently around 500 events per second. We filter this down to follows and unfollows, and store it all in a local SQLite database.</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>At first, last year, I set up a fancy system where I deployed the indexer to <a href="https://fly.io/">fly.io</a>, and configured it to replicate the database in realtime to an AWS S3 bucket using litestream. But that was a little over-engineered, and surprisingly expensive to run (my Fly bill was $40/month), so I shut it down and switched to running it entirely on my home server. I installed the indexer as a systemd service, and configured logrotate and a tmux&nbsp;monitor to let me ssh in through TailScale and watch the event stream live from anywhere.</p>

<p>Everything described in this entire post happens on this System76 desktop in my apartment.</p>
<p>How much data is there? BlueSky is growing quickly, but at the time of writing, it recently passed 13 million users, and the <code>follows</code> table had a little over half a billion rows, which was only around 30 GB on disk.</p>

<p>How do you render a graph of 13 million nodes and half a billion edges?</p>
<p>Graph layout has an entire field of research behind it. Some algorithms are designed for visually appealing diagrams, like <a href="https://github.com/dagrejs/dagre/wiki">dagre</a> or the <a href="https://dreampuf.github.io/GraphvizOnline">ones that GraphViz uses</a>. But of course the "classical" way to do this is with a force-directed layout. I remember seeing them first in the <a href="https://observablehq.com/@d3/force-directed-graph/2">D3 examples</a>.</p>
<p>
  <img srcset="https://assets.joelgustafson.com/2024-11-12/d3-gallery.gif 2x" width="470" src="https://assets.joelgustafson.com/2024-11-12/d3-gallery.gif" node="[object Object]">
</p>
<p>Force-directed graph layout is essentially a physics simulation: you pretend that every node exterts a repulsive force on every other node, and that edges induce an attractive force between the source and target. Typically, the repulsive force decreases quadratically with distance, like a magnet, and the attractive force increases linearly with distance, like a spring. On every "tick" of the simulation, you compute the net force on every node, and then move each node by its net force vector scaled by some global "temperature" parameter.</p>

<p>Computing these ticks is slow. The issue isn't the literal size of the graph - 500 million edges can easily fit in memory if they're just <code>[f32, f32]</code> tuples - but the computational complexity of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-body_simulation">n-body problem</a>.</p>
<p>The core issue is that since every node repells every other node, the naive algorithm for a single simulation tick is <code>O(n^2) + O(e)</code> (for <code>n</code> nodes and <code>e</code> edges). This is a non-starter for graphs with millions of nodes, even for a GPU. Instead, every force-directed graph engine uses the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barnes%E2%80%93Hut_simulation">Barnes-Hut</a> optimization, which reduces this to <code>O(n log(n)) + O(e)</code> at the expense of approximating the effects of distant nodes.</p>

</p>
<p>Building and querying the quadtree is intrinsically heirarchical, which means the node forces can't easily be computed on the GPU. Still, we can parallelize things as much as possible. The quadtree can be split up into 4 or 16 quadtrees, each rebuilt in parallel at the beginning of each tick. And then computing the forces can be parallelized arbitrarily by giving each thread in the pool a range of nodes to process. Each node's net force is the sum of the forces exerted on it by each of the quadtrees (computing this for a given node is just <code>O(log(n))</code>), and the forces exterted on it by all of its incoming and outgoing edges. We can utilize all available CPU with essentially zero overhead.</p>
<hr>
<p>I made a little multithreaded engine for force-directed graph layout in Zig, made a GUI using GTK4 and OpenGL, and named it <a href="https://github.com/nDimensional/andromeda">Andromeda</a>.</p>

</p>
<p>Andromeda is largely inspired by Gephi and the <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0098679">ForceAtlas2 paper</a>. The authors are keen to emphasize the importance of interactivity for working with large scale graph visualization - you need to be able to watch the graph evolving, and dynamically adjust the simulation parameters. You just don't get good results if your tools are opaque and have long iteration times.</p>
<p>Here's Andromeda running in real-time on a graph of 100,000 nodes.</p>

<hr>
<p>One of Andromeda's cute features is a UI widget that I call a "natural slider". Often when opening a new graph, or testing a new version of the engine, or adding a new parameter, it's impossible to know ahead of time what a sensible range for the value should be, even to an order of magnitude. Not to worry! With the natural slider, you can dynamically adjust the range by powers of e.</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>This gives us "natural orders" that fit our intuitive sense of "bigger" and "smaller" while giving easy access to the entire range of positive floats. Powers of 2 are too small, powers of ten are too big.</p>
<hr>
<p>Unfortunately, force-directed layouts for large social networks leave some things to be desired. Here's Andromeda's ForceAtlas2 layout of a snapshot of 5 million BlueSky users from September 2024:</p>

<p>The result is very "blobby". It clearly shows the mass and density of the major clusters - the "large-scale structure" - but most nodes are just strewn across vast undifferentiated fields in the general orbit of a supercluster. Only a couple dozen small communities, mostly countries, are tight and isolated enough to break off into their own streak.</p>
<p>I published an early version of this back in February, when the graph had just 2 million accounts. A common response was fascination with the global view but disappointment with the local views. The website lets people locate accounts by username, and when people looked themselves up, they didn't recognize the accounts around them, and had to search far and wide for familiar faces.</p>
<p>
  <img srcset="https://assets.joelgustafson.com/2024-11-12/early-aurora.jpg 2x" src="https://assets.joelgustafson.com/2024-11-12/early-aurora.jpg" node="[object Object]">
</p>
<p>There's naturally going to be pretty severe limitations on what is even possible here. No arrangement of accounts on a 2d plane will feel like it really captures the full topology of how the network is connected. But it felt like it was possible to do better, and that the force-directed approach just wasn't sensitive to local neighborhoods.</p>
<hr>
<p>Another way of seeing graph layout is as a type of "dimensionality reduction". We're try to take a big 13 million x 13 million adjacency matrix and project it onto a 2-dimensional pane. Naturally, dimensionality reduction has already been a point of interest in the machine learning world, first through linear algebra techniques like PCA and spectral analysis, and more recently through a variety of non-linear techniques. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonlinear_dimensionality_reduction">This Wikipedia page</a> has a great survey of them.</p>
<p>The big two that are famous for being shockingly good for 2-dimensional visualizations are t-SNE and UMAP. UMAP is behind several popular visualizations you may have seen on Hacker News or Twitter, like <a href="https://johnhw.github.io/umap_primes/index.md.html">this one</a> of the prime divisors of first million integers.</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>What happens if we throw the BlueSky matrix into UMAP? Well, we can't, at least not directly. Even though UMAP technically accepts sparse matrices, our scale is just to big for my home server. Instead, we can settle for using some other technique to derive embeddings for every user, in a medium-sized dimension like 32, and then feed <em>that</em> into UMAP. Easy!</p>
<p>After a bit of research it looked like this <a href="https://github.com/VHRanger/nodevectors/">nodevectors</a> repo was the best open-source node embedding toolkit, and the as-of-yet-unpublished GGVec algorithm had the best parallelized performance on huge graphs. I got embeddings for a 5-million-node September snapshot in just 5 minutes, and my first UMAP picture in another 10 minutes.</p>

<p>Amazing! Much more intermediate structure than the blobs that Andromeda gave us. Checking on my immediate neighbors, it felt better, although not as good as I had hoped. I wasn't in the immediate vicinity of <em>any</em> of my mutuals, even though the neighborhood felt closer to my "type" of account. Like people from another city in my state, but not my neighbors.</p>
<p>Is it really that hard? Is the graph topology connected in a way that only a tiny fraction of accounts can be placed near their mutuals? Or is all the local detail lost in the embedding, before UMAP? I'm still not sure.</p>
<hr>
<p>UMAP is really good, but has a couple quirks that aren't ideal for this project. One is that even if you spend days on end fiddling with the parameters, it's impossible to stop UMAP from making some clusters so dense that the points overlap. This behavior is expected and desirable if you want a pure dimensionality reduction where identical points in the source dimension map to the exact same place in the target dimension. But for making a map, I planned on rendering each account's profile picture on their node at close zoom levels, and wanted everyone to have the experience of seeing themselves placed in the big map.</p>
<p>Internally, UMAP actually uses a force-directed graph of its own in its final stage. At a very high level, UMAP works by taking the source embeddings and</p>
<ol>
<li>computing a "k-nearest-neighbors graph" where every sample has an edge to each of its <code>k</code> closest neighbors by euclidean distance in the embedding dimension</li>
<li>using fancy math to find special weights for these edges</li>
<li>computing a force-directed layout for the weighed k-nearest-neighbors graph</li>
</ol>
<p>All of the magic that makes UMAP look good is inside step 2, but computationally it still follows the same outline - nodes repel, edges attract. But UMAP plays it somewhat fast-and-loose with the final step, due to "computational constraints", and uses <em>sampling</em> to doing the force-directed layout. This means not every node actually repels every other node, even in the approximate way that Barnes-Hut does. Only some are randomly selected to interact with each other. So even though the <code>min_dist</code> parameter is supposed to control separation between points, I found it doesn't work very consistently for huge graphs.</p>
<p>Fortunately, I had already developed Andromeda to a point where it was easy to tweak the repulsive force equation, plug the UMAP output in, and run the simulation for a few ticks to "smooth out" the overlapping points.</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>Now, even in the most dense clusters, nodes are packed perfectly without layering.</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>Ideally I would love to get access to the raw weights of the graph that UMAP constructs, and use them in Andromeda directly, with the force equations from the UMAP paper but using Andromeda's parallelized quadtree, and see if the layout looks any different. I'll try to do this for the next version.</p>
<hr>
<p>Can we add color to this?</p>
<p>One approach is to apply clustering algorithms like HDBScan directly to the UMAP output, and color the clusters...</p>
<p>
  <img srcset="https://assets.joelgustafson.com/2024-11-12/Screenshot 2024-11-06 at 4.17.23 https://joelgustafson.com/posts/2024-11-12/PM.jpg 2x" src="https://assets.joelgustafson.com/2024-11-12/Screenshot%202024-11-06%20at%204.17.23%20PM.jpg" node="[object Object]">
</p>
<p>... but color also represents an opportunity to add another dimension of information, however small. UMAP is forced to superimpose separate clusters at times, so coloring nodes with a hue derived independently from the embedding space could help visually disambiguate them. The UMAP documentation has an <a href="https://umap-learn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/plotting.html#diagnostic-plotting">example</a> of doing PCA on the embedding space, and using the first three components for RGB values to color points for plotting. This is good for diagnostics, but isn't particularly visually appealing.</p>
<p>After a few rounds of design iteration, I settled on a process that computes a k-means clustering in the embedding space, assigns hues to each cluster, and then interpolates hues for points using their three nearest cluster centers. I found that this highlights more local struture than PCA, smoothly transitions in the embedding dimension, and gives the map a soothing, dappled, stained-glass texture up-close.</p>

<p>These hues are just single floats from 0 to 1, which I map to rgb using the hsluv color space. Saturation for every node is constant, to give the visualization some consistent visual identity. And lightness is scaled using the log10 of each user's follower count, so that large accounts appear as bright stars and lowbies appear muted. I had originally tried to render large accounts literally larger, but that turned out way too visually cluttered for large graphs.</p>
<p>Here's the full network as of 2024-11-07. I filtered out accounts that follow more than 50k accounts, or follow less than 5 accounts and have less than 5 followers, leaving 7.7 million nodes.</p>

<p>Neat!</p>
<p>There's a lot to learn from exploring the graph. Bot rings show up clearly exposed, for one. It creates a new kind of tourism, for better or worse, although not everyone in every community may be all that enthusiastic about this.</p>
<p>The next feature I'd like to add is a collapsible sidebar with a timeline of posts from just the accounts currently in view, so that you can easily check in on what the area you're looking at has been talking about. If you have other ideas let me know on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/syntacrobat.xyz">BlueSky</a> or <a href="https://x.com/gustafjt/">Twitter</a>; I'd love for this to be the beginning of a new kind of social/memetic exploration tool.</p>

<blockquote>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Note:</strong> HyperDX v2 is currently in beta for local mode.</p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="auto">You can get started by standing up the HyperDX local container, which will run
an OpenTelemetry collector (on port 4317), Clickhouse (on port 8123), and the
HyperDX UI (on port 8080).</p>
<p dir="auto">You can spin up the container with the following command:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="docker run -p 8080:8080 -p 8123:8123 -p 4317:4317 -p 4318:4318 hyperdx/hyperdx-local:2-beta"><pre>docker run -p 8080:8080 -p 8123:8123 -p 4317:4317 -p 4318:4318 hyperdx/hyperdx-local:2-beta</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Afterwards, you can visit <a href="http://localhost:8080/" rel="nofollow">http://localhost:8080</a> to access the HyperDX UI. If
you're connecting to an external Clickhouse cluster, you can simply just forward
port 8080 and set up the connection in the UI.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Safari &amp; Brave Browser Users:</strong> There are known issues with Safari &amp; Brave's
CORS implementation that can prevent connecting to Clickhouse in local mode.
We recommend using another browser in the interim.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">We recommend having <em>at least</em> 1GB of RAM and 1 CPU core available for the
container if using the included OpenTelemetry collector and Clickhouse server.</p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Hosted Cloud</h3><a id="user-content-hosted-cloud" aria-label="Permalink: Hosted Cloud" href="#hosted-cloud"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">HyperDX is also available as a hosted cloud service at
<a href="https://hyperdx.io/" rel="nofollow">hyperdx.io</a>. You can sign up for a free account and start

<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Instrumenting Your App</h2><a id="user-content-instrumenting-your-app" aria-label="Permalink: Instrumenting Your App" href="#instrumenting-your-app"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">To get logs, metrics, traces, session replay, etc into HyperDX, you'll need to
instrument your app to collect and send telemetry data over to your HyperDX
instance.</p>
<p dir="auto">We provide a set of SDKs and integration options to make it easier to get
started with HyperDX, such as
<a href="https://www.hyperdx.io/docs/install/browser" rel="nofollow">Browser</a>,

<p dir="auto"><strong>OpenTelemetry</strong></p>
<p dir="auto">Additionally, HyperDX is compatible with
<a href="https://opentelemetry.io/" rel="nofollow">OpenTelemetry</a>, a vendor-neutral standard for
instrumenting your application backed by CNCF. Supported languages/platforms
include:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Kubernetes</li>

<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Motivation</h2><a id="user-content-motivation" aria-label="Permalink: Motivation" href="#motivation"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Our mission is to help engineers ship reliable software. To enable that, we
believe every engineer needs to be able to easily leverage production telemetry
to quickly solve burning production issues.</p>
<p dir="auto">However, in our experience, the existing tools we've used tend to fall short in
a few ways:</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>They're expensive, and the pricing has failed to scale with TBs of telemetry
becoming the norm, leading to teams aggressively cutting the amount of data
they can collect.</li>
<li>They're hard to use, requiring full-time SREs to set up, and domain experts
to use confidently.</li>
<li>They requiring hopping from tool to tool (logs, session replay, APM,
exceptions, etc.) to stitch together the clues yourself.</li>
</ol>
<p dir="auto">We're still early on in our journey, but are building in the open to solve these
key issues in observability. We hope you give HyperDX a try and let us know how
we're doing!</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Open Source vs Hosted Cloud</h2><a id="user-content-open-source-vs-hosted-cloud" aria-label="Permalink: Open Source vs Hosted Cloud" href="#open-source-vs-hosted-cloud"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">HyperDX is open core, with most of our features available here under an MIT
license. We have a cloud-hosted version available at
<a href="https://hyperdx.io/" rel="nofollow">hyperdx.io</a> with a few
<a href="https://www.hyperdx.io/docs/oss-vs-cloud" rel="nofollow">additional features</a> beyond what's
offered in the open source version.</p>
<p dir="auto">Our cloud hosted version exists so that we can build a sustainable business and
continue building HyperDX as an open source platform. We hope to have more
comprehensive documentation on how we balance between cloud-only and open source
features in the future. In the meantime, we're highly aligned with Gitlab's

<p>Roll out the red carpet. Starting today, anyone in Los Angeles can take fully autonomous rides 24/7 with Waymo One – rolling through Santa Monica, Hollywood Boulevard, USC, and everything in between.</p>
<p>Waymo has enjoyed a warm welcome from Angelenos since we began commercial operations in LA earlier this year, with nearly 300,000 people joining our waitlist. We’ve opened our doors to those eager riders over time, who have taken hundreds of thousands of paid trips across the city and highly rated them at 4.7 / 5 stars on average. In fact, riders recently surveyed in LA said that 98% are satisfied with our service and 96% find it useful.</p>
<p>“Now is an exciting time to welcome everyone in Los Angeles along for the ride,” said Tekedra Mawakana, co-CEO, Waymo. “Our service has matured quickly and our riders are embracing the many benefits of fully autonomous driving. We’re so grateful to all of our first riders in LA, and we can’t wait to serve more riders soon.”</p>
<p>Riders can now traverse nearly 80 sq miles of LA County, and we intend to grow our service area to cover more of the city in the future. We look forward to welcoming many first-time riders and welcoming back those we’ve served over the last year, as we steadily scale our service over time just as we’ve done in San Francisco and Phoenix.</p>
<p><b>A service for everyone</b></p>
<p>Our LA riders have fully embraced the convenience and freedom of riding with Waymo One. With the Waymo Driver at the wheel, people are reclaiming their time in LA traffic to be more productive – or not – as they wish. Whether it’s taking extra time to run lines before an audition, filming social media videos, or simply taking a beat to relax, Angelenos are increasingly incorporating Waymo into their daily lives.</p>
<p>As we open our doors to more people, we’re working closely with local community partners aligned with our mission to make roads safer and mobility more accessible. For example, we’re proud to work with She is Hope, a nonprofit dedicated to empowering single mothers in Los Angeles.</p>
<p>“Riding with Waymo was an incredible experience—smooth, safe, and truly impressive,” said Tisha Janigan, founder of She is Hope. “When I rode alone and with some of our single mother families, we were amazed by the driverless technology and the sense of comfort it provided. Access to Waymo could be a game-changer for women we serve, offering a nonjudgmental, reliable transportation option that prioritizes safety.”</p>
<figure><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SAg9jI9EnvM" loading="lazy" allowfullscreen="" height="400" width="400"></iframe></figure>
<p>Waymo’s also proud to serve as the Official Ride-Hail Partner of the <a href="https://laautoshow.com/">Los Angeles Auto Show</a>. If you’ll be in town and attending the show running November 22 - December 1, join us to learn more.</p>
<p>We’re eager for more people to experience the many benefits of fully autonomous driving. To ride in LA, SF, or Phoenix, simply download the <a href="https://waymo.com/waymo-one/">Waymo One</a> app and ride today.</p>
