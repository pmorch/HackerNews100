<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><figure><img alt="Claude 3 " loading="eager" width="2880" height="1620" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://www.anthropic.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww-cdn.anthropic.com%2Fimages%2F4zrzovbb%2Fwebsite%2F4e78f69ef8d4186fb5691714abe36224483d91b0-2880x1620.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 1x" src="https://www.anthropic.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww-cdn.anthropic.com%2Fimages%2F4zrzovbb%2Fwebsite%2F4e78f69ef8d4186fb5691714abe36224483d91b0-2880x1620.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75"></figure><p>Today, we're announcing the Claude 3 model family, which sets new industry benchmarks across a wide range of cognitive tasks. The family includes three state-of-the-art models in ascending order of capability: Claude 3 Haiku, Claude 3 Sonnet, and Claude 3 Opus. Each successive model offers increasingly powerful performance, allowing users to select the optimal balance of intelligence, speed, and <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/api#pricing">cost</a> for their specific application.</p><p>Opus and Sonnet are now available to use in claude.ai and the Claude API which is now generally available in <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/supported-countries">159 countries</a>. Haiku will be available soon.</p><h4>Claude 3 model family</h4><figure><img loading="lazy" width="2200" height="1174" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://www.anthropic.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww-cdn.anthropic.com%2Fimages%2F4zrzovbb%2Fwebsite%2F5d20371eeb8d045465bb22cacfd269b5958b004d-2200x1174.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 1x" src="https://www.anthropic.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww-cdn.anthropic.com%2Fimages%2F4zrzovbb%2Fwebsite%2F5d20371eeb8d045465bb22cacfd269b5958b004d-2200x1174.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75"></figure><h4>A new standard for intelligence</h4><p>Opus, our most intelligent model, outperforms its peers on most of the common evaluation benchmarks for AI systems, including undergraduate level expert knowledge (MMLU), graduate level expert reasoning (GPQA), basic mathematics (GSM8K), and more. It exhibits near-human levels of comprehension and fluency on complex tasks, leading the frontier of general intelligence.</p><p>All <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/claude-3-model-card">Claude 3</a> models show increased capabilities in analysis and forecasting, nuanced content creation, code generation, and conversing in non-English languages like Spanish, Japanese, and French.</p><p>Below is a comparison of the Claude 3 models to those of our peers on multiple benchmarks [1] of capability:</p><figure><img loading="lazy" width="2200" height="1954" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://www.anthropic.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww-cdn.anthropic.com%2Fimages%2F4zrzovbb%2Fwebsite%2F9ad98d612086fe52b3042f9183414669b4d2a3da-2200x1954.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 1x" src="https://www.anthropic.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww-cdn.anthropic.com%2Fimages%2F4zrzovbb%2Fwebsite%2F9ad98d612086fe52b3042f9183414669b4d2a3da-2200x1954.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75"></figure><h4>Near-instant results</h4><p>The Claude 3 models can power live customer chats, auto-completions, and data extraction tasks where responses must be immediate and in real-time.</p><p>Haiku is the fastest and most cost-effective model on the market for its intelligence category. It can read an information and data dense research paper on arXiv (~10k tokens) with charts and graphs in less than three seconds. Following launch, we expect to improve performance even further.</p><p>For the vast majority of workloads, Sonnet is 2x faster than Claude 2 and Claude 2.1 with higher levels of intelligence. It excels at tasks demanding rapid responses, like knowledge retrieval or sales automation. Opus delivers similar speeds to Claude 2 and 2.1, but with much higher levels of intelligence.</p><h4>Strong vision capabilities</h4><p>The Claude 3 models have sophisticated vision capabilities on par with other leading models. They can process a wide range of visual formats, including photos, charts, graphs and technical diagrams. We’re particularly excited to provide this new modality to our enterprise customers, some of whom have up to 50% of their knowledge bases encoded in various formats such as PDFs, flowcharts, or presentation slides.</p><figure><img loading="lazy" width="2200" height="960" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://www.anthropic.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww-cdn.anthropic.com%2Fimages%2F4zrzovbb%2Fwebsite%2F6b66d86ff0c180e95bc6ad2e6e4a1843aa74c80f-2200x960.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 1x" src="https://www.anthropic.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww-cdn.anthropic.com%2Fimages%2F4zrzovbb%2Fwebsite%2F6b66d86ff0c180e95bc6ad2e6e4a1843aa74c80f-2200x960.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75"></figure><h4>Less refusals</h4><p>Previous Claude models often made unnecessary refusals that suggested a lack of contextual understanding. We’ve made meaningful progress in this area: Opus, Sonnet, and Haiku are significantly less likely to refuse to answer prompts that border on the system’s guardrails than previous generations of models. As shown below, the Claude 3 models show a more nuanced understanding of requests, recognize real harm, and refuse to answer harmless prompts much less often.</p><figure><img loading="lazy" width="2188" height="918" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://www.anthropic.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww-cdn.anthropic.com%2Fimages%2F4zrzovbb%2Fwebsite%2Fd1fbcf3d58ebc2dcd2e98aac995d70bf50cb2e9c-2188x918.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 1x" src="https://www.anthropic.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww-cdn.anthropic.com%2Fimages%2F4zrzovbb%2Fwebsite%2Fd1fbcf3d58ebc2dcd2e98aac995d70bf50cb2e9c-2188x918.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75"></figure><h4>Improved accuracy</h4><p>Businesses of all sizes rely on our models to serve their customers, making it imperative for our model outputs to maintain high accuracy at scale. To assess this, we use a large set of complex, factual questions that target known weaknesses in current models. We categorize the responses into correct answers, incorrect answers (or hallucinations), and admissions of uncertainty, where the model says it doesn’t know the answer instead of providing incorrect information. Compared to Claude 2.1, Opus demonstrates a twofold improvement in accuracy (or correct answers) on these challenging open-ended questions while also exhibiting reduced levels of incorrect answers.</p><p>In addition to producing more trustworthy responses, we will soon enable citations in our Claude 3 models so they can point to precise sentences in reference material to verify their answers.<br></p><figure><img loading="lazy" width="2200" height="896" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://www.anthropic.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww-cdn.anthropic.com%2Fimages%2F4zrzovbb%2Fwebsite%2F7cb598c6a9fa58c12b77f67ee2067feaac4a2de0-2200x896.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 1x" src="https://www.anthropic.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww-cdn.anthropic.com%2Fimages%2F4zrzovbb%2Fwebsite%2F7cb598c6a9fa58c12b77f67ee2067feaac4a2de0-2200x896.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75"></figure><h4>Long context and near-perfect recall</h4><p>The Claude 3 family of models will initially offer a 200K context window upon launch. However, all three models are capable of accepting inputs exceeding 1 million tokens and we may make this available to select customers who need enhanced processing power.</p><p>To process long context prompts effectively, models require robust recall capabilities. The 'Needle In A Haystack' (NIAH) evaluation measures a model's ability to accurately recall information from a vast corpus of data. We enhanced the robustness of this benchmark by using one of 30 random needle/question pairs per prompt and testing on a diverse crowdsourced corpus of documents. Claude 3 Opus not only achieved near-perfect recall, surpassing 99% accuracy, but in some cases, it even identified the limitations of the evaluation itself by recognizing that the "needle" sentence appeared to be artificially inserted into the original text by a human.</p><figure><img loading="lazy" width="2200" height="1088" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://www.anthropic.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww-cdn.anthropic.com%2Fimages%2F4zrzovbb%2Fwebsite%2Fd2aa12b60e9c57e7057924bd8878d754c7b3d8e7-2200x1088.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 1x" src="https://www.anthropic.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww-cdn.anthropic.com%2Fimages%2F4zrzovbb%2Fwebsite%2Fd2aa12b60e9c57e7057924bd8878d754c7b3d8e7-2200x1088.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75"></figure><h4>Responsible design</h4><p>We’ve developed the Claude 3 family of models to be as trustworthy as they are capable. We have several dedicated teams that track and mitigate a broad spectrum of risks, ranging from misinformation and CSAM to biological misuse, election interference, and autonomous replication skills. We continue to develop methods such as <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/constitutional-ai-harmlessness-from-ai-feedback">Constitutional AI</a> that improve the safety and transparency of our models, and have tuned our models to mitigate against privacy issues that could be raised by new modalities.</p><p>Addressing biases in increasingly sophisticated models is an ongoing effort and we’ve made strides with this new release. As shown in the model card, Claude 3 shows less biases than our previous models according to the <a href="https://aclanthology.org/2022.findings-acl.165/">Bias Benchmark for Question Answering (BBQ)</a>. We remain committed to advancing techniques that reduce biases and promote greater neutrality in our models, ensuring they are not skewed towards any particular partisan stance.</p><p>While the Claude 3 model family has advanced on key measures of biological knowledge, cyber-related knowledge, and autonomy compared to previous models, it remains at AI Safety Level 2 (ASL-2) per our <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/anthropics-responsible-scaling-policy">Responsible Scaling Policy</a>. Our <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/red-teaming-language-models-to-reduce-harms-methods-scaling-behaviors-and-lessons-learned">red teaming</a> evaluations (performed in line with our <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/07/21/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-secures-voluntary-commitments-from-leading-artificial-intelligence-companies-to-manage-the-risks-posed-by-ai/">White House commitments</a> and the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/10/30/fact-sheet-president-biden-issues-executive-order-on-safe-secure-and-trustworthy-artificial-intelligence/">2023 US Executive Order</a>) have concluded that the models present negligible potential for catastrophic risk at this time. We will continue to carefully monitor future models to assess their proximity to the ASL-3 threshold. Further safety details are available in the <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/claude-3-model-card">Claude 3 model card</a>.<br></p><h4>Easier to use</h4><p>The Claude 3 models are better at following complex, multi-step instructions. They are particularly adept at adhering to brand voice and response guidelines, and developing customer-facing experiences our users can trust. In addition, the Claude 3 models are better at producing popular structured output in formats like JSON—making it simpler to instruct Claude for use cases like natural language classification and sentiment analysis.<br></p><h4>Model details</h4><p><strong>Claude 3 Opus </strong>is our most intelligent model, with best-in-market performance on highly complex tasks. It can navigate open-ended prompts and sight-unseen scenarios with remarkable fluency and human-like understanding. Opus shows us the outer limits of what’s possible with generative AI.</p><div aria-label="data" role="region" tabindex="0"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Cost</strong><em> [Input $/million tokens | Output $/million tokens]</em></td><td>$15 | $75</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Context window</strong></td><td>200K*</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Potential uses</strong></td><td><ul><li>Task automation: plan and execute complex actions across APIs and databases, interactive coding</li><li>R&amp;D: research review, brainstorming and hypothesis generation, drug discovery</li><li>Strategy: advanced analysis of charts &amp; graphs, financials and market trends, forecasting</li></ul></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Differentiator</strong></td><td>Higher intelligence than any other model available.</td></tr></tbody></table></div><p><sup><em>*1M tokens available for specific use cases, please inquire.</em></sup></p><figure><img loading="lazy" width="1148" height="56" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://www.anthropic.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww-cdn.anthropic.com%2Fimages%2F4zrzovbb%2Fwebsite%2F08376f135c37fe029e2aea16fa55c4c83ec77b6b-1148x56.png&amp;w=1200&amp;q=75 1x, https://www.anthropic.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww-cdn.anthropic.com%2Fimages%2F4zrzovbb%2Fwebsite%2F08376f135c37fe029e2aea16fa55c4c83ec77b6b-1148x56.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 2x" src="https://www.anthropic.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww-cdn.anthropic.com%2Fimages%2F4zrzovbb%2Fwebsite%2F08376f135c37fe029e2aea16fa55c4c83ec77b6b-1148x56.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75"></figure><p><strong>Claude 3 Sonnet</strong> strikes the ideal balance between intelligence and speed—particularly for enterprise workloads.

We're also excited to release a series of features to enhance our models' capabilities, particularly for enterprise use cases and large-scale deployments. These new features will include Tool Use (aka function calling), interactive coding (aka REPL), and more advanced agentic capabilities.</p><p>As we push the boundaries of AI capabilities, we’re equally committed to ensuring that our safety guardrails keep apace with these leaps in performance. Our hypothesis is that being at the frontier of AI development is the most effective way to steer its trajectory towards positive societal outcomes.</p><p>We’re excited to see what you create with Claude 3 and hope you will give us feedback to make Claude an even more useful assistant and creative companion.

                 <h2><strong>The Magic of macOS</strong>
</h2>
                 
             
                 <div>Together with macOS, the MacBook Air experience is unrivaled:
</div>
                 
             
                 <div><ul>
<li><strong>macOS Sonoma</strong>: Users can now place widgets right on the desktop, interact with them with just a click, and even access the extensive ecosystem of iPhone widgets on MacBook Air. Video conferencing gets more engaging with great features like Presenter Overlay and Reactions. Profiles in Safari keep browsing separate between multiple topics or projects, while web apps provide faster access to favorite websites. And gaming gets even better with Game Mode.</li>
</ul>
</div>
                 
             
                 <div><ul>
<li><strong>Enhanced productivity</strong>:<strong> </strong>All users, including business professionals, can take advantage of the expansive display on MacBook Air with Split View, or spread out across screens with support for up to two external displays. Features like Stage Manager also help users like students focus on the task in front of them.</li>
</ul>
</div>
                 
             
                 <div><ul>
<li><strong>Better with iPhone</strong>:<strong> </strong>With Continuity,<strong> </strong>MacBook Air works seamlessly across iPhone and other Apple devices. Features like AirDrop allow users to share and receive photos, documents,&nbsp;and more&nbsp;across nearby Apple devices. Universal Clipboard lets users easily copy images, video, or text from an app on one Apple device, and effortlessly paste them into another app on a nearby Mac. Continuity Camera makes it easy for users to scan or take a picture of something nearby with their iPhone and have it appear instantly on their Mac. And Handoff lets them start a task like answering an email on one Apple device and easily finish it on another.</li>
</ul>
</div>
                 
             
                 <div><ul>
<li><strong>Wide array of apps</strong>: MacBook Air comes with powerful apps built in, including FaceTime, Freeform, iMovie, GarageBand, and Photos, as well as productivity apps including Pages, Numbers, and Keynote, making it easy for users to create amazing work. And with thousands of apps optimized for Apple silicon, all of users’ go-to apps run incredibly fast in macOS — including Microsoft 365 and many of their favorite iOS apps.</li>

MacBook Air meets Apple’s high standards for energy efficiency, and is free of mercury, brominated flame retardants, and PVC.

</figure><p>More than one-quarter of scholarly articles are not being properly archived and preserved, a study of more than seven million digital publications suggests. The findings, published in the <i>Journal of Librarianship and Scholarly Communication</i> on 24 January<sup><a href="#ref-CR1" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">1</a></sup>, indicate that systems to preserve papers online have failed to keep pace with the growth of research output.</p><p>“Our entire epistemology of science and research relies on the chain of footnotes,” explains author Martin Eve, a researcher in literature, technology and publishing at Birkbeck, University of London. “If you can’t verify what someone else has said at some other point, you’re just trusting to blind faith for artefacts that you can no longer read yourself.”</p><p>Eve, who is also involved in research and development at digital-infrastructure organization Crossref, checked whether 7,438,037 works labelled with digital object identifiers (DOIs) are held in archives. DOIs — which consist of a string of numbers, letters and symbols — are unique fingerprints used to identify and link to specific publications, such as scholarly articles and official reports. Crossref is the largest DOI registration agency, allocating the identifiers to about 20,000 members, including publishers, museums and other institutions.</p><p>The sample of DOIs included in the study was made up of a random selection of up to 1,000 registered to each member organization. Twenty-eight percent of these works — more than two million articles — did not appear in a major digital archive, despite having an active DOI. Only 58% of the DOIs referenced works that had been stored in at least one archive.

		Singapore Airlines once operated a Concorde between the Lion City and London, but politics and economics meant it didn't last.	</p><div>
		
<p>In the late 1970s and early 1980s, Singapore Airlines operated the world’s most popular supersonic passenger airliner – Concorde – on flights between Singapore and London, as part of a joint venture with British Airways.</p>






<p>The service slashed flying times between Asia and Europe from around 18 hours on subsonic aircraft with multiple stops to under 10 hours, for those who could afford a ticket some 15% more expensive than a First Class fare.</p>

<p>Catering mainly to time-pressed business travellers, celebrities and politicians, the service was short-lived as it suffered from waning demand and rising fuel costs, leading to heavy losses.</p>



<p>Scratch a little below the surface though, and the story of Concorde’s time with Singapore Airlines is a fascinating one, mired in politics of one sort or another from almost start to finish.</p>



<p><strong>Here’s our look back at how the history of SIA’s Concorde operation unfolded.</strong></p>









<h3 id="0-concorde-in-singapore">Concorde in Singapore</h3>



<p>The history of Concorde in Singapore dates right back to 1972. On 8th June that year, <a href="https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/straitstimes19720608-1.2.2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">thousands flocked</a> to Singapore International Airport at Paya Lebar to watch the first Concorde land from Bangkok on its promotional sales tour.</p>



<p>Singapore was seen as a key stopover point for Concorde’s future ambitions to cut travel times from Europe to Australia, so the manufacturer was keen to woo the government and regulators here to ensure smooth permissions would be granted in future, even if SIA itself didn’t buy the jets.</p>

<p>After three days in Singapore the aircraft left for Hong Kong and Tokyo, later flying to Australia before returning via Singapore once again on its way back to Europe.</p>



<h3 id="1-sia-wanted-its-own-concordes">SIA wanted its own Concordes</h3>



<p>In June 1975, six Singapore Airlines cabin crew <a href="https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/straitstimes19750622-1.2.24" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">were handpicked</a> to take part in trials by the aircraft manufacturer, simulating normal passenger service from London to cities like Beirut, Kuala Lumpur, Singapore and Melbourne.</p>



<p>It was a great coup for the airline to demonstrate how SIA’s renowned service could still be offered on a supersonic flight, and by September that year it was reported that <a href="https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/newnation19750927-1.2.2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Singapore Airlines was negotiating to lease two Concordes</a>.</p>



<p>The proposed arrangement would start in 1977, for operation between Australia and Europe via the Lion City. Flight times between Singapore and London would be cut from 18 hours on conventional aircraft at the time to just 10 hours.</p>






<p>With a S$100 million price tag per jet (S$257 million in today’s money), buying the aircraft was <em>“out of the question”</em> according to SIA’s Managing Director Lim Chin Beng, but the carrier was said to be keen if an acceptable lease deal could be forged.</p>



<p>The pair of aircraft would have replaced two Boeing 747s the airline had on option for delivery in 1977 and 1978.</p>

<p>However, that plan never materialised.</p>



<p>Over a year later, in November 1976, British Airways (BA) was negotiating with the Singapore Government to start a London – Bahrain – Singapore service using Concorde, while the airline was still blocked from flying the jet to and from New York – its most desired route.</p>



<p>It was proposed that <a href="https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/biztimes19761103-1.2.51" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SIA would lease 20 out of 100 seats</a> on each of these flights to address <em>“the likely loss of First Class passengers”</em> on SIA’s own London services.</p>



<h3 id="2-india-refused-overflight">India refused overflight</h3>



<p>BA’s problems weren’t isolated to a ‘forced pact’ with SIA on a future Singapore route. It didn’t take long for <strong>politics</strong> to start getting in the way of plans to fly Concorde to and from Asia.</p>



<p>In the late 1970s, India refused permission for Concorde to fly over its airspace, blocking a direct routing from Bahrain to Singapore, BA’s proposed extension to an existing service.</p>



<p>On the table was more access to Heathrow slots for Air India, plus ‘fifth freedom’ traffic rights from the London airport, with the airline keen to tap in to the lucrative transatlantic market. In the 1970s and 80s, it was common for governments to use air traffic agreements as political chess pieces.</p>



<div><p><strong>Sonic Boom </strong>It’s worth mentioning at this point that the problem for Concorde was primarily related to its ‘Sonic Boom’, caused by shock waves when the jet was travelling through the air at Mach 1 or greater. That was no problem for the passengers; sitting on the jet at the head of the ‘Mach cone’, they were moving so fast the sonic boom didn’t have chance to catch up to them.</p><p>
<b>For those on the ground it was a different matter, creating a 100dB+ sound like an explosion.</b></p><p>
That meant supersonic flight by Concorde was restricted to overwater or sparsely populated land masses like deserts. Even that wasn’t perfect though, with Saudi Arabia withdrawing supersonic permission for Concorde after nomads reported the sonic boom was upsetting their camels, stopping them from breeding!</p></div>



<p>Ultimately the two sides agreed to a compromise, with Concorde flights from Bahrain to Singapore having to route around the Indian mainland, adding 200 miles to the journey.</p>



<h3 id="3-joint-venture-with-british-airways">Joint venture with British Airways</h3>



<p>By late 1977 Singapore Airlines was in negotiation with British Airways to jointly operate a Concorde on the London – Singapore route under a cost and revenue-sharing basis. The supersonic trip would <a href="https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/biztimes19770824-1.2.65.1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cut flying time to 10 hours</a>, with only a 40-minute refuelling stop in Bahrain.</p>



<p>Plans included an extension of the route from Singapore to Melbourne, Australia, though this never went ahead.</p>

(Photo: Steve Fitzgerald)</figcaption></figure>



<p>Singapore Airlines formally made an <a href="https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/newnation19771023-1.2.31" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">agreement</a> for the joint venture Concorde operation with British Airways in October 1977, with the inaugural service from Paya Lebar planned for 10th December that year.</p>



<p>As part of the deal, SIA <a href="https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/newnation19771029-1.2.20" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sent 36 of its cabin crew to London</a> in November 1977 for training on Concorde operations.</p>



<p>Tickets could be purchased at BA or SIA offices and cost around 15% more than First Class fares on existing subsonic flights between the two cities.</p>






<p>The one-way fare was S$4,298 (around S$10,700 today) from Singapore to London and S$2,522 (around S$6,300 today) from Singapore to Bahrain.</p>





<p>British Airways said it needed to fill 60 of the 100 seats on board to break even, though the capacity was capped at 86 passengers when departing from Singapore due to the humid conditions affecting the aircraft’s performance.</p>



<p>Even with the inaugural flights fully booked, Singapore Airlines launched a global <a href="https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/biztimes19771202-1.2.75" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">advertising campaign</a> in December 1977, telling the world <em>“SIA has gone supersonic”</em>.</p>

<p>Part of the agreement between Singapore Airlines and British Airways was to operate the Concorde, registered G-BOAD (also temporarily G-N94AD), in a dual livery with Singapore Airlines titles on the left and British Airways colours on the right of the aircraft.</p>

<p>This became the only Concorde to fly with the colours of two different airlines, making SIA only the third airline in the world (after BA and Air France) to have its livery on the type.</p>

<p>With passengers boarding via steps in Singapore in those days, into the forward left main aircraft door, it meant only the SIA livery was visible.</p>



<h3 id="5-the-inaugural-flight-was-almost-scuppered">The inaugural flight was almost scuppered</h3>



<p>Prior to the start of the route, there was a disagreement between British Airways and a small group of its Concorde pilots who were to be stationed in Singapore, over the terms and conditions of their detachment. This was resolved a few weeks before the first flight, but a much bigger problem was looming.</p>



<p>With a Concorde now adorned in Singapore Airlines colours down one side and British Airways livery across the other, and cabin crew from both carriers fully trained to jointly operate the new service, a spanner was suddenly thrown in the works.</p>






<p>At the eleventh hour, on 7th December 1977, the Malaysian Government threatened to hold back overflight rights for the new service. Malaysia had presented no formal reasons to deny Concorde’s overflight of its airspace, indeed the jet had previously routed over the country on demonstration flights and made several landings at Kuala Lumpur’s Subang Airport.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“We were told verbally yesterday by the Malaysian Department of Civil Aviation that overflying rights have still not been granted.</p>



<p>“No reasons have been given, either verbally or in writing.</p>



<p>“We don’t know whether this refers to supersonic or subsonic speed, but if they allow us to fly subsonic, we will do so.</p>



<p>“It will add several minutes to the flying time, but it is not significant.”</p>
<cite>Ted Duggan, British Airways PR Manager for the Orient, 8th December 1977 (via <a href="https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/newnation19771208-1.2.4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">New Nation</a>)</cite></blockquote>



<p>The day before the inaugural flight was due to depart, the Malaysians formally refused all overflight permission for Concorde, subsonic or supersonic.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“The Malaysian authorities have decided to refuse permission for the Concorde flight over Malaysian airspace.”</p>
<cite>Malaysian Communications Ministry (via <a href="https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/straitstimes19771209-1.2.2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Straits Times</a>)</cite></blockquote>



<p>No reason was given, though later a minister said they had to <em>“look into matters affecting the people’s interests and environmental factors”</em>.</p>



<p>Several newspapers in London <a href="https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/biztimes19771210-1.2.4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">were having none of it</a>, stating that the <em>“extremely puzzling”</em> stance was <em>“likely [because] Malaysia is piqued at the operation by Singapore [Airlines] of Concorde service”.</em></p>



<p>An aviation source said of Malaysia’s environmental reasoning <em>“Rubbish, absolute rubbish. The problem is purely political”</em>.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“When Britain first approached Kuala Lumpur earlier this year for permission to fly over Malaysia, the contemplated service would have been wholly British.</p>



<p>“But sources said Malaysia’s objections crystallised when British Airways and Singapore [Airlines] agreed to operate the flight jointly.”</p>
<cite><a href="https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/biztimes19771210-1.2.4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Business Times</a>, 10th December 1977</cite></blockquote>



<p>While the Malaysians were standing firm, the Singapore Government came to the rescue, striking a last-minute deal with Indonesia for the aircraft to route slightly further south than originally planned, through Jakarta’s airspace instead.</p>



<p>The agreement was <a href="https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/newnation19771212-1.2.3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> to have been a reciprocal gesture, following <em>“Singapore’s support for Indonesia during a recent United Nations debate on East Timor”</em>.</p>



<p>The route was saved and the inaugural flight, which had started to look as though it would have to be postponed, took off from London as scheduled on 9th December 1977, to a traditional ceremonial lion dance.</p>

<p>Only 90 passengers could be accommodated instead of the planned 100, due to the additional fuel required when taking the Indonesia routing, while only 70 passengers could travel from Singapore to Bahrain instead of the planned 86, for the same reason.</p>

<h3 id="6-malaysia-stands-firm">Malaysia stands firm</h3>



<p>On 12th December 1977, the day of the second Concorde departure from Singapore to London, authorities revealed a new hiccup.</p>



<p><strong>Indonesia’s overflight permission for the aircraft <a href="https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/straitstimes19771212-1.2.2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was only valid for one week</a>, covering the first three flights.</strong></p>



<p>That’s because the original agreement had been hammered out at a meeting between Singapore officials, British Airways and the Indonesian Directorate General of Air Communications, during an aviation conference taking place in the Lion City a few days earlier. It was therefore regarded as a temporary operational measure, valid only for a week.</p>



<p>Indonesian Government approval was not required, but would be needed for a longstanding agreement beyond the initial flights.</p>






<p>British Airways Captain Tony Meadows, who flew Concorde on its inaugural flight into Singapore from Bahrain on 10th December 1977, was dispatched to Jakarta later that day to assist British officials there <em>“on any issue”</em> related to the flights.</p>


<div>

<p>Meanwhile Gordon Davidson, British Airways Concorde Director, remained in the region rather than returning back to London as planned, and instead headed to the British High Commission in Kuala Lumpur, hopeful a deal could be struck with Malaysia to end the quagmire.</p>



<h3 id="7-indonesia-wouldnt-commit">Indonesia wouldn’t commit</h3>



<p>Not wishing to upset its friendly relations with Malaysia, the Indonesian Government was reluctant to approve further overflight permissions beyond the first three services, potentially leaving Britain and Singapore back at square one.</p>



<p>Striking a deal with Malaysia was seemingly the only option, though British Airways did not seem overly confident.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“If the problem is genuinely environmental, then we should certainly be able to convince them…</p>



<p>“If Malaysia’s decision is based on reasons of professional rivalry, however, then there is nothing we can do about it.”</p>
<cite>British Airways official, 13th December 1977 (via <a href="https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/biztimes19771213-1.2.56" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Business Times</a>)</cite></blockquote>



<p>With the third and final service blessed with Indonesian overflight approval already on its way to Singapore, last-minute talks with Kuala Lumpur were still ongoing. Indonesia said it would only approve overflight <a href="https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/biztimes19771216-1.2.8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">if the Malaysians also did so</a>.</p>



<p>That wasn’t much use to British Airways or Singapore Airlines – they needed agreement from one or the other. The Indonesian stance meant it was all or nothing.</p>



<p>The fourth Concorde flight BA300 departed from London bound for Bahrain and Singapore on Friday 16th December 1977 as planned, <strong>with no one knowing whether it would be allowed to continue its journey</strong> from the Middle East.</p>



<p>Even with Britain suggesting <a href="https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/straitstimes19771215-1.2.2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a compromise</a> ‘interim agreement’ for three months while discussions were ongoing, Malaysia then <a href="https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/straitstimes19771217-1.2.6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reaffirmed their refusal</a> of overflight permission, meaning the Concorde was forced to return to London after arriving in Bahrain that night.</p>



<p>16 passengers who boarded in London destined for Singapore, who were reportedly <em>“very unhappy”</em>, were reaccommodated in First Class on subsonic flights.</p>



<p>Later asked why he had not intervened in the negotiations, instead leaving it to the British, Singapore Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“If I believed that there was anything I could say or write or do that would help, I would have done so.</p>



<p>“There are times where there is nothing one can do better, than to do nothing.”</p>
<cite><meta charset="utf-8">Lee Kuan Yew, December 1977 (via <a href="https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/newnation19771231-1.2.11" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">New Nation</a>)</cite></blockquote>



<p>Fundamentally LKY was right about the issue – it really wasn’t for Singapore or SIA to get involved in what was an agreement purely between the British and the Malaysians. As the Business Times put it:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“SIA is merely the British company’s operating partner. It does not own the Concorde nor has it leased the aeroplane. The entire issue of overflying is therefore solely between Britain and Malaysia.”</p>
<cite><a href="https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/biztimes19780127-1.2.22?ST=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Business Times</a>, January 1978</cite></blockquote>



<h3 id="8-1978-free-advertising">1978: Free advertising!</h3>



<p>With all the political obstacles for overflight permissions related to this route, it would probably have been easy for all parties involved to simply abandon the idea after these three return flights were completed.</p>



<p>British Airways, Singapore Airlines and their respective governments were undeterred, however, and remained fully committed to the concept. <em>“The route will be back”</em>, said one SIA official.</p>






<p>The aircraft’s dual colour scheme, with SIA livery on the left and BA livery on the right, was therefore retained in anticipation of the Singapore route’s return.</p>



<p>That gave SIA the unique opportunity for <strong>some lucrative free advertising</strong> during 1978, with G-BOAD fitting back in to regular BA Concorde operation around the world.</p>

<p>The aircraft regularly visited Bahrain, New York, Washington D.C. and Dallas on scheduled services.</p>



<p>There were even charter flights, including the use of G-BOAD in 1978 on a Barcelona – New York flight for the top customers of a large Spanish bank!</p>



<h3 id="9-malaysia-agreement">Malaysia agreement</h3>



<p>After a series of talks between Britain and Malaysia throughout 1978, most of which came to nothing, a breakthrough was finally reached on 15th December that year.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“On 15 December 1978, one year after the end of the first services the Malaysian Government withdrew its objections to Concorde flights for a trial period.”</p>
<cite>Singapore Airlines statement</cite></blockquote>



<p>Malaysian officials had finally agreed to lift the overflight ban for SIA-BA Concorde services for an initial period of six months, in what SIA’s Managing Director Mr. K. Kulasegaran <a href="https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/biztimes19781216-1.2.9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">described as</a> <em>“terrific news, quite the best I have heard for a long time”</em>.</p>






<p>The decision was reached after a year-long study by Malaysia revealed <em>“no conclusive evidence”</em> that Concorde flights over its airspace would damage the environment. Indonesia also granted joint permission for the service to be reinstated using its airspace on the same basis.</p>



<h3 id="10-1979-services-restart">1979: Services restart</h3>



<p>With an agreement sealed, SQ300/301 (also operated as BA300/301) was back on, with three-times weekly flights restarted from London on Wednesday 24th January 1979 and the first Singapore – London flight operating the following day.</p>

<h3 id="11-the-schedule">The schedule</h3>



<p>The dual-liveried Concorde G-BOAD was a busy aircraft, flying three times a week between London and Singapore in each direction.</p>



<p>Only on Tuesdays did the jet get a decent break, with 48 hours off in London for maintenance downtime from Monday afternoon through to Wednesday afternoon.</p>

<p>The aircraft used a British Airways flight number between London and Bahrain (BA300/301) and a Singapore Airlines flight number between Bahrain and Singapore (SQ300/301). Flight numbers were later changed to BA16/17 and SQ16/17.</p>

<h3 id="13-who-flew-on-concorde">Who flew on Concorde?</h3>



<p>A <a href="https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/straitstimes19800701-1.2.69" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">survey</a> conduced in 1980 revealed that 17% of Concorde’s passengers on the SIN-BAH-LHR route were Singapore residents, 20% were from Australia or New Zealand and the largest group, 38%, were British residents.</p>



<p>Not surprisingly, 77% were travelling for business purposes, with only 18% using the service to take a holiday.</p>



<p>42% of passengers on the route were connecting to another city after arriving in either London or Singapore.</p>



<p>On 24th April 1980, Princess Margaret, younger sister of Britain’s then-Queen Elizabeth II, <a href="https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/biztimes19800425-1.2.2.2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">arrived in Singapore on the joint BA-SIA Concorde</a> service for an official visit. The trip also included the Philippines and Malaysia, with the princess then returning to London on Concorde from Singapore on 8th May 1980.</p>



<h3 id="14-which-crew">Which crew?</h3>



<p>The SIA Concorde was flown exclusively by British Airways pilots and flight engineers. London-based pilots flew the London – Bahrain – London flights, while the airline had a detachment of Singapore-based pilots who flew most of the Singapore – Bahrain – Singapore legs.</p>



<p>In both cases the pilots spent one or two-night rest periods in Bahrain while away from base.</p>



<p><span><strong>Fun fact: </strong>When the joint venture was originally agreed, the plan included some Singapore Airlines pilots going to London <a href="https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/newnation19771029-1.2.20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">for Concorde training</a>, to operate half of the flights, however this did not materialise.</span></p><p>For the cabin crew it was a different matter, with the flights shared between Singapore Airlines and British Airways. The two sets of flight attendants (SQ and BA) would not mix on any single flight, instead alternating on consecutive sectors.</p>



<p>You could therefore have an all-Singapore Airlines crew from Singapore to Bahrain, followed by an all-British Airways crew from Bahrain to Singapore, or vice-versa.</p>



<p>Three flight crew (two pilots and a flight engineer) and four cabin crew operated each Concorde flight.</p>



<h3 id="15-onboard-experience">Onboard experience</h3>



<p>Concorde was a small plane with only 100 seats in a 2-2 configuration. It also had a low ceiling and tiny passenger windows by today’s standards, about the size of an adult hand.</p>



<p>Without the space of large wide-body jets like the Boeing 747, there was certainly no room for large seats or flat beds!</p>






<p>Instead the aircraft’s short flight time on its designed routes like London to New York meant a seat more akin to Premium Economy Class today, with the focus on speed and the distraction of fine dining to pass the little time passengers spent on board.</p>

<p>Indeed Concorde passengers were always generously fed and watered on any journey. Menus included vintage Champagnes like Dom Ruinart 1973 and Mumm Cordon Rouge 1975, cocktails, fine wines, caviar and lobster canapés, plus a selection of opulent main dishes.</p>

<p>All passengers who flew on Concorde received a personal flight certificate, and the joint BA-SIA services were no exception.</p>

<p>The certificate would typically be handwritten and include the signatures of the Captain and other crew members.</p>



<p>With short flight times, Concorde was never fitted with a video in-flight entertainment system. Instead only radio programming was available.</p>

<h3 id="19-further-sia-services-were-planned">Further SIA services were planned</h3>



<p>With the reinstatement of SIA’s London route on Concorde in January 1979, the airline was <a href="https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/straitstimes19790125-1.2.101" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">talking up</a> future routes for the type, once they had data on how well it operated to and from London.</p>



<p>The Financial Times reported that <em>“from Singapore, the possibilities for route expansion are considerable, including flights to such points as Hong Kong, Manila, Seoul [and] Japanese destinations”</em>.</p>



<p>Linking Singapore to Hong Kong with Concorde would have taken only <strong>90 minutes</strong>, while Singapore to Tokyo on the supersonic jet would have cut the flight time from 7 hours to just <strong>3 hours</strong>.</p>



<h3 id="20-singapore-bank-notes">Singapore bank notes</h3>



<p>Having Concorde in the Singapore Airlines livery was a huge marketing point for a young, independent Singapore, and in 1979 the ‘Bird series’ of bank notes included the aircraft on the back of the $20 version.</p>

<h3 id="21-first-year-review">First year review</h3>



<p>By January 1980, a year after regular Concorde services between London and Singapore had restarted, British Airways was <a href="https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/straitstimes19800208-1.2.31" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">expecting a loss</a> of between S$14 million and S$18.5 million on the route for the January 1979 to March 1980 period, with forecasts of a similar deficit in the subsequent year.</p>



<p>At the time, BA was coming under increasing pressure from the new British government to turn a profit, with the state reducing its stake in the carrier.</p>






<p>BA executives were also said to be unhappy with the cost sharing formula they had with Singapore Airlines for the services. Despite SIA and BA sharing operating costs for the flights, including for fuel and crew, a “slide-over fee” had been agreed from the outset to account for SIA’s forecast loss of First Class traffic on its own flights.</p>



<p>This was said to be costing BA S$4.9 million a year, which the British carrier felt was unjustified given SIA’s recorded increase in First Class passenger numbers to and from London.</p>



<p>BA was also <a href="https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/straitstimes19800208-1.2.31" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said to be unhappy</a> with SIA’s lacklustre promotional efforts for the Concorde service, claiming it provided twice as many passengers for the Concorde flights as SIA, despite a 50-50 capacity share.</p>



<p>Despite the issues, SIA and BA <a href="https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/biztimes19800213-1.2.51" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reached an agreement</a> to continue the services, though the “slide-over fee” from BA to subsidise SIA for its loss of First Class subsonic traffic was not reduced.</p>



<h3 id="22-incidents">Incidents</h3>



<p>Despite the SIA Concorde service only operating for a couple of years, there were a few ‘minor incidents’ along the way!</p>


<ul id="ub_styled_list-b8467ba7-9d5e-4279-948d-1ff8305d6302"><p>
<li id="ub-styled-list-item-2a2c69a6-762b-4871-a974-eeb5b2230e4a">On <strong>1st February 1979</strong> the regular London – Singapore Concorde flight was <a href="https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/newnation19790202-1.2.21" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">forced to divert</a> to Kuala Lumpur, when a Singapore Airlines training aircraft burst a tyre and blocked the runway at Paya Lebar. It was only the sixth Concorde service since flights had been reinstated the previous month.</li>

<li id="ub-styled-list-item-78e9d34c-2da9-407d-aea7-64e7f98316e8">On <strong>31st May 1980</strong>, a Concorde flight departing from Paya Lebar on its way to Bahrain and London <a href="https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/newnation19800613-1.2.7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">blew the roof off</a> a family home. Singapore Airlines refused to pay for the damage – claiming British Airways was responsible. BA did not admit liability, but paid the family S$500 (around S$1,100 in today’s money) <em>“to help them out”</em>.</li>

<li id="ub-styled-list-item-0b64aede-1fd9-47b4-a1d7-8a9c8ab484f3">On <strong>21st July 1980</strong>, a British businessman <a href="https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/newnation19800724-1.2.20" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was stabbed in the head</a> by another passenger on a joint BA-SIA Concorde flight from London to Singapore. The SIA cabin crew and other passengers restrained the woman, who had been behaving eccentrically and did not know the man. <em>“I still don’t know why she attacked me, I never saw her before in my life”</em>, the man said.</li>

<li id="ub-styled-list-item-aaf4b143-7ecc-4ba5-8462-62c325b65863">On <strong>22nd July 1980</strong>, the same Concorde flight with the stabbed man(!) <a href="https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/newnation19800724-1.2.20" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hit a flock of birds</a> on its approach to Paya Lebar Airport, which were ingested by two of the four engines. Though the passengers on board were unaware, one of the engines was extensively damaged. A replacement had to be flown out from London, delaying the return service <a href="https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/straitstimes19800725-1.2.64" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">for 30 hours</a>.</li>
</p></ul>


<h3 id="23-the-end-of-concorde-singapore-flights">The end of Concorde Singapore flights</h3>



<p>Despite an earlier agreement to continue the Concorde service, by August 1980 it became clear that not all was well.</p>



<p>There were reports of <a href="https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/newnation19800802-1.2.11" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">only 50% load factors</a> on flights from Singapore, down from 57% the previous year, amid signs the novelty of the service was wearing off.</p>



<p>There were also complaints from passengers about the discomfort of the cabin compared to First Class seats on wide-body jets, with Concorde’s small seats and a much louder environment being far from ideal on a nine-hour trip.</p>



<p>Singapore Airlines and British Airways held further talks, amid rumours of the service now running at a <a href="https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/newnation19800813-1.2.48" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">S$20 million annual loss</a> (equivalent to around S$42 million today), with rising fuel prices adding to the impact.</p>



<p>On 16th September 1980 is was announced that Concorde services to and from Singapore <a href="https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/straitstimes19800916-1.2.2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">would be suspended</a>, effective from 1st November 1980.</p>

<p>The final BA/SIA jointly operated Concorde service departed from Singapore on 30th October 1980. British Airways later flew all Concorde spare parts and equipment back to London.</p>



<p>Though no regular Concorde flights then served the Lion City, a BA charter flight from London to Singapore via Bahrain and Colombo did operate in March 1985.</p>



<p>French President Francois Mitterrand also passed through in September 1986, on his way back to Paris from a state visit in Indonesia, in an Air France Concorde.</p>



<p><strong>These marked the types’s only two visits to Changi Airport, which replaced Paya Lebar as Singapore’s main passenger hub in 1981.</strong></p>



<h3 id="24-what-happened-to-g-boad">What happened to G-BOAD?</h3>



<p>After returning from Singapore for the last time on 30th October 1980, G-BOAD had its Singapore Airlines titles removed and was returned to a full British Airways livery.</p>



<p>The aircraft went on to complete its service with BA, mostly to and from New York which became the airline’s ‘cash cow’ route for the type.</p>






<p>Here are some key facts about G-BOAD:</p>

<p><span><strong>Fun fact: </strong>The aircraft was temporarily registered G-N94AD while operating in conjunction with US-based Braniff Airlines on flights between Washington and Dallas, as an extension of the London – Washington service.

<p>Even if the other exhibits aren’t of interest, you can get up close and personal with G-BOAD, the very Concorde used by Singapore Airlines between 1977 and 1980.</p>

<p>Sadly it’s still in British Airways livery on both sides (SIA would probably have had to <strong>pay</strong> this time for the advertising!).</p>



<p>We were lucky enough to visit during our round-the-world trip in 2018 and it’s well worth a look.</p>

<p>The striking features are the aircraft’s small external size (10% shorter than an A350-900) and very narrow cabin (at 2.62m wide, about the same as an ATR turboprop and less than half that of a Boeing 777).</p>

<p>For the AvGeeks, the flight deck is also pretty cool – a far cry from the two-crew, highly digitised cockpits of today.</p>

<h3 id="26-the-concorde-room">The Concorde Room</h3>



<p>Though it’s no longer possible to fly on Concorde, the name is still used by British Airways for its most exclusive First Class lounges in London and New York. In times gone by, these lounges were reserved exclusively for Concorde passengers, with boarding directly from the lounge itself.</p>



<p>We passed through the London Heathrow Airport Terminal 5 facility in 2018 before flying First Class on BA to Washington, and wrote <a href="https://mainlymiles.com/2019/01/12/review-british-airways-concorde-room-london-heathrow/">a full review</a> of the experience.</p>






<p>The business centre in the lounge even features some of the old seats from BA’s Concordes.</p>

<p>For a while the First Class section of <a href="https://mainlymiles.com/2020/02/21/review-british-airways-singapore-lounge-and-the-bar-singapore/">the British Airways Singapore Lounge</a> was called ‘The Concorde Bar’, however it has since been renamed ‘The Bar Singapore’.</p>



<div id="27-summary"><h3>Summary</h3></div>



<p>As if a joint venture between Singapore Airlines and British Airways doesn’t sound fraught enough, the introduction of Concorde service in a co-operation between the two carriers became quickly mired in political disputes.</p>



<p>These arose from either chess games over air traffic rights, or nationalistic jealousies, though both were commonplace in the late 1970s.</p>



<p>By the time the service truly came to life in 1979 and 1980, jet fuel costs had soared and longer routings owing to continued overflight issues with India were continuing to make the service less and less likely to turn a long-term profit.</p>

<p>Sadly the last regular flight Concorde left Singapore in October 1980, closing a short but fascinating chapter in Singapore Airlines history.</p>



<p>Concorde later went on to become profitable on the North Atlantic between London and New York, with many passengers willing to endure the aircraft’s drawbacks for the short flight time on this lucrative city pair.</p>



<p><strong>Singapore Airlines, meanwhile, can claim to be <meta charset="utf-8">one of only three airlines in the world to have its livery adorn this rare aircraft.</strong></p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://deprogrammaticaipsum.com/twenty-years-is-nothing/">https://deprogrammaticaipsum.com/twenty-years-is-nothing/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39587947">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

		<p>In a <a href="https://deprogrammaticaipsum.com/the-winner-takes-it-all/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">previous edition of this magazine</a>, we argued that English was so pervasive in our industry, nobody even questioned its use anymore. The same can be said of <a href="https://git-scm.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Git</a>. It is difficult to imagine that merely twenty years ago, the landscape of source control tools was more diverse, and the choice of one such tool was much more complicated than today. Actually, Git was not even on the map yet. Before debating whether the hegemony of Git is good or bad, let us go back in time for a little while.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volver_(song)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one of the most famous tangos</a> of all time, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Gardel" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Carlos Gardel</a> famously sings</p>
<blockquote><p>To feel… that life is a breath of fresh air,<br>
that twenty years is nothing,<br>
that, feverish, the gaze<br>
wandering in the shadows<br>
seeks and names you.</p></blockquote>

<p>The second edition of “Code Complete” by <a href="https://deprogrammaticaipsum.com/steve-mcconnell/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steve McConnell</a> was published in 2004. On page 668 of this massive 900-page volume, we find the <em>only</em> reference to the subject of source control in the whole book: about three quarters of a page long. Nothing else. ChatGPT can easily summarize all of it with one phrase: “Version control software is good and brings several big benefits.” Not a lot to phone home about. We are really far from GitOps at this point.</p>
<p>That same year, almost exactly 20 years ago at the time of the publication of this article, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Subversion" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Subversion 1.0</a> saw the light of day. What was Subversion? Probably the shortest lived idea-with-good-intentions in the history of computing. See, Subversion (or <code>svn</code>) was supposed to be a better CVS (no, not the <a href="https://www.cvs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pharmacy</a>, but this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrent_Versions_System" target="_blank" rel="noopener">other thing</a>). “Better than CVS” meant, back in those days, to be transactional (<a href="https://deprogrammaticaipsum.com/issue-61-databases/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">databases</a>, anyone?) and to have a somewhat better support for branches. We did not have higher ambitions back then, kids.</p>
<p>Linus Torvalds, however, did have higher ambitions. In 2004, the Linux kernel developers got in an increasingly strong disagreement over the use of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitKeeper" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BitKeeper</a>, the proprietary, distributed version control system used to manage the kernel source code. So, what is a developer to do? Well, Linus has a tradition of writing the software everybody needs and nobody wants to start. He also has a tradition of <a href="https://www.wordnik.com/words/git" target="_blank" rel="noopener">naming things after himself</a>. Legend says that the first version of Git was <a href="https://www.linuxjournal.com/content/git-origin-story" target="_blank" rel="noopener">written in a couple of weeks</a>.</p>
<h2>CVS</h2>
<p>Never heard of CVS? It was a source control system that Joel Spolsky described in September 2000 as <em>fine</em> (emphasis his) in the first item of his eponymous <a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2000/08/09/the-joel-test-12-steps-to-better-code/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Joel Test</a> for better software:</p>
<blockquote><p>I’ve used commercial source control packages, and I’ve used CVS, which is free, and let me tell you, CVS is <i>fine</i>.</p></blockquote>
<p>Yes, the first step for better software was (shocker!) using source control software. (As a side note, I started my professional career as a software developer in 1997, and nope, we did not use source control, not even CVS. Yes, you guessed right: we just saved VBScript files locally and uploaded them via FTP. Too bad if we overwrote changes with one another: you only live once. I had to wait until 2002 to use a source control system for the first time, and for the curious among you, it was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_ClearCase" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rational ClearCase</a>.)</p>
<p>Never heard of Joel Spolsky? Well, he was the co-creator of Stack Overflow, which I guess you <em>have</em> used at some point in your career. 24 years ago, Joel was one of the first influencers of the burgeoning field of software engineering. Think Kelsey Hightower, but with more controversial views. Or Steve Yegge, but with less controversial views.</p>
<p>Speaking about Stack Overflow, here is an example of the state-of-the-art of source control in 2008. One of the first-ever questions asked on the site, dated September 8th, 2008, asks precisely <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49601/is-there-a-barebones-windows-version-control-system-thats-suitable-for-only-one" target="_blank" rel="noopener">what version control system to use</a> for a single-developer workflow. (Interestingly, that question was asked precisely at the same time while in the real world, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007%E2%80%932008_financial_crisis#2008_(September)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2008 financial crisis</a> was breaking havoc. Our industry lives in a bubble, no doubt about that. But I am digressing, once again.)</p>
<blockquote><p>I’m trying to find a source control for my own personal use that’s as simple as possible. The main feature I need is being able to read/pull a past version of my code. I am the only developer.</p></blockquote>
<p>The replies to the question consist of a long catalog of pretty much every version control system known to mankind at that point in time.</p>
<h2>Windows’ Version Control Odyssey</h2>
<p>But let us return to the year 2000: a few days before Joel Spolsky published his Joel Test, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mark-lucovsky-5280034/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mark Lucovsky</a> gave a talk titled <a href="https://www.usenix.org/legacy/events/usenix-win2000/invitedtalks.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“Windows: A Software-Engineering Odyssey”</a> at the <a href="https://www.usenix.org/legacy/events/usenix-win2000/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">4th USENIX Windows System Symposium</a> in Seattle, Washington. Mr. Lucovsky was a member of the original Windows NT team from 1988 to the mid-2000s. The PowerPoint slides of the talk <a href="https://www.usenix.org/legacy/events/usenix-win2000/invitedtalks/lucovsky_html/Lucovsky.ppt" target="_blank" rel="noopener">are still available online</a> at the time of this writing, and I seriously recommend you take a look at them.</p>
<p>Because part of the “odyssey” was, you guessed it, source control. On slide 14 you can learn that Windows NT 3.51 used an “internally developed” system… which was “on life support” by the time of Windows 2000:</p>
<blockquote><p>To keep a machine in synch was a huge chore (1 week to setup, 2 hours per-day to synchronize)</p></blockquote>
<p>Oops. Not a great way to onboard new team members. Now you know why the <a href="https://agilemanifesto.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Agile Manifesto</a>, published in 2001, was so revolutionary. Thanks to <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Raymond Chen</a>, arguably the most important lecturer of Windows history, <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20180122-00/?p=97855" target="_blank" rel="noopener">we learn the name</a> of said internally developed system:</p>
<blockquote><p>In the early days, Microsoft used a homemade source control system formally called Source Library Manager, but which was generally abbreviated SLM, and pronounced <i>slime</i>. It was a simple system that did not support branching.</p></blockquote>
<p>In slide 24 of Mark Lucovsky’s PowerPoint slides, we learn that Microsoft took the decision to migrate the source code of Windows 2000 to something called “Source Depot”. Raymond Chen <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20180122-00/?p=97855" target="_blank" rel="noopener">agrees</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Shortly after Windows 2000 shipped, the Windows source code transitioned to a source control system known as Source Depot, which was an authorized fork of Perforce.</p></blockquote>
<p>Why Perforce? The choice <a href="https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/a/85891" target="_blank" rel="noopener">had to do</a> with the gigantic size of Microsoft Windows’ source code base:</p>
<blockquote><p>The justification is perhaps less relevant than it once was, but Perforce tends to perform better on large repositories than Subversion. This is one of the reasons Microsoft acquired a source license to Perforce to build Source Depot; NT’s repository is a monster, and not many products, commercial or otherwise, could handle it.</p></blockquote>
<p>Mark Lucovsky’s summarized the benefits of Source Depot in two bullet points on slide 24 of his presentation:</p>
<blockquote><p>• New machine setup 3 hours vs. 1 week<br>
• Normal sync 5 minutes vs. 2 hours</p></blockquote>
<p>Is the Microsoft Windows team still using Source Depot today? Apparently not. In 2017, we learned that Microsoft migrated all 300 GB of Windows source code to Git <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2017/02/microsoft-hosts-the-windows-source-in-a-monstrous-300gb-git-repository/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in an article on Ars Technica</a>, which contains another gem describing the “Microsoft odyssey” in source control systems:</p>
<blockquote><p>Long ago, the company had a thing called SourceSafe, which was reputationally the moral equivalent to tossing all your precious source code in a trash can and then setting it on fire thanks to the system’s propensity to corrupt its database.</p></blockquote>
<p>(I can confirm. Sadly, I should say.)</p>
<p>Microsoft’s adoption of Git, however, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2017/05/90-of-windows-devs-now-using-git-creating-1760-windows-builds-per-day/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was not without hurdles</a>, and led to the creation of the Git Virtual File System (GVFS) project:</p>
<blockquote><p>But Git isn’t designed to handle 300GB repositories made up of 3.5 million files. Microsoft had to embark on a project to customize Git to enable it to handle the company’s scale.</p></blockquote>
<h2>The Age Of Git</h2>
<p>The infatuation of Microsoft with Git reached its peak in 2018, when <a href="https://news.microsoft.com/2018/06/04/microsoft-to-acquire-github-for-7-5-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">it swallowed GitHub</a>, the platform that arguably made Git mainstream. Three years prior, sensing <em>l’air du</em> temps, they had released <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_Studio_Code" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Visual Studio Code</a>, with integrated Git support.</p>
<p>GitHub introduced the concept of Pull Requests to the world <a href="https://github.blog/2008-02-23-oh-yeah-there-s-pull-requests-now/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">as early as February 2008</a>, a feature later adopted and adapted by <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/merge_requests/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitLab</a>, <a href="https://docs.gitea.com/next/usage/pull-request" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gitea</a> (and its recent fork <a href="https://forgejo.org/docs/latest/user/pull-requests-and-git-flow/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Forgejo</a>), and <a href="https://support.atlassian.com/bitbucket-cloud/docs/tutorial-learn-about-bitbucket-pull-requests/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BitBucket</a>, and which became the bread-and-butter for code reviews during the past 15 years. But the matter of fact is that GitHub also created a paradox in the world of Git: suddenly, a distributed source control system… became centralized. Some are understandably <a href="https://blog.edwardloveall.com/lets-make-sure-github-doesnt-become-the-only-option" target="_blank" rel="noopener">aghast</a> by this state of things.</p>
<p>We are in 2024, and Git is everywhere. The long evolution that led to the Git supremacy in the 2010s and, apparently, also the 2020s, can be summarized as a sequence of open-source programs, one replacing the other: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_Code_Control_System" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SCCS</a> in the 1970s, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revision_Control_System" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RCS</a> in the 1980s, CVS in the 1990s, and Subversion in the 2000s. To ensure smooth migration paths, Subversion could import CVS repositories, and Git can import Subversion repositories. But most importantly, version control systems migrated from local-only systems like SCCS and RCS, to client-server architectures (CVS and Subversion), to distributed systems, like Git and others, most notably <a href="https://www.mercurial-scm.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mercurial</a>.</p>
<p>(Speaking about Mercurial, did you know that the Firefox developers recently <a href="https://glandium.org/blog/?p=4346" target="_blank" rel="noopener">decided to drop it</a> and use Git instead?)</p>
<p>These days, we are used to <em>cloning</em> an entire project on our computer, after which we can safely plug it off the network and continue writing software in a completely disconnected way. This simple paradigm was utterly and completely unthinkable 20 years ago. And guess what: your local repository also contains the full history of every single change ever made to your project. This was a feature that, naturally, client-server systems could never provide (spoiler alert: the server had the full history, while clients had only the <code>HEAD</code>, so to speak).</p>
<p>Git (and its cheap branching facilities) had a lasting impact on developer workflows. Vincent Driessen published in January 2010 a seminal article titled <a href="https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“A successful Git branching model”</a> introducing the world to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111007075151/http://scottchacon.com/2011/08/31/github-flow.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">controversial</a> concept of git-flow. Why controversial? Well, because most opinions in the software industry are such. Now there is a <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-github/github-flow" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitHub flow</a> and an <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Atlassian Gitflow workflow</a> and many more branching workflows available.</p>
<p>Git repositories have become eventful, with every push, merge, or tag operation triggering a workflow somewhere. A whole industry has sprung up, including names such as <a href="https://argoproj.github.io/cd/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Argo CD</a>, <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/actions" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitHub Actions</a>, <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/pipelines/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitLab CI/CD pipelines</a>, and <a href="https://about.gitea.com/products/runner/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gitea Runner</a>, providing a new level of automation and convenience. The influence of Git is so strong in this space that the term <a href="https://www.gitops.tech/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitOps</a> now refers to a whole subset of our industry. But you should not be using branches for deployments, <a href="https://codefresh.io/blog/stop-using-branches-deploying-different-gitops-environments/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">you have been warned</a>.</p>
<p>The question is simple now: what comes after Git? At this point, it is probably impossible to challenge the immense popularity of Git. I say “<em>probably</em>” because in our industry, it is impossible to predict the future. There are two interesting contenders worthy of mention: <a title="https://pijul.org/" href="https://pijul.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-from-md="">Pijul</a>, written in Rust (although the project <a title="https://github.com/8l/pijul" href="https://github.com/8l/pijul" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-from-md="">started with OCaml</a> a decade ago) or <a title="https://fossil-scm.org/" href="https://fossil-scm.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-from-md="">Fossil</a>, written by the creators of SQLite. In this last case, the SQLite team provides <a href="https://sqlite.org/whynotgit.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a list of reasons</a> why not to use Git:</p>
<blockquote><p>Let’s be real. Few people dispute that Git provides a suboptimal user experience. A lot of the underlying implementation shows through into the user interface. The interface is so bad that there is even a parody site that generates <a href="https://git-man-page-generator.lokaltog.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fake git man pages</a>.</p></blockquote>
<p>While we wait for a better alternative, let us read the <code>man 7 giteveryday</code> page and call <a href="https://github.com/tj/git-extras" target="_blank" rel="noopener">git-extras</a>, <a href="https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SourceTree</a>, <a href="https://tortoisegit.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TortoiseGit</a>, <a href="https://github.com/tpope/vim-fugitive" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fugitive</a>, <a href="https://codeberg.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Codeberg</a>, and <a href="https://magit.vc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Magit</a> to the rescue. It seems that, whether we like it or not, we will probably be storing our source code in Git repositories for the next twenty years.</p>

<p>On February 14, 2024, the Court of Appeal of Paris issued an order stating that <a href="https://www.orange.com/en">Orange</a>, a major French telecom provider, had infringed the copyight of Entr’Ouvert’s Lasso software and violated the GPL, ordering Orange to pay €500,000 in compensatory damages and €150,000 for moral damages. </p>



<p>This case has been ongoing for many years. </p>



<p>Entr’ouvert is the publisher of <a href="https://lasso.entrouvert.org/">Lasso</a>, a reference library for the Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) protocol, an open standard for identity providers to authenticate users and pass authentication tokens to online services. This is the open protocol that enables single sign-on (SSO). The Lasso product is <a href="https://lasso.entrouvert.org/">dual licensed by Entr’Ouvert under GPL or commercial licenses</a>.</p>



<p>In 2005, Orange won a contract with the French Agency for the Development of Electronic Administration to develop parts of the <a href="http://service-public.fr/">service-public.fr</a> portal, which allows users to interact online with the government for administrative procedures. Orange used the Lasso software in the solution, but did not pass on the rights to its modifications free of charge under GPL, or make the source code to its modifications available.</p>



<p>Entr’Ouvert <a href="https://www.entrouvert.com/actualites/2019/entrouvert-versus-orange/">sued Orange</a> in 2010, and the case wended its way through the courts, turning on, among other things, issues of proof of Entr’Ouvert ‘s copyright interest in the software, and whether the case properly sounded in breach of contract or copyright infringement.</p>



<p>On March 19, 2021, the Appeals Court first rejected Entr’Ouvert’s claims for copyright infringement, saying that the case was a breach of contract claim. The Court of Cassation, which is the supreme court of France, reviewed the case and issued an order on October 5, 2022 overturning the decision of the Court of Appeal. The case was then remanded to the Court of Appeal, which issued its order this week.</p>



<p>The compensatory damages were based on both lost profits of the plaintiff and disgorgement of profits of Orange. Moral damages compensate the plaintiff for harm to reputation or other non-monetary injury.<br></p>



<p><em>Note: I patched this information together from various articles, mostly read in translation. The dates in the lawsuit process were inconsistent in those sources. If I find any errors, I will update this post.</em></p>



<p><em>Update 2/22/24: <a href="https://www.courdecassation.fr/decision/65cdbcdf2425a70008258563">Here</a> is the decision in French.</em></p>

research arm </a><span>of Herman Miller, whose office chairs you can still buy. His story has been told in many places, including the </span><a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304885404579549800874319342" rel="">Wall Street Journal</a><span> (look on archive.ph if you get paywalled on that link).</span></p><p><span>Propst actually invented cubicles to get </span><em>away</em><span> from the open office plans of the day:</span></p><blockquote><p>The offices Propst so loathed were largely open, of the type we now see on "Mad Men": row after orthogonal row of serried desks, where accountants or typists clacked away from 9 to 5, often surrounded by a corridor of closed-door offices for managers and executives.</p></blockquote><p><span>(I can’t help thinking of </span><em><a href="https://genius.com/Gilbert-and-sullivan-a-wandring-minstrel-i-lyrics" rel="">A Wand’ring Minstrel, I</a></em><span> (from </span><em>The Mikado</em><span>) when I hear the word “serried.”)</span></p><p><span>His concept was the “Action Office.” The history.com </span><a href="https://www.history.com/news/why-the-inventor-of-the-cubicle-came-to-despise-his-own-creation" rel="">article</a><span> says</span></p><blockquote><p>There had to be a better way. For Propst, the answer was in the “Action Office,” an office layout that relied on lightweight sitting and standing desks and filing systems. Acoustical panels helped insulate workers from the noise of telephone calls and typing.</p><p>But American offices didn’t exactly take to the new Action Office plan. The components were more geared to individual workers than to large companies that needed to accommodate large numbers of people, and they were hard to put together. And the concept of a completely customizable workspace didn’t sit well with executives who didn’t value the individuality of their workers. Instead, they often purchased the furniture for their own homes rather than placing them in offices. Action Office was beloved by designers—and dismissed by just about everyone else.</p></blockquote><p>This is hilarious if you think about it: the Action Office furniture was too nice to waste on ordinary peons, so the executives took it home instead.</p><p>Propst reworked his design, and Action Office II was the result. It was a smash hit.</p><blockquote><p>Faced with the failure of his first concept, Propst went back to the drawing board and created the Action Office II. The new design took his acoustical panel concept to the next level. The panels became miniature walls of multiple heights that separated each space into its own office without completely cutting a worker off from colleagues. Lightweight and easier to assemble, it made more sense to executives.</p><p>But companies didn’t use the Action Office II, and the many knockoffs it inspired, the way Propst intended. Instead of going for roomy desk spaces with different designs and walls of different heights, they opted for tiny, boxed-in desks instead. They ignored Propst’s vision of a flexible workspace and visual sightlines. Using Propst’s brainchild, cubicles were used to cram even more workers into offices. The office he had invented shrank and shrank until it became impersonal and crowded. The age of the cubicle farm had begun.</p></blockquote><p><span>Propst had an </span><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt15398776/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_1_tt_3_nm_4_q_oppenheimer" rel="">Oppenheimer</a><span> moment when he saw what his invention had turned into (this is the WSJ article again):</span></p><blockquote><p>The real problem isn't the furniture; it is how the furniture represents the arbitrariness of power in the workplace. "The dark side of this is that not all organizations are intelligent and progressive," Propst said two years before he died. "Lots are run by crass people who can take the same kind of equipment and create hellholes. They make little bitty cubicles and stuff people in them. Barren, rathole places…I never had any illusions that this was a perfect world."</p></blockquote><p><span>In 1985, I had a half hour private interview with Eric Schmidt at Sun Microsystems (yes, </span><em>that</em><span> Eric Schmidt). Sun had mostly private offices, maybe shared, and “cubes vs. offices” was a hot topic even then.</span></p><p>I didn’t end up going to work at Sun (I should have, but didn’t), but the one thing I still remember from that interview was that he said (a paraphrase, not an exact quote):</p><blockquote><p>If you look at the total costs of private offices versus cubes, they come out about the same, and economics tells you that they have to. It’s just like owning versus leasing works out to be the same, because the market forces it to.</p></blockquote><p>I also worked at Google in the same building as Eric for a while, and I recalled this event for him. He smiled and said (again, this is a paraphrase):</p><blockquote><p>The one big thing I forgot about that was the value of the employee communications you get with cubes.</p></blockquote><p><span>So that’s the conventional management story in a nutshell: </span><em>We need those random encounters that you get with openness! People in private offices don’t talk to each other.</em></p><p>I’ve heard that argument over and over. It’s even employed to justify getting rid of the cubicle walls and making everything open (like the photo at the top of this article).</p><p><span>It’s utter bullshit and executive fantasy. If you walked around Google and their open offices, almost half the workers are wearing headphones to screen out the noise. Do you just yell over and </span><em>communicate</em><span> with people, like in the executives’ fantasy? No, first you have to wave your hand in front of their face to get their attention.</span></p><p><span>This CNBC </span><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2017/03/15/58-of-high-performance-employees-say-they-need-more-quiet-work-spaces.html" rel="">article</a><span> lays it out:</span></p><blockquote><p>In open environments, executives imagine social collaboration and surreal collision between disparate disciplines. Executives wish for the the next magical idea born from the random chaos of the corporate universe. To executives, easy access means easy sharing and easy success; we should always be able to yell at our coworkers within 25 feet whenever the mood strikes.</p></blockquote><p>At Google (actually, the years when I did work near Eric’s office), the best and most fun working environments I ever had were in shared offices, with walls and a door and a window. Even with three other people in there, it was still better than being out in the open.</p><blockquote><p>Two of my officemates in one of those ended up marrying each other! I didn’t even know anything was going on, which tells you something about their discretion, or maybe my obliviousness.</p></blockquote><p>My personal space allotment got steadily worse at Google. You can’t really blame REWS (Real Estate and Workplace Services) for that; they were forced to cram more and more people into a physical space that expanded very little. At the end, there weren’t even cubicle walls. There was literally nothing that separated my desk from the ones on each side. I hated it.</p><p>I put this question to the Internet Old Farts group on Facebook, which is, as you might guess, mostly older engineers who worked with the Internet when it was new. Many have actually experienced both the old style (private offices around the outside, cubicles in the middle) and the newer open offices. Most younger people have never had a private office.</p><p>In less than a day, it got 103 comments and 37 Likes.

computers. Apparently they still managed to communicate enough to get their work done.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Tom Galloway</strong><span>: IMO, the best layout I ever saw was the old Tech Square MIT AI Lab (*not* the current Geahy monstrosity). Full offices all around the perimeters of the floors; grad students got tiny ones that two would barely fit in (but which had full walls and doors), faculty and research staff got larger solo ones. The key point though was at both ends of the floors were wide open areas, usually called a "Play-something"; playground, playroom, etc. Key aspects were a giant full wall whiteboard, couches and comfy chairs, the location of the floor water and coffee services, where tech reports were, coffee tables with a mix of research publications, newspapers, magazines, comic books, and other light reading, maybe some toys. If you wanted privacy and focus, you went to your office and shut the door. If you wanted to work but were open to interruption, you went to your office and left the door open. If you just wanted to hang out, collaborate, read in the open, etc., you went to a playroom.</span></p></blockquote><p>I replied:</p><blockquote><p>Smokey Wallace, our VP at Oracle (who came from Xerox and DEC) had the same idea: a common area for socializing, plus private offices for solo work.</p></blockquote><p>(Smokey is RIP. May his memory be a blessing.)</p><p>In Smokey’s group, there was a very large common area, with giant whiteboards, sofas, and other amenities that made it a great place to hang out.</p><p>Other answers:</p><blockquote><p>(name redacted) I worked for Smokey at DECWSL in the late 80s. We were lucky to have an office building layout (two different buildings, actually) with lots of windows and offices around the perimeter. Pretty much everyone got a private hardwall office. Some people ended up without a window. Summer interns got their own cube somewhere in the open area. A few contractors ended up sharing offices.</p><p>During my time at PARC CSL (early 90s), things were pretty much the same; researchers got a private office, mostly with windows, or at worst with a window in sight across the hall. Interns and staff were in cubes.</p></blockquote><p>more from that same person:</p><blockquote><p>When I worked at P&amp;G in the late 70s, I was pretty junior, and either had a hard wall office with window shared with another engineer (that was common; managers got a private office), or my own cube in a cube farm (where there were no hardwall offices) depending on the building.</p></blockquote><p>someone else:</p><blockquote><p>This layout is called "caves and commons". It is also used at Xerox PARC. See Chapter 10 in How Buildings Learn by Stewart Brand for more details.</p></blockquote><p>and someone else:</p><blockquote><p>I remember the first time I saw the layout at 666 Technology Pentagram, including the funny first floor (all that wood panelling...) I thought "this is how it should be" - and every time I started a company I considered that layout as something to be built - with the lego lounge and other things in the middle as shared space, and huge white board walls all over the place. wherever possible, hardwall offices for people - I trust them not to "goof off" and I want them to be able to have the right place for that serious concentration that serious work needs.</p><p>the rationale that I keep hearing for open office plans always sounds contrived at best, and some sort of strange torture ritual at worst.</p></blockquote><p>So there you have it: the best office. layout was discovered over 30 years ago, and it’s not cubicles or “open plan.” The conclusion was:</p><blockquote><p>why it's almost as if it's good for people to have choices!</p></blockquote><p><span>Many “knowledge workers” (who can work from home, as the pandemic showed) have an extreme need for personal space. All that “communication” in the open office is actually </span><em>counter-productive</em><span> for them. As the person below says: there are also smells, noise, and unfriendly temperatures to annoy him.</span></p><p>This person, who’ll remain anonymous, sent me a lengthy message, which I’ll excerpt here:</p><blockquote><p>I worked for mostly Universities and private tech companies. Both groups of organizations were absolutely terrible at directing and motivating talent. Working in a noisy, crowded open space was a huge part of that.</p><p>First of all, I hate office spaces. Poorly designed, lots of noise-reflecting surfaces, people always around creating distractions, a complete nightmare for people who have to use their brains. (Also, I acknowledge that I'm a bit sensitive to environmental things while others seem less bothered).</p><p>I'm also very cold-sensitive and found that most offices I was forced to attend had the A/C temp set to about 60 degrees, effectively turning the work environment into a meat freezer.</p><p>Anyway, a few times in my career I actually had my own private office with a door and I loved it. I believe I was spectacularly productive and focused, cuz I could close my  door and read/write/concentrate for hours. Even if these were not my favorite jobs, they wound up being my favorite work environments.</p><p>Then I had many jobs where I was just on some noisy floor that resembled the stock market idiocy from the 1980's. Just phones ringing, people talking, clickety keyboards, and endless rude behavior from people who could "Just walk up to you and interrupt". I hated it and still do.</p><p>Once COVID hit and I could see our offices closing, I moved 800 miles away and began full-time telecommute. Some might say it is lonely or "disconnected" but it has been a boon and major improvement in my life. I have no need to hear chit-chat about others outside lives all day and then struggle to find a few quiet minutes to actually get work done. I can manage my own time, come &amp; go as I please, as long as I get my work done satisfactorily. This is how I think this work should be done. (At least, if you want high quality work).</p><p>I abhor corporate real estate and those who own it. The only reason we have this insane push to get back into offices is because Company Owner's Rich Buddies are crying all the time about their crappy investments and begging CEOs the force us all back into the office.</p><p>I'd choose unemployment, homelessness, or death before going back into an office to work 40+ hours per week. It simply isn't worth it, and it drives my personal performance directly into a ditch.</p><p>All the "Collaboration happens when we're all in the office" is just Business School BS designed to guilt employees back into a life of abject misery. Yeah, I need a 2+ hour commute and stress, plus constant interruption to be "collaborative". Total BS.</p><p>So, I know some others might enjoy an open workspace, or talking with coworkers, but honestly those were the absolute worst parts of my entire career. Always made me wish I worked on a farm or was out digging ditches somewhere. If you know of any $250K/year jobs digging ditches or working on farms, then please let me know.</p><p>I haven't even touched on the jealousy and vindictiveness of hundreds of co-workers, who saw me as a threat and did everything in their power to get me fired or make me look bad. So far, I'm only talking about terrible fluorescent lighting, endless noise that doesn't help concentration, freezing cold air temps designed to store meat long-term, and the general "Forget about getting any work done today" nonsense that is open work environments.</p><p>I had dozens of terrible interactions with other employees, who tried their damndest to make my life miserable. I have ZERO of that with telecommute. Nobody wants to create drama and fight over IM/chat sessions, at least not nearly to the degree of competitiveness and vindictiveness I've seen in office work spaces.</p><p>Once I suffered thru being a Security contractor for the EPA, and their solution for the 8 of us in a Security Operations Center was to cram us all into a closet. I'm not even kidding. It was a 12' by 15' space and we crammed 7 desks in there (one staff was a night guy) and all had to sweat all over each other and breath the same stinky air for months. I finally quit and told them where to shove that job.</p></blockquote><h5>Addendum</h5><p>There are so many responses on the Facebook group that I’m going to have to publish the rest in a followup to this. Those people deserve to be heard, too.</p><p>“Follow the money” is always good practice if you’re diagnosing a business condition, along with “follow the current fad.” Take the rental for a square foot of office space, multiply that by the number of square feet each employee occupies, and you get a big cost. A private office with 80 or 100 square feet costs much more than the space for a desk, chair, and a filing cabinet. In theory, at least, cubicle walls are also simpler to reconfigure than hard office walls.</p><p><em>Although</em><span>: Eric’s “equal costs” argument above is not the only place I’ve heard that.

Private offices were no more expensive than cubeville.</p></blockquote><p><span>I don’t claim any expertise on office costs. Maybe open offices </span><em>are</em><span> cheaper. But consider this: if employees hate them and resist coming in and occupying them, don’t you have to factor that into your cost calculations?</span></p><p>I won’t do a lengthy disquisition on personality types, but there’s a lot of scholarly literature on the subject:</p><ul><li><p><a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Baruch-Keren/publication/263596981_MBTI_Personality_Types_of_Project_Managers_and_Their_Success_A_Field_Survey/links/59dcede8a6fdcc2d9ed30e2f/MBTI-Personality-Types-of-Project-Managers-and-Their-Success-A-Field-Survey.pdf" rel="">MBTI Personality Types of Project: Managers and Their Success: A Field Surve</a><span>y talks about the </span><a href="https://www.16personalities.com/personality-types" rel="">Myers- Briggs Type Indicator</a><span> (MBTI), and so does this:</span></p></li><li><p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170830060321id_/https://sharepoint.louisville.edu/sites/sphis/tlr/Shared%20Documents/Personality%20Type%20Team%20Performance.pdf" rel="">The effect of personality type on team performance</a><span>.</span></p></li></ul><p>The general bias (and of course I’m revealing my own bias here) is: managers and leaders are extroverts and communicators.

<p>
"Torusphere Accelerator", the animation that motivated this article.

</p>
<p>What happens if you take motion blur past its logical extreme? Here are some fun observations and ideas I encountered while trying to answer this question, with an attempt to apply the results in a procedural animation.</p>
<h2>What is motion blur supposed to look like?</h2>
<p>Motion blur started out purely as a film artifact, the result of a subject moving while the camera's shutter is open. This artifact turned out to be desirable, especially for videos, because it improves the perceptual similarity between a video and a natural scene, something I'll dive into in this section.</p>
<p>In a 3D and animation context, it's interesting to note that those two goals - looking natural, and simulating a camera, might not be in agreement, and might result in different motion blurs. I'll keep the simulation aspect as a side note, and ask what the most natural possible motion blur should look like. This can be broken down into a few questions:</p>
<div>
<ol>
<li>How do we perceive a natural moving scene?</li>
<li>How do we perceive this scene reproduced in a video?</li>
<li>What is the perceptual difference between those two cases?</li>
<li>How can video motion blur minimize this difference?</li>
</ol>
</div>
<h3>Perception of motion in a natural scene</h3>
<p>For the purpose of crafting motion blur, we can start by analyzing the very first steps of human vision, where the light hits our retina and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_phototransduction">phototransduction</a> takes place. Under well-lit conditions, this is handled by cone-type cells. Phototransduction is not immediate, and we can model this lag by smoothing out the light stimulus over time.</p>


<div>
	<p><img src="https://www.osar.fr/notes/motionblur/Howlett_et_al_2017_S6.svg"></p>
</div>

	
<p><strong>1. Example of temporal integration in goldfish cones</strong>, taken directly from <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.2001210">Howlett et al. (2017)</a>. Raw stimulus is the number of photons entering the photoreceptor, in this case, a realistic example. The weighting function is derived from the cone's response in different conditions, and can be used to simulate the cone's average temporal integration. The resulting "effective stimulus", while not a measurable response, is a successful first step in modeling the cone's actual photocurrent response.

</p>
<p>Combining the above weighting function's shape with known human cone response times, we can create a detailed simulation of a <em>perceived image</em> based on any input scene. This concept has been <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26357212/">used before</a>, but without the shape of the time response.</p>

	</p>
	
</div>

	
<p><strong>2. Motion Smearing</strong>. Left: Example scene, assumed to be natural and continuous. Right: simulated perceived image. This assumes the viewer is looking at a fixed point, and not tracking the object with their eyes.
</p>
<p>What this shows is that there already exists a natural blur at the photoreceptor level, a phenomenon often called motion smear. So why do we add artificial motion blur in videos, and what is the link between motion smear and motion blur?</p>
<h3>Perception of a scene on a screen</h3>
<p>Let's see what this perceived image looks like when viewing a screen with limited frames per second.</p>


<div>
	<p><img src="https://www.osar.fr/notes/motionblur/shaderfig_2.png">
	</p>
	
</div>

	
<p><strong>3. Perception of a video</strong>. Left: Example scene as it would appear on a screen. Right: perceived image.
</p>
<p>This finally gives us a way of visualizing the usefulness of motion blur. When viewing a video without motion blur, the resulting perceived image looks like overlaid frames instead of the expected motion smear. This situation is improved with a motion blurred video, where each frame no longer shows a moment in time, but an average of all the moments within the time interval covered by this frame. This is analogous to a video made with a camera whose shutter is open for the duration of each frame's timespan. The resulting perceived image looks a lot more similar to the natural case.</p>
<h3>Making the screen natural with a shutter function</h3>
<p>Something still looks off in the perceived image for traditional motion blur. At some object speeds, artifacts still appear as discontinuities in the motion smear. This can be almost eliminated by applying a shutter function: instead of averaging all the moments within a frame, we weight them by a function so that the start and end moments have less weight than the central moment of a frame. The name "shutter function" comes from the analogy to shutter efficiency in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diaphragm_%28optics%29">diaphragm camera</a>, where the shutter takes time to transition between open and closed states. But instead of simulating cameras, the shutter function can be chosen in a way that minimizes the perceptual difference between the screen and a natural scene. The problem then becomes very similar to crafting <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Window_function">window functions</a> in signal processing, and indeed the most popular window functions give very good results.</p>


<div>
	<p><img src="https://www.osar.fr/notes/motionblur/shutter_function.svg"></p>
</div>

	
<p><strong>4. Applying a shutter function</strong>.

</p>
<p>How well does this work? You can get a rough idea in the following demo, which can be switched between motion blur with and without a shutter function. My impression is that the shutter function is not necessary at low speeds, but is noticeably more natural for fast-moving objects<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>. This makes it highly relevant to the "past the logical extreme" experiment I'm aiming for. It also looks smoother in still frames, which is incidental but sometimes relevant.</p>


<div>
	<p><img src="https://www.osar.fr/notes/motionblur/shaderfig_3.png">
	</p>
	
</div>

	
<p><strong>5. Live comparison</strong> of motion blur with and without a shutter function.
</p>
<p>I'll emphasize that this perceptual approach to motion blur is not conventional and could be misguided in some way. The common approach is to simulate cameras, which results in zero time overlap between frames, and often entirely discards moments that fall between frames. Meanwhile, the method I'm describing results in overlapping time-ranges for successive frames. With that out of the way, let's try applying this technique.</p>
<h2>Getting irrational with the torusphere</h2>
<p>To make things both difficult and interesting, I decided to make this infinite motion blur animation as a realtime <a href="https://thebookofshaders.com/01/">shader</a>. Because I like hardship and misery, yes, but mostly because I'd like the end product to be interactive, and in this case, a shader might be the simplest way.</p>
<p>First, how does one render motion blur in realtime? After ruling out multisampling<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup> and analytic ray-traced motion blur<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup>, I settled on a terrible hack best described as "integrated volume motion blur". Represent the moving object as a function that takes coordinates (including time) and returns density (the inside is 1, the rest is 0). Integrate this density function over time, and the result should give you a "motion-blurred density" over any time interval. The result can be rendered by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume_ray_casting">volume ray casting</a>. This method is not photorealistic, but can handle extremely long trails with realtime performance.</p>
<p>The intended animation combines an <strong>orbiting sphere</strong> and a <strong>rotating torus</strong>, both of which need to be motion-blurred up to essentially infinite speed.</p>
<h3>Motion-blurred sphere</h3>
<p>Taking a 2D slice of the orbiting sphere, the problem is reduced to finding the motion-blurred density for an orbiting circle. Let's assume an orbital radius $R$, and a circle of radius $a$. The circle's center is always at a distance of $R$ from the origin, so it can start at the point $(R, 0)$. This means that initially, all points $(x, y)$ on the circle are defined by:</p>
<p>$$
(x - R)^2 + y^2 = a^2
$$</p>
<p>In order to work with the orbit, this should be expressed in polar coordinates $(r,\theta)$, which can be done by substitution:</p>
<p>$$
r^2 - 2 r R \cos\theta + R^2 = a^2
$$</p>
<p>Finding the density function means taking any point, and answering the question: When does this point enter the orbiting circle? When does it exit? The answer lies in the angle coordinate coordinate $\theta$ of the initial object's surface, with the same radial coordinate $r$ as the given point. Because the object is orbiting, this angle is directly related to the time when the object will hit the point. So let's find $\theta$ based on the above definition of the surface:</p>
<p>$$
\theta = \pm\arccos\frac{R^2 + r^2 - a^2}{2 r R}, \theta\in[-\pi,\pi]
$$</p>
<p>The $\pm$ sign comes from the inversion of $\cos$. This $\pm$ is useful, since it determines which half-circle is defined: <span color="green">positive</span> or <span color="red">negative</span> $\theta$. The two halves can be combined to get a polar expression of the density $\rho$ of the corresponding disk:</p>
<p>$$
\rho(r,\theta) = 
\begin{cases}
1 &amp; \text{if }-h(r)\lt\theta\lt h(r) \cr
0 &amp; \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}\\[2ex]
\text{where}\ \ h(r) = \arccos\frac{R^2 + r^2 - a^2}{2 r R}
$$</p>
<p><img alt="disk density from two half-circles" src="https://www.osar.fr/notes/motionblur/half_circles.svg"></p>
<p>From this starting position, the disk is orbiting around the origin. This is equivalent to removing the time $t$ times the speed $v$ from the angle coordinate:</p>
<p>$$
\rho(\colorbox{yellow}{t,}r,\theta) = 
\begin{cases}
1 &amp; \text{if }-h(r)\lt\theta\colorbox{yellow}{- v t}\lt h(r) \cr
0 &amp; \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
$$</p>
<p>We can separate $t$ from the time interval $I$ during which the object is present at a point $(r,\theta)$:</p>
<p>$$
\rho(t, r,\theta) = 
\begin{cases}
1 &amp; \text{if }t\in I \cr
0 &amp; \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}\\[2ex]
I=\left[\cfrac{\theta-h(r)}{v}, \cfrac{\theta+h(r)}{v}\right]
$$</p>
<p>The motion-blurred density is the integral of the density $\rho$ over the current frame's time interval $F$. This works out to be the length of the intersection between $I$ and $F$. This can also be described intuitively: we're measuring how much of the frame's time is occupied by the object at a given point in space.</p>
<p>$$\int_F\rho(t,r,\theta) d t = \int_{F\cap I}1\ d t = |F\cap I|$$</p>
<p>Let's apply a shutter function $s$. For simplicity, assume $s$ is already centered on the current frame's time span. We can apply it by multiplying the density with $s(t)$ before integrating, replacing the need for any bounds of integration of the density. If $s$ has an antiderivative $S$, then the motion-blurred density becomes:</p>
<p>$$
\int\rho(t,r,\theta) s(t) d t =
\int_I s(t) d t = 
S(\max I)-S(\min I)
$$</p>
<p>This can be implemented in a shader and works with any shutter function, however, based on the goals from the first part of this article, shutter functions should have an integral of 1 and should overlap in such a way that the sum of all shutter functions at any timepoint is always 1. This can be satisfied with a trapezoid function, or with a sinusoid function such as this one, used in the animation:</p>
<p>$$
s(t)=\begin{cases}
\cfrac{1-\cos\frac{(t-A)2\pi}{B-A}}{B-A} &amp; \text{if }A\lt t\lt B \cr
0 &amp; \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}\\[2ex]
A=\min F-\frac{|F|}{2},B=\max F+\frac{|F|}{2}
$$</p>
<h3>Motion-blurred torus</h3>
<p>The same process can be followed for the torus. A 2D vertical slice of a torus is called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiric_section">spiric section</a>, or Spiric of Perseus. Aside from sounding like an <strong>epic videogame weapon</strong>, it also has a convenient formulation in polar coordinates. Take a torus of minor radius $a$ and major radius $b$. Take a section at position $c$, and within this section in polar coordinates $(r,\theta)$, all torus points are defined by:</p>
<p>$$
(r^2-a^2+b^2+c^2)^2 = 4b^2(r^2\cos^2\theta+c^2)
$$</p>
<p>Solving for $\theta$, assuming $\theta\in[-\pi/2,\pi/2]$, this becomes:</p>
<p>$$
\theta = \pm\arccos\frac{\sqrt{(a^2 - b^2 - c^2 - r^2 - 2 b c) (a^2 - b^2 - c^2 - r^2 + 2 b c)}}{2 b r}
$$</p>
<p>Once again, the inside of the torus is enclosed between the positive and negative cases of the $\pm$ sign, giving us a polar expression of the density of the solid torus. The remaining steps to get the motion-blurred rotating torus are exactly the same as for the sphere above.</p>

</div>

	
<p><strong>6. Motion-blurred spiric section</strong>.
</p>
<h3>Putting it together</h3>
<p>All that's left is to "draw the rest of the owl" by combining elements in a convincing way, and by using standard volume ray casting on the result. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_%28geometry%29">Surface normals</a> need extra care because there's no such thing as "motion-blurred surface normals", so they're just blended together here.</p>
<p>The animation should run below with basic mouse/touch interaction. It might not work well on all devices, so there's also a pre-rendered video at the top of the page. You can also find <a href="https://www.shadertoy.com/view/cdXSRn">this shader on Shadertoy</a>.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <figure id="attachment_443" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-443"><a href="http://publications.computer.org/annals/wp-content/uploads/sites/36/2018/08/photo6.jpg"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="http://publications.computer.org/annals/wp-content/uploads/sites/36/2018/08/photo6-200x300.jpg" alt="Dame Stephanie Shirley" width="236" height="354"></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-443">Dame Stephanie Shirley</figcaption></figure>
<p>In the realm of computing pioneers,&nbsp;Dame Stephanie “Steve” Shirley is one of the most celebrated, not only for building a $3 billion tech empire in 1960s England, but for doing it with an all-female, work-from-home staff of professionally qualified women who had left the work force after marrying and having children.</p>
<p>Having hit the glass ceiling herself many times, Shirley set out to establish her own software enterprise for women, built by women. She and her employees pioneered the idea of women going back into the work force after a career break, and promoted flexible work methods, job sharing, profit-sharing, and company co-ownership.</p>
<p>Born Vera&nbsp;Buchthal in 1933 in Dortmund, Germany, she fled Nazi Europe through the&nbsp;Kindertransport rescue effort orchestrated before the start of WWII.</p>
<p>She lived with foster parents in Sutton Coldfield, England, and attended&nbsp;Oswestry Girls’ High School. Unfortunately, her school did not teach mathematics, so she took classes at the local boys’ school.</p>
<p><span><a href="https://ieeecompsac.computer.org/2019/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Attend COMPSAC, the IEEE Computer Society’s signature Conference on Computers, Software and Applications.</strong></a></span></p>
<p>Later in life, she founded a work-from-home contract programming company in 1962 exclusively for women called “Freelance Programmers” that eventually employed over 8,500 people. The company grew rapidly and went public in 1996. Ultimately,&nbsp;her company was valued at $3 billion, making millionaires of 70 of her team members.</p>

(Photo credit: steveshirley.com)</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Shirley’s company was responsible for programming the black box for the supersonic Concorde. She and her employees were also instrumental in helping develop software standards, management control protocols, and other standards that were eventually adopted by NATO.</p>
<p>But building a huge corporation in post-war Britain came with its own unique challenges.&nbsp;<a href="http://mariehicks.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Marie Hicks</a>, professor of history at the <a href="https://www.wisc.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">University of Wisconsin at Madison</a>, interviewed Shirley for a 2018 article on behalf of the <a href="http://www.computerhistory.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Computer History Museum</a>. She explored Shirley’s early life, influences, flair for math, business acumen, and ambition.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.computer.org/csdl/mags/an/2018/01/man2018010006.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shorter version of the interview</a>, edited by&nbsp;Dag Spicer of the Computer History Museum, appears in the <em>IEEE Annals of the History of Computing.&nbsp;</em>The original transcript with Hicks’ full interview may be accessed <a href="http://www.computerhistory.org/collections/catalog/102738707" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here.</a></p>
<p>Here are some of the more thought-provoking quotes from that interview: How she started a company for women, how she escaped the Nazis, how she got her first job, how she began her career, how she soldiered through discrimination, and how she donated a fortune to autism research while raising an autistic son.</p>

<h2>How&nbsp;Dame Stephanie Shirley started a company just for women</h2>
<figure id="attachment_445" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-445"><img decoding="async" src="http://publications.computer.org/annals/wp-content/uploads/sites/36/2018/08/photo18-300x200.jpg" alt="Dame Stephanie Shirley and Queen Elizabeth" width="300" height="200"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-445"><em>Dame Stephanie Shirley with Queen Elizabeth.</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>“My business was very special. It was a woman’s company in the computer industry; 297 of the first 300 staff were all women.</p>
<p>“It was really a female-friendly organization. It was set up as a crusade rather than to make money, and indeed it took a long time before it did make any money, and I was very proud eventually when it succeeded that I’d set up this special women’s company. Again, another first, I thought, because I have to justify my existence.”</p>
<h2>On escaping the Nazis</h2>
<p>“It is as strong today as it was 75 years ago, when, as a traumatized, weeping five-year-old, I was put on a train and sent to a strange country with strange languages, strange people, strange parents, strange food. It would’ve been disastrous, I think, had I not been with my older sister, a nine-year-old who was really not ready yet to care for a younger sibling,” Shirley said.</p>
<p>“But what that two-and-a-half-day transition between Vienna and the Liverpool Street Station in London did for me was it made me able to cope with change, and I think that’s relevant to my technical career.”</p>

<h2>On forging her career</h2>
<p>“A lodger that my mother had knew somebody who knew somebody who worked at the Post Office Research Station, and I had a similar introduction to another corporation and had interviews at both.</p>
<p>“The first one, General Electric Company, was fine and so on, but they were not terribly interested in me, in my future, in my continuing training and education, and so although they offered me a job, I went with the Post Office because they clearly were interested in ongoing education.”</p>

<h2>On changing her name from “Stephanie” to “Steve”</h2>
<figure id="attachment_71818" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-71818"><a href="https://ieeecs-media.computer.org/wp-media/2019/04/22180433/photo5.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://ieeecs-media.computer.org/wp-media/2019/04/22180433/photo5-300x300.jpg" alt="photo5" width="236" height="236" srcset="https://ieeecs-media.computer.org/wp-media/2019/04/22180433/photo5-300x300.jpg 300w, https://ieeecs-media.computer.org/wp-media/2019/04/22180433/photo5-150x150.jpg 150w, https://ieeecs-media.computer.org/wp-media/2019/04/22180433/photo5-100x100.jpg 100w, https://ieeecs-media.computer.org/wp-media/2019/04/22180433/photo5.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 236px) 100vw, 236px"></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-71818">Derek and Stephanie Shirley at their wedding.

<p>“I had already launched my own business when I began to become professional. Not just relying on introductions but actually going out and marketing and getting new business, and in a very naive way I was writing literally dozens of letters, introducing my company’s services, and getting absolutely no reply whatsoever.</p>
<p>“It was my dear husband of now 50 years who actually suggested, ‘Well, perhaps it’s the name.’ I was writing with this double feminine, Stephanie Shirley, Shirley being my marital name. He asked, ‘Why don’t you use the family nickname of Steve?’ so I wrote exactly the same letters as Steve Shirley, and I began to get some replies.”</p>

<h2>On employing gays and lesbians</h2>
<p>“When the company was small, we knew a lot about each other’s families. I knew which child had gotten measles. When it came to gay and lesbian people, we might’ve guessed. It probably wouldn’t have been something that we talked about. It wasn’t relevant to our mobility, which was something that we were always very interested in. It’s clear that we did attract many lesbian staff; we employed thousands of people over the years, of course.”</p>
<h2>On how the private sector gave women more opportunities</h2>
<p>“Nobody could say I couldn’t do this if the rule book said that I could. In my generation of women, there were many things you couldn’t do. One college that I attended part-time didn’t have washroom facilities for women.</p>
<figure id="attachment_455" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-455"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="http://publications.computer.org/annals/wp-content/uploads/sites/36/2018/09/erniedamesteveshirley-230x300.jpg" alt="Shirley with ERNIE" width="250" height="326"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-455"><em>Shirley was one of two non-engineers who worked on ERNIE, a new breed of random-number machine.

(Photo credit: steveshirley.com).</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>“My job actually would’ve entailed me going onto a cable laying ship [a&nbsp;deep-sea&nbsp;vessel&nbsp;designed to lay&nbsp;underwater cables&nbsp;for telecommunications or electric power transmission] and I couldn’t do that. Women just did not go on working ships. I couldn’t work on the stock exchange.</p>
<p>“I could write software for the London Stock Exchange, but I couldn’t actually work there myself. Couldn’t drive a bus, couldn’t fly an airplane. These were legislative things, and the public sector was very firm on things like that….”</p>
<h2>Shirley’s life after retirement</h2>
<p>Since retiring, Shirley has spent her time supporting various IT-related causes and, most recently, organizations researching and providing services to those with autism.</p>
<p>Her interest in autism has personal roots.</p>
<p>“I’ve moved to a certain extent away from computing and become really a manager, a businesswoman, and later with the need to care for my learning disabled, autistic son, into really a career, and then a philanthropist. That’s now what I do. I try to give money away in a wise way,” says Shirley.</p>
<h2>On what she chose as her philanthropy</h2>
<p>“Autism is a strange disorder. It’s known to be genetic, but we don’t really know very much about it. What we do know is that it’s difficult to deal with, and difficult for the people with autism.</p>
<figure id="attachment_456" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-456"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="http://publications.computer.org/annals/wp-content/uploads/sites/36/2018/09/photo11-300x300.jpg" alt="shirley and giles" width="300" height="300"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-456"><em>Stephanie Shirley and her only son, Giles. She became a philanthropist for autism because he was diagnosed with the condition. (Photo credit: steveshirley.com)</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>I’ve set up several charities in the autistic field and so my experience is through them.</p>
<p>“A child that is dashing about in all directions could today be wearing a Fitbit bracelet to see what’s going on there. They could well be monitored how they’re sleeping, when they’re sleeping and so on. They could be using fingerprints as access keys, because child protection is very important with these very, very vulnerable pupils. Many of them are using iPads to communicate.</p>
<p>“Back in 1982—I remember the year because it was the International Year of Disabled People—I was starting to talk about using computers as a communication aid, as distinct from process control or calculations, to help the blind to see, the deaf to hear. Communication is vitally important for people with autism, so there’s a whole host of things.”</p>
<h2>Shirley’s short film in a Google series on the early days of computing</h2>
<p>Produced by Google as part of a series of short films highlighting women’s involvement in the early days of computing, “Freelance Programmer: the story of Dame Stephanie Shirley” features Shirley’s inspirational story in her own words. The YouTube channel that features this and many other stories is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/computingheritage/feed" target="_blank" rel="noopener">computingheritage</a>.</p>

                <div> 

                      <p>We all have pet peeves, even though&nbsp;there’s a lot going on in the world that makes them&nbsp;pretty insignificant. While acknowledging that there are many more important things in life, I write this post about my own personal illustration pet peeve in the hopes that maybe, just maybe, it’ll make a little teeny difference. Here goes:</p>
<p>I love butterflies. They’re one of my favorite subjects to illustrate and one of my favorite sights in nature. To me, they’re a symbol of hope, an embodiment of beauty, and a sign of what’s right in the world. I think that’s why it bothers me when&nbsp;depictions of butterflies often fail to&nbsp;do them justice, whether they are&nbsp;in a work of art, a website, a product, an animation, or in print.</p>
<p>My explanation needs to begin with a description of&nbsp;a dead&nbsp;butterfly. When a butterfly is placed in an insect collection, the person who prepares it positions its wings&nbsp;according to a convention that facilitates identification. In the photo of a dead, pinned butterfly&nbsp;below, note&nbsp;that the trailing edge of the forewings (blue line) is perpendicular to the body’s axis (red line). When the insect has just been killed, it remains flexible for awhile, allowing the collector&nbsp;time&nbsp;to insert a pin and manipulate its wings into this position, where they are held in place until they become dry and stiff.&nbsp;This is an unnatural position for the wings;&nbsp;it’s a pose that may be possible&nbsp;for the insect to assume in life, but not a position that most species typically assume.</p>

<p>In field guides&nbsp;and other butterfly reference materials, one frequently sees images of such pinned butterflies&nbsp;because, I presume, it is easy to photograph a dead butterfly. Also,&nbsp;numerous photos of dead butterflies against the same background is aesthetically consistent, and the pinned&nbsp;position allows the viewer to see as much of the hind wings as possible, aiding&nbsp;identification. It is a useful convention and it makes sense&nbsp;in&nbsp;field guides.</p>
<p>By contrast, butterflies that are alive and going about their business of flying and nectaring do not typically hold their forewings too far forward of their head.&nbsp;In life, the way a butterfly holds its&nbsp;wings is variable, but it is uncommon for most species that I’ve encountered to hold their forewings in the manner of pinned specimen. Here are some photographs I’ve taken over the years that demonstrate this:</p>

<p>As you can see, in most cases, it is the <em>leading</em> edge of the forewings that is nearly perpendicular to the body. One will notice quite a bit of variability in wing positions in living butterflies, but it’s atypical&nbsp;for the trailing edge of the forewings to be perpendicular to the body. This is true not only of butterflies that are perched, but also of butterflies aloft. As an example, view this<a href="http://www.gettyimages.ca/license/138307199" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">&nbsp;photo of monarchs in flight</a>. There are exceptions, of course. It seems that some of the smaller butterflies may exhibit wing positions fairly close to that of a dead, pinned specimen:</p>

<p>I suspect that the&nbsp;field guide&nbsp;photos of dead, pinned butterflies are the ultimate (though unwitting)&nbsp;source of&nbsp;my pet peeve: The pervasive phenomenon of butterflies in popular culture being shown as dead, with the trailing edge of their forewings perpendicular to their body. Here are some examples:</p>
<p>You can see <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/eoskins/9975461605" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">at this link</a> that the practice of illustrating dead butterflies goes back a long way, in a painting by a 19th century artist.</p>
<p>A particularly ironic&nbsp;example is <a href="https://www.scarce.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Flight-of-butterflies-film-poster.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this movie poster</a> for a documentary about the flight of monarchs. Some of the flying monarch&nbsp;illustrations&nbsp;are accurate, but the largest and many&nbsp;of the others are clearly dead, even though they’re depicted as if in flight.</p>
<p>Stock photography sites include misleading photos of dead butterflies&nbsp;purporting to be in flight. Here’s<a href="http://www.istockphoto.com/ca/photo/monarch-butterflies-in-various-flying-positions-isolated-on-white-gm185302115-19288861?st=_p_monarch%20butterfly" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> one</a>. Here’s <a href="https://www.dreamstime.com/stock-photo-monarch-butterfly-flying-beautiful-isolated-white-background-image46588423" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">another</a>. It’s understandable that customers&nbsp;would accept the description as accurate, even though it isn’t.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.askideas.com/50-amazing-3d-butterfly-tattoos/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">This website </a>shows numerous&nbsp;butterfly tattoos.&nbsp;Only a few look alive, despite the tattoo artists’ clever&nbsp;technique&nbsp;of inking&nbsp;cast shadows to give the impression that the butterflies are actually perched on the skin. Had the recipients of dead butterfly tattoos known the difference between a living and a dead butterfly, I have to believe they would&nbsp;have more carefully considered their options. I think a depiction of a living butterfly is the most effective way&nbsp;to convey its positive symbolism.</p>
<p>Dead butterflies are frequently spotted in gift shops. You can rest your head against them, adorn your ears with them, hang them on your wall, enoy&nbsp;them while you sip a beverage, wrap your gifts with them, or wear them:</p>

<p>I have blurred a couple company names in the photos above because I’m not trying to shame anyone. Most people have seen and are influenced by&nbsp;thousands (millions?) of depictions of unintentionally dead butterflies and have never considered&nbsp;the difference between a living and a dead butterfly. That’s why I decided to write this post.</p>
<p>I’m not innocent of committing my own pet peeve.&nbsp;In 2001, I illustrated the endangered Karner Blue butterfly using pinned specimens&nbsp;as a reference:</p>

<p>Had I realized&nbsp;then what I know now, I would have changed the wing and leg positions to be more lifelike. It would have made for a better representation, even though I&nbsp;was not attempting to show the insects in flight or perched on a flower. Nowadays, if you ask me to illustrate a butterfly, I will position its wings&nbsp;as if it is&nbsp;alive:</p>

<p>I realize there are some instances where it isn’t clear that the artist/designer intended to show a living butterfly, and where it may be perfectly acceptable to represent a dead butterfly. Nonetheless, there’s no good reason to depict a dead butterfly in the vast majority of situations. It doesn’t take much effort to be accurate about wing position. My hope is that the multitudes of butterfly images in our culture will gradually shift toward alive, which is how I prefer to think of&nbsp;them, and how I think these beautiful insects should be seen.</p>
<p>If you hadn’t previously noted the difference between a living and a dead butterfly, I’m afraid&nbsp;you will now begin to see dead butterflies EVERYWHERE, as I do.</p>

location of western australia: the ambient nighttime minimum was getting down to 
2-3 degrees above zero (celsius).</p>
<p>using a box-cooker with a black base, i poured about half a centimeter deep 
of water into the bottom of the cooker and put it outside at night. the glass 
lid had to be removed as glass is opaque to infrared and would inhibit the 
cooling. i put the cooker (<i>uncooker</i>?) in a location where it saw a 
maximum amount of sky and no trees or buildings (on the roof of my house). </p>
<p>the sky needed to be clear all night, with still air. i was using rainwater 
as the town water contained additives which may have lowered the freezing point. 
i would set the alarm clock for about 5am, get out of bed and climb onto the 
roof in the near dark (unfun) and remove a solid disk of ice from the now <i>
uncooker</i> (much fun). i got ice consistently over several nights, even though 
there was no frost on the ground, and pots of water sitting next to the box 
cooker did not freeze.</p>
<p>i tried the same experiment again this past summer using a smaller box-cooker 
in a different location (bridgetown, wa). it was difficult to get a sight away 
from trees. i was unable to make ice, and the water was only getting about 4 
degrees celsius below ambient. however, when my gas fridge died a few years ago 
i built a radiant fridge which works well: i got a dead fridge from the tip and 
lay it on its back (like a chest freezer) on the south side of my shed (for 
daytime shade). i super-insulated it with layers of aluminum foil and straw, 
held together with some iron sheeting held in place with star pickets driven 
into the ground (a very rough bush job) after sundown i leave the lid open. the 
inside of the lid is reflective so that when it is lifted at night and rests on 
my shed wall it lets the fridge 'see' more sky, rather than the warm shed. </p>
<p>when i get up in the morning i close the lid to keep the cool in during the 
day. i have kept a log of the temperatures down there, but i'm writing from 
perth so don't have them with me. but typically during summer the ambient 
temperature would be in the low 30's and my fridge would not rise above 16 
degrees. it gets a degree or two below ambient during clear nights, on cloudy 
nights it stays a little above ambient (due to thermal inertia), on rainy nights 
my food gets wet. i have been using this arrangement for a few years for keeping 
provisions fresh and beer cool and am quite happy with it.</p>
<p>i can see as much use for radiant fridges as there is for solar cookers 
around the world and hope that other people take up on this. it uses the same 
technology and principles as solar cooking (permitting the exchange of heat by 
radiation whilst blocking the exchange by conduction) and can be made with the 
same low level of technology.</p>

      <p><span>U.S. Department of Commerce Publishes Proposed Rule Imposing “Know Your Customer” and Reporting Requirements on U.S. Infrastructure as a Service Providers</span>

    </p>
  </div><div>
  
    
      <p><span>Thursday, February 1, 2024</span>

    </p>
  </div><div><div>
<p>The U.S. Department of Commerce (“Commerce”), Bureau of Industry and Security (“BIS”) recently issued a <a href="https://www.bis.doc.gov/index.php/documents/about-bis/newsroom/press-releases/3443-2024-01-29-bis-press-release-infrastructure-as-as-service-know-your-customer-nprm-final/file">proposed rule</a>&nbsp;aimed at preventing foreign actors from utilizing U.S. Infrastructure as a Service (“IaaS”) products (i.e., cloud computing services) to engage in malicious cyber-enabled activity, specifically by imposing certain due diligence and reporting requirements on U.S. IaaS providers and their foreign resellers. The January 29, 2024,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2024/01/29/2024-01580/taking-additional-steps-to-address-the-national-emergency-with-respect-to-significant-malicious">Notice of Proposed Rule Making</a>&nbsp;(“NPRM”) follows&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2021/01/25/2021-01714/taking-additional-steps-to-address-the-national-emergency-with-respect-to-significant-malicious">Executive Order ("EO") 13984</a>&nbsp;(“Taking Additional Steps To Address the National Emergency With Respect to Significant Malicious Cyber- Enabled Activities”), issued by President Trump in January 2021, and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2023/11/01/2023-24283/safe-secure-and-trustworthy-development-and-use-of-artificial-intelligence">EO 14110</a>&nbsp;(“Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Development and Use of Artificial Intelligence”), issued by President Biden in October 2023. BIS has invited the public to submit comments on the proposed rule by April 29, 2024.</p>
<p>The proposed rule, which would amend the Information and Communications Technology and Services (“ICTS”) regulations (15 C.F.R. Part 7), focuses on three central policy objectives:</p>
<ol>
<li>Requiring U.S. IaaS providers and their foreign resellers to implement a Customer Identification Program (“CIP”);</li>
<li>Empowering the U.S. Department of Commerce to prohibit or restrict access to U.S. IaaS products by certain foreign persons or persons in certain foreign jurisdictions; and</li>
<li>Requiring U.S. IaaS providers and their foreign resellers to report known instances of foreign persons training large artificial intelligence models “with potential capabilities that could be used in malicious cyber-enabled activity” (e.g., social engineering attacks or denial-of-service attacks).</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Customer Identification Program</strong></p>
<p>The proposed rule requires all U.S. providers of U.S. IaaS products to create, implement, and maintain an appropriately tailored, written CIP—akin to the “know your customer” (“KYC”) information that banks maintain. The primary purpose of the CIP is to verify whether potential customers and beneficial owners are foreign or U.S. persons, and to verify the identities of potential foreign customers and their beneficial owners.</p>
<ol>
<li><em><strong>CIP Identification Procedures</strong></em></li>
</ol>
<p>At minimum, U.S. IaaS providers must gather and retain specific identifying information from potential foreign customers and foreign beneficial owners to verify their identity, including their:</p>
<ul>
<li>Name;</li>
<li>Address;</li>
<li>Means and source of payment;</li>
<li>Email address;</li>
<li>Telephone number; and&nbsp;</li>
<li>“IP address(es) used for access or administration and the date and time of each such access or administrative action.”</li>
</ul>
<p>Similar to the anti-money laundering regulations administered for financial institutions under the Bank Secrecy Act, the BIS proposed rule defines “beneficial owner” as an individual who “exercises substantial control over a [c]ustomer or owns or controls at least 25 percent of the ownership interests of a [c]ustomer.”</p>
<p>The proposed rule seems to suggest that providers should assume all potential customers and beneficial owners are non-U.S. persons until the aforementioned identifying information is collected and assessed. If a provider verifies that “the potential customer and all beneficial owners are U.S. persons,” the provider need not engage in further verification procedures. (The proposed rule defines U.S. persons as U.S. citizens, U.S. lawful permanent residents, U.S.-incorporated entities and their foreign branches, and persons located in the United States.)</p>
<p>If, however, the provider has collected all requisite information and determined that the potential customer and beneficial owner[s] are non-U.S. persons or entities, the provider must then confirm the identity of the potential foreign customer and foreign beneficial owner through selected documentary or non-documentary identity verification procedures.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the provider “doubt[s] the true identity of a potential [foreign] customer” and foreign beneficial owner—or cannot verify the identity of such—the provider must obtain further information, “including signatories, to verify the potential [foreign] customer’s [or foreign beneficial owner’s] identity.”</p>
<p>The proposed rule also requires CIPs to outline next steps if an IaaS provider cannot verify the identity of a potential foreign customer or foreign beneficial owner. At minimum, the CIP must include:</p>
<ul>
<li>“When the IaaS provider should not open an account for the potential customer;”</li>
<li>“The terms under which a customer may use an account while the IaaS provider attempts to verify the identity of a customer or beneficial owner of the account, such as restricted permission or enhanced monitoring;”</li>
<li>“When the IaaS provider should close an account or subject it to other measures, such as additional monitoring . . . after attempts to verify the identity of a customer or beneficial owner of the account have failed;” and</li>
<li>“Other measures for account management or redress for customers whose identification could not be verified or whose information may have been compromised.”</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, IaaS providers must retain all identifying information relied upon to verify the identity of a foreign customer or foreign beneficial owner for a period of no less than “two years after the date the IaaS account is closed or the date the account was last accessed.”</p>
<p>To facilitate comprehensive oversight, the proposed rule also requires that CIPs include certain “risk-based procedures” requiring:</p>
<ol>
<li>“Customer[s] notify the IaaS provider when the customer adds beneficial owners to its account;” and</li>
<li>“Periodic continued verification of the accuracy of the information provided [to the IaaS provider] by the customer.”</li>
</ol>
</div>
<p>The proposed rule requires U.S. providers to flow through the above requirements to their foreign resellers. If a provider becomes aware that its foreign resellers are not complying with the requirements of the rule, the U.S. IaaS provider must “terminate the reseller relationship within 30 calendar days” and “report the suspected or [known] malicious cyber-enabled activity discovered to relevant authorities.”</p>
<div>
<ol start="2">
<li><em><strong>CIP Reporting Requirements</strong></em></li>
</ol>
<p>The proposed rule requires&nbsp;U.S. IaaS providers and their foreign resellers&nbsp;to submit a CIP certification form to Commerce detailing, in relevant part:</p>
<ul>
<li>&nbsp;A description of the identity verification procedures used by the provider;</li>
<li>The resources used by the provider to detect malicious cyber activity;</li>
<li>The provider’s procedures for ensuring its foreign resellers maintain an appropriate CIP;</li>
<li>Contact information for the person responsible for managing the CIP;&nbsp;</li>
<li>The number and locations of IaaS customers;</li>
<li>“The number and locations of the IaaS provider’s foreign beneficial owners;”</li>
<li>“A list of all foreign resellers of IaaS products;” and</li>
<li>“The number of IaaS customer accounts held by foreign customers whose identity has not been verified.”</li>
</ul>
<p>Thereafter, U.S. IaaS providers and their related foreign resellers must submit annual CIP certifications attesting the provider has:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reviewed its CIP in the year since its last certification;</li>
<li>Incorporated relevant updates into its CIP concerning “changes in its service offerings;”</li>
<li>Updated its CIP to incorporate changes in the cyber threat landscape;</li>
<li>Ensured its CIP is in compliance with the regulations; and</li>
<li>“Recorded the resolution of each situation in which the IaaS provider was unable to verify the identity of a customer since its last certification.”&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>Providers are expected to update Commerce “outside of the normal reporting schedule . . . [if, for example,] a significant change in business operations or corporate structure has occurred or a material change to a CIP [including a change to the primary contact responsible for the CIP] has been implemented.” The reference to a change in “corporate structure” is interesting, and raises the question as to whether Commerce might expect providers to notify Commerce of an acquisition or significant investment into the company. (Commerce may clarify this point in a final rule.)</p>
<p>Further, new providers of IaaS products must submit a completed CIP certification form to Commerce prior to granting IaaS account access to any foreign customer.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li><em><strong>Compliance Assessments</strong></em></li>
</ol>
<p>To guarantee compliance with the proposed rule, Commerce will review all information submitted by U.S. IaaS providers and their related foreign resellers in annual CIP certification forms. If a CIP fails to meet the requirements set forth above, Commerce may:</p>
<ol>
<li>Conduct a compliance assessment of certain IaaS providers; or</li>
<li>Audit the “provider’s CIP processes and procedures.”</li>
</ol>
<p>Following a compliance assessment or audit, Commerce may:</p>
<ol>
<li>Recommend certain remediation measures; and</li>
<li>“Review a specific transaction or a class of transactions” carried out by an identified IaaS provider.</li>
</ol>
<p>IaaS providers are expected to maintain a written copy of both their CIP and their foreign resellers’ CIPs, and “must provide any copy of these CIPs to [Commerce] within ten calendar days of a request from [Commerce].”</p>
<ol start="4">
<li><em><strong>CIP Exemptions</strong></em></li>
</ol>
<p>An IaaS provider may apply for an exemption from the CIP requirement by demonstrating that it has established an appropriate Abuse of IaaS Products Deterrence Program (“ADP”) aimed at “detect[ing], prevent[ing], and mitigat[ing] malicious cyber enabled activities.”</p>
<p>The Secretary of Commerce considers the following, “in consultation with the Secretary of Defense, the Attorney General, the Secretary of Homeland Security, and the Director of National Intelligence,” when determining whether to issue an exemption:</p>
<ol>
<li>Whether the ADP is of “an appropriate size and complexity;”</li>
<li>Whether the ADP incorporates a “robust” ability to “deter, detect, and respond to red flags;”</li>
<li>Whether the provider maintains “effective” oversight of reseller arrangements;</li>
<li>The extent to which the provider voluntarily cooperates with law enforcement; and</li>
<li>Whether the provider participates in public-private sector collaborations meant to “develop and maintain privacy-preserving data sharing and analytics to enable improved detection and mitigation of malicious cyber-enabled activities.”</li>
</ol>
<p>Once an exemption is granted, the IaaS provider and its foreign resellers must regularly update their ADP to incorporate the “changing threat landscape” and must notify the Secretary of Commerce of any “significant deviations or changes to their ADP.”</p>
<p><strong>Special Measures for Certain Foreign Jurisdictions or Foreign Persons</strong></p>
<p>The proposed rule authorizes the Secretary of Commerce to prohibit or limit, for a period of 365 days unless extended, IaaS transactions with:</p>
<ol>
<li>Certain foreign persons who have “engaged in a pattern of malicious cyber-enabled activities;” or</li>
<li>Persons located in certain foreign jurisdictions which have a “significant number of foreign persons offering . . . or directly obtaining U.S. IaaS products for use in malicious cyber-enabled activities.”</li>
</ol>
<p>If the Secretary of Commerce issues a written determination barring or limiting interactions with a certain foreign person or jurisdiction, U.S. IaaS providers must incorporate the special measures no earlier than 180 days following the determination.</p>
<p><strong>Reporting Certain Large AI Model Training</strong></p>
<p>In an effort to secure the development and use of artificial intelligence (“AI”), the proposed rule requires U.S. IaaS providers and their foreign resellers to report known instances of foreign persons training “large AI models with potential capabilities that could be used in malicious cyber-enabled activity” to Commerce.</p>
<p>If a U.S. IaaS provider becomes aware of a transaction concerning a foreign person which:</p>
<ol>
<li>“Results or could result in the training of a large AI model with potential capabilities that could be used in malicious cyber-enabled activity;” or</li>
<li>“[While] the original arrangements provided for in the terms of the transaction would not result in [the aforementioned training,] a development or update in the arrangements means the transaction now does or could result in the training of a large AI model with potential capabilities that could be used in malicious cyber-enabled activity,”</li>
</ol>
<p>the provider must file a report with Commerce, including relevant information about the foreign person and training run, within 15 days of the “transaction occurring or the provider or reseller having knowledge” of the prohibited transaction. U.S. IaaS providers may refer to the examples provided in § 7.308 for additional information.</p>
<p>A U.S. provider of IaaS products may not provide products to a foreign reseller who does not comply with identified reporting requirements.</p>
<p><strong>Key Takeaways</strong></p>
<p>The proposed rule by Commerce reflects an effort to secure the American cyber frontier, particularly in relation to the development of artificial intelligence. The following aspects and implications of the proposed regulations are notable:</p>
<ul>
<li>The proposed rule would institute a CIP requirement for U.S. IaaS providers akin to the “know your customer” requirements applicable to banks, introducing a complex compliance protocol that will require resources and lead time.</li>
<li>&nbsp;Under the proposed framework, companies can seek an exemption from the CIP requirement by adopting an ADP and applying to Commerce for an exemption.</li>
<li>Under the proposed rule, U.S. companies newly seeking to become IaaS providers would need to adopt a CIP before starting business as a provider.</li>
<li>The proposed rule’s reporting requirements regarding foreign persons’ use of IaaS products to engage in certain AI training would impose a significant monitoring obligation on providers.</li>
<li>The proposed rule would require U.S. providers to flow the CIP and reporting requirements through to foreign resellers.</li>
<li>The stakes of noncompliance would be high, with violations punishable under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, which provides for civil penalties of up to the greater of ~$368,000 per violation or twice the value of the transaction connected to the violation, or criminal penalties of up to $1 million and/or 20 years’ imprisonment.</li>
<li>Notably, Commerce is proposing to implement the rules by amending the ICTS regulations, which otherwise are focused on threats to the U.S. technology supply chain. The technology should monitor developments relating to these rules, as they likely will be an important vehicle for technology regulation in the months and years to come.</li>
<li>Commerce is also considering imposing controls on the use of U.S. export-controlled advanced computing items to provide cloud services for use in training large AI models. This is an important part of the policy conversation and should be part of the risk calculus for companies in the industry.</li>
<li>Affected or interested parties may submit comments on the proposed regulations until April 29, 2024.</li>

<p>At work, one of the things I do pretty often is write print generators in HTML to recreate and replace forms that the company has traditionally done handwritten on paper or in Excel. This allows the company to move into new web-based tools where the form is autofilled by URL parameters from our database, while getting the same physical output everyone's familiar with.</p>

</pre></div><p>I will explain why I choose <code>margin: 0</code> in the later section about margins. You should use Letter or A4 as appropriate for your relationship with the metric system.</p>
<p>Setting the size and margin of @page is not the same as setting the width, height, and margin of your <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> element. @page is beyond the DOM — it contains the DOM. On the web, your <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> element is bounded by the edges of your screen, but when printing it is bounded by @page.</p>
<p>The settings controlled by @page more or less correspond to the settings you get in your browser's print dialog when you press Ctrl+P.</p>

</pre></div><p>Here's how that looks in the browser:</p>
<p><img alt="" loading="lazy" src="https://voussoir.net/writing/css_for_printing/sample_in_browser.png" title="but i don't want new chrome"></p>
<p>And here are the results of some different @page values:</p>
<p><code>@page { size: Letter portrait; margin: 1in; }</code>:</p>
<p><img alt="" loading="lazy" src="https://voussoir.net/writing/css_for_printing/letter_portrait_1in.png"></p>
<p><code>@page { size: Letter landscape; margin: 1in; }</code>:</p>
<p><img alt="" loading="lazy" src="https://voussoir.net/writing/css_for_printing/letter_landscape_in1.png"></p>
<p><code>@page { size: Letter landscape; margin: 0; }</code>:</p>
<p><img alt="" loading="lazy" src="https://voussoir.net/writing/css_for_printing/letter_landscape_0.png"></p>
<p>Setting the @page size won't actually put that size of paper into your printer's feed tray. <a href="https://youtu.be/3z9YjGWaxC0" title="Office Space - PC Load Letter?">You'll have to do that part yourself</a>.</p>
<p>Notice how when I set <code>size</code> to A5, my printer stays on Letter, and the A5 size fits entirely within the Letter size which gives the appearance of a margin even though it's not coming from the <code>margin</code> setting.</p>
<p><code>@page { size: A5 portrait; margin: 0; }</code>:</p>
<p><img alt="" loading="lazy" src="https://voussoir.net/writing/css_for_printing/a5_portrait_0.png"></p>
<p>But if I tell the printer that I have actual A5 paper loaded, then it looks as expected.</p>
<p><img alt="" loading="lazy" src="https://voussoir.net/writing/css_for_printing/a5_portrait_0_a5paper.png"></p>
<p>From what I gather by experimentation, Chrome only follows the @page rule if you have Margin set to Default. As soon as you change Margin in the print dialog, your output is instead the product of your physical paper size and the chosen margin.</p>
<p><code>@page { size: A5 portrait; margin: 0; }</code>:</p>
<p><img alt="" loading="lazy" src="https://voussoir.net/writing/css_for_printing/a5_portrait_0_default.png"></p>
<p><img alt="" loading="lazy" src="https://voussoir.net/writing/css_for_printing/a5_portrait_0_none.png"></p>
<p>Even when you choose a @page size that fits fully within your physical paper, the <code>margin</code> still matters. Here, I make a 5x5 square with no margin, and a 5x5 square with margin. The size of the <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> element is bounded by the @page size <strong>and</strong> margin combined.</p>
<p><code>@page { size: 5in 5in; margin: 0; }</code>:</p>
<p><img alt="" loading="lazy" src="https://voussoir.net/writing/css_for_printing/5in_5in_0.png"></p>
<p><code>@page { size: 5in 5in; margin: 1in; }</code>:</p>
<p><img alt="" loading="lazy" src="https://voussoir.net/writing/css_for_printing/5in_5in_1in.png"></p>
<p>I did all these tests not because I expect to print on A5 or 5x5 paper, but because it took me a while to figure out what exactly @page is. Now I am pretty confident in always using Letter with margin 0.</p>

<p>There is a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media">media query</a> called <code>print</code> where you can write styles that only apply during printing. My generator pages often contain a header, some options, and some help text for the user that obviously shouldn't come out on the print, so this is where you add <code>display:none</code> on those elements.</p>
<div><pre><span>/* Normal styles that appear while you are preparing the document */</span>

<p>The reason I always set @page <code>margin: 0</code> is that I'd rather handle the margins on the DOM elements instead. When I tried to use @page <code>margin: 0.5in</code>, I would often accidentally wind up with double-margins that squash the content smaller than I expected, and my one-page design spilled onto a second page.</p>
<p>If I wanted to use @page margin, then the actual page content would need to be laid out all the way up against the edges of the DOM, which is harder for me to think about and harder to preview before printing. It is mentally easier for me to remember that <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> occupies the entire physical paper and my margins are within the DOM instead of beyond it.</p>
<div><pre><span>@</span><span>page</span>
<span>{</span>

</pre></div><p>When it comes to multi-page print generators, you're going to want a separate DOM element representing each page. Since you can't have multiple <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;body&gt;</code>, you're going to need another element. I like <code>&lt;article&gt;</code>. Even for single-page generators, you may as well always use an article.</p>
<p>Since each <code>&lt;article&gt;</code> represents one page, I don't want any margins or padding on <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;body&gt;</code>. We're pushing the logic one step further — it is easier for me to let the article occupy the entire physical page and put my margins within it.</p>
<div><pre><span>@</span><span>page</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>size</span><span>:</span> <span>Letter</span> <span>portrait</span><span>;</span>
    <span>margin</span><span>:</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>

<span>article</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>width</span><span>:</span> <span>8.5</span><span>in</span><span>;</span>
    <span>height</span><span>:</span> <span>11</span><span>in</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</pre></div><p>When I talk about adding margin within my article, I'm not using the <code>margin</code> property, I'm using <code>padding</code>. That's because <code>margin</code> goes outside and around your element in the box model. If you use a <code>margin</code> of 0.5in, you'll have to set the article to 7.5×10 so that the article plus 2×margin equals 8.5×11. And if you want to adjust that margin you'll have to adjust the other dimensions.</p>
<p>Instead, <code>padding</code> goes on the inside of the element, so I can define the article to be 8.5×11 with 0.5in padding, and all the elements inside the article will stay on the page.</p>
<p>A lot of intuition about element dimensions is easier when you set <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/box-sizing"><code>box-sizing: border-box</code></a>. It makes it so that the outer dimensions of the article are locked in while you adjust the inner padding. This is my snippet:</p>

<p>Once you've got your articles and margins set up, the space inside the article is yours to do with as you please. Design your document using whatever HTML/CSS you feel is appropriate for the project. Sometimes this means laying out elements with flex or grid because you've been given some leeway with the output. Sometimes it means creating squares of a specific size to fit on a certain brand of sticker paper. Sometimes it means absolutely positioning absolutely everything to the millimeter because the user needs to feed a special piece of pre-labeled paper through the printer to get your data on top of it, and you're not in control of that special paper.</p>
<p>I'm not here to give a tutorial on how to write HTML in general, so you'll need to be able to do that. All I can say is be mindful of that fact that you're dealing with the limited real estate of a piece of paper, unlike a browser window which can scroll and zoom to any length or scale. If your document will contain an arbitrary number of items, be ready to paginate by creating more <code>&lt;article&gt;</code>.</p>

<p>A lot of the print generators I write contain tabular data, like an invoice full of line items. If your <code>&lt;table&gt;</code> is large enough to go onto a second page, the browser will automatically duplicate the <code>&lt;thead&gt;</code> at the top of each page.</p>
<div><pre><span>&lt;</span><span>table</span><span>&gt;</span>

<p>That's great if you're just printing a <code>&lt;table&gt;</code> with no frills, but in a lot of real scenarios it's not that simple. The document I'm recreating often has a letterhead on the top of each page, a footer on the bottom, and other custom elements that need to be explicitly repeated on each page. If you just print a single long table across pages, you don't have much ability to place other elements above, below, and around it on intermediate pages.</p>
<p>So, I generate the pages using javascript, splitting the table into several smaller ones. The general approach here is this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Treat the <code>&lt;article&gt;</code> elements as disposable and be ready to regenerate them at any time from objects in memory. All user input and configuration should take place in a separate header / options box, outside of the articles.</li>
<li>Write a function called <code>new_page</code> that creates a new article element with the necessary repeating header/footer/etc.</li>
<li>Write a function called <code>render_pages</code> that creates the articles from the base data, calling <code>new_page</code> every time it fills up the previous one. I usually use <code>offsetTop</code> to see when the content is getting far along the page, though you could <strong>definitely</strong> use smarter techniques to get the perfect fit on each page.</li>
<li>Call <code>render_pages</code> whenever the base data changes.</li>

<p>I've shown that the @page rule helps inform the browser's default print settings, but the user can override it if they want to. If you set @page to portrait mode and the user overrides it to landscape mode, your layout and pagination might look wrong, especially if you are hardcoding any page thresholds.</p>
<p>You can accommodate them by creating separate <code>&lt;style&gt;</code> elements for portrait and landscape, and using javascript to switch between them. There might be a better way to do this, but at-rules like @page behave differently than normal CSS properties so I'm not sure. You should also save some variable that can help your <code>render_pages</code> function do the right thing.</p>
<p>You could also stop hardcoding thresholds, but then I'd have to follow my own advice.</p>

<p>There are a couple of ways to get your data onto the page. Sometimes, I pack all of the data into the URL parameters, so the javascript just does <code>const url_params = new URLSearchParams(window.location.search);</code> and then a bunch of <code>url_params.get("title")</code>. This has some advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>The page loads very fast.</li>
<li>It's easy to debug and experiment by changing the URL.</li>
<li>The generator works offline.</li>
</ul>
<p>This also has some disadvantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>The URLs become very long and unweildy, people cannot comfortably email them to each other. See sample links at the top of this article.</li>
<li>If the URL does get sent in an email, that data is "locked in", even if the source record in your database changes later.</li>
<li>Browsers do have limits on URL length. The limits are pretty high but not infinite and might vary per client.</li>
</ul>
<p>Sometimes I instead use javascript to fetch our database records over the API, so the URL parameters just contain the record's primary key and maybe a mode setting.</p>
<p>This has some advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>The URLs are much shorter.</li>
<li>The data is always fresh.</li>
</ul>
<p>and disadvantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>The user has to wait a second while the data is being fetched.</li>
<li>You have to write more code.</li>
</ul>
<p>Sometimes I set <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/contenteditable"><code>contenteditable</code></a> on the articles so the user can make small changes before printing. I also like to use real, live checkbox inputs they can click before printing. These features add some convenience, but in most cases it would be wiser to make the user change the source record in the database first. Also, they limit your ability to treat the article elements as disposable.</p>

<p>Atom­ic physi­cist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niels_Bohr">Niels Bohr</a> is famous­ly quot­ed as say­ing, “Pre­dic­tion is very dif­fi­cult, espe­cial­ly if it’s about the future.” Yet despite years of get­ting things wrong, mag­a­zines love think pieces on where we’ll be in sev­er­al decades, even cen­turies in time. It gives us com­fort to think great things await us, even though we’re long over­due for the per­son­al jet­pack and moon colonies.</p>

<p>And yet it’s Asi­mov who appar­ent­ly owned the only set of post­cards of <em><a href="http://publicdomainreview.org/collections/france-in-the-year-2000-1899-1910/">En L’An 2000</a></em>, a set of 87 (or so) col­lectible artist cards that first appeared as inserts in cig­ar box­es in 1899, right in time for the 1900 World Exhi­bi­tion in Paris. Trans­lat­ed as “France in the 21st Cen­tu­ry,” the cards fea­ture Jean-Marc Côté and oth­er illus­tra­tors’ inter­pre­ta­tions of the way we’d be living…well, 23 years ago.</p>


<p>The his­to­ry of the card’s pro­duc­tion is very con­vo­lut­ed, with the orig­i­nal com­mis­sion­ing com­pa­ny going out of busi­ness before they could be dis­trib­uted, and whether that com­pa­ny was a toy man­u­fac­tur­er or a cig­a­rette com­pa­ny, nobody seems to know. And were the ideas giv­en to the artists, or did they come up with them on their own? We don’t know.</p>

<p>One of the first things that stands out scan­ning through these prints, now host­ed&nbsp;at <em><a href="http://publicdomainreview.org/collections/france-in-the-year-2000-1899-1910/">The Pub­lic Domain Review</a></em>, is a com­plete absence of space trav­el, despite Jules Verne hav­ing writ­ten <em><a href="http://jv.gilead.org.il/pg/moon/">From the Earth to the Moon</a></em> in 1865 (which would influ­ence Georges Méliès’ <em><a href="http://www.openculture.com/2013/08/a-trip-to-the-moon-and-five-other-free-films-by-georges-melies-the-father-of-special-effects.html">A Voy­age to the Moon</a></em> in 1902). How­ev­er, the under­wa­ter world spawned many a flight of fan­cy, includ­ing a whale-drawn bus, a cro­quet par­ty at the bot­tom of the ocean, and large fish being raced like thor­ough­bred hors­es.</p>

<p>There are a few inven­tions we can say came true. The “Advance Sen­tinel in a Heli­copter” has been doc­u­ment­ing traf­fic and car chas­es for decades now, fed right into our tele­vi­sions. A lot of farm work is now auto­mat­ed. And “Elec­tric Scrub­bing” is now called a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLt5rBfNucc">Room­ba</a>.</p>

<p>For a card-by-card exam­i­na­tion of these future visions, one should hunt out Isaac Asimov’s 1986 <em><a href="http://amzn.to/1OvGupZ">Future­days: A Nine­teenth Cen­tu­ry Vision of the Year 2000</a></em>, which can be found on Ama­zon right now. (Or see the nice gallery of images at <em><a href="http://publicdomainreview.org/collections/france-in-the-year-2000-1899-1910/">The Pub­lic Domain Review</a></em>.) And who knows? Maybe next year, your order will come to your door by drone. Just a pre­dic­tion.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
	
		<div>
		<p>I’m a child of a therapist. What that means is that I was expertly listened-to most of my life. And then, wow, I met the rest of the world.</p>
<p>This is a skill that need not be rare. After all, one unquestionably unique human attribute—that no other animal seems to be capable of—is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_mind">desire to link our minds</a>. We want to know what the other is thinking. We want to know what our whole species thinks (written language) and has learned (school). And yet, minds are not directly observable. We have to talk about them. We have a seemingly endless interest in stories, because there is information there we crave—how to be. Sharing stories of events and people, whether real or fictional, synchronizes our values, provides (perceived) control over this insane world via meaning and causal explanations, and creates—not reinforces, but <i>creates</i>—the basic, primal social bond humans have as we, as listeners, all tune into to one point of attention.</p>
<p>It’s a good thing for our survival. It’s what makes this whole civilization thing possible, these linked minds. So why are so many people still so bad at listening?</p>
<p>One reason is this myth: that the good listener just listens. This egregious misunderstanding actually leads to a lot of bad listening, and I’ll tell you why: because a good listener is actually someone who is <i>good at talking.</i></p>
<p>I realized this as I was writing down some of the best advice for becoming a good listener. You know the obvious no-brainer ones already—don’t interrupt, don’t look at your phone, make (frequent, but not creepily constant) eye contact, turn your body towards the speaker…but the really good advice, the secrets that will make you much better at listening to a degree that your relationships are significantly more successful, peaceful, gratifying, intimate, and trusting, have to do with what you <i>say.</i></p>
<p>Try these out, please. See if I’m right.</p>
<h3><b>1. Let people feel their feels.</b></h3>
<p>Let’s say the person is sad, maybe even wise enough to say “I’m sad,”—the first thing to not do is respond with “don’t be sad!” It’s true that the person <i>shouldn’t</i> be sad. But, the first step in getting over an emotion is to own it. For a while. Don’t tell the person she isn’t feeling it, or worse, make her feel ashamed of having the feeling (i.e. “that’s crazy!”). The feeling is there. Face it and it will lose its power.</p>
<p>Some simple and powerful phrases to use when someone is feeling feels: “I hear you.” “I bet it is hard.” “That makes sense.” Ones to strike from your vocabulary: “You have no reason to feel that way.” “Don’t be silly!” “I’m sad/mad/whatever too!” (see #5).</p>
<h3><b>2. Check your own emotions.</b></h3>
<p>Especially if the person is angry and attacking you. It’s time for you to be the non-angry one. Take a good look at this person’s face. It’s a face of someone who is hurt. Maybe saying things unrelated to the hurt.</p>
<p>Replace all of the shocking, mean, hateful, incorrect, ignorant, offensive, cruel things coming out of this person’s mouth with “I’m hurt! I’m hurt! I’m hurt! I’m hurt. I’m hurrrrt.” Summon your best pity, then disengage. END this moment with “I’ll be up for talking another time about this if you want.” Don’t say “…when you are less angry.” It will make the person angrier.</p>
<p>Really put your foot down that you won’t engage. Don’t allow lies you want to correct, or generalizations you want to protest, or insults you want to decry, or any angry words to manipulate you into engaging. This is not a real conversation. Real conversations and problem solving don’t happen in yells or insults.</p>
<p><em>Note: if this happens regularly with one particular person, it might be time end this relationship.</em></p>
<h3><b>3. Talk to children as if they are people.</b></h3>
<p>Don’t let “what do you want to be when you grow up?” be the first thing you say to a child. It reinforces the message that children, in the eyes of all the adults they meet, have no real value until they grow up.</p>
<p>Ask instead what the child is interested in now—favorite books, hobbies, subjects in school, etc. If it’s a female child, be aware of avoiding remarks on <i>only</i> her appearance or clothing. If you only heard compliments on your hair or dress or whatever from everyone you met, you’d start to think your looks are your most important feature, too. Maybe your only important feature.</p>
<p>If it’s a male child, try an unguided, open-ended invitation like “what’s on your mind today, buddy?” What a different world we’d live in if more boys felt safe sharing feelings, in their own way, right from the start.</p>
<p>Come to think of it, every single person you know could use a “what’s on your mind today, buddy?” once in a while.</p>
<h3><b>4. Don’t give advice. Not really.</b></h3>
<p>If a person is debating a decision, there’s no need to stress out about what advice to give him or her. Forget what you know. And don’t talk about your experience unless the person is specifically asking for it in hoping to learn from you (see #5). The person already knows the answer or the best solution—or at least, has a preference. All you have to do here is just repeat what he’s saying back to him.</p>
<p>Example: “It must be really hard to have to choose between those two awesome jobs the universe is throwing at you right now. Sounds like apple picking is really what you care deeply about, although pear picking pays more and comes with a cooler hat wardrobe.” Stop! Say no more. Just let the person listen to, and digest, what he himself is saying about his choices.</p>
<p>The answer is already in there, and it will just sound like advice coming from you. Win-win.</p>
<h3><b>5. Don’t relate.</b></h3>
<p>I mean that one-upping thing. Like, “oh, you broke your toe? Well one time I broke ALL of my toes and that REALLY hurt. So.”</p>
<p>There are two reasons a person redirects the conversation/attention back to himself: (1) the person is deeply self-centered and incapable of processing information about anyone unless it relates to him. It’s likely this person is cripplingly insecure, and therefore his worry about himself has turned into his only functioning pathway to the world. Or possibly this person is a sociopath. (2) The person really thinks this is helpful to compare stories. The person thinks this is empathy. It isn’t. The time for your story is not now. Just say, “Oh man, that must have really hurt!” Then, try this: look at the person in the eyes. If you can’t stop thinking about yourself, know that you have a problem. Your self-centeredness renders you incapable of intimacy. Get help.</p>
<p>Empathy is not “hey that happened to me too!” or “I also know what you are talking about—in fact I know a lot more than you do!” This is more like someone has just brought out his bowling pins to juggle but you grab them and juggle obliviously away from him. Not empathy.</p>
<p>Empathy is just the opposite: turning away from your ego, for just a minute (don’t worry, you can have it back soon!) in order to imagine, really imagine, what it’s like for someone else to be alive.</p>
<h3><b>6. Ask questions.</b></h3>
<p>What about when there’s nothing to listen to? You’re trying to support this person, you’re pointing all of your caring at her, but she’s just not saying much?</p>
<p>Ask about something that you think the person might like to answer. Anything, even, unrelated to the issue at hand. This is a great therapists’ trick. It gets a person going, and can lead to the bigger stuff.</p>
<p>Ask “What happened?” “What kind of place was that?” “When did you first…?” or other non yes-or-no questions. And, this sounds a little counterintuitive, but don’t ask a lot of “why” questions. Asking why can lead to defensiveness, and a sort of shallow string of quick justifications for behavior that aren’t actually insightful or productive. You can sit for days and discuss whys without any real benefit or helpful solutions. Also, it can often just be a dead-end question. “I dunno” is likely what you’ll get out of asking why 99% of the time.</p>
<p>Questions, good straightforward questions, are one of the greatest gifts you can give a person. Questions say, “I’m interested. You are valuable.” And they are my go-to solution whenever I have no idea what to say.</p>
<p>Now let’s go make some civilization together.&nbsp;<span></span></p>

                          <p><img src="https://www.iaea.org/sites/default/files/styles/full_page_width_landscape_16_9/public/olives-1140x640.jpg?itok=pdpDvQZY"></p><p>Europe produces 60 per cent of the world's olive oil. (Photo: FAO).</p>
                </div>
            <p>The research carried out by the Joint FAO/IAEA laboratory was designed to verify the origin of Slovenian extra virgin olive oil from the Istria region, which has a protected designation of origin and is a high value product. A total of 64 authentic extra virgin olive oils were used in the study, collected over two years from Slovenia, Italy, Croatia, Greece, Tunisia and Spain as part of an IAEA collaborative research initiative with these countries.&nbsp;</p>
    </div><div>
              <h2>Methods used in the olive oil study</h2>
                    
            <div><ul>
<li><strong>Slovenia:</strong> Fourier Transform near-infrared spectroscopy (FT-NIR) and headspace gas chromatography ion mobility spectrometry (HS-GC-IMS).</li>
<li><strong>Lebanon:</strong> Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy with attenuated total reflectance (FTIR ATR).</li>
</ul>
</div>
    </div><div><p>The FT-NIR technique is a non-destructive chemical analysis technology which involves shining a beam containing many frequencies of light at a sample and measuring the absorption of near-infrared light. HS-GC-IMS involves analysing the gas layer above the sample, resulting in a 2D data matrix which can be used to compare samples to each other or a reference sample.</p>
<p>Scientists also were able to differentiate between 242 olive oils and identify their origin from four different regions of Lebanon with 89 per cent accuracy. Lebanese olive oil varies in quality and cost depending on its region of origin. In this case, a Fourier Transform infrared (IR) spectroscopy with attenuated total reflectance technique was used, which measures the internal reflection of infrared light from interaction with a sample and processes the data using mathematical algorithms. All these techniques represent a rapid and non-destructive way to test products such as olive oil for adulteration or mislabelling.</p>
<p>The research on Slovenian olive oil was carried out as part of &nbsp;an IAEA <a href="https://www.iaea.org/newscenter/news/new-crp-implementation-of-nuclear-techniques-for-authentication-of-foods-with-high-value-labelling-claims-d52042">coordinated research project</a> to develop more food authentication tests, for instance to reveal where the olives in extra-virgin olive oil were grown.</p>
<p>“Infra-red spectroscopy and other techniques such as HS-GC-IMS can be used to analyse the samples in the laboratory and directly in the field, offers high sample throughput, low operational costs, requires little or no sample preparation, and no need for chemicals or specialized laboratory facilities,” said&nbsp;Christina Vlachou, Head of the Food Safety and Control Laboratory of the Joint&nbsp;FAO/IAEA Centre of Nuclear Techniques in Food and Agriculture.</p>
<p>Building on the recent launch of <a href="https://www.iaea.org/services/key-programmes/atoms4food">Atoms4Food</a>, a joint initiative of the IAEA and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), this year will see a gathering of food specialists from academia, public bodies, industry and commercial organizations at the <a href="https://www.iaea.org/events/fsc-symposium-2024">International Symposium on Food Safety and Control</a>. The Symposium, which will be held at the IAEA Headquarters in Vienna from 27 to 31 May 2024 in collaboration with the FAO, will provide a forum for sharing cutting-edge research and innovation, exchanging information and discussing international initiatives and needs.</p>
<p>The year 2024 will also mark the 60th anniversary of the <a href="https://www.iaea.org/about/organizational-structure/department-of-nuclear-sciences-and-applications/joint-fao/iaea-centre-of-nuclear-techniques-in-food-and-agriculture">Joint FAO/IAEA Centre of Nuclear Techniques in Food and Agriculture</a>, a unique international partnership between the two organizations that supports the safe and appropriate use of nuclear and related technologies in food and agriculture to contribute to global food security and sustainable agricultural development worldwide.</p>
<p>New research to tackle food fraud and other innovations in food safety and control will be among the issues considered at the International Symposium on Food Safety and Control. The IAEA will continue, with the expertise of the Joint FAO/IAEA Centre, to support food safety and quality and forge partnerships under Atoms4Food.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A fascinating article was recently uncovered and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/amiga/comments/1b1c9rx/goodbye_mr_chips_could_commodore_have_changed_the/">posted to Reddit</a> that was originally published on May 17, 1994, in <em>The Village Voice</em>. For those that don't know, the Voice was an American news and culture publication based in Greenwich Village, New York City, known for being the country's first alternative newsweekly. The printed newspaper edition ceased publication in 2017, while the online version <a href="https://www.villagevoice.com/">lives on</a>. A user on Reddit that goes by the moniker 8bitaficionado actually made a special trip to New York Public Library in order to look up an archive of the periodical and laboriously transcribed its contents. The issue in question is nowhere to be found online in its entirety. </p><p>

In the May 17 issue, Noah Green, in an article titled, "Goodbye Mr. Chips: Could Commodore Have Changed the World?" covered the demise of Commodore and its once-mighty Amiga computer released almost a decade prior. </p><div>

Noah Green: 
</p><blockquote><div><p>Over on Waverly Place, Ezra Story, a 23-year-old computer programmer, lives in the museum of a future that might have been.</p><p>

Ezra's sitting in front of his Commodore Amiga 3000, a home computer from 1990. With half the processing power, memory, and storage space of the latest PCs, the machine is playing a mind blowing technorave music video at full-throttle speed. Onscreen, what appear to be Ecstasy-fed Scandinavians dance, their writhing bodies embellished with digital sketch lines reminiscent of that awful a-ha video from 1985. An intricate, grainy Cubist mesh contracts and explodes behind them.</p><p>

Apple claims it invented movies on a computer screen. But a fully loaded PowerPC Macintosh would need an entire hard drive to store Ezra's video, and would spit it out in fits and starts. Ezra's file, downloaded from the archives of the European hacker culture centered around creating Amiga "demos," takes up less than one megabyte, and runs for 10 fluid minutes.</p><p>

In another room, Ezra has a partially disassembled Amiga 1000, the original model, a cybernetic senior citizen. Standing in the gloomy light that filters in from his courtyard, we watch this decade old machine play games with better graphics, sound, and speed than a modern Sega Genesis.</p><p>

The Amiga, says Ezra, "was built to do anything, at any time, anywhere."</p><p>

Both machines, when they were new, cost about $2000; today, they go for under $1000-much less than the Macs and PCs whose capabilities might come close. Maybe that's why half of Hollywood uses the Amiga for special effects-why the space station on Babylon 5 is an Amiga animation. The secret: three built-in, dedicated graphics chips that Amiga engineers named Agnus, Denise, and Paula back in 1985.</p><p>

Welcome to the future that may never be: a time when computers provide the user with the most capabilities for the lowest cost; when you won't need expensive, dubiously compatible add-on boards to make movies or compose symphonies, when users won't have to make massive hardware investments to support the bloated software of Microsoft Windows or Apple's System 7.1; when being a samizdat publisher won't be defined by having $895 to drop on Aldus Pagemaker.</p><p>

That future was indefinitely postponed on April 29, when Commodore International, the Bahamas-based company that created and sells the Amiga, went into liquidation.</p><p>

Rumors of Commodore's ill health had circulated for years, but they became particularly grim during the last few months. In the weeks before the end, I became a regular attendee of a digital deathwatch in the Internet's comp.sys.amiga.advocacy discussion group. A longtime programmer who had never touched an Amiga before, I was struck by the fierce loyalty, love, and idealism with which the Amigans regarded their endangered species of machine.</p><p>

"The Amiga computer is the rebel of all computers. It is the underdog, you can't help but love it," said Paul Griswold, a Commodore shareholder from Miami.</p></div></blockquote><p>

The article goes on to grab quotes from several various Commodore investors, analysts and programmers of the times interviewed by Green, including <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ewhac">Leo Schwab</a> of then-3DO.  </p><p>

This classic story in particular really presses the dagger deeper into the heart of Amiga fans: 
</p><blockquote><div><p>
Almost every Macintosh user remembers the scene in Star Trek IV (1986) where Scotty uses a Macintosh on present-day Earth to design the materials necessary to fix his starship. They all remember when he picks up the mouse, thinks it's a microphone, and says "Computer!" to it. The scene was the perfect tie-in, a pop-culture legitimation that would reap big dividends for the fledgling machine. </p><p>

What few know is that the film's art director, who knew good animation when he saw it, originally wanted an Amiga. Commodore refused to lend Paramount an Amiga, and indefinitely delayed the order when the producers tried to buy one. So Paramount called Apple. A Macintosh, complete with a programmer "to make it do whatever the hell Paramount could possibly want," said one Amiga developer, was driven from Cupertino to Hollywood on the same day.
</p></div></blockquote><p>

Green concluded, predicting a scattering of the Amiga's IP into the wind: </p><blockquote><div><p>Will another company step in, buy the technology, and turn the Amiga into a credible alternative to the Macintosh-Microsoft monopoly?</p><p>

...</p><p>

If not, the Amiga will live on still - in silicon fragments scattered across the latest TVs, toasters, and medical imaging machines, after a flock of corporate vultures buys the technology piecemeal. Agnus, Denise, and Paula will each end up in separate foster homes. And we will enter the future that shouldn't have been, where a small, powerful group of companies forces us to fork over more and more bucks for inefficient operating systems, and kids can no longer buy cheap, programmable computers. </p></div></blockquote><p>

<p>3rd March 2024</p>

<p>Mike Bostock, <a href="https://observablehq.com/blog/observable-2-0">Announcing: Observable Framework</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Today we’re launching <a href="https://observablehq.com/product">Observable 2.0</a> with a bold new vision: an open-source static site generator for building fast, beautiful data apps, dashboards, and reports.</p>
<p>Our mission is to help teams communicate more effectively with data. Effective presentation of data is critical for deep insight, nuanced understanding, and informed decisions. Observable notebooks are great for ephemeral, <em>ad hoc</em> data exploration. But notebooks aren’t well-suited for polished dashboards and apps.</p>
<p>Enter <a href="https://observablehq.com/framework/">Observable Framework</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are a lot of <em>really</em> interesting ideas in Observable Framework.</p>

</ul>

<h4 id="static-site-dashboards">A static site generator for data projects and dashboards</h4>
<p>At its heart, Observable Framework is a static site generator. You give it a mixture of Markdown and JavaScript (and potentially other languages too) and it compiles them all together into fast loading interactive pages.</p>
<p>It ships with a full featured hot-reloading server, so you can edit those files in your editor, hit save and see the changes reflected instantly in your browser.</p>
<p>Once you’re happy with your work you can run a build command to turn it into a set of static files ready to deploy to a server—or you can use the <code>npm run deploy</code> command to deploy it directly to Observable’s own authenticated sharing platform.</p>
<h4 id="javascript-in-markdown">JavaScript in Markdown</h4>
<p>The key to the design of Observable Framework is the way it uses JavaScript in Markdown to create interactive documents.</p>
<p>Here’s what that looks like:</p>
<div><pre><span># <span>This is a document</span></span>

Markdown content goes here.

This will output 1870:

<span>```</span><span>js</span>
<span>34</span> <span>*</span> <span>55</span>
<span>```</span>

And here's the current date and time, updating constantly:

<span>```</span><span>js</span>
<span>new</span> <span>Date</span>(now)
<span>```</span>

The same thing as an inline string: ${new Date(now)}</pre></div>
<p>Any Markdown code block tagged <code>js</code> will be executed as JavaScript in the user’s browser. This is an <em>incredibly</em> powerful abstraction—anything you can do in JavaScript (which these days is effectively anything at all) can now be seamlessly integrated into your document.</p>
<p>In the above example the <code>now</code> value is interesting—it’s a special variable that provides the current time in milliseconds since the epoch, updating constantly. Because <code>now</code> updates constantly, the display value of the cell and that inline expression will update constantly as well.</p>
<p>If you’ve used Observable Notebooks before this will feel familiar—but notebooks involve code and markdown authored in separate cells. With Framework they are all now part of a single text document.</p>
<p>Aside: when I tried the above example I found that the <code>${new Date(now)}</code> inline expression displayed as <code>Mon Feb 19 2024 20:46:02 GMT-0800 (Pacific Standard Time)</code> while the <code>js</code> block displayed as <code>2024-02-20T04:46:02.641Z</code>. That’s because inline expressions use the JavaScript default string representation of the object, while the <code>js</code> block uses the Observable <code>display()</code> function which has its own rules for how to display different types of objects, <a href="https://github.com/observablehq/inspector/blob/main/src/inspect.js">visible in inspect/src/inspect.js</a>.</p>
<h4 id="everything-reactive">Everything is still reactive</h4>
<p>The best feature of Observable Notebooks is their <em>reactivity</em>—the way cells automatically refresh when other cells they depend on change. This is a big difference to Python’s popular Jupyter notebooks, and is the signature feature of <a href="https://marimo.io/">marimo</a>, a new Python notebook tool.</p>
<p>Observable Framework retains this feature in its new JavaScript Markdown documents.</p>
<p>This is particularly useful when working with form inputs. You can drop an input onto a page and refer its value throughout the rest of the document, adding realtime interactivity to documents incredibly easily.</p>
<p>Here’s an example. I ported one of my <a href="https://observablehq.com/@simonw/datasette-downloads-per-day-with-observable-plot">favourite notebooks</a> to Framework, which provides a tool for viewing download statistics for my various Python packages.</p>
<p>The Observable Framework version can be found at <a href="https://simonw.github.io/observable-framework-experiments/package-downloads">https://simonw.github.io/observable-framework-experiments/package-downloads</a>—source code <a href="https://github.com/simonw/observable-framework-experiments/blob/main/docs/package-downloads.md">here on GitHub</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2024/pypi-dashboard.gif" alt="Animated demo showing PyPI download stats for Datasette projects - as I switch a select menu between sqlite-utils and csv-diff and shot-scraper the displayed chart updates to match."></p>
<p>This entire thing is just 57 lines of Markdown. Here’s the code with additional comments (and presented in a slightly different order—the order of code blocks doesn’t matter in Observable thanks to reactivity).</p>
<div><pre><span># <span>PyPI download stats for Datasette projects</span></span>

Showing downloads for <span>**</span>${packageName}<span>**</span></pre></div>
<p>It starts with a Markdown <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> heading and text that shows the name of the selected package.</p>
<div><pre><span>```</span><span>js</span> echo
<span>const</span> <span>packageName</span> <span>=</span> <span>view</span>(<span>Inputs</span>.<span>select</span>(packages, {
  value<span>:</span> <span><span>"</span>sqlite-utils<span>"</span></span>,
  label<span>:</span> <span><span>"</span>Package<span>"</span></span>
}));
<span>```</span></pre></div>
<p>This block displays the select widget allowing the user to pick one of the items from the <code>packages</code> array (defined later on).</p>
<p><code>Inputs.select()</code> is a built-in method provided by Framework, described in the <a href="https://observablehq.com/framework/lib/inputs">Observable Inputs</a> documentation.</p>
<p>The <code>view()</code> function is new in Observable Framework—it’s the thing that enables the reactivity, ensuring that updates to the input selection are acted on by other code blocks in the document.</p>
<p>Because <code>packageName</code> is defined with <code>const</code> it becomes a variable that is visible to other <code>js</code> blocks on the page. It’s used by this next block:</p>
<div><pre><span>```</span><span>js</span> echo
<span>const</span> <span>data</span> <span>=</span> <span>d3</span>.<span>json</span>(
  <span><span>`</span>https://datasette.io/content/stats.json?_size=max&amp;package=<span><span>${</span>packageName<span>}</span></span>&amp;_sort_desc=date&amp;_shape=array<span>`</span></span>
);</pre></div>
<p>Here we are fetching the data that we need for the chart. I’m using <code>d3.json()</code> (all of D3 is available in Framework) to fetch the data from a URL that includes the selected package name.</p>
<p>The data is coming from <a href="https://datasette.io/">Datasette</a>, using the Datasette JSON API. I have a SQLite table at <a href="https://datasette.io/content/stats">datasette.io/content/stats</a> that’s updated once a day with the latest PyPI package statistics via a convoluted series of GitHub Actions workflows, <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2021/Jul/28/baked-data/#baked-data-datasette-io">described previously</a>.</p>
<p>Adding <code>.json</code> to that URL returns the JSON, then I ask for rows for that particular package, sorted descending by date and returning the maximum number of rows (1,000) as a JSON array of objects.</p>
<p>Now that we have <code>data</code> as a variable we can manipulate it slightly for use with Observable Plot—parsing the SQLite string dates into JavaScript <code>Date</code> objects:</p>
<div><pre><span>```</span><span>js</span> echo
<span>const</span> <span>data_with_dates</span> <span>=</span> <span>data</span>.<span>map</span>(<span>function</span>(<span>d</span>) {
  d.date = d3.<span>timeParse</span>(<span><span>"</span>%Y-%m-%d<span>"</span></span>)(d.date);
  return d;
})
```</pre></div>
<p>This code is ready to render as a chart. I’m using <a href="https://observablehq.com/plot">Observable Plot</a>—also packaged with Framework:</p>
<pre><code>```js echo
Plot.plot({
  y: {
    grid: true,
    label: `${packageName} PyPI downloads per day`
  },
  width: width,
  marginLeft: 60,
  marks: [
    Plot.line(data_with_dates, {
      x: "date",
      y: "downloads",
      title: "downloads",
      tip: true
    })
  ]
})
```

<p>So we have one cell that lets the user pick the package they want, a cell that fetches that data, a cell that processes it and a cell that renders it as a chart.</p>
<p>There’s one more piece of the puzzle: where does that list of packages come from? I fetch that with another API call to Datasette. Here I’m using a SQL query executed against the <a href="https://datasette.io/content">/content</a> database directly:</p>
<div><pre><span>```</span><span>js</span> echo
<span>const</span> <span>packages_sql</span> <span>=</span> <span><span>"</span>select package from stats group by package order by max(downloads) desc<span>"</span></span>
<span>```</span>
<span>```</span><span>js</span> echo
<span>const</span> <span>packages</span> <span>=</span> <span>fetch</span>(
  <span><span>`</span>https://datasette.io/content.json?sql=<span><span>${</span><span>encodeURIComponent</span>(</span></span>
<span><span>    packages_sql</span></span>
<span><span>  )<span>}</span></span>&amp;_size=max&amp;_shape=arrayfirst<span>`</span></span>
).<span>then</span>((<span>r</span>) <span>=&gt;</span> <span>r</span>.<span>json</span>());
<span>```</span></pre></div>
<p><code>_shape=arrayfirst</code> is a shortcut for getting back a JSON array of the first column of the resulting rows.</p>
<p>That’s all there is to it! It’s a pretty tiny amount of code for a full interactive dashboard.</p>
<h4 id="only-code-you-use">Only include the code that you use</h4>
<p>You may have noticed that my dashboard example uses several additional libraries—<code>Inputs</code> for the form element, <code>d3</code> for the data fetching and <code>Plot</code> for the chart rendering.</p>
<p>Observable Framework is smart about these. It implements lazy loading in development mode, so code is only loaded the first time you attempt to use it in a cell.</p>
<p>When you build and deploy your application, Framework automatically loads just the referenced library code from the <a href="https://www.jsdelivr.com/">jsdelivr CDN</a>.</p>
<h4 id="cache-data-at-build">Cache your data at build time</h4>
<p>One of the most interesting features of Framework is its <a href="https://observablehq.com/framework/loaders">Data loader</a> mechanism.</p>
<p>Dashboards built using Framework can load data at runtime from anywhere using <code>fetch()</code> requests (or wrappers around them). This is how Observable Notebooks work too, but it leaves the performance of your dashboard at the mercy of whatever backends you are talking to.</p>
<p>Dashboards benefit from fast loading times. Framework encourages a pattern where you build the data for the dashboard at deploy time, bundling it together into static files containing just the subset of the data needed for the dashboard. These can be served lightning fast from the same static hosting as the dashboard code itself.</p>
<p>The design of the data loaders is beautifully simple and powerful. A data loader is a script that can be written in <em>any</em> programming language. At build time, Framework executes that script and saves whatever is outputs to a file.</p>
<p>A data loader can be as simple as the following, saved as <code>quakes.json.sh</code>:</p>
<div><pre>curl https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/summary/all_day.geojson</pre></div>
<p>When the application is built, that filename tells Framework the destination file (<code>quakes.json</code>) and the loader to execute (<code>.sh</code>).</p>
<p>This means you can load data from any source using any technology you like, provided it has the ability to output JSON or CSV or some other useful format to standard output.</p>
<h4 id="comparison-to-observable-notebooks">Comparison to Observable Notebooks</h4>
<p>Mike introduced Observable Framework as <em>Observable 2.0</em>. It’s worth reviewing how the this system compares to the original Observable Notebook platform.</p>
<p>I’ve been a huge fan of Observable Notebooks for years—<a href="https://simonwillison.net/tags/observable/">38 blog posts and counting</a>! The most obvious comparison is to Jupyter Notebooks, where they have some key differences:</p>
<ul>
<li>Observable notebooks use JavaScript, not Python.</li>
<li>The notebook editor itself isn’t open source—it’s a hosted product provided on <a href="https://observablehq.com/">observablehq.com</a>. You can export the notebooks as static files and run them anywhere you like, but the editor itself is a proprietary product.</li>
<li>Observable cells are <em>reactive</em>. This is the key difference with Jupyter: any time you change a cell all other cells that depend on that cell are automatically re-evaluated, similar to Excel.</li>
<li>The JavaScript syntax they use isn’t quite standard JavaScript—they had to invent a new <code>viewof</code> keyword to support their reactivity model.</li>
<li>Editable notebooks are a pretty complex proprietary file format. They don’t play well with tools like Git, to the point that Observable ended up implementing their own custom version control and collaboration systems.</li>
</ul>
<p>Observable Framework reuses many of the ideas (and code) from Observable Notebooks, but with some crucial differences:</p>
<ul>
<li>Notebooks (really documents) are now <strong>single text files</strong>—Markdown files with embedded JavaScript blocks. It’s all still reactive, but the file format is much simpler and can be edited using any text editor, and checked into Git.</li>
<li>It’s <strong>all open source</strong>. Everything is under an ISC license (OSI approved) and you can run the full editing stack on your own machine.</li>
<li>It’s all just standard JavaScript now—<strong>no custom syntax</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="change-in-strategy">A change in strategy</h4>
<p>Reading the tea leaves a bit, this also looks to me like a strategic change of direction for Observable as a company. Their previous focus was on building great collaboration tools for data science and analytics teams, based around the proprietary Observable Notebook editor.</p>
<p>With Framework they appear to be leaning more into the developer tools space.</p>
<p>On Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/observablehq">@observablehq</a> describes itself as “The end-to-end solution for developers who want to build and host dashboards that don’t suck”—the Internet Archive copy <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20231003212202/https://twitter.com/observablehq">from October 3rd 2023</a> showed “Build data visualizations, dashboards, and data apps that impact your business — faster.”</p>
<p>I’m excited to see where this goes. I’ve limited my usage of Observable Notebooks a little in the past purely due to the proprietary nature of their platform and the limitations placed on free accounts (mainly the lack of free private notebooks), while still having enormous respect for the technology and enthusiastically adopting their open source libraries such as <a href="https://observablehq.com/plot/">Observable Plot</a>.</p>
<p>Observable Framework addresses basically all of my reservations. It’s a fantastic new expression of the ideas that made Observable Notebooks so compelling, and I expect to use it for all sorts of interesting projects in the future.</p>
