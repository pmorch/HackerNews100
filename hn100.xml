<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-headline="100 Years Ago, IBM Was Born" data-elid="2667228583" data-post-url="https://spectrum.ieee.org/ibm-history" data-authors="James W. Cortada" data-page-title="100 Years Ago, IBM Was Born - IEEE Spectrum"><p>Happy birthday, IBM! You’re 100 years old! Or are you?</p><p>It’s true that the businesses that formed IBM began in the late 1800s. But it’s also true that a birth occurred in February 1924, with the renaming of the Computing-Tabulating-Recording Co. as the International Business Machines Corp. And a hundred years after that event, it serves as an important reminder that the world of computing and IT that IBM played a pivotal role in building has a longer history than we are likely to think. “Data processing” was coined over a century ago, while “office appliance” was in use in the 1880s. From the 19th century, through the 20th, and into the 21st, IBM was there, making HP, <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/microsoft">Microsoft</a>, and Apple appear more like children or grandchildren of the IT world; <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/facebook">Facebook</a>, <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/google">Google</a>, and Twitter/X more like great-grandchildren. So let’s take a moment to contemplate the origins of an iconic corporation.</p><h2>The Assembling of IBM’s Parts</h2><p>Back in the late 19th century, as the U.S. economy gave birth to important large enterprises—telecommunications, railroads, manufacturing—the need to coordinate the work of individuals and dispersed locations led to the mechanization of information. Hence the emergence of typewriters, adding machines, and cash registers. Time-recording devices tracked when workers arrived and left, while scales weighed everything from meat at a butcher shop to industrial machine parts. For the 1890 U.S. census, Herman Hollerith’s punch-card tabulators calculated the nation’s population.</p><p><img alt="Black and white photo of women standing in line and watching as one woman turns the handle on a large dial.

But at least three survived. One came into being in 1900 as the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/history/international-time-recording" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">International Time Recording Co.</a>, in Endicott, N.Y. ITR soon became known as <em>the</em> company for time-recording products in the United States and Canada. It had been formed and shaped by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Ranlett_Flint" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Charles Flint</a>, a dynamic character known for consolidating several companies into U.S. Rubber and several other companies into the American Chicle Co.—a.k.a the Chewing Gum Trust—and for his love of sailing and airplanes. </p><p>In 1901, Flint acquired the Computing Scale Co., which made tabletop scales popular with grocers in the Midwest. Over time, the company added cheese slicers and office furniture.</p><p><img alt="Black and white photo of a shop window displaying various scales and clocks.

Created in the 1880s and widely successful almost from its birth, TMC—maker of Hollerith’s punch-card tabulating equipment—produced the kind of breakthrough technology that large enterprises and government agencies desperately needed, to support massive undertakings like the census as well as inventory control and logistics. </p><p><img alt="Black and white photo of a wooden apparatus that looks like an upright piano and has rows of round dials across the top." data-rm-shortcode-id="5cba1a5a7ce6a5e71a65e08cbf5c55ae" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" data-runner-src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/black-and-white-photo-of-a-wooden-apparatus-that-looks-like-an-upright-piano-and-has-rows-of-round-dials-across-the-top.jpg?id=51435038&amp;width=980" height="956" id="f9679" lazy-loadable="true" src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/black-and-white-photo-of-a-wooden-apparatus-that-looks-like-an-upright-piano-and-has-rows-of-round-dials-across-the-top.jpg?id=51435038&amp;width=980" width="1280"><small placeholder="Add Photo Caption...">Herman Hollerith’s punch-card tabulators were used in the 1890 U.S. Census.</small><small placeholder="Add Photo Credit...">IBM Corp.</small></p><p>That same year, Flint smashed the three pieces together to form an entity that he unimaginatively called the Computing-Tabulating-Recording Co., or C-T-R. The scales business was okay, the time-recording business was booming, and the tabulating business had enormous potential but had yet to demonstrate it could keep up with demand. The creation of C-T-R yielded a company with promise, but the three entities didn’t coordinate or leverage each other’s assets and talents.</p><p><img alt="On the left, a black and white photo of a serious looking white man with an enormous mustache and wearing a suit.

Watson Sr. to build the business. </small><small placeholder="Add Photo Credit...">IBM Corp.</small></p><p>Flint convinced his board of directors to hire a professional manager to see what could be done to grow the entire business. Enter <a href="https://www.ibm.com/history/thomas-watson-sr" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Thomas Watson Sr.</a> in 1914. A highly successful sales executive who had recently spent two decades working at the <a href="https://www.ncr.com/about/history" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">National Cash Register Co.</a>—considered one of the best-run “cool” companies of the early 20th century. He was 42 when he arrived at C-T-R. Hollywood handsome, smart, mature, and confident in his skills as an executive working in the high-tech end of the economy, he quickly sized up the situation and went to work.</p><p><img alt="Black and white photo of a middle-aged white man in a suit sitting at his desk and looking at papers." data-rm-shortcode-id="7d79ff70f5089d086c604c34d1a4b168" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" data-runner-src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/black-and-white-photo-of-a-middle-aged-white-man-in-a-suit-sitting-at-his-desk-and-looking-at-papers.jpg?id=51435043&amp;width=980" height="1010" id="ddf7c" lazy-loadable="true" src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/black-and-white-photo-of-a-middle-aged-white-man-in-a-suit-sitting-at-his-desk-and-looking-at-papers.jpg?id=51435043&amp;width=980" width="1447"><small placeholder="Add Photo Caption...">Thomas J. Watson Sr., hired in 1914, propelled C-T-R into a high-tech data-processing enterprise.</small><small placeholder="Add Photo Credit...">IBM Corp.</small></p><p>Watson brought in technical and sales colleagues from NCR, figured out who in C-T-R to take seriously, dismissed dissidents and incompetents, and sought ways to integrate all three pieces of the company. He concluded that the greatest potential for growth lay with Hollerith’s tabulators, so he focused on growing that market. Meanwhile, ITR had a popular product and, almost as important, a presence in Europe. The scales business, though, was a ho-hum opportunity as far as Watson was concerned, so he paid far less attention to it.</p><p>Watson integrated sales—his strong suit—across all three businesses, and trained the team to become a highly skilled, professional staff. His newly hired engineers, meanwhile, improved manufacturing operations.</p><p>The start of World War I blocked sales in Europe, but not in the United States. When the United States entered the war in 1917, government and private sector demand for C-T-R’s products grew rapidly. The end of the war opened up Europe’s huge market, and smaller ones in South America and parts of Asia.</p><h2>Birth of a Corporate Culture</h2><p>Slowly and steadily, Watson was creating a new corporate culture of ethics, paired with competent sales, solid technology, and a growing international perspective. The previously disjointed three-legged operation increasingly embraced his notion of “speed, accuracy, and flexibility,” in which the customer always came first. Despite a short recession at the start of the 1920s, C-T-R was emerging as a serious and well-run high-tech data-processing enterprise.</p><p><img alt="Image of an old-fashioned stock certificate for the Computing-Tabulating-Recording Co." data-rm-shortcode-id="d874d48aee7a120930a8773b8d49467b" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" data-runner-src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/image-of-an-old-fashioned-stock-certificate-for-the-computing-tabulating-recording-co.jpg?id=51435044&amp;width=980" height="973" id="ad240" lazy-loadable="true" src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/image-of-an-old-fashioned-stock-certificate-for-the-computing-tabulating-recording-co.jpg?id=51435044&amp;width=980" width="1440"><small placeholder="Add Photo Caption...">Under Watson’s leadership, C-T-R’s revenue, staff, and product lines continued to grow. </small><small placeholder="Add Photo Credit...">IBM Corp.</small></p><p>In 1914, the company had generated US $4 million in revenues (about $120 million today) with 1,346 employees; in 1920, revenues were $14 million, with 2,731 employees. In 1922, a recession year, C-T-R brought in only $9 million, but its staff had climbed to 3,043—solid evidence that Watson considered the recession a mere bump in the road. And for the next six decades, the company continued to grow. Not until the late 1980s did the company again face declining revenues (then measured in the billions of dollars) and a shrinking labor force (then in excess of 400,000).</p><p>In 1923, Watson, his executives, and employees collectively looked toward a future without immediate threats of war, where large organizations had embraced the concept of data processing powered by mechanical devices. Watson oversaw a rapidly expanding company that was grabbing market share away from competitors. He concluded that C-T-R’s future lay in pursuing a worldwide strategy, one for which he now had enough factories, sales offices, and trained employees. To be sure—and this is an important lesson for today’s startups—it had taken him a decade to reach the point where he could sit comfortably in his office in New York and imagine the next phase of C-T-R. </p><p>As a preamble to that future, he decided that the company’s image and reputation required some burnishing. He considered what the public knew about the firm, what the company stood for, what its brand would be, and how its reputation should be shaped. It was time, Watson decided, for a name upgrade.</p><h2>IBM Gets Its Name</h2><p>On 15 February 1924, <em>The</em><em>Wall Street Journal</em> published a short article on page 3, announcing that the “International Business Machines Corp. has been incorporated under the laws of New York to take over business and assets of Computing-Tabulating-Recording Co.” That’s how the world learned about the existence of IBM (that is, unless they worked in Canada, where employees had known their employer as <a href="https://www.ibm.com/ibm/ca/en/ibmcanada100/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">IBM since 1917</a>).</p><p><img alt="Black and white logo with the words &quot;International Business Machines&quot; shaped into a globe" data-rm-shortcode-id="229adf65709226d31ff502b363f94bbd" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" data-runner-src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/black-and-white-logo-with-the-words-international-business-machines-shaped-into-a-globe.jpg?id=51435046&amp;width=980" height="755" id="3f643" lazy-loadable="true" src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/black-and-white-logo-with-the-words-international-business-machines-shaped-into-a-globe.jpg?id=51435046&amp;width=980" width="1208"><small placeholder="Add Photo Caption...">In a 13 February 1924 letter to employees, Thomas Watson unveiled IBM’s new name.</small><small placeholder="Add Photo Credit...">IBM Corp.</small></p><p>When Watson had been remaking C-T-R, he already thought the company’s name was awkward and uninspiring, but too many other issues required his urgent attention. In early 1924, though, he decided it was time. On 13 February 1924, Watson published a letter addressed to all employees to announce the change, explaining: “Our new name is particularly adaptable and suitable to our business, in view of the fact of our increasing growth, the consistent development of additions to our line, and our products covering such a wide range in the field of business machinery.” He concluded, “We are confident that this change in name will be beneficial to the business, and that the members of our field organization will find it of direct value in introducing our company and the products which we manufacture and distribute.”</p><p>The name change was also significant to C-T-R’s customers and vendors, and IBM salesmen rushed to explain how wonderful it would be. Then there was this little story in the <em>Wall Street Journal</em> three months after IBM’s incorporation. It may not have been true, but it suggests that everything comes down to execution. The article began by stating that some people were confused by the name, which it called “unwieldy,” and maybe this episode really did happen:</p><blockquote>The other day an uptown merchant called up a friend in Wall Street and inquired if he had ever heard of a new concern called the International Business Machines Corp.<p>“We have a big order from them,” he said, “and I am trying to check up on their credit rating. My partner has just gone downtown to demand a balance sheet from them.”</p><p>“Well,” said the broker, “in their last balance sheet they showed $800,000 cash and about $8,000,000 current assets. Their position seems pretty good. How big was the order?”</p><p>“About $100,” said the merchant. “Wait a minute, I want to head off my partner.”</p></blockquote><p>Implicit in that story was the real business problem of retaining the positive reputation of C-T-R while leveraging its new name to build business momentum. Watson and his colleagues spent the rest of the 1920s and 1930s creating a brand image that reflected their positive view and plans for the future but that also translated into transactions, profits, growth, and prestige. They battled ignorance of what their products could do, invented new products, hired people, expanded operations, overcame the worldwide tragedy of the Great Depression, and endured an antitrust challenge in the 1930s, the first of several.</p><p>The name change ultimately signaled a larger transformation under way. Whether the firm should have had a different name than IBM was less important than that Thomas Watson felt it was time to declare a grander purpose for the company. The tone of his comments, the nature of the company’s communications, and the way its staff interacted with the media and with customers evolved almost as a step change after the adoption of the new name. Watson was declaring that IBM wanted to become a major player in its industry and a leading international corporation. And so it did.<br></p><p><em>This article is adapted from excerpts of the author’s award-winning book, </em><a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262547826/ibm/" target="_blank">IBM: The Rise and Fall and Reinvention of a Global Icon</a><em>(MIT Press, 2019).</em></p></div></div>]]></description>

<p><span>Light Bio, a synthetic biology startup, announced that it is now selling its bioluminescent petunias in the U.S.</span></p>
<p><span>With support from biotech leaders such as NFX and Ginkgo Bioworks, </span><span>Light Bio is reimagining the horticultural industry by introducing a new category of plants that emit an ethereal glow.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>People are fascinated with glowing plants, and scientists have now revealed how to make these much brighter. This significant achievement, </span><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-023-02152-y" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>documented in Nature Methods</span></a><span>, details genetic modifications that enhance bioluminescence in a variety of plants by up to 100 times. The team of 26 scientists created the brighter plants by optimizing genes isolated from multiple species of luminous mushrooms.</span></p>
<p><span>The new research builds on </span><span>an earlier discovery </span><span>for creating continuously glowing plants by inserting DNA obtained from the mushrooms. Those researchers had revealed a surprising similarity between mushroom bioluminescence and plant metabolism, allowing for more visible light than was previously possible. In this new report, the scientists have adapted the inserted genes to further boost luminescence.</span></p>
<p><span>Beginning in April, glowing petunias will be available under the brand Firefly Petunia, so named because the bright buds resemble fireflies. Last September, the </span><span>USDA reportedly determined</span> <span>through its independent evaluation that Light Bio’s genetically engineered Firefly Petunia may be safely grown and bred in the U.S.</span></p>

                <div><p>In the largest study of its kind, scientists have shown how protein “biomarkers” predict dementia 15 years before diagnosis.</p></div>
<div><p>The research, published today in Nature Aging, shows how profiles of proteins in the blood accurately predict dementia up to 15 years prior to clinical diagnosis. These are known as biomarkers, which are molecules found in blood, other body fluids, or tissues that is a sign of a normal or abnormal process, or of a condition or disease.</p></div>
<div><p>In the study, scientists from The University of Warwick and Fudan University, Shanghai used the largest cohort of blood proteomics and dementia to date, including blood samples from 52,645 healthy participants recruited from UK Biobank – a population-based study cohort.</p></div>
<div><p>Blood samples collected between 2006 and 2010 were frozen and then analysed 10-15 years later by the research team who analysed them between April 2021 and February 2022. Until March 2023, a total of 1,417 participants went on to develop dementia – and these people’s blood showed dysregulation of protein biomarkers.</p></div>
<div><p>Of 1,463 proteins analysed, aided by with a type of artificial intelligence known as machine learning, 11 proteins were identified and combined as a protein panel, which the researchers have shown to be highly accurate at predicting future dementia. Further incorporation of conventional risk factors of age, sex, education level and genetics, showed for the first time the high accuracy of the predictive model, measured at over 90%*, indicating its potential future use in community-based dementia screening programs.</p></div>
<div><p>Proteins (for example Glial Fibrillary acidic protein, GFAP) had previously been identified as potential biomarkers for dementia in smaller studies, but this new research was much larger and conducted over several years. Known as a longitudinal analysis (a study conducted on a sample of participants over a number of years), the researchers were able to show the differences and trajectories between those with dementia and controls across 15 years.</p></div>
<div><p>An early diagnosis is critical for those with dementia. New drug technology can slow, or even reverse the progress of Alzheimer’s, but only if the disease is detected early enough. The drug lecanemab is one of two new treatments for the disease.</p></div>
<div><p>Lead author Professor Jianfeng Feng, from the Department of Computer Science, University of Warwick, hopes future drugs may be developed to interact with the proteins identified in the study.</p></div>
<div><p>Professor Feng emphasised that the combination of artificial intelligence and protein analysis offers a promising avenue for precision medicine. This is highly important for screening mid-aged to older individuals within the community who are at high risk of dementia. “This model could be seamlessly integrated into the NHS and used as a screening tool by GPs”, said Professor Feng.</p></div>
<div><p>Professor Wei Cheng, a co-corresponding author from Fudan University, explained that this research builds on the team’s previously developed dementia prediction model which used variables, such as age, presence of a certain gene and mother’s age at death. “Compared to our previous work, the newly developed protein-based model is obviously a breakthrough”, he said.</p></div>
<div><p>Another corresponding author Professor Jintai Yu, a neurovegetative disease specialist from Fudan University, added: “The proteomic biomarkers are more easily to access and non-invasive, and they can substantially facilitate the application of large-scale population screening”.</p></div>
<div><p>He also pointed drawbacks of previous risk models, which were primarily depended on intricate and difficult-to-obtain biomarkers using procedures such as lumbar puncture or complex imaging methods meaning their widespread use is hindered because of the invasive procedures and the high cost of carrying them out.</p></div>

<p><b>Notes to Editors</b></p>
<div><p>The University of Warwick signed a Memorandum of Understanding with Fudan University in 2022 and the two Universities work together designing and developing new research projects and run staff and student exchanges. </p></div>
<div><p>*The Area Under the Curve (AUC) figure is used to measure how good a model performs. A model whose predictions are 100% wrong has an AUC of 0.0; one whose predictions are 100% correct has an AUC of 1.0. this study had an AUC of over 0.9.</p></div>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Digital devices are more and more replacing traditional handwriting (<a href="#ref32">Longcamp et al., 2006</a>; <a href="#ref25">Kiefer et al., 2015</a>), and as both writing and reading are becoming increasingly digitized in the classroom, we need to examine the implications of this practice (<a href="#ref35">Mangen and Balsvik, 2016</a>; <a href="#ref39">Patterson and Patterson, 2017</a>). Using a keyboard is now often recommended for young children as it is less demanding and frustrating (<a href="#ref15">Cunningham and Stanovich, 1990</a>; <a href="#ref17">Fears and Lockman, 2018</a>), allowing them to express themselves in written form earlier (<a href="#ref22">Hultin and Westman, 2013</a>). Be that as it may, handwriting training has not only been found to improve spelling accuracy (<a href="#ref15">Cunningham and Stanovich, 1990</a>) and better memory and recall (<a href="#ref32">Longcamp et al., 2006</a>; <a href="#ref53">Smoker et al., 2009</a>; <a href="#ref36">Mueller and Oppenheimer, 2014</a>), but also to facilitate letter recognition and understanding (<a href="#ref33">Longcamp et al., 2005</a>, <a href="#ref31">2008</a>; <a href="#ref30">Li and James, 2016</a>). Such benefits for learning have been reported irrespective of when writing by hand using a traditional pen or pencil or using a digital pen (<a href="#ref38">Osugi et al., 2019</a>). Also, brain research shows that it is not just any motor activity that facilitates learning, but that accurately coordinating the complex hand movements while carefully shaping each letter when using a pen, is crucial (<a href="#ref40">Pei et al., 2021</a>). Apparently, the pen causes different underlying neurological processes that provide the brain with optimal conditions for learning and remembering (<a href="#ref4">Askvik et al., 2020</a>).</p>
<p>Recent findings in neuroscience reveal that neural processes are not as localized and static as is commonly believed, but that the brain is organized in a highly dynamic functional manner (<a href="#ref34">Lopes da Silva, 1991</a>; <a href="#ref52">Singer, 1993</a>). Under normal circumstances, several brain systems are continually working together (<a href="#ref12">Buzsáki, 2006</a>), showing an extremely flexible organization with structurally different neural tissue being involved in neural circuits that are only temporarily assembled so as to enable a given task (<a href="#ref16">Edelman and Gally, 2013</a>; <a href="#ref57">Van der Weel et al., 2019</a>). In such a view, neurons can change function entirely when incorporated in different systems (<a href="#ref2">Anderson, 2014</a>). <a href="#ref10">Bullmore and Sporns (2009)</a> refer to this type of flexible organization of the brain as functional connectivity as against structural connectivity.</p>
<p>Electroencephalography is well suited to studying brain electrical activity as a function of handwriting and typewriting in the millisecond scale. It permits the investigation of changes in the status of the underlying active networks (<a href="#ref34">Lopes da Silva, 1991</a>) and can reveal the everchanging spatial patterns of activations that are specific to any given task (<a href="#ref45">Pfurtscheller et al., 1996</a>). In particular, studies of cortical oscillations detected with high-density EEG are now considered an indispensable aspect of contemporary systems neuroscience (<a href="#ref18">Fröhlich, 2016</a>).</p>
<p>Brain oscillations can be considered as the interplay between the cortex and the thalamus and are generated by changes involved in the control of oscillations in neural networks (<a href="#ref43">Pfurtscheller and Lopes da Silva, 1999</a>). The complex interactions and the resulting particular frequencies are thought to reflect distinct cognitive processes (<a href="#ref29">Klimesch et al., 1994</a>; <a href="#ref6">Berens and Horner, 2017</a>). The temporal organization of neuronal firing is crucial as it is assumed to be fundamental when forming long-term memories in the hippocampus (<a href="#ref6">Berens and Horner, 2017</a>).</p>
<p>Frequency-specific changes in EEG recordings can be observed as event-related synchronization (ERS) or event-related desynchronization (ERD; <a href="#ref42">Pfurtscheller and Aranibar, 1977</a>; <a href="#ref43">Pfurtscheller and Lopes da Silva, 1999</a>). Spectral analyses are used to detect differences in a given frequency band (<a href="#ref44">Pfurtscheller et al., 1994</a>; <a href="#ref49">Salmelin and Hari, 1994</a>; <a href="#ref28">Klimesch et al., 1996</a>), by calculating the temporal dynamics of EEG oscillations and quantifying event-related amplifications and/or suppressions of rhythms.</p>
<p>A recent EEG-study from our lab showed that drawing by hand causes more activity and involves larger areas in the brain as opposed to typing on a keyboard (<a href="#ref56">Van der Meer and Van der Weel, 2017</a>). We concluded that the involvement of fine and intricate hand movements in notetaking, in contrast with pressing keys on a keyboard that all require the same simple finger movement, may be more advantageous for learning (<a href="#ref56">Van der Meer and Van der Weel, 2017</a>). A follow-up study observed event-related synchronized activity in the theta range in both children and students in parietal and central brain regions, but only when writing by hand (<a href="#ref4">Askvik et al., 2020</a>). As these studies have found evidence that writing by hand facilitates learning, the present study further investigated the neurobiological differences related to cursive writing and typewriting in the young adult brain. Specifically, we investigated how the various brain regions interconnect via neural networks when writing by hand as opposed to typing on a keyboard using frequency modulation and the latest in brain connectivity analysis (c.f., <a href="#ref54">Solomon et al., 2017</a>).</p> <h2>Methods</h2>
<h3>Participants</h3>
<p>Forty university students in their early twenties took part in the study at the Developmental Neuroscience Laboratory, Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU). HD EEG data from 36 students were of good enough quality and sufficiently artifact-free to be included in the analyses. The data from 12 adult participants were already used in analyses in the time-frequency domain (<a href="#ref4">Askvik et al., 2020</a>). The present study performed a brain connectivity analysis to investigate the underlying neural networks involved in tasks of handwriting and typewriting. Participants were mostly students and were recruited at the university campus. They received a $15 cinema ticket for taking part. To avoid crossover effects between the two hemispheres, only right-handed participants were included, as determined by the Edinburgh Handedness Inventory (<a href="#ref37">Oldfield, 1971</a>). Allowing the use of (the fingers of) both hands would cause many unforeseen effects on the brain, which would make it hard to interpret the results. Participants gave their informed written consent, and it was made clear that they could withdraw from the experiment at any time without consequences. The Regional Committee for Medical and Health Ethics (Central Norway) approved the study.</p>
<h3>Experimental stimuli and EEG data acquisition</h3>
<p>E-prime 2.0 was used to individually display 15 different Pictionary words on a Microsoft Surface Studio. The participants used a digital pen to write in cursive by hand directly on the touchscreen, and a keyboard to typewrite the presented words.</p>
<p>The experiment comprised a total of 30 trials, where each word appeared in two different conditions, presented in a randomized order. For each trial, participants were instructed to either (a) <i>write in cursive</i> with their right hand the presented word with a digital pen directly on the screen, or (b) <i>type</i> the presented word using the right index finger on the keyboard. Before each trial, the instruction <i>write</i> or <i>type</i> appeared before one of the target words appeared, and the participants were given 25 s to either write by hand or type the word multiple times, separated by a space. EEG data were recorded only during the first 5 s of each trial. To prevent artifacts produced by head and eye movements caused by shifting gaze between the screen and the keyboard, typed words did not appear on the screen while the participant was typewriting. The writings produced by the participants (see <a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a> for example) were stored for offline analyses.</p>

<p><b>Figure 1</b>. Task design, behavioral performance, and sequence of the connectivity analyses. Visually presented words were either written by hand with a digital pen or typed on a keyboard while participants were wearing a 256-channel sensor array. EEG recordings were analyzed in terms of their functional connectivity, resulting in detailed network measures.</p></div>  
<p>A Geodesic Sensor Net (GSN; <a href="#ref55">Tucker et al., 1994</a>) with 256 evenly distributed electrodes was used to record EEG activity from the participant’s scalp at 500 Hz. The signals were amplified using a high-input EGI amplifier (<a href="#ref46">Picton et al., 2000</a>).</p>
<h3>Procedure</h3>
<p>On arrival in the lab, a consent form with all necessary information was given to the participants to sign. While the participant completed the handedness test, an appropriately sized net was soaked in a saline electrolyte for 15 min to optimize electrical conductivity. The participant was sitting comfortably in an adjustable chair in front of a table. The screen was placed on the table as closely as possible to the participant. A keyboard was also placed in a preferred position for the participant, and a digital pen was used for writing on the touchscreen. A pre-test was completed before the experiment started, where one of the experimenters was present in the room with the participant.</p>
<h3>Brain data pre-analyses</h3>
<p>Brain Electrical Source Analysis (BESA version 7.0) research software and BESA Connectivity (version 1.0) were used to analyze the EEG data. Epoch and filter settings were the same as in <a href="#ref4">Askvik et al. (2020)</a>.</p>
<p>Channels contaminated by movement artifacts were either removed or interpolated using spherical spline interpolation (<a href="#ref41">Perrin et al., 1989</a>; <a href="#ref46">Picton et al., 2000</a>). Up to 10% of channels could be defined as bad. Artifact correction was applied using manual and semi-automatic artifact correction with fitting spatial filters (<a href="#ref7">Berg and Scherg, 1994</a>; <a href="#ref23">Ille et al., 2002</a>; <a href="#ref19">Fujioka et al., 2011</a>).</p>
<p>The mean number of accepted trials out of 15 was 14.1 (<i>SD</i> = 1.1) for handwriting and 13.3 (<i>SD</i> = 1.3) for typewriting. To analyze oscillatory brain activity, a time-frequency analysis in brain space was then performed on accepted trials, see <a href="#ref4">Askvik et al. (2020)</a> for details. Optimal separation of brain activity was achieved using source montages derived from a multiple source model where waveforms separated different brain activities (<a href="#ref50">Scherg and Berg, 1991</a>). Using this procedure, the time-frequency content of different brain regions can be separated even if their activities severely overlap at the surface of the scalp (<a href="#ref21">Hoechstetter et al., 2004</a>). Then, the connectivity measure of Coherence was applied, resulting in a symmetric connectivity matrix with the upper and lower triangular matrix showing pairwise clusters symmetrical to the diagonal.</p>
<h3>Statistical analyses</h3>
<p>Probability of significance in connectivity values was tested with BESA Statistics 2.0, where connectivity measures for all participants were computed and the significant connectivity regions were used as guides in finding the extent of connectivity between the two experimental conditions of writing and typing. A combination of permutation tests and data clustering was employed. Permutation tests were applied to each set of time samples belonging to one frequency bin (<a href="#ref51">Simes, 1986</a>). Data clusters that showed a significant effect between conditions were assigned initial cluster values. Using within-group ANOVA’s, these initial cluster values were passed through permutation and assigned new clusters so that the significance of the initial cluster could be determined. A Bonferroni correction was used for multiple comparisons. As in <a href="#ref4">Askvik et al. (2020)</a>, cluster alpha, the significance level for building clusters in time and/or frequency, was set at 0.01 and the number of permutations was set at 10.000. Low- and high cut-offs for frequency were kept at 2 Hz and 60 Hz respectively, and epochs were set from −250 to 4,500 ms.</p> <h2>Results</h2>
<p>High-density EEGs were recorded during the experimental handwriting and typing conditions. Artifacts were removed from the raw EEG recordings, then the inverse problem was solved by using a 4-shell ellipsoidal head model to analyze the brain regions of interest. The time series of the reconstructed sources were obtained and transformed into the frequency domain using complex demodulation. The functional connectivity between the reconstructed sources was computed using the coherence method. A high-resolution functional connectivity matrix was obtained, and the corresponding functional brain network was visualized. Network measures were then extracted from the network (<a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>).</p>
<p>A time-frequency display is shown for three important brain regions in <a href="#fig2">Figure 2</a> where the power/amplitude for each time is normalized to the mean power/amplitude of the baseline epoch for that frequency. The x-axis shows the time relative to the event, the y-axis shows the frequencies. The intensities are displayed as a color-coded plot.</p>

<p><b>Figure 2</b>. Grand average coherence results. Displayed are only three selected connectivity areas of interest for the two experimental conditions handwriting and typewriting (left panels), together with the difference in coherence between writing and typing and their permutation results (right panels). Connectivity areas of large significant difference between handwriting and typewriting included brain regions CR-PM (central right-parietal midline, top two panels on the left) and CL-PM (central left-parietal midline, middle two panels on the left), as well as CM-CR (central midline-central right, bottom two panels on the left), in frequencies ranging from theta (2 Hz) and up to gamma (60 Hz). The x-axes display the time interval from baseline to 4,500 ms of recordings of the trial. The signal magnitude reflects the estimated neural connectivity strength between the various brain areas during the experimental conditions compared to baseline activity (−250 to 0 ms). Positive connectivity is shown as (shades of) red-colored contours in handwriting/typewriting plots (panels on the left) and difference plots between handwriting and typewriting/permutation results (panels on the right). Positive connectivity is significantly more prominent in lower frequencies (theta 3.5–7.5 Hz and alpha 8–12.5) for handwriting (0 ≤ <i>p</i> &lt; 0.05, see also <a href="#fig4">Figure 4</a>).</p></div>  
<p><a href="#fig2">Figure 2</a> displays the results of grand average coherence results from just three selected connectivity areas of interest for clarity, for the two experimental conditions handwriting and typewriting (left panels), together with the difference in coherence between writing and typing and their permutation results (right panels). Connectivity areas of large significant difference between writing and typing included central and parietal brain regions in frequencies ranging from theta (2 Hz) and up to gamma (60 Hz). The signal magnitude reflects estimated connectivity strength between brain areas compared to baseline (−250 to 0 ms) activity. Positive connectivity patterns are shown in (shades of) red. In the central and parietal areas, positive coherence patterns were more prominent in the lower frequencies (theta 3.5–7.5 Hz and alpha 7.5–12.5 Hz) for handwriting as opposed to typewriting. For handwriting, this activity appeared between 1,000 to 2000 ms and lasted throughout the trial.</p>
<h3>The connectivity matrix of writing over typing</h3>
<p>Comparisons between the two conditions handwriting and typewriting were computed for each participant with time-frequency displays (changes in amplitude over time). TSE displays were limited between frequency cut-offs of 2–60 Hz, while frequency and time were sampled at 1 Hz and 50 ms, respectively. Symmetric connectivity measures were then obtained from BESA Connectivity and a high-resolution functional connectivity matrix between the reconstructed sources was computed using the coherence method (<a href="#ref48">Rosenberg et al., 1989</a>). Here, the number of in-phase components of two brain source signals at a specific frequency were described, and the corresponding functional brain network was visualized in <a href="#fig3">Figure 3</a>. Finally, network measures were extracted from the network and presented in <a href="#fig4">Figure 4</a>.</p>

Thirty-two significant cluster differences marked in orange in <b>(A)</b> and fully described in <b>(B)</b> were found in the matrix and came out particularly significant in the parietal left (PL), parietal midline (PM), and parietal right (PR) areas.</p></div>  
<p><a href="#fig3">Figure 3A</a> displays the grand average connectivity matrix for writing compared to typing. The matrix offers a compact description of the pairwise connectivity between all separate regions of the brain. Throughout the matrix there is evidence for widespread theta/alpha coherence results (in red) particularly between areas parietal-right, parietal-mid, and parietal-left and between areas central-right and central-left. These connectivity patterns are further illustrated in <a href="#fig3">Figure 3B</a> revealing a concentration of no less than 32 significant clusters (see <a href="#fig4">Figure 4</a> for details) for handwriting, but not for typewriting. A pair of clusters will represent a single link between the corresponding pair of sources. The 32 significant clusters thus represent 16 significant connections.</p>
<h3>Main statistical effects</h3>
<p>Analyses were run to test for statistical differences in brain activity between handwriting and typewriting. <a href="#fig4">Figure 4</a> displays the detailed effects (<i>t</i>-tests) of the permutation results. These results showed 32 significant cluster differences between the two experimental conditions. The <i>t</i>-tests revealed significant differences in connectivity primarily in the theta (3.5–7.5 Hz) and alpha (8–12.5 Hz) range within three positive clusters (in orange), namely in the parietal left (PL), parietal midline (PM), and parietal right (PR) areas (see also <a href="#fig3">Figure 3</a>). These positive clusters suggest separate processes (differences in band power) between handwriting and typewriting mainly in the parietal but also in the central regions.</p>
<p>As can be seen in <a href="#fig4">Figure 4</a>, significant clusters of differences in band power were found mainly in parietal and central brain regions.</p>
<h3>Network measures</h3>
<p><a href="#fig5">Figure 5</a> shows the adjacency matrix for handwriting in the form of a hub, nodes, and edges of a simplified theoretical network (<a href="#fig5">Figure 5A</a>). Hubs have a higher degree of involvement in the network than nodes as expressed through their functional connectivity values (edges). <a href="#fig5">Figure 5B</a> shows the brain connectivity network results of handwriting compared to typewriting in this experiment. Proposed hubs (in red, ≥ 4 departures/arrivals) and nodes (in black, ≤ 3 departures/arrivals) interacting between brain regions PL, PM, PR and CL, CM, CR show widespread theta/alpha coherence patterns indicating stronger connectivity when writing as opposed to typing (<a href="#fig5">Figure 5C</a>).</p>

<p>This study investigated brain electrical connectivity as a function of handwriting and typewriting using high-density EEG in young adults. Participants used a digital pen to write visually presented words directly on a touchscreen and used a keyboard to type the words. Going beyond our previous study where we reported synchronized theta oscillations in parietal and central brain regions when children and students wrote by hand (<a href="#ref4">Askvik et al., 2020</a>), the present study performed connectivity analyses on the brain data of 36 students to explore underlying differences in coherence patterns when participants were typing versus writing by hand.</p>
<p>Focusing on brain connectivity that has shown to facilitate learning and memory (<a href="#ref43">Pfurtscheller and Lopes da Silva, 1999</a>), we investigated parietal and central areas in specific frequency bands. These brain areas have been associated with attentional mechanisms and cognitive processes in visual perception (<a href="#ref44">Pfurtscheller et al., 1994</a>; <a href="#ref59">Vilhelmsen et al., 2019</a>) and language (<a href="#ref9">Brownsett and Wise, 2010</a>; <a href="#ref5">Benedek et al., 2014</a>), and have strong links to sensorimotor cortex (<a href="#ref58">Velasques et al., 2007</a>). We set out to investigate whether it is actually the act of forming the letters by hand itself that brings about larger connectivity in the brain, since perceptual, motor, and higher cognitive areas are more involved during handwriting as opposed to typewriting.</p>
<h3>Increased connectivity in theta/alpha range for handwriting</h3>
<p>The present findings revealed increased connectivity for handwriting over typewriting, suggesting that different underlying cognitive processes are involved in the two tasks. Increased connectivity within the theta (3.5–7.5 Hz) and alpha (8–12.5 Hz) frequency bands has been linked to mechanisms underlying sensorimotor integration (<a href="#ref8">Bland and Oddie, 2001</a>). As increased connectivity in the brain was observed only when writing by hand and not when simply pressing keys on the keyboard, our findings can be taken as evidence that handwriting promotes learning. Interestingly, the increased connectivity between the various brain regions seems to be linked to the specific sensorimotor processes that are so typical in handwriting.</p>
<p>The theta/alpha connectivity patterns found in the present study may indicate that different neural networks are involved in handwriting and typewriting. Interestingly, whereas connectivity in the alpha band is considered highly task-specific and is said to correspond to long-term memory performance, theta connectivity seems to be related to working memory and the ability to apprehend novel information (<a href="#ref29">Klimesch et al., 1994</a>, <a href="#ref28">1996</a>, <a href="#ref27">2001</a>; <a href="#ref26">Klimesch, 1999</a>; <a href="#ref47">Raghavachari et al., 2001</a>; <a href="#ref14">Clouter et al., 2017</a>). Thus, the enhanced brain connectivity for handwriting appears not to be related to differences in muscular involvement. It has also been proposed that hippocampal activity is reflected within the theta band (<a href="#ref29">Klimesch et al., 1994</a>), adding further support for the benefits of handwriting in terms of learning and memory formation.</p>
<p>Lower frequencies are considered especially suited for facilitating communication over longer distances in the brain, and are often reported to “gate” the occurrence of faster oscillations, for example when theta oscillations in humans are proposed to gate gamma (&gt; 30 Hz) oscillations (<a href="#ref13">Canolty et al., 2006</a>; <a href="#ref20">Halgren et al., 2018</a>). In general, this theta-to-gamma cross-frequency coupling can be linked to gamma networks desynchronizing and theta networks synchronizing during encoding, retrieval, and episodic memory formation (<a href="#ref11">Burke et al., 2013</a>). Others have suggested that theta connectivity activity (see <a href="#fig3">Figure 3</a>) is positively correlated with a brain region’s gamma power, suggesting a potent low-frequency mechanism for communication between brain regions (<a href="#ref54">Solomon et al., 2017</a>). Exploring these interactions may disclose the relationship between a brain region’s functional connectivity and local processing. Our results reflect such a low-frequency mechanism for interregional communication. Present findings of theta synchrony for handwriting suggest that low-frequency connections support the integration of information during memory formation, and follow from earlier studies that have reported low-frequency entrainment to be essential to cognition (<a href="#ref54">Solomon et al., 2017</a>).</p>
<h3>The importance of handwriting practice in a learning environment</h3>
<p>Handwriting requires fine motor control over the fingers, and it forces students to pay attention to what they are doing. Typing, on the other hand, requires mechanical and repetitive movements that trade awareness for speed. Our results reveal that whenever handwriting movements are included as a learning strategy, more of the brain gets stimulated, resulting in the formation of more complex neural network connectivity. It appears that the movements related to typewriting do not activate these connectivity networks the same way that handwriting does. The concurrent spatiotemporal pattern from vision, motor commands, and proprioceptive feedback provided through fine hand and finger movements, is lacking in typewriting, where only a simple key press is required to produce the entire wanted form (<a href="#ref32">Longcamp et al., 2006</a>; <a href="#ref24">James, 2010</a>; <a href="#ref60">Vinci-Booher et al., 2016</a>, <a href="#ref61">2021</a>). In the present study, participants only used their right index finger for typing to prevent undesired crossover effects between the two hemispheres.</p>
<p>Thus, the ongoing substitution of handwriting by typewriting in almost every educational setting may seem somewhat misguided as it could affect the learning process in a negative way (<a href="#ref1">Alonso, 2015</a>; <a href="#ref35">Mangen and Balsvik, 2016</a>; <a href="#ref3">Arnold et al., 2017</a>). The present findings suggest that the intricate and precisely controlled handwriting movements have a beneficial impact on the brain’s connectivity patterns related to learning and remembering. The present study did not find evidence of such positive activation patterns when using a keyboard.</p>
<p>Even though maintaining handwriting practice in school is crucial, it is also important to keep up in the ever-developing digital world. Children should receive handwriting training at school to learn to write by hand successfully, and, at the same time learn to use a keyboard, depending on the task at hand. The present study shows that the neural connectivity patterns underlying handwriting and typewriting are distinctly different. Hence, being aware of when to write by hand or use a digital device is crucial, whether it is to take lecture notes to learn new concepts or to write longer essays.</p> <h2>Data availability statement</h2>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://pola.rs/posts/polars_birds_eye_view/">https://pola.rs/posts/polars_birds_eye_view/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39363675">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A good library abstracts away many complexities for its user. Polars is no different in this regard, as it maintains a philosophy that queries you write should be performant by default without knowing any of the internals. However, many users are interested in what happens under the hood either as a learning experience or to squeeze that last bit of performance out of their queries. In this blog post, we will provide a bird’s eye view of how Polars works and in future posts we will deep dive into each of its components.</p>
<h2 id="high-level-overview">High level overview</h2>
<p>So, what is Polars? A short description would be “a query engine with a DataFrame frontend”. This is too high level even for a bird’s eye view. So let’s dive into the two elements, DataFrame and query engine, a bit more by looking at how a query gets executed. By taking a step-by-step journey through the execution of a query, we can observe each component in action and understand its role and purpose.</p>
<p>From a bird’s eye view, the execution of a query goes as follows. First we parse the query and validate it into a logical plan. The plan describes what the user intends to do, but not the how. Then our query optimizer traverses this plan (several times) to optimize any unnecessary work and produces an optimized logical plan. Following this optimization phase, the query planner transforms this logical plan into a physical plan, which outlines how the query is to be executed. This finalized physical plan serves as the ultimate input for the actual execution of the query and runs our compute kernels.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://pola.rs/_astro/birds-eye-overview.6f8aa92d_ZVHkQh.webp" width="3074" height="209" loading="lazy" decoding="async"></p>
<h2 id="query">Query</h2>
<p>When you interact with Polars, you use our DataFrame API. This API is specifically designed to allow for parallel execution and with performance in mind. Writing a Polars query in that sense is writing a small program (or this case query) in a domain-specific language (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language">DSL</a>) designed by Polars. This DSL has its own set of rules governing which queries are valid and which ones are not.</p>
<p>For this post, let’s use the famous NYE taxi dataset with taxi trips<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-1" id="user-content-fnref-1" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label">1</a></sup>. In the example below we calculate the average cost per minute for a trip over 25 dollars by zone. This case is simple enough to be easily understood while containing enough depth to showcase the purpose of the query engine.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>import</span><span> polars </span><span>as</span><span> pl</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>query </span><span>=</span><span> (</span></span>

<span><span>    .</span><span>filter</span><span>(pl.</span><span>col</span><span>(</span><span>"total_amount"</span><span>) </span><span>&gt;</span><span> 25</span><span>)</span></span>
<span><span>    .</span><span>group_by</span><span>(</span><span>"Zone"</span><span>)</span></span>
<span><span>    .</span><span>agg</span><span>(</span></span>

<span><span>        ).</span><span>mean</span><span>().</span><span>alias</span><span>(</span><span>"cost_per_minute"</span><span>)</span></span>
<span><span>    ).</span><span>sort</span><span>(</span><span>"cost_per_minute"</span><span>,descending</span><span>=</span><span>True</span><span>)</span></span>
<span><span>)</span></span></code></pre>
<p>The query above is of type <code>LazyFrame</code>. It returns instantly while the NY taxi trips dataset is over 3 million rows, so what has happened? The statement defines the query, but does not yet execute it. This concept is known as lazy evaluation and is one of the key strengths of Polars. If you look into the data structure on the Rust side, you will see it contains two elements: a <code>logical_plan</code> and configuration flags for the optimizer <code>opt_state</code>.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>pub</span><span> struct</span><span> LazyFrame</span><span> {</span></span>
<span><span>    pub</span><span> logical_plan</span><span>:</span><span> LogicalPlan</span><span>,</span></span>
<span><span>    pub</span><span>(</span><span>crate</span><span>) opt_state</span><span>:</span><span> OptState</span><span>,</span></span>
<span><span>}</span></span></code></pre>
<p>The logical plan is a tree with the data sources as leaves of the tree and the transformations as nodes. The plan describes the structure of a query and the expressions it contains.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>pub</span><span> enum</span><span> LogicalPlan</span><span> {</span></span>
<span><span>    /// Filter on a boolean mask</span></span>
<span><span>    Selection</span><span> {</span></span>
<span><span>        input</span><span>:</span><span> Box</span><span>&lt;</span><span>LogicalPlan</span><span>&gt;,</span></span>
<span><span>        predicate</span><span>:</span><span> Expr</span><span>,</span></span>
<span><span>    },</span></span>
<span><span>    /// Column selection</span></span>

<span><span>        expr</span><span>:</span><span> Vec</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Expr</span><span>&gt;,</span></span>
<span><span>        input</span><span>:</span><span> Box</span><span>&lt;</span><span>LogicalPlan</span><span>&gt;,</span></span>
<span><span>        schema</span><span>:</span><span> SchemaRef</span><span>,</span></span>
<span><span>        options</span><span>:</span><span> ProjectionOptions</span><span>,</span></span>
<span><span>    },</span></span>
<span><span>    /// Join operation</span></span>
<span><span>    Join</span><span> {</span></span>
<span><span>        input_left</span><span>:</span><span> Box</span><span>&lt;</span><span>LogicalPlan</span><span>&gt;,</span></span>
<span><span>        input_right</span><span>:</span><span> Box</span><span>&lt;</span><span>LogicalPlan</span><span>&gt;,</span></span>
<span><span>        schema</span><span>:</span><span> SchemaRef</span><span>,</span></span>
<span><span>        left_on</span><span>:</span><span> Vec</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Expr</span><span>&gt;,</span></span>
<span><span>        right_on</span><span>:</span><span> Vec</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Expr</span><span>&gt;,</span></span>
<span><span>        options</span><span>:</span><span> Arc</span><span>&lt;</span><span>JoinOptions</span><span>&gt;,</span></span>
<span><span>    },</span></span>
<span><span>    ...</span></span>
<span><span>}</span></span></code></pre>
<p>One important step when converting your query into a logical plan is validation. Polars knows the schema of the data upfront and can validate if the transformations are correct. This ensures you don’t run into any errors halfway through executing a query. For instance, defining a query where you select a column that does not exist returns an error before execution</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>pl</span><span>.</span><span>LazyFrame</span><span>([]).</span><span>select</span><span>(pl.</span><span>col</span><span>(</span><span>"does_not_exist"</span><span>))</span></span></code></pre>
<pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>polars.exceptions.ColumnNotFoundError: column_does_not_exist</span></span>
<span><span></span></span>
<span><span>Error originated just after this operation:</span></span>
<span><span>DF []; PROJECT */0 COLUMNS; SELECTION: "None"</span></span></code></pre>
<p>We can view the logical plan by calling <code>show_graph</code> on a <code>LazyFrame</code>:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>query</span><span>.</span><span>show_graph</span><span>(optimized</span><span>=</span><span>False</span><span>)</span></span></code></pre>
<p><img alt="non optimized query plan" src="https://pola.rs/_astro/non-optimized.82896225_ZbNItr.svg" width="984" height="383" loading="lazy" decoding="async"></p>
<h2 id="query-optimization">Query Optimization</h2>
<p>The goal of the query optimizer is to optimize the <code>LogicalPlan</code> for performance. It does this by traversing the tree structure and modifying/adding/removing nodes.There are many types of optimizations that will lead to faster execution, for instance changing the order of operations. Generally, you want <code>filter</code> operations to occur as early as possible as it allows you to throw away any unused data and avoid unnessary work. In the example we can show our optimized logical plan with the same <code>show_graph</code> function:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>query</span><span>.</span><span>show_graph</span><span>()</span></span></code></pre>
<p><img alt="optimized query plan" src="https://pola.rs/_astro/optimized.e46e3f3c_ZSiab5.svg" width="1083" height="383" loading="lazy" decoding="async"></p>
<p>At first glance, it might look like both plans (optimized vs non optimized) are the same. However, two important optimizations have occured <strong>Projection pushdown</strong> and <strong>Predicate pushdown</strong>.</p>
<p>Polars has analyzed the query and noted that only use a small set of columns is used. For the trip data there are four columns. For the zone data there are two columns. Reading in the entire dataset would be wasteful as there is no need for the other columns. Therefore, by analyzing your query, <strong>Projection Pushdown</strong> will speed up reading in the data significantly. You can see the optimization in the leaf nodes under $\pi$  4/19 and $\pi$ 2/4.</p>
<p>With <strong>Predicate pushdown</strong> Polars filters data as close to the source as possible. This avoids reading in data that a later stage in the query will be discarded. The filter node has been moved to the parquet reader under $\sigma$ which indicates our reader will immediately remove rows which do not match our filter. The next join operation will a lot faster as there is less data coming in.</p>
<p>Polars supports a range of optimizations which can be viewed <a href="https://docs.pola.rs/user-guide/lazy/optimizations/">here</a>.</p>
<h2 id="query-execution">Query Execution</h2>
<p>Once the logical plan has been optimized, it is time for execution. The logical plan is a blueprint for what the user wants to execute, not the how. This is where the physical plan comes into play. A naive solution would be to have one join algorithm and one sort algorithm; that way, you could execute the logical plan directly. However, this comes at a huge performance cost, because knowing the characteristics of your data and the environment you run in allows Polars to select more specialized algorithms. Thus there is not one join algorithm, but multiple, each with their own unique style and performance. The query planner converts the LogicalPlan into a PhysicalPlan and picks the best algorithms for the query. Then our compute engine performs the operations. This post will not go into much detail about the execution model of our engines or how it is able to work so fast. That is left for another time.</p>
<p>When we look the performance difference of both plans (optimized vs non-optimized), we can see a 4x improvement. This is the power of lazy execution and using a query engine instead of eagerly evaluating every expression in order. It allows the engine to optimize and avoid unnecessary work. This whole improvement comes at zero cost for the user as all they have to do is write the query. All the complexity is hidden inside the query engine.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>%%</span><span>time</span></span>
<span><span>query</span><span>.</span><span>collect</span><span>(no_optimization</span><span>=</span><span>True</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></span></code></pre>
<pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>CPU times: user 2.45 s, sys: 1.18 s, total: 3.62 s</span></span>
<span><span>Wall time: 544 ms</span></span></code></pre>
<pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>%%</span><span>time</span></span>
<span><span>query</span><span>.</span><span>collect</span><span>()</span><span>;</span></span></code></pre>
<pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>CPU times: user 616 ms, sys: 54.2 ms, total: 670 ms</span></span>
<span><span>Wall time: 135 ms</span></span></code></pre>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>During this post we covered the main components of Polars. Hopefully by now you will have a better understanding of how Polars works from its API down to execution. The next posts will dive deeper into every component, so stay tuned!</p>

          <p>We’re Fly.io, we’re a new public cloud that lets you put your compute where it matters: near your users. Today we’re announcing that you can do this with GPUs too, allowing you to do AI workloads on the edge. Want to find out more? Keep reading.</p><h2 id="ai-is-pretty-fly"><a href="#ai-is-pretty-fly" aria-label="Anchor"></a>AI is pretty fly</h2>
<p>AI is apparently a bit of a <em>thing</em> (maybe even <em>an thing</em> come to think about it). We’ve seen entire industries get transformed in the wake of ChatGPT existing (somehow it’s only been around for a year, I can’t believe it either). It’s likely to leave a huge impact on society as a whole in the same way that the Internet did once we got search engines. Like any good venture-capital funded infrastructure provider, we want to enable you to do hilarious things with AI using industrial-grade muscle.</p>

<p>Fly.io lets you run a full-stack app - or an entire dev platform based on the <a href="https://fly.io/docs/machines/">Fly Machines API</a> - close to your users. Fly.io GPUs let you attach an <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/a100/">Nvidia A100</a> to whatever you’re building, harnessing the full power of CUDA with more VRAM than your local 4090 can shake a ray-traced stick at. With these cards (or whatever you call a GPU attached to SXM fabric), AI/ML workloads are at your fingertips. You can <a href="https://fly.io/blog/transcribing-on-fly-gpu-machines/">recognize speech</a>, segment text, summarize articles, synthesize images, and more at speeds that would make your homelab blush. You can even set one up as your programming companion with <a href="https://github.com/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-Coder">your model of choice</a> in case you’ve just not been feeling it with the output of <em>other</em> models changing over time.</p>

<p>If you want to find out more about what these cards are and what using them is like, check out <a href="https://fly.io/blog/what-are-these-gpus-really/">What are these “GPUs” really?</a> It covers the history of GPUs and why it’s ironic that the cards we offer are called “Graphics Processing Units” in the first place.</p>
<h2 id="fly-io-gpus-in-action"><a href="#fly-io-gpus-in-action" aria-label="Anchor"></a>Fly.io GPUs in Action</h2>
<p>We want you to deploy your own code with your favorite models on top of Fly.io’s cloud backbone. Fly.io GPUs make this really easy.</p>

<p>You can get a GPU app running <a href="https://ollama.ai/">Ollama</a> (our friends in text generation) in two steps:</p>

<ol>
<li>Put this in your <code>fly.toml</code>:

<p>Being able to spin up GPUs is great, but where Fly.io really shines is inference at the edge.</p>

<p>Let’s say you have an app that lets users enter ingredients they have in their kitchen and receive a sandwich recipe. Your users expect their recipes <em>instantly</em> (or at least as fast as the other leading apps). Seconds count when you need an emergency sandwich.</p>
<div><p>


It’s depressingly customary in the AI industry to cherry-pick outputs. This was not cherry-picked. I used <a href="https://ollama.ai/library/yi:34b">yi:34b</a> to generate this recipe. I’m not sure what a taco salad sandwich is, but I might be willing to try it.</p>
</div>
<p><img alt="A conversation between a user and an artificial intelligence. The user asks: &quot;What kind of sandwich can I make with an egg, a taco shell, and a pound of ground beef?&quot; The AI responds: &quot; You can make a breakfast taco or a taco salad sandwich with the ingredients you have. Here's how to prepare each: for the breakfast taco. Cook the pound of ground beef in a pan until browned. Season with salt, pepper, and any other desired spices like chili powder or taco seasoning. While the beef is cooking, fry an egg (or scramble it if you prefer) in another pan. Warm up the taco shell in the oven or microwave according to the package instructions. Assemble the taco by placing the ground cooked beef in the taco shell followed by the fried egg. You can also add any additional toppings like diced onions avocados, avocado, salsa or cheese if you have them. Serve with a side of hot sauce or sour cream if desired. For the taco salad sandwich: Prepare the ground beef as in the breakfast taco recipe above. Instead of frying an egg, you can cook it sunny side up or over easy depending on your preference. Crumble the taco shell into small pieces and mix them with the cooked ground beef. Assemble the sandwich by layering the crumbled taco shell mixture and ground beef in two slices of bread. Top with the fried egg and any additional toppings you like such as shredded lettuce, diced tomatoes, or sliced olives. Serve with a side of salsa or ranch dressing if desired. Both options are hardy and can be easily customized based on your taste preferences. Enjoy!&quot;" src="https://fly.io/blog/fly-io-has-gpus-now/assets/sandwich-recipes.webp"></p>

<p>In the previous snippet, we deployed our app to ord (<code>primary_region = "ord"</code>). The good news is that our model returns a result really quickly and users in Chicago get instant sandwich recipes. It’s a good experience for users near your datacentre, and you can do this on any half decent cloud provider.</p>

<p>But surely people outside of Chicago need sandwiches too. Amsterdam has sandwich fiends as well. And sometimes it takes too long to have their requests leap across the pond. The speed of light is only so fast after all. Don’t worry, we’ve got your back. Fly.io has GPUs in datacentres all over the world. Even more, we’ll let you run <em>the same program</em> with the same public IP address and the same TLS certificates in any regions with GPU support.</p>

<p>Don’t believe us? See how you can scale your app up in Amsterdam with one command:</p>
<div>
  <pre><code>fly scale count 2 --region ams
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>It’s that easy.</p>
<h2 id="actually-on-demand"><a href="#actually-on-demand" aria-label="Anchor"></a>Actually On-Demand</h2>
<p>GPUs are powerful parallel processing packages, but they’re not cheap! Once we have enough people wanting to turn their fridge contents into tasty sandwiches, keeping a GPU or two running makes sense. But we’re just a small app still growing our user base while also funding the latest large sandwich model research. We want to only pay for GPUs when a user makes a request.</p>

<p>Let’s open up that <code>fly.toml</code> again, and add a section called <code>services</code>, and we’ll include instructions on how we want our app to scale up and down:</p>
<div>
  <pre><code><span>[[services]]</span>
  <span>internal_port</span> <span>=</span> <span>8080</span>
  <span>protocol</span> <span>=</span> <span>"tcp"</span>
  <span>auto_stop_machines</span> <span>=</span> <span>true</span>
  <span>auto_start_machines</span> <span>=</span> <span>true</span>
  <span>min_machines_running</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Now when no one needs sandwich recipes, you don’t pay for GPU time.</p>
<h2 id="the-deets"><a href="#the-deets" aria-label="Anchor"></a>The Deets</h2>
<p>We have GPUs ready to use in several US and EU regions and Sydney. You can deploy your sandwich, music generation, or AI illustration apps to:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/a100/">Ampere A100s</a> with 40gb of RAM for $2.50/hr
</li><li><a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/a100/">Ampere A100s</a> with 80gb of RAM for $3.50/hr
</li><li><a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/l40/">Lovelace L40s</a> are coming soon (pricing TBD)
</li></ul>

<p>By default, anything you deploy to GPUs will use eight heckin’ <a href="https://www.amd.com/en/processors/epyc-server-cpu-family">AMD EPYC</a> CPU cores, and you can attach volumes up to 500 gigabytes. We’ll even give you discounts for reserved instances and dedicated hosts if you ask nicely.</p>

<p>We hope you have fun with these new cards and we’d love to see what you can do with them! Reach out to us on X (formerly Twitter) or <a href="https://community.fly.io/">the community forum</a> and share what you’ve been up to. We’d love to see what we can make easier!</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/13/mozilla-downsizes-as-it-refocuses-on-firefox-and-ai-read-the-memo/">https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/13/mozilla-downsizes-as-it-refocuses-on-firefox-and-ai-read-the-memo/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39362481">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
				<p id="speakable-summary">After <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/en/mozilla/a-new-chapter-for-mozilla-laura-chambers-expanded-role/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">installing</a> a new interim CEO earlier this month, Mozilla, the organization behind the Firefox browser, is making some major changes to its product strategy, TechCrunch has learned.</p>
<p>Specifically, Mozilla plans to scale back its investment in a number of products, including its VPN, Relay and, somewhat remarkably, its Online Footprint Scrubber, which launched <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/06/mozilla-monitors-new-service-removes-your-personal-info-from-data-broker-sites-automatically/">only a week ago</a>. Mozilla will also shut down <a href="https://hubs.mozilla.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hubs</a>, the 3D virtual world it <a href="https://blog.mozvr.com/introducing-hubs-a-new-way-to-get-together-online/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launched</a> back in 2018, and scale back its investment in its <a href="http://mozilla.social/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mozilla.social</a> Mastodon instance. The layoffs will affect roughly 60 employees. Bloomberg previously reported <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/firefox-maker-mozilla-cutting-60-191639445.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the layoffs.</a></p>
<p>Going forward, the company said in an internal memo, Mozilla will focus on bringing “trustworthy AI into Firefox.” To do so, it will bring together the teams that work on Pocket, Content and AI/Ml.</p>
<p>Mozilla started expanding its product portfolio in recent years, all while its flagship product, Firefox, kept losing market share. And while the organization was often sharply criticized for this, its leadership argued that diversifying its product portfolio beyond Firefox was necessary to ensure Mozilla’s survival in the long run. Firefox, after all, provided the vast majority of Mozilla’s income, but it also meant the organization was essentially dependent on Google to continue this deal. With these changes, it now looks like Mozilla may refocus on Firefox once more, something that will surely make many hardcore Firefox fans quite happy.</p>
<p>Here is the full internal memo:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Scaling back investment <a href="http://mozilla.social/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-stringify-link="http://mozilla.social/" data-sk="tooltip_parent">mozilla.social</a></strong>: With&nbsp;<a href="http://mozilla.social/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-stringify-link="http://mozilla.social/" data-sk="tooltip_parent">mozilla.social</a>, we made a big bet in 2023 to build a safer, better social media experience, based on Mastodon and the Fediverse. Our initial approach was based on a belief that Mozilla needed to quickly reach large scale in order to effectively shape the future of social media. It was a noble idea but one we struggled to execute. While we resourced&nbsp;<a href="http://mozilla.social/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-stringify-link="http://mozilla.social/" data-sk="tooltip_parent">mozilla.social</a>&nbsp;heavily to pursue this ambitious idea, in retrospect a more modest approach would have enabled us to participate in the space with considerably greater agility. The actions we’re taking today will make this strategic correction, working through a much smaller team to participate in the Mastodon ecosystem and more rapidly bring smaller experiments to people that choose to live on the&nbsp;<a href="http://mozilla.social/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-stringify-link="http://mozilla.social/" data-sk="tooltip_parent">mozilla.social</a>&nbsp;instance.</p>
<p><strong>Protection Experimentation &amp; Identity (PXI)</strong>: We’re scaling back investment in some of our standalone consumer products in the Security and Privacy space. We are reducing investment in market segments that competitors crowd and where it is challenging to deliver a differentiated offering. Specifically, we plan to reduce our investments in VPN, Relay, and Online Footprint Scrubber. We will maintain investment in products addressing customer needs in growing market segments.</p>
<p><strong>Hubs</strong>: Since early 2023, we have experienced a shift in the market for 3D virtual worlds. With the exception of gaming, education, and a handful of niche use cases, demand has moved away from 3D virtual worlds. This is impacting all industry players. Hubs’ user and customer bases are not robust enough to justify continuing to dedicate resources against the headwinds of the unfavorable shift in demand. We will wind down the service and communicate a graceful exit plan to customers.</p>
<p><strong>Right-sizing the People Team</strong><br>
Given the reduction in staffing and lower headcount budget moving forward in MozProd, some roles have been consolidated in the People and other support services orgs so that we are offering the right level of support to our product portfolio. Optimizing our org to sharpen focus.</p>
<p>In 2023, generative AI began rapidly shifting the industry landscape. Mozilla seized an opportunity to bring trustworthy AI into Firefox, largely driven by the Fakespot acquisition and the product integration work that followed. Additionally, finding great content is still a critical use case for the internet. Therefore, as part of the changes today, we will be bringing together Pocket, Content, and the AI/ML teams supporting content with the Firefox Organization. More details on the specific organizational changes will follow shortly. Within MozProd, there are no changes within MDN, Ads, or Fakespot. There are also no changes to Legal/Policy, Finance &amp; Business Operations, Marketing, or Strategy &amp; Operations.</p></blockquote>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <p>I’m going to lay out some fascinating facts, and let you decide whether we are likely to dim the sun within the next 10 years.</p><p>Firstly, it’s much easier to artificially dim the sun than most people imagine.</p><p>100 planes injecting sulfur particles into the stratosphere would dim the sun by about 1%, and cool the earth by about 1°C.</p><figure><img src="https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/FNKxDvFN2dsBKjnHBGn31nQFgSxL8Ob50wXGQ8c8Fr8V9ocWvEJJ3Depj08MKlZRTftHmEw8XjLbKUIlbBT1rFa3EZ7FivhAGpUX-nS3v1HT6qPO8ZHxpKu-Oc7gbD7RJ4pE0M8csC_2BlEHqVviems" alt="" loading="lazy" width="666" height="457"><figcaption><a href="https://ben-james.notion.site/Sources-geoengineering-925832b122304a3b83c5d889acdea2fd?ref=climate.benjames.io">Sources</a></figcaption></figure><p>For context, our current sulfur dioxide emissions (from fossil fuels) <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/so-emissions-by-world-region-in-million-tonnes?ref=climate.benjames.io">are</a> &gt;10x bigger than the 1.2m tons shown above. The difference is the height of injection. We’d be putting sulfur into the <em>stratosphere</em>, which is higher up than our normal sulfur emissions in the <em>troposphere</em>.</p><p>Spraying a form of sulfur from a plane is incredibly cheap. A full programme <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/aba7e7/meta?ref=climate.benjames.io">would cost less</a> than $20b per year. That’s <strong>much</strong> cheaper than carbon removal ($600b per year,<em> </em>to remove just 10% of annual emissions @ $100 / tCO2).</p><p>Modifying the earth like this is called geoengineering, and blocking out the sun with particles is called <strong>Solar Radiation Management (SRM)</strong>.</p><h2 id="srm-awoke-in-2023">SRM awoke in 2023</h2><p>Interest in SRM spiked in 2023, after years of being too controversial to discuss. Here are a few reasons why.</p><h4 id="1we-don%E2%80%99t-know-why-2023-was-so-hot">#1 - We don’t know why 2023 was so hot</h4><p>The climate data from 2023 is scary, because we <em>do not understand </em>why 2023 was so warm. El Niño and low-sulfur fuels had an impact, but their effects were anticipated, and don’t fully explain the temperatures that we saw.</p><p>The actual warming in 2023 <a href="https://www.theclimatebrink.com/p/2023s-unexpected-and-unexplained?ref=climate.benjames.io">fell far outside of scientists’ predictions</a>. This is what hitting a climate feedback loop looks like.</p><figure><img src="https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/VDFNQQrVahE_NxvPW4IgvmtB_L7EzgyLr2wA5L2jeGNpz8IkrPu_oNnRsRxctbTELDsyRjwsJHgHBOoNy5NoBtpCzsd6ki1uu-bvJiJHO1oLYJ7AcxzX6oFgbrcV-BDvQIy4o56X4TCei0Pcmyu4b94" alt="" loading="lazy" width="702" height="500"></figure><h4 id="2billionaires-are-getting-interested">#2 - Billionaires are getting interested</h4><p>It only takes one person rich enough to start a geoengineering programme.

Traditionally, they’ve self-censored on this topic, but this is changing. I highly recommend Robinson Meyer’s <a href="https://heatmap.news/technology/climate-tech-geoengineering-carbon-removal?ref=climate.benjames.io">fascinating account of this</a>.</li><li>The internet noise is rising from a stutter to a low hum. In 2023/24, people are talking about SRM. <a href="https://caseyhandmer.wordpress.com/2023/06/06/we-should-not-let-the-earth-overheat/?ref=climate.benjames.io">Casey Handmer</a>, <a href="https://www.keepcool.co/p/forcing-the-issue?ref=climate.benjames.io">Keep Cool</a>, <a href="https://www.economist.com/science-and-technology/2023/11/22/solar-geoengineering-is-becoming-a-respectable-idea?ref=climate.benjames.io">The Economist</a>, and the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20231010-sun-solar-geoengineering-ministry-for-the-future-kim-stanley-robinson?ref=climate.benjames.io">BBC</a>, to name just a few.

It cooled the earth by <a href="https://www.usgs.gov/observatories/hvo/news/volcano-watch-pinatubo-effect-can-geoengineering-mimic-volcanic-processes?ref=climate.benjames.io">around 0.5°C</a>, and lasted for around <a href="https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/1510/global-effects-of-mount-pinatubo?ref=climate.benjames.io">two years</a>.</li><li>We already put sulfur into the atmosphere by burning fossil fuels. The sulfur that we’ve emitted so far is already reflecting sunlight, and is currently “masking” <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/downloads/report/IPCC_AR6_WGI_SPM.pdf?ref=climate.benjames.io">about 0.5°C of warming</a>. Without these particles, we’d already be at 1.8°C warming, not <a href="https://essd.copernicus.org/articles/15/2295/2023/?ref=climate.benjames.io">1.3°C</a>.</li></ol><p>In 2020, the International Maritime Organisation introduced limits on the sulfur content of shipping fuel. It reduced sulfur dioxide emissions by about 8 million tons in its first year - about 10% of the global total.</p><figure><img src="https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/F39rdFdSBFguRtWFaPpY4HOSWeqqytXmssL5o7borhUOQUUtS3PETnP7VGvsVAsBHA1JbcTQKXLTDSQGW55RfyGCpRieV35ms81F_XaTJ99wOPHwlHeaMRAqwnEQcuWU5FBmTjNLYdZXOWZnLW9Tu2Y" alt="" loading="lazy" width="726" height="462"><figcaption>Src: <a href="https://www.carbonbrief.org/analysis-how-low-sulphur-shipping-rules-are-affecting-global-warming/?ref=climate.benjames.io">CarbonBrief</a></figcaption></figure><p>This reduction in sulfur emissions has “un-masked” warming that was already there. It’s one of the reasons for the jump in warming in 2023 (though it doesn’t fully explain the abnormality).</p><h4 id="instant-effect">Instant effect</h4><p>Because SRM acts almost instantly, we’d need to phase it in gradually. If we began blasting maximum sulfur tomorrow, we’d cause a sharp fall in temperature that would be a nasty shock to the climate.</p><p>A better plan is to use sulfur to pause our warming at its current level (<a href="https://essd.copernicus.org/articles/15/2295/2023/?ref=climate.benjames.io">about 1.3 °C</a>) whilst we slash emissions. Eventually SRM would become redundant as methane’s warming falls off, and carbon removal takes effect.</p><figure><img src="https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/xAXIhmrdzEFZoqH_V00_M0aiSGrbVNC1Go1yBboTfvXXQxdiMHBjwNwRJI7I_9mYD0WIAR24E1bD-xV6bTfB2h75fCMTa1IcuuTcu8_Jygd6NuI0SudNXestPzAYGopfFiOWJD7OZEOg00W7FHOMKjA" alt="" loading="lazy" width="689" height="431"></figure><p>Sulfur disappears from the atmosphere quickly - it rains out after about a year. This means that once we’ve started SRM, it’s dangerous to suddenly stop. We need to keep spraying particles, all the time. If we suddenly stopped, the warming would spring back rapidly, causing a bad temperature shock. The correct way to stop is a gradual phase out.</p><figure><img src="https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/n5M4khdhMEN_Jad0vDJxJ5w3FyWgYN5btp5WGDa_FNMjqi0yI2RfiUKxDx7QjPhSIv3-0glODN_JqLe6PIxNwT0tVGuuRAXlZ_z7OJQL7mO0UbVyDKDG_X06BOHF2BHkpCiYHzCNO0VacEqJjXBo_aA" alt="" loading="lazy" width="716" height="262"><figcaption>Piles of sulfur in Canada - a by-product of sweetening oil from Alberta.

Cooling the planet does not remove the CO2 which has accumulated in our atmosphere. It doesn’t stop that CO2 from acidifying the oceans and irreversibly destroying marine biodiversity.</li><li>SRM could make us complacent about dramatically cutting emissions.</li><li>Sulfur increases acid rain (harmful to many life forms) and will likely harm the ozone.</li><li>If SRM is poorly implemented, it could dramatically change weather and rainfall patterns. For example, if sulfur is not injected near the equator, it will not evenly mix into the stratosphere, causing uneven cooling and heating.</li></ol><p>Shifted weather and rainfall patterns are one of the scariest possibilities of SRM. Even if deployed “correctly”, it’s unclear how SRM would affect rainfall and monsoons. Our <a href="https://geoengineering.environment.harvard.edu/sites/hwpi.harvard.edu/files/sgrp/files/irvine_etal_ncc_solar_geoengineering.pdf?m=1564406944&amp;ref=climate.benjames.io">current research</a> suggests that <em>when deployed in the correct locations and volumes</em>, SRM significantly moderates climate hazards everywhere, and significantly exacerbates them nowhere. But we will not know until we try.</p><p>Crucially, the biggest problems with SRM are probably not yet known. The side effects of putting sulfur into the stratosphere could be some of the most consequential unknowns in human history. Clearly, that’s a huge reason to do more research. But still - no matter how much research is done, when humanity tries to bend nature to its will, we can be sure that unintended consequences won’t be far behind.</p><h2 id="srm-will-be-deployed-without-your-consent">SRM will be deployed without your consent</h2><p>Geoengineering will not happen by international consensus. I find it impossible to imagine a UN mechanism approving something so universally contentious. </p><p>Rather, <em>someone will probably just do it</em>.</p><figure><img src="https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/w_CJlxp6lHw5zMWwjTP3ejL0S2YFJ7gVE-aWiSbxJUHSOkayvRJUoiu6KncEYOTmGYxGVsqTpu7A5ldyeqUC33ymMJkV9Zkby7yQwGlIAxeV_hk0peDJHY9Bqwwi1zio2QhW4vNFoBrSLVmAh5Z2i5A" alt="" loading="lazy" width="688" height="214"></figure><h4 id="a-country-with-no-choice">A country with no choice</h4><p>Some nations will soon have a simple choice: deploy geoengineering or cease to exist.</p><p>People underestimate how controversial it can become to <strong>not </strong>do SRM. Imagine you are the leader of a country close to the equator. Crop failures, extreme heat, and city-destroying cyclones mean that your people are without drinkable water, have nowhere to sleep, and cannot feed their children. Mass social unrest and physical violence become normal for your country. SRM is the only action that you can take to turn off the disasters, and prevent your government being overthrown.</p><p>Because SRM is so cheap, it’s completely feasible that one country could do this alone. (<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/50998056?ref=climate.benjames.io">The Ministry for the Future</a> and <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/57094295-termination-shock?ref=climate.benjames.io">Termination Shock</a> imagine interest from India, Singapore, Venice, Texas and The Netherlands)</p><p>Ultimately, the decision to turn on the SRM machines will not be made by climate scientists, or carefully calculated risks. It will be made on the basis of nations rising or falling - by starving populations, revolutionaries, and leaders with their back against a wall.</p><p><strong>The conditions only have to align for one country, at one time, to begin geoengineering.</strong></p><h4 id="a-billionaire">A billionaire</h4><p>There are three important things to know about billionaires:</p><ol><li>The business interests of many billionaires face total decimation at the hand of climate-induced conflict and destabilisation.</li><li>Many billionaires attribute their success to being hyper-logical, no-BS, getting shit done, and acting upon contrarian beliefs (sometimes this is even correct). The appeal of SRM to this mindset needs no explanation 🤠</li><li>Some billionaires want to use their money for good.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article data-layout="tutorial"><a id="introduction"><h2>Introduction</h2></a><p>For a long time, centering an element within its parent was a surprisingly tricky thing to do. As CSS has evolved, we've been granted more and more tools we can use to solve this problem. These days, we're spoiled for choice!</p><p>I decided to create this tutorial to help you understand the trade-offs between different approaches, and to give you an arsenal of strategies you can use, to handle centering in all sorts of scenarios.</p><p>Honestly, this turned out to be <em>way more interesting</em> than I initially thought<!-- -->&nbsp;<!-- -->😅. Even if you've been using CSS for a while, I bet you'll learn at least 1 new strategy!</p><div id="centering-with-auto-margins"><h2><a name="centering-with-auto-margins-1" id="centering-with-auto-margins-1" href="#centering-with-auto-margins-1"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg><p>Link to this heading</p></a>Centering with auto margins</h2></div><p>The first strategy we'll look at is one of the oldest. If we want to center an element horizontally, we can do so using margins set to the special value <code>auto</code>:</p><!--$?--><template id="B:0"></template><!--/$--><p>First, we need to constrain the element's width; by default, elements in Flow layout will expand horizontally to fill the available space, and we can't really center something that is full-width.</p><p>I <em>could</em> constrain the width with a fixed value (eg. <code>200px</code>), but really what I want in this case is for the element to shrinkwrap around its content. <code>fit-content</code> is a magical value that does exactly this. Essentially, it makes “width” behave like “height”, so that the element’s size is determined by its contents.</p><p><strong>Why am I setting <code>max-width</code> instead of <code>width</code>?</strong> Well, my goal is to stop the element from expanding horizontally. I want to clamp its maximum size. If I used <code>width</code> instead, it would lock it to that size, and the element would overflow when the container is really narrow. If you drag that “Container Width” slider all the way to the left, you can see that the element shrinks with its container.</p><p>Now that our element is constrained, we can center it with <em>auto margins</em>.</p><p>I like to think of auto margins like <em>Hungry Hungry Hippos</em>. Each auto margin will try to gobble up as much space as possible. For example, check out what happens if we <em>only</em> set <code>margin-left: auto</code>:</p><!--$?--><template id="B:1"></template><!--/$--><p>When <code>margin-left</code> is the only side with auto margins, <em>all</em> of the extra space gets applied as margin to that side. When we set both <code>margin-left: auto</code> <em>and</em> <code>margin-right: auto</code>, the two hippos each gobble up an equal amount of space. This forces the element to the center.</p><p><em>Also:</em> I've been using <code>margin-left</code> and <code>margin-right</code> because they're familiar, but there's a better, more-modern way to do this:</p><!--$?--><template id="B:2"></template><!--/$--><p><code>margin-inline</code> will set both <code>margin-left</code> and <code>margin-right</code> to the same value (<code>auto</code>). It has <a href="https://caniuse.com/mdn-css_properties_margin-inline" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">very good browser support</a>, having landed in all major browsers several years ago.</p><p>Even though this centering method has been around forever, I still find myself reaching for it on a regular basis! It's particularly useful when we want to center a single child, without affecting any of its siblings (for example, an image in-between paragraphs in a blog post).</p><p>Let's continue on our centering journey.</p><div id="centering-with-flexbox"><h2><a name="centering-with-flexbox-2" id="centering-with-flexbox-2" href="#centering-with-flexbox-2"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg><p>Link to this heading</p></a>Centering with Flexbox</h2></div><p>Flexbox is designed to give us a <em>ton</em> of control when it comes to distributing a group of items along a primary axis. It offers some <em>really</em> powerful tools for centering!</p><p>Let's start by centering a single element, both horizontally and vertically:</p><!--$?--><template id="B:3"></template><!--/$--><p>The really cool thing about Flexbox centering is that it works <em>even when the children don’t fit in their container!</em> Try shrinking the width/height, and notice that the element overflows symmetrically.</p><p>It also works for <em>multiple</em> children.

But what if we want to center an element in a different context? Certain elements like dialogs, prompts, and GDPR banners need to be centered within the viewport.</p><p>This is the domain of <em>positioned layout,</em> a layout mode used when we want to take something out of flow and anchor it to something else.</p><p>Here's what this looks like:</p><!--$?--><template id="B:5"></template><!--/$--><p>Of all the strategies we'll discuss, this one is probably the most complex. Let's break it down.</p><p>We're using <code>position: fixed</code>, which anchors this element to the viewport. I like to think of the viewport like a pane of glass that sits in front of the website, like the window of a train that shows the landscape scrolling by. An element with <code>position: fixed</code> is like a ladybug that lands on the window.</p><p>Next, we're setting <code>inset: 0px</code>, which is a shorthand that sets <code>top</code>, <code>left</code>, <code>right</code>, and <code>bottom</code> all to the same value, <code>0px</code>.</p><p>With only these two properties, the element would stretch to fill the entire viewport, growing so that it's 0px from each edge. This can be useful in some contexts, but it's not what we're going for here. We need to constrain it.</p><p>The exact values we pick will vary on the specifics of each situation, but in general we want to set default values (with <code>width</code> and <code>height</code>), as well as max values (<code>max-width</code> and <code>max-height</code>), so that the element doesn't overflow on smaller viewports.</p><p><strong>There's something interesting here:</strong> we've set up an impossible condition. Our element can't be 0px from the left <em>and</em> 0px from the right <em>and</em> only 12rem wide (assuming the viewport is wider than 12rem). We can only pick 2:</p><!--$?--><template id="B:6"></template><!--/$--><p><strong>The CSS rendering engine resolves this tension by prioritizing.</strong> It will listen to the <code>width</code> constraint, since that seems important. And if it can't anchor to the left <em>and</em> the right, it'll pick an option based on the page's language; so, in a left-to-right language like English, it'll sit along the left edge.</p><p><em>But!</em> When we bring our old friend <code>margin: auto</code> into the equation, something interesting happens. It changes how the browser resolves the impossible condition; instead of anchoring to the left edge, <em>it centers it</em>.</p><p>And, unlike auto margins in <em>Flow</em> layout, we can use this trick to center an element both horizontally <em>and</em> vertically.</p><!--$?--><template id="B:7"></template><!--/$--><p>It's a lot to remember, but there are 4 key ingredients for this trick.</p><ol><li><p>Fixed positioning</p></li><li><p>Anchoring to all 4 edges with <code>inset: 0px</code></p></li><li><p>Constrained width and height</p></li><li><p>Auto margins</p></li></ol><p>We can use the same trick to center something in a single direction. For example, we can build a GDPR cookie banner that is horizontally centered, but anchored near the bottom of the viewport:</p><!--$?--><template id="B:8"></template><!--/$--><p>By omitting <code>top: 0px</code>, we remove the impossible condition in the vertical direction, and our banner is anchored to the bottom edge. As a nice touch, I used the <code>calc</code> function to clamp the max width, so that there's always a bit of buffer around the element.</p><p>I also swapped <code>margin: auto</code> for <code>margin-inline: auto</code>, which isn't strictly necessary, but feels more precise.</p><div id="centering-elements-with-unknown-sizes"><h3><a name="centering-elements-with-unknown-sizes-4" id="centering-elements-with-unknown-sizes-4" href="#centering-elements-with-unknown-sizes-4"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg><p>Link to this heading</p></a>Centering elements with unknown sizes</h3></div><p>This “fixed position” strategy requires that we give the element a fixed <code>width</code> and <code>height</code>; otherwise, the element will stretch to fill the entire viewport!</p><p>Sometimes, though, we don't want to give the element a fixed size. We want it to be sized based on its contents.</p><p>We can solve this problem using a clever trick with transforms:</p><!--$?--><template id="B:9"></template><!--/$--><p>This works because <code>top</code> and <code>left</code> percentages are based on the <em>viewport’s</em> size, while <code>transform</code> is based on the <em>element’s</em> size. You can think of this as a two-step process:</p><ol><li><p>Using <code>top</code> and <code>left</code>, position the modal so that its top-left corner is right in the center of the viewport.</p></li><li><p>Using <code>transform</code>, slide the element up and back by half of its <em>own</em> size.</p></li></ol><p>Honestly, this isn't my favourite approach. It feels like a hack, and there are some unintuitive consequences; for example, the element can't grow beyond 50% of the viewport’s size. As a result, I don't find myself reaching for this approach super often.</p><div id="centering-with-css-grid"><h2><a name="centering-with-css-grid-5" id="centering-with-css-grid-5" href="#centering-with-css-grid-5"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg><p>Link to this heading</p></a>Centering with CSS Grid</h2></div><p>The most terse way I know to center something both horizontally and vertically is with CSS Grid:</p><!--$?--><template id="B:a"></template><!--/$--><p>The <code>place-content</code> property is a shorthand for both <code>justify-content</code> and <code>align-content</code>, applying the same value to both rows and columns.

Until now.</p><p>As I write this in early 2024, browser vendors are in the process of implementing <code>align-content</code> in Flow layout, so that it controls the “block” direction alignment of content. It's still early days; this new behaviour is only available in Chrome Canary (<a href="chrome://flags/#enable-experimental-web-platform-features">behind a flag</a>) and Safari Technical Preview.</p><p>(I should note, the demo above is fake. I got a feel for the new <code>align-content</code> support in Chrome Canari and Safari TP, and then recreated the exact same behaviour using Flexbox. Sorry for the deception!)</p><div id="going-beyond-the-patterns"><h2><a name="going-beyond-the-patterns-10" id="going-beyond-the-patterns-10" href="#going-beyond-the-patterns-10"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg><p>Link to this heading</p></a>Going beyond the patterns</h2></div><p>So, for many years, I treated CSS like a collection of patterns. I had a bunch of memorized snippets that would paste from my brain, to solve whatever problem I was currently facing.</p><p>This worked alright, but it did feel pretty limiting. And every now and then, things would inexplicably break; a snippet I’d used hundreds of times would suddenly behave differently.</p><p>When I took the time to learn CSS at a deeper level, my experience with the language completely changed. So many things clicked into place. Instead of relying on memorized snippets, I could instead rely on my intuition! ✨</p><p>In this tutorial, we’ve explored a handful of useful centering patterns, and I hope they’ll come in handy the next time you need to center something. Truthfully, though, we've only scratched the surface here; there are <em>so many ways</em> we can use modern CSS to center stuff! Instead of memorizing even more snippets, I think it's better to build a robust mental model of how CSS works, so that we can come up with solutions on-the-fly!</p><p>I spent 2 years of my life creating the ultimate resource for developing a deep understanding of CSS. It's called <a href="https://css-for-js.dev/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><strong>CSS for JavaScript Developers</strong></a>.</p><p>If you found this tutorial helpful, you’ll get <em>so much</em> out of my course. We take a similar approach to the entire CSS language, building an intuition for how all of the different layout algorithms work.</p><p>It includes interactive text content like this blog post, but also videos, exercises, real-world-inspired workshops, and even a few minigames.

ChatGPT’s memory will get better the more you use it and you'll start to notice the improvements over time. For example:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>You’ve explained that you prefer meeting notes to have headlines, bullets and action items summarized at the bottom. ChatGPT remembers this and recaps meetings this way.</li><li>You’ve told ChatGPT you own a neighborhood coffee shop. When brainstorming messaging for a social post celebrating a new location, ChatGPT knows where to start.&nbsp;</li><li>You mention that you have a toddler and that she loves jellyfish. When you ask ChatGPT to help create her birthday card, it suggests a jellyfish wearing a party hat.&nbsp;</li><li>As a kindergarten teacher with 25 students, you prefer 50-minute lessons with follow-up activities. ChatGPT remembers this when helping you create lesson plans.<br></li></ul></div><!--]--><!--[--><div id="you-re-in-control" data-heading=""><p><h2>You’re in control</h2></p></div><!--]--><!--[--><div><p>You can turn off memory at any time (Settings &gt; Personalization &gt; Memory).

You can also view and delete specific memories or clear all memories in settings (Settings &gt; Personalization &gt; Manage Memory). ChatGPT's memories evolve with your interactions and aren't linked to specific conversations. Deleting a chat doesn't erase its memories; you must delete the memory itself.

It can learn your style and preferences, and build upon past interactions. This saves you time and leads to more relevant and insightful responses. For example:</p><ul><li>ChatGPT can remember your tone, voice, and format preferences, and automatically apply them to blog post drafts without needing repetition.</li><li>When coding, you tell ChatGPT your programming language and frameworks. It can remember these preferences for subsequent tasks, streamlining the process.</li><li>For monthly business reviews, you securely upload your data to ChatGPT and it creates your preferred charts with three takeaways each.</li></ul><p>As with any ChatGPT feature, you’re in control of your organization’s data. Memories and any other information on your workspace are excluded from training our models. Users have control on how and when their memories are used in chats. In addition, Enterprise account owners can turn memory off for their organization at any time.</p><p>Enterprise and Team users will have access to memory as part of our wider rollout.<br></p></div><!--]--><!--[--><div id="gpts-will-also-have-memory" data-heading=""><p><h2>GPTs will also have memory</h2></p></div><!--]--><!--[--><div><p>GPTs will have their own distinct memory. Builders will have the option to enable memory for their GPTs. Like your chats, memories are not shared with builders. To interact with a memory-enabled GPT, you will also need to have memory on. For example:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>The <a href="https://chat.openai.com/g/g-z77yDe7Vu-books" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Books GPT</a> helps you find your next read. With memory enabled, it remembers your preferences, such as favorite genres or top books, and tailors recommendations accordingly, without needing repeated inputs.</li></ul><p>Each GPT has its own memory, so you might need to repeat details you’ve previously shared with ChatGPT. For example:</p><ul><li>If you're using the <a href="https://chat.openai.com/g/g-SnF78wo4p-artful-greeting-ai-cards" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Artful Greeting Card GPT</a> to create a birthday card for your daughter, it won’t know her age or that she loves jellyfish. You’ll need to tell it the relevant details.</li></ul><p>Memory for GPTs will be available when we roll it out more broadly.<br></p></div><!--]--><!--]--></div></div>]]></description>

Minnesota doesn’t generally have a reputation as a hotbed for technology, so readers shouldn’t be surprised to hear that reports of Wi-Fi jammers used to assist burglaries in the U.S. go back several years.

The modus operandi of the thief or thieves is thought to be something like this:</p><ul><li>Homes in affluent areas are found</li><li>Burglars carefully watch the homes</li><li>The burglars avoid confrontation, so appear to wait until homes are empty</li><li>Seizing the opportunity of an empty home, the burglars will deploy Wi-Fi jammer(s)</li><li>“Safes, jewelry, and other high-end designer items,” are usually taken</li></ul><p>A <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tag/security" data-auto-tag-linker="true" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomshardware.com/tag/security">security</a> expert interviewed by the source publication, KARE11, explained that the jammers simply confused wireless devices rather than blocking signals.

A Ring community post about one of the firm’s wireless doorbells <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://community.ring.com/t/porch-thief-disabled-video-doorbell/2742" data-url="https://community.ring.com/t/porch-thief-disabled-video-doorbell/2742">missing a porch thief</a> after being subjected to a Wi-Fi deauthentication attack was posted back in January 2020. It is also easy to find reports of burglars using Wi-Fi jamming technology over 2021, 2022, and 2023 – with reports becoming more frequent over time. &nbsp;</p><p>We mention Ring as one of the firms that popularized video doorbells to solve multiple home security concerns, but other wireless <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tag/smart-home" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomshardware.com/tag/smart-home">smart home</a> security products from Blink (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tag/amazon" data-auto-tag-linker="true" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomshardware.com/tag/amazon">Amazon</a>) and Nest (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tag/google" data-auto-tag-linker="true" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomshardware.com/tag/google">Google</a>) will also be vulnerable to wireless signal jamming.</p><p>Worryingly, Wi-Fi jamming is almost a trivial activity for potential thieves in 2024. KARE11 notes that it could buy jammers online very easily and cheaply, with prices ranging from $40 to $1,000. Jammers are not legal to use in the U.S. but they are very easy to buy online.</p><figure data-bordeaux-image-check=""><div><p><picture><source type="image/webp" alt="eBay wireless jammer listings" onerror="if(this.src &amp;&amp; this.src.indexOf('missing-image.svg') !== -1){return true;};this.parentNode.replaceChild(window.missingImage(),this)" data-normal="https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/tomshardware/media/img/missing-image.svg" data-srcset="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WWFfFMpCoMMNK4DqU6F8Ui-320-80.jpg.webp 320w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WWFfFMpCoMMNK4DqU6F8Ui-480-80.jpg.webp 480w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WWFfFMpCoMMNK4DqU6F8Ui-650-80.jpg.webp 650w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WWFfFMpCoMMNK4DqU6F8Ui-970-80.jpg.webp 970w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WWFfFMpCoMMNK4DqU6F8Ui-1024-80.jpg.webp 1024w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WWFfFMpCoMMNK4DqU6F8Ui-1200-80.jpg.webp 1200w" data-sizes="(min-width: 1000px) 970px, calc(100vw - 40px)" data-original-mos="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WWFfFMpCoMMNK4DqU6F8Ui.jpg" data-pin-media="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WWFfFMpCoMMNK4DqU6F8Ui.jpg"><source type="image/jpeg" alt="eBay wireless jammer listings" onerror="if(this.src &amp;&amp; this.src.indexOf('missing-image.svg') !== -1){return true;};this.parentNode.replaceChild(window.missingImage(),this)" data-normal="https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/tomshardware/media/img/missing-image.svg" data-srcset="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WWFfFMpCoMMNK4DqU6F8Ui-320-80.jpg 320w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WWFfFMpCoMMNK4DqU6F8Ui-480-80.jpg 480w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WWFfFMpCoMMNK4DqU6F8Ui-650-80.jpg 650w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WWFfFMpCoMMNK4DqU6F8Ui-970-80.jpg 970w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WWFfFMpCoMMNK4DqU6F8Ui-1024-80.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WWFfFMpCoMMNK4DqU6F8Ui-1200-80.jpg 1200w" data-sizes="(min-width: 1000px) 970px, calc(100vw - 40px)" data-original-mos="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WWFfFMpCoMMNK4DqU6F8Ui.jpg" data-pin-media="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WWFfFMpCoMMNK4DqU6F8Ui.jpg"><img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WWFfFMpCoMMNK4DqU6F8Ui.jpg" alt="eBay wireless jammer listings" onerror="if(this.src &amp;&amp; this.src.indexOf('missing-image.svg') !== -1){return true;};this.parentNode.replaceChild(window.missingImage(),this)" data-normal="https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/tomshardware/media/img/missing-image.svg" data-srcset="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WWFfFMpCoMMNK4DqU6F8Ui-320-80.jpg 320w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WWFfFMpCoMMNK4DqU6F8Ui-480-80.jpg 480w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WWFfFMpCoMMNK4DqU6F8Ui-650-80.jpg 650w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WWFfFMpCoMMNK4DqU6F8Ui-970-80.jpg 970w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WWFfFMpCoMMNK4DqU6F8Ui-1024-80.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WWFfFMpCoMMNK4DqU6F8Ui-1200-80.jpg 1200w" data-sizes="(min-width: 1000px) 970px, calc(100vw - 40px)" data-original-mos="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WWFfFMpCoMMNK4DqU6F8Ui.jpg" data-pin-media="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WWFfFMpCoMMNK4DqU6F8Ui.jpg" srcset="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WWFfFMpCoMMNK4DqU6F8Ui-320-80.jpg 320w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WWFfFMpCoMMNK4DqU6F8Ui-480-80.jpg 480w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WWFfFMpCoMMNK4DqU6F8Ui-650-80.jpg 650w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WWFfFMpCoMMNK4DqU6F8Ui-970-80.jpg 970w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WWFfFMpCoMMNK4DqU6F8Ui-1024-80.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WWFfFMpCoMMNK4DqU6F8Ui-1200-80.jpg 1200w"></picture></p></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description"><span itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: eBay wireless jammer listings)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Before we go, there are a few suggestions given to those now wondering about the efficacy of their home security systems with wireless components.

   <p>For most of her life, Joy Milne had a superpower that she was totally oblivious to. She simply had no idea she possessed an utterly amazing, slightly terrifying biological gift that scientists would itch to study.</p>   <p>In fact, Joy probably would have stayed oblivious if it hadn't been for her husband, Les Milne.</p>

   <p>The two met in high school. Les was a 17-year-old swimmer and Joy was 16, a new transfer. She remembers dancing with him at a party and being struck by his wonderful smell. "He had a lovely male musk smell. He really did," she recalls.</p>   <p>Everything about Les appealed to Joy. He was very thoughtful and generally quiet but had a wicked sense of humor.</p>   <p>After college, they got married and set off on happily-ever-after. Les became a doctor, Joy became a nurse, and they had three boys. Joy says that as a couple they were so easy together — they rarely fought: "We disagreed about things now and again, but we didn't fight, fight."</p>   
   <p>Life with "her Les," as she calls him, was everything Joy had hoped</p>   <p>But then one day, about 10 years into the marriage, when Les was 31, he came home, and strangely, Joy says, he smelled different. "His lovely male musk smell had got this overpowering sort of nasty yeast smell," she says.</p>   <p>At first Joy thought it must be something from the hospital where he worked and told him to shower, but that didn't help, and over the weeks and months that followed the smell just seemed to grow stronger.</p>   <p>So Joy started nagging: "[I] kept saying to him ... 'Look, you know, you're not washing enough.' "</p>   <p>But the smell wouldn't yield, and eventually Les got mad whenever Joy told him to shower. He couldn't smell it, he grumbled, and neither could anyone else. "He just would stomp off in a huff and say, 'Oh, stop going on about that!' I had to just let it go and put up with it," she recalls.</p>   <p>Unfortunately, as the years peeled on, Joy began to feel that it wasn't just her husband's smell that was changing.</p>   <p>"It was his personality, his character. He began to change. He was more moody. He wasn't as tolerant," she says.</p>   
   <p>They fought more and more. So many of the qualities Joy valued in her husband — his thoughtfulness, his patience, his quiet dignity — began to bleed away until eventually, by his early 40s, she began to see Les as a totally different person.</p>   <p>And then one night Joy woke up to her husband attacking her.</p>   <p>"He was sort of screaming and shaking me and you know, but he was totally oblivious of it," she says.</p>   <p>Les was clearly having a nightmare, but after the attack Joy put her foot down. She was worried Les had a brain tumor — they needed to seek medical attention. She remembers sitting next to Les in a sterile office as the doctor delivered his diagnosis: Her 45-year-old husband had Parkinson's disease.</p>   <p><strong>The discovery: an unusual sense of smell</strong></p>   <p>Joy says that over the next 20 years she and Les tried to make the best of things, but it was difficult: the loss of movement, the loss of work, the slow narrowing of their world. Still, they struggled through. Then about seven years ago, they decided to attend a support group for people suffering from Parkinson's.</p>   <p>"We were late. ... A lot of people were there. And I walked into the room and I thought, 'SMELL!' " she says.</p>   <p>Joy realized that the other people in the room had the same greasy, musty smell that Les had — the smell that Joy had first noticed when Les was just 31. "And then I realized for some people it smelled stronger and for other people it didn't smell so strong," she says.</p>   <p>Could it be, Joy wondered, that Parkinson's has a smell?</p>   <p>As they drove home from the meeting, Joy kept puzzling it over in her head, and by the time they arrived, she'd decided she would tell her husband.</p>   <p>She says once she made her discovery clear, his eyes widened: "He's a doctor — we both understood the significance. Immediately."</p>   
   <p>To begin, this was a new scientific discovery, but also, Joy had smelled the disease on Les more than a decade before his symptoms got severe enough for them to seek medical help. If Joy could predict Parkinson's before its well-known symptoms, such as shaking and sleep disruption, even started to appear, maybe she could work with researchers. It might lead to a breakthrough.</p>   <p>Joy and Les knew instantly they had to get this information to the right scientist. So they went to see a Parkinson's researcher at the University of Edinburgh named <a href="http://www.crm.ed.ac.uk/people/tilo-kunath">Tilo Kunath</a>. But initially, he says, he wasn't interested.</p>   <p>"I just dismissed it, I have to say. It just didn't seem possible," he says. "Why should Parkinson's have an odor? You wouldn't normally think neurodegenerative conditions such as Parkinson's, or Alzheimer's, would have an odor."</p>   <p>But then several months later, Kunath heard about <a href="https://www.fasebj.org/doi/abs/10.1096/fasebj.2019.33.1_supplement.635.10">research that showed dogs could smell cancer</a> — which of course made him think back to Joy. So he tracked her down and asked her to come to his lab for a special test he devised himself.</p>   <p><strong>The experiment</strong></p>   <p>Kunath asked one group of people who had Parkinson's and another group of people who didn't have Parkinson's to take home white T-shirts, wear them overnight and then return them.</p>   <p>Then Kunath gave the T-shirts to Joy to smell. "They were all given randomized numbers and put in a box, and then she was asked to take each one out and give it a score," he says.</p>   <p>Was the person who wore this shirt at an early stage of Parkinson's? In a late stage of Parkinson's? Something in between? Or maybe the person didn't have the disease at all.</p>   <p>"And she was incredibly accurate," Kunath says.</p>   <p>In fact, out of all the samples, Joy made only one mistake. She identified a man in the control group, the group without Parkinson's, as having the disease. But many months later, Kunath says, that man actually approached him at an event and said, "Tilo, you're going to have to put me in the Parkinson's pile because I've just been diagnosed."</p>   
   <p>It was incontrovertible: Joy not only could  smell Parkinson's but could smell it even in the absence of its typical medical presentation.</p>   <p>Kunath and fellow scientists published their work in <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acscentsci.8b00879">ACS Central Science</a> in March 2019, listing Joy as a co-author. Their research identified certain specific compounds that may contribute to the smell that Joy noticed on her husband and other Parkinson's patients.</p>   <div id="res820641409">

   <p><strong>Working toward a diagnostic</strong></p>   <p>Joy and her super smelling abilities have opened up a whole new realm of research, Kunath says. Researchers, including <a href="https://www.research.manchester.ac.uk/portal/perdita.barran.html">Perdita Barran</a> at the University of Manchester, led a second, larger study and have recently <a href="https://chemrxiv.org/articles/Sebum_A_Window_into_Dysregulation_of_Mitochondrial_Metabolism_in_Parkinson_s_Disease/11603613">found 10 compounds</a> linked to Parkinson's by using mass spectrometry and other techniques to analyze samples from 274 people. They're hoping to find a way to diagnose Parkinson's from skin-based biomarkers, according to Barran. More work is soon to come, she adds.</p>   <p>That's the ultimate goal, Kunath says: to develop a new tool to detect Parkinson's early. "We really want to know what is behind this and what are the molecules. And then can the molecules be used as some sort of diagnostic test?"</p>   <p>Parkinson's begins slowly, taking years or maybe even decades before symptoms such as tremors appear, Kunath says. "Imagine a society where you could detect such a devastating condition before it's causing problems and then prevent the problems from even occurring," he adds. Combined with potential therapies to prevent or mitigate Parkinson's, a molecular test that identified Parkinson's would be a powerful tool.</p>   <p>There's some evidence — and history — around the idea of scent signaling the presence of a disease, says <a href="https://www.med.upenn.edu/smellandtastecenter/personnel.html">Richard Doty</a>, the director of the Smell and Taste Center at the University of Pennsylvania's Perelman School of Medicine. "It used to be that physicians did use breath odor and other odors to signify certain disorders. But that's not really invoked presently, because we have so much better ways of [diagnosing] things." He also says that smell is an imperfect biomarker because confounding factors could influence people's odors, such as diet and age.</p>   
   <p>"This idea of an olfactory biomarker [for a disease] is fascinating," said <a href="https://www.uniklinikum-dresden.de/de/das-klinikum/kliniken-polikliniken-institute/hno/klinik/oberarzte-abteilungsleiter/prof-dr-med-thomas-hummel">Dr. Thomas Hummel</a> of the Technical University of Dresden's Smell &amp; Taste Clinic, via email. But there remain "numerous open questions."</p>   <p>Joy's smell test for Parkinson's is "interesting but not definitive," Doty adds. More studies would lend it more certainty, and he says, "I think it's still up in the air."</p>   <p>But Joy's superpower is so unusual that researchers all over the world have started working with her and have discovered that she can identify several kinds of illnesses — tuberculosis, Alzheimer's disease, cancer and diabetes.</p>   <p><strong>Sharing their story — for science</strong></p>   <p>As for her life with Les, Joy says, once it became clear that she might hold in her nose a tool that could move research on Parkinson's forward, Les had a eureka moment: They had more knowledge to offer science. Joy had smelled his Parkinson's more than a decade before diagnosis, so maybe, Les told Joy, if they thought very carefully about their life together before the official diagnosis, they'd be able to pinpoint <em>early symptoms</em> that hadn't yet been identified by science.</p>   <p>"We had to write down everything that had happened, so that medicine would understand what was happening to people with Parkinson's," Joy says.</p>   <p>So for the last six weeks of his life, Les and Joy sat for daily writing sessions. "They would only last 35 to 40 minutes at a time, but the last six weeks were completely different," she recalls. "We spent time each day discussing what happened to us over the last 20-odd years."</p>   <p>Joy says Les had always shied away from talking about his Parkinson's. It seemed like it was so existentially threatening to him — this terrible dread <em>DISEASE</em> — that he just had to shove it away and couldn't acknowledge it. But he was freed by their discussions.</p>   
   <p>In fact, Joy says the research she's doing with her nose was the last thing they ever spoke about. "He said, 'You won't let this go — you will do it, won't you? You promise?' " she recalls. Just a few hours later, he died. But Joy has stayed true. "I've done it. I've kept my promise. So it should make an awful lot of difference."</p>

<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">🤔 Why BoCoEL?</h2>
<p dir="auto">Large language models are expensive and slow behemoths, and evaluating them on gigantic modern datasets only makes it worse.</p>
<p dir="auto">If only there is a way to just select a meaningful (<em>and small</em>) subset of the corpus and obtain a highly accurate evaluation.....</p>
<p dir="auto">Wait, sounds like <a href="#bo">Bayesian Optmization</a>!</p>
<p dir="auto">Bocoel works in the following steps:</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>Encode individual entry into embeddings (way cheaper / faster than LLM and reusable).</li>
<li>Use Bayesian optimization to select queries to evaluate.</li>
<li>Use the queries to retrieve from our corpus (with the encoded embeddings).</li>
<li>Profit.</li>
</ol>
<p dir="auto">The evaluations generated are easily managed by the provided manager utility.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">🚀 Features</h2>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>🎯 Accurately evaluate large language models with just tens of samples from your selected corpus.</li>
<li>💂‍♂️ Uses the power of Bayesian optimization to select an optimal set of samples for language model to evaluate.</li>
<li>💯 Evalutes the corpus on the model in addition to evaluating the model on corpus.</li>
<li>🤗 Support for <code>GPT2</code>, <code>Pythia</code>, <code>LLAMA</code> and more through integration with huggingface <a href="https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/index" rel="nofollow">transformers</a> and <a href="https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/en/index" rel="nofollow">datasets</a></li>
<li>🧩 Modular design.</li>
<li>🔎 Efficient representation of the corpus / dataset such as N-sphere representation or whitening of the latent space to agument evaluation quality.</li>
</ul>

<p dir="auto">Simply put, Bayesian optimization aims to optimize either the exploration objective (the purple area in the image) or the exploitation object (the height of the black dots). It uses Gaussian processes as a backbone for inference, and uses an <strong>acquisition function</strong> to decide where to sample next. See <a href="https://distill.pub/2019/visual-exploration-gaussian-processes/" rel="nofollow">here</a> for an a more in-depth introduction.</p>
<p dir="auto">Since <em>Bayesian optimization works well with expensive-to-evaluate black-box model (paraphrase: LLM)</em>, it is perfect for this particular use case. Bocoel uses Bayesian optimization as a backbone for exploring the embedding space given by our corpus, which allows it to select a good subset acting as a mini snapshot of the corpus.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">🏎️ Performance Implications</h2>
<p dir="auto">LLMs are painfully slow, especially generative ones (which is what is usually referred to as LLM), since sequence generation is sequential by nature.</p>
<p dir="auto">Despite <code>bocoel</code>'s requirement to use an embedder to encode the entire corpus, embedders are faster than LLMs by orders of magnitude and the time is gained back by practically any savings in evaluating LLMs.</p>

From years [decades] of coaching skilled journeyman programmers, I have observed the absence of those patterns. I have seen what a difference introducing the patterns can make.</p><p>Here are ways effective programmers get the most out of their precious 3e9 seconds on the planet.</p><p>The theme here is scaling your brain. The journeyman learns to solve bigger problems by solving more problems at once. The master learns to solve even bigger problems than that by solving fewer problems at once. Part of the wisdom is subdividing so that integrating the separate solutions will be a smaller problem than just solving them together.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Slicing</strong><span>. Take a big project, cut it into thin slices, and rearrange the slices to suit your context. I can always slice projects finer and I can always find new permutations of the slices that meet different needs.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>One thing at a time</strong><span>. We’re so focused on efficiency that we reduce the number of feedback cycles in an attempt to reduce overhead. This leads to difficult debugging situations whose expected cost is greater than the cycle overhead we avoided.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Make it run, make it right, make it fast</strong><span>. (Example of One Thing at a Time, Slicing, and Easy Changes)</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Easy changes</strong><span>. When faced with a hard change, first make it easy (warning, this may be hard), then make the easy change. (e.g. slicing, one thing at a time, concentration, isolation). Example of slicing.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Concentration</strong><span>. If you need to change several elements, first rearrange the code so the change only needs to happen in one element.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Isolation</strong><span>. If you only need to change a part of an element, extract that part so the whole subelement changes.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Baseline Measurement</strong><span>. Start projects by measuring the current state of the world. This goes against our engineering instincts to start fixing things, but when you measure the baseline you will actually know whether you are fixing things.</span></p></li></ul><ul><li><p><strong>Call your shot</strong><span>. Before you run code, predict out loud exactly what will happen.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Concrete hypotheses</strong><span>. When the program is misbehaving, articulate exactly what you think is wrong before making a change. If you have two or more hypotheses, find a differential diagnosis.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Remove extraneous detail</strong><span>. When reporting a bug, find the shortest repro steps. When isolating a bug, find the shortest test case. When using a new API, start from the most basic example. “All that stuff can’t possibly matter,” is an expensive assumption when it’s wrong.</span></p><ul><li><p>E.g. see a bug on mobile, reproduce it with curl</p></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Multiple scales</strong><span>. Move between scales freely. Maybe this is a design problem, not a testing problem. Maybe it is a people problem, not a technology problem [cheating, this is always true].</span></p></li></ul><ul><li><p><strong>Symmetry</strong><span>. Things that are almost the same can be divided into parts that are identical and parts that are clearly different.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Aesthetics</strong><span>. Beauty is a powerful gradient to climb. It is also a liberating gradient to flout (e.g. inlining a bunch of functions into one giant mess).</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Rhythm</strong><span>. Waiting until the right moment preserves energy and avoids clutter. Act with intensity when the time comes to act.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Tradeoffs</strong><span>. All decisions are subject to tradeoffs. It’s more important to know what the decision depends on than it is to know which answer to pick today (or which answer you picked yesterday).</span></p></li></ul><ul><li><p><strong>Fun list</strong><span>. When tangential ideas come, note them and get back to work quickly. Revisit this list when you’ve reached a stopping spot.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Feed Ideas</strong><span>. Ideas are like frightened little birds. If you scare them away they will stop coming around. When you have an idea, feed it a little. Invalidate it as quickly as you can, but from data not from a lack of self-esteem.</span></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/notes/kent-beck/fresh-work-80155/1186004658099063" rel="">80/15/5</a><span>. Spend 80% of your time on low-risk/reasonable-payoff work. Spend 15% of your time on related high-risk/high-payoff work. Spend 5% of your time on things that tickle you, regardless of payoff. Teach the next generation to do your 80% job. By the time someone is ready to take over, one of your 15% experiments (or, less frequently, one of your 5% experiments) will have paid off and will become your new 80%. Repeat.</span></p></li></ul><p>The flow in this outline seems to be from reducing risks by managing time and increasing learning to mindfully taking risks by using your whole brain and quickly triaging ideas.</p></div></article></div></div>]]></description>

<p>Apple and Microsoft said they welcomed the decision to not designate them as core platform services in separate statements following the announcement. </p>
<p>The EU has been working on legislation under the DMA that would have required Apple to make changes to iMessage to make it available on other platforms. The interoperability rules would have meant that Meta apps like WhatsApp or Messenger could request to interoperate with Apple's iMessage framework, and Apple would have been forced to comply within the EU. </p>
<p>However, the EU probe found that iMessage falls outside the legislation because it is not widely used by businesses. The reprieve for Apple is part of a five-month market investigation by the European Commission. </p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nvidia is releasing an early version of <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?xs=1&amp;id=1025X1701640&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nvidia.com%2Fen-us%2Fai-on-rtx%2Fchat-with-rtx-generative-ai%2F">Chat with RTX</a> today, a demo app that lets you run a personal AI chatbot on your PC. You can feed it YouTube videos and your own documents to create summaries and get relevant answers based on your own data. It all runs locally on a PC, and all you need is an RTX 30- or 40-series GPU with at least 8GB of VRAM.</p><p>I’ve been briefly testing out Chat with RTX over the past day, and although the app is a little rough around the edges, I can already see this being a valuable part of data research for journalists or anyone who needs to analyze a collection of documents.</p><p>Chat with RTX can handle YouTube videos, so you simply input a URL, and it lets you search transcripts for specific mentions or summarize an entire video. I found this ideal for searching through video podcasts, particularly for finding specific mentions in podcasts over the past week amid rumors of Microsoft’s new <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/12/24067370/microsoft-xbox-playstation-switch-games-future-hardware">Xbox strategy shift</a>.</p><p>It wasn’t perfect for searching YouTube videos, though. I tried to search through the transcript of a <em>Verge</em> YouTube video, and Chat with RTX downloaded the transcript for a completely different video. It wasn’t even one that I had queried before, so there are clearly bugs in this early demo.</p><div><div role="button" aria-label="Zoom" tabindex="0"><figure><div><p><span><img alt="Chat with RTX is great at searching your local documents." loading="lazy" decoding="async" data-nimg="fill" sizes="(max-width: 1023px) 100vw, 744px" srcset="https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2560x1229/376x181/filters:focal(1280x615:1281x616):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25283482/BQXE3at.png 376w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2560x1229/384x184/filters:focal(1280x615:1281x616):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25283482/BQXE3at.png 384w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2560x1229/415x199/filters:focal(1280x615:1281x616):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25283482/BQXE3at.png 415w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2560x1229/480x230/filters:focal(1280x615:1281x616):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25283482/BQXE3at.png 480w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2560x1229/540x259/filters:focal(1280x615:1281x616):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25283482/BQXE3at.png 540w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2560x1229/640x307/filters:focal(1280x615:1281x616):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25283482/BQXE3at.png 640w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2560x1229/750x360/filters:focal(1280x615:1281x616):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25283482/BQXE3at.png 750w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2560x1229/828x398/filters:focal(1280x615:1281x616):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25283482/BQXE3at.png 828w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2560x1229/1080x518/filters:focal(1280x615:1281x616):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25283482/BQXE3at.png 1080w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2560x1229/1200x576/filters:focal(1280x615:1281x616):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25283482/BQXE3at.png 1200w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2560x1229/1440x691/filters:focal(1280x615:1281x616):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25283482/BQXE3at.png 1440w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2560x1229/1920x922/filters:focal(1280x615:1281x616):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25283482/BQXE3at.png 1920w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2560x1229/2048x983/filters:focal(1280x615:1281x616):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25283482/BQXE3at.png 2048w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2560x1229/2400x1152/filters:focal(1280x615:1281x616):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25283482/BQXE3at.png 2400w" src="https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2560x1229/2400x1152/filters:focal(1280x615:1281x616):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25283482/BQXE3at.png" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></span></p></div></figure></div><div><figcaption><em>Chat with RTX is great at searching your local documents.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Screenshot by Tom Warren / The Verge</cite></p></div></div><p>When it worked properly I was able to find references in videos within seconds. I also created a dataset of <em>FTC v. Microsoft</em> documents for Chat with RTX to analyze. When I was covering the court case last year, it was often overwhelming to search through documents at speed, but Chat with RTX helped me query them nearly instantly on my PC.</p><p>For example, the chatbot did a good job summarizing Microsoft’s entire Xbox Game Pass strategy from internal documents revealed at the trial:</p><div><blockquote><p>Based on the provided context information, Xbox Game Pass is a content subscription service in gaming that provides access to a library of games for a single monthly fee. It is envisioned as a platform that empowers players to play their games anywhere and allows publishers to reach players everywhere. The service is supported by Project xCloud and Xbox Series X, and it aims to create a fertile ground for publishers to monetize their games. The primary strategic objective for the Gaming CSA is to scale Xbox Game Pass, and it is believed that there is a significant subscriber opportunity globally, with a potential of 750 million subscribers. The service faces three primary content dynamics, including the need for differentiated content, expanding beyond console, and limited content supply.</p></blockquote></div><p>I’ve also found this useful to scan through PDFs and fact-check data. Microsoft’s own Copilot system doesn’t handle PDFs well within Word, but Nvidia’s Chat with RTX had no problem pulling out all the key information. The responses are near instant as well, with none of the lag you usually see when using cloud-based ChatGPT or Copilot chatbots.</p><p>The big drawback to Chat with RTX is that it <em>really </em>feels like an early developer demo. Chat with RTX essentially installs a web server and Python instance on your PC, which then leverages Mistral or Llama 2 models to query the data you feed it. It then utilizes Nvidia’s Tensor cores on an RTX GPU to speed up your queries.</p><div><div role="button" aria-label="Zoom" tabindex="0"><figure><div><p><span><img alt="Chat with RTX isn’t always accurate, though." loading="lazy" decoding="async" data-nimg="fill" sizes="(max-width: 1023px) 100vw, 744px" srcset="https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2560x1229/376x181/filters:focal(1280x615:1281x616):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25283483/5UYNJFi.png 376w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2560x1229/384x184/filters:focal(1280x615:1281x616):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25283483/5UYNJFi.png 384w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2560x1229/415x199/filters:focal(1280x615:1281x616):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25283483/5UYNJFi.png 415w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2560x1229/480x230/filters:focal(1280x615:1281x616):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25283483/5UYNJFi.png 480w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2560x1229/540x259/filters:focal(1280x615:1281x616):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25283483/5UYNJFi.png 540w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2560x1229/640x307/filters:focal(1280x615:1281x616):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25283483/5UYNJFi.png 640w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2560x1229/750x360/filters:focal(1280x615:1281x616):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25283483/5UYNJFi.png 750w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2560x1229/828x398/filters:focal(1280x615:1281x616):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25283483/5UYNJFi.png 828w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2560x1229/1080x518/filters:focal(1280x615:1281x616):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25283483/5UYNJFi.png 1080w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2560x1229/1200x576/filters:focal(1280x615:1281x616):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25283483/5UYNJFi.png 1200w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2560x1229/1440x691/filters:focal(1280x615:1281x616):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25283483/5UYNJFi.png 1440w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2560x1229/1920x922/filters:focal(1280x615:1281x616):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25283483/5UYNJFi.png 1920w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2560x1229/2048x983/filters:focal(1280x615:1281x616):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25283483/5UYNJFi.png 2048w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2560x1229/2400x1152/filters:focal(1280x615:1281x616):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25283483/5UYNJFi.png 2400w" src="https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2560x1229/2400x1152/filters:focal(1280x615:1281x616):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25283483/5UYNJFi.png" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></span></p></div></figure></div><div><figcaption><em>Chat with RTX isn’t always accurate, though.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Screenshot by Tom Warren / The Verge</cite></p></div></div><p>It took around 30 minutes for Chat with RTX to install on my PC, which is powered by an Intel Core i9-14900K processor with an RTX 4090 GPU. The app is nearly 40GB in size, and the Python instance takes up around 3GB of RAM out of the 64GB available on my system. Once it’s running, you access Chat with RTX from a browser, while a command prompt runs in the background spewing out what’s being processed and any error codes.</p><p>Nvidia isn’t offering this as a polished app that all RTX owners should download and install immediately. There are a number of known issues and limitations, including that source attribution isn’t always accurate. I also initially attempted to get Chat with RTX to index 25,000 documents, but this seemed to crash the app, and I had to clear the preferences to get going again.</p><p>Chat with RTX also doesn’t remember context, so follow-up questions can’t be based on the context of a previous question. It also creates JSON files inside the folders you ask it to index, so I wouldn’t recommend using this on your entire Documents folder in Windows. </p><p>I love a good tech demo, though, and Nvidia has certainly delivered that here. It shows the promise of what an AI chatbot can do locally on your PC in the future, especially if you don’t want to have to subscribe to something like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/15/24038711/microsoft-copilot-pro-office-ai-apps">Copilot Pro</a> or <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/29/23937497/chatgpt-plus-new-beta-all-tools-update-pdf-data-analysis">ChatGPT Plus</a> just to analyze your personal files.</p></div></div>]]></description>

   <p>Before we dive deeper into their problems, it's worth saying that dating apps have helped many people find love. According to a survey of Americans by <a href="https://click.nl.npr.org/?qs=256751f68502a2a479b1d13b896b24f13f4b29ff2add1efc1188e7bb77549cf9923f944163fc7a19abeb240af654fa34995d804b949502ee">Pew Research Center published last year</a>, "one-in-ten partnered adults — meaning those who are married, living with a partner or in a committed romantic relationship — met their current significant other through a dating site or app." </p>   <p>But there's an awkward tension at the heart of the dating app business model. They are for-profit tech companies that want to attract as many users as possible and inevitably make money from them. But at the same time, true success for their users — at least for the large population looking for more than just hookups — means that they find love and get off the apps. For each successful match, the dating app loses not just one, but two customers! </p>   <p>Call it the dating app paradox: Dating apps are supposed to be matching lovebirds together, but once they do, the lovebirds fly away — and take their money with them.</p>   <p><strong><em>[Editor's note: This is an excerpt of </em></strong><strong>Planet Money</strong><strong><em>'s newsletter. You can </em></strong><a href="https://www.npr.org/newsletter/money"><strong><em>sign up here</em></strong></a><strong><em>.]</em></strong></p>   <p>Of all the dating apps, Hinge — a Match Group property that has grown increasingly popular in recent years — is perhaps the most illustrative of the dating app paradox. Hinge markets itself as "the dating app designed to be deleted." How many other companies market themselves this way? Hinge is literally touting success as constantly losing customers. Their social and business missions are in a messy relationship, to say the least.</p>   
   <h3>A viral theory for why dating apps are so bad</h3>   <p>Last month, TikTok user bianca (@infinitebs), who calls herself an "amateur sociologist &amp; silly goose" on her profile, released a <a href="https://click.nl.npr.org/?qs=256751f68502a2a4d72c2f4754c01436df5387ae7caacbb0f965c795b3891db6c382e22d56b9d7d9d54f038ac057b017268795cc4c436ab9">viral TikTok video</a> in which she argues that, basically, Hinge is the latest dating app to inevitably fall victim to the core contradiction between its missions of matchmaking and moneymaking. </p>   <p>Hinge, like many other dating apps, has a "freemium" business model, which means you can sign up and use the basic app for free, but extras — like a higher-visibility profile or the ability to message people who have not shown interest in you — cost money. </p>   <p>According to a <a href="https://click.nl.npr.org/?qs=256751f68502a2a4549a0172481d038b5f39baf8cfddd65ba209562ae13c6dd50ee093b6e11c59583faa2b5b2c47bbda30d303f73f1cab75">poll published by Pew last year</a>, about a third of Americans who have used dating apps have paid to do so. Morgan Stanley <a href="https://click.nl.npr.org/?qs=256751f68502a2a42152fed3a01eb13219e5282bbe917e77b283dc8ed3082e1798b8c253d57ec2935dcdcb5ae8437fd3a03cccc09dc6d0b0">found</a> that dating app users who choose to pay end up spending "between $18 and $19 per month on either subscriptions or a la carte purchases." </p>   <p>But the dating app companies — and their investors — are apparently not satisfied with the number of users who are choosing to pay for their services. With their stock prices in the gutter and their investors clamoring for more revenue, many dating apps have been shifting gears to entice more free users to become paid users.</p>   <p>Like <a href="https://click.nl.npr.org/?qs=256751f68502a2a49eb285a4db1da9cf97369769743e73580f85c68e0b46eebf74aa78aa678acaa3ecf9f883a26192527f0f186bda444fac">many</a> other <a href="https://click.nl.npr.org/?qs=256751f68502a2a4ae211d45981cda1b3fb1efc0073e4fdcc3e8386dc20a8d0f0b578c7e6dd0d62e0aa8c58db85d08c111fe31248eddffa2">users</a>, Bianca is <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OnlineDating/comments/16uodaq/online_dating_has_gotten_worse_recently/?utm_source=npr_newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=20240202&amp;utm_term=9250242&amp;utm_campaign=money&amp;utm_id=8562679&amp;orgid=128&amp;utm_att1=">not happy</a> with that. Hinge, she argues, has "hit the inflection point" where its free version is "absolute trash." In its mission to make money, it has been using tricks and schemes — like, she says, putting desirable matches "behind a paywall" — to convince more of its users to pony up and use premium features.</p>   <p>Dating apps aren't alone in seemingly getting worse when they try to make money. In fact, last year journalist Cory Doctorow <a href="https://click.nl.npr.org/?qs=256751f68502a2a47cab8f5cccbe97c82a50f03aebe7e87369b7a8987174b5a67ff55c99ed28aae3f6830daf3b0275d697772bfd1830b8f4">coined a term</a> for this pattern: "enshittification." Basically, Doctorow says tech platforms start off trying to make their user experiences really good because their first goal is to try to become popular and achieve scale. But over time, they inevitably pursue their ultimate goal of making money, which ends up making the whole user experience "enshittified." </p>   
   <p>Historically at least, daters could find an easy solution if a dating app put its moneymaking interest ahead of its interest in matchmaking and ruined the user experience. That fix: healthy competition. Lovebirds would flock to another app. For example, as Bianca notes in her video, when Tinder went downhill, users headed to Bumble and then eventually to Hinge.  </p>   <p>But unlike previous sagas in the dating app wars, Bianca asserts, a new better app has failed to overtake Hinge. The result: "Dating apps have never been worse than they are now." Bianca is <a href="https://thetab.com/uk/2024/01/29/dating-app-not-working-flop-hinge-tinder-349245?utm_source=npr_newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=20240202&amp;utm_term=9250242&amp;utm_campaign=money&amp;utm_id=8562679&amp;orgid=128&amp;utm_att1=">hardly alone</a> in <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/93k9jd/why-dating-sucks-we-asked-experts?utm_source=npr_newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=20240202&amp;utm_term=9250242&amp;utm_campaign=money&amp;utm_id=8562679&amp;orgid=128&amp;utm_att1=">asserting</a> that dating apps are now worse than ever. </p>   <p>So if we accept that we've now entered the dark ages of app dating, why isn't competition working anymore? It's possible that new apps are failing to rise and topple the reigning ones because of monopolistic strategies of companies like Match Group, which has been systematically acquiring rivals, including Hinge back <a href="https://click.nl.npr.org/?qs=0d8ebbdf533f962ff1a0dea4036eafd3a4279286351fa794fc7efba5de18fd700cf8caf5c4df98899cf6e37ffe834233b40bed324313d9d8">in 2018</a>. </p>   <p>Match Group, of course, denies that its acquisition strategy hurts healthy competition in the dating app market. And it also rejects what we've been calling the dating app paradox. It doesn't see a contradiction between its goals of matchmaking and moneymaking. It sees its social and business missions as in a stable, beautiful marriage. </p>   <p>"Our goal is to make meaningful connections for every single person on our platforms," says a Match Group spokesperson. "Our business model is driven by providing users with great experiences, so they champion our brands and their power to form life-changing relationships. Unlike many other tech platforms, our business is not driven by keeping users engaged on the apps, but by successful outcomes. We receive wedding invitations and hear Match Group love stories every day, and we celebrate those."</p>   <p>Match Group argues, in other words, that its business incentives are aligned with the interests of its users looking for lasting love. But are they really? Sure, app executives may get warm, fuzzy feelings about receiving wedding invitations from their clients. Matched couples may even tell their single friends, helping to convince new people to join their apps. </p>   
   <p>However, we can imagine a dating app business model where its incentives are much more closely aligned with users' hopes of finding love. Imagine the app gets paid only when people successfully match and leave the app! Now that would eliminate the dating app paradox. </p>   <h3>Adverse selection in the dating app market?</h3>   <p>It's possible there's another classic economics problem behind the cycle of dating app degradation. Daters looking for a life partner inevitably confront serious information problems. The people on these apps, after all, are usually complete strangers — and the only information you have about them is what they choose to put on their profiles. That may be fine for people just looking for hookups. But a core challenge for daters looking for true love on these apps: How do you sift through the players and commitment-phobes and find the gems? </p>   <p>Economist George Akerlof won a Nobel Prize for <a href="https://click.nl.npr.org/?qs=0d8ebbdf533f962f30dec45c736679f9b464d0c333485e418224bfd6a99ad474094357c965aa3a4a862a616b2d11e186b4deee8ca245a75a">his work</a> explaining how information problems like this can ruin a market. (Fun fact: Akerlof is U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen's husband. Now that's a worthy match!) Akerlof famously used the example of used cars to explain how bad information can result in market failures. </p>   <p>It's well known that as soon as you drive a new car off the lot, its value drops precipitously. For a long time, economists explained this phenomenon by claiming that people just place a premium on having a brand-new car. </p>   <p>But Akerlof offered a different explanation: Buyers of used cars lack vital information about what they're buying. When you buy a used car, there's always the chance it could be a lemon. Because of this risk of buying a piece of junk, Akerlof theorized, buyers become unwilling to pay top dollar for them. It's too risky. They treat every car like a potential lemon and demand a discount, even if the cars they're buying may actually look and run great.</p>   
   <p>And that creates a problem for the sellers of used cars that are actually good. These sellers are like, "What the heck?! I <em>know</em> my car isn't a lemon! It's worth way more than what you're willing to pay!" And so they refuse to sell their used car and they exit the market. The result is a market where lemons become more prevalent. </p>   <p>It's a vicious spiral where, as buyers become more suspicious that every car is a lemon, they demand further price markdowns and owners of good used cars become even more unwilling to sell at the lower price. Ultimately, the whole market gets destroyed. Because buyers have a hard time determining good from bad, the lemons drive quality used cars out of the market. Economists call this adverse selection. (<a href="https://click.nl.npr.org/?qs=0d8ebbdf533f962fd217fa4ec389c00a39c2b4d7cb63ebe27ce0e9d2c03394b0d4ed2368fcdefc44b638f4eafa2070f4933073ea9d37a230">Listen to this Planet Money Summer School episode for more</a>. <a href="https://click.nl.npr.org/?qs=0d8ebbdf533f962f59e4d9ff7336094d538d78a27210bcdfe756045a1904f764681c702ca2e8934a284e873ba2fcd8526fb3c3d060ed0bd7"><em>Spotify</em></a><em>/</em><a href="https://click.nl.npr.org/?qs=0d8ebbdf533f962f4419c24c8224b1ad6729e20bc97d2bce163b074d5d62db65981ba641c5abde414e85818d0a52eecc8a7d124d6b806a67"><em>Apple Podcasts</em></a>)</p>   <p>It's possible that dating apps face adverse selection. Basically, a new app starts up, and hopeless romantics looking for real love begin flocking to it. But so do sleazy types who lie on their dating profiles. Over time, the earnest daters go on a bunch of bad dates, encountering people who have no interest in real relationships or whose profiles are completely misleading. </p>   <p>Like lemons driving good cars out of the used-car market, maybe sleazeballs push great catches out of dating apps and ultimately ruin the quality of the whole app experience. So people go to a new app with the hopes of finding something better, and the cycle starts again. </p>   <p>Akerlof saw solutions to the lemon problem. Basically, people need warranties or ways to get better information about what they're buying. We've seen advances like this in the used-car market. For example, the company Carfax <a href="https://click.nl.npr.org/?qs=12dd3a66e2d70c08265ac2364869673409d650c56b685710e051772cb4fd4984e7a549d15f98106f824d326808edb8c0ac3236b729d0491f">offers</a> trusted information about the history of used cars. You can find out about a vehicle's history of accidents or its trips to the mechanic, for instance. This helps buyers overcome their suspicions and helps sellers of good used cars prove their cars are worth top dollar. </p>   
   <p>It's possible that dating apps could try to find similar solutions. Think like a Carfax for daters! Or a rating system, which is Airbnb's solution to this kind of information problem. Of course, daters will probably object to any system that gives your exes the power to rate you :). It's possible, however, that app designers could find more suitable solutions to the information problems of the online dating world.</p>   <p>All this said, maybe dating is just hard, especially now that you can potentially match with a much bigger number of people thanks to technology. Whatever the case, if you're in the market for love, good luck and, ummm, Happy Valentine's Day!</p>   <p><em>Extra listening: Check out our annual Valentine's Day episode in the </em><a href="https://www.npr.org/podcasts/510289/planet-money/">Planet Money<em> feed</em></a><em>, where we send love letters to our favorite stories and books and whatever else that other people have made that taught us things or just made us jealous.

It has 20 pages. The LibreOffice imported version has 24 pages.&nbsp;</p><p>To get an overview of what's different I created a PDF from the LibreOffice version and then looked at it and the CERN PDF in the contact sheet version in Apple Preview.</p><p>Here's the CERN PDF:</p><p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgtmLx2yw7hBNA1hZ0YGxlcvJee0qSv5IoSm6ytWun-nEFw7z-5yWT0Ckc7pzcW6SGZl72nM-jYZUbV5ZUhUlfrGjYWcmz6HVD_p6XI1bEegfQucRbHhjfaPwnlz4mH_V-ANzeCzsMNDX8Fr5vsBpTi8oY1M-zCB26mlpsvCwdUzWXGi9mSNUfBrg/s2444/proposal-5.png"><img data-original-height="700" data-original-width="2444" height="184" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgtmLx2yw7hBNA1hZ0YGxlcvJee0qSv5IoSm6ytWun-nEFw7z-5yWT0Ckc7pzcW6SGZl72nM-jYZUbV5ZUhUlfrGjYWcmz6HVD_p6XI1bEegfQucRbHhjfaPwnlz4mH_V-ANzeCzsMNDX8Fr5vsBpTi8oY1M-zCB26mlpsvCwdUzWXGi9mSNUfBrg/w640-h184/proposal-5.png" width="640"></a></p><p>Here's the LibreOffice-generated PDF:</p><p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhKTElIxIWy-jOHKCzOuLo8pd1rk_9ChaGL93vgNMElSsu9eRgIh_LHJ3yDVXzOvHFfF5iDEwRoPMH_Dyeuk1HNcB5K6wZOKu229VWK7kNpvpgGMXF7oekB5C-O4sRxK9fRPFTxSqEj8u3fUH7t9p8Un9on_hKu8sh0vliaQ98GRtp-TYRrrQ2PYQ/s2444/proposal-6.png"><img data-original-height="1052" data-original-width="2444" height="276" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhKTElIxIWy-jOHKCzOuLo8pd1rk_9ChaGL93vgNMElSsu9eRgIh_LHJ3yDVXzOvHFfF5iDEwRoPMH_Dyeuk1HNcB5K6wZOKu229VWK7kNpvpgGMXF7oekB5C-O4sRxK9fRPFTxSqEj8u3fUH7t9p8Un9on_hKu8sh0vliaQ98GRtp-TYRrrQ2PYQ/w640-h276/proposal-6.png" width="640"></a></p><p>Things that are different:</p><p>1.

The LibreOffice version has turned headers with TBL's initials in them into footers.</p><p>4. The page breaks look in the right places (see how the images are correctly placed towards the end); thus it's probably the font size that's the biggest problem.</p><p>5. There CERN PDF has a space under the heading and the LibreOffice version does not.</p><h2>Emulation</h2><p>To make sure that I knew what the actual original document looked like I decided to use <a href="https://infinitemac.org/1990/System%206.0.5">Infinite Mac</a> to boot a 1990-era Macintosh and run actual Word for Macintosh 4.0 on the original document.</p><p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiijOiXeCEF_J1oTZBDun1YT3lye7507nTXRpEAUjYW6CQOVFhI6Qb1jGJhDgAJeOEA1BwmDFLqPYnq25JSXaK5zw2oZOFBTvZiVqmNfhf8Vfp4UYQ_HwJzIKuC_a3kAfvGNhR3U6rSlB77KUFilVUX2lVL7SKnnaQU4ZHkwilImtVFGqKak4kG1w/s1411/proposal-9.png"><img data-original-height="1081" data-original-width="1411" height="490" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiijOiXeCEF_J1oTZBDun1YT3lye7507nTXRpEAUjYW6CQOVFhI6Qb1jGJhDgAJeOEA1BwmDFLqPYnq25JSXaK5zw2oZOFBTvZiVqmNfhf8Vfp4UYQ_HwJzIKuC_a3kAfvGNhR3U6rSlB77KUFilVUX2lVL7SKnnaQU4ZHkwilImtVFGqKak4kG1w/w640-h490/proposal-9.png" width="640"></a></p><p>That way I can see actual fonts, font sizes and layout to confirm how the document should have looked. And that's where it became obvious that the original document on the original Mac and the CERN PDF are quite different. The CERN PDF has 20 pages. On the Mac running Word for Macintosh 4.0 with A4 paper it has 22 pages. So I decided to aim to get us close to the original document on the Mac.</p><table><tbody><tr><td><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjM3_thqxV_ZB-VqLJRytn7oA8LbAMlQ2a3kRZrubYhWt4M8ns2R-3nHFXFG-367BDUJQkHtLO6oqFNrZWGXhwlQfarVp_ih1SDBgBWsWGBKqKmZUYD51WLmLIGCQ1no0EcAPeTidkHBb52Y-EY7AXYnBX9nll33G7FuZofLN9XgpD0bWak-T1ONQ/s1389/proposal-10.png"><img data-original-height="1062" data-original-width="1389" height="490" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjM3_thqxV_ZB-VqLJRytn7oA8LbAMlQ2a3kRZrubYhWt4M8ns2R-3nHFXFG-367BDUJQkHtLO6oqFNrZWGXhwlQfarVp_ih1SDBgBWsWGBKqKmZUYD51WLmLIGCQ1no0EcAPeTidkHBb52Y-EY7AXYnBX9nll33G7FuZofLN9XgpD0bWak-T1ONQ/w640-h490/proposal-10.png" width="640"></a></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr></tbody></table><p><span>So... set to A4 paper and set right margin to same size as left margin.

It's interesting, and a little disheartening to see that this 34 year old document is difficult to open, and even when opened the resulting output isn't exactly the same as the original.</p><p>PS If you're wondering why I ever started this project.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/02/13/tesla_cybertruck_rust/">https://www.theregister.com/2024/02/13/tesla_cybertruck_rust/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39357595">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p>It's only been a few months since Tesla's long-awaited Cybertruck made its way to those at the front of the queue, but the arrival has been tarnished for some.</p>
<p>CEO Elon Musk first unveiled the electric pickup model <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2019/11/22/smashing_tesla_cybertruck/">back in 2019</a>, claiming that its "ultra-hard stainless steel" body and "transparent metal" glass were "literally bulletproof."</p>
<p>Though beset with <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/07/17/first_tesla_cybertrunk/">production issues</a> and missing its speculative 2021-22 release, its unique polygonal design – as with anything Tesla and Musk-related – attracted legions of devotees eager to get their hands on the steering wheel.</p>

    

<p>This unique design isn't without shortfalls, at least according to reports in the <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.cybertruckownersclub.com/">Cybertruck Owners Club</a> forum. A trending thread titled "<a target="_blank" href="https://www.cybertruckownersclub.com/forum/threads/rust-spots-corrosion-is-the-norm.11988/">Rust Spots/Corrosion is the Norm</a>" from a user going by "Raxar" states:</p>

<p>This, as you might expect, provoked a strong reaction from the faithful. "Liar. Is this fun for you?" one asked, while another incorrectly riposted: "If it 'rusts', it's not stainless steel." This is a common misconception. Stainless steel is resistant to rust, but not completely immune.</p>
<p>Members pondered whether orange stains could be caused by "rail dust" from certain vehicles being delivered via train, yet Raxar <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.cybertruckownersclub.com/forum/threads/rust-spots-corrosion-is-the-norm.11988/post-240328">posted some images</a> of his Cybertruck's body after driving it for "2 days in rain."</p>

        


        

<p>The tiny specks may not seem like a big deal, but given that the Cybertruck price went from $40,000 in 2019 to $60,000 in 2023, we understand why owners might want their cars to appear pristine at all times.</p>
<p>In a <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.cybertruckownersclub.com/forum/threads/cybertruck-spots-corrosion.12242/">separate thread</a>, another user, vertigo3pc, reported that "corrosion was forming on the metal" of his brand-new Cybertruck after 11 days in the "LA rain," leading some to worry that the steel body was becoming contaminated during production.</p>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/11/13/want_a_cybertruck_then_youre/">Want a Cybertruck? You're stuck with it for a year, says Tesla</a></li>
</ul>
<p>However, corrosion reports may stem from owners believing that "ultra-hard stainless steel" doesn't require much care. Tesla, it appears, would vehemently disagree.</p>
<p>Another thread from January <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.cybertruckownersclub.com/forum/threads/cybertruck-corrosion-per-owner-manual.11445/">included a screenshot of Cybertruck's maintenance documentation</a>, where it is said that the car does not have a clear coat. Clear coat is the outermost layer of transparent paint that serves as a protective barrier, preventing UV radiation and weather from damaging the colored paint layer. Clear coat also takes abrasions that might otherwise scratch the paint job.</p>

        

<p>The user warns: "The Cybertruck's exterior is susceptible to corrosion, as acknowledged in the manual. Once the oxide barrier is compromised, corrosion initiates. The manual advises prompt removal of corrosive substances, emphasizing not to wait until the Cybertruck is scheduled for a full wash."</p>
<p>The documentation says: "To prevent damage to the exterior, immediately remove corrosive substances (such as grease, oil, bird droppings, tree resin, dead insects, tar spots, road salt, industrial fallout, etc.). Do not wait until Cybertruck is due for a complete wash. If necessary use denatured alcohol to remove tar spots and stubborn grease stains, then immediately wash the area with water and a mild, non-detergent soap to remove the alcohol."</p>
<p>It sounds like a lot of work if even a five-minute dash for milk might result in a midge besmirching the body. Tesla explicitly states: "The stainless steel exterior of Cybertruck is more resistant to dents and dings than most other vehicles. However, Cybertruck does not have a clear coat on the surface of the exterior body panels, meaning any scratches that appear are in the stainless steel panels themselves."</p>

        

<p><em>The Register</em> asked Tesla whether it agreed with the description of Cybertruck corrosion as the "norm," and if not, what the company expected to cause the spots documented. We will update the article if a response is forthcoming. ®</p>
