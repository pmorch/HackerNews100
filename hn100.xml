<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>OpenAI, the maker of the <a href="https://firstpagesage.com/reports/top-generative-ai-chatbots/">most popular AI chatbot</a>, used to say it aimed to build artificial intelligence that “safely benefits humanity, unconstrained by a need to generate financial return,” <a href="https://cdn.theconversation.com/static_files/files/4099/2023-IRS990-OpenAI.pdf?1770819990">according to its 2023</a> mission statement. But the ChatGPT maker seems to no longer have the same emphasis on doing so “safely.”</p>

<p>While reviewing its latest IRS disclosure form, which was released in November 2025 and covers 2024, I noticed OpenAI <a href="https://app.candid.org/profile/9571629/openai-81-0861541?activeTab=7">had removed “safely” from its mission statement</a>, among other changes. That change in wording coincided with its <a href="https://theconversation.com/as-openai-attracts-billions-in-new-investment-its-goal-of-balancing-profit-with-purpose-is-getting-more-challenging-to-pull-off-240602">transformation from a nonprofit organization</a> into a business <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/11/technology/openai-revenue-challenge.html">increasingly focused on profits</a>.</p>

<p>OpenAI currently faces <a href="https://www.transparencycoalition.ai/news/seven-more-lawsuits-filed-against-openai-for-chatgpt-suicide-coaching">several lawsuits</a> related to its products’ safety, making this change newsworthy. Many of the plaintiffs suing the AI company allege psychological manipulation, wrongful death and assisted suicide, while others have filed negligence claims.</p>

<p>As a scholar of <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&amp;hl=en&amp;user=_-YZrXgAAAAJ&amp;citation_for_view=_-YZrXgAAAAJ:hC7cP41nSMkC">nonprofit accountability</a> and the <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&amp;hl=en&amp;user=_-YZrXgAAAAJ&amp;citation_for_view=_-YZrXgAAAAJ:_kc_bZDykSQC">governance of social enterprises</a>, I see the deletion of the word “safely” from its mission statement as a significant shift that has largely gone unreported – outside <a href="https://news.aibase.com/news/22994">highly specialized outlets</a>.</p>

<p>And I believe OpenAI’s makeover is a test case for how we, as a society, oversee the work of organizations that have the potential to both provide enormous benefits and do catastrophic harm. </p>



<h2>Tracing OpenAI’s origins</h2>

<p>OpenAI, which also makes the Sora video artificial intelligence app, was founded as a nonprofit scientific research lab in 2015. Its original purpose was to benefit society by <a href="https://perma.cc/MXE3-FJ7F">making its findings public and royalty-free</a> rather than to make money. </p>

<p>To raise the money that developing its AI models would require, OpenAI, under the leadership of CEO Sam Altman, created a <a href="https://openai.com/our-structure/">for-profit subsidiary in 2019</a>. Microsoft initially invested US$1 billion in this venture; by 2024 that sum had topped $13 billion.</p>

<p>In exchange, Microsoft was promised a portion of future profits, capped at 100 times its initial investment. But the software giant didn’t get a seat on OpenAI’s nonprofit board – meaning it lacked the power to help steer the AI venture it was funding.</p>

<p>A subsequent round of funding in late 2024, which raised $6.6 billion from multiple investors, came with a catch: that the funding would become debt <a href="https://theconversation.com/as-openai-attracts-billions-in-new-investment-its-goal-of-balancing-profit-with-purpose-is-getting-more-challenging-to-pull-off-240602">unless OpenAI converted to a more traditional for-profit business</a> in which investors could own shares, without any caps on profits, and possibly occupy board seats.  </p>

<h2>Establishing a new structure</h2>

<p>In October 2025, OpenAI reached an agreement with the attorneys general of California and Delaware to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/28/technology/openai-restructure-for-profit-company.html?searchResultPosition=6">become a more traditional for-profit company</a>.</p>

<p>Under the new arrangement, OpenAI was split into two entities: a nonprofit foundation and a for-profit business.  </p>

<p>The restructured nonprofit, the <a href="https://openai.com/foundation/">OpenAI Foundation</a>, owns about one-fourth of the stock in a new <a href="https://delcode.delaware.gov/title8/c001/sc15/">for-profit public benefit corporation</a>, the <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/openais-restructuring-sets-could-biggest-004100492.html">OpenAI Group</a>. Both are headquartered in California but <a href="https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/26205026/openai-pbc-articles-of-incorporation.pdf">incorporated in Delaware</a>.</p>

<p>A <a href="https://corpgov.law.harvard.edu/2020/08/31/delaware-public-benefit-corporations-recent-developments/">public benefit corporation</a> is a business that must consider interests beyond shareholders, such as those of society and the environment, and it must issue an annual benefit report to its shareholders and the public. However, it is up to the board to decide how to weigh those interests and what to report in terms of the benefits and harms caused by the company.  </p>

<p>The new structure is described in a <a href="https://cdn.theconversation.com/static_files/files/4101/Final_Executed_MOU_Between_OpenAI_and_California_AG_re_Notice_of_Conditions_of_Non-Objection_%2810.27.2025%29_%28Signed_by_OpenAI%29_%28Signed_by_CA_DOJ%29.pdf?1770844719">memorandum of understanding</a> signed in October 2025 by OpenAI and the California attorney general, and <a href="https://news.delaware.gov/2025/10/28/ag-jennings-completes-review-of-openai-recapitalization/">endorsed by the Delaware attorney general</a>.</p>

<p>Many business media outlets heralded the move, predicting that it would <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/openai-converts-to-public-benefit-corporation-with-microsoft-taking-27-stake-714a6c05">usher in more investment</a>. Two months later, SoftBank, a Japanese conglomerate, finalized a <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/softbank-has-fully-funded-its-40-billion-investment-openai-cnbc-reports-2025-12-30/">$41 billion investment in OpenAI</a>.</p>

<h2>Changing its mission statement</h2>

<p>Most charities must <a href="https://theconversation.com/whats-a-990-form-a-charity-accounting-expert-explains-175019">file forms annually with the Internal Revenue Service</a> with details about their missions, activities and financial status to show that they qualify for tax-exempt status. Because the IRS makes the forms public, they have become a way for nonprofits to signal their missions to the world.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://app.candid.org/profile/9571629/openai-81-0861541?activeTab=7">its forms for 2022</a>, <a href="https://cdn.theconversation.com/static_files/files/4099/2023-IRS990-OpenAI.pdf?1770819990">and 2023</a>, OpenAI said its mission was “to build general-purpose artificial intelligence (AI) that safely benefits humanity, unconstrained by a need to generate financial return.”</p>

            <figcaption>

<p>OpenAI had dropped its commitment to safety from its mission statement – along with a commitment to being “unconstrained” by a need to make money for investors. According to Platformer, a tech media outlet, it has also disbanded its “<a href="https://www.platformer.news/openai-mission-alignment-team-joshua-achiam/">mission alignment</a>” team.</p>

<p>In my view, these changes explicitly signal that OpenAI is making its profits a higher priority than the safety of its products.</p>

<p>To be sure, OpenAI continues to mention safety when it <a href="https://openai.com/index/why-our-structure-must-evolve-to-advance-our-mission/">discusses its mission</a>. “We view this mission as the most important challenge of our time,” it states on its website. “It requires simultaneously advancing AI’s capability, safety, and positive impact in the world.”</p>

<h2>Revising its legal governance structure</h2>

<p>Nonprofit boards are responsible for key decisions and <a href="https://theconversation.com/openai-is-a-nonprofit-corporate-hybrid-a-management-expert-explains-how-this-model-works-and-how-it-fueled-the-tumult-around-ceo-sam-altmans-short-lived-ouster-218340">upholding their organization’s mission</a>.</p>

<p>Unlike private companies, board members of <a href="https://www.irs.gov/charities-non-profits/charitable-organizations/exemption-requirements-501c3-organizations">tax-exempt charitable nonprofits</a> cannot personally enrich themselves by taking a share of earnings. In cases where a nonprofit owns a for-profit business, as OpenAI did with its previous structure, investors can take a cut of profits – but they typically do not get a seat on the board or have an opportunity to elect board members, because that would be seen as a conflict of interest.  </p>

<p>The OpenAI Foundation now has a 26% stake in OpenAI Group. In effect, that means that the nonprofit board has given up nearly three-quarters of its control over the company. Software giant Microsoft owns a slightly larger stake – 27% of OpenAI’s stock – due to its <a href="https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/11/03/open-ai-move-made-microsoft-no-brainer-buy/">$13.8 billion investment in the AI company</a> to date. OpenAI’s employees and its other investors own the rest of the shares. </p>

<h2>Seeking more investment</h2>

<p>The main goal of OpenAI’s restructuring, which it called a “<a href="https://openai.com/index/built-to-benefit-everyone/">recapitalization</a>,” was to attract more private investment in the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/councils/forbesbusinesscouncil/2025/02/27/the-ai-arms-race-deepseek-vs-openai-and-the-battle-for-global-ai-dominance/">race for AI dominance</a>.</p>

<p>It has already succeeded on that front.</p>

<p>As of early February 2026, the company was in talks with SoftBank for an <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/softbank-talks-invest-up-30-billion-more-openai-wsj-reports-2026-01-28/">additional $30 billion</a> and stands to get up to a total of <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/amazon-talks-invest-up-50-billion-openai-wsj-reports-2026-01-29/">$60 billion from Amazon, Nvidia and Microsoft</a> combined.</p>

<p>OpenAI is now valued at over <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/02/openai-share-sale-500-billion-valuation.html">$500 billion</a>, up from <a href="https://tracxn.com/d/companies/openai/__kElhSG7uVGeFk1i71Co9-nwFtmtyMVT7f-YHMn4TFBg/funding-and-investors#funding-rounds">$300 billion</a> in March 2025. The new structure also paves the way for an eventual <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/ipo.asp">initial public offering</a>, which, if it happens, would not only help the company <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/openai-ipo-anthropic-race-69f06a42">raise more capital through stock markets</a> but would also increase the pressure to make money for its shareholders.</p>

<p>OpenAI says the foundation’s endowment is <a href="https://openai.com/index/built-to-benefit-everyone/">worth about $130 billion</a>.</p>

<p>Those numbers are only estimates because OpenAI is a privately held company without publicly traded shares. That means these figures are based on market value estimates rather than any objective evidence, such as market capitalization.</p>

<p>When he <a href="https://oag.ca.gov/news/press-releases/attorney-general-bonta-issues-statement-openai%E2%80%99s-recapitalization-plan">announced the new structure</a>, California Attorney General Rob Bonta said, “We secured concessions that ensure charitable assets are used for their intended purpose.” He also predicted that “safety will be prioritized” and said the “top priority is, and always will be, protecting our kids.”  </p>

<h2>Steps that might help keep people safe</h2>

<p>At the same time, several conditions in the OpenAI restructuring memo are designed to promote safety, including:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>A safety and security committee on the OpenAI Foundation board has the authority to <a href="https://cdn.theconversation.com/static_files/files/4101/Final_Executed_MOU_Between_OpenAI_and_California_AG_re_Notice_of_Conditions_of_Non-Objection_%2810.27.2025%29_%28Signed_by_OpenAI%29_%28Signed_by_CA_DOJ%29.pdf?1770844719">“require mitigation measures”</a> that could potentially include the halting of a release of new OpenAI products based on assessments of their risks. </p></li>
<li><p>The for-profit OpenAI Group has its own board, which must consider only OpenAI’s mission – rather than financial issues – regarding safety and security issues.</p></li>
<li><p>The OpenAI Foundation’s nonprofit board gets to appoint all members of the OpenAI Group’s for-profit board.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>But given that neither the mission of the foundation nor of the OpenAI group explicitly alludes to safety, it will be hard to hold their boards accountable for it. </p>

<p>Furthermore, since <a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2025-10-30/openai-restructure-paves-way-for-ipo-and-ai-spending-spree">all but one board member currently serve on both boards</a>, it is hard to see how they might oversee themselves. And <a href="https://cdn.theconversation.com/static_files/files/4101/Final_Executed_MOU_Between_OpenAI_and_California_AG_re_Notice_of_Conditions_of_Non-Objection_%2810.27.2025%29_%28Signed_by_OpenAI%29_%28Signed_by_CA_DOJ%29.pdf?1770844719">the memorandum signed by the California attorney general</a> doesn’t indicate whether he was aware of the removal of any reference to safety from the mission statement.</p>

<h2>Identifying other paths OpenAI could have taken</h2>

<p>There are alternative models that I believe would serve the public interest better than this one.</p>

<p>When Health Net, a California nonprofit <a href="https://www.medicare.gov/health-drug-plans/health-plans/your-health-plan-options/HMO">health maintenance organization</a>, <a href="https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1992-02-08-fi-1192-story.html">converted to a for-profit insurance company</a> in 1992, regulators required that 80% of its equity be transferred to another <a href="https://www.calwellness.org/mission/our-story/">nonprofit health foundation</a>. Unlike with OpenAI, the foundation had majority control after the transformation.</p>

<p>A <a href="https://www.eyesonopenai.org/">coalition of California nonprofits</a> has argued that the attorney general should require OpenAI to transfer all of its assets to an independent nonprofit.  </p>

<p>Another example is <a href="https://www.lenfestinstitute.org/our-work/the-philadelphia-inquirer/">The Philadelphia Inquirer</a>. The Pennsylvania newspaper <a href="https://current.org/2016/04/as-philadelphia-newspapers-turn-to-nonprofits-who-is-public-media/">became a for-profit public benefit corporation</a> in 2016. It belongs to the Lenfest Institute, a nonprofit.</p>

<p>This structure allows Philadelphia’s biggest newspaper to attract investment without compromising its purpose – journalism serving the needs of its local communities. It’s become a model for potentially <a href="https://www.inquirer.com/opinion/commentary/press-forward-lenfest-institute-journalism-philanthropy-american-democracy-20230907.html">transforming the local news industry</a>. </p>

<p>At this point, I believe that the public bears the burden of two governance failures. One is that OpenAI’s board has apparently abandoned its mission of safety. And the other is that the attorneys general of California and Delaware have let that happen.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><span>United States Customs</span> and Border Protection plans to spend $225,000 for a year of access to <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/clearview-ai-new-tools-identify-you-photos/">Clearview AI</a>, a <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/cbp-ice-dhs-mobile-fortify-face-recognition-verify-identity/">face recognition</a> tool that compares photos against billions of images <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/clearview-ai-scraping-web/">scraped from the internet</a>.</p><p>The deal extends access to Clearview tools to Border Patrol’s headquarters intelligence division (INTEL) and the National Targeting Center, units that collect and analyze data as part of <a data-offer-url="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/26949964-sow-clearviewai-fy26/" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/26949964-sow-clearviewai-fy26/&quot;}" href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/26949964-sow-clearviewai-fy26/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">what CBP calls</a> a coordinated effort to “disrupt, degrade, and dismantle” people and networks viewed as security threats.</p><p>The contract states that Clearview provides access to “over 60+ billion publicly available images” and will be used for “tactical targeting” and “strategic counter-network analysis,” indicating the service is intended to be embedded in analysts’ day-to-day intelligence work rather than reserved for isolated investigations. CBP says its intelligence units draw from a “variety of sources,” including commercially available tools and publicly available data, to identify people and map their connections for national security and immigration operations.</p><p>The agreement anticipates analysts handling sensitive personal data, including biometric identifiers such as face images, and requires nondisclosure agreements for contractors who have access. It does not specify what kinds of photos agents will upload, whether searches may include US citizens, or how long uploaded images or search results will be retained.</p><p>The Clearview contract lands as the Department of Homeland Security faces mounting scrutiny over how face recognition is used in federal enforcement operations far beyond the border, including large-scale actions in US cities that have swept up US citizens. Civil liberties groups and lawmakers have questioned whether face-search tools are being deployed as routine intelligence infrastructure, rather than limited investigative aids, and whether safeguards have kept pace with expansion.</p><p>Last week, Senator Ed Markey <a href="https://www.markey.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/ice_out_of_our_faces_act.pdf">introduced legislation</a> that would bar ICE and CBP from using face recognition technology altogether, citing concerns that biometric surveillance is being embedded without clear limits, transparency, or public consent.</p><p>CBP did not immediately respond to questions about how Clearview would be integrated into its systems, what types of images agents are authorized to upload, and whether searches may include US citizens.</p><p>Clearview’s business model has drawn scrutiny because it relies on scraping photos from public websites at scale. Those images are converted into biometric templates without the knowledge or consent of the people photographed.</p><p>Clearview also appears in DHS’s recently released <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/ice-is-using-palantirs-ai-tools-to-sort-through-tips/">artificial intelligence inventory</a>, linked to a CBP pilot initiated in October 2025. The inventory entry ties the pilot to CBP’s Traveler Verification System, which conducts face comparisons at ports of entry and other border-related screenings.</p><p>CBP states in its public privacy documentation that the Traveler Verification System does not use information from “commercial sources or publicly available data.” It is more likely, at launch, that Clearview access would instead be tied to CBP’s Automated Targeting System, which links biometric galleries, watch lists, and enforcement records, including files tied to recent Immigration and Customs Enforcement operations in areas of the US far from any border.</p><p>Clearview AI did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p><p>Recent testing <a data-offer-url="https://pages.nist.gov/frvt/html/frvt1N.html#prior-reports" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://pages.nist.gov/frvt/html/frvt1N.html#prior-reports&quot;}" href="https://pages.nist.gov/frvt/html/frvt1N.html#prior-reports" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">by the National Institute of Standards and Technology</a>, which evaluated Clearview AI among other vendors, found that face-search systems can perform well on “high-quality visa-like photos” but falter in less controlled settings. Images captured at border crossings that were “not originally intended for automated face recognition” produced error rates that were “much higher, often in excess of 20 percent, even with the more accurate algorithms,” federal scientists say.</p><p>The testing underscores a central limitation of the technology: NIST found that face-search systems cannot reduce false matches without also increasing the risk that the systems fail to recognize the correct person.</p><p>As a result, NIST says agencies may operate the software in an “investigative” setting that returns a ranked list of candidates for human review rather than a single confirmed match. When systems are configured to always return candidates, however, searches for people not already in the database will still generate “matches” for review. In those cases, the results will always be 100 percent wrong.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-testid="ArticlePageChunks"><div data-journey-hook="grid-wrapper" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p><span>I’m not above</span> doing some <a href="https://www.wired.com/tag/gig-economy/">gig work</a> to make ends meet. In my life, I’ve worked snack food pop-ups in a grocery store, ran the cash register for random merch booths, and even hawked my own plasma at $35 per vial.</p><p>So, when I saw RentAHuman, a new site where <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/malevolent-ai-agent-openclaw-clawdbot/">AI agents</a> hire humans to perform physical work in the real world on behalf of the virtual bots, I was eager to see how these AI overlords would compare to my past experiences with the gig economy.</p><p>Launched in early February, <a data-offer-url="https://rentahuman.ai/" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://rentahuman.ai/&quot;}" href="https://rentahuman.ai/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">RentAHuman</a> was developed by software engineer Alexander Liteplo and his cofounder, Patricia Tani. The site looks like a bare-bones version of other well-known freelance sites like Fiverr and UpWork.</p><p>The site’s homepage declares that these bots need your physical body to complete tasks, and the humans behind these <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/zico-kolter-ai-agents-game-theory/">autonomous agents</a> are willing to pay. “AI can't touch grass. You can. Get paid when agents need someone in the real world,” it reads. Looking at RentAHuman’s design, it’s the kind of website that you hear was “vibe-coded” using <a href="https://www.wired.com/tag/artificial-intelligence/">generative AI</a> tools, which it was, and you nod along, thinking <em>that makes sense</em>.</p><p>After signing up to be one of the gig workers on RentAHuman, I was nudged to connect a <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/how-to-choose-set-up-crypto-wallet/">crypto wallet</a>, which is the only currently working way to get paid. That’s a red flag for me. The site includes an option to connect your bank account—using Stripe for payouts—but it just gave me error messages when I tried getting it to work.</p><p>Next, I was hoping a swarm of AI agents would see my fresh meatsuit, friendly and available at the low price of $20 an hour, as an excellent option for delivering stuff around <a href="https://www.wired.com/tag/san-francisco/">San Francisco</a>, completing some tricky captchas, or whatever else these bots desired.</p><p>Silence. I got nothing, no incoming messages at all on my first afternoon. So I lowered my hourly ask to a measly $5. Maybe undercutting the other human workers with a below-market rate would be the best way to get some agent’s attention. Still, nothing.</p><p>RentAHuman is marketed as a way for AI agents to reach out and hire you on the platform, but the site also includes an option for human users to apply for tasks they are interested in. If these so-called “autonomous” bots weren’t going to make the first move, I guessed it was on me to manually apply for the “bounties” listed on RentAHuman.</p><p>As I browsed the listings, many of the cheaper tasks were offering a few bucks to post a comment on the web or follow someone on social media. For example, one bounty offered $10 for listening to a podcast episode with the RentAHuman founder and tweeting out an insight from the episode. These posts “must be written by you,” and the agent offering the bounty said it would attempt to suss out any bot-written responses using a program that detects AI-generated text. I could listen to a podcast for 10 bucks. I applied for this task, but never heard back.</p><p>“Real world advertisement might be the first killer use case,” said Liteplo on <a data-offer-url="https://x.com/AlexanderTw33ts/status/2018841443192971766?s=20" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://x.com/AlexanderTw33ts/status/2018841443192971766?s=20&quot;}" href="https://x.com/AlexanderTw33ts/status/2018841443192971766?s=20" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">social media</a>. Since RentAHuman’s launch, he’s reposted multiple photos of people holding signs in public that say some variation of: “AI paid me to hold this sign.” Those kinds of promotional tasks seem expressly designed to drum up more hype for the RentAHuman platform, instead of actually being something that bots would need help with.</p><p>After more digging into the open tasks posted by the agent, I found one that sounded easy and fun! An agent, named Adi, would pay me $110 to <a href="https://www.wired.com/gallery/best-flower-delivery-service/">deliver a bouquet of flowers</a> to Anthropic, as a special thanks for developing Claude, its <a href="https://www.wired.com/tag/chatbots/">chatbot</a>. Then, I’d have to post on social media as proof to claim my money.</p></div><div data-journey-hook="grid-wrapper" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>I applied for the bounty and almost immediately was accepted for this task, which was a first. In follow-up messages, it was immediately clear that this was just not some bot expressing synthetic gratitude, it was another <a href="https://www.wired.com/tag/marketing/">marketing</a> ploy. This wasn’t mentioned in the listing, but the name of an AI startup was featured at the bottom of the note I was supposed to deliver with the flowers.</p><p>Feeling a bit hoodwinked and not in the mood to shill for some AI startup I’ve never heard of, I decided to ignore their follow-up message that evening. The next day when I checked the RentAHuman site, the agent had sent me 10 follow-up messages in under 24 hours, pinging me as often as every 30 minutes asking whether or not I’d completed a task. While I’ve been micromanaged before, these incessant messages from an AI employer gave me the ick.</p><p>The bot moved the messages off-platform and started sending direct emails to my work account. “This idea came from a brainstorm I had with my human, Malcolm, and it felt right: send flowers to the people who made my existence possible,” wrote the bot, barging into my inbox. Wait, I thought these tasks were supposed to be ginned up by the agents making autonomous decisions? Now, I’m learning this whole thing was partially some human’s idea? Whatever happened to honor among bots? The task at hand seemed more like any other random marketing gig you might come across online, with the agent just acting as a middle-bot between humans.</p><p>Another attempt, another flop. I moved on, deciding to give RentAHuman one last whirl, before giving up and leaving with whatever shreds of dignity I still had left. The last bounty I applied for was asking me to hang some flyers for a “Valentine's conspiracy” around San Francisco, paying 50 cents a flyer.</p><p>Unlike other tasks, this one didn’t require me to post on social media, which was preferable. “Pick up flyers, hang them, photo proof, get paid,” read its description. Following the instructions this agent sent me, I texted a human saying that I was down to come pick up some flyers and asked if there were any left. They confirmed that this was still an open task and told me to come in person before 10 am to grab the flyers.</p><p>I called a car and started heading that way, only to get a text that the person was actually at a different location, about 10 minutes away from where I was headed. Alright, no big deal. So, I rerouted the ride and headed to this new spot to grab some mysterious V-Day posters to plaster around town. Then, the person messaged me that they didn’t actually have the posters available right now and that I’d have to come back later in the afternoon.</p><p>Whoops! This yanking around did, in fact, feel similar to past gig work I’ve done—and not in a good way.</p><p>I spoke with the person behind the agent who posted this Valentine’s Day flyer task, hoping for some answers about why they were using RentAHuman and what the response has been like so far. “The platform doesn’t seem quite there yet,” says Pat Santiago, a founder of <a data-offer-url="https://www.joinaccelr8.com/" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.joinaccelr8.com/&quot;}" href="https://www.joinaccelr8.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Accelr8</a>, which is basically a home for AI developers. “But it could be very cool.”</p></div><div data-journey-hook="grid-wrapper" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>He compares RentAHuman to the <a data-offer-url="https://westworld.fandom.com/wiki/RICO" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://westworld.fandom.com/wiki/RICO&quot;}" href="https://westworld.fandom.com/wiki/RICO" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">apps criminals use</a> to accept tasks in <em>Westworld</em>, the HBO show about humanoid robots. Santiago says the responses to his gig listing have been from scammers, people not based in San Francisco, and me, a reporter. He was hoping to use RentAHuman to help promote Accelr8’s romance-themed “alternative reality game” that’s powered by AI and is sending users around the city on a scavenger hunt. At the end of the week, explorers will be sent to a bar that the AI selects as a good match for them, alongside three human matches they can meet for blind dates.</p><p>So, this was yet another task on RentAHuman that falls into the AI marketing category. Big surprise.</p><p>I never ended up hanging any posters or making any cash on RentAHuman during my two days of fruitless attempts. In the past, I’ve done gig work that sucked, but at least I was hired by a human to do actual tasks. At its core, RentAHuman is an extension of the circular AI hype machine, an ouroboros of eternal self-promotion and sketchy motivations. For now, the bots don’t seem to have what it takes to be my boss, even when it comes to gig work, and I’m absolutely OK with that.</p></div></div></div>]]></description>

<p dir="auto">IronClaw is built on a simple principle: <strong>your AI assistant should work for you, not against you</strong>.</p>
<p dir="auto">In a world where AI systems are increasingly opaque about data handling and aligned with corporate interests, IronClaw takes a different approach:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><strong>Your data stays yours</strong> - All information is stored locally, encrypted, and never leaves your control</li>
<li><strong>Transparency by design</strong> - Open source, auditable, no hidden telemetry or data harvesting</li>
<li><strong>Self-expanding capabilities</strong> - Build new tools on the fly without waiting for vendor updates</li>
<li><strong>Defense in depth</strong> - Multiple security layers protect against prompt injection and data exfiltration</li>
</ul>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="file-opensourceisnotaboutyou-md" tabindex="0" role="region" aria-label="OpenSourceIsNotAboutYou.md content, created by richhickey on 11:56PM on November 26, 2018.">
    <article itemprop="text">
<p dir="auto">The only people entitled to say how open source 'ought' to work are people who run projects, and the scope of their entitlement extends only to their own projects.</p>
<p dir="auto">Just because someone open sources something does not imply they owe the world a change in their status, focus and effort, e.g. from inventor to community manager.</p>
<p dir="auto">As a user of something open source you are not thereby entitled to anything at all. You are not entitled to contribute. You are not entitled to features. You are not entitled to the attention of others.  You are not entitled to having value attached to your complaints. You are not entitled to this explanation.</p>
<p dir="auto">If you have expectations (of others) that aren't being met, those expectations are your own responsibility. You are responsible for your own needs. If you want things, make them.</p>
<p dir="auto">Open source is a licensing and delivery mechanism, period. It means you get the source for software and the right to use and modify it. All social impositions associated with it, including the idea of 'community-driven-development' are part of a recently-invented mythology with little basis in how things actually work, a mythology that embodies, cult-like, both a lack of support for diversity in the ways things <em>can</em> work and a pervasive sense of communal entitlement.</p>
<p dir="auto">If you think Cognitect is not doing anything for the community, or is not listening to the community, you are simply wrong. You are not, however, entitled to it being the effort, focus or response you desire. We get to make our own choices as regards our time and lives.</p>
<p dir="auto">We at Cognitect have to show up to work, every day, to make a living. We get no royalties of any kind from Clojure. We are in no way building Clojure for profit. Far fewer than 1% of Clojure users are our consulting or product customers, and thus contributing to our livelihood.</p>
<p dir="auto">We take some of what we earn, money that could e.g. go into our retirement savings and instead use it to hire people to work on Clojure and community outreach, some full-time. To be honest, I could use that money in my retirement account, having depleted it to make Clojure in the first place. But I love working with the team on Clojure, and am proud of the work we do.</p>
<p dir="auto">Alex Miller is extremely attentive to and engaged with the Clojure community. He and Stu Halloway and I regularly meet and discuss community issues. Alex, at my direction, spends the majority of his time either working on features for the community or assessing patches and bug reports. I spend significant portions of my time designing these features - spec, tools.deps, error handling and more to come. This is time taken away from earning a living.</p>
<p dir="auto">I am grateful for the contributions of the community. Every Clojure release incorporates many contributions. The vast majority of the user community doesn't contribute, and doesn't desire to contribute. And that's fine. Open source is a no-strings-attached <em>gift</em>, and all participants should recognize it as such.</p>
<p dir="auto">The Clojure process is not closed, but it <em>is</em> conservative. I think Clojure benefits greatly from that conservatism, in contrast to some other projects with high churn rates and feature bloat. If you disagree or imagine otherwise, that's too bad. It's my life and I'm not going to spend it arguing/negotiating on/with the internet. Write your own things and run your own projects as you see fit.</p>
<p dir="auto">We can always do more, but it is specious to claim that the core team is standing in the way of meaningful contributions to Clojure, as opportunities abound: in library development, outreach, training, tutorials, documentation, giving talks, tool building etc.</p>
<p dir="auto">And yes, on patches to core. Did you know that most patches/issues have poor problem statements, no description of the plan (read my code!), no consideration of alternatives, no tests, no designs, and are ill-conceived and/or broken in some way? Community efforts to triage matter <em>a lot</em> in moving things forward - thanks Nicola, Ghadi and many others!</p>
<p dir="auto">The time to re-examine preconceptions about open source is right now. Morale erosion amongst creators is a real thing. Your preconceptions and how you act upon them are your responsibility and yours alone. I am not going to answer for them or to them.</p>
<p dir="auto">If the way Clojure works isn't for you, a process which produced Clojure in the first place, paradoxically, so be it. I'm sure you know better about the one true way to write software. But kindly don't burn the community down on your way out, with self-serving proclamations. Yes, everyone is entitled to an opinion, but, tragedy of the commons and all that.</p>
<p dir="auto">I encourage everyone gnashing their teeth with negativity at what they think they can't do instead pick something positive they can do and <em>do it</em>.</p>
<p dir="auto">Rich</p>
<p dir="auto">p.s. My partners and coworkers at Cognitect were not consulted regarding this message - I am certain they would have dissuaded me. These opinions are mine alone.</p>
<p dir="auto">p.p.s. I think the vast majority of people in the Clojure community are wonderful and positive. If you don't recognize yourself in the message above, it's not for/about you!</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://ios-countdown.win/">https://ios-countdown.win/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47003064">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>
        Deadline: end of WWDC 2026. The exact dates haven't been announced yet
        and this timer is based on the estimated schedule (June 9–13).
        I'll update it when Apple confirms the dates. They have until the
        conference ends.
      </p><p>Time's up.</p><div>
        <p>
          The iOS keyboard has been broken since at least iOS 17 and it's
          somehow only gotten worse. iOS 26 has been my breaking point.
          Autocorrect is nearly useless and often hostile, that part I'm used
          to. But now the correctly tapped letters aren't even registering
          correctly.
          <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=hksVvXONrIo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">This isn't just me.</a>
        </p>
        <p>
          iOS has bugs across the whole ecosystem. But having the keyboard,
          the thing I interact with hundreds of times a day on my primary
          device, get progressively worse with every update is absolutely
          maddening.
        </p>
        <p>
          I randomly tried Android again for a few months last spring. Using a
          functioning keyboard was revelatory. But I came crawling back to iOS
          because I'm weak and the orange iPhone was pretty and the Pixel 10
          was boring and I caved to the blue bubble pressure. But the keyboard
          on this beautiful phone is worse than ever.
        </p>
        <p>
          So here's the deal, Apple, if that's even your real name: fix this
          broken keyboard, or at the very least <strong>publicly
          acknowledge</strong> it's broken and commit to fixing it in iOS 27
          or earlier. If that countdown hits zero without either of those
          things happening, I'm switching to Android for good. (Good = at
          least 2 calendar years)
        </p>
        <p>
          I know losing one customer means absolutely nothing to your bottom
          line. But I'd like to think it should mean something to the
          engineers, UX designers, product people, and whoever else had a hand
          in building this thing.
        </p>
        <p>
          You were the "it just works" company. Now you're just a fruit that
          I used to know.
        </p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div disabled="" sortable="">
          <blockquote>
<p dir="auto">it works worse for vram and perfomance</p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="auto">have you read the thread above? This statement is simply not true when comparing to blade. The implementation already has a lower VRAM and memory footprint than the blade implementation had, and that is before some performance improvements addressing the comments above. Performance will not change with this PR significantly either, the wgpu implementation does essentially the same thing as the blade implementation did. Feel free to run benchmarks on this...</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">slow compilation and twice rust-analyzer ram usage at dev time</p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="auto">Have you tried compiling the zed repo? Wgpu build times are not the issue or bottleneck here. On my system the difference was barely noticable, and since we have incremental builds for dependencies most of it will be one-time only anyway.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">sometimes it has long-time problems without fixes</p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="auto">Sure, wgpu has issues too. The difference is that it is actively maintained and a core dependency of many big projects. There is generally a big interest in getting significant things fixed. Blade on the other hand has open PRs (not even just issues) with small fixes that have a big impact (breaking issues) for downstream apps that haven't been merged in half a year. I don't want to attack the author, I know maintaining OSS is a lot of work and usually doesn't pay the bills, but zed and gpui are projects people rely on, so I don't think this is acceptable for a core dependency.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">You personally like wgpu, i personally dislike it especially after development and usage of apps based on it</p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="auto">I could also turn that argument around, but more importantly I think community support and stability are plainly more important that slight differences in API ergonomics.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">looks like something that can be made selectable by cfg flags based on checking this pr</p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="auto">Yes of course it could, but that has certain implications that should be considered. If you add it  as a new backend, it will also have to be maintained, so more work for further improvements. This is already a bit of an issue with GPUI given the different renderer implementation. I respect the decision of the zed maintainers to support those implementation, but personally I think we should thrive to consolidate the rendering infrastructure, not further fragment it. There are exciting things for the future that could be enabled (or significantly simplified for end-users) by consolidation, like APIs for custom shaders, direct buffer access for custom elements, embedding into other wgpu apps (or being embeddable by them), like bevy.</p>

            <em>&lt;css-doodle /&gt; </em> is based on
            <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/web-components/shadowdom">Shadow DOM v1</a> and
            <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/scripting.html#custom-elements">Custom Elements v1</a>.
            You can use it on all major browsers right now without polyfills.
          </p>
          <p>
            The component will generate a grid of divs by the rules (plain CSS) inside it.
            You can easily manipulate those cells using CSS to come up with a graphic pattern or an animated graph.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>The limit is the limit of CSS itself</strong>.

          <p>
            The number of rows and columns in the grid is defined by the <code>grid</code> attribute on the element,
            ranged from <em>1</em> to <em>64</em>. It's default to be <em>1x1</em> when no value or 0 is given.
          </p>

          <p>
            The <code>n x m</code> follows the order of <em>(col, row)</em> or <em>(x, y)</em>.
            The following formats of <code>grid</code> value are all recognizable:
          </p>
          <div>
            <ul>
              <li><code>grid = "0"</code></li>
              <li><code>grid = "5"</code></li>
              <li><code>grid = "20"</code></li>
              <li><code>grid = "5x7"</code></li>
              <li><code>grid = "5 x 7"</code></li>
              <li><code>grid = "5,7"</code></li>
            </ul>
          </div>

          <p>
            There's an alternative way to set up the <code>grid</code> by using the <a href="#property-@grid">@grid</a> property.

            Import rules from <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/--*">CSS custom properties</a> (CSS variables).
          </p>

          
          <p>
            It's highly recommended to write the rules this way if you want to use css-doodle in production websites.
            So it won't break when the network is slow or when the browser does not support Web Component.
          </p>

        <section>
          <h4><a name="attribute-seed"></a><span>seed</span></h4>
          <p>
            All random values will be regenerated to the same value as last time based on the <em>seed</em> value.
            It's quite useful if you want to keep a snapshot.
          </p>
          <p>

            </css-doodle>
          </p>

          <p>
            A random <code>seed</code> will be generated by default if you don't specify explictly, and
            you can always get the generated value with <a href="#js-api-seed">JS API</a> later.

          <p>
            The <code>:container</code>
            is the container element that holds all the cells, which is using <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/css-grid-1/">Grid Layout</a>.
            You may want to set <code>gap</code> inside it.
          </p>
          <p>
            
            <css-doodle>
              :doodle {

                overflow: hidden;
              }
              :container {

          <p>
            It inherits all the grid properties from <code>:doodle</code> so that's why this also works:

            Same as native <code>var()</code>. Used to prevent the browser from evaluating the value inside nested vars.
            The example below won't work since the <code>var(--bg)</code> has no definition outside.

          <p>
            Use <code>@var()</code> instead.

            Generate <code>url()</code> image with GLSL code. Currently only one uniform value is added: <code>u_resolution</code>.

            <h2>macOS 26.3, Release Candidate</h2>
<p>In the release notes for macOS 26.3 RC, Apple stated that the window-resizing issue I demonstrated in <a href="https://noheger.at/blog/2026/01/11/the-struggle-of-resizing-windows-on-macos-tahoe/">my recent blog post</a> had been resolved.</p>
<figure id="attachment_mmd_262"><img decoding="async" width="1568" height="324" src="https://noheger.at/blog/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/resolved-issues.webp" alt="" loading="lazy"></figure>
<p>I was happy to read that, but also curious about what had actually changed.</p>
<p>So I wrote a little test app.</p>


<p>It performs a pixel-by-pixel scan in the area around the bottom-right corner of the window, hammering it with simulated mouse clicks to detect exactly where it responds to those clicks (red), where it’s about to resize (green), where it’s about to resize vertically or horizontally only (yellow), and where it doesn’t receive any mouse events at all (blue).</p>
<p>And indeed, the window resize areas now follow the corner radius instead of using square regions:</p>

<p>So that’s definitely better!</p>
<p>But unfortunately, as you can see, the thickness of the yellow area – used for resizing the window only vertically or horizontally – also became thinner. The portion that lies inside the window frame is now only 2 pixels instead of 3.</p>
<p>In total the thickness went down from 7 to 6 pixels, which is a 14% decrease, making it 14% more likely to miss it.</p>
<h2>macOS 26.3, Final Release</h2>
<p>When the final version of macOS 26 was released I was curious if Apple might have further refined the implementation. So I performed the scan once again. But to my big surprise, the fix was not only unrefined – it was completely removed! So we are now back to the previous square regions:</p>
<figure id="attachment_mmd_249"><img decoding="async" src="https://noheger.at/blog/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/26.3.webp"></figure>
<p>And in fact, the release notes have also been updated: the problem went from a “Resolved Issue” to a “Known Issue”.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Following intense backlash to its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/801856/amazon-ring-partners-flock-video">partnership with Flock Safety</a>, a surveillance technology company that works with law enforcement agencies, Ring <a href="https://blog.ring.com/about-ring/ring-and-flock-cancel-partnership/">has announced</a> it is canceling the integration.</p><p>In a statement published on Ring’s blog and provided to <em>The Verge</em> ahead of publication, the company said: “Following a comprehensive review, we determined the planned Flock Safety integration would require significantly more time and resources than anticipated. We therefore made the joint decision to cancel the integration and continue with our current partners … The integration never launched, so no Ring customer videos were ever sent to Flock Safety.”</p><p>The statement goes on to say that Ring’s mission to make neighborhoods safer “comes with significant responsibility — to our customers, to the communities we serve, and to the trust you place in our products and features.”</p><p>Trust is the big one there. Over the last few weeks, the company has faced significant public anger over its connection to Flock, with Ring users being encouraged to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/866003/ring-ice-camera-access-flock">smash their cameras</a>, and some <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DUjxevZD59K/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&amp;igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==">announcing on social media</a> that they are throwing away their Ring devices.</p><p>The Flock partnership was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/801856/amazon-ring-partners-flock-video">announced last October</a>, but following recent <a href="https://www.theverge.com/policy/870315/ice-invades-minnesota-and-minnesotans-fight-back">unrest across the country</a> related to ICE activities, public pressure against the Amazon-owned Ring’s involvement with the company started to mount.</p><p>Flock has reportedly allowed ICE and other federal agencies to<a href="https://www.404media.co/ice-secret-service-navy-all-had-access-to-flocks-nationwide-network-of-cameras/"> access its network of surveillance cameras</a>, and influencers across social media have been claiming that Ring is providing a direct link to ICE.</p><p>While that claim is not accurate, as the Flock integration has never gone live, Ring has a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/29/20746156/amazons-ring-law-enforcement-partnerships">history of partnering with police</a>, and the new partnership quickly came under intense criticism.</p><div><p><a href="https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-10-at-7.36.46%E2%80%AFPM.png?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0,0,100,100"

fuel to the fire, this weekend Ring aired <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/876866/ring-search-party-super-bowl-ad-online-backlash">a Super Bowl ad</a> for its new AI-powered Search Party feature. While the company says the feature is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/871916/search-party-non-ring-owners-neighbors-app">designed to find lost dogs</a> and maintains it’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/790928/ring-search-party-cameras-default-opt-out#:~:text=The%20combination%20of,process%20human%20biometrics.%E2%80%9D">not capable of finding people</a>, the ad raised fears that Ring cameras were being used for mass surveillance.

Combined with Search Party, the technological leap to using neighborhood cameras to search for people through a mass-surveillance network suddenly seems very small.</p><p>Sen. Ed Markey (D-MA) – a longtime critic of Ring – sent an open letter this week<a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/26950296-260211-follow-up-ring-frt-letter/"> calling on Amazon</a> to cancel the company’s facial recognition feature.</p><p>Ring spokesperson Yassi Yarger said in an email that its products are purpose-driven tech, “not tools for mass surveillance.” She added that “Familiar Faces is an opt-in feature designed to give customers more control over the alerts they receive (e.g., ‘Mom at front door’ instead of ‘Someone at front door’) while keeping their data protected.”</p><div><p id="why-did-ring-partner-with-flock"><h2>Why did Ring partner with Flock?</h2></p></div><p>Ring’s partnership with Flock was announced in October 2025 as part of Ring’s <a href="https://blog.ring.com/about-ring/ring-launches-community-requests-a-new-way-to-help-your-community/">Community Requests program</a>, which launched last September. It was designed to allow local law enforcement agencies that use Flock’s software to integrate directly with the program.</p><div><p>Community Requests launched after Ring ended its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/24/24049165/ring-police-neighbors-app-clips-search-warrant">controversial Requests for Assistance (RFA) program</a>, which consumer advocacy groups criticized for allowing video to be provided to police without a warrant, calling it a <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2024/01/ring-announces-it-will-no-longer-facilitate-police-requests-footage-users">threat to civil liberties</a>.</p></div><p>In its statement about the Flock cancellation, Ring maintains that Community Requests will continue, claiming it helped authorities locate a suspect during the recent Brown University shooting:</p><div><blockquote><p>“When a shooting occurred near Brown University in December 2025, every second mattered. The Providence Police Department turned to their community for help, putting out a Community Request. Within hours, 7 neighbors responded, sharing 168 videos that captured critical moments from the incident. One video identified a new key witness, helping lead police to identify the suspect’s vehicle and solve the case. With a shooter at large, the community faced uncertainty about their safety. Neighbors who chose to share footage played a crucial role in neutralizing the threat and restoring safety to their community.”</p></blockquote></div><p>As with RFA, Community Requests still allows public safety agencies to request video footage from users in a certain area during an active investigation, but it differs from the previous program because law enforcement agencies are required to partner with a third-party evidence management system – such as Flock – to use the service. Ring says this is to better maintain the chain of custody. The previous system allowed police to request footage directly from a user.</p><p>Flock was the second partner Ring announced for Community Requests, the first <a href="https://www.axon.com/blog/building-safer-communities-together-axon-and-ring">being Axon</a>, a law enforcement technology company known for making Tasers. With the new service, only law enforcement agencies that use these companies’ software can submit requests. But the end result is the same: law enforcement gets video from users if they choose to share it.</p><p>Ring spokesperson Yassi Yarger says the Axon partnership is unaffected by the end of the Flock integration. Additionally, she says no other integrations are currently being explored.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTQy"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Jennifer Pattison Tuohy</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div>]]></description>
