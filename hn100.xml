When I read “CFD” I always think of computational fluid dynamics and so “CFD gambling” sounds pretty cool to me. Obviously I do know I’m just overfitting to a TLA and I’d like to know what it <i>actually</i> means.

It slipping through into your results isn't so much plain neglect as it is an arms race that Apple is on the losing side of this time.</p><p>Robust algorithmic ranking and moderation at scale is a myth, though, and you can find this happen pretty much everywhere.

<a href="https://streamable.com/y5nhy7" rel="nofollow">https://streamable.com/y5nhy7</a><p>&gt; You can't escape personal due diligence and "it was top ranked!" has never been that.</p><p>On one hand that's a fair point and I should've known better. OTOH I think it is legit to trust top app store search results to return quality apps, especially if there is a massive disparity between their quality. The scam app has obvious repetitive spam reviews. The developer's website is terrible and the submit button doesn't even work. This is basic quality control on apple's part. If every single app store user needs to manually vet every single app they install to the proper extent there would be a fraction of a fraction of the installs and respectively, a fraction of a fraction of the revenue.</p><p>Consider the extent of lawsuits between apple and companies with app store apps - does it not strike you that apple protects that revenue stream? Wouldn't it make sense to give app store users a sense of trust in the top search results?

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article lang="en">
  

  
  

  <div>
  <p>“The Netherlands hosts some of the world’s largest internet exchanges. This obliges us to make the best use of these exchanges for our national security. With the Temporary Cyber Act, we will make optimum use of the data carried on our cables to protect The Netherlands against Russian and Chinese hackers” – <a href="https://www.rijksoverheid.nl/actueel/nieuws/2024/03/12/inlichtingendiensten-kunnen-sneller-en-beter-optreden-tegen-cyberdreiging">Dutch government announcement</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I wrote this earlier, but did not publish it then because I wasn’t happy with the post. However, since <a href="https://www.rijksoverheid.nl/actueel/nieuws/2024/03/12/inlichtingendiensten-kunnen-sneller-en-beter-optreden-tegen-cyberdreiging">the new Dutch Intelligence and Security act just passed</a>, it is relevant for an international audience. Earlier, I wrote a piece for <a href="https://berthub.eu/articles/posts/dutch-intel-law-about-intel/">about:intel</a>, and in there you can find further discussion in English.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Of specific note, this law vastly expands when the Dutch agencies can perform SIGINT on Dutch Internet Exchanges like the Amsterdam Internet Exchange. These powers extend to any form of communication, including private peering and Private Network Interconnects (PNI). Every cable must be made available for ’exploration’, and it is likely that due to the wording in the new law, any request for such examination will be granted by the commission that rules on these things. Such exploration includes the right to send data to foreign intelligence agencies, including non-European ones.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Secondly, the law also makes it clear that requests for full intercepts should now mostly be judged on technical terms (‘is the request complete’) and with much less emphasis of the merits of full SIGINT. But do read on for the details.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Today, the upper house of Dutch parliament passed a law to reduce (I think) the oversight on the Dutch intelligence and security services, while simultaneously granting them more leeway to execute their powers. <a href="https://berthub.eu/articles/posts/resignation-as-intelligence-regulator/">In 2022, I resigned as regulator of the Dutch intelligence and security services because of this attempt</a>. Politico.eu wrote <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/intelligence-watchdog-bert-hubert-netherlands-hacking-cyber-law/">a comprehensive article</a> about it, representing various points of view.</p>
<p>In this page I will try to explain how the new law works and what these changes mean. I also provide some context from the European Court of Human Rights<!-- and the EU Court of Justice-->. This page refers to the just passed version of the proposed legislation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There is also a <a href="https://berthub.eu/articles/posts/uitleg-over-de-wiv-2/">far longer page in Dutch</a>. This post is an attempt to summarise the changes for an international audience.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="applicability">Applicability</h2>
<p>The Dutch Law on Intelligence and Security Services defines a broad set of powers. It is also a somewhat odd law with a long history.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An English translation of a 2016 draft of the law <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/growth/tools-databases/tris/index.cfm/en/search/?trisaction=search.detail&amp;year=2016&amp;num=188&amp;dLang=EN">can be found on the European Commission website</a>. Note that this is a draft and it definitely differs from <a href="https://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBR0039896">the law that is in force (Dutch)</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A remarkable aspect of the law is that it is universally applicable - it extends as much powers to spy on Dutch people as those from other countries. There are no general protections for people from or in The Netherlands or in the EU. This stands in stark contrast to US legislation which provides some privacy protection to ‘US Persons’, but to no one else.</p>
<p>In addition, the powers can be used around the world - Dutch agencies are free to hack computers anywhere, or to intercept communications anywhere.</p>
<h2 id="interests">Interests</h2>
<p>The services can investigate anything or anyone that gives rise to the suspicion that their activities or goals might be harmful for the survival of the system of democratic rule of law, for security or other important interests of the state. In addition, the services can investigate other countries.</p>
<h2 id="powers">Powers</h2>
<p>The powers granted to the services are broad, but also largely ‘read-only’. The services do not operate drones (unlike the CIA), and they have limited powers to intervene or disturb things, with one exception.</p>
<ul>
<li>Article 40: Observing and following people and objects</li>
<li>Article 41: Operate &amp; instruct agents, who are allowed to break other laws under specific conditions</li>
<li>Article 42: Enter &amp; investigate closed objects and premises</li>
<li>Article 43: Collect, store and match DNA data from people</li>
<li>Article 44: Intercept and investigate physical post and packages</li>
<li>Article 45: Hack ‘automated works’, computers in the very broadest sense of the word</li>
<li>Article 47: Intercept any form of (tele)communications from a specific person, organization of technical identifier</li>
<li>Article 48: Intercept &amp; record whole cables</li>
<li>Article 49: Investigate data recorded under article 48 to find targets or technical identifiers</li>
<li>Article 50: Select part of the data recorded under article 48 for use in intelligence/security investigations</li>
<li>Article 54: Requisitioning data</li>
<li>Article 60: Perform automated analysis and “machine learning” on all data, including 48 data</li>
<li>Article 73: “Undertake measures to protect interests of the services”</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="subjects-of-these-powers">Subjects of these powers</h2>
<p>The law is somewhat unique that all these powers are only tied to the <em>interests</em> the services protect, and not to specific people. So unlike police forces, the services can spy not only on direct targets of investigation, they can also eavesdrop ’non-targets’ (who might know interesting things about targets) or even hack ’third parties’ that could function as a stepping stone to useful information.</p>
<p>Before the services can use their investigatory powers on non-targets or third parties, they do have to explain why this is the only way for an investigation to proceed.</p>
<h2 id="oversight-warrant-process">Oversight, warrant process</h2>
<p>For all of the powers, there must be internal sign-off. Depending on the nature, this sign-off can be mandated to lower ranking employees. The most infringing powers however need to be approved by the relevant minister. Then, the <a href="https://tib-ivd.nl/">ex-ante regulator</a> rules if this permission was obtained lawfully. The minister takes the political decision, the ex-ante regulator verifies this decision. The opinion of the ex-ante regulator is binding.</p>
<p>In addition, there is <a href="https://ctivd.nl/">a non-binding ex-post regulator</a>.</p>
<h2 id="administrative-warrant-extensions">Administrative warrant extensions</h2>
<p>The powers are available for use on people or organizations. If someone turns out to have an additional phone number, or starts using a different phone number, a warrant can administratively be updated with this new information. No new permission process is required. In addition, if a warrant was written to target an organization, if this organization was described well, newly discovered members of the organization can also be added to a warrant administratively.</p>
<p>Crucially, such administrative extensions can not be used to add non-targets or third parties - these can not have been a member of a well described organization.</p>
<h2 id="sigint">SIGINT</h2>
<p>The SIGINT or bulk interception powers are complicated. The intelligence and security law considers that the copying, collecting and storing of data is a lesser infringement than actually looking at the data. This is in line with recent European Court of Human Rights precedents. The infringement of privacy increases at every step of the intelligence process, from collection to storing to selecting relevant communications to exploiting such communications for intelligence/security purposes. Crucially however, merely intercepting and storing data is already an infringement that needs a justification.</p>
<p>Article 48 provides for the collection powers. Services need to describe why a specific cable is interesting, and what they expect to achieve with that data. They must also use a well-targeted cable, one that is expected to best provide the data the services are interested in. There are also some restrictions on traffic with origin and destination in The Netherlands.</p>
<p>Article 49 enables technical analysis of this data to see if it includes interesting targets or subjects. Article 50 meanwhile allows for the selection of communications for dissemination to intelligence teams.</p>
<p>Finally, with specific permission, article 60 allows for the algorithmic analysis of all data intercepted under article 48. It was not found possible to properly limit what “algorithmic analysis” might be, so this was left to the ex-ante regulator to determine. In an adversarial reading, “finding all email from a specific person” might be dressed up as an algorithmic analysis. This means article 60 could be an alternative to article 50, and thus it needs the same level of regulatory scrutiny.</p>
<h2 id="proposed-changes">Proposed changes</h2>
<p>In the proposed additional ‘cyber law’, several things would change:</p>
<ul>
<li>The non-binding ex-post regulator gets binding oversight powers on select capabilities. To actually stop an operation involves a heavyweight procedure which can also be stayed. In addition, the regulator needs a lot of new highly technical staff which has been hard to find.</li>
<li>Hacking operations no longer need to detail plans or technical risks to the regulator. These risks include the leaking of ‘zero days’, or damaging non-target or third party services. In addition, technical risk includes the possibility that the facilities installed by the services could be abused by yet other services or hackers.</li>
<li>Hacking operations no longer need to be tied to specific groups of people or organizations. It will become possible to hack into generic companies, for example to enable the retrieval of phone location data in the future. For such strategic hacks on infrastructure, no technical risks need to be described to the regulator.</li>
<li>Services gain the power to intercept and store any cable for a year, no matter where it leads to, and also store the data for a year. No justification needs to be given for this exploration beyond that there is an interest in figuring out what traffic a cable carries. Data collected under this article may be investigated for a whole year, but (crucially!) not for any other purpose than finding targets. Such exploratory data can be shared with foreign and non-EU intelligence agencies.</li>
<li>In addition, the article 48 powers can now be applied based solely on ‘indications’ what the technical plans are with this data. The regulators are instructed to mostly only study these indications, to the detriment of proportionality, subsidiarity and ‘as targeted as possible’ requirements. The indications are non-binding and the services have the liberty to do other things during the year if they need to. <strong>In effect, regulators do not have a lot left to regulate with this change</strong>.</li>
<li>The administrative permissionless extension of warrants is extended to <em>NON-TARGETS</em>. This means that if a hacker group is being targeted, warrants for eavesdropping, hacking, requisitioning are automatically extended to the <em>victims</em> of those hackers as well. This means that the additional test that used to apply to non-targets is no longer required, and instead, non-targets now get less protection than targets (!).</li>
<li>Algorithmic analysis on bulk intercepted data no longer needs regulatory approval. Since it is not well described what this automated analysis entails, this is a large expansion of powers that are not regulated up front. The European Court of Human Rights argues explicitly that such automated analysis needs safeguards (see below)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="some-context">Some context</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://hudoc.echr.coe.int/eng?i=001-210077">CASE OF BIG BROTHER WATCH AND OTHERS v. THE UNITED KINGDOM</a> - with particular attention to:
<ul>
<li>“330. The Court considers that Article 8 applies at each of the above stages. While the initial interception followed by the immediate discarding of parts of the communications does not constitute a particularly significant interference, the degree of interference with individuals’ Article 8 rights will increase as the bulk interception process progresses. In this regard, the Court has clearly stated that even the mere storing of data relating to the private life of an individual amounts to an interference within the meaning of Article 8 (see Leander v. Sweden, 26 March 1987, § 48, Series A no. 116), and that <strong>the need for safeguards will be all the greater where the protection of personal data undergoing automatic processing is concerned</strong> (see S. and Marper, cited above, § 103). The fact that the stored material is in coded form, intelligible only with the use of computer technology and capable of being interpreted only by a limited number of persons, can have no bearing on that finding (see Amann v. Switzerland [GC], no. 27798/95, § 69, ECHR 2000‑II and S. and Marper, cited above, §§ 67 and 75).”</li>
</ul>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Happy 2024! Last year was a big year for our team: we joined Amazon in August,
and by November, we had already shipped
<a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codewhisperer/latest/userguide/command-line-getting-started-installing.html">Amazon CodeWhisperer for command line</a>.</p><p>We’re keenly aware of the impact generative AI is having on the way developers
build. We’re hard at work innovating and we have a lot of exciting new things
coming to CodeWhisperer for command line later this year. With that said, we
have decided to fully focus our efforts on these new features, and given that,
we will be sunsetting Fig on September 1, 2024.</p><p>We will continue supporting Fig until September 1. Until then, we encourage
users to migrate over to
<a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codewhisperer/latest/userguide/command-line-getting-started-installing.html">CodeWhisperer for command line</a>.
To make this transition as easy as possible, users can upgrade to CodeWhisperer
for command line directly from the Fig dashboard (more below).</p><h3 id="whats-the-difference-between-fig-and-codewhisperer-for-the-command-line"><a href="#whats-the-difference-between-fig-and-codewhisperer-for-the-command-line">What’s the difference between Fig and CodeWhisperer for the command line?</a></h3><p><a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codewhisperer/latest/userguide/command-line-getting-started-installing.html">CodeWhisperer for command line</a>
offers Fig’s core features including 1) IDE-style completions for 500+ CLIs
and 2) natural language-to-bash translation. It’s free on the Individual tier
and is designed to be faster and more reliable than Fig. We have several
exciting new CodeWhisperer for command line features coming in 2024 including
support for Linux, AI chat, inline AI completions, autocomplete in SSH, and
private autocomplete.</p><p>CodeWhisperer for command line does not include features similar to Fig Scripts,
Dotfiles, Plugins, or Servers and we do not plan to support these features any
time soon.</p><h3 id="how-do-i-migrate"><a href="#how-do-i-migrate">How do I migrate?</a></h3><p>The Fig Dashboard UI will handle the migration for you — it takes just a few
minutes. The migration process exports your data to your local device, installs
CodeWhisperer for command line, transfers your settings, then uninstalls Fig.
Once the CodeWhisperer app is installed, you will be prompted to grant macOS
accessibility permissions and then login or sign up.</p><p><strong>Note</strong>: You will need to be on v2.18 to see the new Fig Dashboard UI.</p><h3 id="what-happens-to-my-data"><a href="#what-happens-to-my-data">What happens to my data?</a></h3><p>Fig will delete all user data on September 1. Users can export their data to
their local device any time before then by running <code>fig export</code>. The Fig to
CodeWhisperer migration flow will automatically do this for users.</p><h3 id="can-i-use-fig-and-codewhisperer-for-command-line-together"><a href="#can-i-use-fig-and-codewhisperer-for-command-line-together">Can I use Fig and CodeWhisperer for command line together?</a></h3><p>Yes! Before Fig is sunset you can use Fig and CodeWhisperer at the same time.
When both tools are installed, Fig’s Autocomplete feature will turn off in favor
of CodeWhisperer for command line. This means you can keep using Fig for
Scripts, Dotfiles, Plugins, and Servers until September 1st but start using
CodeWhisperer for command line for its more reliable CLI completions and AI
straight away.</p><p>If you have any questions about the migration, please just create a discussion
in our
<a href="https://github.com/withfig/fig/issues/new?assignees=&amp;labels=&amp;projects=&amp;template=1_general_question.md">public community</a>.</p><h3 id="thank-you"><a href="#thank-you">Thank you</a></h3><p>To all Fig’s users, customers, and contributors, we are incredibly grateful for
your feedback, contributions, and support over the years. We are thrilled to
have made such an impact and we are beyond excited to continue working with you
all while we continue to ship!</p><p>Brendan, Matt, and the Amazon CodeWhisperer for command line team.</p></section></div>]]></description>

<p dir="auto">A program to explore how Mandelbrot set images are affected by floating point precision.</p>

Boost::Multiprecision may be easily replaced by other floating-point or rational implementations, like GiMP or GMPF by just changing the <code>#include</code>s and <code>typedef</code>s at the beginning.</p>

<p dir="auto">How much is a Mandelbrot set image affected by the floating point precision of the code used to compute it?</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>The points in a region of a Mandelbrot set image have <em>sensitive dependence upon initial conditions.</em>  (This property is the "chaos" in "chaos theory.")  A small deviation in the value of C in Z=Z^2+C can lead to a very different outcome for one point versus another point that is only a miniscule distance from it.  This fact remains true at all scales of magnification, i.e., "miniscule" can be arbitrarily small.</li>
<li>Floating point math cannot perfectly represent many rational numbers.  Moreover, floating point math can generate inaccuracies that can snowball with repeated calculations, including repeated operations of multiplication and addition.  Repeated multiplication and addition are the core of the Mandelbrot set algorithm.</li>
<li>Since the Mandelbrot set is always generated on a computer, typically using floating point math of some precision or other, we ask: How much of a Mandelbrot set image's visual complexity is due to the mathematical properties of the algorithm, and how much is due to floating point inaccuracies in its computer calculation?  Could some of the familiar visual properties of the Mandelbrot set simply be "noise" introduced by floating point calculations that have iterated thousands or even millions of times?</li>

<p dir="auto">A 2013 academic paper, <a href="https://mathr.co.uk/blog/2018-08-20_trustworthy_fractals.html" rel="nofollow">"Images of Julia Sets That You Can Trust" </a>, by L. H. de Figueiredo, D.

<p dir="auto">For a more detailed statement of the problem and the design of this program, <a href="https://github.com/ProfJski/FloatCompMandelbrot/blob/master/FloatCompMset.md">read the more detailed analysis here</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">My Solution in a Nutshell</h2><a id="user-content-my-solution-in-a-nutshell" aria-label="Permalink: My Solution in a Nutshell" href="#my-solution-in-a-nutshell"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">I wrote easy-to-modify c++ code that simply uses <code>typedef</code> to allow the user to explore the Mandelbrot set and to compare how the Mandelbrot set image looks when generated using the <em>same parameters</em> on the <em>same points</em>, but using three different floating-point implementations to calculate the result.  In addition to standard <code>float</code> and <code>double</code> types, the <code>Boost::Multiprecision</code> <a href="https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_79_0/libs/multiprecision/doc/html/boost_multiprecision/tut/floats/cpp_bin_float.html" rel="nofollow">cpp_bin_float</a> class was used to implement extended-precision floating-point types of the user's choice.</p>
<p dir="auto">The program is multi-threaded so it generates the desired Mandelbrot set image in all three float types simultaneously.  Keys <code>&lt;1&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;2&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;3&gt;</code> display the image as generated by the three different types of floating point precision that the user has selected.  Keys <code>&lt;4&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;5&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;6&gt;</code> <em>subtract pairs of images</em> to highlight any pixels that are different:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><code>Key &lt;4&gt;</code> -- Subtracts image 1 from 2</li>
<li><code>Key &lt;5&gt;</code> -- Subtracts image 1 from 3</li>
<li><code>Key &lt;6&gt;</code> -- Subtracts image 2 from 3</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Green pixels indicate a positive value following the subtraction, red pixels a negative value.
Basic statistics of the comparison are given in console output, such as the total number of pixels that are different, the percentage of the total image that is different, and the greatest difference between the values of the pixels (which tends to be close to the max iterations that one has selected for the Mandelbrot algorithm).  The console output also prints basic information about the three types one has chosen at start-up, such as digits of precision.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">An Example</h3><a id="user-content-an-example" aria-label="Permalink: An Example" href="#an-example"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Here are some sample images from a zoom in the neighborhood of C = -0.104943 + 0.927572i. Magnification is approximately 33E+6. The distance between adjacent pixels is 1/(2^33).  Max iterations is 30K.  Here's the image generated with standard <code>double</code> (53 bits of precision):</p>

<p dir="auto">Here is the same image generated with <code>cpp_bin_float_quad</code> (113 bits of precision).  Superficially it looks largely the same:</p>
<p dir="auto"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/ProfJski/FloatCompMandelbrot/blob/master/images/Set3-CppQuad.png"><img src="https://github.com/ProfJski/FloatCompMandelbrot/raw/master/images/Set3-CppQuad.png" alt="Quad float"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">But upon subtraction, we find that 8.77% ofthe pixels are different!  92,007 out of 1,048,576 pixels have different values.  These differences include points estimated to be in the Mandelbrot Set in one image and not in the other, as well as points which exceeded the orbit boundary check (i.e., the magnitude of Z &gt; 2) in both images but at different iterations.  Here's what we get when we subtract the Quad image from the Double precision image and color-code the difference:</p>
<p dir="auto"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/ProfJski/FloatCompMandelbrot/blob/master/images/Set3-QuadMinusDouble.png"><img src="https://github.com/ProfJski/FloatCompMandelbrot/raw/master/images/Set3-QuadMinusDouble.png" alt="Difference"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Green pixels are where Quad &gt; Double; red pixels are where Double &gt; Quad.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Four Screen View</h3><a id="user-content-four-screen-view" aria-label="Permalink: Four Screen View" href="#four-screen-view"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Press <code>Key &lt;7&gt;</code> with the mouse over a pixel in screen views 1, 2 or 3 to trigger Four-Screen view.  Top left and right are float types 1 and 2.  Bottom left is the difference between them.  The bottom right screen displays the trajectory of the point against the background of the whole Mandelbrot set.  The first float type is plotted in blue, the second in red, the third in yellow.  This allows you to see how different floating point implementations lead to different trajectories, which lead to different final values for a single point in the image.</p>
<p dir="auto"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/ProfJski/FloatCompMandelbrot/blob/master/images/DiffOrbitsFloatDoubleQuad.png"><img src="https://github.com/ProfJski/FloatCompMandelbrot/raw/master/images/DiffOrbitsFloatDoubleQuad.png" alt="Four Screen View"></a></p>

<p dir="auto">Press <code>Key &lt;8&gt;</code> to see the trajectory screen by itself.  In this display mode, the background remains that of the zoomed-in image, rather than the whole Mandelbrot set, but the screen coordinates of the trajectories are still (-2-2i) to (2+2i).  Leaving the background image of the zoomed-in fractal better allows you to select a point where trajectories clearly diverge, which are often near the edges of the set or other high-chaos areas.</p>

<p dir="auto">The three floating point types are <code>typedef</code>ed as <code>first_float</code>, <code>second_float</code> and <code>third_float</code> throughout the code.  Variable names also have these names as suffixes.  Yes, templated code would be more elegant than coding everything in triplicate!  I began with templated code, but finding the proper arguments to pass to <code>std::asynch</code> for templated overloaded functions proved too hard.</p>
<p dir="auto">Places to customize your settings are preceded by the comment tag <code>// OPTION</code>, for which string you can search.  The basic options are below.  The first setting is the most important: selecting your floating point types.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Set your types</h3><a id="user-content-set-your-types" aria-label="Permalink: Set your types" href="#set-your-types"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Alter these three lines in the code to choose your own floating point implementations and <em>voila!</em> You are all set to go.  It will be helpful to order your types from the least precise for <code>first_float</code> to the most precise for <code>third_float</code>.</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="typedef double first_float;
typedef cpp_bin_float_quad second_float;
typedef cpp_bin_float_oct third_float;"><pre><code>typedef double first_float;
typedef cpp_bin_float_quad second_float;
typedef cpp_bin_float_oct third_float;
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Tweak your multi-threading preferences (optional)</h3><a id="user-content-tweak-your-multi-threading-preferences-optional" aria-label="Permalink: Tweak your multi-threading preferences (optional)" href="#tweak-your-multi-threading-preferences-optional"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Depending on how many cores you have you may wish to change <code>unsigned int numThreads;</code> This setting creates <code>numThreads</code> <em>for each of the three floating point types</em>.  So <code>unsigned int numThreads=4;</code> will start 12 threads initially.  Built-in types (like <code>float</code>, <code>double,</code> <code>long double</code>) go much faster on most platforms because of intrinsic processor support.  So threads dedicated to those types will finish far sooner than those using  <code>Boost::multiprecision</code>'s <code>cpp_bin_float</code> types.  Software-emulated floating-point support is always slower.  That's why they invented FPUs.</p>
<p dir="auto">Each thread calculates a batch of pixels at a time.  You can tweak the amount per batch here:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="unsigned int batchSize_first_float=10240;
unsigned int batchSize_second_float=2048;
unsigned int batchSize_third_float=512;"><pre><code>unsigned int batchSize_first_float=10240;
unsigned int batchSize_second_float=2048;
unsigned int batchSize_third_float=512;
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Choosing a built-in type like <code>double</code> for the <code>first_float</code> type, and asigning it a large number of pixels per batch (like 10K above), can be useful to display an image quickly on screen 1 to help perfect your center and zoom.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Tweak how your starting point is calculated (optional)</h3><a id="user-content-tweak-how-your-starting-point-is-calculated-optional" aria-label="Permalink: Tweak how your starting point is calculated (optional)" href="#tweak-how-your-starting-point-is-calculated-optional"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Every pixel on the screen has X and Y coordinates (ranging 0-1023) which correspond to some point on the complex plane and constitute the value of C in the formula Z=Z^2+C.  Presuming that your floating point types range from least precise (for <code>first_float</code>) to most precise, as you zoom deeper, the calculation of C will begin to be affected by the precision of your floating point types, beginning with <code>first_float</code> losing precision in its last decimal places.  You can choose whether to start iterating with a value for C that is calculated separately for each type, in its own precision, which may lead to slightly different values for C.  Or you can start iterating with the exact same value for C for all types by simply casting the value for C in <code>first_float</code> into the higher-precision types.  The latter approach can highlight differences in value due solely to floating-point inaccuracy accumulated through iteration.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Basic program controls</h2><a id="user-content-basic-program-controls" aria-label="Permalink: Basic program controls" href="#basic-program-controls"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The <strong>mouse left-click</strong> is used to recenter the image; keys are used for everything else.  Recentering and zooming takes a few seconds for the screen to reset.  The GUI interface is functional but not as pretty or convenient as professional programs.  This tool is made for research.  Get Ultrafractal or Kalles Fraktaler to make beautiful images easily.  My color palette is ugly as sin.</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><strong>Period</strong> - Zooms in by a factor of two</li>
<li><strong>Comma</strong> - Zooms out by a factor of two.</li>
<li><strong>Semi-colon</strong> - Zooms in by a factor of eight.  These are the only zoom controls.</li>
<li><strong>M, K, O</strong> - Increase max iterations by 1, 10 or 100, respectively.  <strong>Shift+O</strong> increases to the nearest whole 1000.</li>
<li><strong>N, J, I</strong> - Decrease max iterations by 1, 10 or 100, respectively.  <strong>Shift+I</strong> decreases by 1000.</li>
<li><strong>P</strong> - Pause calculation toggle.  This waits for existing threads to complete and then waits for unpause to spawn new ones, so its effect is not instant if you are working on some computationally intensive threads which must finish first.  Keep your batch sizes small for responsiveness.</li>
<li><strong>U</strong> - Unpause.  Doesn't toggle.</li>
<li><strong>R</strong> - Revert to prior coordinates for image center.  Works once.</li>
<li><strong>C</strong> - Toggle a small semi-transparent indicator of the center of the screen.  Useful for zooming.</li>
<li><strong>G</strong> - Toggle a semi-transparent grid overlay with circles various radii and a rectangle around the middle of the screen.  Useful for centering the screen before zooming and estimating orbits.</li>
<li><strong>/</strong> (Forward slash) with mouse over a pixel - Gives coordinate info for that pixel in console</li>

<p><strong>Irvine, Calif., March 12, 2024</strong> <strong>— </strong>Scientists know relatively little about particles released into the air when a vehicle driver brakes, though evidence suggests those particles may be more harmful to health than particles exiting the tailpipe.</p>



<p>In a new study in <em><a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2313897121">Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</a></em>, University of California, Irvine researchers show how most of these particles emitted during light braking carry an electric charge – something that could potentially be exploited to help reduce air pollution from vehicles.</p>



<p>“We found that up to 80% of aerosol particles emitted from braking are electrically charged, and that many of them are in fact highly charged,” saidAdam Thomas, a doctoral candidate in the lab of Jim Smith, professor of chemistry, who led the study alongside UCI postdoctoral researcher Paulus Bauer.</p>



<p>To do the work, the team used a large lathe to spin a detached brake rotor and caliper. They then measured the electric charge of the aerosols emitted into the air and discovered the 80 percent figure.</p>



<p>“I was very surprised,” said Smith. “We were also surprised that this has not really been studied given how common cars are in human societies.”</p>



<p>The research is part of a broader team effort at UCI to understand the public health impacts of non-tailpipe emissions in areas beset by car traffic, including many areas in Southern California.</p>



<p>“The toxicity and health effects of brake wear particles are largely unknown,” said Manabu Shiraiwa, professor of aerosol chemistry at UCI and one of the researchers behind the university-wide project. “Recent results from my lab indicate that they may induce oxidative stress, but more research is needed.”</p>



<p>The new study reveals a problem that may grow as electric cars become more and more common over the next several decades. Electric cars, Smith explained, are not truly zero-emission vehicles, so municipalities need to think about strategies to reduce emissions from brake use as well as tailpipes.</p>



<p>The team found that the percentage of charged particles emitted largely depended on the material makeup of brake pads. Because the particles carry an electric charge, this should make it relatively easy to remove from the air.</p>



<p>“If they are charged, they can be removed easily from the air before they have a chance to have an impact at all on health,” said Smith. “All you would need to do is to collect them with an electrostatic precipitator – a device that exposes the charged particles to an electric field and efficiently sweeps them away.”</p>



<p>The public health risk posed by brake emissions is not borne equally by a population – lower-income parts of cities tend to be more traffic-heavy than others, which creates an environmental justice issue wherein certain socioeconomic classes are more exposed to brake emissions than others.</p>



<p>According to Professor Barbara Finlayson-Pitts, Distinguished Emeritus Professor of chemistry and the principal investigator of the project at UCI, emissions from braking are not well-characterized but are potentially significant in high-traffic areas. “These areas are often in poorer communities and highlight an important aspect of environmental justice that has been largely overlooked,” Finlayson-Pitts said.</p>



<p>The UCI team is working with local community organizations like the Madison Park Neighborhood Association in Santa Ana, which is helping disseminate UCI’s scientific findings to the public. Funding for the study came from fees paid by Volkswagen as part of a 2016 settlement reached with the California Department of Justice, which found that the company used devices that contributed to increased air pollution.</p>

   <p>Police in Charleston, S.C., are investigating the death of John Barnett, a former Boeing quality control manager who became a whistleblower when he went public with his concerns about serious safety issues in the company's commercial airplanes.</p>   <p>Barnett's body was found in a vehicle in a Holiday Inn parking lot in Charleston on Saturday, police said. One day earlier, he testified about the string of problems he says he identified at Boeing's plant where he once helped inspect the 787 aircraft before delivery to customers.</p>   
   
   
<!-- END ID="RES1238040111" CLASS="BUCKETWRAP INTERNALLINK INSETTWOCOLUMN INSET2COL " -->
   <p>Police said officers were sent to the hotel to conduct a welfare check after people were unable to contact Barnett, who had traveled to Charleston to testify in his lawsuit against Boeing. </p>   <p>"Upon their arrival, officers discovered a male inside a vehicle suffering from a gunshot wound to the head," police said in a statement sent to NPR. "He was pronounced deceased at the scene."</p>   <p>The office of Charleston County Coroner Bobbi Jo O'Neal said that Barnett, who had been living in Louisiana after retiring from Boeing, died "from what appears to be a self-inflicted gunshot wound." </p>   <p>Charleston police said detectives are actively investigating the case and are awaiting a formal cause of death as they try to determine the circumstances surrounding Barnett's death.</p>   <p>Barnett, who spent decades working for Boeing at its plants in Everett, Wash., and North Charleston, S.C., had repeatedly alleged that Boeing's manufacturing practices had declined — and that rather than improve them, he added, managers had pressured workers not to document potential defects and problems. </p>   <p>"We are saddened by Mr. Barnett's passing, and our thoughts are with his family and friends," Boeing said in a statement sent to NPR.</p>   <p>Barnett, 62, made international headlines in April of 2019 when he and other former Boeing employees <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/20/business/boeing-dreamliner-production-problems.html">spoke to The New York Times</a> about what he called shoddy manufacturing problems at Boeing. Barnett accused the company of adopting a culture that prioritized raw numbers and profits over quality — and by extension, passenger safety. </p>   
   
<!-- END ID="RES1238040572" CLASS="BUCKETWRAP INTERNALLINK INSETTWOCOLUMN INSET2COL " -->
   <p>"As a quality manager at Boeing, you're the last line of defense before a defect makes it out to the flying public," Barnett told the newspaper. "And I haven't seen a plane out of Charleston yet that I'd put my name on saying it's safe and airworthy."</p>   <p>By the time the article appeared, Barnett had already filed a whistleblower complaint against Boeing, saying that his attempts to raise quality and safety problems had been ignored and that he was punished for continuing to flag them.</p>   
   
<!-- END ID="RES1238041466" CLASS="BUCKETWRAP INTERNALLINK INSETTWOCOLUMN INSET2COL " -->
   <p>Barnett filed a whistleblower complaint against Boeing in early 2017; his case against the company was heading toward a trial this June, his family said. </p>   <p>"He was looking forward to having his day in court and hoped that it would force Boeing to change its culture," the family said in a statement shared with NPR by his brother, Rodney Barnett.</p>   <p>The family says Barnett's health declined because of the stresses of taking a stand against his longtime employer.</p>   <p>"He was suffering from PTSD and anxiety attacks as a result of being subjected to the hostile work environment at Boeing," they said, "which we believe led to his death."</p>   
   <p>When John Barnett was interviewed by Ralph Nader <a href="https://www.ralphnaderradiohour.com/p/boeing-787-dreamliner-hundreds-of-fdf#details">in 2019</a>, he said health issues had persisted after he retired from the plane-maker.</p>   <p>"It's taken a serious mental and emotional toll on me," Barnett said — but, he added, the safety of the airplanes rolling off the production line remained his main focus. </p>   <p>"That's what my story is about, is telling my story enough to where the right people get involved to make sure that these airplanes are made correctly," Barnett said. "Because the 787 carries 288 passengers plus crew. So the last thing I want to do is wake up in the morning and see a 787 has gone down" because of one of the problems he identified.  </p>   <p>"I mean, it's just, it keeps me up at night," he said.</p>

    <tr></tr><tr><td colspan="2"></td><td><div><p>Hi everyone! We're building an AI-enabled editor (<a href="https://glide.agenticlabs.com/">https://glide.agenticlabs.com</a>) that helps developers write technical design docs faster. It’s like an IDE with Copilot, but instead of directly editing your code, it helps you come up with a solid plan before implementing a change. There’s a basic demo here (<a href="https://youtu.be/5uEapdT6nYE" rel="nofollow">https://youtu.be/5uEapdT6nYE</a>), and we also recorded a session with one of our early users running through an unusual task (calling a Fortran algorithm from Go, <a href="https://youtu.be/ppluB0Z1OIA" rel="nofollow">https://youtu.be/ppluB0Z1OIA</a>)</p><p>Why use design docs? Mainly because on complex software projects, if you don’t have a careful strategy, a few lines of code can lead to a ripple effect across the whole codebase. You're working on a small new feature and suddenly, your PR is touching dozens of different files in a handful of directories, and you may be questioning if it still makes sense at all.</p><p>Laying out your approach in a technical design document helps to avoid these situations, so tech companies often embed this practice in their engineering culture. Unfortunately, producing these write-ups is a manual and time-consuming process that keeps you switching between typing in Confluence, searching on GitHub, and drawing on a whiteboard.</p><p>For example, one of our early users is building a RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) system in Rust, and needs to rewrite their original chunking algorithm that was created in Python. A change like that involves not only porting the chunking logic but also defining new structs, choosing the Rust libraries for text parsing, re-integrating with the Rust server, and changing the endpoint on the front end. Simple-sounding changes like these can end up with many "tentacles" devs have to work through. Our product helps teams like this spec out their approach more quickly.</p><p>The need for this hit us when we were working on a product using LLMs to turn tickets into PRs. You can just assign a ticket to GPT-4 and review the PR, right? Turns out that most people (including us) don’t write very complete or specific tickets on the first pass, and when they do, that ends up being more effort than just doing the whole thing yourself.</p><p>What was missing was a fast way to iterate on goals, requirements, and implementation plans for code that could then be useful to developers (whether AI assisted or not) to implement with high confidence. Our editor, Glide, splits this process into the following stages and lets you spend as much or as little time on each stage as makes sense.</p><p>(1) We index your project code with Tree-Sitter and make it searchable, so you can add relevant parts of the codebase to the task context.</p><p>(2) AI writes the first pass for a high-level solution outline given the code and the goal. It will try to point out missing details or ambiguities about the task so far.</p><p>(3) As a developer you can easily edit the generated content—tweaks like “change step 3” or “remove the part about caching” don’t require additional back-and-forth conversation.</p><p>(4) The next stage is a step-by-step plan—a pseudocode-level guide for how to complete the change. AI generates this, and again you can make adjustments in-line as needed.</p><p>(5) There is a chat mode for deeper discussions about the content—just highlight any text and click chat. This works well for exploring alternatives, getting more specific on a particular point, or understanding why the AI wrote what it did.</p><p>(6) Once the plan looks good, you can have AI generate code edits for each step. You’re free to make additional changes here or just open the markdown doc with code edits in your local VSCode via an extension, so you have it as a reference while you implement.</p><p>This looks a lot like collaborative Chain of Thought, explicitly writing out each step in a line of reasoning, for both the developer and the LLM. Breaking down a high-level task with AI this way can work well for building consensus on the desired end state of your change.</p><p>We plan to charge companies per seat, but today, it’s free for individual use as we get more feedback on the product. One future area we’re excited for is multiplayer mode—where a few developers can share, edit, and leave comments on the generated docs in a shared workspace. If you have ideas for this experience, we’d love to hear them.</p><p>We would love for you to give it a try at <a href="https://glide.agenticlabs.com/">https://glide.agenticlabs.com/</a> and tell us what you think! We’re excited to discuss this with any comments you have!</p><p>P.S. We only keep the indexed code in an in-memory cache while you’re using it. We don’t store your code or use it as training data!</p></div></td></tr>        <tr></tr><tr><td colspan="2"></td><td><form action="comment" method="post"></form></td></tr>  </tbody></table>

<h2 id="why-swift">Why Swift?</h2>

<p>Swift is widely known as the modern language for app development on Apple devices. However, over the course of its first decade, it has grown into a versatile, multi-platform language targeting use cases where you’d otherwise find C or C++.</p>

<p>Personally, I have come to appreciate Swift’s emphasis on memory safety and great ergonomics, and want these traits for embedded systems where reliability and security are critically important.</p>

<p>But embedded systems are not only found in mission-critical applications. Some are actually all fun and <em>games</em>.</p>

<h3 id="playdate-by-panic">Playdate by Panic</h3>

<p>Over the holiday season, I read about building Playdate games in C and became curious if the same was possible in Swift. For those unfamiliar with Playdate, it is a tiny handheld game system built by Panic, creators of popular apps and games like “Transmit,” “Nova,” “Firewatch,” “Untitled Goose Game,” and more. It houses a Cortex M7 processor, a 400 by 240 1-bit display, and has a small runtime for hosting games. Additionally, Panic provides an <a href="https://play.date/dev/">SDK</a> for building games in both C and Lua.</p>

<p>While most Playdate games are written in Lua for ease of development, they can run into performance problems that necessitate the added complexity of using C. Swift’s combination of high-level ergonomics with low-level performance, as well as its strong support for interoperating with C, make it seem like a good match for the Playdate. However, the typical Swift application and runtime exceed the device’s tight resource constraints.</p>

<p>Regardless, I still wanted to create a game in Swift and I had good idea for the approach.</p>

<h3 id="the-embedded-language-mode">The Embedded Language Mode</h3>

<p>Recently, the Swift project began developing a new embedded language mode to support highly constrained platforms. This mode utilizes generic specialization, inlining, and dead code stripping to produce tiny binaries, while retaining the core features of Swift.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Note: The embedded language mode is actively evolving and is helping drive the development of language features such as: <a href="https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0390-noncopyable-structs-and-enums.md">non-copyable types</a>, <a href="https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0413-typed-throws.md">typed throws</a>, etc. It is available now in <a href="https://www.swift.org/download/">nightly toolchains</a> and if you’re curious to learn more, check out the <a href="https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/main/visions/embedded-swift.md">Vision for Embedded Swift</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>These defining characteristics make the embedded language mode a great solution for shrinking Swift to fit the Playdate’s constraints.</p>

<p>With the embedded Swift language mode in hand, I got to work.</p>

<h2 id="the-games">The Games</h2>

<p>I wrote two small games in Swift for the Playdate. The first game is a port of the Playdate SDK sample of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life">Conway’s Game of Life</a> into Swift:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.swift.org/assets/images/2024-03-12-byte-sized-swift-tiny-games-playdate/playdate-simulator-still-life.png" alt="A screenshot of the Playdate Simulator running Conway’s Game of Life."></p>

<p>This game is one Swift file that builds directly against the Playdate C API and does not require dynamic memory allocation. The packaged game clocks in at 788 bytes, slightly smaller than the C example, which is 904 bytes.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>$ </span><span>wc</span> <span>-c</span> &lt; <span>$REPO_ROOT</span>/Examples/Life/Life.pdx/pdex.bin
     788

<span>$ </span><span>wc</span> <span>-c</span> &lt; <span>$HOME</span>/Developer/PlaydateSDK/C_API/Examples/GameOfLife.pdx/pdex.bin
     904
</code></pre></div>

<blockquote>
  <p>Note: Both versions could likely be made smaller, but I did not try to optimize code size.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The second game is a paddle-and-ball style game named “Swift Break.”</p>

<p><img src="https://www.swift.org/assets/images/2024-03-12-byte-sized-swift-tiny-games-playdate/playdate-simulator-still-swiftbreak.png" alt="A screenshot of the Playdate Simulator with the Swift Break splash screen."></p>

<p>Swift Break uses the same high-level language features you’d find in desktop and server applications, such as <a href="https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-language/enumerations/#Associated-Values">enums with associated values</a>, <a href="https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-language/generics">generic types and functions</a>, and <a href="https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-language/memorysafety">automatic memory management</a> to simplify game development while retaining C-level performance.</p>

<p>For example, here’s the core game logic for handling ball bounces:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>sprite</span><span>.</span><span>moveWithCollisions</span><span>(</span><span>goalX</span><span>:</span> <span>newX</span><span>,</span> <span>goalY</span><span>:</span> <span>newY</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span> <span>_</span><span>,</span> <span>_</span><span>,</span> <span>collisions</span> <span>in</span>
  <span>for</span> <span>collision</span> <span>in</span> <span>collisions</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>let</span> <span>otherSprite</span> <span>=</span> <span>Sprite</span><span>(</span><span>borrowing</span><span>:</span> <span>collision</span><span>.</span><span>other</span><span>)</span>

    <span>// If we hit a visible brick, remove it.</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>otherSprite</span><span>.</span><span>tag</span> <span>==</span> <span>.</span><span>brick</span><span>,</span> <span>otherSprite</span><span>.</span><span>isVisible</span> <span>{</span>
      <span>otherSprite</span><span>.</span><span>removeSprite</span><span>()</span>
      <span>activeGame</span><span>.</span><span>bricksRemaining</span> <span>-=</span> <span>1</span>
    <span>}</span>

    <span>var</span> <span>normal</span> <span>=</span> <span>Vector</span><span>(</span><span>collision</span><span>.</span><span>normal</span><span>)</span>

    <span>if</span> <span>otherSprite</span><span>.</span><span>tag</span> <span>==</span> <span>.</span><span>paddle</span> <span>{</span>
      <span>// Compute deflection angle (radians) for the normal in domain</span>
      <span>// -pi/6 to pi/6.</span>
      <span>let</span> <span>placement</span> <span>=</span> <span>placement</span><span>(</span><span>of</span><span>:</span> <span>collision</span><span>,</span> <span>along</span><span>:</span> <span>otherSprite</span><span>)</span>
      <span>let</span> <span>deflectionAngle</span> <span>=</span> <span>placement</span> <span>*</span> <span>(</span><span>.</span><span>pi</span> <span>/</span> <span>6</span><span>)</span>
      <span>normal</span><span>.</span><span>rotate</span><span>(</span><span>by</span><span>:</span> <span>deflectionAngle</span><span>)</span>
    <span>}</span>

    <span>activeGame</span><span>.</span><span>ballVelocity</span><span>.</span><span>reflect</span><span>(</span><span>along</span><span>:</span> <span>normal</span><span>)</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>It calls a <code>moveWithCollisions</code> method to move the ball, iterating through a collection of objects the ball bounced off of while moving.</p>

<p>Swift Break features a splash screen, a pause menu, paddle-location-based bounce physics, infinite levels, a game over screen, and allows you to control the paddle with either the D-Pad or the Crank!</p>

<h2 id="try-it-out">Try it Out</h2>

<p>If you’re eager to use Swift on your Playdate, the <a href="https://github.com/apple/swift-playdate-examples">swift-playdate-examples</a> repository has you covered. It contains the above ready-to-use examples that demonstrate how to build Swift games for the Playdate, both for the simulator and the hardware.</p>

<p>Additionally, the repository includes detailed documentation to guide you through the setup process. Whether you’re a seasoned developer or just starting, you’ll find the necessary resources to bring your ideas to life.</p>

<p>But if you’re up for a deep dive into the technical details of what it takes to bring Swift to a new platform, read on!</p>

<h2 id="deep-dive-bringing-swift-to-the-playdate">Deep Dive: Bringing Swift to the Playdate</h2>

<p>Bringing up a new platform is always fraught with challenges and infuriating bugs. Everything is broken with numerous false starts, until you clear the last bug, and then it all comes together. Getting Swift games running on the Playdate was no different.</p>

<p>My general approach was to leverage Swift’s interoperability to build on top of the Playdate C SDK. The good news is that the Swift toolchain already had all the features I needed to get this working. I just had to figure out how to put them together. Here’s an overview of the path I took:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Building object files for the Playdate Simulator</li>
  <li>Importing the Playdate C API</li>
  <li>Running on the Simulator</li>
  <li>Running on the Hardware</li>
  <li>Improving the API with Swift</li>
  <li>Completing Swift Break</li>
</ul>

<p>Without further ado, let’s get started.</p>

<h3 id="building-object-files-for-the-playdate-simulator">Building object files for the Playdate Simulator</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>Note: The commands mentioned below were run with a Swift nightly toolchain installed and have the <code>TOOLCHAINS</code> environment variable set to the name of the toolchain.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My first step was compiling an object file for the Playdate Simulator. The simulator works by dynamically loading host libraries, so I needed to build the object files for the host’s platform and architecture (the so-called <em>triple</em> in compiler-speak), which <code>swiftc</code> does by default. The only additional flags I needed were for enabling embedded Swift and code optimizations.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>$ </span><span>cat </span>test.swift
<span>let </span>value <span>=</span> 1

<span>$ </span><span>mkdir </span>build

<span>$ </span>swiftc <span>-c</span> test.swift <span>-o</span> build/test.o <span>\</span>
    <span>-Osize</span> <span>-wmo</span> <span>-enable-experimental-feature</span> Embedded

<span>$ </span>file build/test.o
test.o: Mach-O 64-bit object arm64
</code></pre></div>

<h3 id="importing-the-playdate-c-api">Importing the Playdate C API</h3>

<p>The next step was compiling against the Playdate C API from Swift. This was straightforward due to the structure of the Playdate C header files and Swift’s native support for interoperating with C.</p>

<p>I started by locating the Playdate C header files:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>$ </span><span>ls</span> <span>$HOME</span>/Developer/PlaydateSDK/C_API/
Examples     buildsupport pd_api       pd_api.h

<span>$ </span><span>ls</span> <span>$HOME</span>/Developer/PlaydateSDK/C_API/
pd_api_display.h     pd_api_gfx.h         pd_api_lua.h         pd_api_sound.h       pd_api_sys.h
pd_api_file.h        pd_api_json.h        pd_api_scoreboards.h pd_api_sprite.h
</code></pre></div>

<p>And used an “include search path” (<code>-I</code>) to tell the Swift compiler’s C interoperability feature where to find them. I additionally needed to pass a “define” (<code>-D</code>) to tell the compiler how to parse the header files:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>$ </span>swiftc ... <span>-Xcc</span> <span>-I</span> <span>-Xcc</span> <span>$HOME</span>/Developer/PlaydateSDK/C_API/ <span>-Xcc</span> <span>-DTARGET_EXTENSION</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Next, I created a <a href="https://clang.llvm.org/docs/Modules.html#module-maps">module map file</a> to wrap the headers into an importable module from Swift:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>$ </span><span>cat</span> <span>$HOME</span>/Developer/PlaydateSDK/C_API/module.modulemap
module CPlaydate <span>[</span>system] <span>{</span>
  umbrella header <span>"pd_api.h"</span>
  <span>export</span> <span>*</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>And used an “import search path” (<code>-I</code>) to tell the Swift compiler where to find the CPlaydate module:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>$ </span>swiftc ... <span>-I</span> <span>$HOME</span>/Developer/PlaydateSDK/C_API/
</code></pre></div>

<p>Lastly, I made a minimal “library” using the Playdate C API from Swift and compiled using the flags above:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>$ </span><span>cat </span>test.swift
import CPlaydate
<span>let </span>pd: UnsafePointer&lt;PlaydateAPI&gt;? <span>=</span> nil

<span>$ </span><span>mkdir </span>build

<span>$ </span>swiftc <span>\</span>
    <span>-c</span> test.swift <span>\</span>
    <span>-o</span> build/test.o <span>\</span>
    <span>-Osize</span> <span>-wmo</span> <span>-enable-experimental-feature</span> Embedded <span>\</span>

<h3 id="running-on-the-simulator">Running on the Simulator</h3>

<p>Once I was able to use the Playdate C API from Swift, I ported the Conway’s Game of Life example included in the Playdate SDK to Swift, referencing <a href="https://sdk.play.date/2.2.0/Inside%20Playdate%20with%20C.html">Inside Playdate with C</a> frequently to familiarize myself with the API.</p>

<p>The C implementation of Conway’s strictly operates on Playdate OS-vended frame buffers and uses the display as game state, removing the need for separate data structures and dynamic allocations. As a result, the porting process was very mechanical because the bit manipulation and pointer operations in the C example have direct Swift analogs:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>static</span> <span>inline</span> <span>int</span> <span>val</span><span>(</span><span>uint8_t</span><span>*</span> <span>row</span><span>,</span> <span>int</span> <span>x</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>

</code></pre></div>

<p>I built the source into a dynamic library and used <code>pdc</code> (the Playdate compiler) to wrap the final <code>dylib</code> into a <code>pdx</code> (Playdate executable).</p>

<div><pre><code><span>$ </span>swiftc <span>\</span>

<span>$ $HOME</span>/Developer/PlaydateSDK/bin/pdc build Test

<span>$ </span><span>ls </span>Test.pdx
pdex.dylib pdxinfo
</code></pre></div>

<p>I opened my game file <code>Test.pdx</code> using the Playdate simulator and as you might expect, it worked on the first try … just kidding, it crashed!</p>

<p>After some debugging, I realized the <code>Makefile</code> used to compile the C example included an additional file <code>setup.c</code> from the SDK containing the symbol <code>_eventHandlerShim</code> needed to bootstrap the game. If this symbol is not present in the binary, the Simulator falls back to bootstrapping the game using the symbol <code>_eventHandler</code> which my binary did contain, but meant my game skipped an important setup step.</p>

<p>So, I compiled <code>setup.c</code> into an object file using <code>clang</code>, linked it into my dynamic library, re-ran, and voila! I had Conway’s Game of Life written in Swift running on the Playdate Simulator.</p>

<h3 id="running-on-the-hardware">Running on the Hardware</h3>

<p>After successfully running on the simulator, I wanted to run the game on real hardware. A colleague graciously allowed me to borrow their Playdate and I began hacking away.</p>

<p>I started by matching the triple used by the C examples for the device and seeing what happened.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>$ </span>swiftc ... <span>-target</span> armv7em-none-none-eabi
&lt;module-includes&gt;:1:10: note: <span>in </span>file included from &lt;module-includes&gt;:1:

<span>$HOME</span>/Developer/PlaydateSDK/C_API/pd_api.h:13:10: error: <span>'stdlib.h'</span> file not found
<span>#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;</span>
         ^
</code></pre></div>

<p>These errors did not previously occur because I was targeting the host machine and used the host headers for the C standard library. I considered using the same host headers for the target device, but didn’t want to debug platform incompatibilities. Little did I know, I would have to do this regardless.</p>

<p>Instead, I decided to follow the route used by the C example programs which leverage the libc headers from a <code>gcc</code> toolchain installed with the Playdate SDK. I copied the include paths used by the C examples and re-ran the compile.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>$ </span><span>mkdir </span>build

</code></pre></div>

<p>The compile succeeded and I had an object file for the real hardware. I went through similar steps to link and package the object file into a <code>pdx</code>, using <code>clang</code> as the linker driver.</p>

<p>I deployed the game onto a Playdate, and … it crashed.</p>

<p>For some reason, when the frame-update function pointer was called, the game would crash! Debugging this issue was confusing at first, but due to past experience deploying Swift onto a Cortex M7, I realized I likely had a calling convention mismatch. I added a compiler flag <code>-Xfrontend -experimental-platform-c-calling-convention=arm_aapcs_vfp</code> to try to match the calling convention used by the Playdate OS.</p>

<p>Once again, I deployed my game to the Playdate and … it actually worked! You can see the game in action below:</p>

<video title="A video of Conway's Game of Life running on Playdate hardware mirrored to a Mac." autoplay="" loop="" muted="">
  <source src="https://swift.org/assets/images/2024-03-12-byte-sized-swift-tiny-games-playdate/playdate-mirror-video-life.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>

<p>I then integrated my manual compilation steps into the Makefiles found in the Playdate SDK, going through a number of options before landing on the final solution found in <code>swift-playdate-examples</code>. The result of this effort was a single <code>make</code> command to build a <code>pdx</code> compatible with both the simulator and hardware!</p>

<h3 id="improving-the-api-with-swift">Improving the API with Swift</h3>

<p>After porting Conway’s Game of Life, I began a more ambitious project: a paddle-and-ball style game named Swift Break. However, I quickly encountered friction using the raw Playdate C API directly in Swift. In typical programming fashion, I took a detour to work on the API’s ergonomics instead of the game! At this point, I had also piqued the interest of some colleagues who contributed further improvements.</p>

<p>One hurdle was the naming conventions of the imported API. In C, enum cases are often prefixed with their type’s name to prevent programmers from inadvertently mixing unrelated enum instances and case constants. However, in Swift, such prefixes are unnecessary as the compiler type-checks comparisons to ensure the correct cases are used.</p>

<p>Fortunately, Swift already provides tools for addressing this precise issue, known as <a href="https://clang.llvm.org/docs/APINotes.html">API notes</a>. I added an API notes file to the Playdate SDK and renamed enum cases with more idiomatic Swift names:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>// Before</span>
<span>if</span> <span>event</span> <span>==</span> <span>kEventPause</span> <span>{</span> <span>...</span> <span>}</span>

<span>// After</span>
<span>if</span> <span>event</span> <span>==</span> <span>.</span><span>pause</span> <span>{</span> <span>...</span> <span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>A bigger issue, however, was the lack of nullability annotations in the C API. This meant the generated code had redundant null checks everywhere, bloating code size and hurting performance. While I usually would have used API notes to add the missing annotations, this was not possible. The C API uses structs with function pointers as a “vtable”, and unfortunately, these are not currently modifiable with API notes. Due to this incompatibility, I had to adopt a suboptimal solution: pervasively using <code>Optional.unsafelyUnwrapped</code> throughout the Swift code.</p>

<p>Although this approach eliminated the null checks, it dramatically hurt readability:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>// C API in Swift with redundant null checks</span>
<span>let</span> <span>spritePointer</span> <span>=</span> <span>playdate_api</span><span>.</span><span>pointee</span><span>.</span><span>sprite</span><span>.</span><span>pointee</span><span>.</span><span>newSprite</span><span>()</span>

<span>// C API in Swift without redundant null checks</span>
<span>let</span> <span>spritePointer</span> <span>=</span> <span>playdate_api</span><span>.</span><span>unsafelyUnwrapped</span><span>.</span><span>pointee</span><span>.</span><span>sprite</span><span>.</span><span>unsafelyUnwrapped</span><span>.</span><span>pointee</span><span>.</span><span>newSprite</span><span>.</span><span>unsafelyUnwrapped</span><span>()</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>To address the readability issues, I created a thin Swift overlay on top of the C API. I wrapped function pointer accesses into static and instance methods on Swift types and converted function get/set pairs to Swift properties. Creating a sprite became much more intuitive and introduced zero overhead on top of the equivalent imported C calls.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>var</span> <span>sprite</span> <span>=</span> <span>Sprite</span><span>(</span><span>bitmapPath</span><span>:</span> <span>"background.png"</span><span>)</span>
<span>sprite</span><span>.</span><span>collisionsEnabled</span> <span>=</span> <span>false</span>
<span>sprite</span><span>.</span><span>zIndex</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span>
<span>sprite</span><span>.</span><span>addSprite</span><span>()</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Colleagues further improved the overlay by abstracting Playdate APIs requiring manual memory management to be automatically handled. An excellent example is the C API’s <a href="https://sdk.play.date/2.2.0/Inside%20Playdate%20with%20C.html#f-sprite.moveWithCollisions"><code>moveWithCollisions</code></a> function, which returns a buffer of <code>SpriteCollisionInfo</code> structs that must be freed by the caller. Using the overlay allowed us to avoid manually deallocating the buffer and made the API easier to use:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>// moveWithCollisions without the overlay</span>
<span>var</span> <span>count</span><span>:</span> <span>Int32</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span>
<span>var</span> <span>actualX</span><span>:</span> <span>Int32</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span>
<span>var</span> <span>actualY</span><span>:</span> <span>Int32</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span>
<span>let</span> <span>collisionsStartAddress</span> <span>=</span> <span>playdate_api</span><span>.</span><span>pointee</span><span>.</span><span>sprite</span><span>.</span><span>pointee</span><span>.</span><span>moveWithCollisions</span><span>(</span><span>sprite</span><span>,</span> <span>10</span><span>,</span> <span>10</span><span>,</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>actualX</span><span>,</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>actualY</span><span>,</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>count</span><span>)</span>
<span>let</span> <span>collisions</span> <span>=</span> <span>UnsafeBufferPointer</span><span>(</span><span>start</span><span>:</span> <span>collisionsStartAddress</span><span>,</span> <span>count</span><span>:</span> <span>count</span><span>)</span>
<span>defer</span> <span>{</span> <span>collisions</span><span>.</span><span>deallocate</span><span>()</span> <span>}</span>
<span>for</span> <span>collision</span> <span>in</span> <span>collisions</span> <span>{</span> <span>...</span> <span>}</span>

<span>// moveWithCollisions with the overlay</span>
<span>sprite</span><span>.</span><span>moveWithCollisions</span><span>(</span><span>goalX</span><span>:</span> <span>10</span><span>,</span> <span>goalY</span><span>:</span> <span>10</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span> <span>actualX</span><span>,</span> <span>actualY</span><span>,</span> <span>collisions</span> <span>in</span>
    <span>for</span> <span>collision</span> <span>in</span> <span>collisions</span> <span>{</span> <span>...</span> <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>These improvements dramatically streamlined writing code for the Playdate. Additionally, as Swift’s support for ownership and non-copyable types improves, I anticipate even more ergonomic representations of the C APIs without language overhead.</p>

<h3 id="completing-swift-break">Completing Swift Break</h3>

<p>Equipped with a refined Swift Playdate API, I returned to developing Swift Break.</p>

<p>I nailed down the basics pretty quickly, but couldn’t resist adding extra features just for the fun of it. One of the highlights was implementing basic logic to deflect ball bounces based on the location where the ball and paddle collide.</p>

<p>This feature required calculating a normal vector relative to a hypothetical curve representing a rounded paddle and then reflecting the ball’s velocity about the normal. Here’s a visualization of the intended behavior:</p>

<video title="A Desmos geometric animation of Swift Break ball bouncing logic." autoplay="" loop="" muted="">
  <source src="https://swift.org/assets/images/2024-03-12-byte-sized-swift-tiny-games-playdate/desmos-ball-bounce.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>

<blockquote>
  <p>Note: Making the animation for this post ironically helped me root cause a bug in the bouncing logic. Under some combinations of entry angle and normal angle, the current design can cause the ball to bounce <em>down</em> into the paddle instead of up.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To turn the math into an algorithm, I had to perform the following steps:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Check if the object the ball collided with is the paddle</li>
  <li>Compute the location of the collision along the paddle from -1 to +1</li>
  <li>Map the location into a deflection angle from from -π/6 to +π/6</li>
  <li>Rotate the collision normal vector by the deflection angle</li>
  <li>Reflect the ball’s velocity along the rotated normal</li>
</ol>

<p>I then directly translated this algorithm into code inside the ball collision callback:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>if</span> <span>otherSprite</span><span>.</span><span>tag</span> <span>==</span> <span>.</span><span>paddle</span> <span>{</span>                                <span>// 1</span>
  <span>let</span> <span>placement</span> <span>=</span> <span>placement</span><span>(</span><span>of</span><span>:</span> <span>collision</span><span>,</span> <span>along</span><span>:</span> <span>otherSprite</span><span>)</span> <span>// 2</span>
  <span>let</span> <span>deflectionAngle</span> <span>=</span> <span>placement</span> <span>*</span> <span>(</span><span>.</span><span>pi</span> <span>/</span> <span>6</span><span>)</span>                  <span>// 3</span>
  <span>normal</span><span>.</span><span>rotate</span><span>(</span><span>by</span><span>:</span> <span>deflectionAngle</span><span>)</span>                           <span>// 4</span>
<span>}</span>
<span>ballVelocity</span><span>.</span><span>reflect</span><span>(</span><span>along</span><span>:</span> <span>normal</span><span>)</span>                            <span>// 5</span>
</code></pre></div>

<h3 id="running-on-the-hardware-again">Running on the Hardware (Again!)</h3>

<p>Throughout the development of “Swift Break,” I regularly deployed the game to the Playdate Simulator. However, the real challenge emerged when I decided to run the game on actual Playdate hardware. As usual, I loaded the game, and … yet again, it crashed, but this time a lot of things were going wrong.</p>

<p>To cut a long debugging story short, I found that the <code>-Xfrontend</code> flag mentioned earlier did not entirely resolve the calling convention issues. To address this, I needed to configure the compiler to match the CPU and floating-point ABI of the microcontroller in the Playdate. This aspect was overlooked when I was porting Conway’s Game of Life since I happened to both not pass structs by value and didn’t use floating-point operations.</p>

<p>The final and most confusing crash arose from a specific Playdate C API call returning an enum from the Playdate OS. After a thorough debugging process, e.g. using <code>printf</code> everywhere, I uncovered a discrepancy in the memory layout of the enum between the system built with <code>gcc</code> and the game built with <code>swiftc</code>. With further research I found the difference stemmed from <code>gcc</code> defaulting to <code>-fshort-enums</code> while <code>swiftc</code> via <code>clang</code> used <code>-fno-short-enums</code> for the <code>armv7em-none-none-eabi</code> triple.</p>

<p>I collected these new and removed flags into the following compile command:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>$ </span>swiftc <span>\</span>

<p>With these adjustments, I attempted once more, and <em>finally</em> “Swift Break” successfully ran on the Playdate hardware! I’ve included a brief video showcasing the game below:</p>

<h2 id="wrapping-up">Wrapping Up</h2>

<p>Thanks for diving into the bring-up journey with me. From refining the Swift Playdate API to tackling issues involving calling conventions, CPU configurations, and memory layout disparities, there was no shortage of challenges.</p>

<p>However, with the issues now resolved, creating Playdate games in Swift is a streamlined process. Just run <code>make</code> and enjoy a development experience with Swift that is both expressive <em>and</em> performant.</p>

<p>You can find all the code examples mentioned in this post in the <a href="https://github.com/apple/swift-playdate-examples">swift-playdate-examples</a> repository with accompanying “Getting Started” documentation.</p>

If the NYPD did not withdraw the subpoena, Sachs told the NYPD, Clancy would go to court with a motion to quash it. Rather than go to court to explain to a judge why the subpoena was necessary, the NYPD wrote back the same afternoon to say that it was withdrawing the subpoena altogether.</p><p>The NYPD subpoena letter cited as its empowering authority <a href="https://codelibrary.amlegal.com/codes/newyorkcity/latest/NYCadmin/0-0-0-25019" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Section 14-137 of the New York City Administrative Code</a>, which gives the NYPD commissioner the power to issue subpoenas. But as Sachs argued in her letter to the NYPD, that doesn't mean the police department can issue warrantless subpoenas for anything they feel like. Sachs cited case law suggesting that the subpoena power is actually restricted to investigations involving current or former officers.</p><p>Under the federal <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2703" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Stored Communications Act</a>, authorities who want to subpoena electronic records from a provider either need a court-issued warrant, or, if they're using an administrative subpoena, "prior notice from the governmental entity to the subscriber or customer."</p><p>"This kind of administrative subpoena is not overseen by any court, and is not meant to target people like our client," Sachs told Hell Gate. "If it's left unchecked, it would chill speech from potentially anyone that the NYPD decided to subpoena information about."</p><p>"We don't give that kind of power to police departments without judicial review," said Marty Stolar, a lawyer who has worked on similar cases in the past. "It's got to be a process that's connected to a court if you're going to apply it to the general population. Here, the NYPD is misusing the power of subpoena to compel the production of documents as if they had the right to demand that information from any citizen. And they don't have that right. We have never given it to them."&nbsp;</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://lede-admin.hellgatenyc.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2024/03/Twitter_Subpoena.jpg?w=710" srcset="https://lede-admin.hellgatenyc.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2024/03/Twitter_Subpoena.jpg?w=425&amp;quality=75 425w, https://lede-admin.hellgatenyc.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2024/03/Twitter_Subpoena.jpg?w=850&amp;quality=75 850w, https://lede-admin.hellgatenyc.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2024/03/Twitter_Subpoena.jpg?w=585&amp;quality=75 585w, https://lede-admin.hellgatenyc.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2024/03/Twitter_Subpoena.jpg?w=1170&amp;quality=75 1170w, https://lede-admin.hellgatenyc.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2024/03/Twitter_Subpoena.jpg?w=710&amp;quality=75 710w, https://lede-admin.hellgatenyc.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2024/03/Twitter_Subpoena.jpg?w=1420&amp;quality=75 1420w" sizes="(max-width: 30rem) 425px, (min-width: 30rem) and (max-width: 40rem) 585px, (min-width: 40rem) 710px" loading="lazy"><figcaption>A copy of the NYPD subpoena supplied by X.</figcaption></figure><p>The legal status of the NYPD's use of warrantless subpoenas for social media information isn't as clear as it might be, in part because when the NYPD's use of such subpoenas is challenged, it tends to withdraw the subpoenas rather than engage in a court process that might definitively establish the legality or illegality of its practice.</p><p>In 2020, the department <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/14/nyregion/patriot-act-subpoena-nypd.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sent a nearly identical subpoena</a> to Twitter, seeking a broad swath of records for Tina Moore, a New York Post reporter covering the NYPD. When lawyers for the Post threatened to challenge the subpoena in court, the NYPD hastily withdrew it. The incident provoked significant backlash, with free speech advocates, the Post, and groups like the Media Law Resource Center decrying the chilling effect of the subpoena.</p><p>Clancy isn't working as a conventional journalist, but he is involved in the collection and dissemination of information about the NYPD. As president of the Brooklyn chapter of Copwatch Patrol Unit, Clancy receives tips about police conduct, and films police conduct himself. While the withdrawal of the subpoena makes it all but impossible to know what the NYPD's goal was in issuing it, he has his theories. Maybe the police are just trying to rattle him with a shot across the bow. Or maybe the NYPD is trying to find out whether NYPD officers themselves are feeding his organization information about misconduct. "That happens," Clancy told Hell Gate. "For a junior officer who sees misconduct by his superiors, if you take that to Internal Affairs, maybe your boss has a connection there and it winds up being you who gets in trouble. So some cops prefer to take it to Copwatch."</p><p>As a further wrinkle, the NYPD's subpoena letter to X was sent by Michael Yanni, a member of the office of the department's deputy commissioner for legal matters, but used the email address <a href="mailto:intelsubpoenas@nynjhidta.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">intelsubpoenas@nynjhidta.org</a>, a domain affiliated with the <a href="https://www.hidtaprogram.org/ny_nj.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">New York and New Jersey High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area</a> office, a regional and federal joint drug task force. Similarly, the letter from the NYPD notifying NYCLU of the withdrawal of the subpoena was sent from Mallory McGee, an attorney with the NYPD Legal Bureau, using another email attached to the drug task force.</p><p>Why are NYPD lawyers sending out subpoenas for a critic's private information without a warrant? Why are they using federal task force email domains to do it? Why did they withdraw the subpoena rather than defend its legitimacy in court? How many of these warrantless subpoenas have they sent out in the last year? We asked the NYPD these questions, but did not receive a response.</p><p>Clancy, for his part,<strong> </strong>said that he's undaunted, and that the NYPD has no business rummaging through his social media content and metadata.&nbsp;</p><p>"Why would you use a shower curtain and close the bathroom door when you take a shower, if you have nothing to hide?" he asked. "Because it's none of your business, that's why. What the police might want to know and what they have a legal right to know are two different things."</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>I was watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jw00MbIJcrk">acerola's video</a> on foliage rendering and I liked the idea of rendering millions of grass blades, it was a good opportunity to play around with GPU instancing and indirect draw.</p><h3 id="what-i'll-be-using"><span>
      What I'll Be Using
    </span></h3><p>The features and extensions set used in this abroach are:</p><ul><li><p><code>VK_EXT_buffer_device_address</code> This extension allows for using pointers in GLSL and passing them in push constants or buffers, this extension along with <code>VK_EXT_descriptor_indexing</code> makes dealing with buffers and textures soo much easier and nicer IMHO.</p></li><li><p><code>multiDrawIndirect</code> This feature allows for multiple draw calls in indirect buffer make use of them to draw multiple LODs of the grass.</p></li></ul><h2 id="how-it-works"><span>
      How It Works
    </span></h2><p>Basically, there's a compute pass that generates info about the grass blades stores them in a buffer, and does frustum culling and LOD selection and fill indirect commands, then a graphics pass to draw the blades.</p><h3 id="compute-pass"><span>
      Compute Pass
    </span></h3><p>our grass blade is defined by the following</p><pre><code><span>struct</span> <span>GrassBlade</span> <span>{</span>
	<span>// holds position(displacement from the center) of the blade</span>
	<span>// and a value determining how much it will bend</span>
	<span>vec4</span> pos_bend<span>;</span>
	<span>// holds width and height multiplier</span>
	<span>// and pitch angle</span>
	<span>// and a term used for animation</span>
	<span>vec4</span> size_anim_pitch<span>;</span>
<span>}</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre>

<p>we want to generate all of this data we start by</p><h4 id="position(displacement-from-the-center)"><span>
      Position(displacement from the center)
    </span></h4><p>It starts by generating random positions inside a rectangle area defined by center, width and height using the following formula</p><pre><code><span>// Hash Functions for GPU Rendering, Jarzynski et al.</span>

</code></pre>

<h4 id="height-and-width"><span>
      Height &amp; Width
    </span></h4><p>then it generates a uv coords for each grass blade to sample a texture by doing</p><pre><code><span>vec2</span> bottom_left_corner <span>=</span> pc<span>.</span>aria_center<span>.</span>xz <span>-</span> <span>(</span>pc<span>.</span>aria<span>.</span>xy <span>/</span> <span>2.0</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

<span>vec2</span> uv <span>=</span> pos<span>.</span>xz <span>/</span> <span>(</span>upper_right_corner <span>-</span> bottom_left_corner<span>)</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre>

<p>after that using the uv coords, we can sample a simplex noise texture to have height multiplier or width multiplier we can also add some terms for user control using simplex noise for height makes sense as the tall grass tends to stick together in real life.</p><p><img src="https://www.thegeeko.me/images/folliage-simplex.png" alt="simplex noise for hight"></p><h4 id="bend-term"><span>
      Bend Term
    </span></h4><p>This is a term to define how bendable a grass blade is which will be used later as a multiplier in vertex shader to do the animation.</p><h4 id="animation-term"><span>
      Animation term
    </span></h4><p>This is a term used by the animation formula to animate the grass it's the same for all of the vertices so calculating it here saves us time and allows us to not pass uvs to vertex shader which is 2 floats but for millions of blads it will be 100s of megabytes. It's calculated by the following</p><pre><code><span>float</span> <span>wind</span><span>(</span><span>vec2</span> uv<span>,</span> <span>float</span> time<span>,</span> <span>float</span> base_freq<span>,</span>

	<span>return</span> sin_term<span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre>

<p>In the vertex shader this value will be used as a parameter for the sin function which will result in a kinda wind like wave, you can see for yourself here in <a href="https://www.shadertoy.com/view/MXXXWj">shader toy</a></p><p>It's called <code>sin_term</code> because I'll pass it to sin function later in the vertex shader.</p><h4 id="pitch"><span>
      Pitch
    </span></h4><p>defines the angle of rotation around the UP axis, which is always <code>{0, 1, 0}</code> in our case the grass will always point upwards, so all we need is just an angle to construct a rotation matrix in the vertex shader. You can make this random or always face the camera or be controlled by the user whatever suits your needs.</p><h4 id="frustum-culling"><span>
      Frustum culling
    </span></h4><p>For the frustum culling, we start by generating a sphere around each blade the radius of the circle is determined by the max of height and width then we transform the sphere to camera space, at this point the distance from the camera is just the length of the point as in camera space the camera is at <code>0, 0, 0</code> we use this to apply the cutoff distance and choose LOD.</p><pre><code><span>float</span> radius <span>=</span> blade_height <span>&gt;=</span> blade_width <span>?</span> blade_height <span>:</span> blade_width<span>;</span>
<span>vec4</span> center <span>=</span> <span>vec4</span><span>(</span>pos<span>,</span> <span>1.0</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
center<span>.</span>x <span>+=</span> <span>(</span>blade_width <span>/</span> <span>2</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
center<span>.</span>y <span>+=</span> <span>(</span>blade_height <span>/</span> <span>2</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

center <span>=</span> pc<span>.</span>per_frame<span>.</span>view <span>*</span> center<span>;</span>

<span>// cut off distance</span>
<span>//We are in view space .. camera at 0, 0, 0;</span>
<span>float</span> dist_from_cam <span>=</span> <span>distance</span><span>(</span>center<span>.</span>xyz<span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>const</span> <span>float</span> cutoff_dist <span>=</span> <span>800</span><span>;</span>

<span>bool</span> low_lod <span>=</span> <span>(</span>dist_from_cam <span>&gt;</span> low_lod_dist<span>)</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre>

<p>then the frustum culling we kinda doing the projection by hand and then check if the sphere is in range, I only do culling on the x and y axes as for the z axis we already have a cutoff but adding that is also trivial. I learned this way of culling on <a href="https://youtu.be/NGGzk4Fi2iU?t=6962">Arseny Kapoulkine's stream</a> they explain it much better but basically, we extract the left or right plane(we need just one of them) and the top or bottom plane then on the GPU we calculate the dot product between the sphere center and planes while taking the abs of the x component of the center of the sphere to do the culling on both sides at same time utilizing its symmetry.</p><pre><code><span>// the dot product with x/z components of the x plain normal</span>

	center<span>.</span>z <span>*</span> frustum<span>[</span><span>1</span><span>]</span> <span>+</span> <span>abs</span><span>(</span>center<span>.</span>x<span>)</span> <span>*</span> frustum<span>[</span><span>0</span><span>]</span> <span>&lt;</span> radius<span>;</span>

</code></pre>

<p>After that, we fill the blade info in the respective index in the blades data buffer</p><pre><code><span>uint</span> buf_index <span>=</span> pc<span>.</span>blades_number<span>.</span>x <span>*</span> i<span>.</span>y <span>+</span> i<span>.</span>x<span>;</span>

</code></pre>

<h4 id="draw-command-buffers"><span>
      Draw Command Buffers
    </span></h4><p>After generating the data we can fill the command buffer, each thread will atomically increase the number of instances in the <a href="https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/1.3-extensions/man/html/VkDrawIndirectCommand.html">commands buffer</a> this allows us to know to use the instance count as an index in another buffer to store the indices of the visible blades which allows us to access the values using <code>gl_InstaceIndex</code> we can also copy the buffer and sort using prefix sum scan just like Acerola in his video but this is better memory-wise and probably performance wise but I didn't measure performance. in summary, the vertex shader will use <code>gl_InstaceIndex</code> to index into a buffer that contains the indices of the visible grass blades.</p><p><img src="https://www.thegeeko.me/images/foliage-buffers.png" alt="diagram showing the buffers layout"></p><p>The compute shader makes use of 2 indirect draw commands one for high LOD and other for low LOD we can add as many LOD levels as we want, and we check if it's low LOD or high and then increase <code>gl_InstanceIndex</code> in the respective command buffer.</p><pre><code><span>// cmd_buf[0] is high LOD</span>
<span>// cmd_buf[1] is low LOD</span>
<span>bool</span> low_lod <span>=</span> dist_from_cam <span>&gt;</span> low_lod_dist<span>;</span>

		<span>1</span>
	<span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre>

<p>after that, we use <code>index_in_visible</code> to index into the visible blades indices buffer and store the index of the current grass blade.</p><pre><code><span>// pc.visible is the buffer ref of the visible high LOD buffers</span>
<span>// pc.visible_low_lod is the buffer ref of the visible low LOD buffers</span>
DrawIndices indices <span>=</span> low_lod <span>?</span> pc<span>.</span>visible_low_lod <span>:</span> pc<span>.</span>visible<span>;</span>
indices<span>.</span>i<span>[</span>index_in_visible<span>]</span> <span>=</span> buf_index<span>;</span>
<span>// buf_index is the index of the grass blade.</span>
</code></pre>

<p>Now we have our indices data in a continuous buffer to index into using <code>gl_InstanceIndex</code> and <code>gl_DrawID</code> to determine which indices buffer to read from. We are ready to draw the grass blades.</p><h3 id="rendering"><span>
      Rendering
    </span></h3><p>In the vertex shader we start by pulling the Blade data respective to the current instance.</p><pre><code>DrawIndices visible <span>=</span> gl_DrawID <span>==</span> <span>1</span> <span>?</span> pc<span>.</span>visible_low_lod <span>:</span> pc<span>.</span>visible<span>;</span>

GrassBlade blade <span>=</span> pc<span>.</span>grass<span>.</span>data<span>[</span>i_visible<span>]</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre>

<p>After that, we construct a rotation matrix and apply the height and width multiplier.</p><pre><code><span>float</span> sin_pitch <span>=</span> <span>sin</span><span>(</span>blade<span>.</span>anim_size<span>.</span>z<span>)</span><span>;</span>

</code></pre>

<p>Then we use the sin term to animate the grass blade using a sin function we scroll with time and the height of the vertex because naturally the tip of of the grass blade skew more than the base.</p><pre><code><span>float</span> sin_term <span>=</span> blade<span>.</span>anim_size<span>.</span>w<span>;</span>

pos<span>.</span>z <span>+=</span> bend <span>*</span> pos<span>.</span>y<span>;</span>
</code></pre>

<p>here is how it looks</p><p>

</p><p>For the color, I opted for a simple gradient that goes brighter as it gets higher. I plan to improve this for example using normals for the grass also add some specular lighting as it could look really nice for example like Ghost of Tsushima's grass.</p><h3 id="optimization"><span>
      Optimization
    </span></h3><p>The simplest thing I thought of was just to reduce the amount of the work the vertex shader does since it will run millions of times a low hanging fruit was multiplying the projection and view matrix on the CPU and have it ready for the vertex shader, the next thing we can do is optimize the grass blade mesh I've used <a href="https://github.com/zeux/meshoptimizer">Mesh Optimizer</a> by Arseny Kapoulkine I used it and did multiple optimizations and the one who had the most impact was converting the grass blade from a triangle list to a triangle strip that reduced the number of vertex shader invocations drastically and almost cut the vertex shader work in half and the shape of the grass blade can be represented nicely as a strip.</p><h4 id="very-rough-numbers"><span>

<h2><span>Under the hood</span></h2>
<p><span>Our newer AI clusters build upon the successes and lessons learned from RSC. We focused on building end-to-end AI systems with a major emphasis on researcher and developer experience and productivity. The efficiency of the high-performance network fabrics within these clusters, some of the key storage decisions, combined with the 24,576 NVIDIA Tensor Core H100 GPUs in each, allow both cluster versions to support models larger and more complex than that could be supported in the RSC and pave the way for advancements in GenAI product development and AI research.</span></p>
<h3><span>Network</span></h3>
<p><span>At Meta, we handle hundreds of trillions of AI model executions per day. Delivering these services at a large scale requires a highly advanced and flexible infrastructure. Custom designing much of our own hardware, software, and network fabrics allows us to optimize the end-to-end experience for our AI researchers while ensuring our data centers operate efficiently.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>With this in mind, we built one cluster with a remote direct memory access (RDMA) over converged Ethernet (RoCE) network fabric solution based on the </span><a href="https://www.arista.com/assets/data/pdf/Datasheets/7800R3-Data-Sheet.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Arista 7800</span></a><span> with </span><a href="https://engineering.fb.com/2021/11/09/data-center-engineering/ocp-summit-2021/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Wedge400</span></a><span> and </span><a href="https://engineering.fb.com/2021/11/09/data-center-engineering/ocp-summit-2021/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Minipack2</span></a><span> OCP rack switches. The other cluster features an </span><a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/networking/quantum2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>NVIDIA Quantum2 InfiniBand</span></a><span> fabric. Both of these solutions interconnect 400 Gbps endpoints. With these two, we are able to assess the suitability and scalability of these </span><a href="https://engineering.fb.com/2023/11/15/networking-traffic/watch-metas-engineers-on-building-network-infrastructure-for-ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>different types of interconnect for large-scale training,</span></a><span> giving us more insights that will help inform how we design and build even larger, scaled-up clusters in the future. Through careful co-design of the network, software, and model architectures, we have successfully used both RoCE and InfiniBand clusters for large, GenAI workloads (including our ongoing training of Llama 3 on our RoCE cluster) without any network bottlenecks.</span></p>
<h3><span>Compute</span></h3>
<p><span>Both clusters are built using</span> <a href="https://engineering.fb.com/2022/10/18/open-source/ocp-summit-2022-grand-teton/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Grand Teton</span></a><span>, our in-house-designed, open GPU hardware platform that we’ve contributed to the Open Compute Project (OCP). Grand Teton builds on the many generations of AI systems that integrate power, control, compute, and fabric interfaces into a single chassis for better overall performance, signal integrity, and thermal performance. It provides rapid scalability and flexibility in a simplified design, allowing it to be quickly deployed into data center fleets and easily maintained and scaled. Combined with other in-house innovations like our</span> <a href="https://engineering.fb.com/2022/10/18/open-source/ocp-summit-2022-grand-teton/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Open Rack</span></a><span> power and rack architecture, Grand Teton allows us to build new clusters in a way that is purpose-built for current and future applications at Meta.</span></p>
<p><span>We have been openly designing our GPU hardware platforms beginning with our </span><a href="https://engineering.fb.com/2015/12/10/ml-applications/facebook-to-open-source-ai-hardware-design/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Big Sur platform in 2015</span></a><span>.</span></p>
<h3><span>Storage</span></h3>
<p><span>Storage plays an important role in AI training, and yet is one of the least talked-about aspects. As the GenAI training jobs become more multimodal over time, consuming large amounts of image, video, and text data, the need for data storage grows rapidly. The need to fit all that data storage into a performant, yet power-efficient footprint doesn’t go away though, which makes the problem more interesting.</span></p>
<p><span>Our storage deployment addresses the data and checkpointing needs of the AI clusters via a home-grown Linux Filesystem in Userspace (FUSE) API backed by a version of Meta’s </span><a href="https://www.usenix.org/conference/fast21/presentation/pan" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>‘Tectonic’ distributed storage solution</span></a><span> optimized for Flash media. This solution enables thousands of GPUs to save and load checkpoints in a synchronized fashion (a </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thundering_herd_problem#:~:text=In%20computer%20science%2C%20the%20thundering,able%20to%20handle%20the%20event."><span>challenge</span></a><span> for any storage solution) while also providing a flexible and high-throughput exabyte scale storage required for data loading.</span></p>
<p><span>We have also partnered with </span><a href="https://hammerspace.com/software/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Hammerspace</span></a><span> to co-develop and land a parallel network file system (NFS) deployment to meet the developer experience requirements for this AI cluster. Among other benefits, Hammerspace enables engineers to perform interactive debugging for jobs using thousands of GPUs as code changes are immediately accessible to all nodes within the environment. When paired together, the combination of our Tectonic distributed storage solution and Hammerspace enable fast iteration velocity without compromising on scale.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The storage deployments in our GenAI clusters, both Tectonic- and Hammerspace-backed, are based on the </span><a href="https://www.opencompute.org/documents/e1s-expansion-2ou-1s-server-design-specification-pdf"><span>YV3 Sierra Point server platform</span></a><span>, upgraded with the latest high capacity E1.S SSD we can procure in the market today. Aside from the higher SSD capacity, the servers per rack was customized to achieve the right balance of throughput capacity per server, rack count reduction, and associated power efficiency. Utilizing the OCP servers as Lego-like building blocks, our storage layer is able to flexibly scale to future requirements in this cluster as well as in future, bigger AI clusters, while being fault-tolerant to day-to-day Infrastructure maintenance operations.</span></p>
<h3><span>Performance</span></h3>
<p><span>One of the principles we have in building our large-scale AI clusters is to maximize performance and ease of use simultaneously without compromising one for the other. This is an important principle in creating the best-in-class AI models.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>As we push the limits of AI systems, the best way we can test our ability to scale-up our designs is to simply build a system, optimize it, and actually test it (while simulators help, they only go so far). In this design journey, we compared the performance seen in our small clusters and with large clusters to see where our bottlenecks are. In the graph below, AllGather collective performance is shown (as normalized bandwidth on a 0-100 scale) when a large number of GPUs are communicating with each other at message sizes where roofline performance is expected.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Our out-of-box performance for large clusters was initially poor and inconsistent, compared to optimized small cluster performance. To address this we made several changes to how our internal job scheduler schedules jobs with network topology awareness – this resulted in latency benefits and minimized the amount of traffic going to upper layers of the network. We also optimized our network routing strategy in combination with NVIDIA Collective Communications Library (NCCL) changes to achieve optimal network utilization. This helped push our large clusters to achieve great and expected performance just as our small clusters.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_21048" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-21048"><img decoding="async" src="https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Meta-24K-GenAi-clusters-performance.png?w=1024" alt="" width="1024" height="768" srcset="https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Meta-24K-GenAi-clusters-performance.png 1999w, https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Meta-24K-GenAi-clusters-performance.png?resize=916,687 916w, https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Meta-24K-GenAi-clusters-performance.png?resize=768,576 768w, https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Meta-24K-GenAi-clusters-performance.png?resize=1024,768 1024w, https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Meta-24K-GenAi-clusters-performance.png?resize=1536,1152 1536w, https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Meta-24K-GenAi-clusters-performance.png?resize=96,72 96w, https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Meta-24K-GenAi-clusters-performance.png?resize=192,144 192w" sizes="(max-width: 992px) 100vw, 62vw"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-21048">In the figure we see that small cluster performance (overall communication bandwidth and utilization) reaches 90%+ out of the box, but an unoptimized large cluster performance has very poor utilization, ranging from 10% to 90%. After we optimize the full system (software, network, etc.), we see large cluster performance return to the ideal 90%+ range.</figcaption></figure>
<p><span>In addition to software changes targeting our internal infrastructure, we worked closely with teams authoring training frameworks and models to adapt to our evolving infrastructure. For example, NVIDIA H100 GPUs open the possibility of leveraging new data types such as 8-bit floating point (FP8) for training. Fully utilizing larger clusters required investments in additional parallelization techniques and new storage solutions provided opportunities to highly optimize checkpointing across thousands of ranks to run in hundreds of milliseconds.</span></p>
<p><span>We also recognize debuggability as one of the major challenges in large-scale training. Identifying a problematic GPU that is stalling an entire training job becomes very difficult at a large scale. We’re building tools such as desync debug, or a distributed collective flight recorder, to expose the details of distributed training, and help identify issues in a much faster and easier way</span></p>
<p><span>Finally, we’re continuing to evolve PyTorch, the foundational AI framework powering our AI workloads, to make it ready for tens, or even hundreds, of thousands of GPU training. We have identified multiple bottlenecks for process group initialization, and reduced the startup time from sometimes hours down to minutes.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><span>Commitment to open AI innovation</span></h2>
<p><span>Meta maintains its commitment to open innovation in AI software and hardware. We believe open-source hardware and software will always be a valuable tool to help the industry solve problems at large scale.</span></p>
<p><span>Today, we continue to support</span><a href="https://engineering.fb.com/2022/10/18/open-source/ocp-summit-2022-grand-teton/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> <span>open hardware innovation</span></a><span> as a founding member of OCP, where we make designs like Grand Teton and Open Rack available to the OCP community. We also continue to be the largest and primary contributor to </span><a href="https://pytorch.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>PyTorch</span></a><span>, the AI software framework that is powering a large chunk of the industry.</span></p>
<p><span>We also continue to be committed to open innovation in the AI research community. We’ve launched the</span><a href="https://ai.meta.com/llama/open-innovation-ai-research-community" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> <span>Open Innovation AI Research Community</span></a><span>, a partnership program for academic researchers to deepen our understanding of how to responsibly develop and share AI technologies – with a particular focus on LLMs.</span></p>
<p><span>An open approach to AI is not new for Meta. We’ve also launched the </span><a href="https://ai.meta.com/blog/ai-alliance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>AI Alliance</span></a><span>, a group of leading organizations across the AI industry focused on accelerating responsible innovation in AI within an open community. Our AI efforts are built on a philosophy of open science and cross-collaboration. An open ecosystem brings transparency, scrutiny, and trust to AI development and leads to innovations that everyone can benefit from that are built with safety and responsibility top of mind.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><span>The future of Meta’s AI infrastructure</span></h2>
<p><span>These two AI training cluster designs are a part of our larger roadmap for the future of AI. By the end of 2024, we’re aiming to continue to grow our infrastructure build-out that will include 350,000 NVIDIA H100s as part of a portfolio that will feature compute power equivalent to nearly 600,000 H100s.</span></p>
<p><span>As we look to the future, we recognize that what worked yesterday or today may not be sufficient for tomorrow’s needs. That’s why we are constantly evaluating and improving every aspect of our infrastructure, from the physical and virtual layers to the software layer and beyond. Our goal is to create systems that are flexible and reliable to support the fast-evolving new models and research.&nbsp; </span></p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div fs-toc-offsettop="5rem" fs-toc-element="contents" id="w-node-_1f6dfb0a-a2b6-7b6c-63db-a502d9c255db-48ffd991"><p>Deterministic simulation testing is fast becoming the gold standard for how mission critical software is tested. Deterministic simulation testing was first popularized by the <a href="https://www.foundationdb.org/">FoundationDB</a> team who spent 18 months building a deterministic simulation framework for their database before ever letting it write or read data from an actual physical disk. The results speak for themselves: FoundationDB is widely considered to be one of the most robust and well-tested distributed databases, so much so that Kyle Kingsbury (of Jepsen fame) refused to test it because their deterministic simulator already stress tested FoundationDB more than the Jepsen framework ever could.</p><p>The WarpStream team utilized FoundationDB heavily at Datadog when we built <a href="https://www.datadoghq.com/blog/engineering/introducing-husky/">Husky, Datadog’s columnar storage engine for event data</a>. Over the course of our careers, our team has operated (and been on-call for) almost every database on the market: M3DB, etcd, ZooKeeper, Cassandra, Elasticsearch, Redis, MongoDB, MySQL, Postgres, Apache Kafka and more. In our experience, FoundationDB stands in a league of its own in terms of correctness and reliability due to its early investment in deterministic simulation testing.</p><p>A more recent example of a database system that leverages this approach to testing is <a href="https://tigerbeetle.com/">TigerBeetle</a>, a financial transactions database, that uses <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC1B3d9C_sI">deterministic simulation testing</a> to build one of the most robust financial OLTP databases available today.</p><p>When we were designing WarpStream, we knew that it wouldn’t be enough to just replace Apache Kafka with something cheaper and easier to operate. Kafka is the beating heart of many companies most critical infrastructure, and if we were to stand any chance of convincing those organizations to adopt WarpStream, we’d have to compress 12+ years of production hardening into a much shorter time frame. We accelerated this process with our architectural decision to rely on object storage as the <em>only</em> storage in the system, bypassing many of the tricky problems of ensuring data durability, availability, and replication at scale. Still, the fact that WarpStream leverages object storage is only a small part of ensuring the correctness of the overall system.</p><h2>Antithesis</h2><p>When we first heard about Antithesis, we could hardly contain our excitement. Antithesis has created the holy grail for testing distributed systems: a bespoke hypervisor that deterministically simulates an entire set of Docker containers and injects faults, <em>created by the same people who made FoundationDB</em>. For a group of gray-haired distributed systems engineers, seeing Antithesis in action felt like a tribe of cavemen stumbling upon a post-industrial revolution society. As we spoke more to the Antithesis team, an idea began to crystallize: we could use Antithesis to deterministically simulate not only WarpStream, but our entire SaaS!</p><figure><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/64baaecd9c5c9b1b6c38aa0e/65ef867803ca64e3d2e6587e_YVvFpLKTZhluuelHF7q2V7b9ABUwpO10pOj-_oj82XeYsh-liqTCnQ-1YCQQD3vAgzvuq5eY47zO76jW4YrCTehCmfw91o4UvoFtX2QlfEjJgTb_ZLzxcuB1rleAamm02bEho7kRdWKG0w86QxbWtG8.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>WarpStream was built differently than most traditional database products. It was designed from day one with a true data plane / control plane split. There are two primary components to WarpStream: First, the Agents (data plane) that act as “thick proxies” and expose the Kafka protocol to clients. The Agents also take care of all communication with object storage, layering in batching and caching to improve performance and keep costs low.</p><p>‍<br>Second is the WarpStream control plane which has two major components:</p><ol role="list"><li>The metadata store that tracks cluster metadata and performs remote consensus.</li><li>Our SaaS software that manages different tenants’ metadata stores, API keys, users, accounts, etc.</li></ol><p>The metadata store only has two dependencies:</p><ol role="list"><li>Any cloud KV store&nbsp;</li><li>Object storage</li></ol><p>The SaaS software adds one additional dependency: a traditional SQL database for managing users, organization, API keys, etc. Looking at WarpStream’s minimal dependencies, we thought, why not test its entire customer experience, from initial signup to running Kafka workloads?</p><p>We created a docker-compose file that contains the following components:</p><ol role="list"><li>Several WarpStream Agents</li><li>Several WarpStream Control Plane nodes</li><li>Several Apache Kafka clients</li><li>A KV store</li><li>Postgres</li><li>An object store (<a href="https://docs.localstack.cloud/user-guide/aws/s3/">localstack</a>)</li></ol><p>With the help of the Antithesis team, we wrote a test workload that started all of those services, signed up for a WarpStream account, created a virtual cluster, and then began producing and consuming data. The workload was carefully structured so that we could assert on a variety of different important properties that WarpStream must maintain at all times.</p><p>The test workload consists of multiple producers that are each assigned a unique ID and write records to a small set of topics. These producers synchronously write a few small JSON records that contain the producer’s ID, a counter (a monotonic sequence number for that producer), and a few other properties. We repeat the same components as the record’s key, value, and in a header to ensure we never shuffle those around accidentally. The consumer side of the workload polls all the topics and all the partitions and asserts that:</p><ol role="list"><li>The topic and partition the record was consumed from matches the topic and partition the record was produced to.</li><li>The offsets for each record in each partition are monotonic.</li><li>The sequence numbers for each producer are monotonic, i.e. if we group the records by &lt;Topic, Partition, ProducerID&gt; the sequence number encoded in the record is monotonically increasing.</li></ol><p>The consumers store all of the records for each polling iteration and can assert that a record at offset X in the previous poll still exists in a future poll. This ensures that WarpStream doesn't lose or reorder data as e.g. background compaction runs to reorganize the cluster’s data for more efficient access.</p><p>These assertions address many of the classes of bugs found in previous Jepsen tests of Apache Kafka and other Kafka-compatible systems. For example, prior Jepsen tests have caught bugs like:</p><ol role="list"><li>Loss of previously acknowledged writes. If a write was acknowledged but failed to appear in the output for that topic-partition in the future, assertion 1 or 3 above would fire.</li><li>Violation of producer idempotency (i.e producing duplicate records without the producer itself crashing or restarting).&nbsp; Antithesis automatically tests our Idempotent Producer implementation by disrupting the network between the producer client and the agent or the agent and the control plane, leading to internal retries inside the Kafka client. A duplicate would cause the sequence number from a producer to stay the same or decrease, causing assertion 3 above to fire.</li><li>Records appearing in different topic-partitions than they were originally written to. This is addressed by assertions 1 or 3 above.</li></ol><h2>What’s the big deal?</h2><p>At this point you might be scratching your head a little bit and wondering: “What’s the big deal here? Isn’t this just a really fancy integration test!?”. Yes and no. Before we started using Antithesis, WarpStream already had a pretty robust set of stress tests we called the “correctness tests”.</p><p>These tests do essentially everything we just described, but in a regular CI environment. Our correctness tests even inject faults all over the WarpStream stack using a custom chaos injection library that we wrote. These tests are incredibly powerful, and they caught a <em>lot</em> of bugs. We would go as far as saying that investing deeply in those correctness tests is one of the main reasons that we were able to develop WarpStream as efficiently as we did.</p><p>Just like our existing correctness tests, the Antithesis hypervisor automatically injects faults, latency, thread hangs, and restarts into the workload. However, unlike our correctness tests, the Antithesis hypervisor is <em>really smart</em> and automatically fuzzes the system under test in an intelligent way.</p><p>Antithesis automatically instruments your software to measure code coverage and build statistics about the execution frequency of each code path. This enables Antithesis to detect “interesting” behavior in the test (such as infrequent code paths getting exercised, or rare log messages being emitted).</p><p>When Antithesis detects interesting or rare behavior, it immediately snapshots the state of the entire system before exploring various different execution branches. This means that Antithesis is <em>much</em> better at triggering rare or unlikely behavior in WarpStream than our existing correctness tests were.</p><p>Also, since Antithesis runs the entire software stack in a deterministic simulator, they can actually run the simulation at <em>faster than wall clock time</em>. Similar to FoundationDB, WarpStream makes heavy use of timers and batching to improve performance. Anytime a WarpStream Goroutine does the equivalent of time.Sleep(), the Antithesis hypervisor <em>doesn’t actually have to wait</em>. On top of that, the Antithesis hypervisor explores code branches <em>concurrently</em>. All of this adds up in a meaningful way such that Antithesis can cost effectively compress years of stress testing into a much shorter time frame.</p><p>It’s hard to over-emphasize just how transformative this technology is for building distributed systems. For all intents and purposes, it really does feel like a time-traveler arrived from 20 years in the future and gave us their state of the art software testing technology. Of course, it’s not <em>actually</em> magic. Antithesis is the result of dozens of the smartest software engineers, statisticians, and machine learning experts pouring their heart and souls into the problem of software testing for 5 years straight. But to us mere mortals, it does feel a lot like magic.</p><h2>We found some bugs</h2><p>Let’s look at a few example runs that Antithesis generated for us.</p><figure><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/64baaecd9c5c9b1b6c38aa0e/65f066a2ce79a8d23436120b_antithesis%20report%20final.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>Antithesis ran the WarpStream workload for 6 wall clock hours, during which it simulated 280 hours of application time. The graph shows that it took about 160 “application hours” for Antithesis to “stall” and stop discovering new “behaviors” in the WarpStream workload. This means that running the tests for longer than 160 hours has diminishing returns, and instead we should invest in making the test itself more sophisticated if we want to exercise the codebase more. Great feedback for us!</p><p>But think about that for a moment: even after 140 hours of injecting faults, randomizing thread execution, automatically detecting that something interesting / rare had happened and intentionally branching to investigate further, Antithesis was still “discovering” new behaviors in WarpStream. We could hire a 100 distributed systems engineers and make them write integration tests for an entire year, and they probably wouldn’t be able to trigger all the interesting states and behavior that a single Antithesis run covered in 6 hours of wall clock time.</p><p>As just one example of how powerful this is, on the first day we started using Antithesis it caught a data race in our metrics instrumentation library that had been present since the first month of the project.</p><figure><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/64baaecd9c5c9b1b6c38aa0e/65f0668f355b0f7639cbe921_antithesis%20data%20race%20final.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>Our correctness tests had run in our regular CI workflows for literally <em>10s of thousands of hours</em> by then, with the Go race detector enabled, and not once ever caught this bug. Antithesis caught this bug in its first 233 seconds of execution.</p><p>A data race in the instrumentation library isn’t that exciting, though. What about an extremely rare data loss bug that is the result of both a network failure and a race condition? That’s more exciting!</p><p>To minimize the number of S3 PUTs that WarpStream users have to pay for, the Agents buffer Kafka Produce requests from many different clients in-memory for ~250ms before combining the batches of data into a single file and flushing it to object storage.</p><figure><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/64baaecd9c5c9b1b6c38aa0e/65ef86782ecf7975e9265e8b_eWyuN7USMfacq1cJSUWU9OuqagABl_7ImESBFKyhTiGiotejnSXeO40xn2oydgktnAU8HJpYK8RowxiR2iy3lZ4aTyiGSV6pJNNJTkHvuc6C9D4v75TnjrZj5JHygYuahZDF9BBnBUvuaz8tZyIZfvg.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>In some scenarios, like if write throughput is high, there will be multiple outstanding files being flushed to object storage concurrently. Once flushing the files succeeds, committing the metadata for the flushed files to the control plane can be batched to reduce networking overhead. This is implemented using a background Goroutine that periodically scans the list of “flushed but not yet committed” files.</p><p>While refactoring the Agent to add speculative retries for flushing files to object storage, we subtly broke the error handling on this path so that, for a very brief window of time, a file which failed to flush would be considered successful and ready to commit to the control plane metadata store. In program order (i.e. the linear flow of the code, ignoring concurrency) this window where the background Goroutine that commits metadata would see the successful file would be nearly impossible to squeeze into. This background Goroutine only polls for successful files every five milliseconds, and the time between the two state transitions in the common case would be less than a microsecond!</p><figure><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/64baaecd9c5c9b1b6c38aa0e/65ef8757b0bcd3c9f824e5a8_Frame%2042%20(7).png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>This bug is the manifestation of two unlikely events: a file failing to flush and a specific thread interleaving that should be extremely rare in practice. Despite how unlikely these events are to occur together, on a long enough time-scale, this bug would have resulted in data loss at some point.</p><p>Instead, thanks to Antithesis’ powerful fuzzer and fault injector, this rare combination of events happened roughly once per wall clock hour of testing. We’d been running a build with this bug in our staging environment and obviously did not encounter that bug at all, let alone once per hour, as it would’ve immediately been noticed when a future background compaction failed due to the missing file in object storage. We’ve since fixed the regression in the code such that the invalid, temporary state transition cannot occur.</p><h2>Why not Jepsen?</h2><p>The obvious question you might be asking yourself at this point is: Why use Antithesis instead of a traditional Jepsen test? It’s a good question, and one we asked ourselves before embarking on our journey with Antithesis.</p><p>We’re big fans of Jepsen and have consumed almost every published report. However, after speaking with the Antithesis team and spending a few months integrating with it, we feel strongly that deterministic simulation testing with tools like Antithesis is a much more robust and sustainable path forward for the industry. Specifically, we think that the Antithesis’ approach is better than Jepsen’s for a few reasons:</p><ol role="list"><li>The Antithesis technology is more robust, and much more likely to catch bugs than the Jepsen harness. There is simply no other equivalent (that we’re aware of) to Antithesis’ custom hypervisor, and its ability to automatically instrument distributed systems for code coverage and effectively “hunt” for bugs. Yes, the Jepsen framework will inject faults into a running environment in an effort to trigger bugs and edge-case behavior, but this approach is crude in comparison to what Antithesis does.</li><li>Antithesis integrates natively into how our engineers are used to working. The entire test setup is expressed using standard docker-compose files and Docker images, and Antithesis tests are kicked off using Github Actions that push WarpStream images to Antithesis’ docker registry. When we add new functionality, all our engineers have to do is modify the Antithesis workload and kick off an automated CI job. The entire experience and workflow lives right next to our existing codebase, CI, and workflows. Extra bonus: none of our engineers had to learn Clojure.</li><li>Antithesis testing is designed to be a continuous process with accompanying professional services that help you grow and adapt the tests as the scope of your product increases. That means our users get the confidence that every WarpStream release is actively tested with Antithesis, unlike a traditional Jepsen test where the engagement is short-lived and usually only covers a “snapshot” of a system at a static point in time.</li><li>Finally, it would not have been practical to continuously test our entire SaaS platform with Jepsen in the same way that we do with Antithesis. While that may seem like overkill, we think it’s a pretty important point. For example, consider the fact that almost every cloud infrastructure provider has a routing or proxy layer that is responsible for routing customer requests to the correct set of infrastructure that hosts the customer’s resources. A small data race or caching bug in that routing layer could result in exposing one customer’s resources to a different customer. These multi-tenant SaaS layers are never tested in traditional Jepsen testing, but with Antithesis it was actually easier to include these layers in our testing than to specifically exclude them.</li></ol><p>We’re just getting started with Antithesis! Over the coming months we plan to work with the Antithesis team to expand our testing footprint to cover additional functionality like:</p><ol role="list"><li>Multi-region deployments of our SaaS platform.</li><li><a href="https://docs.warpstream.com/warpstream/configuration/deploy/splitting-agent-roles">Multi-role Agent Clusters</a>.</li><li>Injecting and detecting data corruption at the storage and file cache layer using checksums.</li><li>And much more!</li></ol><p>If you’d like to learn more about WarpStream, please <a href="https://www.warpstream.com/contact-us">contact us</a>, or <a href="https://console.warpstream.com/socials/slack">join our Slack!</a></p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><header><h2>A four-day forecast today is as accurate as a one-day forecast 30 years ago.</h2></header><p>Weather forecasts are often seen as just a nice thing to have. Useful when planning a Sunday barbecue, or when we want to know if we’ll need an umbrella for the day. But in many ways weather forecasts are absolutely crucial: they can be a matter of life and death.</p><p>Accurate forecasts can save lives by giving early warnings of storms, heat waves, and disasters. Farmers use them for agricultural management, which can make the difference between a lost harvest or a harvest of plenty. Grid operators rely on accurate forecasts of temperatures for heating and cooling demand, and how much energy they’ll get from wind and solar farms. Pilots and sailors need them to carry people across oceans safely. Accurate information about future weather is often absolutely vital.</p><p>In this article, I look at improvements over time and the global inequalities that need to be closed to protect lives and livelihoods around the world.</p><h2 id="weather-forecasts-have-improved-a-lot">Weather forecasts have improved a lot<a href="#weather-forecasts-have-improved-a-lot"></a></h2><p>Weather forecasting has come a long way. In 650 B.C. the Babylonians would try to predict weather patterns based on cloud patterns and movements. Three centuries later, Aristotle wrote <em>Meteorologica</em>, discussing how phenomena such as rain, hail, hurricanes, and lightning formed. Much of it turned out to be wrong, but it represents one of the first attempts to explain how the weather works in detail.</p><p>It wasn’t until 1859 that the UK’s Meteorological Service (the Met Office) <a href="https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/about-us/who/our-history" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">issued its first</a> weather forecast for shipping. Two years later, it broadcasted its first public weather forecast. While meteorological measurements improved over time, the massive step-change in predictions came with the use of computerized numerical modeling. This didn’t start until a century later, in the 1960s.</p><p>Forecasts have improved a lot since then. We can see this across a range of measurements, and different national meteorological organizations.</p><p>The Met Office <a href="https://blog.metoffice.gov.uk/2023/11/15/why-an-exact-date-weather-forecast-headline-isnt-what-it-seems/#:~:text=Despite%20the%20certainty%20suggested%20in,come%20with%20in%2Dbuilt%20uncertainty." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">says</a> its four-day forecasts are now as accurate as its one-day forecasts were 30 years ago.</p><p>Predictions have gotten much better in the United States, too. We can see this in some of the most important forecasts: the prediction of hurricanes.</p><p>The National Hurricane Center <a href="https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/verification/verify5.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">publishes data</a> on the “track error” of hurricanes and cyclones — the error in <em>where</em> the hurricane hits. This is shown in the chart below, from the 1960s onwards.</p><p>Each line represents the error of forecasts for different time periods in advance. For example, 12 hours before it hits, all the way up to 120 hours (or 5 days) before.</p><p>We can see that this track error — especially for longer-term forecasts — has decreased a lot over time. In the 1970s, a 48-hour forecast had an error between 200 and 400 nautical miles; today this is around 50 nautical miles.</p><p>We can show the same data another way. In the chart below, each line represents the average error for each decade. On the horizontal axis we have the forecast period, again extending from 0 to 120 hours.</p><p>The 72-hour error in the 1960s and 70s was over 400 nautical miles. Today, it’s less than 80 miles.</p><p>Meteorologists can now make pretty accurate predictions of where a hurricane will hit three or four days in advance, which lets cities and communities prepare while preventing unnecessary evacuations that might have been implemented in the past.</p><figure><picture><source srcset="https://ourworldindata.org/images/published/hurricane-forecasting-error_100.png 100w, https://ourworldindata.org/images/published/hurricane-forecasting-error_350.png 350w, https://ourworldindata.org/images/published/hurricane-forecasting-error_850.png 850w, https://ourworldindata.org/images/published/hurricane-forecasting-error_1350.png 1350w, https://ourworldindata.org/images/published/hurricane-forecasting-error_7963.png 7963w" type="image/png" sizes="(max-width: 960px) 95vw, (min-width: 960px) 853px"><img src="https://ourworldindata.org/images/published/hurricane-forecasting-error.png" alt="Line chart showing the reduction in hurricane forecasting errors from the 1960s to the 2020s.

While national weather agencies use much higher-resolution processing to get local forecasts, these global models provide a crucial input into these systems.</p><p>The ECMWF publishes analyses of its errors over time. This is shown in the chart below.<a href="#note-1"><sup>1</sup></a> It shows the difference between the forecast and the actual weather outcome for forecasts 3, 5, 7, and 10 days in advance. The metric used here is the “<a href="https://climate.copernicus.eu/esotc/2022/atmospheric-circulation" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">500 hPa geopotential height</a>”, a commonly used meteorological measure of air pressure (which dictates weather patterns).</p><p>The solid line is for the Northern Hemisphere, and the dashed line is for the Southern.</p><p>Three-day forecasts —&nbsp;shown in blue — have been pretty accurate since the 1980s, and have still gotten a lot better over time. Today the accuracy is around 97%.</p><p>The biggest improvements we’ve seen are for longer timeframes. By the early 2000s, 5-day forecasts were “highly accurate” and 7-day forecasts are reaching that threshold today. 10-day forecasts aren’t quite there yet but are getting better.</p><figure><picture><source srcset="https://ourworldindata.org/images/published/improved-weather-forecasting_100.png 100w, https://ourworldindata.org/images/published/improved-weather-forecasting_350.png 350w, https://ourworldindata.org/images/published/improved-weather-forecasting_850.png 850w, https://ourworldindata.org/images/published/improved-weather-forecasting_1350.png 1350w, https://ourworldindata.org/images/published/improved-weather-forecasting_7463.png 7463w" type="image/png" sizes="(max-width: 960px) 95vw, (min-width: 960px) 853px"><img src="https://ourworldindata.org/images/published/improved-weather-forecasting.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="7463" height="NaN"></picture></figure><h2 id="why-have-weather-forecasts-improved">Why have weather forecasts improved?<a href="#why-have-weather-forecasts-improved"></a></h2><p>A few key developments <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aav7274" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">explain these improvements</a>.<a href="#note-2"><sup>2</sup></a></p><p>The first big change is that the data has improved. More extensive and higher-resolution observations can be used as inputs into the weather models. This is because we have more and better satellite data, and because land-based stations are covering many more areas around the globe, and at a higher density. The precision of these instruments has improved, too.</p><p>These observations are then fed into numerical prediction models to forecast the weather. That brings us to the next two developments. The computers on which these models are run have gotten much faster. Faster speeds are crucial: the Met Office now chunks the world into grids of smaller and smaller squares. While they once modeled the world in 90-kilometer-wide squares, they are now down to a grid of 1.5-kilometer squares. That means many more calculations need to be run to get this high-resolution map. The methods to turn the observations into model outputs have also improved. We’ve gone from very simple visions of the world to methods that can capture the complexity of these systems in detail.</p><p>The final crucial factor is how these forecasts are communicated. Not long ago, you could only get daily updates in the daily newspaper. With the rise of radio and TV, you could get a few notices per day. Now, we can get minute-by-minute updates online or on our smartphones.</p><h2 id="low-income-countries-have-much-worse-forecasts-and-often-no-early-warning-systems">Low-income countries have much worse forecasts, and often no early warning systems<a href="#low-income-countries-have-much-worse-forecasts-and-often-no-early-warning-systems"></a></h2><p>At home in Scotland, I can open an app on my phone and get a pretty accurate 5-day forecast within seconds. Unfortunately, this quality of information isn’t available to everyone. There are large differences in weather forecasts across the world, with a large gap between rich and poor.</p><p>As the researchers Manuel Linsenmeier and Jeffrey Shrader report in a <a href="https://ideas.repec.org/p/osf/socarx/7e2jf.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">recent paper</a>, a 7-day forecast in a rich country can be more accurate than a one-day forecast in some low-income ones.<a href="#note-3"><sup>3</sup></a></p><p>While national forecasts have improved over time across all income levels, the quality gap today is almost as wide as it was in the 1980s.</p><p>There are a few reasons for this. First, far fewer land-based instruments and radiosondes measure meteorological data in poorer countries. Second, the frequency of reporting is much lower.</p><p>This is unsurprising when we look at the amount of money spent on weather and climate information. In <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.1602632" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a paper</a> published in <em>Science</em>, Lucian Georgeson, Mark Maslin, and Martyn Poessinouw looked at differences in spending across income groups.<a href="#note-4"><sup>4</sup></a> This includes private and public spending on commercial products that fall within the definition of “weather and climate information services”.</p><p>This is shown as the spending <em>per person</em>, and the spending as a share of gross domestic product (GDP) in the chart below.</p><p>Low-income countries spend 15 to 20 times less per person than high-income countries. But given the size of their economies, they actually spend <em>more</em> as a share of GDP.</p><p>This gap is a problem. 60% of workers in low-income countries are <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/share-of-the-labor-force-employed-in-agriculture?tab=chart&amp;country=Low+income~High+income">employed in agriculture</a>, arguably the most weather-dependent sector. Most <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/africa-yields-problem" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">are small-scale farmers</a>, who are often extremely poor.</p><p>Having accurate weather forecasts can help farmers make better decisions. They can get information on the best time to plant their crops. They know in advance when irrigation will be most needed, or when fertilizers might be at risk of being washed away. They can receive alerts about pest and disease outbreaks so they can either protect their crops when an attack is coming or save pesticides when the risk is low. That means they can use precious resources most efficiently if they have access to accurate weather forecasts. Good weather forecasts are most crucial for the poorest people in the world.</p><p>They’re also crucial for protecting against cyclones, heat waves, flooding, and storm surges. Having accurate forecasts several days in advance allows cities and communities to prepare. Housing can be protected, and emergency services can be on standby to help with the recovery.</p><p>But accurate forecasts alone don’t solve the problem: they’re only useful if they are disseminated to people so they can respond. Many of the deadliest disasters over the last few decades <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212096322000687" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">were accurately forecasted</a> ahead of time. The common failure was poor communication.<a href="#note-5"><sup>5</sup></a></p><p>Improving forecasts is the foundation. But these also need to be incorporated into effective early warning systems. The World Meteorological Organization <a href="https://documents1.worldbank.org/curated/en/099050123155016375/pdf/P1765160197f400b80947e0af8c48049151.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">estimates that</a> around one-third of the world — predominantly the poorest countries — do not have them.</p><h2 id="improving-forecasts-especially-in-low-income-countries-is-underrated">Improving forecasts — especially in low-income countries — is underrated<a href="#improving-forecasts-especially-in-low-income-countries-is-underrated"></a></h2><p>After the big progress in recent decades, we take good weather forecasting and dissemination for granted in large parts of the world. Making this available to everyone would make a difference.</p><p>This will be even more important as climate change increases the risks of weather-related disasters. It is ultimately the poorest, who are the more vulnerable, who will suffer the worst consequences. Better forecasts are key to good climate change adaptation.</p><p>Proper investment and financial support will be essential to close the gaps.</p><p>There also emerging technologies that could accelerate this. A <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06185-3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">recent paper</a> published in <em>Nature </em>documented a new <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/artificial-intelligence" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">artificial intelligence (AI)</a> system — Pangu-Weather — that can perform forecasts as accurately (or better) than leading meteorological agencies up to 10,000 times faster.<a href="#note-6"><sup>6</sup></a> It was trained on 39 years of historical data. The speed of these forecasts would make them much cheaper to run and could provide much better results for countries with limited budgets.</p><p>Faster and more efficient technologies can also fill the gaps where land-based weather stations aren’t available. Sensor-carrying drones can run surveys over specific areas to build higher-resolution maps. With lower-cost and more efficient ways of turning that into forecasts, mobile technologies can disseminate this information quickly. Some companies are already sending messages to farmers in low-income countries to advise them on the best time to plant their crops.</p><p>This innovation is crucial to making countries more resilient to weather today. But it’s also essential in a world where weather is likely to get more extreme.</p><div><h4>Acknowledgements</h4><p>Many thanks to Max Roser and Edouard Mathieu for their valuable feedback and comments on this article.</p></div><div><h3 id="article-endnotes">Endnotes</h3><ol><li id="note-1"><p>These charts are sourced from the following sources: Alley, R.

																			<div><p>We’re providing more flexibility for developers who distribute apps in the European Union (EU), including introducing a new way to distribute apps directly from a developer’s website.</p><h3>More flexibility</h3><p>Developers who’ve agreed to the Alternative Terms Addendum for Apps in the EU have new options for their apps in the EU:</p><ul>
<li>Alternative app marketplaces. Marketplaces can choose to offer a catalog of apps solely from the developer of the marketplace.</li>
<li>Linking out to purchase. When directing users to complete a transaction for digital goods or services on an external webpage, developers can choose how to design promotions, discounts, and other deals. The Apple-provided design templates, which are optimized for key purchase and promotional use cases, are now optional. </li>
</ul><h3>Distributing directly from your website</h3><p>Web Distribution, available with a software update later this spring, will let authorized developers distribute their iOS apps to EU users directly from a website owned by the developer. Apple will provide authorized developers access to APIs that facilitate the distribution of their apps from the web, integrate with system functionality, back up and restore users’ apps, and more. For details, visit <a href="https://developer.apple.com/support/web-distribution-eu/">Getting ready for Web Distribution in&nbsp;the&nbsp;EU</a>. </p></div>

As of today, Apple is allowing third-party app stores to offer apps solely from their own catalog. For example, a games studio could create an app store on iOS that exclusively offers their own games.</p>
<p>When directing users to complete a transaction on their website, developers can also now choose how to design their in-app promotions, discounts, and deals. Apple's templates for designing these links out to websites are optional as of today.</p>
<p>In addition, developers will soon be able to distribute apps directly from their websites, providing they meet Apple's specific criteria, such as being a member of the Apple Developer Program for two continuous years or more and having an app with more than one million first installs on iOS in the EU in the prior year, and commit to ongoing requirements, such as publishing transparent data collection policies. Apps distributed in this way must meet Apple's notarization requirements like all other iOS apps and can only be installed from a web domain registered in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a> Connect.</p>
<p>Authorized developers will gain access to APIs to facilitate app distribution from the web, integration with system functionality, back up and restore, and more. Web distribution will become available following a software update later in the spring – allowing app downloads directly from a website for the first time on iOS. </p>
<p>The latest changes are part of Apple's Digital Markets Act (DMA) compliance plan and only apply within the European Union.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>
          🏆 I provide private lessons on Emacs, Linux, and Life in
          general: <a href="https://protesilaos.com/coach/">https://protesilaos.com/coach/</a>.
          Lessons continue <strong>throughout the year</strong>.
        </p><article>

	

	<div>
		<p>On 2022-04-07 I moved all my Emacs projects from GitLab to SourceHut:
<a href="https://protesilaos.com/codelog/2022-04-07-all-emacs-projects-sourcehut/">https://protesilaos.com/codelog/2022-04-07-all-emacs-projects-sourcehut/</a>.
I am now undoing that decision. My code is on GitLab and GitHub, with
the latter as the de facto primary source.</p>

<p>Why the change:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The SourceHut web interface does not show any kind of indication
that a message has an attachment. Last time I tried it, I had to
download an mbox file and extract the patch from there. This was
helped by the fact that I knew what I was searching for, but the
experience was not pleasant anyway.</li>
  <li>Many users are reluctant to subscribe to my project’s mailing list
and instead email me directly. This is fine, as I do get the work
done eventually, but it beats the point of having a public inbox if
I am the only one who reads those messages anyway.</li>
  <li>Personal emails for package maintenance make it more difficult for
me to apply filters. I cannot easily go from “personal” to
“packages” and thus have trouble prioritising tasks.</li>
  <li>Users replying to mailing list threads frequently do not “reply to
all”, so the filter I have for SourceHut lists does not apply and my
inbox is noisy again.</li>
  <li>Coordinating work between my “official” SourceHut-based repository
and the de facto GitHub one is a problem, because a user on one may
not be aware of what a user on the other is doing.</li>
</ul>

<p>There are other papercuts as well, but I understand SourceHut is still
in “alpha”, so I will not list them here.</p>

<h2>What happens to the Git repositories on SourceHut?</h2>

<p>I am no longer updating them and plan to delete them in the near
future.</p>

<h2>What about the mailing lists?</h2>

<p>I will continue to reply to messages sent there, but I will eventually
ask people to use other media. If you do not want to use a Git forge
to report an issue or send a patch, then do it via my personal email:
<a href="https://protesilaos.com/contact">https://protesilaos.com/contact</a>.</p>

<h2>Will you host your own Git server?</h2>

<p>I want to do this at some point because I am mindful of the issues
with proprietary Git forges. But this is a task that requires
knowledge and resources. So it will not happen soon.</p>

      <p>Do you often append "reddit" or "wiki" to your Google search queries? <br>
Seek out human discourse on specific websites,
when search engines were invented to do it for you?
Worry not, for soon search engines will be useless.</p>
<p>If you searched Google for a movie review in 2005, you'd get a review.
Today, you get paid search results, ads, third-party cookies,
trackers, newsletter prompts, notification requests, and,
if you're lucky – a movie review.
No matter what you search for, SEO-hacked content farms will blot out the sun.<sup><a href="#fn-1" id="fnref-1">1</a></sup></p>
<p>The average essay is written not to be read, but to be found—by a search engine,
that is—so it can monetize every fiber of your eyeballs.
Keep you scrolling, clicking, and sharing.
Like this article? Maybe you'll like this e-book too.
It's free! (Just enter your email ;)).</p>
<p>The internet continues to grow in volume, but shrink in diversity.
As if everything has moved to a few select apps,
which then <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/17/24075670/reddit-ai-training-license-deal-user-content">sell our words</a> to AI slot machines.
Images on Instagram, videos on YouTube, and discussions on Reddit.
Dare to venture out of this bubble,
and you'll be pelted with SEO spam by content farms squabbling over search ranks and impressions.</p>
<p>But do you know what's worse than SEO spam?</p>
<h2 id="ai-generated-seo-spam-">AI generated SEO spam. <br></h2>
<p>With services that <a href="https://injuly.in/assets/img/darker-internet/seo-heist.webp">generate thousands of articles</a>,
post them on multiple websites,
then create fake profiles to market them<sup><a href="#fn-2" id="fnref-2">2</a></sup>;
the phrase "As an AI language model" now turns up on LinkedIn, Amazon, Twitter,
and even Google scholar.
In a matter of weeks, LLMs can generate more text than has ever been written in human history.
Every passing day, humans grow farther apart, and bots fill the void in between.</p>
<p>This steady decline hearkens me back to my early teenage years –
when I was an active user of several RTS video-game forums.
At the time, the internet was smaller and fostered organic growth.
Smaller websites were easier to find, game mods and fanfics weren't subreddits, and personal pages didn't live on Substack or Medium<sup><a href="#fn-3" id="fnref-3">3</a></sup>.</p>
<p>When I'm older, I expect to surf an internet that will have exploded with AI content,
like the big bang leaving <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_forest_hypothesis">a dark forest</a> behind<sup><a href="#fn-4" id="fnref-4">4</a></sup>.
Online TV shows and webtoons with unending episodes generated on the fly,
digital journals overflowing with articles, and chat apps with AI companions to ease loneliness.
Human interaction will stay burrowed underground, in the tight confines of small and heavily moderated groups.</p>
<p>For the past few years, I've been holed up in small discord servers –
the only place where I expect to freely interact with meaningful messages that aren't marketing posts in disguise.
And if you too have been hiding in telegram groups and mailing lists  – good, don't leave.
It's dark outside.</p>

<p>On October 19, 1989, at 12:29 UT, a monstrous X13 class solar flare triggered a geomagnetic storm so strong that auroras lit up the skies in Japan, America, Australia, and even Germany the following day. Had you been flying around the Moon at that time, you would have absorbed well over 6 Sieverts of radiation—a dose that would most likely kill you within a month or so.</p>
<p>This is why the Orion spacecraft that is supposed to take humans on a Moon fly-by mission this year has a heavily shielded storm shelter for the crew. But shelters like that aren’t sufficient for a flight to Mars—Orion’s shield is designed for a 30-day mission.</p>
<p>To obtain protection comparable to what we enjoy on Earth would require hundreds of tons of material, and that's simply not possible in orbit. The primary alternative—using active shields that deflect charged particles just like the Earth’s magnetic field does—was first proposed in the 1960s. Today, we’re finally close to making it work.</p>
<h2>Deep-space radiation</h2>
<p>Space radiation comes in two different flavors. Solar events like flares or coronal mass ejections can cause very high fluxes of charged particles (mostly protons). They're nasty when you have no shelter but are relatively easy to shield against since solar protons are mostly low energy. The majority of solar particle events flux is between 30 Mega-electronVolts to 100 MeV and could be stopped by Orion-like shelters.</p>
<p>Then there are galactic cosmic rays: particles coming from outside the Solar System, set in motion by faraway supernovas or neutron stars. These are relatively rare but are coming at you all the time from all directions. They also have high energies, starting at 200 MeV and going to several GeVs, which makes them extremely penetrating. Thick masses don’t provide much shielding against them. When high-energy cosmic ray particles hit thin shields, they produce many lower-energy particles—you’d be better off with no shield at all.</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>The particles with energies between 70 MeV and 500 MeV are responsible for 95 percent of the radiation dose that astronauts get in space. On short flights, solar storms are the main concern because they can be quite violent and do lots of damage very quickly. The longer you fly, though, GCRs become more of an issue because their dose accumulates over time, and they can go through pretty much everything we try to put in their way.</p>
<h2>What keeps us safe at home</h2>
<p>The reason nearly none of this radiation can reach us is that Earth has a natural, multi-stage shielding system. It begins with its magnetic field, which deflects most of the incoming particles toward the poles. A charged particle in a magnetic field follows a curve—the stronger the field, the tighter the curve. Earth’s magnetic field is very weak and barely bends incoming particles, but it is huge, extending thousands of kilometers into space.</p>
<p>Anything that makes it through the magnetic field runs into the atmosphere, which, when it comes to shielding, is the equivalent of an aluminum wall that's 3 meters thick. Finally, there is the planet itself, which essentially cuts the radiation in half since you always have 6.5 billion trillion tons of rock shielding you from the bottom.</p>
<p>To put that in perspective, the Apollo crew module had on average 5 grams of mass per square centimeter standing between the crew and radiation. A typical ISS module has twice that, about 10 g/cm2. The Orion shelter has 35–45 g/cm2, depending on where you sit exactly, and it weighs 36 tons. On Earth, the atmosphere alone gives you 810 g/cm2—roughly 20 times more than our best shielded spaceships.</p>
<p>The two options are to add more mass—which gets expensive quickly—or to shorten the length of the mission, which isn’t always possible. So solving radiation with passive mass won't cut it for longer missions, even using the best shielding materials like polyethylene or water. This is why making a miniaturized, portable version of the Earth’s magnetic field was on the table from the first days of space exploration. Unfortunately, we discovered it was far easier said than done.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://bevyengine.org/news/bevy-foundation/">https://bevyengine.org/news/bevy-foundation/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39677009">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It is with excitement that I unveil to the world ...</p>
<p><img src="https://bevyengine.org/news/bevy-foundation/bevy_foundation.svg" alt="Bevy Foundation Logo"></p><p>The <a href="https://bevyengine.org/foundation"><strong>Bevy Foundation</strong></a> is the next step in our journey to build a world class free and open source game engine. <strong>Bevy Foundation</strong> is a non-profit organization formed in Washington State, with a pending federal 501(c)(3) tax-exemption application (more on this later).</p>
<p>This is a big step for us and it was not taken lightly. This will be a long blog post, so I'll cover the highlights here:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Bevy Foundation</strong> is largely a legal formalization of the leadership and operational structure we have already been using. The "Bevy leadership" that you know (and hopefully trust) is also at the helm of <strong>Bevy Foundation</strong>. The biggest difference is that power is distributed more evenly.</li>
<li>Nothing is fundamentally changing about how we build and release Bevy as free and open source software. This is <em>not</em> a business model rug-pull. It is a legal formalization of our mission to build and release Bevy as free and open source software to members of the general public (you!).</li>
<li>You can now <a href="https://bevyengine.org/donate">donate to the Bevy Foundation</a> to support us!</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="some-history">Some History
<a href="#some-history">#</a>
</h2>
<p>We have come such a long way since I first released Bevy to the world in 2020. What was once a one person side project is now built by hundreds of people and used by thousands (we recently broke a million downloads!). Bevy is the most popular, most used game engine built in Rust, and the second most popular open source game engine on GitHub.</p>
<p>I (Carter / @cart) am still Bevy's Project Lead, but I no longer make all of the decisions. For years now <a href="https://bevyengine.org/community/people">The Bevy Organization</a> has delegated decision making authority across members of the Bevy community. We have 5 excellent Maintainers and even more Subject Matter Experts that were each pivotal in making Bevy what it is today.</p>
<p>As we have grown, we have accumulated what I will call "organizational debt":</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Funding Bevy Has Been A Popularity Contest</strong>: For years, our donate button linked directly to my GitHub sponsors page. This was acceptable early on when I was the only one spending significant time on the project, but that is no longer the case. Last year, we replaced that with a page that any Bevy Organization member could list themselves on. While fairer than the "everything goes to @cart" model, it resulted in funding being a "popularity contest". And unfortunately, given how attached my name is to the project, in practice I still received the majority of the sponsorships. Presenting donors with the task of picking someone to back also deeply complicated the donation process, which likely turned some donors off. We need a simple, centralized donation model where we can direct funds fairly to the areas of the project that need them the most.</li>
<li><strong>We Lacked "Organizational Legitimacy"</strong>: We would like to attract the attention (and funding) of people and companies serious about gamedev. An informal collective of Bevy developers (each asking for support individually) lacks the legitimacy required to attract some entities. We need to be able to present a centralized and transparent view of our operations, with accountable and professional people at the helm.</li>
<li><strong>Carter Held (And Owned) The Keys</strong>: Up until this point, I have owned Bevy-related intellectual property such as the copyright for the Bevy logo. I also owned the <code>bevyengine.org</code> domain name and had exclusive administrative control over most of our infrastructure and communities. I have had absolute authority over all aspects of the project since its inception. Yes, I have delegated, but it all stemmed from me at the root. This had its efficiencies, but it is no longer sustainable for me or ethically sound when there are <em>so many</em> others that deserve actual <em>legal</em> say over how the project is run. There is also the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_factor">"bus factor"</a> to consider. If something were to happen to me, some aspects of the Bevy project would be lost forever.</li>
</ul>
<p>Bevy needs a structure that lets us work together: a legal entity that embodies our goals and principles, where responsibility and decision making are all shared.</p>
<h2 id="introducing-the-bevy-foundation">Introducing the Bevy Foundation!
<a href="#introducing-the-bevy-foundation">#</a>
</h2>
<h3 id="our-mission">Our Mission
<a href="#our-mission">#</a>
</h3>
<p>To quote our 501(c)(3) application:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Our mission is to promote, protect, and advance the free and open source Bevy Engine and related open source projects. We coordinate and promote its continued maintenance and development, educate and train members of the general public in its usage, and conduct research and development to advance the state of the art of creating real-time applications and simulations.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In short: <strong>we exist to develop Bevy and teach people how to use it</strong>!</p>
<h3 id="legal-status">Legal Status
<a href="#legal-status">#</a>
</h3>
<p><a href="https://bevyengine.org/foundation"><strong>Bevy Foundation</strong></a> is a non-profit incorporated in Washington State. This means that the money we raise <a href="https://dor.wa.gov/education/industry-guides/nonprofit-organizations#Fundraising">cannot be used to benefit our members, officers, or directors, except as compensation for services rendered</a>. We do not have "owners" or "shareholders". We are formed exclusively to accomplish our mission as stated above as a public benefit.</p>
<h3 id="federal-501-c-3-application">Federal 501(c)(3) Application
<a href="#federal-501-c-3-application">#</a>
</h3>
<p>We have also applied for a federal 501(c)(3) non-profit public charity designation.</p>
<p>If our 501(c)(3) application is accepted, this status will exempt us from federal income tax and allow donors in the United States to deduct their donations on their federal taxes.</p>
<p>Note that the 501(c)(3) application has not yet been approved, and there has been an increasing number of denials for technology-oriented charities. The experts we have talked to have told us not to get our hopes up.</p>
<p>If we are denied, our default strategy will be to continue operating as a state-only charity and pay federal taxes. As long as we spend most of the donations we receive, the taxes shouldn't be too painful. We may also consider other designations, such as 501(c)(6), but we are cautious about that designation. We want to focus on the members of the Bevy community as people, not through the lens of their commercial interests.</p>
<p>If tax-deductibility is important to you, <em>please do not donate until we receive a determination</em>. But also note that if our application is accepted, donations made <em>prior</em> to our acceptance will <em>retroactively</em> be tax-deductible! Neat!</p>
<h3 id="the-board-of-directors">The Board of Directors
<a href="#the-board-of-directors">#</a>
</h3>
<p>We are run by the <strong>Bevy Foundation</strong> Board of Directors. All actions taken by <strong>Bevy Foundation</strong> are determined by a vote of the board.</p>
<p>The current Board of Directors is: Carter Anderson (@cart), Alice Cecile (@alice-i-cecile), François Mockers (@mockersf), Robert Swain (@superdump), and James Liu (@james7132).</p>
<p>I have been elected President of the board and Alice has been elected Secretary. For logistical reasons, I have also been elected interim Treasurer to get our initial financial situation spun up. It makes sense for a US-based board member to set up things like bank accounts for a US-based organization. But we would like to pass off the role of Treasurer as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>You may notice that every member of the board is an active Bevy Maintainer. This is not a coincidence. We believe that people <em>actually developing the project</em> should be at the helm. There is currently no way to buy a board seat. We have no plans to hire "professional board members" that aren't in the thick of it. For now we plan to stick to the Maintainer == Board Member policy. Functionally, new Board Members are selected via an election of the current board. "Board Member" is currently not a paid position.</p>
<p>Note that I am using the phrasing "currently" and "for now" in some places above because I am <em>no longer capable of making absolute statements about the future of the project</em>. I am a board member, which gives me a vote. And as President I have been given some authority by the board to manage our operations. But I must follow the resolutions of the board and I <em>can</em> be voted out. This is a good thing I promise! It means that the project can exist without me. And if I am no longer fulfilling my duties to the satisfaction of the board, I probably <em>should</em> be ousted.</p>
<p>This is a leap of faith, but one that has been carefully measured over the course of years. I have worked with the other maintainers (now board members) for a long time now and I trust them ... both with the future of Bevy and with my job.</p>
<h3 id="bylaws">Bylaws
<a href="#bylaws">#</a>
</h3>
<p>We have adopted public <a href="https://bevyengine.org/foundation/bylaws">Bylaws</a> that govern how we operate. They determine how we are structured, the roles in the organization, how meetings and voting take place, a conflict of interest policy, and more. Note these are largely borrowed from the standard legal boilerplate (and they exist for a legal purpose), so they're stiffer than our normal style.</p>
<h3 id="transparency">Transparency
<a href="#transparency">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Our goal is to make the operations of <strong>Bevy Foundation</strong> as transparent as possible. We make the following public:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://bevyengine.org/foundation/bylaws"><strong>Bylaws</strong></a>: The operational rules we have adopted</li>
<li><a href="https://bevyengine.org/foundation/meeting-minutes"><strong>Meeting Minutes</strong></a>: Learn about the decisions the board makes and why we make them</li>
<li><a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1Q_vdAaI0tsWZdcddL9lDicDZhjPl79s9?ths=true"><strong>Documents</strong></a>:  Public Bevy Foundation documents, such as our Articles of Incorporation</li>
<li><a href="https://bevyengine.org/foundation/budget"><strong>Budget</strong></a>: How we plan to spend money this year</li>
</ul>
<p>We will strive to be approachable and accountable for our actions, and we will continue to make our technical decisions in public with the input of the community. You know who we are and where to find us!</p>
<h2 id="our-plans">Our Plans
<a href="#our-plans">#</a>
</h2>
<p><strong>Bevy Foundation</strong> will direct the majority of its funding to fueling Bevy development.</p>
<h3 id="short-term-bring-alice-on-full-time">Short Term: Bring Alice on full-time
<a href="#short-term-bring-alice-on-full-time">#</a>
</h3>
<p>We have exactly one focus for the short term: bring Alice on full-time. For years, Alice has dedicated <em>significant</em> time to the project as a Maintainer. She has been our primary project manager: wrangling issues, <a href="https://mastodon.social/deck/tags/bevymergetrain">keeping the merge train running</a>, connecting developers to the right parts of the project, and doing the work that ensures we can harness and enable our ever increasing developer community. Not to mention her extensive technical contributions and documentation work!</p>
<p>If you have participated in Bevy's development, you are probably intimately aware of two things:</p>
<ol>
<li>Project management is our bottleneck.</li>
<li>Alice is a world-class project manager.</li>
</ol>
<p>In addition to performing the general "project management" role, Alice has the following specific priorities when she starts full-time:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>The New Bevy Book</strong>: The new Bevy Book aims to be a complete, always up-to-date, and constantly improving guide to using Bevy. Alice has already contributed content and helped facilitate the book's production. If she joins full-time, she will work to finish it, in addition to helping others contribute.</li>
<li><strong>Coordinating the Development of ECS Relations</strong>: Relations are an ECS feature that enable connecting entities to each other via special components called Relations. These are an often-requested feature that will make a number of scenarios (such as parent-child relationships) much nicer. Alice will work to coordinate this effort and fill in functionality gaps.</li>
<li><strong>Building an Action System for Input Devices</strong>: Bevy sorely needs an official way to define "input actions", which are then mapped (and remapped) to inputs from one or more input devices (for example: a <code>Jump</code> action that is mapped to the "A" button on controllers and "Spacebar" on keyboards). Alice built <a href="https://github.com/leafwing-studios/leafwing-input-manager"><code>leafwing-input-manager</code></a>, which is a popular third-party Bevy plugin that does exactly that. Alice plans on taking the lessons learned there to build a proper first-party solution to this problem.</li>
</ol>
<p>Alice deserves to be paid for her work, and Bevy needs her full-time. Our goal for the <strong>Bevy Foundation</strong> is to pay reasonably competitive, roughly market rate salaries. Therefore, our first goal is to pay Alice a salary of $150,000 a year.</p>
<p>We all believe Alice is worth at least that much, but given that funds will take time to build up, Alice has agreed to take a pay cut while things spin up.</p>
<h4 id="what-about-carter">What about Carter?
<a href="#what-about-carter">#</a>
</h4>
<p>Some may ask why I (Carter), the creator and Project Lead of Bevy, am not the first to be paid by the <strong>Bevy Foundation</strong>. Thats easy: I already currently have enough support from my current sponsors to live on, and I have historically received the lion's share of sponsorships. The scales have been tilted in my favor for too long. Prioritizing Alice is the only fair choice, and also happens to be what is best for Bevy right now.</p>
<p>I suspect my current sponsors will transition to the <strong>Bevy Foundation</strong> over time (and I encourage them to do so!). As this happens there will likely be an inflection point where Alice is making more than me. When we hit that point, we will sort out a balancing strategy until we are both paid our target wages.</p>
<p>Note if we receive 501(c)(3) status (see the 501(c)(3) section above), we are allowed to pay competitive wages, but we can't pay <em>excessive</em> wages (nor are we <em>interested in doing so</em>). Once Alice and Carter are paid reasonable wages, we will shift our financial focus elsewhere.</p>
<h3 id="future-plans">Future Plans
<a href="#future-plans">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Our focus will always be on funding more Bevy developers, both full-time and part-time. We will likely explore targeted one time grants for specific efforts.</p>
<p>Later down the line, we will likely explore the development of a Bevy Asset store where the community can list and sell Bevy-compatible assets.</p>
<p>We would also like to re-introduce a Bevy Merch store. While we don't think this is an ideal fundraising strategy, we think it will be a fun way for the Bevy community to show their pride!</p>
<p>When we consider future programs, we will ask the questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Is this compatible with the Bevy Foundation's mission?</li>
<li>Is this in the best interest of the Bevy community and the general public?</li>
<li>Will this compromise the integrity of Bevy as a free and open source offering in any way?</li>
<li>Will this change our incentives in a way that risks changing our answers to (1), (2), or (3)?</li>
<li>If we are monetizing something, are we doing it in an ethical way?</li>
</ol>
<p>Know that we exist <em>for the benefit of the Bevy community and the general public</em> and we will try our utmost to never compromise that.</p>
<h2 id="a-new-era">A New Era
<a href="#a-new-era">#</a>
</h2>
<p>The <strong>Bevy Foundation</strong> is both an accomplishment, as the culmination of months of work and research, and a Foundation, on top of which we will build the future of Bevy. We are building technology that will enrich the lives of everyone as a common, publicly available good. Game development is currently an industry of rent seekers and gatekeepers. I believe that a better world can exist: one where we collectively build tools <em>for each other</em> in the open. Bevy is ideologically and technologically a rethinking of what this industry should be.</p>
<p>I am deeply proud of what we have accomplished so far and I can't wait for what this new Bevy era will bring.</p>
<h2 id="we-need-your-support">We Need Your Support!
<a href="#we-need-your-support">#</a>
</h2>
<p>Bevy will always be free and open source. However our plans for Bevy's future are grand ... they will require significant financial support. Please consider donating if you enjoy using Bevy and believe in our mission.</p>
<p>If we receive 501(c)(3) public charity status, to maintain that status we will require a significant portion of our funds to come from individual people (not just companies). Your contribution matters!</p>
<p>If you are already supporting us through individual sponsorships, consider switching your donation to <strong>Bevy Foundation</strong>, as that will make it easier for us to direct your contribution to the areas that need it most.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><p>Recently, I got a new laptop and had to set it up so I could start using it. But I wasn't really in the mood to go through the same old steps which I had explained in this <a href="https://copyninja.in/blog/live_install_debian.html">post earlier</a>. I was complaining about this to my colleague, and there came the suggestion of why not copy the entire disk to the new laptop. Though it sounded like an interesting idea to me, I had my doubts, so here is what I told him in return.</p><ol><li>I don't have the tools to open my old laptop and connect the new disk over USB to my new laptop.</li><li>I use full disk encryption, and my old laptop has a 512GB disk, whereas the new laptop has a 1TB NVME, and I'm not so familiar with resizing LUKS.</li></ol><p>He promptly suggested both could be done. For step 1, just expose the disk using NVME over TCP and connect it over the network and do a full disk copy, and the rest is pretty simple to achieve. In short, he suggested the following:</p><ol><li>Export the disk using nvmet-tcp from the old laptop.</li><li>Do a disk copy to the new laptop.</li><li>Resize the partition to use the full 1TB.</li><li>Resize LUKS.</li><li>Finally, resize the BTRFS root disk.</li></ol><div id="exporting-disk-over-nvme-tcp"><h2>Exporting Disk over NVME TCP</h2><p>The easiest way suggested by my colleague to do this is using <a href="https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/latest/systemd-storagetm.service.html">systemd-storagetm.service</a>. This service can be invoked by simply booting into <em>storage-target-mode.target</em> by specifying <em>rd.systemd.unit=storage-target-mode.target</em>. But he suggested not to use this as I need to tweak the dracut initrd image to involve network services as well as configuring WiFi from this mode is a painful thing to do.</p><p>So alternatively, I simply booted both my laptops with GRML rescue CD.

<p><em><strong><em>Scope.</em></strong><em> To talk about C++’s current safety problems and solutions well, I need to include the context of the broad landscape of security and safety threats facing all software. I chair the ISO C++ standards committee and I work for Microsoft, but these are my personal opinions and I hope they will invite more dialog across programming language and security communities.</em></em></p>



<p><strong><em>Acknowledgments. </em></strong><em>Many thanks to people from the C, C++, C#, Python, Rust, MITRE, and other language and security communities whose feedback on drafts of this material has been invaluable, including: Jean-François Bastien, Joe Bialek, Andrew Lilley Brinker, Jonathan Caves, Gabriel Dos Reis, Daniel Frampton, Tanveer Gani, Daniel Griffing, Russell Hadley, Mark Hall, Tom Honermann, Michael Howard, Marian Luparu, Ulzii Luvsanbat, Rico Mariani, Chris McKinsey, Bogdan Mihalcea, Roger Orr, Robert Seacord, Bjarne Stroustrup, Mads Torgersen, Guido van Rossum, Roy Williams, Michael Wong.</em></p>

<p>We must make our software infrastructure more secure against the rise in cyberattacks (such as on power grids, hospitals, and banks), and safer against accidental failures with the increased use of software in life-critical systems (such as autonomous vehicles and autonomous weapons).</p>



<p>The past two years in particular have seen extra attention on programming language safety as a way to help build more-secure and -safe software; on the real benefits of memory-safe languages (MSLs); and that C and C++ language safety needs to improve — I agree.</p>



<p>But there have been misconceptions, too, including focusing too narrowly on programming language safety as our industry’s primary security and safety problem — it isn’t. Many of the most damaging recent security breaches happened to code written in MSLs (e.g., <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/news/apache-log4j-vulnerability-guidance">Log4j</a>) or had nothing to do with programming languages (e.g., <a href="https://blog.aquasec.com/the-ticking-supply-chain-attack-bomb-of-exposed-kubernetes-secrets">Kubernetes Secrets stored on public GitHub repos</a>).</p>



<p>In that context, I’ll focus on C++ and try to:</p>

<li>highlight what needs attention (what C++’s problem “is”), and how we can get there by building on solutions already underway;</li>

<p><strong>tl;dr:</strong> I don’t want C++ to limit what I can express efficiently. I just want C++ to let me enforce our already-well-known safety rules and best practices by default, and make me opt out explicitly if that’s what I want. Then I can still use fully modern C++… just nicer.</p>



<p>Let’s dig in.</p>



<h2>The immediate problem “is” that it’s Too Easy By Default™ to write security and safety vulnerabilities in C++ that would have been caught by stricter enforcement of known rules for <em>type, bounds, initialization, </em>and<em> lifetime</em> language safety</h2>

<p><strong>In C++, we need to start with improving these four categories. </strong>These are the main four sources of improvement provided by all the MSLs that NIST/NSA/CISA/etc. recommend using instead of C++ (<a href="https://media.defense.gov/2023/Dec/06/2003352724/-1/-1/0/THE-CASE-FOR-MEMORY-SAFE-ROADMAPS-TLP-CLEAR.PDF">example</a>), so by definition addressing these four would address the immediate NIST/NSA/CISA/etc. issues with C++. (More on this under “The problem ‘isn’t’… (1)” below.)</p>



<p>And in all recent years including 2023 (see figures 1’s four highlighted rows, and figure 2), these four constitute the bulk of those oft-quoted 70% of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerabilities_and_Exposures">CVEs</a> (Common [Security] Vulnerabilities and Exposures) related to language memory unsafety. (However, that “70% of language memory unsafety CVEs” is misleading; for example, in figure 1, most of <a href="https://cwe.mitre.org/top25/archive/2023/2023_top25_list.html#tableView">MITRE’s 2023 “most dangerous weaknesses”</a> did not involve language safety and so are outside that denominator. More on this under “The problem ‘isn’t’… (3)” below.)</p>

<p><strong>The C++ guidance literature already broadly agrees on safety rules in those categories. </strong>It’s true that there is some conflicting guidance literature, particularly in environments that ban exceptions or run-time type support and so use some alternative rules. But there is consensus on core safety rules, such as banning unsafe casts, uninitialized variables, and out-of-bounds accesses (see Appendix).</p>



<p><strong><strong>C++ should provide a way to enforce them by default, and require explicit opt-out where needed.</strong></strong> We can and do write “good” code and secure applications in C++. But it’s easy even for experienced C++ developers to accidentally write “bad” code and security vulnerabilities that C++ silently accepts, and that would be rejected as safety violations in other languages. We need the standard language to help more by enforcing the known best practices, rather than relying on additional nonstandard tools to recommend them.</p>



<p><strong>These are not the only four aspects of language safety we should address.</strong> They are just the immediate ones, a set of clear low-hanging fruit where there is both a clear need and clear way to improve (see Appendix).</p>



<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>Note:</em></strong><em> And safety categories are of course interrelated. For example, full type safety (that an accessed object is a valid object of its type) requires eliminating out-of-bounds accesses to unallocated objects. But, conversely, full bounds safety (that accessed memory is inside allocated bounds) similarly requires eliminating type-unsafe downcasts to larger derived-type objects that would appear to extend beyond the actual allocation.</em></p>
</blockquote>



<p><strong>Software safety is also important.</strong> Cyberattacks are urgent, so it’s natural that recent discussions have focused more on security and CVEs first. But as we specify and evolve default language safety rules, we must also include our stakeholders who care deeply about functional safety issues that are not reflected in the major CVE buckets but are just as harmful to life and property when left in code. Programming language safety helps both software security and software safety, and we should start somewhere, so let’s start (but not end) with the known pain points of security CVEs.</p>



<h3>In those four buckets, a 10-50x improvement (90-98% reduction) is sufficient</h3>



<p><strong>If there were 90-98% fewer C++ type/bounds/initialization/lifetime vulnerabilities we wouldn’t be having this discussion.</strong> All languages have CVEs, C++ just has more (and C still more); so far in 2024, <a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvekey.cgi?keyword=rust">Rust has 6 CVEs</a>, and <a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvekey.cgi?keyword=c++">C and C++ combined have 61 CVEs</a>. So zero isn’t the goal; something like a 90% reduction is necessary, and a 98% reduction is sufficient, to achieve security parity with the levels of language safety provided by MSLs… and has the strong benefit that I believe it can be achieved with <em>perfect backward link compatibility</em> (i.e., without changing C++’s object model, and its lifetime model which does not depend on universal tracing garbage collection and is not limited to tree-based data structures) which is essential to our being able to adopt the improvements in existing C++ projects as easily as we can adopt other new editions of C++. — After that, we can pursue additional improvements to other buckets, such as thread safety and overflow safety.</p>



<p>Aiming for 100%, or zero CVEs in those four buckets, would be a mistake:</p>



<ul>
<li>100% is not necessary because none of the MSLs we’re being told to use instead are there either. More on this in “The problem ‘isn’t’… (2)” below.</li>



<li>100% is not sufficient because many cyberattacks exploit security weaknesses other than memory safety.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>And getting that last 2% would be too costly</strong>, because it would require giving up on link compatibility and seamless interoperability (or “interop”) with today’s C++ code. For example, Rust’s object model and borrow checker deliver great guarantees, but require fundamental incompatibility with C++ and so make interop hard beyond the usual C interop level. One reason is that Rust’s safe language pointers are limited to expressing tree-shaped data structures that have no cycles; that unique ownership is essential to having great language-enforced aliasing guarantees, but it also requires programmers to use ‘something else’ for anything more complex than a tree (e.g., using Rc, or using integer indexes as ersatz pointers); it’s not just about <a href="https://rust-unofficial.github.io/too-many-lists/">linked lists</a> but those are a simple well-known illustrative example.</p>



<p>If we can get a 98% improvement and still have fully compatible interop with existing C++, that would be a holy grail worth serious investment.</p>



<h3>A 98% reduction across those four categories is achievable in new/updated C++ code, and partially in existing code</h3>



<p>Since at least 2014, Bjarne Stroustrup has advocated addressing safety in C++ via a “subset of a superset”: That is, first “superset” to add essential items not available in C++14, then “subset” to exclude the unsafe constructs that now all have replacements.</p>



<p><strong>As of C++20, I believe we have achieved the “superset,” notably by standardizing </strong><strong>span</strong><strong>, </strong><strong>string_view</strong><strong>, concepts, and bounds-aware ranges. </strong>We may still want a handful more features, such as a null-terminated zstring_view, but the major additions already exist.</p>



<p><strong>Now we should “subset”: Enable C++ programmers to enforce best practices around type and memory safety, by default, in new code and code they can update to confirm to the subset.</strong> Enabling safety rules by default would not limit the language’s power but would require explicit opt-outs for non-standard practices, thereby reducing inadvertent risks. And it could be evolved over time, which is important because C++ is a living language and adversaries will keep changing their attacks.</p>



<p>ISO C++ evolution is already pursuing <a href="https://open-std.org/JTC1/SC22/WG21/docs/papers/2023/p2816r0.pdf">Safety Profiles for C++</a>. The suggestions in the Appendix are refinements to that, to demonstrate specific enforcements and to try to maximize their adoptability and useful impact. For example, everyone agrees that many safety bugs will require code changes to fix. However, how many safety bugs could be fixed without manual source code changes, so that just recompiling existing code with safety profiles enabled delivers some safety benefits? For example, we could by default inject a call-site bounds check 0 &lt;= b &lt; a.size() on every subscript expression a[b] when a.size() exists and a is a contiguous container, without requiring any source code changes and without upgrading to a new internally bounds-checked container library; that checking would Just Work out of the box with every contiguous C++ standard container, span, string_view, and third-party custom container with no library updates needed (including therefore also no concern about ABI breakage).</p>



<p><strong>Rules like those summarized in the Appendix would have prevented (at compile time, test time or run time) most of the past CVEs I’ve reviewed in the type, bounds, and initialization categories, and would have prevented many of the lifetime CVEs. </strong>I estimate a roughly 98% reduction in those categories is achievable in a well-defined and standardized way for C++ to enable safety rules by default and retains perfect backward link compatibility.&nbsp;See the Appendix for a more detailed description.</p>



<p><strong>We can and should emphasize adoptability and benefit also for C++ code that cannot easily be changed. </strong>Any code change to conform to safety rules carries a cost; worse, not all code can be easily updated to conform to safety rules (e.g., it’s old and not understood, it belongs to a third party that won’t allow updates, it belongs to a shared project that won’t take upstream changes and can’t easily be forked). That’s why above (and in the Appendix) I stress that C++ should seriously try to deliver as many of the safety improvements as practical without requiring manual source code changes, notably by automatically making existing code do the right thing when that is clear (e.g., the bounds checks mentioned above, or emitting static_cast pointer downcasts as effectively dynamic_cast without requiring the code to be changed), and by offering automated fixits that the programmer can choose to apply (e.g., to change the source for static_cast pointer downcasts to actually say dynamic_cast). Even though in many cases a programmer will need to thoughtfully update code to replace inherently unsafe constructs that can’t be automatically fixed, I believe for some percentage of cases we can deliver safety improvements by just recompiling existing code in the safety-rules-by-default mode, and we should try because it’s essential to maximizing safety profiles’ adoptability and impact.</p>



<h2>What the problem “isn’t”: Some common misconceptions</h2>



<h3>(1) The problem “isn’t” defining what we mean by “C++’s most urgent language safety problem.” We know the four kinds of safety that most urgently need to be improved: type, bounds, initialization, and lifetime safety.</h3>



<p>We know these four are the low-hanging fruit (see “The problem ‘is’…” above). It’s true that these are just four of perhaps two dozen kinds of “safety” categories, including ones like safe integer arithmetic. But:</p>



<ul>
<li>Most of the others are either much smaller sources of problems, or are primarily important because they contribute to those four main categories. For example, the integer overflows we care most about are indexes and sizes, which fall under bounds safety.</li>



<li>Most MSLs don’t address making these safe by default either, typically due to the checking cost. But all languages (including C++) usually have libraries and tools to address them. For example, Microsoft ships a <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/safeint/safeint-library?view=msvc-170">SafeInt library</a> for C++ to handle integer overflows, which is opt-in. C# has a <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/statements/checked-and-unchecked">checked arithmetic language feature</a> to handle integer overflows, which is opt-in. Python’s built-in integers are overflow-safe by default because they automatically expand; however, the popular NumPy fixed-size integer types do not check for overflow by default and require using checked functions, which is opt-in.</li>
</ul>



<p>Thread safety is obviously important too, and I’m not ignoring it. I’m just pointing out that it is not one of the top target buckets: Most of the MSLs that NIST/NSA/CISA/etc. recommend over C++ (except uniquely Rust, and to a lesser extent Python) address thread safety impact on <em>user</em> <em>data</em> corruption about as well as C++. The main improvement MSLs give is that a program data race will not corrupt the language’s own <em>virtual machine</em> (whereas in C++ a data race is currently all-bets-are-off undefined behavior). Some languages do give some additional protection, such as that Python guarantees two racing threads cannot see a torn write of an integer and reduces other possible interleavings because of the global interpreter lock (GIL).</p>



<h3>(2) The problem “isn’t” that C++ code is not formally provably safe.</h3>



<p>Yes, C++ code makes it too easy to write silently-unsafe code by default (see “The problem ‘is’…” above).</p>



<p>But I’ve seen some people claim we need to require languages to be formally provably safe, and that would be a bridge too far. Much to the chagrin of CS theorists, mainstream commercial programming languages aren’t formally provably safe. Consider some examples:</p>



<ul>
<li>None of the widely-used languages we view as MSLs (except uniquely Rust) claim to be thread-safe and race-free by construction, as covered in the previous section. Yet we still call C#, Go, Java, Python, and similar languages “safe.” Therefore, formally guaranteeing thread safety properties can’t be a requirement to be considered a sufficiently safe language.</li>



<li>That’s because a language’s choice of safety guarantees is a tradeoff: For example, in Rust, safe code uses tree-based dynamic data structures only. This feature lets Rust deliver stronger thread safety guarantees than other safe languages, because it can more easily reason about and control aliasing. However, this same feature also requires Rust programs to use unsafe code more often to represent common data structures that do not require unsafe code to represent in other MSLs such as C# or Java, and so <a href="https://thenewstack.io/unsafe-rust-in-the-wild/">30% to 50% of Rust crates use unsafe code</a>, compared for example to <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2814270.2814313">25% of Java libraries</a>.</li>



<li>C#, Java, and other MSLs still have use-before-initialized and use-after-destroyed type safety problems too: They guarantee not accessing <em>memory</em> outside its allocated lifetime, but <em>object</em> lifetime is a subset of memory lifetime (objects are constructed after, and destroyed/disposed before, the raw memory is allocated and deallocated; before construction and after dispose, the memory is allocated but contains “raw bits” that likely don’t represent a valid object of its type). <strong>If you doubt, please run (don’t walk) and ask ChatGPT</strong> about Java and C# problems with: access-unconstructed-object bugs (e.g., in those languages, any virtual call in a constructor is “deep” and executes in a derived object before the derived object’s state is initialized); use-after-dispose bugs; “resurrection” bugs; and why those languages tell people never to use their finalizers. Yet these are great languages and we rightly consider them safe languages. Therefore, formally guaranteeing no-use-before-initialized and no-use-after-dispose can’t be a requirement to be considered a sufficiently safe language.</li>



<li>Rust, Go, and other languages <a href="https://rustc-dev-guide.rust-lang.org/sanitizers.html">support sanitizers</a> too, including ThreadSanitizer and <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/miri">undefined behavior sanitizers</a>, and related tools like fuzzers. Sanitizers are known to be still needed as a complement to language safety, and not only for when programmers use ‘unsafe’ code; furthermore, they go beyond finding memory safety issues. The uses of Rust at scale that I know of also enforce use of sanitizers. So using sanitizers can’t be an indicator that a language is unsafe — we should use the supported sanitizers for code written in any language.</li>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> “Use your sanitizers” does not mean to use all of them all the time. Some sanitizers conflict with each other, so you can only use those one at a time.

<h3>(3) The problem “isn’t” that moving the world’s C and C++ code to memory-safe languages (MSLs) would eliminate 70% of security vulnerabilities.</h3>



<p>MSLs are wonderful! They just aren’t a silver bullet.</p>



<p><a href="https://alexgaynor.net/2020/may/27/science-on-memory-unsafety-and-security/">An oft-quoted number</a> is that “70%” of <em>programming language-caused</em> CVEs (reported security vulnerabilities) in C and C++ code are due to language safety problems. That number is true and repeatable, but has been badly misinterpreted in the press: No security expert I know believes that if we could wave a magic wand and instantly transform all the world’s code to MSLs, that we’d have 70% fewer CVEs, data breaches, and ransomware attacks. (For example, see <a href="https://www.horizon3.ai/analysis-of-2023s-known-exploited-vulnerabilities/">this February 2024 example analysis paper</a>.)</p>



<p>Consider some reasons.</p>



<ul>
<li>That 70% is of the <em>subset</em> of security CVEs that can be addressed by programming language safety. See figure 1 again: Most of 2023’s top 10 “most dangerous software weaknesses” were not related to memory safety. Many of 2023’s largest data breaches and other cyberattacks and cybercrime had nothing to do with programming languages at all. In 2023, attackers reduced their use of malware because software is getting hardened and endpoint protection is effective (<a href="https://www.crn.com/news/security/10-major-cyberattacks-and-data-breaches-in-2023">CRN</a>), and attackers go after the slowest animal in the herd. Most of the issues listed in <a href="https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/ir/2021/NIST.IR.8397.pdf">NISTIR-8397</a> affect all languages equally, as they go beyond memory safety (e.g., <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/news/apache-log4j-vulnerability-guidance">Log4j</a>) or even programming languages (e.g., automated testing, hardcoded secrets, enabling OS protections, string/SQL injections, software bills of materials). For more detail see the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/code-quality/build-reliable-secure-programs?view=msvc-170">Microsoft response to NISTIR-8397</a>, for which I was the editor. (More on this in the Call to Action.)</li>



<li>MSLs get CVEs too, though definitely fewer (again, e.g., <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/news/apache-log4j-vulnerability-guidance">Log4j</a>). For example, see <a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvekey.cgi?keyword=rust">MITRE list of Rust CVEs</a>, including six so far in 2024. And all programs use unsafe code; for example, see the <em>Conclusions</em> section of <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/344892072_On_the_use_of_C_Unsafe_Code_Context_An_Empirical_Study_of_Stack_Overflow">Firouzi et al.</a>’s study of uses of C#’s unsafe on StackOverflow and prevalence of vulnerabilities, and that all programs eventually call trusted native libraries or operating system code.</li>



<li>Saying the quiet part out loud: CVEs are known to be an imprecise metric. We use it because it’s the metric we have, at least for security vulnerabilities, but we should use it with care. This may surprise you, as it did me, because we hear a lot about CVEs. But whenever I’ve suggested improvements for C++ and measuring “success” via a reduction in CVEs (including in this essay), security experts insist to me that CVEs aren’t a great metric to use… including the same experts who had previously quoted the 70% CVE number to me. — Reasons why CVEs aren’t a great metric include that CVEs are self-reported and often self-selected, and not all are equally exploitable; but there can be pressure to report a bug as a vulnerability even if there’s no reasonable exploit because of the benefits of getting one’s name on a CVE. In August 2023, the <a href="https://www.cve.org/Media/News/item/news/2023/08/29/Python-Software-Foundation-Added-as-CNA">Python Software Foundation became a CVE Numbering Authority (CNA)</a> for Python and pip distributions, and now has more control over Python and pip CVEs. The C++ community has not done so.</li>



<li>CVEs target only software security vulnerabilities (cyberattacks and intrusions), and we also need to consider software safety (life-critical systems and unintended harm to humans).</li>
</ul>



<h3>(4) The problem “isn’t” that C++ programmers aren’t trying hard enough / using the existing tools well enough. The challenge is making it easier to enable them.</h3>



<p>Today, the mitigations and tools we do have for C++ code are an uneven mix, and all are off-by-default:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Kind.</strong> They are a mix of static tools, dynamic tools, compiler switches, libraries, and language features.</li>



<li><strong>Acquisition.</strong> They are acquired in a mix of ways: in-the-box in the C++ compiler, optional downloads, third-party products, and some you need to google around to discover.</li>



<li><strong>Accuracy.</strong> Existing rulesets mix rules with low and high false positives. The latter are effectively unadoptable by programmers, and their presence makes it difficult to “just adopt this whole set of rules.”</li>



<li><strong>Determinism.</strong> Some rules, such as ones that rely on interprocedural analysis of full call trees, are inherently nondeterministic (because an implementation gives up when fully evaluating a case exceeds the space and time available; a.k.a. “best effort” analysis). This means that two implementations of the identical rule can give different answers for identical code (and therefore nondeterministic rules are also not portable, see below).</li>



<li><strong>Efficiency.</strong> Existing rulesets mix rules with low and high (and sometimes impossible) cost to diagnose. The rules that are not efficient enough to implement in the compiler will always be relegated to optional standalone tools.</li>



<li><strong>Portability.</strong> Not all rules are supported by all vendors. “Conforms to ISO/IEC 14882 (Standard C++)” is the only thing every C++ tool vendor supports portably.</li>
</ul>



<p>To address all these points, I think we need the C++ standard to specify a mode of well-agreed and low-or-zero-false-positive deterministic rules that are sufficiently low-cost to implement in-the-box at build time.</p>

<p>As an industry generally, we must make a major improvement in programming language memory safety — and we will.</p>



<p>In C++ specifically, we should first target the four key safety categories that are our perennial empirical attack points (type, bounds, initialization, and lifetime safety), and drive vulnerabilities in these four areas down to the noise for new/updated C++ code — and we can.</p>



<p>But we must also recognize that programming language safety is not a silver bullet to achieve cybersecurity and software safety. It’s one battle (not even the biggest) in a long war: Whenever we harden one part of our systems and make that more expensive to attack, attackers always switch to the next slowest animal in the herd. Many of 2023’s worst data breaches did not involve malware, but were caused by inadequately stored credentials (e.g., <a href="https://blog.aquasec.com/the-ticking-supply-chain-attack-bomb-of-exposed-kubernetes-secrets">Kubernetes Secrets</a> on public GitHub repos), misconfigured servers (e.g., <a href="https://cybernews.com/security/darkbeam-data-leak/#google_vignette">DarkBeam</a>, <a href="https://cybernews.com/security/kidsecurity-parental-control-data-leak/">Kid Security</a>), lack of testing, supply chain vulnerabilities, social engineering, and other problems that are independent of programming languages. <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/pdfs/The-Continued-Threat-to-Personal-Data-Key-Factors-Behind-the-2023-Increase.pdf">Apple’s white paper</a> about 2023’s rise in cybercrime emphasizes improving the handling, not of program code, but of the data: “it’s imperative that organizations consider limiting the amount of personal data they store in readable format while making a greater effort to protect the sensitive consumer data that they do store [including by using] end-to-end [E2E] encryption.”</p>



<p>No matter what programming language we use, security hygiene is essential:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Do</strong> use your language’s static analyzers and sanitizers. Never pretend using static analyzers and sanitizers is unnecessary “because I’m using a safe language.” If you’re using C++, Go, or Rust, then use those languages’ supported analyzers and sanitizers. If you’re a manager, don’t allow your product to be shipped without using these tools. (Again: This doesn’t mean running all sanitizers all the time; some sanitizers conflict and so can’t be used at the same time, some are expensive and so should be used periodically, and some should be run only in testing and never in production including because their presence can create new security vulnerabilities.)</li>



<li><strong>Do</strong> keep all your tools updated. Regular patching is not just for iOS and Windows, but also for your compilers, libraries, and IDEs.</li>



<li><strong>Do</strong> secure your software supply chain. <strong>Do</strong> use package management for library dependencies. <strong>Do</strong> track a software bill of materials for your projects.</li>



<li><strong>Don’t</strong> store secrets in code. (Or, for goodness’ sake, on GitHub!)</li>



<li><strong>Do</strong> configure your servers correctly, especially public Internet-facing ones. (Turn authentication on! Change the default password!)</li>



<li><strong>Do</strong> keep non-public data encrypted, both when at rest (on disk) and when in motion (ideally E2E… and oppose proposed legislation that tries to neuter E2E encryption with ‘backdoors only good guys will use’ because there’s no such thing).</li>



<li><strong>Do</strong> keep investing long-term in keeping your threat modeling current, so that you can stay adaptive as your adversaries keep trying different attack methods.</li>
</ul>

<p>We need to improve software security and software safety across the industry, especially by improving programming language safety in C and C++, and in C++ a 98% improvement in the four most common problem areas is achievable in the medium term. But if we focus on programming language safety alone, we may find ourselves fighting yesterday’s war and missing larger past and future security dangers that affect software written in any language.</p>



<p>Sadly, there are too many bad actors. For the foreseeable future, our software and data will continue to be under attack, written in any language and stored anywhere. But we can defend our programs and systems, and we will.</p>



<p>Be well, and may we all keep working to have a safer and more secure 2024.</p>

<h2>Appendix: Illustrating why a 98% reduction is feasible</h2>



<p>This Appendix exists to support why I think a 98% reduction in type/bounds/initialization/lifetime CVEs in C++ code is believable. This is not a formal proposal, but an overview of concrete ways to achieve such an improvement it in new and updatable code, and ways to even get some fraction of that improvement in existing code we cannot update but can recompile. These notes are aligned with the proposals currently being pursued in the ISO C++ safety subgroup, and if they pan out as I expect in ongoing discussions and experiments, then I intend to write further details about them in a future paper.</p>



<p>There are runtime and code size overheads to some of the suggestions in all four buckets, notably checking bounds and casts. But there is no reason to think those overheads need to be inherently worse in C++ than other languages, and we can make them on by default and still provide a way to opt out to regain full performance where needed.</p>



<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> For example, bounds checking can cause a major impact on some hot loops, when using a compiler whose optimizer does not hoist bounds checks; not only can the loops incur redundant checking, but they also may not get other optimizations such as not being vectorized. This is why making bounds-checking on by default is good, but all performance-oriented languages also need to provide a way to say “trust me” and explicitly opt out of bounds checking tactically where needed.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>This appendix refers to the “profiles” in the <a href="https://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines#S-profile">C++ Core Guidelines safety profiles</a>, a set of about two dozen enforceable rules for type and memory safety of which I am a coauthor. I refer to them only as examples, to show “what” already-known rules exist that we can enforce, to support that my claimed improvement is possible. They are broadly consistent with rules in other sources, such as: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/C-Programming-Language-4th/dp/0321563840"><em>The C++ Programming Language</em></a>’s advice on type safety; <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Coding-Standards-Rules-Guidelines-Practices/dp/0321113586"><em>C++ Coding Standards</em></a>’ section on type safety; the <a href="https://www.stroustrup.com/JSF-AV-rules.pdf"><em>Joint Strike Fighter Coding Standards</em></a>; <a href="https://www.perforce.com/resources/qac/high-integrity-cpp-coding-standard">High Integrity C++</a>; the <a href="https://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines#S-profile">C++ Core Guidelines section on safety profiles</a> (a small enforceable set of safety rules); and the <a href="https://forum.misra.org.uk/thread-1668.html">recently-released MISRA C++:2023</a>.</p>



<p>The best way for “how” to let the programmer control enabling those rules (e.g., via source code annotations, compiler switches, and/or something else) is an orthogonal UX issue that is now being actively discussed in the C++ standards committee and community.</p>



<h3>Type safety</h3>



<p><strong>Enforce the </strong><a href="https://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines#SS-type"><strong>Pro.Type safety profile</strong></a><strong> by default.</strong> That includes either banning or checking all unsafe casts and conversions (e.g., static_cast pointer downcasts, reinterpret_cast), including implicit unsafe type punning via C union and vararg.</p>



<p>However, these rules haven’t yet been systematically enforced in the industry. For example, in recent years I’ve painfully observed a significant set of type safety-caused security vulnerabilities whose root cause was that code used static_cast instead of dynamic_cast for pointer downcasts, and “C++” gets blamed even when the actual problem was failure to follow the well-publicized guidance to use the language’s existing safe recommended feature. It’s time for a standardized C++ mode that enforces these rules by default.</p>



<blockquote>
<p><a><strong><em>Note:</em></strong></a><em> On some platforms and for some applications, </em><em>dynamic_cast</em><em> has problematic space and time overheads that hinder its use. Many implementations bundle </em><em>dynamic_cast</em><em> indivisibly with all C++ run-time typing (RTTI) features (e.g., </em><em>typeid</em><em>), and so require storing full potentially-heavyweight RTTI data even though </em><em>dynamic_cast</em><em> needs only a small subset. Some implementations also use needlessly inefficient algorithms for </em><em>dynamic_cast</em><em> itself. So the standard must encourage (and, if possible, enforce for conformance, such as by setting algorithmic complexity requirements) that </em><em>dynamic_cast</em><em> implementations be more efficient and decoupled from other RTTI overheads, so that programmers do not have a legitimate performance reason not to use the safe feature. That decoupling could require an ABI break; if that is unacceptable, the standard must provide an alternative lightweight facility such as a </em><em>fast_dynamic_cast</em><em> that is separate from (other) RTTI and performs the dynamic cast with minimum space and time cost.</em></p>
</blockquote>



<h3>Bounds safety</h3>



<p><strong>Enforce the </strong><a href="https://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines#probounds-bounds-safety-profile"><strong>Pro.Bounds safety profile</strong></a><strong> by default, and guarantee bounds checking.</strong> We should additionally guarantee that:</p>



<ul>
<li>Pointer arithmetic is banned (use std::span instead); this enforces that a pointer refers to a single object. Array-to-pointer decay, if allowed, will point to only the first object in the array.</li>



<li>Only bounds-checked iterator arithmetic is allowed (also, prefer ranges instead).</li>



<li>All subscript operations are bounds-checked at the call site, by having the compiler inject an automatic subscript bounds check on every expression of the form a[b], where a is a contiguous sequence with a size/ssize function and b is an integral index. When a violation happens, the action taken can be customized using a global bounds violation handler; some programs will want to terminate (the default), others will want to log-and-continue, throw an exception, integrate with a project-specific critical fault infrastructure.</li>
</ul>



<p>Importantly, the latter explicitly avoids implementing bounds-checking intrusively for each individual container/range/view type. Implementing bounds-checking non-intrusively and automatically at the call site makes full bounds checking available for every existing standard and user-written container/range/view type out of the box: Every subscript into a vector, span, deque, or similar existing type in third-party and company-internal libraries would be usable in checked mode without any need for a library upgrade.</p>



<p>It’s important to add automatic call-site checking now before libraries continue adding more subscript bounds checking in each library, so that we avoid duplicating checks at the call site and in the callee. As a counterexample, C# took many years to get rid of duplicate caller-and-callee checking, but succeeded and .NET Core addresses this better now; we can avoid most of that duplicate-check-elimination optimization work by offering automatic call-site checking sooner.</p>



<p>Language constructs like the range-for loop are already safe by construction and need no checks.</p>



<p>In cases where bounds checking incurs a performance impact, code can still explicitly opt out of the bounds check in just those paths to retain full performance and still have full bounds checking in the rest of the application.</p>



<h3>Initialization safety</h3>



<p><strong>Enforce initialization-before-use by default.</strong> That’s pretty easy to statically guarantee, except for some cases of the unused parts of lazily constructed array/vector storage. Two simple alternatives we could enforce are (either is sufficient):</p>



<ul>
<li>Initialize-at-declaration as required by <a href="https://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines#SS-type">Pro.Type</a> and <a href="https://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines#Res-always">ES.20</a>; and possibly zero-initialize data by default as currently proposed in <a href="https://wg21.link/p2723">P2723</a>. These two are good but with some drawbacks; both have some performance costs for cases that require ‘dummy’ writes that are never used but hard for optimizers to eliminate, and the latter has some correctness costs because it ‘fixing’ some uninitialized cases where zero is a valid value but masks others for which zero is not a valid initializer and so the behavior is still wrong, but because a zero has been jammed in it’s harder for sanitizers to detect.</li>



<li>Guaranteed initialization-before-use, similar to what Ada and C# successfully do. This is still simple to use, but can be more efficient because it avoids the need for artificial ‘dummy’ writes, and can be more flexible because it allows alternative constructors to be used for the same object on different paths. For details, see: <a href="https://youtu.be/ELeZAKCN4tY?si=HKzgS8CUBdGREDAN&amp;t=4305">example diagnostic</a>; <a href="https://youtu.be/ELeZAKCN4tY?si=MnhZGU5xoRhTGF_V&amp;t=4556">definite-first-use rules</a>.</li>
</ul>



<h3>Lifetime safety</h3>



<p><strong>Enforce the </strong><a href="https://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines#SS-type"><strong>Pro.Lifetime safety profile</strong></a><strong> by default, ban manual allocation by default, and guarantee null checking.</strong> The Lifetime profile is a static analysis that diagnoses many common sources of dangling and use-after-free, including for iterators and views (not just raw pointers and references), in a way that is efficient enough to run during compilation. It can be used as a basis to iterate on and further improve. And we should additionally guarantee that:</p>



<ul>
<li>All manual memory management is banned by default (new, delete, malloc, and free). Corollary: ‘Owning’ raw pointers are banned by default, since they require delete or free. Use RAII instead, such as by calling make_unique or make_shared.</li>



<li>All dereferences are null-checked. The compiler injects an automatic check on every expression of the form *p or p-&gt; where p can be compared to nullptr to null-check all dereferences at the call site (similar to bounds checks above). When a violation happens, the action taken can be customized using a global null violation handler; some programs will want to terminate (the default), others will want to log-and-continue, throw an exception, integrate with a project-specific critical fault infrastructure.</li>
</ul>



<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The compiler could choose to not emit this check (and not perform optimizations that benefit from the check) when targeting platforms that already trap null dereferences, such as platforms that mark low memory pages as unaddressable. Some C++ features, such as delete, have always done call-site null checking.</p>
</blockquote>



<h3>Reducing undefined behavior and semantic bugs</h3>



<p><strong>Tactically, reduce some undefined behavior (UB) and other semantic bugs (pitfalls), for cases where we can automatically diagnose or even fix well-known antipatterns.</strong> Not all UB is bad; any performance-oriented language needs some. But we know there is low-hanging fruit where the programmer’s intent is clear and any UB or pitfall is a definite bug, so we can do one of two things:</p>



<p><strong>(A – Good) Make the pitfall a diagnosed error, with zero false positives — every violation is a real bug.</strong> Two examples mentioned above are to automatically check a[b] to be in bounds and *p and p-&gt; to be non-null.</p>



<p><strong>(B – Ideal) Make the code actually do what the programmer intended, with zero false positives — i.e., fix it by just recompiling.</strong> An example, discussed at the most recent ISO C++ November 2023 meeting, is to default to an implicit <a href="https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2023/p2973r0.html">return *this;</a> when the programmer writes an assignment operator for their type C that returns a C&amp; (note: the same type), but forgets to write a return statement. Today, that is undefined behavior. Yet it’s clear that the programmer meant return *this; — nothing else can be valid. If we make return *this; be the default, all the existing code that accidentally omits the return is not just “no longer UB,” but is guaranteed to do the right and intended thing.</p>



<p><strong>An example of both (A) and (B)</strong> is to support <a href="https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2018/p0893r1.html">chained comparisons</a>, that makes the mathematically valid chains work correctly and rejects the mathematically invalid ones at compile time. Real-world code does write such chains by accident (see: <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/q/8889522/2069064">[a]</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/q/5939077/2069064">[b]</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/q/14433884/2069064">[c]</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/q/46806239/2069064">[d]</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/q/25965157/2069064">[e]</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/q/38643022/2069064">[f]</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/q/45385837/2069064">[g]</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/q/20989496/2069064">[h]</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/q/35564553/2069064">[i]</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/q/42335710/2069064">[j]</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/q/37470518/2069064">[k]</a>).</p>



<ul>
<li>For (A): We can reject all mathematically invalid chains like a != b &gt; c at compile time. This automatically diagnoses bugs in existing code that tries to do such nonsense chains, with perfect accuracy.</li>



<li>For (B): We can fix all existing code that writes would-be-correct chains like 0 &lt;= index &lt; max. Today those silently compile but are completely wrong, and we can make them mean the right thing. This automatically fixes those bugs, just by recompiling the existing code.</li>
</ul>



<p>These examples are not exhaustive. We should review the list of UB in the standard for a more thorough list of cases we can automatically fix (ideally) or diagnose.</p>



<h3>Summarizing: Better defaults for C++</h3>



<p>C++ could enable turning safety rules on by default that would make code:</p>



<ul>
<li>fully type-safe,</li>



<li>fully bounds-safe,</li>



<li>fully initialization-safe,</li>
</ul>



<p>and for lifetime safety, which is the hardest of the four, and where I would expect the remaining vulnerabilities in these categories would mostly lie:</p>



<ul>
<li>fully null-safe,</li>



<li>fully free of owning raw pointers,</li>



<li>with lifetime-safety static analysis that diagnoses most common pointer/iterator/view lifetime errors;</li>
</ul>



<p>and, finally:</p>



<ul>
<li>with less undefined behavior including by automatically fixing existing bugs just by recompiling code with safety enabled by default.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>All of this is efficiently implementable and has been implemented.</strong> Most of the Lifetime rules have been implemented in Visual Studio and CLion, and I’m prototyping a proof-of-concept mode of C++ that includes all of the other above language safeties on-by-default in my <a href="https://github.com/hsutter/cppfront/">cppfront compiler</a>, as well as other safety improvements including an implementation of the current proposal for ISO C++ contracts. I haven’t yet used the prototype at scale. However, I can report that the first major change request I received from early users was to change the bounds checking and null checking from opt-in (off by default) to opt-out (on by default).</p>



<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>Note:</em></strong><em> Please don’t be distracted by that cppfront uses an experimental alternate syntax for C++. That’s because I’m additionally trying to see if we can reach a second orthogonal goal: to make the C++ language itself simpler, and eliminate the need to teach ~90% of the C++ guidance literature related to language complexity and quirks. This essay’s language safety improvements are orthogonal to that, however, and can be applied equally to today’s C++ syntax.</em></p>
</blockquote>



<h3>Solutions need to distinguish between (A) “solution for new-or-updatable code” and (B) “solution for existing code.”</h3>



<p><strong>(A) A “solution for new-or-updatable code” means that to help existing code we have to change/rewrite our code.</strong> This includes not only “(re)write in C#/Rust/Go/Python/…,” but also “annotate your code with <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/code-quality/understanding-sal?view=msvc-170">SAL</a>” or “change your code to use std::span.”</p>



<p>One of the costs of (A) is that anytime we write/change code to fix bugs, we also introduce new bugs; change is never free. We need to recognize that changing our code to use std::span often means non-trivially rewriting parts of it which can also create other bugs. Even annotating our code means writing annotations that can have bugs (this is a common experience in the annotation languages I’ve seen used at scale, such as SAL). All these are significant adoption barriers.</p>



<p>Actually switching to another language means losing a mature ecosystem. C++ is the well-trod path: It’s taught, people know it, the tools exist, interop works, and current regulations have an industry around C++ (such as for functional safety). It takes another decade at least for another language to become the well-trod path, whereas a better C++, and its benefits to the industry broadly, can be here much sooner.</p>



<p><strong>(B) A “solution for existing code” emphasizes the adoptability benefits of not having to make manual code changes.</strong> It includes anything that makes existing code more secure with “just a recompile” (i.e., no binary/ABI/link issues; e.g., ASAN, compiler switches to enable stack checks, static analysis that produces only true positives, or a reliable automated code modernizer).</p>



<p>We will still need (B) no matter how successful new languages or new C++ types/annotations are. And (B) has the strong benefit that it is easier to adopt. Getting to a 98% reduction in CVEs will require both (A) and (B), but if we can deliver even a 30% reduction using just (B) that will be a major benefit for adoption and effective impact in large existing code bases that are hard to change.</p>



<p>Consider how the ideas earlier in this appendix map onto (A) and (B):</p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><td>In C++, by default enforce …</td><td><strong>(A) Solution for new/updated code (can require code changes — no link/binary changes)</strong></td><td><strong>(B) Solution for existing code (requires recompile only — no manual code changes, no link/binary changes)</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Type safety</strong></td><td>Ban all inherently unsafe casts and conversions</td><td>Make unsafe casts and conversions with a safe alternative do the safe thing</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Bounds safety</strong></td><td>Ban pointer arithmetic Ban unchecked iterator arithmetic</td><td>Check in-bounds for all allowed iterator arithmetic Check in-bounds for all subscript operations</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Initialization safety</strong></td><td>Require all variables to be initialized (either at declaration, or before first use)</td><td>—</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Lifetime safety</strong></td><td>Statically diagnose many common pointer/iterator lifetime error cases</td><td>Check not-null for all pointer dereferences</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Less undefined behavior</strong></td><td>Statically diagnose known UB/bug cases, to error on actual bugs in existing code with just a recompile and zero false positives:<br>Ban mathematically invalid comparison chains<br>(add additional cases from UB Annex review)</td><td>Automatically fix known UB/bug cases, to make current bugs in existing code be actually correct with just a recompile and zero false positives: <br>Define mathematically valid comparison chains<br>Default return *this; for C assignment operators that return C&amp;<br>(add additional cases from UB Annex review)</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>By prioritizing adoptability, we can get at least some of the safety benefits just by recompiling existing code, and make the total improvement easier to deploy even when code updates are required. I think that makes it a valuable strategy to pursue.</p>

            <span>Abstract:</span>We introduce the first model-stealing attack that extracts precise, nontrivial information from black-box production language models like OpenAI's ChatGPT or Google's PaLM-2. Specifically, our attack recovers the embedding projection layer (up to symmetries) of a transformer model, given typical API access. For under \$20 USD, our attack extracts the entire projection matrix of OpenAI's Ada and Babbage language models. We thereby confirm, for the first time, that these black-box models have a hidden dimension of 1024 and 2048, respectively. We also recover the exact hidden dimension size of the gpt-3.5-turbo model, and estimate it would cost under \$2,000 in queries to recover the entire projection matrix. We conclude with potential defenses and mitigations, and discuss the implications of possible future work that could extend our attack.

            <span>Abstract:</span>Cosine-similarity is the cosine of the angle between two vectors, or equivalently the dot product between their normalizations. A popular application is to quantify semantic similarity between high-dimensional objects by applying cosine-similarity to a learned low-dimensional feature embedding. This can work better but sometimes also worse than the unnormalized dot-product between embedded vectors in practice. To gain insight into this empirical observation, we study embeddings derived from regularized linear models, where closed-form solutions facilitate analytical insights. We derive analytically how cosine-similarity can yield arbitrary and therefore meaningless `similarities.' For some linear models the similarities are not even unique, while for others they are implicitly controlled by the regularization. We discuss implications beyond linear models: a combination of different regularizations are employed when learning deep models; these have implicit and unintended effects when taking cosine-similarities of the resulting embeddings, rendering results opaque and possibly arbitrary. Based on these insights, we caution against blindly using cosine-similarity and outline alternatives.
