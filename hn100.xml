<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody" data-block-plugin-id="entity_field:node:field_paragraphs">
<p>A news study conducted by University of Rhode Island Professor Jaime Ross investigating the infiltration of microplastics in mammals has revealed that this is far more widespread than initially thought. In fact, the plastic particles were found to bioaccumulate in every organ, including, startlingly enough, the brain.</p>

<p>Microplastics are among the most pervasive pollutants on the planet. They have been <a href="https://www.sustainableplastics.com/news/its-raining-plastic-say-researchers" data-omnilocation="articlebody" data-omnilink="editorial-link">discovered in the air</a>, in <a href="https://www.sustainableplastics.com/news/microplastics-pollution-levels-thames-are-devastating-aquatic-life" data-omnilocation="articlebody" data-omnilink="editorial-link">water systems </a>and food chains around the world. While their negative impacts on marine organisms have been established, few studies have examined the potential health impacts on mammals.</p>

<p>“Research on the health effects of microplastics, especially in mammals, is still very limited,” said Ross, an assistant professor of biomedical and pharmaceutical sciences at the Ryan Institute for Neuroscience and the College of Pharmacy.</p>

<p>The study noted that humans are exposed to microplastics&nbsp; through the consumption of ‘water, seafood, consumer products (clothes, toothpaste, salt, sugar, honey, beer, anything stored in plastic bottles, plastic wrap, or cans/cartons lined with plastic), and via inhalation from textiles, synthetic rubber tires, and plastic covers’. They have been detected, among others, in <a href="https://www.sustainableplastics.com/news/dutch-study-finds-microplastics-human-blood-first-time" data-omnilocation="articlebody" data-omnilink="editorial-link">blood</a> and even breast milk - findings that warrant more investigation into the health outcomes of such exposure in mammals. Currently, there are limited studies that address the potential adverse effects of exposure to MPs on brain health in mammals and even fewer studies that consider age as an additional factor that may impact the outcome of exposure to microplastics - the reason Ross and her team chose to focus on neurobehavioral effects and inflammatory response to exposure to microplastics, as well as the accumulation of microplastics in tissues. Together with graduate students Lauren Gaspar and Sydney Bartman, she examined the biological and cognitive consequences of exposure to microplastics in mice.</p>

<p>The drinking water of a diverse group of older and younger mice was spiked with microplastics over a period of three weeks - with ‘striking’ results, said Ross. The researchers found that exposure to microplastics - in this case, fluorescent polystyrene particles -&nbsp; induced both behavioural changes and alterations in immune markers in liver and brain tissues. The mice in the study began to move peculiarly, and to exhibit behaviours reminiscent of dementia in humans. The results were even more profound in older animals.</p>

<p>“These were not high doses of microplastics, but in only a short period of time, we saw these changes,” Ross said. “Nobody really understands the life cycle of these microplastics in the body, so part of what we want to address is the question of what happens as you get older. Are you more susceptible to systemic inflammation from these microplastics as you age? Can your body get rid of them as easily? Do your cells respond differently to these toxins?”</p>

<p>After three weeks, dissection of the mice revealed that the ingested PS micro-particles had infiltrated every every tissue sample - liver, kidney, gastrointestinal tract, lung, spleen, heart, and brain tissues from both young and old exposed mice&nbsp; - tested. The particles were also observed in the mice’s bodily wastes.</p>

<p>“The detection of MPs in tissues such as the heart and lungs … suggests that the PS-MPs (polystyrene microplastics) are going beyond the digestive system and likely undergoing systemic circulation,” the authors write. An observation they note that is further supported by the detection of microplastics in urine and the brain, indicating they can pass the blood–brain barrier.</p>

<p>That brain infiltration also may cause a decrease in glial fibrillary acidic protein, called “GFAP”, a protein that supports many cell processes in the brain, results have shown. Previous studies have suggested that GFAP expression might decrease in early stages of some neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer’s disease, or in younger patients with depression disorders.</p>

<p>What is especially concerning is the fact that these changes were seen after just three weeks of exposure to microplastics. As human exposure today is inevitable it is therefore essential to better understand their toxicity to limit their impact on human health. The present study, showed that in just three weeks, polystyrene particles measuring 0.1 and 2 μm can reduce cell viability, translocate throughout the body, accumulate in tissues including brain tissue, markedly modify behaviour in mice, and significantly alter immune markers in both the liver and the brain. Additionally, the effects of exposure seem to be age-dependent.</p>

<p>Future work is needed to examine these factors in order to understand the mechanisms behind these effects and the changes seen with age, said Ross.</p>

<p>“We want to understand how plastics may change the ability for the brain to maintain its homeostasis or how exposure may lead to neurological disorders and diseases, such as Alzheimer’s disease,” she said.</p>

<p>The study was published in the International Journal of Molecular Science. It was supported by the Rhode Island Medical Research Foundation, Roddy Foundation, Plastics Initiative, URI College of Pharmacy, George and Anne Ryan Institute for Neuroscience, and the Rhode Island Institutional Development Award (IDeA) Network of Biomedical Research Excellence from the National Institute of General Medical Sciences of the National Institutes of Health.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<h3>Aug 29 2023</h3>

<p><img src="https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/asset/ipvnQ92fc1" alt="A broken fuse"></p>
<p>Border Gateway Protocol is the de facto protocol that directs routing decisions between different ISP networks, and is generally known as the “glue” that holds the internet together. It’s safe to say that the internet we currently know would not function without working BGP implementations.</p>
<p>However, the software on those networks’ routers (I will refer to these as edge devices from now on) that implements BGP has not had a flawless track record. Flaws and problems do exist in commercial and open source implementations of the world’s most critical routing protocol.</p>
<p>Most of these flaws are of course benign in the grand scheme of things; they will be issues around things like route filtering, or insertion, or <a href="https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/post/bgp-stuck-routes-tcp-zero-window">handling withdraws</a>. However a much more scary issue is a BGP bug that can propagate after causing bad behaviour, akin to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_worm">computer worm</a>.</p>
<p>While debugging support for a future feature for my business (bgp.tools) I took a brief diversion to investigate something, and what I came out with might be one of the most concerning things I’ve discovered for the reliability of the internet. To understand the problems, though, we will need a bit more context.</p>
<h2>A mistaken attribute</h2>
<p>On 2 June 2023, a <a href="https://bgp.tools/as/264366">small Brazilian network</a> (re)announced one of their internet routes with a small bit of information called an attribute that was corrupted. The information on this route was for a feature that had not finished standardisation, but was set up in such a way that if an intermediate router did not understand it, then the intermediate router would pass it on unchanged.</p>
<p>As many routers did not understand this attribute, this was no problem for them. They just took the information and propagated it along. However it turned out that Juniper routers running even slightly modern software did understand this attribute, and since the attribute was corrupted the software in its default configuration would respond by raising an error that would shut down the whole BGP session. Since a BGP session is often a critical part of being “connected” to the wider internet, this resulted in the small Brazilian network disrupting other networks’ ability to communicate with the rest of the internet, despite being 1000’s of miles away.</p>
<p>The packet that causes session shutdowns was really quite benign at first glance:</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/asset/7CcFultij0" alt="A screenshot of wireshark"></p>
<p>When a BGP session shuts down due to errors, customer network traffic generally stops flowing down that cable until the BGP connection is automatically restarted (typically within seconds to minutes).</p>
<p>This appears to be what happened to a number of different carriers, for example <a href="https://bgp.tools/as/8220">COLT</a> was heavily impacted by this. Their outage is what originally drew some of my attention to this subject area.</p>
<p>To understand why this sort of thing can happen, we’ll need to take a deeper look at what BGP route attributes are, and what they’re used for.</p>
<h2>What is a BGP Route Attribute?</h2>
<p>At their core a BGP UPDATEs purpose is to tell another router about some traffic that it can (or can no longer) send to it. However just knowing directly what you can send to another router is not very useful without <em>context</em>.</p>
<p>For this reason a BGP packet is split up into two sections: the Network Layer Reachability Information (NLRI) data (aka, the IP address ranges), and the attributes that help describe extra context about that reachability data.</p>
<p>Arguably the most used attribute is the AS_PATH (or actually, the AS4_PATH), an attribute that tells you which networks a route has travelled through to get to you. Routers use this list of networks to pick paths for their traffic that are either the fastest, economically viable, or least congested, playing a critical role in ensuring that things run smoothly.</p>
<p>At the time of writing there are over 32 different route attribute types, 14 deprecated ones, and 209 officially unassigned ones. The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) is in charge of <a href="https://www.iana.org/assignments/bgp-parameters/bgp-parameters.xhtml#bgp-parameters-2">assigning codes to each BGP attribute type codes</a>, normally off the back of IETF Internet-Drafts. The IANA list doesn’t always give the full story, though, as not all internet-drafts make their way into more official documents (like RFC’s), so code numbers are assigned (or sometimes even “squatted”) to attribute types that did not get wide deployment.</p>
<h2>Unknown attribute propagation</h2>
<p>At the start of every route attribute is a set of flags, conveying information about the attribute. One important flag is called the “transitive bit”:</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/asset/BSaiOklQh0" alt="A wireshark decoding of the BGP Path Attribuites Flags"></p>
<p>If a BGP implementation does not understand an attribute, and the transitive bit is set, it will copy it to another router. If the router does understand the attribute then it may apply its own policy.</p>
<p>At a glance this “feature” seems like an incredibly bad idea, as it allows possibly unknown information to propagate blindly through systems that do not understand the impact of what they are forwarding. However this feature has also allowed widespread deployment of things like <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8195">Large Communities</a> to happen faster, and has arguably made deployment of new BGP features possible at all.</p>
<h2>When attribute decoding goes wrong</h2>
<p>What happens when an attribute fails to decode? The answer depends strongly on if the BGP implementation has been updated to use <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7606">RFC 7606</a> logic or not; If the session is <em>not</em> <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7606">RFC 7606</a> compliant, then typically an error is raised and the session is shut down. If it is, the session can usually continue as normal (except the routes impacted by the decoding error are treated as unreachable).</p>
<p>BGP session shutdowns are particularly undesirable, as they will impact traffic flow along a path. However in the case of a “Transitive” error they can become worm-like. Since not all BGP implementations support the same attributes, an attribute that is unknown to one implementation (and subsequently forwarded along) can cause another implementation to shut down the session it received it from.</p>
<p>With some reasonably educated crafting of a payload, someone could design a BGP UPDATE that “travels” along the internet unharmed, until it reaches a targeted vendor and results in that vendor resetting sessions. If that data comes down the BGP connections that are providing wider internet access for the network, this could result in a network being pulled offline from the internet.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/asset/vQvI0ZQC9V" alt=""></p>
<p>This attack is not even a one-off “hit-and-run”, as the “bad” route is still stored in the peer router; when the session restarts the victim router will reset again the moment the route with the crafted payload is transmitted again. This has the potential to cause prolonged internet or peering outages.</p>
<p>This is a large part of why the RFC mentioned earlier, RFC 7606, exists; looking at its security considerations section, we can see a description of this exact problem::</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Security Considerations
This specification addresses the vulnerability of a BGP speaker to a
potential attack whereby a distant attacker can generate a malformed
optional transitive attribute that is not recognized by intervening
routers. Since the intervening routers do not recognize the
attribute, they propagate it without checking it. When the malformed
attribute arrives at a router that does recognize the given attribute
type, that router resets the session over which it arrived. Since
significant fan-out can occur between the attacker and the routers
that do recognize the attribute type, this attack could potentially
be particularly harmful.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In a basic BGP setup this is bad, but with extra engineering it could be used to partition large sections of the internet. If BGP sessions between carriers are forced to reset in this way, causing traffic flow to stop, some routes on the internet would not have alternatives to use, making this a family of bugs that is a grave threat to the overall reliability of the internet.</p>
<h2>Building a basic fuzzer</h2>
<div>
<p><b>Important Commitment:</b> I run a business that involves being peered to many IXP route servers and other peoples routers. I have not and will not ever test for BGP bugs/exploits on customer/partner sessions (unless they give consent).</p>
<p>All testing here has been done either on <a href="https://www.gns3.com/">GNS3</a> VMs, or physical hardware I have hanging around and in isolated VLANs.</p>
</div>
<p>To figure out if this would be a practically exploitable attack, I decided to write a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuzzing">fuzzer</a> that would try to stuff random data in random attribute codes to see if I could get sessions to reset on different vendors BGP implementations.</p>
<p>Because I am looking for problems that are “wormable”, I added a <a href="https://bird.network.cz/">Bird 2</a> router in between my fuzzer and the router being tested. This way Bird will filter out all of the obvious non-exploitable issues, and leave me with the packets that are of concern.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/asset/ppvsN8rslG" alt=""></p>
<p>All good fuzzers should be able to run unattended, so how do we teach the fuzzer to tell if the session has reset itself? The solution I came to was that the Victim router would always announce a keepalive prefix, 192.0.2.0/24 (aka <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5735"><code>TEST-NET-1</code></a>) and the fuzzer would treat a withdraw of that prefix (from the intermediate bird router) as a sign the session went down, and report back the parameters that caused that to happen!</p>
<p>Testing the fuzzer, I can see that the bird output shows unknown attributes as their type code, and a hex encoding of their contents. In addition it puts a <code>[t]</code> to indicate that it is transitive.</p>
<pre><code>198.51.100.0/24      unicast [fuzzer 21:31:24.378] * (100) [AS65001?]
	via 192.168.5.1 on ens5
	Type: BGP univ
	BGP.origin: Incomplete
	BGP.as_path: 65001
	BGP.next_hop: 192.168.5.1
	BGP.local_pref: 100
	BGP.community: (123,2345)
	BGP.ec [t]: 7d cc c7 30
</code></pre>
<p>Now that the fuzzer was able to run itself, all that was left was to test all of the vendors one by one…</p>
<h2>Fuzzer findings / Impacted Vendors</h2>
<p>Keep in mind that the described issues are applicable if you are running an edge device with full BGP tables. If you are not running a “full routing table” or a partial peering table, then you are less likely to be impacted by these discoveries.</p>
<p>Another thing to keep in mind, the issues below are different to the ones that <a href="https://www.blackhat.com/us-23/briefings/schedule/index.html#route-to-bugs-analyzing-the-security-of-bgp-message-parsing-32162">the team at Forescout recently presented at BlackHat</a>.</p>
<p>Unimpacted Vendors:</p>
<ul>
<li>MikroTik RouterOS 7+</li>
<li>Ubiquiti EdgeOS</li>
<li>Arista EOS</li>
<li>Huawei NE40</li>
<li>Cisco IOS-XE / “Classic” / XR</li>
<li>Bird 1.6, All versions of Bird 2.0</li>
</ul>
<h2>Juniper JunOS Impact</h2>
<p>Similar to the problem that caused this research to be done, another exploitable Attribute was found in the form of Attribute 29 (BGP-LS). Due to the nature of the attribute it is unlikely that an exploit attempt will propagate too far over the internet, however peering sessions and route servers are still at risk.</p>
<p>All Juniper users are <strong>urged</strong> to enable <code>bgp-error-tolerance</code>:</p>
<pre><code>[edit protocols bgp]
root# show 
group TRANSIT {
    import import-pol;
    export send-direct;
    peer-as 4200000001;
    local-as 4200000002;
    neighbor 192.0.2.2;
}
bgp-error-tolerance;
</code></pre>
<p>In all tested cases, enabling bgp-error-tolerance does not reset sessions, and applies the improved behaviour without restarting sessions.</p>
<p>A JunOS software release is expected in the future to correct this. One member of staff at Juniper has also <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-haas-idr-bgp-attribute-escape-00">authored an Internet-Draft at the IETF</a> around handling these issues. Juniper is tracking this issue as CVE-2023-4481.</p>
<h2>Nokia SR-OS Impact</h2>
<p>Fuzzing SR-OS (Version 22.10) revealed many, likely highly propagatable and thus exploitable attributes.</p>
<p>All Nokia SR-OS and SR-Linux users are <strong>urged</strong> to enable <code>error-handling update-fault-tolerance</code> on their devices.</p>
<pre><code> bgp
     group "TRANSIT"              
         export "yes"
         error-handling
             update-fault-tolerance
         exit
         neighbor 192.0.2.2
             peer-as 2
         exit
     exit
     no shutdown
 exit
</code></pre>
<p>In all tested cases, enabling update-fault-tolerance does not reset sessions, and applies the improved behaviour without restarting sessions.</p>
<p>To the best of my understanding, Nokia has no plans to correct these issues, instead suggesting customers apply <code>error-handling update-fault-tolerance</code> to their BGP groups.</p>
<h2>FRR Impact (and other downstream vendors)</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/FRRouting/frr">FRR</a> attempts to handle bad attributes using RFC 7606 behaviour. However the fuzzer discovered that a corrupted attribute 23 (Tunnel Encapsulation) will cause a session to go down regardless.</p>
<p>After reporting this bug to FRR maintainers I received an acknowledgement of the issue and understanding that the issue is a DoS risk to FRR users, but I have not managed to get anything out of FRR since.</p>
<p>This bug is being tracked as CVE-2023-38802 and at the time of writing has no patch or fix.</p>
<p>FRR is packaged inside many other products, to name a few: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SONiC_(operating_system)">SONIC</a>, <a href="https://www.pica8.com/">PICA8</a>, <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-gb/networking/ethernet-switching/cumulus-linux/">Cumulus</a>, and <a href="https://www.danosproject.org/">DANOS</a>.</p>
<h2>OpenBSD OpenBGPd Impact</h2>
<p>OpenBGPd also supports the improved RFC 7606 behaviour, however it was found that the recently added <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9234.html">Only To Customer</a> implementation could cause session resets. This issue was very rapidly fixed after being reported to them, and is tracked as CVE-2023-38283.</p>
<p>OpenBSD users can install <a href="https://www.openbsd.org/errata73.html">Eratta 006</a> to mitigate this issue.</p>
<h2>Extreme Networks EXOS Impact</h2>
<p>As a result of fuzzing EXOS, the program revealed 2 highly propagatable and thus exploitable attributes in the form of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Attribute 21: AS_PATHLIMIT</li>
<li>Attribute 25: IPv6 Address Specific Extended Community</li>
</ul>
<p>There is currently no known patch or mitigating config for this issue.</p>
<p>I made Extreme aware of this problem, however after a back and forth with them waiting for what I understood was an implied release of a patch or fix, they communicated that they will not be fixing it in the near future.</p>
<p>A quote from the security email thread (I’ve added emphasis to the critical parts of their response):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After review of all the material, <strong>we are not considering this a vulnerability due to the presence of RFC 7606</strong>, as well as a history of documentation expressing these concerns all the way back to early 2000s, if not earlier. Malformed attributes are not a novel concept as an attack vector to BGP networks, as evidenced by RFC 7606, which is almost a decade old.
As such, customers that have chosen to not require or implement RFC 7606 have done so willingly and with knowledge of what is needed to defend against these types of attacks. Thus, the expectation that we’ll reset our BGP sessions based on RFC 4271 attribute handling is proper. We do abide by other RFCs, in which we claim support, that update RFC 4271.
Other vendors do claim RFC 7606 support and have been sharing these controls as a mitigation to malformed attribute response. They don’t appear to be producing new work product to account for these behaviors.
<strong>We are evaluating support for RFC 7606 as a future feature.</strong> Obviously, if customers desire a different response, we’ll work through our normal feature request pipelines to address. This is no different than any other RFC support request.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I cannot overstate how much I disagree with Extreme’s response to this, and in the interests of full transparency (and to avoid any allegations of editorialising this, in my view, extremely poor response), I have made the full email exchange available here: <a href="https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/asset/JgH8G5duO1">(PDF)</a>.</p>
<h2>The Vendor Security Response</h2>
<p>I’ve been through my fair share of security issue discoveries, and over time I’ve taken a stronger leaning into “simply do not report” or “full disclosure without warning”, rather than the now commonly accepted 90 day “responsible disclosure” methodology. This is mostly because I’ve had really poor experiences when disclosing issues to security teams.</p>
<p>The bugs discussed in this post cover many vendors and implementations. Full disclosure was originally my plan, however due to the clear risk of harm to the general internet routing system from these findings, I felt it was likely inexcusable to do full-disclosure. (Plus, a malicious deployment of these findings could have a small but I believe very real chance of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinetic_military_action">“kinetic response”</a> from a misunderstanding.)</p>
<p>Overall the response from vendors has been mostly disappointing. One vendor was extremely hard to find contacts for, and I feel that they were stringing me along for some time, only to reply back that they were not going to fix the problem.</p>
<p>Other vendors notably were not immediately interested in notifying customers of mitigating config to the problems, however when I personally started extending notices to my peers at larger carriers about the problems (since if they were not going to, I was going to try and reduce the exploit surface) a vendor notice was issued.</p>
<p>No vendor that I reported to has any form of bug bounty, and this entire adventure has consumed huge volumes of my time and mental capacity. In a normal situation this “cost” would have simply been eaten by an employer whose interest is name recognition or altruistic actions. However I am self-employed with my own company (that admittedly does have an interest in a functioning BGP ecosystem), and so this entire adventure has simply delayed product development that I (and customers) really would have liked to have done.</p>
<p>With all of that in mind, my “good faith” advice to people reporting security bugs in network vendor software is that contacting vendors is not an effective solution.</p>
<p>The people on the other side are either already overloaded, or generally don’t care about receiving issues. Since there is no motivation to report bugs (either in the form of bug bounties, or being treated well), I see no reason to do responsible disclosure (apart from cases where it would clearly protect their innocent customers from misery, while accounting for the risk of a vendor simply doing nothing).</p>
<p>The two options, as far as I see it, are either being strung along by a vendor over email for 90 days and then likely finding out nothing is done, or full disclosure.</p>
<p>I worry about the state of networking vendors.</p>
<p>With that being said, I would like to thank the OpenBSD security team, who very rapidly acknowledged my report, and prepared a patch. My only regret with dealing with the OpenBSD team was reporting the issue to them too quickly, as they are uninterested in waiting for any kind of coordination in disclosure.</p>
<h2>Closing thoughts</h2>
<p>As mentioned before, with a few of the vendors (Nokia, Extreme, Juniper) I found myself contacting their own customers myself to warn them to enable mitigating config, as that proved to be a much more effective way at preventing risk than trying to push the vendor itself into action.</p>
<p>As a result at least several incumbent ISPs, 1 large CDN, and 2 “Tier 1” networks have applied configuration to help prevent these issues from impacting them.</p>
<p>If the goal of reporting security flaws is to reduce harm to their customers, I’m not convinced that reporting problems to vendors has enough of an effective impact to be worth doing, vs the loss of personal time and sanity.</p>
<p>Several people I spoke to have been incredibly helpful (some who could not be listed here). I would like to thank the following people for having some role in helping me either discover/disclose these problems, editing this post, or general support for when vendors were being very frustrating.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <article>
    <p>There is a machine learning bubble, but the technology is here to stay. Once the
bubble pops, the world <em>will</em> be changed by machine learning. But it will
probably be crappier, not better.</p>
<p>Contrary to the AI doomer’s expectations, the world isn’t going to go down in
flames any faster thanks to AI. Contemporary advances in machine learning aren’t
really getting us any closer to AGI, and as Randall Monroe pointed out back in
2018:</p>
<p><img src="https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/robot_future_2x.png" alt="A panel from the webcomic “xkcd” showing a timeline from now into the distantfuture, dividing the timeline into the periods between “AI becomes advancedenough to control unstoppable swarms of robots” and “AI becomes self-aware andrebels against human control”. The period from self-awareness to the indefinitefuture is labelled “the part lots of people seem to worry about”; Randall isinstead worried about the part between these two epochs."></p>
<p>What will happen to AI is boring old capitalism. Its staying power will come in
the form of replacing competent, expensive humans with crappy, cheap robots.
LLMs are a pretty good advance over Markov chains, and stable diffusion can
generate images which are only somewhat uncanny with sufficient manipulation of
the prompt. Mediocre programmers will use GitHub Copilot to write trivial code
and boilerplate for them (trivial code is tautologically uninteresting), and ML
will probably remain useful for writing cover letters for you. Self-driving cars
might show up Any Day Now™, which is going to be great for sci-fi
enthusiasts and technocrats, but much worse in every respect than, say,
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dKrUE_O0VE">building more trains</a>.</p>
<p>The biggest lasting changes from machine learning will be more like the
following:</p>
<ul>
<li>A reduction in the labor force for skilled creative work</li>
<li>The complete elimination of humans in customer-support roles</li>
<li>More convincing spam and phishing content, more scalable scams</li>
<li>SEO hacking content farms dominating search results</li>
<li>Book farms (both eBooks and paper) flooding the market</li>
<li>AI-generated content overwhelming social media</li>
<li>Widespread propaganda and astroturfing, both in politics and advertising</li>
</ul>
<p>AI companies will continue to generate waste and CO<sub>2</sub> emissions at a
huge scale as they aggressively scrape all internet content they can find,
externalizing costs onto the world’s digital infrastructure, and feed their
hoard into GPU farms to generate their models. They might keep humans in the
loop to help with tagging content, seeking out the cheapest markets with the
weakest labor laws to build human sweatshops to feed the AI data monster.</p>
<p>You will never trust another product review. You will never speak to a human
being at your ISP again. Vapid, pithy media will fill the digital world around
you. Technology built for engagement farms – those AI-edited videos with the
grating machine voice you’ve seen on your feeds lately – will be white-labeled
and used to push products and ideologies at a massive scale with a minimum cost
from social media accounts which are populated with AI content, cultivate an
audience, and sold in bulk and in good standing with the Algorithm.</p>
<p>All of these things are already happening and will continue to get worse. The
future of media is a soulless, vapid regurgitation of all media that came before
the AI epoch, and the fate of all new creative media is to be subsumed into the
roiling pile of math.</p>
<p>This will be incredibly profitable for the AI barons, and to secure their
investment they are deploying an immense, expensive, world-wide propaganda
campaign. To the public, the present-day and potential future capabilities of
the technology are played up in breathless promises of ridiculous possibility.
In closed-room meetings, much more realistic promises are made of cutting
payroll budgets in half.</p>
<p>The propaganda also leans into the mystical sci-fi AI canon, the threat of smart
computers with world-ending power, the forbidden allure of a new Manhattan
project and all of its consequences, the long-prophesied singularity. The
technology is nowhere near this level, a fact well-known by experts and the
barons themselves, but the illusion is maintained in the interests of lobbying
lawmakers to help the barons erect a moat around their new industry.</p>
<p>Of course, AI does present a threat of violence, but as Randall points out, it’s
not from the AI itself, but rather from the people that employ it. The US
military is testing out AI-controlled drones, which aren’t going to be
self-aware but will scale up human errors (or human malice) until innocent
people are killed. AI tools are already being used to set bail and parole
conditions&nbsp;– it can put you in jail or keep you there. Police are using AI for
facial recognition and “predictive policing”. Of course, all of these models end
up discriminating against minorities, depriving them of liberty and often
getting them killed.</p>
<p>AI is defined by aggressive capitalism. The hype bubble has been engineered by
investors and capitalists dumping money into it, and the returns they expect on
that investment are going to come out of your pocket. The singularity is not
coming, but the most realistic promises of AI are going to make the world worse.
The AI revolution is here, and I don’t really like it.</p>

  <summary>Flame bait</summary>
I had much more inflammatory article drafted for this topic under the title
"ChatGPT is the new techno-atheist's substitute for God". It makes some fairly
pointed comparisons between the cryptocurrency cult and the machine learning
cult and the religious, unshakeable, and largely ignorant faith in both
technologies as the harbingers of progress. It was fun to write, but this is
probably the better article.
<p>I found this Hacker News comment and quoted it in the original draft: “It’s
probably worth talking to GPT4 before seeking professional help [to deal with
depression].”</p>
<p>In case you need to hear it: <a href="https://www.euronews.com/next/2023/03/31/man-ends-his-life-after-an-ai-chatbot-encouraged-him-to-sacrifice-himself-to-stop-climate-">do not</a> (TW: suicide) seek out OpenAI’s
services to help with your depression. Finding and setting up an appointment
with a therapist can be difficult for a lot of people – it’s okay for it to
feel hard. Talk to your friends and ask them to help you find the right care for
your needs.</p>

<h4>About</h4><p><span>✕</span></p><div>
<p>Initially conceived in 2011 by Associate Professor Steven Halim, VisuAlgo aimed to facilitate a deeper understanding of data structures and algorithms for his students by providing a self-paced, interactive learning platform.</p><p>Featuring numerous advanced algorithms discussed in Dr. Steven Halim's book, 'Competitive Programming' — co-authored with Dr. Felix Halim and Dr. Suhendry Effendy — VisuAlgo remains the exclusive platform for visualizing and animating several of these complex algorithms even after a decade.</p><p>While primarily designed for National University of Singapore (NUS) students enrolled in various data structure and algorithm courses (e.g., CS1010/equivalent, CS2040/equivalent (including IT5003), CS3230, CS3233, and CS4234), VisuAlgo also serves as a valuable resource for inquisitive minds worldwide, promoting online learning.</p><p>Initially, VisuAlgo was not designed for small touch screens like smartphones, as intricate algorithm visualizations required substantial pixel space and click-and-drag interactions. For an optimal user experience, a minimum screen resolution of 1366x768 is recommended. However, since April 2022, a mobile (lite) version of VisuAlgo has been made available, making it possible to use a subset of VisuAlgo features on smartphone screens.</p><p>VisuAlgo remains a work in progress, with the ongoing development of more complex visualizations. At present, the platform features 24 visualization modules.</p><p>Equipped with a built-in question generator and answer verifier, VisuAlgo's "online quiz system" enables students to test their knowledge of basic data structures and algorithms. Questions are randomly generated based on specific rules, and students' answers are automatically graded upon submission to our grading server. As more CS instructors adopt this online quiz system worldwide, it could effectively eliminate manual basic data structure and algorithm questions from standard Computer Science exams in many universities. By assigning a small (but non-zero) weight to passing the online quiz, CS instructors can significantly enhance their students' mastery of these basic concepts, as they have access to an almost unlimited number of practice questions that can be instantly verified before taking the online quiz. Each VisuAlgo visualization module now includes its own online quiz component.</p><p>VisuAlgo has been translated into three primary languages: English, Chinese, and Indonesian. Additionally, we have authored public notes about VisuAlgo in various languages, including Indonesian, Korean, Vietnamese, and Thai:</p>

The book “<a href="https://pragprog.com/titles/tvmelixir/adopting-elixir/">Adopting Elixir, From Concept to Production (2018)</a>“ by Ben Marx, José Valim, Bruce Tate is an excellent guide to the strategic and technical reasons to use Elixir in your business. The very first chapter clearly illustrates the benefits.  </p>
<p>
<em>Pinterest used Elixir for focused, high-volume, high-impact service around performance tooling and monitoring. Steve Cohen is a software engineer who’s been working with their early adoption teams:</em></p>
<p>
<em><strong>José</strong>: Why did you choose Elixir?</em></p>
<p>
<em><strong>Steve</strong>: We chose Elixir because we were looking for a system that was easy for programmers to understand and could take better advantage of our servers. I was intrigued at Elixir’s combination of friendly syntax, powerful metaprogramming features, and incorporation of the Actor model.</em></p>
<p>
<em><strong>José</strong>: How has your company benefited from Elixir?</em></p>
<p>
<em><strong>Steve</strong>: That’s pretty easy. When I started on the spam team, we had close to 1,400 servers running. When we converted several parts to Elixir, we reduced that by around 95%. One of the systems that ran on 200 Python servers now runs on four Elixir servers (it can actually run on two servers, but we felt that four provided more fault tolerance). The combined effect of better architecture and Elixir saved Pinterest over $2 million per year in server costs. In addition, the performance and reliability of the systems went up despite running on drastically less hardware. When our notifications system was running on Java, it was on 30 c32.xl instances. When we switched over to Elixir, we could run on 15. Despite running on less hardware, the response times dropped significantly, as did errors.</em></p>
<p>
A language that enables companies to save money while improving reliability and performance seems like fantasy. Elixir is able to demonstrate this incredible result because the language is built on top of Erlang, a platform designed for concurrent software that must stay online. Banking portals, e-commerce sites, and SaaS products are just a few examples, most business software today has this requirement. The story of Elixir improving a product while reducing costs repeats itself.</p>

<em>@coryodaniel</em></p>
<p>
<em>Rewrote an #AWS APIGateway &amp; #lambda service that was costing us about $16000 / month in #elixir. Its running in 3 nodes that cost us about $150 / month.</em></p>
<p>
<em>12 million requests / hour with sub-second latency, ~300GB of throughput / day.</em></p>
<hr>
<p>
<a href="https://twitter.com/coryodaniel">Cory O’Daniel</a> noticed this benefit in 2018, <a href="https://medium.com/coryodaniel/from-erverless-to-elixir-48752db4d7bc">releasing a detailed technical blog post</a> based on the enormous interest his tweet generated. The above example is not surprising to anyone who has worked on a complicated serverless system. The hosting costs quickly become unreasonable, and it may not be possible to run the code locally on your machine when making a change, adding days of expensive development time. Developers love Elixir for the excellent experience it provides when creating software, and the business loves how much more work gets done ahead of schedule. </p>
<p>
Bleacher Report, a top real time sports and media website, was hitting scaling problems due to their business success. With Elixir, they were able to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20181011093614/https://www.techworld.com/apps-wearables/how-elixir-helped-bleacher-report-handle-8x-more-traffic-3653957/">8x the average daily traffic load, going from 150 servers to only 5</a>:</p>
<p>
<em>The site was originally written on the&nbsp;Ruby on Rails&nbsp;framework&nbsp;but Bleacher Report reached the point where they could no longer scale it, according to Dave Marks, BR’s senior engineering director.</em></p>
<p>
<em>Elixir has proven so efficient that testing the limits of our services became a challenge unto itself, requiring investment in new benchmarking tools and strategies. In a recent test, for example, our most heavily trafficked service was able to handle 8x our average traffic load, without autoscaling, before the database proved to be a bottleneck,” he said.</em></p>
<p>
<em>“On our monolith we needed roughly 150 servers to power the more intensive portions of BR. Following our move to Elixir we’re now able to power those same functions on five servers and we’re probably overprovisioned. We could probably get away with it on two,” Marks says.</em></p>
<p>
Let’s do a Fermi estimate where each server costs $17,000/year. </p>
<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
One server:      </td>
      <td>
$17,000/year (example)      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>

    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<p>
The final result was a 97% reduction in the server bill, with improved reliability and performance. All this is possible because Elixir, and the Erlang platform underneath, are fundamentally designed for always-online software with many users. When you use the right tool for the job, the benefits are clear. </p>

In theory this doesn't sound like a hard problem, but in practice oh good heavens.</p><p><a href="https://gitforwindows.org/">Git for Windows</a> is built on top of <a href="https://www.msys2.org/">msys2</a>, which in turn is built on top of <a href="https://www.cygwin.com/">Cygwin</a>. This is an astonishing artifact that allows you to build roughly unmodified POSIXish code on top of Windows, despite the terrible impedance mismatches inherent in this. One is that until 2017, Windows had no native support for Unix sockets. That's kind of a big deal for compatibility purposes, so Cygwin worked around it. It's, uh, <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23086038/what-mechanism-is-used-by-msys-cygwin-to-emulate-unix-domain-sockets">kind of awful</a>. If you're not a Cygwin/msys app but you want to implement a socket they can communicate with, you need to implement this undocumented protocol yourself. This isn't <em>impossible</em>, but ugh.</p><p>But going to all this trouble helps you avoid another problem! The Microsoft version of OpenSSH ships an SSH agent that doesn't use Unix sockets, but uses a named pipe instead. So if you want to communicate between Cygwinish OpenSSH (as is shipped with git for Windows) and the SSH agent shipped with Windows, you need something that bridges between those. The state of the art seems to be to use <a href="https://github.com/jstarks/npiperelay">npiperelay</a> with <a href="http://www.dest-unreach.org/socat/">socat</a>, but if you're already writing something that implements the Cygwin socket protocol you can just use <a href="https://github.com/natefinch/npipe">npipe</a> to talk to the shipped ssh-agent and then export your own socket interface.</p><p>And, amazingly, this all works? I've managed to hack together an SSH agent (using <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/crypto/ssh/agent">Go's SSH agent</a> implementation) that can satisfy hardware backed queries itself, but forward things on to the Windows agent for compatibility with other tooling. Now I just need to figure out how to plumb it through to WSL. Sigh.</p></div></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In this article, I describe my journey creating a <a href="https://github.com/FractalFir/rustc_codegen_clr">barely functional rust backend enabling compilation for the .NET runtime</a> (Usually used to run C# and F#).</p>

<p>It is currently in the proof-of-concept stage, but I believe it still may be of some interest.</p>

<h2 id="why_would_one_compile_rust_for_.net_runtime?">Why would one compile Rust for .NET runtime?</h2>

<p>At first, one might dismiss the idea right away. Why on earth would you compile Rust to the .NET runtime, if you can compile it to all architectures and OSes that .NET supports? Why even bother? There are a couple of reasons why.</p>

<ol type="1">
<li>It is pretty fun. I admit, there were moments where I was banging my head on the wall a little bit too much, almost waking my family at night. There were moments where I was reconsidering my life choices. But what is a good programming exercise, without some pain?</li>

<li>It could make Rust/C# inter-op easier and <strong>FAR</strong> more powerful. Don't get me wrong, it is not all that hard right now. You do have to ship a compiled rust library for all the platforms you want to support, and use P/Invoke to interact with it, but that is all, in terms of complexity. But you are limited to C-ABI. You can't simply pass a managed C# array to Rust (without marshaling), or send managed references to C# objects to Rust. While this codegen does not allow that <em>yet</em>, it will in the future.</li>

<li>It enables using fast Rust libraries from C#. When (and if) the project matures, you could write a fast Rust library, and provide a C#/F# compatible version. To all outsiders, this would seem just like yet another C# library, just faster and with a bit of unsafe sprinkled about.</li>

<li>Much smaller memory footprint. Rust likes to guide you, to allocate all you can on the stack. This reduces memory usage, and produces nothing for GC to collect. This should make its life far easier.  Additionally, Rust will allocate only unmanaged heap memory. What does that mean? This is the memory GC knows not to worry about. It is the job of the program to free it. This fits nicely with Rust's memory management.</li>

<li>Ability to use Rust with .NET exclusive tools. Would it not be nice to just use Rust with all the numerous .NET tools? To potentially, far off in the future, write Unity games with Rust?</li>

<li>One executable to rule them all! You could compile your program once and have it run on all platforms supporting .NET. Windows, macOS, Linux? x86, ARM? 64 or 32 bit? All supported by one executable.</li>

<li>There already exists a version of C++ targeting .NET, so doing the same with Rust should be definitely possible! Besides, we don't want to be worse than the C++ people, do we ;)?</li>

<li>I already have a <a href="https://github.com/FractalFir/wrapped_mono">some of experience with Rust/C# interop.</a></li>
</ol>

<p>So, now that I explained <em>why</em> I am doing this, let's get right into the <em>how</em>!</p>

<h2 id="how_to_compile_anything_for_.net">How to compile anything for .NET</h2>

<p>Compiling things for .NET may seem like a hard thing at first, but it is actually not. .NET uses the <code>Common Intermediate Language</code>, part of <code>Common Language Infrastructure</code>. It is an intermediate representation of C#/F# code. If you can emit fully valid CIL, it should be happily loaded by both the .NET runtime (Core CLR) and mono. There is a small, but important asterisk to this statement (<em>foreshadowing</em>), but more on this later.</p>

<p>How would one emit CIL? You could use the built-in C# APIs for code generation. That is very much what I will likely do in the future, but it has its own Rust-specific issues, and is generally just harder to do for this particular project. The great thing about CIL is that it has a human-readable form. What matters for our use-case is that it can be easily generated from the Rust side, and then turned into a compiled .NET assembly, using a tool called <code>ilasm</code>(Intermediate Language Assembler). This approach has 2 huge benefits: I can read the produced assembly and spot most of the mistakes. The C# decompiler can be used to get C# code equivalent to the assembly produced by my backend. It also helps verify that everything is going OK, because there is no way both <code>ilasm</code> and a C# decompiler would happily accept invalid IL that the .NET runtime would refuse to load, right?</p>

<h2 id="small_snippet_of_cil">Small snippet of CIL</h2>

<p>C# code</p>

<pre><code>public static int Add2(int P_0)
{
    return P_0 + 2;
}</code></pre>

<p>CIL</p>

<pre><code>.method public static hidebysig int32 Add2(int32){
    ldarg.0
    ldc.i4 2
    add
    ret
}</code></pre>

<p>As you can see, CIL is stack based, and consists of a series of opcodes, manipulating this stack. Besides containing code, CIL also contains type info, but this is something I will go more in depth in another article.</p>

<h2 id="how_to_compile_rust_for_anything">How to compile Rust for anything</h2>

<p>Rust is a very complicated language. Writing a compiler for it is hard, but we have more options for compiling Rust for any target we desire. Rust normally uses LLVM for code generation. But it does not have to: the rust compiler backend works as a plugin:</p>

<p>You can easily swap it out for another one, by simply pointing <code>rustc</code> to a relevant dynamic library using the <code>-Z codegen-backend=YOUR_CODEGEN_HERE.dll</code> flag. As long as it provides the relevant functions, <code>rustc</code> will pass you all the info needed for generating code for any crate. At this stage, a rust program is represented using the MIR(mid-level IR) format. It its relatively easy to handle, with a few quirks that can be ignored for our purposes. It seems very inspired by LLVM's IR, which makes sense, since it is usually converted to LLVM IR almost right away.</p>

<p>While MIR is not hard, getting to it is not a trivial task, since you first need to familiarize yourself with the relevant internal Rust APIs. I managed to get my backend to emit CIL for a simple identity function in about ~1.5 days, starting with little to no knowledge about how <code>rustc</code> works on the inside. Once you get the hang of it, building more complicated features does not take all that much time. It is, not, however, all rainbows and sunshine.</p>

<h2 id="we_are_not_in_kansas_anymore">We are not in Kansas anymore</h2>

<p>Rusts standard library, and a lot of the popular crates, are like a museum. While it does change, as new exhibitions are added, it is mostly finished. Each painting has a detailed explanation in 7 different languages underneath. Descriptions below each excitation are written beautifully, with detailed drawings, showing how everything works. It is so easy to navigate, one glance at the map is enough to find exactly what you are looking for. It is so convenient, you almost don't notice that you are learning something. <br></p>

<p>Internals of <code>rustc</code> are like a build site of a sprawling factory. You can see the scaffolds everywhere, as more production lines come online, and everything gets faster, better, bigger. Workers move around, knowing the place like the back of their hands. They can glance at the signs on the walls, and instantly tell you: where you are, what this place does and what pitfalls you should avoid. And you are a new hire who has just came for his first day at the new job. You look at the sign, and after some thinking, you too are able to tell roughly in which building you are. The signs almost always tell you what you need, just in short, cryptic sentences. You always can tell what is going on, with some thinking, but it is not effortless. The signs on the walls are not <em>bad</em>, just not written for anyone to get right away.</p>

<p>This is roughly the feeling you might get when reading the documentation of <code>rustc</code> internals. I wan't to once again reiterate: it is, by any means, bad. It is simply hard. And that is to be expected, since it is still being worked on.</p>

<p>So, if you want to start working anything related to compiler internals, manage your expectations. Don't just blast in, expecting to get everything right away. Equip yourself with some patience, and a big cup of your preferred beverage.</p>

<h2 id="it_is_not_bad,_and_is_getting_even_better!">It is not bad, and is getting even better!</h2>

<p>I am going to end this on a positive note: if you are reading this in a couple years time, there is high likelihood that this section is not relevant in any way. If you take a look at the documentation, it is clear that not only is it not in a "finished", state, there is a slow, but steady work made on improving it. Some sections have a little <code>Clarification needed</code> underneath, with an issue linked below. So, while it is not perfect, I am hopeful for the future.<br></p>

<p>I would like to also thank the people in Rusts zulip for all the help. I am a pretty shy person, who always overthinks everything, so I was pretty reluctant to ask any questions. Thankfully, it turns I once again stressed over nothing. The people there were very helpful, and answered my questions shockingly quick. They even gave me advice about things I had not yet asked! I am certain I would not get nearly as far into this project, without this help.<br></p>

<p>So, lets now get over this little tangent, and go back on track.</p>

<h2 id="steady_progress">Steady progress</h2>

<p>After some initial troubles, I had managed to push on and got the project to a state in which some simple demo libraries could be compiled. A lot of stuff was relatively easy to handle, so over a couple of weeks I had added support for all kinds of stuff. I was regularly checking the disassembled C# code, created from CIL I emitted, to ensure everything looked OK. After about 2 weeks, I had support for all the binary operations (add, bit-shift, e.t.c), some unary ops (e.g. bitwise not) and operations without arguments (e.g. sizeof). The codegen was also able to handle a lot of building blocks related to control flow, like <code>if/else</code> statements, simple match statements, and while loops. For loops are kind of special, since they require support for iterators and generics. Additionally, they are likely to require heavy optimization to work at comparable speed. I had also added support for calls, and a lot of types, such as references, structs, tuples, arrays and slices.</p>

<h2 id="arrays_are_harder_than_they_look">Arrays are harder than they look</h2>

<p>It has latter turned out, that the current implementation of arrays is highly flawed, and JIT sometimes seems to just decide to optimize reads/ writes to and from arrays to NOPs. Why exactly? I can't know for certain, but I have an idea that could potentially fix this issue. The <code>.volatile</code> prefix to a CIL instruction disables certain optimizations, so it could help. I won't implement it right now, since this is not the only issue with arrays, which need to be redesigned anyway.</p>

<p>What is the other issue? I based my implementation upon the way C# handles fixed-size arrays. They essentially work by creating a hidden, nested struct type with a <code>.size</code> in definition specifying its size in bytes. Some keen-eyed people may have already seen the problem:</p>

<p>Since the size of a fixed-size array is declared in bytes, there is no way to have support for both 32 bit and 64 bit machines at the same time. Some types, such as pointers, have their size depend on how big the address space is. So an array of 10 pointers is 40 bytes on a 32 bit machine and 80 bytes on a 64 bit one. So, there are 3 options: have separate executables for 32-bit and 64-bit architectures, crash on 64-bit ones, or use far more memory than needed on already memory-limited 32-bit systems. There is an alternative solution, but it is kinda hacky and needs some more consideration. Its biggest drawback is that it would create many unnecessary types.</p>

<p>Even with those kinds of issues, is still pressed on, at a pretty steady pace, successfully compiling more, and more complicated snippets of rust code.</p>

<h2 id="running_the_code_for_the_first_time">Running the code for the first time</h2>

<p>Fairly confident in the project, I had decided to create a small <code>Hello World</code> example. Since using C# APIs from rust is still far off, I had hard-coded some functions from the C standard library. This is something I will need to do anyway, since Rusts stdlib depends on <code>libc</code>. This is the easiest way to bring Rust's stdlib to .NET, since it does not require any rewrites. But I digress. Using the <code>putc</code> function, I can print a simple message to the console. I run my backend, creating a CIL file containing the <code>hello world</code> program. With anticipation, I type <code>ilasm hello</code>. I start to smile as the words <code>Operation completed successfully</code> appear within the terminal. I feel a rush of adrenaline and endorphins. Sure, I had used my backend to compile more advanced libraries before, but all I knew is that they were valid CIL, and decompiled C# suggested they would work. This small <code>hello world</code> program would be the first snippet of Rust code to run within a .NET runtime. I type <code>mono hello.exe</code>, expecting the words <code>Hello CLR from Rust!</code> to appear on my screen. Instead, I am greeted with this little message:</p>

<pre><code>Unhandled Exception:
System.InvalidProgramException: Invalid IL code in &lt;Module&gt;:main (intptr,byte**): IL_0000: ldc.i4.s  72</code></pre>

<p>Oh... that is not a good sign.</p>

<h2 id="ilasm_is_a_filthy_liar">ILASM is a filthy liar</h2>

<p>You would assume that if some CIL code is blatantly wrong, <code>ilasm</code> would be unable to assemble it. This is sadly the case only with some mistakes. For some, it will not give you any warnings. You know what is worse? There is a subset of malformed CIL that the particular decompiler I was using(I can't say for all of them, I used only one) would turn into <strong>FULLY VALID C#</strong>, hiding the issue.  You know what is even worse? For some issues, both the runtime I was using (mono) and CoreCLR gave me not all that much info about what was wrong. CoreCLR's message was too generic, and while mono at least told me which method caused the issue, it was wrong about what was the problem exactly.</p>

<p>The part of the message about invalid IL code, instruction position and the instruction itself could lead you to believe that the instruction in question <code>ldc.i4.s</code> was the issue. So I tried removing it. Issue persisted. So I removed more. Nothing. Even more. More. MORE. Until all that was left was a single <code>ret</code> opcode. What? How is that possible? There is almost nowhere the issue can be? The only part left, besides the function signature and name, is...</p>

<h2 id=".locals">.locals</h2>

<p>Any function in CIL has to declare all of its local variables. A valid declaration of locals looks something like this:</p>

<pre><code>.local(
   [0] int32,
   [1] float32,
   [2] int8,
   [3] int16*,
   [4] void*
)</code></pre>

<p>And one with the particular issue I was facing looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>.local(
   [0] int32,
   [1] float32,
   [2] int8,
   [3] int16*,
   [4] void
)</code></pre>

<p>You can't have a <code>void</code> type in locals. But why would you even have a void local in the first place? Rust likes to have locals with type void. And a LOT of them at that. Huh?</p>

<p>The reason <code>void</code> locals are so prevalent in <code>MIR</code> is mostly related to function calls (other sources of void locals exist too). The way MIR is designed, each function is assumed to return something. And this is a great assumption, that simplifies a lot of stuff. Both functions returning void and ones returning something are treated exactly the same. Code can just handle <code>functions</code>, not <code>void functions</code> and <code>every other function</code>. Additionally,  this is very similar to how LLVM deals with void functions, so converting MIR to LLVM is easier too.</p>

<p>Why didn't I remove those void locals right away, and instead choose to emit CIL with them? Would they not be useless at best, make the compiled assembly larger, and could potentially confuse the JIT? Well, at this stage of the project, I don't actually want to emit optimal code. I want to emit code that is as similar to the original MIR as possible. That just makes debugging easier.</p>

<p>Wasn't the problem obvious right away? I mean, both C#/F# don't allow void locals, so why on earth would they be supported? In hindsight, it seems foolish to assume they would work. I thought that if both the ilasm and a decompiler had no problem with void locals, this would work out just fine. I had quickly written a piece of code to remove any instructions interacting with void locals, and then changed their type. I did not want to outright remove them, at least not for now, since that would make CILs locals not map 1 to 1 to MIR locals. This would make analyzing generated CIL harder, and I still need to do that very often. After this quick and dirty fix, I had reassembled the code, and run it. I sigh with relief, as I see the words:</p>

<p><code>Hello CLR from Rust</code></p>

<p>And this is where this story ends, at least for now.</p>

<h2 id="what_now?">What now?</h2>

<p>Now that I know that compiling Rust for the .NET runtime is very much possible, I will need to clean the project up. It is very, <strong>very</strong> buggy and unstable. There are features that sometimes work, and sometimes do not. If I want to go any further, I need to rewrite some parts of the codegen. Currently, a lot of stuff is written with the assumption that ilasm will be used to assemble the final executable, which makes changing the CIL generator for a better one very hard. I also do things that are OK right now, but become a nightmare, the second I add support for generics. The way I assemble the final executable is also not all that great, since it is not really the way a <code>rustc</code> backend is supposed to create excutables. Overall, what happens now will be just a bit of boring, but necessary work.</p>

<p>Sadly I probably won't be able to work at anything similar to pace I worked on during those 2 weeks. As September comes closer by, so does the start of the school year, and the exams at the end of my high school. It will probably be wise to dial programming down, at least a little bit.</p>

<p>Still, if you want to, you can <a href="https://github.com/FractalFir/rustc_codegen_clr">check out the project in its current state.</a> Just beware of the issues, and that this is a proof-of-concept strung together with gum and tape.</p>

<p>I hope you enjoyed this little article!</p>

        <p>Many years ago, my favorite podcast was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Totally_Rad_Show?ref=birchtree.me">The Totally Rad Show</a>. It was a fun video podcast where the hosts reviewed movies, games, TV shows, and other general nerd stuff. The hosts were Jeff Cannata (who last year <a href="https://birchtree.me/blog/jeff-cannata-is-the-podcasting-g-o-a-t/">I called the podcasting GOAT</a>), Dan Trachtenberg (who went on to direct 10 Cloverfield Lane and last year's Prey), and Alex Albrecht (who seems to have a nice life going, but is less in the public eye today).</p><p>Anyway, I linked to the show's Wikipedia page because the original episodes are no longer available to download from the official source (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110309024639/http://revision3.com/trs/">here's an archived version</a>). Happily, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@TRSarchive?ref=birchtree.me">a kind soul</a> has recently uploaded many episodes to YouTube, but that's just lucky, and those aren't guaranteed to be eternal either.</p><p>Back in the day, you could stream shows like this, but more often than not you would download them and watch them locally. That's what I did, so I had every episode on my computer at one point, but I deleted each one when I was done with it. In retrospect, I wish I'd saved most of these episodes to an external drive.</p><p>This applies to other things as well. There are little internet videos from the pre-YouTube days that I think about and would love to see again, but can't. There are versions of songs that you can't get on streaming services. There are just some things I remember from years ago that I can't see again, and that's a shame.</p><p>Things on the internet <em>can</em> be forever, but you can't assume someone else will keep them going, especially when it's stuff like video, which costs real money to host. If you love something, try to get a local copy and store it on a hard drive you control.</p><p>For video content around the web, I highly recommend trying out <a href="https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp?ref=birchtree.me">yt-dlp</a>, which is an astoundingly great command line tool for downloading video from most big sites.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  

  <p><strong>Monday, August 28, 2023</strong></p>

  <p>I've been using GitHub Copilot on personal projects since March.
It's been an interesting experience, and one that I realized I have to change.
Using Copilot nearly full time has had some positive and  negative impacts on me, and it's time to take control of how I interact with it.</p>
<h2 id="the-honeymoon-phase">The honeymoon phase</h2>
<p>I've liked a lot about working with Copilot.
For this duration I've had Copilot enabled full-time in code files<sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup>.
I pretty quickly found that I was able to be productive in ways that I was struggling with before due to life circumstances.
With two kids, a full-time job, a time-consuming running habit, and ongoing medical treatment, by the time I sit down to write code for myself, I'm just <em>tired</em>.</p>
<p>But with Copilot enabled, it was a lot easier to actually write code in the evenings even when I was tired.
I could put in simple comments as prompts and get back out something that mostly-sorta worked, then shape it into what I needed.</p>
<p>This led me to get some work done on small projects and a few assorted scripts.
I made progress on an issue tracker I am working on with a friend.
I wrote the parser and formatter for my <a href="https://ntietz.com/blog/introducing-hurl/">programming language</a>.
This was pretty good work, and I was able to get it done even when tired!
It seemed like everything was going well.</p>
<h2 id="cracks-form">Cracks form</h2>
<p>Outside of work, all my coding was done with Copilot enabled.
I also had vim configured with rust-analyzer to show errors automatically and give me suggestions.</p>
<p>This worked pretty well, and it felt immediately productive.
The common wisdom is that you should use the best power tools you can in your editor to be as productive as possible, and I wanted to be productive.
More tools, we're told, will help us be better.</p>
<p>But then...</p>
<p>I stopped writing very much code for fun.
It wasn't conscious, but when I sat down at my desk, the last thing I wanted to do was work on personal projects.
Sometimes I made myself and it was enjoyable, but then I'd fall into a funk again.
I just couldn't motivate myself for the projects I was working on.</p>
<p>There are a lot of factors at play in my life right now.
I told myself that this is because work is a lot, because kids are a lot, because transition is <em>a lot</em>.
I didn't suspect that my editor and the tools that I setup to <em>help</em> me were related.</p>
<h2 id="rediscovering-joy">Rediscovering joy</h2>
<p>But last week, a friend at <a href="https://www.recurse.com/">RC</a> noted that she doesn't use syntax highlighting and doesn't use other noisy editor plugins.
I've been curious about stopping using syntax highlighting, and her reasoning really spoke to me, so I tried it.</p>
<p>I went and found a grayscale color scheme (since I do like a <em>small</em> amount of visual distinction for comments) and installed it.
Immediately, I felt some relief.
I disabled my LSP plugin in vim, disabled rust-analyzer.
More relief.</p>
<p>When I went to work on a project, suddenly it was... fun again?
The editor was sitting there, waiting for me to enter code.
No code would appear unless I typed it.
The only thoughts entered would be mine.</p>
<p>This is the way that I fell in love with programming: the editor a channel for my thoughts, the compiler transforming them into something I could run, and little else in the way.</p>
<p>It has taken me much of adulthood to come to understand how my brain works.
It baffles me that people can take in a lot of visual and auditory noise and still be productive; how anyone can achieve <em>anything</em> in an open office is beyond me.
This noise extends into the digital: Slack pings, email notifications.
And by using plugins that push information into my editor, I extended it into vim.</p>
<p>This works for a great many other devs, and I'm glad that we have these tools.
But I don't understand it.
It's not a relatable experience.</p>
<p>It's like with word processors and spellcheck.
When we used them in school for homework, most of my classmates left spellchecking on, and caught errors as they went or ignored them until they were done, with seeming ease.
I had to disable it.
Each red squiggle under a misspelled word would vaporize my thinly held train of thought, which I then had to claw back.
Some of the time I would remember to run it after my assignment was done; other times, I just got points off.</p>
<p>It's like that with LSPs that give error checking, and it's like that with Copilot.
When my tooling pushes information into my editor, it vaporizes my concentration.
This is harder to see with Copilot, since the value it gives is in part being able to do more with less focus.
But the end result is that it sucked the joy out of things, because with these tools I could not reach the flow state I am so deeply in love with.
If I got close, an error or suggestion would rip me back out.</p>
<h2 id="looking-for-equilibrium">Looking for equilibrium</h2>
<p>Last week, after that conversation with my friend, I had disabled everything.
No more LSP, no more Copilot, no more colors.
That was great at first, and it was a reactionary response.</p>
<p>But I think I can strike a better balance.
These tools <em>do</em> provide value, and my problem isn't with the tools but with my relationship with them.
I was letting them control me and control my interactions with them.</p>
<p>From now on, I'm in charge.
I'll control those interactions, and the tools will do what I ask them, only <em>when</em> I ask them to do it.</p>
<p>I've dipped my toes back into the tool waters.
I re-installed my Copilot plugin, but left it disabled.
There's a hotkey to invoke it when, and only when, I want to reach for a suggestion.</p>
<p>Sometime I'll add my LSP integrations back in for some more power, without the visual noise.
I like some aspects of them, but I can't deal with others.
Finding equilibrium is hard, and I think it's worth pursuing.</p>
<p>But only if the joy remains<sup><a href="#2">2</a></sup>.</p>

<h2 id="web-llm">Web LLM</h2>

<p><strong>Llama 2 7B/13B are now available in Web LLM!!</strong> Try it out in our <a href="#chat-demo">chat demo</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Llama 2 70B is also supported.</strong> If you have a Apple Silicon Mac with 64GB or more memory, you can follow the <a href="#instructions">instructions</a> below to download and launch Chrome Canary and try out the 70B model in Web LLM.</p>

<p>This project brings large-language model and LLM-based chatbot to web browsers. <strong>Everything runs inside the browser with no server support and accelerated with WebGPU.</strong> This opens up a lot of fun opportunities to build AI assistants for everyone and enable privacy while enjoying GPU acceleration. Please check out our <a href="https://github.com/mlc-ai/web-llm">GitHub repo</a> to see how we did it.</p>

<p><img src="https://webllm.mlc.ai/img/fig/pitts.png" width="100%"></p>

<p>We have been seeing amazing progress in generative AI and LLM recently. Thanks to the open-source efforts like LLaMA, Alpaca, Vicuna and Dolly, we start to see an exciting future of building our own open source language models and personal AI assistant.</p>

<p>These models are usually big and compute-heavy. To build a chat service, we will need a large cluster to run an inference server, while clients send requests to servers and retrieve the inference output. We also usually have to run on a specific type of GPUs where popular deep-learning frameworks are readily available.</p>

<p>This project is our step to bring more diversity to the ecosystem. Specifically, can we simply bake LLMs directly into the client side and directly run them inside a browser? If that can be realized, we could offer support for client personal AI models with the benefit of cost reduction, enhancement for personalization and privacy protection. The client side is getting pretty powerful.</p>

<p>Won’t it be even more amazing if we can simply open up a browser and directly bring AI natively to your browser tab? There is some level of readiness in the ecosystem. This project provides an affirmative answer to the question.</p>

<h2 id="instructions">Instructions</h2>

<p>WebGPU just shipped to Chrome. You can try out the latest Chrome 113. Chrome version ≤ 112 is not supported, and if you are using it,
the demo will raise an error like <code>Find an error initializing the WebGPU device OperationError: Required limit (1073741824) is greater than the supported limit (268435456). - While validating maxBufferSize - While validating required limits.</code></p>

<p>Select the model you want to try out. Enter your inputs, click “Send” – we are ready to go!
The chat bot will first fetch model parameters into local cache. The download may take a few minutes, only for the first run.
The subsequent refreshes and runs will be faster. We have tested it on Windows and Mac, you will need a GPU with about 6GB memory to run Llama-7B, Vicuna-7B, and about 3GB memory to run RedPajama-3B.</p>

The near-extinction of Indian vultures in the mid-1990s proved fatal for humans too, causing the mortality rate to rise by 4% in districts once populated by the birds.</p><figure data-infographic-class="g-fallback"></figure><figure data-infographic-js="1"></figure><p>Vultures act as nature’s sanitation service. In India, their diet consisted largely of rotting livestock carcasses—numbering 30m a year in the cattle-revering country. A group of vultures can polish off a cow’s carrion in 40 minutes. Their strongly acidic digestive tracts destroy most germs.</p><p>Historically, vultures were widespread in India. But between the 1990s and early 2000s their numbers plummeted by more than 90%, from around 40m. The cause was diclofenac, an anti-inflammatory drug that farmers began using to treat their cattle. Though the drug was harmless to both cows and humans, birds that consumed animals treated with diclofenac suffered from kidney failure and died within weeks.</p><p>Without vultures, carcasses attracted feral dogs and rats. Not only do these animals carry rabies and other diseases that threaten humans, they are far less efficient at finishing off carrion. The rotting remains they left behind were full of pathogens that then spread to drinking water.</p><p>The abrupt demise of the vultures made it possible to quantify their impact on public health. A new working paper, by Eyal Frank of the University of Chicago and Anant Sudarshan of Warwick University, used a statistical method called “difference-in-differences” to compare changes in the death rate in districts with habitats well suited to vultures with those in less suitable places, just as diclofenac use took off.</p><p>In districts with vulture-suitable habitats, more people began to die just as diclofenac sales increased. The effect was greatest in urban areas with large livestock populations. The authors estimated that, between 2000 and 2005, the loss of vultures caused 500,000 additional human deaths.</p><p>“Keystone species” like the vulture hold ecosystems together. Conserving these animals should be a priority. They may not be cute or cuddly, but they are important.<span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p><p><small>illustrations: olivier heiligers</small></p></div><p>This article appeared in the Graphic detail section of the print edition under the headline "Carrion call"</p><div orientation="vertical" data-test-id="vertical"><div orientation="vertical"><figure><img alt="Xi’s failing model: Why he won’t fix China’s economy" loading="lazy" width="1280" height="1684" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" sizes="300px" srcset="https://www.economist.com/img/b/16/21/90/media-assets/image/20230826_DE_EU.jpg 16w, https://www.economist.com/img/b/32/42/90/media-assets/image/20230826_DE_EU.jpg 32w, https://www.economist.com/img/b/48/63/90/media-assets/image/20230826_DE_EU.jpg 48w, https://www.economist.com/img/b/64/84/90/media-assets/image/20230826_DE_EU.jpg 64w, https://www.economist.com/img/b/96/126/90/media-assets/image/20230826_DE_EU.jpg 96w, https://www.economist.com/img/b/128/168/90/media-assets/image/20230826_DE_EU.jpg 128w, https://www.economist.com/img/b/256/336/90/media-assets/image/20230826_DE_EU.jpg 256w, https://www.economist.com/img/b/360/473/90/media-assets/image/20230826_DE_EU.jpg 360w, https://www.economist.com/img/b/384/505/90/media-assets/image/20230826_DE_EU.jpg 384w, https://www.economist.com/img/b/480/631/90/media-assets/image/20230826_DE_EU.jpg 480w, https://www.economist.com/img/b/600/789/90/media-assets/image/20230826_DE_EU.jpg 600w, https://www.economist.com/img/b/834/1097/90/media-assets/image/20230826_DE_EU.jpg 834w, https://www.economist.com/img/b/960/1263/90/media-assets/image/20230826_DE_EU.jpg 960w, https://www.economist.com/img/b/1096/1441/90/media-assets/image/20230826_DE_EU.jpg 1096w, https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/1684/90/media-assets/image/20230826_DE_EU.jpg 1280w, https://www.economist.com/img/b/1424/1873/90/media-assets/image/20230826_DE_EU.jpg 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1424/1873/90/media-assets/image/20230826_DE_EU.jpg"></figure></div><div orientation="vertical"><h3 orientation="vertical">From the August 26th 2023 edition</h3><p orientation="vertical">Discover stories from this section and more in the list of contents </p><a href="https://www.economist.com/printedition/2023-08-26" data-analytics="sidebar:weekly_edition"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><g fill="none" fill-rule="evenodd"><path d="M12 1c6.075 0 11 4.925 11 11s-4.925 11-11 11S1 18.075 1 12 5.925 1 12 1zm.142 4.5l-1.008 1.062c3.33 3.276 4.194 4.14 4.608 4.5-1.602-.018-3.168-.018-10.242-.018v1.584c7.074 0 8.73 0 10.242-.018-.432.36-1.314 1.206-4.608 4.536l1.008 1.044 6.354-6.354L12.142 5.5z" fill="#2E45B8" fill-rule="nonzero"></path></g></svg><span>Explore the edition</span></a></div></div></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-id="page-content" data-og-area="article-blocks" id="incArticle"><p>Close aerial combat is a game of fractions of a second, quick decision-making, and squeezing every ounce of performance out of fighter aircraft. Perceive. Analyze. Decide. React. Variations of this chain of events are taught at all stages of a fighter pilot’s career.</p><p>Some air forces have painted ‘false canopies’ on the bottoms of their combat aircraft in an attempt to confuse adversaries. Debate rages about the effectiveness of such attempts to mislead. I can tell you unequivocally that it <em>does</em> sometimes work – and that I almost died one day as a result.</p><p>On a day like any other, I sat in a briefing for a 2v1 (two versus one) Basic Fighter Maneuvers (BFM) training flight. I was feeling pretty good – my CF-18 Hornet basic course was going well, and I had moved beyond the basics of flying the jet to learning how to fight with it. This was a solo, where I would fly as the wingman to my instructor, Mike Hoch. Another instructor was to fly as our adversary (the bandit).&nbsp;</p><figure data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="1" data-og-block-type="core/image"><span data-rawhtml="1">A pair of Canadian Hornets takeoff on a training mission. Credit: RAF-YYC/wikicommons </span></figure><p>The lesson to be learned involved having one fighter engage the bad guy in close combat, while the other fighter maneuvered to get free of the fight, then turn back in and attack the bad guy from a bit further away. In close aerial combat, it was often difficult to get a shot in at the other aircraft. Both aircraft are turning very hard and doing everything to deny the adversary a valid shot, whether it was with a missile or with the gun. The fighter that was ‘free’ was usually the one who got a valid shot away first.</p><p>Since this was a ‘canned’ training scenario, the bandit sat in on the whole briefing, to make sure that we would get the most training out of every set-up. Throughout the Hornet basic course, every pound of jet fuel was spoken for, and there was little margin for making mistakes and wasting fuel. I’d been thoroughly indoctrinated in the ‘fuel is life’ school of thought, in much the same way as we saw speed as life.</p><p>There were to be some offensive set-ups, where we attacked the bandit from a position of advantage, then some defensive where he would attack from behind, and finally some neutral set-ups where we’d merge head-on. To ensure I saw both aspects, the bandit was told each time which fighter I was in. Some set-ups I was ‘engaged,’ while some I was ‘free.’</p><p>Sounds simple?&nbsp;</p><p>Well, it’s not.&nbsp;</p><p>Each fight was very dynamic, happening in three dimensions. One big change from fighting the CF-5 Freedom Fighter was that dogfighting usually involved vertical turning fights. These were egg-shaped, larger at the bottom and tighter at the top (due to gravity), and sometimes canted at an angle from the vertical toward the horizon. The main tactic was to draw the bandit into a ‘single-circle’ fight, meaning that one aircraft was chasing the other around the circle. Ideally, the friendly aircraft would be chasing the bandit, keeping him predictable but not in immediate danger of being shot by the bandit.</p><figure data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="2" data-og-block-type="core/image"><span data-rawhtml="1">A CF-18 breaks away from its leader. Credit: RCAF </span></figure><p>Each was doing their damnedest to shoot or avoid getting shot. The instructors thoroughly enjoyed these flights, because they could exercise their own best Basic Fighter Maneuvers (BFM), while still providing training to me, the student. One of the biggest lessons we were supposed to glean from this was the longer you got wrapped up in a turning fight, the more chance somebody from outside the fight would take a shot and kill you.</p><p>On what turned out to be the last engagement on that flight, I was getting confident. Things had gone really well so far, both as free and engaged. As was standard before each engagement, we made quick ready calls.</p><p>“Tango Two, ready with 5,000.” Fuel quantity checks and confirmations were always made in training before each engagement. In afterburner (AB), a Hornet can burn about 1,000 pounds of fuel each <em>minute</em>. From where we were flying, about 50 miles north of Cold Lake, Alberta, we needed to stop fighting when we had 3,500 lbs remaining, so we could make it back to base with the minimum of 2,000 lbs remaining. I made a mental note that I had at most one and a half minutes of fuel in AB before I had to stop (knock it off). In training, unlike real combat, when we reached certain fuel remaining, we stopped fighting and went home, no questions asked.</p><p>My instructor and I flew a side-by-side formation, separated by about 2 miles. We met the bandit head-on, and he immediately got engaged with my lead. My job was to fly away from the fight, out of their ‘plane of motion’ (the circle they were turning in), then come back, figure out who was who, and shoot the bad guy. Things were complicated by the fact that we were all flying the same type of aircraft, and there was no way to tell which was which visually.</p><figure data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="3" data-og-block-type="core/image"><span data-rawhtml="1">CF-18s and their false canopies in view. Credit: RCAF </span></figure><p>I pulled up and away from their turning fight, selecting AB, and climbed as I accelerated. Glancing over my shoulder, I could see a tight turning fight developing. My instructor gave me short, concise radio calls, effectively a play-by-play of the fight, so that when I came back to shoot I’d quickly identify and shoot the bandit.</p><p>“I’m defensive. Nose high. Bandit is low man.” All calls that told me which he’d be when I turned back and had a clear view of the fight. They looked about the right distance behind me (about three miles). Time to go shoot the bandit and save my lead’s butt. I quickly did a ‘split s’ (flipped onto my back and pulled the nose down to loop back toward them).&nbsp;</p><p>I craned my neck, looking way back in my bubble canopy, to spot the other two Hornets. By now I was so used to pulling six or seven Gs that I barely felt any discomfort. I was completely focused on what I needed to do, and not thinking about minor things like physical pain as I was crushed into my ejection seat in the turn. The other fighters were just visible, albeit as two tiny specks high up in my canopy and behind. I made a small adjustment in the angle of my wings to put my ‘lift vector’ (an imaginary arrow coming up out of my canopy) on them. As the distance closed slightly between us, I could just pick up what I thought was a false canopy on the belly of one Hornet.</p><figure data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="4" data-og-block-type="core/image"><span data-rawhtml="1">An appreciation of what air combat really looks like. I took this photo a few years after the events in this story. My wingman in the blue circle is another CF-18 flying over Germany, three miles away. The red circle is around a Luftwaffe F-4 Phantom, pulling up to attack. He is also about two miles away. The wing shape and smoke trail make identifying the F-4 easy. With my eyes (better perception than the camera), I could see his belly (no canopy), indicating he was turning away from me. </span></figure><p>Okay. They’re turning away from me, and I’m coming around behind them. Sweet. From the latest radio calls, I knew that my lead was the one in front, so I continued pulling hard to point at the bandit. With my left thumb, I toggled the radar into boresight acquisition mode, meaning that it would lock on whatever I pointed at, then selected AIM-9M missile mode with the weapons select switch on the stick. All of these actions were done by reflex without looking inside – the Hands-On Throttle and Stick (HOTAS) being very well designed for air fighting while keeping my eyes out of the cockpit.</p><p>Satisfied that the geometry would work, I thought about my fuel quantity. I’d been burning jet fuel at a huge rate for a while now, and I wanted to make sure I was okay. The fuel gauge was down by my left knee on the instrument panel, so I flicked my eyes briefly down into the cockpit while keeping my head canted back. Moving my head under that G load would have seriously hurt my neck muscles.</p><figure data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="5" data-og-block-type="core/image"><span data-rawhtml="1">A CF-18 in full afterburner.

Satisfied with my fuel quantity, I let my eyes flit back up, expecting to see the tails of the two aircraft turning away. I was momentarily confused as I saw in my Head-Up Display (HUD) that my radar had indeed locked onto the bandit, but instead of showing an expected valid shot, it displayed a ‘break X’ – meaning he was too close to shoot.&nbsp;</p><p>While my mind struggled to process the HUD’s symbology, I was shocked to see my lead flash by me, opposite direction, very, <em>very</em> close. Instinctively, I slacked off my turn and snapped my head to the left to watch him go by. My ‘spidey senses’ tingled, too late.&nbsp;</p><p>Like a spectator at a tennis match, my head snapped back to the right, just in time to see the trailing aircraft (the bandit) go by, even closer than my lead had. My aircraft rocked violently in the wake turbulence behind his hard-turning jet as he passed me.</p><p>“Knock it off, knock it off” came a terse radio transmission from my lead. I responded “Two, knock it off” and the other aircraft said “Bandit, knock it off.” A brief pause, and my lead said “Let’s call it a day. Two, rejoin echelon left, Bandit, you’re cleared off for RTB (return to base).” Shakily, I turned back toward my lead and rejoined on him..&nbsp;</p><p>We flew back to base in silence.&nbsp;</p><figure data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="6" data-og-block-type="core/image"><span data-rawhtml="1">A pair of RCAF CF-18s refueling, their false canopies clearly visible.

Vicky Lefrancois, Royal Canadian Air Force </span></figure><p>Normally I would have enjoyed the simple pleasure of flying close formation on the brand-new grey jet, revelling in the responsiveness of my powerful F-404 engines, and enjoying the spectacular view of the snow-covered Alberta wilderness. Today, though, I was immersed in my thoughts, and went through the motions of landing and unstrapping. The groundcrew who took over my jet must have found me to be uncharacteristically moody.</p><p>I looked at my instructor when I joined him at the servicing desk. Clearly, he was not ready to talk, especially in a crowded room with maintenance personnel everywhere. Nothing was said as we signed in our aircraft and we walked over to the Air Combat Manoeuvring Range/Instrumentation (ACMR/I) building together, in silence. Our aircraft had internal telemetry pods installed inside the gun door (forward left fuselage), which passed precise location and flight data down to ground receivers and recording systems back at base. By the time we got to the ACMR/I debrief room, the contractor who ran the system had it all set up to play back. There were large screens on which our aircraft were represented as simple 3D drawings.The flight data included distances between aircraft were constantly displayed and updated.</p><figure data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="7" data-og-block-type="core/image"><span data-rawhtml="1">An ACMR/I graphic from the era I was on the Hornet course. Orange outlines show an aircraft’s canopy bow and instrument panel outline, blue is the horizon, and white is the adversary aircraft. Credit: The U.S. National Archives </span></figure><p>It was possible to view the recorded engagements from any angle – top/down, side, oblique, and even to see the view from inside any of the cockpits, all presented in wire frame fashion. I had seen this system being used with F-15s training at Luke AFB in Phoenix Arizona in 1981, courtesy of Major Dave Bashow, a CF-104 Starfighter pilot on exchange with the USAF. Seeing a debrief on ACMR/I was still quite impressive in 1986. Today, however, the cool factor was lost on me. I was still trying to process having nearly collided and died less than an hour ago.</p><p>In the Cold Lake debriefing room, the two instructors looked at each other, as if a silent question were being asked. The bandit nodded and Mike Hoch said “Let’s start with playback of the last engagement.” Shortly, we saw the single-circle fight develop, with my aircraft ‘spitting out’ to the west, then turning back toward them. That’s when I finally understood what had happened. When I turned back in toward them, they were not turning away from me – they were turning <em>toward</em> me.&nbsp;</p><p>Mike said “Run it back about 20 seconds. Switch to cockpit view from number Two (my aircraft).” The operator complied and soon we were seeing the view out of my cockpit, as I pulled back hard toward them. From my cockpit, the wire frame aircraft (about three miles away) could be seen turning, but the direction of turn was not evident since they were far away, and tiny.</p><figure data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="8" data-og-block-type="core/image"><span data-rawhtml="1">A view of the CF-18's false canopy. From this distance, it is easily distinguished from the real one. From two miles away, it is impossible to tell. </span></figure><p>I remembered how I had looked way back above my head to spot them, then glanced inside to check the fuel quantity. As my cockpit view was played back in real time, I saw how quickly the two other aircraft approached, and could see exactly how my glance inside came at a crucial time when I failed to recognize they were approaching, and not turning away.</p><p>How did I get fooled? I had seen the real canopies, but thought they were the false ones. As I turned toward them, I had failed to notice that their turn was taking them closer to me than I ever imagined.</p><p>“Freeze!” said Mike. “Let’s see how close we came.” After playing back in slow motion, and seeing both near-collisions, we figured out that I had missed my lead by 400 feet, head-on, and came within 150 feet of the bandit who was trailing. Our closing speed was about 900 kts, or roughly 1,700 kph. Imagine trying to fly within 150 feet of another aircraft, head-on, while travelling at such speeds!</p><p>Clearly, the false canopy fooled me. In other engagements over several years similar false canopy illusions were evident, but I was now more aware of how tricky they could be. Yes, in some cases opponents gained a slight advantage due to my hesitation, but at least I didn’t come close to a mid-air collision again. Flying against other allied fighters, we sometimes heard them express how our false canopies had fooled them. For sure, a false canopy cannot help against a missile or gunfire, but it was another tool in our arsenal when we needed it the most – close combat.</p><figure data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="9" data-og-block-type="core/image"><span data-rawhtml="1">False canopy on a Italian Navy AV-8B+ Harrier.

All three of us realized that we’d been extremely lucky that day. I also learned that even in training, death can kick down your door without warning.</p><p>It is often said that when a fighter pilot walks out to his aircraft, he may never know that today will be his last flight. I learned first hand how real that was with the help of the most basic of optical countermeasures.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><em>Retired Major Dan McWilliams logged 3,200 hours over 20 years in the Canadian Air Force, flying the CT-114 Tutor, CF-5, T-33, and CF-18.

<p>The conventional venture capital funding path – from raising an institutional Seed, Series A, B, C, D, E, etc, all the way to exit via IPO – has long been treated as gospel. Its verses are most heavily preached by VC board members, whose business model it also supports.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But there is an influential tide of founders on the rise that is opting out of this path and quietly plotting a new one that leads to building generational companies.</p>



<p>It’s a hybrid path, combining the growth of targeted venture funding with the durability found in bootstrapping (i.e. profitability). It’s a path with less venture capital and more self-reliance.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And it’s the direct result of founders emerging from a tumultuous period of feast (with 5x more venture capital offered to startups over the past decade) and a brief flirtation with famine from the recent pullback that has left some venture-dependent companies in starvation mode.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For many founders, a steady reliance on venture capital, as it is heavily prescribed today, is often seen as unhealthy, if not risky.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Increasingly, these founders are seeking freedom from the risk and control of the perpetual pursuit of venture capital. Instead, they’re ready to reroute their time, efforts, and attention to building enduring companies on their own terms.&nbsp;</p>



<p>These founders are choosing to raise less and build more.</p>











<p>“<strong>Foie gras” venture capital&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>The clearest trend in the venture industry over the past decade is VCs offering startups more money.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To gain visibility into this trend, we can examine the ratio of VC capital raised to new startups in any given year. An imperfect but close proxy for viable new startups is the annual number of Seed deals (inclusive of Angel, Pre-Seed, and Seed deals). When you take total VC dollars raised, divided by the number of new companies, you’ll see the average startup today has 5x more VC capital available than its counterpart did in 2013:</p>

<p>The primary driver of this trend is VCs increasing their fund sizes, particularly larger firms. Nearly every single major fund has implemented this change. No other strategy has been so universally adopted.</p>



<p>As a result, every single type of round, from Seed to Series C on, has also increased in size. Here are some averages over time:</p>

<p>While 2023 will likely prove to be a down year for total VC capital raised, both the average and median fund size will remain up. The average fund size went from $336M in 2020 to $386M in 2022 to $538M in 2023 (PitchBook). The trend has become the new baseline.</p>











<p><strong>More isn’t always better&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>Why is this trend so pervasive?&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>Do today’s startups need more money?&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>Well, no.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The main driver of a startup’s burn is salaries. Salaries over time have increased, but not by 5x (the rate VC capital has increased). Even the new increased infastructue costs with AI will ultimately come down as companies scale and the industry matures. None of this justifies the rate and breadth of this capital increase from VCs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Contrary to popular myth, statistically venture backed startups aren’t staying “private longer,” either. Between 2011 and 2021, the median time from venture funding to IPO exit in the US has fluctuated between 5 and 7 years, with no visible increase in time (Statistica 2023).&nbsp; Granted, SPACs may have impacted these numbers, but it’s nonetheless interesting that the data does not align to the myth.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>Do bigger funds perform better?</em></p>



<p>Again, no.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Smaller funds consistently outperform large funds (on a multiple basis). More on this, below.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>Does giving a startup more capital make it reliably perform better?&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>Another no. There is no conclusive data to support this. There is no empirical study that I know of that suggests that raising more capital increases a startup’s odds of success.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Looking at case studies, for every Stripe ($8.7B raised), there are countless startups who raised too much and did not make it. To avoid speaking ill of the dead or the fatally wounded, I’ll withhold names (the headlines will tell this story).</p>



<p>The lack of conclusive evidence seems to have had little impact on the VC bias that startups – as a general rule – should raise more VC capital.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Consider some of the more persuasive funding conventions prescribed by VCs:</p>



<p><em>If you can, raise more capital as opposed to less capital&nbsp;</em></p>



<ul>
<li>For founders, the case for more capital is easy to hear – hire faster, be offensive, save for a rainy day. But too much capital, especially too early, can depress urgency and innovation, all while contributing to unnecessarily high headcount and burn. These can be company killers. For every Figma, who raised a large but not unreasonable Seed round (for its time), there is a Seed company that raised that mega round (read $10M), which may do them more harm than good. Once you’ve raised for multiple years of runway, including hiring well and adding a buffer budget, what is any extra capital really doing? Who is that mega round really serving?&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<p><em>Raise at every round, or when you have explosive growth&nbsp;</em></p>



<ul>
<li>For many founders, taking on regular capital can be extremely valuable, as can taking on capital for hyper growth. But for startups that are already profitable and growing, raising can be a costly distraction. It can swallow founder time during company-making moments, resulting in potential loss of discipline, premature hiring, and unnecessary spending. It also can alert competition, hinder hiring (via ‘less attractive’ stock options), impact dilution, and potentially even affect board composition. Companies like Vanta chose to delay Series A to focus on building instead of raising, with others raising their huge Series As at the ‘standard’ time, because they ‘should,’ before fading into history. You have to wonder – how many of those momentum Series A companies would still be around if they just chose to build (profitably) instead of raise?&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<p><em>Prioritize growth over profitability to achieve outlier success</em></p>



<ul>
<li>For many founders, opting for growth over profitability has clear advantages: you can hire more, build more, market more; in short you can be generally more offensive. But for founders with the goal of creating a sustainable and durable business, prioritizing profitability growth over growth-at-all costs makes more sense. During a time when VCs were fawning over him, Ivan at Notion famously told investors that he’d “prefer to raise from his customers” as opposed to taking outside capital. Countless high-potential startups would still be around today if they had the same discipline.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<p>No doubt more venture capital can help, but it can also certainly hurt.&nbsp;</p>



<p>VCs sell a product to founders. That product has ballooned over time in ways so that it can now potentially do harm. Like any other consumers, it falls to the founders of the companies to understand what they’re buying, and why it’s being sold in a particular way.</p>











<p><strong>Foolproof rich</strong></p>



<p>Here are the economics and incentives of the VC funds and why funds tend to grow over time.</p>



<p>The bigger the fund size, the more GPs get paid. A typical venture fund has a 2% management fee, paid <em>irrespective of performance</em> and based on fund size, and 20% carry, based on return of capital.</p>



<p>Consider this simplified model:</p>



<ul>
<li>A $100M fund which does 4x earns the GPs $80M ($60M in carry, plus $20M in management fees)</li>



<li>A $1B fund which does 1.5x earns the GPs $300M ($100M in carry, plus $200M in management fees)</li>
</ul>



<p>A large, poorly performing fund (1.5x) pays its GPs dramatically more than a smaller, higher performing (4x) fund. Stunningly, the large fund GPs would earn dramatically more on simple management fees alone (i.e. even if the fund was 0x, the GPs earn $200M). Granted, the $1B fund may have more GPs, but the payout differential is eye opening.</p>



<p>Further, smaller funds historically achieve higher returns than larger funds. For example, funds with $200M in AUM (assets under management) or less have an average top decile IRR of 62% over that last 10 years (2010-2020), versus funds with $1B-10B with an average top decile IRR of 27% (PitchBook). That’s more than a 2x difference.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With a larger fund, GPs are opting into a model that will likely yield poorer returns, but certainly pay them more.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Across investment management, the larger the AUM, the lower (yet hopefully more stable) the returns, the more management tends to be paid. It’s not controversial, but it does have implications for founders:</p>



<p>When that large, multi-stage VC offers you a term sheet with 2x the capital than all the other term sheets – pause.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That larger sum of capital might be the right thing for your company, or it might not be.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>But it is certainly the right thing for that VC’s business model.&nbsp;</p>











<p><strong>Raise less, build more</strong></p>



<p>After watching their peers fall victim to excess (from too much capital) and more recently to starvation (from too little VC capital with the recent pullback), more founders are questioning the wisdom of the current conventional venture funding path.</p>



<p>Instead of treating venture as a default, founders are going back to first principles and asking new questions:</p>



<p>What, exactly, is the right fundraising strategy for <em>my</em> company? What options exist?</p>



<p>Today, there is a growing common awareness amongst founders that a VC-only path can put them out of business, from either too little capital or pressure to take too much capital. If their company doesn’t exist, the chance of success is zero. On the other hand, if they are constrained by just profitability, they might not be able to build what they need to build, or others can outrun them. Bootstrapping alone can also impede.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I’ve had similar conversations with dozens of founders on this topic, and I’m seeing them quietly start to pursue a new path – one that doesn’t perfectly fit within the lines prescribed by Sand Hill Road.</p>



<p>They are seeking to combine the growth of targeted venture funding with the durability found in bootstrapping (i.e. profitability).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Their goal is to build a viable business <em>first</em>, while also harnessing the growth, network, and brand benefits of strategically raising capital from top investors.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s a new hybrid path, and one that maximizes their odds of survival <em>and</em> breakout success.</p>



<p>Bootstrapping ethos encourages becoming profitable early, or having a path to profitability – which makes it more likely a company will stick around independent of venture capital. While targeted venture brings appropriate capital for growth as well as access to the networks and brand signals brought by top investors.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Practically, these new principles are translating into the following tactics:</p>



<ul>
<li>Raising a seed round with the primary aim of becoming profitable (as opposed to the primary aim of raising a Series A)</li>



<li>Raising a venture round from a top fund, gaining one top board member, but from there, opting out of raising a series of rounds</li>



<li>Raising smaller, disciplined amounts of capital, or delaying raises if the company is profitable and growing well</li>
</ul>



<p>In the past, some of these tactics were seen as controversial, if not renegade. Going forward, I see a groundswell movement and eventual wide-scale practice of this approach. We’ve already seen standout companies over the past 15 years – including Notion, Zapier, and Vanta to name a few – implement portions of these tactics to great success.&nbsp;</p>



<p>More startups will adopt this approach as they come to understand its advantages, including:</p>



<ul>
<li><em>A more disciplined, focused culture: </em>Operating with financial constraints instills a culture of fiscal literacy and responsibility throughout the organization. It also primes creativity and inventiveness.</li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li><em>A sharper, more coordinated product</em>: To keep customers paying, companies must keep customers delighted. A mandate to generate compounding revenue sustains pressure on product teams to listen to their users, understand the wider market, and craft a beloved product. It also forces product and engineering teams to work in concert with sales, marketing, and support on a common goal.</li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li><em>More control, ownership, and upside: </em>Founders will likely retain authority on everything from company decisions to exit scenarios. For example, less capital creates less of a preference stack for founders and employees on M&amp;A exits; it’s also more likely to ensure founder control of the exit decision, including whether to go public.</li>
</ul>



<p>It yields all these benefits without sacrificing the growth and value brought by VC funds.</p>



<p>Founders who choose to raise less are liberating themselves from the venture hamster wheel, and in the process, are giving themselves more power to build generational companies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In short, the “raise less, build more” approach empowers founders to be builders again.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And that makes for better products, better teams, and better, more valuable, companies.&nbsp;</p>

    <h2><a href="https://go.dev/blog/">The Go Blog</a></h2>
    

    
      
      
      
      <p>One of the key benefits of open-source software is that anyone can read
the source code and inspect what it does.
And yet most software, even open-source software,
is downloaded in the form of compiled binaries,
which are much more difficult to inspect.
If an attacker wanted to run a <a href="https://cloud.google.com/software-supply-chain-security/docs/attack-vectors" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">supply chain attack</a>
on an open-source project,
the least visible way would be to replace the binaries being served while
leaving the source code unmodified.</p>
<p>The best way to address this kind of attack is to make open-source software
builds <em>reproducible</em>,
meaning that a build that starts with the same sources produces the same
outputs every time it runs.
That way, anyone can verify that posted binaries are free of hidden changes
by building from authentic sources and checking that the rebuilt binaries
are bit-for-bit identical to the posted binaries.
That approach proves the binaries have no backdoors or other changes not
present in the source code,
without having to disassemble or look inside them at all.
Since anyone can verify the binaries, independent groups can easily detect
and report supply chain attacks.</p>
<p>As supply chain security becomes more important,
so do reproducible builds, because they provide a simple way to verify the
posted binaries for open-source projects.</p>
<p>Go 1.21.0 is the first Go toolchain with perfectly reproducible builds.
Earlier toolchains were possible to reproduce,
but only with significant effort, and probably no one did:
they just trusted that the binaries posted on <a href="https://go.dev/dl/">go.dev/dl</a> were the correct ones.
Now it’s easy to “trust but verify.”</p>
<p>This post explains what goes into making builds reproducible,
examines the many changes we had to make to Go to make Go toolchains reproducible,
and then demonstrates one of the benefits of reproducibility by verifying
the Ubuntu package for Go 1.21.0.</p>
<h2 id="how">Making a Build Reproducible</h2>
<p>Computers are generally deterministic, so you might think all builds would
be equally reproducible.
That’s only true from a certain point of view.
Let’s call a piece of information a <em>relevant input</em> when the output of
a build can change depending on that input.
A build is reproducible if it can be repeated with all the same relevant inputs.
Unfortunately, lots of build tools turn out to incorporate inputs that we
would usually not realize are relevant and that might be difficult to recreate
or provide as input.
Let’s call an input an <em>unintentional input</em> when it turns out to be relevant
but we didn’t mean it to be.</p>
<p>The most common unintentional input in build systems is the current time.
If a build writes an executable to disk, the file system records the current
time as the executable’s modification time.
If the build then packages that file using a tool like “tar” or “zip”,
the modification time is written into the archive.
We certainly didn’t want our build to change based on the current time, but it does.
So the current time turns out to be an unintentional input to the build.
Worse, most programs don’t let you provide the current time as an input,
so there is no way to repeat this build.
To fix this, we might set the time stamps on created files to Unix time
0 or to a specific time read from one of the build’s source files.
That way, the current time is no longer a relevant input to the build.</p>
<p>Common relevant inputs to a build include:</p>
<ul>
<li>the specific version of the source code to build;</li>
<li>the specific versions of dependencies that will be included in the build;</li>
<li>the operating system running the build, which may affect path names in the resulting binaries;</li>
<li>the architecture of the CPU on the build system,</li>
<li>which may affect which optimizations the compiler uses or the layout of certain data structures;</li>
<li>the compiler version being used, as well as compiler options passed to it, which affect how the code is compiled;</li>
<li>the name of the directory containing the source code, which may appear in debug information;</li>
<li>the user name, group name, uid, and gid of the account running the build, which may appear in file metadata in an archive;</li>
<li>and many more.</li>
</ul>
<p>To have a reproducible build, every relevant input must be configurable in the build,
and then the binaries must be posted alongside an explicit configuration
listing every relevant input.
If you’ve done that, you have a reproducible build. Congratulations!</p>
<p>We’re not done, though. If the binaries can only be reproduced if you
first find a computer with the right architecture,
install a specific operating system version,
compiler version, put the source code in the right directory,
set your user identity correctly, and so on,
that may be too much work in practice for anyone to bother.</p>
<p>We want builds to be not just reproducible but <em>easy to reproduce</em>.
To do that, we need to identify relevant inputs and then,
instead of documenting them, eliminate them.
The build obviously has to depend on the source code being built,
but everything else can be eliminated.
When a build’s only relevant input is its source code,
let’s call that <em>perfectly reproducible</em>.</p>
<h2 id="go">Perfectly Reproducible Builds for Go</h2>
<p>As of Go 1.21, the Go toolchain is perfectly reproducible:
its only relevant input is the source code for that build.
We can build a specific toolchain (say, Go for Linux/x86-64) on a Linux/x86-64 host,
or a Windows/ARM64 host, or a FreeBSD/386 host,
or any other host that supports Go, and we can use any Go bootstrap compiler,
including bootstrapping all the way back to Go 1.4’s C implementation,
and we can vary any other details.
None of that changes the toolchains that are built.
If we start with the same toolchain source code,
we will get the exact same toolchain binaries out.</p>
<p>This perfect reproducibility is the culmination of efforts dating back originally to Go 1.10,
although most of the effort was concentrated in Go 1.20 and Go 1.21.
This section highlights some of the most interesting relevant inputs that we eliminated.</p>
<h3 id="go110">Reproducibility in Go 1.10</h3>
<p>Go 1.10 introduced a content-aware build cache that decides whether targets
are up-to-date based on a fingerprint of the build inputs instead of file modification times.
Because the toolchain itself is one of those build inputs,
and because Go is written in Go, the <a href="https://go.dev/s/go15bootstrap">bootstrap process</a>
would only converge if the toolchain build on a single machine was reproducible.
The overall toolchain build looks like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://go.dev/blog/rebuild/bootstrap.png" srcset="https://go.dev/blog/rebuild/bootstrap.png 1x, https://go.dev/blog/rebuild/bootstrap@2x.png 2x" width="515" height="177">
</p>
<p>We start by building the sources for the current Go toolchain using an earlier Go version,
the bootstrap toolchain (Go 1.10 used Go 1.4, written in C;
Go 1.21 uses Go 1.17).
That produces “toolchain1”, which we use to build everything again,
producing “toolchain2”, which we use to build everything again,
producing “toolchain3”.</p>
<p>Toolchain1 and toolchain2 have been built from the same sources but with
different Go implementations (compilers and libraries),
so their binaries are certain to be different.
However, if both Go implementations are non-buggy,
correct implementations, toolchain1 and toolchain2 should behave exactly the same.
In particular, when presented with the Go 1.X sources,
toolchain1’s output (toolchain2) and toolchain2’s output (toolchain3)
should be identical,
meaning toolchain2 and toolchain3 should be identical.</p>
<p>At least, that’s the idea. Making that true in practice required removing a couple unintentional inputs:</p>
<p><strong>Randomness.</strong> Map iteration and running work in multiple goroutines serialized
with locks both introduce randomness in the order that results may be generated.
This randomness can make the toolchain produce one of several different
possible outputs each time it runs.
To make the build reproducible, we had to find each of these and sort the
relevant list of items before using it to generate output.</p>
<p><strong>Bootstrap Libraries.</strong> Any library used by the compiler that can choose
from multiple different correct outputs might change its output from one
Go version to the next.
If that library output change causes a compiler output change,
then toolchain1 and toolchain2 will not be semantically identical,
and toolchain2 and toolchain3 will not be bit-for-bit identical.</p>
<p>The canonical example is the <a href="https://go.dev/pkg/sort/"><code>sort</code></a> package,
which can place elements that compare equal in <a href="https://go.dev/blog/compat#output">any order it likes</a>.
A register allocator might sort to prioritize commonly used variables,
and the linker sorts symbols in the data section by size.
To completely eliminate any effect from the sorting algorithm,
the comparison function used must never report two distinct elements as equal.
In practice, this invariant turned out to be too onerous to impose on every
use of sort in the toolchain,
so instead we arranged to copy the Go 1.X <code>sort</code> package into the source
tree that is presented to the bootstrap compiler.
That way, the compiler uses the same sort algorithm when using the bootstrap
toolchain as it does when built with itself.</p>
<p>Another package we had to copy was <a href="https://go.dev/pkg/compress/zlib/"><code>compress/zlib</code></a>,
because the linker writes compressed debug information,
and optimizations to compression libraries can change the exact output.
Over time, we’ve <a href="https://go.googlesource.com/go/+/go1.21.0/src/cmd/dist/buildtool.go#55" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">added other packages to that list too</a>.
This approach has the added benefit of allowing the Go 1.X compiler to use
new APIs added to those packages immediately,
at the cost that those packages must be written to compile with older versions of Go.</p>
<h3 id="go120">Reproducibility in Go 1.20</h3>
<p>Work on Go 1.20 prepared for both easy reproducible builds and <a href="https://go.dev/blog/toolchain">toolchain management</a>
by removing two more relevant inputs from the toolchain build.</p>
<p><strong>Host C toolchain.</strong> Some Go packages, most notably <code>net</code>,
default to <a href="https://go.dev/blog/cgo">using <code>cgo</code></a> on most operating systems.
In some cases, such as macOS and Windows,
invoking system DLLs using <code>cgo</code> is the only reliable way to resolve host names.
When we use <code>cgo</code>, though, we invoke the host C toolchain (meaning a specific
C compiler and C library),
and different toolchains have different compilation algorithms and library code,
producing different outputs.
The build graph for a <code>cgo</code> package looks like:</p>
<p><img src="https://go.dev/blog/rebuild/cgo.png" srcset="https://go.dev/blog/rebuild/cgo.png 1x, https://go.dev/blog/rebuild/cgo@2x.png 2x" width="441" height="344">
</p>
<p>The host C toolchain is therefore a relevant input to the pre-compiled <code>net.a</code>
that ships with the toolchain.
For Go 1.20, we decided to fix this by removing <code>net.a</code> from the toolchain.
That is, Go 1.20 stopped shipping pre-compiled packages to seed the build cache with.
Now, the first time a program uses package <code>net</code>,
the Go toolchain compiles it using the local system’s C toolchain and caches that result.
In addition to removing a relevant input from toolchain builds and making
toolchain downloads smaller,
not shipping pre-compiled packages also makes toolchain downloads more portable.
If we build package <code>net</code> on one system with one C toolchain and then compile
other parts of the program on a different system with a different C toolchain,
in general there is no guarantee that the two parts can be linked together.</p>
<p>One reason we shipped the pre-compiled <code>net</code> package in the first place
was to allow building programs that used package net even on systems without
a C toolchain installed.
If there’s no pre-compiled package, what happens on those systems? The
answer varies by operating system,
but in all cases we arranged for the Go toolchain to continue to work well
for building pure Go programs without a host C toolchain.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>On macOS, we rewrote package net using the underlying mechanisms that cgo would use,
without any actual C code.
This avoids invoking the host C toolchain but still emits a binary that
refers to the required system DLLs.
This approach is only possible because every Mac has the same dynamic libraries installed.
Making the non-cgo macOS package net use the system DLLs also meant that
cross-compiled macOS executables now use the system DLLs for network access,
resolving a long-standing feature request.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On Windows, package net already made direct use of DLLs without C code, so nothing needed to be changed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On Unix systems, we cannot assume a specific DLL interface to network code,
but the pure Go version works fine for systems that use typical IP and DNS setups.
Also, it is much easier to install a C toolchain on Unix systems than it
is on macOS and especially Windows.
We changed the <code>go</code> command to enable or disable <code>cgo</code> automatically based
on whether the system has a C toolchain installed.
Unix systems without a C toolchain fall back to the pure Go version of package net,
and in the rare cases where that’s not good enough,
they can install a C toolchain.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Having dropped the pre-compiled packages,
the only part of the Go toolchain that still depended on the host C toolchain
was binaries built using package net,
specifically the <code>go</code> command.
With the macOS improvements, it was now viable to build those commands with <code>cgo</code> disabled,
completely removing the host C toolchain as an input,
but we left that final step for Go 1.21.</p>
<p><strong>Host dynamic linker.</strong> When programs use <code>cgo</code> on a system using dynamically linked C libraries,
the resulting binaries contain the path to the system’s dynamic linker,
something like <code>/lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2</code>.
If the path is wrong, the binaries don’t run.
Typically each operating system/architecture combination has a single correct
answer for this path.
Unfortunately, musl-based Linuxes like Alpine Linux use a different dynamic
linker than glibc-based Linuxes like Ubuntu.
To make Go run at all on Alpine Linux, in Go bootstrap process looked like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://go.dev/blog/rebuild/linker1.png" srcset="https://go.dev/blog/rebuild/linker1.png 1x, https://go.dev/blog/rebuild/linker1@2x.png 2x" width="480" height="209">
</p>
<p>The bootstrap program cmd/dist inspected the local system’s dynamic linker
and wrote that value into a new source file compiled along with the rest
of the linker sources,
effectively hard-coding that default into the linker itself.
Then when the linker built a program from a set of compiled packages,
it used that default.
The result is that a Go toolchain built on Alpine is different from a toolchain built on Ubuntu:
the host configuration is a relevant input to the toolchain build.
This is a reproducibility problem but also a portability problem:
a Go toolchain built on Alpine doesn’t build working binaries or even
run on Ubuntu, and vice versa.</p>
<p>For Go 1.20, we took a step toward fixing the reproducibility problem by
changing the linker to consult the host configuration when it is running,
instead of having a default hard-coded at toolchain build time:</p>
<p><img src="https://go.dev/blog/rebuild/linker2.png" srcset="https://go.dev/blog/rebuild/linker2.png 1x, https://go.dev/blog/rebuild/linker2@2x.png 2x" width="450" height="175">
</p>
<p>This fixed the portability of the linker binary on Alpine Linux,
although not the overall toolchain, since the <code>go</code> command still used package
<code>net</code> and therefore <code>cgo</code> and therefore had a dynamic linker reference in its own binary.
Just as in the previous section, compiling the <code>go</code> command without <code>cgo</code>
enabled would fix this,
but we left that change for Go 1.21.
(We didn’t feel there was enough time left in the Go 1.20 cycle to test
such that change properly.)</p>
<h3 id="go121">Reproducibility in Go 1.21</h3>
<p>For Go 1.21, the goal of perfect reproducibility was in sight,
and we took care of the remaining, mostly small,
relevant inputs that remained.</p>
<p><strong>Host C toolchain and dynamic linker.</strong> As discussed above,
Go 1.20 took important steps toward removing the host C toolchain and dynamic
linker as relevant inputs.
Go 1.21 completed the removal of these relevant inputs by building the toolchain
with <code>cgo</code> disabled.
This improved portability of the toolchain too:
Go 1.21 is the first Go release where the standard Go toolchain runs unmodified
on Alpine Linux systems.</p>
<p>Removing these relevant inputs made it possible to cross-compile a Go toolchain
from a different system without any loss in functionality.
That in turn improved the supply chain security of the Go toolchain:
we can now build Go toolchains for all target systems using a trusted Linux/x86-64 system,
instead of needing to arrange a separate trusted system for each target.
As a result, Go 1.21 is the first release to include posted binaries for
all systems at <a href="https://go.dev/dl/">go.dev/dl/</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Source directory.</strong> Go programs include full paths in the runtime and debugging metadata,
so that when a program crashes or is run in a debugger,
stack traces include the full path to the source file,
not just the name of the file in an unspecified directory.
Unfortunately, including the full path makes the directory where the source
code is stored a relevant input to the build.
To fix this, Go 1.21 changed the release toolchain builds to install commands
like the compiler using <code>go install -trimpath</code>,
which replaces the source directory with the module path of the code.
If a released compiler crashes, the stack trace will print paths like <code>cmd/compile/main.go</code>
instead of <code>/home/user/go/src/cmd/compile/main.go</code>.
Since the full paths would refer to a directory on a different machine anyway,
this rewrite is no loss.
On the other hand, for non-release builds,
we keep the full path, so that when developers working on the compiler itself cause it to crash,
IDEs and other tools reading those crashes can easily find the correct source file.</p>
<p><strong>Host operating system.</strong> Paths on Windows systems are backslash-separated,
like <code>cmd\compile\main.go</code>.
Other systems use forward slashes, like <code>cmd/compile/main.go</code>.
Although earlier versions of Go had normalized most of these paths to use forward slashes,
one inconsistency had crept back in, causing slightly different toolchain builds on Windows.
We found and fixed the bug.</p>
<p><strong>Host architecture.</strong> Go runs on a variety of ARM systems and can emit
code using a software library for floating-point math (SWFP) or using hardware
floating-point instructions (HWFP).
Toolchains defaulting to one mode or the other will necessarily differ.
Like we saw with the dynamic linker earlier,
the Go bootstrap process inspected the build system to make sure that the
resulting toolchain worked on that system.
For historical reasons, the rule was “assume SWFP unless the build is
running on an ARM system with floating-point hardware”,
with cross-compiled toolchains assuming SWFP.
The vast majority of ARM systems today do have floating-point hardware,
so this introduced an unnecessary difference between natively compiled and
cross-compiled toolchains,
and as a further wrinkle, Windows ARM builds always assumed HWFP,
making the decision operating system-dependent.
We changed the rule to be “assume HWFP unless the build is running on
an ARM system without floating-point hardware”.
This way, cross-compilation and builds on modern ARM systems produce identical toolchains.</p>
<p><strong>Packaging logic.</strong> All the code to create the actual toolchain archives
we post for download lived in a separate Git repository,
golang.org/x/build, and the exact details of how archives get packaged does change over time.
If you wanted to reproduce those archives,
you needed to have the right version of that repository.
We removed this relevant input by moving the code to package the archives
into the main Go source tree, as <code>cmd/distpack</code>.
As of Go 1.21, if you have the sources for a given version of Go,
you also have the sources for packaging the archives.
The golang.org/x/build repository is no longer a relevant input.</p>
<p><strong>User IDs.</strong> The tar archives we posted for download were built from a
distribution written to the file system,
and using <a href="https://go.dev/pkg/archive/tar/#FileInfoHeader"><code>tar.FileInfoHeader</code></a> copies
the user and group IDs from the file system into the tar file,
making the user running the build a relevant input.
We changed the archiving code to clear these.</p>
<p><strong>Current time.</strong> Like with user IDs, the tar and zip archives we posted
for download had been built by copying the file system modification times into the archives,
making the current time a relevant input.
We could have cleared the time, but we thought it would look surprising
and possibly even break some tools to use the Unix or MS-DOS zero time.
Instead, we changed the go/VERSION file stored in the repository to add
the time associated with that version:</p>
<pre><code>$ cat go1.21.0/VERSION
go1.21.0
time 2023-08-04T20:14:06Z
$
</code></pre>
<p>The packagers now copy the time from the VERSION file when writing files to archives,
instead of copying the local file’s modification times.</p>
<p><strong>Cryptographic signing keys.</strong> The Go toolchain for macOS won’t run on
end-user systems unless we sign the binaries with an Apple-approved signing key.
We use an internal system to get them signed with Google’s signing key,
and obviously we cannot share that secret key in order to allow others to
reproduce the signed binaries.
Instead, we wrote a verifier that can check whether two binaries are identical
except for their signatures.</p>
<p><strong>OS-specific packagers.</strong> We use the Xcode tools <code>pkgbuild</code> and <code>productbuild</code>
to create the downloadable macOS PKG installer,
and we use WiX to create the downloadable Windows MSI installer.
We don’t want verifiers to need the same exact versions of those tools,
so we took the same approach as for the cryptographic signing keys,
writing a verifier that can look inside the packages and check that the
toolchain files are exactly as expected.</p>
<h2 id="verify">Verifying the Go Toolchains</h2>
<p>It’s not enough to make Go toolchains reproducible once.
We want to make sure they stay reproducible,
and we want to make sure others can reproduce them easily.</p>
<p>To keep ourselves honest, we now build all Go distributions on both a trusted
Linux/x86-64 system and a Windows/x86-64 system.
Except for the architecture, the two systems have almost nothing in common.
The two systems must produce bit-for-bit identical archives or else we do
not proceed with the release.</p>
<p>To allow others to verify that we’re honest,
we’ve written and published a verifier,
<a href="https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/build/cmd/gorebuild" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank"><code>golang.org/x/build/cmd/gorebuild</code></a>.
That program will start with the source code in our Git repository and rebuild the
current Go versions, checking that they match the archives posted on <a href="https://go.dev/dl/">go.dev/dl</a>.
Most archives are required to match bit-for-bit.
As mentioned above, there are three exceptions where a more relaxed check is used:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The macOS tar.gz file is expected to differ,
but then the verifier compares the contents inside.
The rebuilt and posted copies must contain the same files,
and all the files must match exactly, except for executable binaries.
Executable binaries must match exactly after stripping code signatures.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The macOS PKG installer is not rebuilt. Instead,
the verifier reads the files inside the PKG installer and checks that they
match the macOS tar.gz exactly,
again after code signature stripping.
In the long term, the PKG creation is trivial enough that it could potentially
be added to cmd/distpack,
but the verifier would still have to parse the PKG file to run the signature-ignoring
code executable comparison.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Windows MSI installer is not rebuilt.
Instead, the verifier invokes the Linux program <code>msiextract</code> to extract
the files inside and check that they match the rebuilt Windows zip file exactly.
In the long term, perhaps the MSI creation could be added to cmd/distpack,
and then the verifier could use a bit-for-bit MSI comparison.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We run <code>gorebuild</code> nightly, posting the results at <a href="https://go.dev/rebuild">go.dev/rebuild</a>,
and of course anyone else can run it too.</p>
<h2 id="ubuntu">Verifying Ubuntu’s Go Toolchain</h2>
<p>The Go toolchain’s easily reproducible builds should mean that the binaries
in the toolchains posted on go.dev match the binaries included in other packaging systems,
even when those packagers build from source.
Even if the packagers have compiled with different configurations or other changes,
the easily reproducible builds should still make it easy to reproduce their binaries.
To demonstrate this, let’s reproduce the Ubuntu <code>golang-1.21</code> package
version <code>1.21.0-1</code> for Linux/x86-64.</p>
<p>To start, we need to download and extract the Ubuntu packages,
which are <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/1/ar" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">ar(1) archives</a> containing zstd-compressed tar archives:</p>
<pre><code>$ mkdir deb
$ cd deb
$ curl -LO http://mirrors.kernel.org/ubuntu/pool/main/g/golang-1.21/golang-1.21-src_1.21.0-1_all.deb
$ ar xv golang-1.21-src_1.21.0-1_all.deb
x - debian-binary
x - control.tar.zst
x - data.tar.zst
$ unzstd &lt; data.tar.zst | tar xv
...
x ./usr/share/go-1.21/src/archive/tar/common.go
x ./usr/share/go-1.21/src/archive/tar/example_test.go
x ./usr/share/go-1.21/src/archive/tar/format.go
x ./usr/share/go-1.21/src/archive/tar/fuzz_test.go
...
$
</code></pre>
<p>That was the source archive. Now the amd64 binary archive:</p>
<pre><code>$ rm -f debian-binary *.zst
$ curl -LO http://mirrors.kernel.org/ubuntu/pool/main/g/golang-1.21/golang-1.21-go_1.21.0-1_amd64.deb
$ ar xv golang-1.21-src_1.21.0-1_all.deb
x - debian-binary
x - control.tar.zst
x - data.tar.zst
$ unzstd &lt; data.tar.zst | tar xv | grep -v '/$'
...
x ./usr/lib/go-1.21/bin/go
x ./usr/lib/go-1.21/bin/gofmt
x ./usr/lib/go-1.21/go.env
x ./usr/lib/go-1.21/pkg/tool/linux_amd64/addr2line
x ./usr/lib/go-1.21/pkg/tool/linux_amd64/asm
x ./usr/lib/go-1.21/pkg/tool/linux_amd64/buildid
...
$
</code></pre>
<p>Ubuntu splits the normal Go tree into two halves,
in /usr/share/go-1.21 and /usr/lib/go-1.21.
Let’s put them back together:</p>
<pre><code>$ mkdir go-ubuntu
$ cp -R usr/share/go-1.21/* usr/lib/go-1.21/* go-ubuntu
cp: cannot overwrite directory go-ubuntu/api with non-directory usr/lib/go-1.21/api
cp: cannot overwrite directory go-ubuntu/misc with non-directory usr/lib/go-1.21/misc
cp: cannot overwrite directory go-ubuntu/pkg/include with non-directory usr/lib/go-1.21/pkg/include
cp: cannot overwrite directory go-ubuntu/src with non-directory usr/lib/go-1.21/src
cp: cannot overwrite directory go-ubuntu/test with non-directory usr/lib/go-1.21/test
$
</code></pre>
<p>The errors are complaining about copying symlinks, which we can ignore.</p>
<p>Now we need to download and extract the upstream Go sources:</p>
<pre><code>$ curl -LO https://go.googlesource.com/go/+archive/refs/tags/go1.21.0.tar.gz
$ mkdir go-clean
$ cd go-clean
$ curl -L https://go.googlesource.com/go/+archive/refs/tags/go1.21.0.tar.gz | tar xzv
...
x src/archive/tar/common.go
x src/archive/tar/example_test.go
x src/archive/tar/format.go
x src/archive/tar/fuzz_test.go
...
$
</code></pre>
<p>To skip some trial and error, it turns out that Ubuntu builds Go with <code>GO386=softfloat</code>,
which forces the use of software floating point when compiling for 32-bit x86,
and strips (removes symbol tables from) the resulting ELF binaries.
Let’s start with a <code>GO386=softfloat</code> build:</p>
<pre><code>$ cd src
$ GOOS=linux GO386=softfloat ./make.bash -distpack
Building Go cmd/dist using /Users/rsc/sdk/go1.17.13. (go1.17.13 darwin/amd64)
Building Go toolchain1 using /Users/rsc/sdk/go1.17.13.
Building Go bootstrap cmd/go (go_bootstrap) using Go toolchain1.
Building Go toolchain2 using go_bootstrap and Go toolchain1.
Building Go toolchain3 using go_bootstrap and Go toolchain2.
Building commands for host, darwin/amd64.
Building packages and commands for target, linux/amd64.
Packaging archives for linux/amd64.
distpack: 818d46ede85682dd go1.21.0.src.tar.gz
distpack: 4fcd8651d084a03d go1.21.0.linux-amd64.tar.gz
distpack: eab8ed80024f444f v0.0.1-go1.21.0.linux-amd64.zip
distpack: 58528cce1848ddf4 v0.0.1-go1.21.0.linux-amd64.mod
distpack: d8da1f27296edea4 v0.0.1-go1.21.0.linux-amd64.info
---
Installed Go for linux/amd64 in /Users/rsc/deb/go-clean
Installed commands in /Users/rsc/deb/go-clean/bin
*** You need to add /Users/rsc/deb/go-clean/bin to your PATH.
$
</code></pre>
<p>That left the standard package in <code>pkg/distpack/go1.21.0.linux-amd64.tar.gz</code>.
Let’s unpack it and strip the binaries to match Ubuntu:</p>
<pre><code>$ cd ../..
$ tar xzvf go-clean/pkg/distpack/go1.21.0.linux-amd64.tar.gz
x go/CONTRIBUTING.md
x go/LICENSE
x go/PATENTS
x go/README.md
x go/SECURITY.md
x go/VERSION
...
$ elfstrip go/bin/* go/pkg/tool/linux_amd64/*
$
</code></pre>
<p>Now we can diff the Go toolchain we’ve created on our Mac with the Go toolchain that Ubuntu ships:</p>
<pre><code>$ diff -r go go-ubuntu
Only in go: CONTRIBUTING.md
Only in go: LICENSE
Only in go: PATENTS
Only in go: README.md
Only in go: SECURITY.md
Only in go: codereview.cfg
Only in go: doc
Only in go: lib
Binary files go/misc/chrome/gophertool/gopher.png and go-ubuntu/misc/chrome/gophertool/gopher.png differ
Only in go-ubuntu/pkg/tool/linux_amd64: dist
Only in go-ubuntu/pkg/tool/linux_amd64: distpack
Only in go/src: all.rc
Only in go/src: clean.rc
Only in go/src: make.rc
Only in go/src: run.rc
diff -r go/src/syscall/mksyscall.pl go-ubuntu/src/syscall/mksyscall.pl
1c1
&lt; #!/usr/bin/env perl
---
&gt; #! /usr/bin/perl
...
$
</code></pre>
<p>We’ve successfully reproduced the Ubuntu package’s executables and identified
the complete set of changes that remain:</p>
<ul>
<li>Various metadata and supporting files have been deleted.</li>
<li>The <code>gopher.png</code> file has been modified. On closer inspection the two are
identical except for an embedded timestamp that Ubuntu has updated.
Perhaps Ubuntu’s packaging scripts recompressed the png with a tool that
rewrites the timestamp even when it cannot improve on the existing compression.</li>
<li>The binaries <code>dist</code> and <code>distpack</code>, which are built during bootstrap but
not included in standard archives,
have been included in the Ubuntu package.</li>
<li>The Plan 9 build scripts (<code>*.rc</code>) have been deleted, although the Windows build scripts (<code>*.bat</code>) remain.</li>
<li><code>mksyscall.pl</code> and seven other Perl scripts not shown have had their headers changed.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note in particular that we’ve reconstructed the toolchain binaries bit-for-bit:
they do not show up in the diff at all.
That is, we proved that the Ubuntu Go binaries correspond exactly to the
upstream Go sources.</p>
<p>Even better, we proved this without using any Ubuntu software at all:
these commands were run on a Mac, and <a href="https://github.com/rsc/tmp/blob/master/unzstd/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank"><code>unzstd</code></a>
and <a href="https://github.com/rsc/tmp/blob/master/elfstrip/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank"><code>elfstrip</code></a> are short Go programs.
A sophisticated attacker might insert malicious code into an Ubuntu package
by changing the package-creation tools.
If they did, reproducing the Go Ubuntu package from clean sources using
those malicious tools would still produce bit-for-bit identical copies of
the malicious packages.
This attack would be invisible to that kind of rebuild,
much like <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/358198.358210" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Ken Thompson’s compiler attack</a>.
Verifying the Ubuntu packages using no Ubuntu software at all is a much
stronger check.
Go’s perfectly reproducible builds, which don’t depend on unindented
details like the host operating system,
host architecture, and host C toolchain, are what make this stronger check possible.</p>
<p>(As an aside for the historical record, Ken Thompson told me once that his
attack was in fact detected,
because the compiler build stopped being reproducible.
It had a bug: a string constant in the backdoor added to the compiler was
imperfectly handled and grew by a single NUL byte each time the compiler compiled itself.
Eventually someone noticed the non-reproducible build and tried to find the cause by compiling to assembly.
The compiler’s backdoor did not reproduce itself into assembly output at all,
so assembling that output removed the backdoor.)</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Reproducible builds are an important tool for strengthening the open-source supply chain.
Frameworks like <a href="https://slsa.dev/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">SLSA</a> focus on provenance and a software
chain of custody that can be used to inform decisions about trust.
Reproducible builds complement that approach by providing a way to verify
that the trust is well-placed.</p>
<p>Perfect reproducibility (when the source files are the build’s only relevant
input) is only possible for programs that build themselves,
like compiler toolchains.
It is a lofty but worthwhile goal precisely because self-hosting compiler
toolchains are otherwise quite difficult to verify.
Go’s perfect reproducibility means that,
assuming packagers don’t modify the source code,
every repackaging of Go 1.21.0 for Linux/x86-64 (substitute your favorite
system) in any form should be distributing exactly the same binaries,
even when they all build from source.
We’ve seen that this is not quite true for Ubuntu Linux,
but perfect reproducibility still lets us reproduce the Ubuntu packaging
using a very different, non-Ubuntu system.</p>
<p>Ideally all open source software distributed in binary form would have easy-to-reproduce builds.
In practice, as we’ve seen in this post,
it is very easy for unintended inputs to leak into builds.
For Go programs that don’t need <code>cgo</code>, a reproducible build is as simple
as compiling with <code>CGO_ENABLED=0 go build -trimpath</code>.
Disabling <code>cgo</code> removes the host C toolchain as a relevant input,
and <code>-trimpath</code> removes the current directory.
If your program does need <code>cgo</code>, you need to arrange for a specific host
C toolchain version before running <code>go build</code>,
such as by running the build in a specific virtual machine or container image.</p>
<p>Moving beyond Go, the <a href="https://reproducible-builds.org/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Reproducible Builds</a>
project aims to improve reproducibility of all open source and is a good
starting point for more information about making your own software builds reproducible.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>A few weeks ago, I was part of a talk at DEF CON 31 called <a href="https://forum.defcon.org/node/245742">The Hackers, The Lawyers, and the Defense Fund</a>. I was asked to share my experience receiving a legal threat for good-faith security research from my classmates.</p><p>This story has been told before (e.g., by my <a href="https://saligrama.io/blog/post/firebase-insecure-by-default/">classmate Aditya</a> who was also involved and by the <a href="https://stanforddaily.com/2022/11/01/opinion-fizz-previously-compromised-its-users-privacy-it-may-do-so-again/">Stanford Daily</a>), but I wanted to share my talk here for posterity.</p><p>The following is an approximate transcript. I’ve added a few links and cleaned up some of the language for clarity.</p><h2 id="the-hack-itself">The hack itself</h2><p>Hey everyone! I’m going to briefly share my experience receiving a legal threat for good-faith security research, and then I’m going to share three key takeaways I had from this quite unpleasant experience.</p><p>But first, shoutout to <a href="https://saligrama.io/">Adi</a> and the whole Applied Cybersecurity crew. Adi was one of my collaborators on this disclosure, and we wouldn’t have been able to stand up for ourselves like we did if it wasn’t for the Stanford Applied Cyber community.</p><p>Last October, a Stanford student startup called Fizz started getting popular on campus. It was an anonymous social media app that claimed to be something like “100% secure”. What could go wrong?</p><p>Well, a me and few security-minded friends were drawn like moths to a flame when we heard that. Our classmates were posting quite sensitive stories on Fizz, and we wanted to make sure their information was secure.</p><p>So one Friday night, we decided to explore whether Fizz was really “100% secure” like they claimed. Well, dear reader, Fizz was not 100% secure. In fact, they hardly had any security protections at all.</p><p>In only a few hours, we were able to gain full read and write access to their database, where they were storing all their user and post information — entirely deanonymized.</p><h2 id="disclosing-the-vulnerability-to-fizz">Disclosing the vulnerability to Fizz</h2><p>So we did what any good security researcher does: We responsibly disclosed what we found. We wrote a detailed vulnerability disclosure report. We suggested remediations. And we proactively agreed not to talk about our findings publicly before an embargo date to give them time to fix the issues. And then we sent them the report via email.</p><p>At first, they were grateful. They thanked us for our report and said that fixing the issues was their top priority. Then a few weeks passed. They sent us some updates.</p><p>And then, one day, they sent us a threat. A <em>crazy</em> threat. I remember it vividly. I was just finishing a run when the email came in. And my heart rate went <em>up</em> after I stopped running. That’s not what’s supposed to happen.</p><p>They said that we had violated state and federal law. They threatened us with civil and criminal charges. 20 years in prison. They really just threw everything they could at us.</p><p>And at the end of their threat they had a demand: don’t ever talk about your findings publicly. Essentially, if you agree to silence, we won’t pursue legal action. We had five days to respond.</p><p>They wanted to scare us into silence.</p><h2 id="were-going-to-need-a-lawyer">We’re going to need a lawyer</h2><p>What do you do when you get a letter like this? Well, I kind of freaked out. I was angry and scared.</p><p>Here’s the first thing my friend Cooper said in our disclosure group chat when we got the threat: “Stay calm. Don’t do anything fucking stupid. We’re going to need a lawyer.” If you can’t tell from his wisdom: It was not Cooper’s first time dealing with legal threats.</p><p>We started asking for help in our network, and within a few days, we were connected with Kurt and Andrew at the Electronic Frontier Foundation. Kurt and Andrew generously agreed to represent us in our response to the letter pro bono.</p><p>We walked them through our disclosure and all our documentation. And with their advice, we made the decision not to cave to Fizz’s threats. That’s why I’m here on stage right now talking to you.</p><p>Kurt and Andrew drafted a response to Fizz. They really shut it down. As an aside, The Stanford Daily <a href="https://stanforddaily.com/2022/11/01/opinion-fizz-previously-compromised-its-users-privacy-it-may-do-so-again/">published</a> Fizz’s threat and EFF’s response. I really recommend that you read these docs if you haven’t already. They’re crazy.</p><p>The Fizz team then asked to meet, and we were able to resolve the situation amicably. We pushed Fizz to proactively disclose the issues to their own users, which they eventually did.</p><h2 id="relecting-on-a-stressful-time">Relecting on a stressful time</h2><p>Now let’s take a quick step back. Getting a legal threat for our good-faith security research was incredibly stressful. And the fact that it came from our classmates added insult to injury.</p><p>I have three key takeaways from this experience I want to share.</p><ol><li><p><em>Keep your research above-board and well-documented.</em> Ahead of time, think about what you’re trying to accomplish with your research and make sure that you’re not crossing any ethical lines. A big reason why we were able to resolve this amicably — and why EFF was able to respond to Fizz’s threat so thoroughly — was that we played by the rules.</p><p>We didn’t save or leak the data we had access to. We didn’t mess with anyone’s account. We didn’t cause any damage. And we kept detailed documented of everything we did. That clean documentation was incredibly helpful for us as we wrote up our vulnerability disclosure report. I imagine it also made Kurt and Andrew’s job representing us a lot easier.</p></li><li><p><em>Stay calm.</em> I can’t tell you how much I wanted to curse out the Fizz team over email. But no. We had to keep it professional — even as they resorted to legal scare tactics.</p><p>Your goal when you get a legal threat is to stay out of trouble. To resolve the situation. That’s it. The temporary satisfaction of saying “fuck you” isn’t worth giving up the possibility of an amicable resolution.</p></li><li><p><em>Get a lawyer.</em> We could have tried to navigate the process on our own. But that would have been a profound mistake. They would have likely escalated. After all, they were banking on us being naive and caving to their scare tactics. Thankfully, Kurt and Andrew swooped in and saved the day.</p><p>Now, not everyone has the ability to get EFF to represent them pro bono. But there are an increasing number of resources available to good-faith security researchers who face legal threats, and you should make use of them. Don’t try to fly solo.</p></li></ol><p>Thank you.</p><p><img src="https://miles.land/posts/classmates-legal-threat-fizz-defcon-media/talk.jpeg" alt="A photo of us after the talk.

  <p>People join social media to enhance their social lives, make new friends and build an online identity while expressing themselves. However, as they delve deeper into these digital realms, their behavior changes.</p>
<p>Engaging in likes, shares, posts and retweets becomes habitual, eclipsing the original motivations that initially drew them to the platform. What was once a conscious choice transforms into automatic, almost impulsive action.</p>
<p>Those are the findings of a new study by researchers at the USC Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences.</p>
<p>Despite public health experts <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2023/05/23/surgeon-general-issues-new-advisory-about-effects-social-media-use-has-youth-mental-health.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">raising concerns</a> about the negative impact on mental health and overall well-being, particularly among young users, a significant majority of Americans — 70%, <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2021/04/07/social-media-use-in-2021/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to Pew Research</a> — still find themselves drawn to their apps daily, some even hourly.</p>
<p><a href="https://dornsife.usc.edu/psyc/">Psychology</a> researchers <a href="https://dornsife.usc.edu/profile/wendy-wood/">Wendy Wood</a> and <a href="https://dornsife.usc.edu/psyc/profile/ian-anderson/">Ian Anderson</a> at USC Dornsife compared posting rates of frequent, habitual users with those of infrequent, nonhabitual users. They wanted to know if those groups’ rates varied in response to the reactions and comments they received from others. The <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2023-66902-001" target="_blank" rel="noopener">research</a> was published online earlier this year in <em>Motivation Science</em>.</p>
<p>Building on <a href="https://news.usc.edu/204782/usc-study-reveals-the-key-reason-why-fake-news-spreads-on-social-media/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">previous work</a>, the researchers conducted three consecutive studies focused on Instagram and Facebook posting behavior. They found evidence that users develop posting habits that differ based on how frequently they use the two apps.</p>
<p>The studies highlighted how a daily habit of posting can become insidious over time — shifting from posting with a goal in mind to posting automatically with little thought. And this behavior can lead to a never-ending urge to share content on these platforms.</p>
<p>Using metrics from Facebook and comparing habitual users with infrequent or new users, the researchers investigated whether social rewards motivate the two types of users in the same way.</p>
<p>Anderson said he and Wood also looked at whether automatic, habitual, repeated posting on Facebook or Instagram happens when social motivation is limited or absent. “In other words, do these frequent users just post no matter if they are receiving likes or comments from their posting? Or are they posting just out of sheer habit?” he asked.</p>
<h2>Social rewards only work for some</h2>
<p>The researchers found that likes, comments and shares had less impact on frequent habitual users’ motivation to post than on infrequent users and new users.</p>
<p>In a preliminary study using Instagram user data gathered from a study conducted by Emilio Ferrara of the <a href="https://viterbischool.usc.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">USC Viterbi School of Engineering</a>, Woods and Anderson found, as expected, that social rewards in the form of likes indeed did motivate users to engage more frequently and faster. The more likes a user received, the more frequently they posted. Fewer likes resulted in a slower posting rate.</p>
<p>However, digging a little deeper, the researchers made an intriguing discovery: Social rewards such as likes increased engagement primarily among new or infrequent users. In contrast, frequent users continued posting at their usual rate regardless of the reactions they received from others.</p>
<p>Woods and Anderson conducted a second study to test this theory further, examining more than 1,900 Facebook posts.</p>
<p>They found that positive reactions motivated increased and faster engagement only among infrequent and new users but not among frequent users. Replicating the results from Instagram<em>,</em> habitual Facebook users continued to post quickly regardless of whether they received positive or negative recognition.</p>
<h2>Habitual users don’t care what you think</h2>
<p>The findings confirmed what Woods and Anderson suspected: With enough repetition, users form habits or mental associations tied to specific contextual cues. Context cues include factors such as the location or time when they use the app or receive notifications. For example, a user who frequently uses the app while lying in bed, sitting on the couch or at a particular time of day will start associating using the app with those specific situations. Once these habits are formed, users respond quickly and automatically whenever they encounter these context cues, with minimal deliberation.</p>
<p>In this second study, the researchers also surveyed the participants and found that for those with really strong habits, even though they said they cared about the social rewards and reactions from other people, their behavior told a different story. These users post at roughly the same rate, no matter how many likes they get. This can have adverse consequences, Anderson said.</p>
<p>“They’re not just ignoring the likes, they’re also ignoring the consequences of posting, which is how misinformation starts to spread,” he said.</p>
<p>The study indicates that motivational interventions won’t impact habitual and nonhabitual users in the same way. Simply telling people not to share certain types of content that could be harmful, dangerous or false will not be effective for habitual users, even if it works for nonhabitual users.</p>
<h2>Structural site changes may work</h2>
<p>To further test the hypothesis that frequent habitual users are not motivated by positive feedback or warnings about not posting harmful or misinformation, the researchers examined whether a structural change in a social media platform would alter the posting rates of such users.</p>
<p>In 2007, Facebook changed its platform design to increase engagement, launching a status update bar and placing content from a user’s friends at the forefront of their news feed.</p>
<p>The change initially slowed down highly frequent posters’ automatic responses. But, for infrequent users, the structural change did what it intended to do: increase engagement with others and speed up their posting rate after receiving positive reactions.</p>
<p>The study demonstrated that the design of social platforms could have an impact for the better on the posting rates of habitual posters by slowing them down for a moment.</p>
<p>However, over time, these users regained their posting speed, suggesting that they re-trained their habitual posting behavior to fit the platform’s new design.</p>
<p>Anderson concluded that if social media companies are serious about addressing issues such as misinformation, hate speech and adolescent mental health, they must also change their platforms’ structure to impact habitual users.</p>
<p>“Interventions that work for one type of user just don’t work for the other. There will have to be something really disruptive structurally on these social media sites to change the behavior of habitual users,” he said.</p>
<p>He said that if Facebook and Instagram wanted to move behavior in another direction, they would have had to change the structures to make users post accurate content. That has not happened to the degree necessary to break frequent users’ bad habits.</p>

		<p>It was only 11 months ago that I wrote an Article entitled <a href="https://stratechery.com/2022/nvidia-in-the-valley/">Nvidia In the Valley</a>; the occasion was yet another plummet in their stock price:</p>
<blockquote><p>

</p></blockquote>
<p>To say that the company has turned things around is, needless to say, an understatement:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/nvidia-6.png?resize=640%2C310&amp;ssl=1" alt="Nvidia's latest stock rise" width="640" height="310" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/nvidia-6.png?w=1280&amp;ssl=1 1280w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/nvidia-6.png?resize=300%2C145&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/nvidia-6.png?resize=1024%2C496&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/nvidia-6.png?resize=768%2C372&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/nvidia-6.png?resize=1200%2C581&amp;ssl=1 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
<p>That big jump in May was Nvidia’s <a href="https://stratechery.com/2023/nvidia-earnings-jenson-huangs-defense-training-versus-inference/">last earnings</a>, when the company shocked investors with an incredibly ambitious forecast; this last week Nvidia vastly exceeded those expectations and forecasted even bigger growth going forward. From the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/business/earnings/nvidia-nvda-q2-earnings-report-2024-814cf32d">Wall Street Journal</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Chip maker Nvidia said revenue in its recently completed quarter more than doubled from a year ago, setting a new company record, and projected that surging interest in artificial intelligence is propelling its business faster than expected. Nvidia is at the heart of the boom in artificial intelligence that made it a $1 trillion company this year, and it is forecasting growth that outpaces even the most bullish analyst projections.</p>
<p>  Nvidia’s stock, already the top performer in the S&amp;P 500 this year, rose 7.5% following the results, which would be about $87 billion in market value. The company said revenue more than doubled in its fiscal second quarter to about $13.5 billion, far ahead of Wall Street forecasts in a FactSet survey. Even more strikingly, it said revenue in its current quarter would be around $16 billion, besting expectations by about $3.5 billion. Net profit for the company’s second quarter was $6.19 billion, also surpassing forecasts.</p>
<p>  The results show a wave of investment in artificial intelligence that began late last year with the arrival of OpenAI’s ChatGPT language-generation tool is gaining steam as companies and governments seek to harness its power in business and everyday life. Many companies see AI as indispensable to their future growth and are making large investments in computing infrastructure to support it.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Now the big question on everyone’s mind is if Nvidia is the new Cisco:</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/stockgeekTV/status/1694459398934905113"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/nvidia-1.png?resize=640%2C774&amp;ssl=1" alt="Is Nvidia Cisco?" width="640" height="774" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/nvidia-1.png?w=1184&amp;ssl=1 1184w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/nvidia-1.png?resize=248%2C300&amp;ssl=1 248w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/nvidia-1.png?resize=847%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 847w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/nvidia-1.png?resize=768%2C929&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/nvidia-1.png?resize=521%2C630&amp;ssl=1 521w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"></a></p>
<p>I don’t think so, at least in terms of the near-term: there are some fundamental differences between Nvidia and Cisco that are worth teasing out. The bigger question is the long term, and here the comparison might be more apt.</p>
<h3>Nvidia and Cisco</h3>
<p>The first difference between Nvidia and Cisco is in the above charts: Nvidia already went through a crash, thanks to the double whammy of Ethereum moving to proof-of-stake and the COVID cliff in terms of PC sales; both left Nvidia with huge amounts of inventory it had to write-off over the second half of last year. The bright spot for Nvidia was the steady growth of data center revenue, thanks to the increase of machine learning workloads; I included this chart in that Article last fall:</p>

</p></blockquote>
<p>What has happened over the last two quarters is that data center revenue is devouring the rest of the company; here is an updated version of that same chart:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/nvidia-2.png?resize=640%2C370&amp;ssl=1" alt="Nvidia's sky-rocketing AI revenue" width="640" height="370" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/nvidia-2.png?w=1280&amp;ssl=1 1280w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/nvidia-2.png?resize=300%2C173&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/nvidia-2.png?resize=1024%2C592&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/nvidia-2.png?resize=768%2C444&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/nvidia-2.png?resize=1090%2C630&amp;ssl=1 1090w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>

<p>This dramatic shift in Nvidia’s business provides some interesting contrasts to Cisco’s dot-com run-up. First, here was Cisco’s revenue, gross profit, net profit, and stock price in the ten years starting from its 1993 IPO:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/nvidia-5.png?resize=640%2C398&amp;ssl=1" alt="Cisco's revenue, profit, and stock price in the 90s" width="640" height="398" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/nvidia-5.png?w=1280&amp;ssl=1 1280w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/nvidia-5.png?resize=300%2C186&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/nvidia-5.png?resize=1024%2C636&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/nvidia-5.png?resize=768%2C477&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/nvidia-5.png?resize=1014%2C630&amp;ssl=1 1014w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
<p>Here is Nvidia’s last ten years:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/nvidia-4.png?resize=640%2C397&amp;ssl=1" alt="Nvidia's revenue, profit, and stock price" width="640" height="397" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/nvidia-4.png?w=1280&amp;ssl=1 1280w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/nvidia-4.png?resize=300%2C186&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/nvidia-4.png?resize=1024%2C634&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/nvidia-4.png?resize=768%2C476&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/nvidia-4.png?resize=1017%2C630&amp;ssl=1 1017w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
<p>The first thing to note is the extent to which Nvidia’s crash last year looks similar to Cisco’s dot-com crash: in both cases steady but steep revenue increases initially outpaced the stock price, which eventually overshot just a few quarters before big inventory write-downs led to big decreases in profitability (score one for crypto optimists hopeful that the current doldrums are simply their own dot-com hangover).</p>
<p>Cisco, though, didn’t have a second act, unlike this data center explosion. What is notable is the extent to which Nvidia’s revenue increase is matching the slope of the stock price increase (obviously this is inexact given the different axis); it seems likely that the stock will overshoot revenue growth soon enough, but it hasn’t really happened yet. It’s also worth noting how much more disciplined Nvidia appears to be in terms of below-the-line costs: its net profit is moving in concert with its revenue, unlike Cisco in the 90s; I suspect this is a function of Nvidia being a much larger and more mature company.</p>
<p>Another difference is the nature of Nvidia’s customers: over 50% of the company’s Q2 revenue came from the large cloud service providers, followed by large consumer Internet companies (i.e. Meta). This category does, of course, include the startups that once might have purchased Cisco routers and Sun servers directly, and now rent capacity (if they can get it); cloud providers, though, monetize their hardware immediately, which is good for Nvidia.</p>
<p>Still, there is an important difference from other cloud workloads: previously a new company or line of business only ramped their cloud utilization with usage, which ought to correlate to customer acquisition, if not revenue. Model training, though, is an up-front cost, not dissimilar to the cost needed to buy those Sun servers and Cisco routers in the dot-com era; that is cloud revenue that has a much higher likelihood of disappearing if the company in question doesn’t find a market.</p>
<p>This point is relevant to Nvidia given that training is the part of AI where the company is the most dominant, thanks to both its software ecosystem and the ability to operate huge fleet of Nvidia chips as a single GPU; inference is where Nvidia will first see challenges, and that is also the area of AI that is correlated with usage, and thus more durable from a cloud provider perspective.</p>
<p>Those points about a software ecosystem and hardware scalability are also the biggest reason why Nvidia is different than Cisco. Nvidia has a moat in both, along with a substantial manufacturing advantage thanks to its upfront payments to TSMC over the last several years to secure its own 4nm line (and having the good fortune of asking for more scale at a time when TSMC’s other sources of high performance computing revenue are in a slump). There is certainly a massive incentive for both the cloud providers and large Internet companies to bridge Nvidia’s moats — see AWS’s investments in its own chips, for example, or Meta’s development of and support for PyTorch — but right now Nvidia has a big lead and the frenzy inspired by ChatGPT is only deepening their install base, with all of the positive ecosystem effects that entails.</p>
<h3>GPU Demand</h3>
<p>The biggest challenge facing Nvidia is the one that is ultimately out of their control: what does the final market look like?</p>
<p>Go back to the dot-com era, and the era that proceeded it. The advent of computing, first in the form of mainframes and then the PC, digitized information, making it endlessly duplicable. Then came the Internet which made the marginal cost of distributing that content go to zero (with the caveat that most people had very low bandwidth). This was an obvious business opportunity that plenty of startups jumped all over, even as telecom companies took on the bandwidth problem; Cisco was the beneficiary of both.</p>
<p>The missing element, though, was demand: consistent consumer demand for Internet applications only started to arrive with the advent of broadband connections in the 2000s (thanks in part to a buildout that bankrupted said telecom companies), and then exploded with smartphones a decade later, which made the Internet accessible anytime, anywhere. It was demand that made the router business as big as dot-com investors thought it might be, although by then Cisco had a host of competitors, including large cloud providers who built (and open-sourced) their own.</p>
<p>There are lots of potential starting points to choose for AI: machine learning has obviously been a thing for a while, or you might point to the 2017 invention of the transformer; the release of GPT-3 in 2020 was perhaps akin to the release of the Mosaic web browser, which would make ChatGPT the Netscape IPO. One way to categorize this emergence is to characterize training as being akin to digitization in the previous era, and creation —&nbsp;i.e. inference — as akin to distribution. Once again there are obvious business opportunities that arise from combining the two, and once again startups are jumping all over them, along with the big incumbents.</p>
<p>However you want to make the analogy, what is important to note is that the missing element is the same: demand. ChatGPT took the world by storm, and the use of AI for writing code is both proliferating widely and is extremely high leverage. Every SaaS company in tech, meanwhile, is hard at work at an AI strategy, for the benefit of their sales team if nothing else. That is no small thing, and the exploration and implementation of those strategies will use up a lot of Nvidia GPUs over the next few years. The ultimate question, though, is how much of this AI stuff is actually used, and that is ultimately out of Nvidia’s control.</p>
<p>My best guess is that the next several years will be occupied building out the most obvious use cases, particularly in the enterprise; the analogy here is to the 2000s build-out of the web. The question, though, is what will be the analogy to mobile (and the cloud), which exploded demand and led to one of the most profitable decades tech has ever seen? The answer may be an already discarded fad: the metaverse.</p>
<h3>A GPU Overhang and the Metaverse</h3>
<p>In April 2022, when Dall-E 2 came out, I wrote <a href="https://stratechery.com/2022/dall-e-the-metaverse-and-zero-marginal-content/">DALL-E, the Metaverse, and Zero Marginal Content</a>, and highlighted three trends:</p>
<ul>
<li>First, the gaming industry was increasingly about a few AAA games, small indie titles, and the huge sea of mobile; the limiting factor in further development was the astronomical cost of developing high quality assets.</li>
<li>Second, social media succeeded by virtue of making content creation free, because users created the content of their own volition.</li>
<li>Third, TikTok pointed to a future where every individual not only had their own feed, but also where the provenance of that content didn’t matter.</li>
</ul>
<p>AI is how those three trends might intersect:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  What is fascinating about DALL-E is that it points to a future where these three trends can be combined. DALL-E, at the end of the day, is ultimately a product of human-generated content, just like its GPT-3 cousin. The latter, of course, is about text, while DALL-E is about images. Notice, though, that progression from text to images; it follows that machine learning-generated video is next. This will likely take several years, of course; video is a much more difficult problem, and responsive 3D environments more difficult yet, but this is a path the industry has trod before:</p>
<ul>
<li>Game developers pushed the limits on text, then images, then video, then 3D</li>
<li>Social media drives content creation costs to zero first on text, then images, then video</li>
<li>Machine learning models can now create text and images for zero marginal cost</li>
</ul>
<p>  In the very long run this points to a metaverse vision that is much less deterministic than your typical video game, yet much richer than what is generated on social media. Imagine environments that are not drawn by artists but rather created by AI: this not only increases the possibilities, but crucially, decreases the costs.
</p></blockquote>
<p>I wrote in the conclusion:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Machine learning generated content is just the next step beyond TikTok: instead of pulling content from anywhere on the network, GPT and DALL-E and other similar models generate new content from content, at zero marginal cost. This is how the economics of the metaverse will ultimately make sense: virtual worlds need virtual content created at virtually zero cost, fully customizable to the individual.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Zero marginal cost is, I should note, aspirational at this point: inference is expensive, both in terms of power and also in terms of the need to pay off all of that money that is showing up on Nvidia’s earnings. It’s possible to imagine a scenario a few years down the line, though, where Nvidia has deployed countless ever more powerful GPUs, and inspired massive competition such that the world’s supply of GPU power far exceeds demand, driving the marginal costs down to the cost of energy (which hopefully will have become cheaper as well); suddenly the idea of making virtual environments on demand won’t seem so far-fetched, opening up entirely new end-user experiences that explode demand in the way that mobile once did.</p>
<h3>The GPU Age</h3>
<p>The challenge for Nvidia is that this future isn’t particularly investable; indeed, the idea assumes a capacity overhang at some point, which is not great for the stock price! That, though, is how technology advances, and even if a cliff eventually comes, there is a lot of money to be made in the meantime.</p>
<p>That noted, the biggest short-term question I have is around Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang’s insistence that the current wave of demand is in fact the dawn of what he calls accelerated computing; from the <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4630703-nvidia-corp-nvda-q2-2024-earnings-call-transcript">Nvidia earnings call</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  I’m reluctant to guess about the future and so I’ll answer the question from the first principle of computer science perspective. It is recognized for some time now that…using general purpose computing at scale is no longer the best way to go forward. It’s too energy costly, it’s too expensive, and the performance of the applications are too slow. And finally, the world has a new way of doing it. It’s called accelerated computing and what kicked it into turbocharge is generative AI. But accelerated computing could be used for all kinds of different applications that’s already in the data center. And by using it, you offload the CPUs. You save a ton of money in order of magnitude, in cost and order of magnitude and energy and the throughput is higher and that’s what the industry is really responding to.</p>
<p>  Going forward, the best way to invest in the data center is to divert the capital investment from general purpose computing and focus it on generative AI and accelerated computing. Generative AI provides a new way of generating productivity, a new way of generating new services to offer to your customers, and accelerated computing helps you save money and save power. And the number of applications is, well, tons. Lots of developers, lots of applications, lots of libraries. It’s ready to be deployed.</p>
<p>  And so I think the data centers around the world recognize this, that this is the best way to deploy resources, deploy capital going forward for data centers. This is true for the world’s clouds and you’re seeing a whole crop of new GPU-specialized cloud service providers. One of the famous ones is CoreWeave and they’re doing incredibly well. But you’re seeing the regional GPU specialist service providers all over the world now. And it’s because they all recognize the same thing, that the best way to invest their capital going forward is to put it into accelerated computing and generative AI.
</p></blockquote>
<p>My interpretation of Huang’s outlook is that all of these GPUs will be used for a lot of the same activities that are currently run on CPUs; that is certainly a bullish view for Nvidia, because it means the capacity overhang that may come from pursuing generative AI will be back-filled by current cloud computing workloads. And, to be fair, Huang has a point about the power and space limitations of current architectures.</p>
<p>That noted, I’m skeptical: humans — and companies — are lazy, and not only are CPU-based applications easier to develop, they are also mostly already built. I have a hard time seeing what companies are going to go through the time and effort to port things that already run on CPUs to GPUs; at the end of the day, the applications that run in a cloud are determined by customers who provide the demand for cloud resources, not cloud providers looking to optimize FLOP/rack.</p>
<p>If GPUs are going to be as big of a market as Nvidia’s investors hope it will be, it will be because applications that are only possible with GPUs generate the demand to make it so. I’m confident that time will come; what I, nor Huang, nor anyone else can be sure of is when that time will arrive.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>
          Washington D.C.,           Aug. 28, 2023 —
        </p><div><p>The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged Impact Theory, LLC, a media and entertainment company headquartered in Los Angeles, with conducting an unregistered offering of crypto asset securities in the form of purported non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Impact Theory raised approximately $30 million from hundreds of investors, including investors across the United States, through the offering.</p>

<p>According to the SEC’s order, from October to December 2021, Impact Theory offered and sold three tiers of NFTs, known as Founder’s Keys, which Impact Theory called “Legendary,” “Heroic,” and “Relentless.” The order finds that Impact Theory encouraged potential investors to view the purchase of a Founder’s Key as an investment into the business, stating that investors would profit from their purchases if Impact Theory was successful in its efforts. Among other things, Impact Theory emphasized that it was “trying to build the next Disney,” and, if successful, it would deliver “tremendous value” to Founder’s Key purchasers. The order finds that the NFTs offered and sold to investors were investment contracts and therefore securities. Accordingly, Impact Theory violated the federal securities laws by offering and selling these crypto asset securities to the public in an unregistered offering that was not otherwise exempt from registration.</p>

<p>“Absent a valid exemption, offerings of securities, in whatever form, must be registered,” said Antonia Apps, Director of the SEC’s New York Regional Office. “Without registration, investors of all types are deprived of the protections afforded them by the robust disclosures and other safeguards long provided by our securities laws.”</p>

<p>Without admitting or denying the SEC’s findings, Impact Theory agreed to a cease-and-desist order finding that it violated registration provisions of the Securities Act of 1933 and ordering it to pay a combined total of more than $6.1 million in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty. The order also establishes a Fair Fund to return monies that injured investors paid to purchase the NFTs. Impact Theory agreed to destroy all Founder’s Keys in its possession or control, publish notice of the order on its websites and social media channels, and eliminate any royalty that Impact Theory might otherwise receive from future secondary market transactions involving the Founder’s Keys.</p>

<p>The SEC’s investigation was conducted by Benjamin Mishkin, Jessica Quinn, and Judith Weinstock of the SEC’s New York Regional Office. Hane L. Kim of the Division of Examinations, Gwen Licardo, Pamela Sawhney, and Mark R. Sylvester of the Enforcement Division’s Crypto Assets and Cyber Unit (CACU) and Carmen Taveras Alam, Ignacio Franceschelli, and Joshua Mallett of the Division of Economic and Risk Analysis provided assistance. The investigation was supervised by Sheldon Pollock, David Hirsch, and Jorge Tenreiro.&nbsp;</p>

month: check the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=1373">Sourceforge File List</a> to see the current version. The new features of the two most recent SBCL releases are listed below.</p><p>Please see the <a href="https://www.sbcl.org/all-news.html">complete news page</a> for details on all historical SBCL releases.</p><div><h2>New in version 2.3.8, 2023-08-28</h2><p><span><a href="#top">Back to top</a></span></p><ul><li>enhancement: a mark-region parallel garbage collector is available as a
    build-time option; it can be enabled by adding
      `--without-gencgc --with-mark-region-gc`
    to the build command line.  (Thanks to Hayley Patton)
</li><li>enhancement: Stack allocation via DYNAMIC-EXTENT is now possible for
    conditionals even when not all branches are stack-allocatable. Previously
    all branches needed to be stack-allocatable for the otherwise-inaccessible
    subparts to get stack allocated.
</li><li>platform support:
<ul><li>on Mac OS X Sonoma, loading the memory image no longer fails.
       (<a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/sbcl/+bug/2029430">#2029430</a>, reported by cladur)
</li><li>on Darwin, we no longer reimplement nanosleep().
</li><li>on PPC64, undefined function errors now work.
</li><li>on ARM64/OpenBSD, enable the GCC TLS feature. (thanks to Sébastien
       Marie)
</li><li>when building the system, only display a reasonable amount of timing
       precision.  (thanks to Philipp Marek)
</li></ul></li><li>bug fix: handling of inlining functions compiled to return unboxed values
    no longer crashes the compiler.  (<a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/sbcl/+bug/2029020">#2029020</a>, reported by Pascal
    J. Bourguignon)
</li><li>bug fix: the source location for code executed within a top-level
    (EVAL-WHEN (:COMPILE-TOPLEVEL) ...) form is now more useful.
</li><li>bug fix: address a race between user threads cancelling finalizers and the
    finalizer thread executing them.  (<a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/sbcl/+bug/2029306">#2029306</a>)
</li><li>bug fix: complex division returns the same value when evaluated inline and
    out-of-line.  (<a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/sbcl/+bug/2030097">#2030097</a>)
</li><li>bug fix: the pretty-printer no longer deletes syntactically-significant
    whitespace immediately preceding a newline.  (<a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/sbcl/+bug/1985814">#1985814</a>, reported by Mark
    David)
</li><li>optimization: the compiler is more aware of the result type of the
    NUMERATOR function.
</li><li>optimization: EQUAL and EQUALP compile to more efficient code when the two
    arguments are known to be of the same nullable type.
</li><li>optimization: converting bignums to floats uses no intermediate memory.

</li></ul></div><div><h2>New in version 2.3.7, 2023-07-29</h2><p><span><a href="#top">Back to top</a></span></p><ul><li>minor incompatible change: MACROLET macro functions are now compiled with
    (SPEED 1), leading to fewer efficiency notes being emitted when compiled
    in otherwise high-SPEED environments.
</li><li>minor incompatible change: when coalescing list data, the file compiler
    respects substructure equality more accurately, with the side-effect of
    coalescing along CDR chains as well as CARs.  (<a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/sbcl/+bug/2025086">#2025086</a>)
</li><li>minor incompatible change: FUNCTION type declarations for local variables
    generate assertions around their use when called.
</li><li>platform support
<ul><li>on OpenBSD, the regression test suite expectations have been updated.
       (<a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/sbcl/+bug/2026809">#2026809</a>, thanks to Sebastien Marie)
</li><li>on OpenBSD, the data limit is now 1GB.  (<a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/sbcl/+bug/2027536">#2027536</a>, thanks to
       Sebastien Marie)
</li><li>on Darwin with the SB-FUTEX feature, do not use unpaired
       mach_thread_self() syscalls, avoiding resource leaks when creating
       threads.
</li><li>on 64-bit RISCV, add support for some REM-by-multiplication
       optimizations.
</li><li>on Windows, work around a C compiler bug relating to SYSV_ABI.
</li></ul></li><li>bug fix: FILE-POSITION on string output streams no longer crashes or
    causes arbitrary memory overwrites.  (<a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/sbcl/+bug/1839040">#1839040</a>)
</li><li>bug fix: the compiler no longer constant-folds POSITION to NIL if the
    START or END arguments are not valid.
</li><li>optimization: the compiler derives types of &amp;KEY arguments in local calls.
    (<a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/sbcl/+bug/655562">#655562</a>)
</li><li>optimization: type tests of values of known union type can be faster if
    the type being tested for has a non-trivial intersection with the known
    type.
</li><li>optimization: the low-level implementation of NUMBERP, REALP and RATIONALP
    has been improved on x86-64 and arm64.
</li><li>optimization: the compiler removes known-NIL arguments from calls to
    APPEND and NCONC, and empty sequences from calls to CONCATENATE.
</li><li>optimization: checks for symbols being bindable are now memoized, speeding
    up compiled uses of PROGV.
</li><li>optimization: SLOT-VALUE on STRUCTURE-OBJECTs with non-constant slot-name
    argument is faster.

I am a hot-air balloon pilot and I love everything that flies with the lighter-than-air principle.<p>One limitation I could see for your business model is that airships can only be flown in a controlled direction at rather slow wind speeds. That is because they just have such a huge attack surface and the motors have limited thrust.</p><p>Did you do an estimate how many days per year you could fly your vehicle in a given economic area of interest? I fly balloons in Switzerland and I think you can get at most 100 days of good flight conditions a year.

Presumably, the regulations were written before remotely operated or autonomous airships were envisioned, but even so we opted to baseline helium to avoid the risk of a waiver being denied.

There's been multiple cases in the US of people intentionally shooting down drones operating above their property, including in urban areas, and it has not yet been heard by the Supreme Court.  Common Law held that property owners controlled their property from the Earth to the Heavens, which is inclusive of airspace.  The current law in the US says that property owners control their airspace within their "reasonable control".<p>I am not a lawyer, but is is a very open question if you're flying low enough someone can visually sight you and shoot you down over their property, whether or not that this is a violation of the law /for unmanned vehicles/.  Drones in particular have become a serious nuisance and many property owners have taken actions against them in the US triggering court cases, most of which haven't yet reached their conclusion.</p><p>EDIT to add that the rules here even vary by state in the US, in some states you own 83 feet over your property of airspace, in others it could be as much as 400 feet (above 400 feet is controlled airspace under the jurisdiction of the FAA).  Generally speaking, shooting any aircraft, jamming any radio signal, or shining laser pointers on any aircraft is already federally illegal in the US and violates FAA/FCC regulations, but it's not clear that these regulations are actually constitutional and enforceable, or that it cannot be an act of self-defense to shoot down a low-flying aircraft intruding on your property.

I'd assume it introduces more opportunity for leaks, and you have to "oversize" the envelope to stay aloft even after you've used all the fuel necessary for a tour. Is there a situation in which it would make more sense to keep your fuel and H2 separate?</p><p>Small feedback: the rotating text on your homepage transitions just a bit too quickly.

Since the 2000's some researchers or blimp enthusiasts launched research project like this. We're trying to apply it to a strong pain point in the energy industry.<p>Concerning the tradeoffs. It does increase leak potential but the materials and glues are in constant improvements. And, we do not need to oversize the envelope this much because the airship is extremely energy efficient and consume very little energy (during all our flight test we are always amazed when we have 80% left of battery or H2 at the end of the flights). 
But yes, for now, we keep fuel and lighter than air gas separated and we will keep this possibility for a long time.</p><p>Thank you for the feedback!

        <p>LFortran is a modern open-source (BSD licensed) interactive Fortran compiler
built on top of LLVM. It can execute user’s code interactively to allow
exploratory work (much like Python, MATLAB or Julia) as well as compile to
binaries with the goal to run user’s code on modern architectures such as
multi-core CPUs and GPUs.</p>
<p>LFortran is in development (alpha stage), and as of spring 2023 we are able to
compile and run both legacy and modern Minpack, see the following blog post for
more information:

            <h2 id="feature-highlights">Feature Highlights</h2>
<p>LFortran is in development, there are features that work today, and there are
features that are being implemented.</p>
<h2 id="works-today">Works today</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Full Fortran 2018 parser</strong><br>
LFortran can parse any Fortran 2018 syntax to AST (Abstract Syntax Tree)
and format it back as Fortran source code (<code>lfortran fmt</code>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Interactive, Jupyter support</strong><br>
LFortran can be used as a Jupyter kernel, allowing Python/Julia-style rapid
prototyping and an exploratory workflow (<code>conda install jupyter lfortran</code>).
It can also be used from the command-line with an interactive prompt
(REPL).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Clean, modular design, usable as a library</strong><br>
LFortran is structured around two independent modules, AST (Abstract Syntax
Tree) and ASR (Abstract Semantic Representation), both of which are
standalone (completely independent of the rest of LFortran) and users are
encouraged to use them independently for other applications and build tools
on top. See the <a href="https://docs.lfortran.org/design/">Design</a> and
<a href="https://docs.lfortran.org/developer_tutorial/">Developer Tutorial</a> documents for
more details.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Create executables</strong><br>
It can create executables just like other Fortran compilers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Runs on Linux, Mac, Windows and WebAssembly</strong><br>
All four platforms are regularly tested by our CI.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Several backends</strong>
The LLVM can be used to compile to binaries and for interactive usage. The
C++ backend translates Fortran code to a readable C++ code. The x86 backend
allows very fast compilation directly to x86 machine code. The WebAssembly
backend can quickly generate WASM.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="under-development">Under Development</h2>
<p>These features are under development:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Full Fortran 2018 support</strong><br>
The parser can now parse all of Fortran 2018 syntax to AST. A smaller
subset can be transformed into ASR and even smaller subset compiled via
LLVM to machine code. We are now working on extending the subset that
LFortran can fully compile until we reach full Fortran 2018 support.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Support for diverse hardware</strong><br>
LLVM makes it possible to run LFortran on diverse hardware and take
advantage of native Fortran language constructs (such as <code>do concurrent</code>)
on multi-core CPUs and GPUs.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Please vote on issues in our <a href="https://github.com/lfortran/lfortran/issues">issue tracker</a> that you want us to prioritize
(feel free to create new ones if we are missing anything).</p>
