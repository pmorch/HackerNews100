<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <!-- OPENING: THE LUNCH -->
        <p>
          I grabbed lunch with a former Microsoft coworker I've always admired—one of those engineers who can take any idea, even a mediocre one, and immediately find the gold in it. I wanted her take on <a href="https://wanderfugl.com/" target="_blank">Wanderfugl</a> 🐦, the AI-powered map I've been building full-time. I expected encouragement. At worst, overly generous feedback because she knows what I've sacrificed.
        </p>

        <p>
          Instead, she reacted to it with a level of negativity I'd never seen her direct at me before.
        </p>

        <p>
          When I finally got her to explain what was wrong, none of it had anything to do with what I built. She talked about Copilot 365. And Microsoft AI. And every miserable AI tool she's forced to use at work. My product barely featured. Her reaction wasn't about me at all. It was about her entire environment.
        </p>

        <h3>The AI Layoffs</h3>

        <p>
          Her PM had been laid off months earlier. The team asked why. Their director told them it was because the PM org "wasn't effective enough at using Copilot 365."
        </p>

        <p>
          I nervously laughed. This director got up in a group meeting and said that someone lost their job over this?
        </p>

        <p>
          After a pause I tried to share how much better I've been feeling—how AI tools helped me learn faster, how much they accelerated my work on Wanderfugl. I didn't fully grok how tone deaf I was being though. She's drowning in resentment.
        </p>

        <p>
          I left the lunch deflated and weirdly guilty, like building an AI product made me part of the problem.
        </p>

        <p>
          But then I realized this was bigger than one conversation. Every time I shared Wanderfugl with a Seattle engineer, I got the same reflexive, critical, negative response. This wasn't true in Bali, Tokyo, Paris, or San Francisco—people were curious, engaged, wanted to understand what I was building. But in Seattle? Instant hostility the moment they heard "AI."
        </p>

        <h2>The people at big tech in Seattle are not ok</h2>

        <p>
          When I joined Microsoft, there was still a sense of possibility. Satya was pushing "growth mindset" everywhere. Leaders talked about empowerment and breaking down silos. And even though there was always a gap between the slogans and reality, there was room to try things.
        </p>

        <p>
          I leaned into it. I pushed into areas nobody wanted to touch, like Windows update compression, because it lived awkwardly across three teams. Somehow, a 40% improvement made it out alive. Leadership backed it. The people trying to kill it shrank back into their fiefdoms. It felt like the culture wanted change.
        </p>

        <p>
          That world is gone.
        </p>

        <p>
          When the layoff directive hit, every org braced for impact. Anything not strictly inside the org's charter was axed. I went from shipping a major improvement in Windows 11 to having zero projects overnight. I quit shortly after. In hindsight, getting laid off with severance might've been better than watching the culture collapse in slow motion.
        </p>

        <p>
          Then came the AI panic.
        </p>

        <p>
          If you could classify your project as "AI," you were safe and prestigious. If you couldn't, you were nobody. Overnight, most engineers got rebranded as "not AI talent." And then came the final insult: everyone was forced to use Microsoft's AI tools whether they worked or not.
        </p>

        <p>
          Copilot for Word. Copilot for PowerPoint. Copilot for email. Copilot for code. Worse than the tools they replaced. Worse than competitors' tools. Sometimes worse than doing the work manually.
        </p>

        <p>
          But you weren't allowed to fix them—that was the AI org's turf. You were supposed to use them, fail to see productivity gains, and keep quiet.
        </p>

        <p>
          Meanwhile, AI teams became a protected class. Everyone else saw comp stagnate, stock refreshers evaporate, and performance reviews tank. And if your team failed to meet expectations? Clearly you weren't "embracing AI."
        </p>

        <p>
          Bring up AI in a Seattle coffee shop now and people react like you're advocating asbestos.
        </p>

        <p>
          Amazon folks are slightly more insulated, but not by much. The old Seattle deal—Amazon treats you poorly but pays you more—only masks the rot.
        </p>

        <h2>Self-Limiting Beliefs</h2>

        <p>
          This belief system—that AI is useless and that you're not good enough to work on it anyway—hurts three groups:
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>1. The companies.</strong><br>
          They've taught their best engineers that innovation isn't their job.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>2. The engineers.</strong><br>
          They're stuck in resentment and self-doubt while their careers stall.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>3. Anyone trying to build anything new in Seattle.</strong><br>
          Say "AI" and people treat you like a threat or an idiot.
        </p>

        <p>
          And the loop feeds itself:<br>
          Engineers don't try because they think they can't.<br>
          Companies don't empower them because they assume they shouldn't.<br>
          Bad products reinforce the belief that AI is doomed.<br>
          The spiral locks in.
        </p>

        <p>
          My former coworker—the composite of three people for anonymity—now believes she's both unqualified for AI work and that AI isn't worth doing anyway. She's wrong on both counts, but the culture made sure she'd land there.
        </p>

        <p>
          Seattle has talent as good as anywhere. But in San Francisco, people still believe they can change the world—so sometimes they actually do.

            <guid>46138238</guid>
            <pubDate>Wed, 03 Dec 2025 18:40:06 GMT</pubDate>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://mitchellh.com/writing/ghostty-non-profit">https://mitchellh.com/writing/ghostty-non-profit</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46138238">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Ghostty is now <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://ghostty.org/docs/sponsor#relationship-to-hack-club">fiscally sponsored</a> by <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://hackclub.com/">Hack Club</a>, a
registered 501(c)(3) non-profit.</p>
<p>Fiscal sponsorship is a legal and financial
arrangement in which a recognized non-profit extends its tax-exempt status to
a project that aligns with its mission. This allows Ghostty to operate as a
charitable initiative while Hack Club manages compliance, donations,
accounting, and governance oversight.</p>
<p>Being non-profit clearly demonstrates our commitment to keeping Ghostty
free and open source for everyone. It paves the way for a model for sustainable
development beyond my personal involvement. And it also provides important
legal protections and assurances to the people and communities that adopt and
use Ghostty.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="why-a-non-profit">Why a Non-Profit?</h2>
<p>Since the beginning of the project in 2023 and the private beta days of
Ghostty, I've repeatedly expressed my intention that Ghostty legally
become a non-profit. This intention stems from several core beliefs I have.</p>
<p>First, I want to lay bricks for a sustainable future for Ghostty that
doesn't depend on my personal involvement technically or financially.
Financially, I am still the largest donor to the project, and I intend to
remain so, but a non-profit structure allows others to contribute financially
without fear of misappropriation or misuse of funds (as protected by legal
requirements and oversight from the fiscal sponsor).</p>
<p>Second, I want to squelch any possible concerns about a
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exit_scam">"rug pull"</a>.
A non-profit structure provides enforceable assurances: the mission cannot be
quietly changed, funds cannot be diverted to private benefit, and the project
cannot be sold off or repurposed for commercial gain. The structure legally
binds Ghostty to the public-benefit purpose it was created to serve.</p>
<p>Finally, despite being decades-old technology, terminals and terminal-related
technologies remain foundational to modern computing and software
infrastructure. They're often out of the limelight, but they're ever present
on developer machines, embedded in IDEs, visible as read-only consoles for
continuous integration and cloud services, and still one of the primary ways
remote access is done on servers around the world.</p>
<p><strong>I believe infrastructure of this kind should be stewarded by a mission-driven,
non-commercial entity that prioritizes public benefit over private profit.</strong>
That structure increases trust, encourages adoption, and creates the
conditions for Ghostty to grow into a widely used and impactful piece of
open-source infrastructure.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="what-this-means-for-ghostty">What This Means For Ghostty</h2>
<p>From a technical perspective, nothing changes for Ghostty. Our technical
goals for the project remain the same, the license (MIT) remains the same, and
we continue our work towards better Ghostty GUI releases and
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://mitchellh.com/writing/libghostty-is-coming">libghostty</a>.</p>
<p>Financially, Ghostty can now <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://donate.ghostty.org/">accept tax-deductible donations</a> in the United
States. This opens up new avenues for funding the project and sustaining
development over the long term. Most immediately, I'm excited to begin
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://ghostty.org/docs/sponsor#contributor-compensation">compensating contributors</a>,
but I also intend to support upstream dependencies, fund community events,
and pay for boring operational costs.</p>
<p>All our financial transactions will be transparent down to individual
transactions for both inflows and outflows. You can view our public
ledger at <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://hcb.hackclub.com/ghostty">Ghostty's page on Hack Club Bank</a>.
At the time of writing, this is empty, but you'll soon see some initial
funding from me and the beginning of paying for some of our operational
costs.</p>
<p>All applicable names, marks, and intellectual property associated with Ghostty have
been transferred to Hack Club and are now owned under the non-profit
umbrella. Copyright continues to be held by individual contributors under
the continued and existing license structure.</p>
<p>From a leadership perspective, I remain the project lead and final authority
on all decisions, but as stated earlier, the creation of a non-profit structure
lays the groundwork for an eventual future beyond this model.</p>
<div><p><strong>Important note: no funds will be sent to me (Mitchell Hashimoto) or used in any way that
personally benefits me.</strong> Since I'm both the largest donor and lead of this project, this is a
legally guaranteed protection. But also for altruistic reasons, all funds will be directed towards
the needs of the project and its community.</p></div>
<hr>
<h2 id="supporting-hack-club">Supporting Hack Club</h2>
<p>As our fiscal sponsor, Hack Club provides essential services to Ghostty,
including accounting, legal compliance, and governance oversight. To support
this, 7% of all donations to Ghostty go to Hack Club to cover these costs
in addition to supporting their broader mission of empowering young people
around the world interested in technology and coding.</p>
<p>In the words of Zach Latta, Hack Club's founder and executive director
this is a "good-for-good" trade. Instead of donor fees going to a for-profit
management company or covering pure overhead of a single project, the fees
go to another non-profit doing important work in the tech community and
the overhead is amortized across many projects.</p>
<p>In addition to the 7% fees, <strong>my family is personally donating $150,000
directly to the Hack Club project</strong><sup><a href="#user-content-fn-1" id="user-content-fnref-1" data-footnote-ref="true" aria-describedby="footnote-label">1</a></sup> (not to Ghostty within it). Hack Club
does amazing work and I would've supported them regardless of their
fiscal sponsorship of Ghostty, but I wanted to pair these two things
together to amplify the impact of both.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="donate">Donate</h2>
<p>Please consider donating to support Ghostty's continued development.</p>
<p>I recognize that Ghostty is already in an abnormally fortunate position
to have myself as a backer, but I do envision a future where Ghostty is
more equally supported by a broader community. And with our new structure,
you can be assured about the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://ghostty.org/docs/sponsor#usage-of-funds">usage of your funds</a>
towards public-benefit goals.</p>
<p>This post isn't meant to directly be a <a href="https://mitchellh.com/writing/advice-for-tech-nonprofits">fundraising pitch</a>
so it is purposely lacking critical details about our funding goals, budget,
project goals, project metrics, etc. I'll work on those in the future.
In the mean time, if you're interested in talking more about supporting
Ghostty, please email me at <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="mailto:m@mitchellh.com">m@mitchellh.com</a>.</p>

<hr>
<h2 id="thank-you">Thank You</h2>
<p>I'm thankful for Hack Club and their team for working with us to make this
happen. I'm also thankful for the Ghostty community who has supported this
project and has trusted me and continues to trust me to steward it responsibly.</p>

    <p>Update: This post received a large amount of attention on Hacker News <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46137514" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">— see the discussion thread</a>.</p>

<p><em>Timeline &amp; Responsible Disclosure</em></p>

<p><em><strong>Initial Contact:</strong> Upon discovering this vulnerability on <strong>October 27, 2025</strong>, I immediately reached out to Filevine’s security team via email.</em></p>

<p><em><strong>November 4, 2025:</strong> Filevine’s security team thanked me for the writeup and confirmed they would review the vulnerability and fix it quickly.</em></p>

<p><em><strong>November 20, 2025:</strong> I followed up to confirm the patch was in place from my end, and informed them of my intention to write a technical blog post.</em></p>

<p><em><strong>November 21, 2025:</strong> Filevine confirmed the issue was resolved and thanked me for responsibly reporting it.</em></p>

<p><em><strong>Publication:</strong> December 3, 2025.</em></p>

<p><em>The Filevine team was responsive, professional, and took the findings seriously throughout the disclosure process. They acknowledged the severity, worked to remediate the issues, allowed responsible disclosure, and maintained clear communication. This is another great example of how organizations should handle security disclosures.</em></p>

<hr>

<p>AI legal-tech companies are exploding in value, and Filevine, now valued at <strong>over a billion dollars</strong>, is one of the fastest-growing platforms in the space. Law firms feed tools like this enormous amounts of <strong>highly confidential information</strong>.</p>

<p>Because I’d recently been working with <a href="https://news.yale.edu/2024/03/25/ais-legal-revolution">Yale Law School on a related project</a>, I decided to take a closer look at how Filevine handles data security. What I discovered should concern every legal professional using AI systems today.</p>

<p>When I first navigated to the site to see how it worked, it seemed that I needed to be part of a law firm to actually play around with the tooling, or request an official demo. However, I know that companies often have a demo environment that is open, so I used a technique called subdomain enumeration (which I had first heard about in <a href="https://www.wiz.io/blog/wiz-research-uncovers-exposed-deepseek-database-leak">Gal Nagli’s article</a> last year) to see if there was a demo environment. I found something much more interesting instead.</p>

<p>I saw a subdomain called <a href="http://margolis.filevine.com/">margolis.filevine.com</a>. When I navigated to that site, I was greeted with a loading page that never resolved:</p>

<p><img src="https://alexschapiro.com/assets/images/filevine-security/loading.png" alt="Loading page screenshot placeholder"></p>

<p>I wanted to see what was actually loading, so I opened Chrome’s developer tools, but saw <strong>no Fetch/XHR requests</strong> (the request you often expect to see if a page is loading data). Then, I decided to dig through some of the Javascript files to see if I could figure out what was <em>supposed</em> to be happening. I saw a snippet in a JS file like <code>POST await fetch(${BOX_SERVICE}/recommend)</code>. This piqued my interest – recommend what? And what is the BOX_SERVICE? That variable was not defined in the JS file the fetch would be called from, but (after looking through minified code, which SUCKS to do) I found it in another one: “<a href="http://dxxxxxx9.execute-api.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/prod">dxxxxxx9.execute-api.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/prod</a>”. Now I had a <strong>new endpoint to test</strong>, I just had to figure out the correct payload structure to it. After looking at more minified js to determine the correct structure for this endpoint, I was able to construct a working payload to /prod/recommend:</p>

<div><pre><code>{"projectName":"Very sensitive Project"}
</code></pre></div>

<p>(the name could be anything of course). <strong>No authorization tokens needed</strong>, and I was greeted with the response:</p>

<p><img src="https://alexschapiro.com/assets/images/filevine-security/response.png" alt="Response screenshot placeholder"></p>

<p>At first I didn’t entirely understand the impact of what I saw. No matter the name of the project I passed in, I was recommended the same boxFolders and couldn’t seem to access any files. Then, not realizing I stumbled upon something <strong>massive</strong>, I turned my attention to the <code>boxToken</code> in the response.</p>

<p>After reading some documentation on the Box Api, I realized this was a <strong>maximum access fully scoped admin token</strong> to the <strong>entire Box filesystem</strong> (like an internal shared Google Drive) of this law firm. This includes <strong>all confidential files, logs, user information, etc.</strong> Once I was able to prove this had an impact (by searching for “confidential” and getting <strong>nearly 100k results</strong> back)</p>

<p><img src="https://alexschapiro.com/assets/images/filevine-security/search-results.png" alt="Search results placeholder"></p>

<p>I <strong>immediately stopped testing</strong> and responsibly disclosed this to Filevine. They responded quickly and professionally and remediated this issue.</p>

<p>If someone had malicious intent, they would have been able to extract <strong>every single file</strong> used by Margolis lawyers – countless data protected by <strong>HIPAA</strong> and other legal standards, internal memos/payrolls, literally <strong>millions of the most sensitive documents</strong> this law firm has in their possession. <strong>Documents protected by court orders!</strong> This could have been a real nightmare for both the law firm and the clients whose data would have been exposed.</p>

<p>To companies who feel pressure to rush into the AI craze in their industry – <strong>be careful!</strong> Always ensure the companies you are giving your most sensitive information to <strong>secure that data</strong>.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>For over a decade, Steam company Valve’s biggest goal has been bringing Windows games to Linux. While that goal is almost complete with the massive success of Proton compatibility on Steam Deck and <a href="https://frvr.com/blog/news/valve-says-its-upcoming-steam-machine-will-be-priced-like-a-pc-not-like-a-console/">the upcoming Steam Machine</a>, the company has also been secretly pushing to bring Windows games to ARM devices.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/report/820656/valve-interview-arm-gaming-steamos-pierre-loup-griffais">The Verge</a>, Steam Deck and SteamOS lead Pierre-Loup Griffais revealed that Valve has been secretly funding Fex, an open-source project to bring Windows games to ARM, for almost a decade.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“In 2016, 2017, there was always an idea we would end up wanting to do that,” the SteamOS lead said, and that’s when the Fex compatibility layer was started, because we knew there was close to a decade of work needed before it would be robust enough people could rely on it for their libraries. There’s a lot of work that went into that.”</p>



<figure><blockquote><p>“We’re pretty excited to be able to expand PC gaming to include all those options”</p><cite>Pierre-Loup Griffais on Valve’s funding of ARM compatibility layers</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>Griffais explained that the project pushes to “reduce barriers for users not having to worry about what games run”. With Windows games running on ARM, a large number of Steam games are able to run on a significant number of additional devices including low-power laptops, tablets and even phones (hopefully) without issue.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While Griffais didn’t confirm specific devices that Valve is working on, the SteamOS lead explained that they’re “excited” about creating potential ARM-based devices.&nbsp;“I think that it paves the way for a bunch of different, maybe ultraportables, maybe more powerful laptops being ARM-based and using different offerings in that segment,” he said. “Handhelds, there’s a lot of potential for ARM, of course, and one might see desktop chips as well at some point in the ARM world.”</p>



<p>But why ARM? The Steam Deck lead explained that the hardware offers more efficiency at lower power compared to other options. While the current hardware in the Steam Deck and other handhelds can run at low-wattage, they’re simply less efficient at lower-power than hardware designed specifically to run at that spec.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“There’s a lot of price points and power consumption points where Arm-based chipsets are doing a better job of serving the market,” they said.&nbsp; “When you get into lower power, anything lower than Steam Deck, I think you’ll find that there’s an ARM chip that maybe is competitive with x86 offerings in that segment.”</p>



<p>“We’re pretty excited to be able to expand PC gaming to include all those options instead of being arbitrarily restricted to a subset of the market,” they continued.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Valve is currently working on an ARM version of SteamOS using “the same exact OS components, the same exact Arch Linux base, all the same updater, all the same technologies,” Griffais said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“When&nbsp; you’re looking at SteamOS on Arm, you’re really looking at the same thing,” he continued. “Instead of downloading the normal Proton that’s built for x86 and targets x86 games, it will also be able to download a Proton that’s Arm-aware, that has a bulk of its code compiled for Arm and can also include the Fex emulator.”</p>



<p>All of this is to give players a choice. While Windows games are built for Windows, they don’t necessarily need to be played on Windows. Valve has already proven how effective this can be with some games Windows running via Proton performing better due to the lack of Windows bloat.&nbsp;</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Nevertheless, there are issues. Some games have compatibility problems out of the box, and modern multiplayer games with anti-cheat simply do not work through a translation layer, <a href="https://frvr.com/blog/news/valve-says-steam-machine-success-will-help-to-push-devs-to-properly-support-anti-cheat-on-linux/">something Valve hopes will change in the future</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s all fantastic work though, and it gives players a chance to break away from Windows without losing much, if anything, when shifting ecosystems. For decades, Windows has dominated the PC space, and it likely still will for a long while, but now there’s actually space for alternatives to grow.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We’ve already seen massive adoption of SteamOS via the Steam Deck, but with <a href="https://frvr.com/blog/steamos-alternative-bazzite-smashes-records-to-deliver-over-a-petabyte-of-isos-in-just-one-month/">Bazzite now shifting petabytes of ISOs every month</a>, there’s definitely an urge to move away from Windows, at least on the handheld side.&nbsp;</p>

Assigned CVE-2025-55182 (React) and CVE-2025-66478 (Next.js), this flaw allows for unauthenticated remote code execution (RCE) on the server due to insecure deserialization. The vulnerability exists in the default configuration of affected applications, meaning standard deployments are immediately at risk. Due to the high severity and the ease of exploitation, immediate patching is required.</p><p>To maintain ecosystem safety while patches are applied, we are currently withholding specific details; the details provided here are intended solely to assist defenders in prioritizing remediation and understanding the risk. We will be updating this blog with additional information as it comes to light.</p><h2><a id="what-are-cve-2025-55182-and-cve-2025-66478-6"></a><strong>What are CVE-2025-55182 and CVE-2025-66478?</strong></h2><p><strong>CVE-2025-55182</strong> is a critical unauthenticated remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability in the <code>react-server</code> package used by React Server Components (RSC).</p><p><strong>CVE-2025-66478</strong> is the corresponding RCE vulnerability in Next.js, which inherits the same underlying flaw through its implementation of the RSC “Flight” protocol.</p><p>The vulnerability fundamentally resides in the react-server package and its handling of the RSC "Flight" protocol. It is characterized as a logical deserialization vulnerability where the server processes RSC payloads in an unsafe manner. When a server receives a specially crafted, malformed payload, it fails to validate the structure correctly. This allows attacker-controlled data to influence server-side execution logic, resulting in the execution of privileged JavaScript code.</p><p>In our experimentation, exploitation of this vulnerability had high fidelity, with a near 100% success rate and can be leveraged to a full remote code execution. The attack vector is unauthenticated and remote, requiring only a specially crafted HTTP request to the target server. It affects the default configuration of popular frameworks.</p><h2><a id="wiz-research-data-whats-the-risk-to-cloud-environments-11"></a><strong>Wiz Research data: what’s the risk to cloud environments?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>According to Wiz data, 39% of cloud environments have instances vulnerable to CVE-2025-55182 and/or CVE-2025-66478.</p><h2><a id="which-products-are-affected-13"></a><strong>Which products are affected?</strong></h2><div><table><thead><tr><th>Vulnerable product</th><th>Patched release</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><span>React: 19.0, 19.1, 19.2</span></td><td><span>19.0.1, 19.1.2, and 19.2.1</span></td></tr><tr><td><span>Next.js: 14.3.0-canary, 15.x,   and 16.x (App Router)</span></td><td><span> 14.3.0-canary.88, 15.0.5, 15.1.9, 15.2.6, 15.3.6,   15.4.8, 15.5.7, 16.0.7</span></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>Any framework or library bundling the react-server implementation is likely affected.

Like Dr. Frankenstein, we assembled it piece by piece - Medicare for the elderly, insurance through jobs, Medicaid for the poor, exchanges for everyone else. Each piece solved a specific problem. Each addition made sense in isolation.</p><p>Put them together and you get something alive. Something vast. Something no one would have designed from scratch - because we never agreed on what we were designing.</p><p>The flows in the diagram represent $4.9 Trillion - but they also trace every medical decision made in America last year. Every dose administered and every diagnosis delivered. Every ambulance ride and every rehabilitation. Every birth and every final goodbye.</p><p>The flows are the aggregate infrastructure of how we keep people alive and healthy - and also, the accumulated friction that makes it harder to stay that way.</p><p>This chart holds the confused senior on dialysis, lost between three different insurances. The branch has a brilliant researcher, waiting for approval to start her life-saving trial. Lost in the flow is a desperate parent calling six numbers to pray for one “in-network” specialist. The ends show a struggling hospital with a whole floor for billing - and a closet for social work.</p><p><span>Every flow in the diagram is someone’s life intersecting with the creature we created. </span><strong>And every flow is also a choice about obligation.</strong><span> </span><em>Who do we owe care to? What do we owe and how much?</em></p><p><span>The question that comes up for this creation: </span><em>What did we build and why?</em></p><p>Other wealthy nations finance healthcare too. They also have to balance costs, quality, and access. They also have powerful stakeholders fighting over money and control. But their diagrams don’t look like ours. To understand what we built - and why - we need to see what a coherent system looks like first.</p><p><span>Look, I’m not an international healthcare policy expert. But I went down a research rabbit hole reading </span><em>Which Country Has the World’s Best Health Care?</em><span> by Ezekiel Emanuel (my favorite of the legendary </span><a href="https://www.npr.org/2013/03/24/174735421/love-roughhousing-and-fifth-position-in-brothers-emanuel" rel="">Emanuel brothers</a><span>), and made some diagrams to understand what other countries actually built.</span></p><p>Not to propose we copy them - that ship sailed decades ago. But to see what it looks like when a country chooses a philosophy and then builds the body. Two examples: the UK’s Beveridge model (named after Lord Beveridge, not a beverage model from tacky 90s beer commercials), and Germany’s Bismarck model.</p><p>The obvious place to start is the UK’s NHS - the prime example of a single-payer health system. But before we get to how it works, we need to understand the choice that made it possible.</p><p>Lord Beveridge published his report in 1942, in the middle of World War II. Britain was being bombed nightly. Citizens were already sacrificing everything for collective survival. And Beveridge asked: if we’re asking people to die for each other, shouldn’t we also keep each other alive? Healthcare as a right, funded through taxes, free at point of service - a popular position around moral framing. Shortly after the war, the National Health Service launched in 1948 to match it.</p><p>Of the £317 billion ($400B USD) of UK healthcare spend, 81% comes from general taxation - one payer for nearly everything.

Politically, we’d need to agree that healthcare is a right we owe each other, funded collectively through taxes. That would mean massive tax increases, eliminating private insurance as the primary system, and trusting a single federal agency.</p><p>The operational resistance alone would be too much: I’ve watched hospital execs squeeze out thinning margins and payer executives navigate quarterly earnings calls.

That’s what happens when the obligation to cover everyone is non-negotiable.</p><p>Americans might actually like health insurers functioning as utilities, not profit-maximizing businesses. But federal price-setting across 50 states means telling every hospital and physician what they can charge - and CMS already struggles with Medicare rates alone.</p><p>The lobbying alone would be apocalyptic.

But like all other self-centered Americans, my focus is on talking about the US Healthcare System.</span></p><p>We can learn a lot from two distinct namesake models: the Bismarck model is “social insurance” and the Beveridge model is a “universal right”. The UK and Germany made different choices and built different systems: the UK moves money from taxpayers → NHS → services, Germany from employers + employees → sickness funds → services. But both embody their stated values.</p><p>So what does the US value? We built something that costs everyone, everything, everywhere - and still leaves 27 million uninsured.</p><p><span>The outcome is $4.9T - which would make it the 3rd largest economy in the world, a high 8% admin costs - compared to the UK’s 2% admin, with medical bankruptcy still possible. </span><strong>We’ve never agreed on what we value</strong><span>. So we built a system that embodies our disagreement: employer-based coverage (market choice) plus Medicare (social insurance) plus Medicaid (safety net) plus exchanges (regulated markets).</span></p><p>Maybe that IS the American philosophy: pluralism so deep we can’t even agree on how to keep each other alive.</p><p><span>My fear with the diagram is that it just becomes gratuitous complication-porn.

You can’t “just expand Medicare” - Medicare is already funded by four different sources. You can’t “just cut insurance middlemen” - employer plans flow $1T+ to care. Every fix redirects one river while missing the ecosystem.</p><p>The UK built a system that moves money from taxpayers to services.

Actually taking away parts? That’s choosing who loses coverage, whose job disappears, which hospital closes.</p><p>The chart isn’t simply dollars flowing through programs - it tells a story of how we support each other. Whether money goes to your trusted doctor, to hospitals that save you when you’re gravely ill, to nursing homes where our elders age with dignity, to invest in programs that keep our children - and our futures - healthy.</p><p>This is American ambivalence about what we owe each other.

This diagram reveals our hidden disorder - or perhaps, a different kind of order than we admitted we were building. The question isn’t whether this creature is beautiful or monstrous.</span></p><p>The question is: now that we see what we made, what do we want to do about it?</p></div></article></div><div id="discussion"><h4>Discussion about this post</h4></div></div>]]></description>

<p id="3f2549c1-b62e-4051-8cf8-752524a0ecdd">It's no surprise to see modern AAA games occupying hundreds of gigabytes of storage these days, especially if you are gaming on a PC. But somehow, Arrowhead Game Studios, the developers behind the popular co-op shooter <em>Helldivers 2</em>, have managed to substantially cut the game’s size by 85%.</p><p>As per a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/553850/view/491583942944621371" target="_blank" data-url="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/553850/view/491583942944621371" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link">recent post on Steam</a>, this reduction was made possible with support from Nixxes Software, best known for developing high-quality PC ports of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tag/sony" data-auto-tag-linker="true" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomshardware.com/tag/sony">Sony</a>’s biggest PlayStation titles. The developers were able to achieve this by de-duplicating game data, which resulted in bringing the size down from ~154GB to just ~23GB, saving a massive ~131GB of storage space.</p><p id="3f2549c1-b62e-4051-8cf8-752524a0ecdd-2">Originally, the game’s large install size was attributed to optimization for mechanical hard drives since duplicating data is used to reduce loading times on older storage media. However, it turns out that Arrowhead’s estimates for load times on HDDs, based on industry data, were incorrect.</p><p>With their latest data measurements specific to the game, the developers have confirmed the small number of players (11% last week) using mechanical hard drives will witness mission load times increase by only a few seconds in worst cases. Additionally, the post reads, “the majority of the loading time in <em>Helldivers 2</em> is due to level-generation rather than asset loading. This level generation happens in parallel with loading assets from the disk and so is the main determining factor of the loading time.”</p><a href="https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqLAgKIiZDQklTRmdnTWFoSUtFSFJ2YlhOb1lYSmtkMkZ5WlM1amIyMG9BQVAB" id="c9748c52-792e-4aa9-b55b-1340711c004d" data-url="https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqLAgKIiZDQklTRmdnTWFoSUtFSFJ2YlhOb1lYSmtkMkZ5WlM1amIyMG9BQVAB" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"><figure data-bordeaux-image-check=""><div><p> <picture data-new-v2-image="true">

        <p>Written by me, proof-read by an LLM.
<br>Details at end.</p>
<p>Sometimes you’ll step through code in a debugger and find a complex-looking loop… that executes as a single instruction. The compiler saw through the obfuscation and generated the obvious code anyway.</p>
<p>Consider this assortment of highly questionable unsigned addition routines<sup id="fnref:greg"><a href="#fn:greg">1</a></sup> - for variety, here compiled for ARM (unlike <a href="https://xania.org/202512/02-adding-integers">yesterday’s addition example</a>).</p>


<p>Despite these all being very different ways of returning <code>x + y</code>, the compiler sees through it all and recognises that it’s just a single <code>add w0, w1, w0</code><sup id="fnref:arm"><a href="#fn:arm">2</a></sup> instruction. Even the recursive <code>add_v4</code> - which calls itself - gets optimised down to the same single instruction<sup id="fnref:tco"><a href="#fn:tco">3</a></sup>.</p>
<p>The compiler’s ability to recognise patterns and replace them with efficient alternatives - even when the code is pretty obfuscated - is a superpower. It lets programmers choose <em>how</em> to write their code that’s intention-revealing (not like these contrived examples, obviously!) and leave the code generation up to the compiler, knowing that most of the time it’ll do the right thing.</p>
<p>So how does the compiler spot these patterns? Is it maintaining a database of “silly ways to add numbers”? Not quite. Internally, it translates your code into an intermediate representation - a simplified, abstract form that’s easier to analyse. When the compiler sees the while loop in <code>add_v3</code>, it transforms it into something like “increment y by x, then return y”, which it then recognises as mathematically equivalent to “return x + y”. This process of converting different code patterns into a standard, canonical form is what lets the compiler treat them all identically. By the time code generation happens, all four functions look the same to the optimiser<sup id="fnref:opt"><a href="#fn:opt">4</a></sup>.</p>
<p>This pattern recognition is remarkably robust - the compiler will happily optimise code you’d never want to write in the first place. Throughout this series we’ll see how far this canonicalisation can take us.</p>

The show's first four seasons were shot on film, and the final three were shot digitally on the Alexa, but the run of the series was mastered in 1080p HD. HBO Max has been touting this 4K "restoration" of the series, produced by Lionsgate TV.&nbsp;</p><p>The highly anticipated 4K debut of the show was to be one of HBO Max' crown jewels of television history. It looks like it might initially serve as a cautionary tale of quality control when it comes to restorations and the technical process of bringing shows to streaming.</p><p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgaDR20BxvrQ5K1i2Bs6Qsi5svxrEqYarGMWqKZGzWQLsAsQt3VBnMawSwfop5mN6v26kwOVjB9I2BX9uO9EkTVChj2oEslqiUR1Q_BrCPU1oSIRKXKbkCmFC0Hs4yZ5KPo-6zFqt5Bx524J_8AG5e-sFhSK4maCfBWqYDJff79L5Gx2rmudPo/s1192/Screenshot%202025-12-02%20at%203.00.16%E2%80%AFPM.png"><img data-original-height="1014" data-original-width="1192" height="340" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgaDR20BxvrQ5K1i2Bs6Qsi5svxrEqYarGMWqKZGzWQLsAsQt3VBnMawSwfop5mN6v26kwOVjB9I2BX9uO9EkTVChj2oEslqiUR1Q_BrCPU1oSIRKXKbkCmFC0Hs4yZ5KPo-6zFqt5Bx524J_8AG5e-sFhSK4maCfBWqYDJff79L5Gx2rmudPo/w400-h340/Screenshot%202025-12-02%20at%203.00.16%E2%80%AFPM.png" width="400"></a></p><p>As far as I can tell, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/paulhaine.bsky.social/post/3m6ytn4qmyc2r">Paul Haine was the first to notice something weird</a> going on with HBO Max' presentation. In one of season one's most memorable moments, Roger Sterling barfs in front of clients after climbing many flights of stairs. As a surprise to Paul, you can clearly see the pretend puke hose (that is ultimately strapped to the back side of John Slattery's face) in the background, along with two techs who are modulating the flow. Yeah, you're not supposed to see that.</p><p>It appears as though this represents the original photography, unaltered before digital visual effects got involved. Somehow, this episode (along with many others) do not include all the digital visual effects that were in the original broadcasts and home video releases. It's a bizarro mistake for Lionsgate and HBO Max to make and not discover until after the show was streaming to customers.</p><p>• &nbsp; • &nbsp; • &nbsp; • &nbsp; •</p><p>I want to be clear that this is a separate issue than the "reframed original film negative for 16:9" issue that has plagued many restorations that have left viewers scratching their heads. In those cases, the shows were originally shot on film and presented in 1.33-to-1 aspect ratio, but for their HD restorations the studio decided that their shows should fill the HD frame at the 16:9 aspect ratio, so portions of the negative, previously unseen and NOT intended for broadcast, were now suddenly visible, <a href="https://x.com/tvaziri/status/1660026580343865344?s=20">sometimes leading to ridiculous images that were never meant to be seen by audiences</a>...</p><p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhhggBGHEwG8TogixXEcaDTgl1mv7YAmBQmKf6tp-9M0Q8SO37INI5CjXBn8Dyaf4s5O8Ds4PP3wwT3QunIIK_XvMYSO8huGfjzPgGMJna5WKoQxvXAzxqYSh99naYj4JRLh0u9kk4BsTvlZdIXCqK7G2hQfuljyqI8gqcsrKHz35xDVbj6mS8/s2638/FwmY7L0akAIv1ro.jpeg"><img data-original-height="1496" data-original-width="2638" height="226" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhhggBGHEwG8TogixXEcaDTgl1mv7YAmBQmKf6tp-9M0Q8SO37INI5CjXBn8Dyaf4s5O8Ds4PP3wwT3QunIIK_XvMYSO8huGfjzPgGMJna5WKoQxvXAzxqYSh99naYj4JRLh0u9kk4BsTvlZdIXCqK7G2hQfuljyqI8gqcsrKHz35xDVbj6mS8/w400-h226/FwmY7L0akAIv1ro.jpeg" width="400"></a></p><p><i><span>example from "Friends" in HD, look at screen right</span></i></p><p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgrGOjCgv_d3lbN36o1E74ruWVsOuUukIaID_8Kgp2WiI_MpgxUZutoMjILeumoqhvxvsaDE761JScxM52sBYXli7oGtYRvNkt0lTxe5eLn3okO9r5yzV4cBnSXx6miJxoMlZ3Ru4kjUQ__z-GCLTnnkAVkd6qHvhXXwReUP_QuVshU7YfrUJE/s1024/pothole.gif"><img data-original-height="768" data-original-width="1024" height="300" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgrGOjCgv_d3lbN36o1E74ruWVsOuUukIaID_8Kgp2WiI_MpgxUZutoMjILeumoqhvxvsaDE761JScxM52sBYXli7oGtYRvNkt0lTxe5eLn3okO9r5yzV4cBnSXx6miJxoMlZ3Ru4kjUQ__z-GCLTnnkAVkd6qHvhXXwReUP_QuVshU7YfrUJE/w400-h300/pothole.gif" width="400"></a></p><p><i><span>example from "Seinfeld" in HD</span></i></p><p>Reframing old shows to fit a new aspect ratio is antithetical to the spirit of media restoration, and cheapens the future of our shared culture.

    <div>
        <p>I keep hearing the AI datacentre boom compared to the 2000s telecoms crash. The parallels seem obvious - billions in infrastructure spending, concerns about overbuilding, warnings of an imminent bubble. But when I actually ran the numbers, the fundamentals look completely different.</p>
<p>I'm not here to predict whether there will or won't be a crash or correction. I just want to look at whether the comparison to telecoms actually holds up when you examine the history in a bit more detail.</p>
<h2>What Actually Happened in the Telecoms Crash</h2>
<p>Let me start with what the 2000s telecoms crash actually looked like, because the details matter. Firstly, there was massive capex - between 1995 and 2000 somewhere like <a href="https://ideas.ted.com/an-eye-opening-look-at-the-dot-com-bubble-of-2000-and-how-it-shapes-our-lives-today/">$2 trillion was spent laying 80-90 million miles of fiber</a>. Inflation adjusted, this is over $4trillion, or close to <strong>$1trillion/year</strong> in 2025 dollars.</p>
<p>By 2002 only <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB1032982764442483713">2.7% of this fibre was used</a>.</p>
<p>How did this happen? A catastrophic supply and demand miscalculation past the pure securities fraud involved in many of the companies. Telecom CEOs <a href="https://ideas.ted.com/an-eye-opening-look-at-the-dot-com-bubble-of-2000-and-how-it-shapes-our-lives-today/">claimed</a> internet traffic was doubling every 3-4 months.</p>
<p>But in reality, <a href="https://www-users.cse.umn.edu/~odlyzko/doc/oft.internet.growth.pdf">traffic was doubling roughly every 12 months</a>. That's a <strong>4x overestimate</strong> of demand growth, which compounds each year. This false assumption drove massive debt-financed overbuilding. If you overestimate 4x a year for 3 years, by the end of your scenario you are 256x out.</p>
<p><em>Even worse</em> for these companies, enormous strides were made on the optical transceivers, allowing the same fibre to carry 100,000x more traffic over the following decade. Just one example is WDM multiplexing, allowing multiple carriers to be multiplexed on the same physical fibre line. In 1995 state of the art was 4-8 carriers. By 2000, it was 128. This <em>alone</em> allowed a 64x increase in capacity with the same infrastructure. Combined with improvements in modulation techniques, error correction, and the bits per second each carrier could handle, the same physical fibre became exponentially more capable.</p>
<p>The key dynamic: supply improvements were exponential while demand was merely linear. While some physical infrastructure needed to be built, there was enormous overbuilding that could mostly be serviced by technology improvements on the same infrastructure.</p>
<h2>AI Infrastructure: A Different Story</h2>
<p>Unlike fibre optics in the 1990s, GPU performance per watt improvements are actually slowing down:</p>
<p><strong>2015-2020 Period:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Performance per watt improved significantly with major architectural changes</li>
<li>Process nodes jumped from ~20nm to 7nm (major efficiency gains)</li>
<li>Introduction of Tensor Cores and specialized AI hardware</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2020-2025 Period:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://epoch.ai/data-insights/ml-hardware-energy-efficiency">ML hardware energy efficiency improves ~40% annually</a></li>
<li>Performance per watt improvements slowing compared to previous era</li>
<li>Process nodes: improvements slowed dramatically with EUV being a requirement at sub 5nm wavelengths.</li>
</ul>
<p>More tellingly, <a href="https://www.tweaktown.com/news/97059/nvidias-full-spec-blackwell-b200-ai-gpu-uses-1200w-of-power-up-from-700w-on-hopper-h100/index.html">GPU TDPs (power consumption) are rising dramatically</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>V100 (2017): 300W</li>
<li>A100 (2020): 400W</li>
<li>H100 (2022): 700W</li>
<li>B200 (2024): 1000-1200W</li>
</ul>
<p>This is the opposite of what happened in telecoms. We're not seeing exponential efficiency gains that make existing infrastructure obsolete. Instead, we're seeing semiconductor physics hitting fundamental limits.</p>
<p>The B200 from NVidia also requires liquid cooling - which means most datacentres designed for air cooling need to be completely retrofitted.</p>
<h3>Demand Growth Is Actually Accelerating</h3>
<p>The telecoms crash happened partly because demand was overestimated by 4x. What does AI demand growth look like?</p>
<p><strong>Traditional LLM Usage:</strong> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/21/chatgpt-users-send-2-5-billion-prompts-a-day/">ChatGPT averages 20+ prompts per user per day</a>. Extended conversations can reach 3,000-4,000 tokens cumulative, though many users treat it like Google - short "searches" with no follow-up, consuming surprisingly few tokens.</p>
<p><strong>Agent Usage (<a href="https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/multi-agent-research-system">Anthropic research</a>):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Basic agents: <strong>4x more tokens</strong> than chat</li>
<li>Multi-agent systems: <strong>15x more tokens</strong> than chat</li>
<li>Coding agents: <strong>150,000+ tokens per session</strong> (multiple sessions daily)</li>
</ul>
<p>We're looking at a fundamentally different demand curve - if anything, people are underestimating how much agents will consume. The shift from chat to agents represents a 10x-100x increase in token consumption per user.</p>
<p>We're not even there yet, and infrastructure is already maxed out, with AI infrastructure running at very high utilization rates. Major providers still experience peak-time capacity issues. The problem isn't unused infrastructure sitting idle; it's infrastructure struggling to meet current demand. One major hyperscaler told me they <em>still</em> have capacity issues at peak times causing free tier users to have high error rates.</p>
<h3>Datacenter CapEx: Evolution, Not Revolution</h3>
<p>Another important piece of context that gets missed:</p>
<p><strong>Pre-AI Growth (2018-2021):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Combined Amazon/Microsoft/Google capex: <a href="https://platformonomics.com/2019/02/follow-the-capex-cloud-table-stakes-2018-edition/">$68B (2018)</a> → <a href="https://platformonomics.com/2022/02/follow-the-capex-cloud-table-stakes-2021-retrospective/">$124B (2021)</a></li>
<li>81% growth over 3 years</li>
<li>Annual growth rate: <strong>~22%</strong></li>
<li>Driven by cloud migration, pandemic acceleration, streaming</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>AI Boom (2023-2025):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>2023: $127B</li>
<li>2024: <a href="https://platformonomics.com/2025/02/follow-the-capex-cloud-table-stakes-2024-retrospective/">$212B</a> (<strong>67% growth</strong> year-over-year)</li>
<li>2025 projected: <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/08/tech-megacaps-to-spend-more-than-300-billion-in-2025-to-win-in-ai.html">$255B+</a> (Amazon $100B, Microsoft $80B, Alphabet $75B)</li>
</ul>
<p>While it's no doubt a huge amount of capex going into this rollout; it's not quite as dramatic as some news stories make out. I have no doubt that now any datacentre related capex is being rebranded as "AI", even if it's just 'boring' old compute, storage and network not being directly used for AI.</p>
<h2>Why Forecasting Is Nearly Impossible</h2>
<p>Here's where I think the comparison to telecoms becomes both interesting and concerning.</p>
<p><strong>The Lead Time Problem:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Datacenters take 2-3 years to build</li>
<li>GPU orders have 6-12 month lead times</li>
<li>Can't adjust capacity in real-time to match demand</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Prisoner's Dilemma:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Underestimating demand = terrible user experience + losing to competitors</li>
<li>Overestimating demand = billions in wasted capex (that might just get used slower)</li>
<li>Given the choice, rational players overbuild - because wasting some capex is infinitely better than losing the "AI wars"</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Forecasting Challenge:</strong></p>
<p>Imagine you're planning datacenter capacity right now for 2027. You need to make billion-dollar decisions today based on what you think AI usage will look like in three years.</p>
<p>Here's scenario one: agent adoption is gradual. Some developers use Claude Code daily. A few enterprises deploy internal agents. Customer service stays mostly human with AI assist. You need maybe 3-4x your current infrastructure.</p>
<p>Here's scenario two: agents go mainstream. Every developer has an always-on coding agent consuming millions of tokens per session. Enterprises deploy agents across operations, finance, legal, sales. Customer service becomes 80% agentic with humans handling escalations. You need 30-50x your current infrastructure.</p>
<p>Both scenarios are completely plausible. Nobody can tell you which one is right. But you have to commit billions in capex NOW - datacenters take 2-3 years to build, GPU orders have 6-12 month lead times.</p>
<p><strong>But here's the really insidious part:</strong> even if you're directionally right, small errors compound massively. Let's say you're confident agents are going mainstream and you need roughly 50x growth over 3 years.</p>
<p>If actual demand is 40x, you've overbuilt by 25% - billions in excess capacity.
If actual demand is 60x, you've underbuilt by 20% - your service degrades and you lose market share.</p>
<p>You're trying to hit a moving target in the dark, and the margin of error is measured in tens of billions of dollars and thousands of megawatts of power infrastructure.</p>
<p>If you build for scenario one and scenario two happens, your service degrades to unusable, users revolt, and you lose the AI wars to competitors who bet bigger. If you build for scenario two and scenario one happens, you've got billions in underutilized datacenters burning cash.</p>
<p>Which mistake would you rather make?</p>
<p>This is where the telecoms comparison makes sense: given those choices, rational players overbuild. The difference is what happens to that overcapacity.</p>
<h2>The Key Differences</h2>
<p>Let me put this in a table:</p>

<th>AI Datacenters (2020s)</th>

</tbody>
</table>
<p>The telecoms crash happened because exponential supply improvements met linearly growing (and overestimated) demand, with infrastructure that would last decades sitting unused.</p>
<p>AI datacenters are facing slowing supply improvements meeting potentially exponentially growing demand. And crucially, because GPU efficiency improvements are slowing down, today's hardware retains value for longer - not shorter - than previous generations.</p>
<h2>What About a Short-Term Correction?</h2>
<p>Could there still be a short-term crash? Absolutely.</p>
<p><strong>Scenarios that could trigger a correction:</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. Agent adoption hits a wall</strong></p>
<p>Enterprises might discover that production agent deployments are harder than demos suggest. Hallucinations in high-stakes workflows, regulatory concerns around autonomous AI systems, or implementation complexity could slow adoption dramatically. If the agent future takes 5-7 years instead of 2-3, there's a painful gap where billions in infrastructure sits waiting for demand to catch up.</p>
<p>However, given the explosion in usage for software engineering and other tasks, I suspect this is highly unlikely. You can already use Claude Code for <a href="https://martinalderson.com/posts/building-a-tax-agent-with-claude-code/">non engineering tasks</a> in professional services and get very impressive results without any industry specific modifications, so I have no doubt there is going to be very high adoption of agents in all kinds of areas.</p>
<p><strong>2. Financial engineering unravels</strong></p>
<p>These datacenter buildouts are heavily debt-financed. If credit markets seize up, interest rates spike further, or lenders lose confidence in AI growth projections, the financing model could collapse. This wouldn't be about technical fundamentals - it would be good old-fashioned financial panic, similar to what happened in telecoms when the debt markets froze, but with one key difference - a lot of the key players (Microsoft, Google, Meta, Oracle) are extremely cash flow positive, which definitely wasn't the case in the 2000s fibre boom. The pure datacentre players though are at risk - who don't have a money printing main business to backstop the finance -  no doubt about that.</p>
<p><strong>3. Efficiency breakthroughs change the math</strong></p>
<p>Model efficiency could improve faster than expected. Or we could see a hardware breakthrough: custom ASICs that are 10x more efficient than GB200s for inference workloads. Either scenario could make current buildouts look excessive. I actually think this is the biggest risk - and this is <em>exactly</em> what happened in the fibre boom. So far, I'm not seeing signs of this though. While specialist ASICs are becoming available, they hit their impressive speed by having huge wafers, which isn't a huge efficiency game (yet).</p>
<p><strong>The Key Difference From Telecoms:</strong></p>
<p>Even if there's a correction, the underlying dynamics are different. Telecoms built for demand that was 4x overestimated, then watched fiber optic technology improvements make their infrastructure obsolete before it could be utilized. The result: 95% of fiber remained permanently dark.</p>
<p>AI datacenters might face a different scenario. If we build for 50x growth and only get 30x over 3 years, that's not "dark infrastructure" - that's just infrastructure that gets utilized on a slower timeline than expected. Unlike fiber optic cable sitting in the ground unused, GPU clusters still serve production workloads, just at lower capacity than planned.</p>
<p>And unlike telecoms where exponential technology improvements made old infrastructure worthless, GPU efficiency improvements are slowing. A GB200 deployed today doesn't become obsolete when next year's chip arrives - because that chip is only incrementally better, not 100x better. With process node improvements slowing down, current generation hardware actually retains value for longer.</p>
<p>A correction might mean 2-3 years of financial pain, consolidation, and write-downs as demand catches up to capacity. But that's fundamentally different from building infrastructure for demand that never materializes while technology makes it obsolete.</p>
<h2>The Real Risk: Timing, Not Direction</h2>
<p>I think the real question isn't whether we need massive AI infrastructure - the agent transition alone suggests we do. The question is timing.</p>
<p>If enterprises take 5 years to adopt agents at scale instead of 2 years, and hyperscalers have built for the 2-year scenario, you could see a 2-3 year period of overcapacity and financial pain. That might be enough to trigger a correction, layoffs, and consolidation.</p>
<p>But unlike telecoms, that overcapacity would likely get absorbed.</p>
<p>The telecom fibre mostly stayed dark because technology outpaced it and demand never materialized. AI infrastructure might just be early, not wrong.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Are we repeating the telecoms crash with AI datacenters? The fundamentals suggest not, but that doesn't mean there won't be bumps.</p>
<p>The key insight people miss when making the telecoms comparison: telecoms had exponential supply improvements meeting linear demand, with 4x overestimated growth assumptions. AI has slowing supply improvements potentially meeting exponential demand growth from the agent transition.</p>
<p>The risks are different:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Telecoms:</strong> Built too much infrastructure that became completely obsolete by supply-side technology improvements</li>
<li><strong>AI:</strong> Might build too much too fast for demand that arrives slower than expected</li>
</ul>
<p>But the "too much" in AI's case is more like "3 years of runway instead of 1 year" rather than "95% will never be used."</p>
<p>I could be wrong. Maybe agent adoption stalls, maybe model efficiency makes current infrastructure obsolete, maybe there's a breakthrough in GPU architecture that changes everything. But when I look at the numbers, I don't see the same setup as the telecoms crash.</p>
<p>The fundamentals are different. That doesn't mean there won't be pain, consolidation, or failures. But comparing this to 2000s telecoms seems like the wrong mental model for what's actually happening.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://vechron.com/2025/12/anthropic-hires-wilson-sonsini-ipo-2026-openai-race/">https://vechron.com/2025/12/anthropic-hires-wilson-sonsini-ipo-2026-openai-race/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46132531">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
<p>San Francisco-based <strong>Anthropic</strong> has asked Wilson Sonsini Goodrich &amp; Rosati to begin work on an initial public offering (IPO) that could take place as early as 2026, the Financial Times <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/3254fa30-5bdb-4c30-8560-7cd7ebbefc5f" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> this week.</p>



<p>The move positions the company, best known for its Claude chatbot, to reach the stock market ahead of rival OpenAI and would test investors’ willingness to fund large, loss-making artificial-intelligence labs. People familiar with the plans cautioned that discussions with investment banks remain informal and that no underwriting line-up has been chosen.</p>




<p><strong>Wilson Sonsini</strong>, which advised Anthropic on its multibillion-dollar investment agreements with Amazon and Google, has <a href="https://www.wsgr.com/en/services/practice-areas/corporate/capital-markets.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">previously</a> guided Google, LinkedIn and Lyft to market.</p>



<p>In a statement, an Anthropic spokesperson said: “We have not made any decisions about when, or even whether, to go public.”</p>



<p>The IPO preparations coincide with a private fundraising round that could value Anthropic above $300 billion. Microsoft and Nvidia have jointly committed $15 billion to that round, according to the Financial Times, while Anthropic has pledged to spend $30 billion on Microsoft’s cloud platform over the next four years. A previous funding round this autumn pegged the company at roughly $183 billion.</p>



<p>Chief executive Dario Amodei has told investors that annualised revenue could rise to $26 billion next year, triple this year’s run-rate, as the customer base expands beyond 300,000 businesses.</p>



<p>Internal changes aimed at satisfying public-market requirements are already under way. Last year Anthropic <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/krishna-rao-joins-anthropic" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hired</a> Airbnb’s former head of corporate finance, <strong>Krishna Rao</strong>, as chief financial officer and has since worked through governance, accounting and disclosure checklists, one source said.</p>




<p>OpenAI, valued at about $500 billion after a recent share sale, is <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/openai-lays-groundwork-juggernaut-ipo-up-1-trillion-valuation-2025-10-29/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">conducting</a> similar early-stage work but chief financial officer Sarah Friar said last month that a listing is “not in the near-term plan.”</p>



<p>Both companies face the challenge of forecasting profits while spending heavily on model training and infrastructure. Anthropic recently <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/anthropic-invest-50-billion-build-data-centers-us-2025-11-12/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> a $50 billion build-out of data centres in Texas and New York and plans to triple its global workforce.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p>The Foundation that promotes the Zig programming language has quit GitHub due to what its leadership perceives as the code sharing site's decline.</p>
<p>The drama began in April 2025 when GitHub user AlekseiNikiforovIBM started a <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/actions/runner/issues/3792">thread</a> titled “safe_sleep.sh rarely hangs indefinitely.” GitHub addressed the problem in August, but didn’t reveal that in the thread, which remained open until Monday.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>The code uses 100 percent CPU all the time, and will run forever</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That timing appears notable. Last week, Andrew Kelly, president and lead developer of the Zig Software Foundation, <a href="https://ziglang.org/news/migrating-from-github-to-codeberg/" rel="nofollow">announced</a> that the Zig project is moving to Codeberg, a non-profit git hosting service, because GitHub no longer demonstrates commitment to engineering excellence.</p>
<p>One piece of evidence he offered for that assessment was the “safe_sleep.sh rarely hangs indefinitely” thread.</p>
<p>"Most importantly, Actions has <a href="https://github.com/actions/runner/issues/3792#issuecomment-3182746514" rel="nofollow">inexcusable bugs</a> while being <a href="https://github.com/actions/runner/issues/385" rel="nofollow">completely neglected</a>," Kelly wrote. "After the <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/github-ceo-developers-embrace-ai-or-get-out-2025-8" rel="nofollow">CEO of GitHub said to 'embrace AI or get out'</a>, it seems the lackeys at Microsoft took the hint, because GitHub Actions started 'vibe-scheduling' – choosing jobs to run seemingly at random. Combined with other bugs and inability to manually intervene, this causes our CI system to get so backed up that not even master branch commits get checked."</p>
<h3>Older and deeper</h3>
<p>Kelly’s gripe seems justified, as the bug discussed in the thread appears to have popped up following <a href="https://github.com/actions/runner/pull/1707/commits/4135bc20763f93a8a1cb9375af6a5333142abc16" rel="nofollow">a code change</a> in February 2022 that users flagged in prior bug reports.</p>
<p>The code change replaced instances of the posix "sleep" command with a "safe_sleep" script that failed to work as advertised. It was supposed to allow the GitHub Actions runner – the application that runs a job from a GitHub Actions workflow – to pause execution safely.</p>

    

<p>"The bug in this 'safe sleep' script is obvious from looking at it: if the process is not scheduled for the one-second interval in which the loop would return (due to $SECONDS having the correct value), then it simply spins forever," wrote Zig core developer Matthew Lugg in <a href="https://github.com/actions/runner/issues/3792#issuecomment-3182746514" rel="nofollow">a comment</a> appended to the April bug thread.</p>

        


        

<p>"That can easily happen on a CI machine under extreme load. When this happens, it's pretty bad: it completely breaks a runner until manual intervention. On Zig's CI runner machines, we observed multiple of these processes which had been running for hundreds of hours, silently taking down two runner services for weeks."</p>
<p>The fix was <a href="https://github.com/actions/runner/pull/3157#event-19252199948" rel="nofollow">merged</a> on August 20, 2025, from a separate issue opened back in February 2024. The related bug report from April 2025 remained open <a href="https://github.com/actions/runner/issues/3792#issuecomment-3597495291" rel="nofollow">until Monday, December 1, 2025</a>. A separate CPU usage bug <a href="https://github.com/actions/runner/pull/3143" rel="nofollow">remains unresolved</a>.</p>

</ul>
<p>Jeremy Howard, co-founder of Answer.AI and Fast.AI, said in a series of social media <a href="https://x.com/jeremyphoward/status/1994532591685570942?s=20" rel="nofollow">posts</a> that users’ claims about GitHub Actions being in a poor state of repair appear to be justified.</p>
<p>"The bug," <a href="https://x.com/jeremyphoward/status/1994532596257362326?s=20" rel="nofollow">he wrote</a>, "was implemented in a way that, very obviously to nearly anyone at first glance, uses 100 percent CPU all the time, and will run forever unless the task happens to check the time during the correct second."</p>
<blockquote>

<p>I can't see how such an extraordinary collection of outright face-palming events could be made</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He <a href="https://x.com/jeremyphoward/status/1994532598404845901?s=20" rel="nofollow">added</a> that the platform-independent fix for the CPU issue proposed last February lingered for a year without review and was <a href="https://github.com/actions/runner/pull/3157#event-16646534098" rel="nofollow">closed</a> by the GitHub bot in March 2025 before being revived and merged.</p>
<p>"Whilst one could say that this is just one isolated incident, I can't see how such an extraordinary collection of outright face-palming events could be made in any reasonably functioning organization," Howard <a href="https://x.com/jeremyphoward/status/1994532608290820180?s=20" rel="nofollow">concluded</a>.</p>

        

<p>GitHub did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>
<p>While Kelly has gone on to <a href="https://ziggit.dev/t/migrating-from-github-to-codeberg-zig-programming-language/13234/53" rel="nofollow">apologize</a> for the incendiary nature of his post, Zig is not the only software project publicly parting ways with GitHub.</p>
<p>Over the weekend, Rodrigo Arias Mallo, creator of the Dillo browser project, <a href="https://dillo-browser.org/news/migration-from-github/" rel="nofollow">said</a> he's planning to move away from GitHub owing to concerns about over-reliance on JavaScript, GitHub's ability to deny service, declining usability, inadequate moderation tools, and "over-focusing on LLMs and generative AI, which are destroying the open web (or what remains of it) among <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence#Concerns" rel="nofollow">other problems</a>."</p>

        

<p>Codeberg, for its part, has doubled its supporting membership since January, going from <a href="https://blog.codeberg.org/letter-from-codeberg-looking-into-2025.html" rel="nofollow">more than 600 members</a> to <a href="https://blog.codeberg.org/letter-from-codeberg-onwards-and-upwards.html" rel="nofollow">over 1,200</a> as of last week.</p>
<p>GitHub has not disclosed how many of its users pay for its services presently. The code hosting biz had "over 1.3 million paid GitHub Copilot subscribers, up 30 percent quarter-over-quarter," Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said on the company's <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/investor/events/fy-2024/earnings-fy-2024-q2" rel="nofollow">Q2 2024 earnings call</a>.</p>
<p>In Q4 2024, when GitHub reported <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/investor/events/fy-2024/earnings-fy-2024-q4" rel="nofollow">an annual revenue run rate of $2 billion</a>, GitHub Copilot subscriptions accounted for about 40 percent of the company's annual revenue growth.</p>
<p>Nadella offered a different figure during Microsoft's <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/investor/events/fy-2025/earnings-fy-2025-q3" rel="nofollow">Q3 2025 earnings call</a>: "we now have over 15 million GitHub Copilot users, up over 4X year-over-year." It's not clear how many GitHub users pay for Copilot, or for runner scripts that burned CPU cycles when they should have been sleeping. ®</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>

                
                
                        
<p>EU officials must revisit the hastily agreed trade deal with the US, where the EU stated that it “intends to accept” lower US vehicle standards, say cities – including Paris, Brussels and Amsterdam, and more than 75 civil society organisations. In a letter to European lawmakers, the signatories warn that aligning European standards with laxer rules in the US would undermine the EU’s global leadership in road safety, public health, climate policy and competitiveness.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Road Safety</strong></p>



<p>The deal agreed over summer states that <em>“with respect to automobiles, the United States and the European Union intend to accept and provide mutual recognition to each other’s standards.” </em>Yet, EU vehicle safety regulations have supported a <a href="https://etsc.eu/wp-content/uploads/15-PIN-annual-report-FINAL.pdf">36% reduction</a> in European road deaths since 2010. By contrast, road deaths in the US over the same period <a href="https://www.transportation.gov/sites/dot.gov/files/2024-02/2024%20NRSS%20Progress%20Report.pdf">increased 30%</a>, with pedestrian deaths up 80% and cyclist deaths up 50%.</p>



<p>Europe currently has mandatory requirements for life-saving technologies, such as pedestrian protection, automated emergency braking and lane-keeping assistance. Some of the most basic pedestrian protection requirements which have long been in place in the EU, such as deformation zones in the front of vehicles to reduce crash severity and the prohibition of sharp edges have made cars like the Tesla Cybertruck illegal to sell in Europe.</p>



<p><em>“Europe built its reputation on pioneering robust vehicle standards.To accept lower US standards would undo decades of EU progress,” </em>say the signatories<em>. </em>According to the letter <em>“the consequences of such a move for European road safety would be profound.</em>“</p>

</p></figure>



<p><strong>European air quality &amp; health at risk</strong></p>



<p>The EU is set to apply limits to harmful pollution from brake and tyre wear from 2026 onwards, while at the same time the US is moving to weaken air pollution rules for vehicles. Accepting weaker US standards would increase European exposure to pollutants linked to asthma, cancer and numerous cardiovascular and neurological conditions, warn the signatories.</p>



<p><strong>Jobs threat in Europe</strong></p>



<p>Major EU brands such as BMW, Mercedes and Stellantis already build large numbers of vehicles in US automotive plants to EU standards – particularly larger SUVs. However, if the lower US vehicle standards are accepted in Europe, these production lines could produce vehicles to these US lower standards, before shipping these vehicles to the EU. Overall, vehicle production would shift from the EU to the US. To accept lower US car standards would risk large-scale job losses in EU car plants and across Europe’s automotive supply chain.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Existing import loopholes must be closed</strong></p>



<p>The European Commission is already working to tighten Individual Vehicle Approval (IVA), which is being abused to put thousands of oversized US pick-up trucks on EU streets without complying with core EU safety, air pollution and climate standards. To now accept lower US vehicle standards across the board would open the floodgates to US pick-ups and large SUVs.</p>



<p>The signatories urge EU lawmakers to oppose the intention to accept lower US vehicle standards in the EU–US Joint Statement and affirm publicly that EU vehicle standards are non-negotiable.</p>

            <p>Japanese game makers are struggling to locate affordable commercial fonts after one of the country's leading font licensing services raised the cost of its annual plan from around $380 to $20,500 (USD).</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://gamemakers.jp/article/2025_11_18_123775/">Gamemakers</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespark.jp/article/2025/11/30/160034.html?">GameSpark</a> and translated by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/japanese-game-developers-face-ridiculously-high-font-license-fees-following-us-acquisition-of-major-domestic-provider-live-service-games-to-take-the-biggest-blow/">Automaton</a>, Fontworks LETS discontinued its game licence plan at the end of November.</p>
<p>The expensive replacement plan – offered through Fontwork's parent company, Monotype – doesn't even provide local pricing for Japanese developers, and comes with a 25,000 user-cap, which is likely not workable for Japan's bigger studios.</p>
<p>The problem is further compounded by the difficulties and complexities of securing fonts that can accurately transcribe Kanji and Katakana characters.</p>
<p>"This is a little-known issue, but it's become a huge problem in some circles," <a href="https://x.com/aizen76/status/1993694448296018155?s=20">wrote</a> CEO of development studio Indie-Us Games.</p>
<p>UI/UX designer Yamanaka <a href="https://x.com/KY_creator/status/1993926902277616015?s=20">stressed</a> that this would be particularly problematic for live service games; even if studios moved quickly and switched to fonts available through an alternate licensee, they will have to re-test, re-validate, and re-QA check content already live and in active use.</p>
<p>The crisis could even eventually force some Japanese studios to rebrand entirely if their corporate identity is tied to a commercial font they can no longer afford to license.</p>

To allay the obvious privacy concerns, the company emphasizes the sensors are only pointed down, into the bowl, and assures potential buyers that the data collected by the device and app are protected with "end-to-end encryption”.</span></p><p><img height="210" width="445" src="https://varlogsimon.leaflet.pub/api/atproto_images?did=did:plc:2rltjvii4o7fjtsb6kfe4qe6&amp;cid=bafkreihgb7sosbpyorzc7vixcngmxnwc6w43yj2ix5fynlbkeeyguwddtu"></p><p id="2" data-index="2"><span>Kohler Health’s </span><a href="https://www.kohlerhealth.com/" target="_blank">homepage</a><span>, the page for the </span><a href="https://www.kohlerhealth.com/kohler-health-app/" target="_blank">Kohler Health App</a><span>, and a </span><a href="https://www.kohlerhealth.com/support/privacy/how-kohler-health-keeps-my-data-private/" target="_blank">support page</a><span> all use the term “end-to-end encryption” to describe the protection the app provides for data. </span><a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/medical/kohlers-tiny-toilet-camera-analyzes-the-contents-and-reports-back-to-you/" target="_blank">Many</a><span> </span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/802727/kohler-health-dekoda-toilet-camera-optical-sensors" target="_blank">media</a><span> </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/19/kohler-unveils-a-camera-for-your-toilet/" target="_blank">outlets</a><span> included the claim in their articles covering the launch of the product.</span></p><p id="3" data-index="3"><span>However, responses from the company make it clear that—contrary to common understanding of the term—Kohler is able to access data collected by the device and associated application. Additionally, the company states that the data collected by the device and app may be used to train AI models.</span></p><h3 id="4" data-index="4"><span>What is End-to-End Encryption?</span></h3><p id="5" data-index="5"><span>"End-to-end encryption", or E2EE, is a method of securing data that ensures only the sender and their chosen recipient are able to view it. Correctly implemented, it prevents other parties, including the developer of the application, from accessing the protected data. E2EE is best known for its use in messaging applications like WhatsApp, iMessage, and Signal, where it allows users to communicate securely and privately without worrying about their messages being seen by prying eyes at the app developers, internet service providers, and even governments.</span></p><p id="6" data-index="6"><span>E2EE also provides an additional layer of protection if the servers of the application developer are compromised by an attacker. Any data stored on those servers will be meaningless to the attacker, which can significantly reduce the impact of a breach. For a more detailed look at E2EE, see </span><a href="https://ssd.eff.org/module/deep-dive-end-end-encryption-how-do-public-key-encryption-systems-work" target="_blank">A Deep Dive on End-to-End Encryption</a><span> from the Electronic Frontier Foundation.</span></p><h3 id="7" data-index="7"><span>What is Kohler Doing?</span></h3><p id="8" data-index="8"><span>The initial issue with Kohler using the term “end-to-end encryption” is that it’s not obvious how it could apply to their product. The term is generally used for applications that allow some kind of communication between users, and Kohler Health doesn’t have any user-to-user sharing features. So while one “end” would be the user, it’s not clear what the other end would be.</span></p><p id="9" data-index="9"><span>I thought Kohler might actually have implemented a related data protection method known as “client-side encryption”, used by services like Apple’s iCloud and the password manager 1Password. This technique allows an application to back up a user’s data to the developers servers, or synchronize data between multiple devices owned by a user, without allowing anyone but the user to access the data.</span></p><p id="10" data-index="10"><span>But emails exchanged with Kohler’s privacy contact clarified that the other “end” that can decrypt the data is Kohler themselves: “User data is encrypted at rest, when it’s stored on the user's mobile phone, toilet attachment, and on our systems.&nbsp; Data in transit is also encrypted end-to-end, as it travels between the user's devices and our systems, where it is decrypted and processed to provide our service.”</span></p><p id="11" data-index="11"><span>They additionally told me “We have designed our systems and processes to protect identifiable images from access by Kohler Health employees through a combination of data encryption, technical safeguards, and governance controls.”</span></p><p id="12" data-index="12"><span>What Kohler is referring to as E2EE here is simply HTTPS encryption between the app and the server, something that has been basic security practice for two decades now, plus encryption at rest.</span></p><h3 id="13" data-index="13"><span>How is Kohler Using the Data?</span></h3><p id="14" data-index="14"><span>If Kohler can access the data stored on its servers, what are they doing with it? While I don’t have a precise answer, there are indications they’re using it for purposes beyond simply providing a service to the user. This may include training AI models.&nbsp;</span></p><p id="15" data-index="15"><span>In response to my question about their use of E2EE, Kohler told me “our algorithms are trained on de-identified data only.” When signing up for an account on the app, the user is prompted to allow Kolher to use the data to "research, develop, and improve its products and technology, and to de-identify [the user’s] data for lawful purposes.”</span></p><p><img height="375" width="995" src="https://varlogsimon.leaflet.pub/api/atproto_images?did=did:plc:2rltjvii4o7fjtsb6kfe4qe6&amp;cid=bafkreifdn5v3tclg7qm74fm7ce2lt3oiwtfcg6kvctsl6lm5tumx2lypxi"></p><p id="17" data-index="17"><span>And the </span><a href="https://www.kohlerhealth.com/privacy-policy/" target="_blank">privacy policy</a><span> states data may be used “To create aggregated, de-identified and/or anonymized data, which we may use and share with third parties for our lawful business purposes, including to analyze and improve the Kohler Health Platform and our other products and services, to promote our business, and to train our AI and machine learning models.”</span></p></div></div>]]></description>

            <guid>46128286</guid>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I'm guessing everyone here has played DOOM before, or at least seen someone else play the game.<br>
It would also not be of any news for most here, that DOOM has specific hard-coded sound drivers which directly talk to the sound hardware.<br>
Now, many PCs didn't have a dedicated (let alone supported) sound card for DOOM. What people often overlook is the PC Speaker driver that DOOM comes with. Mostly as it can only play back sound effects (and does so quite poorly too). Many times, it ends up disabled rather than being used.<br>
For a long time, it has been speculated that the PC Speaker driver never supported audio as it would have been too resource intensive to drive the interface in real-time while performing game logic. Now, on a 286, I would totally understand this reasoning, but on a processor as fast as a 486? No chance it wouldn't work!</p><p>

Introducing: The PC Speaker sndserver patch!<br>
I had decided that the only way to answer the question of if, was to try it. And try it I did:<br>
<a href="https://youtu.be/bRHyQPhA_9A">https://youtu.be/bRHyQPhA_9A</a></p><p>

A few weeks ago, I had written a file format for efficiently playing PC Speaker tunes on a 32-bit system, requiring only a few integer operations to turn the data into a valid call for the input/misc/pcspkr device. The format being called <em>pcsp</em> and working as follows:<br>
A song is made up of an array of 32 bit tone cells consisting of<br>
- a 16 bit frequency value in Hz<br>
- a 4 bit duration scale (second*10^-scale)<br>
- a 12 bit duration value</p><p>

Now, all I really had to do to get PC Speaker music working in DOOM, was to implement a priority mixer for it in sndserver.<br>
The ground work for which already existed in the existing Adlib target.</p><p>

Surprisingly, running the game with and without the patch showed no noticeable speed differences.</p><p>

Will this patch become public? Yes, soon.<br>
I do not feel comfortable with publishing it yet as I currently only have the E1M1 soundtrack implemented and also would like to fix a few other issues with the sndserver on modern Linux while I have the chance.</p></div></div>]]></description>

That’s why we generate more renewable energy than our AI features use, from 100% clean sources like solar and wind.</p><p>We’ve invested €18M in renewable energy projects — expanding solar parks and adding clean power to the grid. The energy we generate helps displace fossil fuels and accelerate the transition to renewable energy.</p><p>We use tools like the <a href="https://huggingface.co/AIEnergyScore"><u>AI Energy Score</u></a> and <a href="https://ecologits.ai/latest/"><u>Ecologits</u></a> to select efficient models and track their energy use — keeping our process transparent, and ourselves accountable.</p><h2 id="your-data-stays-yours">Your data stays yours</h2><p>Our new features respect your privacy as much as they respect the planet.

Building our own infrastructure gives us more control over the technology, so we can make it greener and more privacy-friendly.</p><p>Unlike Big Tech, we don’t run email, maps, or payment platforms, so we couldn’t piece together your life even if we wanted to. That’s not our business, and it never will be. As a European company, we’re bound by strict privacy laws like the GDPR, which means your data stays yours.</p><p>AI shouldn’t come at the cost of privacy.
