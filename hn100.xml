<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<p>A decade ago to the day, I published a tweet launching what would surely become yet another pet project that scratched an itch, was kinda useful to a few people but other than that, would shortly fade away into the same obscurity as all the other ones I'd launched over the previous couple of decades:</p>

<blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">It's alive! "Have I been pwned?" by <a href="https://twitter.com/troyhunt?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref=troyhunt.com">@troyhunt</a> is now up and running. Search for your account across multiple breaches <a href="http://t.co/U0QyHZxP6k?ref=troyhunt.com">http://t.co/U0QyHZxP6k</a></p>‚Äî Have I Been Pwned (@haveibeenpwned) <a href="https://twitter.com/haveibeenpwned/status/408153032698785792?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref=troyhunt.com">December 4, 2013</a></blockquote> 

<p>And then, as they say, things kinda escalated quickly. The very next day <a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/working-with-154-million-records-on/" rel="noreferrer">I published a blog post about how I made it so fast to search through 154M records</a> and thus began <a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/tag/have-i-been-pwned-3f/" rel="noreferrer">a now 185-post epic</a> where I began detailing the minutiae of how I built this thing, the decisions I made about how to run it and commentary on all sorts of different breaches. And now, a 10th birthday blog post about what really sticks out a decade later. And that's precisely what this 185th blog post tagging HIBP is - the noteworthy things of the years past, including a few things I've never discussed publicly before.</p><h3 id="pwned">Pwned?</h3><p>You know why it's called "Have I Been Pwned"? Try coming up with almost any conceivable <em>normal </em>sounding English name and getting a .com domain for it. <em>Good luck!</em> That was certainly part of it, but another part of the name choice was simply that I honestly didn't expect this thing to go anywhere. It's like I said in the intro of this post where I fully expected this to be another failed project, so why does the name matter?</p><p>But it's weird how "pwned" has stuck and increasingly, become synonymous with HIBP. For many people, the first time they ever hear the word is in the context of "Have I Been..." with an ensuing discussion often explaining the origins of the term as it relates to gaming culture. And if you do go and look for a definition of the term online, you'll come across resources such as <a href="https://www.inverse.com/gaming/pwned-meaning-definition-origins-video-games-internet-hackers?ref=troyhunt.com" rel="noreferrer">How ‚ÄúPWNED‚Äù went from hacker slang to the internet‚Äôs favourite taunt</a>:</p><blockquote>Then in 2013, when various web services and sites saw an uptick in personal data breaches, security expert Troy Hunt created the website ‚ÄúHave I Been Pwned?‚Äù Anyone can type in an email address into the site to check if their personal data has been compromised in a security breach.</blockquote><p>And somehow, this little project is now referenced in the definition of the name it emerged from. Weird.</p><p>But, because it's such an odd name that has so frequently been mispronounced or mistyped, I've ended up with a whole raft of bizarre domain names including <a href="http://haveibeenpaened.com/?ref=troyhunt.com" rel="noreferrer">haveibeenpaened.com</a>, <a href="http://haveibeenpwnded.com/?ref=troyhunt.com" rel="noreferrer">haveibeenpwnded.com</a>, <a href="http://haveibeenporned.com/?ref=troyhunt.com" rel="noreferrer">haveibeenporned.com</a> and my personal favourite, <a href="http://haveibeenprawned.com/?ref=troyhunt.com" rel="noreferrer">haveibeenprawned.com</a> (because a journo literally pronounced it that way in a major news segment ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è). Not to mention all the other weird variations including <a href="http://haveibeenburned.com/?ref=troyhunt.com" rel="noreferrer">haveibeenburned.com</a>, <a href="http://haveigotpwned.com/?ref=troyhunt.com" rel="noreferrer">haveigotpwned.com</a>, <a href="http://haveibeenrekt.com/?ref=troyhunt.com" rel="noreferrer">haveibeenrekt.com</a> and after someone made the suggestion following the revelation that PornHub follows me, <a href="http://haveibeenfucked.com/?ref=troyhunt.com" rel="noreferrer">haveibeenfucked.com</a> ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è</p><h3 id="press">Press</h3><p>It's difficult to even know where to start here. How does the little site with the weird name end up in the press? Inevitably, "because data breaches", and it's <em>nuts</em> just how much exposure this project has had because of them. These are often mainstream news events and what reporters often want to impart to people is along the lines of "Here's what you should do if you've been impacted", which often boils down to checking HIBP.</p><p>Press is great for raising awareness of the project, but it has also quite literally DDoS'd the service with <a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/brief-lessons-on-handling-huge-traffic-spikes/" rel="noreferrer">the Martin Lewis Money Show in the UK knocking it offline in 2016</a>. Cool! No, for real, I learned some really valuable lessons from that experience which, of course, I shared in a blog post. And then ensured could never happen again.</p><p>Back in 2018, Gizmodo reckoned HIBP was <a href="https://gizmodo.com/100-websites-that-shaped-the-internet-as-we-know-it-1829634771?ref=troyhunt.com" rel="noreferrer">one of the top 100 websites that shaped the internet as we knew it</a>, alongside the likes of Wikipedia, Google, Amazon and Goatse (don't Google it). Only the year after it launched, <a href="https://time.com/3054279/50-best-websites-2014/?ref=troyhunt.com" rel="noreferrer">TIME magazine reckon'd it was one of the 50 best websites of the year</a>. And every time I do a Google search for a major news outlet, I find this little website. <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-to-know-if-hackers-stole-your-personal-info-and-how-to-protect-yourself-1468588297?ref=troyhunt.com" rel="noreferrer">The Wall Street Journal</a>. <a href="https://www.standard.co.uk/news/tech/worlds-biggest-stolen-data-trove-nears-10-billion-records-a4485241.html?ref=troyhunt.com" rel="noreferrer">The Standard</a> (nice headline!) <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/columnist/2021/04/20/your-password-hacked-here-sites-alert-breaches/7262433002/?ref=troyhunt.com" rel="noreferrer">USA Today</a>. <a href="https://www.thestar.com/business/bell-small-business-customer-information-leaked-by-hackers/article_244a34a5-1b26-5378-8641-fec011cdc907.html?ref=troyhunt.com" rel="noreferrer">Toronto Star</a>. <a href="https://www.telegraaf.nl/nieuws/1835903/is-jouw-wachtwoord-ooit-gestolen-op-deze-website-kan-je-het-testen?ref=troyhunt.com" rel="noreferrer">De Telegraf</a>. <a href="https://www.vg.no/forbruker/teknologi/i/goWoa/dropbox-avviser-hackerangrep?ref=troyhunt.com" rel="noreferrer">VG</a>. <a href="https://www.lemonde.fr/pixels/article/2016/09/06/les-donnees-de-790-000-utilisateurs-du-site-pornographique-brazzers-derobees_4993334_4408996.html?ref=troyhunt.com" rel="noreferrer">Le Monde</a>. <a href="https://www.corriere.it/tecnologia/cards/password-peggiori-ancora-piu-usate-rischio-hacker/come-scoprire-se-si-compromessi.shtml?ref=troyhunt.com" rel="noreferrer">Corriere della Sera</a>.

"You know they're just trying to get you to DC so they can arrest you for all that stolen data you have, right?! ü§£", the internet quipped. But instead, I had one of the most memorable moments of my career as <a href="https://youtu.be/A0HPTrBiU5g?t=1359&amp;ref=troyhunt.com" rel="noreferrer">I read my testimony</a> (these are public hearings so it's all recorded and available to watch), responded to questions from congressmen and congresswomen and rounded out the trip staring down at where they inaugurate presidents:</p><figure><img src="https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2023/11/IMG_0313.JPG" alt="" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="2667" srcset="https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/size/w600/2023/11/IMG_0313.JPG 600w, https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/size/w1000/2023/11/IMG_0313.JPG 1000w, https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/size/w1600/2023/11/IMG_0313.JPG 1600w, https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/size/w2400/2023/11/IMG_0313.JPG 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Today, that photo adorns the wall outside my office and dozens of times a day I look at it and ask the same question - <em>how did it all lead to this?!</em></p><h3 id="svalbard">Svalbard</h3><p>The potential sale of HIBP was a very painful, very expensive chapter of life, announced in <a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/project-svalbard-the-future-of-have-i-been-pwned/" rel="noreferrer">a blog post from June 2019</a>. For the most part, I was as transparent and honest as I could be about the reasons behind the decision, including the stress:</p><blockquote>To be completely honest, it's been an enormously stressful year dealing with it all.</blockquote><p>More than one year later, <a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/sustaining-performance-under-extreme-stress/" rel="noreferrer">I finally wrote about the source of so much of that stress</a>: divorce. Relationship circumstances had put a huge amount of pressure on me and I needed a relief valve which at the time, I thought would be the sale of the project I loved so much but was becoming increasingly demanding. Ultimately, Project Svalbard (the code name for the sale of HIBP), had the opposite effect as years of bitter legal battles with my ex ensued, in part due to the perceived value that would have been realised had it been sold and some big tech company owned my arse for years to come. The project I built out of a passion to do community good was now being used as a tool to extract as much money out of me as possible. There's a wild story to be told there one day but whilst that saga is now well and truly behind me, the scars are still raw.</p><p>There were many times throughout Project Svalbard where I felt like I was living out an episode of Silicon Valley, especially as I hopped between interviews at the who's-who of tech firms in San Francisco to meet potential acquirers. But there was one moment in particular that I knew at the time would form an indelible memory, so I took a photo of it:</p><figure><img src="https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2023/11/IMG_3439.JPG" alt="" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1500" srcset="https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/size/w600/2023/11/IMG_3439.JPG 600w, https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/size/w1000/2023/11/IMG_3439.JPG 1000w, https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/size/w1600/2023/11/IMG_3439.JPG 1600w, https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/size/w2400/2023/11/IMG_3439.JPG 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>I'm sitting in a rental car in Yosemite whilst driving from the aforementioned meetings in SF and onto Vegas for the annual big cyber-events. I had a scheduled call with a big tech firm who was a potential acquirer and should that deal go through, the guy I was speaking to would be my new boss. I'd done that dozens of times by now and I don't know if it was because I was especially tired or emotional or if there was something in the way he phrased the question, but this triggered something deep inside me:</p><blockquote>So Troy, what would your perfect day in the office look like?</blockquote><p>I didn't say it this directly, but I kid you not this is exactly what popped into my mind:</p><blockquote>I get on my jet ski and I do whatever the fuck I want</blockquote><p>My potential new overlord had somehow managed to find exactly the raw nerve to touch that made me realise how valuable independence had become to me. 6 months later, Project Svalbard was dead after a deal I'd struck fell through. I still can't talk about the precise circumstances due to being NDA'd up to wazoo, but the term we chose to use was "a change of business circumstances on behalf of the purchaser". With the benefit of hindsight, I've never been so happy to have lost so much üòä</p><h3 id="the-fbi">The FBI</h3><p>10 years ago, I certainly didn't see this on the cards:</p>

<blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">This is so cool, thanks <a href="https://twitter.com/FBI?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref=troyhunt.com">@FBI</a> üòä <a href="https://t.co/aqMi3as91O?ref=troyhunt.com">pic.twitter.com/aqMi3as91O</a></p>‚Äî Troy Hunt (@troyhunt) <a href="https://twitter.com/troyhunt/status/1674132801837477888?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref=troyhunt.com">June 28, 2023</a></blockquote> 

<p>Nor did I expect them to be <a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/open-source-pwned-passwords-with-fbi-feed-and-225m-new-nca-passwords-is-now-live/" rel="noreferrer">actively feeding data into HIBP</a>. Or the UK's NCA to be feeding data in. Or various other law enforcement agencies the world over. And I never envisioned a time where dozens of national governments would be happy to talk about using the service.</p><p>A couple of months ago, the ABC wrote a long piece on how this whole thing is, to use their term, <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2023-09-23/cybersecurity-troy-hunt-have-i-been-pwned-fighting-data-breaches/102803748?ref=troyhunt.com" rel="noreferrer">a strange sign of the times</a>.</p><blockquote>He‚Äôs just ‚Äúa dude on the web‚Äù, but Troy Hunt&nbsp;has ended up playing&nbsp;an oddly central role in&nbsp;global&nbsp;cybersecurity.</blockquote><figure><img src="https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2023/12/99e2645c477b37a47f0639e2c91ca9e6.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1126" srcset="https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/size/w600/2023/12/99e2645c477b37a47f0639e2c91ca9e6.jpg 600w, https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/size/w1000/2023/12/99e2645c477b37a47f0639e2c91ca9e6.jpg 1000w, https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/size/w1600/2023/12/99e2645c477b37a47f0639e2c91ca9e6.jpg 1600w, https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2023/12/99e2645c477b37a47f0639e2c91ca9e6.jpg 2150w"></figure><p>It's strange until you look at through the lens of aligned objectives: the whole idea of HIBP was "to do good things after bad things happen" which is well aligned with the mandates of law enforcement agencies. You could call it... common ground:</p>



<p>This is something I suspect a lot of people don't understand - that law enforcement agencies often work in conjunction with private enterprise to further their goals of protecting people just like you and me. It's something I certainly didn't understand 10 years ago, and I still remember the initial surprise when agencies started reaching out. Many years on, these have become really productive relationships with a bunch of top notch people, a number of whom I now count as friends and make an effort to spend time with on my travels.</p><h3 id="passwords">Passwords</h3><p>This was never on the cards originally. In fact, I'd always been adamant that there should never be passwords in HIBP although in my defence, the sentiment was that they should never appear <em>next to the username</em> to which they originally accompanied. But looking at passwords through the lens of how breach data can be used to do good things, a list of known compromised passwords disassociated from any form of PII made a lot of sense. So, in 2017, <a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/introducing-306-million-freely-downloadable-pwned-passwords/" rel="noreferrer">Pwned Passwords was born</a>. You know what I was saying earlier about things escalating quickly? Yeah:</p>

<blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Setting all new records for Pwned Passwords this week: biggest day ever yesterday at 282M requests and biggest rolling 30 days ever, now passing the 6 *billion* requests mark! <a href="https://t.co/dQiuQim3da?ref=troyhunt.com">pic.twitter.com/dQiuQim3da</a></p>‚Äî Troy Hunt (@troyhunt) <a href="https://twitter.com/troyhunt/status/1701473422335692997?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref=troyhunt.com">September 12, 2023</a></blockquote> 

<p>As if to make the point, I just checked the latest stats and last week we did 301.6M requests in a single day. 100% of those requests - and that's not a rounded number either, it's 100.0000000000% - were served from Cloudflare's cache ü§Ø</p><p>There's so much I love about this service. I love that it's free, there's no auth, it's entirely open source (both code and data), the FBI feeds data into it and perhaps most importantly, it has <em>real</em> impact on security. It's such a simple thing, but every time you see a headline such as "Big online website hit with credential stuffing attack", a significant portion of the accounts being taken over have passwords that could easily have been blocked.</p><h3 id="the-paradox-of-handling-data-breaches">The Paradox of Handling Data Breaches</h3><p>On multiple occasions now, I've had conversations that can best be paraphrased as follows:</p><p><strong>Random Internet Person:</strong> I'm going to report you to the FBI for having all that stolen data</p><p><strong>Me:</strong> Maybe you should start by Googling "troy hunt fbi" first...</p><p>But I understand where they're coming from and the paradox I refer to is the perceived conflict between handling what is usually the output of a crime whilst simultaneously trying to perform a community good. It's the same discussion I've often had with people citing privacy laws in their corner of the world (often the EU and GDPR) as the reason why HIBP shouldn't exist: "but you're processing data without informed consent!", they'll claim. The issue of there being other legal bases for processing aside, <em>nobody</em> consents to being in a data breach! The natural progression of that conversation is that being in a data breach is a parallel discussion to HIBP then indexing it and making it searchable, <a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/the-ethics-of-running-a-data-breach-search-service/" rel="noreferrer">which is something I've devoted many words to addressing in the past</a>.</p><p>But for all the bluster the occasional random internet person can have (and honestly, I could count the number of annual instances of this on one hand), nothing has come of any complaints. And when I say "complaints", it's often nothing more than a polite conversation which may simply conclude with an acknowledgment of opposing views and that's it. There has been <em>one</em> exception in the entire decade of running this service where a complaint did come via a government privacy regulator, I responded to all the questions that were asked and that was the end of it.</p><h3 id="people">People</h3><p>When you have a pet project like HIBP was in the beginning, it's usually just you putting in the hours. That's fine, it's a hobby and you're scratching an itch, so what does it matter that there's nobody else involved? Like many similar passion projects, HIBP consumed a lot of hours from early on, everything from obviously building the service then sourcing data breaches, verifying and disclosing them, writing up descriptions and even editing every single one of those 700+ logos by hand to be just the right dimensions and file size. But in the beginning, if I'd just stopped one day, what would happen? Nothing. But today, a genuinely important part of the internet that a huge number of individuals, corporations and governments have built dependencies on would stop working if I lost interest.</p><p>The dependency on just me was partly behind the possible sale in 2019, but clearly that didn't eventuate. There was always the option to employ people and build it out like most people would a normal company, but every time I gave that consideration it just didn't stack up for a whole bunch of reasons. It was certainly feasible from the perspective of building some sort of valuable commercial entity, but in just the same way as that question about my perfect day in the office sucked the soul from my body, so did the prospect of being responsible for other people. Employment contracts. Salary negotiations. Performance reviews. Sick leave and annual leave and all sorts of other people issues from strangers I'd need to entrust with "my baby". So, bringing in more people was a really unattractive idea, with 2 exceptions:</p><p>In early 2021, my (soon to be at the time) wife Charlotte started working for HIBP.</p><figure><img src="https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2023/12/CharlotteHunt.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy" width="400" height="284"></figure><p>Charlotte had spent the last 8 years working with people just like me; software nerds. As a project manager for the NDC conferences based out of Norway, she'd dealt with hundreds of speakers (including me on many occasions), and thousands of attendees at the best conference I've ever been a part of. Plus, she spent a great deal of time coordinating sponsors, corporate attendees and all sorts of other folks that live in the tech world HIBP inhabited. For Charlotte, even though she's not a technical person (her qualifications are in PR and entrepreneurial studies), this was very familiar territory.</p><p>So, for the last few years, Charlotte has done absolutely everything that she can to ensure that I can focus on the things that need my attention. She onboards new corporate subscribers, handles masses of tickets for API and domain subscribers and does all the accounting and tax work. And she does this tirelessly every single day at all sorts of hours whether we're at home or travelling. She is... amazing ü§©</p><p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://stebet.net/?ref=troyhunt.com" rel="noreferrer">Stef√°n J√∂kull Sigur√∞arson</a> started working for us part time writing code, cleaning up code, migrating code and, well, doing lots of different code things.</p><figure><img src="https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2023/12/Stef-nJ-kullSigur-arson.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy" width="400" height="276"></figure><p>Just today I asked Stef√°n&nbsp;what I should write about him, thinking he'd give me some bullet points I'd massage and then incorporate into this blog post. Instead, I reckon what he wrote was so spot on that I'm just going to quote the entire thing here:</p><blockquote>"Just" that having had my eye on the service since it was released and then developing one of the first big integrations with the PwnedPasswords v2 API in EVE, coinciding with us meeting for the first time at NDC Oslo in 2018 shortly after,&nbsp; HIBP has managed to take me on this awesome journey where it has been a part of launching my public speaking career, contributing to OSS with Pwned Passwords, becoming an MVP and helped me meet a bunch of awesome people and allowed me to contribute to a better and hopefully safer internet. I'm very happy and honoured to a be a part of this project which is full of awesome challenges and interesting problems to deal with. Having meeting invites from the FBI in my inbox a few years after doing a few experimental rest calls to the Pwned Passwords API in early 2018 was definitely not something I was expecting üòÖ</blockquote><p>What really resonated with me in Stef√°n's message is that for him, this isn't just a job, it's a passion. His journey is my journey in that we freely devoted our time to do something we love and it led to many wonderful things, including MVP roles and speaking at "Charlotte's" conference, NDC. Stef√°n&nbsp;is based in Iceland, but we've still had many opportunities to share beers together and establish a relationship that transcends merely writing code. I can't think of anyone better to do what he does today.</p><h2 id="breaches">Breaches</h2><p>731 breaches later, here we are. So, what stands out? Just going off the top of my head here:</p><p><strong>Ashley Madison.</strong> Every knows the name so it needs no introduction, but that incident in 2015 had a major impact on HIBP in terms of use of the service, and also a major impact on me in terms of the engagements I had with impacted parties. My blog post on <a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/heres-what-ashley-madison-members-have/" rel="noreferrer">Here‚Äôs what Ashley Madison members have told me</a> still feels harrowing to read.</p><p><strong>Collection #1.</strong> This is the one that really contributed to my stress levels in early 2019 and had a profound impact on my decision to look at selling the service. <a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/the-773-million-record-collection-1-data-reach/" rel="noreferrer">Read about where those 773M records came from</a> (still the largest breach in HIBP to date).</p><p><strong>Rosebutt.</strong> Don't make a joke about it, don't make a joke about it, don't... aw man, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160512105342/http://www.theregister.co.uk/2016/05/11/embarassing_data_breach/" rel="noreferrer">thanks The Register!</a> (link to an archive.org version as they seem to have thought better of their image choice later on...) The point is that even serious data breaches can have their moments of levity.</p><p><strong>Shit Express.</strong> Sometimes, you just need a bit of hilarity in your data breach. Shit Express is literally a site to send other people pieces of that - <em>anonymously </em>- <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/anonymous-poop-gifting-site-hacked-customers-exposed/?ref=troyhunt.com" rel="noreferrer">and they got breached</a>, thus somewhat affecting their anonymity. The more serious point is that as I later wrote, <a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/safe-secure-anonymous-and-other-misleading-claims/" rel="noreferrer">claims of anonymity are often highly misleading</a>.</p><h2 id="future">Future</h2><p>I often joke about my life being very much about getting up each morning, reading my emails and events from overnight and then just winging it from there. Of course there are the occasional scheduled things not to mention travel commitments, but for the most part it's very much just rolling with whatever is demanding attention on the day. This is also probably a significant part of why I don't really want to see this thing grow into a larger concern with more responsibilities, I just don't want to lose that freedom. Yet...</p><p>We're gradually moving in a direction where things become more formalised. 3 years ago, I did 100% of everything myself. 1 year ago, I did everything technical myself. 6 months ago, we had no ticketing system for support. But these are small, incremental steps forward and that's what I'd like to see continuing. I want HIBP to outlive me, I just don't want it to become a burden I'm beholden to in the process. I'd like to have more people involved but as you can see from above, that's been a very slow process with only those very close to me playing a role.</p><p>The only thing I have real certainty on at the moment is that there will be more breaches. I've commented many times recently that the scourge that is ransomware feels like it's really accelerated lately, I wonder how many of the people in the emails and documents and all sorts of other data that get dumped there ever learn of their exposure? It's a non-trivial exercise to index that (for all sorts of reasons), but it also seems like an increasingly worthy exercise. Who knows, let's see how I feel when I get up tomorrow morning üôÇ</p><p>Finally, for this week's regular video, I'm going to make a birthday special and do it live with Charlotte. Please come and join us, I'm not entirely sure what we'll cover (I'll work it out on the morning!) but let's make a virtual 10th birthday party out of it üéÇ</p>

<p><strong>Harvard Gutted Initial Team Examining Facebook Files Following $500 Million Donation from Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, Whistleblower Aid Client Reveals</strong></p>



<p><em>University‚Äôs Former Disinformation Expert Joan Donovan Calls for Investigation</em><em>&nbsp;</em></p>



<p><strong>WASHINGTON, D.C.</strong> ‚Äì Harvard University dismantled its prestigious team of online disinformation experts after a foundation run by Facebook‚Äôs Mark Zuckerberg and his wife Priscilla Chan donated $500 million to the university, a <a href="http://whistlebloweraid.org/joan-donovan-disclosure-harvard-betrayed-academic-freedom-and-the-public-interest-to-protect-meta/">whistleblower disclosure</a> filed by Whistleblower Aid reveals.</p>



<p>Dr. Joan Donovan, one of the world‚Äôs leading experts on social media disinformation, says she ran into a wall of institutional resistance and eventual termination after she and her team at Harvard‚Äôs Technology and Social Change Research Project (TASC) began analyzing thousands of documents exposing Facebook‚Äôs knowledge of how the platform has caused significant public harm..</p>



<p>In her <a href="http://whistlebloweraid.org/joan-donovan-declaration-detailed-account-of-how-harvard-protected-meta-from-research-scrutiny">whistleblower declaration</a>, Donovan lays out in detail how she and her research team at Harvard‚Äôs Kennedy School (HKS) came under sudden scrutiny from the school‚Äôs dean, Douglas Elmendorf, and other Kennedy School leaders,<strong> </strong>after they started working on Haugen‚Äôs Facebook Files ‚Äì a cache Donovan describes as ‚Äúthe most important documents in the history of the internet.‚Äù</p>



<p>TASC rose in size, prominence, and resources under Dr. Donovan‚Äôs leadership ‚Äì and Dr. Donovan was elevated to Research Director of the Shorenstein Center for her success.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The importance and prestige of TASC‚Äôs work became irrelevant to Dean Elmendorf when in October 2021 Dr. Donovan announced she had lawfully received the Facebook Files at a HKS Dean‚Äôs Council meeting, which was attended by a Facebook PR executive who became irate when she discussed it. She intended to create a public archive with a collaborative platform, where participants could publish research and her team would host workshops for researchers and journalists on how to analyze the extensive trove of internal documents. Following the meeting, Dean Elmendorf began a two year campaign to purge Dr. Donovan, silence her voice, decrease her public profile, and stifle her team‚Äôs impactful research.</p>



<p>Suddenly her work became a threat to some of HKS‚Äôs most treasured donor relationships ‚Äì just as Harvard was finalizing the largest donation the school had ever received, $500 million from the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative in December 2021.</p>



<p>HKS leadership systematically rendered TASC mute with an escalating series of restrictions and bureaucratic hurdles designed to stop their work and the power of Dr. Donovan‚Äôs research findings to challenge Meta‚Äôs false public narratives. Harvard‚Äôs own code of conduct and commitment to academic freedom was trampled in the campaign to silence Dr. Donovan ‚Äì culminating in the dissolution of TASC and her termination this past summer.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Meta could not use any of its previously reported tactics to silence other researchers as Dr. Donovan‚Äôs research neither relies on access to their data nor would she accept any grants affiliated with any company she researches.</p>



<p>‚ÄúThe mood changed overnight. The work we were doing turned from a source of pride for Harvard into a source of shame,‚Äù wrote Dr. Donovan. ‚ÄúInstead of seizing on an extraordinary opportunity to further our knowledge of social media platforms and how they work hidden from public scrutiny, the university subjected my team and our projects to death by a thousand cuts.‚Äù&nbsp;</p>



<p>In sending the lawful whistleblower disclosure to the President and General Counsel of Harvard University, the U.S. Department of Education, and subsequently to the Massachusetts Attorney General‚Äôs Office, Dr. Donovan and Whistleblower Aid are calling for an urgent and impartial investigation into inappropriate influence at the Harvard Kennedy School.&nbsp;</p>



<p>‚ÄúThis is a shocking betrayal of Harvard‚Äôs academic integrity and the public interest,‚Äù said Libby Liu, CEO of Whistleblower Aid. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve seen in the past how Big Tobacco, Big Energy and Big Pharma have succeeded in influencing, undermining, and co-opting research to protect their lies, their profits and evade accountability. Now Meta, with the complicity of a powerful ally, is following the same playbook. Whether Harvard acted at the company‚Äôs direction or took the initiative on their own to protect Meta‚Äôs interests, the outcome is the same: corporate interests are undermining research and academic freedom to the detriment of the public.‚Äù</p>



<p>Dr. Donovan, now an Assistant Professor at Boston University, was hired by the Kennedy School in 2018 and served as the Director of TASC and was promoted to Research Director of the Shorenstein Center in early 2020. She lectured for several years on media manipulation and disinformation at HKS.</p>



<p>Alongside her team, Dr. Donovan set out to make sure the public, lawmakers, regulators, and academics could all analyze the Facebook Files, opening the doors to unprecedented and transparent public collaboration allowing for public accountability. Her team‚Äôs vision of a global research collaborative that openly analyzes the Facebook Files remains, to this day, largely unrealized.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At a time of unprecedented legal scrutiny of Meta by both <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/10/24/meta-lawsuit-facebook-instagram-children-mental-health/">states</a> and the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2023/11/28/ftc-notches-legal-win-privacy-fight-with-meta/">Federal Trade Commission</a>, Meta has benefited tremendously from the curtailing, delaying, and undermining of this research by the Kennedy School leadership.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This case represents a watershed opportunity for lawmakers, regulators, and academia to address the pervasive and detrimental tactics deployed by powerful and wealthy interests like Big Tech to influence vital public interest research. The inadequate safeguards that exist in law, regulation, practice, and academic integrity by universities require meaningful reform.&nbsp;</p>



<p>‚ÄúIf the most powerful university in the world cannot safeguard the integrity of public interest research in the face of corporate influence-buying, what hope is there for any other research institution?‚Äù Libby Liu said. ‚ÄúWhat hope is there for rank and file academics seeking to pursue the truth and hold power to account?‚Äù&nbsp;</p>



<p>###</p>



<p>Whistleblower Aid is a non-profit legal organization in Washington, D.C. supporting individuals who lawfully report government and corporate law breaking. It provides assistance to individuals in the United States and abroad seeking to disclose illegal conduct, including misconduct relating to government officials, securities fraud, sexual violence, and violations of tax, labor or environmental laws. In recent years Whistleblower Aid lawyers have represented Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen and the intelligence community whistleblower whose disclosures led to the first impeachment of President Trump.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="post-68156">

	<div>

		
		<p>I trusted a lot today. I trusted my phone to wake me on time. I trusted Uber to arrange a taxi for me, and the driver to get me to the airport safely. I trusted thousands of other drivers on the road not to ram my car on the way. At the airport, I trusted ticket agents and maintenance engineers and everyone else who keeps airlines operating. And the pilot of the plane I flew in. And thousands of other people at the airport and on the plane, any of which could have attacked me. And all the people that prepared and served my breakfast, and the entire food supply chain‚Äîany of them could have poisoned me. When I landed here, I trusted thousands more people: at the airport, on the road, in this building, in this room. And that was all before 10:30 this morning.</p>
<p>Trust is essential to society. Humans as a species are trusting. We are all sitting here, mostly strangers, confident that nobody will attack us. If we were a roomful of chimpanzees, this would be impossible. We trust many thousands of times a day. Society can‚Äôt function without it. And that we don‚Äôt even think about it is a measure of how well it all works.</p>
<p>In this talk, I am going to make several arguments. One, that there are two different kinds of trust‚Äîinterpersonal trust and social trust‚Äîand that we regularly confuse them. Two, that the confusion will increase with artificial intelligence. We will make a fundamental category error. We will think of AIs as friends when they‚Äôre really just services. Three, that the corporations controlling AI systems will take advantage of our confusion to take advantage of us. They will not be trustworthy. And four, that it is the role of government to create trust in society. And therefore, it is their role to create an environment for trustworthy AI. And that means regulation. Not regulating AI, but regulating the organizations that control and use AI.</p>
<p>Okay, so let‚Äôs back up and take that all a lot slower. Trust is a complicated concept, and the word is overloaded with many meanings. There‚Äôs personal and intimate trust. When we say that we trust a friend, it is less about their specific actions and more about them as a person. It‚Äôs a general reliance that they will behave in a trustworthy manner. We trust their intentions, and know that those intentions will inform their actions. Let‚Äôs call this ‚Äúinterpersonal trust.‚Äù</p>
<p>There‚Äôs also the less intimate, less personal trust. We might not know someone personally, or know their motivations‚Äîbut we can trust their behavior. We don‚Äôt know whether or not someone wants to steal, but maybe we can trust that they won‚Äôt. It‚Äôs really more about reliability and predictability. We‚Äôll call this ‚Äúsocial trust.‚Äù It‚Äôs the ability to trust strangers.</p>
<p>Interpersonal trust and social trust are both essential in society today. This is how it works. We have mechanisms that induce people to behave in a trustworthy manner, both interpersonally and socially. This, in turn, allows others to be trusting. Which enables trust in society. And that keeps society functioning. The system isn‚Äôt perfect‚Äîthere are always going to be untrustworthy people‚Äîbut most of us being trustworthy most of the time is good enough.</p>
<p>I wrote about this in 2012 in a book called <a href="https://www.schneier.com/books/liars-and-outliers/"><em>Liars and Outliers</em></a>. I wrote about four systems for enabling trust: our innate morals, concern about our reputations, the laws we live under, and security technologies that constrain our behavior. I wrote about how the first two are more informal than the last two. And how the last two scale better, and allow for larger and more complex societies. They enable cooperation amongst strangers.</p>
<p>What I didn‚Äôt appreciate is how different the first and last two are. Morals and reputation are person to person, based on human connection, mutual vulnerability, respect, integrity, generosity, and a lot of other things besides. These underpin interpersonal trust. Laws and security technologies are systems of trust that force us to act trustworthy. And they‚Äôre the basis of social trust.</p>
<p>Taxi driver used to be one of the country‚Äôs most dangerous professions. Uber changed that. I don‚Äôt know my Uber driver, but the rules and the technology lets us both be confident that neither of us will cheat or attack each other. We are both under constant surveillance and are competing for star rankings.</p>
<p>Lots of people write about the difference between living in a high-trust and a low-trust society. How reliability and predictability make everything easier. And what is lost when society doesn‚Äôt have those characteristics. Also, how societies move from high-trust to low-trust and vice versa. This is all about social trust.</p>
<p>That literature is important, but for this talk the critical point is that social trust scales better. You used to need a personal relationship with a banker to get a loan. Now it‚Äôs all done algorithmically, and you have many more options to choose from.</p>
<p>Social trust scales better, but embeds all sorts of bias and prejudice. That‚Äôs because, in order to scale, social trust has to be structured, system- and rule-oriented, and that‚Äôs where the bias gets embedded. And the system has to be mostly blinded to context, which removes flexibility.</p>
<p>But that scale is vital. In today‚Äôs society we regularly trust‚Äîor not‚Äîgovernments, corporations, brands, organizations, groups. It‚Äôs not so much that I trusted the particular pilot that flew my airplane, but instead the airline that puts well-trained and well-rested pilots in cockpits on schedule. I don‚Äôt trust the cooks and waitstaff at a restaurant, but the system of health codes they work under. I can‚Äôt even describe the banking system I trusted when I used an ATM this morning. Again, this confidence is no more than reliability and predictability.</p>
<p>Think of that restaurant again. Imagine that it‚Äôs a fast food restaurant, employing teenagers. The food is almost certainly safe‚Äîprobably safer than in high-end restaurants‚Äîbecause of the corporate systems or reliability and predictability that is guiding their every behavior.</p>
<p>That‚Äôs the difference. You can ask a friend to deliver a package across town. Or you can pay the Post Office to do the same thing. The former is interpersonal trust, based on morals and reputation. You know your friend and how reliable they are. The second is a service, made possible by social trust. And to the extent that is a reliable and predictable service, it‚Äôs primarily based on laws and technologies. Both can get your package delivered, but only the second can become the global package delivery systems that is FedEx.</p>
<p>Because of how large and complex society has become, we have replaced many of the rituals and behaviors of interpersonal trust with security mechanisms that enforce reliability and predictability‚Äîsocial trust.</p>
<p>But because we use the same word for both, we regularly confuse them. And when we do that, we are making a category error.</p>
<p>And we do it all the time. With governments. With organizations. With systems of all kinds. And especially with corporations.</p>
<p>We might think of them as friends, when they are actually services. Corporations are not moral; they are precisely as immoral as the law and their reputations let them get away with.</p>
<p>So corporations regularly take advantage of their customers, mistreat their workers, pollute the environment, and lobby for changes in law so they can do even more of these things.</p>
<p>Both language and the laws make this an easy category error to make. We use the same grammar for people and corporations. We imagine that we have personal relationships with brands. We give corporations some of the same rights as people.</p>
<p>Corporations like that we make this category error‚Äîsee, I just made it myself‚Äîbecause they profit when we think of them as friends. They use mascots and spokesmodels. They have social media accounts with personalities. They refer to themselves like they are people.</p>
<p>But they are not our friends. Corporations are not capable of having that kind of relationship.</p>
<p>We are about to make the same category error with AI. We‚Äôre going to think of them as our friends when they‚Äôre not.</p>
<p>A lot has been written about AIs as existential risk. The worry is that they will have a goal, and they will work to achieve it even if it harms humans in the process. You may have read about the ‚Äú<a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/artificial-intelligence-oxford_n_5689858">paperclip maximizer</a>‚Äú: an AI that has been programmed to make as many paper clips as possible, and ends up destroying the earth to achieve those ends. It‚Äôs a weird fear. Science fiction author Ted Chiang writes about it. Instead of solving all of humanity‚Äôs problems, or wandering off proving mathematical theorems that no one understands, the AI single-mindedly pursues the goal of maximizing production. Chiang‚Äôs point is that this is every corporation‚Äôs business plan. And that our fears of AI are basically fears of capitalism. Science fiction writer Charlie Stross takes this one step further, and calls corporations ‚Äú<a href="https://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/2018/01/dude-you-broke-the-future.html">slow AI</a>.‚Äù They are profit maximizing machines. And the most successful ones do whatever they can to achieve that singular goal.</p>
<p>And near-term AIs will be controlled by corporations. Which will use them towards that profit-maximizing goal. They won‚Äôt be our friends. At best, they‚Äôll be useful services. More likely, they‚Äôll spy on us and try to manipulate us.</p>
<p>This is nothing new. Surveillance is the business model of the Internet. Manipulation is the other business model of the Internet.</p>
<p>Your Google search results lead with URLs that someone paid to show to you. Your Facebook and Instagram feeds are filled with sponsored posts. Amazon searches return pages of products whose sellers paid for placement.</p>
<p>This is how the Internet works. Companies spy on us as we use their products and services. Data brokers buy that surveillance data from the smaller companies, and assemble detailed dossiers on us. Then they sell that information back to those and other companies, who combine it with data they collect in order to manipulate our behavior to serve their interests. At the expense of our own.</p>
<p>We use all of these services as if they are our agents, working on our behalf. In fact, they are double agents, also secretly working for their corporate owners. We trust them, but they are not trustworthy. They‚Äôre not friends; they‚Äôre services.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs going to be no different with AI. And the result will be much worse, for two reasons.</p>
<p>The first is that these AI systems will be more relational. We will be conversing with them, using natural language. As such, we will naturally ascribe human-like characteristics to them.</p>
<p>This relational nature will make it easier for those double agents to do their work. Did your chatbot recommend a particular airline or hotel because it‚Äôs truly the best deal, given your particular set of needs? Or because the AI company got a kickback from those providers? When you asked it to explain a political issue, did it bias that explanation towards the company‚Äôs position? Or towards the position of whichever political party gave it the most money? The conversational interface will help hide their agenda.</p>
<p>The second reason to be concerned is that these AIs will be more intimate. One of the promises of generative AI is a personal digital assistant. Acting as your advocate with others, and as a butler with you. This requires an intimacy greater than your search engine, email provider, cloud storage system, or phone. You‚Äôre going to want it with you 24/7, constantly training on everything you do. You will want it to know everything about you, so it can most effectively work on your behalf.</p>
<p>And it will help you in many ways. It will notice your moods and know what to suggest. It will anticipate your needs and work to satisfy them. It will be your therapist, life coach, and relationship counselor.</p>
<p>You will default to thinking of it as a friend. You will speak to it in natural language, and it will respond in kind. If it is a robot, it will look humanoid‚Äîor at least like an animal. It will interact with the whole of your existence, just like another person would.</p>
<p>The natural language interface is critical here. We are primed to think of others who speak our language as people. And we sometimes have trouble thinking of others who speak a different language that way. We make that category error with obvious non-people, like cartoon characters. We will naturally have a ‚Äútheory of mind‚Äù about any AI we talk with.</p>
<p>More specifically, we tend to assume that something‚Äôs implementation is the same as its interface. That is, we assume that things are the same on the inside as they are on the surface. Humans are like that: we‚Äôre people through and through. A government is systemic and bureaucratic on the inside. You‚Äôre not going to mistake it for a person when you interact with it. But this is the category error we make with corporations. We sometimes mistake the organization for its spokesperson. AI has a fully relational interface‚Äîit talks like a person‚Äîbut it has an equally fully systemic implementation. Like a corporation, but much more so. The implementation and interface are more divergent of anything we have encountered to date¬Öby a lot.</p>
<p>And you will want to trust it. It will use your mannerisms and cultural references. It will have a convincing voice, a confident tone, and an authoritative manner. Its personality will be optimized to exactly what you like and respond to.</p>
<p>It will act trustworthy, but it will not be trustworthy. We won‚Äôt know how they are trained. We won‚Äôt know their secret instructions. We won‚Äôt know their biases, either accidental or deliberate.</p>
<p>We do know that they are built at enormous expense, mostly in secret, by profit-maximizing corporations for their own benefit.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs no accident that these corporate AIs have a human-like interface. There‚Äôs nothing inevitable about that. It‚Äôs a design choice. It could be designed to be less personal, less human-like, more obviously a service‚Äîlike a search engine . The companies behind those AIs want you to make the friend/service category error. It will exploit your mistaking it for a friend. And you might not have any choice but to use it.</p>
<p>There is something we haven‚Äôt discussed when it comes to trust: power. Sometimes we have no choice but to trust someone or something because they are powerful. We are forced to trust the local police, because they‚Äôre the only law enforcement authority in town. We are forced to trust some corporations, because there aren‚Äôt viable alternatives. To be more precise, we have no choice but to entrust ourselves to them. We will be in this same position with AI. We will have no choice but to entrust ourselves to their decision-making.</p>
<p>The friend/service confusion will help mask this power differential. We will forget how powerful the corporation behind the AI is, because we will be fixated on the person we think the AI is.</p>
<p>So far, we have been talking about one particular failure that results from overly trusting AI. We can call it something like ‚Äúhidden exploitation.‚Äù There are others. There‚Äôs outright fraud, where the AI is actually trying to steal stuff from you. There‚Äôs the more prosaic mistaken expertise, where you think the AI is more knowledgeable than it is because it acts confidently. There‚Äôs incompetency, where you believe that the AI can do something it can‚Äôt. There‚Äôs inconsistency, where you mistakenly expect the AI to be able to repeat its behaviors. And there‚Äôs illegality, where you mistakenly trust the AI to obey the law. There are probably more ways trusting an AI can fail.</p>
<p>All of this is a long-winded way of saying that we need trustworthy AI. AI whose behavior, limitations, and training are understood. AI whose biases are understood, and corrected for. AI whose goals are understood. That won‚Äôt secretly betray your trust to someone else.</p>
<p>The market will not provide this on its own. Corporations are profit maximizers, at the expense of society. And the incentives of surveillance capitalism are just too much to resist.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs government that provides the underlying mechanisms for the social trust essential to society. Think about contract law. Or laws about property, or laws protecting your personal safety. Or any of the health and safety codes that let you board a plane, eat at a restaurant, or buy a pharmaceutical without worry.</p>
<p>The more you can trust that your societal interactions are reliable and predictable, the more you can ignore their details. Places where governments don‚Äôt provide these things are not good places to live.</p>
<p>Government can do this with AI. We need AI transparency laws. When it is used. How it is trained. What biases and tendencies it has. We need laws regulating AI‚Äîand robotic‚Äîsafety. When it is permitted to affect the world. We need laws that enforce the trustworthiness of AI. Which means the ability to recognize when those laws are being broken. And penalties sufficiently large to incent trustworthy behavior.</p>
<p>Many countries are contemplating AI safety and security laws‚Äîthe EU is the furthest along‚Äîbut I think they are making a critical mistake. They try to regulate the AIs and not the humans behind them.</p>
<p>AIs are not people; they don‚Äôt have agency. They are built by, trained by, and controlled by people. Mostly for-profit corporations. Any AI regulations should place restrictions on those people and corporations. Otherwise the regulations are making the same category error I‚Äôve been talking about. At the end of the day, there is always a human responsible for whatever the AI‚Äôs behavior is. And it‚Äôs the human who needs to be responsible for what they do‚Äîand what their companies do. Regardless of whether it was due to humans, or AI, or a combination of both. Maybe that won‚Äôt be true forever, but it will be true in the near future. If we want trustworthy AI, we need to require trustworthy AI controllers.</p>
<p>We already have a system for this: fiduciaries. There are areas in society where trustworthiness is of paramount importance, even more than usual. Doctors, lawyers, accountants‚Ä¶these are all trusted agents. They need extraordinary access to our information and ourselves to do their jobs, and so they have additional legal responsibilities to act in our best interests. They have fiduciary responsibility to their clients.</p>
<p>We need the same sort of thing for our data. The idea of a data fiduciary is not new. But it‚Äôs even more vital in a world of generative AI assistants.</p>
<p>And we need one final thing: public AI models. These are systems built by academia, or non-profit groups, or government itself, that can be owned and run by individuals.</p>
<p>The term ‚Äúpublic model‚Äù has been thrown around a lot in the AI world, so it‚Äôs worth detailing what this means. It‚Äôs not a corporate AI model that the public is free to use. It‚Äôs not a corporate AI model that the government has licensed. It‚Äôs not even an open-source model that the public is free to examine and modify.</p>
<p>A public model is a model built by the public for the public. It requires political accountability, not just market accountability. This means openness and transparency paired with a responsiveness to public demands. It should also be available for anyone to build on top of. This means universal access. And a foundation for a free market in AI innovations. This would be a counter-balance to corporate-owned AI.</p>
<p>We can never make AI into our friends. But we can make them into trustworthy services‚Äîagents and not double agents. But only if government mandates it. We can put limits on surveillance capitalism. But only if government mandates it.</p>
<p>Because the point of government is to create social trust. I started this talk by explaining the importance of trust in society, and how interpersonal trust doesn‚Äôt scale to larger groups. That other, impersonal kind of trust‚Äîsocial trust, reliability and predictability‚Äîis what governments create.</p>
<p>To the extent a government improves the overall trust in society, it succeeds. And to the extent a government doesn‚Äôt, it fails.</p>
<p>But they have to. We need government to constrain the behavior of corporations and the AIs they build, deploy, and control. Government needs to enforce both predictability and reliability.</p>
<p>That‚Äôs how we can create the social trust that society needs to thrive.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><main id="content"><div><p>by <a href="https://dnikub.dev/">Daniela Kubesch</a> published on <time datetime="2023-12-04">Dec 04, 2023</time></p><p>In the fast-paced world of web development, it's easy to get caught up in the latest frameworks, libraries and cutting-edge technologies. But sometimes, the most impactful improvements come from revisiting the fundamentals.</p><p>In this blog post, I'll guide you through five HTML attributes that not only improve accessibility but also enhance the overall user experience. Whether you are an experienced developer or just starting, let's explore the potential of these elements to create a more inclusive web experience.</p><h2 id="1-hreflang">1. hreflang</h2><p>The <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2014/REC-html5-20141028/links.html#attr-hyperlink-hreflang"><code>hreflang</code> attribute</a> <strong>specifies the language of a linked resource</strong> on an <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> element. It works like the <code>lang</code> attribute but is specifically used for links.</p><h3 id="why-use-hreflang?">Why use <code>hreflang</code>?</h3><p>You can improve the user experience and SEO by using <code>hreflang</code> for both internal and external site links.<br>Using <code>hreflang</code> on internal website links provides a way to tell search engines about different variations of a page for other languages or regions. This means that English speakers would receive the English version of the site, while Swedish speakers would receive the Swedish version. There is no need for manual switching on the user's end, resulting in a smoother experience.</p><h3 id="how-to-use-hreflang">How to use <code>hreflang</code></h3><p>Add the <code>hreflang</code> attribute with the needed <a href="https://www.iana.org/assignments/language-subtag-registry/language-subtag-registry">ISO language code</a> to your <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element. For an English website, this would be <code>en</code>.</p><pre><code><span><span><span><span>&lt;</span>a</span> <span>href</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>https://example.com<span>"</span></span> <span>hreflang</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>en<span>"</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span>English Website<span><span><span>&lt;/</span>a</span><span>&gt;</span></span></span></code></pre><p>You can also be more specific with the language code and use regional variations. For example, we can add <code>en-GB</code> for British English.</p><pre><code><span><span><span><span>&lt;</span>a</span> <span>href</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>https://example.at<span>"</span></span> <span>hreflang</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>en-GB<span>"</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span>English Website<span><span><span>&lt;/</span>a</span><span>&gt;</span></span></span></code></pre><p>If your website is available in multiple languages, you can use <code>hreflang</code> to specify the language and region of a document associated with a specific URL. Adding the attribute will help search engines understand the language and regional targeting of different web page versions.</p><p>Add <code>hreflang</code> with the required language code to each link. One link should act as the default fallback version, identifiable by adding <code>hreflang="x-default"</code> instead of the language code. Lastly, set the value of the <code>rel</code> attribute to <code>"alternate"</code> for each link in the language switcher to indicate that the linked pages are alternatives to the present page.</p><pre><code><span><span><span><span>&lt;</span>link</span> <span>href</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>https://example.com<span>"</span></span> <span>rel</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>alternate<span>"</span></span> <span>hreflang</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>x-default<span>"</span></span> <span>/&gt;</span></span></span><br><span><span><span><span>&lt;</span>link</span> <span>href</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>https://example.com/de<span>"</span></span> <span>rel</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>alternate<span>"</span></span> <span>hreflang</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>de<span>"</span></span> <span>/&gt;</span></span></span></code></pre><p>You can also use <code>hreflang</code> in your language switcher.</p><pre><code><span><span><span><span>&lt;</span>a</span> <span>href</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>https://example.com<span>"</span></span> <span>hreflang</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>x-default<span>"</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span>English<span><span><span>&lt;/</span>a</span><span>&gt;</span></span></span><br><span><span><span><span>&lt;</span>a</span> <span>href</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>https://example.com/de<span>"</span></span> <span>hreflang</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>de<span>"</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span>German<span><span><span>&lt;/</span>a</span><span>&gt;</span></span></span></code></pre><p>Sometimes, language switchers use link text in the language they are switching to. You can indicate this by additionally using the <code>lang</code> attribute.</p><pre><code><span><span><span><span>&lt;</span>a</span> <span>href</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>https://example.com<span>"</span></span> <span>hreflang</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>x-default<span>"</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span>English<span><span><span>&lt;/</span>a</span><span>&gt;</span></span></span><br><span><span><span><span>&lt;</span>a</span> <span>href</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>https://example.com/de<span>"</span></span> <span>hreflang</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>de<span>"</span></span> <span>lang</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>de<span>"</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span>Deutsch<span><span><span>&lt;/</span>a</span><span>&gt;</span></span></span></code></pre><p><strong>Note:</strong> Adding the <code>lang</code> attribute is particularly important for assistive technology users. For instance, screen readers alter their voice and pronunciation based on the language attribute.</p><p>An additional way to enhance accessibility is to include <code>aria-current="true"</code> to the presently active link.</p><pre><code><span><span><span><span>&lt;</span>a</span> <span>href</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>https://example.com<span>"</span></span> <span>hreflang</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>x-default<span>"</span></span> <span>aria-current</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>true<span>"</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span>English<span><span><span>&lt;/</span>a</span><span>&gt;</span></span></span><br><span><span><span><span>&lt;</span>a</span> <span>href</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>https://example.com/de<span>"</span></span> <span>hreflang</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>de<span>"</span></span> <span>lang</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>de<span>"</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span>Deutsch<span><span><span>&lt;/</span>a</span><span>&gt;</span></span></span></code></pre><h2 id="2-translate">2. translate</h2><p>The <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/dom.html#attr-translate"><code>translate</code> attribute</a> is used to <strong>indicate whether an element should be translated</strong> or not.</p><h3 id="why-use-translate?">Why use <code>translate</code>?</h3><p>Most website text is translatable by default (with some exceptions such as text on images or within SVGs). Translation tools, such as Google Translate, may suggest translation of page contents if the site's defined language differs from the browser's default language.

    <div itemprop="text">
                                                            <p><i><span>Earlier today, CEO <strong>Daniel Ek</strong> shared the following note about the company‚Äôs organizational changes with all Spotify employees.</span></i></p>
<p><span>Team,&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Over the last two years, we‚Äôve put significant emphasis on building Spotify into a truly great and sustainable business ‚Äì one designed to achieve our goal of being the world‚Äôs </span><span>leading audio company</span> <span>and</span><span> one that will consistently drive profitability and growth into the future. While we‚Äôve made worthy strides, as I‚Äôve shared many times, we still have work to do. </span><span>Economic growth has slowed dramatically and capital has become more expensive. Spotify is not an exception to these realities.</span></p>
<p><span>This brings me to a decision that will mean a significant step change for our company. To align Spotify with our future goals and ensure we are right-sized for the challenges ahead, I have made the difficult decision to reduce our total headcount by approximately 17% across the company. I recognize this will impact a number of individuals who have made valuable contributions. To be blunt, many smart, talented and hard-working people will be departing us.</span></p>
<p><span>For those leaving, we‚Äôre a better company because of your dedication and hard work. Thank you for sharing your talents with us. I hope you know that your contributions have impacted more than half a billion people and millions of artists, creators, and authors around the world in profound ways.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I realize that for many, a reduction of this size will feel surprisingly large given the recent positive earnings report and our performance. We debated making smaller reductions throughout 2024 and 2025. Yet, considering the gap between our financial goal state and our current operational costs, I decided that a substantial action to rightsize our costs was the best option to accomplish our objectives. While I am convinced this is the right action for our company, I also understand it will be incredibly painful for our team.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To understand this decision, I think it is important to assess Spotify with a clear, objective lens. In 2020 and 2021, we took advantage of the opportunity presented by lower-cost capital and invested significantly in team expansion, content enhancement, marketing, and new verticals. These investments generally worked, contributing to Spotify‚Äôs increased output and the platform‚Äôs robust growth this past year. However, we now find ourselves in a very different environment. And despite </span><span>our efforts to reduce costs this past year, our cost structure for where we need to be is still too big.</span></p>
<p><span>When we look back on 2022 and 2023, it has truly been impressive what we have accomplished. But, at the same time, the reality is much of this output was linked to having more resources. By most metrics, we were more productive but less efficient. We need to be both. While we have done some work to mitigate this challenge and become more efficient in 2023, we still have a ways to go before we are both productive and efficient. Today, we still have too many people dedicated to supporting work and even doing work around the work rather than contributing to opportunities with real impact. More people need to be focused on delivering for our key stakeholders ‚Äì creators and consumers. In two words, we have to become </span><span>relentlessly resourceful</span><span>.</span></p>
<p><span>I know you will all be anxious to hear the next steps about how this process will work. If you are an impacted employee, you will receive a calendar invite within the next two hours from HR for a one-on-one conversation. These meetings will take place before the end of the day on Tuesday, and while <strong>Katarina</strong> will provide more detail on all of the specifics, please know the following will apply to all of these bandmates:</span></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><i><span>Severance pay: </span></i><span>We will start with a baseline for all employees, with the average employee receiving approximately five months of severance. This will be calculated based on local notice period requirements and employee tenure.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><i><span>PTO:</span></i><span> All accrued and unused vacation will be paid out to any departing employee.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><i><span>Healthcare:</span></i><span> We will continue to cover healthcare for employees during their severance period.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><i><span>Immigration support:</span></i><span> For employees whose immigration status is connected with their employment, HRBPs are working with each impacted individual in concert with our mobility team.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><i><span>Career Support:</span></i> <i><span>&nbsp;</span></i><span>All employees will be eligible for outplacement services for two months.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>For the team that will remain at Spotify, I know this decision will be difficult for many. Please know we are focused on treating our impacted colleagues with the respect and compassion they deserve.</span></p>
<h2><b>Looking Ahead</b></h2>
<p><span>The decision to reduce our team size is a hard but crucial step towards forging a stronger, more efficient Spotify for the future. But it also highlights that we need to change how we work. In Spotify‚Äôs early days, our success was hard won. We had limited resources and had to make the most of every asset. Our ingenuity and creativity were what set us apart. As we‚Äôve grown, we‚Äôve moved too far away from this core principle of resourcefulness.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The Spotify of tomorrow must be defined by being relentlessly resourceful in the ways we operate, innovate, and tackle problems. This kind of resourcefulness transcends the basic definition ‚Äì it‚Äôs about preparing for our next phase, where being lean is not just an option but a necessity.</span></p>
<p><span>Embracing this leaner structure will also allow us to invest our profits more strategically back into the business. With a more targeted approach, every investment and initiative becomes more impactful, offering greater opportunities for success. This is not a step back; it‚Äôs a strategic reorientation. We‚Äôre still committed to investing and making bold bets, but now, with a more focused approach, ensuring Spotify‚Äôs continued profitability and ability to innovate. Lean doesn‚Äôt mean small ambitions; it means smarter, more impactful paths to achieve them.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Today is a difficult but important day for the company. To be very clear, my commitment to our mission and belief in our ability to achieve it has never been stronger. I hope you will join me on Wednesday for Unplugged to discuss how we move forward together. A reduction of this size will make it necessary to change the way we work, and we will share much more about what this will mean in the days and weeks ahead. Just as 2023 marked a new chapter for us, so will 2024 as we build an even stronger Spotify.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>‚Äì Daniel</span></p>

The award, which he shares with his friend and collaborator Jeffrey C. Hall and Michael W.

From the Latin circa, ‚Äúaround‚Äù and dies, ‚Äúday,‚Äù circadian rhythms are the 24-hour changes in our physiology that synchronize with the day-night cycle and modulate when we are hungry, sleepy, want sex and have asthma attacks or a fever in the afternoon.</p><p>Bacteria, plants and biomedical research‚Äôs most popular insect, the <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> or fruit fly‚Äîthe basis of Rosbash‚Äôs findings‚Äîalso have biological clocks. On November 13, wearing a tie with Santiago Ram√≥n y Cajal‚Äôs neuronal designs, the chronobiologist gave a lecture for young researchers, at the Madrid hospital named for the Spanish Nobel Prize winner, now celebrating two decades of its research foundation (FIBioHRC). The event took place within the framework of the <a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel-prize-inspiration-initiative/" target="_blank">Nobel Prize Inspiration</a> Initiative and in collaboration with the AstraZeneca Foundation, which arranged this interview with EL PA√çS in a nearby hotel.</p><p><b>Question</b>. During your Nobel Prize acceptance speech, you mentioned that 50% of our genes were regulated by circadian rhythms, but in your talk you said that it is at least 70%?</p><p><b>Answer</b>. I have updated the figure due to new research done over the past six years. The 50% figure came from research in rodents, but in 2019 there was a large study done on baboons, the first in primates, and [the figure] went to 70%.</p><p><b>Q</b>. How did you become interested in <a href="https://english.elpais.com/science-tech/2023-08-14/why-do-we-often-wake-up-just-before-the-alarm-goes-off.html">chronobiology</a>?</p><p><b>A</b>. [It began] almost 50 years ago, through my friend Jeffrey C. Hall, who also started as a professor at my university. He was already working on fly neurogenetics and knew about circadian rhythms. I had laboratory expertise that could be useful for his research. I suggested that we collaborate and see if that would go anywhere.</p><p><b>Q</b>. And you two have made it this far.</p><p><b>A</b>. To my surprise [smiles].</p><p><b>Q</b>. You have forged your career with basic research, which is sometimes undervalued. How would you encourage young researchers to explore it and institutions or companies to fund it?</p><p><b>A</b>. I tell young researchers that I hope they do something interesting and that they like it. Public funding agencies face the biggest challenge, because basic research is the foundation for applied research; it is very short-sighted to try to short-circuit the process by going directly to something translational. It is politically convenient because the public understands if you say you are going to cure <a href="https://english.elpais.com/science-tech/2023-07-07/azheimers-drug-leqembi-granted-full-fda-approval-paving-the-way-for-medicare-coverage.html">Alzheimer‚Äôs</a>, but if the foundations do not exist, it is money wasted. On the other hand, the pharmaceutical and biotech industries are very good at applied science. They make money and, when they see an opportunity, they go for it. I think public research organizations should focus on basic science, and industry should focus on applied science.</p><p><b>Q</b>. What links the circadian rhythms of flies, which have 100,000 neurons, and those of people, who have 86 billion?</p><p><b>A</b>. The basic process of keeping time. What happens in neurons is the same, although mammals have a larger number. From there, we try to use these neurons as a window into more general questions about brain science and behavior.</p><p><b>Q</b>. For example?</p><p><b>A</b>. Wiring. The general question is how animal brains carry out behavioral programs, how behavior works. Of course, a fruit fly performs simpler behaviors than we do and [is] simpler to investigate. So what is the program that enables complex behavior? We are making progress in appreciating how complex the circuits are at the anatomical level, even in the fly brain. It all has to do with the wiring, how the circuitry is designed to carry out a behavioral program.</p><figure><span><img alt="Michael Rosbash" decoding="auto" height="291" srcset="https://images.english.elpais.com/resizer/KEIB7gzSA0Z8VMQcncJT-GLvFgc=/414x0/filters:focal(1411x591:1421x601)/cloudfront-eu-central-1.images.arcpublishing.com/prisa/MFEO3HRUIZAMDOCM73D5YUNUUI.jpg 414w,https://images.english.elpais.com/resizer/w5kfpCLOZCxwttmkkR6ZrxJvt1E=/828x0/filters:focal(1411x591:1421x601)/cloudfront-eu-central-1.images.arcpublishing.com/prisa/MFEO3HRUIZAMDOCM73D5YUNUUI.jpg 640w,https://images.english.elpais.com/resizer/riaEPf0kAuE0wUP8-zZeM8KqpQg=/980x0/filters:focal(1411x591:1421x601)/cloudfront-eu-central-1.images.arcpublishing.com/prisa/MFEO3HRUIZAMDOCM73D5YUNUUI.jpg 1000w,https://images.english.elpais.com/resizer/wjwAC9RjP3x23Nu09QZltFiSmiI=/1960x0/filters:focal(1411x591:1421x601)/cloudfront-eu-central-1.images.arcpublishing.com/prisa/MFEO3HRUIZAMDOCM73D5YUNUUI.jpg 1960w" width="414" loading="lazy" src="https://images.english.elpais.com/resizer/KEIB7gzSA0Z8VMQcncJT-GLvFgc=/414x0/filters:focal(1411x591:1421x601)/cloudfront-eu-central-1.images.arcpublishing.com/prisa/MFEO3HRUIZAMDOCM73D5YUNUUI.jpg" sizes="(min-width:1199px) 1155px,(min-width:1001px) calc(100vw - 44px),(min-width:768px) 767px, 100vw"><svg viewBox="0 0 40 40"><use xlink:href="#svg-ampliar"></use></svg></span><figcaption><span>Nobel Laureate in Medicine Michael Rosbash, wearing a tie with Santiago Ram√≥n y Cajal‚Äôs neuronal designs. </span><span>Jaime Villanueva</span></figcaption></figure><p><b>Q</b>. One of the things that flies and privileged people have in common is napping and sleeping at night. What is the biological purpose of sleep and of these intermediate pauses during the day?</p><p><b>A</b>. We do not know. Memories are consolidated <a href="https://english.elpais.com/health/2023-11-30/why-do-sleep-attacks-occur-during-the-day.html">during sleep</a> and neuronal morphology is modified during sleep. All that happens, but I do not think that is the major purpose of sleep. We do not know what fly and human sleep, for example, have in common. My guess is that it is related to metabolism, such as recharging ATP [adenosine triphosphate, a key energy molecule in cells]. The brain is the largest consumer of ATP; perhaps there is a metabolic need for recharging.</p><p><b>Q</b>. <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.284.5423.2177" target="_blank">Our internal clock has a natural 24-and-a-quarter-hour cycle</a>. After millions of years here, why is it not set to 24 hours, and we have to synchronize daily?</p><p><b>A</b>. For humans, we don‚Äôt know, but there is information from other animals. Some, like sheep and rodents, are seasonal in terms of reproduction. Their physiology changes with the season, and the seasons are determined by the length of the day. To control their reproductive physiology, they compare the offset of their clocks with the length of the photoperiod, the amount of daylight, which varies throughout the year. That is, they use it as a measuring device, although this [explanation] is partly speculative.</p><p><b>Q</b>. How does electric light, which we even take to bed with us with our screens, contribute to chronodisruption?</p><p><b>A</b>. It is a problem, but it is difficult to estimate its severity. We are exposed to too much light at night and not enough during the day because indoor electric lighting is far inferior to sunlight. In fact, according to recent research, a lack of sunlight during the day is even worse than the presence of light at night. Many cases of sleep problems are cured by addressing these environmental factors.</p><p>On the other hand, research conducted in Colorado on people who camp out in nature for a couple of weeks found that they sleep better, go to bed when it gets dark and wake up earlier. There are also studies in Brazil comparing those who stayed in the jungle with those who moved to the city. They are like us, they sleep worse, they go to bed later; you can immediately see the change in pattern. All of them, like you and me, are slightly sleep deprived. If the lights go out in a seminar room at 4 p.m., half the audience is snoring right away. That does not happen with well-rested individuals. It‚Äôs a totally sleep-deprived culture.</p><p><b>Q</b>. You said you take your statins at night, when they are most effective. The time of day also influences the efficacy or adverse effects of antihypertensives, corticosteroids and <a href="https://english.elpais.com/health/2023-10-25/andres-cervantes-oncologist-innovative-cancer-drugs-have-similar-costs-regardless-of-their-benefit.html">chemotherapy</a>. Should we change the way they are prescribed?</p><p><b>A</b>. The short answer is yes. The more important question‚Äîas with almost everything in pharmacology and in life‚Äîis what is the cost-benefit analysis? For society, physicians and the pharmaceutical industry, what is gained versus what is lost by taking this into account? Giving chemotherapy for some cancers at 3 a.m. has worked better, but people don‚Äôt want to work at that hour. Until very convincing research is published, there is not going to be a significant change because there is so much inertia in everything we do.</p><p><b>Q</b>. <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanonc/article/PIIS1470-2045(19)30455-3/fulltext" target="_blank">According to the WHO cancer agency (IARC), shift work or night work is potentially carcinogenic.</a> What would you advise people with those jobs?</p><p><b>A</b>. The trick is to pretend that night is day and vice versa. If you do this very rigorously, you can avoid most problems because your body doesn‚Äôt know what is day and what is night. What matters is how much light comes in and when you eat. If there is no light and you keep the room dark for eight hours of sleep, you are not interrupted and you don‚Äôt eat during that period, your body doesn‚Äôt know the difference. The problem is interacting with your family, with the rest of the world.</p><p><b>Q</b>. Why does snacking at night <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6288903/" target="_blank">increase the risk of obesity and metabolic syndrome</a>?</p><p><b>A</b>. We don‚Äôt really understand why. One hypothesis has to do with our DNA damage repair systems, which are regulated by the circadian clock. Food contains a mixture of nutrients and toxins. Plants produce toxins to avoid being eaten, such as psoralen, which is abundant in celery. Snacking at night introduces toxins that, at that hour, our repair systems are not ready to eliminate. There is also speculation that the major epidemic of epithelial cancers, such as colon cancer, in the U.S. is because of this.</p><p><b>Q</b>. Is this related to time-restricted feeding, which follows the pattern of light and dark?</p><p><b>A</b>. That diet is not much different from avoiding snacking at night. No one knows why these patterns are beneficial, but metabolism changes depending on the time of day, so eating food in sync with circadian metabolic processes makes sense. If something is not too difficult or painful and it makes sense, why not do it?</p><p><b>Q</b>. Juan Antonio Madrid, one of the pioneers of chronobiology in Spain, poses this question to you: Would it be possible to address the chronodisruption that comes with aging by manipulating the molecular clock with drugs?</p><p><b>A</b>. I think so. Older flies have the same sleep pattern as older people, fragmented sleep: in the first four hours, sleep is solid and then they start waking up frequently. In young people, sleep also becomes lighter after a few hours, but not so much that they wake up. Why this happens is not well understood. To some extent, this goes back to the previous question, what is sleep for? The two things are almost certainly related.</p><p><i>Sign up for&nbsp;</i><a href="https://plus.elpais.com/newsletters/lnp/1/333/?lang=en"><i>our weekly newsletter</i></a><i>&nbsp;to get more English-language news coverage from EL PA√çS USA Edition</i></p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The properties of human memory have been investigated with several approaches, including clinical, psychological, and neuroimaging studies (<a href="#B34">Tulving, 2002</a>; <a href="#B33">Schacter et al., 2007</a>; <a href="#B21">Miyashita, 2019</a>). It remains to be elucidated how brain activations during retrieval processes are modulated by different encoding procedures, because it has been reported that retrieval performances on paired words became worse when the categorically similar target words were simultaneously encoded, suggesting the importance of the context-dependent encoding (<a href="#B26">Nairne, 2002</a>; <a href="#B12">Goh and Lu, 2012</a>). It is also possible that the manner with which specific information is encoded‚Äîe.g., whether by using a paper notebook, computer, or mobile device‚Äîmay affect retrieval processes. A recent behavioral study showed that students who took longhand notes performed better on conceptual questions than those who took notes on laptop computers (<a href="#B25">Mueller and Oppenheimer, 2014</a>). A reasonable explanation for this interesting finding would be that the use of a paper notebook enables users to summarize and reframe information in their own words for encoding, while the use of a laptop tends to encourage them to write down information more passively (i.e., more nearly verbatim). The former processes thus naturally ensure deeper and more solid encoding <i>via</i> the active process of making notes. Moreover, it has been reported that longhand note-taking enhanced the performance of students on recognition of memorized words, even though typing on a computer keyboard allowed greater speed (<a href="#B1">Arag√≥n-Mendiz√°bal et al., 2016</a>).</p>
<p>Another possible explanation for the superiority of longhand note-taking for conceptual understanding is related to the use of paper for writing/reading since a behavioral study reported the superiority of paper to computer screens in terms of reading comprehension (<a href="#B36">W√§stlund et al., 2005</a>; <a href="#B20">Mangen et al., 2013</a>). These studies indicated the importance of visual and tactile cues for perceiving <i>constant</i> physical sizes and spatial locations, because ‚Äúthe material substrate of paper provides physical, tactile, spatiotemporally fixed cues to the length of the text‚Äù (<a href="#B20">Mangen et al., 2013</a>). We hypothesized that the use of a paper notebook, together with longhand note-taking, would enhance both memory encoding and later retrieval processes that could then be investigated at the brain level. More specifically, the utilization of the paper likely enhances the processes of associating episodic (<i>what</i>) and spatial (<i>where</i>) information, especially in the hippocampus, given its well-established role in the integration of what/where/when information (<a href="#B4">Broadbent et al., 2004</a>; <a href="#B7">Eichenbaum, 2004</a>; <a href="#B5">Chadwick et al., 2010</a>).</p>
<p>To address this issue, we compared three groups of participants who used a paper notebook (Note), electronic tablet (Tablet), or smartphone (Phone) during the encoding phase. Participants in the Tablet group used a stylus pen, thereby controlling for the effects of longhand writing with a pen in the Note group. It should be noted that physical sizes and spatial locations of a document remain constant for a paper notebook, whereas they become variable on the display of a tablet or smartphone. Moreover, not only the physical interaction of the hand with the pen/paper during note-taking but the actual writing of notes relative to each page of the real paper provides more concrete encoding information, because that information can be easily erased and updated by new information on the physically same screen of a tablet or smartphone.</p>
<p>We asked participants to write down scheduled appointments, and then, after one hour during which they performed an interference task, we conducted a retrieval task in which we tested participants‚Äô recognition memory of those appointments (<a href="#F1">Figure 1</a>). We further hypothesized that the interaction with physical paper, rather than the mental editing/preparation of the notes or the physical act of handwriting, provides episodic and spatial information of notes relative to each page of real paper, together with visual/tactile information from the paper. These properties and cues of papers could help to retrieve specific information, and thus lead to increased activations in specified brain regions for the Note group, compared with the other groups using mobile devices lacking such processes.</p>

Recording and retrieval of schedule information. Participants first read dialogues (in Japanese), then extracted scheduled appointments contained in the dialogues, and wrote them down with a paper notebook (<i>Note</i> group), electronic tablet (<i>Tablet</i> group), or smartphone (<i>Phone</i> group). This procedure reproduces the daily making of to-do lists and naturally involves encoding processes. The upper panel shows a typical example (English translation) written by a participant. After an hour including an interference task, the participants were asked to answer questions about the appointments and reported their level of confidence in their answer to each question. The lower panel shows a typical trial in this retrieval task.</p>
</div> 


<p>It has been proposed that the hippocampus and the prefrontal cortex support complementary functions in episodic memory and that the bidirectional information flow between these regions may play a crucial role in integrating and consolidating individual information (<a href="#B23">Moscovitch et al., 2016</a>; <a href="#B8">Eichenbaum, 2017</a>). A previous functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study reported that episodic memory of a word or picture is related to a functional network that includes the left posterior precuneus and the left lateral prefrontal cortex (<a href="#B19">Lundstrom et al., 2003</a>). On the other hand, language function is critically involved in human episodic memory, and some language-related regions would be recruited during both memory encoding and retrieval. The left lateral premotor cortex (LPMC) and left opercular/triangular parts of the inferior frontal gyrus (F3op/F3t) are suggested to have central roles in syntactic processing, whereas the left angular/supramarginal gyri (AG/SMG) make a major contribution to lexical processing (<a href="#B31">Sakai, 2005</a>). Moreover, the right frontal cortex was identified as a supportive region for syntactic processing (<a href="#B17">Kinno et al., 2014</a>). Activations in these regions would be observed during memory retrieval because fMRI studies showed that the hippocampus and language-related regions involved in the encoding phase were also activated during the retrieval phase (<a href="#B30">Rugg et al., 2008</a>). The retrieval task we used critically involved episodic memory of scheduled appointments, and thus activations in these regions would be increased more for the Note group than the other groups.</p>
<h2>Materials and Methods</h2>
<h3>Participants</h3>
<p>University student volunteers (48 native Japanese speakers, 18 females) aged 18‚Äì29 years were openly recruited from multiple sources, including the University of Tokyo and Sophia University, as well as the participant pool of the NTT Data Institute of Management Consulting. The laterality quotient (LQ) was measured according to the Edinburgh inventory (<a href="#B27">Oldfield, 1971</a>); all participants but one were right-handed, and the exception was both-handed (LQ: ‚àí14). As stated above, the participants were divided into three groups: Note, Tablet, and Phone groups (<a href="#T1">Table 1</a>). These three groups were age- and LQ-matched (Kruskal‚ÄìWallis test, <i>p</i> &gt; 0.1), as well as gender-matched (Fisher‚Äôs exact test for count data, <i>p</i> = 0.17). Each participant first answered a questionnaire on their daily use of paper notebooks, electronic tablets, and smartphones for scheduling in an academic or personal context (seven-point scale for each). Based on this result, electronic tablet users were assigned to the Tablet group, and smartphone users (those on the highest scale for smartphone use) were assigned to either the Tablet or Phone group. To estimate short-term memory ability, we used the number-letter sequencing in the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale‚ÄîFourth Edition (<a href="#B6">Drozdick et al., 2012</a>), and the maximum length of memorized sequences was not significantly different among the three groups (<i>p</i> = 0.4). All participants in the Note group used paper notebooks for daily schedule management, whereas eight and seven participants in the Tablet and Phone groups, respectively, also used paper notebooks for that purpose. To control the experience and accustomedness of using paper notebooks for daily schedule management, these 15 participants (with eight females) were separately designated the <i>Device</i> group, which was used in behavioral and activation analyses.</p>

Basic data on participants.</p></div> 


<p>Before they participated in the study, the nature and possible consequences of the studies were explained to each participant and written informed consent was obtained afterward. None of the participants had a history of neurological or psychological disorders. Approval for the experiments was obtained from the institutional review board of the University of Tokyo, Komaba.</p>
<h3>Stimuli and Tasks</h3>
<p>Two sets of written dialogues between two or three persons (a set of dialogues on academic matters and a set on personal matters) were presented to the participants, who were asked to imagine that they were participating in those dialogues. There were seven daily scheduled appointments for the academic context and seven for the personal context (in February and March, respectively). While silently reading the dialogues, participants were asked to enter each of these appointments into a monthly calendar (<a href="#F1">Figure 1</a>, upper panel). The participants used either a paper notebook [Noritsu NOLTY Notebook (2017), size 20.6 √ó 17.6 cm<sup>2</sup> when opened], an electronic tablet [iPad Pro 10.5 inch (2017), screen size 21.4 √ó 16.1 cm<sup>2</sup> in landscape orientation], or a smartphone (Google Nexus 5 LG-D821, screen size 6.2 √ó 10.9 cm<sup>2</sup> in portrait orientation), where the paper notebook and electronic tablet were similar in physical layout (size and orientation). All three types of calendars had a day, week, and month view, but we used only the month view. In the case of the paper notebook and electronic tablet, appointments could only be viewed and edited individually in the relevant month (i.e., discrete views). In the smartphone, individual weeks could be viewed and edited by swiping continuously (i.e., continuous views). This difference was notable, in that schedule information would be encoded relative to the <i>spatial configuration</i> of one month (see <a href="#F1">Figure 1</a>) for the paper notebook and electronic tablet.</p>
<p>Regarding input methods, a four-color pen was used to write in the paper notebook [the use of color(s) was up to each participant], and a stylus pen was used to write on the electronic tablet with a free choice of multiple colors (without using a virtual keyboard). In the case of the smartphone, the text was written by either flick input with the finger(s) or by using a virtual keyboard. In Japanese, there are three types of characters (<i>hiragana</i>, <i>katakana</i>, and <i>kanji</i>; kanji basically consists of Chinese characters), and kana-kanji transformation is usually used for inputs in mobile devices and computers (kana-kanji transformation converts a limited number of hiragana to vast numbers of kanji by requiring users to select appropriate kanji from multiple candidates). The flick input utilizes a telephone keypad with a three by four layout, and one hiragana character can be selected by either tapping a keypad or flicking from a keypad to one of four directions (up, down, left, or right) to enter one of five hiragana characters sharing the same initial consonant.</p>
<p>We measured the time required by participants to write down the appointments, but we set no time limit. When the participants finished writing down, they were instructed to review the calendar for 30 s. Then, after the retention period for an hour including an interference task, participants were asked to recall those appointments in a retrieval task; the experimental purpose of writing down the appointments was not disclosed to them. The interference task involved listening comprehension; participants were informed that they would hear a story, and then be asked about its contents while lying in an MRI scanner. We used the first 6 min of a narrated version of a Japanese classic short story called ‚Äú<i>Ma-jutsu</i> (<i>Magic</i>)‚Äù (written by Ry≈´nosuke Akutagawa, narrated by Takeshi Sasaki, and published by Pan Rolling, Japan). This story was unfamiliar to all participants. The auditory stimuli were presented through a headphone and participants were not permitted to take notes while listening. Sixteen questions about the detailed contents of the story were displayed inside the scanner (two questions per run), and the participants pressed one of four buttons to select the right answer.</p>
<p>After a short break outside the scanner to adjust the time between the encoding and retrieval phases to 1 h, participants performed a retrieval task inside the scanner (<a href="#F1">Figure 1</a>, lower panel), in which 16 questions about detailed contents of the appointments were displayed (two questions per run). Out of the 16 questions, seven required recalling of the relationships between multiple appointments, one required the conversion from the date to the day of the week (using the spatial information of the calendar), and three required recalling from similar or confusing appointments. The remaining five questions were more straightforward and thus considered as the <i>easier</i> questions. In each trial, a question was presented with four choices, and the participants pressed a button to select the right answer within 10 s. After an interval of 1 s, participants reported their level of confidence (1‚Äì4 scale, 4 = very confident) for that answer by pressing one of four buttons within 2 s. These responses were used to assess the correctness of each participant‚Äôs self-evaluation, where the true positive rate vs. the false positive rate was plotted for each of the four levels of confidence. By connecting these plots, we obtained a receiver operating characteristics curve (<a href="#B9">Fawcett, 2006</a>), and we used the area under the curve (AUC) for this assessment (0 = perfectly wrong; 0.5 = no distinction; 1 = perfectly correct).</p>
<p>As a control condition, we added a 2-back task into the run with the retrieval task. In each trial of the 2-back task, two different non-words, each with three Japanese characters, were sequentially displayed (each for 2 s). These characters were randomly selected from those used in the retrieval tasks, where the same type of characters (either hiragana, katakana, or kanji) was presented in a block of trials. Then four choices were shown for 5 s with a new non-word to be remembered. The correct answer was the non-word that appeared 2-back before but in a different order of three characters. There were two to four continuous trials with button pressings in each block.</p>
<p>Each run consisted of three 2-back blocks and two retrieval task trials, in which a 2-back block always started first, and the 2-back blocks and retrieval task trials were alternated. As fMRI events, we estimated the 6-s memory retrieval phase [determined by response times (RTs)] and the subsequent 4-s <i>post hoc</i> period from each 10-s period of the retrieval task, as well as a 5-s event for the 2-back task. With regards to contrasts between events, we always applied an exclusive mask of negative activations for the control conditions (one-sample <i>t-test</i>, uncorrected <i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). During the scans, the participants wore earplugs and an eyeglass-like MRI-compatible display (resolution = 800 √ó 600 pixels, framerate = 60 fps; VisuaStim Digital, Resonance Technology Inc., Northridge, CA, USA). The stimuli were all presented in yellow letters on a black background. For fixation, a small red cross was shown at the center of the screen when a stimulus was not shown. The stimulus presentation and collection of behavioral data (accuracy and RTs) were controlled using the Presentation software package (Neurobehavioral Systems, Albany, CA, USA).</p>

<p>The MRI scans were conducted in a 3.0 T scanner (Signa HDxt; GE Healthcare, Milwaukee, WI, USA) with a bird-cage head coil. Each participant was in a supine position, and his or her head was immobilized inside the coil. As regards the structural images, high-resolution T1-weighted images of the whole brain (136 axial slices, 1 √ó 1 √ó 1 mm<sup>3</sup>) were acquired with a three-dimensional fast spoiled gradient-echo (3D FSPGR) acquisition [repetition time (TR) = 8.6 ms, echo time (TE) = 2.6 ms, flip angle (FA) = 25¬∞, field of view (FOV) = 256 √ó 256 mm<sup>2</sup>]. With respect to the time-series data of fMRI, we used a gradient-echo echo-planar imaging (EPI) sequence (TR = 2 s, TE = 30 ms, FA = 78¬∞, FOV = 192 √ó 192 mm<sup>2</sup>, resolution = 3 √ó 3 mm<sup>2</sup>). We scanned a set of 30 axial slices that were 3-mm thick with a 0.5-mm gap, covering the range of ‚àí38.5 to 66 mm from the line of the anterior commissure to the posterior commissure (AC-PC). In a single scanning run, we obtained 45 volumes and dropped the initial four volumes from analyses due to MR signal increases.</p>
<h3>fMRI Data Analyses</h3>
<p>The fMRI data were analyzed in a standard manner using SPM12 statistical parametric mapping software (Wellcome Trust Center for Neuroimaging<sup id="footnotesuper1"><a id="note1a"></a><a href="#note1">1</a></sup>; <a href="#B10">Friston et al., 1994</a>) implemented on MATLAB (Math Works, Natick, MA, USA). The acquisition timing of each slice was corrected using the middle slice (the 15th slice chronologically) as a reference for the functional images. We spatially realigned each volume to the first volume of consecutive runs, and a mean volume was obtained. We set the threshold of head movement during a single run as follows: within a displacement of 2 mm in any of the three directions, and a rotation of 1.4¬∞ around any of the three axes. These thresholds were empirically determined in our previous studies (<a href="#B16">Kinno et al., 2008</a>). If a run included one or several images over this threshold, we replaced the outlying image with an interpolated image, which was the average of the chronologically former and latter ones, and conducted the realignment procedure again. The realigned data were resliced every 3 mm using seventh-degree B-spline interpolation.</p>
<p>Each individual‚Äôs structural image was matched with the mean functional image generated during realignment. The resultant structural image was spatially normalized to the standard brain space as defined by the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) using the extended version of the unified segmentation algorithm with light regularization; this is a generative model that combines tissue segmentation, bias correction, and spatial normalization in a single model (<a href="#B2">Ashburner and Friston, 2005</a>). The resultant deformation field was applied to each realigned functional image to be spatially normalized with non-linear transformation. All normalized functional images were then smoothed by using an isotropic Gaussian kernel of 9 mm full-width at half maximum (FWHM). Low-frequency noise was removed by high-pass filtering at 1/128 Hz.</p>
<p>In the first-level analysis (i.e., the fixed-effects analysis within a participant), each participant‚Äôs hemodynamic responses were modeled for the following types of events: initial 2-back trials with encoding alone, other 2-back trials, 6-s memory retrieval phase of retrieval trials, and 4-s <i>post hoc</i> period of retrieval trials. These event types were separately set for each group. Each event was modeled with the boxcar function overlaid with a hemodynamic response function. To minimize the effects of head movement, the six realignment parameters obtained from preprocessing were included as a nuisance factor in a general linear model.</p>
<p>These modeled responses were then generated in a general linear model for each participant and used for the inter-subject comparison in a second-level analysis (i.e., the random-effects analysis for a group). To examine the activation of the regions in an unbiased manner, we adopted whole-brain analyses. For statistical analyses, a two-way ANOVA (group √ó event type) with <i>t</i>-tests was performed with three nuisance factors (age, gender, and laterality quotient), where the statistical threshold was set to family-wise error (FWE) corrected <i>p</i> &lt; 0.05 for the voxel level. For the anatomical identification of activated regions, essentially we used the Anatomical Automatic Labeling (AAL) method<sup id="footnotesuper2"><a id="note2a"></a><a href="#note2">2</a></sup> (<a href="#B35">Tzourio-Mazoyer et al., 2002</a>) and the labeled data as provided by Neuromorphometrics Inc.<sup id="footnotesuper3"><a id="note3a"></a><a href="#note3">3</a></sup>, under academic subscription. In addition to whole-brain analyses, we adopted analyses of each region of interest (ROI) by using the MarsBaR-toolbox<sup id="footnotesuper4"><a id="note4a"></a><a href="#note4">4</a></sup>, in which an ROI was taken from a cluster identified by the ‚Äúretrieval‚Äî2-back‚Äù contrast for all participants, which were further extracted with an AAL mask of each region.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<h3>Behavioral Results</h3>
<p>We first compared the amounts of time required to write down the scheduled appointments (i.e., the duration of schedule recording) among the Note, Tablet, and Phone groups, and we observed a significant difference by a one-way ANOVA (<i>F</i><sub>(2,45)</sub> = 6.5, <i>p</i> = 0.003; <a href="#F2">Figure 2A</a>). The duration was significantly shorter for the Note group compared to the Tablet and Phone groups combined (<i>t-test</i>, <i>t</i><sub>(46)</sub> = 3.2, <i>p</i> = 0.002). We also confirmed a significant difference between the Note and Device groups (<i>t</i><sub>(29)</sub> = 3.0, <i>p</i> = 0.003).</p>
<p>Relative to the chance level of 25% accuracy, the accuracy for the retrieval task was reliable and well below the ceiling level (<a href="#F2">Figure 2B</a>). The participants‚Äô self-evaluation on confidence was also correct, because the AUC for the Note, Tablet, and Phone groups were 0.77 ¬± 0.14, 0.77 ¬± 0.12, and 0.74 ¬± 0.11, respectively, where group differences were not significant (<i>F</i><sub>(2,45)</sub> = 0.2, <i>p</i> = 0.8). The accuracy or RTs in the retrieval was not significantly different among the three groups (accuracy: <i>F</i><sub>(2,45)</sub> = 0.5, <i>p</i> = 0.6; RTs: <i>F</i><sub>(2,45)</sub> = 0.8, <i>p</i> = 0.5; <a href="#F2">Figure 2C</a>); the accuracy and RTs in the interference and 2-back tasks were also comparable among the three groups (<i>p</i> &gt; 0.4). However, we observed significant group differences when we focused on the easier questions of scheduled appointments (see ‚ÄúMaterials and Methods‚Äù section; <a href="#F2">Figure 2B</a>). According to non-parametric tests for the data showing ceiling effects, the accuracy of the easier questions was significantly higher for the Note group than the Tablet group (Wilcoxon rank-sum test, <i>W</i> = 179, <i>p</i> = 0.04), and the difference between the Note and Device groups was marginally significant (<i>W</i> = 164, <i>p</i> = 0.06).</p>

</div> 


<p>The Tablet and Phone groups (or Device group) took more time for writing down (<a href="#F2">Figure 2A</a>), and this might be due to slower input of characters with such mobile devices (no typing on the computer keyboard). However, at least between the Note and Tablet groups, the use of a stylus pen was just similar to writing with a four-color pen, and the physical layout of a notebook or tablet was equated as much as possible (see ‚ÄúMaterials and Methods‚Äù section). Moreover, there was ample time for every group to write down all appointments into a monthly calendar. Therefore, <i>shorter</i> amounts of time for writing down and <i>higher</i> accuracy in easier questions for the Note group suggest that those cognitive processes for the Note group were actually deeper and more solid.</p>
<p>When all participants in the three groups were combined, the accuracy in the retrieval and 2-back tasks were significantly correlated (Pearson‚Äôs correlation, <i>r</i> = 0.31, <i>t</i><sub>(46)</sub> = 2.2, <i>p</i> = 0.03). RTs showed a significant correlation as well (<i>r</i> = 0.33, <i>t</i><sub>(46)</sub> = 2.4, <i>p</i> = 0.02). These results confirm consistent immediate- and short-term memory capacities for every participant.</p>
<h3>Enhanced Activations in Bilateral Regions for the Note Group</h3>
<p>To identify brain regions specifically involved in the memory retrieval process, we directly compared activations between the 6-s memory retrieval phase and the 4-s <i>post hoc</i> period from each 10-s period of the retrieval task, denoted as ‚ÄúFirst 6 s‚ÄîLast 4 s‚Äù contrast. This was because the mean RTs were less than 6 s for all but two participants (see <a href="#F2">Figure 2C</a>). With this stringent contrast during the same stimulus presentation and task, dynamic signal changes induced by such active retrieval processes should be revealed. As shown in <a href="#F3">Figure 3A</a>, localized activations were found bilaterally in the middle frontal gyrus, F3op/F3t, fusiform gyrus, AG/SMG, middle/inferior occipital gyrus (MOG/IOG), pallidum, and hippocampus; we also observed left-lateralized activation in the LPMC and precuneus.</p>

Activated regions for the retrieval task. <strong>(A)</strong> Results of the ‚ÄúFirst 6 s‚ÄîLast 4 s‚Äù contrast within the retrieval task period are shown for all participants. <strong>(B)</strong> Results of the ‚Äúretrieval‚Äî2-back‚Äù contrast are shown for all participants. The lines indicate the locations of the sections. Localized activations were observed bilaterally in the lateral premotor cortex/opercular/triangular parts of the inferior frontal gyrus (LPMC/F3op/F3t), angular/supramarginal gyri (AG/SMG), hippocampus, precuneus, and lingual gyrus/calcarine/inferior occipital gyrus (LG/calcarine/IOG; see <a href="#T2">Table 2</a> for the list of local maxima).</p>
</div> 


<p>It is still possible that these activations reflect immediate memory processes that were necessary to solve the retrieval task; note the above-mentioned correlation between performances of the two tasks. Thus, we further compared activations in the retrieval task (10-s period) against those in the 2-back task with more demanding immediate memory, which successfully removed common factors in both tasks (<a href="#F3">Figure 3B</a>). The result of activations replicated the above-mentioned regions (<a href="#T2">Table 2</a>), providing appropriate ROIs for further analyses. Additional activations were found bilaterally in the lingual gyrus (LG) and calcarine sulcus; we also observed left-lateralized activation in the orbital part of the inferior frontal gyrus (F3O).</p>

<p>We assessed percent signal changes for these ROIs, and found significant intergroup differences in the posterior hippocampus, precuneus, LG/calcarine/IOG, LPMC/F3op/F3t, and AG/SMG (<a href="#F4">Figures 4A‚ÄìE</a>). Activations in the first four regions were significantly different between the Note group and the combined Tablet and Phone groups (hippocampus: <i>t</i><sub>(94)</sub> = 2.4, <i>p</i> = 0.02; precuneus: <i>t</i><sub>(94)</sub> = 2.3, <i>p</i> = 0.03; LG/calcarine/IOG: <i>t</i><sub>(94)</sub> = 2.7, <i>p</i> = 0.008; LPMC/F3op/F3t: <i>t</i><sub>(94)</sub> = 2.0, <i>p</i> = 0.05), whereas those in the last region were significantly different between the Note and Phone groups (<i>t</i><sub>(62)</sub> = 2.2, <i>p</i> = 0.03). Activations in the LG/calcarine/IOG and LPMC/F3op/F3t were also significantly different between the Note and Device groups (LG/calcarine/IOG: <i>t</i><sub>(60)</sub> = 2.2, <i>p</i> = 0.03; LPMC/F3op/F3t: <i>t</i><sub>(60)</sub> = 2.4, <i>p</i> = 0.02), even when the experience/accustomedness of using paper notebooks was equated. Moreover, we observed a significant positive correlation between the RTs in the retrieval task and the averaged signal changes in the ROIs of LPMC/F3op/F3t and AG/SMG for all participants (<i>r</i> = 0.31, <i>t</i><sub>(46)</sub> = 2.2, <i>p</i> = 0.03; <a href="#F4">Figure 4F</a>). This link between behavioral results and brain activations indicates that inner language processes were indeed involved in during memory retrieval <i>via</i> the function of the language-related regions.</p>

<h2>Discussion</h2>
<p>Using three groups of participants who performed a schedule-recording task using a paper notebook, electronic tablet, or smartphone, followed by a retrieval task (<a href="#F1">Figure 1</a>), we obtained three major results. First, the duration of schedule recording was significantly shorter for the Note group than the Tablet and Phone groups, and accuracy was much higher for the Note group in easier (i.e., more straightforward) questions (<a href="#F2">Figure 2</a>). Because the input methods were equated as much as possible between the Note and Tablet groups, these results indicate that the cognitive processes for the Note group were actually deeper and more solid. Second, brain activations for all groups during the retrieval phase were localized in the bilateral hippocampus, precuneus, LG/calcarine/IOG, and LPMC/F3op/F3t (<a href="#F3">Figure 3</a>), confirming the involvement of verbalized memory retrieval processes for appointments. Third, activations in these regions were significantly higher for the Note group than those for the Tablet and Phone groups (<a href="#F4">Figure 4</a>). These enhanced activations for the Note group could not be explained by general cognitive loads or task difficulty, because overall task performances were similar among the groups. Brain activations for the Tablet and Phone groups were similar, where the difference in input methods did not affect the results. On the other hand, the Note and Tablet groups showed a clear difference in brain activations even if the physical layout and input methods were controlled. Brain activations were significantly different also between the Note and Device groups, even when accustomedness to paper notebooks or mobile devices was equated for daily usage. The significant superiority in both accuracy and activations for the Note group suggested that the use of a paper notebook promoted the acquisition of rich encoding information and/or spatial information of real papers (see the ‚ÄúIntroduction‚Äù section) and that this information could be utilized as effective retrieval clues, leading to higher activations in these specific regions.</p>
<p>The hippocampus is crucially involved not only in memory encoding and retrieval processes but also in spatial memory itself. The hippocampal-entorhinal cortex provides spatial representations, as demonstrated by grid cells (<a href="#B13">Hartley et al., 2014</a>; <a href="#B24">Moser et al., 2015</a>). It has also been suggested that activations in the human hippocampus encode distances between locations in the real world (<a href="#B22">Morgan et al., 2011</a>; <a href="#B15">Howard et al., 2014</a>). In a recent fMRI study using a graph structure of pictures, the adaptation signals in the hippocampal-entorhinal cortex were suppressed for shorter distances on the graph, indicating that non-spatial relationships were also encoded in these regions (<a href="#B11">Garvert et al., 2017</a>). Other neuroimaging studies have shown that activations in the left posterior hippocampus were enhanced during retrieval compared with the encoding of word pairs (<a href="#B29">Prince et al., 2005</a>) and that better recollection of proverbs was associated with a larger volume of the bilateral posterior hippocampus (<a href="#B28">Poppenk and Moscovitch, 2011</a>). The results of the present study are consistent with these previous findings, in that the scheduled appointments included various cues of spatial and structural information in the calendar, which were especially abundant when participants used paper notebooks. Moreover, the retrieval of such encoded information was explicitly required by our retrieval task and was shown to elicit activations in the bilateral posterior hippocampus.</p>
<p>Concerning activation in the visual cortex, a previous study reported that the visual cortex was activated during the retrieval of pictorial visual information without actual visual stimulation (<a href="#B37">Wheeler et al., 2000</a>). The visual areas play a key role in visual imagery as well, and activations in those regions could be affected by focal attention during imagery (<a href="#B32">Sakai and Miyashita, 1994</a>). Indeed, a study with fMRI decoding revealed activation in the V1‚ÄìV3 when participants reported visual imagery of an object during dreaming, about which was inquired afterward (<a href="#B14">Horikawa et al., 2013</a>). Another study reported that retrieval of visual information was related to activation patterns in the V1‚ÄìV3, and further showed that the activation patterns in the hippocampus predicted the mnemonic strength (<a href="#B3">Bosch et al., 2014</a>). As regards the precuneus, a positron emission tomography (PET) study with a paired-word retrieval task showed memory-related activation for both visual and auditory stimuli, indicating a modality-general role of the precuneus (<a href="#B18">Krause et al., 1999</a>). The internal representation for visual imagery of the encoded calendar provides a plausible account for our results, in which the paper notebook provides richer information than mobile devices.</p>
<p>According to our previous study, the left F3op/F3t, right LPMC, and right F3op/F3t are included in the network for syntax and its supportive system (Network I; <a href="#B17">Kinno et al., 2014</a>), whereas the left LPMC is critical to the network for syntax and input/output interface (Network II). In the present study, we observed activation in the left F3t/F3O, which is an essential part of the network for syntax and semantics (Network III). Thus all three networks that are crucial for syntactic processing were involved in the retrieval of scheduled appointments. The enhanced activations for the Note group suggest that the use of paper notebooks even influenced natural language processes, possibly reflecting the encoding of specific episodes.</p>
<p>Our present experiments demonstrated that brain activations related to memory, visual imagery, and language during the retrieval of specific information, as well as the deeper encoding of that information, were stronger in participants using a paper notebook than in those using electronic devices. Our results suggest that the use of a paper notebook affects these higher-order brain functions, and this could have important implications for education, particularly in terms of the pros and cons of e-learning. The expanded use of mobile devices or computers could undercut the use of traditional textbooks and paper notebooks, which may in fact provide richer information from the perspective of memory encoding. Further research is needed to elucidate the actual changes in brain activation due to the long-term exposure to mobile devices.</p>

<div><h2>Fast code, fast.</h2>
<div><h3><i></i> Write Fast</h3>
<p>D allows writing large code fragments without redundantly specifying types,
like dynamic languages do. On the other hand, static inference deduces types and other
code properties, giving the best of both the static and the
dynamic worlds. <a id="a1-control"></a></p><div id="a1">

<p>Automatic memory management makes for safe, simple, and robust code.
D also supports scoped resource management (aka the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_Acquisition_Is_Initialization">RAII</a> idiom)
and <a href="https://dlang.org/spec/statement.html#ScopeGuardStatement"><span>scope</span> statements</a> for

immutable data, message passing, no sharing by default, and
controlled mutable sharing across threads. <a href="http://informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=1609144">Read more</a>.</p>

<p>From simple scripts to large projects, D has the breadth
to scale with any application's needs: unit testing,
information hiding, refined modularity, fast compilation, precise

<div><h3><i></i> Run Fast</h3>
<p>D compiles naturally to efficient native code.</p>

<p>D is designed such that most "obvious" code is fast <i>and</i>
safe. On occasion a function might need to escape the confines of type
safety for ultimate speed and control. For such rare cases D offers
native pointers, type casts, access to any C function without any
intervening translation, manual memory management, custom allocators
and even inline assembly code. <a id="a5-control"></a></p><div id="a5">

Over three millennia after it was abandoned, a team of archaeologists had been granted permission to investigate ‚Äì and they were on the hunt for the royal tomb.</p>
<p>After navigating through large hallways and narrow corridors, down crumbling steps, they came across a deep shaft. On one side were two identical statues guarding a sealed door: they had found it. Inside was a hoard of ancient wonders ‚Äì 2,000 objects, including jewellery and a large golden hand. But there were also some intriguing dark patches on the ground. They sent a sample for testing ‚Äì eventually separating out a <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/antiquity/article/abs/high-prestige-royal-purple-dyed-textiles-from-the-bronze-age-royal-tomb-at-qatna-syria/69EC1A74600EC74AAAC26D2F585ACF5A">vivid purple layer</a> from the dust and muck.</p>
<p>The researchers had uncovered one of the most legendary commodities in the ancient world. This precious product forged empires, <a href="https://livrepository.liverpool.ac.uk/2032421/1/A%20Zadorojnyi%20Colour%20in%20Suetonius.pdf">felled kings</a>, and cemented the power of generations of global rulers. The Egyptian Queen Cleopatra was so obsessed with it, she even used it for the <a href="https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=86MaBQAAQBAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA185&amp;dq=cleopatra+tyrian+purple+sails+barge&amp;ots=LNomeumMkA&amp;sig=GWkGxXgykg_LQrTI3158PpF_Dc4">sails of her boat</a>, while some Roman emperors decreed that anyone caught wearing it ‚Äì other than them ‚Äì would be sentenced to death. &nbsp;</p>
<p>That invention was Tyrian purple, otherwise known as shellfish purple. But though this noble pigment was the most expensive product in antiquity ‚Äì worth more than <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S138614251930071X">three times</a> its weight in gold, according to a Roman edict issued in 301 AD ‚Äì no one living today knows how to make it. By the <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.3184/003685013X13680345111425">15th Century</a>, the elaborate recipes to extract and process the dye had been lost.</p>
<p>But why did this alluring colour disappear? And can it be resurrected?</p>
<p>In a small garden hut in north-eastern Tunisia, just a short distance from what was once the Phoenician city of Carthage, one man has spent most of the last 16 years smashing up sea snails ‚Äì attempting to coax their entrails into something resembling Tyrian purple.</p></div></div><div id="future/article/20231122-tyrian-purple-the-lost-ancient-pigment-that-was-more-valuable-than-gold-p0gvpdcg"><picture><source media="(min-width:1200px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/1600x900/p0gvpdcg.webp" type="image/webp"><source media="(min-width:1200px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/1600x900/p0gvpdcg.jpg" type="image/jpeg"><source media="(min-width:880px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/1280x720/p0gvpdcg.webp" type="image/webp"><source media="(min-width:880px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/1280x720/p0gvpdcg.jpg" type="image/jpeg"><source media="(min-width:576px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/976x549/p0gvpdcg.webp" type="image/webp"><source media="(min-width:576px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/976x549/p0gvpdcg.jpg" type="image/jpeg"><source media="(min-width:224px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/624x351/p0gvpdcg.webp" type="image/webp"><source media="(min-width:224px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/624x351/p0gvpdcg.jpg" type="image/jpeg"><img loading="lazy" draggable="false" title="After more than three thousand years of mingling with sediment, the Tyrian purple found in Qatna‚Äôs royal tomb was still intensely colourful (Credit: Alamy)" src="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/976x549/p0gvpdcg.jpg" alt="After more than three thousand years of mingling with sediment, the Tyrian purple found in Qatna‚Äôs royal tomb was still intensely colourful (Credit: Alamy)" id=""></picture><div><p>After more than three thousand years of mingling with sediment, the Tyrian purple found in Qatna‚Äôs royal tomb was still intensely colourful (Credit: Alamy)</p></div></div><div><p><strong>A fishy empire</strong></p>
<p>Tyrian purple was paraded by the most privileged in society for millennia ‚Äì a symbol of strength, sovereignty and money. Ancient authors are particular about the precise hue that was worthy of the name: a <a href="https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/document?repid=rep1&amp;type=pdf&amp;doi=5750d98181fd002503d2b147235bf6fa75ad334c">deep reddish-purple</a>, like that of coagulated blood, tinged with black. Pliny the Elder described it as having a "<a href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0137%3Abook%3D9&amp;force=y">shining appearance</a> when held up to the light". &nbsp;</p>
<p>With its uniquely intense colour and resistance to fading, Tyrian purple was adored by ancient civilisations across Southern Europe, North Africa, and Western Asia. It was so central to the success of the Phoenicians it was named after their city-state Tyre, and they became known as the "purple people". The shade could be found on everything from cloaks to sails, paintings, furniture, plaster, <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2571-9408/4/1/10">wall paintings</a>, jewellery and even burial shrouds.</p>
<p>In 40 AD, the king of Mauretania was killed in a surprise assassination in Rome, ordered by the emperor. Despite being a friend to the Romans, the unfortunate royal had caused grave offence when he <a href="https://livrepository.liverpool.ac.uk/2032421/1/A%20Zadorojnyi%20Colour%20in%20Suetonius.pdf">strode into an amphitheatre</a> to watch a gladiatorial match‚Ä¶ wearing a purple robe. The jealous, insatiable lust that the colour ignited was sometimes <a href="https://www.loebclassics.com/view/pliny_elder-natural_history/1938/pb_LCL353.249.xml?readMode=recto">compared to a kind of madness</a>. &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>A slimy mystery</strong></p>
<p>Oddly, the most celebrated pigment the world has known did not start life as a beautiful ultramarine gemstone, like its contemporary <a href="https://exhibitions.kelsey.lsa.umich.edu/ancient-color/blue.php">lapis lazuli</a> ‚Äì or a vibrant <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/rubia-tinctorum">tangle of coral-pink roots</a>, like the red dye madder. Instead, it began as a clear fluid produced by sea snails in the Murex family. More specifically, it was mucous.&nbsp;</p></div><div id="future/article/20231122-tyrian-purple-the-lost-ancient-pigment-that-was-more-valuable-than-gold-p0gvpb1s"><picture><source media="(min-width:1200px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/1600x900/p0gvpb1s.webp" type="image/webp"><source media="(min-width:1200px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/1600x900/p0gvpb1s.jpg" type="image/jpeg"><source media="(min-width:880px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/1280x720/p0gvpb1s.webp" type="image/webp"><source media="(min-width:880px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/1280x720/p0gvpb1s.jpg" type="image/jpeg"><source media="(min-width:576px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/976x549/p0gvpb1s.webp" type="image/webp"><source media="(min-width:576px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/976x549/p0gvpb1s.jpg" type="image/jpeg"><source media="(min-width:224px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/624x351/p0gvpb1s.webp" type="image/webp"><source media="(min-width:224px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/624x351/p0gvpb1s.jpg" type="image/jpeg"><img loading="lazy" draggable="false" title="Tyrian purple has been found in paintings dating back to the Bronze Age (Credit: Alamy)" src="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/976x549/p0gvpb1s.jpg" alt="Tyrian purple has been found in paintings dating back to the Bronze Age (Credit: Alamy)" id=""></picture><div><p>Tyrian purple has been found in paintings dating back to the Bronze Age (Credit: Alamy)</p></div></div><div><p>Tyrian purple could be produced from the secretions of three species of sea snail, each of which made a different colour: <em>Hexaplex trunculus </em>(bluish purple), <em>Bolinus brandaris</em> (reddish purple), and <em>Stramonita haemastoma </em>(red).</p>
<p>Once snails had been collected, either by hand along rocky coastlines or with traps baited with other snails ‚Äì Murex sea snails are predators ‚Äì it was time to harvest the slime. In some places, the mucous gland was sliced it out using a specialised knife. One Roman author explained how <a href="https://digitalvirgil.co.uk/pvs/2013/part9.pdf">the snail's gore would then ooze out of its wounds</a>, "flowing out like tears", before being collected into mortars for grinding. Alternatively, smaller species could be crushed whole.</p>
<p>But this is the end of the certainty. Accounts of how colourless snail slime was transformed into the dye of legends are vague, contradictory and sometimes obviously mistaken ‚Äì Aristotle said the mucous glands came from the throat of a "<a href="https://www.academia.edu/7606396/Dying_in_Purple_Life_Death_and_Tyrian_Dye_in_the_Aeneid">purple fish</a>". To complicate matters further, the dyeing industry was highly secretive ‚Äì each manufacturer had their own recipe, and these complex, multi-step formulas were closely guarded.</p>
<p>"The problem is that people did not write down the important tricks," says Maria Melo, a professor of conservation science at NOVA University of Lisbon, Portugal.</p></div><div id="future/article/20231122-tyrian-purple-the-lost-ancient-pigment-that-was-more-valuable-than-gold-p0gvnqdq"><picture><source media="(min-width:1200px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/1600x900/p0gvnqdq.webp" type="image/webp"><source media="(min-width:1200px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/1600x900/p0gvnqdq.jpg" type="image/jpeg"><source media="(min-width:880px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/1280x720/p0gvnqdq.webp" type="image/webp"><source media="(min-width:880px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/1280x720/p0gvnqdq.jpg" type="image/jpeg"><source media="(min-width:576px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/976x549/p0gvnqdq.webp" type="image/webp"><source media="(min-width:576px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/976x549/p0gvnqdq.jpg" type="image/jpeg"><source media="(min-width:224px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/624x351/p0gvnqdq.webp" type="image/webp"><source media="(min-width:224px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/624x351/p0gvnqdq.jpg" type="image/jpeg"><img loading="lazy" draggable="false" title="Murex snails may also have been the historic source of ‚Äútekhelet‚Äù ‚Äì a sacred colour in the Jewish tradition mentioned in the Hebrew Bible (Credit: Mohammed Ghassen Nouira)" src="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/976x549/p0gvnqdq.jpg" alt="Murex snails may also have been the historic source of ‚Äútekhelet‚Äù ‚Äì a sacred colour in the Jewish tradition mentioned in the Hebrew Bible (Credit: Mohammed Ghassen Nouira)" id=""></picture><div><p>Murex snails may also have been the historic source of ‚Äútekhelet‚Äù ‚Äì a sacred colour in the Jewish tradition mentioned in the Hebrew Bible (Credit: Mohammed Ghassen Nouira)</p></div></div><div><h3>A purple pong</h3><div><p>In antiquity, Tyrian purple was not just renowned for its colour.

It went something like this: after isolating the mucous glands, they were salted and left to ferment for three days. Next came the cooking, which was done in tin or possibly lead pots on a "moderate" heat. This continued until the whole mixture had been boiled down to a fraction of its original volume. On the tenth day, the dye was tested by dipping in some fabric ‚Äì if it emerged stained with the desired shade, it was ready.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Given that each snail only contained the tiniest amount of mucous, it could take some 10,000 to make just a <a href="https://hrcak.srce.hr/255412">single gram of dye</a>. Mounds of <a href="https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/371717?journalCode=jnes">billions of discarded sea snail shells</a> have been reported in areas where it was once manufactured. In fact, the production of Tyrian purple has been described as the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6236399/">first chemical industry</a> ‚Äì and this not only applies to the scale of the operations, but their exacting nature.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"It is not really easy to obtain the colour," says Ioannis&nbsp;Karapanagiotis, a professor of conservation chemistry at Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Greece. He explains that Tyrian purple is totally unlike other dyes, where the raw material ‚Äì such as leaves ‚Äì contains the pigment already. Instead, the sea snail mucous contains chemicals which can be <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/11/13/3595">turned into a dye</a>, but only under the right conditions. "It is quite amazing," he says. And yet, many crucial details of the process are long forgotten.</p></div><div id="future/article/20231122-tyrian-purple-the-lost-ancient-pigment-that-was-more-valuable-than-gold-p0gvpd89"><picture><source media="(min-width:1200px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/1600x900/p0gvpd89.webp" type="image/webp"><source media="(min-width:1200px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/1600x900/p0gvpd89.jpg" type="image/jpeg"><source media="(min-width:880px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/1280x720/p0gvpd89.webp" type="image/webp"><source media="(min-width:880px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/1280x720/p0gvpd89.jpg" type="image/jpeg"><source media="(min-width:576px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/976x549/p0gvpd89.webp" type="image/webp"><source media="(min-width:576px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/976x549/p0gvpd89.jpg" type="image/jpeg"><source media="(min-width:224px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/624x351/p0gvpd89.webp" type="image/webp"><source media="(min-width:224px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/624x351/p0gvpd89.jpg" type="image/jpeg"><img loading="lazy" draggable="false" title="In ancient and medieval times, Tyrian purple was so valuable, it was often faked ‚Äì usually with a combination of blue dye from indigo plants and red madder (Credit: Alamy)" src="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/976x549/p0gvpd89.jpg" alt="In ancient and medieval times, Tyrian purple was so valuable, it was often faked ‚Äì usually with a combination of blue dye from indigo plants and red madder (Credit: Alamy)" id=""></picture><div><p>In ancient and medieval times, Tyrian purple was so valuable, it was often faked ‚Äì usually with a combination of blue dye from indigo plants and red madder (Credit: Alamy)</p></div></div><div><p><strong>An abrupt decline </strong></p>
<p>In the early hours of 29 May 1453, the Byzantine city of Constantinople was captured by the Ottomans. This was the end of the Eastern Roman Empire ‚Äì and it <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.3184/003685013X13680345111425">took Tyrian purple with it</a>.</p>
<p>At the time, the city's dyeworks were at the centre of the industry. The colour had become deeply bound to Catholicism ‚Äì worn by cardinals and used to dye the pages of religious manuscripts. But it had already been suffering, after a succession of excessive <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.3184/003685013X13680345111425">taxes</a>. Now the church had lost control of the pigment's production altogether. So, the pope soon decided that red would become the <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.3184/003685013X13680345111425">new symbol of Christian power</a>. This could be made easily and cheaply by crushing scale insects.</p>
<p>However, there may also have been another factor in the demise of Tyrian purple. In 2003, scientists stumbled upon a pile of sea snail shells at the site of the ancient port of Andriake in southern Turkey. In all, they estimated that this garbage heap, dating to the 6th Century AD, contained around 300 cubic metres (10,594 cubic ft) of their remains ‚Äì corresponding to up to 60 million individuals.</p>
<p>Intriguingly, though the bottom of the pile ‚Äì where the snails were discarded first ‚Äì contained some plump, older specimens, those discarded more recently were <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1468-0092.2007.00281.x">significantly smaller and younger</a>. One explanation is that the sea snails had been overexploited and eventually, there just weren't any mature snails left. This may have led to the extinction of <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1468-0092.2007.00281.x">dye production in the area</a>, the researchers suggest.</p>
<p>But just a few years after this discovery, another would raise hopes of reviving this ancient colour.</p></div><div id="future/article/20231122-tyrian-purple-the-lost-ancient-pigment-that-was-more-valuable-than-gold-p0gvpdlm"><picture><source media="(min-width:1200px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/1600x900/p0gvpdlm.webp" type="image/webp"><source media="(min-width:1200px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/1600x900/p0gvpdlm.jpg" type="image/jpeg"><source media="(min-width:880px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/1280x720/p0gvpdlm.webp" type="image/webp"><source media="(min-width:880px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/1280x720/p0gvpdlm.jpg" type="image/jpeg"><source media="(min-width:576px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/976x549/p0gvpdlm.webp" type="image/webp"><source media="(min-width:576px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/976x549/p0gvpdlm.jpg" type="image/jpeg"><source media="(min-width:224px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/624x351/p0gvpdlm.webp" type="image/webp"><source media="(min-width:224px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/624x351/p0gvpdlm.jpg" type="image/jpeg"><img loading="lazy" draggable="false" title="In Mexico and Central America, indigenous people have a very different method for dyeing with Murex ‚Äì they rub live snails onto fabric directly (Credit: Mohammed Ghassen Nouira)" src="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/976x549/p0gvpdlm.jpg" alt="In Mexico and Central America, indigenous people have a very different method for dyeing with Murex ‚Äì they rub live snails onto fabric directly (Credit: Mohammed Ghassen Nouira)" id=""></picture><div><p>In Mexico and Central America, indigenous people have a very different method for dyeing with Murex ‚Äì they rub live snails onto fabric directly (Credit: Mohammed Ghassen Nouira)</p></div></div><div><p><strong>A determined revival </strong></p>
<p>One day in September 2007, Mohammed Ghassen Nouira was taking his usual lunchtime walk on a beach on the outskirts of the city of Tunis, Tunisia. "There had been a horrible storm the previous night, so there were a lot of dead creatures on the sand, like jellyfish, seaweeds, small crabs, molluscs," he says. Then he noticed a smear of colour ‚Äì an intensely reddish-purple liquid was oozing out of a cracked sea snail.</p>
<p>Nouira, who works as a consulting manager, was immediately reminded of a story he had learned at school ‚Äì the legend of Tyrian purple. He raced to the local harbour, where he found many more snails, exactly like the one on the beach. Their little spiral bodies are covered in spikes, so they often become trapped in fishermen's nets. "They hate them," he says. One man was plucking them out of his net and putting them in an old tomato can ‚Äì which Nouira later took back to his apartment.</p>
<p>To begin with, Nouira's experiment was extremely disappointing. That night, he cracked the snails open and looked for the vivid purple entrails he had seen on the beach. But there was nothing there except pale flesh. He put it all in a bag to throw away, and went to bed. The next day, the bag's contents had undergone a transformation. "At that time, I had no clue that the purple was initially transparent ‚Äì it's like water," he says.</p></div><div id="future/article/20231122-tyrian-purple-the-lost-ancient-pigment-that-was-more-valuable-than-gold-p0gvpbk4"><picture><source media="(min-width:1200px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/1600x900/p0gvpbk4.webp" type="image/webp"><source media="(min-width:1200px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/1600x900/p0gvpbk4.jpg" type="image/jpeg"><source media="(min-width:880px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/1280x720/p0gvpbk4.webp" type="image/webp"><source media="(min-width:880px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/1280x720/p0gvpbk4.jpg" type="image/jpeg"><source media="(min-width:576px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/976x549/p0gvpbk4.webp" type="image/webp"><source media="(min-width:576px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/976x549/p0gvpbk4.jpg" type="image/jpeg"><source media="(min-width:224px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/624x351/p0gvpbk4.webp" type="image/webp"><source media="(min-width:224px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/624x351/p0gvpbk4.jpg" type="image/jpeg"><img loading="lazy" draggable="false" title="For dyes to stick to fabric, their molecules need to be converted to a water-soluble form.

In its pure form, 6,6'-dibromoindigo is a deep purple powder, and it just so happens that it makes an&nbsp;<a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.jpcc.0c05186" target="_blank">excellent semiconductor</a>&nbsp;‚Äì the basis of modern electronics. As an organic material it's&nbsp;biodegradable and&nbsp;less alien to the human body than silicon, so as well as making electronics more ecofriendly, it could potentially be used in&nbsp;<a href="https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlehtml/2022/tc/d1tc04997f" target="_blank">wearable technologies</a>. The best part? It can be&nbsp;<a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1081/SCC-100107023" target="_blank">made in a laboratory</a>&nbsp;‚Äì with no sea snails involved.&nbsp;</p></div></div><div><p>Scientists now know that to jolt the chemicals in Murex snails out of their colourless state, they need to be <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11224-017-0932-0">exposed to visible light</a>. Initially their secretions will turn yellow, then green, turquoise, blue and eventually a shade of purple, depending on the snail species. "If you do this process on a sunny day, it takes something like less than five minutes to have this transformation," says Karapanagiotis.</p>
<p>But this isn't instant Tyrian purple. The shade is actually made up of many different pigment molecules, all working together. Melo explains that there's indigo, which is blue, "brominated" indigo, which is purple, and indirubin, which is red. "Depending on the treatment of your extract, and on the dying, you can have very different colours," she says. Even once the desired colour has been achieved, there is still yet more processing to do to turn the pigments into a dye, such as converting them into forms that will stick to fabric.</p>
<p>For Nouira, this was the beginning of a 16-year obsession with uncovering the lost method for making Tyrian purple. Though others have <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.3184/003685013X13680345111425">investigated the secretions of sea snails</a> before ‚Äì including a scientist who processed 12,000 individuals into 1.4g of pure powdered pigment using industrial techniques ‚Äì Nouira wanted to make it the old way, and rediscover the authentic shade that was venerated for millennia.</p>
<p>When he took those first sea snails in his apartment back in 2007, it was just a week after his honeymoon. "My wife was horrified by the by the smell; she almost kicked me out of the house‚Ä¶ But I had to carry on," he says.</p></div><div id="future/article/20231122-tyrian-purple-the-lost-ancient-pigment-that-was-more-valuable-than-gold-p0gvp9p3"><picture><source media="(min-width:1200px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/1600x900/p0gvp9p3.webp" type="image/webp"><source media="(min-width:1200px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/1600x900/p0gvp9p3.jpg" type="image/jpeg"><source media="(min-width:880px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/1280x720/p0gvp9p3.webp" type="image/webp"><source media="(min-width:880px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/1280x720/p0gvp9p3.jpg" type="image/jpeg"><source media="(min-width:576px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/976x549/p0gvp9p3.webp" type="image/webp"><source media="(min-width:576px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/976x549/p0gvp9p3.jpg" type="image/jpeg"><source media="(min-width:224px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/624x351/p0gvp9p3.webp" type="image/webp"><source media="(min-width:224px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/624x351/p0gvp9p3.jpg" type="image/jpeg"><img loading="lazy" draggable="false" title="Ancient Roman authors compared Tyrian purple to the colour of clotted blood (Credit: Mohammed Ghassen Nouira)" src="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/976x549/p0gvp9p3.jpg" alt="Ancient Roman authors compared Tyrian purple to the colour of clotted blood (Credit: Mohammed Ghassen Nouira)" id=""></picture><div><p>Ancient Roman authors compared Tyrian purple to the colour of clotted blood (Credit: Mohammed Ghassen Nouira)</p></div></div><div><p>It took years for Nouira to make his first powdered dye, and when he did, it was a pale indigo colour, nothing like Tyrian purple and extremely dusty. Through years of trial and error, Nouira gradually discovered tricks that he suspects may have been used in antiquity ‚Äì blending secretions from all three sea snail species mentioned in Pliny's account, adjusting the acidity of the mixture, alternating exposure to sunlight with darkness during preparation, and cooking his mixtures for different lengths of time.</p>
<p>For references, Nouira mostly used Byzantine mosaics depicting Justinian I and his wife Theodora ‚Äì though he also later compared his results with surviving fragments of fabric. Eventually he ended up with pure pigments and dyes that he thinks are uncannily close to true Tyrian purple ‚Äì and live up to the ancient hype. "It [the colour] is very alive, very dynamic," he says. "Depending on the light, it shifts and shimmers‚Ä¶ it keeps changing and playing tricks on your eyes."</p></div><div id="future/article/20231122-tyrian-purple-the-lost-ancient-pigment-that-was-more-valuable-than-gold-p0gvpcvz"><picture><source media="(min-width:1200px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/1600x900/p0gvpcvz.webp" type="image/webp"><source media="(min-width:1200px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/1600x900/p0gvpcvz.jpg" type="image/jpeg"><source media="(min-width:880px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/1280x720/p0gvpcvz.webp" type="image/webp"><source media="(min-width:880px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/1280x720/p0gvpcvz.jpg" type="image/jpeg"><source media="(min-width:576px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/976x549/p0gvpcvz.webp" type="image/webp"><source media="(min-width:576px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/976x549/p0gvpcvz.jpg" type="image/jpeg"><source media="(min-width:224px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/624x351/p0gvpcvz.webp" type="image/webp"><source media="(min-width:224px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/624x351/p0gvpcvz.jpg" type="image/jpeg"><img loading="lazy" draggable="false" title="It‚Äôs not known why Murex snails produce the chemical precursors to Tyrian purple, but one idea is that they are used to paralyse prey (Credit: Mohammed Ghassen Nouira)" src="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/976x549/p0gvpcvz.jpg" alt="It‚Äôs not known why Murex snails produce the chemical precursors to Tyrian purple, but one idea is that they are used to paralyse prey (Credit: Mohammed Ghassen Nouira)" id=""></picture><div><p>It‚Äôs not known why Murex snails produce the chemical precursors to Tyrian purple, but one idea is that they are used to paralyse prey (Credit: Mohammed Ghassen Nouira)</p></div></div><div><p>After decades of pungent experiments in his shed, Nouira has been invited to display his pigments and dyed products at exhibitions all over the world, including <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bRO9P56WHE">the British Museum in London</a> and the Museum of Fine Arts Boston. He has also become something of a culinary expert on sea snail recipes; he recommends spicy Tunisian Murex pasta, or fried Murex. "It's crunchy, it's delicious, it's incredible," he says.</p>
<p>But Tyrian purple is again under threat. Today the challenge is not invasion, or secrecy surrounding how it's made ‚Äì though like his ancient counterparts, Nouira is furtive about the exact details of his methods ‚Äì but extinction. Murex sea snails are under threat from a barrage of human influences, including <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/11/13/3595">pollution</a> and <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/srep36897">climate change</a>. <em>Stramonita haemastoma, </em>which lends the colour a reddish tint, has already <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/srep36897">vanished from the eastern</a> Mediterranean. So, whether or not Tyrian purple has finally been revived, one thing is certain: it could easily be lost all over again.</p>

            <p>In a world where more and more of our life, photos, and documents drift in the digital ether, it's time to reflect on the popular cloud trend and explore <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2023/04/18/the-rise-of-cloud-repatriation-why-companies-are-bringing-data-in-house/?sh=2b3cdf1b58f7&amp;ref=blog.golivecosmos.com" rel="noreferrer">the cloud repatriation movement</a> of bringing data in-house.</p><p>Storing files in the cloud has been a great way of saving space on a computer for a while now, but as storage providers get bigger and bigger, they may not be as secure, cost effective, and reliable. Just last month, <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/11/27/google_drive_files_disappearing/?ref=blog.golivecosmos.com" rel="noreferrer">reports emerged</a> of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/11/google-drive-is-investigating-sync-issues-as-users-complain-of-lost-files/?ref=blog.golivecosmos.com" rel="noreferrer">Google Drive users are complaining of lost files</a>. <a href="https://support.google.com/drive/thread/245861992?ref=blog.golivecosmos.com" rel="noreferrer">Google acknowledged that files for some users are not available</a> at the moment. What do you when your files are basically owned by someone else? Is it time to reconsider how we store our files? Should we go back to good old fashioned files sitting right in our computers? Why moving away from cloud storage could be worth it:</p><p><strong>1. Security</strong><br>The cloud may be a seemingly secure space, but storing your photos and documents on your computer provides an extra layer of control and security. There is less concern for unauthorized access or data breaches because your files are physically with you. With cloud storage providers, it's important to take into account what features are available for detecting unauthorized access to your files, as some providers, like <a href="https://www.mitiga.io/blog/mitiga-security-advisory-lack-of-forensic-visibility-with-the-basic-license-in-google-drive?ref=blog.golivecosmos.com" rel="noreferrer">Google Drive, only provide a record of access logs to your drive when using a paid license</a>. In theory, <a href="https://cybersecuritynews.com/google-drive-security-flaw/?ref=blog.golivecosmos.com" rel="noreferrer">someone could infiltrate your drive, download your files, and there would be no record of this access if you're using a free license on Google Drive</a>. </p><p><strong>2. Cost</strong><br>To guarantee access to your files, cloud providers charge monthly subscriptions that may increase as your storage needs increase. <a href="https://one.google.com/about/plans?ref=blog.golivecosmos.com" rel="noreferrer">Google One plans</a> store up to 2TB of files, while <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201238?ref=blog.golivecosmos.com" rel="noreferrer">Apple iCloud plans</a> offer up to 12TB of storage. Instead of paying a monthly subscription to store and access your files, a one-time payment for an external hard drive may be a more economical alternative over time.</p><p><strong>3. Reliable Access</strong><br>With files stored directly on your computer, you're not at risk of losing access to your files when service outages happen. A service outage could become a huge interruption to your day if you depend on a cloud service for work. Back in 2020, on the first day of remote school for many students and teachers, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/09/08/tech/google-drive-outage/index.html?ref=blog.golivecosmos.com" rel="noreferrer">several teachers reported not being able to access their Google drives</a> they relied on as a virtual classroom tool. Teachers couldn't resume classes until Google resolved the outage several hours later. There are also <a href="https://sixcolors.com/post/2023/10/bitten-by-the-black-box-of-icloud/?ref=blog.golivecosmos.com" rel="noreferrer">iCloud users who have reported losing access to their files during unannounced maintenance windows</a>. When your files are stored locally on your computer, a single provider's service outage or maintenance down time won't be a cause for concern.</p><p>Here's to safeguarding your digital world üåêüíæ. Until next time, keep your data safe and your tech journeys thrilling.</p><p>Curious for more?

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In many contexts, the individual value from consuming a product or service increases as more people consume it. The more of your peers who join TikTok, for example, the more value you probably see in joining yourself. Building on this logic, it‚Äôs possible that products like social media not only offer greater utility to users as their market share grows, but greater disutility to non-users as well. Just imagine being the sole holdout during the TikTok craze. With each friend who joins, you likely feel increasingly left out. In this paper, the authors test for these spillovers and paint a more accurate picture of how social media impacts consumers.</p><p>To study this question, the authors design a largescale, online experiment aimed at measuring consumer welfare in the presence of both network effects‚Äîthe phenomenon wherein the value of joining vs. not joining increases with the number of consumers‚Äîand consumption spillovers to non-users‚Äîfor example, fear of missing out on the latest TikTok trend. Their survey-based experiment focuses on TikTok and Instagram and is administered to 1,000 college students.</p><p><img decoding="async" src="https://bfi.uchicago.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Burzstyn-When-Product-Markets-Become-Collective-Traps-The-Case-of-Social-Media.jpg" alt="" width="901" height="654" srcset="https://bfi.uchicago.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Burzstyn-When-Product-Markets-Become-Collective-Traps-The-Case-of-Social-Media.jpg 901w, https://bfi.uchicago.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Burzstyn-When-Product-Markets-Become-Collective-Traps-The-Case-of-Social-Media-551x400.jpg 551w, https://bfi.uchicago.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Burzstyn-When-Product-Markets-Become-Collective-Traps-The-Case-of-Social-Media-768x557.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 901px) 100vw, 901px"></p><p>The authors begin by measuring the amount of money that users would accept to deactivate their accounts for four weeks, while keeping constant others‚Äô social media use. They next measure how much users value their accounts when other students at their university are asked to deactivate their accounts as well. Finally, the authors measure users‚Äô preferences over the deactivation of accounts of all participating students, including themselves. They find the following:</p><ul><li>Users would need to be paid $59 to deactivate TikTok and $47 to deactivate Instagram if others in their network were to continue using their accounts.</li><li>Users would be willing to pay $28 and $10 to have others, including themselves, deactivate TikTok and Instagram, respectively. Accounting for consumption spillovers to non-users reveals that 64% of active TikTok users and 48% of active Instagram users experience negative welfare from the products‚Äô existence. Participants who do not have accounts would be willing to pay $67 and $39 to have others deactivate their TikTok and Instagram accounts, respectively.</li><li>Taken together, these results imply the existence of a ‚Äúsocial media trap‚Äù for a large share of consumers, whose utility from the platforms is negative but would have been even more negative if they didn‚Äôt use social media.</li><li>The authors use these results to quantify the role of network effects on social media, or the extent to which users value social media platforms more when their peers use them. They find positive and quantitatively significant network effects: users value TikTok and Instagram 33% and 24% more, respectively, when their peers are on the sites compared to when they are not.</li></ul><p>Building on these results, the authors explore whether product market traps exist in other domains as well. They field online surveys with consumers concerning their opinions on luxury goods and technology, where similar spillover effects are a plausible driver of consumption. They find the following:</p><ul><li>Among respondents who own luxury brands that they themselves bought (e.g., Gucci, Versace, Rolex), 44% prefer to live in a world without any of those brands altogether. Among respondents not owning such brands, the fraction preferring to live in a world without them is 69%.</li><li>Among iPhone owners, a striking 91% of respondents indicate that they would prefer Apple to release the iPhone every other year rather than every year. Among respondents not owning the iPhone, this fraction is even larger, at 94%.</li></ul><p>This research challenges the standard argument that the mere existence of a product implies positive welfare for its users. This could help reconcile the seemingly contradictory findings in the social media literature of a large consumer surplus coexisting with negative effects on wellbeing. It also suggests a heightened need for regulators to assess whether different products create traps for consumers and whether they generate positive welfare. For instance, large tech companies commonly use tools that might decrease non-consumer surplus, such as increasing the salience of being a non-consumer or tying together messaging apps and social media platforms and thus increasing the cost of not being a user.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  
  <p>Data produced by programs need to be stored somewhere for future reference, and
there must be some sort of organisation so we can quickly retrieve the desired
information. A file system (FS) is responsible for this task and provides an
abstraction over the storage devices where the data is physically stored.</p>

<p>In this post, we will learn more about the concepts used by file systems, and
how they fit together when writing your own.</p>

<h2 id="structuring-the-disk">Structuring the disk</h2>
<p>When data is stored in a hard-disk drive (HDD) or solid-state drive (SSD), it is
written in small units called sectors (or pages in the SSD case). The drives
don‚Äôt have any information about what that piece of data represents, for all it
is worth, the disk is just a giant array of sectors. It is the job of the file
system to make sense of it all.</p>

<p>A file system will divide the disk into fixed-sized blocks. The FS uses the
majority of these blocks to store user data, but some blocks are used to store
metadata that is essential for the file system operation.</p>

<p>The following figure gives an example of how a file system structures the
information on the disk:</p>

<figure>
    <img src="https://wiki.carlosgaldino.com/public/images/io_filesystem_blocks.svg" alt="">
    <figcaption>File system structure in a disk</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>In the next sections, we will understand what each type of block means.</p>

<h3 id="superblock-and-bitmaps">Superblock and bitmaps</h3>

<p>The superblock stores most of the metadata about the file system, such as the
following: block size, timestamps, how many blocks and files are in use and how
many are free, etc.</p>

<p>Bitmaps are one way of tracking which data blocks and inodes are free. An index
in the bitmap set to <code>0</code> indicates a free slot, and an index set to <code>1</code>
indicates an occupied slot.</p>

<h3 id="inode">Inode</h3>

<p>The inode is the structure that stores metadata about a file. Attributes such as
permissions, size, location of data blocks that form the file and more are saved
in an inode.</p>

<p>The inodes are stored in blocks that together form the <em>inode table</em> as the
following figure shows.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="https://wiki.carlosgaldino.com/public/images/io_inode_table.svg" alt="">
    <figcaption>Inode table (detailed view)</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>For each slot in the inode bitmap set to <code>1</code>, there will be a corresponding
inode in the table. The index of the slot is the same as the index in the table.
And this explains the name inode being a short name for <em>index node</em>.</p>

<h3 id="data-blocks">Data blocks</h3>

<p>As the name suggests, the data blocks are the blocks where the actual data
belonging to a file is written. These blocks are also used for different
purposes which we will see shortly.</p>

<h2 id="pointing-to-data">Pointing to data</h2>

<p>The inode needs to have a way of pointing to the data blocks that assemble the
file. The simplest way is to have <strong>direct pointers</strong>. In this case, each
pointer points to a block that has some of the file data. The problem is that
large files; where the size exceeds the number of direct pointers an inode can
have; are not supported in this mode. One way of overcoming this issue is to use
<strong>indirect pointers</strong>, which instead of storing user data they store pointers to
blocks that hold user data. For larger files, another layer of indirection is
added with <strong>double indirect pointers</strong>. And for even larger files, <strong>triple
indirect pointers</strong> are put to use.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="https://wiki.carlosgaldino.com/public/images/io_direct_pointers.svg" alt="">
    <figcaption>Inode multi-level index</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>To give an idea of the largest file size that each level permit let‚Äôs run an
example considering that each block size is 4 KiB. Research has shown that the
majority of files are small [1] so 12 direct pointers would allow for files up
to 48 KiB. Considering that each pointer takes 4 bytes, a single indirect
pointer would then allow a file to be up to around 4 MiB:</p>

<pre>(12 + 1024) * 4 KiB
</pre>

<p>With the addition of double indirect pointers the size would jump to around 4
GiB:</p>

<pre>(12 + 1024 + 1024<sup>2</sup>) * 4 KiB
</pre>

<p>And finally, with triple indirect pointers the files could have a size of around
4 TiB:</p>

<pre>(12 + 1024 + 1024<sup>2</sup> + 1024<sup>3</sup>) * 4 KiB
</pre>

<p>This approach might not be very efficient for handling large files. For example,
a file of 100 MiB requires the allocation of 25600 blocks. The performance can
be severely impacted in case the blocks were fragmented over the disk.</p>

<p>Some file systems use <strong>extents</strong> to help with this situation. In this approach,
there is a single pointer and a length to tell that the data starts at the
address of the pointer and runs for the given range of blocks. In our example
above, describing the same file would use a single extent of size 100 MiB.
Multiple extents can be used to support larger files.</p>

<h2 id="directories">Directories</h2>

<p>You may have noticed that there isn‚Äôt a specific structure for directories. The
reason behind it is the fact that inodes represent both files and directories.
The difference is in what is stored in the corresponding data blocks.
Directories are simply a list of all files that it includes. Each entry has the
form of <code>(name, index number)</code> so when looking up a particular file (or another
directory), the system uses the <code>name</code> to find the corresponding inode.</p>

<p>Searching for a file can be slow if a directory contains a large number of
files. This issue can be mitigated by maintaining the list sorted and using
binary search, or instead of representing it as a list, a hash table or a
balanced search tree could also be used.</p>

<h2 id="access-paths">Access paths</h2>

<h3 id="read">Read</h3>

<p>When reading from a file, the file system needs to traverse the entire path,
visiting each inode along the way until reaching the inode for the desired file.
Assuming the user has permission to access the file, the file system consults
which blocks are associated with it and then read the solicited data from them.</p>

<h3 id="write">Write</h3>

<p>When writing to a file, the same process has to happen to find the corresponding
inode. If a new block is required for the write, the file system has to allocate
the block, update the associated information (bitmap and inode), and write to
the block. So one write operation requires five I/O operations: one read to the
bitmap, one write to mark the new block as occupied, two to read and write to
the inode, and one writing the data in the block. This number can increase when
creating a new file because now the associated information of the directory also
has to be read and written to reflect this new file, and operations to create a
new inode.</p>

<h2 id="gotenksfs">GotenksFS</h2>

<p>As a side project, I decided to write my own file system in Rust as I‚Äôm learning
the language. Some aspects are inspired by ext4 [2] (and family), and in this
section, you will learn more about it. The file system uses FUSE [3], and the
disk is represented as a regular file. The block size can be configured as 1
KiB, 2 KiB, or 4 KiB. Files can have a size of up to 4 GiB for block sizes of 4
KiB while the file system could theoretically be up to 16 TiB in size.</p>

<h3 id="mkfs"><code>mkfs</code></h3>

<p>The first step is to create the image itself with the configuration values for
the file system. This is achieved via the <code>mkfs</code> command:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>$ </span>./gotenksfs mkfs disk.img <span>-s</span> <span>"10 GiB"</span> <span>-b</span> 4096
</code></pre></div>

<p>After running the command, the image is created with a total size of 10 GiB, and
each block in the file system has a size of 4 KiB.</p>

<p>In this step, the configuration values and other structures such as a root
directory are written to the image in the first block: the superblock. Its
corresponding bitmap entries, and data are also written. These values will be
necessary for the next step: mounting the file system.</p>

<h3 id="mount"><code>mount</code></h3>

<p>After creating the image, we need to mount it so we can start using it. The
<code>mount</code> command is used for this:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>$ </span>./gotenksfs mount disk.img gotenks
</code></pre></div>

<p>And you can see some information about it:</p>

<figure>

    <figcaption>File system after mounting</figcaption>
</figure>

<h3 id="on-disk-structure">On-disk structure</h3>

<p>The superblock is written in the first 1024 bytes, and it holds the
configuration values provided in the <code>mkfs</code> command.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>pub</span> <span>struct</span> <span>Superblock</span> <span>{</span>

    <span>pub</span> <span>checksum</span><span>:</span> <span>u32</span><span>,</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>The next two blocks represent the data bitmap and inode bitmap. Then, a run of
<code>n</code> blocks are used for the inode table. And the blocks following that are the
ones where user data will be written.</p>

<p>The inode is defined as follows:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>pub</span> <span>struct</span> <span>Inode</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>pub</span> <span>mode</span><span>:</span> <span>libc</span><span>::</span><span>mode_t</span><span>,</span>

    <span>pub</span> <span>changed_at</span><span>:</span> <span>Option</span><span>&lt;</span><span>i64</span><span>&gt;</span><span>,</span>
    <span>pub</span> <span>direct_blocks</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>u32</span><span>;</span> <span>DIRECT_POINTERS</span> <span>as</span> <span>usize</span><span>],</span>

    <span>pub</span> <span>checksum</span><span>:</span> <span>u32</span><span>,</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>As you can see above, inodes support double indirect pointers which means that
for a disk with a block size of 4 KiB, the maximum capacity of a file is 4 GiB.
The number of direct pointers is set to 12:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>pub</span> <span>const</span> <span>DIRECT_POINTERS</span><span>:</span> <span>u64</span> <span>=</span> <span>12</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>When starting the FS for the first time, it will create the root directory using
the definition below:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>pub</span> <span>struct</span> <span>Directory</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>pub</span> <span>entries</span><span>:</span> <span>BTreeMap</span><span>&lt;</span><span>OsString</span><span>,</span> <span>u32</span><span>&gt;</span><span>,</span>
    <span>checksum</span><span>:</span> <span>u32</span><span>,</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<h3 id="block-groups">Block groups</h3>

<p>The inode bitmap has 4 KiB meaning that each bitmap block will have a capacity
for 32768 inodes. Suppose we round up the size of an <code>Inode</code> to 128 bytes; the
corresponding inode table will require 4 MiB of space. One of the ways for
structuring them would be to have many blocks dedicated to the bitmaps, then the
corresponding number blocks to store the inodes, and the remaining blocks for
user data.</p>

<p>Instead of doing that, we can create <em>block groups</em> that will always have one
block for the data bitmap and one for the inode bitmap. The next 1024 blocks
contain the inode table, and following that, 32768 blocks which are used for
user data.</p>

<!--
For a disk as in our case of 10 GiB, how many blocks should be dedicated to inode bitmaps?

Increasing the number of blocks to be inode bitmaps reduces the amount of available data blocks. And reducing the number of inode bitmaps restricts the total number of files supported by the system.
-->

<h3 id="reading-and-writing-to-files">Reading and writing to files</h3>

<p>Now that the ‚Äúdisk‚Äù is set up, we can start writing and reading files from it. Creating a new directory using <code>mkdir</code>:</p>

<figure>
    <img src="https://blog.carlosgaldino.com/public/images/mkdir.gif" alt="">
    <figcaption>Creating a directory</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The process that occurs is the following: the system searches for the inode of
the root directory, looks up in which data block the contents are being written
to, allocates a new inode and data block for the new directory, writes the entry
to the root directory, and finally, writes the new directory to its data block.</p>

<p>Writing a new file follows a similar method. The system traverses the given path
until the final directory is reached and adds an entry representing the new
file.</p>

<p>The write function provides the path, buffer with the data, offset, and a file
info struct that may hold a file handle along with extra information about the
file:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>fn</span> <span>write</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>mut</span> <span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>path</span><span>:</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>Path</span><span>,</span> <span>buf</span><span>:</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>[</span><span>u8</span><span>],</span> <span>offset</span><span>:</span> <span>u64</span><span>,</span> <span>file_info</span><span>:</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>mut</span> <span>fuse_rs</span><span>::</span><span>fs</span><span>::</span><span>WriteFileInfo</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>In this case, instead of traversing the path again to find the inode, the system
uses the file handle (the FS previously sets it when creating the file). With
the inode in hand, the FS can build the struct by seeking to the exact location
where the <code>Inode</code> is written:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>fn</span> <span>inode_offsets</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>index</span><span>:</span> <span>u32</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>(</span><span>u64</span><span>,</span> <span>u64</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>

<p>Now that the FS has information about which data blocks are currently allocated
to the <code>Inode</code>, it can use them to find the exact location where to write the
data, in a process similar as shown above. New blocks are first added to the
<code>Inode</code> direct blocks array, and if the file size exceeds <code>(12 * BLOCK_SIZE)</code>,
the FS allocates an <code>indirect_block</code> that holds the numbers identifying other
blocks containing user data. And in the case the file is even bigger requiring
more blocks, the system adds an extra layer of indirection using the
<code>double_indirect_block</code> field which points to more indirect blocks. Reading from
a file follows the same method. You can see it running here:</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>The idea behind a file system is to define a structure for the contents on disk
which then allow the system to operate on top of it when creating, writing and
reading from files and directories.</p>

<p>We learned some of the concepts used for the on-disk format, how directories and
files are represented. One interesting aspect is the usage of indirect pointers
to allow storing large files. If you are interested in learning more about file
systems, I would recommend reading more about other techniques that are used
such as journaling, copy-on-write, log-structured file systems, and also how
modern file systems apply these and other techniques. Maybe start learning about
the one you are using right now.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Just as social media has become ubiquitous in academia, its established formats and dynamics have been brought into doubt. </em><strong>Bj√∂rn&nbsp;</strong><strong>Brembs </strong><em>argues that learned societies concerned with their core mission as societies should engage and lead developments on federated social media platforms, such as Mastodon.</em></p>
<hr>
<p>Maybe scholarly societies have taken the instruction to follow the money too literally? There now are <a href="https://doi.org/10.1098/rsos.230207" target="_blank" rel="noopener">societies</a> that make 83% of their nearly $700 million in revenue from publishing (American Chemical Society). Or 88% of $130 million (American Psychological Association). Or 91% of $5 million (Biochemical Society). In essence, societies like these (there are hundreds predominantly in STEM subjects) are publishers first and societies second. One could be forgiven if one imagined their business meetings involved intoning, ‚ÄúPublish or perish‚Äù.</p>
<p>But, there‚Äôs more. Some of these organizations have sided with corporate publishers against scholarship, e.g., when <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/court-demands-search-engines-and-internet-service-providers-block-sci-hub" target="_blank" rel="noopener">litigating</a><a href="https://en.harrisco.net/blog/elsevier-and-american-chemical-society-sue-sci-hub-for-copyright-infringement/"> against</a> organisations or individuals striving to make research more accessible, or <a href="https://medium.com/@brembs/learned-societies-lean-to-the-green-f904336f51ad" target="_blank" rel="noopener">begging nationalist leaders</a> to protect their dated business models. Can it still be considered ethical to charge multiples of the publication costs of an article in order to finance executive salaries, subsidise member dues, sponsor prizes, host all-you-can-drink receptions at annual meetings, or pay lawyers to ensure nobody can read the works of your scholars?</p>
<blockquote><p>There is a reason these organisations were called ‚Äúsocieties‚Äù before they became publishers.</p></blockquote>
<p>This single-minded focus becomes more absurd if one considers the role societies have played in pursuing their primary mission as ‚Äòsocieties‚Äô: supporting scholars in making connections to like-minded individuals, exchanging ideas and promoting their respective fields of scholarly interest ‚Äì in short ‚Äòsocialising‚Äô. There is a reason these organisations were called ‚Äúsocieties‚Äù before they became publishers. The root of their names contains their essential function, as <a href="https://books.google.de/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=a5FbAAAAQAAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA1&amp;ots=MuxhHqH8ka&amp;sig=bIroAVU46xA-YO4j7WbwgehekT8&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" target="_blank" rel="noopener">described</a> in 1660 for one of the first such societies, the Royal Society:</p>
<p><em>‚ÄúTheir first purpose was no more, then onely the satisfaction of breathing a freer air, and of conversing in quiet one with another, without being ingag‚Äôd in the passions, and madness of that dismal Age‚Äù.</em></p>
<p>It is ironic that these very societies, born in an era of intellectual enlightenment, seem to have missed the memo about social media‚Äôs advent some 15 years ago. A technology that has not only transformed their mission, but even shares the root of their names. These organisations could have embraced FriendFeed or Facebook. Yet, maybe many felt the threat such <a href="https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/impactofsocialsciences/2017/06/06/introducing-canary-haz-discovering-article-pdfs-with-one-click/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">#icanhazpdf</a>-technology may pose to their bottom line so acutely, they failed to envisage the opportunities it offered? Each scholarly society is different and many have belatedly embraced social technologies. However, it appears as if this engagement has only rarely exceeded the use of corporate platforms as broadcasting tools, rather than as a social technology that encourages, promotes and protects social interactions among scholars and with the general public.</p>
<blockquote><p>the ‚ÄòFediverse‚Äô provides tools and technologies that are ideally suited to bring scholarly societies out of their digital caves and into the 21st century.</p></blockquote>
<p>Today, we have technology that allows scholarly societies to make good on past mistakes and show their true colours: the ‚ÄòFediverse‚Äô provides tools and technologies that are ideally suited to bring scholarly societies out of their digital caves and into the 21st century. One of these is <a href="https://joinmastodon.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mastodon</a>. While some scholarly institutions, including some societies, have started to implement their own Mastodon instances, the large majority remain locked into their favourite corporate broadcasting platform formerly known as Twitter. A platform that is rapidly <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/sep/26/eu-warns-elon-musk-that-twitter-x-must-comply-with-fake-news-laws" target="_blank" rel="noopener">devolving</a> and losing many of its <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-02554-0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">academic members</a>.</p>
<p>Where scholarly societies have seriously engaged with social technologies, they are using them not just for broadcasting, but for scholarly exchange and to facilitate social interactions, such as debate, discussion and critique among all persons interested in their research, not just their members. The different local and federated timelines in Mastodon allow seamless interactions both within the society and outside of it. Federation choices enable societies to choose which content matches their instance and they become the moderators of their own social media presence, rather than having to rely on the <a href="https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/impactofsocialsciences/2022/05/03/leave-adapt-resist-time-to-rethink-academic-twitter/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">whims of billionaires</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>Due to the open source nature of the Fediverse and the widespread digital competence in the scholarly community, there is ample potential for societies to take a central role in developing a new scholarly commons</p></blockquote>
<p>Where are the societies that see this opportunity that could give marginalised groups within scholarship a voice in a town square protected by scholarly rules? Rather than being another content provider for AdTech-based surveillance platforms, societies now have the opportunity (again!) to become the designers of a new kind of digital scholarship, while at the same time contributing to protecting the privacy of scholars. Due to the open source nature of the Fediverse and the widespread digital competence in the scholarly community, there is ample potential for societies to take a central role in developing a new scholarly commons and integrate this social layer into the more formal literature as part of the ‚Äú<a href="https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2023/05/23/council-calls-for-transparent-equitable-and-open-access-to-scholarly-publications/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">open, interoperable, not-for-profit infrastructures</a>‚Äù the Council of the EU science ministers has recently called for.</p>
<p>Of course, their handling of social technology is just a litmus test for how seriously a learned society is taking its role in our modern world and what perspective it has taken with regard to scholarship more generally. It doesn‚Äôt seem like too many societies are passing that test these days and maybe for some their predilection for excessive executive pay is to blame?</p>
<p>So, to the scholarly societies out there, here‚Äôs a challenge: step up, embrace Mastodon, and give faux-societies a run for their money. Show scholars you‚Äôre for scholarship and not just the bottom line.</p>

Then it's a matter of trying things and banging your head against the wall a lot, e.g. at some point I was interested in how compilers worked so I tried hacking typescript syntax support into babel (circa 2017 maybe) - I got pretty far! and got a lot better sense of how compilers work.

It doesn‚Äôt mean you have The Knowledge that makes you a ‚Äò10x developer‚Äô or whatever anywhere you work. In fact, it could mean that your mind has been poisoned by a Big Tech working style, and you‚Äôve developed a bunch of habits that aren‚Äôt nearly as applicable to most other organisations.<p>I say this as someone that‚Äôs never worked for any tech company anybody has heard of, nor any hip SV startup.</p><p>It takes a particular sort of person to thrive in Big Tech. That isn‚Äôt just code for ‚Äòreally really really good‚Äô. It sounds like you still believe that it is. Plenty of ‚Äòreally really really good‚Äô people wouldn‚Äôt do well at Apple, and plenty wouldn‚Äôt want to work there. I wouldn‚Äôt necessarily call myself ‚Äòreally really really good‚Äô, but I know that I don‚Äôt want to work at Apple. Not because I think I‚Äôm not good enough, not because k don‚Äôt think that I could keep up, and not because I don‚Äôt like their output as a company.</p><p>Putting companies in a pedestal the way that you are is ultimately damaging for the industry. It fosters the increasingly cringey ‚Äúget a job at FAANG!!!‚Äù culture. I‚Äôm sick of my YouTube recommendations being poisoned with ‚Äúhere‚Äôs how you pass a system design interview at Google‚Äù BS. I implore you to stop putting companies on a pedestal. You need only look at accountants talking about working at the ‚Äòbig 4‚Äô to see how utterly ridiculous it can get.

As a JavaScript/TypeScript developer you can do the same shit everybody else does, which is put text on screen using a giant framework.  If that is the kind of employment you are looking for be prepared to degrade yourself to working with newbs that have high insecurity, low self-esteem, and spend all their time talking about how awesome they are.  Its all marketing all the time, no original application code, and outsourcing everything to some external tool.  As a developer you are a commodity product to hire/fire just like public is to social media.  This line of work no longer interested me, so I spent months unemployed figuring this out.</p><p>Instead your alternative as a JavaScript/TypeScript developer is niche skills, which is in higher demand than it sounds.  It seems almost nobody can figure out test automation in the browser.  Having application architecture skills is a huge plus, which typically means Java/C# and HTTP session management with something like Spring, but if you can demonstrate a more generalized approach to application architecture you have a skill that you can adapt to a bunch of different things.  It also helps having things like a security clearance and security certifications.  There are a huge number of cleared developer jobs that recruiters cannot fill.

                  <p><span>Well, a very long time ago, in a company funded far far away (and since defeated by the empire), I had the "joy" of working with Sendmail.  For you youngsters, back then, back when we had dial telephones (tell us more Grandpa!), there were multiple "mail networks", not just this fancy Internet you kids have.  Sendmail was a mail processor that could not only arrange to send and receive mail, but it could translate addressing between the different networks (ARPA, Bitnet, CSNET, UUCP, etc.)  The problem was, reading a sendmail config file was something like reading assembly code except you weren't allowed to by vowels.  It was nearly all symbols -- executable line noise.  
I got tired of working with it - so I wrote my own sendmail compiler/de-compiler of sorts just to work in English prose.  Got me my job at Sun.
These days, I'm not sure if it will let me keep my job, or be the justification for my losing it, but I'm working on a programming language for teens called Onyx (after my grandson, who has NO interest in this as he's intending to a be a pilot, but it means unless she works for Boeing, I'm safe for a few more years</span></p></div></td></tr>

It couldn't shred the MacBooks due to the aluminum case and we ended up smashing them with hammers in the parking lot.<p>When we got to Google of course privacy concerns blocked new data collection until we completed an overengineered project to build a shiny new database with access controls and stuff. About a year later with no technology progress to speak of, the whole eye tracking project was shelved due to a strategy pivot from higher up (unrelated to anything we were doing) and we all went our separate ways.

Starting in around 2000 or so, I started producing a lot of Perl modules (libraries). You can see what I've uploaded to CPAN at <a href="https://metacpan.org/author/DROLSKY" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://metacpan.org/author/DROLSKY</a>.<p>Some of those libraries became _very_ widely used in the Perl community. The number one most used is probably DateTime (<a href="https://metacpan.org/dist/DateTime" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://metacpan.org/dist/DateTime</a>), and number two is probably (<a href="https://metacpan.org/dist/Log-Dispatch" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://metacpan.org/dist/Log-Dispatch</a>). But some of the others also got a lot uptake.</p><p>I also contributed a lot to libraries create by others, most notably HTML::Mason and Moose, both of which were very widely used in Perl.</p><p>All of that, plus speaking at the Perl conferences, really helped me develop my professional network. If I recall correctly, all three of of my most recent jobs came about because of my Perl connections to varying degrees. Two of them were just because I posted on my blog that I was looking for work and someone I knew through Perl reached out.</p><p>Today I work in Golang at MongoDB. In 2022, I again posted that I was looking for something new and someone I knew from Perl who worked at MongoDB reached out to me. I'm really thankful he did, because working there has been great!</p><p>Nowadays I don't do much Perl any more, though I still maintain many of my modules (bug fixes and small feature requests only, though). I've also done some Golang (<a href="https://github.com/houseabsolute?q=&amp;type=public&amp;language=go">https://github.com/houseabsolute?q=&amp;type=public&amp;language=go</a>) and Rust (<a href="https://crates.io/users/autarch" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://crates.io/users/autarch</a>).</p><p>But I think it would be _much_ harder for a young person to do the same things I did. Nowadays there are just so many freaking programmers. Someone invents a new language and five minutes later there are a huge number of foundational libraries for it. By the time I started with Go (mid-2010s), pretty much all the stuff I had done in Perl already existed in Go. And I found the same to be true with Rust when I started using it after Go.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://github.com/quelsolaar/makemake">https://github.com/quelsolaar/makemake</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38511084">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-target="readme-toc.content">
            <article itemprop="text"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">MakeMake</h2>
<p dir="auto">MakeMake is a tool for generateing and running make files from C code. It does so by parsing the .c and .h files in the same directory as a starting file (usualy the C file containging main), and determains recursivly what files are required to build the project. make make does this by looking for any function declaration using extern, and the searches for the corresponding function definition.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">building MakeMake:</h3>
<p dir="auto">To build makemake on unix platform you can use the shellscript MakeMakeMake, it will not only build makemake, it will also run it, and it therefor takes the same parameters as MakeMake. To build makemake:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="chmod -x makemakemake.sh
./makemakemake.sh"><pre><code>chmod -x makemakemake.sh
./makemakemake.sh
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">If make a MakeMakeMake is given options it will run makemake and pass on the options to MakeMake. The MakeMakeMake script there for takes the exact same options as MakeMake. Once MakeMakeMake has built MakeMake you can call it directly.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Running MakeMake</h3>
<p dir="auto">To run MakeMake the comandline format is
makemake  &lt;options ...&gt;</p>
<p dir="auto">The C file path will be used to identify the starting C file and the path where it resides. This path is the path that will be searched for other .c and .h files for possible inclution in the build.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Options:</h3>
<p dir="auto">MakeMake can be given opetions in two ways, either using the comand line, or as pragmas in the .c and .h files. Each option consists of key-value pair, the name of the option and what the option is set to. The available options are:</p>
<p dir="auto">-name  Name of the executable.
-makefile  Name of the make file (or stdout).
-compilerflag  Custom compiler flags.
-platform  Platform define.
-dynamiclib  builds the application as a dynamicly linked library.
-lib  Library dependency.
-define  Adds a define.</p>
<p dir="auto">To use the options on the comand line use "-" followed by the option name and option.</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="Example: To build project with a specifird name you may call:
./makemake ./example.c -name my_example"><pre><code>Example: To build project with a specifird name you may call:
./makemake ./example.c -name my_example
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">To use options from within a .c or .h file, add MakeMake pragma in the following format:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="#pragma makemake <option name> <option value> <optional platform>"><pre><code>#pragma makemake &lt;option name&gt; &lt;option value&gt; &lt;optional platform&gt;
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">If for instanc you have a .c file that depends on PTreads on posix platforms, you may add the pragma:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="#pragma makemake lib lpthread posix"><pre><code>#pragma makemake lib lpthread posix
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">The MakeMake can also generate the MakeMakeMake script by calling:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="./makemake makemakemakemake"><pre><code>./makemake makemakemakemake
</code></pre></div>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Platforms</h3>
<p dir="auto">you can define as many platfroms as you want, if you do not define platforms on the command line, MakeMake will assume you are building for the platform you are on. For the following platforms, the pre defined platforms are:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="Linux: linux posix
Windows: win32
MacOS: macosx apple posix
Android: android posix"><pre><code>Linux: linux posix
Windows: win32
MacOS: macosx apple posix
Android: android posix
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">pragma directives with a given platform will only operate of that platform is defined. You can define your own platforms for setting options this way.</p>
<p dir="auto">Make make has been tested on Linux, MacOS, and Windows (Make files have been generated on windows, but not tested on windows)</p>
<p dir="auto">Thanks to the work of Felix Klinge, MakeMake supports Android and the plan is to add iOS support.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Test project</h3>
<p dir="auto">MakeMake comes with a simple "hello world" test project, called makemake_test... consisiting of 3 files. To test them call:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="chmod -x makemakemake.sh
./makemakemake.sh ./makemake_test_one.c"><pre><code>chmod -x makemakemake.sh
./makemakemake.sh ./makemake_test_one.c
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">The file makemake_test_one.c, will include makemake_test_two.h that declares a funtion defined in makemake_test_three.c</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">About the project</h3>
<p dir="auto">MakeMake was designed to solve my problem (Im a C developer that develops protable C programs using VisualStudio, and I do not want to maintain up todate make files for all projects and platforms). There are ways to write C code that makemake will not be able to parse, but for me that is a feature not a bug as it requires me to keep my code clean and simple.</p>
<p dir="auto">The main motivation for releasig MakeMake is to serve as a n inspiration for developers that they can wit relativly little effort build their own tooling, especially with a simple language like C. Feel free to be inspired by, use or fork the project.</p>
<p dir="auto">You can find my work on <a href="http://www.quelsolaar.com/" rel="nofollow">www.quelsolaar.com</a> and at @quelsolaar @eskilsteenberg, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@eskilsteenberg" rel="nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/@eskilsteenberg</a> you can also reach me at eskil at quelsolaar dot com.</p>

<p dir="auto">Make JSON greppable!</p>
<p dir="auto">gron transforms JSON into discrete assignments to make it easier to <code>grep</code> for what you want and see the absolute 'path' to it.
It eases the exploration of APIs that return large blobs of JSON but have terrible documentation.</p>
<pre>‚ñ∂ <b>gron</b> "https://api.github.com/repos/tomnomnom/gron/commits?per_page=1" | fgrep "commit.author"
json[0].commit.author = {};
json[0].commit.author.date = "2016-07-02T10:51:21Z";
json[0].commit.author.email = "mail@tomnomnom.com";
json[0].commit.author.name = "Tom Hudson";
</pre>
<p dir="auto">gron can work backwards too, enabling you to turn your filtered data back into JSON:</p>
<pre>‚ñ∂ gron "https://api.github.com/repos/tomnomnom/gron/commits?per_page=1" | fgrep "commit.author" | <b>gron --ungron</b>
[
  {
    "commit": {
      "author": {
        "date": "2016-07-02T10:51:21Z",
        "email": "mail@tomnomnom.com",
        "name": "Tom Hudson"
      }
    }
  }
]
</pre>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">Disclaimer: the GitHub API has fantastic documentation, but it makes for a good example.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Installation</h2>
<p dir="auto">gron has no runtime dependencies. You can just <a href="https://github.com/tomnomnom/gron/releases">download a binary for Linux, Mac, Windows or FreeBSD and run it</a>.
Put the binary in your <code>$PATH</code> (e.g. in <code>/usr/local/bin</code>) to make it easy to use:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="‚ñ∂ tar xzf gron-linux-amd64-0.1.5.tgz
‚ñ∂ sudo mv gron /usr/local/bin/"><pre><code>‚ñ∂ tar xzf gron-linux-amd64-0.1.5.tgz
‚ñ∂ sudo mv gron /usr/local/bin/
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">If you're a Mac user you can also <a href="http://braumeister.org/formula/gron" rel="nofollow">install gron via brew</a>:</p>

<p dir="auto">Or if you're a Go user you can use <code>go install</code>:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="‚ñ∂ go install github.com/tomnomnom/gron@latest"><pre><code>‚ñ∂ go install github.com/tomnomnom/gron@latest
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">It's recommended that you alias <code>ungron</code> or <code>norg</code> (or both!) to <code>gron --ungron</code>. Put something like this in your shell profile (e.g. in <code>~/.bashrc</code>):</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="alias norg=&quot;gron --ungron&quot;
alias ungron=&quot;gron --ungron&quot;"><pre><code>alias norg="gron --ungron"
alias ungron="gron --ungron"
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Or you could create a shell script in your $PATH named <code>ungron</code> or <code>norg</code> to affect all users:</p>

<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Usage</h2>
<p dir="auto">Get JSON from a file:</p>

<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">FAQ</h2>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Wasn't this written in PHP before?</h3>
<p dir="auto">Yes it was! The original version is <a href="https://github.com/tomnomnom/gron/blob/master/original-gron.php">preserved here for posterity</a>.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Why the change to Go?</h3>
<p dir="auto">Mostly to remove PHP as a dependency. There's a lot of people who work with JSON who don't have PHP installed.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Why shouldn't I just use jq?</h3>
<p dir="auto"><a href="https://stedolan.github.io/jq/" rel="nofollow">jq</a> is <em>awesome</em>, and a lot more powerful than gron, but with that power comes
complexity. gron aims to make it easier to use the tools you already know, like <code>grep</code> and <code>sed</code>.</p>
<p dir="auto">gron's primary purpose is to make it easy to find the path to a value in a deeply nested JSON blob
when you don't already know the structure; much of jq's power is unlocked only once you know that structure.</p>

That once the winter was over she wouldn‚Äôt need me anymore.&nbsp;</p><p>I had this feeling because it hadn‚Äôt started like my other relationships. I‚Äôd kept seeing her at parties with all the Toronto grad students that autumn and thought she was so different from me. Whatever the opposite of basic is. Advanced? I had the feeling she didn‚Äôt even own sweatpants, if that makes sense. She‚Äôd see me across the party and would watch me but wouldn‚Äôt return my waves. Somehow she found out I had a crush on her and it didn‚Äôt change anything. Just the stare, maybe a polite nod, then she‚Äôd go back to half-listening to whoever was trying to impress her. She was beautiful like an ice sculpture is beautiful.</p><p>I knew her thesis was on Italian autonomist feminism of the 1970s. I had no idea what that meant so I never risked talking to her and embarrassing myself. My thesis was on the history of memes. I wanted to change it but didn‚Äôt know what else I could talk about.&nbsp;</p><p>Then one night she called me. The wind of the first real snowstorm whistled through my window and made me cover my other ear while I listened to her talk to me for the first time. She told me she found me really pretty. That she‚Äôd always admired me from a distance. And would I come over?</p><p>We didn‚Äôt talk much that night or any night after. But on the subway back to my apartment in North York the next morning, in between games of Candy Crush, I realized we were going out. I had a nagging feeling I couldn‚Äôt explain though. Before she‚Äôd kissed me she‚Äôd told me that she‚Äôd been in a long distance relationship and they‚Äôd broken up that day. It flattered me that I was who she called but it wasn‚Äôt exactly romantic.&nbsp;</p><p>I only worried I was a placeholder girlfriend in the back of my mind though, like when I woke up or when videos were loading. It became real when I saw the list. When I saw the rubric.</p><p>She had been at the university and needed files off her computer. I was lazing around in her living room. I had four roommates and she had none. I should have been working on my thesis, but I enjoyed being in an apartment without roommates so much that I was just laying around listening to my Harry Potter podcasts. I didn‚Äôt know if she had rent control or was just rich but she did have an office. She was like what I imagined a grad student should be. She had me go into her office and she walked me through transferring the files. But she had left a spreadsheet open.</p><p>I tried not to look but I think that‚Äôs actually impossible. Because I saw my name at the top. And I saw numbers and a whole column of red cells. And then it clicked.</p><p>If you saw a sheet rating you in bed out of 10, with a hundred other ratings too, you would look. You would peek.</p><p>‚ÄúHey?‚Äù she said over the phone. ‚ÄúDid it go through?‚Äù</p><p>‚ÄúOh,‚Äù I said. I clicked through the remaining buttons. ‚ÄúYeah. Yeah. There should be an email.‚Äù I swallowed dryly. ‚ÄúYou should have everything.‚Äù</p><p>‚ÄúAwesome. Okay, got it. Gotta run, bye!‚Äù</p><p>Then I was left with the sheet.</p><p>I tried not to keep reading. I tried to tell myself it was private. But it wasn‚Äôt. It was about me, so it wasn‚Äôt private. And then when I started to read it, started understanding what the numbers meant, I tried to tell myself I‚Äôd seen enough, I didn‚Äôt need to keep reading. But I did. I couldn‚Äôt stop.</p><p><em>Humor </em><strong>2.0</strong></p><p><em>Movie Taste </em><strong>5.0</strong></p><p><em>Love-making </em><strong>6.5</strong></p><p>I scrolled and scrolled. There were a hundred cells and almost every one was red. Almost every mark was shitty. The only green was:&nbsp;</p><p><em>Beauty </em><strong>8.0</strong></p><p><span>The fact that that was the only one where I passed made the whole thing even worse. Everything cut me. </span><em>Gift-giving. Punctuality. Memory.</em><span> The notes beside them only hurt more (‚Äúonly funny unintentionally‚Äù, ‚Äúun-self-aware Harry Potter nostalgia‚Äù, ‚ÄúPillow princess‚Äù). I was mortified but I couldn‚Äôt stop reading. It even seemed like there were categories specifically invented to hurt me (</span><em>Freckles</em><strong>: 2</strong><span>). And there were others with entirely no explanation, just there to haunt (</span><em>Friends: </em><strong>4.5</strong><span>).</span></p><p><span>The worst part was that it all seemed true. It became clear as soon as I read it. I wasn‚Äôt smart enough (</span><strong>5.0</strong><span>) to create a narrative where I was actually a really good listener, I had just always hidden from myself the fact that I was a bad listener (</span><strong>3.0</strong><span>). My entire personality was getting pulled back like a hangnail.&nbsp;</span></p><p>My mind raced through thoughts until it settled on three it repeated over and over and over:</p><ul><li><p>Your girlfriend should think of you as a ten in everything.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>No. You aren‚Äôt even supposed to think these things.</p></li><li><p>Why doesn‚Äôt she just break up with me?</p></li></ul><p>It burned through me until, finally, I reached the bottom. Then I truly broke down, staring at the big, bold, red cell:&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Status: Temporary</strong></p><p><span>If I had any </span><em>Imagination</em><span> (another </span><strong>2.0</strong><span>) I‚Äôd say something like: it made me feel like the sun laying down its judgment upon one of the barren and useless planets near it. But all I could really say is: it made me want to die. It made me cry huge gobby tears all over her desk and I should have realized that would happen because I was too </span><em>Emotional</em><span> (</span><strong>4.0</strong><span>). It made me wail like a child on the floor of her stupid, parent-paid office.</span></p><p>After minutes of this, it made me want revenge.&nbsp;</p><p>For one horrible second I contemplated killing her but that was wildly out of proportion and then I tried to pretend that I had only wished she was dead and then I just tried to forget about it.</p><p>My mom says that the best revenge is a life well lived. When I met my dad I asked him about that and he laughed oddly loudly and said once you‚Äôre thinking about getting revenge it‚Äôs too late to have a good life. Then he took pictures with me and the zoo pandas behind us and I never saw him again.</p><p><span>When I tried imagining a good life I couldn‚Äôt. I couldn‚Äôt imagine going to work thinking about my </span><em>Work ethic </em><span>(</span><strong>2.5</strong><span>) or </span><em>Problem-solving</em><span> (</span><strong>5.5</strong><span>) or </span><em>Punctuality</em><span> (</span><strong>4.0</strong><span>). I couldn‚Äôt imagine going to a party ever again with my lack of </span><em>Fashion</em><span> (</span><strong>6.0</strong><span>) and </span><em>Wit</em><span> (</span><strong>2.0</strong><span>). I‚Äôd always imagined that if I was on the run for a crime I‚Äôd hide away as a nun, but even that wouldn‚Äôt work because I had no </span><em>Patience</em><span> (</span><strong>3.0</strong><span>).</span></p><p>But then I realized that I hadn‚Äôt understood what a good life could be. I hadn‚Äôt been thinking about just how good life could be.&nbsp;</p><p><span>It‚Äôs all just numbers. It‚Äôs all just 1 to 10 (besides the 0 I got for math). If I changed, if I got everything to a 10, wouldn‚Äôt that mean that her wisdom was low? What I mean is, wouldn‚Äôt that show what an idiot she was? Right now if I told anybody about the list they‚Äôd think she was a monster. But they‚Äôd also know she was right and would reflect on how pathetic I was. But if I revealed the list after becoming a 10 in everything they‚Äôd think about how pathetic </span><em>she</em><span> was. An idiot and</span><em> </em><span>a monster. They‚Äôd say to me: who‚Äôs that girl you‚Äôre with? Is she your placeholder girlfriend? They‚Äôd say that to </span><em>me.</em></p><p><span>I got up off the floor. I went to the computer. I scrolled back to ambition, way at the beginning of her hundred row sheet. Its </span><strong>2.5</strong><span> stared at me. I changed it to a </span><strong>10</strong><span>.</span></p><p>The first thing I decided to learn was how to learn. I had to learn a lot of things so I had to do it fast and right. It was the beginning of winter and I wanted to emerge in spring like a cherry blossom or whatever kind of blossoms happen in spring. I wanted her to melt in embarrassment like the snow.</p><p>The problem was that I knew my mind just didn‚Äôt work like that. It liked going slowly. And detours. But I knew it was possible to change how your mind works, like melting an old ring into a pretty one. I went to some of the grad students and bought up the hallucinogens they were researching. Then I put all of them as far back on my tongue as I could, swallowed two big glasses of water, sat in my lightless room with my headphones on, and willed myself to become a good learner. I imagined squeezing my brain like play-doh until I could be like those robots that learn things faster than any human and it makes them powerful beyond belief.</p><p>Over the next 12 hours my mind split apart. When it reformed, it reformed softer. More ready. More malleable.</p><p><span>When I went back to the grad students the next day to swear them in as my practice partners, they joked they were worried about me but I could tell they were intrigued. Internally I changed my </span><em>Interesting</em><span> score from </span><strong>1.0</strong><span> to </span><strong>10</strong><span>.&nbsp;</span></p><p>Then began the work.</p><p>If you like, imagine a training montage. I really like the one in Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix when they‚Äôre all getting good at spells together. I knew I needed my own team but it had to be a secret. I had to take her by surprise. I‚Äôd meet my partners in hidden classrooms, prayer rooms, their apartments.&nbsp;</p><p>The grad students were all so curious and I knew I could use it. I swore each of them individually into secrecy. They all hated working on their theses. They were all bundled up in little apartments around the university waiting for spring like hibernating bears. It was like I could give them one little dream they didn‚Äôt understand but would always remember.</p><p><span>One guy was my </span><em>Humor</em><span> partner. I admitted to him that I didn‚Äôt really get jokes. I would just watch for other peoples‚Äô reactions and nobody ever noticed me laughing a little late. He explained that it‚Äôs mostly about timing and the unexpected and being animated. ‚ÄúLike this?‚Äù I said, a little loudly and suddenly. He laughed, which I thought was good, but he said ‚ÄúNo, you need energy. People aren‚Äôt entertained by a rock.‚Äù</span></p><p><span>So we drilled it. ‚ÄúAyyyy babe,‚Äù I‚Äôd say as I walked in to a session, or ‚ÄúYo!‚Äù Then I‚Äôd tease him, or myself, or our crazy mayor. I had a running joke with him about the snow (‚ÄúWhat if we put all the global warming in Toronto?‚Äù). Very soon, he was chortling and sometimes outright laughing. </span><strong>10</strong><span>.</span></p><p><span>One girl was my </span><em>Culture</em><span> partner. I explained that I needed to become ‚Äúcultured‚Äù. She asked what I meant and I admitted I didn‚Äôt know. Well, I had just come from a joke session, so what I said was ‚ÄúI was hoping you could tell me!‚Äù She laughed. But then she assigned me reading.</span></p><p>I had become very good at reading. Before my dark night of the soul I had only been seeing words. After that I saw ideas. I could rotate them and connect them like Lego. Reading the words was now as easy as grabbing a big handful of Lego.&nbsp;</p><p><span>I read through poetry and fiction and commentary and letters from this century and many others. The letters were my favourite because the writers didn‚Äôt take them as seriously as the books. I was big into not taking things too seriously now. Before it had bothered me that I was low on both </span><em>Ambition</em><span> and </span><em>Chill</em><span> (</span><strong>6.0</strong><span>). But now I was at </span><strong>10</strong><span> for both. I was going to humiliate my evil girlfriend. But I was chill about it because I knew it would happen.&nbsp;</span></p><p>My favourite writers were not chill. They were fucked up. I remembered that my girlfriend‚Äôs favourite writer was Sylvia Plath so I got really into her husband and the people Plath admired and considered better than her.&nbsp;</p><p><span>This didn‚Äôt take long at all. When my writing conspirator asked about my thesis on memes, I explained memetic contagion instead, including an aside on Burroughs‚Äôs assertion that language is a virus from outer space. When she asked which Beatle was best, I proved that Yoko Ono was superior. She was delighted. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs going on with you. But would you review my novel when it‚Äôs ready?‚Äù I said yes, of course. </span><em>Culture</em><span>: </span><strong>10</strong><span>. And a bonus to </span><em>Selflessness</em><span> as well.</span></p><p><span>Both of those were hours in the morning. I wasn‚Äôt working on my thesis anymore. It could wait until spring. Instead I was doing eight sessions a day. When I solved a trait another one came in. At the bottom of winter, when the sun only peeks out at noon and then retreats, I added </span><em>Lovemaking</em><span>. I found a guy I had hooked up with in first year and told him I wanted to make love every weekday at 3PM. I wanted to become the best lover he could ever imagine. Because my thoughtfulness score was going up I asked him: How did that make him feel? Did any reservations come to mind? Would he like to take a few days to think about it?</span></p><p><span>He replied "Nah I'm down." So we began. I will spare you details about our progress. I will say that at first he didn‚Äôt understand the feedback phase but he came to appreciate it. I will say that he became a </span><strong>10</strong><span> lover as well.&nbsp;</span></p><p>Throughout all of this I saw my girlfriend less but not so little she‚Äôd dump me. I hid all my new powers besides the lovemaking from her. I knew that that would draw her in because she was shallow. Only shallow people make a sheet. Only shallow people rate their girlfriend‚Äôs tenderness out of 10.</p><p><span>Or at least that‚Äôs how I thought at first. Each time I hit a </span><strong>10</strong><span> I‚Äôd think about what number she‚Äôd have. She didn‚Äôt have much </span><em>Humor </em><span>either, maybe a </span><strong>5</strong><span>. She wasn‚Äôt that </span><em>Chill</em><span> ‚Äî if you have a home office and desk and two monitors you aren‚Äôt </span><em>Chill</em><span>. She was only a </span><strong>10</strong><span> lover when I was a </span><strong>10</strong><span> lover with her.&nbsp;</span></p><p>Those were the hardest moments. We‚Äôd lay there gasping and I‚Äôd always tell her I‚Äôd need to clean up. But in the washroom I‚Äôd just shake and open the window and let the Toronto winter dive into my lungs and I‚Äôd wonder if I was doing the right thing. I was becoming a more thoughtful person and I knew revenge was wrong. I knew I didn‚Äôt wish my pain on anybody so why was I making an exception for her?&nbsp;</p><p><span>But I had to keep going. I had become a </span><strong>10</strong><span> in so many things that I couldn‚Äôt stop now. Thoughtfulness could be the last thing. I could even finish it a little after my big reveal. Not yet. Part of my thoughtfulness was realizing that nobody is perfect.</span></p><p>But I was getting there. I was closing in, more relentless than the blizzards that year, which came down like snow dumped from buckets.&nbsp;</p><p>I knew I was still emotional. My partner for that was an econ student. We met in her apartment on St. George Street just north of the university. I‚Äôd originally chosen her because I‚Äôd assumed an econ student would be more emotionally stable than all the humanities grads I knew. Honestly, I thought she‚Äôd be boring. I didn‚Äôt know how passionate she was.&nbsp;</p><p>She showed me pictures of dying animals and the horrible stories of how they‚Äôd become separated from their mothers. It made me weep.&nbsp;</p><p>She explained that people mostly donate to their universities and churches but for a little money you could save a child from a horrible death. It made me rage at people‚Äôs ignorance.&nbsp;</p><p>Finally, I made her tell me a story about a woman named Alice who rated her girlfriend Roberta and rated her badly. I wanted to be so emotionally strong that I could handle the greatest embarrassment of my life. But I couldn‚Äôt. It made me leave the session and wander the Annex pretending I was somebody else.</p><p>For a few days I tried becoming emotionless about these. I tried turning all my emotions off like taps. She realized what was going on. ‚ÄúLook. I can tell you‚Äôre still emotional even if you‚Äôre trying not to show it‚Äù. I was impressed by her wisdom. ‚ÄúYou can have emotional responses,‚Äù she continued. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs healthy. These are horrible things. You just need to not let it ruin you. You need to have a plan for how to deal with it.‚Äù</p><p>The next day, when she showed me a dying bird, a single tear ran down my eye. I said: ‚ÄúWe humans should disrupt the natural environment less.‚Äù&nbsp;</p><p>Then she showed me a child dying of malaria. I shook my head and said ‚ÄúHumans should try to be as effective with their charitable giving as they are with their big purchases. We have so much potential to do good in the world.‚Äù</p><p>Then she told me the story of the cruel girlfriend Alice again like I'd asked. She didn‚Äôt know it was my story, of course, but she was a good storyteller and some of the details were correct. She had Roberta (me) sobbing and everything.</p><p>When she finished I was proud. I had lasted through the whole thing. I had cried but not loudly, just little hiccup-y gasps. I looked up at her and said: "Roberta should get revenge."</p><p>‚ÄúRevenge?‚Äù She looked surprised. ‚ÄúI get something like‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know, but revenge is a leap.‚Äù</p><p>‚ÄúWhy not?‚Äù I asked. ‚ÄúAlice hurt her more than should even be possible.‚Äù The sky in the apartment windows was blue, a March-bright blue, and the glare made it hard for me to focus on her eyes, which were brighter than anybody‚Äôs I‚Äôd stared into all winter.</p><p>‚ÄúYeah but like. This says way more about her than about her girlfriend.‚Äù</p><p>‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù</p><p>‚ÄúAlice is crazy. If you make a sheet ranking a hundred attributes of your lover, you‚Äôre crazy, right?‚Äù</p><p>‚ÄúYeah, so?‚Äù</p><p>‚ÄúSo why would Roberta trust or care what Alice says about her? Why would Alice have a clue about any of this? I don‚Äôt think Alice knows the first thing about anything.‚Äù</p><p>I stopped myself from telling her I knew it was all true. I stopped myself from explaining that my girlfriend had known me better than I‚Äôd known myself. I was open mouthed and had nothing to say.</p><p>‚ÄúHonestly, I feel sad for Alice, she‚Äôs so confused,‚Äù she continued. ‚ÄúI‚Äôd feel even worse for her if Roberta humiliated her. Would it be at a party or something? That would just suck.‚Äù</p><p>I stopped myself from telling her the contents of my revenge. But she was right. I had imagined it culminating in a party. I had imagined becoming the life of the party. In my first year I didn‚Äôt know anything about alcohol and when we played beer pong I was drinking pure vodka and I became drunker than anything and I suppose technically I was the life of the party because I got crazy nicknames that night. But this wouldn‚Äôt be like that at all. I‚Äôd actually be the life of the party. I‚Äôd be so interesting that people would tell each other they were going to the washroom but instead they‚Äôd come see me. If anybody got too drunk I‚Äôd lend them my spare room and appoint two trustworthy watchers. When, I‚Äôd return I‚Äôd turn it into a dance party complete with the playlist I‚Äôd been making for months. I would grab men and women and bring them to dance with me and I‚Äôd dance so well they wouldn‚Äôt be afraid to dance well too. I would make sure everybody would leave the party feeling not just that they were lucky to be there, but that I felt lucky to have them. Then I would retire with my girlfriend. I would make love to her perfectly. Then, a little while later, I would tell her she was a monster, that I was done with her, and I would call her a cab and I would never see her again.&nbsp;</p><p>I looked up at my friend now. She was waiting patiently, smiling slightly. She hadn‚Äôt judged me when I cried about the bird. She had held my hand when she told me about effective charity. Right now her long black hair was falling into her eyes the way it did when it leaned forward. I did not know if the shape of her body was beautiful under her layers but I knew the way she moved was beautiful. I began to get a curious feeling.</p><p><span>Then something horrible came over me. Numbers began floating into my mind. </span><em>Thoughtfulness</em><span>: </span><strong>10</strong><span>. </span><em>Interestingness</em><span>: </span><strong>8.0</strong><span>. </span><em>Beauty</em><span>: </span><strong>8.0</strong><span>.</span></p><p>I stood in terror and she looked surprised.&nbsp;</p><p>‚ÄúWould you be around tonight?‚Äù I asked suddenly. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs something I have to finish. To end. Right now.‚Äù</p><p>Of course, she said. She‚Äôd be around tonight.</p><p>Winter was ending early. I ran through the campus and overheated and had to fold more and more layers to carry under my arms. I almost slipped on the melting and glistening sidewalks but I made it to my girlfriend‚Äôs house out of breath and red in the face.&nbsp;</p><p>It was not how I had imagined it. Her eyebrows rose and she looked me up and down as I panted on her porch.</p><p>‚ÄúI need you to be honest,‚Äù I said. A screen separated us and I knew the same way I was constructing her image separated by the little squares of mesh, she was constructing her judgment of me out of all her tiny stupid spreadsheet cells.</p><p>Before she could reply, I said it: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just your placeholder girlfriend.‚Äù</p><p>Her lips pursed and she couldn‚Äôt look at me anymore. I hadn‚Äôt asked her a question. She looked at the sidewalk and at the porch. She looked anywhere else. Then she slowly came back to me.</p><p>‚ÄúI guess so. I guess you were.‚Äù</p><p>I couldn't reply. I registered that she hadn‚Äôt apologized.</p><p>‚ÄúYou found my sheet, didn‚Äôt you? I saw the ambition edit.‚Äù</p><p><span>Then I remembered way back at the beginning when I‚Äôd changed the </span><em>Ambition</em><span> rating to </span><strong>10</strong><span>. It had been a mistake, one I wouldn‚Äôt make now. I nodded.</span></p><p>She shrugged. ‚ÄúI like being real with myself about where I‚Äôm at. So I do those sheets. I‚Äôm sorry you saw it. But I can tell you‚Äôve been working on things. I‚Äôve admired it. The sex is great. I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôre a placeholder anymore.‚Äù</p><p>I felt several paths in front of me. I almost told her I needed a better apology. I almost told her I had hidden how much I had changed, I was basically a 10 in everything now. I almost told her she had hurt me more than she ever could have imagined.</p><p>This is what I did instead: I told her I was sorry she needed that. Then I kissed her cheek like the moon kisses the sun at the end of an eclipse. Then I left. Then I was gone.&nbsp;</p><p>It was not sweet. It was not the crowning achievement of my winter. It was just done.&nbsp;</p><p>That night I got coffee with my new friend. When her hair fell in front of her eyes, I moved it back. When she asked if everything was okay and I told her it was good now, I could feel the warmth of her happiness radiate across the table. When the date ended, I asked to see her again the next day. We could go to the ceramics museum down the street and I‚Äôd buy her blue china from the gift store where the old ladies slowly wrap and tie in layers and layers of bubble wrap. We could walk through the Annex and pick whichever restaurant was newest. We could go through High Park, through the zoo and meet the reindeer, who make me think of Christmas, and the peacocks, who make me think of the sun.&nbsp;</p><p>We decided to do it all. We were happy. I never thought about revenge again.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<p>Linux gaming performance has been improving for years, but how good is it? <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.computerbase.de/2023-12/welche-linux-distribution-zum-spielen/2/" data-url="https://www.computerbase.de/2023-12/welche-linux-distribution-zum-spielen/2/">ComputerBase benchmarked</a> three different Linux operating systems against <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tag/windows-11" data-auto-tag-linker="true" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomshardware.com/tag/windows-11">Windows 11</a> in several gaming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tag/benchmark" data-auto-tag-linker="true" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomshardware.com/tag/benchmark">benchmarks</a> and found all three were able to outperform <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tag/microsoft" data-auto-tag-linker="true" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomshardware.com/tag/microsoft">Microsoft</a>'s latest OS. On top of this, all three Linux variants were able to accomplish their impressive performance runs while running all benchmarked titles through <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tag/valve" data-auto-tag-linker="true" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomshardware.com/tag/valve">Valve</a>'s Proton compatibility layer.</p><p>The three Linux operating systems ComputerBase benchmarked are Arch Linux, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/pop-os-update-22-04" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/pop-os-update-22-04">Pop!_OS</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/cyberpunk-2077-31-percent-faster-on-amd-in-linux-vs-windows-11" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/cyberpunk-2077-31-percent-faster-on-amd-in-linux-vs-windows-11">Nobara OS</a>. Arch is the most "Linux-like" of the three featuring, a minimalistic default installation that requires user customization to get the most out of it. But at the same time, it also features some of the fastest software and OS updates of any Linux distro. If you didn't know, Valve's SteamOS 3, which powers the Steam Deck, is based on Arch Linux.</p><p>The other two Linux distros tested are far more friendly to Linux beginners, featuring default installations that come with loads of applications and plugins, with several designed for gaming. PoP!_OS is a Ubuntu-based operating system built by System76 that features Steam, Proton, and Lutris right out of the box. Nobara OS is a modified version of Fedora Linux that's designed specifically for gamers, featuring OBS, Wine and third-party Nvidia <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tag/drivers" data-auto-tag-linker="true" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomshardware.com/tag/drivers">drivers</a> (to name a few features) from the get-go.</p><p>ComputerBase's testing was done on an all-AMD test rig, featuring a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/amd-ryzen-7-5800x-zen-3-review" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/amd-ryzen-7-5800x-zen-3-review">Ryzen 7 5800X</a> (non-3D) and a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/amd-radeon-rx-6700-xt-review" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/amd-radeon-rx-6700-xt-review">Radeon RX 6700 XT</a>. Games tested included <em>Cyberpunk 2077, Forspoken, Rachet &amp; Clank, Starfiel</em>d and <em>The Talos Principle II</em>. To reiterate: All of these games are Windows specific, and were run through Valve's Proton compatibility layer on their respective Linux operating systems.</p><p>Computerbase found that all three Linux operating systems were able to beat Windows 11 by a slim margin. Nobara OS took the top spot, achieving 100 fps flat, while Arch Linux and POP!_OS took second and third place, respectively, achieving 99 fps and 95 fps. Windows 11 took the last position, with an average frame rate of 94 fps (1 shy of POP!_OS).&nbsp;</p><p>In the pre-game analysis, the rankings were less consistent, but in three of the games (<em>Cyberpunk 2077, Forespoken and The Talos Principle II)</em> Nobara OS beat the other three contenders, and in <em>Starfield,</em> Arch Linux came out on top. The only game where Windows 11 came in first was <em>Rachet &amp; Clank Rift Apart</em>.</p><p>Similar to the overall results, the frame rate difference between each OS was very small, with most titles having an fps delta of less than eight between the fastest and slowest operating systems. The only exception was <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> which had a substantially larger 17 fps gap between the slowest and fastest OS. Surprisingly, the slowest OS was POP!_OS, which achieved 72.7 fps in that title. Nobara, the highest performing OS, achieved 89.6 &nbsp;in <em>Cyberpunk</em>, while Windows 11 landed third, with an average frame rate of 82.3.</p><div><p>ComputerBase' gaming benchmarks show how good Linux gaming performance has become. Even with the additional overhead of Valve's Proton compatibility layer, these three Linux operating systems still managed to beat or achieve very similar performance to Windows 11's native performance.</p><p>

There's no doubt, then, that Linux is now a highly competitive gaming platform that can play Windows games (thanks to Proton) without sacrificing any serious performance penalties ‚Äì at last on AMD hardware. It would be interesting to see how close to these tests the results would be with a comparable Intel / Nvidia test system.</p></div>

<p>In my day job, I work on a JavaScript framework (<a href="https://lwc.dev/">LWC</a>). And although I‚Äôve been working on it for almost three years, I still feel like a dilettante. When I read about what‚Äôs going on in the larger framework world, I often feel overwhelmed by all the things I don‚Äôt know.</p>
<p>One of the best ways to learn how something works, though, is to build it yourself. And plus, we gotta keep those <a href="https://dayssincelastjavascriptframework.com/">‚Äúdays since last JavaScript framework‚Äù</a> memes going. So let‚Äôs write our own modern JavaScript framework!</p>
<h2>What is a ‚Äúmodern JavaScript framework‚Äù?</h2>
<p>React is a great framework, and I‚Äôm not here to dunk on it. But for the purposes of this post, ‚Äúmodern JavaScript framework‚Äù means ‚Äúa framework from the post-React era‚Äù ‚Äì i.e. <a href="https://lit.dev/">Lit</a>, <a href="https://www.solidjs.com/">Solid</a>, <a href="https://svelte.dev/">Svelte</a>, <a href="https://vuejs.org/">Vue</a>, etc.</p>
<p>React has dominated the frontend landscape for so long that every newer framework has grown up in its shadow. These frameworks were all heavily inspired by React, but they‚Äôve evolved away from it in surprisingly similar ways. And although React itself has continued innovating, I find that the post-React frameworks are more similar to each other than to React nowadays.</p>
<p>To keep things simple, I‚Äôm also going to avoid talking about server-first frameworks like <a href="https://astro.build/">Astro</a>, <a href="https://markojs.com/">Marko</a>, and <a href="https://qwik.builder.io/docs/">Qwik</a>. These frameworks are excellent in their own way, but they come from a slightly different intellectual tradition compared to the client-focused frameworks. So for this post, let‚Äôs only talk about client-side rendering.</p>
<h2>What sets modern frameworks apart?</h2>
<p>From my perspective, the post-React frameworks have all converged on the same foundational ideas:</p>
<ol>
<li>Using reactivity (e.g. <a href="https://dev.to/this-is-learning/the-evolution-of-signals-in-javascript-8ob">signals</a>) for DOM updates.</li>
<li>Using cloned templates for DOM rendering.</li>
<li>Using modern web APIs like <code>&lt;template&gt;</code> and <code>Proxy</code>, which make all of the above easier.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now to be clear, these frameworks differ a lot at the micro level, and in how they handle things like web components, compilation, and user-facing APIs. <a href="https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/issues/2626#issuecomment-489894747">Not all frameworks</a> even use <code>Proxy</code>s. But broadly speaking, most framework authors seem to agree on the above ideas, or they‚Äôre moving in that direction.</p>
<p>So for our own framework, let‚Äôs try to do the bare minimum to implement these ideas, starting with reactivity.</p>
<h2>Reactivity</h2>
<p>It‚Äôs often said that <a href="https://dev.to/this-is-learning/how-react-isn-t-reactive-and-why-you-shouldn-t-care-152m">‚ÄúReact is not reactive‚Äù</a>. What this means is that React has a more pull-based rather than a push-based model. To grossly oversimplify things: React assumes that your entire virtual DOM tree needs to be rebuilt from scratch, and the only way to prevent these updates is to implement <code>useMemo</code> (or in the old days, <code>shouldComponentUpdate</code>).</p>
<p>Using a virtual DOM mitigates some of the cost of the ‚Äúblow everything away and start from scratch‚Äù strategy, but it doesn‚Äôt fully solve it. And asking developers to write the correct memo code is a losing battle. (See <a href="https://react.dev/blog/2023/03/22/react-labs-what-we-have-been-working-on-march-2023">React Forget</a> for an ongoing attempt to solve this.)</p>
<p>Instead, modern frameworks use a push-based reactive model. In this model, individual parts of the component tree subscribe to state updates and only update the DOM when the relevant state changes. This prioritizes a ‚Äúperformant by default‚Äù design in exchange for some upfront bookkeeping cost (especially in terms of memory) to keep track of which parts of the state are tied to which parts of the UI.</p>
<p>Note that this technique is not necessarily incompatible with the virtual DOM approach: tools like <a href="https://preactjs.com/guide/v10/signals/">Preact Signals</a> and <a href="https://million.dev/">Million</a> show that you can have a hybrid system. This is useful if your goal is to keep your existing virtual DOM framework (e.g. React) but to selectively apply the push-based model for more performance-sensitive scenarios.</p>
<p>For this post, I‚Äôm not going to rehash the details of signals themselves, or subtler topics like <a href="https://dev.to/ryansolid/a-hands-on-introduction-to-fine-grained-reactivity-3ndf">fine-grained reactivity</a>, but I am going to assume that we‚Äôll use a reactive system.</p>
<h2>Cloning DOM trees</h2>
<p>For a long time, the collective wisdom in JavaScript frameworks was that the fastest way to render the DOM is to create and mount each DOM node individually. In other words, you use APIs like <code>createElement</code>, <code>setAttribute</code>, and <code>textContent</code> to build the DOM piece-by-piece:</p>
<pre title="">const div = document.createElement('div')
div.setAttribute('class', 'blue')
div.textContent = 'Blue!'
</pre>
<p>One alternative is to just shove a big ol‚Äô HTML string into <code>innerHTML</code> and let the browser parse it for you:</p>
<pre title="">const container = document.createElement('div')
container.innerHTML = `
  &lt;div class="blue"&gt;Blue!&lt;/div&gt;
`
</pre>
<p>This na√Øve approach has a big downside: if there is any dynamic content in your HTML (for instance, <code>red</code> instead of <code>blue</code>), then you would need to parse HTML strings over and over again. Plus, you are blowing away the DOM with every update, which would reset state such as the <code>value</code> of <code>&lt;input&gt;</code>s.</p>

<p>At some point, though, folks figured out that parsing the HTML <em>once</em> and then calling <code>cloneNode(true)</code> on the whole thing is pretty danged fast:</p>
<pre title="">const template = document.createElement('template')
template.innerHTML = `
  &lt;div class="blue"&gt;Blue!&lt;/div&gt;
`
template.content.cloneNode(true) // this is fast!
</pre>
<p>Here I‚Äôm using a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/template"><code>&lt;template&gt;</code></a> tag, which has the advantage of creating ‚Äúinert‚Äù DOM. In other words, things like <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;video autoplay&gt;</code> don‚Äôt automatically start downloading anything.</p>
<p>How fast is this compared to manual DOM APIs? To demonstrate, here‚Äôs <a href="https://github.com/nolanlawson/template-clone-demo">a small benchmark</a>. <a href="https://github.com/google/tachometer">Tachometer</a> reports that the cloning technique is about 50% faster in Chrome, 15% faster in Firefox, and 10% faster in Safari. (This will vary based on DOM size and number of iterations, but you get the gist.)</p>
<p>What‚Äôs interesting  is that <code>&lt;template&gt;</code> is a new-ish browser API, not available in IE11, and originally designed for web components. Somewhat ironically, this technique is now used in a variety of JavaScript frameworks, regardless of whether they use web components or not.</p>

<p>There is one major challenge with this technique, which is how to efficiently update dynamic content without blowing away DOM state. We‚Äôll cover this later when we build our toy framework.</p>
<h2>Modern JavaScript APIs</h2>
<p>We‚Äôve already encountered one new API that helps a lot, which is <code>&lt;template&gt;</code>. Another one that‚Äôs steadily gaining traction is <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Proxy"><code>Proxy</code></a>, which can make building reactivity system much simpler.</p>
<p>When we build our toy example, we‚Äôll also use <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals#tagged_templates">tagged template literals</a> to create an API like this:</p>
<pre title="">const dom = html`
  &lt;div&gt;Hello ${ name }!&lt;/div&gt;
`
</pre>
<p>Not all frameworks use this tool, but notable ones include Lit, <a href="https://viperhtml.js.org/hyper.html">HyperHTML</a>, and <a href="https://www.arrow-js.com/">ArrowJS</a>. Tagged template literals can make it much simpler to build ergonomic HTML templating APIs without needing a compiler.</p>
<h2>Step 1: building reactivity</h2>
<p>Reactivity is the foundation upon which we'll build the rest of the framework. Reactivity will define how state is managed, and how the DOM updates when state changes.</p>
<p>Let's start with some <a href="https://nobackend.org/2013/05/welcome-to-noBackend.html">"dream code"</a> to illustrate what we want:</p>
<pre title="">const state = {}

state.a = 1
state.b = 2

createEffect(() =&gt; {
  state.sum = state.a + state.b
})
</pre>
<p>Basically, we want a ‚Äúmagic object‚Äù called <code>state</code>, with two props: <code>a</code> and <code>b</code>. And whenever those props change, we want to set <code>sum</code> to be the sum of the two.</p>
<p>Assuming we don‚Äôt know the props in advance (or have a compiler to determine them), a plain object will not suffice for this. So let‚Äôs use a <code>Proxy</code>, which can react whenever a new value is set:</p>
<pre title="">const state = new Proxy({}, {
  get(obj, prop) {
    onGet(prop)
    return obj[prop]
  },
  set(obj, prop, value) {
    obj[prop] = value
    onSet(prop, value)
    return true
  }
})
</pre>
<p>Right now, our <code>Proxy</code> doesn‚Äôt do anything interesting, except give us some <code>onGet</code> and <code>onSet</code> hooks. So let‚Äôs make it flush updates after a microtask:</p>
<pre title="">let queued = false

function onSet(prop, value) {
  if (!queued) {
    queued = true
    queueMicrotask(() =&gt; {
      queued = false
      flush()
    })
  }
}
</pre>

<p>Why flush updates? Mostly because we don‚Äôt want to run too many computations. If we update whenever both <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> change, then we‚Äôll uselessly compute the <code>sum</code> twice. By coalescing the flush into a single microtask, we can be much more efficient.</p>
<p>Next, let‚Äôs make <code>flush</code> update the sum:</p>
<pre title="">function flush() {
  state.sum = state.a + state.b
}
</pre>
<p>This is great, but it‚Äôs not yet our ‚Äúdream code.‚Äù We‚Äôll need to implement <code>createEffect</code> so that the <code>sum</code> is computed only when <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> change (and not when something else changes!).</p>
<p>To do this, let‚Äôs use an object to keep track of which effects need to be run for which props:</p>
<pre title="">const propsToEffects = {}
</pre>
<p>Next comes the crucial part! We need to make sure that our effects can <em>subscribe</em> to the right props. To do so, we‚Äôll run the effect, note any <code>get</code> calls it makes, and create a mapping between the prop and the effect.</p>
<p>To break it down, remember our ‚Äúdream code‚Äù is:</p>
<pre title="">createEffect(() =&gt; {
  state.sum = state.a + state.b
})
</pre>
<p>When this function runs, it calls two getters: <code>state.a</code> and <code>state.b</code>. These getters should trigger the reactive system to notice that the function relies on the two props.</p>
<p>To make this happen, we‚Äôll start with a simple global to keep track of what the ‚Äúcurrent‚Äù effect is:</p>
<pre title="">let currentEffect
</pre>
<p>Then, the <code>createEffect</code> function will set this global before calling the function:</p>
<pre title="">function createEffect(effect) {
  currentEffect = effect
  effect()
  currentEffect = undefined
}
</pre>
<p>The important thing here is that the effect is <em>immediately</em> invoked, with the <code>currentEffect</code> being set globally in advance. This is how we can track whatever getters the effect might be calling.</p>
<p>Now, we can implement the <code>onGet</code> in our <code>Proxy</code>, which will set up the mapping between the global <code>currentEffect</code> and the property:</p>
<pre title="">function onGet(prop) {
  const effects = propsToEffects[prop] ?? 
      (propsToEffects[prop] = [])
  effects.push(currentEffect)
}
</pre>
<p>After this runs once, <code>propsToEffects</code> should look like this:</p>
<pre title="">{
  "a": [theEffect],
  "b": [theEffect]
}
</pre>
<p>‚Ä¶where <code>theEffect</code> is the ‚Äúsum‚Äù function we want to run.</p>
<p>Next, our <code>onSet</code> should add any effects that need to be run to a <code>dirtyEffects</code> array:</p>
<pre title="">const dirtyEffects = []

function onSet(prop, value) {
  if (propsToEffects[prop]) {
    dirtyEffects.push(...propsToEffects[prop])
    // ...
  }
}
</pre>
<p>At this point, we have all the pieces in place for <code>flush</code> to call all the <code>dirtyEffects</code>:</p>
<pre title="">function flush() {
  while (dirtyEffects.length) {
    dirtyEffects.shift()()
  }
}
</pre>
<p>Putting it all together, we now have a fully functional reactivity system! You can play around with it yourself and try setting <code>state.a</code> and <code>state.b</code> in the DevTools console ‚Äì the <code>state.sum</code> will update whenever either one changes.</p>

<p>Now, there are plenty of advanced cases that we‚Äôre <em>not</em> covering here:</p>
<ol>
<li>Using <code>try</code>/<code>catch</code> in case an effect throws an error</li>
<li>Avoiding running the same effect twice</li>
<li>Preventing infinite cycles</li>
<li>Subscribing effects to new props on subsequent runs (e.g. if certain getters are only called in an <code>if</code> block)</li>
</ol>
<p>However, this is more than enough for our toy example. Let‚Äôs move on to DOM rendering.</p>
<h2>Step 2: DOM rendering</h2>
<p>We now have a functional reactivity system, but it‚Äôs essentially ‚Äúheadless.‚Äù It can track changes and compute effects, but that‚Äôs about it.</p>
<p>At some point, though, our JavaScript framework needs to actually render some DOM to the screen. (That‚Äôs kind of the whole point.)</p>
<p>For this section, let‚Äôs forget about reactivity for a moment and imagine we‚Äôre just trying to build a function that can 1) build a DOM tree, and 2) update it efficiently.</p>
<p>Once again, let‚Äôs start off with some dream code:</p>
<pre title="">function render(state) {
  return html`
    &lt;div class="${state.color}"&gt;${state.text}&lt;/div&gt;
  `
}
</pre>
<p>As I mentioned, I‚Äôm using tagged template literals, ala Lit, because I found them to be a nice way to write HTML templates without needing a compiler. (We‚Äôll see in a moment why we might actually <em>want</em> a compiler instead.)</p>
<p>We‚Äôre re-using our <code>state</code> object from before, this time with a <code>color</code> and <code>text</code> property. Maybe the state is something like:</p>
<pre title="">state.color = 'blue'
state.text = 'Blue!'
</pre>
<p>When we pass this <code>state</code> into <code>render</code>, it should return the DOM tree with the state applied:</p>
<pre title="">&lt;div class="blue"&gt;Blue!&lt;/div&gt;
</pre>
<p>Before we go any further, though, we need a quick primer on tagged template literals. Our <code>html</code> tag is just a function that receives two arguments: the <code>tokens</code> (array of static HTML strings) and <code>expressions</code> (the evaluated dynamic expressions):</p>
<pre title="">function html(tokens, ...expressions) {
}
</pre>
<p>In this case, the <code>tokens</code> are (whitespace removed):</p>
<pre title="">[
  "&lt;div class=\"",
  "\"&gt;",
  "&lt;/div&gt;"
]
</pre>
<p>And the <code>expressions</code> are:</p>
<pre title="">[
  "blue",
  "Blue!"
]
</pre>
<p>The <code>tokens</code> array will always be exactly 1 longer than the <code>expressions</code> array, so we can trivially zip them up together:</p>
<pre title="">const allTokens = tokens
    .map((token, i) =&gt; (expressions[i - 1] ?? '') + token)
</pre>
<p>This will give us an array of strings:</p>
<pre title="">[
  "&lt;div class=\"",
  "blue",
  "\"&gt;",
  "Blue!",
  "&lt;/div&gt;"
]
</pre>
<p>We can join these strings together to make our HTML:</p>
<pre title="">const htmlString = allTokens.join('')
</pre>
<p>And then we can use <code>innerHTML</code> to parse it into a <code>&lt;template&gt;</code>:</p>
<pre title="">function parseTemplate(htmlString) {
  const template = document.createElement('template')
  template.innerHTML = htmlString
  return template
}
</pre>
<p>This template contains our inert DOM (technically a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/DocumentFragment"><code>DocumentFragment</code></a>), which we can clone at will:</p>
<pre title="">const cloned = template.content.cloneNode(true)
</pre>
<p>Of course, parsing the full HTML whenever the <code>html</code> function is called would not be great for performance. Luckily, tagged template literals have a built-in feature that will help out a lot here.</p>
<p>For every unique usage of a tagged template literal, the <code>tokens</code> array is <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals#tagged_templates">always the same</a> whenever the function is called ‚Äì in fact, it‚Äôs the exact same object!</p>
<p>For example, consider this case:</p>
<pre title="">function sayHello(name) {
  return html`&lt;div&gt;Hello ${name}&lt;/div&gt;`
}
</pre>
<p>Whenever <code>sayHello</code> is called, the <code>tokens</code> array will always be identical:</p>
<pre title="">[
  "&lt;div&gt;Hello ",
  "&lt;/div&gt;"
]
</pre>
<p>The only time <code>tokens</code> will be different is for completely different locations of the tagged template:</p>
<pre title="">html`&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;`
html`&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;` // Different from above
</pre>
<p>We can use this to our advantage by using a <code>WeakMap</code> to keep a mapping of the <code>tokens</code> array to the resulting <code>template</code>:</p>
<pre title="">const tokensToTemplate = new WeakMap()

function html(tokens, ...expressions) {
  let template = tokensToTemplate.get(tokens)
  if (!template) {
    // ...
    template = parseTemplate(htmlString)
    tokensToTemplate.set(tokens, template)
  }
  return template
}
</pre>
<p>This is kind of a mind-blowing concept, but the uniqueness of the <code>tokens</code> array essentially means that we can ensure that each call to <code>html`...`</code> only parses the HTML once.</p>
<p>Next, we just need a way to update the cloned DOM node with the <code>expressions</code> array (which is likely to be different every time, unlike <code>tokens</code>).</p>
<p>To keep things simple, let‚Äôs just replace the <code>expressions</code> array with a placeholder for each index:</p>
<pre title="">const stubs = expressions.map((_, i) =&gt; `__stub-${i}__`)
</pre>
<p>If we zip this up like before, it will create this HTML:</p>
<pre title="">&lt;div class="__stub-0__"&gt;
  __stub-1__
&lt;/div&gt;
</pre>
<p>We can write a simple string replacement function to replace the stubs:</p>
<pre title="">function replaceStubs (string) {
  return string.replaceAll(/__stub-(\d+)__/g, (_, i) =&gt; (
    expressions[i]
  ))
}
</pre>
<p>And now whenever the <code>html</code> function is called, we can clone the template and update the placeholders:</p>
<pre title="">const element = cloned.firstElementChild
for (const { name, value } of element.attributes) {
  element.setAttribute(name, replaceStubs(value))
}
element.textContent = replaceStubs(element.textContent)
</pre>

<p>Now, this is still not terribly efficient ‚Äì notably, we are updating <code>textContent</code> and attributes that don‚Äôt necessarily need to be updated. But for our toy framework, this is good enough.</p>
<p>We can test it out by rendering with different <code>state</code>:</p>
<pre title="">document.body.appendChild(render({ color: 'blue', text: 'Blue!' }))
document.body.appendChild(render({ color: 'red', text: 'Red!' }))
</pre>
<p>This works!</p>

<h2>Step 3: combining reactivity and DOM rendering</h2>
<p>Since we already have a <code>createEffect</code> from the rendering system above, we can now combine the two to update the DOM based on the state:</p>
<pre title="">const container = document.getElementById('container')

createEffect(() =&gt; {
  const dom = render(state)
  if (container.firstElementChild) {
    container.firstElementChild.replaceWith(dom)
  } else {
    container.appendChild(dom)
  }
})
</pre>
<p>This actually works! We can combine this with the ‚Äúsum‚Äù example from the reactivity section by merely creating another effect to set the <code>text</code>:</p>
<pre title="">createEffect(() =&gt; {
  state.text = `Sum is: ${state.sum}`
})
</pre>
<p>This renders ‚ÄúSum is 3‚Äù:</p>

<p>You can play around with this toy example. If you set <code>state.a = 5</code>, then the text will automatically update to say ‚ÄúSum is 7.‚Äù</p>
<h2>Next steps</h2>
<p>There are lots of improvements we could make to this system, especially the DOM rendering bit.</p>
<p>Most notably, we are missing a way to update content for elements inside a deep DOM tree, e.g.:</p>
<pre title="">&lt;div class="${color}"&gt;
  &lt;span&gt;${text}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</pre>
<p>For this, we would need a way to uniquely identify every element inside of the template. There are lots of ways to do this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Lit, when parsing HTML, uses a system of <a href="https://github.com/lit/lit/blob/1af7991c27456c7e6073a3ee6f18f102c2adc026/packages/lit-html/src/lit-html.ts#L779-L857">regexes and character matching</a> to determine whether a placeholder is within an attribute or text content, plus the index of the target element (in depth-first <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/TreeWalker"><code>TreeWalker</code></a> order).</li>
<li>Frameworks like Svelte and Solid have the luxury of parsing the entire HTML template during compilation, which provides the same information. They also generate code that calls <code>firstChild</code> and <code>nextSibling</code> to traverse the DOM to find the element to update.</li>
</ol>

<p>Whether we decided to do Lit-style client-side parsing or Svelte/Solid-style compile-time parsing, what we want is some kind of mapping like this:</p>
<pre title="">[
  {
    elementIndex: 0, // &lt;div&gt; above
    attributeName: 'class',
    stubIndex: 0 // index in expressions array
  },
  {
    elementIndex: 1 // &lt;span&gt; above
    textContent: true,
    stubIndex: 1 // index in expressions array
  }
]
</pre>
<p>These bindings would tell us exactly which elements need to be updated, which attribute (or <code>textContent</code>) needs to be set, and where to find the <code>expression</code> to replace the stub.</p>
<p>The next step would be to avoid cloning the template every time, and to just directly update the DOM based on the <code>expressions</code>. In other words, we not only want to parse once ‚Äì we want to only clone and set up the bindings once. This would reduce each subsequent update to the bare minimum of <code>setAttribute</code> and <code>textContent</code> calls.</p>

<p>Another interesting pattern to implement would be iterations (or repeaters), which come with their own set of challenges, like reconciling lists between updates and handling ‚Äúkeys‚Äù for efficient replacement.</p>
<p>I‚Äôm tired, though, and this blog post has gone on long enough. So I leave the rest as an exercise to the reader!</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>So there you have it. In the span of one (lengthy) blog post, we‚Äôve implemented our very own JavaScript framework. Feel free to use this as the foundation for your brand-new JavaScript framework, to release to the world and enrage the Hacker News crowd.</p>
<p>Personally I found this project very educational, which is partly why I did it in the first place. I was also looking to replace the current framework for <a href="https://github.com/nolanlawson/emoji-picker-element/">my emoji picker component</a> with a smaller, more custom-built solution. In the process, I managed to write <a href="https://github.com/nolanlawson/emoji-picker-element/pull/381">a tiny framework</a> that passes all the existing tests and is ~6kB smaller than the current implementation, which I‚Äôm pretty proud of.</p>
<p>In the future, I think it would be neat if browser APIs were full-featured enough to make it even easier to build a custom framework. For example, the <a href="https://github.com/WICG/webcomponents/blob/gh-pages/proposals/DOM-Parts.md">DOM Part API proposal</a> would take out a lot of the drudgery of the DOM parsing-and-replacement system we built above, while also opening the door to potential browser performance optimizations. I could also imagine (with some wild gesticulation) that an extension to <code>Proxy</code> could make it easier to build a full reactivity system without worrying about details like flushing, batching, or cycle detection.</p>
<p>If all those things were in place, then you could imagine effectively having a ‚ÄúLit in the browser,‚Äù or at least a way to quickly build your own ‚ÄúLit in the browser.‚Äù In the meantime, I hope that this small exercise helped to illustrate some of the things framework authors think about, and some of the machinery under the hood of your favorite JavaScript framework.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
								
																	
																
								<p>In his later life, my father-in-law routinely woke up for the day at 3 a.m. He'd become such an early bird that he morphed into a night owl, a man resigned to a post-retirement inability to clock in more than four or five hours of rest. I can recall taking his routines as a grim prophecy. And when a few years later I found myself struggling with brutal bouts of insomnia, I wondered if, along with laugh lines and macular degeneration, sleeplessness was an inevitable part of growing older for me, too.</p>

<p>There is a persistent folk wisdom that older people simply don't need as much sleep ‚Äî an idea likely borne out of the idea that as our lifestyles ostensibly become less active, our requirements for the reparative benefits of rest diminish. As recently as 2008, a report in <a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/07/080724123255.htm" target="_blank">Current Biology</a> found that in one experiment, older subjects got 1.5 hours less sleep on average than their younger counterparts. "The most parsimonious explanation for our results," researcher Elizabeth Klerman of Brigham and Women's Hospital &amp; Harvard Medical School said at the time, "is that older people need less sleep."</p>

<p>But what we <em>need</em> and what we actually <em>get </em>are two entirely different entities ‚Äî and we are in the midst of a sleep shortage that's affecting Americans across all generational lines. The CDC notes that "<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/sleep/index.html#:~:text=A%20third%20of%20US%20adults,that%20threaten%20our%20nation's%20health." target="_blank">A third of US adults report that they usually get less than the recommended amount of sleep</a>." It's <a href="https://www.salon.com/2023/11/11/sleep-the-bedrock-of-public-health-is-eroding-this-is-how-experts-say-we-can-fix-it/" target="_blank">a crisis that can wreak havoc</a> on our physical and mental health, with sleep deprivation contributing to obesity, hypertension, diabetes, depression and stroke. And even accounting for fluctuations among different age populations, <a href="https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/sleep/how-much-sleep" target="_blank">most adults need between 7 and 9 hours of sleep per night</a>. The key is just staying in a healthy range.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"A third of US adults report that they usually get less than the recommended amount of sleep."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.columbiapsychiatry.org/research-labs/sultan-lab-mental-health-informatics" target="_blank">Dr. Ryan Sultan</a>, a board-certified psychiatrist, therapist, researcher and professor at Columbia University, says that "As we age, the amount of sleep needed tends to decrease. Older adults may be well-rested and alert after 6 to 7 hours."</p>
<p>My late father-in-law may not have had much steam in him after dinnertime, but his days were as active and engaged as his solitary predawn hours. Sultan says it's just about paying attention to overall health patterns and any changes that feel off. "In my clinical experience," he says, "I have observed that older adults often face unique challenges, such as medical conditions or medications affecting sleep. Addressing these factors with a healthcare professional is crucial for developing a tailored approach to sleep improvement."</p>
<p>As Sultan puts it, "The concept of normal sleep does change as we age, and recognizing these shifts is essential for maintaining optimal health."</p>
<p>"Generally speaking, sleep ability declines as we age as the mechanisms that control sleep become less robust over time."</p>
<p>The real culprit to watch out for as we age isn't the amount of sleep, but quality of it. Older people have unique vulnerabilities around getting a deep, steady rest. A 2017 analysis in the journal <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5841578/" target="_blank">Sleep Medicine Clinics</a> explained how so-called "sleep architecture" can change with age, including "advanced sleep timing, shortened nocturnal sleep duration, increased frequency of daytime naps, increased number of nocturnal awakenings and time spent awake during the night, decreased slow wave sleep, and other changes."</p>
<p>Auckland sleep psychologist <a href="https://thebettersleepclinic.com/dan-ford-sleep-psychologist%C2%A0" target="_blank">Dan Ford, clinical director of the Better Sleep Clinic</a>, puts it simply, "Generally speaking, sleep ability declines as we age as the mechanisms that control sleep become less robust over time." But nothing is set in stone. He adds, "Healthy older adults do not necessarily show these changes in their sleep parameters."</p>
<p>Why do those gorgeous, lengthy sleeps of our younger years become so elusive as we age? There are a whole litany of reasons. <a href="https://www.salon.com/2022/11/13/dont-fear-the-hot-flash-menopause-isnt-a-disease-but-it-is-a-health-issue-we-need-to-talk-about/" target="_blank">There's menopause</a>, with its discomforts and night sweats. Bathroom issues can likewise keep a person of any gender up and down all night long. Changes in the urinary tract, along with other factors like bladder obstruction, make nocturia (frequent nighttime urination) <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10641954/#:~:text=In%20addition%2C%20aging%20is%20associated,nocturia%20as%20a%20prominent%20symptom." target="_blank">far more common </a>in adults over the age of 60.</p>
<p>There are other physical factors as well ‚Äî the National Council on Aging estimates that "<a href="https://www.ncoa.org/article/sleep-apnea-in-older-adults-diagnosis-and-treatment-options" target="_blank">56% of people</a> age 65 and older have a high risk of developing obstructive sleep apnea." Our <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5272178/" target="_blank">circadian rhythms also change as we age</a>, edging us to what can make us feel like we're living in a different time zone from our family and friends. And then there are the mental health issues. Grief, loneliness, financial loss and other stressors can wreck a good night's rest, and the symptoms of <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/aging/depression/index.html#:~:text=How%20Many%20Older%20Adults%20are,11.5%25%20in%20older%20hospitalized%20patients." target="_blank">depression and anxiety often go undiagnosed</a>. A 2018 study on insomnia in the Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine found that "<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5991956/" target="_blank">As many as 50% of older adults complain about difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep</a>."</p>

<p>So if you're noticing that your nights now typically involve periods of wakefulness, is playing a little catch up when possible during the day a good idea?</p>
<p>"Napping can be a helpful strategy for older adults," says Dr. Ryan Sultan, "but the timing and duration matter. Short naps of around 20 to 30 minutes can boost alertness without interfering with nighttime sleep. However, extended or late-afternoon naps might disrupt the sleep-wake cycle, making it harder to fall asleep at night." Mileage can vary even there, though ‚Äî I have a friend in his late 50s who regularly konks out before making dinner. He calls it a "nappetizer."</p>
<p>For those who have a hard time resisting longer naps, <a href="https://www.emotionstherapycalgary.ca/psychologist-calgary-rod-mitchell" target="_blank">Rod Mitchell</a>, a Calgary psychologist with expertise in cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia, recommends offsetting grogginess with a "coffee nap." He says, "Combine a small, controlled intake of caffeine (such as a half cup of coffee) followed by a short, 20-minute nap. This method can enhance the restorative effect of napping, with the caffeine kicking in just as you wake up, potentially offering a more refreshing experience."&nbsp;</p>
<p>However many candles may be on your own next birthday cake, we all need to prioritize adequate rest. We know that building healthy routines like regular bedtimes, avoiding too much caffeine and late-night doomscrolling or binge-watching and getting adequate physical activity are the best bet for a better night ‚Äî even if it's all easier said than done. Our culture typically regards aging as a failure and sleep as for the weak. But the plain fact is that our bodies change over time. That doesn't mean that once you hit your AARP era,&nbsp; you suddenly can function just fine on 5 hours of sack time. Instead, if you want to feel younger, you just might actually need to sleep more.</p>

            <span>Abstract:</span>Modern deductive database engines (e.g., LogicBlox and Souffl√©) enable their users to write declarative queries which compute recursive deductions over extensional data, leaving their high-performance operationalization (query planning, semi-na√Øve evaluation, and parallelization) to the engine. Such engines form the backbone of modern high-throughput applications in static analysis, security auditing, social-media mining, and business analytics. State-of-the-art engines are built upon nested loop joins over explicit representations (e.g., BTrees and tries) and ubiquitously employ range indexing to accelerate iterated joins. In this work, we present GDlog: a GPU-based deductive analytics engine (implemented as a CUDA library) which achieves significant performance improvements (5--10x or more) versus prior systems. GDlog is powered by a novel range-indexed SIMD datastructure: the hash-indexed sorted array (HISA). We perform extensive evaluation on GDlog, comparing it against both CPU and GPU-based hash tables and Datalog engines, and using it to support a range of large-scale deductive queries including reachability, same generation, and context-sensitive program analysis. Our experiments show that GDlog achieves performance competitive with modern SIMD hash tables and beats prior work by an order of magnitude in runtime while offering more favorable memory footprint.

    <p><img src="https://wildergardenaudio.com/maim/static/images/MaimGUI.png" alt="screenshot of MAIM GUI"></p><div>
            <p>MAIM is the plugin for you if you want the sound of MP3 compression. With heavily hacked real MP3
                encoders at its core, MAIM gives you the full gamut of digital distortion, from the realistic to the
                fantastical. Explore the bubbles and crunches of this unique form of digital distortion.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>MAIM features two real MP3 encoders, captured in the wild and painstakingly incorporated into a
                    real-time plugin.
                </li>
                <li>We've woven mad-science circuit bending into MAIM's MP3 encoders, to give you fine control over a
                    whole
                    palette of spectral distortions and face-melting glitches.
                </li>
                <li>All knobs can be smoothly dragged and automated, without pops or gaps in the sound.</li>
                <li>MAIM works across DAWs, on Mac (AU/VST3), Windows (VST3), and even Linux (VST3).</li>
                <li>MAIM is, and will always be, 100% free and open-source. If you are so inclined,

            </ul>

                Maim took a long time to make. If you enjoy MAIM and want to see more plugins like it in the future,

        <h2>Meet the Encoders</h2>
        <p>
            Why does MAIM have two MP3 encoders? An MP3 is an MP3, right? Not quite.
            Audio compression is as much an art as a science, and each encoder gives the track a slightly different
            tone.
