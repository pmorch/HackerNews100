<p>I love work.  I love working late nights, hacking on things.  This week I
didn‚Äôt go to sleep before midnight once.  And yet‚Ä¶</p>
<p>I also love my wife and kids. I love long walks, contemplating life over good
coffee, and deep, meaningful conversations.  None of this would be possible if
my life was defined by 12 hour days, six days a week.  More importantly, a
successful company is not a sprint, it‚Äôs a marathon.</p>
<p>And this is when this is your own company!  When you devote 72 hours a week to
someone else‚Äôs startup, you need to really think about that arrangement a few
times.  I find it highly irresponsible for a founder to promote that model.  As
a founder, you are not an employee, and your risks and leverage are
fundamentally different.</p>
<p>I will always advocate <a href="https://lucumr.pocoo.org/2024/12/26/reflecting-on-life/">for putting the time
in</a> because it is what brought me happiness.
Intensity, and giving a shit about what I‚Äôm doing, will always matter to me.
But you don‚Äôt measure that by the energy you put in, or the hours you‚Äôre
sitting in the office, but the output you produce.  Burning out on twelve-hour
days, six days a week, has no prize at the end.  It‚Äôs unsustainable, it
shouldn‚Äôt be the standard and it sure as hell should not be seen as a positive
sign of a company.</p>
<p>I‚Äôve pulled many all-nighters, and I‚Äôve enjoyed them.  I still do.  But they‚Äôre
enjoyable in the right context, for the right reasons, and when that is a
completely personal choice, not the basis of company culture.</p>
<p>And that all-nighter?  It comes with a fucked up and unproductive morning the
day after.</p>
<p>When someone promotes a 996 work culture, we should push back.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
            <div>
                <h2>The Setup</h2>
<p>Picture this: Restaurant Brands International (RBI) ‚Äì the corporate overlords behind <strong>Burger King</strong>, <strong>Tim Hortons</strong>, and <strong>Popeyes</strong> ‚Äì control over <strong>30,000 locations worldwide</strong>. That's a lot of chicken sandwiches, maple syrup, and flame-broiled beef.</p>
<p>What they also control is something called the "assistant" platform ‚Äì the digital brain behind every drive-thru screen, bathroom tablet review, and the slightly-too-cheerful burger king employee asking if you want to make it a combo.</p>
<p>Spoiler alert: Their security was about as solid as a paper Whopper wrapper in the rain.</p>
<p>We stumbled upon vulnerabilities so catastrophic that we could access <strong>every single store</strong> in their global empire. From a Burger King in Times Square to that lonely Tim Hortons where Bugs Bunny shoulda taken a left turn at Albuquerque. Oh, and did we mention we could listen to your actual drive-thru conversations? Yeah, that happened too.</p>
<p>The platforms were spread across three domains, each with the same delicious vulnerabilities:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>https://assistant.bk.com</code></li>
<li><code>https://assistant.popeyes.com</code>  </li>
<li><code>https://assistant.timhortons.com</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Buckle up, this is going to be a wild ride. üçî</p>
<h2>The Vulnerabilities</h2>
<h3>The "Anyone Can Join This Party" Signup API</h3>
<p>Our journey began innocently enough. We tried logging in with fake credentials and discovered they were using AWS Cognito. The good news? The system worked exactly as designed. The bad news? They forgot to disable user signups. Oops.</p>
<p>After a quick email verification dance with AWS's <code>ConfirmSignup</code> method, we were in. But wait, there's more!</p>
<p>Using GraphQL introspection (because who doesn't love a good schema leak), we found an even easier signup endpoint that completely bypassed email verification. It was like finding a secret menu item, except this one came with user privileges.</p>
<pre><code>mutation SignUp {
  signUp(input: { email: "<a href="https://bobdahacker.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="0f6b6a696661667b6a63762261607b226e22676e6c646a7d4f6a776e627f636a216c6062">[email&nbsp;protected]</a>", password: "password123" })
}
</code></pre>
<p>The cherry on top? <strong>They emailed us the password in plain text.</strong> In 2025. We're not even mad, just impressed by the commitment to terrible security practices.</p>
<p><img src="https://bobdahacker.com/static/images/blogs/rbi/Passwordemail.png" alt="Password sent in email"><br><em>When your password security is more outdated than the ice cream machine</em></p>
<hr>
<h3>"Gotta Catch 'Em All" - The Global Store Directory</h3>
<p>Once authenticated, we hit the jackpot: a single GraphQL endpoint that returned <strong>a store in their global empire</strong>. (the store ids were incrementing) Not just the store name, but the good stuff ‚Äì store employees personal information, internal IDs, configuration details.</p>
<p><img src="https://bobdahacker.com/static/images/blogs/rbi/Allthestores.png" alt="All the stores.png"><br><img src="https://bobdahacker.com/static/images/blogs/rbi/getStore2.png" alt="All the stores.png"></p>
<p>But wait, there's more! We also found a GraphQL query to search users who have access to assistant by name, revealing personal info faster than you can say "would you like fries with that data breach?"</p>
<hr>
<h3>The "No Authentication, No Problem" Token Generator</h3>
<p>Here's where things got spicy. We discovered a GraphQL mutation called <code>createToken</code> that was about as secure as leaving your house key under a welcome mat labeled "HOUSE KEY HERE."</p>
<p>This beautiful piece of mutation accepted a <code>storeId</code> parameter and required <strong>absolutely zero authentication</strong>. None. Nada. Zilch.</p>
<pre><code>mutation CreateToken {
  createToken(input: { storeId: "1" })
}
</code></pre>
<p><img src="https://bobdahacker.com/static/images/blogs/rbi/CreateToken2.png" alt="CreateToken"><br><em>Authentication is optional, apparently</em></p>
<p>This token wasn't just a key to one store ‚Äì it was the master key to the entire kingdom. With it, we could promote ourselves to admin status across the entire platform:</p>
<pre><code>mutation BecomeTheKing {
  updateUser(input: { id: "definitely-us", roles: "admin" }) {
    roles  # Spoiler: it's "admin" now
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p><img src="https://bobdahacker.com/static/images/blogs/rbi/WeAreAdmin.png" alt="We Are Admin"><br><em>Look at us. We're the captain now.</em></p>
<h3>The Drive-Thru Equipment Store (A Detour Into Absurdity)</h3>
<p>While exploring, we stumbled upon RBI's equipment ordering website. The password protection? <strong>Client-side only.</strong> The password? <strong>Hardcoded in da HTML.</strong> </p>
<p><img src="https://bobdahacker.com/static/images/blogs/rbi/hardCodedPassword.png" alt="Hard Coded Password"><br><em>Security through obscurity, but the obscurity is in plain sight</em></p>
<p>Here you could order drive-thru essentials like "Single Lane Kits" (tablets included!) or just grab a tablet for those bathroom feedback screens because apparently everything needs to be digital now.</p>
<p><img src="https://bobdahacker.com/static/images/blogs/rbi/singleLaneKit.png" alt="Single Lane Kit"><br><em>Your complete drive-thru starter pack, no security included</em></p>
<hr>
<h3>Welcome to the Drive-Thru Control Room</h3>
<p>The tokens unlocked access to the actual tablet interfaces used in stores. The tablet is primarly composed of what seems to be a web app.</p>
<p><strong>Main Screen</strong> (<code>https://assistant.bk.com/screens/main?authToken=yourNewBestFriend</code>)</p>
<ul>
<li>Lists previous conversations (spoiler: you can listen to them)</li>
<li>Shows the "tone" employees should focus on</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://bobdahacker.com/static/images/blogs/rbi/Screensystem.png" alt="Screen System"></p>
<p><strong>Diagnostic Screen</strong> (<code>https://assistant.bk.com/screens/diagnostic?authToken=stillYourBestFriend</code>)<br>This one had an additional password protection. The password? <strong>"admin"</strong>. Client-side, of course.</p>
<p><img src="https://bobdahacker.com/static/images/blogs/rbi/DiagnosticScreenPasswordProtected.png" alt="Diagnostic Screen Password Protected"><br><em>Advanced password security, circa 1995</em></p>
<p><img src="https://bobdahacker.com/static/images/blogs/rbi/AdvancedPasswordSecurity.png" alt="Advanced Password Security"><br><em>When your password security is more predictable than McDonald's ice cream machines being broken</em></p>
<p>Once inside, we found APIs to control drive-thru audio levels. Want to blast customers' eardrums or make them whisper their order? We got you covered:</p>
<p><img src="https://bobdahacker.com/static/images/blogs/rbi/EarBlast.png" alt="Ear Gain"></p>
<p>Any store token could also list any store's drive-thru config, because apparently access control is just a suggestion.</p>
<p><img src="https://bobdahacker.com/static/images/blogs/rbi/GPIOStrings.png" alt="GPIOStrings.png"></p>
<p>Notice something? Well it returns a JWT that can be used to call an API to return a signed AWS upload url, for any store's path, which is bad. Very bad. </p>
<p>First it was kind enough to reveal the missing values:</p>
<p><img src="https://bobdahacker.com/static/images/blogs/rbi/FileUploadApi.png" alt="FileUploadApi.png"></p>
<p>Then it returned with the signed upload URL for "amongus.mp4":</p>
<p><img src="https://bobdahacker.com/static/images/blogs/rbi/sus.png" alt="sus.png"></p>
<hr>
<h3>The Drive-Thru Surveillance State</h3>
<p>Now for the truly mind-blowing part: <strong>We could access actual voice recordings</strong> of customer orders. Which god knows how long they store those for.</p>
<p>Not just transcripts. Not just metadata. <strong>Raw audio files</strong> of real people ordering food, complete with background conversations, car radios, and sometimes personally identifiable information.</p>
<p><img src="https://bobdahacker.com/static/images/blogs/rbi/DriveTroughHistory2.png" alt="Drive Through History"></p>
<p><em>Big Brother is watching, and he wants to know if you'd like to supersize that</em></p>
<p>This audio goldmine was being fed into AI systems to analyze:</p>
<ul>
<li>Customer sentiment </li>
<li>Employee friendliness levels</li>
<li>Upsell success rates</li>
<li>Order processing times</li>
<li>How many times employees said "You rule" (because that's definitely a crucial business metric)</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://bobdahacker.com/static/images/blogs/rbi/HowFriendly.png" alt="How Friendly"><br><em>AI-powered friendliness monitoring: dystopian but thorough</em></p>
<p><img src="https://bobdahacker.com/static/images/blogs/rbi/MoreStats.png" alt="More Stats"><br><em>Your drive-thru performance review, brought to you by artificial intelligence</em></p>
<h3>The Bathroom Chronicles</h3>
<p>We found the code for the bathroom rating screen for the tablet was in the assistant panel as well, For example, the bathroom rating screen is located at:</p>
<p><code>https://assistant.bk.com/feedback/storeid/</code></p>
<p>Which we assume the tablet loads in a webapp with its storeId</p>
<p><img src="https://bobdahacker.com/static/images/blogs/rbi/Toiletrating.png" alt="Toiletrating.png"><br><em>Rating bathroom experiences: because everything needs a digital feedback loop</em></p>
<p>The cherry on this porcelain throne? The API that gets called for the feedback sends <strong>zero authentication</strong>. That's right ‚Äì you could spam bathroom reviews for every Burger King location without even proving you've ever been within a mile of their restrooms.</p>
<p>Want to give a 5-star review to a bathroom in Tokyo while sitting in your pajamas in Ohio? The system says "why not!" üöΩ</p>
<hr>
<h2>The Full Damage Report'</h2>
<p>With our newfound admin powers, we could:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Add/remove/manage stores</strong> (Want to open a Burger King on the Moon? Now you can!)  </li>
<li><strong>View/edit employee accounts</strong> (Everyone gets a promotion!)  </li>
<li><strong>Send notifications to any store ids tablet</strong></li>
<li><strong>Access store analytics and sales data</strong> (Numbers, so many numbers)  </li>
<li><strong>Upload files to any store's systems</strong> (Via convenient JWT-signed AWS URLs)  </li>
<li><strong>AND More</strong></li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>Privacy Violations of Epic Proportions</h2>
<ul>
<li>Access to <strong>thousands, possibly hundreds of thousands of voice recordings</strong> containing PII, if you visited a burger king and went thru the drive thru, your voice is probably in the aws bucket, and analyzed by AI.</li>
<li>GDPR lawyers worldwide suddenly perking up</li>
<li>We now know about your embarrassing order of 47 chicken nuggets at 2 AM</li>
</ul>
<hr>

</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>Credit where it's due ‚Äì RBI's response time was impressive. However they never commented on the vulnerabilities or answered us. (I guess our report was too hot to handle.)</p>
<hr>
<h2>The Fine Print</h2>
<p><em>No customer data was retained during this research. No drive-thru orders were harmed in the making of this blog post. Responsible disclosure protocols were followed throughout. We still think the Whopper is pretty good, but Wendys is better</em></p>
<p><strong>So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish</strong></p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/09/05/github_copilot_complaints/">https://www.theregister.com/2025/09/05/github_copilot_complaints/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45148167">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p>Among the software developers who use Microsoft's GitHub, the most popular community discussion in the past 12 months has been a request for a way to block Copilot, the company's AI service, from generating issues and pull requests in code repositories.</p>
<p>The second most popular discussion ‚Äì where popularity is <a href="https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions?discussions_q=is%3Aopen+sort%3Atop+created%3A%3E%3D2024-09-04" rel="nofollow">measured in upvotes</a> ‚Äì is a bug report that seeks a fix for the inability of users to disable Copilot code reviews.</p>
<p>Both of these questions, <a href="https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/159749" rel="nofollow">the first</a> opened in May and <a href="https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/169148" rel="nofollow">the second</a> opened a month ago, remain unanswered, despite an abundance of comments critical of generative AI and Copilot.&nbsp;</p>

    

<p>The author of the first, developer Andi McClure, published <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/237819" rel="nofollow">a similar request</a> to Microsoft's Visual Studio Code repository in January, objecting to the reappearance of a Copilot icon in VS Code after she had uninstalled the Copilot extension.</p>

        


        

<p>Microsoft and GitHub, not to mention rivals like Google, have gone all-in on a technology that a sizable or at least vocal portion of their customers simply don't want. And with <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/07/30/microsoft_hails_cloud_and_ai/">billions in capital expenditures</a> to recoup, they're making it difficult to avoid.</p>
<p>During Microsoft's July 30, 2025 earnings call, CEO Satya Nadella <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://view.officeapps.live.com/op/view.aspx?src=https://cdn-dynmedia-1.microsoft.com/is/content/microsoftcorp/TranscriptFY25q4">said</a> GitHub Copilot continued to exhibit strong momentum and had reached 20 million users.</p>

        

<p>"GitHub Copilot Enterprise customers increased 75 percent quarter over quarter as companies tailor Copilot to their own codebases," said Nadella, noting that AI adoption has increased usage of GitHub over the past year.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>I deeply resent that on top of Copilot seemingly training itself on my GitHub-posted code in violation of my licenses, GitHub wants me to look at (effectively) ads for this project I will never touch</p>
</blockquote>
<p>"I've been for a while now filing issues in the GitHub Community feedback area when Copilot intrudes on my GitHub usage," McClure told <em>The Register</em> in an email. "I deeply resent that on top of Copilot seemingly training itself on my GitHub-posted code in violation of my licenses, GitHub wants me to look at (effectively) ads for this project I will never touch. If something's bothering me, I don't see a reason to stay quiet about it. I think part of how we get pushed into things we collectively don't want is because we stay quiet about it."</p>
<p>It's not just the burden of responding to AI slop, an <a href="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2025/07/14/death-by-a-thousand-slops/" rel="nofollow">ongoing issue</a> for Curl maintainer Daniel Stenberg. It's the permissionless copying and <a href="https://mastodon.social/@sonicrocketman/115149008178747518" rel="nofollow">regurgitation of speculation as fact</a>, mitigated only by small print disclaimers that generative AI may produce inaccurate results. It's also GitHub's <a href="https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/148571" rel="nofollow">disavowal of liability</a> if Copilot code suggestions happen to have reproduced source code that requires attribution.</p>
<p>It's what the Servo project characterizes in its <a href="https://book.servo.org/contributing.html#ai-contributions" rel="nofollow">ban on AI code contributions</a> as the lack of code correctness guarantees, copyright issues, and ethical concerns. Similar objections have been used to justify AI code bans in GNOME's <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/loupe/-/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md?ref_type=heads#use-of-generative-ai" rel="nofollow">Loupe</a> project, <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/09/03/freebsd_project_update_no_ai/">FreeBSD</a>, <a href="https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Project:Council/AI_policy" rel="nofollow">Gentoo</a>, <a href="https://www.netbsd.org/developers/commit-guidelines.html" rel="nofollow">NetBSD</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/qemu/qemu/commit/3d40db0efc22520fa6c399cf73960dced423b048" rel="nofollow">QEMU</a>.</p>
<p>McClure said she has been filing requests to opt out of Copilot for a few years now, but in the last six months, her posts have been attracting more community support.&nbsp;</p>

        

<p>Two issues, about the abovementioned Copilot menu in VS Code and the inability to block Copilot-generated issues and pull requests, she said, have continued to attract comments.</p>
<p>"People keep finding these issues somehow and tacking on to them," McClure said. "Although Microsoft's been forcing the Copilot 'asks' into more and more places in the interface for a while, sometime this year they hit an inflection point where mass numbers of people don't feel like ignoring it anymore, where before they could shrug and ignore it or find the off switch."</p>
<p>In the past month, she said, there's been a second change in the way people see GitHub ‚Äì GitHub's <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/08/11/github_head_ankles_as_microsoft/">demotion from distinct subsidiary to part of Microsoft's CoreAI group</a>.</p>

</ul>
<p>"Despite being a symbolic change, it seems to have galvanized the open source community from just complaining about Copilot to now actively moving away from GitHub," said McClure. "Many of my contacts in the open source community have been talking about plans to move from GitHub to Codeberg or a self-hosted Forgejo (Forgejo is the software used by Codeberg) over the last month, and the comments in those two always-busy GitHub threads have increasingly been people describing how Copilot is inspiring them to move to Codeberg as well."</p>
<p>Calls to shun Microsoft and GitHub go back a long way in the open source community, but moved beyond simmering dissatisfaction in 2022 when the Software Freedom Conservancy (SFC) <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2022/06/30/software_freedom_conservancy_quits_github/">urged free software supporters</a> to <a href="https://sfconservancy.org/GiveUpGitHub/" rel="nofollow">give up GitHub</a>, a position SFC policy fellow Bradley M. Kuhn <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/08/15/codeberg_beset_by_ai_bots/">recently reiterated</a>.</p>
<p>Some of the developers participating in the issues raised by McClure and by others have said they intend to move away from GitHub over its stance on AI.</p>
<p>"Today I rejected two Copilot-generated code suggestions on my PR," <a href="https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/159749#discussioncomment-13329811" rel="nofollow">wrote</a> a developer who posted to McClure's thread under the name Constantine. "This was very disturbing, so I started googling and found this discussion. I refuse using AI in the same way I don't take drugs or steal things - for me it's a matter of principle. So if this continues and Microsoft does not provide a way to opt out of AI for my repositories soon, I will move my code to a self-hosted solution and won't ever return to GitHub."</p>
<p>McClure said she has been slowly shifting toward Codeberg over the past few months. "I haven't been proactively moving repos but whenever I make a change to a repo I clone it to Codeberg, post the change there, and replace my main branch on the GitHub repo with a relocation notice," she said.</p>
<p>"Microsoft as a company has a running problem where they won't take no for an answer, whether with 'AI' or with any other product they want to ship," said McClure. "A favorite tactic of theirs recently is they will enable a thing by default and put an off switch, wait six months, and then slightly change or rename the feature you turned off, and create a new off switch you have to separately turn off. They did this with Bing in Windows 10 and now they're doing it with Copilot in their developer tools (and presumably Windows 11, I don't know, I don't use Windows 11)."</p>
<p>McClure said that when Microsoft began adding Copilot to everything, starting with Android keyboard SwiftKey, she concluded that the situation would reprise the handling of Bing/Cortana in Windows 10 and turning it off would not be enough.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>If you really find Copilot unacceptable ‚Äì and I do, Copilot is so much more noxious than Microsoft's previous forced bundlings ‚Äì the only option is to stop using any Microsoft product that Copilot shows up in</p>
</blockquote>
<p>"If you really find Copilot unacceptable ‚Äì and I do, Copilot is so much more noxious than Microsoft's previous forced bundlings ‚Äì the only option is to stop using any Microsoft product that Copilot shows up in," she said. "I stopped using SwiftKey; I started migrating from desktop Windows to Linux when it became clear mandatory AI surveillance would be a core part of Win11. GitHub and, more sporadically, Visual Studio Code I have had to keep using because they're monopolies in a way even Windows isn't. The network effects (projects whose sole method of communication is GitHub, software whose only IDE integration is a VSCode plugin) are too strong."</p>
<p>Things have progressed as expected, McClure said, with Copilot buttons appearing in VS Code even when Copilot has been uninstalled and poorly labeled buttons that redirect to Copilot searches. She suggests people are starting to tire of the situation and that if it continues, it will weaken the network effects that keep developers tied to GitHub, accelerating further migration.</p>
<p>"When this happens I have no idea if Microsoft will notice or care," said McClure. "The Copilot push at Microsoft appears to be completely top-down and the people at the top seem to have completely forgotten about conventional goals like customer retention. They want to pump up those 'AI' numbers, for whatever reason, and they view their customer base as just a resource to burn to get those metrics up."</p>
<p>GitHub did not respond to a request for comment. ¬Æ</p>

<p>
Like almost all human endeavors, open-source software development involves
a range of power dynamics.  Companies, developers, and users are all
concerned with the power to influence the direction of the software ‚Äî and,
often, to profit from it.  At the 2025 <a href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/open-source-summit-europe/">Open
Source Summit Europe</a>, Dawn Foster talked about how those dynamics can
play out, with an eye toward a couple of tactics ‚Äî rug pulls and forks ‚Äî that
are available to try to shift power in one direction or another.
</p><h4>Power dynamics</h4>
<p>
Since the beginning of history, Foster began, those in power have tended to
use it against those who were weaker.  In the days of feudalism, control of
the land led to exploitation at several levels.  In the open-source world,
the large cloud providers often seem to have the most power, which they use
against smaller companies.  Contributors and maintainers often have less
power than even the smaller companies, and users have less power yet.  
</p><p>
<a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/1036470/"><img src="https://static.lwn.net/images/conf/2025/osseu/DawnFoster-sm.png" alt="[Dawn Foster]" title="Dawn Foster"></a>

We have built a world where it is often easiest to just use whatever a
cloud provider offers, even with open-source software.  Those providers may
not contribute back to the projects they turn into services, though,
upsetting the smaller companies that are, likely as not, doing the bulk of
the work to provide the software in question in the first place.  Those
companies can have a power of their own, however: the power to relicense
the software.  Pulling the rug out from under users of the software in this
way can change the balance of power with regard to cloud providers, but it
leaves contributors and users in a worse position than before.  But
there is a power at this level too: the power to fork the software,
flipping the power balance yet again.
</p><p>
Companies that control a software project have the power to carry out this
sort of rug pull, and they are often not shy about exercising it.
Single-company projects, clearly, are at a much higher risk of rug pulls;
the company has all the power in this case, and others have little
recourse.  So one should look at a company's reputation before adopting a
software project, but that is only so helpful.  Companies can change
direction without notice, be acquired, or go out of business, making
previous assessments of their reputation irrelevant.
</p><p>
The problem often comes down to the simple fact that companies have to
answer to their investors, and that often leads to pressure to relicense
the software they have created in order to increase revenue.  This is
especially true in cases where cloud providers are competing for the same
customers as the company that owns the project.  The result can be a switch
to a more restrictive license aimed at making it harder for other companies
to profit from the project.
</p><p>
A rug pull of this nature can lead to a fork of the project ‚Äî a rebellious,
collective action aimed at regaining some power over the code.  But a fork
is not a simple matter; it is a lot of work, and will fail without people
and resources behind it.  The natural source for that is a large company;
cloud providers, too, can try to shift power via a fork, and they have the
ability to back their fork up with the resources it needs to succeed.
</p><p>

A relicensing event does not always lead to a popular fork; that did not
happen with MongoDB or Sentry, for example.  Foster said she had not looked
into why that was the case.  Sometimes rug pulls take other forms, such as
when Perforce, after acquiring Puppet in 2022, moved it development and
releases behind closed doors, with a reduced frequency of releases back to
the public repository.  That action kicked off the <a href="https://voxpupuli.org/openvox/">OpenVox</a> fork.
</p><h4>Looking at the numbers</h4>
<p>
Foster has spent some time analyzing rug pulls, forks, and what happens
thereafter; a lot of the results are <a href="https://github.com/chaoss/wg-data-science/tree/main/dataset/license-changes/fork-case-study/notebooks">available
for download as Jupyter notebooks</a>.  For each rug-pull event, she looked
at the contributor makeup of the project before and after the ensuing fork
in an attempt to see what effects are felt by the projects involved.
</p><p>
In 2021, Elastic <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/844016/">relicensed Elasticsearch</a>
under the non-free Server Side Public License (SSPL).  Amazon Web Services
then forked the project as <a href="https://opensearch.org/">OpenSearch</a>.  Before the fork, most of
the Elasticsearch contributors were Elastic employees; that,
unsurprisingly, did not change afterward.  OpenSearch started with no
strong contributor base, so had to build its community from scratch.  As a
result, the project has been dominated by Amazon contributors ever since;
the balance has shifted slowly over time, but there was not a big uptick in
outside contributors even after OpenSearch became a Linux Foundation
project in 2024.  While starting a project under a neutral foundation can
help attract contributors, she said, moving a project under a foundation's
umbrella later on does not seem to provide the same benefit.
</p><p>
<a href="https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform">Terraform</a> was
developed mostly by Hashicorp, which <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/942346/">relicensed
the software</a> under the non-free Business Source License in 2023.  One
month later, the <a href="https://opentofu.org/">OpenTofu</a> fork was
started under the Linux Foundation.  While the contributor base for
Terraform, which was almost entirely Hashicorp employees, changed little
after the fork, OpenTofu quickly acquired a number of contributors from
several companies, none of whom had been Terraform contributors before.  In
this case, users drove the fork and placed it under a neutral foundation,
resulting in a more active developer community.
</p><p>
In 2024, <a href="https://redis.io/">Redis</a> was relicensed under the
SSPL; the <a href="https://valkey.io/">Valkey</a> fork was <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/966631/">quickly organized</a>, under the Linux Foundation,
by Redis contributors.  The Redis project differed from the others
mentioned here in that, before the fork, it had nearly twice as many
contributors from outside the company as from within; after the fork, the
number of external Redis contributors dropped to zero.  All of the external
contributors fled to Valkey, with the result that Valkey started with a
strong community representing a dozen or so companies.
</p><p>
Looking at how the <i>usage</i> of these projects changes is harder, she
said, but there appears to be a correlation between the usage of a project
and the number of GitHub forks (cloned repository copies) it has.  There is
typically a spike in these clones after a relicensing event, suggesting
that people are considering creating a hard fork of the project.  In all
cases, the forks that emerged appeared to have less usage than the original
by the "GitHub forks" metric; both branches of the fork continue to go
forward.  But, she said, projects that are relicensed do tend to show
reduced usage, especially when competing forks are created under foundations.
</p><h4>What to do</h4>
<p>
This kind of power game creates problems for both contributors and users,
she said; we contribute our time to these projects, and need them to not be
pulled out from under us.  There is no way to know when a rug pull might
happen, but there are some warning signs to look out for.  At the top of
her list was the use of a contributor license agreement (CLA); these
agreements create a power imbalance, giving the company involved the power
to relicense the software.  Projects with CLAs more commonly are subject to
rug pulls; projects using a developers certificate of origin do not have the
same power imbalance and are less likely to be rug pulled.
</p><p>
One should also look at the governance of a project; while being housed
under a foundation reduces the chance of a rug pull, that can still happen,
especially in cases where the contributors are mostly from a single
company.  She mentioned the <a href="https://www.cncf.io/projects/cortex/">Cortex</a> project, housed under
the Cloud Native Computing Foundation, which was controlled by Grafana; that
company eventually forked its own project to create <a href="https://grafana.com/oss/mimir/">Mimir</a>.  To avoid this kind of
surprise, one should look for projects with neutral governance, with
leaders from multiple organizations.
</p><p>
Projects should also be evaluated on their contributor base; are there
enough contributors to keep things going?  Companies can help, of course,
by having their employees contribute to the projects they depend on,
increasing influence and making those projects more sustainable.  She
mentioned the <a href="https://chaoss.community/">CHAOSS project</a>, which
generates metrics to help in the judgment of the viability of development
projects.  CHAOSS has put together <a href="https://chaoss.community/practitioner-guide-introduction/">a set of
"practitioner guides"</a> intended to help contributors and maintainers
make improvements within a project.
</p><p>
With the sustained rise of the big cloud providers, she concluded, the
power dynamics around open-source software are looking increasingly feudal.
Companies can use relicensing to shift power away from those providers, but
they also take power from contributors when the pull the rug in this way.
Those contributors, though, are in a better position than the serfs of old,
since they have the ability to fork a project they care about, shifting
power back in their direction.

</p><p>
Hazel Weakly asked if there are other protections that contributors and
users might develop to address this problem.  Foster answered that at least
one company changed its mind about a planned relicensing action after
seeing the success of the Valkey and OpenTofu forks.  The ability to fork
has the effect of making companies think harder, knowing that there may be
consequences that follow a rug pull.  Beyond that, she reiterated that
projects should be pushed toward neutral governance.

Dirk Hohndel added that the best thing to do is to bring more outside
contributors into a project; the more of them there are, the higher the
risk associated with a rug pull.  Anybody who just sits back within a
project, he said, is just a passenger; it is better to be driving.

												<p>The chairman of the <strong>Federal Trade Commission</strong> (FTC) last week sent a letter to Google‚Äôs CEO demanding to know why Gmail was blocking messages from Republican senders while allegedly failing to block similar missives supporting Democrats. The letter followed media reports accusing Gmail of disproportionately flagging messages from the GOP fundraising platform <strong>WinRed</strong> and sending them to the spam folder. But according to experts who track daily spam volumes worldwide, WinRed‚Äôs messages are getting blocked more because its methods of blasting email are increasingly way more spammy than that of <strong>ActBlue</strong>, the fundraising platform for Democrats.</p>
<div id="attachment_72095"><p><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-72095" decoding="async" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/nyp-google-spam.png" alt="" width="749" height="255" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/nyp-google-spam.png 865w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/nyp-google-spam-768x262.png 768w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/nyp-google-spam-782x267.png 782w" sizes="(max-width: 749px) 100vw, 749px"></p><p id="caption-attachment-72095">Image: nypost.com</p></div>
<p>On Aug. 13, <strong>The New York Post</strong> ran an ‚Äúexclusive‚Äù <a href="https://nypost.com/2025/08/13/business/google-caught-flagging-gop-fundraiser-emails-as-suspicious-sending-them-directly-to-spam-memo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">story</a> titled, ‚ÄúGoogle caught flagging GOP fundraiser emails as ‚Äòsuspicious‚Äô ‚Äî sending them directly to spam.‚Äù The story cited a memo from Targeted Victory ‚Äì whose clients include the National Republican Senatorial Committee (NRSC), Rep. Steve Scalise and Sen. Marsha Blackburn ‚Äì which said it observed that the ‚Äúserious and troubling‚Äù trend was still going on as recently as June and July of this year.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIf Gmail is allowed to quietly suppress WinRed links while giving ActBlue a free pass, it will continue to tilt the playing field in ways that voters never see, but campaigns will feel every single day,‚Äù the memo reportedly said.</p>
<p>In an August 28 letter to Google CEO <strong>Sundar Pichai</strong>, FTC Chairman <strong>Andrew Ferguson</strong> cited the New York Post story and warned that Gmail‚Äôs parent <strong>Alphabet</strong> may be engaging in unfair or deceptive practices.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAlphabet‚Äôs alleged partisan treatment of comparable messages or messengers in Gmail to achieve political objectives may violate both of these prohibitions under the FTC Act,‚Äù Ferguson wrote. ‚ÄúAnd the partisan treatment may cause harm to consumers.‚Äù</p>
<p>However, the situation looks very different when you ask spam experts what‚Äôs going on with WinRed‚Äôs recent messaging campaigns. <strong>Atro Tossavainen</strong> and <strong>Pekka Jalonen</strong> are co-founders at <a href="https://www.koliloks.eu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Koli-L√µks O√ú</a>, an email intelligence company in Estonia. Koli-L√µks taps into real-time intelligence about daily spam volumes by monitoring large numbers of ‚Äúspamtraps‚Äù ‚Äî email addresses that are intentionally set up to catch unsolicited emails.</p>
<p>Spamtraps are generally not used for communication or account creation, but instead are created to identify senders exhibiting spammy behavior, such as scraping the Internet for email addresses or buying unmanaged distribution lists. As an email sender, blasting these spamtraps over and over with unsolicited email is the fastest way to ruin your domain‚Äôs reputation online. Such activity also virtually ensures that more of your messages are going to start getting listed on spam blocklists that are broadly shared within the global anti-abuse community.</p>
<p>Tossavainen told KrebsOnSecurity that WinRed‚Äôs emails hit its spamtraps in the .com, .net, and .org space far more frequently than do fundraising emails sent by ActBlue. Koli-L√µks published a graph of the stark disparity in spamtrap activity for WinRed versus ActBlue, showing a nearly fourfold increase in spamtrap hits from WinRed emails in the final week of July 2025.</p>
<div id="attachment_72094"><p><a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/koli-loks-red-v-blue.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-72094" decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/koli-loks-red-v-blue.png" alt="" width="749" height="399" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/koli-loks-red-v-blue.png 974w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/koli-loks-red-v-blue-768x409.png 768w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/koli-loks-red-v-blue-782x417.png 782w" sizes="(max-width: 749px) 100vw, 749px"></a></p><p id="caption-attachment-72094">Image: Koliloks.eu</p></div>
<p>‚ÄúMany of our spamtraps are in repurposed legacy-TLD domains (.com, .org, .net) and therefore could be understood to have been involved with a U.S. entity in their pre-zombie life,‚Äù Tossavainen explained in the LinkedIn post.<span id="more-72091"></span></p>
<p><strong>Raymond Dijkxhoorn</strong> is the CEO and a founding member of <a href="https://www.surbl.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SURBL</a>, a widely-used blocklist that flags domains and IP addresses known to be used in unsolicited messages, phishing and malware distribution. Dijkxhoorn said their spamtrap data mirrors that of Koli-L√µks, and shows that WinRed has consistently been far more aggressive in sending email than ActBlue.</p>
<p>Dijkxhoorn said the fact that WinRed‚Äôs emails so often end up dinging the organization‚Äôs sender reputation is not a content issue but rather a technical one.</p>
<p>‚ÄúOn our end we don‚Äôt really care if the content is political or trying to sell viagra or penis enlargements,‚Äù Dijkhoorn said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the mechanics, they should not end up in spamtraps. And that‚Äôs the reason the domain reputation is tempered. Not ‚Äòbecause domain reputation firms have a political agenda.‚Äô We really don‚Äôt care about the political situation anywhere. The same as we don‚Äôt mind people buying penis enlargements. But when either of those land in spamtraps it will impact sending experience.‚Äù</p>
<p>The FTC letter to Google‚Äôs CEO also referenced a <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2022/04/11/despite-what-fox-news-tells-you-a-new-study-did-not-prove-that-gmail-is-biased-against-conservatives/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">debunked</a> <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.16743.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2022 study</a> (PDF) by political consultants who found Google caught more Republican emails in spam filters. <strong>Techdirt</strong> editor <strong>Mike Masnick</strong> notes that while the 2022 study also found that other email providers caught more Democratic emails as spam, ‚ÄúRepublicans laser-focused on Gmail because it fit their victimization narrative better.‚Äù</p>
<p>Masnick said GOP lawmakers then filed both lawsuits and complaints with the <strong>Federal Election Commission</strong> (both of which failed easily), claiming this was somehow an ‚Äúin-kind contribution‚Äù to Democrats.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThis is political posturing designed to keep the White House happy by appearing to ‚Äòdo something‚Äô about conservative claims of ‚Äòcensorship,'‚Äù Masnick <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2025/09/04/ftc-chair-fergusons-ridiculous-crusade-threatening-google-over-spam-filters-that-actually-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote</a> of the FTC letter. ‚ÄúThe FTC has never policed ‚Äòpolitical bias‚Äô in private companies‚Äô editorial decisions, and for good reason‚Äîthe First Amendment prohibits exactly this kind of government interference.‚Äù</p>
<p>WinRed did not respond to a request for comment.</p>
<p>The WinRed website says it is an online fundraising platform supported by a united front of the Trump campaign, the <strong>Republican National Committee</strong> (RNC), the NRSC,&nbsp;and the <strong>National Republican Congressional Committee</strong> (NRCC).</p>
<p>WinRed has recently come under fire for aggressive fundraising via text message as well. In June, <strong>404 Media</strong> reported on <a href="https://www.404media.co/winred-texts-class-action-lawsuit-rnc-donations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a lawsuit</a> filed by a family in Utah against the RNC for allegedly bombarding their mobile phones with text messages seeking donations after they‚Äôd tried to unsubscribe from the missives dozens of times.</p>
<p>One of the family members said they received 27 such messages from 25 numbers, even after sending 20 stop requests. The plaintiffs in that case allege the texts from WinRed and the RNC ‚Äúknowingly disregard stop requests and purposefully use different phone numbers to make it impossible to block new messages.‚Äù</p>
<p>Dijkhoorn said WinRed did inquire recently about why some of its assets had been marked as a risk by SURBL, but he said they appeared to have zero interest in investigating the likely causes he offered in reply.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThey only replied with, ‚ÄòYou are interfering with U.S. elections,'‚Äù Dijkhoorn said, noting that many of SURBL‚Äôs spamtrap domains are only publicly listed in the registration records for random domain names.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThey‚Äôre at best harvested by themselves but more likely [they] just went and bought lists,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not like ‚ÄòOh Google is filtering this and not the other,‚Äô the reason isn‚Äôt the provider. The reason is the fundraising spammers and the lists they send to.‚Äù</p>

  <p><span>05 Sep 2025</span></p><p>    <iframe title="YouTube video player" width="640" height="390" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/38FGT7SWVh0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>

<p>In 2017 I discovered the free of charge <a href="http://orbit.medphys.ucl.ac.uk/">Orbiter 2016</a> space flight simulator which was proprietary at the time and it inspired me to develop a space flight simulator myself.
I prototyped some rigid body physics in C and later in <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/guile/">GNU Guile</a> and also prototyped loading and rendering of Wavefront OBJ files.
I used GNU Guile (a Scheme implementation) because it has a good native interface and of course it has hygienic macros.
Eventually I got interested in Clojure because unlike GNU Guile it has multi-methods as well as fast hash maps and vectors.
I finally decided to develop the game for real in Clojure.
I have been developing a space flight simulator in Clojure for almost 5 years now.
While using Clojure I have come to appreciate the immutable values and safe parallelism using atoms, agents, and refs.</p>

<p>In the beginning I decided to work on the hard parts first, which for me were 3D rendering of a planet, an atmosphere, shadows, and volumetric clouds.
I read the <a href="https://www.informit.com/store/opengl-superbible-comprehensive-tutorial-and-reference-9780672337475">OpenGL Superbible</a> to get an understanding on what functionality OpenGL provides.
When Orbiter was eventually open sourced and released unter MIT license <a href="https://github.com/orbitersim/orbiter">here</a>, I inspected the source code and discovered that about 90% of the code is graphics-related.
So starting with the graphics problems was not a bad decision.</p>

<p>For the atmosphere, <a href="https://ebruneton.github.io/precomputed_atmospheric_scattering/">Bruneton‚Äôs precomputed atmospheric scattering</a> was used.
The implementation uses a 2D transmittance table, a 2D surface scattering table, a 4D Rayleigh scattering, and a 4D Mie scattering table.
The tables are computed using several iterations of numerical integration.
Higher order functions for integration over a sphere and over a line segment were implemented in Clojure.
Integration over a ray in 3D space (using fastmath vectors) was implemented as follows for example:</p>

<p>Precomputing the atmospheric tables takes several hours even though <a href="https://clojuredocs.org/clojure.core/pmap">pmap</a> was used.
When sampling the multi-dimensional functions, <em>pmap</em> was used as a top-level loop and <em>map</em> was used for interior loops.
Using <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/nio/ByteBuffer.html">java.nio.ByteBuffer</a> the floating point values were converted to a byte array and then written to disk using a <a href="https://clojuredocs.org/clojure.java.io/output-stream">clojure.java.io/output-stream</a>:</p>

<p>When launching the game, the lookup tables get loaded and copied into OpenGL textures.
Shader functions are used to lookup and interpolate values from the tables.
When rendering the planet surface or the space craft, the atmosphere essentially gets superimposed using ray tracing.
After rendering the planet, a background quad is rendered to display the remaining part of the atmosphere above the horizon.</p>

<h2 id="templating-opengl-shaders">Templating OpenGL shaders</h2>

<p>It is possible to make programming with OpenGL shaders more flexible by using a templating library such as <em>Comb</em>.
The following shader defines multiple octaves of noise on a base noise function:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="glsl"><span>#version 410 core
</span>
<span>float</span> <span>&lt;%=</span> <span>base</span><span>-</span><span>function</span> <span>%&gt;</span><span>(</span><span>vec3</span> <span>idx</span><span>);</span>

<span>float</span> <span>&lt;%=</span> <span>method</span><span>-</span><span>name</span> <span>%&gt;</span><span>(</span><span>vec3</span> <span>idx</span><span>)</span>
<span>{</span>
  <span>float</span> <span>result</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>.</span><span>0</span><span>;</span>
<span>&lt;%</span> <span>(</span><span>doseq</span> <span>[</span><span>multiplier</span> <span>octaves</span><span>]</span> <span>%&gt;</span>

<span>&lt;%</span> <span>)</span> <span>%&gt;</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>result</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>One can then for example define the function <em>fbm_noise</em> using octaves of the base function <em>noise</em> as follows:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="clojure"><span>(</span><span>def</span><span> </span><span>noise-octaves</span><span>
  </span><span>"Shader function to sum octaves of noise"</span><span>

<h2 id="planet-rendering">Planet rendering</h2>


<p>    <iframe title="YouTube video player" width="640" height="390" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/Ce3oWQflYOY" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>

<p>To render the planet, <a href="https://visibleearth.nasa.gov/collection/1484/blue-marble">NASA Bluemarble</a> data, <a href="https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/features/NightLights/page3.php">NASA Blackmarble</a> data, and <a href="https://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/mgg/topo/gltiles.html">NASA Elevation</a> data was used.
The images were converted to a multi resolution pyramid of map tiles.
The following functions were implemented for color map tiles and for elevation tiles:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a function to load and cache map tiles of given 2D tile index and level of detail</li>
  <li>a function to extract a pixel from a map tile</li>
  <li>a function to extract the pixel for a specific longitude and latitude</li>
</ul>

<p>The functions for extracting a pixel for given longitude and latitude then were used to generate a cube map with a quad tree of tiles for each face.
For each tile, the following files were generated:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A daytime texture</li>
  <li>A night time texture</li>
  <li>An image of 3D vectors defining a surface mesh</li>
  <li>A water mask</li>
  <li>A normal map</li>
</ul>

<p>Altogether 655350 files were generated.
Because the Steam ContentBuilder does not support a large number of files, each row of tile data was aggregated into a tar file.
The <em>Apache Commons Compress</em> library allows you to open a tar file to get a list of entries and then perform random access on the contents of the tar file.
A Clojure LRU cache was used to maintain a cache of open tar files for improved performance.</p>

<p>At run time, a future is created, which returns an updated tile tree, a list of tiles to drop, and a path list of the tiles to load into OpenGL.
When the future is realized, the main thread deletes the OpenGL textures from the drop list, and then uses the path list to get the new loaded images from the tile tree, load them into OpenGL textures, and create an updated tile tree with the new OpenGL textures added.
The following functions to manipulate quad trees were implemented to realize this:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="clojure"><span>(</span><span>defn</span><span> </span><span>quadtree-add</span><span>

<h3 id="solar-system">Solar system</h3>

<p>The astronomy code for getting the position and orientation of planets was implemented according to the <a href="https://rhodesmill.org/skyfield/">Skyfield</a> Python library.
The Python library in turn is based on the <a href="https://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/naif/index.html">SPICE</a> toolkit of the NASA JPL.
The JPL basically provides sequences of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chebyshev_polynomials">Chebyshev polynomials</a> to interpolate positions of Moon and planets as well as the orientation of the Moon as binary files.
Reference coordinate systems and orientations of other bodies are provided in text files which consist of human and machine readable sections.
The binary files were parsed using <em>Gloss</em> (see <a href="https://github.com/clj-commons/gloss/wiki/Introduction">Wiki</a> for some examples) and the text files using <em>Instaparse</em>.</p>

<h3 id="jolt-bindings">Jolt bindings</h3>

<p>The required Jolt functions for wheeled vehicle dynamics and collisions with meshes were wrapped in C functions and compiled into a shared library.
The <em>Coffi</em> Clojure library (which is a wrapper for Java‚Äôs new Foreign Function &amp; Memory API) was used to make the C functions and data types usable in Clojure.</p>

<p>For example the following code implements a call to the C function <em>add_force</em>:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="clojure"><span>(</span><span>defcfn</span><span> </span><span>add-force</span><span>

<p>Here <em>::vec3</em> refers to a custom composite type defined using basic types.
The memory layout, serialisation, and deserialisation for <em>::vec3</em> are defined as follows:</p>

<p>Various targets were defined to build the different components of the project.
For example the atmospheric lookup tables can be build by specifying <em>clj -T:build atmosphere-lut</em> on the command line.</p>

<p>The following section in the <em>build.clj</em> file was added to allow creating an ‚ÄúUberjar‚Äù JAR file with all dependencies by specifying <em>clj -T:build uber</em> on the command-line.</p>

<p>In order to distribute the game on Steam, three depots were created:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a data depot with the operating system independent data files</li>
  <li>a Linux depot with the Linux executable and Uberjar including LWJGL‚Äôs Linux native bindings</li>
  <li>and a Windows depot with the Windows executable and an Uberjar including LWJGL‚Äôs Windows native bindings</li>
</ul>

<p>When updating a depot, the Steam ContentBuilder command line tool creates and uploads a patch in order to preserve storage space and bandwidth.</p>

<h2 id="future-work">Future work</h2>

<p>Although the hard parts are mostly done, there are still several things to do:</p>

<ul>
  <li>control surfaces and thruster graphics</li>
  <li>launchpad and runway graphics</li>
  <li>sound effects</li>
  <li>a 3D cockpit</li>
  <li>the Moon</li>
  <li>a space station</li>
</ul>

<p>It would also be interesting to make the game modable in a safe way (maybe evaluating Clojure files in a sandboxed environment?).</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>


<p>    <iframe title="YouTube video player" width="640" height="390" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/1PqmVLUt5_g" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>

<p>You can find the <a href="https://github.com/wedesoft/sfsim">source code on Github</a>.
Currently there is only a playtest build, but if you want to get notified, when the game gets released, you can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3687560/sfsim/">wishlist it here</a>.</p>

<p>Anyway, let me know any comments and suggestions.</p>

<p>Enjoy!</p>

<p><span data-as="p">GLM-4.5 and GLM-4.5-Air are our latest flagship models, purpose-built as foundational models for agent-oriented applications. Both leverage a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture. GLM-4.5 has a total parameter count of 355B with 32B active parameters per forward pass, while GLM-4.5-Air adopts a more streamlined design with 106B total parameters and 12B active parameters.</span>
<span data-as="p">Both models share a similar training pipeline: an initial pretraining phase on 15 trillion tokens of general-domain data, followed by targeted fine-tuning on datasets covering code, reasoning, and agent-specific tasks. The context length has been extended to 128k tokens, and reinforcement learning was applied to further enhance reasoning, coding, and agent performance.</span>
<span data-as="p">GLM-4.5 and GLM-4.5-Air are optimized for tool invocation, web browsing, software engineering, and front-end development. They can be integrated into code-centric agents such as Claude Code and Roo Code, and also support arbitrary agent applications through tool invocation APIs.</span>
<span data-as="p">Both models support hybrid reasoning modes, offering two execution modes: Thinking Mode for complex reasoning and tool usage, and Non-Thinking Mode for instant responses. These modes can be toggled via the <code>thinking.type</code>parameter (with <code>enabled</code> and <code>disabled</code> settings), and dynamic thinking is enabled by default.</span></p>

<h3 id="overview-2"><span>Overview</span></h3>
<p><span data-as="p">The first-principle measure of AGI lies in integrating more general intelligence capabilities without compromising existing functions. GLM-4.5 represents our first complete realization of this concept. It combines advanced reasoning, coding, and agent capabilities within a single model, achieving a significant technological breakthrough by natively fusing reasoning, coding, and agent abilities to meet the complex demands of agent-based applications.</span>
<span data-as="p">To comprehensively evaluate the model‚Äôs general intelligence, we selected 12 of the most representative benchmark suites, including MMLU Pro, AIME24, MATH 500, SciCode, GPQA, HLE, LiveCodeBench, SWE-Bench, Terminal-bench, TAU-Bench, BFCL v3, and BrowseComp. Based on the aggregated average scores, GLM-4.5 ranks second globally among all models, first among domestic models, and first among open-source models.</span>

<p><span data-as="p">GLM-4.5 has half the number of parameters of DeepSeek-R1 and one-third that of Kimi-K2, yet it outperforms them on multiple standard benchmark tests. This is attributed to the higher parameter efficiency of GLM architecture. Notably, GLM-4.5-Air, with 106 billion total parameters and 12 billion active parameters, achieves a significant breakthrough‚Äîsurpassing models such as Gemini 2.5 Flash, Qwen3-235B, and Claude 4 Opus on reasoning benchmarks like Artificial Analysis, ranking among the top three domestic models in performance.</span>
<span data-as="p">On charts such as SWE-Bench Verified, the GLM-4.5 series lies on the Pareto frontier for performance-to-parameter ratio, demonstrating that at the same scale, the GLM-4.5 series delivers optimal performance.</span>

<p><span data-as="p">Real-world performance matters more than leaderboard rankings. To evaluate GLM-4.5‚Äôs effectiveness in practical Agent Coding scenarios, we integrated it into Claude Code and benchmarked it against Claude 4 Sonnet, Kimi-K2, and Qwen3-Coder.</span>
<span data-as="p">The evaluation consisted of 52 programming and development tasks spanning six major domains, executed in isolated container environments with multi-turn interaction tests.</span>
<span data-as="p">As shown in the results (below), GLM-4.5 demonstrates a strong competitive advantage over other open-source models, particularly in tool invocation reliability and task completion rate. While there remains room for improvement compared to Claude 4 Sonnet, GLM-4.5 delivers a largely comparable experience in most scenarios.</span>

<p>Tesla has changed the meaning of ‚ÄúFull Self-Driving‚Äù, also known as ‚ÄúFSD‚Äù, to give up on its original promise of delivering unsupervised autonomy.</p>



<p>Since 2016, Tesla has claimed that all its vehicles in production would be capable of achieving unsupervised self-driving capability.</p>



<p>CEO Elon Musk has claimed that it would happen by the end of every year since 2018.</p>



<p>Tesla has even sold a software package, known as ‚ÄúFull Self-Driving Capability‚Äù (FSD), for up to $15,000 to customers, promising that the advanced driver-assist system would become fully autonomous through over-the-air software updates.</p>	
	



<p>Almost a decade later, the promise has yet to be fulfilled, and Tesla has already confirmed that all vehicles produced between 2016 and 2023 don‚Äôt have the proper hardware to deliver unsupervised self-driving as promised.</p>



<p>Musk has been discussing the upgrade of the computers in these vehicles to appease owners, but there‚Äôs no concrete plan to implement it.</p>



<p>While there‚Äôs no doubt that Tesla has promised unsupervised self-driving capabilities to FSD buyers between 2016 and 2023, the automaker has since updated its language and now only sells ‚ÄúFull Self-Driving (Supervised)‚Äù to customers:</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" width="630" height="694" src="https://electrek.co/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-05-at-2.07.54-PM.png" alt="" srcset="https://electrek.co/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-05-at-2.07.54-PM.png 630w, https://electrek.co/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-05-at-2.07.54-PM.png?resize=136,150 136w, https://electrek.co/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-05-at-2.07.54-PM.png?resize=272,300 272w, https://electrek.co/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-05-at-2.07.54-PM.png?resize=318,350 318w, https://electrek.co/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-05-at-2.07.54-PM.png?resize=140,154 140w, https://electrek.co/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-05-at-2.07.54-PM.png?resize=150,165 150w" sizes="(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px"></figure>



<p>The fine print mentions that it doesn‚Äôt make the vehicle ‚Äúautonomous‚Äù and doesn‚Äôt promise it as a feature. </p>



<p>In other words, people buying FSD today are not really buying the capability of unsupervised self-driving as prior buyers did.</p>



<p>Furthermore, Tesla‚Äôs board has just submitted <a href="https://electrek.co/2025/09/05/tesla-tsla-board-fully-loses-its-mind-and-offers-elon-musk-a-pay-package-worth-up-to-1-trillion/">a new</a><span><a href="https://electrek.co/2025/09/05/tesla-tsla-board-fully-loses-its-mind-and-offers-elon-musk-a-pay-package-worth-up-to-1-trillion/" target="_blank">, unprecedented CEO compensation package for shareholders‚Äô approval, which could give Musk up to $1 trillion</a>&nbsp;in stock options pending</span> the achievement of certain milestones.</p>



<p>One of these milestones is Tesla having ‚Äú10 Million Active FSD Subscriptions.‚Äù</p>



<p>At first glance, this would be hopeful for FSD buyers since part of Musk‚Äôs compensation would be dependent on delivering on the FSD promises.</p>



<p>However, Tesla has changed the definition of FSD in the compensation package with an extremely vague one‚Äù</p>



<blockquote>
<p>‚ÄúFSD‚Äù means an advanced driving system, regardless of the marketing name used, that is capable of performing transportation tasks that provide autonomous or similar functionality under specified driving conditions.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Tesla now considers FSD only an ‚Äúadvanced driving system‚Äù that should be ‚Äúcapable of performing transportation tasks that prove autonomous or similar functionality‚Äù.</p>



<p>The current version of FSD, which requires constant supervising by the driver, could easily fit that description.</p>



<p>Therefore, FSD now doesn‚Äôt come with the inital promise of Tesla owners being able to go to sleep in their vehicles and wake up at their destination ‚Äì a promise that Musk has used to sell Tesla vehicles for years.</p>



<h2 id="h-electrek-s-take">Electrek‚Äôs Take</h2>



<p>The way Tesla discusses autonomy with customers and investors versus how it presents it in its court filings and legally binding documents is strikingly different.</p>



<p>It should be worrying to anyone with an interest in this.</p>



<p>With this very vague description in the new CEO compensation package, Tesla could literally lower the price of FSD and even remove base Autopilot to push customers toward FSD and give Musk hundreds of billions of dollars in shares in the process.</p>




	<p>There‚Äôs precedent for Tesla decreasing pricing on FSD. Initially, Musk said that Tesla would gradually increase the price of the FSD package as the features improved and approached unsupervised autonomy.</p>



<p>That was true for a while, but then Tesla started slashing FSD prices, which are now down $7,000 from their high in 2023:</p>

<p>The trend is quite apparent and coincidentally began when Tesla‚Äôs sales started to decline.</p>



<p>FSD is now a simple ADAS system without any promise of unsupervised self-driving. This might quite honestly be one of the biggest cases of false advertising or bait-and-switch ever.</p>

<h3>About the Map</h3><p>
This map shows all the star systems that lie within 12.5
light years of our Sun.  Most of the stars are red dwarfs - stars with a tenth of
the Sun's mass and less than one hundredth the luminosity.  Roughly eighty percent
of all the stars in the universe are red dwarfs, and the nearest star - Proxima - is
a typical example.

              <p>I just received an email from Google stating that they are no longer it's going to support the Nest 1st gen and 2nd gen thermostats. While they will continue to operate locally, it appears that they will no longer work with the Nest app or Home app controls. I currently use the Nest app to control the thermostats, but does this mean that we won't even be able to control the thermostats via a Hubitat integration?</p>

            <p>I got email too. WHat a bummer. It says the API will be removed, so my guess is unless someone comes up with a heck, there's no way to interact with the thermostat other than thru the physical dial.</p>

<p>The latest Nests (from 2020 on - G3 or greater?) now support local Matter - So that's a long term option that's not cloud dependant.   That all said, I certainly understand if you don't want to go back to the well with Google/Nest</p>

            <p>Planned obsolescence is exactly this, that is the first reason why you never buy anything that needs the internet to function the way you want it to function. If you do buy it, be sure this will happen and more than less in the coming years, it's either this sh!t or the now ever so popular pay a monthly fee. YOU OWN NOTHING AND WE OWN YOU</p>

              <p>These replies are all really helpful, thank you! I just checked and I have 9 Gen 1 and 2 Nest thermostats, all of which I will need to replace if I want to control them remotely (which I do). Google have offered the Gen 4 thermostats for $150 each, but I don't want to be in the same position as I am now if Google stop supporting them in the future. Is this a concern, or are we saying that these Gen 4 thermostats will ALWAYS be able to be controlled via the Hubitat hub?  If not, what other thermostats do you all recommend that are more futureproof?</p>

<p>Yes, theoritically this - Assuming your using Matter as the interface protocol.  That said, I think the support for matter T-Stats is fairly limited, setpoints, on/off, mode, and current temps, that's about it.</p>
<p>But you should definitely read the following threads - There is a HE built in Googe Nest Thermostat driver available - But some questions to be considered are:</p>



<p>Hence my comment above about "the technically" are supported, but <a href="https://community.hubitat.com/u/bcopeland">@bcopeland</a> would have to weigh in on what works, and what's actually exposed on the matter side.  - But yes, after provisioning (setup), Matter is all local (so no Google cloud dependancy).  The second thread mentioned above, has a good screenshot at the top that shows what the Matter driver exposes.</p>
<p>Regardless, I would just buy 1 and test (with a site with a good return policy), before going "all in", but obviously, YMMV</p>

<p>If always having local control over your thermostat while maintaining full functionality while being able to control remotely I can't recommend enough getting the Ecobee thermostats and setting up an instance of Home Assistant on a RPi or a cheap second hand computer.</p>
<p>Then through the Homekit Device integration in HA you connect the Ecobee via the Homekit code.  (Just connect the Ecobee to your wifi first, not the Homekit app).</p>
<p>Then using the Home Assistant Device Bridge you can bring in any amount of entities you want of your thermostats into Hubitat and have full use of them.  You can write all your rules/automations in Hubitat.</p>
<p>Then if wifi support is dropped by Ecobee you will always have local control.  The benefit of this above matter is you will have every function you would have through the Ecobee app.  Unless you didn't bring them all over and that choice is yours.</p>

              <p>Thank you both! It looks as though the Nest integration is a bit messy/painful and could have limited functionality. I have Ecobee thermostats in another house and I haven't had any trouble with them, so while IMO they don't look as cool or feel as good as the Nest thermostats, it sounds as though they are currently more reliable.</p>
<p><a href="https://community.hubitat.com/u/aaiyar">@aaiyar</a> I have a Hubitat C8-Pro, but are you saying that I can't just pair the Ecobees with the Hubitat and I need to run a RaspberryPi to somehow connect the Ecobees to the Hubitat? I'm afraid I don't have the time right now to play around with it and just need thermostats that can connect to and be controlled by the Hubitat.</p>
<p>EDIT: this article appears to say I can just connect the Ecobees directly to the Hubitat: <a href="https://docs2.hubitat.com/en/apps/ecobee-integration" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Ecobee Integration | Hubitat Documentation</a></p>

            <p>Ah thanks. So I could run the ecobee thermostats with the cloud integration for now and then in a few years time if ecobee stop supporting the cloud integration then I could run a local instance of HA and still be able to control my thermostats via habita?</p>

            <p>Having been burned by Google on their Nest Secure and Nest Protect offerings, I fear it is only a matter of time before they end of life their Nest 3rd generation thermostat. So I have already been researching it's replacement.  Take a look at Go Control z-wave thermostat. Looks promising and it is natively supported in Hubitat.  Plus we won't be bugged by Google into ceeding our autonomy to the utility company over the environmental settings.  I have not which it why they bug me about it.  Do not believe Google about being always being able to override their remote adjustments. A lesson I learned by reading complaints from users in California. Seems the state declared a grid emergency so commanded participant devices to set to much higher cooling temperatures. Ok fine but also locked out any ability to change it back. A "feature" Google never mentions and a permanent deal breaker for me.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div dir="auto"><p>It started out harmlessly, a comment on hacker news roughly 16 years ago. </p><p>From there it expanded to reddit, substack, twitter. And it increased in frequency, from every few months to every week, peaking at several times a day. It became an addictive, productive habit‚ÄîI would scan the headlines for a catchy title, quickly skim the piece, and then race to the comment section and type one out. </p><p>Sometimes the comments were insightful or funny. At other times, curt or nitpicky. It was an exercise of logic, of ideation, of debate. It was a mix of disdain, delight and discourse. But mostly it was just a fun time. </p><p>Being an active commenter felt like being an internet socialite, part of an elite society of people who put their voice out there instead of lurked. And my fellow internet socialites responded in turn. Some upvoted, responded, debated. Some liked what I said, some hated it. A few of my comments made it to the top and became a fountain of dopamine. A few comments made it to the very bottom too. </p><p>That can happen with 16 years of commenting history. </p><p>I‚Äôve benefited incredibly from commenting. It has sharpened both my writing and logic. It has developed my voice. It has trained me in debate. It has unleashed personas that I would otherwise never become‚Äîteacher, supporter, economist, historian, debater, and of course, troll. </p><p>It has made me a (mostly) better person. But I cannot shake the conviction that I need to leave commenting for good.</p><p>Why? Well, I‚Äôve been reflecting on what I want out of the internet (as part of a larger reflection of what I want out of life). I‚Äôve always enjoyed the internet as the frontier of  ‚Äúnew‚Äù‚Äîits where I find novel ideas, content, thoughts, personalities, achievements and craft. But with the rise of doom scrolling, media echo chambers, AI, and my age, ‚Äúnew‚Äù is no longer that exciting. I find myself less satisfied browsing the internet, hoping the next thing I consume to be actually high quality, and I‚Äôm realizing that I‚Äôd rather just spend my time with a good set of quality friends. </p><p>Unfortunately, this is where comment culture comes in. 16 years of commenting has made me zero friends. </p><p>That scares me. All of that social activity with zero ROI. At first, I thought that I needed to change my commenting habits, and, you know, try to make connections. But the more I considered how to make friends in comment culture, the more I realized that it wasn‚Äôt just my own social ineptitude. Comment culture has a problem. Systemically, it produces an internet of strangers.</p><p>Now, making friends in real life is not easy and it doesn‚Äôt get easier over time. The social steps of growing your friend pool involve 1) meeting new people, 2) turning strangers into acquantainces, and 3) turning acquantainces into friends. This takes a surprising amount of volume and time. </p><p>Various estimates of lifetime human acquantainces range from 10,000 to 80,000 people, but actual friendships number only in the hundreds, and that‚Äôs being generous. And the number of close friends is on average, only 3-5. So, meeting strangers and turning them into close friends is a rather rare occurence that involves a serious investment of focused social energy, something that is harder to do the older you get. One study showed that in order to form a close friendship, you need to spend 200 hours of interaction time with one person. So, making 5 close friends is a 1000 hour investment, equal to a full time job for half a year. </p><p>Comment culture requires your social energy. It‚Äôs an interaction with another human being, but one that doesn‚Äôt head towards building relationships. Instead, the end result is gaining reputation, fame, and of course, internet points.</p><p>This isn‚Äôt a bad thing; besides close friends, the other spend of social energy is towards reputation and influence, especially in small communities. But in comment culture, each post is its own communal space of random strangers. It is the illusion of small community, but really the community appears and dissappears with every new post. Outside of a handful of celebrities or moderators, I rarely find myself spotting someone I know in the comments. </p><p>The end result is that comment culture is a series of one-offs with anonymous strangers upvoting you or responding to you, but never befriending you. In comment culture, you are talking to a random sampling of everybody, which is in itself a collective nobody.</p><p>Broadly speaking, the online platforms we use are not built for connection; they are built for engagement. This is universally true for all internet spaces, from stories to newsfeeds, for the intellectual and the plebian alike. And in the relentless optimization of user engagement, our social engagement is captured and rerouted from its original purpose. Instead of making friends, we are all performing for one collective internet stranger‚Äîa being that is sometimes brilliant, sometimes cruel, but always waiting to be impressed.</p><p>It somehow feels like interactions that might have grown a friendship have instead ended up growing ad impressions. This is not strictly true, but I can‚Äôt shake the feeling that it isn‚Äôt wrong either.</p><p>So this is where I say goodbye to my fellow comment writing socialites. I might miss you a bit, but you will not miss me, because you don‚Äôt even know me. I'm a stranger, and you, dear reader, are likely a stranger too. </p><p>Where do I go instead? Well, as long as engagement makes money, the pressure will always be there, from forces far bigger than us, to pull our social instincts out into the open forum where they can be measured, tracked, and sold. This isn‚Äôt a problem with comments or our internet spaces. Its a problem of market forces.</p><p>But as long as we want to make and keep good friends, that itself is its own driving force. It‚Äôs what drives us to gather a group of people around a campfire. It revives LAN parties from the childhood days. It creates those long chains of memes sent to the few that truly appreciate them. It builds its own spaces not bound to one platform or another, but bound to the people know, care for, and love.</p><p>But‚Ä¶ knowing me, I‚Äôll probably be on Discord.</p></div></div>]]></description>
