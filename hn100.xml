<p>Why is Rust now being used to replace parts of the JavaScript web ecosystem like minification (Terser), transpilation (Babel), formatting (Prettier), bundling (webpack), linting (ESLint), and more?</p>
<h2>What is Rust?</h2>
<p>Rust helps developers write fast software that's memory-efficient. It's a modern replacement for languages like C++ or C with a focus on code safety and concise syntax.</p>
<p>Rust is quite different than JavaScript. JavaScript tries to find variables or objects not in use and automatically clears them from memory. This is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garbage_collection_(computer_science)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Garbage Collection</a>. The language abstracts the developer from thinking about manual memory management.</p>
<p>With Rust, developers have more control over memory allocation, without it being as painful as C++.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Rust uses a relatively unique memory management approach that incorporates the idea of memory “ownership”. Basically, Rust keeps track of who can read and write to memory. It knows when the program is using memory and immediately frees the memory once it is no longer needed. It enforces memory rules at compile time, making it virtually impossible to have runtime memory bugs. You do not need to manually keep track of memory. The compiler takes care of it. – <a href="https://blog.discord.com/why-discord-is-switching-from-go-to-rust-a190bbca2b1f" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Discord</a></p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Adoption</h2>
<p>On top of the companies mentioned above, Rust is also being used for popular open-source libraries like:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Firecracker</a> (AWS)</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/bottlerocket-os/bottlerocket" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bottlerocket</a> (AWS)</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/cloudflare/quiche" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Quiche</a> (Cloudflare)</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/mozilla/neqo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Neqo</a> (Mozilla)</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Rust has been a force multiplier for our team, and betting on Rust was one of the best decisions we made. More than performance, its ergonomics and focus on correctness has helped us tame sync's complexity. We can encode complex invariants about our system in the type system and have the compiler check them for us. – <a href="https://dropbox.tech/infrastructure/rewriting-the-heart-of-our-sync-engine" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dropbox</a></p>
</blockquote>
<h2>From JavaScript to Rust</h2>
<p>JavaScript is the most widely used programming language, operating on every device with a web browser. Over the past ten years, a massive ecosystem has been built around JavaScript:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Webpack:</strong> bundle multiple JavaScript files into one.</li>
<li><strong>Babel:</strong> write modern JavaScript while supporting older browsers.</li>
<li><strong>Terser:</strong> generate the smallest possible file sizes.</li>
<li><strong>Prettier:</strong> format code in an opinionated way.</li>
<li><strong>ESLint:</strong> find issues with their code before deploying.</li>
</ul>
<p>Millions of lines of code have been written and even more bugs have been fixed to create the bedrock for shipping web applications of today. All of these tools are written with JavaScript or TypeScript. This has worked well, but we've reached peak optimization with JS. This has inspired a new class of tools, designed to drastically improve the performance of building for the web.</p>
<h3>SWC</h3>
<p><a href="http://swc.rs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SWC</a>, created in 2017, is an extensible Rust-based platform for the next generation of fast developer tools. It's used by tools like Next.js, Parcel, and Deno, as well as companies like Vercel, ByteDance, Tencent, Shopify, and more.</p>
<p>SWC can be used for compilation, minification, bundling, and more – and is designed to be extended. It's something you can call to perform code transformations (either built-in or custom). Running those transformations happens through higher-level tools like Next.js.</p>
<h3>Deno</h3>
<p><a href="https://deno.land/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Deno</a>, created in 2018, is a simple, modern, and secure runtime for JavaScript and TypeScript that uses <a href="https://v8.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">V8</a> and is built with Rust. It's an attempt to replace Node.js, written by the original creators of Node.js. While it was created in 2018, it didn't hit <a href="https://deno.com/blog/v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">v1.0 until May 2020</a>.</p>
<p>Deno's linter, code formatter, and docs generator are <a href="https://twitter.com/devongovett/status/1369033422002389000" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">built using SWC</a>.</p>
<h3>esbuild</h3>
<p><a href="https://esbuild.github.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">esbuild</a>, created in January 2020, is a JavaScript bundler and minifier 10-100x faster than existing tools, written in Go.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I'm trying to create a build tool that A) works well for a given sweet spot of use cases (bundling JavaScript, TypeScript, and maybe CSS) and B) <strong>resets the expectations of the community for what it means for a JavaScript build tool to be fast</strong>. Our current tools are way too slow in my opinion. – Evan, Creator of esbuild (<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22336334" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Source</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Building JavaScript tooling with systems programming languages, like Go and Rust, was fairly niche until esbuild was released. In my opinion, esbuild sparked a wider interest in trying to make developer tools faster. Evan chose to use Go:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Rust version probably could be made to work at an equivalent speed with enough effort. But at a high level, Go was much more enjoyable to work with. This is a side project and it has to be fun for me to work on it. – Evan, Creator of esbuild (<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22336284" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Source</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some argue Rust could perform better, but both could achieve Evan's original goal of influencing the community:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Even with just basic optimization, Rust was able to outperform the hyper hand-tuned Go version. This is a huge testament to how easy it is to write efficient programs with Rust compared to the deep dive we had to do with Go. – <a href="https://blog.discord.com/why-discord-is-switching-from-go-to-rust-a190bbca2b1f" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Discord</a></p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Rome</h3>
<p><a href="https://rome.tools/blog/2020/08/08/introducing-rome" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rome</a>, created in August 2020,&nbsp;is a linter, compiler, bundler, test runner, and more, for JavaScript, TypeScript, HTML, JSON, Markdown, and CSS. They aim to replace and unify the entire frontend development toolchain. It's created by <a href="https://twitter.com/sebmck" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sebastian</a>, who also created Babel.</p>
<p>Why rewrite everything, then?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Making the necessary modifications to Babel to allow for it to be a reliable base for other tools would have required changes to absolutely everything. The architecture is bound to the initial design choices I made in 2014 when I was learning about parsers, ASTs, and compilers. - Sebastian (<a href="https://rome.tools/blog/2020/08/08/introducing-rome" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Source</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Rome is currently written in TypeScript and runs on Node.js. But they're now working on <a href="https://rome.tools/blog/2021/09/21/rome-will-be-rewritten-in-rust" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">rewriting in Rust</a> using RSLint parser and their own visitor system for AST traversal.</p>
<h3>NAPI</h3>
<p>Rust's integration with Node.js is better than other low-level languages.</p>
<p><a href="https://napi.rs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">napi-rs</a> allows you to build pre-compiled Node.js add-ons with Rust. It provides an out-of-the-box solution for cross-compilation and publishing native binaries to NPM, without needing <code><span><span>node</span><span>-</span><span>gyp</span></span></code> or <code><span><span>postinstall</span></span></code> scripts.</p>
<p>You can build a Rust module that can be called directly from Node.js, without needing to create a child process like esbuild.</p>
<h2>Rust + WebAssembly</h2>
<p><a href="https://webassembly.org/docs/use-cases/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WebAssembly</a>&nbsp;(WASM) is a portable low-level language that Rust can compile to. It runs in the browser, is interoperable with JavaScript, and is supported in all major modern browsers.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>WASM is definitely a lot faster than JS, but not quite native speed. In our tests, Parcel runs 10-20x slower when compiled to WASM than with native binaries. – <a href="https://twitter.com/devongovett" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Devon Govett</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>While WASM isn't the perfect solution yet, it <em>can</em> help developers create extremely fast web experiences. The Rust team is <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/what/wasm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">committed</a> to a high-quality and cutting-edge WASM implementation. For developers, this means you could have the performance advantages of Rust (vs. Go) while still compiling for the web (using WASM).</p>
<p>Some early libraries and frameworks in this space:</p>

<p>These Rust-based web frameworks that compile to WASM aren't trying to replace JavaScript, but work alongside it. While we aren't there yet, it's interesting to see Rust coming after the web on both sides: <strong>making existing JavaScript tooling faster</strong> <em>and</em> <strong>future-forward ideas for <a href="https://rustwasm.github.io/docs/book/introduction.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">compiling to WASM</a></strong>.</p>
<p>It's Rust all the way down.</p>
<h2>Why Not Rust?</h2>
<p>Rust has a steep learning curve. It's a lower level of abstraction than what most web developers are used to.</p>
<p>Once you're on native code (through Rust, Go, Zig, or other low-level languages),
the algorithms and data structures are <a href="https://twitter.com/devongovett/status/1457945506332692482" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">more important</a> than the language choice. It's not a silver bullet.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Rust makes you think about dimensions of your code that matter tremendously for systems programming. It makes you think about how memory is shared or copied. It makes you think about real but unlikely corner cases and make sure that they're handled. It helps you write code that's incredibly efficient in every possible way. – Tom MacWright (<a href="https://macwright.com/2021/01/15/rust.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Source</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Further, Rust's usage in the web community is still niche. It hasn't reached critical adoption. Even though learning Rust for JavaScript tooling will be a barrier to entry, interestingly developers would rather have a <a href="https://twitter.com/devongovett/status/1261379312898306048" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">faster tool that's harder to contribute to</a>. <a href="https://craigmod.com/essays/fast_software/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fast software wins</a>.</p>
<p>Currently, it's hard to find a Rust library or framework for your favorite services (things like working with authentication, databases, payments, and more). I do think that once Rust and WASM reach critical adoption, this will resolve itself. But not yet. <strong>We need existing JavaScript tools to help us bridge the gap and incrementally adopt performance improvements</strong>.</p>
<h2>The Future of JavaScript Tooling</h2>
<p>I believe Rust is the future of JavaScript tooling. <a href="http://nextjs.org/12" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Next.js 12</a> started our transition to fully replace Babel (transpilation) and Terser (minification) with SWC and Rust. Why?</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Extensibility:</strong> SWC can be used as a Crate inside Next.js, without having to fork the library or workaround design constraints.</li>
<li><strong>Performance:</strong> We were able to achieve ~3x faster Fast Refresh and ~5x faster builds in Next.js by switching to SWC, with more room for optimization still in progress.</li>
<li><strong>WebAssembly:</strong> Rust's support for WASM is essential for supporting all possible platforms and taking Next.js development everywhere.</li>
<li><strong>Community:</strong> The Rust community and ecosystem are amazing and only growing.</li>
</ul>
<p>It's not just Next.js adopting SWC, either:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://deno.land/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Deno's</a> linter, code formatter, and docs generator are <a href="https://twitter.com/devongovett/status/1369033422002389000" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">built using SWC</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/devongovett/dprint-node" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">dprint</a>, built on SWC, is a <a href="https://twitter.com/devongovett/status/1400138335721455617" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">30x faster</a> code formatting replacement for Prettier.</li>
<li><a href="https://parceljs.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Parcel</a> improved overall build performance by <a href="https://v2.parceljs.org/blog/beta3/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">up to 10x</a> with SWC.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Parcel uses SWC like a library. Before we used Babel's parser and custom transforms written in JS. Now, we use SWC's parser and <a href="https://github.com/parcel-bundler/parcel/tree/v2/packages/transformers/js/core/src" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">custom transforms in Rust</a>. This includes a full scope hoisting implementation, dependency collection, and more. It's similar in scope to how Deno built on top of SWC. – <a href="https://twitter.com/devongovett" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Devon Govett</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's early days for Rust – a few important pieces are still being figured out:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Plugins:</strong> Writing plugins in Rust isn't as approachable for many JavaScript developers. At the same time, exposing a plugin system in JavaScript could negate performance gains. A definitive solution hasn't emerged yet. Ideally, the future combines both JavaScript and Rust. If you want to write a plugin with JavaScript, it's possible with a tradeoff for speed. Need more performance? Use the Rust plugin API.</li>
<li><strong>Bundling:</strong> One interesting area of development is <code><span><span>swcpack</span></span></code>, which is SWC's replacement for Webpack. It's still under development but could be very promising.</li>
<li><strong>WebAssembly:</strong> As mentioned above, the prospect of writing Rust and compiling to WASM is enticing, but there's still work to be done.</li>
</ul>
<p>Regardless, I'm confident Rust will continue to have a major impact on the JavaScript ecosystem for the next 1-2 years and into the future. Imagine a world where all of the build tools used in Next.js are written in Rust, giving you optimal performance. Then, Next.js could be distributed as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_build" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">static binary</a> you'd download from NPM.</p>
<p>That's the world I want to live (and develop) in.</p>
<h2>Update: 2023</h2>
<p>Since this post was written in 2021, there's been even more investment into new Rust tooling in the JavaScript ecosystem. A few notable Rust projects include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://biomejs.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Biome</a></strong>: Rome, previously mentioned in this post, has became Biome</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.rspack.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rspack</a></strong>: New bundler with webpack compat</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://github.com/pnpm/pacquet" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pacquet (pnpm)</a></strong>: Experimental package manager for Node.js</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://twitter.com/youyuxi/status/1709943106215530867" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rolldown</a></strong>: New bundler for Vite (replacing esbuild and rollup)</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://github.com/oxc-project/oxc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Oxc</a></strong>: Similar to Biome: parser, linter, formatter, transpiler, minifier, etc</li>

<li><strong><a href="https://lightningcss.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lightning CSS</a></strong>: New CSS parser, transformer, bunder, and minifier.</li>
</ul>
<p>Further, <a href="https://bun.sh/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bun 1.0</a> was released, putting Zig on the map and working to speed up the entire JavaScript ecosystem.</p></div></div>]]></description>

            </div><p>Johann Hari says in <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/57933306-stolen-focus" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Stolen Focus</a> that rats and pigeons can be manipulated as we want. Just give them food whenever they do what you want them to. And shortly after, they will repeat that over and over again.</p>
<p>This made me think. In times when Instagram and other apps give us likes, hearts, and views on things we post, how much does big tech influence our behavior?</p>
<p>Aren’t they the same as the researcher, feeding us with dopamine to tell us to do what they want? Are they doing the same as the researcher who feeds the rats or pigeons?</p>
<p>This question, and recent improvements and tinkering with my flow as I started working for myself, made me ask how we can control the addiction and the influence and find a better way to slow living.</p>
<h2 id="the-artists-way">The Artist’s Way</h2>
<p>Johann continues that people who don’t follow the above dopamine flow are artists and painters.</p>
<p>Instead of sharing or selling them immediately and getting rewarded, they draw the next one. The drawing, the way to the end, is the reward, not the likes or selling the art. After hundreds of interviews, <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mihaly_Csikszentmihalyi" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi</a> said all artists mentioned something like a Flow State. <strong>It’s magical</strong> that they just tried to be there.</p>
<p>This is also what I find most rewarding and experienced as an author: writing in the flow state, as I’m writing these words right now when I am merely in control, but the words flow out of my fingers. I guide them, but I do not write or choose the words.</p>
<p>This flow and the outcome of what the article looks like after are just magical.</p>
<h2 id="environments-matter">Environments Matter</h2>
<p>I have rediscovered the effects of the environment lately when working for myself when I had to find productivity in my everyday work without a boss telling me what to do. At home, I wasn’t always focused enough. I had all the distractions. Going to the library usually produces my best work.  Focused without distractions. But always going there, sometimes it’s open late, or closed. Another great way to write and be creative is to use coffee shops, specifically <strong>moving to the next every 1.5 to 2.5 hours</strong>. It’s the sweet spot for me between being creative and getting distracted. And interestingly enough, the same for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/cgpgrey" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">CGP Grey</a> in his <a href="https://share.snipd.com/episode/6d03cf6a-1744-412d-a158-57aef1097f5b" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Redundant Office</a> podcast, he said the same.</p>
<p>Music, especially non-vocal music on repeat or dedicated <a href="https://www.ssp.sh/brain/music-that-keeps-you-focused/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Music that keeps you focused</a>, helps you stay in the flow longer. It’s another way of signaling an environment to the brain, like “Now is work time”. I also use a dedicated browser; for example, I use Zen browser for work and Brave for everything else. Zen, the work browser, has no extensions. No password manager to automatically log in and no history to quickly choose the latest website distraction. These little obstacles make it harder to distract, whereas my Brave has all the convenience at one tab away.</p>
<p>Another huge benefit of my writing work is that all my files are offline in my <a href="https://www.ssp.sh/brain/obsidian" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Obsidian</a> Vault. No need to go online or log in to a web app to get going. It’s just there to start writing, brainstorming, and getting into the flow. Another way to stay in the flow is to use Markdown files and <a href="https://www.ssp.sh/brain/vim-language-and-motions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Vim motions</a>. The Markdown files are simple text files that can be easily accessed and moved around. The key here is that the text’s formatting allows me to move and restructure entire chapters or ideas without friction. Adding the vim motions, I can do everything in the comfort of my keyboard. As I use them daily, they are muscle memory, and I can write at the speed of thought.</p>
<div>
        <p><i></i>Second Brain<i></i></p>
        <div>
            <p><a href="https://brain.ssp.sh/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">My second brain</a>, offline notes in my Obsidian vault, allows me to create connections, observe the graph, and see connected or relevant notes that could influence my thinking on the topic I am writing. A note on a book I wrote 10 years ago, with some insight that didn’t touch much back then, but connected to the current thought, with more knowledge, can make all the difference.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
<h2 id="breaks">Breaks</h2>
<p>One crucial ingredient that is mostly overlooked is breaks. Small drinking breaks and walking around as observed with the 1.5-2.5h sweet spot. But much more, long periods off, vacations where you don’t think of work or related. Your brain has time to wander. Good sleep to a certain extent is also a form of break. The more we learn about sleep (see <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/55587034-why-we-sleep-unlocking-the-power-of-sleep-and-dreams" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Why We Sleep by Matthew Walker</a>), the more prevalent it is how important it is. I also notice to myself. If I sleep, the chances of being productive in the morning, achieving my goals early, and getting a sense of calm throughout the rest of my day are much higher. As we process primarily during sleep, especially with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapid_eye_movement_sleep" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">REM (Rapid Eye Movement)</a> sleep that we usually get only after sleeping for 7-8 hours, is where the brain is cleansing itself, and making it ready for the next day.</p>
<p>I am on vacation writing this article, and I haven’t written for a couple of days. I am enjoying time on vacation, nature, and with family, letting my brain drift and follow its thoughts. These ideas, connections, and words basically flow themselves, as my brain is super relaxed. While being offline and taking a break, the brain makes sense of things in the subconscious.</p>
<div>
        <p><i></i>There Are Different Kinds of Rest<i></i></p>
        <div><p>To unblock, you can unblock or rest in different types of rest:</p>
<ul>
<li>Physical Rest</li>
<li>Mental Rest</li>
<li>Creative Rest</li>
<li>Emotional Rest</li>
<li>Social Rest</li>
<li>Spiritual rest</li>
<li>Sensory Rest</li>
</ul>

</div>
    </div>
<h3 id="mini-retirements">Mini Retirements</h3>
<p>Another way of taking breaks is small <strong>mini-retirements</strong>. I explored these in my <a href="https://www.ssp.sh/brain/pathless-path/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Pathless Path</a>. These are like Sabbaticals. I did many of these early in my life, and they heavily influenced who I am today and how my life unfolded. But more on this in <a href="https://ssp.sh/blog/finding-my-pathless-path/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Finding My Pathless Path</a>.</p>
<h2 id="slowing-down-slow-living">Slowing down, Slow Living</h2>
<p>Slowing down, and just <strong>slow living</strong>, is another essential concept. Slowing down, being more present. As Cal Newport says in his book <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/197773418-slow-productivity" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Slow Productivity</a>, his main points are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Do fewer things.</li>
<li>Work at a natural pace.</li>
<li>Obsess over quality."</li>
</ol>
<p>If we apply this to life, we get a <a href="https://www.ssp.sh/brain/deep-life" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Deeper Life</a>. One that is more fulfilled and present. It is about finding the balance between the important and the urgent.</p>
<p>Turning off the phone, without the pressure or the urge to check if someone has messaged you, if you got a like on social media, your brain starts wondering. You start getting ideas and thoughts to ponder. But these don’t start immediately. If you have been distracted, living a fast life, are constantly on the go, and have no time to think about anything, without defined <a href="https://www.ssp.sh/brain/principles" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">principles</a> to work towards, without <a href="https://www.ssp.sh/brain/clarity/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">clarity</a>, your brain can’t just switch, and be <strong>deeply focused</strong>. But practicing it, like meditation or yoga, is undoubtedly worth it.</p>
<div>
        <p><i></i>Digital Minimalism<i></i></p>
        <div>
            <p>Another book by Cal Newport is Digital Minimalism, which goes in the same direction—trying to use fewer digital mediums, less social media, and less distraction. I thoroughly recommend it, too.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
<div>
        <p><i></i>The basics: Food, Sleep, and Smartphones<i></i></p>
        <div>
            <p>The basis on top of these, is also a good sleep, nutritious food. And the phone needs to be away on do not disturb mode, or best in another room.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
<h3 id="shallow-vs-deep-happiness">Shallow vs. Deep Happiness</h3>
<p>These can also be summarized into what I call shallow happiness versus deep happiness. Buying something new, eating fast food, having another coffee, or watching a YouTube video all give us pleasure, but only in the <strong>short term</strong>. Writing an article or learning something hard, like coding or vim motions, is initially hard. But the reward is long-term. We get <strong>deep satisfaction</strong> from being in the flow and perfecting something we have learned and perfected over a long time.</p>
<p>Maybe that’s the secret of a <a href="https://www.ssp.sh/brain/deep-life" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Deep Life</a>? Not reading news, journaling, praying, meditating, or following a Stoic practice. Reading books is a similar thing; it’s hard to listen to or read an entire book, but when we do, especially if we learn something new, without distractions, in a format the author spent a year or more to curate and put into its format, is so calming and almost peaceful. In fact,  <strong>reading a book</strong> is known to be the biggest and most common version of flow.</p>
<p>There’s much more to dig into, which I might in another article about “Why we are here on earth?”. This article has been cooking over many months and years already. It will go much deeper and more philosophical about why we even do what we do. It will be connected and even strengthen the flow more if we have clear principles, a clear path, and a passion for why we do something.</p>
<p>But now, instead, I want to focus on how to get into a flow state or how to unblock us when we feel stressed and not in the mood to do the <a href="https://www.ssp.sh/brain/deep-work" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Deep Work</a>. If we easily get distracted.</p>
<p>These are all based on personal experience and books I read. They don’t always work, but one variation usually does the trick by iterating on them.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="getting-back-to-focus">Getting Back to Focus</h2>
<p>These are more pointers related to this article’s topic, thoughts, or steps I followed, some of which are already on my <a href="https://brain.ssp.sh/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Second Brain</a>.</p>
<h3 id="how-to-get-focused">How to Get Focused</h3>
<p>Walk every day; nature is tiding our thoughts, just like naps and sleep. Walking, or going outside, is suitable for mental, spiritual, and physical health. When I start walking, the ideas flow, my brain calms down, and I slowly begin to think and process anything I am pondering. It’s best when done in <strong>nature</strong>. Nature in itself is a remedy for calming down. It has helped all the big thinkers before our time and will help many after ours.</p>
<p>Like our inner monkeys or daemons, they don’t want us to go out of bed or get fresh air. Walking frees us from them—the opposite of what social media or smartphones do.</p>
<div>
        <p><i></i>Pro Tip<i></i></p>
        <div>
            <p>Sometimes, bring a paper notebook or camera to capture ideas or thoughts. But other times, go deliberately without.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
<h3 id="strategies-to-unblock">Strategies to Unblock</h3>
<p>Try to change the medium. If writing on a computer does not work, try pen or paper. Or try talking. As Jonny Miller said:</p>
<blockquote>There is no talking block, only writer's block.</blockquote>
<p>Interestingly, if we change the medium, we can unblock it:</p>
<ul>
<li>Take a walk in nature.</li>
<li>Change environment, physically as well as digitally:
<ul>
<li><strong>Physical</strong>: Go to another room, a coffee shop, or what works best for me, Libraries.</li>
<li><strong>Digital</strong>: Also, changing your computer environment, e.g., changing from dark to light mode or changing the theme, can give you a sense of change and fresh energy.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Listen to the same playlist repeatedly, and use <a href="https://www.ssp.sh/brain/music-that-keeps-you-focused/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Music that keeps you focused</a>.</li>
<li>Timebox yourself, also called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Pomodoro Technique</a>. It has the same effect and works in the train with only the battery. The urge to finish before you run out of battery will give you focus and added clarity.</li>
<li>Change between Text and Visual: I use a lot of MindMap on paper, but <a href="https://obsidian.md/canvas" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Obsidian Canvas</a>, Draw with ExaliDraw, and others work as well.</li>
<li>Go forth and back the pendulum with <a href="https://www.ssp.sh/brain/creativity-vs-productivity" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Creativity vs Productivity</a>.</li>
<li>Try to get into the same habit when working (same place, same music, etc.). Your brain will know it needs to write before you even start.
<ul>
<li>Check <a href="https://youtu.be/snAhsXyO3Ck?feature=shared" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Spaceship You</a> by CGP Grey, showcasing how designated space helped during the pandemic, but also for clarity.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://www.ssp.sh/brain/pregame-routine/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Pre–Game Routine</a> by James Clear can help as well.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://www.ssp.sh/brain/journaling/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Journaling</a> for a while.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="how-i-get-into-deep-work--flow">How I get into Deep Work — Flow</h3>
<p>The above strategies to unblock are also related to <a href="https://www.ssp.sh/brain/deep-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Deep Work</a> and how I get into deep work:</p>
<ol>
<li>Journal before bed what 1-2 tasks you must/want to achieve tomorrow.</li>
<li>Go to bed early (you usually don’t achieve much at night).</li>
<li>Have a good sleep.</li>
<li>Get up before the kids :) (don’t turn on the phone).</li>
<li>Make your bed.</li>
<li>Later, take a walk in nature.</li>
<li>Change environment/room if stuck.</li>
</ol>
<p>Others:</p>
<ul>
<li>Clear some time in your calendar.</li>
<li>Get rid of distractions: Turn off notifications, close Slack, and put your phone out of reach.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Clear your space and your mind. Put on concentration music, and get rid of any clutter around.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Get to work on a specific task, taking periodic short breaks.</li>
<li>Deeper: Acknowledge your fears, write from authenticity and a place of <strong>truth</strong>.
<ul>
<li><strong>Truth</strong> is stored in our body (not in our mind)</li>
<li><strong>Emotions</strong> are like a GPS, help us to find truth and navigate around</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://www.ssp.sh/brain/two-minutes-rules/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Two Minutes Rules</a> to do it for at least two minutes</li>
<li><a href="https://www.ssp.sh/brain/routines-such-as-sports-or-meditation" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Meditation</a> or doing nothing for 5 minutes</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, like <em>creative block</em>, add boundaries and constraints like no internet, use another browser for searching the web, and suddenly ideas flow. Unlimited freedom is super-blocking, especially for creativity. Great read on the topic: <a href="https://sashachapin.substack.com/p/if-you-have-writers-block-maybe-you" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">If You Have Writer’s Block, Maybe You Should Stop Lying</a>.</p>
<div>
        <p><i></i>I Do Nothing<i></i></p>
        <div>
            <p>When I don’t have inspiration or I have a block, I do nothing. <strong>I live</strong>. And it’s absolutely because of the deeper inspiration that I’m blessed to feel. I feel it’s been cultivated. I’m connected to it, and I know it’s real, and it doesn’t have to greet me every day. I know it’s there.—<strong>Jon Batiste</strong></p>
        </div>
    </div>
<h3 id="turn-off-shut-down-and-re-energize-for-a-happy-life">Turn Off, Shut Down, and Re-Energize for a Happy Life</h3>
<p>Something that is easy to say but hard to do. I enjoy <strong>walks in nature</strong> or a long bicycle ride. It does not matter what you do, but that you do something without distraction. I was listening to books on the walks for a long time, but this always felt like more work. Sure, if you have a great book, listening can be fun too, but I did my best to calm down when going without any decision—just me and nature.</p>
<p>From the book “The Well-Lived Life: A 102-Year-Old Doctor’s Six Secrets to Health and Happiness at Every Age”, a <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/62918481-the-well-lived-life" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">comment</a> by Liong on Goodreads says the six secrets may help us live a <strong>long, happy, and healthy life</strong>:</p>
<ol>
<li>Let go of the past (Forget the past regrets and anger).</li>
<li>Live in the present moment. (Live now; don’t stay in your history and worry about your future).</li>
<li>Connect with nature. (Read and find out yourself).</li>
<li>Eat a healthy diet. (Choose and be aware of what you eat daily).</li>
<li>Get regular exercise. (Try exercise every day).</li>
<li>Find your purpose. (Having a purpose is vital to living longer).</li>
</ol>
<p>Be grateful now. Help others. Have fun—also, more on my note on <a href="https://www.ssp.sh/brain/what-makes-a-happy-life/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">What Makes a Happy Life</a>.</p>
<h3 id="nature-how-it-flourishes-creativity">Nature: How It Flourishes Creativity</h3>
<p>Take inspiration from nature. Nature is so powerful.</p>
<p>For example, watching a tree through the four seasons: In summer, it is green with many leaves; in autumn, it loses them all; in winter, it looks dead. But instead, it builds and prepares its strength for the spring. Where the colorful flowers sprout, it’s calming and inspiring.</p>
<p>Take gardening; it takes so much patience to grow those three. It puts time into different perspectives. Threes <strong>outlive</strong> houses and plants are harvested over many years. If you sell a home, things might have been there long before the house.</p>
<p>I like to get inspiration from nature. I think of my <strong>creative process as gardening</strong>. Things inside us build up <strong>slowly</strong>, but great things will come out with constant nurturing: Art, a thought, an idea, anything. It doesn’t matter which day. It’s seasonal, similar to creativity; we can’t be creative all year.</p>
<p>I hope any of these helped you; more so, it helped me to clarify focus in connection with the ever-growing (primarily digital) distractions to find a better life worth living—A slower and deeper life could be possible.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>





<p>I’ve been seriously traveling for more than 50 years, and I’ve learned a lot.</p>



<p>I’ve traveled solo, and I’ve led a tour group of 40 friends. I’ve slept in dormitories and I’ve stayed in presidential suites with a butler. I’ve hitchhiked penniless for months, and I’ve flown by private jet. I’ve traveled months with siblings, and with total strangers. I’ve gone by slow boat and I’ve ridden my bicycle across America, twice. I’ve been to the largest gathering of humans on the planet, and trekked into remotest areas on the planet on my own. I’ve paid for luxury tours, and I’ve done my own self-guided tours. I regularly travel for business, and once I went to Hawaii on a door-prize award. I’ve circumnavigated the globe in only 48 hours, and I traveled uninterrupted for 9 months. I’ve gone first class and third class, sometimes on the same trip. So far I’ve visited half the world’s countries, and usually manage to get far from the capital city when I do. Here is what I know about how to travel.</p>



<p>There are two modes of travel; retreat or engage. People often travel to escape the routines of work, to recharge, relax, reinvigorate, and replenish themselves— R&amp;R. In this mode you travel to remove yourself from your routines, or to get the pampering and attention you don’t ordinarily get, and ideally to do fun things instead of work things. So you travel to where it is easy. This is called a vacation, or R&amp;R.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The other mode is engagement and experience, or E&amp;E. In this mode you travel to discover new things, to have new experiences, to lean into an adventure whose outcome is not certain, to meet otherness. You move to find yourself by encountering pleasures and challenges you don’t encounter at home. This kind of travel is a type of learning, and of the two modes, it is the one I favor in these tips.</p>



<p>***********</p>



<p>Organize your travel around passions instead of destinations. An itinerary based on obscure cheeses, or naval history, or dinosaur digs, or jazz joints will lead to far more adventures, and memorable times than a grand tour of famous places. It doesn’t even have to be your passions; it could be a friend’s, family member’s, or even one you’ve read about. The point is to get away from the expected into the unexpected.</p>



<p>• </p>



<p>If you hire a driver, or use a taxi, offer to pay the driver to take you to visit their mother. They will ordinarily jump at the chance. They fulfill their filial duty and you will get easy entry into a local’s home, and a very high chance to taste some home cooking. Mother, driver, and you leave happy. This trick rarely fails.</p>



<p>• </p>



<p>Make no assumptions about whether something will be open. There are other norms at work. If possible check at the last minute, if not, have a plan B.</p>



<p>• </p>



<p>Crash a wedding. You are not a nuisance; you are the celebrity guest! The easiest way to do this is to find the local wedding hall where weddings happen on schedule and approach a wedding party with a request to attend. They will usually feel honored. You can offer the newlyweds a small token gift of cash if you want. You will be obliged to dance. Take photos of them; they will take photos of you. It will make your day and theirs. (I’ve crashed a wedding in most of the countries I have visited.)</p>



<p>• </p>



<p>Don’t balk at the spendy price of admission for a museum or performance. It will be a tiny fraction of your trip’s total cost and you invested too much and have come too far to let those relative minor fees stop you from seeing what you came to see.</p>



<p>• </p>



<p>Google maps will give you very detailed and reliable directions for taking public transit, including where to make transfers in most cities.</p>



<p>• </p>



<p>When visiting a foreign city for the first time, take a street food tour. Depending on the region, the tour will include food carts, food trucks, food courts, or smaller eateries. It will last a few hours, and the cost will include the food. You’ll get some of the best food available, and usually the host will also deliver a great introduction to the culture. Google “street food tour for city X.”</p>



<p>• </p>



<p>The most significant criteria to use when selecting travel companions is: do they complain or not, even when complaints are justified? No complaining! Complaints are for the debriefing afterwards when travel is over.</p>



<p>• </p>



<p>As in any art, constraints breed creativity. Give your travel creative constraints: Try traveling by bicycle, or with only a day bag for luggage, or below the minimum budget, or sleep only on overnight trains. Mix it up. Even vagabonding can become a rut.</p>



<p>• </p>



<p>Renting a car is easier than ever today, even in developing countries, and oftentimes the best bet for getting around if you are headed for many places outside of cities. It is an option worth considering, especially if you are 2 to 3 people traveling. On the other hand, there are still plenty of places where you don’t want to drive because of chaotic roads, lawless attitudes, and unfavorable liabilities. In those places hiring a driver plus car for a multi-day trip is often a surprisingly appealing bargain—especially if you have 2 to 3 people to split the costs. The total could be less than taking trains and taxis, and you get door to door service, and often a built-in guide who knows the local roads and also local festivities and best places to eat. They will be at least 2x the cost of renting a car, but for some kinds of travel 2x as good. If you are a spontaneous traveler, a hired driver is by far the best option allowing you to change your itinerary immediately as mood, weather, or lucky timing dictate. I usually find drivers by searching travel forums for recommendations. I score candidates primarily by their communication skills.</p>



<p>• </p>



<p>If you are fortunate, a fantastic way to share your fortune is to gift a friend the cost of travel with you. You both will have a great time.</p>



<p>• </p>



<p>Go to a cemetery. Look for sacred places. People live authentically there. Don’t just visit the markets, but also go to small workshops, hardware stores and pharmacies –&nbsp; places with easy access to local practices. See how it’s different and the same all at once.</p>



<p>• </p>



<p><a href="https://www.flightaware.com/">FlightAware</a> is the best free phone app for the status of your flight. It will often tell you about delays hours before the airline will. Tip: use FlightAware to check whether your plane has even arrived at your departure airport.</p>



<p>• </p>



<p>Sketchy travel plans and travel to sketchy places are ok. Take a chance. If things fall apart, your vacation has just turned into an adventure. Perfection is for watches. Trips should be imperfect. There are no stories if nothing goes amiss.&nbsp;</p>



<p>• </p>



<p>Your enjoyment of a trip will be inversely related to the weight of your luggage. Counterintuitively, the longer your trip, the less stuff you should haul. Travelers still happy on a 6-week trip will only have carry-on luggage. That maximizes your flexibility, enabling you to lug luggage up stairs when there is no elevator, or to share a tuk-tuk, to pack and unpack efficiently, and to not lose stuff. Furthermore, when you go light you intentionally reduce what you take in order to increase your experience of living. And the reality of today is that you can almost certainly buy whatever you are missing on the road.</p>



<p>• </p>



<p>Getting an inside tour is the ultimate travel treat. How about a factory tour, a visit to an Amish home, or backstage at an opera? When I travel for business I will sometimes ask for inside access to an uncommon place in lieu of a speaking fee. You are aiming for experiences that simple money can’t buy. Good ones will take planning ahead.</p>



<p>• </p>



<p>It is always colder at night than you think it should be, especially in the tropics. Pack a layer no matter what.</p>



<p>• </p>



<p>Planning your itinerary: You want to see it all and you are likely to never return, so the temptation is to pile it on, maximize your visit. Since we are in X, and Y and Z&nbsp; are so close, we might as well see Y and Z….. Paradoxically when you are traveling you should minimize the amount of time you spend in transit—once you arrive. The hard-to-accept truth is that it is far better to spend more time in a few places than a little time in a bunch of places.&nbsp;</p>



<p>• </p>



<p>To book a train anywhere in the world outside your home country, your first stop should be <a href="https://www.seat61.com/">The Man in Seat 61</a>, a sprawling website which will conveniently help you book the train you want.&nbsp;</p>



<p>• </p>



<p>In 53 years of travelling with all kinds of people, I’ve seen absolutely no correlation between where you eat and whether you have intestinal problems, so to maximize the enjoyment of local foods, my rule of thumb is to eat wherever healthy-looking locals eat.</p>



<p>• </p>



<p>The list of most coveted cities to visit have one striking thing in common—they are pedestrian centric. They reward walking.<strong> </strong>Better online hotel sites like<a href="http://booking.com/"> Booking.com</a> have map interfaces which allow you to select hotels by their location. Whenever possible I book my hotel near to where it is best to walk, so I can stroll out the door and begin to wander.&nbsp;</p>



<p>• </p>



<p>For a truly memorable trip, go without reservations, just winging it along the way. If you like somewhere, stay a day longer, or if you don’t, split a day earlier. If the train is full, take a bus. That freedom can be liberating.</p>



<p>• </p>



<p>The <a href="https://apps.apple.com/tr/app/google-translate/id414706506">Google Translate app</a> for your phone is seriously good, and free. It will translate voice, text, or script to and from 250 languages. Use for deciphering menus, signs, talking with clerks, etc. It is often a lifesaver.</p>



<p>• </p>



<p>Large-scale luxury cruises have no appeal to me, yet a small boat cruise is an entirely different species and a valid option worth considering. The advantage of a cruise is that your hotel travels with you, so you unpack only once. It is especially useful for small groups because it eliminates the eternal negotiation of deciding where to eat. (You always eat on the boat.) The advantages of a small boat cruise over a huge boat are several: you disembark very quickly, very often, at smaller more intimate places than large boats can do. And the options for activities are more active than just shopping: such as snorkeling, kayaking, bicycling, hiking, visiting local families and communities. Overall you spend far more time doing things off the boat than on. I define a small boat as 40 passengers or fewer. The per day cost is high, but almost every minute of it is quality time, unlike a series of bus rides. Examples of places I’ve loved a small boat cruise; The Galapagos, Alaska inland passageway, Mekong River, Coast of Turkey, and Kerala, India.</p>



<p>• </p>



<p>The rate you go is not determined by how fast you walk, bike or drive, but by how long your breaks are. Slow down. Take lots of breaks. The most memorable moments—conversations with amazing strangers, an invite inside, a hidden artwork—will usually happen when you are not moving.</p>



<p>• </p>



<p>I generally find “professional” tour guides uninteresting, and too scripted. They are mostly repeating what can be found in guide books. So I rarely hire them. I much prefer to have a friend or local acquaintance show me what interests them in an ad hoc way, with no script. Let friends know you are coming to their area.</p>



<p>• </p>



<p>A few <a href="https://amzn.to/4gKbKAV">laundry detergent sheets</a> in a tiny ziplock bag weigh nothing and won’t spill and are perfect for emergency laundry washing in the sink or shower.&nbsp;</p>



<p>• </p>



<p>These days it is mandatory that you are connected. You need cell coverage as well as wifi. You’ll want robust mobile coverage for navigation, translation apps, ride shares and a digital wallet for payments. Best option is to use a carrier with “free” international plans (such as T-Mobile or <a href="https://fi.google.com/about/">Google Fi</a>) so you need to do nothing. Second best is to get either a sim card or e-sim for your phone for your visiting country. E-sim apps (such <a href="https://www.airalo.com/">Airalo</a>) can be loaded by yourself virtually. Sims and e-sims are also sold at most international airports when you exit. Most are reputable. One tip, turn off your photo and video cloud backup while on the sim to reduce data usage.&nbsp;</p>



<p>• </p>



<p>People in other places are not saints. You might get cheated, swindled, or taken advantage of. Paradoxically, the best way to avoid that is to give strangers your trust and treat them well. Being good to them brings out their good. If you are on your best behavior, they will be on their best behavior. And vice versa. To stay safe, smile. Be humble and minimize your ego. I don’t know why that works everywhere in the world—even places with “bad” reputations—but it does.</p>



<p>• </p>



<p>You can get an inexpensive and authentic meal near a famous tourist spot simply by walking at least five blocks away from the epicenter.&nbsp;</p>



<p>• </p>



<p>Digital wallets on your phone are displacing local currencies in many places. For instance I did not use any cash on my last trips to the UK and China. And in places where it has not completely eliminated cash you can reduce your cash needs by half with mobile payments. Set up your Apple pay, Google Pay or Alipay before you leave. There is no need to exchange money anywhere, especially at airports. Get any cash you need at local ATMs, which are now everywhere. Use a card that does not charge, or reimburses, a foreign fee.&nbsp;</p>



<p>• </p>



<p>If you detect slightly more people moving in one direction over another, follow them. If you keep following this “gradient” of human movement, you will eventually land on something interesting—a market, a parade, a birthday party, an outdoor dance, a festival.&nbsp;</p>



<p>• </p>



<p>Splurge in getting the most recent version of a guidebook to your destination. It is worth the price of a lunch to get the latest, most helpful, reliable information. I supplement the latest guidebook research with recommendations suggested in travel forums online. Guidebooks have depth and breadth, while forums offer speed—results from a week ago.&nbsp;</p>



<p>• </p>



<p>If you are starting out and have seen little of the world, you can double the time you spend traveling by heading to the places it is cheapest to travel. If you stay at the budget end, you can travel twice as long for half price. Check out <a href="https://www.cheapestdestinationsblog.com/">The Cheapest Destination Blog</a>. In my experience, these off-beat destinations are usually worth visiting.</p>



<p>• </p>



<p>In many parts of the world today motorcycles play the role of cars. That means you can hire a moto-taxi to take you on the back seat, or to summon a moto-taxi with an uber-like app, or to take a motorcycle tour with a guide doing the driving. In areas where motorcycles dominate they will be ten times more efficient than slowly going by car.</p>



<p>• </p>



<p>Put inexpensive <a href="https://amzn.to/4hxt9y4">Apple AirTags</a> into your bags, so you can track them when they are out of your sight. More and more airlines are integrating AirTags into their system to help find wayward bags. The tags work for luggage left in hotel storage, or stashed beneath the bus, or pieces you need to forward.&nbsp;</p>



<p>• </p>



<p>For the best travel experiences you need either a lot of money, or a lot of time. Of the two modes, it is far better to have more time than money. Although it tries, money cannot buy what time delivers. You have enough time to attend the rare festival, to learn some new words, to understand what the real prices are, to wait out the weather, or to get to that place that takes a week in a jeep. Time is the one resource you can give yourself, so take advantage of this if you are young without money.</p>



<p>• </p>



<p>Being beautiful, or well crafted, or cheap is not enough for a souvenir. It should have some meaning from the trip. A good question you may want to ask yourself when buying a souvenir is where will this live when I get home?</p>



<p>• </p>



<p>The best souvenirs from a trip are your memories of the trip so find a way to memorialize them; keep a journal, send updates to a friend, take a sketchbook, post some observations, make a photo book.&nbsp;</p>



<p>• </p>



<p>When asking someone for a restaurant recommendation, don’t ask them where is a good place you should eat; ask them where they eat. Where did they eat the last time they ate out?</p>



<p>• </p>



<p>Here in brief is the method I’ve honed to optimize a two-week vacation: When you arrive in a new country, immediately proceed to the farthest, most remote, most distant place you intend to reach during the trip. If there is a small village, remote spa, a friend’s farm, or a wild place you plan on seeing on the trip, go there immediately. Do not stop near the airport. Do not rest overnight in the arrival city. Do not pause to acclimate. If at all possible proceed by plane, bus, jeep, car directly to the furthest point without interruption. Make it an overnight journey if you have to. Then once you reach your furthest point, unpack, explore, and work your way slowly back to the big city, wherever your international departure airport is.</p>



<p>In other words you make a laser-straight rush for the end, and then meander back. Laser out, meander back. This method is somewhat contrary to many people’s first instincts, which are to immediately get acclimated to the culture in the landing city before proceeding to the hinterlands. The thinking is: get a sense of what’s going on, stock up, size up the joint. Then slowly work up to the more challenging, more remote areas. That’s reasonable, but not optimal because most big cities around the world are more similar than different. All big cities these days feel same-same on first arrival. In Laser-Back travel what happens is that you are immediately thrown into Very Different Otherness, the maximum difference that you will get on this trip. You go from your home to extreme differences so fast it is almost like the dissolve effect in a slide show. Bam! Your eyes are wide open. You are on your toes. All ears. And there at the end of the road (but your beginning), your inevitable mistakes are usually cheaper, easier to recover from, and more fun. You take it slower, no matter what country you are in. Then you use the allotted time to head back to the airport city, at whatever pace is your pace. But, when you arrive in the city after a week or so traveling in this strangeness, and maybe without many of the luxuries you are used to, you suddenly see the city the same way the other folks around you do. After eight days in less fancy digs, the bright lights, and smooth shopping streets, and late-night eateries dazzle you, and you embrace the city with warmth and eagerness. It all seems so … civilized and ingenious. It’s brilliant! The hustle and bustle are less annoying and almost welcomed. And the attractions you notice are the small details that natives appreciate. You see the city more like a native and less like a jaded tourist in a look-alike urban mall. You leave having enjoyed both the remote and the adjacent, the old and new, the slow and the fast, the small and the big. </p>



<p>We’ve also learned that this intensity works best if we aim for 12 days away from home. That means 10 days for in-country experience, plus a travel day (or two) on each end. We’ve found from doing this many times, with many travelers of all ages and interests, 14 days on the ground is two days too many. There seems to be a natural lull at about 10 days of intense kinetic travel. People start to tune out a bit. So we cut it there and use the other days to come and go and soften the transitions. On the other hand 8 days feels like the momentum is cut short. So 10 days of intensity, and 12 days in a country is what we aim for. Laser-back travel is not foolproof, nor always possible, but on average it tends to work better than the other ways I’ve tried.</p>

			<span>Total</span></p></div>   </div> <div><p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Based on spending in the 2024 fiscal year.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p></div> </figure><p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->In the 2024 fiscal year, the N.I.H. spent at least $32 billion on nearly 60,000 grants, including medical research in areas like cancer, genetics and infectious disease. Of that, $23 billion went to “direct” research costs, such as microscopes and researchers’ salaries, according to an Upshot analysis of <a href="https://report.nih.gov/award/index.cfm?ot=&amp;fy=2024">N.I.H. grant data</a>.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --> </p><p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->The other $9 billion went to the institutions’ overhead, or “indirect costs,” which can include laboratory upkeep, utility bills, administrative staff and access to hazardous materials disposal, all of which research institutions say is essential to making research possible.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --> </p><p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->The <a href="https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-25-068.html">N.I.H. proposal</a>, which has been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/11/health/nih-research-funding-lawsuit-injunction.html">put on hold by a federal court</a>, aims to reduce funding for those indirect costs to a set 15 percent rate that the administration says would save <a href="https://x.com/NIH/status/1888004759396958263">about $4 billion a year</a>. The Upshot analysis estimates that a 15 percent rate would have reduced funding for the grants that received N.I.H. support in 2024 by at least $5 billion. The White House said the savings would be reinvested in more research, but the rate cuts would open up sizable budget holes in most projects at research institutions.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --> </p><p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->It is not clear whether those organizations can fill the gaps with other funding sources or by shifting how they apply for grants. Instead, many officials at universities and hospitals have said that they may have to pull back on medical or scientific research.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --> </p><p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->“It’s not an overstatement to say that a slash this drastic in total research funding slows research,” said Heather Pierce, senior director for science policy at the Association of American Medical Colleges, which has <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.mad.280609/gov.uscourts.mad.280609.1.0.pdf">sued along with other education and hospital associations</a> to block the policy. And slower scientific progress, she said, would affect anyone who depends on the development of new treatments, medical interventions and diagnostic tools.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --> </p><p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->We estimate that virtually all universities and hospitals would see fewer funds on similar projects in the future. The 10 institutions that receive the most money from N.I.H. stand to lose more than $100 million per year on average.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --> </p><p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->To understand how the change would work, let’s look at <a href="https://reporter.nih.gov/search/JbRgAtchAUKHOoW2X1vObQ/projects/map/project-details/10821480">one grant for about $600,000</a> sent last year to the University of Alabama at Birmingham to study whether exercise can improve memory for people with epilepsy.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --> </p><figure>  <div>  <svelte-scrollstory id="g-scrollstory_1">    <svelte-scroller-outer><svelte-scroller-background-container><svelte-scroller-background><svelte-scrollstory-background slot="background"> </svelte-scrollstory-background></svelte-scroller-background></svelte-scroller-background-container> <svelte-scroller-foreground><svelte-scrollstory-foreground slot="foreground"><div>  <div id="g-scrollstory_1-item-0"><p><span><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->The N.I.H. sent the university this funding in the 2024 fiscal year, as part of a multiyear grant.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --> </span></p>  </div><div id="g-scrollstory_1-item-1"><p><span><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->A majority of the money went to <strong>direct costs</strong> associated with the study.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --> </span></p>  </div><div id="g-scrollstory_1-item-2"><p><span><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->And an additional 45 percent went to <strong>indirect costs </strong>supporting the research, like building maintenance and administrative staff.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --> </span></p>  </div><div id="g-scrollstory_1-item-3"><p><span><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Under the new rules, the university would receive <strong>a 15 percent rate</strong> on such grants, bringing the total down.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --> </span></p>  </div><div id="g-scrollstory_1-item-4"><p><span><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->That would have been a funding loss of nearly $130,000 on this project alone.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --> </span></p>  </div> </div></svelte-scrollstory-foreground></svelte-scroller-foreground> </svelte-scroller-outer></svelte-scrollstory> </div> <div><p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Figures are rounded.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p></div> </figure><p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->The calculation above, which we have repeated for every grant paid last year, is a bit simplified. In reality, the researchers would lose even more money than we’ve shown, because of the way indirect funding is calculated (see our methodology at the bottom of this article).<!-- HTML_TAG_END --> </p><p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Our analysis also makes some other conservative assumptions given the policy’s uncertainty. We assume, for instance, that the new 15 percent rate is a flat rate that all grantees would receive, and not a maximum rate (a distinction left unclear in the N.I.H. guidance). We also assume that the change applies not just to institutions of higher education, but also to all kinds of grantees, including hospitals.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --> </p><p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->In a statement, the White House indicated it would reserve any savings for additional research grants. “Contrary to the hysteria, redirecting billions of allocated N.I.H. spending away from administrative bloat means there will be more money and resources available for legitimate scientific research, not less,” said Kush Desai, a White House spokesman.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --> </p><p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->The N.I.H. announcement, however, coincides with the Trump administration’s moves to cut spending across the government, and with the N.I.H.’s withholding of funding for grants — their direct and indirect costs alike — in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/31/us/trump-freeze-blocked.html">apparent conflict</a> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/28/us/politics/states-lawsuit-trump-federal-grants-pause.html">with separate court orders</a>.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --> </p><p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->The N.I.H. <a href="https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-25-068.html">guidance document</a> includes a number of conflicting statements and statistics the Upshot could not reconcile. The N.I.H. also declined to answer questions about the policy and about its public-facing data tracking grant spending.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --> </p><p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->The N.I.H. since 1950 has provided these overhead funds in a formulaic way, and since 1965, the government has used a rate individually calculated for each institution. Federal officials review cost summaries, floor plans and other information to determine that rate. That number can be higher for institutions in more expensive parts of the country, or for those that use more energy-intensive equipment. The proposal from the Trump administration would set aside those differences in standardizing the rate at 15 percent for every grantee.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --> </p><p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->The lists below estimate what would have happened to the 10 universities and hospitals that received the most N.I.H. grant money in the 2024 fiscal year, if the formula change had been in effect then.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --> </p><figure><div><p><h3><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Largest N.I.H. grant recipients among colleges, universities and medical schools<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></h3>  </p></div>  <div><table><colgroup data-svelte-h="svelte-1dstzqh"><col> <col> <col></colgroup> <thead data-svelte-h="svelte-1s18ww"><tr><th>Name</th> <th>Total ’24 Funding</th> <th>Estimated reduction</th></tr></thead> <tbody><tr><td><p>University of California, San Francisco</p> <p>San Francisco</p>  </td> <td>$793 mil.</td> <td>$121 mil.</td> </tr><tr><td><p>Johns Hopkins University</p> <p>Baltimore</p>  </td> <td>$788 mil.</td> <td>$136 mil.</td> </tr><tr><td><p>Washington University</p> <p>St. Louis</p>  </td> <td>$717 mil.</td> <td>$108 mil.</td> </tr><tr><td><p>University of Michigan</p> <p>Ann Arbor, Mich.</p>  </td> <td>$708 mil.</td> <td>$119 mil.</td> </tr><tr><td><p>University of Pennsylvania</p> <p>Philadelphia</p>  </td> <td>$652 mil.</td> <td>$129 mil.</td> </tr><tr><td><p>University of Pittsburgh</p> <p>Pittsburgh, Pa.</p>  </td> <td>$632 mil.</td> <td>$115 mil.</td> </tr><tr><td><p>Columbia University Health Sciences</p> <p>New York</p>  </td> <td>$611 mil.</td> <td>$111 mil.</td> </tr><tr><td><p>Yale University</p> <p>New Haven, Conn.</p>  </td> <td>$602 mil.</td> <td>$131 mil.</td> </tr><tr><td><p>Stanford University</p> <p>Stanford, Calif.</p>  </td> <td>$584 mil.</td> <td>$107 mil.</td> </tr><tr><td><p>University of Washington</p> <p>Seattle</p>  </td> <td>$542 mil.</td> <td>$86 mil.</td> </tr></tbody></table> </div> <div> <p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Source: National Institutes of Health<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> <p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Based on spending in the 2024 fiscal year.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p>  </div> </figure><figure><div><p><h3><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Largest N.I.H. grant recipients among hospitals<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></h3>  </p></div>  <div><table><colgroup data-svelte-h="svelte-1dstzqh"><col> <col> <col></colgroup> <thead data-svelte-h="svelte-1s18ww"><tr><th>Name</th> <th>Total ’24 Funding</th> <th>Estimated reduction</th></tr></thead> <tbody><tr><td><p>Massachusetts General Hospital</p> <p>Boston</p>  </td> <td>$641 mil.</td> <td>$98 mil.</td> </tr><tr><td><p>Vanderbilt University Medical Center</p> <p>Nashville</p>  </td> <td>$468 mil.</td> <td>$71 mil.</td> </tr><tr><td><p>Brigham and Women’s Hospital</p> <p>Boston</p>  </td> <td>$364 mil.</td> <td>$77 mil.</td> </tr><tr><td><p>Boston Children’s Hospital</p> <p>Boston</p>  </td> <td>$218 mil.</td> <td>$54 mil.</td> </tr><tr><td><p>University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center</p> <p>Houston</p>  </td> <td>$180 mil.</td> <td>$39 mil.</td> </tr><tr><td><p>Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia</p> <p>Philadelphia</p>  </td> <td>$162 mil.</td> <td>$32 mil.</td> </tr><tr><td><p>Dana-Farber Cancer Institute</p> <p>Boston</p>  </td> <td>$161 mil.</td> <td>$35 mil.</td> </tr><tr><td><p>Cincinnati Childrens Hospital Medical Center</p> <p>Cincinnati</p>  </td> <td>$153 mil.</td> <td>$28 mil.</td> </tr><tr><td><p>Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center</p> <p>Boston</p>  </td> <td>$117 mil.</td> <td>$23 mil.</td> </tr><tr><td><p>Cedars-Sinai Medical Center</p> <p>Los Angeles</p>  </td> <td>$100 mil.</td> <td>$23 mil.</td> </tr></tbody></table> </div> <div> <p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Source: National Institutes of Health<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> <p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Based on spending in the 2024 fiscal year, which extends from Oct. 1 to Sept. 30.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p>  </div> </figure><p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->If courts allow the change to move forward, some of its consequences are hard to predict.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --> </p><p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Advocates for the policy change note that these organizations receive numerous other federal subsidies. Most universities and research hospitals are nonprofits that pay no federal taxes, for example. The N.I.H. announcement also noted that these same institutions often accept grants from charitable foundations that offer much lower overhead rates than the federal government, a signal that universities and hospitals willingly pursue research opportunities with less supplemental funding.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --> </p><p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Because the indirect payments are based on broad formulas and not specific line items, critics say institutions may be diverting these federal dollars into unaccountable funds to pay for programs that taxpayers can’t see, such as the kinds of diversity, equity and inclusion programs targeted by the Trump administration.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --> </p><p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->“That’s how you get things like the ability of administrators to use larger overhead pools of money to build out D.E.I. bureaucracies, or to fund Ph.D. programs in the humanities,” said Jay Greene, a senior research fellow in the Center for Education Policy at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative research group. Mr. Greene was the coauthor of <a href="https://www.heritage.org/education/report/indirect-costs-how-taxpayers-subsidize-university-nonsense">a 2022 article</a> urging the N.I.H. to cut or eliminate indirect grant funding. But he did not have specific examples to cite of research funds being spent in this way.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --> </p><p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Researchers say the indirect funds have a branding problem, but are a necessary component of research.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --> </p><p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->“The term ‘indirect costs’ or the alternative term ‘overhead’ sounds dangerously close to ‘slush fund’ to some people,” said Jeremy Berg, who was the director of the National Institute of General Medical Sciences at the N.I.H. from 2003 to 2011. “There are real costs somebody has to pay for, and heating and cooling university laboratory buildings is a real cost.”<!-- HTML_TAG_END --> </p><p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Some grant recipients already receive low overhead payments, but a large majority of them currently receive more than 15 percent, meaning they will need to make budgetary changes to absorb the loss. Among the 2024 grants that we analyzed, institutions that received more than $1 million in N.I.H. support got an average of 40 cents of indirect funding for every dollar of direct funding.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --> </p><figure aria-label="graphic"><div><h3><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Distribution of overhead funding at N.I.H.-funded institutions in 2024<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></h3> <p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->As a share of direct funding<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> </div>   <div> <p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Source: National Institutes of Health<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> <p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Calculated for 613 institutions that received at least $1 million in funding in fiscal year 2024.

Some might be able to raise money from donors to fill the shortfalls, though most universities are already raising as much philanthropic money as they can.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --> </p><p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->But many research institutions have said they would adjust by simply doing less medical research, because they would not be able to afford to do as much with less government help.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --> </p><p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Universities and hospitals might also shift the kinds of research they do, avoiding areas that require more lab space, regulatory compliance or high-tech equipment, and focusing on types of research that will require them to provide less overhead funding themselves. That may mean disproportionate reductions in complex areas of research like genetics.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --> </p><p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Those effects may be spread unevenly across the research landscape, as some organizations find a way to adjust, while others abandon medical research altogether.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --> </p><p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->We’ve compiled a list of institutions that received at least $1 million in N.I.H. funding in the 2024 fiscal year, along with our estimates of how much less they would have gotten under the new policy. Most of these institutions are universities or hospitals, but there are also some private companies and nonprofit research groups. Our numbers tend to be underestimates of the cuts.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --> </p><figure>  <div>  <table><colgroup data-svelte-h="svelte-1yz33f5"><col> <col> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup

analysis</p> <p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->To estimate changes in funding, we relied on data from RePORT, the N.I.H.’s online <a href="https://report.nih.gov/award/index.cfm?ot=&amp;fy=2024">registry</a> of grants and projects. We limited our analysis to grants listed within the 50 U.S. states, the District of Columbia or Puerto Rico. We also limited it to grants where the amount of indirect funding was known and where the combined indirect and direct funding was within five percent of the listed total funding. These filters resulted in removing many grants to private organizations such as domestic for-profits.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --> </p><p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->We calculated how much indirect funding each grant would have received under the new guidance by multiplying the listed direct funding amount by 15 percent. We then compared that number to the listed indirect funding amount for each great to estimate the impact of the policy.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --> </p><p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->There are two reasons our calculations are most likely conservative estimates of true reductions in funding. First, only a portion of the direct funding for each grant is considered to be “eligible” for the purposes of calculating indirect funding. For example, laboratory equipment and graduate student tuition reimbursements are deducted from the direct costs before applying the negotiated overhead rate, whereas our calculations assumed 100 percent of the listed direct costs would be eligible. We performed a more accurate version of our calculations for the 10 universities and 10 hospitals receiving the most N.I.H. funds by inferring their eligible direct costs from their reported negotiated rates. When we did this, we saw an additional increase in losses of about 20 percent.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --> </p><p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Second, we applied a 15 percent rate to all grants in the database, including those with an initial indirect rate <em>below</em> 15 percent. An <a href="https://jamessmurphy.com/2025/02/09/the-impact-of-an-nih-15-indirect-cost-rate/">analysis by James Murphy</a> helped inform this approach. According to our analysis, then, some grants would actually receive more money under the new guidance. If the new rate operated more like a cap — and grants with rates currently below 15 percent did not change — the overall reductions in funding would be larger, as the reductions would no longer be offset by some small number of funding increases.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --> </p></div>  </figure>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="maincontent"><p>The US Forest Service is firing about 3,400 recent hires while the National Park Service is terminating about 1,000 workers under Donald Trump’s push to cut federal spending and bureaucracy, according to a report on Friday.</p><p>The terminations target employees who are in their probationary employment periods, which includes anyone hired less than a year ago, according to Reuters, and will affect sites such as the Appalachian trail, Yellowstone, the birthplace of Martin Luther King Jr and the Sequoia national forest.</p><p>The cuts represent about 10% of the Forest Service workforce and about 5% of National Park Service employees, but excludes firefighters, law enforcement and certain meteorologists, as well as 5,000 seasonal workers, from the cutbacks.</p><p>“Allowing parks to hire seasonal staff is essential, but staffing cuts of this magnitude will have devastating consequences for parks and communities,” the National Parks Conservation Association (NPCA) president, Theresa Pierno, said in a statement.</p><p>The association warned <a href="https://www.npca.org/articles/6680-how-the-new-administration-s-actions-will-affect-national-parks" data-link-name="in body link">in a statement this month</a> that staffing levels were not keeping pace with increasing demands on the national park system, which saw 325m visits in 2023 alone – an increase of 13m from 2022.</p><p><em><strong>Send us a tip</strong><br>

The administration rescinded the order two days later and is re-evaluating it.</p><p>Across the federal government, about 280,000 employees out of the 2.3 million-member civilian federal workforce were hired in the last two years, with most still on probation and easier to fire, according to government data.</p><p>In addition to the visits to national parks, about 159 million people visit national forests annually. The Department of Agriculture, which oversees the Forest Service, said it could not comment on personnel matters.</p><p>The agriculture department said in a statement that protecting people and communities, as well as infrastructure, businesses and resources, remains “a top priority”.</p><p>“Our wildland firefighter and other public safety positions are of the utmost priority,” it added.</p><p>However, the federal funding freeze is affecting programs meant to mitigate wildfire risk in western states as well as freezing the hiring of seasonal firefighters.</p><p>The reduction in resources for wildfire prevention comes a month after devastating blazes in Los Angeles that are expected to be the costliest in US history.</p><figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement"><a data-ignore="global-link-styling" href="#EmailSignup-skip-link-14">skip past newsletter promotion</a><p id="EmailSignup-skip-link-14" tabindex="0" aria-label="after newsletter promotion" role="note">after newsletter promotion</p></figure><p>The Oregon-based Lomakatsi Restoration Project non-profit said its contracts with federal agencies, including the US Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management, to reduce hazardous fuels in Oregon, California and Idaho have been frozen.</p><p>“The funding freeze has impacted more than 30 separate grants and agreements that Lomakatsi has with federal agencies, including pending awards as well as active agreements that are already putting work on the ground,” the project’s executive director, Marko Bey, said in a letter to the senator Jeff Merkley of Oregon.</p><p>A spokesperson for the interior department, the parent agency of the Bureau of Land Management and the National Park Service, said it was reviewing funding decisions.</p><p>Senate Democrats have called on the administration to unlock fire-mitigation funding, and separately have asked interior and agriculture department leadership to exempt seasonal firefighters from a broad federal hiring freeze.</p><p>Grassroots Wildland Firefighters, an advocacy group for federal firefighters, said its members have been unable to hire the hundreds of firefighters that are typically brought on at this time of year to gear up for the summer fire season.</p><p>“The agencies already have had a recruitment and retention problem,” Riva Duncan, vice-president of the Grassroots Wildland Firefighters, said in an interview. “This just exacerbates that problem.”</p></div></div>]]></description>

  <h3>how websites waste CPU cycles &amp; battery and Firefox lets them</h3>
<h4>by <a href="https://x.com/h43z">h43z</a> (<a href="https://h.43z.one/">hompage</a>)</h4>
  <p>I recently got a new notebook and noticed that the speakers would occasionally emit a faint but annoying white noise. This issue was only noticeable in a quiet room when no music or other audio was playing through the speakers.</p>
  <p>After some digging, I came across the following command</p>
  <pre><code>pactl list sinks short</code></pre>
  <p>(check powercfg /requests on windows?!)</p>
  <p>This command lists all available audio sinks for PulseAudio on Linux along with their current state. The states can be one of the following: IDLE, SUSPENDED, or RUNNING.</p>
  <p>I observed that the speakers remained silent whenever the audio sink was in the SUSPENDED state. However, the white noise would sometimes occur when the sink was in IDLE or RUNNING, even when no music or sounds were being played.</p>
  <p>Even though I had the setting to automatically suspend the audio sinks after 10 seconds of inactivity:</p>
  <pre><code>% grep -R module-suspend-on-idle /etc/pulse/
/etc/pulse/default.pa:load-module module-suspend-on-idle
/etc/pulse/system.pa:load-module module-suspend-on-idle</code></pre>
  <p>But sometimes, the sink never went IDLE and therefore never got SUSPENDED.</p>
  <p>The manual for module-suspend-on-idle says:</p>
  <pre><code>Since 0.9.11. Disconnects sinks and sources from their backend after a
predetermined amount of idle time. Idle time is accumulated when the sink/source
in question is not connected to any streams.

Advantages: Saves power. ALSA uses considerably more CPU cycles when pulseaudio
has to send empty data to the soundcard during idle. If you don't plan to have
an active stream all the time, set the timer to a low value for best power savings.</code></pre>
  <p>I began using the command:</p>
  <pre><code>pactl list sink-inputs</code></pre>
  <p>whenever I noticed the white noise, trying to identify which program was using the audio sink.</p>
  <p>It turned out to always be Firefox. However, none of the open tabs were supposed to play any sound—not even muted videos.</p>
  <p>To get behind what was going on, I created a small script for my i3 status bar. The script displays a red indicator whenever the audio sink switched to the RUNNING state.</p>
  <p>The culprit seemed to be the notification sound from my pinned tab of <a href="https://outlook.office.com/">outlook.office.com</a>. Whenever I received an email, the white noise would start and wouldn't stop until I reloaded the tab or restarted Firefox.</p>
  <p>This issue was not just about the annoying white noise—it was also draining my notebook’s battery faster.</p>
  <p>Here’s the CPU/power consumption without the white noise:</p>

  <p>It's not nothing—about 1.5 Watt more.</p>
  <p>So, with a heavy heart, I decided to disable email notifications—even though I really wanted to keep them—but eliminating the white noise was my priority.</p>
    <p>I thought I had “fixed” the problem. Of course, I blamed Microsoft, right?</p>
    
    <div><p>But the red sound indicator on my i3 status bar kept lighting up occasionally.</p><p>

    And it turned out other websites were also triggering the white noise.</p></div>
    
    <p>For instance, as soon as I clicked anywhere on <a href="https://x.com/" target="_blank">x.com</a>, the noise started. Similarly, whenever I listened to a translation on <a href="https://translate.google.com/" target="_blank">translate.google.com</a>, there was the noise.</p>
    
    <p>And just having the <a href="https://discord.com/app" target="_blank">Discord (web app)</a> website open, same ugly effect.</p>
    
    <p>So now I was really curious. What is going on here.</p>
    
    <p>I started to look up how you can play audio with HTML/JavaScript.<br>
    There seem to be two ways: Either with the <code>&lt;audio&gt;</code> tag or the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API" target="_blank">WebAudio API</a>.</p>
    
    <p>As Outlook plays sound dynamically, I knew it must use the WebAudio API.<br>
    And to do anything with audio, you first have to create an <code>AudioContext</code>.</p>

  <pre><code>const audioCtx = new AudioContext();</code></pre>
  <p>And already here I realized the problem. Just creating this AudioContext makes my speakers play white noise.</p>
  <p>You can test it here: <a href="https://editor.43z.one/sqare/i">https://editor.43z.one/sqare</a></p>
  <p>The MDN article is pretty clear about it.</p>
  <pre><code>AudioContext.suspend()
Suspends the progression of time in the audio context, temporarily halting<br> audio hardware access and reducing CPU/battery usage in the process.

AudioContext.resume()
Resumes the progression of time in an audio context that has previously<br> been suspended.</code></pre>
<p>(easy peasy <a href="https://editor.43z.one/13zzt">https://editor.43z.one/13zzt)</a>
  </p><p>Yet, most websites never bother suspending the AudioContext and create one without the immediate need for playing sound.</p>

<p>Chrome stops the battery/CPU waste automatically afte some time. Firefox not. It just keeps playing the whitenoise.</p>

<p>I understand that the websites are to blame here.</p>
<p>But still, Cmon Firefox, protect me from this resource theft?!</p>
<p>Oh and btw I suspect this also wastes my bluetooth headphones battery if they are connected?! Once I do a click on x.com the sending of white noise starts.</p>
<video width="320" height="240" controls="" preload="none">
  <source src="https://h.43z.one/blog/2025-02-12/bluetooth.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>

  <p>To address this total mess, I created an extension that automatically suspends the AudioContext while also
tries to resume it if the websites wants to play sound.</p><p>It's not perfect as resuming takes a little bit of time and it
  may not always resume, as there are multiple paths to starting audio. But it's good enough for me.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://taxfoundation.org/research/federal-tax/trump-administration-tax-proposals/">Trump</a> administration has once again floated the idea of “reciprocal” <a href="https://taxfoundation.org/research/all/federal/trump-tariffs-trade-war/">tariffs</a> on foreign countries. While it is unclear what formula the administration will use to determine what is “reciprocal,” the intention of responding to foreign charges—real and perceived—is clear enough.</p>
<p>In the past, the administration has made general assertions about different <span><a href="https://taxfoundation.org/taxedu/glossary/tariffs/">tariff</a><cite>Tariffs are taxes imposed by one country on goods imported from another country. Tariffs are <a href="https://taxfoundation.org/topics/tariffs-and-trade/">trade barriers</a> that raise prices, reduce available quantities of goods and services for <a href="https://taxfoundation.org/research/all/federal/trump-tariffs-biden-tariffs/">US businesses and consumers</a>, and create an economic burden on foreign exporters.
</cite></span> and nontariff barriers that American exporters face that should be rectified by “reciprocal” US tariffs. Trump commonly <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/european-carmakers-crossfire-united-states-europe-trade-war/">mentions</a> that the EU charges a 10 percent import <span><a href="https://taxfoundation.org/taxedu/glossary/tax/">tax</a><cite>A tax is a mandatory payment or charge collected by local, state, and national governments from individuals or businesses to cover the costs of general government services, goods, and activities.
</cite></span> on US vehicles while the US only levies a 2.5 percent tariff on European cars coming into the US. Though one can certainly find examples of higher trade barriers abroad, the <a href="https://www.cato.org/commentary/tariff-myths-debunked?gad_source=1&amp;gclid=CjwKCAiAqrG9BhAVEiwAaPu5zgSuxH-XwbT7Kgb7FE6uvM7OAkMDDekbiXjFKgJwJ802UUqtLUJabhoC4ukQAvD_BwE">overall tariff gap</a> between the US and its trading partners is <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/fernando-mart%C3%ADn-711a5790_us-export-coverages-activity-7295353938608820224-aT4M?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAA_TE_ABEkKJ4JUzvJbx21NNIBaNIUkAoX8">relatively minor</a>—and any increase in US tariffs will ultimately be paid by US businesses and consumers.  </p>
<p>However, when discussing trade with the EU specifically, White House deputy chief of staff, Stephen Miller, <a href="https://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2025/02/09/miller_trump_trade_action_against_europe_will_offset_eu_regulations_and_vat_taxes_on_american_products.html" rel="nofollow">added</a> a new policy grievance to the mix: <a href="https://taxfoundation.org/taxedu/glossary/value-added-tax-vat/">value-added taxes (VAT)</a>.  </p>
<p>“Did you know when you ship a car from the US to Europe, if they let it in at all because they have many nontariff barriers, between the VAT and duties, that car is taxed at 30%? The German car—or a European car sent the America is taxed at 2.5%—or basically 0.”</p>
<p>His statement assumes that a VAT discriminates against American car exports like a tariff, and conversely, that the VAT rebate provided to European car producers exporting to the US constitutes a subsidy and the car then simply faces a tariff and no VAT. (It is worth noting that both a domestic automobile and a European car sold in the US would face US state <span><a href="https://taxfoundation.org/taxedu/glossary/sales-tax/">sales tax</a><cite>A sales tax is levied on retail sales of goods and services and, ideally, should apply to all final <a href="https://taxfoundation.org/taxedu/glossary/consumption-tax/">consumption</a> with few <a href="https://taxfoundation.org/taxedu/glossary/tax-exemption/">exemptions</a>.

</cite></span>.) </p>
<p><span>While it</span> may seem like a compelling political argument to justify across-the-board tariffs on the EU, it instead reflects a complete misunderstanding of what a VAT is and how it works. Worse, it misplaces the blame for a lack of US competitiveness on the European VAT instead of reevaluating the flaws of both the US federal and state tax systems.  </p>
<h2><strong>What is VAT and how does it work for exported goods?</strong></h2>
<p><a href="https://taxfoundation.org/taxedu/glossary/value-added-tax-vat/">VATs</a> are border-adjusted, meaning they rebate tax on exports and impose tax on imports. Despite the appearance of subsidizing exports and punishing imports, however, a border-adjusted VAT is trade neutral. A border adjusted tax leads to currency appreciation for the imposing country, which would make it cheaper to import goods, more expensive to export goods, and thus would cancel out the apparent benefits of the tax on imports and the rebate on exports.</p>
<p>If there is a complaint to be made about tax policy and implications for US competitiveness in Europe, it is about uncompetitive state sales tax structures in the US system that yield what is known as “<span><a href="https://taxfoundation.org/taxedu/glossary/tax-pyramiding/">tax pyramiding</a><cite><a href="https://taxfoundation.org/taxedu/glossary/tax/">Tax</a> pyramiding occurs when the same final good or service is taxed multiple times along the production process. This yields vastly different effective tax rates depending on the length of the supply chain and disproportionately harms low-margin firms. <a href="https://taxfoundation.org/taxedu/glossary/gross-receipts-tax/">Gross receipts taxes</a> are a prime example of tax pyramiding in action.
</cite></span>.”</p>
<h2><strong>What is US sales tax and how does it work for exported goods? </strong></h2>
<p>Unlike most countries, the <a href="https://taxfoundation.org/location/united-states/">United States</a> does not impose a broad-based <span><a href="https://taxfoundation.org/taxedu/glossary/consumption-tax/">consumption tax</a><cite>A consumption tax is typically levied on the purchase of goods or services and is paid <a href="https://taxfoundation.org/taxedu/glossary/direct-tax/">directly</a> or <a href="https://taxfoundation.org/taxedu/glossary/indirect-tax/">indirectly</a> by the consumer in the form of retail <a href="https://taxfoundation.org/taxedu/glossary/sales-tax/">sales taxes</a>, <a href="https://taxfoundation.org/taxedu/glossary/excise-tax/">excise taxes</a>, <a href="https://taxfoundation.org/taxedu/glossary/tariffs/">tariffs</a>, <a href="https://taxfoundation.org/taxedu/glossary/value-added-tax-vat/">value-added taxes (VAT)</a>, or an <a href="https://taxfoundation.org/taxedu/glossary/individual-income-tax/">income tax</a> where all savings is tax-<a href="https://taxfoundation.org/taxedu/glossary/tax-deduction/">deductible</a>.
</cite></span> at the national (federal) level, and state-level consumption taxes are designed as general sales taxes rather than value-added taxes. Whereas a VAT is imposed on the incremental increase in value of a good or service at each stage of production, a <a href="https://taxfoundation.org/taxedu/glossary/sales-tax/">sales tax</a> is imposed on the total transaction price of any taxed good or service.</p>
<p>If a sales tax is imposed exclusively on final consumption, then VATs and sales taxes are economically identical. However, when the sales tax is applied to some intermediate transactions (“business inputs”), it results in tax pyramiding, where the tax is embedded in the price multiple times over.</p>
<p>Consider the following example of a 5 percent VAT and two versions of a 5 percent sales tax—one which only applies to final consumption, and one which applies to certain intermediate transactions as well.</p>
<h4>VATs and Ideal Sales Taxes are Economically Identical</h4><h5><em>A 5% VAT compared to a 5% ideal sales tax and a 5% sales tax with business input taxation</em></h5>


<!-- #tablepress-803 from cache -->
<p>Note that, while a VAT is imposed at every stage of the process, the net effect is to apply the rate one time to the final sales price. The tax is collected in increments (on the “value added” at each stage), but unlike with a pyramiding sales tax, it does not double tax inputs. The VAT and ideal sales tax share an identical <span><a href="https://taxfoundation.org/taxedu/glossary/tax-base/">tax base</a><cite>The tax base is the total amount of income, property, assets, consumption, transactions, or other economic activity subject to taxation by a tax authority. A narrow tax base is non-neutral and inefficient. A <a href="https://taxfoundation.org/taxedu/glossary/base-broadening/">broad</a> tax base reduces tax administration costs and allows more revenue to be raised at lower rates.
</cite></span> and, if imposed at the same rates, yield identical collections.</p>
<p>US sales taxes are typically destination-based, meaning that the tax is owed where the product is received or consumed. If a European resident orders from a US retailer, they do not pay US sales tax, just like a US consumer can obtain a VAT rebate on purchases of European products. Neither is a subsidy. These are simply consumption taxes falling on the consumer.</p>
<p>In practice, however, US sales taxes diverge sharply from the ideal. More than 40 percent of US sales tax revenue comes from intermediate transactions, which impose costs on US producers. This design flaw is not present in VATs, which do not double-tax intermediate transactions. Consequently, the sales tax imposes a penalty on domestic production that a VAT (or a better designed sales tax) would not. European VATs aren’t subsidizing anything—US states are just shooting themselves in the foot.</p>
<p>Crucially, this is true in domestic as well as international sales. If a state’s sales tax only applied to final consumption, it would never put in-state businesses at a disadvantage against rivals in other states, because consumers elsewhere are subject to their own state’s sales tax. A <a href="https://taxfoundation.org/location/maryland/">Maryland</a> resident pays 6 percent sales tax on whatever she orders (that’s subject to Maryland’s sales tax), regardless of whether she buys from a retailer in Maryland, or <a href="https://taxfoundation.org/location/delaware/">Delaware</a> (with no sales tax), or <a href="https://taxfoundation.org/location/louisiana/">Louisiana</a> (with an average rate north of 10 percent). But when Maryland taxes business inputs, that imposes a cost on Maryland businesses that could be mitigated if businesses operated in lower-tax states or in states which include fewer inputs in their tax base.</p>
<p>The disadvantages created by the sales tax, therefore, aren’t unique to goods exported abroad. They aren’t the consequence of trade policy, but of poor tax policy. Europe’s VATs are not tariffs and are not subsidizing European exports. Instead, US states’ poorly-designed sales taxes are harming their own businesses’ competitiveness—whether they’re selling down the street, across state lines, or around the world.</p>
<h2><strong>What competitiveness issues remain with the US federal tax system?</strong></h2>
<p>Just like state sales tax systems can create a competitive disadvantage for producers, certain elements of the federal income tax system harm incentives to invest domestically. Despite progress made by the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the US maintains long <span><a href="https://taxfoundation.org/taxedu/glossary/depreciation/">depreciation</a><cite>Depreciation is a measurement of the “useful life” of a business asset, such as machinery or a factory, to determine the multiyear period over which the cost of that asset can be deducted from <a href="https://taxfoundation.org/taxedu/glossary/taxable-income/">taxable income</a>. Instead of allowing businesses to deduct the cost of investments immediately (i.e., <a href="https://taxfoundation.org/taxedu/glossary/full-expensing/">full expensing</a>), depreciation requires deductions to be taken over time, reducing their value and discouraging investment.
</cite></span> schedules for structures investment, now requires amortization for research and development expenses, and is phasing out <span><a href="https://taxfoundation.org/taxedu/glossary/bonus-depreciation/">bonus depreciation</a><cite>Bonus depreciation allows firms to deduct a larger portion of certain “short-lived” investments in new or improved technology, equipment, or buildings in the first year. Allowing businesses to write off more investments partially alleviates a bias in the tax code and incentivizes companies to invest more, which, in the long run, raises worker productivity, boosts wages, and creates more jobs.
</cite></span> for machinery and equipment investment. The absence of full, immediate deductions for investment increases the cost of capital, and thus discourages investment and wage growth.</p>
<p>Rather than focus on raising tariffs, which i<a href="https://taxfoundation.org/testimony/tariffs-alternatives-boost-us-competitiveness/">ncrease the cost</a> of operating in the United States and <a href="https://taxfoundation.org/testimony/tariffs-alternatives-boost-us-competitiveness/">reduce total output and productivity</a>, fiscal policy reforms to improve the structure of the federal income tax system can better boost competitiveness of the US manufacturing sector.</p>
<h2><strong>Conclusion </strong></h2>
<p>Countries have many reasons why they apply different tariff rates to different products. In the case of the United States, some tariffs date back to the 1930s Smoot-Hawley tariff schedule, while other US trade barriers take on non-tariff forms. The Trump administration appears to be moving in a “reciprocal” policy direction despite the significant negative economic consequences for American consumers of across-the-board tariffs on goods coming into the US. However, the EU’s VAT system should not be used as a justification for retaliatory tariffs. </p>

<h2>NASA has a list of 10 rules for software development</h2>

<p>Read the <a href="https://www.cs.otago.ac.nz/cosc345/resources/nasa-10-rules.pdf">full document (local copy)</a>
or the <a href="http://spinroot.com/gerard/pdf/P10.pdf">original</a>.
Read it first, before reading these comments.

</p><p>Those rules were written from the point of view of people writing
embedded software for extremely expensive spacecraft, where tolerating
a lot of programming pain is a good tradeoff for not losing a mission.
I do not know why someone in that situation does not use the SPARK
subset of Ada, which subset was explicitly designed for verification,
and is simply a better starting point for embedded programming than C.
</p><p>I am criticising them from the point of view of people writing
programming language processors (compilers, interpreters, editors)
and application software.
</p><p>We are supposed to teach critical thinking.  This is an example.
</p><ul>
<li>How have Gerard J. Holzmann's and my different contexts affected
our judgement?
</li><li>Can you blindly follow his advice without considering <em>your</em>
context?
</li><li>Can you blindly follow <em>my</em> advice without considering
your context?
</li><li>Would these rules necessarily apply to a different/better
programming language?  What if <a href="#ppar">function pointers
were tamed</a>?  What if the language provided opaque abstract
data types as Ada does?
</li></ul>

<h3>1. Restrict all code to very simple control flow constructs —
do not use <code>goto</code> statements,
<code>setjmp()</code> or <code>longjmp()</code> constructs,
and direct or indirect <em>recursion</em>.</h3>

<p>Note that <code>setjmp()</code> and <code>longjmp()</code>
are how C does exception handling, so this rule bans any use
of exception handling.

</p><p>It is true that banning recursion and jumps and loops without
explicit bounds means that you <em>know</em> your program is
going to terminate.  It is also true that recursive functions
can be proven to terminate about as often as loops can, with
reasonably well-understood methods.  What's more important here is
that “sure to terminate” does not imply
“sure to terminate in my lifetime”:
</p><pre>    int const N = 1000000000;
    for (x0 = 0; x0 != N; x0++)
    for (x1 = 0; x1 != N; x1++)
    for (x2 = 0; x2 != N; x2++)
    for (x3 = 0; x3 != N; x3++)
    for (x4 = 0; x4 != N; x4++)
    for (x5 = 0; x5 != N; x5++)
    for (x6 = 0; x6 != N; x6++)
    for (x7 = 0; x7 != N; x7++)
    for (x8 = 0; x8 != N; x8++)
    for (x9 = 0; x9 != N; x9++)
        -- do something --;
</pre>
<p>This does a bounded number of iterations.  The bound is N<sup>10</sup>.
In this case, that's 10<sup>90</sup>.  If each iteration of the loop body
takes 1 nsec, that's 10<sup>81</sup> seconds, or about 7.9×10<sup>72</sup>
years.  What is the <em>practical</em> difference between “will stop
in 7,900,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000
years” and “will never stop”?

</p><p>Worse still, taking a problem that is <em>naturally</em> expressed
using recursion and contorting it into something that manipulates an
explicit stack, while possible, turns clear maintainable code into
buggy spaghetti.  (I've done it, several times.  There's an example
on this web site.  It is <em>not</em> a good idea.)

</p><h3>2. All loops must have a fixed upper-bound.  It must be trivially
possible for a checking tool to prove statically that a preset
upper-bound on the number of iterations of a loop cannot be exceeded.
If the loop-bound cannot be proven statically, the rule is considered
violated.</h3>

<p>This is an old idea.  As the example above shows, it is not enough
by itself to be of any practical use.  You have to try to make the
bounds reasonably <em>tight</em>, and you have to regard hitting an
artificial bound as a run-time error.

</p><p>By the way, note that putting depth bounds on recursive procedures
makes them every bit as safe as loops with fixed bounds.

</p><h3>3. Do not use dynamic memory allocation after initialization.</h3>

<p>This is also a very old idea.  Some languages designed for embedded
work don't even <em>have</em> dynamic memory allocation.  The big
thing, of course, is that embedded applications have a fixed amount of
memory to work with, are never going to get any more, and should not
crash because they couldn't handle another record.

</p><p>Note that the rationale actually supports a much stronger rule:
don't even <em>simulate</em> dynamic memory allocation.  You can of
course manage your own storage pool:
</p><pre>    typedef struct Foo_Record *foo;
    struct Foo_Record {
	foo next;
	...
    };
    #define MAX_FOOS ...
    static struct Foo_Record foo_zone[MAX_FOOS];
    foo foo_free_list = 0;

    void init_foo_free_list() {
	for (int i = MAX_FOOS - 1; i &gt;= 0; i--) {
	    foo_zone[i].next = foo_free_list;
	    foo_free_list = &amp;foo_zone[i];
	}
    }

    foo malloc_foo() {
	foo r = foo_free_list;
	if (r == 0) report_error();
	foo_free_list = r-&gt;next;
	return r;
    }

    void free_foo(foo x) {
	x-&gt;next = foo_free_list;
	foo_free_list = x;
    }
</pre>
<p>This <em>technically</em> satisfies the rule, but it
violates the <em>spirit</em> of the rule.  Simulating malloc()
and free() this way is <em>worse</em> than using the real
thing, because the memory in foo_zone is permanently tied up
for Foo_Records, even if we don't need any of those at the
moment but do desperately need the memory for something else.

</p><p>What you really need to do is to use a memory allocator
with known behaviour, and to prove that the amount of memory
in use at any given time (data bytes + headers) is bounded
by a known value.

</p><p>Note also that SPlint can verify at compile time that
the errors NASA speak of do not occur.

</p><p>One of the reasons given for the ban is that the performance
of malloc() and free() is unpredictable.  Are these the only
functions we use with unpredictable performance?  Is there
anything about malloc() and free() which makes them
<em>necessarily</em> unpredictable?  The existence of
hard-real-time garbage collectors suggests not.

</p><p>The rationale for this rule says that
</p><blockquote>
Note that the only way
to dynamically claim memory in the absence of memory allocation from the
heap is to use stack memory.  In the absence of recursion (Rule 1), an
upper bound on the use of stack memory can derived statically, thus
making it possible to prove that an application will always live within
its pre-allocated memory means.
</blockquote>
<p>Unfortunately, the sunny optimism shown here is unjustified.  Given
the ISO C standard (any version, C89, C99, or C11) it is <em>impossible</em>
to determine an upper bound on the use of stack memory.  There is not even
any standard way to determine how much memory a compiler will use for the
stack frame of a given function.  (There could have been.  There just isn't.)
There isn't even any requirement that two invocations of the same function
with the same arguments will use the same amount of memory.
Such a bound can only be calculated for a <em>specific</em> version of a
specific compiler with specific options.  Here's a trivial example:
</p><pre>void f() {
    char a[100000];
}
</pre>
<p>How much memory will that take on the stack?  Compiled for debugging,
it might take a full stack frame (however big that is) plus traceback
information plus a million bytes for a[].  Compiled with optimisation,
the compiler might notice that a[] isn't used, and might even compile
calls to f() inline so that they generate no code and take no space.
That's an extreme example, but not really unfair.  If you want bounds
you can rely on, you had better <em>check</em> what your compiler does,
and recheck every time anything about the compiler changes.

</p><h3>4.  No function should be longer than what can be printed on
a single sheet of paper in a standard reference format with one line per
statement and one line per declaration.  Typically, this means no more
than about 60 lines of code per function.</h3>

<p>Since programmers these days typically read their code on-screen,
not on paper, it's not clear why the size of a sheet of paper is
relevant any longer.

</p><p>The rule is arguably stated about the wrong thing.  The thing that
needs to be bounded is not the size of a function, but the size of a
chunk that a programmer needs to read and comprehend.

</p><p>There are also question marks about how to interpret this if you
are using a sensible language (like Algol 60, Simula 67, Algol 68,
Pascal, Modula2, Ada, Lisp, functional languages like ML, O'CAML,
F#, Clean, Haskell, or Fortran) that allows nested procedures.
Suppose you have a folding editor that presents a procedure to
you like this:
</p><pre>function Text_To_Floating(S: string, E: integer): Double;
   � variables �
   � procedure Mul(Carry: integer) �
   � function Evaluate: Double �

   Base, Sign, Max, Min, Point, Power := 10, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0;
   for N := 1 to S.length do begin
       C := S[N];
       if C = '.' then begin
          Point := -1
       end else
       if C = '_' then begin
          Base := Round(Evaluate);
          Max, Min, Power := 0, 1, 0
       end else
       if Char ≠ ' ' then begin
          Q := ord(C) - ord('0');
          if Q &gt; 9 then Q := ord(C) - ord('A') + 10
          Power := Point + Point
          Mul(Q)
       end
    end;
    Power := Power + Exp;
    Value := Evaluate;
    if Sign &lt; 0 then Value := -Value;
end;
</pre>
<p>which would be much bigger if the declarations
were expanded out instead of being hidden behind �folds�.
Which size do we count?  The folded size or the unfolded size?
</p><p>I was using a folding editor called Apprentice on the Classic Mac
back in the 1980s.  It was written by Peter McInerny and was lightning
fast.

</p><h3>5.  The <i>assertion density</i> of the code should average to a minimum of
two assertions per function.</h3>

<p>Assertions are wonderful documentation and the very best debugging tool
I know of.  I have never seen any real code that had too many assertions.

</p><p>The example here is one of the ugliest pieces of code I've seen in a while.
</p><pre>if (!c_assert(p &gt;= 0) == true) {
    return ERROR;
}
</pre>
<p>It should, of course, just be
</p><pre>if (!c_assert(p &gt;= 0)) {
    return ERROR;
}
</pre>
<p>Better still, it should be something like
</p><pre>check(ERROR, p &gt;= 0);
</pre>
<p><a name="check" id="check">with</a>
</p><pre>#ifdef NDEBUG
#define check(e, c) (void)0
#else
#define check(e, c) if (!(c)) return bugout(c), (e)
#ifdef NDEBUG_LOG
#define bugout(c) (void)0
#else
#define bugout(c) \
    fprintf(stderr, "%s:%d: assertion '%s' failed.\n", \
    __FILE__, __LINE__, #s)
#endif
#endif
</pre>
<p>Ahem.  The more interesting part is the required density.
I just checked an open source project from a large telecoms
company, and 23 out of 704 files (not functions) contained
at least one assertion.  I just checked my own Smalltalk
system and one SLOC out of every 43 was an assertion, but
the average Smalltalk “function” is only a few
lines.  If the biggest function allowed is 60 lines, then
let's suppose the average function is about 36 lines, so
this rule requires 1 assertion per 18 lines.
</p><p>Assertions are good, but what they are especially good
for is expressing the requirements on data that come
from outside the function.  I suggest then that
</p><ul>
<li>Every argument whose validity is not guaranteed by
its typed should have an assertion to check it.
</li><li>Every datum that is obtained from an external
source (file, data base, message) whose validity is
not guaranteed by its type should have an assertion
to check it.
</li></ul>
<p>The NASA 10 rules are written for embedded systems, where
reading stuff from sensors is fairly common.

</p><h3>6.  Data objects must be declared at the smallest possible level of
scope.</h3>

<p>This is excellent advice, but why limit it to data objects?
Oh yeah, the rules were written for crippled languages where you
<em>couldn't</em> declare functions in the right place.

</p><p>People using Ada, Pascal (Delphi), JavaScript, or functional
languages should also declare types and functions as locally as
possible.

</p><h3>7.  The return value of non-void functions must be checked by each
calling function, and the validity of parameters must be checked inside
each function.</h3>

<p>This again is mainly about C, or any other language that indicates
failure by returning special values.  “Standard libraries
famously violate this rule”?  No, the <em>C</em> library does.

</p><p>You have to be reasonable about this: it simply isn't practical
to check <em>every</em> aspect of validity for <em>every</em>
argument.  Take the C function
</p><pre>void *bsearch(
    void const *key  /* what we are looking for */,
    void const *base /* points to an array of things like that */,
    size_t      n    /* how many elements base has */,
    size_t      size /* the common size of key and base's elements */
    int (*      cmp)(void const *, void const *)
);
</pre>
<p>This does a binary search in an array.  We must have key≠0,
base≠0, size≠0, cmp≠0, cmp(key,key)=0, and for all
1&lt;i&lt;n,
</p><pre>cmp((char*)base+size*(i-1), (char*)base+size*i) &lt;= 0
</pre>
<p>Checking the validity in full would mean checking
that [key..key+size) is a range of readable addresses,
[base..base+size*n) is a range of readable addresses,
and doing n calls to cmp.  But the whole point of binary
search is to do O(log(n)) calls to cmp.

</p><p>The fundamental rules here are
</p><ul>
<li>Don't let run-time errors go un-noticed, and
</li><li>any check is safer than no check.
</li></ul>

<h3>8. The use of the preprocessor must be limited to the inclusion of
header files and simple macro definitions.  Token pasting, variable
argument lists (ellipses), and recursive macro calls are not allowed.</h3>

<p>Recursive macro calls don't really work in C, so no quarrel there.
Variable argument lists were introduced into macros in
C99 so that you could write code like
</p><pre>#define err_printf(level, ...) \
    if (debug_level &gt;= level) fprintf(stderr, __VA_ARGS__)
...
    err_printf(HIGH, "About to frob %d\n", control_index);
</pre>
<p>This is a <em>good</em> thing; conditional tracing like this is a
powerful debugging aid.  It should be <em>encouraged</em>, not banned.

</p><p>The rule goes on to ban macros that expand into things that are
not complete syntactic units.  This would, for example, prohibit
simulating try-catch blocks with macros.  (Fair enough, an earlier rule
banned exception handling anyway.)  Consider this code fragment, from
an actual program.
</p><pre>    row_flag = border;     
    if (row_flag) printf("\\hline");
    for_each_element_child(e0, i, j, e1)
        printf(row_flag ? "\\\\\n" : "\n");
        row_flag = true;  
        col_flag = false;
        for_each_element_child(e1, k, l, e2)
            if (col_flag) printf(" &amp; ");
            col_flag = true;
            walk_paragraph("", e2, "");
        end_each_element_child
    end_each_element_child
    if (border) printf("\\\\\\hline");
    printf("\n\\end{tabular}\n");
</pre>
<p>It's part of a program converting slides written in something like HTML
into another notation for formatting.  The <code>for_each_element_child</code>
… <code>end_each_element_child</code> loops walk over a tree.  Using
these macros means that the programmer has no need to know and no reason to
care how the tree is represented and how the loop actually works.
You can easily see that <code>for_each_element_child</code> must have at
least one unmatched { and <code>end_each_element_child</code> must have at least one
unmatched }.  That's the kind of macro that's banned by requiring
complete syntactic units.  Yet the readability and maintainability of
the code is <em>dramatically</em> improved by these macros.

</p><p>One thing the rule covers, but does not at the beginning stress, is
“no <em>conditional</em> macro processing”.  That is,
no #if.  The argument against it is, I'm afraid, questionable.  If there
are 10 conditions, there are 2<sup>10</sup> combinations to test,
whether they are expressed as compile-time conditionals or run-time
conditionals.

</p><p>In particular, the rule against conditional macro processing
would prevent you defining your own <a href="#check">assertion macros</a>.
It is not obvious that that's a good idea.

</p><h3>9.  The use of pointers should be restricted.  Specifically, no more
than one level of dereferencing is allowed.  Pointer dereference
operations may not be hidden in macro definitions or inside typedef
declarations.  Function pointers are not permitted.</h3>

<p>Let's look at the last point first.

</p><pre>double integral(double (*f)(double), double lower, double upper, int n) {
    // Compute the integral of f from lower to upper 
    // using Simpson's rule with n+1 points.
    double const h = (upper - lower) / n;
    double       s;
    double       t;
    int          i;
    
    s = 0.0;
    for (i = 0; i &lt; n; i++) s += f((lower + h/2.0) + h*i);
    t = 0.0;
    for (i = 1; i &lt; n; i++) t += f(lower + h*i);
    return (f(lower) + f(upper) + s*4.0 + t*2.0) * (h/6.0);
}
</pre>

<p>This kind of code has been important in numerical calculations since
the very earliest days.  Pascal could do it.  Algol 60 could do it.
In the 1950s, Fortran could do it.  And NASA would ban it, because in
C, <code>f</code> is a function pointer.

</p><p>Now it's important to write functions like this once and only once.
For example, the code has at least one error.  The comment says n+1
points, but the function is actually evaluated at 2n+1 points.  If we
need to bound the number of calls to f in order to meet a deadline,
having that number off by a factor of two will not help.
</p><p>It's nice to have just one place to fix.
Perhaps I should not have copied that code from a well-known source (:-).
Certainly I should not have more than one copy!

</p><p>What can we do if we're not allowed to use function pointers?
Suppose there are four functions foo, bar, ugh, and zoo that we need
to integrate.  Now we can write
</p><pre>enum Fun {FOO, BAR, UGH, ZOO};

double call(enum Fun which, double what) {
    switch (which) {
        case FOO: return foo(what);
        case BAR: return bar(what);
        case UGH: return ugh(what);
        case ZOO: return zoo(what);
    }
}

double integral(enum Fun which, double lower, double upper, int n) {
    // Compute the integral of a function from lower to upper 
    // using Simpson's rule with n+1 points.
    double const h = (upper - lower) / n;
    double       s;
    double       t;
    int          i;
    
    s = 0.0;
    for (i = 0; i &lt; n; i++) s += call(which, (lower + h/2.0) + h*i);
    t = 0.0;
    for (i = 1; i &lt; n; i++) t += call(which, lower + h*i);
    return (call(which, lower) + call(which, upper) + s*4.0 + t*2.0) * (h/6.0);
}
</pre>

<p>Has obeying NASA's rule made the code more reliable?  No, it has made
the code <em>harder</em> to understand, <em>less</em> maintainable, and
<em>prone to a mistake</em> that it wasn't before.  Here's a call
illustrating the mistake:
</p><pre>x = integral(4, 0.0, 1.0, 10);</pre>
<p>I have checked this with two C compilers and a static checker at their
highest settings, and they are completely silent about this.

</p><p>So there are legitimate uses for function pointers, and simulating
them makes programs <em>worse</em>, not better.

</p><p>Now <a name="ppar" id="ppar">this wasn't an issue</a> in Fortran,
Algol 60, or Pascal.  Those languages had procedure <em>parameters</em>
but not procedure <em>pointers</em>. You could pass a subprogram name as
a parameter, and such a parameter could be passed on, but you could not
store them in variables.  You could have a <em>subset</em> of C which
allowed function pointer parameters, but made all function pointer
variables read-only.  That would give you a statically checkable subset
of C that allowed integral().

</p><p>The other use of function pointers is simulating object-orientation.
Imagine for example
</p><pre>struct Channel {
    void (*send)(struct Channel *, Message const *);
    bool (*recv)(struct Channel *, Message *);
    ...
};
inline void send(struct Channel *c, Message const *m) {
    c-&gt;send(c, m);
}
inline bool recv(struct Channel *c, Message *m) {
    return c-&gt;recv(c, m);
}
</pre>
<p>This lets us use a common interface for sending and receiving
messages on different kinds of channels.  This approach has been
used extensively in operating systems (at least as far back as
the Burroughs MCP in the 1960s) to decouple the code that uses
a device from the actual device driver.     I would expect any
program that controls more than one hardware device to do something
like this.  It's one of our key tools for controlling complexity.
</p><p>Again, we can simulate this, but it makes adding a new kind of
channel harder than it should be, and the code is <em>worse</em>
when we do it, not better.

</p><p>The rule against more than one level of dereferencing is also
an assault on good programming.  One of the key ideas that was
developed in the 1960s is the idea of <em>abstract data types</em>;
the idea that it should be possible for one module to define a
data type and operations on it and another module to use instances
of that data type and its operations <em>without having to know
anything about what the data type is</em>.
</p><p>One of the things I detest about Java is that it spits in the
face of the people who worked out that idea.  Yes, Java (now) has
generic type parameters, and that's good, but you cannot use a
<em>specific</em> type without knowing what that type is.

</p><p>Suppose I have a module that offers operations
</p><ul>
<li>stash(item) → token
</li><li>recall(token) → item
</li><li>delete(token) → void
</li></ul>
<p>And suppose that I have two interfaces in mind.  One of them
uses integers as tokens.
</p><pre>// stasher.h, version 1.
typedef int token;
extern token stash(item);
extern item  recall(token);
extern void  delete(token);
</pre>
<p>Another uses pointers as tokens.
</p><pre>// stasher.h, version 2.
typedef struct Hidden *token;
extern  token stash(item);
extern  item  recall(token);
extern  void  delete(token);
</pre>
<p>Now let's have a client.
</p><pre>void snoo(token *ans, item x, item y) {
    if (better(x, y)) {
	*ans = stash(x);
    } else {
	*ans = stash(y);
    }
}
</pre>
<p>By the NASA rule, the function snoo() would not be accepted or rejected on
its own merits.  With stasher.h, version 1, it would be accepted.
With stasher.h, version 2, it would be rejected.

</p><p>One reason to prefer version 2 to version 1 is that version 2 gets
more use out of type checking.  There are ever so many ways to get an
int in C.  Ask yourself if it ever makes sense to do
</p><pre>token t1 = stash(x);
token t2 = stash(y);
delete(t1*t2);
</pre>

<p>I really do not like the idea of banning abstract data types.

</p><h3>10.  All code must be compiled, from the first day of development,
with all compiler warnings enabled at the compiler’s
most pedantic setting.  All code must compile with these setting without
any warnings.  All code must be checked daily with at least one, but
preferably more than one, state-of-the-art static source code analyzer
and should pass the analyses with zero warnings.</h3>

<p>This one is good advice.  Rule 9 is really about making your code
worse in order to get more benefit from limited static checkers.  (Since
C has no standard way to construct new functions at run time, the set of
functions that a particular function pointer <em>could</em> point to can
be determined by a fixed-point data flow analysis, at least for most
programs.)  So is rule 1.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Daniel Tsai, Mayor Daniel Lurie’s choice to lead the Department of Public Health, has a blue-chip résumé: After studying at Harvard University, he landed a prestigious consulting gig before jumping into government, leading Medicaid programs in Massachusetts, then federally under former President Joe Biden.&nbsp;</p><p>Along the way, Tsai, in his capacity as an employee with McKinsey &amp; Company, helped to market a powerful painkiller called tramadol during the company’s years-long streak of pushing opioid sales. The company’s actions ultimately led to a criminal probe, more than $1 billion in settlements, and a public mea culpa over its role in fueling an overdose epidemic that has killed more than 500,000 Americans over 25 years.</p><p>Tsai’s actions at McKinsey are detailed in a tranche of documents that were released as part of a settlement with the consulting firm in which it was accused of accelerating opioid sales despite growing awareness of the risks.&nbsp;</p><p>The records show that Tsai —&nbsp;who worked for McKinsey from 2007 to 2015, according to his LinkedIn page — helped develop a marketing strategy for tramadol sold under the brand name Ultram ER, an effort that involved cultivating relationships with doctors who became prolific prescribers. The records are housed at the <a href="https://www.industrydocuments.ucsf.edu/opioids">UCSF-JHU Opioid Industry Documents Archive</a>.</p><p>In a March 2008 PowerPoint presentation, Tsai outlined a marketing strategy for the drug that included guidance on targeting “specific physician segments to grow high-prescriber group (i.e., physicians more sensitive to patient needs)” and an idea to introduce “coupons” for the drug as part of a pilot program.</p></div><figure id=""><div><p><span><span></span><img alt="A booth with &amp;quot;McKinsey &amp;amp; Company&amp;quot; in bright letters on a wooden panel.

In a statement, the mayor’s office wrote, “Nearly 20 years ago, Dan Tsai was a 23-year-old entry-level staffer assigned to conduct research for a project at work. He has spent nearly his entire two-decade career supporting those struggling with homelessness and addiction and helping tens of millions of our most vulnerable neighbors access critical medical care, and he will continue that work in San Francisco.”</p><p>Several drug and homelessness service providers in the city said they were disappointed by a lack of transparency surrounding Tsai’s appointment process. The revelation of his past role at McKinsey intensified those concerns, they said.&nbsp;</p><p>“You’d want a public health official of that caliber to articulate what his participation was in that role,” said Laura Guzman, director of the National Harm Reduction Coalition. “This is an important moment to bring in people with federal bureaucracy expertise. But if [Lurie] wants to address the lack of treatment, we need leadership with expertise in evidence-based interventions.”</p><p>Others were less diplomatic in their reaction to the news.</p><p>“Holy fucking shit,” said Liza Murawski, co-chair of the city’s Behavioral Health Commission, when told of Tsai’s role at McKinsey. “Why would he be the director? Why don’t you have someone in there who’s a mental health expert?”</p><p>It wasn’t immediately clear who Tsai’s client was when he was marketing Ultram ER. The brand, which has been discontinued, was developed by a Canadian company and licensed to a subsidiary of Johnson &amp; Johnson in 2005, <a href="https://pharmatimes.com/news/orthos_ultram_er_reaches_us_market_996469/">according to PharmaTimes</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Experts say tramadol was initially thought to be less harmful than OxyContin, another product McKinsey marketed for Purdue Pharma. But that view has changed.&nbsp;</p><p>Tramadol is a Schedule IV drug — in the same category as Xanax, Valium, and Ambien — and has <a href="https://www.voanews.com/a/report-highly-potent-opioids-now-showing-up-in-drug-users-in-africa/7653980.html">more</a> <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-44306086">recently</a> <a href="https://www.occrp.org/en/news/un-report-tramadol-use-in-africa-is-increasing">been</a> linked to addiction in Africa. “It was seen as this alternative,” said Dr. Rachel Sussman, a South Bay-based addiction medicine specialist. “It is just as risky and just as dependency-creating as any other opioid medication.” In fact, the drug carries more complications than some other opioids, including a risk of seizure and negative interactions with antidepressants, said Sussman.</p></div><figure id=""><div><p><span><span></span><img alt="Two men in suits stand near a podium.

The main reason I say tramadol is a minor player is because it wasn’t prescribed like candy, like OxyContin was.”</p><p>McKinsey’s method of targeting high-volume prescribers was part of its playbook to juice opioid sales, despite mounting evidence that the drugs could be highly addictive. In other emails uncovered in the McKinsey documents, employees wrote excitedly about finding doctors who were willing to write opioid prescriptions. <a href="https://www.industrydocuments.ucsf.edu/opioids/docs/#id=hlmn0255">In one instance</a> in 2015, a McKinsey partner wrote, “The challenge which we need to start working on is to identify the sweet spot of docs so we can do targeting. … Fun be[g]ins on Monday!”</p><p>San Francisco’s fentanyl crisis is part of a broader trend of opioid overdoses <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/overdose-prevention/about/understanding-the-opioid-overdose-epidemic.html">that traces back to the 1990s,</a> when prescription opioids became popular among doctors for chronic pain management. Companies such as Purdue Pharma, which manufactured OxyContin, brought in consulting firms like McKinsey to help with sales strategies. After a Department of Justice probe and settlement, McKinsey <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-ma/media/1380236/dl">acknowledged that it knew</a> the dangers of OxyContin but continued working with Purdue Pharma — even after several of the drugmaker’s executives pled guilty in 2007 to misrepresenting addiction risks.&nbsp;</p><p>McKinsey, along with a slew of drug companies and pharmacies, agreed to pay billions in settlement funds over their roles in fueling opioid addiction. California received <a href="https://oag.ca.gov/news/press-releases/attorney-general-becerra-announces-573-million-nationwide-settlement-mckinsey">roughly $60 million</a> from the 2021 McKinsey settlement.

The role paid $546,133 in 2024, one of the highest city salaries.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>On Monday, the San Francisco Health Commission unanimously nominated Tsai as director of Public Heath. Dr. Laurie Green, president of the commission, said the governing body conducted a “multi-hour” interview.</p></div><div><p>“In the interview with Mr. Tsai, the Health Commissioners focused on his preparedness to address the current public health challenges facing San Franciscans and his ability to sustain the Department through a potential tumultuous time ahead,” Green wrote in a statement. “This includes his unique expertise in Medicaid funding and programs, in addition to healthcare innovations and transformation.”</p><p>Tsai is expected to work with <a href="https://sfstandard.com/opinion/2025/01/07/the-fresh-faces-in-luries-cabinet-will-have-vast-power-but-will-they-know-how-to-wield-it/">Kunal Modi</a>, another McKinsey alum, whom Lurie has tapped to lead the city’s response to health and homelessness. In a statement this week, Tsai highlighted&nbsp;the city’s opioid and homelessness crises and said he was looking forward “to partnering with stakeholders and individuals with lived experience to find new, data-driven approaches to tackling this important challenge.”</p><p>Representatives of McKinsey did not respond to a request for comment.</p><div id=""><p>Richard Beal, director of recovery services at the Tenderloin Housing Clinic, said he appreciates Lurie’s early focus on the fentanyl crisis and remains optimistic about Tsai’s appointment.</p><p>“Just like [Tsai] distributed the drugs, maybe he can distribute the solution to the drugs,” Beal said. “Hopefully, he can use the knowledge he has from helping to create the monster to figure out how to solve it.”</p></div></div></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>WASHINGTON — National Nuclear Security Administration officials on Friday attempted to notify some employees who had been let go the day before that they are now due to be reinstated — but they struggled to find them because they didn’t have their new contact information.</p><p>In an email sent to employees at NNSA and obtained by NBC News, officials wrote, “The termination letters for some NNSA probationary employees are being rescinded, but we do not have a good way to get in touch with those personnel.”</p><p>The individuals the letter refers to had been fired on Thursday and lost access to their federal government email accounts. NNSA, which is within the Department of Energy and oversees the nation’s nuclear stockpile, cannot reach these employees directly and is now asking recipients of the email, “Please work with your supervisors to send this information (once you get it) to people’s personal contact emails.”</p><p>The Department of Energy did not immediately respond to an NBC News request for comment.</p><p>President Donald Trump’s administration has acted with unprecedented speed — and in some cases, <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/week-legal-setbacks-one-big-win-trumps-agenda-rcna192032" target="_blank">questionable legality</a> — in seeking to cut large portions of the federal government, laying off staff and ending contracts. But that speed has resulted in complications, including firing people agencies actually want to keep.</p><p>The emails come after multiple staff — all civil servants — at the NNSA <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/live-blog/live-updates-trump-tariffs-ukraine-russia-rcna191174/rcrd73096?canonicalCard=true" target="_blank">received termination notices</a> late Thursday, according to a source with direct knowledge of the notifications. NBC News reviewed the termination notification, which included the subject line: “Notification of Termination During Probationary/Trial Period.”</p><p>The NNSA is tasked with designing, building and overseeing the U.S. nuclear weapons stockpile.</p><p>The termination notices, which read “effective today,” came within hours of a Russian drone striking the Chernobyl power plant in Ukraine. NNSA tracks nuclear risks in Ukraine, including through sensor systems.</p><p>The NNSA saga comes as the Trump administration <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/doge/government-layoffs-trump-firings-department-probationary-employees-rcna192307" target="_blank">executed mass firings</a> throughout the federal government this week, primarily slashing the jobs of employees categorized as “probationary.”</p><p>Some departments saw massive numbers of layoffs, like the Department of Homeland Security, where over 400 people were told that their jobs were cut.</p><p>An NNSA nuclear safety specialist fired Thursday because she was a two-year probationary employee told NBC News she was still locked out of her email, but her manager had called to inform her that her “termination was rescinded” and to report to work on Tuesday.</p><p>“I will be honest, I intend to keep looking for work,” the employee said. “I will go back, but as soon as I find another role, I’ll be leaving.”</p><p>Asked why she will still look for employment elsewhere, she said that she has “no faith I will keep my job.”</p><p>The move comes as Trump and one of his top advisers, tech mogul Elon Musk, seek to slash the size of the federal government.</p><p>The federal cuts have been met with pushback from Democrats, labor unions and progressive organizations. <a href="https://www.justsecurity.org/107087/tracker-litigation-legal-challenges-trump-administration/" target="_blank">More than 60 lawsuits</a>&nbsp;against the Trump administration alleging executive overreach and other violations are pending.</p></div><div><div data-activity-map="expanded-byline-article-bottom"><div data-testid="byline-thumbnail"><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/author/peter-alexander-ncpn945076" tabindex="-1"><picture data-testid="picture"><source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-60x60,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/newscms/2024_36/3661284/240904-peter-alexander.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-60x60,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2024_36/3661284/240904-peter-alexander.jpg 1x"><img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-60x60,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2024_36/3661284/240904-peter-alexander.jpg" alt="" height="48" width="48"></picture></a></div><p><span data-testid="byline-name"><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/author/peter-alexander-ncpn945076">Peter Alexander</a></span><span><a href="mailto:peter.alexander@nbcuni.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span></span></a></span></p><p>Peter Alexander is chief White House correspondent for NBC News.</p></div><div data-activity-map="expanded-byline-article-bottom"><div data-testid="byline-thumbnail"><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/author/alexandra-marquez-ncpn1256666" tabindex="-1"><picture data-testid="picture"><source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-60x60,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/newscms/2024_38/3662645/240613-alexandra-sasha-marquez.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-60x60,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2024_38/3662645/240613-alexandra-sasha-marquez.jpg 1x"><img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-60x60,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2024_38/3662645/240613-alexandra-sasha-marquez.jpg" alt="" height="48" width="48"></picture></a></div><p><span data-testid="byline-name"><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/author/alexandra-marquez-ncpn1256666">Alexandra Marquez</a></span><span><a href="https://x.com/alexandramrqz" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span></span></a><a href="mailto:alexandra.marquez@nbcuni.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span></span></a></span></p><p>Alexandra Marquez is a politics reporter for NBC News.</p></div><div><p>Kevin Collier</p><!-- --><p> and </p><!-- --><p>Daniel Arkin</p><!-- --> <!-- --><p>contributed</p><!-- --><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></description>
