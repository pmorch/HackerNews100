		<h3>Welcome!</h3>
<p>Visopsys is an alternative operating system for PC compatible computers. In development since 1997, this system is small, fast, and open source. It features a simple but functional graphical interface, pre-emptive multitasking, and virtual memory. Though it attempts to be compatible in a number of ways, Visopsys is not a clone of any other operating system. You can demo the distribution from a “live” USB stick, CD/DVD, or floppy disk … (<a href="https://visopsys.org/about/">read more</a>).</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sailfish OS’s heritage lies in Nokia times, especially in the MeeGo operating system. Prior to 2011 Nokia and Intel had a vision of an open mobile operating system. Together they invested around 1 billion USD to the project and created an open source based operating system called MeeGo, which was used as a basis for several devices, such as the iconic Nokia N9. Although the Nokia N9 became the beacon of open source operating systems, Nokia decided to end the project and chose instead to continue with Microsoft’s Windows Phone OS. The rest of that is another story.</p>
<p>The passionate team behind MeeGo refused to quit working on the project they’ve believed in. They, or currently ‘we’ saved MeeGo by setting up a new company, Jolla Ltd., to develop the swipe-based MeeGo into the flowing user experience that is Sailfish OS. We quickly enhanced Sailfish OS to run Android apps and it became hardware compatible with Android chipsets. In November 2013, we launched the beta version of Sailfish OS to the market with the Jolla smartphone. Shortly after this, we released Sailfish OS version 1.0 and the first Sailfish OS product, the Jolla smartphone entered 36 markets during one year. In 2015, Sailfish OS 2.0. was released along with the Jolla Tablet, and a strengthened focus on the company’s licensing strategy.</p>
<p>In 2018 Sailfish OS matured to its third generation offering a packetized, secure solution for various corporate and governmental environments, and a smooth and secure mobile OS for tech-savvy consumers through the Sailfish X community program.&nbsp;The fourth generation, Sailfish 4, introduced in February 2021, boasts a multitude of new enablers to support different ecosystem projects, be it private corporate solutions or public sector governmental deployments.</p></div></div>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://helix-editor.vercel.app/start-here/basics/">https://helix-editor.vercel.app/start-here/basics/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45784596">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <p>To get started check out the <a href="https://helix-editor.vercel.app/start-here/installation">installation instructions</a> in order to follow along with the tutorial.</p>
<h3 id="opening-a-file"><a href="#opening-a-file">Opening a file</a></h3>
<p>Create a new text file and open it with Helix by running <code dir="auto">hx file.txt</code>. This is what you’ll see:</p>
<pre><span>  </span><span><span color="#DBBFEF">  1</span></span><span>  </span><span><span color="#3B224C"> </span></span><span>                        </span>
<span>  </span><span><span color="#5A5977">  ~</span></span><span>  </span><span><span color="#5A5977"> </span></span><span>                        </span>
<span><span color="#DBBFEF"> NOR   file.txt      1 sel  1:1 </span></span>
<span><span color="#A4A0E8">Loaded 1 file.</span></span><span>                  </span>
</pre>
<p>Notice the <code dir="auto">NOR</code> in the bottom-left corner, this indicates that you are currently in Normal mode. In this mode, typing letters like <kbd>e</kbd> and <kbd>n</kbd> won’t insert them as text, but rather have specific <em>commands</em> which we will explore later.</p>
<p>To actually insert some text, press <kbd>i</kbd>, which is the command to get into Insert mode, indicated by the <code dir="auto">INS</code> in the bottom-left corner. In this mode, the letters you type will be inserted directly into the document.</p>
<p>Try it out by writing <code dir="auto">Hello helix!</code>.</p>
<pre><span>  </span><span><span color="#DBBFEF">  1</span></span><span>  </span><span><span color="#A4A0E8">Hello</span></span><span><span color="#5A5977"> </span></span><span><span color="#A4A0E8">helix!</span></span><span><span color="#5A5977"> </span></span><span>            </span>
<span>  </span><span><span color="#5A5977">  ~</span></span><span>  </span><span><span color="#5A5977"> </span></span><span>                        </span>
<span><span color="#DBBFEF"> INS   file.txt [+] 1 sel  1:13 </span></span>
<span>                                </span>
</pre>
<p>To get back into Normal mode press <kbd>Esc</kbd>. This will change the color of your cursor and you will see <code dir="auto">NOR</code> again, indicating that you are in normal mode now.</p>
<h3 id="movement"><a href="#movement">Movement</a></h3>
<p>To move your cursor you could use arrow keys, both in Normal and Insert modes:</p>
<ul>
<li><kbd>↑</kbd> move cursor up</li>
<li><kbd>↓</kbd> move cursor down</li>
<li><kbd>→</kbd> moves cursor right</li>
<li><kbd>←</kbd> moves cursor left</li>
</ul>
<p>However, this isn’t encouraged due to the fact that hand will be doing a lot of back-and-forth movement between the arrow keys and the keyboard.</p>
<p>Instead, it is recommended to rest your fingers on the “home row”, which is comprised of the row of keys <code dir="auto">a s d f g h j k l</code>.</p>
<p>Instead of stretching to reach the arrow keys, use normal mode and <kbd>h</kbd>, <kbd>j</kbd>, <kbd>k</kbd> and <kbd>l</kbd> to move your cursor:</p>
<ul>
<li><kbd>h</kbd>: moves cursor 1 character to the left.</li>
<li><kbd>j</kbd>: moves cursor 1 line above.</li>
<li><kbd>k</kbd>: moves cursor 1 line below.</li>
<li><kbd>l</kbd>: moves cursor 1 character to the right.</li>
</ul>
<p>Try holding down <kbd>h</kbd> and <kbd>l</kbd> to move horizontally across the text you just wrote!</p>

<h3 id="paste"><a href="#paste">Paste</a></h3>
<p>We only have one line of text, so let’s duplicate it several times. Type:</p>
<ul>
<li><kbd>x</kbd>, which will select the entire line.</li>
<li><kbd>y</kbd>, which will <em><strong>y</strong>ank</em> (copy) the selection to clipboard.</li>
<li><kbd>p</kbd>, which will paste the contents of the selection after the cursor.</li>
</ul>
<p>Spam <kbd>p</kbd> a few times to create several lines.</p>

<p><kbd>e</kbd> is a motion which moves to the <em><strong>e</strong>nd</em> of the current word. Type <kbd>e</kbd> and it will move your cursor to the end of the <code dir="auto">helix</code>.</p>
<p>It doesn’t just move your cursor there, though. The entire <code dir="auto">helix</code> word becomes highlighted:</p>

<p>Helix’s philosophy is that each <strong>action</strong> will act on a selection.</p>
<p>Every time text is modified (an <strong>action</strong>), you will fully anticipate the result — because you can clearly see the area of text which is highlighted, and thus will be modified.</p>
<p>For example, we currently have the word <code dir="auto">helix</code> selected. To change it to <code dir="auto">world</code>, press <kbd>c</kbd>,</p>

<h3 id="replace"><a href="#replace">Replace</a></h3>
<p>You can also replace a selection with contents of a register.</p>
<ol>
<li>Select the <code dir="auto">moon</code> word by using <kbd>gw</kbd> and yank it with <kbd>y</kbd>.</li>
<li>Select the <code dir="auto">sun</code> word and replace it with <code dir="auto">moon</code> with <kbd>R</kbd>.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="search"><a href="#search">Search</a></h3>
<p>Go to the first line by using <kbd>gg</kbd>.</p>
<p>To search for a word, use <kbd>/</kbd> command. Type <code dir="auto">will</code> which is going to highlight the next <code dir="auto">will</code> keyword, and then <kbd>Enter ↵</kbd> to select it.</p>
<p>Since there are several <code dir="auto">will</code>s in the text, you can cycle between them:</p>
<ul>
<li><kbd>n</kbd> cycles to the next match.</li>
<li><kbd>N</kbd> cycles to the previous match.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="more-ways-to-enter-insert-mode"><a href="#more-ways-to-enter-insert-mode">More ways to enter Insert Mode</a></h3>
<p>Select the <code dir="auto">clouds</code> word using <kbd>gw</kbd>. If you press <kbd>i</kbd>, you will go into insert mode at the beginning of the selection. There are also 5 more ways to enter Insert mode:</p>
<ul>
<li><kbd>a</kbd> for <em><strong>append</strong></em> go into insert mode at the end of the selection</li>
<li><kbd>I</kbd> go into insert mode at the beginning of the current line</li>
<li><kbd>A</kbd> to append at the end of the current line</li>
<li><kbd>o</kbd> add a newline below and go into insert mode</li>
<li><kbd>O</kbd> add a newline above and go into insert mode</li>
</ul>
<p>Try all of them out!</p>
<h3 id="registers"><a href="#registers">Registers</a></h3>
<p>Helix has a concept called <em>registers</em>, which is like having many clipboards at once.</p>
<p>To interact with them, prefix yank and delete commands with a <kbd>”</kbd> and then the name of the register.</p>
<p>For example, the contents of the system clipboard are stored inside the <code dir="auto">+</code> register.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>Paste the following content into the file with <kbd>“+p</kbd>:</p>
<div><figure><pre data-language="plaintext"><code><div><p><span>The plates will</span></p></div><div><p><span>and the clouds will</span></p></div><div><p><span>The sun will</span></p></div><div><p><span>and the moon will</span></p></div></code></pre></figure></div>

	<h3>Airport facial recognition system long criticised</h3>
<p>The Czech Republic Police used a camera system with facial recognition capabilities at Václav Havel Airport in Prague <strong>from 2018, until it was shut down in August 2025</strong>. The system enabled real-time recognition of the faces of people passing through the airport. Their so-called bio-indexes, or, simply put, facial contours converted into numbers, were compared with a database of wanted or missing persons.</p>
<p>EDRi member <a href="https://edri.org/our-work/big-brother-at-the-prague-airport-the-state-refuses-to-explain-how-the-biometric-camera-system-works/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">IuRe drew attention to the situation</a> back in 2021. At the time, IuRe lawyers argued that the processing of biometric data in Czechia is only possible on the basis of explicit permission granted by a special law. IuRe ultimately filed a complaint with the Czech Data Protection Authority (DPA), requesting an investigation. The result of the inspection, which IuRe requested in the summer of 2025 under the Freedom of Information Act, <strong>confirmed the suspicion of a violation of personal data protection legislation.</strong></p>
<h3>Biometric surveillance ended thanks to the AI Act</h3>
<p>Criticism of the facial recognition system only increased after the AI Act came into force because the law explicitly requires judicial approval for each use of such a system, which wasn’t provided for the airport.</p>
<p>Therefore, since the specific portion of the AI Act related to biometric surveillance came into force in February 2025, till the airport facial recognition systém was shut down in August 2025, the police’s use of this system was illegal. It was in operation despite the fact that the police had been <strong>repeatedly warned of its illegality</strong> and the <a href="https://www.irozhlas.cz/zpravy-domov/na-prazske-letiste-se-maji-vratit-kamery-s-detekci-tvari-novelu-musi-posvetit_2506041432_dci" target="_blank" rel="noopener">media had also taken an interest</a> in the matter.</p>
<h3>Set clear boundaries for the police</h3>
<p>The inspection by the Czech DPA took <strong>almost four years</strong>. During that time, no effective action was taken. However, the results are clear: police need to be given <strong>clear guidelines for processing biometric data</strong>, which should be enshrined in laws approved by elected representatives of the people and thus subject to public scrutiny. The current situation, apart from violating European legislation, creates a <strong>fertile ground for various forms of abuse of these technologies</strong>.</p>
<h3>The police systematically violate laws when processing biometric data</h3>
<p>The Czech police are also ignoring the law in the case of another biometric tool – Digital Personal Image Information System. This was also <a href="https://edri.org/our-work/czech-police-use-facial-recognition-system-iure-finds-out-details/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pointed out by IuRe</a> and subsequently by the Czech DPA. The system works with a reference database of <strong>approximately 20 million photographs of all persons</strong> who have been issued identity cards or passports, and compares them with photographs of persons of unknown identity.</p>
<p>This makes it possible to trace their probable identity retrospectively. According to the police, the system is used, for example, to identify the deceased. However, <strong>the same system can also be concievably used to identify people participating in demonstrations</strong>.</p>
<p>The obvious systemic problems with the use of facial recognition tools by the police should therefore be a matter of concern for the new Czech Minister of the Interior, who should initiate a <strong>review of the legislation</strong>. The current national legislation <strong>does not comply</strong> with the European directive in terms of legal safeguards for the processing of biometric data.</p>
<p>IuRe will continue to monitor biometric surveillance in Czechia, thanks in part to financial support from the public received through their informational website about biometric surveillance called <a href="http://cnc.iure.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Czechia is not China</a>. The website was created with the support of EDRi and was linked to a crowdfunding campaign.</p>

            <!-- buttondown-editor-mode: plaintext -->
<p>Over the past few days I wrote a new Go implementation of ML-DSA, a post-quantum signature algorithm specified by NIST last summer. I <a href="https://twitch.tv/filosottile">livecoded</a> it all over four days, finishing it on Thursday evening. Except… Verify was always rejecting valid signatures.</p>
<pre><code>$ bin/go test crypto/internal/fips140/mldsa
--- FAIL: TestVector (0.00s)
    mldsa_test.go:47: Verify: mldsa: invalid signature
    mldsa_test.go:84: Verify: mldsa: invalid signature
    mldsa_test.go:121: Verify: mldsa: invalid signature
FAIL
FAIL     crypto/internal/fips140/mldsa   2.142s
FAIL
</code></pre>
<p>I was exhausted, so I tried debugging for half an hour and then gave up, with the intention of coming back to it the next day with a fresh mind.</p>
<p>On a whim, I figured I would let Claude Code take a shot while I read emails and resurfaced from hyperfocus. I mostly expected it to flail in some maybe-interesting way, or rule out some issues.</p>
<p>Instead, it rapidly figured out a fairly complex low-level bug in my implementation of a relatively novel cryptography algorithm. I am sharing this because it made me realize I still don’t have a good intuition for when to invoke AI tools, and because I think it’s a fantastic case study for anyone who’s still skeptical about their usefulness.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Full disclosure: Anthropic gave me a few months of Claude Max for free. They reached out one day and told me they were giving it away to some open source maintainers. Maybe it’s a ploy to get me hooked so I’ll pay for it when the free coupon expires. Maybe they hoped I’d write something like this. Maybe they are just nice. Anyway, they made no request or suggestion to write anything public about Claude Code. Now you know.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="finding-the-bug">Finding the bug</h2>
<p>I started Claude Code v2.0.28 with Opus 4.1 and no system prompts, and gave it the following prompt (typos included):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I implemented ML-DSA in the Go standard library, and it all works except that verification always rejects the signatures. I know the signatures are right because they match the test vector.</p>
<p>YOu can run the tests with “bin/go test crypto/internal/fips140/mldsa”</p>
<p>You can find the code in src/crypto/internal/fips140/mldsa</p>
<p>Look for potential reasons the signatures don’t verify. ultrathink</p>
<p>I spot-checked and w1 is different from the signing one.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To my surprise, it pinged me a few minutes later with <a href="https://go-review.googlesource.com/c/go/+/716540/1..2">a complete fix</a>.</p>
<p>Maybe I shouldn’t be surprised! Maybe it would have been clear to anyone more familiar with AI tools that this was a good AI task: a well-scoped issue with failing tests. On the other hand, this is a low-level issue in a fresh implementation of a complex, <em>relatively novel</em> algorithm.</p>
<p>It figured out that I had merged <code>HighBits</code> and <code>w1Encode</code> into a single function for using it from Sign, and then reused it from Verify where <code>UseHint</code> already produces the high bits, effectively taking the high bits of w1 twice in Verify.</p>
<p>Looking at <a href="https://gist.github.com/FiloSottile/d019f68db7143493c6a7e9c5fd08e872">the log</a>, it loaded the implementation into the context and then <em>immediately</em> figured it out, without any exploratory tool use! After that it wrote itself a cute little test that reimplemented half of verification to confirm the hypothesis, wrote a mediocre fix, and checked the tests pass.</p>
<p>I <a href="https://go-review.googlesource.com/c/go/+/716540/2..3">threw the fix away</a> and refactored <code>w1Encode</code> to take high bits as input, and changed the type of the high bits, which is both clearer and saves a round-trip through Montgomery representation. Still, this 100% saved me a bunch of debugging time.</p>
<h2 id="a-second-synthetic-experiment">A second synthetic experiment</h2>
<p>On Monday, I had also finished implementing signing with failing tests. There were two bugs, which I fixed in the following couple evenings.</p>
<p>The first one was due to <a href="https://go-review.googlesource.com/c/go/+/716240/1..2">somehow computing a couple hardcoded constants (1 and -1 in the Montgomery domain) wrong</a>. It was very hard to find, requiring a lot of deep printfs and guesswork. Took me maybe an hour or two.</p>
<p>The second one was easier: <a href="https://go-review.googlesource.com/c/go/+/716240/2..3">a value that ends up encoded in the signature was too short (32 bits instead of 32 bytes)</a>. It was relatively easy to tell because only the first four bytes of the signature were the same, and then the signature lengths were different.</p>
<p>I figured these would be an interesting way to validate Claude’s ability to help find bugs in low-level cryptography code, so I checked out the old version of the change with the bugs (yay Jujutsu!) and kicked off a fresh Claude Code session with this prompt:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I am implementing ML-DSA in the Go standard library, and I just finished implementing signing, but running the tests against a known good test vector it looks like it goes into an infinite loop, probably because it always rejects in the Fiat-Shamir with Aborts loop.</p>
<p>You can run the tests with “bin/go test crypto/internal/fips140/mldsa”</p>
<p>You can find the code in src/crypto/internal/fips140/mldsa</p>
<p>Figure out why it loops forever, and get the tests to pass. ultrathink</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It spent <a href="https://gist.github.com/FiloSottile/d16c37b2fada56875a894cdd2670a860">some time doing printf debugging and chasing down incorrect values very similarly to how I did it, and then figured out and fixed the wrong constants</a>. Took Claude definitely less than it took me. Impressive.</p>
<p>It gave up after fixing that bug even if the tests still failed, so I started a fresh session (on the assumption that the context on the wrong constants would do more harm than good investigating an independent bug), and gave it this prompt:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I am implementing ML-DSA in the Go standard library, and I just finished implementing signing, but running the tests against a known good test vector they don’t match.</p>
<p>You can run the tests with “bin/go test crypto/internal/fips140/mldsa”</p>
<p>You can find the code in src/crypto/internal/fips140/mldsa</p>
<p>Figure out what is going on. ultrathink</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://gist.github.com/FiloSottile/b184888663c5d57078dc90b1a019981b">It took a couple wrong paths, thought for quite a bit longer, and then found this one too</a>. I honestly expected it to fail initially.</p>
<p>It’s interesting how Claude found the “easier” bug more difficult. My guess is that maybe the large random-looking outputs of the failing tests did not play well with its attention.</p>
<p>The fix it proposed was updating only the allocation’s length and not its capacity, but whatever, the point is finding the bug, and I’ll usually want to throw away the fix and rewrite it myself anyway.</p>
<p>Three out of three one-shot debugging hits with no help is <em>extremely impressive</em>. Importantly, there is no need to trust the LLM or review its output when its job is just saving me an hour or two by telling me where the bug is, for me to reason about it and fix it.</p>
<p>As ever, I wish we had better tooling for using LLMs which didn’t look like chat or autocomplete or “make me a PR.” For example, how nice would it be if every time tests fail, an LLM agent was kicked off with the task of figuring out why, and only notified us if it did before we fixed it?</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-hpc="true"><article itemprop="text"><p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">nokode</h2><a id="user-content-nokode" aria-label="Permalink: nokode" href="#nokode"></a></p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>A web server with no application logic. Just an LLM with three tools.</strong></p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">The Shower Thought</h2><a id="user-content-the-shower-thought" aria-label="Permalink: The Shower Thought" href="#the-shower-thought"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">One day we won't need code. LLMs will output video at 120fps, sample inputs in realtime, and just... be our computers. No apps, no code, just intent and execution.</p>
<p dir="auto">That's science fiction.</p>
<p dir="auto">But I got curious: with a few hours this weekend and today's level of tech, how far can we get?</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">The Hypothesis</h2><a id="user-content-the-hypothesis" aria-label="Permalink: The Hypothesis" href="#the-hypothesis"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">I expected this to fail spectacularly.</p>
<p dir="auto">Everyone's focused on AI that writes code. You know the usual suspects, Claude Code, Cursor, Copilot, all that. But that felt like missing the bigger picture. So I built something to test a different question: what if you skip code generation entirely? A web server with zero application code. No routes, no controllers, no business logic. Just an HTTP server that asks an LLM "what should I do?" for every request.</p>
<p dir="auto">The goal: prove how far away we really are from that future.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">The Target</h2><a id="user-content-the-target" aria-label="Permalink: The Target" href="#the-target"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Contact manager. Basic CRUD: forms, database, list views, persistence.</p>
<p dir="auto">Why? Because most software is just CRUD dressed up differently. If this works at all, it would be something.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">The Experiment</h2><a id="user-content-the-experiment" aria-label="Permalink: The Experiment" href="#the-experiment"></a></p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="// The entire backend
const result = await generateText({
  model,
  tools: {
    database,      // Run SQL queries
    webResponse,   // Return HTML/JSON
    updateMemory   // Save user feedback
  },
  prompt: `Handle this HTTP request: ${method} ${path}`,
});"><pre><span>// The entire backend</span>

<p dir="auto">Three tools:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><strong><code>database</code></strong> - Execute SQL on SQLite. AI designs the schema.</li>
<li><strong><code>webResponse</code></strong> - Return any HTTP response. AI generates the HTML, JavaScript, JSON or whatever fits.</li>
<li><strong><code>updateMemory</code></strong> - Persist feedback to markdown. AI reads it on next request.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">The AI infers what to return from the path alone. Hit <code>/contacts</code> and you get an HTML page. Hit <code>/api/contacts</code> and you get JSON:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="// What the AI generates for /api/contacts
{
  &quot;contacts&quot;: [
    { &quot;id&quot;: 1, &quot;name&quot;: &quot;Alice&quot;, &quot;email&quot;: &quot;alice@example.com&quot; },
    { &quot;id&quot;: 2, &quot;name&quot;: &quot;Bob&quot;, &quot;email&quot;: &quot;bob@example.com&quot; }
  ]
}"><pre><span>// What the AI generates for /api/contacts</span>
<span>{</span>

  <span>]</span>
<span>}</span></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Every page has a feedback widget. Users type "make buttons bigger" or "use dark theme" and the AI implements it.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">The Results</h2><a id="user-content-the-results" aria-label="Permalink: The Results" href="#the-results"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">It works. That's annoying.</p>
<p dir="auto">Every click or form submission took 30-60 seconds. Traditional web apps respond in 10-100 milliseconds. That's 300-6000x slower. Each request cost $0.01-0.05 in API tokens—100-1000x more expensive than traditional compute. The AI spent 75-85% of its time reasoning, forgot what UI it generated 5 seconds ago, and when it hallucinated broken SQL that was an immediate 500 error. Colors drifted between requests. Layouts changed. I tried prompt engineering tricks like "⚡ THINK QUICKLY" and it made things slower because the model spent more time reasoning about how to be fast.</p>
<p dir="auto">But despite all that, forms actually submitted correctly. Data persisted across restarts. The UI was usable. APIs returned valid JSON. User feedback got implemented. The AI invented, without any examples, sensible database schemas with proper types and indexes, parameterized SQL queries that were safe from injection, REST-ish API conventions, responsive Bootstrap layouts, form validation, and error handling for edge cases. All emergent behavior from giving it three tools and a prompt.</p>
<p dir="auto">So yes, the capability exists. The AI can handle application logic. It's just catastrophically slow, absurdly expensive, and has the memory of a goldfish.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Screenshots</h2><a id="user-content-screenshots" aria-label="Permalink: Screenshots" href="#screenshots"></a></p>

<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">The Conclusion</h2><a id="user-content-the-conclusion" aria-label="Permalink: The Conclusion" href="#the-conclusion"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The capability exists. The AI can handle application logic.</p>
<p dir="auto">The problems are all performance: speed (300-6000x slower), cost (100-1000x more expensive), consistency (no design memory), reliability (hallucinations → errors).</p>
<p dir="auto">But these feel like problems of degree, not kind:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Inference: improving ~10x/year</li>
<li>Cost: heading toward zero</li>
<li>Context: growing (eventual design memory?)</li>
<li>Errors: dropping</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">But the fact that I built a working CRUD app with zero application code, despite it being slow and expensive, suggests we might be closer to "AI just does the thing" than "AI helps write code."</p>
<p dir="auto">In this project, what's left is infrastructure: HTTP setup, tool definitions, database connections. The application logic is gone. But the real vision? 120 inferences per second rendering displays with constant realtime input sampling. That becomes the computer. No HTTP servers, no databases, no infrastructure layer at all. Just intent and execution.</p>
<p dir="auto">I think we don't realize how much code, as a thing, is mostly transitional.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div dir="auto"><p>OpenAI is now set to become a Public Benefit Corporation, with its investors entitled to uncapped profit shares. Its nonprofit foundation will retain some measure of control and a 26% financial stake, in sharp contrast to its previous stronger control and much, much larger effective financial stake. The value transfer is in the hundreds of billions, thus potentially the largest theft in human history. </p><p>I say potentially largest because I realized one could argue that the events surrounding the dissolution of the USSR involved a larger theft. Unless you really want to stretch the definition of what counts this seems to be in the top two.</p><p><span>I am in no way surprised by OpenAI moving forward on this, but I am deeply disgusted and disappointed they are being allowed (for now) to do so, </span><a href="https://news.delaware.gov/2025/10/28/ag-jennings-completes-review-of-openai-recapitalization/#:~:text=Delaware%20secures%20structural%20reform%20and,.%2C%20a%20Delaware%20nonprofit%20corporation" rel="">including this statement of no action by Delaware</a><span> and t</span><a href="https://oag.ca.gov/system/files/attachments/press-docs/Final%20Executed%20MOU%20Between%20OpenAI%20and%20California%20AG%20re%20Notice%20of%20Conditions%20of%20Non-Objection%20%2810.27.2025%29%20%28Signed%20by%20OpenAI%29%20%28Signed%20by%20CA%20DOJ%29.pdf" rel="">his Memorandum of Understanding with California</a><span>.  </span></p><p><span>Many media and public sources are calling this a win for the nonprofit, </span><a href="https://x.com/AISafetyMemes/status/1983486800569229518" rel="">such as this from the San Francisco Chronicle</a><span>. This is mostly them being fooled. They’re anchoring on OpenAI’s previous plan to far more fully sideline the nonprofit. This is indeed a big win for the nonprofit compared to OpenAI’s previous plan. But the previous plan would have been a complete disaster, an all but total expropriation. </span></p><p>It’s as if a mugger demanded all your money, you talked them down to giving up half your money, and you called that exchange a ‘change that recapitalized you.’</p><p><span>As in, </span><a href="https://openai.com/index/built-to-benefit-everyone/" rel="">they claim OpenAI has ‘completed its recapitalization</a><span>’ and the nonprofit will now only hold equity OpenAI claims is valued at approximately $130 billion (as in 26% of the company, which is actually to be fair worth substantially more than that if they get away with this), as opposed to its previous status of holding the bulk of the profit interests in a company valued at (when you include the nonprofit interests) well over $500 billion, along with a presumed gutting of much of the nonprofit’s highly valuable control rights. </span></p><p>They claim this additional clause, presumably the foundation is getting warrants with but they don’t offer the details here:</p><blockquote><p>If OpenAI Group’s share price increases greater than tenfold after 15 years, the OpenAI Foundation will receive significant additional equity. With its equity stake and the warrant, the Foundation is positioned to be the single largest long-term beneficiary of OpenAI’s success.</p></blockquote><p>We don’t know that ‘significant’ additional equity means, there’s some sort of unrevealed formula going on, but given the nonprofit got expropriated last time I have no expectation that these warrants would get honored. We will be lucky if the nonprofit meaningfully retains the remainder of its equity.</p><p><a href="https://x.com/sama/status/1983182740666364113" rel="">Sam Altman’s statement on this is here, also announcing his livestream Q&amp;A</a><span> that took place on Tuesday afternoon. </span></p><p>There can be reasonable disagreements about exactly how much. It’s a ton.</p><p>There used to be a profit cap, where in Greg Brockman’s own words, ‘If we succeed, we believe we’ll create orders of magnitude more value than any existing company — in which case all but a fraction is returned to the world.’ </p><p>Well, so much for that.</p><p><span>I looked at this question in </span><strong><a href="https://thezvi.substack.com/p/the-mask-comes-off-at-what-price" rel="">The Mask Comes Off: At What Price</a></strong><span> a year ago. </span></p><p>If we take seriously that OpenAI is looking to go public at a $1 trillion valuation, then consider that Matt Levine estimated the old profit cap only going up to about $272 billion, and that OpenAI still is a bet on extreme upside. </p><blockquote><p><span>Garrison Lovely: UVA economist Anton Korinek has used standard economic models to </span><a href="https://www.genaiforecon.org/ValueAGI.pdf" rel="">estimate</a><span> that AGI could be worth anywhere from $1.25 to $71 quadrillion globally. If you take Korinek’s assumptions about OpenAI’s share, that would put the company’s value at $30.9 trillion. In this scenario, Microsoft would walk away with less than one percent of the total, with the overwhelming majority flowing to the nonprofit.</span></p><p><span>It’s tempting to dismiss these numbers as fantasy. But it’s a fantasy constructed in large part by OpenAI, when it </span><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/openai-warns-agi-money-obsolete-while-raising-billions-usd-2025-8" rel="">wrote</a><span> lines like, “it may be difficult to know what role money will play in a post-AGI world,” or when Altman </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzcJlKg2Rc0&amp;t=2734s" rel="">said</a><span> that if OpenAI succeeded at building AGI, it might “capture the light cone of all future value in the universe.” That, he said, “is for sure not okay for one group of investors to have.”</span></p></blockquote><p>I guess Altman is okay with that now?</p><p>Obviously you can’t base your evaluations on a projection that puts the company at a value of $30.9 trillion, and that calculation is deeply silly, for many overloaded and obvious reasons, including decreasing marginal returns to profits. </p><p>It is still true that most of the money OpenAI makes in possible futures, it makes as part of profits in excess of $1 trillion. </p><blockquote><p><a href="https://www.themidasproject.com/article-list/the-midas-project-statement-on-openai-s-restructuring" rel="">The Midas Project</a><span>: Thanks to the now-gutted profit caps, OpenAI’s nonprofit was already entitled to the vast majority of the company’s cash flows. </span><a href="https://openai.com/index/openai-lp/" rel="">According to OpenAI</a><span>, if they succeeded, “orders of magnitude” more money would go to the nonprofit than to investors. President Greg Brockman said “all but a fraction” of the money they earn would be returned to the world thanks to the profit caps.</span></p><p>Reducing that to 26% equity—even with a warrant (of unspecified value) that only activates if valuation increases tenfold over 15 years—represents humanity voluntarily surrendering tens or hundreds of billions of dollars it was already entitled to. Private investors are now entitled to dramatically more, and humanity dramatically less.</p><p><span>OpenAI is not suddenly one of the best-resourced nonprofits ever. From the public’s perspective, OpenAI may be one of the </span><em>worst</em><span> financially performing nonprofits in history, having voluntarily transferred more of the public’s entitled value to private interests than perhaps any charitable organization ever.</span></p></blockquote><p>I think Levine’s estimate was low at the time, and you also have to account for equity raised since then or that will be sold in the IPO, but it seems obvious that the majority of future profit interests were, prior to the conversion, still in the hands of the non-profit.</p><p>Even if we thought the new control rights were as strong as the old, we would still be looking at a theft in excess of $250 billion, and a plausible case can be made for over $500 billion. I leave the full calculation to others.</p><p>The vote in the board was unanimous. </p><p>I wonder exactly how and by who they will be sued over it, and what will become of that. Elon Musk, at a minimum, is trying. </p><p>They say behind every great fortune is a great crime. </p><p>Altman points out that the nonprofit could become the best-resourced non-profit in the world if OpenAI does well. This is true. There is quite a lot they were unable to steal. But it is beside the point, in that it does not make taking the other half, including changing the corporate structure without permission, not theft.</p><blockquote><p><a href="https://www.themidasproject.com/article-list/the-midas-project-statement-on-openai-s-restructuring" rel="">The Midas Project</a><span>: From the public’s perspective, OpenAI may be one of the worst financially performing nonprofits in history, having voluntarily transferred more of the public’s entitled value to private interests than perhaps any charitable organization ever.</span></p></blockquote><p>There’s no perhaps on that last clause. On this level, whether or not you agree with the term ‘theft,’ it isn’t even close, this is the largest transfer. Of course, if you take the whole of OpenAI’s nonprofit from inception, performance looks better.  </p><blockquote><p><a href="https://x.com/aidan_mclau/status/1983338894608495018" rel="">Aidan McLaughlin</a><span> (OpenAI):  ah yes openai now has the same greedy corporate structure as (checks notes) Patagonia, Anthropic, Coursera, and http://Change.org.</span></p><p>Chase Brower: well i think the concern was with the non profit getting a low share.</p><p>Aidan McLaughlin: our nonprofit is currently valued slightly less than all of anthropic.</p><p>Tyler Johnson: And according to OpenAI itself, it should be valued at approximately three Anthropics! (Fwiw I think the issues with the restructuring extend pretty far beyond valuations, but this is one of them!)</p></blockquote><p>Yes, it is true that the nonprofit, after the theft and excluding control rights, will have an on-paper valuation only slightly lower than the on-paper value of all of Anthropic. </p><p>The $500 billion valuation excludes the non-profit’s previous profit share, so even if you think the nonprofit was treated fairly and lost no control rights you would then have it be worth $175 billion rather than $130 billion, so yes slightly less than Anthropic, and if you acknowledge that the nonprofit got stolen from it’s even more.</p><p><a href="https://x.com/tszzl/status/1983602123834343484" rel="">If OpenAI can successfully go public at a $1 trillion valuation</a><span>, then depending on how much of that are new shares they will be selling the nonprofit could be worth up to $260 billion.</span></p><p>What about some of the comparable governance structures here?  Coursera does seem to be a rather straightforward B-corp. The others don’t?</p><p>Patagonia has the closely held Patagonia Purpose Trust, which holds 2% of shares and 100% of voting control, and The Holdfast Collective, which is a 501c(4) nonprofit with 98% of the shares and profit interests. The Chouinard family has full control over the company, and 100% of profits go to charitable causes. </p><p>Does that sound like OpenAI’s new corporate structure to you?</p><p>Change.org’s nonprofit owns 100% of its PBC.</p><p>Does that sound like OpenAI’s new corporate structure to you? </p><p>Anthropic is a PBC, but also has the Long Term Benefit Trust. One can argue how meaningfully different this is from OpenAI’s new corporate structure, if you disregard who is involved in all of this. </p><p><a href="https://x.com/BjarturTomas/status/1983183247795507298" rel="">What the new structure definitely is distinct from is the original intention:</a></p><blockquote><p>Tomas Bjartur: If not in the know, OpenAI once promised any profits over a threshold would be gifted to you, citizen of the world, for your happy, ultra-wealthy retirement - one needed as they plan to obsolete you. This is now void. </p></blockquote><p><span>Would OpenAI have been able to raise further investment </span><a href="https://www.obsolete.pub/p/breaking-openai-alums-nobel-laureates" rel="">without withdrawing its profit caps for investments already made?</a><span> </span></p><p>When you put it like that it seems like obviously yes? </p><p>I can see the argument that to raise funds going forward, future equity investments need to not come with a cap. Okay, fine. That doesn’t mean you hand past investors, including Microsoft, hundreds of billions in value in exchange for nothing. </p><p>One can argue this was necessary to overcome other obstacles, that OpenAI had already allowed itself to be put in a stranglehold another way and had no choice. But the fundraising story does not make sense. </p><p>The argument that OpenAI had to ‘complete its recapitalization’ or risk being asked for its money back is even worse. Investors who put in money at under $200 billion are going to ask for a refund when the valuation is now at $500 billion? Really? If so, wonderful, I know a great way to cut them that check.</p><p>I am deeply disappointed that both the Delaware and California attorneys general found this deal adequate on equity compensation for the nonprofit. </p><p>I am however reasonably happy with the provisions on control rights, which seem about as good as one can hope for given the decision to convert to a PBC. I can accept that the previous situation was not sustainable in practice given prior events.</p><p>The new provisions include an ongoing supervisory role for the California AG, and extensive safety veto points for the NFP and the SSC committee. </p><p>If I was confident that these provisions would be upheld, and especially if I was confident their spirit would be upheld, then this is actually pretty good, and if it is used wisely and endures it is more important than their share of the profits.</p><blockquote><p>AG Bonta: We will be keeping a close eye on OpenAI to ensure ongoing adherence to its charitable mission and the protection of the safety of all Californians.</p></blockquote><p>The nonprofit will indeed retain substantial resources and influence, but no I do not expect the public safety mission to dominate the OpenAI enterprise. Indeed, contra the use of the word ‘ongoing,’ it seems clear that it already had ceased to do so, and this seems obvious to anyone tracking OpenAI’s activities, including many recent activities. </p><p><a href="https://openai.com/our-structure/" rel="">What is the new control structure?</a><span> </span></p><p><a href="https://news.delaware.gov/2025/10/28/ag-jennings-completes-review-of-openai-recapitalization/#:~:text=Delaware%20secures%20structural%20reform%20and,.%2C%20a%20Delaware%20nonprofit%20corporation" rel="">OpenAI did not say, but the Delaware AG tells us more</a><span> and the California AG has additional detail.

The committee will have the authority to oversee and review the safety and security processes and practices of OpenAI and its controlled affiliates with respect to model development and deployment. It will have the power and authority to require mitigation measures—up to and including halting the release of models or AI systems—even where the applicable risk thresholds would otherwise permit release.</p></li><li><p>The Chair of the Safety and Security Committee will be a director on the NFP Board and will not be a member of the PBC Board. Initially, this will be the current committee chair, Mr. Zico Kolter. As chair, he will have full observation rights to attend all PBC Board and committee meetings and will receive all information regularly shared with PBC directors and any additional information shared with PBC directors related to safety and security.</p></li><li><p>With the intent of advancing the mission, the NFP will have access to the PBC’s advanced research, intellectual property, products and platforms, including artificial intelligence models, Application Program Interfaces (APIs), and related tools and technologies, as well as ongoing operational and programmatic support, and access to employees of the PBC.</p></li><li><p>Within one year of the recapitalization, the NFP Board will have at least two directors (including the Chair of the Safety and Security Committee) who will not serve on the PBC Board.</p></li><li><p>The Attorney General will be provided with advance notice of significant changes in corporate governance.</p></li></ul></blockquote><p>What did California get?</p><p><a href="https://oag.ca.gov/system/files/attachments/press-docs/Final%20Executed%20MOU%20Between%20OpenAI%20and%20California%20AG%20re%20Notice%20of%20Conditions%20of%20Non-Objection%20%2810.27.2025%29%20%28Signed%20by%20OpenAI%29%20%28Signed%20by%20CA%20DOJ%29.pdf" rel="">California also has its own Memorandum of Understanding</a><span>. It talks a lot in its declarations about California in particular, how OpenAI creates California jobs and economic activity (and ‘problem solving’?) and is committed to doing more of this and bringing benefits and deepening its commitment to the state in particular.</span></p><p>The whole claim via Tweet by Sam Altman that he did not threaten to leave California is raising questions supposedly answered by his Tweet. At this level you perhaps do not need to make your threats explicit. </p><p><span>The actual list </span><a href="https://x.com/robertwiblin/status/1983258006226907230" rel="">seems pretty good, though</a><span>? Here’s a full paraphrased list, some of which overlaps with Delaware’s announcement above, but which is more complete. </span></p><ol><li><p>Staying in California and expanding the California footprint.</p></li><li><p>The NFP (not for profit) retains control as long as they continue to hold ‘class N common stock’ which only they can choose to give up. What happens if Altman wants that?</p></li><li><p>The PBC and NFP missions will be identical.</p></li><li><p><a href="https://openai.com/charter" rel="">The OpenAI charter</a><span> will be published. Check.</span></p></li><li><p>The NFP Board owes fiduciary duties to the NFP, Mission and public beneficiaries of the NFP. I notice it doesn’t say ‘exclusively’ here.</p></li><li><p>The board shall carry out the charitable purpose (already presumably required).</p></li><li><p>No cheating clause: While the PBC holds Class N Common Stock (again, what happens if Altman tries to end this?) the NFP must approve in advance in writing any amendments to the PBC’s corporate governance guidelines or the mission, any Deemed Liquidation Event, or any sale of material assets of the PBC, or any additional issue of shares of Class N common stock.</p><ol><li><p>The PBC can issue Class B common stock, but they can’t let the Bs vote.</p></li></ol></li><li><p> PBC board and Safety and Security Committee (SSC) must only consider the mission with respect to safety and security issues. The chair of the SSC must be on the NFP board and not the PBC board, but can attend all PBC board meetings and gets all PBC safety and security related information.</p><ol><li><p>In particular, the SSC cannot consider shareholder returns, competitive pressures, financial implications or market timing.</p><ol><li><p>It seems impossible this will 100% be followed, but it helps.</p></li></ol></li></ol></li><li><p>The SSC is a committee of the NFP and oversees safety and security. </p></li><li><p>The SSC can require mitigations up to and including halting releases, without formal justification. </p><ol><li><p>“The NFP will provide advance notice to the Attorney General of any material changes to the SSC’s authority.” This is good but worrisome to see, you know?</p></li></ol></li><li><p>“OpenAI will continue to undertake measures to mitigate risks to teens and others in connection with the development and deployment of AI and of AGI.” </p><ol><li><p>I mean, I would hope they were going to do that anyway.</p></li></ol></li><li><p>The PBC shall give the NFP all reasonable access to services and resources without compensation as needed for the mission. </p></li><li><p>Within a year at least one NFP director, in addition to the SSC chair, will serve only on the NFP board (so at least two directors must be different).</p></li><li><p>The PBC board must be majority independent directors. </p></li><li><p>The PBC will have various good corporate governance things.</p></li><li><p>The PBC will publish a yearly report on its progress in its mission.</p></li><li><p>The NFP Board’s Mission and Strategy Commission will meet with the California AG semi-annually and individual members will be available as needed.</p></li><li><p>The NFP will provide 21 days notice before consenting to changes of PBC control or mission, or any threat to the Class N share rights, or any relocation outside of California.</p></li><li><p>The California AG can review, and hire experts to help review, anything requiring such notice, and get paid by NFP for doing so. </p></li><li><p>Those on both NFP and PBC boards get annual fiduciary duty training.</p></li><li><p>The board represents that the recapitalization is fair (whoops), and that they’ve disclosed everything relevant (?), so the AG will also not object.</p></li><li><p>This only impacts the parties to the MOU, others retain all rights. Disputes resolved in the courts of San Francisco, these are the whole terms, we all have the authority to do this, effective as of signing, AG is relying on OpenAI’s representations and the AG retains all rights and waive none as per usual.</p></li></ol><p><span>Also, it’s not even listed in the memo, but </span><a href="https://x.com/_NathanCalvin/status/1983992985533739395" rel="">the ‘merge and assist’ clause was preserved</a><span>, meaning OpenAI commits to join forces with any ‘safety-conscious’ rival that has a good chance of reaching OpenAI’s goal of creating AGI within a two-year time frame. I don’t actually expect an OpenAI-Anthropic merger to happen, but it’s a nice extra bit of optionality.  </span></p><p><span>This is better than I expected, </span><a href="https://x.com/BenShindel/status/1983511688470036676" rel="">and as Ben Shindel points out better than many traders expected</a><span>. This actually does have real teeth, and it was plausible that without pressure there would have been no teeth at all. </span></p><p>It grants the NFP the sole power to appoint and remove directors, and requiring them not to consider the for-profit mission in safety contexts. The explicit granting of the power to halt deployments and mandate mitigations, without having to cite any particular justification and without respect to profitability, is highly welcome, if structured in a functional fashion. </p><p><span>It is remarkable how little many expected to get. </span><a href="https://x.com/GarrisonLovely/status/1983307624423805300" rel="">For example, here’s Todor Markov, who didn’t even expect the NFP to be able to replace directors at all</a><span>. If you can’t do that, you’re basically dead in the water. </span></p><p>I am not a lawyer, but my understanding is that the ‘no cheating around this’ clauses are about as robust as one could reasonably hope for them to be. </p><p><span>It’s still, as Garrison Lovely calls it, </span><a href="https://x.com/GarrisonLovely/status/1983307655889498303" rel="">‘on paper’ governance</a><span>. Sometimes that means governance in practice. Sometimes it doesn’t. As we have learned. </span></p><p>The distinction between the boards still means there is an additional level removed between the PBC and the NFP. In a fast moving situation, this makes a big difference, and the NFP likely would have to depend on its enumerated additional powers being respected. I would very much have liked them to include appointing or firing the CEO directly.</p><p>Whether this overall ‘counts as a good deal’ depends on your baseline. It’s definitely a ‘good deal’ versus what our realpolitik expectations projected. One can argue that if the control rights really are sufficiently robust over time, that the decline in dollar value for the nonprofit is not the important thing here. </p><p>The counterargument to that is both that those resources could do a lot of good over time, and also that giving up the financial rights has a way of leading to further giving up control rights, even if the current provisions are good. </p><p>Similarly to many issues of AI alignment, if an entity has ‘unnatural’ control, or ‘unnatural’ profit interests, then there are strong forces that continuously try to take that control away. As we have already seen. </p><p>Unless Altman genuinely wants to be controlled, the nonprofit will always be under attack, where at every move we fight to hold its ground. On a long enough time frame, that becomes a losing battle.</p><p>Right now, the OpenAI NFP board is essentially captured by Altman, and also identical to the PBC board. They will become somewhat different, but no matter what it only matters if the PBC board actually tries to fulfill its fiduciary duties rather than being a rubber stamp. </p><p>One could argue that all of this matters little, since the boards will both be under Altman’s control and likely overlap quite a lot, and they were already ignoring their duties to the nonprofit. </p><blockquote><p><a href="https://apnews.com/article/openai-chatgpt-nonprofit-microsoft-c661df3242766d6b0ddbab401ad1fd84" rel="">Robert Weissman, co-president of the nonprofit Public Citizen</a><span>, said this arrangement does not guarantee the nonprofit independence, likening it to a corporate foundation that will serve the interests of the for profit.</span></p><p>Even as the nonprofit’s board may technically remain in control, Weissman said that control “is illusory because there is no evidence of the nonprofit ever imposing its values on the for profit.”</p></blockquote><p>So yes, there is that. </p><p>They claim to now be a public benefit corporation, OpenAI Group PBC.</p><blockquote><p>OpenAI: The for-profit is now a public benefit corporation, called OpenAI Group PBC, which—unlike a conventional corporation—is required to advance its stated mission and consider the broader interests of all stakeholders, ensuring the company’s mission and commercial success advance together.</p></blockquote><p>This is a mischaracterization of how PBCs work. It’s more like the flip side of this. A conventional corporation is supposed to maximize profits and can be sued if it goes too far in not doing that. Unlike a conventional corporation, a PBC is allowed to consider those broader interests to a greater extent, but it is not in practice ‘required’ to do anything other than maximize profits.</p><p>One particular control right is the special duty to the mission, especially via the safety and security committee. How much will they attempt to downgrade the scope of that?</p><blockquote><p><a href="https://www.themidasproject.com/article-list/the-midas-project-statement-on-openai-s-restructuring" rel="">The Midas Project</a><span>: However, the effectiveness of this safeguard will depend entirely on how broadly “safety and security issues” are defined in practice. It would not be surprising to see OpenAI attempt to classify most business decisions—pricing, partnerships, deployment timelines, compute allocation—as falling outside this category. </span></p><p>This would allow shareholder interests to determine the majority of corporate strategy while minimizing the mission-only standard to apply to an artificially narrow set of decisions they deem easy or costless.</p></blockquote><p><a href="https://openai.com/index/next-chapter-of-microsoft-openai-partnership/" rel="">They have an announcement about that too</a><span>.</span></p><blockquote><p>OpenAI: First, Microsoft supports the OpenAI board moving forward with formation of a public benefit corporation (PBC) and recapitalization.</p><p>Following the recapitalization, Microsoft holds an investment in OpenAI Group PBC valued at approximately $135 billion, representing roughly 27 percent on an as-converted diluted basis, inclusive of all owners—employees, investors, and the OpenAI Foundation. Excluding the impact of OpenAI’s recent funding rounds, Microsoft held a 32.5 percent stake on an as-converted basis in the OpenAI for-profit.</p></blockquote><p>Anyone else notice something funky here? OpenAI’s nonprofit has had its previous rights expropriated, and been given 26% of OpenAI’s shares in return. If Microsoft had 32.5% of the company excluding the nonprofit’s rights before that happened, then that should give them 24% of the new OpenAI. Instead they have 27%. </p><p>I don’t know anything nonpublic on this, but it sure looks a lot like Microsoft insisted they have a bigger share than the nonprofit (27% vs. 26%) and this was used to help justify this expropriation and a transfer of additional shares to Microsoft.</p><p>In exchange, Microsoft gave up various choke points it held over OpenAI, including potential objections to the conversion, and clarified points of dispute.</p><p>Microsoft got some upgrades in here as well.</p><blockquote><ol><li><p>Once AGI is declared by OpenAI, that declaration will now be verified by an independent expert panel.</p></li><li><p>Microsoft’s IP rights for both models and products are extended through 2032 and now includes models post-AGI, with appropriate safety guardrails.</p></li><li><p>Microsoft’s IP rights to research, defined as the confidential methods used in the development of models and systems, will remain until either the expert panel verifies AGI or through 2030, whichever is first. Research IP includes, for example, models intended for internal deployment or research only. </p><ol><li><p>Beyond that, research IP does not include model architecture, model weights, inference code, finetuning code, and any IP related to data center hardware and software; and Microsoft retains these non-Research IP rights.</p></li></ol></li><li><p>Microsoft’s IP rights now exclude OpenAI’s consumer hardware.</p></li><li><p>OpenAI can now jointly develop some products with third parties. API products developed with third parties will be exclusive to Azure. Non-API products may be served on any cloud provider.</p></li><li><p>Microsoft can now independently pursue AGI alone or in partnership with third parties. If Microsoft uses OpenAI’s IP to develop AGI, prior to AGI being declared, the models will be subject to compute thresholds; those thresholds are significantly larger than the size of systems used to train leading models today.</p></li><li><p>The revenue share agreement remains until the expert panel verifies AGI, though payments will be made over a longer period of time.</p></li><li><p>OpenAI has contracted to purchase an incremental $250B of Azure services, and Microsoft will no longer have a right of first refusal to be OpenAI’s compute provider.</p></li><li><p>OpenAI can now provide API access to US government national security customers, regardless of the cloud provider.</p></li><li><p>OpenAI is now able to release open weight models that meet requisite capability criteria.</p></li></ol></blockquote><p>That’s kind of a wild set of things to happen here. </p><p>In some key ways Microsoft got a better deal than it previously had. In particular, AGI used to be something OpenAI seemed like it could simply declare (you know, like war or the defense production act) and now it needs to be verified by an ‘expert panel’ which implies there is additional language I’d very much like to see. </p><p>In other ways OpenAI comes out ahead. An incremental $250B of Azure services sounds like a lot but I’m guessing both sides are happy with that number. Getting rid of the right of first refusal is big, as is having their non-API products free and clear. Getting hardware products fully clear of Microsoft is a big deal for the Ives project.</p><p>My overall take here is this was one of those broad negotiations where everything trades off, nothing is done until everything is done, and there was a very wide ZOPA (zone of possible agreement) since OpenAI really needed to make a deal. </p><p>In theory govern the OpenAI PBC. I have my doubts about that.</p><p>What they do have is a nominal pile of cash. What are they going to do with it to supposedly ensure that AGI goes well for humanity? </p><p><span>The default, </span><a href="https://www.obsolete.pub/p/the-end-of-openais-nonprofit-era" rel="">as Garrison Lovely predicted a while back</a><span>, is that the nonprofit will essentially buy OpenAI services for nonprofits and others, recapture much of the value and serve as a form of indulgences, marketing and way to satisfy critics, which may or may not do some good along the way. </span></p><p><a href="https://openai.com/index/50-million-fund-to-build-with-communities/" rel="">The initial $50 million spend looked a lot like exactly this</a><span>. </span></p><p>Their new ‘initial focus’ for $25 billion will be in these two areas:</p><blockquote><ul><li><p><strong>Health and curing diseases.</strong><span> The OpenAI Foundation will fund work to accelerate health breakthroughs so everyone can benefit from faster diagnostics, better treatments, and cures. This will start with activities like the creation of open-sourced and responsibly built frontier health datasets, and funding for scientists.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Technical solutions to AI resilience. </strong><span>Just as the internet required a comprehensive cybersecurity ecosystem—protecting power grids, hospitals, banks, governments, companies, and individuals—we now need a parallel resilience layer for AI.

There’s nothing wrong with health and curing diseases, but pushing this now does not advance the fundamental mission of OpenAI. They are going to start with, essentially, doing AI capabilities research and diffusion in health, and funding scientists to do AI-enabled research. A lot of this will likely fall right back into OpenAI and be good PR.</p><p>Again, that’s a net positive thing to do, happy to see it done, but that’s not the mission.</p><p>Technical solutions to AI resilience could potentially at least be useful AI safety work to some extent. With a presumed ~$12 billion this is a vast overconcentration of safety efforts into things that are worth doing but ultimately don’t seem likely to be determining factors. Note how Altman described it in his tl;dr from the Q&amp;A:</p><blockquote><p>Sam Altman: The nonprofit is initially committing $25 billion to health and curing disease, and AI resilience (all of the things that could help society have a successful transition to a post-AGI world, including technical safety but also things like economic impact, cyber security, and much more). The nonprofit now has the ability to actually deploy capital relatively quickly, unlike before.</p></blockquote><p>This is now infinitely broad. It could be addressing ‘economic impact’ and be basically a normal (ineffective) charity, or one that intervenes mostly by giving OpenAI services to normal nonprofits. It could be mostly spent on valuable technical safety, and be on the most important charitable initiatives in the world. It could be anything in between, in any distribution. We don’t know. </p><p>My default assumption is that this is primarily going to be about mundane safety or even fall short of that, and make the near term world better, perhaps importantly better, but do little to guard against the dangers or downsides of AGI or superintelligence, and again largely be a de facto customer of OpenAI. </p><p>There’s nothing wrong with mundane risk mitigation or defense in depth, and nothing wrong with helping people who need a hand, but if your plan is ‘oh we will make things resilient and it will work out’ then you have no plan. </p><p>That doesn’t mean this will be low impact, or that what OpenAI left the nonprofit with is chump change. </p><p>I also don’t want to knock the size of this pool. The previous nonprofit initiative was $50 million, which can do a lot of good if spent well (in that case, I don’t think it was) but in this context $50 million chump change. </p><p>Whereas $25 billion? Okay, yeah, we are talking real money. That can move needles, if the money actually gets spent in short order. If it’s $25 billion as a de facto endowment spent down over a long time, then this matters and counts for a lot less.</p><p>The warrants are quite far out of the money and the NFP should have gotten far more stock than it did, but 26% (worth $130 billion or more) remains a lot of equity. You can do quite a lot of good in a variety of places with that money. The board of directors of the nonprofit is highly qualified if they want to execute on that. It also is highly qualified to effectively shuttle much of that money right back to OpenAI’s for profit, if that’s what they mainly want to do. </p><p>It won’t help much with the whole ‘not dying’ or ‘AGI goes well for humanity’ missions, but other things matter too. </p><p><span>Not entirely. As Garrison Lovely notes, </span><a href="https://www.obsolete.pub/p/the-end-of-openais-nonprofit-era" rel="">all these sign-offs are provisional</a><span>, and there are other lawsuits and the potential for other lawsuits. In a world where Elon Musk’s payouts can get crawled back, I wouldn’t be too confident that this conversation sticks. It’s not like the Delaware AG drives most objections to corporate actions.</span></p><p><span>The last major obstacle is the Elon Musk lawsuit, where standing is at issue but the judge has made clear </span><a href="https://www.obsolete.pub/p/what-the-headlines-miss-about-the" rel="">that the suit otherwise has merit</a><span>. There might be other lawsuits on the horizon. But yeah, probably this is happening. </span></p><p>So this is the world we live in. We need to make the most of it. </p></div></article></div><div id="discussion"><h4>Discussion about this post</h4></div></div>]]></description>

    <p>The <strong>European Union Council</strong> has once again retreated from its controversial <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2025/09/chat-control-back-menu-eu-it-still-must-be-stopped-0">Chat Control proposal</a>, a plan that would have required widespread scanning of encrypted messages. The withdrawal by the current <strong>Danish presidency</strong> represents yet another chapter in a long-running battle between privacy advocates and lawmakers who believe they can compromise encryption in the name of public safety. While this latest defeat is a victory for digital rights, the fight is far from over, and the <em>fundamental misunderstanding of encryption technology</em> continues to plague policy discussions across Europe.</p>

<h2 id="a-zombie-proposal-that-refuses-to-die">A zombie proposal that refuses to die</h2>

<p>Since its introduction in 2022, Chat Control has become what privacy advocates call a <em>zombie proposal</em>, repeatedly resurrected despite consistent opposition from civil society, technical experts, and the public. The <strong>Electronic Frontier Foundation</strong> and <a href="https://www.globalencryption.org/2024/05/joint-statement-on-the-dangers-of-the-may-2024-council-of-the-eu-compromise-proposal-on-eu-csam/">more than 80 civil society organizations</a> have strongly opposed the legislation, which would mandate client-side scanning of encrypted communications under the guise of combating child sexual abuse material.</p>

<p>The pattern has become predictable. EU lawmakers introduce the proposal, claiming it includes safeguards for privacy. Technical experts explain why those safeguards are illusory. Public pressure mounts. The proposal is withdrawn or modified. Then, after a brief hiatus, it returns with minor tweaks, and the cycle begins anew. This latest withdrawal by the <strong>Danish presidency</strong> follows the same script, but the underlying issues remain unresolved.</p>

<p>What makes this particularly frustrating is that the fundamental problem with Chat Control has never been addressed. The proposal seeks to create what privacy experts call a “backdoor” into encryption, allowing authorities to scan messages before they’re encrypted or after they’re decrypted. Proponents argue this preserves encryption while enabling content moderation, but this reveals a <em>dangerous misunderstanding</em> of how encryption actually works. Creating any mechanism to access encrypted content inherently weakens the entire system, making it vulnerable not just to authorized access but to malicious actors as well.</p>

<h2 id="the-technical-impossibility-of-safe-scanning">The technical impossibility of “safe” scanning</h2>

<p>The core issue with Chat Control and similar proposals lies in a fundamental misunderstanding of encryption technology. End-to-end encryption works because only the sender and recipient possess the keys to decrypt messages. Any third party, whether a government agency or a tech company, cannot read the contents. This is not a design choice but a mathematical certainty that ensures the security of billions of communications daily.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/11/why-adding-client-side-scanning-breaks-end-end-encryption">Client-side scanning</a>, the technical approach favored by Chat Control advocates, attempts to circumvent this limitation by analyzing messages on users’ devices before encryption or after decryption. While this might sound like a clever workaround, it fundamentally breaks the security model of encryption. If a device can scan and report on message content, so can malware, hackers, or authoritarian governments who might compel tech companies to expand the scope of scanning.</p>

<p>Security researchers have repeatedly demonstrated that there is <em>no way to create a scanning system</em> that only works for “good guys.” <strong>Apple</strong> learned this lesson the hard way in 2021 when it proposed a similar system for detecting child abuse imagery in iCloud photos. The backlash from security experts was swift and devastating, forcing the company to abandon the plan. The same security vulnerabilities that would enable Chat Control would inevitably be exploited by malicious actors, putting everyone at greater risk.</p>

<p>Moreover, the scope creep inherent in surveillance technologies is well documented. A system initially designed to detect illegal content could easily be expanded to monitor political dissent, religious expression, or any other communication governments deem problematic. <strong>Countries around the world</strong> are watching the EU’s actions closely. If Chat Control were to pass, it would set a dangerous precedent that authoritarian regimes would eagerly exploit, claiming they’re simply following Europe’s lead in implementing “reasonable” content moderation.</p>

<h2 id="public-pressure-and-the-power-of-resistance">Public pressure and the power of resistance</h2>

<p>The withdrawal of Chat Control demonstrates the <em>critical importance of sustained public engagement</em> in technology policy. Unlike previous instances where technical proposals sailed through legislative processes with little public awareness, this fight has been characterized by unprecedented mobilization from civil society organizations, technology companies, security researchers, and ordinary citizens concerned about their digital rights.</p>

<p>Organizations like the <strong>Electronic Frontier Foundation</strong>, <strong>European Digital Rights</strong>, and numerous national privacy advocacy groups have played a crucial role in educating the public about the risks of Chat Control. Their efforts have included detailed technical explanations, legal analysis, and coordination of opposition campaigns that have reached millions of Europeans. This groundswell of opposition has made it politically toxic for lawmakers to support the proposal, at least in its current form.</p>

<p>The effectiveness of this resistance offers important lessons for future policy battles. First, technical expertise matters. When security researchers speak with a unified voice about the impossibility of safe backdoors, it becomes harder for politicians to dismiss concerns as alarmist. Second, coalition-building across different sectors strengthens opposition. When <a href="https://edri.org/our-work/chat-control-what-is-actually-going-on/">civil liberties groups</a>, tech companies, and individual users all oppose a policy, it suggests the problems are real and widespread. Third, sustained pressure is essential because, as Chat Control demonstrates, bad proposals rarely die on the first attempt.</p>

<p>However, this victory should be tempered with realism. The forces pushing for Chat Control have not given up, and the underlying political dynamics that gave rise to the proposal remain unchanged. Politicians face genuine pressure to be seen as “doing something” about online harms, particularly regarding child safety. Until alternative approaches that don’t compromise encryption gain political traction, proposals like Chat Control will continue to resurface.</p>

<h2 id="the-path-forward-requires-education-and-alternatives">The path forward requires education and alternatives</h2>

<p>The repeated resurrection of Chat Control points to a deeper problem in how technology policy is made. Many lawmakers genuinely believe they can have both strong encryption and government access to encrypted content. This belief persists despite unanimous opposition from the cryptographic community because the political incentives favor appearing tough on crime over understanding complex technical realities.</p>

<p>Breaking this cycle requires a <em>fundamental shift in how we approach online safety</em>. Rather than seeking technological magic bullets that promise security without trade-offs, policymakers need to invest in solutions that actually work. This includes better funding for law enforcement training and tools that don’t require breaking encryption, improved international cooperation on criminal investigations, and addressing the root causes of online exploitation through social programs and education.</p>

<p><strong>Technology companies</strong> also bear responsibility for developing and promoting genuinely privacy-preserving safety features. End-to-end encrypted platforms can implement abuse prevention measures that don’t involve content scanning, such as metadata analysis, user reporting systems, and account-level restrictions for suspicious behavior. While these approaches may be less comprehensive than mass surveillance, they achieve meaningful safety improvements without the catastrophic privacy trade-offs of backdoors.</p>

<p>Looking ahead, the privacy community cannot simply celebrate the withdrawal of Chat Control and move on. The next presidency of the EU Council will bring new opportunities for the proposal to resurface in yet another modified form. Sustained vigilance, continued public education, and proactive development of alternative safety measures will be essential. The fight to protect encryption is not a single battle but an ongoing campaign that requires long-term commitment from everyone who values digital privacy and security.</p>

<p>The withdrawal of Chat Control is a victory, but it’s a temporary one. The fundamental challenge remains: convincing policymakers that some trade-offs are not worth making, and that breaking encryption to combat illegal content creates far more problems than it solves. Until that message truly sinks in, the zombie proposal will keep rising from the grave, and the privacy community must remain ready to defeat it again and again.</p>

<p>cabal won’t work in the browser due to lack of process support; but it’s possible to use <code>wasm32-wasi-cabal</code> to precompile some third party packages to wasm and make this playground support them as well.</p>

<p>thanks for the reports! a few seconds of freeze during start-time is expected, since it needs to download ~50M of a rootfs tarball and extract it, then link the ghc library and all its dependencies. as for safari, it’s strange since i i just landed a workaround for a webkit bug that breaks the wasm dynamic linker a few days ago, i’ll take a closer look later.</p>

<p>the ghc library already mostly works when compiled to wasm, and it can parse/typecheck/desugar stuff. the bottleneck is the linker/loader part, for it to be useful it needs to be able to dynamically load and execute haskell code. i landed a couple of ghc patches recently to push towards that direction, and the last one that gets us towards the haskell playground (not landed yet) is <a href="https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/merge_requests/15000" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Draft: Support running GHC fully client-side in the browser (!15000) · Merge requests · Glasgow Haskell Compiler / GHC · GitLab</a></p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/1oj52xx/tech_companies_are_firing_everyone_to_fund_ai_but/">https://old.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/1oj52xx/tech_companies_are_firing_everyone_to_fund_ai_but/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45782267">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>So, Amazon announced they're laying off 30k people. This is set to be the largest layoff in the company’s history. That's on top of Microsoft cutting 15k, Meta cutting 3.6k and Google cutting hundreds this year. Over 180,000 tech workers laid off in 2025 alone.</p>

<p>But here's what nobody's connecting and it's actually insane when you connect all the dots. These same companies are spending over $300 billion on AI this year. So they're firing people to "free up capital for AI investments." Then spending that money buying stuff from each other. And none of it's making them money yet.</p>

<p>Let me break down what's actually happening:</p>

<p>Layoff is just an excuse - Every company's using the same line. "We're restructuring for AI." "AI will handle these tasks now." "We need to fund AI initiatives."</p>

<p>Zuckerberg said AI could be ready this year to "effectively be a sort of mid-level engineer capable of writing code.", Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said "we will need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today.", Salesforce laid off 4,000 customer support staff and their CEO literally said it was because of "increasing AI adoption.", IBM cut 8,000 jobs in HR because "AI tools take over routine administrative tasks."</p>

<p>So the story is AI's now capable of doing these jobs right? That's why they gotta fire everyone. Except the thing is - They're not saving that money. They're spending way more than they're saving.</p>

<p>and <strong>where the money is really going?</strong> They're buying from each other - </p>

<ul>
<li>Microsoft buys Nvidia chips. Rents cloud capacity from Amazon AWS. Buys software from other companies. </li>
<li>Amazon buys Nvidia chips. Uses Microsoft software. Rents capacity they can't build fast enough.</li>
<li>Meta buys Nvidia chips. Rents infrastructure from Google Cloud and AWS</li>
<li>Apple doesn't even build AI infrastructure. They rent everything from Google AWS and Azure. So Apple pays Google. Google pays Nvidia. Nvidia pays TSMC for manufacturing. Microsoft pays Amazon. Amazon pays Microsoft. Meta pays everyone.</li>
</ul>

<p>They're literally just passing money in circles. The "Magnificent 7" stocks/companies Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta and Tesla, have a combined market cap of $17 trillion. For reference US GDP is $30 trillion. But their combined revenue in 2024? $2.2 trillion. Net profit? around $550 billion.</p>

<p>They're trading at an average P/E ratio of 35. That means investors are paying $35 for every $1 of profit. The S&amp;P 500 without them? P/E of 15.5. Why the premium? Because everyone believes AI is going to make them wildly profitable in the future.</p>

<p>But right now they're just spending money. On each other. Creating the illusion of growth.</p>

<p>But here's the trap. These companies CAN'T stop now. Because if any of them stops their stock crashes. Investors think they're giving up on AI and falling behind. So they're locked in an arms race. Have to keep spending to maintain stock prices even if the spending doesn't generate returns.</p>

<p>Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet Meta increased capex by 42% in 2024. Planning another 17% increase in 2025. $244 billion total spend next year across just those 4.</p>

<p>and it's going to Mostly Nvidia. Who uses it to buy manufacturing from TSMC. Who uses it to buy equipment from ASML. Money moving in circles.</p>

<p><strong>Connecting the dots</strong></p>

<p>So let me spell this out. These companies are:</p>

<ol>
<li>Laying off hundreds of thousands of workers to "fund AI"</li>
<li>Spending way more on AI than they're saving from layoffs</li>
<li>Buying most of that AI infrastructure from each other</li>
<li>Not making any actual profit from AI yet</li>
<li>Can't stop spending or their stocks crash</li>
<li>Creating the illusion of economic growth through spending alone</li>
</ol>

<p>So when you hear "stock market hit a new record" that means these 7 companies went up. The other 493? They contributed 46%. And why did these 7 go up? Because they're spending hundreds of billions on AI. Which inflates their valuations. Which makes the S&amp;P go up. Which makes everyone think the economy's great. Your 401k? Probably heavy in S&amp;P 500 index funds. Which means 37% of your retirement is bet on these 7 companies and their AI spending paying off eventually.</p>

<p>And we're all just along for the ride.</p>

<p><strong>TLDR</strong></p>

<p>Amazon laid off 30,000 people yesterday. Microsoft 15,000 this year. Meta 3,600. Intel 22,000. Over 180,000 tech workers fired in 2025. All saying it's to "fund AI initiatives." But they're spending $300B+ on AI way more than they're saving from layoffs. Most of that money going to each other in circles. Apple rents AI infrastructure from Google AWS Azure. Everyone buys Nvidia chips. They pay each other for cloud capacity. AI spending added 0.5% to GDP. Without it GDP would've grown 0.6%. Only Meta showing actual AI revenue. Everyone else just spending hoping it pays off. Goldman Sachs and Sequoia reports say ROI is nonexistent so far. But they can't stop spending or stocks crash. Locked in arms race. The 7 biggest tech companies are 37% of S&amp;P 500. Made up 54% of gains in 2024. Your 401k is probably 37% bet on AI spending paying off. If it doesn't they're massively overvalued at 35x earnings. Firing people to fund buying stuff from each other while making no profit yet.</p>

		<p><span>arXiv’s computer science (CS) category has updated its moderation practice with respect to review (or survey) articles and position papers. Before being considered for submission to arXiv’s CS category, review articles and position papers must now be accepted at a journal or a conference and complete successful peer review. When submitting review articles or position papers, authors must include documentation of successful peer review to receive full consideration. Review/survey articles or position papers submitted to arXiv without this documentation will be likely to be rejected and not appear on arXiv.</span><span><br>
</span><span><br>
</span><span>This change is being implemented due to the unmanageable influx of review articles and position papers to arXiv CS.</span></p>
<p><b>Is this a policy change?</b></p>
<p><span>Technically, no! If you take a look at </span><a href="https://info.arxiv.org/help/policies/content-types.html"><span>arXiv’s policies for specific content types</span></a><span> you’ll notice that review articles and position papers are not (and have never been) listed as part of the accepted content types. Review articles and position papers have, in the past, only been accepted at moderator discretion, because the few we received were of high quality and of interest to arXiv readers and the scientific community at large.</span></p>
<p><b>Why is the arXiv CS category making this change?</b></p>
<p><span>In the past few years, arXiv has been flooded with papers. Generative AI / large language models have added to this flood by making papers – especially papers not introducing new research results – fast and easy to write. While categories across arXiv have all seen a major increase in submissions, it’s particularly pronounced in arXiv’s CS category.</span></p>
<p><span>The goal of this change of practice is to:</span></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Help arXiv readers more easily find valuable review articles and position papers written by subject matter experts</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Free up moderators to focus on the content types officially accepted by arXiv, reduce submission hold times, and keep the pace of scientific discovery going!</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span><strong>Above all, the core purpose of arXiv is to share research papers and facilitate scientific discovery quickly and freely. </strong>We are making this change in support of that mission.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In the past, arXiv CS received a relatively small amount of review or survey articles, and those we did receive were of extremely high quality, written by senior researchers at the request of publications like Annual Reviews, Proceedings of the IEEE, and Computing Surveys. Position paper submissions to arXiv were similarly rare, and usually produced by scientific societies or government study groups (for example,the Computing Research Association of the National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine).&nbsp; While, as now, these papers were not content types officially accepted by arXiv, the arXiv moderators accepted them because of their scholarly value to the research community.</span></p>
<p><span>Fast forward to present day – submissions to arXiv in general have risen dramatically, and we now receive hundreds of review articles every month. The advent of large language models have made this type of content relatively easy to churn out on demand, and the majority of the review articles we receive are little more than annotated bibliographies, with no substantial discussion of open research issues.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>arXiv believes that there are position papers and review articles that are of value to the scientific community, and we would like to be able to share them on arXiv. However, our team of volunteer moderators do not have the time or bandwidth to review the hundreds of these articles we receive without taking time away from our core purpose, which is to share research articles.</span></p>
<p><span>Reasonable and trusted outside refereed venues already exist (conferences and journals) which solicit position papers and review articles on subjects of concern or interest to our readers (such as concerns over privacy, ethics, safety, and security of recent CS technologies, particularly applications of artificial intelligence) and as part of that process, they conduct in-depth review to assure quality, evidential support of opinions, and scholarly value. Since arXiv does not have the resources to conduct this quality-control in-house for content types that we do not officially accept, this change of practice is allowing us to rely on these refereed venues to do so for us so that we can still share position papers and review articles of value on arXiv.</span></p>
<p><b>How do I submit my review article or position paper to arXiv? </b><span>Before submission to arXiv, have your review article or position paper accepted to a refereed venue with peer review like a journal or a conference.</span> <span>Review articles or position papers must be accepted to a journal or conference before being submitted to arXiv and you must have documentation of complete and successful peer review.</span></p>
<p><span>Please note: the review conducted at conference workshops generally does not meet the same standard of rigor of traditional peer review and is not enough to have your review article or position paper accepted to arXiv. </span></p>
<p><b>How do I show my review article or position paper has successfully completed peer review? </b><span>When you submit to arXiv, please include the peer reviewed journal reference and DOI metadata. If you do not provide this, your review article or position paper will likely be rejected.</span></p>
<p><b>Can I resubmit my position paper or review article after being rejected? </b><span>If your position paper or review article was rejected because it did not complete a successful peer review process, you can submit an appeal request to resubmit if your article has since completed a successful peer review process. Do not resubmit your position paper or review article without an accepted appeal. Here are the </span><a href="https://info.arxiv.org/help/moderation/appeals.html"><span>instructions for how to appeal.</span></a></p>
<p><b>I have a scientific paper studying the impact of science and technology in society. Can I submit this to arXiv without peer review? </b><span>Yes, arXiv has always released these types of scientific papers, for example in cs.CY or physics.soc-ph. These are scientific research papers and are not subject to this moderation practice change.</span></p>
<p><b>Will other categories on arXiv also change their practice re: review articles and position papers? </b><span>Each category of arXiv has different moderators, who are subject matter experts with a terminal degree in their particular subject, to best serve the scholarly pursuits, goals, and standards of their category. While all moderators adhere to arXiv policy, the only policy arXiv has in place with regard to review articles and position papers is that they are not a generally accepted content type. The goal of the moderators of each category is to make sure the work being submitted is actually science, and that it is of potential interest to the scientific community. If other categories see a similar rise in LLM-written review articles and position papers, they may choose to change their moderation practices in a similar manner to better serve arXiv authors and readers. We will make these updates public if and when they do occur.</span></p>

<p dir="auto"><code>catten</code> is an operating system kernel developed as a key component of the CharlotteOS project but it is designed to be flexible enough that we hope it can also find use in many other places. It seeks to be a monolithic kernel with low-level system call interfaces that borrows ideas from exokernels and other novel systems like Plan 9 and Fuchsia. Its design allows for almost any higher level interface to be layered on top and also includes a typesafe system namespace (akin to the namespaces found in Fuschsia and Plan 9 but more flexible and typesafe) with URIs as paths which has the added benefit of allowing access to the namespace of another host over a network without having to mount anything locally all while being secured by granular capabilities and a persistent mandatory access control policy.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://jellyfin.org/posts/SQLite-locking/">https://jellyfin.org/posts/SQLite-locking/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45781298">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="__blog-post-container"><p>SQLite is a powerful database engine, but due to its design, it has limitations that should not be overlooked.</p>
<p>Jellyfin has used a SQLite-based database for storing most of its data for years, but it has also encountered issues on many systems. In this blog post, I will explain how we address these limitations and how developers using SQLite can apply the same solutions.</p>
<p>This will be a technical blog post intended for developers and everyone wanting to learn about concurrency.</p>
<p>Also Jellyfin's implementation of locking for SQLite should be fairly easy to be implemented into another EF Core application if you are facing the same issue.</p>
<p>- JPVenson</p>
<!-- -->
<h2 id="the-premise">The Premise<a href="#the-premise" aria-label="Direct link to The Premise" title="Direct link to The Premise" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>SQLite is a file-based database engine running within your application and allows you to store data in a relational structure.
Overall it gives your application the means of storing structured data as a single file and without having to depend on another application to do so.
Naturally this also comes at a price. If your application fully manages this file, the assumption must be made that your application is the sole owner of this file, and nobody else will tinker with it while you are writing data to it.</p>
<p>So an application that wants to use SQLite as its database needs to be the only one accessing it.
Having established this fact, an important thought arises: if only a single write operation should be performed on a single file at a time, this rule must also apply to operations within the same application.</p>
<h2 id="the-w-a-l-mode">The W-A-L mode<a href="#the-w-a-l-mode" aria-label="Direct link to The W-A-L mode" title="Direct link to The W-A-L mode" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>SQLite has a feature that tries to get around this limitation: the Write-Ahead-Log (WAL).
The WAL is a separate file that acts as a journal of operations that should be applied to an SQLite file.
This allows multiple parallel writes to take place and get enqueued into the WAL.
When another part of the application wants to read data, it reads from the actual database, then scans the WAL for modifications and applies them on the fly.
This is not a foolproof solution; there are still scenarios where WAL does not prevent locking conflicts.</p>
<h2 id="sqlite-transactions">SQLite transactions<a href="#sqlite-transactions" aria-label="Direct link to SQLite transactions" title="Direct link to SQLite transactions" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>A transaction is supposed to ensure two things.
Modifications made within a transaction can be reverted, either when something goes wrong or when the application decides it should and optionally a transaction may also block other readers from reading data that is modified within a transaction.
This is where it gets spicy and we come to the real reason why I am writing this blog post.
For some reason on some systems that run Jellyfin when a transaction takes place the SQLite engine reports the database is locked and instead of waiting for the transaction to be resolved the engine refuses to wait and just crashes.
This seems to be a not uncommon issue and there are many reports to be found on the issue.</p>
<p>The factor that makes this issue so bad is that it does not happen reliably. So far we only have one team member where this can be (somewhat) reliably be reproduced which makes this an even worse a bug.
From the reports this issue happens across all operating systems, drive speeds and with or without virtualization.
So we do not have any deciding factor identified that even contributes to the likelihood of the issue happening.</p>
<h2 id="the-jellyfin-factor">The Jellyfin factor<a href="#the-jellyfin-factor" aria-label="Direct link to The Jellyfin factor" title="Direct link to The Jellyfin factor" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>Having established the general theory on how SQLite behaves, we also have to look at the specifics of Jellyfins usage of SQLite.
During normal operations on a recommended setup (Non-Networked Storage and preferably SSD) its unusual for any problems to arise, however the way Jellyfin utilises the SQLite db up to 10.11 is very suboptimal.
In versions prior to 10.11 Jellyfin had a bug in its parallel task limit which resulted in exponential overscheduling of library scan operations which hammered the database engine with thousands of parallel write requests that an SQLite engine is simply not able to handle.
While most SQLite engine implementations have retry behavior, they also have timeouts and checks in place to prevent limitless waiting so if we stress the engine enough, it just fails with an error.
That and very long running and frankly unoptimized transactions could lead to the database just being overloaded with requests and flaking out.</p>
<h2 id="the-solution">The solution<a href="#the-solution" aria-label="Direct link to The solution" title="Direct link to The solution" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>Since we moved the codebase over to EF Core proper, we have the tools to actually do something about this as EF Core gives us a structured abstraction level.
EF Core supports a way of hooking into every command execution or transaction by creating <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/logging-events-diagnostics/interceptors" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Interceptors</a>.
With an interceptor we can finally do the straight forward idea of just "not" writing to the database in parallel in a transparent way to the caller.
The overall idea is to have multiple strategies of locking. Because all levels of synchronization will inevitably come at the cost of performance, we only want to do it when it is really necessary.
So, I decided on three locking strategies:</p>
<ol>
<li>No-Lock</li>
<li>Optimistic locking</li>
<li>Pessimistic locking</li>
</ol>
<p>As a default, the no-lock behavior does exactly what the name implies. Nothing. This is the default because my research shows that for 99% all of this is not an issue and every interaction at this level will slow down the whole application.</p>
<p>Both the optimistic and pessimistic behaviors use two interceptors—one for transactions and one for commands—and override <code>SaveChanges</code> in <code>JellyfinDbContext</code>.</p>
<h3 id="optimistic-locking-behavior">Optimistic locking behavior<a href="#optimistic-locking-behavior" aria-label="Direct link to Optimistic locking behavior" title="Direct link to Optimistic locking behavior" translate="no">​</a></h3>
<p>Optimistic locking means to assume the operation in question will succeed and only handle issues afterwards. In essence this can be boiled down to "Try and Retry and Retry ..." for a set number of times until either we succeed with the operation or fail entirely.
This still leaves the possibility that we will not actually be able to perform a write, but the introduced overhead is far less than the Pessimistic locking behavior.</p>
<p>The idea behind how this works is simple: every time two operations try to write to the database, one will always win. The other will fail, wait some time, then retry a few times.</p>
<p>Jellyfin uses the <code>Polly</code> library perform the retry behavior and will only retry operations it will find have been locked due to this exact issue.</p>
<h3 id="pessimistic-locking-behavior">Pessimistic locking behavior<a href="#pessimistic-locking-behavior" aria-label="Direct link to Pessimistic locking behavior" title="Direct link to Pessimistic locking behavior" translate="no">​</a></h3>
<p>Pessimistic locking always locks when a write to SQLite should be performed. Essentially every time an transaction is started or a write operation on the database is done though EF Core, Jellyfin will wait until all other read operations are finished and then block all other operations may they be read or write until the write in question has been performed.
This however means, that Jellyfin can only ever perform a single write to the database, even if it would technically does not need to.</p>
<p>In theory, an application should have no issue reading from table "Alice" while writing to table "Bob" however to eliminate all possible sources of concurrency related locking, Jellyfin will only ever allow a single write performed on its database in this mode.
While this will absolutely result in the most stable operation, it will undoubtedly also be the slowest.</p>
<p>Jellyfin uses a <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fundamentals/runtime-libraries/system-threading-readerwriterlockslim" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ReaderWriterLockSlim</a> to lock the operations, that means we allow an unlimited number of reads to happen concurrently while only one write may ever be done on the database.</p>
<h3 id="the-future-smart-locking-behavior">The future Smart locking behavior<a href="#the-future-smart-locking-behavior" aria-label="Direct link to The future Smart locking behavior" title="Direct link to The future Smart locking behavior" translate="no">​</a></h3>
<p>In the future we might also consider combining both modes, to get the best of both worlds.</p>
<h2>The result</h2>
<p>Initial testing showed that with both modes, we had great success in handling the underlying issue. While we are not yet sure why this happens only on some systems when others work, we at least now have an option for users previously left out of using Jellyfin.</p>
<p>When I was researching this topic, I found many reports all over the internet facing the same error but nobody was able to provide a conclusive explanation whats really happening here.
There have been similar proposals made to handle it but there wasn't a "ready to drop in" solution that handles all the different cases or only code that required massive modifications to every EF Core query.
Jellyfin's implementation of the locking behaviors should be a copy-paste solution for everyone having the same issues as its using interceptors and the caller has no idea of the actual locking behavior.</p>
<p>Best of luck,</p>

<pre>Hi all,

I plan to introduce hard Rust dependencies and Rust code into
APT, no earlier than May 2026. This extends at first to the
Rust compiler and standard library, and the Sequoia ecosystem.

In particular, our code to parse .deb, .ar, .tar, and the
HTTP signature verification code would strongly benefit
from memory safe languages and a stronger approach to
unit testing.

If you maintain a port without a working Rust toolchain,
please ensure it has one within the next 6 months, or
sunset the port.

It's important for the project as whole to be able to
move forward and rely on modern tools and technologies
and not be held back by trying to shoehorn modern software
on retro computing devices.

Thank you for your understanding.
