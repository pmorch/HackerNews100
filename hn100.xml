<p>Protesters <a href="https://www.facebook.com/watch/live/?ref=watch_permalink&amp;v=1389002139370676">disrupted services</a> on Sunday at the Cities Church in St. Paul, chanting “ICE OUT” and “Justice for Renee Good.” The St. Paul Pioneer Press <a href="https://www.twincities.com/2026/01/19/st-paul-cities-church-protest-doj/">quoted Levy Armstrong</a> as saying, “When you think about the federal government unleashing barbaric ICE agents upon our community and all the harm that they have caused, to have someone serving as a pastor who oversees these ICE agents is almost unfathomable to me.”</p>
<p>The church <a href="https://www.citieschurch.com/leadership">website</a> lists David Easterwood as one of its pastors. Protesters said this is the same David Easterwood who is listed as a defendant in a lawsuit that Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison filed against Noem and other federal officials. The <a href="https://www.ag.state.mn.us/Office/Communications/2026/docs/00190_DHS_Complaint.pdf">lawsuit</a> lists Easterwood as a defendant “in his official capacity as Acting Director, Saint Paul Field Office, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.”</p>
<p>Levy Armstrong, who is also a former president of the NAACP’s Minneapolis branch, was arrested yesterday morning. Announcing the arrest, Attorney General Pam Bondi <a href="https://x.com/AGPamBondi/status/2014344323706302566">wrote</a>, “WE DO NOT TOLERATE ATTACKS ON PLACES OF WORSHIP.” Bondi alleged that Levy Armstrong “played a key role in organizing the coordinated attack on Cities Church in St. Paul, Minnesota.”</p>

<h2>Multiple arrests</h2>
<p>Noem said Levy Armstrong “is being charged with a federal crime under 18 USC 241,” which <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/241">prohibits</a> “conspir[ing] to injure, oppress, threaten, or intimidate any person in any State, Territory, Commonwealth, Possession, or District in the free exercise or enjoyment of any right or privilege secured to him by the Constitution or laws of the United States.”</p>
<p>“Religious freedom is the bedrock of the United States—there is no first amendment right to obstruct someone from practicing their religion,” Noem wrote.</p>
<p>St. Paul School Board member Chauntyll Allen was also arrested. Attorneys for the Cities Church issued <a href="https://truenorthlegal.org/news/cities-church-attorneys-at-true-north-legal-respond-to-department-of-justice-action">statements</a> supporting the arrests and saying they “are exploring all legal options to protect the church and prevent further invasions.”</p>
<p>A federal magistrate judge initially ruled that Levy Armstrong and Allen could be released, but they were still being held last night after the government “made a motion to stay the release for further review, claiming they might be flight risks,” the Pioneer Press <a href="https://www.twincities.com/2026/01/22/the-woman-who-led-a-protest-at-a-minnesota-church-service-has-been-arrested-bondi-says/">wrote</a>.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://github.com/tldev/posturr">https://github.com/tldev/posturr</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46754944">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-hpc="true"><article itemprop="text"><p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Posturr</h2><a id="user-content-posturr" aria-label="Permalink: Posturr" href="#posturr"></a></p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>A macOS app that blurs your screen when you slouch.</strong></p>
<p dir="auto">Posturr uses your Mac's camera and Apple's Vision framework to monitor your posture in real-time. When it detects that you're slouching, it progressively blurs your screen to remind you to sit up straight. Maintain good posture, and the blur clears instantly.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Features</h2><a id="user-content-features" aria-label="Permalink: Features" href="#features"></a></p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><strong>Real-time posture detection</strong> - Uses Apple's Vision framework for body pose and face tracking</li>
<li><strong>Progressive screen blur</strong> - Gentle visual reminder that intensifies with worse posture</li>
<li><strong>Menu bar controls</strong> - Easy access to settings, calibration, and status from the menu bar</li>
<li><strong>Multi-display support</strong> - Works across all connected monitors</li>
<li><strong>Privacy-focused</strong> - All processing happens locally on your Mac</li>
<li><strong>Lightweight</strong> - Runs as a background app with minimal resource usage</li>
<li><strong>No account required</strong> - No signup, no cloud, no tracking</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Installation</h2><a id="user-content-installation" aria-label="Permalink: Installation" href="#installation"></a></p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Download</h3><a id="user-content-download" aria-label="Permalink: Download" href="#download"></a></p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>Download the latest <code>Posturr-vX.X.X.zip</code> from the <a href="https://github.com/tldev/posturr/releases">Releases</a> page</li>
<li>Unzip the downloaded file</li>
<li>Drag <code>Posturr.app</code> to your Applications folder</li>
</ol>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">First Launch (Important)</h3><a id="user-content-first-launch-important" aria-label="Permalink: First Launch (Important)" href="#first-launch-important"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Since Posturr is not signed with an Apple Developer certificate, macOS Gatekeeper will initially block it:</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li><strong>Right-click</strong> (or Control-click) on <code>Posturr.app</code></li>
<li>Select <strong>"Open"</strong> from the context menu</li>
<li>Click <strong>"Open"</strong> in the dialog that appears</li>
<li>Grant <strong>camera access</strong> when prompted</li>
</ol>
<p dir="auto">You only need to do this once. After the first launch, you can open Posturr normally.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Camera Permission</h3><a id="user-content-camera-permission" aria-label="Permalink: Camera Permission" href="#camera-permission"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Posturr requires camera access to monitor your posture. When you first launch the app, macOS will ask for permission. Click "OK" to grant access.</p>
<p dir="auto">If you accidentally denied permission, you can grant it later:</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>Open <strong>System Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Privacy &amp; Security</strong> &gt; <strong>Camera</strong></li>
<li>Find Posturr and enable the toggle</li>
</ol>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Usage</h2><a id="user-content-usage" aria-label="Permalink: Usage" href="#usage"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Once launched, Posturr appears in your menu bar with a person icon. The app continuously monitors your posture and applies screen blur when slouching is detected.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Menu Bar Controls</h3><a id="user-content-menu-bar-controls" aria-label="Permalink: Menu Bar Controls" href="#menu-bar-controls"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Click the menu bar icon to access:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><strong>Status</strong> - Shows current state (Monitoring, Slouching, Good Posture, etc.)</li>
<li><strong>Enabled</strong> - Toggle posture monitoring on/off</li>
<li><strong>Recalibrate</strong> - Reset your baseline posture (sit up straight, then click)</li>
<li><strong>Sensitivity</strong> - Adjust how sensitive the slouch detection is (Low, Medium, High, Very High)</li>
<li><strong>Dead Zone</strong> - Set the tolerance before blur kicks in (None, Small, Medium, Large)</li>
<li><strong>Quit</strong> - Exit the application (or press <strong>Escape</strong> anywhere)</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Tips for Best Results</h3><a id="user-content-tips-for-best-results" aria-label="Permalink: Tips for Best Results" href="#tips-for-best-results"></a></p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Position your camera at eye level when possible</li>
<li>Ensure adequate lighting on your face</li>
<li>Sit at a consistent distance from your screen</li>
<li>The app works best when your shoulders are visible</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">How It Works</h2><a id="user-content-how-it-works" aria-label="Permalink: How It Works" href="#how-it-works"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Posturr uses Apple's Vision framework to detect body pose landmarks:</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li><strong>Body Pose Detection</strong>: Tracks nose, shoulders, and their relative positions</li>
<li><strong>Face Detection Fallback</strong>: When full body isn't visible, tracks face position</li>
<li><strong>Posture Analysis</strong>: Measures the vertical distance between nose and shoulders</li>
<li><strong>Blur Response</strong>: Applies screen blur proportional to posture deviation</li>
</ol>
<p dir="auto">The screen blur uses macOS's private CoreGraphics API for efficient, system-level blur that covers all windows and displays.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article id="article-body"><p data-testid="paragraph-content">As many as 30,000 people could have been killed in the streets of Iran on Jan. 8 and 9 alone, two senior officials of the country’s Ministry of Health told TIME—indicating a dramatic surge in the death toll. So many people were slaughtered by Iranian security services on that Thursday and Friday, it overwhelmed the state’s capacity to dispose of the dead. Stocks of body bags were exhausted, the officials said, and eighteen-wheel semi-trailers replaced ambulances.</p><div><p data-testid="paragraph-content">The government’s internal count of the dead, not previously revealed, far surpasses the toll of 3,117 announced on Jan. 21 by regime hardliners who report directly to Iran’s Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei. (Ministries report to the elected President.) The 30,000 figure is also far beyond tallies being compiled by activists methodically assigning names to the dead. As of Saturday, the U.S.-based Human Rights Activists News Agency said it had confirmed 5,459 deaths and is investigating 17,031 more.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-content">TIME has been unable to independently verify these figures.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-content">The Health Ministry’s two-day figure roughly aligns with a count gathered by physicians and first responders, and also shared with TIME. That surreptitious tally of deaths recorded by hospitals stood at 30,304 as of Friday, according to Dr. Amir Parasta, a German-Iranian eye surgeon who prepared a report of the data. Parasta said that number does not reflect protest-related deaths of people registered at military hospitals, whose bodies were taken directly to morgues, or that happened in locales the inquiry did not reach. Iran’s National Security Council has said protests took place in around 4,000 locations across the country.  </p></div><div><p data-testid="paragraph-content">“We are getting closer to reality,” Dr. Parasta said. “But I guess the real figures are still way higher.”</p><p data-testid="paragraph-content">That appears to be the reality implicit in the government’s internal figure of more than 30,000 deaths in two days. A slaughter on that scale, in the space of 48 hours, had experts on mass killing groping for comparisons.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-content">“Most spasms of killing are not from shootings,” said Les Roberts, a professor at Columbia University who specializes in the epidemiology of violent death. “In Aleppo [Syria] and in Fallujah [Iraq], when spasms of death this high have occurred over a few days, it involved mostly explosives with some shooting.”</p><p data-testid="paragraph-content">The only parallel offered by online databases occurred in the Holocaust. On the outskirts of Kyiv on Sept. 29 and 30, 1941,<a href="https://time.com/6102593/ukraine-holocaust-memorial-kremlin-propaganda/"> Nazi death squads</a> executed 33,000 Ukrainian Jews by gunshot in a ravine known as<a href="https://encyclopedia.ushmm.org/content/en/article/kiev-and-babi-yar"> Babyn Yar</a>.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-content">In Iran, the killing fields extended across the country where, since Dec. 28, hundreds of thousands of citizens had assembled in the streets chanting first, for relief from an economy in freefall, and soon for the downfall of the Islamic regime. During the first week, security forces confronted some demonstrations, using mostly non-lethal force, but with officials also offering conciliatory language, the regime response was uncertain. That changed during the weekend commencing Jan. 8. Protests peaked, as opposition groups, <a href="https://x.com/PahlaviReza/status/2009041925647548815">including</a> <a href="https://time.com/7346706/reza-pahlavi-iran-crown-prince-trump-protests/">Reza Pahlavi,</a> the exiled son of Iran’s former shah, urged people to join the throngs, and U.S. President Donald Trump repeated <a href="https://time.com/7347090/iran-protesters-trump-help/">vows to protect them</a>, though no help arrived.</p></div><div><p data-testid="paragraph-content">Witnesses say millions were in the streets when authorities shut down the internet and all other communications with the outside world. Rooftop snipers and trucks mounted with heavy machine guns opened fire, according to eyewitnesses and cell phone footage. On Friday, Jan. 9, an official of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps warned on state television to anyone venturing into the streets, “if … a bullet hits you, don’t complain.”</p><p data-testid="paragraph-content">It took days for the reality to penetrate the internet blackout. Images of the bloodied bodies trickled out<a href="https://time.com/6249365/iran-elon-musk-starlink-protests/"> via illicit Starlink</a> satellite internet connections. The task of counting the dead was hampered, however, because the authorities had also cut off lines of communications inside Iran. The first firm information came from a Tehran doctor <a href="https://time.com/7345092/iran-protests-death-toll-regime-crackdown/">who told </a>TIME that just six hospitals in the capital had recorded at least 217 protester deaths after Thursday’s assault. Health care workers in Iran estimated at least 16,500 protesters had been killed by Jan. 10, according to an earlier report by Dr. Parasta in Munich. Friday’s update built on that research, he said.</p></div><div><p data-testid="paragraph-content">“I am genuinely impressed by how quickly this work was pulled together under extremely constrained and risky conditions,” said Paul B. Spiegel, a professor at the Johns Hopkins University International School of Health. Like Roberts, he expressed wariness of extrapolating from the figures provided by hospitals.&nbsp;</p><p data-testid="paragraph-content">Roberts, who traveled into war zones to research civilian death rates <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140673606694919/abstract">in Iraq</a> and the Democratic Republic of <a href="https://carnegieendowment.org/events/2000/10/continuing-crisis-in-the-drc-the-unheralded-death-toll-and-its-implications">Congo</a>, said, “the 30,000 verified deaths are almost certainly an underestimate.”</p><p data-testid="paragraph-content">The emergence of the Ministry of Health numbers appears to confirm that—while underscoring the stakes for both Iranians and a regime that, in 1979, came to power when a sitting government was confronted by millions of people demanding its downfall.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-content">On Friday, Jan. 9, Sahba Rashtian, an aspiring animation artist, joined friends on the streets in Isfahan, a city in central Iran famous for its beauty. "Before anyone started chanting," a friend told TIME, "Sahba was seen collapsed on the ground. Her sister noticed blood on her hand.”</p></div><p data-testid="paragraph-content">Sahba died on an operating table at a nearby hospital. She was 23.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-content">“She always joked about her beautiful name,” her friend said. “She’d laugh and say, ‘Sahba means wine, and I am forbidden in the Islamic Republic.’”</p><p data-testid="paragraph-content">At the burial, the friend said, religious rites were barred, and Rashtian’s father wore white.&nbsp;</p><p data-testid="paragraph-content">“Congratulations,” he told mourners, according to the friend. “My daughter became a martyr on the path to freedom.”</p></article></div></div>]]></description>

      <p>So... what exactly is this?</p>
      <p>You know the 1993 classic DOOM? I made it run on an earbud, then I connected it to the internet and made it possible for visitors like you to <span>sit in a queue for hours</span> play the game remotely!.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>DOOM? On an earbud? touch grass</p>
      <p>Yeah but it won't just run on any old earbud, this only works with the <a href="https://pine64.com/product/pinebuds-pro-open-firmware-capable-anc-wireless-earbuds/">Pinebuds Pro</a>, the only earbuds with open source firmware.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>Can I look at the code or run this on my own Pinebuds?</p>
      <p>You sure can! There are two relevant repos:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/arin-s/DOOMBuds">DOOMBuds</a> for the DOOM port that will run on your earbud</li>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/arin-s/DOOMBUDS-JS">DOOMBUDS-JS</a> to interact with the earbud through your browser</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>Wait, why am I looking at a twitch stream?</p>
      <p>This was a necessary optimisation to avoid paying outgoing bandwidth fees, once you're 5th in the queue, the twitch player will switch to a low-latency MJPEG stream.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>wow this front end code is atrocious, state management is everywhe-</p>
      <p>shhhh don't look don't look it's ok just join the queue</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>Give us more info, how did you get this to work?</p>
      <p>Let's switch to a more readable font first.</p>
      <div>
        <p>
          I'll put out an article / video diving deeper into this later, but here are a few bits of info:<br>
          This project is made up of four parts:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>The DOOM port that runs on the earbuds</li>
          <li>The 'serial server' that acts as a bridge between the earbuds and the web server and also transcodes the MJPEG stream to twitch</li>
          <li>The web server that serves assets, manages the queue, forwards keypresses and displays the MJPEG stream</li>
          <li>The static webpage that tells your browser what to display on the screen and how to communicate with the web server</li>
        </ol>
        <p>The firmware pushes up against a few hardware limitations:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Serial Connection
            <p>
              Earbuds don't have displays, so the only way to transfer data to/from them is either via bluetooth, or the UART contact pads.<br>
              Bluetooth is pretty slow, you'd be lucky to get a consistent 1mbps connection, UART is easily the better option.<br>
              DOOM's framebuffer is (width * height) bytes, 320 * 200 = 96kB. (doom's internal framebuffer is 8-bit not 24-bit)<br>
              The UART connection provides us with 2.4mbps of usable bandwidth. 2,400,000 / 8 / 96,000 gives us... 3 frames per second.<br>
              Clearly we need to compress the video stream. Modern video codecs like h264 consume way too much CPU and RAM.<br>
              The only feasible approach is sending the video as an MJPEG stream. MJPEG is a stream of JPEG images shown one after the other.<br>
              I found an excellent JPEG encoder for embedded devices <a href="https://github.com/bitbank2/JPEGENC">here</a>, thanks Larry!<br>
              A conservative estimate for the average HIGH quality JPEG frame is around 13.5KB, but most scenes (without enemies) are around 11kb.<br>
              Theoretical maximum FPS:<br>
              - Optimistic:     `2,400,000 / (11,000 * 8)` = 27.3 FPS<br>
              - Conservative: `2,400,000 / (13,500 * 8)` = 22.2 FPS
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            CPU
            <p>
              The stock open source firmware has the CPU set to 100mhz, so I cranked that up to 300mhz and disabled low power mode.<br>
              The Cortex-M4F running at 300mhz is actually more than enough for DOOM, however it struggles with JPEG encoding.<br>
              This is why it maxes out at ~18fps, I don't think there's much else I can do to speed it up.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            RAM
            <p>
              By default, we only have access to 768KB of RAM, after disabling the co-processor it gets bumped up to the advertised 992KB.<br>
              DOOM requires 4MB of RAM, though there are plenty of optimisations that can reduce this amount.<br>
              Pre-generating lookup tables, making variables const, reading const variables from flash, disabling DOOM's caching system, removing unneeded variables. It all adds up!
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            FLASH
            <p>
              The shareware DOOM 1 wad (assets file) is 4.2MB and the earbuds can only store 4MB of data.<br>
              Thankfully, <a href="https://github.com/fragglet">fragglet</a>, a well-known doom modder, has already solved this issue for me.<br>
              <a href="https://github.com/fragglet/squashware">Squashware</a> is his trimmed-down DOOM 1 wad that is only 1.7MB in size.<br>
              With this wad file, everything comfortably fits in flash.
            </p>

			<div><p>What looks like a tablet/ PDA device can be seen on the lefthand side of Nedry's desk. My closest guess is that it is a Motorola Envoy PDA.  But, according to Wikipedia, the Motorola Envoy was not released until 1994.  Does anyone else have any additional info on what this device is?  Maybe it's a prototype or early overseas release of the Motorola Envoy?</p><p>

It's the small black device behind Nedry's right elbow.</p><p><img src="https://www.therpf.com/attachments/f9/jurassic-park-tablet-device-nedrys-desk-vlcsnap-2012-12-04-18h24m06s91.png-130520d1354667816" data-url="http://www.therpf.com/attachments/f9/jurassic-park-tablet-device-nedrys-desk-vlcsnap-2012-12-04-18h24m06s91.png-130520d1354667816" data-zoom-target="1" alt="jurassic-park-tablet-device-nedrys-desk-vlcsnap-2012-12-04-18h24m06s91.png-130520d1354667816" title="" width="" height="" loading="lazy">

			<div itemprop="text"><p>Could be a test model of the Envoy 100 someone at Silicone Graphics lent them.  It certainly appears to be branded by Motorola.  They had $875,000 worth of Silicone Graphics hardware, $350,000 from Apple, and $500,000 in additional hardware and software to equip and run the control room.</p><p>

You have a 150 pictured, but from what I read there should not be that significant of a difference in the base of the Envoy between the 150 and 100.  The production model appears to still have the two slots there, but not with the cutout (which likely broke on the test models).</p></div>

<p>Hello, just came across this older thread, but I can tell you definitively what that is on the desk. It's the design mock up from the final presentation to Motorola for the iRadio (name later changed to Envoy). It was designed by me when I was working at frogdesign in California. The head of frogdesign, Hartmut Esslinger met Spielberg on a plane and showed him this mockup. Steven asked if it could be used as a prop in the film, and Hartmut gave it to him. There were three configurations proposed, and this one was the one that Motorola had chosen to pursue. It was a design and engineering proof of concept for the hinge and folding mechanism. It doesn't have the external antenna as the original engineering spec had an internal loop antenna around the screen. Motorola discovered that a flat orientation limited reception, so the external one was added. The two slots were originally for PC cards, but this was later eliminated due to space restrictions.</p>

<p>Glad to be of service! For once I got to supply some information, instead of just gobbling it up. Curious as to what's going to happen with Apple's new iRadio service announced this week, as I believe Motorola had a trademark for this name when we were developing this product. We even created a whole identity and marketing campaign based on iRadio before Motorola changed it to Envoy. Maybe Apple just bought it outright, like they did for iPad, which was owned by Fujitsu (my current employer).</p>

</span>@abl</h3><p>die Telekom nimmt nicht am Peering mit dem Deutschen Forschungsnetz teil und deshalb ist die Verbindung für Telekom-Kunden zu deutschen Universitäten eine Katastrophe. Bei mir sind es gerade über Telia 29 kB/s bei 20% Paketverlust! … Ich hoffe, dass heute jedem die gesellschaftlichen Konsequenzen klar werden. Jetzt wo das Internet so wahnsinnig wichtig ist uns zu verbinden. Stattdessen werden Studenten, Personal in der Lehre und Forschende massiv daran gehindert mit ihrer Hochschule in Kontakt zu bleiben, weiter zu lernen, zu lehren und zu forschen. In den Medien wird diskutiert Netflix zu drosseln damit das Internet wichtigere Sachen machen kann, aber keine Sorge, zu Netflix sagt mein Speedtest 81 Mb/s - mehr als das hundertfache als zu meiner Uni. Ich kann parallel drei 4k Videos schauen, aber das Aufrufen der Corona-Info-Seite meiner Uni wird zur Qual.

Ich habe nun von Ddownload zu Rapidgator gewechselt, weil mir das ständige Zwischenschalten eines VPNs zu lästig wurde. Das bekannte Problem: Ohne VPN erhalte ich eine Download-Geschwindigkeit von 650 kb/s, mit VPN hingegen konstant 23 Mb/s.

They can also be used to enforce constraints like primary keys, unique keys and exclusion. Indexes are important for performance but do not speedup a query unless the query matches the columns and data types in the index. Also, as a very rough rule of thumb, an index will only help if less than 15-20% of the table will be returned in the query, otherwise the query planner, a part of postgres used to determine how the query is going to be executed, might prefer a sequential scan. In fact, reality is much more complex than this rule of thumb. The query planner uses statistics and predefined costs associated with each type of scan to do its job, but we’re only going approach the query planner behavior tangentially in this article. So, if your query returns a large percentage of the table, consider refactoring it, using summary tables or other techniques before throwing an index at the problem. With that in mind, let’s give a closer look at how Postgres stores your data in the disk and how indexes help to speedup querying this data.</p><p>There are six types of indexes available in the default postgres installation and more types available through extensions. Typically, they work by associating a key value with a data location in one or more rows of the table containing that key. Each line is identified by a TID, or tuple id.</p><h3 id="how-data-is-stored-in-disk">How data is stored in disk</h3><p>To understand indexes, it is important to first understand how postgres stores table data on disk. Every table in postgres has one or more corresponding files on disk, depending on its size. This set of files is called a heap and it is divided into 8kb pagesh. All table rows, internally referred to as “tuples”, are saved in these files and do not have a specific order. The index is a tree structure that links the indexes columns to the row locators, also known as ctid, in the heap. We’ll zoom into the index internals later.</p><p>To see the heap files we can use a few postgres internal tables to see where they’re located in the disk. First, we can enter psql and use <code>show data_directory</code> to show the directory Postgres uses to store databases physical files.</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="sql"><span><span> <span>show</span> data_directory;

The reduction in execution time happens because, now, instead of reading all the rows in the table, the database uses the index. The index is a tree structure mapping the value “Ronaldo” to the ctid(s) of the rows that have this value in the <code>name</code> column (in our example we only have one such row). The ctid is then used to quickly locate these rows on the heap.</p><p>If we use <code>\di+</code> to show the indexes in our database we can see that the index we’ve created occupies <code>30MB</code>, roughly the same size as the <code>foo</code> table.</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="sql"><span><span><span>\</span>di<span>+</span>

The more indexes a table has, the greater the amount of disk space required to store them. This incurs in additional storage costs for your database and for backups, increased replication traffic, and increased backup and failover recovery times. Bear in mind that its not uncommon for btree indexes to be larger than the table itself. Learning about partial indexes, and multicolumn indexes, as well as about other more space efficient index types such as BRIN can be helpful.</p><h3 id="write-operations">Write operations</h3><p>Also, there is a maintenance cost in writing operations such as UPDATE, INSERT and DELETE, if a field that is part of an index is modified, the corresponding index needs to be updated, which can add significant overhead to the writing process.</p><h3 id="query-planner">Query planner</h3><p>The query planner (also known as query optimizer) is the component responsible for determining the best execution strategy for a query. With more indexes available, the query planner has more options to consider, which can increase the time needed to plan the query, especially in systems with many complex queries or where there are many indexes available.</p><h3 id="memory-usage">Memory usage</h3><p>PostgreSQL maintains a portion of frequently accessed data and index pages in memory in its shared buffers. When an index is used, the relevant index pages are loaded into shared buffers to speed up access. The more indexes you have and the more they are used, the more shared buffer memory is necessary. Since shared buffers are limited and are also used for caching data pages, filling the shared buffers with indexes can lead to less efficient caching of table data. It’s also good to keep in mind that the whole indexed column is copied in every node of the btree, since there’s a limit in node size capacity, the larger the indexed column the deeper the tree will be.</p><p>Another aspect of memory usage is that PostgreSQL uses work memory when it executes queries that involves sorting or complex index scans (involving multi-column or covering indexes). Larger indexes require more memory for these operations. Also, indexes require memory to store some metadata about their structure, column names and statistics in the system catalog cache. And finally indexes require memory for maintainance operations like vacuuming and reindexing operations.</p><h2 id="types-of-indexes">Types of Indexes</h2><h3 id="btree">Btree</h3><p>The B-Tree is a very powerful data structure, present not only in Postgres but in almost every database management system, since it is a very good general purpose index. It was invented by Rudolf Bayer and Edward M.McCreight while working at Boeing. Nobody really knows if the “B” in B-tree stands for Bayer, Boeing, balanced or better, and it doesn’t really matter. What really matters is that it enables us to search elements in the tree in O(log n) time. If you’re not familiar with Big-O notation, all you need to know is that is is really fast - you only need to make 20 comparisons in order to find an element in a set with 1 million items. Moreover, it can maintain O(log n) time complexity for data sets that are larger than the RAM available on a computer. This means that disks can be used to extend RAM, thanks to the btree efficient prevention of disk page accesses to find the desired data. In PostgreSQL the btree is the most common type of index and its the default, it’s also used to support system and TOAST indexes. Even an empty database has hundreds of btree indexes. It is the only index type that can be used for primary and unique key constraints.</p><p>In contrast with a binary tree, the BTree is a balanced tree and all of its leave nodes have the same distance from the root. The root nodes and inner nodes have pointers to lower levels, and the leaf nodes have the keys and pointers to the heap. Postgres btrees also have pointers to the left and right nodes for easier forward and backward scanning. Nodes can have multiple keys and these keys are sorted so that it’s easy to walk in ordered directions and to perform ORDER BY and JOIN operations. The values are only stored in the leaf nodes, this makes the tree more compact and facilitates a full traversal of the objects in a tree with just a linear pass through all the leaf nodes. This is just a simplified description of PostgreSQL Btree indexes, if you want to get into the low level details, I suggest you to read the <a href="https://github.com/postgres/postgres/blob/master/src/backend/access/nbtree/README">README</a> and the <a href="https://www.csd.uoc.gr/~hy460/pdf/p650-lehman">paper</a> that inspired them.
Below there’s a simplified illustration of a Postgres Btree.</p><p><img src="https://dlt.github.io/blog/images/postgres_btree.png" alt="postgres btree"></p><h4 id="using-multiple-indexes">Using multiple indexes</h4><p>Postgres can use multiple indexes to handle cases that cannot be handled by single index scans, by forming <code>AND</code> and <code>OR</code> conditions across several index scans with the support of bitmaps. The bitmaps are ANDed or ORed together as needed by the query and finally the table rows are visited and returned. Let’s say we have a query like this:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="sql"><span><span><span>select</span> <span>*</span> <span>from</span> users <span>where</span> age <span>=</span> <span>30</span> <span>and</span> login_count <span>=</span> <span>100</span>;</span></span></code></pre></div><p>If the <code>age</code> and <code>login_count</code> columns are indexed, postgres scans index <code>age</code> for all pages with <code>age=30</code> and makes a bitmap where the pages that might contain rows with <code>age=30</code> are true. In a similar way, it builds a bitmap using the <code>login_count</code> index. It then ANDs the two bitmaps to form a third bitmap, and performs a table scan, only reading the pages that might contain candidate values, and only adding the rows where <code>age=30 and login_count=100</code> to the result set.</p><h4 id="multi-column-indexes">Multi-column indexes</h4><p>Multi-column indexes are an alternative for using multiple indexes. They’re generaly going to be smaller and faster than using multiple indexes, but they’ll also be less flexible. That’s because the order of the columns matter, because the database can search for a subset of the indexed columns, as long as they are the leftmost columns. For example, if you have an index on column <code>a</code> and another index on column <code>b</code>, these indexes will serve all the of queries below:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="sql"><span><span><span>select</span> <span>*</span> <span>from</span> my_table <span>where</span> a <span>=</span> <span>42</span> <span>and</span> b <span>=</span> <span>420</span>;
</span></span><span><span>
</span></span><span><span><span>select</span> <span>*</span> <span>from</span> my_table <span>where</span> a <span>=</span> <span>43</span>;
</span></span><span><span>
</span></span><span><span><span>select</span> <span>*</span> <span>from</span> my_table <span>where</span> b <span>=</span> <span>99</span>;</span></span></code></pre></div><p>On the other hand, only the first two queries would use an index if you created a multi-column index on (a, b) with a command like <code>create index on my_table(a, b)</code>; So, when building multi-column indexes choose the order of the columns well so that your index can be used by the most queries possible.</p><h4 id="partial-indexes">Partial indexes</h4><p>Partial indexes allow you to use a conditional expression to control what subset of rows will be indexed, this can bring you many benefits:</p><ul><li>your index can be smaller and more likely fit in RAM.</li><li>your index is shallower, so lookups are quicker</li><li>less overhead for index/update/delete (but can also mean more overhead if the column you’re using to filter rows in/out of the index is updated very frequently triggering constant index maintenance)</li></ul><p>They’re mostly useful in situations where you don’t care about some rows, or when you’re indexing on a column where the proportion of one value is much greater than others. I’ll give two examples below.</p><h5 id="when-you-dont-care-about-some-rows">When you don’t care about some rows</h5><p>Let’s say you have a rules table where the rows can be marked as enabled/disabled, the vast majority of the rows are disabled and in your queries you only care about enabled rows. In this case, you would have a partial index, filtering out the disable rows like this:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="sql"><span><span><span>create</span> <span>index</span> <span>on</span> rules(status) <span>where</span> status <span>=</span> <span>'enabled'</span>;</span></span></code></pre></div><h5 id="when-the-distribution-of-values-is-skewed">When the distribution of values is skewed</h5><p>Now imagine you’re building a todo application and the status column value can be either <code>TODO</code>, <code>DOING</code>, and <code>DONE</code>. Suppose you have 1M rows and this is the current distribution of rows in each status:</p><table><thead><tr><th>Rows</th><th>Status</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>TODO</td><td>90%</td></tr><tr><td>DOING</td><td>5%</td></tr><tr><td>DONE</td><td>5%</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Since postgres keeps statistics about the distribution of values in your table columns and knows that the vast majority of the rows are in the <code>TODO</code> status, it would choose to do a sequential scan on the <code>tasks</code> table when you have <code>status='TODO'</code> in the <code>WHERE</code> clause of your query, even if you have an index on status, leaving most part of the index unused and wasting space. In this case, a partial scan such as the one below is recommended:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="sql"><span><span><span>create</span> <span>index</span> <span>on</span> tasks(status) <span>where</span> status <span>&lt;&gt;</span> <span>'TODO'</span>;</span></span></code></pre></div><h4 id="covering-indexes">Covering indexes</h4><p>If you have a query that selects only columns in an index, Postgres has all information needed by the query in the index and doesn’t need to fetch pages from the heap to return the result. This optimization is called <code>index-only scan</code>. To understand how it works, consider the following scenario:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="sql"><span><span><span>create</span> <span>table</span> bar (a int, b int, <span>c</span> int);
</span></span><span><span><span>create</span> <span>index</span> abc_idx <span>on</span> bar(a, b);
</span></span><span><span>
</span></span><span><span><span>/* query 1 */</span>
</span></span><span><span><span>select</span> a, b <span>from</span> bar;
</span></span><span><span>
</span></span><span><span><span>/* query 2 */</span>
</span></span><span><span><span>select</span> a, b, <span>c</span> <span>from</span> bar;</span></span></code></pre></div><p>In the first query, postgres can do an index-only scan and avoid fetching data from the heap because the values <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> are present in the index. In the second query, since <code>c</code> isn’t in the index, posgres needs to follow the reference to the heap to fetch its value. In the first query we allowed postgres do to an index-only scan with the help of a multi-column index, but we could also achieve the same result by using a covering index. The syntax for creating a covering index looks like this:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="sql"><span><span><span>create</span> <span>index</span> abc_cov_idx <span>on</span> bar(a, b) <span>including</span> <span>c</span>;</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This is more space efficient than creating a multi-column index on (a, b, c), because c will only be inserted at the leaf nodes of the btree. Also, we might want to use a covering index in cases where we want an unique index and <code>c</code> would “break” the uniqueness of the index.</p><h4 id="expression-indexes">Expression indexes</h4><p>Expression indexes to index the result of an expression or function, rather than just the raw column values. This can be extremely useful when you frequently query based on a transformed version of your data. It is necessary if you use a function as part of a where clause as in the example below:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="sql"><span><span><span>CREATE</span> <span>TABLE</span> customers (
</span></span><span><span>    id SERIAL <span>PRIMARY</span> <span>KEY</span>,
</span></span><span><span>    name TEXT
</span></span><span><span>);
</span></span><span><span>
</span></span><span><span><span>CREATE</span> <span>INDEX</span> idx_name <span>ON</span> customers(name);
</span></span><span><span><span>SELECT</span> <span>*</span> <span>FROM</span> customers <span>WHERE</span> <span>LOWER</span>(name) <span>=</span> <span>'john doe'</span>;</span></span></code></pre></div><p>In this example above, Postgres won’t use the index because it was was built against the <code>name</code> column. In order to make it work, the index key has to call the <code>lower</code> function just like it’s used in the where clase. To fix it, do:</p><p>Now, when you run a query like this:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="sql"><span><span><span>CREATE</span> <span>INDEX</span> idx_lower_name <span>ON</span> customers (<span>lower</span>(name));</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Now PostgreSQL can use the expression index to efficiently find the matching rows.</p><p>Expression indexes can be created using various types of expressions:</p><ol><li>Built-in functions: Like <code>lower()</code>, <code>upper()</code>, etc.</li><li>User-defined functions: As long as they are immutable.</li><li>String concatenations: Like <code>first_name || ' ' || last_name</code>.</li></ol><h3 id="hash">Hash</h3><p>The hash index differs from B-Tree in strucutre, it is much more alike a hashmap data structure present in most programming languages (e.g. dict in Python, array in php, HashMap in java, etc). Instead of adding the full column value to the index, a 32bit hash code is derived from it and added to the hash. This makes hash indexes much smaller than btrees when indexing longer data such as UUIDs, URLs, etc. Any data type can be indexed with the help of postgres hashing functions. If you type <code>\df hash*</code> and press TAB in psql, you’ll see that there are more then 50 hash related functions. Although it gracefully handles hash conflicts, it works better for even distribution of hash values and is most suited to unique or mostly unique data. Under the correct conditions it will not only be smaller than btree indexes, but also it will be faster for reads when compared with btress. Here’s what the official docs says about it:</p><blockquote><p>“In a B-tree index, searches must descend through the tree until the leaf page is found. In tables with millions of rows, this descent can increase access time to data. The equivalent of a leaf page in a hash index is referred to as a bucket page. In contrast, a hash index allows accessing the bucket pages directly, thereby potentially reducing index access time in larger tables. This reduction in “logical I/O” becomes even more pronounced on indexes/data larger than shared_buffers/RAM.”</p></blockquote><p>As for its limitations, it only supports equality operations and isn’t going to be helpful if you need to order by the indexed field. It also doesn’t support multi-column indexes and checking for uniqueness.
For a in-depth analysis of how hash indexes fare in relation to btree, check Evgeniy Demin’s <a href="https://evgeniydemin.medium.com/postgresql-indexes-hash-vs-b-tree-84b4f6aa6d61">blog post</a> on the subject.</p><h3 id="brin">BRIN</h3><p>BRIN stands for Block Range Index and its name tells a lot about how it is implemented. Nodes in BRIN indexes store the minimum and maximum values of a range of values present in the page referred by the index. This makes the index more compact and cache friendly, but restricts the use cases for it. If you have a very large in a work load that is heavy on writes and low on deletes and updates. You can think of a BRIN index as an optimizer for sequential scans of large amounts of data in very large databases, and is a good optimization to try before partitioning a table. For a BRIN index to work well, the index key should be a column that strongly correlates to the location of the row in the heap.Some good use cases for BRIN are append-only tables and tables storing time series data.</p><p>BRIN won’t work well for tables where the rows are updated constantly, due to the nature of MVCC that duplicates rows and stores them in a different part of the heap. This tuple duplication and moving affect the correlation negatively and reduces the effectiveness of the index. Using extensions such as pg_repack or pg_squeeze isn’t recommended for tables that use BRIN indexes, since they change the internal data layour fo the table and mess up the correlation. Also, this index is lossy in the sense that the index leaf nodes point to pages taht might contain a value within a particular range. For this reason a BRIN is more helpful if you need to return large subset of data, and a btree would be more read performant for queries that only return one or few rows. You can make the index more or less lossy by adjusting the <code>page_per_range</code> configuration, the trade off will be index size.</p><h3 id="gin">GIN</h3><p>Generalized inverted index is appropriate for when you want to search for an item in composite data, such as finding a word in a blob of text, an item in an array or an object in a JSON. The GIN is generalized in the sense that it doesn’t need to know how it will acelerate the search for some item. Instead, there’s a <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/gin-builtin-opclasses.html">set of custom strategies</a> specific for each data type. Please note that in order to index an JSON value it needs to be stored in a JSONB column. Similarly, if you’re indexing text it’s better to store it as (or convert it to) tsvector or use the <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/pgtrgm.html">pg_trgm</a> extension.</p><h3 id="gist--sp-gist">GiST &amp; SP-GiST</h3><p>The Generalized Search Tree and the Space-Partitioned Generalized Search Tree are tree structures that can be use as a base template to implement indexes for specific data types. You can think of them as framework for building indexes. The GiST is a balanced tree and the SP-GiST allow for the development of non-balanced data structures. They are useful for indexing points and geometric types, inet, ranges and text vectors. You can find an <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/16/gist-builtin-opclasses.html">extensive list</a> of the built-in strategies shipped with postgres in the official documentation. If you need an index to enable full-text search in your application, you’ll have to choose between GIN and GiST. Roughly speaking, GIN is faster for lookups but it’s bigger and has greater building and maintainance costs. So the right index type for you will depend on your application requirements.</p><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>Understanding and effectively using indexes is crucial for optimizing database performance in PostgreSQL. While indexes can greatly speed up query execution and improve overall efficiency, it’s important to be mindful of their impact on write operations and storage. By carefully selecting the appropriate types of indexes based on your specific use cases you can ensure that your PostgreSQL database remains both fast and efficient. I hope this article taught you at least one or two things you didn’t know about Postgres indexes, and that you’re better equiped to deal with different scenarios involving databases from now on.</p></div></article></div>]]></description>

<p id="956aedd1-fd87-4a94-a17d-95c3e4d1855e">Microsoft's January 2026 Patch Tuesday updates for Windows 11 have been a total disaster, seemingly introducing more problems than it fixed. The botched update has already forced the company to issue one emergency out of band update to fix two major issues, and now a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.catalog.update.microsoft.com/Search.aspx?q=KB5078127" data-url="https://www.catalog.update.microsoft.com/Search.aspx?q=KB5078127" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link">second emergency out of band update has been released</a> to address another critical problem.</p><p>This time around, the out of band update is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/microsoft/microsoft-office/microsoft-just-issued-emergency-out-of-band-updates-for-windows-11-but-it-didnt-fix-this-bug-that-makes-outlook-completely-unusable" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.windowscentral.com/microsoft/microsoft-office/microsoft-just-issued-emergency-out-of-band-updates-for-windows-11-but-it-didnt-fix-this-bug-that-makes-outlook-completely-unusable">addressing an issue that caused Outlook and "cloud-backed" applications such as OneDrive and Dropbox to be rendered inoperable</a> after Patch Tuesday. The temporary workaround was to uninstall the latest security updates, but now the KB5078127 update for version 24H2 and 25H2 should mitigate this need.</p><ul id="b3103bd2-e375-41c3-b30d-aad1882dbc4a"><li>Fixed: After installing the Windows update released on and after January 13, 2026, some applications became unresponsive or encountered unexpected errors when opening files from or saving files to cloud-based storage, such as OneDrive or Dropbox. In certain Outlook configurations that store PST files on OneDrive, Outlook may hang and fail to reopen unless the process is terminated or the system is restarted. Users may also see missing sent Items or previously downloaded emails being re‑downloaded.</li></ul><p id="8feda53c-5fb7-4cb1-a40b-4b8ec4acf47b">This same fix is being rolled out to various other versions and editions of Windows too, including Windows 11 version 23H2, Windows Server editions, and more.

The first arrived on January 17, and fixed two major issues that began appearing for users after installing this month's Patch Tuesday updates released on January 13.</p><p>The original Patch Tuesday release introduced an issue that caused PCs running version 23H2 to fail to shutdown or hibernate, and also broke signing into Windows 11 PCs using Remote Desktop. Microsoft addressed these issues in the out of band update issued on January 17, but in the process broke apps like Outlook, OneDrive, and Dropbox.</p><div data-hydrate="true" id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-g7NcskRiqRQAEkrLHHSHuc"><section><p>All the latest news, reviews, and guides for Windows and Xbox diehards.</p></section></div><p>It's clear that the quality bar for Windows is at an all time low right now, marking an absolutely dreadful start to the year for Microsoft and Windows.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2>Living under rocks<span><a href="#living-under-rocks" aria-label="Anchor">#</a></span></h2><p>As anyone that hasn’t been living under a rock might have heard, AI accelerators are the coolest kids in town these days. And although I have never been part of the “in” crowd, this time at least, I get the appeal.</p><p>So when the opportunity arose to join an experimental shuttle using global foundries 180nm for FREE I jumped onto the opportunity and designed my own JTAG!</p><p>…</p><p>I’m sorry? Is this not what you were expecting?</p><p>Frankly, I would love to tell you a great story about how I went into this wanting to design a free and open source silicon proven AI accelerator that the community could freely extend and re-use in their own projects. But in truth this project started out first as me wanting to design some far less sexy, in-silicon debug infrastructure and only later came to include the systolic matrix matrix multiplication accelerator … to serve as the design under test.</p><p>No wonder I was never one of the cool kids.</p><p>Also, I’m designing everything from scratch and have only two weeks left, welcome to the crunch.</p><figure><img src="https://essenceia.github.io/projects/two_weeks_until_tapeout/feature_layout.png" alt="chip render"><figcaption>GDS rendering of this project using the GF180 PDK</figcaption></figure><p><span><span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 512 512"><path fill="currentcolor" d="M506.3 417 293 53c-16.33-28-57.54-28-73.98.0l-213.2 364C-10.59 444.9 9.849 480 42.74 480h426.6c32.76.0 53.26-35 36.96-63zM232 168c0-13.25 10.75-24 24-24s24 10.8 24 24v128c0 13.25-10.75 24-23.1 24S232 309.3 232 296V168zm24 248c-17.36.0-31.44-14.08-31.44-31.44s14.07-31.44 31.44-31.44 31.44 14.08 31.44 31.44C287.4 401.9 273.4 416 256 416z"></path></svg>

Its goal is to provide something to latch onto when my ASIC comes back as an expensive brick and I am frantically trying to figure out where I fucked up. Given I wish to trust it not to be broken, having something that is proven early is very important since my masterplan is to slap it on all my future tapeouts.</p><h2>Project Roadmap<span><a href="#project-roadmap" aria-label="Anchor">#</a></span></h2><p>Alright, I have to admit something: <del>I embellished reality in order to make myself look good</del> I lied. Although initially I had 2 weeks to do this tapeout,
because I spent the first 4 days reeling from the after effects of my previous tapeout (aka: sleeping, going outside and talking to another human being) and “deciding on a technical direction” which is corporate speech for describing a mixture between “procrastinating” and “figuring out what I could build without sacrificing too much of my remaining sanity”, I now had 10 days left. You’re welcome.</p><p>Given my self-imposed dire straits of a timeline, if I wanted to have any hope whatsoever of meeting the tapeout deadline I needed a battle plan: here is the roadmap.</p><div><pre>---

~ a wise man</p></blockquote><h3>Flow saves the day<span><a href="#flow-saves-the-day" aria-label="Anchor">#</a></span></h3><p>So, why am I doing this to myself? Well, self delusion is a powerful force, and it was telling me this timeline would be possible if I leveraged my previous experience with the Tiny Tapeout/Librelane/OpenROAD flows, my existing personal linting/simulation/fpga/firmware flows, my existing code bases, and my own <del>ingrained knowledge of the dark arts</del> experience.</p><p>But, let us not delude ourselves, the saving grace of this terrible idea was really just how great the Tiny Tapeout/Librelane/OpenROAD ASIC flow is.</p><p><a href="https://openroad.readthedocs.io/en/latest/" target="_blank">The OpenROAD project</a> was conceived with a no-human-in-the-loop (NHIL) target, and the goal of enabling 24-hour-or-less design turnaround times.</p><p><a href="https://librelane.readthedocs.io/en/latest/" target="_blank">Librelane</a>, the master coordinator of the flow itself, brings together
OpenROAD, Yoysy, ABC, Magic, and many more amazing open source tools, building on top of this philosophy.
Creating a process that takes you from your verilog and a few configurations all the way to the tapeout ready artifacts, in an extremely streamlined and fast fashion, requiring minimal human intervention.</p><p>Tiny Tapeout then completes the loop, running your testbenches on top of the entire implementation, and then allowing you to automatically upload your GDSII for integration into the shuttle chip.</p><p>This deeply resonates with my personal beliefs that faster iteration times are central to higher quality and more efficient design :</p><blockquote><p>Since I believe a low iteration time is paramount to project velocity and getting big things done, I also want to automatize all of the Vivado flow from taking the rtl to the SVF generation.<br><a href="https://essenceia.github.io/projects/alibaba_cloud_fpga/" target="_blank">~ Previous article: Alibaba cloud FPGA: the 200$ Kintex UltraScale+</a></p></blockquote><p>Thus, not only was I building on top of a legacy of efficient design flows, but I had previously <del>spent</del> invested a lot of time streamlining my tasks, especially repetitive ones.</p><p>A classic example would be my FPGA build flow used for emulation. It only requires a single command to create the Vivado project, read all the rtl and constraint files, synthesize, optionally add an ILA core and connect any wires marked for debug to it, implement, and then flash the bitstream :</p><p>Essentially, the bottleneck to making this design, from scratch in 10 days, wasn’t going to be the tools, but the squishy human between the chair and the keyboard.</p><figure><img src="https://essenceia.github.io/projects/two_weeks_until_tapeout/homo_electronicus.jpg" alt="me only my couch"><figcaption><strong>homo electro-engineerus</strong> observed in its natural habitat in a pre-tapeout hibernation period known as a ‘crunch’. During this period, the specimen will seldom move from its cave, surviving exclusively on a diet of ‘coffee’ and ‘HEB smoked ham’.</figcaption></figure><h2>Design<span><a href="#design" aria-label="Anchor">#</a></span></h2><p>Without further ado, let’s talk design !</p><h2>Systolic Array Design<span><a href="#systolic-array-design" aria-label="Anchor">#</a></span></h2><p>The goal of this systolic array is to perform a 2×2 matrix-matrix multiply on 8-bit integer numbers.</p><p>Without going too much into detail on why systolic arrays are the recurring stars at the heart of modern AI inference accelerators,
their main strength is achieving a high ratio of compute to everything else. And since memory operations are the most
expensive family of operations by far, a hh ratio of compute to memory operations.</p><p>Data is recirculated directly within the array and reused across multiple consecutive operations rather than
being repeatedly fetched/written from/to memory. This matters because memory accesses are expensive.
SRAM accesses cost time and significant power, while DRAM accesses cost eternities of time and egregious amounts of power.
Compute operations, even 64 bit floating point multiplications, are by comparison, cheap.</p><p>Thus, the larger the systolic array, the deeper the chain of compute, the better this compute to memory ratio becomes.</p><h4>Energy ratio<span><a href="#energy-ratio" aria-label="Anchor">#</a></span></h4><p><span></span><span>The following sub-section is me geeking out on power consumption numbers.
If you don’t have a deeply engrained passion for discussing pJ (pico Joules) you can safely skip it, I won’t judge you.</span></p><p>As an illustrative example of this evolution of compute ratios, let us compare the power cost of 64 bit floating point multiply-add (MAC) operations in a hypothetical systolic array designed on a 45nm node running at 0.9V.</p><p>Compared with the energy expenditure needed to access this data using 256 bit wide reads to the 16nm DRAM. DRAM access costs will include the 10mm of wire, interface and access costs.</p><p>In this example, we will very generously assume the weights are stored in place and do not need to be updated, so will assume only the input data matrix needs to be read from DRAM.</p><table><thead><tr><th>Operation</th><th>45 nm</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>16-bit integer multiply</td><td>2 pJ</td></tr><tr><td>64-bit floating-point multiply-add</td><td>50 pJ</td></tr><tr><td>64-bit access to 8-Kbyte SRAM</td><td>14 pJ</td></tr><tr><td>256-bit access to 1-Mbyte SRAM</td><td>566 pJ</td></tr><tr><td>256-bit 10 mm wire</td><td>310 pJ</td></tr><tr><td>256-bit DRAM interface</td><td>5,120 pJ</td></tr><tr><td>256-bit DRAM access</td><td>2,048 pJ</td></tr></tbody></table><p>source: <a href="https://chipgen.stanford.edu/people/alum/pdf/1309_KrishnaMalladi_EnergyProportionalMem.pdf" target="_blank">ENERGY PROPORTIONAL MEMORY SYSTEMS</a></p><p>Even though I purposefully chose 64 bit floats, the most energy intensive arithmetic operation,
we still required a 64x64 systolic array before the cost of compute started exceeding the cost of the initial DRAM value reads.</p><p>aka: For those not living in 2026, we have uncovered a new clue to the mystery of where all the low-power DRAM chips have suddenly vanished to!</p><h4>Scaling<span><a href="#scaling" aria-label="Anchor">#</a></span></h4><p>Another great feature of systolic arrays is how regular they are and how well their design scales. So, although today I am designing a small 2x2 array, without much re-work this can be scaled up to a larger 256x256 array.</p><p>Some of you might be wondering: if area is free and systolic arrays scale so well, why am I limiting myself to only making a 2x2 array ?</p><p>Well, because I am a good neighbor and any additional tile of area I use is potentially depriving someone else from having the area available to submit their project.</p><p>Since the initial motivation for this project was to design some proven in silicon debug infrastructure, a 2x2 array is sufficient for my needs.</p><h3>Constraints<span><a href="#constraints" aria-label="Anchor">#</a></span></h3><p>Since this ASIC is once again taping out as part of a Tiny Tapeout shuttle, it has to grapple with the similar limitations as my <a href="https://essenceia.github.io/projects/blake2s_hashing_accelerator_a_solo_tapeout_journey/#io-bottleneck" target="_blank">previous hashing accelerator</a>, namely: the eternal I/O bandwidth limitation!</p><figure><img src="https://essenceia.github.io/projects/two_weeks_until_tapeout/chip.svg" alt="chip schematic"><figcaption>Tiny Tapeout chip (I recommend switching the page to light mode for better readability of the pin names)</figcaption></figure><p>This limitations comes in two flavors:</p><ol><li>Pin count: eight input pins, eight output pins, and eight configurable I/O pins, limiting my parallel buses in and out of the accelerator.</li><li>Maximum operating frequency: unlike with the well-trodden path that was the public Skywater 130nm shuttle tapeout, for this experimental shuttle the maximum switching frequency of these pins hasn’t been characterized yet. And since I haven’t yet figured out how to do this characterization using a simulator myself, I’ve hand-wavingly assumed that both the input and output directions have a sustainable switching frequency of 50 MHz, and have sized the path timings around that assumption.</li></ol><p>Additionally, I once again have the constraint of not having any SRAM. Though unlike with the Skywater 130 tapeout, the GlobalFoundries 180nm PDK does include a proven SRAM macro!</p><p>Hooray! Human progress is unstoppable !</p><p>This time, the limitation was actually imposed by the experimental nature of this shuttle.</p><p>Firstly, the flow didn’t initially support these macros out of the box. More specifically in the way they were laid out, which led to a slew of DRC failures that needed to be fixed.</p><p>Secondly, this experimental shuttle didn’t provide individual project power gating. As such, integrating this SRAM macro was commonly deemed not the best idea, and the community collectively agreed to wait for a future shuttle, which would include per-project macro power gating, before including it.</p><h3>Design Details<span><a href="#design-details" aria-label="Anchor">#</a></span></h3><p>This system is broken into two parts :</p><ul><li>the compute units</li><li>the main array controller</li></ul><h3>Compute units<span><a href="#compute-units" aria-label="Anchor">#</a></span></h3><p>Since this is a 2×2 systolic array, there are four compute units. Each unit takes in an 8 bit signed integer and performs a multiply, addition, and a clamping operation, producing 8 bit signed integers.</p><figure><img src="https://essenceia.github.io/projects/two_weeks_until_tapeout/compute_unit.svg" alt="shematic"><figcaption>Compute unit critical path.</figcaption></figure><h4>Multiplication<span><a href="#multiplication" aria-label="Anchor">#</a></span></h4><p>The multiply is done using a custom (from scratch) implementation of a Booth Radix-4 multiplier with Wallace trees.</p><p>This multiplier architecture strikes a good balance between area, power and performance, and can be regarded as the multiplier equivalent of what “Rental White™"[1] is to interior design.</p><p>Meaning it is a solid, well rounded from a PPA’s perspective, multiplier option, that without being anything novel or groundbreaking, is probably good enough for your use case (and given my +2ns of worst negative slack, and comfortable area occupancy, it was plenty good enough for mine).</p><p>Another advantage of booth radix-4 is that, since we are performing a signed multiplication, we can optimize out a level in the Wallace tree we are using for the partial product additions given we only have 4 partial products, unlike the 5 needed for unsigned operations.</p><p><span></span><span><p>The original article plan included an in-depth explanation of the booth radix-4 multiplication implementation and optimization, resulting in a very interesting but also very dry multi-page explanation covered with boolean algebra. Resulting in its canning.</p><p>If you are looking for a good explanation of this multiplier and its optimization see chapter 11 of ‘CMOS VLSI Design: A Circuits and Systems Perspective’.</p><p><a href="https://pages.hmc.edu/harris/cmosvlsi/4e/index.html" target="_blank">Link to David Money Harris (co-author) blog.</a></p></span></p><h4>Clamping<span><a href="#clamping" aria-label="Anchor">#</a></span></h4><p>The clamping operation occurs after both the multiply and addition operations. At which point the data is now 17 bit wide, and since we want to prevent our data size from exploding, the clamping operation is needed to clamp the outgoing data back down to eight bits.</p><p>$$
clamp_{i8}(x) = \begin{cases}
\phantom{-}127,\,\text{if}\,x &gt; 127, \\
\phantom{-12}x,\,\text{if}\,x \in [-128,127], \\
-128,\,\text{if}\,x &lt; -128
\end{cases}
$$</p><h4>In place weight storage<span><a href="#in-place-weight-storage" aria-label="Anchor">#</a></span></h4><p>Given that the weights have high temporal and spatial locality, meaning the same set of weights can be reused over multiple unique input data matrices, in order to save on bandwidth, the choice was made to store an 8 bit weight in place inside of each unit.</p><p>A separate control sequence allows the user to load a new set of weights inside each of the units.

</span></span><span><p>This animation is not a carbon copy of my accelerator. Rather, readers should use this animation as a tool to better understand how data flows in a
systolic array and how it results in the computation of a matrix-matrix multiplication. For the sake of completeness, I would like to point out the major differences with my implementation:</p><ul><li>this animation uses floating-point numbers, I am using 8-bit integers</li><li>there is no clamping step</li><li>the timings are not entirely identical. In my accelerator, many more operations occur on the same cycle. Granted, this was probably done in an effort to help make the animation more legible.</li></ul></span></p><p>In addition to helping shape the input data to the systolic array, this controller also helps coordinate data transfers around my I/O limitations.</p><p>Given the parallel data bus allows only 8 bits of input data to arrive per cycle, it is used to control the input buffers in order to accumulate enough data to create the next wave.</p><p>Similarly on the output side, when the accelerator produces two 8-bit results per cycle, the controller stores the results in an output buffer in order to only stream out 8 bits per cycle.</p><figure><img src="https://essenceia.github.io/projects/two_weeks_until_tapeout/array_controller.svg" alt="shematic"><figcaption>Array Controller interfacing with both the input and output data buffers.</figcaption></figure><h3>Validation<span><a href="#validation" aria-label="Anchor">#</a></span></h3><p>Validation was an extremely important step for this systolic array, particularly for validating my custom implementation of the Booth Radix-4 multiplication.</p><p>Once again, I used Cocotb as the abstracting layer allowing me to interface with multiple different simulators. Namely, icarus verilog for my standard verification and CVC for the post implementation timing annotated netlist.<br>This validation followed my standard approach of providing a set of input data matrices and weights over the standard accelerators interfaces and comparing the produced results to the expected values.</p><p>Given the nature of the problem, I made extensive use of randomization in order to get better testing coverage and attempt to hit corner cases that would not have been revealed using a directed approach. This randomization randomized both the values of the inputs weight and data, and also the timings with which this incoming data was fed over the parallel bus to the accelerator.</p><h3>Firmware<span><a href="#firmware" aria-label="Anchor">#</a></span></h3><p>The firmware used to interface with this accelerator was designed to run on the RP2040 Raspberry Pi silicon and used the PIO hardware block to drive the parallel port.</p><p>I followed a similar approach as with my hashing accelerator, co-designing with the PIO imposed limitation when designing the parallel bus protocol.</p><p>Although this was designed for an RP2040, I later learned that the Tiny Tapeout boards would be evolving to a new version of the chip. These new PCBs would use a different pinout layout for communicating with the ASIC chips.</p><p>Although this will necessitate to re-adapt parts of the firmware for the new dev boards, this shouldn’t cause any major incompatibilities.</p><h2>JTAG TAP Design<span><a href="#jtag-tap-design" aria-label="Anchor">#</a></span></h2><p>The second major component of this design and admittedly the actual principle piece of this ASIC is the JTAG TAP.</p><p>As stated earlier when my ASIC comes back as a glorified paperweight I will suddenly have a strong and immediate need for some
kind of hardware block providing some in-silicon observability.</p><p>This is absolutely crucial, as it isn’t a question of if but when one of my ASIC will have hardware issues.<br>And, when that day comes, not having a view of the internal behavior will only make it that much more painful to identify the root issue in order to fix it for the upcoming generation.</p><p>As such, this TAP is actually a part of my larger efforts to help produce a set of DFT (Design for Test) proven IPs/tools that I can integrate into all of my future ASICs. As such, I have quite an incentive to have these designs proven early.</p><p>JTAG was chosen as it is a very common debug protocol. Not only is it well-defined but has good off-the-shelf support, both on the hardware (debug probes) and software side.</p><h3>JTAG Implementation<span><a href="#jtag-implementation" aria-label="Anchor">#</a></span></h3><p>In addition to implementing all of the basic JTAG features in order to be compliant with the protocol, I additionally added custom instructions, extending it to fit my personal requirements.</p><p>Required instructions :</p><ul><li><code>EXTEST</code>, opcode <code>0x0</code>, boundary scan operation</li><li><code>IDCODE</code>, opcode <code>0x1</code>, read JTAG tap identifiers, which allows the hardware to advertise itself on the JTAG scan chain</li><li><code>SAMPLE_PRELOAD</code>, opcode <code>0x2</code>, boundary scan operation</li><li><code>BYPASS</code>, opcode <code>0x7</code>, set the TAP in bypass mode</li></ul><p>Custom instructions :</p><ul><li><code>USER_REG</code>, opcode <code>0x3</code>, custom instruction used to probe the internal registers</li></ul><p>The systolic array is quite a deep structure in the sense that the data is directly reused as it is recirculated within the
array.</p><p>As such, it is very easy to lose track of what the internal state is, having only the input and output observable to the user.
Although this might stay manageable with a 2 x 2 array.
As the structure grows larger, this will start to become more and more of an issue.</p><p>In order to help address this future pain point, I added the custom <code>USER_REG</code> JTAG
instruction to read the current state of a target compute units internal registers.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/Essenceia/Systolic_MAC_with_DFT/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#user_reg" target="_blank">Link to the datasheet of the <code>USER_REG</code> instruction.</a></p><h3>Design<span><a href="#design-1" aria-label="Anchor">#</a></span></h3><p>The JTAG TAP design itself is quite straightforward as JTAG was conceived as a hardware first protocol, and this shows
in its implementation. The design clearly flows from the JTAG specification to the RTL (unlike you BLAKE2 I am looking at you!).
As such I do not think it is worthwhile to discuss it in detail.</p><p>What makes this design more interesting is how the JTAG and the systolic array live in two different clock domains. Making this accelerator have not one but two separate clock trees.</p><p>On the altar of this noble cause, I sacrificed one of my precious data input pins to serve as the JTAG clock input (TCK).</p><figure><img src="https://essenceia.github.io/projects/two_weeks_until_tapeout/array_clk.webp" alt=""><figcaption>Clock tree of clk, the clock from the systolic array.</figcaption></figure><br><figure><img src="https://essenceia.github.io/projects/two_weeks_until_tapeout/tck_tree.webp" alt="clk tree 1"><figcaption>Clock tree of the tck, the clk for the JTAG. You can see it spreads towards the systolic array logic, because it is accessing the internal registers of the compute units.</figcaption></figure><p>The SDC script I used to generate these two clock trees drew heavy inspiration from the official LibreLane clock generation SDC, but was re-adapted from my contorted used case:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="tcl"><span><span><span># modified librelane base.sdc to support 2 clocks

I met this absurd self-imposed deadline and the chip is now in fabrication!</p><p>This project was a battle against time. But making it fit in the end is something I’m honestly very proud of.</p><p>One of the big difficulties was to not get side-tracked. Even if it was frustrating,
I had to commit to only adding the minimal set of features needed to get the project rolling.
And trust me, the temptation to add, just that one extra little teeny-tiny feature, either to the systolic array or the debug system,
was excruciating.</p><p>The good news is that, with this upcoming tapeout (<a href="https://github.com/Essenceia/DFT_FPGA_Emulation" target="_blank">v2 has already started</a>), I can finally lash out !!
My grand strategy is for the next project to be an improvement of both concepts.</p><p>Firstly, I’d like to finally have a rematch with an old adversary of mine: Floating Point arithmetics!
Less for the TOPS-&gt;FLOPS bragging rights, but rather to finally pierce its deep mysteries
through an optimized hardware implementation of my own.</p><p>Secondly, I will continue extending my debug infrastructure: adding scan chains and an ATPG flow not only to help
identify silicon manufacturing issues, but also as a convenient way to extract the current state of all flops

  <p><span>When California neighborhoods increased their number of zero-emissions vehicles (ZEV) between 2019 and 2023, they also experienced a reduction in air pollution. For every 200 vehicles added, nitrogen dioxide (NO₂) levels dropped 1.1%. The results, obtained from a new analysis based on statewide satellite data, are among the first to confirm the environmental health benefits of ZEVs, which include fully electric and plug-in hybrid cars, in the real world. The study was funded in part by the National Institutes of Health and just published in <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanplh/article/PIIS2542-5196(25)00257-8/fulltext">The Lancet Planetary Health</a>.</span></p>

</p>
<p>While the shift to electric vehicles is largely aimed at curbing climate change in the future, it is also expected to improve air quality and benefit public health in the near term. But few studies have tested that assumption with actual data, partly because ground-level air pollution monitors have limited spatial coverage. A 2023 study from the Keck School of Medicine of USC using these ground-level monitors suggested that <a href="https://keck.usc.edu/news/study-links-adoption-of-electric-vehicles-with-less-air-pollution-and-improved-health/"><span>ZEV adoption was linked to lower air pollution</span></a><span>, but the results were not definitive.</span></p>
<p><span>Now, the same research team has confirmed the link with high-resolution satellite data, which can detect NO₂ in the atmosphere by measuring how the gas absorbs and reflects sunlight. The pollutant, released from burning fossil fuels, can trigger asthma attacks, cause bronchitis, and increase the risk of heart disease and stroke.</span></p>
<p><span>“This immediate impact on air pollution is really important because it also has an immediate impact on health. We know that traffic-related air pollution can harm respiratory and cardiovascular health over both the short and long term,” said </span><a href="https://keck.usc.edu/faculty-search/erika-garcia/"><span>Erika Garcia, PhD, MPH</span></a><span>, assistant professor of population and public health sciences at the Keck School of Medicine and the study’s senior author.</span></p>
<p><span>The findings offer support for the continued adoption of electric vehicles. Over the study period, ZEV registrations increased from 2% to 5% of all light-duty vehicles (a category that includes cars, SUVs, pickup trucks and vans) across California, suggesting that the potential for improving air pollution and public health remains largely untapped.</span></p>
<p><span>“We’re not even fully there in terms of electrifying, but our research shows that California’s transition to electric vehicles is already making measurable differences in the air we breathe,” said the study’s lead author,&nbsp;</span><a href="https://keck.usc.edu/faculty-search/sandrah-proctor-eckel/"><span>Sandrah Eckel, PhD</span></a><span>, associate professor of population and public health sciences at the Keck School of Medicine.</span></p>
<h3><span><b>Tracking neighborhood air quality</b></span></h3>
<p><span>For the analysis, the researchers divided California into 1,692 neighborhoods, using a geographic unit similar to zip codes. They obtained publicly available data from the state’s Department of Motor Vehicles on the number of ZEVs registered in each neighborhood. ZEVs include full-battery electric cars, plug-in hybrids and fuel-cell cars, but not heavier duty vehicles like delivery trucks and semi trucks.</span></p>
<p><span>Next, the research team obtained data from the Tropospheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI), a high-resolution satellite sensor that provides daily, global measurements of NO₂ and other pollutants. They used this data to calculate annual average NO₂ levels in each California neighborhood from 2019 to 2023.</span></p>
<p><span>Over the study period, a typical neighborhood gained 272 ZEVs, with most neighborhoods adding between 18 and 839. For every 200 new ZEVs registered, NO₂ levels dropped 1.1%, a measurable improvement in air quality.</span></p>
<p><span>“These findings show that cleaner air isn’t just a theory—it’s already happening in communities across California,” Eckel said.</span></p>
<h3><span><b>Electric vehicles and public health</b></span></h3>
<p><span>To confirm that these results were reliable, the researchers conducted several additional analyses. They accounted for pandemic-related changes as a contributor to NO₂ decline, such as excluding the year 2020 and controlling for changing gas prices and work-from-home patterns. The researchers also confirmed that neighborhoods that added more gas-powered cars saw the expected rise in pollution. Finally, they replicated their results using updated data from ground-level monitors from 2012 to 2023.</span></p>
<p><span>“We tested our analysis in many different ways, and the results consistently support our main finding,” Garcia said.</span></p>
<p><span>These results show that TROPOMI satellite data—which covers nearly the entire planet—can reliably track changes in combustion-related air pollution, offering a new way to study the effects of the transition to electric vehicles and other environmental interventions.</span></p>
<p><span>Next, Garcia, Eckel and their team are comparing data on ZEV adoption with data on asthma-related emergency room visits and hospitalizations across California. The study could be one of the first to document real-world health improvements as California continues to embrace electric vehicles.</span></p>
<h3><span><b>About this research</b></span></h3>

Silva and Jill Johnston from the Department of Population and Public Health Sciences, Keck School of Medicine of USC, University of Southern California; Daniel L. Goldberg from the Milken Institute School of Public Health, The George Washington University; Lawrence A.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
				
				
<p>We recently got an industrial X-Ray machine in the Eclypsium office to use to <s>make the next Doctor Manhattan</s> do serious cybersecurity research. In between X-raying yet-to-be released industrial IT technologies on behalf of giant companies whose names we cannot reveal, we have done some other fun experiments.</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" width="1600" height="1234" src="https://eclypsium.com/wp-content/uploads/xray-machine-1.png" alt="Eclypsium researcher preparing to x-ray a suspicious USB cable."></figure>



<p>One thing we’ve done with it so far was to x-ray some FTDI USB to UART cables. We had an old cable lying around that seemed a little suspicious and dysfunctional. It worked at slow speeds but it failed when transferring firmware images from a product. These failures drove us to purchase the known good cables from DigiKey, which worked as expected. It is possible that this older cable came from a factory which also produced older generations of authentic FTDI cables, but this particular chip didn’t meet the performance requirements for the FTDI brand. Or maybe it was just a production run based on stolen FTDI IP. Or it is actually completely unrelated to any FTDI IC but has been programmed to claim to be FTDI in software. Unless we could match the silicon exactly to a known supply chain, we can really only speculate.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>In either case, we wanted to see the difference between the suspicious cable and a newer, more obviously “legit” one that cost about $20 from <a href="https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/ftdi-future-technology-devices-international-ltd/TTL-234X-3V3/6823715">DigiKey</a>. It is not a stretch to assume that a suspicious looking cable is a counterfeit. <a href="https://ftdichip.com/anti-counterfeit-products/">FTDI has publicly announced issues with counterfeit devices</a>. They have even fought back with<a href="https://hackaday.com/2014/10/22/watch-that-windows-update-ftdi-drivers-are-killing-fake-chips/"> drivers which brick counterfeit chips</a>. Some people have even referred to this as vendor sanctioned malware.</p>



<p>Here’s what the two cables look like to the naked eye:&nbsp;</p>


<div>
<figure><img decoding="async" width="512" height="384" src="https://eclypsium.com/wp-content/uploads/xray-machine-2.png" alt="" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20512%20384'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-src="https://eclypsium.com/wp-content/uploads/xray-machine-2.png"></figure></div>


<p>Take a look at the two x-ray images below and see if you can tell which one is suspicious, and which one is authentic. Then scroll down and we’ll tell you what we see.</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" width="1423" height="801" src="https://eclypsium.com/wp-content/uploads/usb-cable-xray-1.png" alt="Xray of an authentic USB cable." data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201423%20801'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-src="https://eclypsium.com/wp-content/uploads/usb-cable-xray-1.png"></figure>



<figure><img decoding="async" width="1423" height="801" src="https://eclypsium.com/wp-content/uploads/usb-cable-xray-2.png" alt="" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201423%20801'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-src="https://eclypsium.com/wp-content/uploads/usb-cable-xray-2.png"></figure>



<p>Before we tell you the answer, here are some clues to look out for in each picture. The authentic cable has the following features visible in the X-Ray image, not shared with the suspicious cable:</p>



<ol>
<li>Ground pours (reduces impedance and ground loops while improving EMI resistance and thermal dissipation). While there is some <a href="https://resources.altium.com/p/shaky-ground-arguments-against-copper-pours">debate about the actual value of copper ground pours</a>, they are still used by reputable manufacturers.</li>



<li>Ground stapling</li>



<li>Decoupling passives nearer to the main integrated circuit (IC)</li>



<li>More isolation passives for USB data pins</li>



<li>Thermal pad under IC</li>



<li>Engineered strain relief for wire connections</li>



<li>More solder for mechanical tabs on USB A connector</li>



<li>Smaller/newer silicon process</li>



<li>Better passive alignment</li>
</ol>



<h2 id="h-the-big-reveal-and-the-implications-for-supply-chain-security"><strong>The Big Reveal, and the Implications for Supply Chain Security</strong></h2>



<p>OK, the top image above is the authentic cable. The bottom image is the more questionable one.</p>



<p>Did you get it right? If not, go back and see if you can pinpoint the various clues.</p>



<p>The point is that, even when you know what to look for, spotting a counterfeit isn’t necessarily easy. The consequences for a consumer buying a shady USB cable likely aren’t too bad. But what happens when an enterprise gets counterfeit network gear with a backdoor pre-installed? Or when a major bank receives grey market servers with another company’s data on them? Eclypsium has helped major worldwide organizations discover exactly these types of supply chain issues.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Supply chain risk is growing rapidly. As AI data center projects capture more and more of the global supply for chips, memory, storage, and other key resources, the secondary market for all of these is heating up. The speed and complexity of these supply chains leaves gaps that cyber adversaries can exploit to introduce vulnerable components and backdoors into tech that makes its way into critical infrastructure.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Imagine the internet suddenly stops working. Payment systems in your local food store go down. Healthcare systems in the regional hospital flatline. Your work software tools, and all the information they contain, disappear.</p>

<p>You reach out for information but struggle to communicate with family and friends, or to get the latest updates on what is happening, as social media platforms are all down. Just as someone can pull the plug on your computer, it’s possible to shut down the system it connects to. </p>

<p>This isn’t an outlandish scenario. Technical failures, cyber-attacks and natural disasters can all bring down key parts of the internet. And as the US government makes increasing demands of European leaders, it is possible to imagine Europe losing access to the digital infrastructure provided by US firms as part of the geopolitical bargaining process. </p>

<p>At the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, the EU’s president, Ursula von der Leyen, <a href="https://www.euronews.com/my-europe/2026/01/20/in-davos-von-der-leyen-pitches-european-independence-versus-trumps-worldview">has highlighted</a> the “structural imperative”  for Europe to “build a new form of independence” – including in its technological capacity and security. And, in fact, moves are already being made across the continent to start regaining some independence from US technology.</p>

<p>A small number of US-headquartered big tech companies now control a large proportion of the world’s <a href="https://theconversation.com/topics/cloud-computing-243">cloud computing</a> infrastructure, that is the global network of remote servers that store, manage and process all our apps and data. Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud are reported to hold about <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/ATAG/2025/780413/ECTI_ATA(2025)780413_EN.pdf">70% of the European market</a>, while European cloud providers have <a href="https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/european-cloud-providers-hold-15-of-local-market-share-synergy-research/">only 15%</a>.</p>

<p>My <a href="https://www.linaker.se/">research</a> supports the idea that relying on a few global providers increases vulnerabilty for Europe’s private and public sectors – including the risk of cloud computing disruption, whether caused by technical issues, <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115092243259973570">geopolitical disputes</a> or malicious activity.</p>

<p>Two recent examples – both the result of apparent technical failures – were the hours‑long <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/oct/24/amazon-reveals-cause-of-aws-outage">AWS incident</a> in October 2025, which disrupted thousands of services such as banking apps across the world, and the major <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/dec/05/another-cloudflare-outage-takes-down-websites-linkedin-zoom">Cloudflare incident</a> two months later, which took LinkedIn, Zoom and other communication platforms offline. </p>

<p>The impact of a major power disruption on cloud computing services was also demonstrated when Spain, Portugal and some of south-west France endured a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/apr/28/spain-and-portugal-power-outage-cause-cyber-attack-electricity">massive power cut</a> in April 2025.</p>

          </figure>

<h2>What happens in a digital blackout?</h2>

<p>There are signs that Europe is starting to take the need for greater digital independence more seriously. In the Swedish coastal city of Helsingborg, for example, a <a href="https://www.dagenssamhalle.se/samhalle-och-valfard/digitalisering/helsingborg-satsar-pa-digital-suveranitet-nytt-projekt-ska-starka-motstandskraften/">one-year project</a> is testing how various public services would function in the scenario of a digital blackout. </p>

<p>Would elderly people still receive their medical prescriptions? Can social services continue to provide care and benefits to all the city’s residents?</p>

<p>This pioneering project seeks to quantify the full range of human, technical and legal challenges that a collapse of technical services would create, and to understand what level of risk is acceptable in each sector. The aim is to build a model of crisis preparedness that can be shared with other municipalities and regions later this year.</p>

<p>Elsewhere in Europe, other forerunners are taking action to strengthen their <a href="https://www.linaker.se/blog/how-denmark-is-waking-up-to-the-challenge-of-digital-sovereignty/">digital sovereignty</a> by weaning themselves off reliance on global big tech companies – in part through collaboration and adoption of open source software. This technology is treated as a digital public good that can be moved between different clouds and operated under sovereign conditions.</p>

<p>In northern Germany, the state of <a href="https://www.heise.de/en/news/Goodbye-Microsoft-Schleswig-Holstein-relies-on-Open-Source-and-saves-millions-11105459.html">Schleswig-Holstein</a> has made perhaps the clearest break with digital dependency. The state government has replaced most of its Microsoft-powered computer systems with open-source alternatives, cancelling nearly 70% of its licenses. Its target is to use big tech services only in exceptional cases by the end of the decade.</p>

<p>Across France, Germany, the Netherlands and Italy, governments are <a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/news/digital-commons-edic-launches-advance-europes-technological-sovereignty">investing</a> both nationally and transnationally in the development of digital open-source platforms and tools for chat, video and document management – akin to digital Lego bricks that administrations can host <a href="https://www.opendesk.eu/en">on their own terms</a>.</p>

<p>In Sweden, a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5H_oifdVWbw">similar system</a> for chat, video and online collaboration, developed by the National Insurance Agency, runs in domestic data centres rather than foreign clouds. It is being offered as a service for Swedish public authorities looking for sovereign digital alternatives.</p>

<h2>Your choices matter</h2>

<p>For Europe – and any nation – to meaningfully address the risks posed by digital blackout and cloud collapse, digital infrastructure needs to be treated with the same seriousness as physical infrastructure such as ports, roads and power grids.</p>

<p>Control, maintenance and crisis preparedness of digital infrastructure should be seen as core public responsibilities, rather than something to be outsourced to global big tech firms, open for foreign influence.</p>

<p>To encourage greater focus on digital resilience among its member states, the EU has developed a <a href="https://commission.europa.eu/document/09579818-64a6-4dd5-9577-446ab6219113_en">cloud sovereignty framework</a> to guide procurement of cloud services – with the intention of keeping European data under European control. The upcoming <a href="https://www.mlex.com/mlex/articles/2384011/-effective-control-concept-for-cloud-sovereignty-eyed-by-eu-commission">Cloud and AI Development Act</a> is expected to bring more focus and resources to this area.</p>

<p>Governments and private companies should be encouraged to demand security, openness and interoperability when seeking bids for provision of their cloud services – not merely low prices. But in the same way, as individuals, we can all make a difference with the choices we make.</p>

<p>Just as it’s advisable to ensure your own access to food, water and medicine in a time of crisis, be mindful of what services you use personally and professionally. Consider where your emails, personal photos and conversations are stored. Who can access and use your data, and under what conditions? How easily can everything be backed up, retrieved and transferred to another service?</p>

<p>No country, let alone continent, will ever be completely digitally independent, and nor should they be. But by pulling together, Europe can ensure its digital systems remain accessible even in a crisis – just as is expected from its physical infrastructure.</p>

                        <p>Amazon is expected to undergo another round of layoffs next week, according to an exclusive report from <em><a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/world-at-work/amazon-plans-thousands-more-corporate-job-cuts-next-week-sources-say-2026-01-22/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Reuters</a></em>, in an effort to trim its workforce by approximately 30,000 employees.</p>
<p>This is considered the next round of layoffs that first occurred in October, two sources who asked not to be identified told <em>Reuters</em>. During the October round of layoffs, 14,000 employees were laid off. The second round, which can begin as early as Tuesday, is expected to affect roughly the same number of employees.</p>
<p>Included in the layoffs are jobs within the company’s Amazon Web Services, retail, Prime Video, and People Experience and Technology departments.</p>
<p><em>MyNorthwest</em> has reached out to Amazon for comment.</p>

<h2>Layoffs are piling up for Amazon</h2>
<p>In October, Amazon cut approximately 14,000 corporate jobs, close to 4% of its workforce, as the online retail giant ramps up spending on AI while trimming costs elsewhere. According to a letter to employees from Beth Galetti, the senior vice president of People Experience and Technology at Amazon, those laid off would be given 90 days to look for a new position internally.</p>
<p>Amazon has about 350,000 corporate employees and a total workforce of approximately 1.56 million.</p>
<p>In June, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy, who has aggressively sought to cut costs since becoming CEO in 2021, said he anticipated that <span>generative AI</span> would reduce Amazon’s corporate workforce over the next few years.</p>
                    
                
<p>Amazon is <span>investing</span> $10 billion toward building a campus in North Carolina to expand its cloud computing and artificial intelligence infrastructure. Since 2024 began, Amazon has committed to about $10 billion apiece to data center projects in <span>Mississippi</span>,&nbsp;<span>Indiana</span>,&nbsp;<span>Ohio,</span>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<span>North Carolina</span>&nbsp;as it builds up its infrastructure to try to keep up with other tech giants making leaps in AI.</p>
<p>The 14,000 jobs cut in October were the biggest wave of layoffs since 2023, when the company cut 27,000 jobs over a two-month period.</p>
<p>Amazon’s workforce doubled during the pandemic as millions stayed home and boosted online spending. In the following years, big tech and retail companies cut thousands of jobs to bring spending back in line.</p>
<h3>US applications for jobless benefits inch up last week to a still-low 200,000</h3>
<p>The number of Americans who applied for unemployment benefits inched up last week, but U.S. layoffs remain historically low despite signs of a softening labor market.</p>
<p>U.S. filings for jobless aid for the week ending Jan. 17 rose by 1,000 to 200,000, up from 199,000 the previous week, the Labor Department reported Thursday. That’s fewer than the 207,000 new applications that analysts surveyed by the data firm FactSet were expecting.</p>
<p>Applications for unemployment benefits are viewed as a proxy for layoffs and are close to a real-time indicator of the health of the job market.</p>
<p>Employers&nbsp;<span>added just 50,000 jobs last month</span>, nearly unchanged from a downwardly revised figure of 56,000 in November, the Labor Department&nbsp;<span>said</span>. The unemployment rate slipped to 4.4%, its first decline since June, from 4.5% in November, a figure also revised lower.</p>

The request underscores how tools originally developed for digital advertising and other commercial purposes are increasingly <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/fbi-purchase-location-data-wray-senate/">being considered</a> for use by the government for law enforcement and surveillance.</p><p>In an unsigned statement emailed to WIRED, ICE stressed that the filing was solely for information and planning purposes. “Law enforcement across the nation leverages technological innovation to fight crime. ICE is no different,” the statement reads. ICE said it uses technology to support investigations and to aid in the arrest of criminals, “all while respecting civil liberties and privacy interests.”</p><p>The Department of Homeland Security did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p><p>ICE has previously used the term “big data” in a contract justification for Palantir to provide “unlimited operations and maintenance support of the FALCON system” and unlimited licenses for “Palantir Gotham.” Gotham is Palantir’s off-the-shelf investigative tool for law enforcement. The company provides a custom version of Gotham to ICE known as the “Investigative Case Management” system. FALCON is a tool within the customized Palantir system that <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/privacy-pia-ice032b-falconsa-appendixbupdate-march2021.pdf">ICE uses</a> to "store, search, analyze, and visualize volumes of existing information" about current and former investigations.</p><p>ICE has also previously purchased products that provide mobile location data, which is sometimes among the information provided by companies that buy and sell information collected for online advertising.

          <p>Researchers on Friday said that Poland’s electric grid was targeted by wiper malware, likely unleashed by Russia state hackers, in an attempt to disrupt electricity delivery operations.</p>
<p>A cyberattack, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/climate-energy/massive-cyberattack-polish-power-system-december-failed-minister-says-2026-01-13/">Reuters reported</a>, occurred during the last week of December. The news organization said it was aimed at disrupting communications between renewable installations and the power distribution operators but failed for reasons not explained.</p>
<h2>Wipers R Us</h2>
<p>On Friday, security firm ESET <a href="https://www.welivesecurity.com/en/eset-research/eset-research-sandworm-cyberattack-poland-power-grid-late-2025/">said</a> the malware responsible was a wiper, a type of malware that permanently erases code and data stored on servers with the goal of destroying operations completely. After studying the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used in the attack, company researchers said the wiper was likely the work of a Russian government hacker group tracked under the name Sandworm.</p>
<p>“Based on our analysis of the malware and associated TTPs, we attribute the attack to the Russia-aligned Sandworm APT with medium confidence due to a strong overlap with numerous previous Sandworm wiper activity we analyzed,” said ESET researchers. “We’re not aware of any successful disruption occurring as a result of this attack.”</p>
<p>Sandworm has a long history of destructive attacks waged on behalf of the Kremlin and aimed at adversaries. Most notable was one in Ukraine in <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2016/01/first-known-hacker-caused-power-outage-signals-troubling-escalation/">December 2015</a>. It left roughly  230,000 people without electricity for about six hours during one of the coldest months of the year. The hackers used general purpose malware known as BlackEnergy to penetrate power companies’ supervisory control and data acquisition systems and, from there, activate legitimate functionality to stop electricity distribution. The incident was the first known malware-facilitated blackout.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://micahcantor.com/blog/bluesky-comment-section.html">https://micahcantor.com/blog/bluesky-comment-section.html</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46747366">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><div><p><span>Published on <time datetime="Sat Jan 24 2026">January 24, 2026</time></span></p></div><p>You can now view replies to this blog post made on Bluesky directly on this website. <a href="https://micahcantor.com/blog/bluesky-comment-section#comments">Check it out here</a>!</p>
<p>I've always wanted to host a comment section on my site, but it's difficult because the content is statically generated and hosted on a CDN.
I could host comments on a separate VPS or cloud service.
But maintaining a dynamic web service like this can be expensive and time-consuming — in general, I'm not interested in being an unpaid, part-time DevOps engineer.</p>
<p>Recently, however, I read a blog post by <a href="https://www.coryzue.com/writing/bluesky-comments/">Cory Zue</a> about how he embedded a comment section from Bluesky on his blog.
I immediately understood to benefits of this approach. With this approach, Bluesky could handle all of the difficult work involved in managing a social media like account verification, hosting, storage, spam, and moderation. Meanwhile because Bluesky is an open platform with a public API, it's easy to directly embed comments on my own site.</p>
<p>There are other services that could be used for this purpose instead. Notably, I could embed replies from the social media formerly known as Twitter. Or I could use a platform like <a href="https://disqus.com/">Disqus</a> or even <a href="https://giscus.app/">giscus</a>, which hosts comments on GitHub Discussions. But I see Bluesky as a clearly superior choice among these options. For one, Bluesky is built on top of an open social media platform in AT Proto, meaning it can't easily be taken over by an authoritarian billionaire creep. Moreover, Bluesky is a full-fledged social media platform, which naturally makes it a better option for hosting a conversation than GitHub.</p>
<p>Zue published a standalone package called <a href="https://github.com/czue/bluesky-comments">bluesky-comments</a> that allows embedding comments in a React component as he did.
But I decided to build this feature myself instead. Mainly this is because I wanted to make a few styling changes anyway to match the rest of my site. But I also wanted to leave the option open to adding more features in the future, which would be easier to do if I wrote the code myself. The entire implementation is small regardless, amounting to only ~200 LOC between the UI components and API functions.</p>
<p>Initially, I planned to allow people to directly post on Bluesky via my site. This would work by providing an OAuth flow that gives my site permission to post on Bluesky on behalf of the user. I actually did get the auth flow working, but building out a UI for posting and replying to existing comments is difficult to do well. Going down this path quickly leads to building what is essentially a custom Bluesky client, which I didn't have the time or interest in doing right now. Moreover, because the user needs to go through the auth flow and sign-in to their Bluesky account, the process is not really much easier than posting directly on a linked Bluesky post.</p>
<p>Without the requirement of allowing others to directly post on my site, the implementation became much simpler. Essentially, my task was to specify a Bluesky post that corresponds to the article in the site's metadata. Then, when the page loads I fetch the replies to that post from Bluesky, parse the response, and display the results in a simple comment section UI.</p>
<p>As explained in <a href="https://micahcantor.com/blog/rsc-rewrite">my last post</a>, this site is built using React Server Components and Parcel. The content of my articles are written using MDX, an extension to Markdown that allows directly embedding JavaScript and JSX. In each post, I export a <code>metadata</code> object that I validate using a <a href="https://zod.dev/">Zod</a> schema. For instance, the metadata for this post looks like this:</p>
<div data-bright-theme="github-dark"><pre><code><p><span><span>export const </span><span>metadata </span><span>=</span><span> {</span><br></span></p><p><span><span>	title: </span><span>"I added a Bluesky comment section to my blog"</span><span>,</span><br></span></p><p><span><span>	description:</span><br></span></p><p><span><span>		"How I embedded Bluesky replies directly on my site"</span><span>,</span><br></span></p><p><span><span>	date: </span><span>"2026-01-24"</span><span>,</span><br></span></p><p><span><span>	bskyPostId: &lt;</span><span>post</span><span>-</span><span>id</span><span>&gt;,</span><br></span></p><p><span><span>	tags: [</span><span>"web-dev"</span><span>],</span><br></span></p><p><span><span>};</span><br></span></p></code></pre></div>
<p>The value of <code>bskyPostId</code> references the Bluesky post from which I'll pull replies to display in the comment section. Because my project is built in TypeScript, it was easy to integrate with the Bluesky TypeScript SDK (<code>@bluesky/api</code> on NPM). Reading the Bluesky API documentation and Zue's implementation led me to the <a href="https://docs.bsky.app/docs/api/app-bsky-feed-get-post-thread"><code>getPostThread</code> endpoint</a>. Given an AT Protocol URI, this endpoint returns an object with data on the given post and its replies.</p>
<p>I could have interacted directly with the Bluesky API from my React component using <code>fetch</code> and <code>useEffect</code>. However, it can be a bit tricky to correctly handle loading and a error states, even for a simple feature like this. Because of this, I decided to use the <a href="https://tanstack.com/query/latest">Tanstack <code>react-query</code> package</a> to manage the API request/response cycle. This library takes care of the messy work of handling errors, retries, and loading states while I simply provide it a function to fetch the post data.</p>
<p>Once I obtain the Bluesky response, the next task is parsing out the content and metadata for the replies. Bluesky supports a rich content structure in its posts for representing markup, references, and attachments. Building out a UI that fully respects this rich content would be difficult. Instead, I decided to keep it simple by just pulling out the text content from each reply.</p>
<p>Even so, building a UI that properly displays threaded comments, particularly one that is formatted well on small mobile devices, can be tricky. For now, my approach was to again keep it simple. I indented each reply and added a left border to make it easier to follow reply threads. Otherwise, I mostly copied design elements for layout of the profile picture and post date from Bluesky.</p>
<p>Lastly, I added a UI component linking to the parent post on Bluesky, and encouraging people to add to the conversation there. With this, the read-only comment section implementation was complete. If there's interest, I could publish my version of Bluesky comments as a standalone package. But several of the choices I made were relatively specific to my own site. Moreover, the implementation is simple enough that others could probably build their own version from reading the source code, just as I did using Zue's version.</p>
<p>Let me know what you think by replying on Bluesky. Hopefully this can help increase engagement with my blog posts, but then again, my last article generated no replies, so maybe not 😭.</p></article></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>On March 14, 2025, Albedo's first satellite, Clarity-1, launched on SpaceX Transporter-13. We took a big swing with our pathfinder. The mission goals:</p><ol role="list"><li>Prove sustainable orbit operations in VLEO — an orbital regime long considered too harsh for commercial satellites — by overcoming thick atmospheric drag, dangerous atomic oxygen, and extreme speeds.</li><li>Prove our mid-size, high-performance Precision bus — designed and built in-house in just over two years.</li><li>Capture 10 cm resolution visible imagery and 2-meter thermal infrared imagery, a feat previously achieved only by exquisite, billion dollar government systems.</li></ol><p>We proved a ton. We learned a ton.</p><p>We achieved the first two goals definitively and validated 98% of the technology required for the third. This was an extraordinarily ambitious first satellite. We designed and built a high-performance bus on time and on budget, integrated a large-aperture telescope, and operated in an environment no commercial company had sustained operations in, funded entirely by private capital.</p><p>This is the full story.</p><h2>VLEO&nbsp;Works</h2><p>Let's start with the result that matters most: VLEO works. And it works better than even we expected.</p><p>For decades, Very Low Earth Orbit was written off as impractical for normal satellite lifetimes. The atmosphere is thicker, creating drag that would deorbit normal satellites in weeks. If the drag didn't kill you, atomic oxygen would erode your solar arrays and surfaces. To succeed in VLEO required a fundamentally different satellite design.</p><p>Clarity-1 proved that our design works.</p><p>The drag coefficient was the headline: 12% better than our design target. Measured multiple times at altitudes between 350 km - 380 km with a repeatable result, this validates our models producing a satellite lifespan of five years at 275 km altitude, averaged across the solar cycle. This was one of our most critical assumptions, and we exceeded it.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64529e978a785fb5da715f99/6972cd62d217972df64eb5d7_SMA_decay.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>Atomic oxygen (AO) is the silent killer in VLEO. The deeper you go, the more AO you encounter. It degrades solar arrays and other traditional satellite materials. We developed a new class of solar arrays with unique measures designed to mitigate AO degradation. They work. Even as we descended deeper into VLEO and AO fluence increased logarithmically, our power generation stayed constant.

Momentum management worked. Fault detection worked. Our thrust planning model was validated against GOCE data (a 2009 VLEO R&amp;D mission) with sub-meter accuracy. Radiation tolerance was excellent, with 4x fewer single-event upsets than expected. Orbit determination was dialed.</p><p>We proved sustainable VLEO operations.</p><h2>The Precision Bus is Flight-Proven</h2><p>Developed and built in just over two years, our in-house bus Precision is now TRL-9: flight-proven on-orbit.</p><p>Every bus subsystem worked. Every piece of in-house technology we developed performed: our CMG steering law, our operational modes, flight and ground software, electronics boards, and our novel thermal management system. &nbsp;We hit our embedded software GNC timing deadlines, we converged our attitude and orbit determination estimators, we saw 4π steradian command and telemetry antenna coverage, and we got on-orbit actuals for our power generation and loads.</p><p>Our cloud-native ground system was incredible. Contact planning across 25 ground stations was completely automated. Mission scheduling updated every 15 minutes to incorporate new tasking and the latest satellite state information, smoothly transitioning to updated on-board command loads with visual tracking of each schedule and its status. Automated thrust planning to achieve our desired orbital trajectory supported 30+ maneuvers per day. Our engineers could track and command the satellite from anywhere with internet and a secure VPN.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64529e978a785fb5da715f99/697273b8eb660f4e53c80067_telemetry.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>We pushed 14 successful flight software feature updates on-orbit — and even executed one FPGA update, which is exceptionally rare. The ability to continuously improve throughout Clarity's operational life proved essential — every major solution to challenges we faced involved flight software updates. On-orbit software upgrades are exceedingly tricky to get right, but Clarity-1 was designed from day one around this foundational capability.</p><h2>Four Weeks of Perfection</h2><p>The first month of the mission was magic.</p><p>An hour after launch, we watched Clarity-1 deploy from the premium caketopper slot into LEO, giving us an incredible view of the Nile River as she separated from the rocket.</p><p><video autoplay="" loop="" muted="" playsinline="" controls="" poster="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/644969eaf2de3f8071a22936%2F6972746b06c6a94b1c39ab16_Nile_poster.0000000.jpg">

  <p>Clarity-1 accurately pointing at a ground station using GroundTrack mode; visualization is driven using real telemetry</p></div><p>We moved on to commissioning our X-band radio — the high-rate link to downlink imagery.

  <p>Clarity-1 intentionally spinning to provide two-axis stabilization</p></div><p>We had a choice. Hack together novel 3-CMG control algorithms as fast as possible and risk losing another, or figure out how to leverage only the torque rods to achieve 3-axis control with sufficient accuracy to navigate the maneuver to VLEO.</p><p>We went with the torque rods.</p><p>On satellites this size (~600 kg), magnetic torque rods are typically used for momentum dumping, not attitude control. But we'd built Clarity with unusually beefy torque rods due to the elevated momentum management needs in VLEO. Our GNC team went heads down and developed algorithms to achieve 3-axis attitude control using only torque rods.</p><p>Within a month, we had it working.</p><p>Both of our electric thrusters commissioned quickly and were working well. But with torque rods only, our attitude control had 15 to 20 degrees of error, sometimes reaching ~45 degrees. And maneuvering to VLEO isn’t “point into the wind and fire” — it’s continuous vector and trajectory management across an orbit. That kind of control error meant inefficient burns and a much harder descent plan.</p><p>As the descent progressed, however, the team learned and iterated. With more iteration and flight software updates, we uploaded onboard logic informed by several sources of live data that dialed in our thrust vector control to within 5 degrees of the target. The autonomous thrust planning system we built enabled us to claw back performance that nearly matched our originally projected descent speed.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64529e978a785fb5da715f99/6972911dee3d33aee5e709f9_Maneuver.jpg" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>We maneuvered safely past the ISS and entered VLEO. Eager to pop off the contamination cover.</p><h2>Lens Cap Jettison</h2><p>Once we reached safe altitude, it was time to jettison the contamination cover protecting our telescope.</p><p>There are horror stories about contamination covers getting stuck after months of temperature fluctuations.</p><p>Clarity's was flawless. I'll never forget seeing this blip in telemetry live — confirming through Newton's third law that the jettison was successful. Shortly after, LeoLabs confirmed tracking of two separate objects.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64529e978a785fb5da715f99/6972923e0be3fc8908dad991_lens_cap_telem.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>We were ready to start imaging.</p><h2>The Imaging Journey</h2><p>Here's where it got complicated.</p><p>Our GNC and FSW teams were close but not yet finished with the new 3-CMG control law. CMGs are rarely used in commercial space, let alone by a startup. Then take one more step: singularity-prone 3-CMG control that to our knowledge has not been attempted on a non-exquisite satellite, and certainly not developed and uploaded on-orbit. Traditional algorithms require at least four CMGs to provide capability volumes free of singularities.</p><p>We were eager to make some amount of progress, so we started imaging on torque rods even though there would be severe limitations: 50+ pixels of smear, large mispointing from the wobble of torque rod control due to earth's magnetic field, and downlink limited to at best two small images per day. The last two constraints meant we were at risk of spending precious downlink capacity on clouds.</p><p>Sure enough, the first two days of pixels were mostly clouds, but we were happy to peek through a little in this image.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64529e978a785fb5da715f99/6972960c7d7b8c2ee02bf92b_10_NUC_vnir_display_rgb_DRA.jpg" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>Although we couldn't <em>control</em> attitude accurately, we did still have good attitude <em>knowledge</em> after the fact. AyJay whipped up a clever idea with Claude Code that automated posting weather conditions in Slack for each collection. We analyzed that to determine which images were likely clear, and selected those for downlink.</p><p>Boom:</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64529e978a785fb5da715f99/6972962d6958ae64916753ad_8_NUC_vnir_display_rgb_DRA%20(3).jpg" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>We adjusted the focus position a few times, and images continued getting better.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64529e978a785fb5da715f99/69729665649a3c5b3f7d34d7_11_TR%20horizontal.jpg" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>Then, 3-CMG control was ready.</p><p>Out of the box, the new algorithms and software performed perfectly.</p><p>This visualization shows real telemetry of Clarity performing seven back-to-back imaging maneuvers, with limited 3-CMG agility, followed by an X-band downlink over Iceland minutes later. The satellite was executing sophisticated attitude profiles with very low control error.

A straightforward fix for the future — an unfortunate corner case to learn about in hindsight.</p><p>The second CMG showing issues was also on the hot side of the satellite. While we had overhauled the vehicle and CMG operations to prevent additional bearing wear, the damage had already been done in the first month of the mission.</p><p>We spent months trying everything we could to get the CMGs to operate sustainably. The team attempted many clever solutions, one of which revived the first CMG that had locked up. We uploaded a feature to select any 3 of the 4 CMGs for operator commanding. But we weren't able to get sustained, reliable operation.</p><p>Despite the CMG challenges, here's what the imaging journey proved.</p><p><strong>The full end-to-end image chain works.</strong> Photons hit our optics, get captured by our sensor, processed through payload electronics, packetized and encrypted, transmitted via our X-band radio, received on the ground, and processed into image products. The entire chain is validated.</p><p><strong>The end-to-end loop is fast.</strong> Within 30 seconds of a downlink, processed image snippets were already posting to our company Slack.</p><p><strong>Sensor performance exceeded expectations.</strong> Dynamic range, radiometry, color balance, band-to-band alignment — all look great, even on uncalibrated imagery.</p><p><strong>We can scan out long images.</strong> Our line-scanning approach produced strips 20-30 kilometers long, exactly as designed.</p><p><strong>Pointing accuracy and high quality telemetry validates the ingredients for precise geolocation.</strong> The data we need to pinpoint where each pixel lands on Earth to &lt;5m (closed-loop CE90) is there.</p><p><strong>Jitter and smear are low.</strong> Fiber-optic gyro measurements confirmed 3x lower smear and 11x lower jitter compared to our goal — a critical ingredient for exquisite imagery.</p><p><strong>Our proprietary image scheduler works.</strong> The automated system that plans collections, manages constraints, and optimizes what we capture each day performed as designed.</p><h2>Where Clarity Is Now</h2><p>Nine months into the mission, we lost contact with Clarity-1.</p><p>By that point, we had largely exhausted our options on the CMGs. The path to further image quality improvement had effectively closed.</p><p>We had been tracking intermittent memory issues in our TT&amp;C radio throughout the mission, working around them as they appeared. Our best theory is that one of these issues escalated in a way that corrupted onboard memory and is preventing reboots. We've tried several recovery approaches. So far, none have worked, and the likelihood of recovery looks low at this point.</p><p>But here's what matters: the VLEO validation data we collected is sufficient.</p><p>We combined a state-of-the-art atmospheric density model, our high-fidelity orbital dynamics force models, and months of natural orbit decay data from 350 to 380 km altitude to determine Clarity’s coefficient of drag — with repeatable results at different altitudes. That drag coefficient, paired with our demonstrated ability to maintain altitude in VLEO for months using high-efficiency thrusters, tells us exactly how the vehicle behaves under aerodynamic drag across the VLEO regime — and validates an average five-year lifespan at 275 km across the solar cycle. Telemetry from our solar arrays, together with onboard atomic oxygen sensor data, shows peak power generation stayed constant after exposure to VLEO levels of AO fluence — proving our AO mitigation worked.</p><p>Thanks to our friends at LeoLabs, we've validated that Clarity is maintaining attitude autonomously. She's still up there, still oriented, still descending through VLEO. Just not talking to us.</p><p>Even before this, we had started developing an in-house TT&amp;C radio for our systems moving forward, rather than reusing this radio that was procured from a third party. We’ll incorporate learnings from this reliability issue into that.</p><p>We're still working the problem. This chapter isn't over yet. But even if it is, Clarity-1 gave us what we needed to build what comes next.</p><h2>98% of The 10 cm Imagery Pyramid</h2><p>If you think about exquisite imagery as a pyramid, we needed 100% of the systems working together to achieve the pinnacle: 10 cm visible imagery. We got to about 98%. Everything else in that pyramid — the entire foundation — is proven and retired.</p><p>Our drag coefficient. Our atomic oxygen resilience. Our solar arrays. Our thermal management. Our flight software. Our ground software. Our CMG steering laws. Our precision pointing algorithms. Our payload electronics. Our sensor performance. Our image processing chain. Our ability to operate sustainably in VLEO. Our team.</p><p>All validated.</p><p>We know exactly what to fix. It’s straight forward: operate the CMGs at lower temperature. The system thermal design is already updated in the next build to maximize CMG life going forward.</p><p>Beyond the CMGs, there were a handful of learnings on the margins. We learned our secondary mirror structure could be stiffer — already in the updated design. We learned we could use more heater capacity in some payload zones — already fixed.</p><p>We learned from the things that worked, too. We're well down the development path for next-gen flight software, avionics, and power distribution. Orbit determination and geolocation will be even better. Additional surface treatments will improve drag coefficient further. Power-generation will increase while maintaining the proven atomic oxygen resilience. The list goes on.</p><p>The path to exquisite imagery is clear. And that’s only one of many exciting capabilities unlocked by sustainable operations in VLEO.</p><h2>What’s Next</h2><p>Our next VLEO mission will incorporate these learnings and demonstrate new features that enable missions beyond imaging — we’ll share more details soon. In parallel, imaging remains a core focus: we’re continuing to build optical payloads for EO/IR missions as part of a broader VLEO roadmap.</p><p>The successes of Clarity-1 reinforced our core conviction: VLEO isn’t just a better orbit for imaging — it’s the next productive orbital layer.</p><p>The physics are unforgiving, but that’s exactly why it matters. Go lower and you unlock a step-change in performance: sharper sensing, faster links, lower latency, and a new level of responsiveness. The reason VLEO has been written off for decades isn’t lack of upside — it’s that most satellites simply can’t survive there long enough to matter.</p><p>Now we know they can.</p><p>Clarity proved the hard parts: sustainable VLEO operations, validated drag and lifetime models, atomic oxygen resilience, and a flight-proven high-performance bus. We’re not speculating about VLEO. We’re operating in it, learning in it, and capitalized to scale it.</p><p>Onward,</p><p>Topher &amp; Team Albedo</p><p>‍</p><p>‍</p></div></div>]]></description>

<p>A week or two ago I was surprised to see a Google Gemini summary at the top of my email on my phone. A day or two later this appeared in my web client as well. Look, I love our new overlords (for the record m'lords I nearly always use "please" and "thank you"). I was an early adopter and introduced many of you to the LLMs. I still am a frequent user... I mean someone who has all the answers and blows smoke up my ass... perfect right!</p>
<p>Despite that, it appears it's not good for me ( <a href="https://www.media.mit.edu/publications/your-brain-on-chatgpt/">https://www.media.mit.edu/publications/your-brain-on-chatgpt/</a> ). It's great, it's easy, makes me feel good in the moment... of course it's bad for me!</p>
<p>Here's the thing. I like to read things from my friends that they have taken the time to write. I personally hate texting. All the nuance is gone. Often the humor. Sad. Makes me want to have a beer with you... eye contact... blech. The <strong>LAST</strong> thing I want is a summary... at the top of the email... highlighted... that I <strong>CANNOT</strong> turn off.</p>
<p>I tried to turn it off. I can. It's under <code>Gmail -&gt; Settings -&gt; General -&gt; Smart Features (checkbox)</code>. <strong>BUT</strong>... the AI summaries is now grouped with the Smart Tabs.</p>
<p>For those of you who do not use Gmail (or do use Gmail and don't use Smart Tabs), Smart Tabs (officially the Tabbed Inbox) have been part of Gmail since 2013; well actually the technology behind them—Smart Labels—actually debuted two years earlier. (Thank you Gemini, yes I <strong>DO</strong> truly love you. Tell me again about the comparisons of Stephen Miller and Heinrich Himmler's tactics please?)</p>
<p>Smart Tabs automatically sort my incoming flood of solicited commercial email (<strong>cue</strong> laughter from those who know my first start-up) into five buckets:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Primary:</strong> Email from you.</li>
<li><strong>Promotions:</strong> K&amp;L Wine Merchants at the top of the list.</li>
<li><strong>Social:</strong> Hi Andrew on Facebook (that I only log into from Firefox running on a VM).</li>
<li><strong>Update:</strong> Actual transactional emails from companies.</li>
<li><strong>Forums:</strong> <em>The Information</em> at the top of the list (a newsletter I'd like to read but don't want to make the time justify paying for the content).</li>
</ul>
<p>I tried turning off Smart Features and oh my, that's not usable. So I lived with the AI summary at the top. For a week. Then this morning, I saw several messages in my Primary tab that normally get sorted into Promotions, Social, Updates or Forums. This is not unheard of; sometimes a company uses a new incoming address or something and stuff gets put in the wrong bucket.</p>
<p>But <strong>THIS</strong> time, I got a popup that says I must "Share" this message with Google and links to the Privacy Policy and Google Terms of Service. And an explicit sentence:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Messages and attachments might be reviewed by humans, so don't share any sensitive or confidential information."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm not naive. I'm an early adopter, my email address includes my name and no numbers. I was a direct marketer when we still were the red-headed step-children of the product managers.  I carpooled to Symantec with Google employee no 11's girlfriend (Go Beavers!) From the get-go, having Google read my email in order to provide targeted advertising was part of the deal. I was fine with that.</p>
<p><strong>BUT</strong>... now... what they are saying is that... we are going to use your email to train our LLMs. I'm not okay with that. That knowledge of my way of writing, my personal details, my confidential commercial information is <strong>NOT</strong> okay to use to train your models. 'Cause I expect mistakes will be made and more information will reside in the model than those at Google (or FB, MSFT etc) intended. And I'm not really up for assuming that risk.</p>
<p>So... goodbye Gmail. It's been great. Really great. I'm sure I'll miss you. Bye.</p>
<p>My email is now being hosted by Microsoft, so hopefully will be free of the outages and limits some of you have experienced with that email in the past. There it will reside until I cannot turn off MSFT's ability to read my email. Then I guess it's off to Switzerland ( <a href="https://proton.me/about">https://proton.me/about</a> ); my email can be with my gold. JK..NR</p>
<p>Tom</p>
<p>p.s.  why thank you Gemini for reformatting that for me into a clean, engaging markdown blog post.  Yes, I do agree this is a sharp, timely take on the "AI-ification" of tools we use every day. I love you.  Kill me last?</p>

BirdyChat is now the first chat app in Europe that can exchange messages with WhatsApp under the Digital Markets Act. This brings us closer to our mission of giving work conversations a proper home.</p><p data-styles-preset="jO2jdoJ2Q">WhatsApp is currently rolling out interoperability support across Europe. As this rollout continues, the feature will become fully available to both BirdyChat and WhatsApp users in the coming months.</p></div></div><div><p data-framer-name="Headline" data-framer-component-type="RichTextContainer"><h2 data-styles-preset="jiI1H0bu7">Why this matters</h2></p><p data-styles-preset="jO2jdoJ2Q">Until now, you could only message people who already had a BirdyChat account. If someone was not on the app, they had to download it before you could talk. It slowed down adoption and made it harder to move real work conversations into BirdyChat.</p><div><p data-styles-preset="jO2jdoJ2Q">With the new WhatsApp interface mandated by the DMA, any BirdyChat user in the EEA will be able to start a chat with any WhatsApp user in the region simply by knowing their phone number. Your contacts keep using WhatsApp. You stay on BirdyChat. Messages flow both ways.</p></div><p data-styles-preset="jO2jdoJ2Q">This removes a big barrier to adopting BirdyChat for work. You no longer need to ask people to switch apps. You can keep work neatly organised in BirdyChat while staying connected to everyone who still relies on WhatsApp.</p></div><div><p data-framer-name="Headline" data-framer-component-type="RichTextContainer"><h2 data-styles-preset="jiI1H0bu7">What interoperability lets you&nbsp;do</h2></p><div data-framer-name="Text" data-framer-component-type="RichTextContainer"><p data-styles-preset="jO2jdoJ2Q">Interoperability lets you:</p><ul data-styles-preset="jO2jdoJ2Q"><li><p>Start 1:1 chats with WhatsApp users using their phone number</p></li><li><p>Send messages, photos and files</p></li><li><p>Communicate over an encrypted connection</p></li><li><p>Use your work email as your identity instead of a personal phone number</p></li></ul><p data-styles-preset="jO2jdoJ2Q">This makes it much easier to keep work and personal life separate while staying fully reachable.</p></div></div><div><p data-framer-name="Headline" data-framer-component-type="RichTextContainer"><h2 data-styles-preset="jiI1H0bu7">How the integration works</h2></p><p data-styles-preset="jO2jdoJ2Q">WhatsApp introduced Third-Party Chats in Europe earlier this year. BirdyChat connects through this official DMA interface and does not use any workarounds. All communication between BirdyChat and WhatsApp users is end-to-end encrypted.</p><p data-styles-preset="jO2jdoJ2Q">Currently, BirdyChat supports 1:1 chats, with group chat interoperability coming in a future update.</p></div><div><p data-framer-name="Headline" data-framer-component-type="RichTextContainer"><h2 data-styles-preset="jiI1H0bu7">Availability</h2></p><p data-styles-preset="jO2jdoJ2Q">This feature will roll out gradually to BirdyChat users across the European Economic Area. For interoperability to work, both you and your WhatsApp contacts need to be based in the EEA. Since WhatsApp is releasing interoperability as part of a gradual rollout, availability may differ slightly from country to country.</p></div></div><div><p data-framer-name="Headline" data-framer-component-type="RichTextContainer"><h2 data-styles-preset="jiI1H0bu7">Get early access</h2></p><p data-styles-preset="jO2jdoJ2Q">BirdyChat is invite-only while we scale access.

<h2>Hardware Changes Through Each Generation</h2>
<h3>Raspberry Pi 1</h3>
<p>This is the original Raspberry Pi, which was launched in February 2012.</p>
<figure><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" width="1024" height="569" src="https://www.the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Raspberry-Pi-1-1024x569.jpeg" alt="Raspberry Pi 1" srcset="https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Raspberry-Pi-1-1024x569.jpeg 1024w, https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Raspberry-Pi-1-300x167.jpeg 300w, https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Raspberry-Pi-1-768x427.jpeg 768w, https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Raspberry-Pi-1-1536x854.jpeg 1536w, https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Raspberry-Pi-1-2048x1139.jpeg 2048w, https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Raspberry-Pi-1-150x83.jpeg 150w, https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Raspberry-Pi-1-696x387.jpeg 696w, https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Raspberry-Pi-1-1068x594.jpeg 1068w, https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Raspberry-Pi-1-1920x1068.jpeg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>
<p>This Pi has a Broadcom BCM2835 SOC which features a single ARM1176JZF-S core running at 700MHz along with a VideoCore IV GPU. It has 512 MB of DDR RAM.</p><p>In terms of connectivity, it only has 100Mb networking and 2 x USB 2.0 ports. Video output is 1080P through a full-size HDMI port or analogue video out through a composite video connector and audio output is provided through a 3.5mm audio jack. It doesn’t have any WiFi or Bluetooth connectivity but it does have some of the features that we still have on more recent models like DSI and CSI ports, a full size SD card reader for the operating system and GPIO pins, although only 26 of them at this stage.</p>

<p>Power is supplied through a micro USB port and it is rated for 5V and 700mA.</p>
<p>It was priced at $35 – which at the time was incredibly cheap for what was essentially a palm-sized computer.</p><h3>Raspberry Pi 2</h3>
<p>The Raspberry Pi 2 was launched 3 years later, in February 2015 and this Pi looked quite different to the original and similar to the Pi’s we know today.</p>

<p>The Pi 2 has a significantly better processor than the original. The Broadcom BCM2836 SOC has 4 Cortex-A7 cores running at 900 MHz and it retained the same VideoCore IV GPU. RAM was also bumped up to 1GB.</p>
<p>It added another 2 x USB 2.0 ports alongside the 100Mb Ethernet port. The composite video port disappeared and the analogue video output was moved into the audio jack.</p><p>The GPIO pins were increased to 40 pins which has followed the same pin layout since – which has really helped in maintaining compatibility with hats and accessories. The SD card reader was also changed to a microSD card reader.</p>

<p>The power circuitry was bumped up to 800mA to accommodate the more powerful CPU.</p>
<h3>Raspberry Pi 3</h3>
<p>The Raspberry Pi 3 was launched just a year later, in February 2016.</p><figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="569" src="https://www.the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Raspberry-Pi-3-1024x569.jpeg" alt="Raspberry Pi 3" srcset="https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Raspberry-Pi-3-1024x569.jpeg 1024w, https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Raspberry-Pi-3-300x167.jpeg 300w, https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Raspberry-Pi-3-768x427.jpeg 768w, https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Raspberry-Pi-3-1536x854.jpeg 1536w, https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Raspberry-Pi-3-2048x1139.jpeg 2048w, https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Raspberry-Pi-3-150x83.jpeg 150w, https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Raspberry-Pi-3-696x387.jpeg 696w, https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Raspberry-Pi-3-1068x594.jpeg 1068w, https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Raspberry-Pi-3-1920x1068.jpeg 1920w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>
<p>The Pi 3’s new Broadcom BCM2837 SOC retained the same 4-core architecture but these were changed to 64-bit Cortex A53 cores running at 1.2Ghz.</p>
<p>RAM was kept at 1GB but was now DDR2.</p>
<p>There was no change to the USB or Ethernet connectivity on the original Pi 3 but we did see WiFi and Bluetooth added for the first time. WiFi was single band 2.4GHz and we had Bluetooth 4.1.</p>
<p>The version that I have is actually the 3B+, which was launched a little later. The main improvements over the original Pi 3 were a 0.2GHz boost to the clock speed and the upgrade to Gigabit networking with PoE (Power over Ethernet) support and dual-band WiFi.</p><p>The power circuitry was again improved, still running at 5V but now up to 1.34A, which was almost double the Pi 2.</p>
<h3>Raspberry Pi 4</h3>
<p>Next came the Pi 4 in June 2019. This Pi came at one of the worst times for global manufacturing and was notoriously difficult to get hold of due to the impact of COVID on the global supply chain. Quite ironically, this hard-to-get Pi is the one that I’ve got the most of, mainly due to my <a href="https://www.the-diy-life.com/building-a-water-cooled-raspberry-pi-4-cluster/">water-cooled Pi cluster build</a>.</p>
<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="572" src="https://www.the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Raspberry-Pi-4-1024x572.jpeg" alt="Raspberry Pi 4" srcset="https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Raspberry-Pi-4-1024x572.jpeg 1024w, https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Raspberry-Pi-4-300x168.jpeg 300w, https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Raspberry-Pi-4-768x429.jpeg 768w, https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Raspberry-Pi-4-1536x858.jpeg 1536w, https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Raspberry-Pi-4-2048x1144.jpeg 2048w, https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Raspberry-Pi-4-150x84.jpeg 150w, https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Raspberry-Pi-4-696x389.jpeg 696w, https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Raspberry-Pi-4-1068x596.jpeg 1068w, https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Raspberry-Pi-4-1920x1072.jpeg 1920w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>
<p>The Pi 4 has a Broadcom BCM2711 SOC with 4 Cortex-A72 cores running at 1.5GHz. So again a slight clock speed increase over the Pi 3 but still retaining 4 cores. It also includes a bump up to a VideoCore VI GPU.</p><p>This was the first model to feature different RAM configurations. It was originally available in 1, 2, 4GB variants featuring LPDDR4 RAM and in March of 2020 an 8GB variant was added to the linup as well. This obviously resulted in a few different price points but impressively they still managed to keep a $35 offering 7 years after the launch of the first Pi.</p>
<p>It retained the same form factor as the Pi 3 but with the network and Ethernet ports switched around. Notably, two of the USB ports were upgraded to USB 3.0, networking was now gigabit ethernet like the 3B+, WiFi was dual-band and it had Bluetooth 5.0.</p>
<p>They also changed the single full-size HDMI port to two micro HDMI ports. Most people I know don’t like this change and find it annoying to have to use adaptors to work with common displays and these micro HDMI ports are prone to breaking when they are used often. I think general hobbyists and makers would prefer this to still be a single full-size port but Pi’s are often used in commercial display applications so I guess that’s why they went with this dual micro HDMI configuration.</p><figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="475" src="https://www.the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Pi-4-MicroHDMI-Ports-1024x475.jpeg" alt="Pi 4 MicroHDMI Ports" srcset="https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Pi-4-MicroHDMI-Ports-1024x475.jpeg 1024w, https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Pi-4-MicroHDMI-Ports-300x139.jpeg 300w, https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Pi-4-MicroHDMI-Ports-768x356.jpeg 768w, https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Pi-4-MicroHDMI-Ports-1536x713.jpeg 1536w, https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Pi-4-MicroHDMI-Ports-2048x951.jpeg 2048w, https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Pi-4-MicroHDMI-Ports-150x70.jpeg 150w, https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Pi-4-MicroHDMI-Ports-696x323.jpeg 696w, https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Pi-4-MicroHDMI-Ports-1068x496.jpeg 1068w, https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Pi-4-MicroHDMI-Ports-1920x891.jpeg 1920w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>
<p>The power circuit was actually reduced in this model, from 1.34 down to 1.25A and the port was changed to USB C.</p>
<h3>Raspberry Pi 5</h3>
<p>Lastly and most recently we have the Pi 5 which was launched in October 2023.</p>
<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="570" src="https://www.the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Raspberry-Pi-5-1024x570.jpeg" alt="Raspberry Pi 5" srcset="https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Raspberry-Pi-5-1024x570.jpeg 1024w, https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Raspberry-Pi-5-300x167.jpeg 300w, https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Raspberry-Pi-5-768x428.jpeg 768w, https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Raspberry-Pi-5-1536x855.jpeg 1536w, https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Raspberry-Pi-5-2048x1140.jpeg 2048w, https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Raspberry-Pi-5-150x84.jpeg 150w, https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Raspberry-Pi-5-696x387.jpeg 696w, https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Raspberry-Pi-5-1068x595.jpeg 1068w, https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Raspberry-Pi-5-1920x1069.jpeg 1920w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>
<p>This Pi features a Broadcom BCM2712 SOC with 4 Cortex A76 cores running at a significantly faster 2.4Ghz and a VideoCore VII GPU running at 800MHz.</p><p>So quite a bump up in CPU and GPU performance.</p>
<p>It is offered in 3 RAM configurations but the drop in a 1GB offering means that they’re no longer available at the $35 price point. There is a fairly significant increase in price up to $50 for the base 2GB variant.</p>
<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="570" src="https://www.the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Pi-5-RAM-Configurations-1024x570.jpeg" alt="Pi 5 RAM Configurations" srcset="https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Pi-5-RAM-Configurations-1024x570.jpeg 1024w, https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Pi-5-RAM-Configurations-300x167.jpeg 300w, https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Pi-5-RAM-Configurations-768x428.jpeg 768w, https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Pi-5-RAM-Configurations-1536x855.jpeg 1536w, https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Pi-5-RAM-Configurations-2048x1140.jpeg 2048w, https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Pi-5-RAM-Configurations-150x84.jpeg 150w, https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Pi-5-RAM-Configurations-696x387.jpeg 696w, https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Pi-5-RAM-Configurations-1068x595.jpeg 1068w, https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Pi-5-RAM-Configurations-1920x1069.jpeg 1920w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>
<p>Some other notable changes are the inclusion of a PCIe port which enables IO expansion and a much improved power circuit. The PCIe port is quite commonly used to add an NVMe SSD instead of a microSD card for the operating system.</p><p>The power circuit was upgraded to handle the PCIe port addition, now stepping up to 5V at up to 5A, along with a power button for the first time.</p>
<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="430" src="https://www.the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Pi-5-Power-Button-and-LED-1024x430.jpeg" alt="Pi 5 Power Button and LED" srcset="https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Pi-5-Power-Button-and-LED-1024x430.jpeg 1024w, https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Pi-5-Power-Button-and-LED-300x126.jpeg 300w, https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Pi-5-Power-Button-and-LED-768x323.jpeg 768w, https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Pi-5-Power-Button-and-LED-1536x645.jpeg 1536w, https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Pi-5-Power-Button-and-LED-2048x860.jpeg 2048w, https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Pi-5-Power-Button-and-LED-150x63.jpeg 150w, https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Pi-5-Power-Button-and-LED-696x292.jpeg 696w, https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Pi-5-Power-Button-and-LED-1068x449.jpeg 1068w, https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Pi-5-Power-Button-and-LED-1920x807.jpeg 1920w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>
<p>The change in power supply requirements to 5V and 5A is a bit annoying as most power delivery capable supplies cap out 2.5 or 3A at 5V. It would have been more universal to require a 9V 3A supply to meet the Pis power requirements. I assume they steered away from this because the Pi’s circuitry runs at 5V and 3.3V and they would have then needed to add another onboard DC-DC converter which increases complexity, size and potentially the cost, it would also have made it a bit less efficient. But this does mean that you most likely need to buy a USB C power supply that has been purpose-built for the Pi 5.</p>
<p>The Pi 5 is also the first Pi to have its own dedicated fan socket.</p><p>So that’s a summary of the hardware changes, now let’s boot them up and take a look at their performance.</p>
<h2>Testing The Performance Of Each Generation Of Pi</h2>
<p>To compare the performance between the Pi’s, I’m going to run the following tests.</p>

<ul>
<li>I’m going to attempt to playback a <strong>1080P YouTube video</strong> in the browser, although I expect we’ll have problems with this up to the Pi 4.</li>
<li>We’ll then run a <strong>Sysbench CPU benchmark</strong> which I’ll do both for a single-core and multicore.</li>
<li>Then we’ll run a <strong>GLMark2 GPU benchmark</strong>.</li>
<li>Then test the storage speed using <strong>James Chambers Pi Benchmark script</strong>.</li>
<li>Then we’ll run an <strong>iPerf3 Network Speed</strong> test.</li>
<li>Lastly, we’ll look at <strong>Power Consumption</strong>, both at idle and with the CPU maxed out.</li>
<li>And then use that data to determine each Pi’s <strong>Performance per Watt</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>To keep things as consistent as possible I’m going to be running the latest available version of Pi OS from <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/">Raspberry Pi Imager</a> for each Pi. I was pleasantly surprised to find that you can still flash an OS image for the original Pi in their latest version of Imager.</p><figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="714" src="https://www.the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Raspberry-Pi-Imager-Still-Supports-Pi-1-1024x714.jpeg" alt="Raspberry Pi Imager Still Supports Pi 1" srcset="https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Raspberry-Pi-Imager-Still-Supports-Pi-1-1024x714.jpeg 1024w, https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Raspberry-Pi-Imager-Still-Supports-Pi-1-300x209.jpeg 300w, https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Raspberry-Pi-Imager-Still-Supports-Pi-1-768x536.jpeg 768w, https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Raspberry-Pi-Imager-Still-Supports-Pi-1-1536x1071.jpeg 1536w, https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Raspberry-Pi-Imager-Still-Supports-Pi-1-150x105.jpeg 150w, https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Raspberry-Pi-Imager-Still-Supports-Pi-1-696x485.jpeg 696w, https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Raspberry-Pi-Imager-Still-Supports-Pi-1-1068x745.jpeg 1068w, https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Raspberry-Pi-Imager-Still-Supports-Pi-1.jpeg 1546w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>
<p>I’ll be testing them all running on a 32GB Sandisk Ultra microSD card. I’ll also be using an Ice Tower cooler on each to ensure they don’t run anywhere near thermal throttling.</p>

<h3>1080P YouTube Video Playback</h3>
<p>I started with the original Pi and its first boot and setup process was a lesson in patience. It took me the best part of two hours to get the first boot complete, the Pi updated and the testing utilities installed but I got there in the end.</p>

<p>Even once set up it takes about 8 minutes to boot up to the desktop and the CPU stays pegged at 100% for another two to three minutes before dropping down to about 20% at idle.</p><figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="566" src="https://www.the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Pi-1-Processor-At-100-1024x566.jpeg" alt="Pi 1 Processor At 100%" srcset="https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Pi-1-Processor-At-100-1024x566.jpeg 1024w, https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Pi-1-Processor-At-100-300x166.jpeg 300w, https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Pi-1-Processor-At-100-768x424.jpeg 768w, https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Pi-1-Processor-At-100-1536x849.jpeg 1536w, https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Pi-1-Processor-At-100-2048x1132.jpeg 2048w, https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Pi-1-Processor-At-100-150x83.jpeg 150w, https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Pi-1-Processor-At-100-696x385.jpeg 696w, https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Pi-1-Processor-At-100-1068x590.jpeg 1068w, https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Pi-1-Processor-At-100-1920x1061.jpeg 1920w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>
<p>The original Pi refused to open up the browser, so that’s where my YouTube video playback test ended.</p>
<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="574" src="https://www.the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Pi-1-Wouldnt-Open-Browser-1024x574.jpeg" alt="Pi 1 Wouldn't Open Browser" srcset="https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Pi-1-Wouldnt-Open-Browser-1024x574.jpeg 1024w, https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Pi-1-Wouldnt-Open-Browser-300x168.jpeg 300w, https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Pi-1-Wouldnt-Open-Browser-768x431.jpeg 768w, https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Pi-1-Wouldnt-Open-Browser-1536x861.jpeg 1536w, https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Pi-1-Wouldnt-Open-Browser-2048x1148.jpeg 2048w, https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Pi-1-Wouldnt-Open-Browser-150x84.jpeg 150w, https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Pi-1-Wouldnt-Open-Browser-696x390.jpeg 696w, https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Pi-1-Wouldnt-Open-Browser-1068x599.jpeg 1068w, https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Pi-1-Wouldnt-Open-Browser-1920x1077.jpeg 1920w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>
<p>The Pi 2 managed to open the browser and actually started playing back a 1080P video, which was surprising, but playback was terrible. It dropped pretty much all of the frames both in the window and fullscreen.</p>
<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="574" src="https://www.the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Pi-2-1080P-Video-1024x574.jpeg" alt="Pi 2 1080P Video" srcset="https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Pi-2-1080P-Video-1024x574.jpeg 1024w, https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Pi-2-1080P-Video-300x168.jpeg 300w, https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Pi-2-1080P-Video-768x431.jpeg 768w, https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Pi-2-1080P-Video-1536x861.jpeg 1536w, https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Pi-2-1080P-Video-2048x1148.jpeg 2048w, https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Pi-2-1080P-Video-150x84.jpeg 150w, https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Pi-2-1080P-Video-696x390.jpeg 696w, https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Pi-2-1080P-Video-1068x599.jpeg 1068w, https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Pi-2-1080P-Video-1920x1077.jpeg 1920w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>
<p>The Pi 3 played video back noticeably better than the Pi 2, but it’s still quite a long way away from being usable and still drops a lot of frames.</p><p>The Pi 4 handled 1080P video reasonably well. It had some initial trouble but then settled down. Fullscreen is also a bit choppy but is also usable.</p>
<p>The Pi 5 handled 1080P playback well without any significant issues both in the window and fullscreen.</p>

<h3>Sysbench CPU Benchmark</h3>
<p>Next was the Sysbench CPU benchmark. I ran three tests on each and averaged the scores and I did this for both single-core and multicore.</p><figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="573" src="https://www.the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Sysbench-CPU-Benchmark-1024x573.jpeg" alt="Sysbench CPU Benchmark" srcset="https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Sysbench-CPU-Benchmark-1024x573.jpeg 1024w, https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Sysbench-CPU-Benchmark-300x168.jpeg 300w, https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Sysbench-CPU-Benchmark-768x430.jpeg 768w, https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Sysbench-CPU-Benchmark-1536x860.jpeg 1536w, https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Sysbench-CPU-Benchmark-2048x1146.jpeg 2048w, https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Sysbench-CPU-Benchmark-150x84.jpeg 150w, https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Sysbench-CPU-Benchmark-696x389.jpeg 696w, https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Sysbench-CPU-Benchmark-1068x598.jpeg 1068w, https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Sysbench-CPU-Benchmark-1920x1074.jpeg 1920w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>
<p>In single core, the Pi 1 managed a rather dismal score of 68, the Pi 2 got a bit more than double this score but the real step up was with the Pi 3 which managed 18 times higher than the Pi 2. The Pi 4 and Pi 5 also offered good improvements on the previous generations.</p>
<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="557" src="https://www.the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Sysbench-Single-Core-Scores-1024x557.jpeg" alt="Sysbench Single Core Scores" srcset="https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Sysbench-Single-Core-Scores-1024x557.jpeg 1024w, https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Sysbench-Single-Core-Scores-300x163.jpeg 300w, https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Sysbench-Single-Core-Scores-768x418.jpeg 768w, https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Sysbench-Single-Core-Scores-1536x836.jpeg 1536w, https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Sysbench-Single-Core-Scores-2048x1114.jpeg 2048w, https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Sysbench-Single-Core-Scores-150x82.jpeg 150w, https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Sysbench-Single-Core-Scores-696x379.jpeg 696w, https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Sysbench-Single-Core-Scores-1068x581.jpeg 1068w, https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Sysbench-Single-Core-Scores-1920x1044.jpeg 1920w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>
<p>Similarly in multicore, the Pi 3 scored over 18 times the score of the Pi2 and the Pi 4 and 5 provided good improvements on the Pi 3’s score.</p>
<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="574" src="https://www.the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Sysbench-Multi-core-Scores-1024x574.jpeg" alt="Sysbench Multi-core Scores" srcset="https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Sysbench-Multi-core-Scores-1024x574.jpeg 1024w, https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Sysbench-Multi-core-Scores-300x168.jpeg 300w, https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Sysbench-Multi-core-Scores-768x431.jpeg 768w, https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Sysbench-Multi-core-Scores-1536x861.jpeg 1536w, https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Sysbench-Multi-core-Scores-2048x1148.jpeg 2048w, https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Sysbench-Multi-core-Scores-150x84.jpeg 150w, https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Sysbench-Multi-core-Scores-696x390.jpeg 696w, https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Sysbench-Multi-core-Scores-1068x599.jpeg 1068w, https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Sysbench-Multi-core-Scores-1920x1077.jpeg 1920w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>
<p>Comparing the combined multicore score of the Pi 5 to what the single core on the Pi 1 can do, the Pi 5 is a little over 600 times faster.</p><h3>GLmark2 GPU Benchmark</h3>
<p>Next, I tried running a GLMark2 GPU benchmark on them. I used the <a href="https://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/focal/man1/glmark2-es2-wayland.1.html">GLMark2-es2-wayland</a> version which is designed for OpenGL ES so that the Pi 1 was supported.</p>

</figure>
<p>I was surprised that the Pi 1 was even able to run GLMark2 – it did complete the benchmark, although the score wasn’t all that impressive.</p>
<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="570" src="https://www.the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/GLmark2-Scores-1024x570.jpeg" alt="GLmark2 Scores" srcset="https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/GLmark2-Scores-1024x570.jpeg 1024w, https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/GLmark2-Scores-300x167.jpeg 300w, https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/GLmark2-Scores-768x428.jpeg 768w, https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/GLmark2-Scores-1536x855.jpeg 1536w, https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/GLmark2-Scores-2048x1140.jpeg 2048w, https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/GLmark2-Scores-150x84.jpeg 150w, https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/GLmark2-Scores-696x387.jpeg 696w, https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/GLmark2-Scores-1068x595.jpeg 1068w, https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/GLmark2-Scores-1920x1069.jpeg 1920w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>
<p>These results really show how the Pi’s GPU has improved in the last two generations. Prior to these tests, I had never seen a score below 100 and the Pi 1, 2 and 3 managed to fall short of triple digits. Pi 5 scored over 2.5 times higher than the Pi 4.</p><h3>Storage Speed Test</h3>
<p>Next was the storage speed test using <a href="https://github.com/TheRemote/PiBenchmarks">James Chambers Pi Benchmarks</a> script. The bus speed has increased over the years from 25MHz on the Pi 1 to 100MHz on the Pi 5, so I expect we’ll see these reflected in the benchmark scores.</p>

<p>The storage speed test’s results aren’t as dramatic as the CPU and GPU results but show a steady improvement between generations. The Pi 3 did a bit worse than the Pi 2 but this small difference is likely just due to variability in the tests.</p>

<h3>iPerf Network Speed Test</h3>
<p>Next, I ran the iPerf network speed test on each.</p><figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="574" src="https://www.the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/iPerf-Network-Speed-Test-1024x574.jpeg" alt="iPerf Network Speed Test" srcset="https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/iPerf-Network-Speed-Test-1024x574.jpeg 1024w, https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/iPerf-Network-Speed-Test-300x168.jpeg 300w, https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/iPerf-Network-Speed-Test-768x430.jpeg 768w, https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/iPerf-Network-Speed-Test-1536x860.jpeg 1536w, https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/iPerf-Network-Speed-Test-2048x1147.jpeg 2048w, https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/iPerf-Network-Speed-Test-150x84.jpeg 150w, https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/iPerf-Network-Speed-Test-696x390.jpeg 696w, https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/iPerf-Network-Speed-Test-1068x598.jpeg 1068w, https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/iPerf-Network-Speed-Test-1920x1076.jpeg 1920w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>
<p>The Pi 1 doesn’t quite get close to its theoretical 100Mbps but the Pi 2 does. The Pi 3 B+ although having Gigabit Ethernet is limited by this running over USB 2.0 which only has a theoretical maximum of 300MBps, so it came quite close. Both the Pi 4 and 5 expectedly come close to theoretical Gigabit speeds.</p>

<h3>Power Consumption Test</h3>
<p>Lastly, I tested the power consumption of each Pi at idle and under load.</p>

<p>I used the same Pi 5 power adaptor to test all of the Pis to keep things consistent and I just used a USB C to micro USB adaptor for the Pi 1, 2 and 3.</p><figure>

<p>The idle results were closer than I expected. The Pi 2 had the lowest idle power draw and the Pi 5 the highest, but all were within a watt or two of each other. At full load, you can see the increase in CPU power draw more physical power with the Pi 5 drawing almost three times the Pi 1 and Pi 2.</p>

<p>Converted to performance per watt using the Sysbench results, we can again see how much better the Pi 4 and 5 are over the Pi 1 and 2. There is a clear improvement in the performance that each generation of Pi is able to get per watt of power, which is essentially its efficiency. Although the Pi 5 draws more power than the Pi 1 under full load, you’re getting almost 200 times more power out of it per watt.</p>

<h2>Final Thoughts On The Drag Race And Future Pis</h2>
<p>I really enjoyed working through this project to see how much Pi’s have changed over the years, particularly in terms of performance. I still remember being amazed at the size and price of the original Pi when it came out and it’s great that they’re still fully supported and can still be used for projects – albeit with less CPU-intensive projects.</p><figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="572" src="https://www.the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Buck-Bunny-Playing-On-Raspberry-Pi-1024x572.jpeg" alt="Buck Bunny Playing On Raspberry Pi" srcset="https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Buck-Bunny-Playing-On-Raspberry-Pi-1024x572.jpeg 1024w, https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Buck-Bunny-Playing-On-Raspberry-Pi-300x168.jpeg 300w, https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Buck-Bunny-Playing-On-Raspberry-Pi-768x429.jpeg 768w, https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Buck-Bunny-Playing-On-Raspberry-Pi-1536x858.jpeg 1536w, https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Buck-Bunny-Playing-On-Raspberry-Pi-2048x1144.jpeg 2048w, https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Buck-Bunny-Playing-On-Raspberry-Pi-150x84.jpeg 150w, https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Buck-Bunny-Playing-On-Raspberry-Pi-696x389.jpeg 696w, https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Buck-Bunny-Playing-On-Raspberry-Pi-1068x596.jpeg 1068w, https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Buck-Bunny-Playing-On-Raspberry-Pi-1920x1072.jpeg 1920w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>
<p>Let me know what you think has been the biggest improvement to the Pi over the years and what you’d still like to see added to future models in the comments section below.</p>
<p>I personally really like the addition of the PCIe port on the Pi 5 and I’d like to see 2.5Gb networking and a DisplayPort or USB C with DisplayPort added to a future generation of Pi.</p>
