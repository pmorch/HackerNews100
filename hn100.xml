It was also a stepping stone on the path to horizontal sharding.</p></div><p>Figma’s database stack has grown almost 100x since 2020. This is a <em>good</em> problem to have because it means our business is expanding, but it also poses some tricky technical challenges. Over the past four years, we’ve made a significant effort to stay ahead of the curve and avoid potential growing pains. In 2020, we were running a single Postgres database hosted on AWS’s largest physical instance, and by the end of 2022, we had built out a distributed architecture with caching, read replicas, and a dozen vertically partitioned databases. We split groups of related tables—like “Figma files” or “Organizations”—into their own vertical partitions, which allowed us to make incremental scaling gains and maintain enough runway to stay ahead of&nbsp;our&nbsp;growth.</p><div><p><a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/how-figma-scaled-to-multiple-databases/"><img src="data:image/png;base64,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" alt="One large database silo connected to two smaller ones." data-lqip="true"><img data-loading="true" loading="lazy" alt="One large database silo connected to two smaller ones." src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/localized/5c8ad1394a1cf21fc39adf7ca3d9f317c8b98b80-2120x1000.png?w=2120&amp;h=1000&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/localized/5c8ad1394a1cf21fc39adf7ca3d9f317c8b98b80-2120x1000.png?q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 1060w, https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/localized/5c8ad1394a1cf21fc39adf7ca3d9f317c8b98b80-2120x1000.png?q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 1590w, https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/localized/5c8ad1394a1cf21fc39adf7ca3d9f317c8b98b80-2120x1000.png?q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 2120w"></a></p></div><p>Despite our incremental scaling progress, we always knew that vertical partitioning could only get us so far. Our initial scaling efforts had focused on reducing Postgres CPU utilization. As our fleet grew larger and more heterogeneous, we started to monitor a range of bottlenecks. We used a combination of historical data and load-testing to quantify database scaling limits from CPU and IO to table size and rows written. Identifying these limits was crucial to predicting how much runway we had per shard. We could then prioritize scaling problems before they ballooned into major reliability risks.</p><p>The data revealed that some of our tables, containing several terabytes and billions of rows, were becoming too large for a single database. At this size, we began to see reliability impact during Postgres vacuums, which are essential background operations that keep Postgres from running out of transaction IDs and breaking down. Our highest write tables were growing so quickly that we would soon exceed the maximum IO operations per second (IOPS) supported by Amazon’s Relational Database Service (RDS). Vertical partitioning couldn’t save us here because the smallest unit of partitioning is a single table. To keep our databases from toppling, we needed a&nbsp;bigger&nbsp;lever.</p><h2 id="scaffolding-for-scale"><a href="#scaffolding-for-scale">Scaffolding for scale</a></h2><p>We outlined a number of goals and must-haves to tackle short-term challenges while setting us up for smooth long-term growth. We&nbsp;aimed&nbsp;to:</p><ul><li><strong>Minimize developer impact: </strong>We wanted to handle the majority of our complex relational data model supported by our application. Application developers could then focus on building exciting new features in Figma instead of refactoring large parts of our&nbsp;codebase.</li><li><strong>Scale out transparently:</strong> As we scale in the future, we don’t want to have to make additional changes at the application layer. This means that after any initial upfront work to make a table compatible, future scale-outs should be transparent to our product&nbsp;teams.</li><li><strong>Skip expensive backfills:</strong> We avoided solutions that involve backfilling large tables or every table at Figma. Given the size of our tables and Postgres throughput constraints, these backfills would have taken&nbsp;months.</li><li><strong>Make incremental progress: </strong>We identified approaches that could be rolled out incrementally as we de-risked major production changes. This reduced the risk of major outages and allowed the databases team to maintain Figma’s reliability throughout the&nbsp;migration.</li><li><strong>Avoid one-way migrations: </strong>We maintained the ability to roll back even after a physical sharding operation is completed. This reduced the risk of being stuck in a bad state when unknown <em>unknowns</em> occur.</li><li><strong>Maintain strong data consistency: </strong>We wanted to avoid complex solutions like double-writes that are challenging to implement without taking downtime or compromising on consistency. We also wanted a solution that would allow us to scale out with near-zero downtime.</li><li><strong>Play to our strengths: </strong>Since we were operating under tight deadline pressure, whenever possible, we favored approaches that could be rolled out incrementally on our fastest growing tables. We aimed to leverage existing expertise and&nbsp;technology.</li></ul><h2 id="exploring-our-options"><a href="#exploring-our-options">Exploring our options</a></h2><p>There are many popular open source and managed solutions for horizontally sharded databases that are compatible with Postgres or MySQL. During our evaluation, we explored CockroachDB, TiDB, Spanner, and Vitess. However, switching to any of these alternative databases would have required a complex data migration to ensure consistency and reliability across two different database stores. Additionally, over the past few years, we’ve developed a lot of expertise on how to reliably and performantly run RDS Postgres in-house. While migrating, we would have had to rebuild our domain expertise from scratch. Given our very aggressive growth rate, we had only months of runway remaining. De-risking an entirely new storage layer and completing an end-to-end-migration of our most business-critical use cases would have been extremely risky on the necessary timeline. We favored known low-risk solutions over potentially easier options with much higher uncertainty, where we had less control over the&nbsp;outcome.</p><p>NoSQL databases are another common scalable-by-default solution that companies adopt as they grow. However, we have a very complex relational data model built on top of our current Postgres architecture and NoSQL APIs don’t offer this kind of versatility. We wanted to keep our engineers focused on shipping great features and building new products instead of rewriting almost our entire backend application; NoSQL wasn’t a viable solution.</p><p>Given these tradeoffs, we began to explore building a horizontally sharded solution on top of our existing vertically partitioned RDS Postgres infrastructure. It didn’t make sense for our small team to re-implement a generic horizontally sharded relational database in-house; in doing so, we’d be competing with tools built by the likes of large open source communities or dedicated database vendors. However, because we were tailoring horizontal sharding to Figma’s specific architecture, we could get away with providing a much smaller feature set. For example, we chose not to support atomic cross-shard transactions because we could work around cross-shard transaction failures. We picked a colocation strategy that minimized the changes required at the application layer. This allowed us to support a subset of Postgres that was compatible with the majority of our product logic. We also were able to easily maintain backwards compatibility between sharded and unsharded postgres. If we ran into unknown <em>unknowns</em>, we could easily <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/how-figma-scaled-to-multiple-databases/#the-logical-choice">roll back to unsharded</a> Postgres.</p><h2 id="the-path-to-horizontal-sharding"><a href="#the-path-to-horizontal-sharding">The path to horizontal sharding</a></h2><p>Even with these narrower requirements, we knew horizontal sharding would be our largest and most complex database project to date. Luckily, our incremental scaling approach over the past few years bought us the runway to make this investment. In late 2022, we set out to unlock nearly infinite database scalability, and horizontal sharding—the process of breaking up a single table or group of tables and splitting the data across multiple physical database instances—was the key. Once a table is horizontally sharded at the application layer, it can support any number of shards at the physical layer. We can always scale out further by simply running a physical shard split. These operations happen transparently in the background, with minimal downtime and no application level changes required. This capability would allow us to stay ahead of our remaining database scaling bottlenecks, removing one of the last major scaling challenges for Figma. If vertical partitioning let us accelerate to highway speeds, horizontal sharding could remove our speed limits and&nbsp;let&nbsp;us&nbsp;fly.</p><div><figure><div><p><img

sharding</figcaption></figure></div><p>Horizontal sharding was an order of magnitude more complex than our previous scaling efforts. When a table is split across multiple physical databases, we lose many of the reliability and consistency properties that we take for granted in ACID SQL databases. For&nbsp;example:</p><ul><li>Certain SQL queries become inefficient or impossible to&nbsp;support.</li><li>Application code must be updated to provide enough information to efficiently route queries to the correct shard(s) wherever possible.</li><li>Schema changes must be coordinated across all shards to ensure the databases stay in sync. Foreign keys and globally unique indexes can no longer be enforced by&nbsp;Postgres.</li><li>Transactions now span multiple shards, meaning Postgres can no longer be used to enforce transactionality. It is now possible that writes to some databases will succeed while others fail. Care must be taken to ensure product logic is resilient to these “partial commit failures” (imagine moving a team between two organizations, only to find half their data was&nbsp;missing!).</li></ul><p>We knew achieving full horizontal sharding would be a multi-year effort. We needed to de-risk the project as much as possible while delivering incremental value. Our first goal was to shard a relatively simple but very high traffic table in production as soon as possible. This would prove the viability of horizontal sharding while also extending our runway on our most loaded database. We could then continue building additional features as we worked to shard more complex groups of tables. Even the simplest possible feature set was still a significant undertaking. End to end, it took our team roughly nine months to shard our first&nbsp;table.</p><h2 id="our-unique-approach"><a href="#our-unique-approach">Our unique approach</a></h2><p>Our horizontal sharding work built on what many others do, but with some unusual design choices. Here are a few&nbsp;highlights:</p><ul><li><strong>Colos</strong>: We horizontally sharded groups of related tables into colocations (which we affectionately call “colos”), which shared the same sharding key and physical sharding layout. This provided a friendly abstraction for developers to interact with horizontally sharded&nbsp;tables.</li><li><strong>Logical sharding: </strong>We separated the concept of “logical sharding” at the application layer from “physical sharding” at the Postgres layer. We leveraged views to perform a safer and lower cost logical sharding rollout before we executed a riskier distributed physical failover.</li><li><strong>DBProxy query engine: </strong>We built a DBProxy service that intercepts SQL queries generated by our application layer, and dynamically routes queries to various Postgres databases. DBProxy includes a query engine capable of parsing and executing complex horizontally sharded queries. DBProxy also allowed us to implement features like dynamic load-shedding and request hedging.</li><li><strong>Shadow application readiness: </strong>We added a “shadow application readiness” framework capable of predicting how live production traffic would behave under different potential sharding keys. This gave product teams a clear picture of what application logic needed to be refactored or removed to prepare the application for horizontal sharding.</li><li><strong>Full logical replication</strong>: We avoided having to implement “filtered logical replication” (where only a subset of data is copied to each shard). Instead, we copied over the entire dataset and then only allowed reads/writes to the subset of data belonging to a&nbsp;given&nbsp;shard.</li></ul><h2 id="our-sharding-implementation"><a href="#our-sharding-implementation">Our sharding implementation</a></h2><p>One of the most important decisions in horizontal sharding is which shard key to use. Horizontal sharding adds many data model constraints that revolve around the shard key. For example, most queries need to include the shard key so that the request can be routed to the right shard. Certain database constraints, like foreign keys, only work when the foreign key is the sharding key. The shard key also needs to distribute data evenly across all shards to avoid hotspots that cause reliability issues or impact scalability.</p><div><p>Figma lives in the browser, and many users can collaborate in parallel on the same Figma file. This means that our product is powered by a fairly complex relational data model capturing file metadata, organization metadata, comments, file versions, and&nbsp;more.</p></div><p>We considered using the same sharding key for every table, but there was no single good candidate in our existing data model. To add a unified sharding key, we would have had to create a composite key, add the column to every table’s schema, run expensive backfills to populate it, and then substantially refactor our product logic. Instead, we tailored our approach to Figma’s unique data model and selected a handful of sharding keys like UserID, FileID, or OrgID. Almost every table at Figma could be sharded using one of&nbsp;these&nbsp;keys.</p><p>We introduced the concept of colos, which provide a friendly abstraction for product developers: Tables within a colo support cross-table joins and full transactions when restricted to a single sharding key. Most application code already interacted with the database this way, which minimized the work required by application developers to make a table ready for horizontal sharding.</p><div><figure><div><p><img src="data:image/png;base64,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" alt="Three data silos, each containing blocks for &quot;users table&quot; and &quot;user favorites table.&quot;" width="804" height="536" data-lqip="true"><img data-loading="true" width="804" height="536" loading="lazy" alt="Three data silos, each containing blocks for &quot;users table&quot; and &quot;user favorites table.&quot;" src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/localized/8610966e627e683caaff88094d9dd8b75efa1a3b-2160x1440.png?w=804&amp;h=536&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/localized/8610966e627e683caaff88094d9dd8b75efa1a3b-2160x1440.png?w=804&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 402w, https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/localized/8610966e627e683caaff88094d9dd8b75efa1a3b-2160x1440.png?w=804&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 603w, https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/localized/8610966e627e683caaff88094d9dd8b75efa1a3b-2160x1440.png?w=804&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format 804w, https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/localized/8610966e627e683caaff88094d9dd8b75efa1a3b-2160x1440.png?w=804&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1206w, https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/localized/8610966e627e683caaff88094d9dd8b75efa1a3b-2160x1440.png?w=804&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1608w"></p></div><figcaption>Tables sharded by UserID and by FileID are each colocated together</figcaption></figure><figure><div><p><img src="data:image/png;base64,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" alt="Three data silos, each containing blocks for &quot;files table&quot; and &quot;file comments table.&quot;" width="804" height="536" data-lqip="true"><img data-loading="true" width="804" height="536" loading="lazy" alt="Three data silos, each containing blocks for &quot;files table&quot; and &quot;file comments table.&quot;" src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/localized/53ad07418b852f047bf1f19719c63dbf2d211cc3-2160x1440.png?w=804&amp;h=536&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/localized/53ad07418b852f047bf1f19719c63dbf2d211cc3-2160x1440.png?w=804&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 402w, https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/localized/53ad07418b852f047bf1f19719c63dbf2d211cc3-2160x1440.png?w=804&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 603w, https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/localized/53ad07418b852f047bf1f19719c63dbf2d211cc3-2160x1440.png?w=804&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format 804w, https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/localized/53ad07418b852f047bf1f19719c63dbf2d211cc3-2160x1440.png?w=804&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1206w, https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/localized/53ad07418b852f047bf1f19719c63dbf2d211cc3-2160x1440.png?w=804&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1608w"></p></div></figure></div><p>Once we picked our sharding keys, we needed to ensure that there would be an even distribution of data across all backend databases. Unfortunately, many of the sharding keys that we had picked used auto-incrementing or Snowflake timestamp-prefixed IDs. This would have resulted in significant hotspots where a single shard contained the majority of our data. We explored migrating to more randomized IDs, but this required an expensive and time-consuming data migration. Instead, we decided to use the hash of the sharding key for routing. As long as we picked a sufficiently random hash function, we would ensure a uniform distribution of data. One downside of this is that range-scans on shard keys are less efficient, since sequential keys will be hashed to different database shards. However, this query pattern is not common in our codebase, so it was a trade-off we were willing to&nbsp;live&nbsp;with.</p><h3 id="the-logical-solution"><a href="#the-logical-solution">The “logical” solution</a></h3><p>To de-risk the horizontal sharding rollout, we wanted to isolate the process of preparing a table at the application layer from the physical process of running a shard split. To do this, we separated “logical sharding” from “physical sharding.” We could then decouple the two parts of our migration to implement and de-risk them independently. Logically sharding gave us confidence in our serving stack with a low-risk, percentage-based rollout. Rolling back logical sharding when we found bugs was a simple configuration change. Rolling back a physical shard operation is possible, but it requires more complex coordination to ensure data consistency.</p><p>Once a table is logically sharded, all reads and writes will act as if the table is already horizontally sharded. From a reliability, latency, and consistency perspective, we appear to be horizontally sharded, even though the data is still physically located on a single database host. When we are confident that logical sharding is working as expected, we then perform the physical sharding operation. This is the process of copying the data from a single database, sharding it across multiple backends, then re-routing read and write traffic through the new&nbsp;databases.</p><div><figure><div><p><img src="data:image/png;base64,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" alt="Two data silos with blocks for logical and physical shards." width="804" height="536" data-lqip="true"><img data-loading="true" width="804" height="536" loading="lazy" alt="Two data silos with blocks for logical and physical shards." src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/localized/fc28f4926b31d5e5b9cc97a8fc622ac5788ca865-2160x1440.png?w=804&amp;h=536&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/localized/fc28f4926b31d5e5b9cc97a8fc622ac5788ca865-2160x1440.png?w=804&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 402w, https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/localized/fc28f4926b31d5e5b9cc97a8fc622ac5788ca865-2160x1440.png?w=804&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 603w, https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/localized/fc28f4926b31d5e5b9cc97a8fc622ac5788ca865-2160x1440.png?w=804&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format 804w, https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/localized/fc28f4926b31d5e5b9cc97a8fc622ac5788ca865-2160x1440.png?w=804&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1206w, https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/localized/fc28f4926b31d5e5b9cc97a8fc622ac5788ca865-2160x1440.png?w=804&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1608w"></p></div><figcaption>Four logical shards on two physical shards</figcaption></figure></div><h3 id="the-query-engine-that-could"><a href="#the-query-engine-that-could">The query engine that&nbsp;could</a></h3><p>To support horizontal sharding, we had to significantly re-architect our backend stack.

Fun, but overdo it, and your speedy database starts feeling more like a snail, especially with complex queries.</p></div><p>Some queries are relatively easy to implement in a horizontally sharded world. For example, single-shard queries are filtered to a single shard key. Our query engine just needs to extract the shard key and route the query to the appropriate physical database. We can “push down” the complexity of the query execution into Postgres. However, if the query is missing a sharding key, our query engine has to perform a more complex <strong>“scatter-gather.”</strong> In this case, we need to fan out the query to all shards (the scatter phase) and then aggregate back results (the gather phase). In some cases, like complex aggregations, joins, and nested SQL, this scatter-gather can be very complex to implement<em>. </em>Additionally, having too many scatter-gathers would impact horizontal sharding scalability. Because the queries have to touch every single database, each scatter-gather contributes the same amount of load as it would if the database was&nbsp;unsharded.</p><p>If we supported full SQL compatibility, our DBProxy service would have begun to look a lot like the Postgres database query engine. We wanted to simplify our API to minimize DBProxy’s complexity, while also reducing the work required for our application developers, who would have to re-write any unsupported queries. To determine the right subset, we built out a “shadow planning” framework, which allowed users to define potential sharding schemes for their tables and then run shadow the logical planning phase on top of live production traffic. We logged the queries and associated query plans to a Snowflake database, where we could run offline analysis. From this data, we picked a query language that supported the most common 90% of queries, but avoided worst-case complexity in our query engine. For example, all range scan and point queries are allowed, but joins are only allowed when joining two tables in the same colo and the join is on the sharding&nbsp;key.</p><h3 id="a-view-of-the-future"><a href="#a-view-of-the-future">A view of the&nbsp;future</a></h3><p>We then needed to figure out how to encapsulate our logical shards. We explored partitioning the data using separate Postgres databases or Postgres schemas. Unfortunately, this would have required physical data changes when we logically sharded the application, which was just as complex as doing the physical shard&nbsp;split.</p><p>Instead, we chose to represent our shards with Postgres views. We could create multiple views per-table, each corresponding to the subset of data in a given shard. This would look like: <code>CREATE VIEW table_shard1 AS SELECT * FROM table WHERE hash(shard_key) &gt;= min_shard_range AND hash(shard_key) &lt; max_shard_range).</code> All reads and writes to the table would be sent through these&nbsp;views.</p><p>By creating sharded views on top of our existing unsharded physical databases, we could logically shard before we performed any risky physical reshard operations. Each view is accessed via its own sharded connection pooler service. The connection poolers still point to the unsharded physical instance, which gives the appearance of being sharded. We were able to de-risk the rollout of sharded reads and writes gradually via feature flags in the query engine and roll back at any time within seconds by just rerouting traffic back to the main table. By the time we ran our first reshard, we were confident in the safety of the sharded topology.</p><div><figure><div><p><img src="data:image/png;base64,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" alt="An unsharded databases with views of four different shards." width="804" height="536" data-lqip="true"><img data-loading="true" width="804" height="536" loading="lazy" alt="An unsharded databases with views of four different shards." src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/localized/654e4ee15b6ee16b9208ad020eb2ae654b34d0a8-2160x1440.png?w=804&amp;h=536&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/localized/654e4ee15b6ee16b9208ad020eb2ae654b34d0a8-2160x1440.png?w=804&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 402w, https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/localized/654e4ee15b6ee16b9208ad020eb2ae654b34d0a8-2160x1440.png?w=804&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 603w, https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/localized/654e4ee15b6ee16b9208ad020eb2ae654b34d0a8-2160x1440.png?w=804&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format 804w, https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/localized/654e4ee15b6ee16b9208ad020eb2ae654b34d0a8-2160x1440.png?w=804&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1206w, https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/localized/654e4ee15b6ee16b9208ad020eb2ae654b34d0a8-2160x1440.png?w=804&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1608w"></p></div><figcaption>By creating multiple views in an unsharded database, we can query the views as if the data was already physically sharded.</figcaption></figure></div><p>Of course, relying on views also introduced added risks. Views add a performance overhead and in some cases could fundamentally change how the Postgres query planner optimizes queries. To validate that approach, we collected a query corpus of sanitized production queries and ran load tests with and without views. We were able to confirm that views would only add a minimal performance overhead in most cases, and less than 10% in the worst cases. We also built out a shadow reads framework which could send all live read traffic through views, comparing the performance and correctness of view versus non-view queries. We were then able to confirm that views were a viable solution with minimal performance impact.</p><h3 id="tackling-our-topology"><a href="#tackling-our-topology">Tackling our topology</a></h3><p>To perform query routing, DBProxy has to understand the topology of our tables and physical databases. Because we had separated the concept of logical versus physical sharding, we needed a way to represent these abstractions within our topology. For example, we need to be able to map a table (users) to its shard key (user_id). Similarly, we needed to be able to map a logical shard ID (123) to the appropriate logical and physical databases. With vertical partitioning, we relied on a simple, hard-coded configuration file that mapped tables to their partition. However, as we moved towards horizontal sharding, we required something more sophisticated. Our topology would change dynamically during shard splits and DBProxy needed to quickly update its state to avoid routing requests to the wrong database. Because every change to topology is backwards compatible, these changes are never in the critical path for our site. We built out a database topology that encapsulated our complex horizontal sharding metadata and could deliver real-time updates in under&nbsp;a&nbsp;second.</p><div><figure><div><p><img src="data:image/png;base64,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" alt="A topology library that leads to a square (S3) and a cylinder (ETCD)." width="804" height="536" data-lqip="true"><img data-loading="true" width="804" height="536" loading="lazy" alt="A topology library that leads to a square (S3) and a cylinder (ETCD)." src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/localized/8db2e5fe21409fc4c47fc77909a0f8f8f33383e6-2160x1440.png?w=804&amp;h=536&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/localized/8db2e5fe21409fc4c47fc77909a0f8f8f33383e6-2160x1440.png?w=804&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 402w, https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/localized/8db2e5fe21409fc4c47fc77909a0f8f8f33383e6-2160x1440.png?w=804&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 603w, https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/localized/8db2e5fe21409fc4c47fc77909a0f8f8f33383e6-2160x1440.png?w=804&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format 804w, https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/localized/8db2e5fe21409fc4c47fc77909a0f8f8f33383e6-2160x1440.png?w=804&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1206w, https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/localized/8db2e5fe21409fc4c47fc77909a0f8f8f33383e6-2160x1440.png?w=804&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1608w"></p></div><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div><p>Having a separate logical and physical topology allowed us to also simplify some of our database management. For example, in our non-production environments, we can keep the same logical topology as production, but serve the data from many fewer physical databases. This saves costs and reduces complexity without having too many changes across environments. The topology library also allowed us to enforce invariants across our topology (e.g. every shard ID should be mapped to exactly one physical database) that were critical to maintaining the correctness of our system as we built out horizontal sharding.</p><h3 id="the-physical-sharding-operation"><a href="#the-physical-sharding-operation">The physical sharding operation</a></h3><p>Once a table is ready for sharding, the last step is the physical failover from unsharded to sharded databases. We were able to reuse much of the same logic for horizontal sharding, but there were a few notable differences: Instead of moving data from 1 to 1 database, we were going from 1 to N. We needed to make the failover process resilient to new failure modes where the sharding operation could succeed on only a subset of our databases. Still, many of the riskiest components had already been de-risked during vertical partitioning. We were able to move much faster towards our first physical sharding operation than would have otherwise been&nbsp;possible.</p><h2 id="we-ve-come-a-long-way"><a href="#we-ve-come-a-long-way">We’ve come a&nbsp;long&nbsp;way</a></h2><p>When we started this journey, we knew that horizontal sharding would be a multi-year investment into Figma’s future scalability. We shipped our first horizontally sharded table in September 2023. We successfully failed over with only ten seconds of partial availability on database primaries and no availability impact on replicas. We saw no regressions in latency or availability after sharding. Since then we’ve been tackling relatively simple shards from our highest write rate databases. This year, we’ll shard increasingly complex databases, which have dozens of tables and thousands of code call-sites.</p><p>To remove our last scaling limits and truly take flight, we will need to horizontally shard every table at Figma. A fully horizontally sharded world will bring many other benefits: improved reliability, cost savings, and developer velocity. Along the way, we’ll need to solve all of these&nbsp;problems:</p><ul><li>Support for horizontally sharded schema&nbsp;updates</li><li>Globally unique ID generation for horizontally sharded primary&nbsp;keys</li><li>Atomic cross-shard transactions for business critical use-cases</li><li>Distributed globally unique indexes (currently unique indexes are only supported on indexes including the sharding&nbsp;key)</li><li>An ORM model that increases developer velocity and is seamlessly compatible with horizontal sharding</li><li>Fully automated reshard operations that can run shard splits with the click of&nbsp;a&nbsp;button</li></ul><p>Once we’ve bought ourselves sufficient runway, we will also reassess our original approach of in-house RDS horizontal sharding. We started this journey 18 months ago with extremely tight timeline pressure. NewSQL stores have continued to evolve and mature. We will finally have bandwidth to reevaluate the tradeoffs of continuing down our current path versus switching to an open source or managed solution.</p><p>We’ve made a lot of exciting progress on our horizontal sharding journey, but our challenges are just beginning<em>. </em>Stay tuned for more deep dives into different parts of our horizontal sharding stack.

<p dir="auto">Traditional approaches to browser automations required writing custom scripts for websites, often relying on DOM parsing and XPath-based interactions which would break whenever the website layouts changed.</p>
<p dir="auto">Instead of only relying on code-defined XPath interactions, Skyvern adds computer vision and LLMs to the mix to parse items in the viewport in real-time, create a plan for interaction and interact with them.</p>
<p dir="auto">This approach gives us a few advantages:</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>Skyvern can operate on websites it’s never seen before, as it’s able to map visual elements to actions necessary to complete a workflow, without any customized code</li>
<li>Skyvern is resistant to website layout changes, as there are no pre-determined XPaths or other selectors our system is looking for while trying to navigate</li>
<li>Skyvern leverages LLMs to reason through interactions to ensure we can cover complex situations. Examples include:
<ol dir="auto">
<li>If you wanted to get an auto insurance quote from Geico, the answer to a common question “Were you eligible to drive at 18?” could be inferred from the driver receiving their license at age 16</li>
<li>If you were doing competitor analysis, it’s understanding that an Arnold Palmer 22 oz can at 7/11 is almost definitely the same product as a 23 oz can at Gopuff (even though the sizes are slightly different, which could be a rounding error!)</li>
</ol>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://cellio.dreamwidth.org/2024/03/12/glassdoor-violates-privacy.html">https://cellio.dreamwidth.org/2024/03/12/glassdoor-violates-privacy.html</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39705788">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Recently I contacted Glassdoor for an account-related issue.  This led to them sending me email that I had to respond to.  <strong>Big mistake.</strong></p>

<p>The TL;DR is: Glassdoor now requires your real name <strong>and will add it to older accounts without your consent if they learn it</strong>, and your only option is to delete your account.  They do not care that this puts people at risk with their employers.  They do not care that this seems to run counter to their own data-privacy policies.</p>



<p>I created my Glassdoor account about ten years ago.  The only information they required at the time was an email address -- or you could sign in with Facebook or Google if you wanted, which I declined to do.  Early on I set some job alerts, including location, as one does on a site with job postings.  I didn't worry about that too much at the time.</p>

<p>After I responded to that support email last week, I found that they had <strong>updated my profile to add my real name and location</strong>, the name pulled from the email From line I didn't think to cloak because <em>who does that?</em>  I never gave consent for that change, and said so explicitly when I objected.  (In what follows, I was so fixated on my <em>name</em> that I didn't immediately notice my <em>city</em> was there too.  I don't know how long it's been there.)</p>

<p>For context, here are some quotes from <a href="https://help.glassdoor.com/s/privacyrequest?language=en_US">their own data policy</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As a global company, Glassdoor is subject to a variety of privacy laws that confer a range of privacy rights upon our users. We are committed to working to support compliance with the requirements of these global privacy laws and ensuring the rights and protections they offer are available to all of our users regardless of their location. [...]</p>
  
  <p>We allow you to learn about, access, and control the personal data that Glassdoor holds about you. This includes data related to your use of Glassdoor.com, Fishbowlapp.com, and our associated apps. Using the form at the bottom of this page, you can request that Glassdoor allows you to: [...] Rectify your personal data. [...] Delete your personal data.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There is also this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Right to withdraw consent for certain specific uses of your personal data on Glassdoor. [...] If we have collected and processed your personal information with your consent, then you can withdraw your consent at any time.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Note the loophole there -- "if we collected it <em>with your consent</em>".  They haven't explicitly invoked that, but they could and it's slimy.  (I never gave consent, therefore the dependent clause doesn't apply, they could argue.)</p>

<p>--</p>

<p>Now, on to the email discussion I had with, through escalations, three people over the course of six days.</p>

<p>First, they said that they are a "verified network" and "we require all users to verify their identity before giving them full access to our platform".  Which parts constitute "full access" were not specified; they seem to mean FishBowl, a Blind-inspired social-media thing they're now doing.  I don't care about that.</p>

<p>This requirement wasn't in place when I created the account -- demonstrably, as I was never required to provide a name.  Sometime since then they changed the rules and my profile was sitting there with a null required field, I guess, until some employee noticed and <em>edited it</em>.  I didn't find a notice of this changed requirement in my saved email, though it's possible I missed it or it got caught in a spam trap or something whenever it happened.  I have no idea how long they've required that.</p>

<p>I replied to that message saying, in part, that I withdraw consent for them to store my name, in accordance with their data policy that they had helpfully provided me a link to.  (Wasn't going to quibble over "withdraw" at that point.  I thought this would be straightforward.  How wrong I was.)</p>

<p>I got a reply from "lead, content and community team" -- I'm eliding employee names in this public post because I have more scruples than they do -- who informed me that though they were "required" to add my name to my profile, this would not affect the anonymous reviews I had posted in the past.  Well I would hope not!  But still, I said, them storing my name along with that data puts me at risk.  I pointed out that we've seen ample evidence that anybody with a juicy online database can be hacked, and the mere presence of that involuntary data was a problem.</p>

<p>The next reply contained this plot twist:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>So all users will now receive a Fishbowl account once they login to Glassdoor. Yours has already been created. All you need to do is download the Fishbowl app and login with either a social connection, your work email, or phone number to gain access to your account.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Say what now?  You created and stored my personal information in a <em>second account</em>, and I can only get access to delete it by giving up even more information?  Um, no.  I guess that unsolicited account will just sit there.</p>

<p>(I asked where this was disclosed and was told that would be forthcoming. !!!)</p>

<p>This message went on to tell me that it was "not possible" to edit my name and if I want it gone, my only option is to delete my account.  I responded that I planned to do that after I get my data dump, and in the meantime can they remove or anonymize my name -- reset to last week's level of privacy?  It obviously <em>is</em> possible for them to edit that field because <em>they did</em>.  Users, however, cannot edit it, so I can't fix it myself.</p>

<p>The reply came from "manager, content and community team":</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I stand behind the decision that your name has to be placed on your profile and it cannot be reverted or nullified/anonymized from the platform. I am sorry that we disagree on this issue. We treat all users equally when it comes to what is eligible to be placed on the profile and what is not, but we know that there are times our users, such as yourself, may not always agree with us.</p>
  
  <p>If you are not willing to allow your name on your profile, you will again need to complete Data erasure once you are able to. However, we cannot remove this for you or make the changes you wish to see for your name.</p>
  
  <p>This is my final determination. I, as well as multiple members of my team, have reviewed your request several times, and I am considering this matter closed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You heard it from the manager of Glassdoor's community team: they treat all users equally badly.  Soon my account will be gone.  If you have one, you might consider doing the same.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p>Engineers are hopeful that the veteran spacecraft Voyager 1 might have turned a corner after spending the last three months spouting gibberish at controllers.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://blogs.nasa.gov/sunspot/2024/03/13/nasa-engineers-make-progress-toward-understanding-voyager-1-issue/">On March 1</a>, the Voyager team sent a command, dubbed a "poke," to get the probe's Flight Data System (FDS) to try some other sequences in its software in the hope of circumventing whatever had become corrupted.</p>
<p>Readers of a certain vintage will doubtless have memories of <code>poke</code> sheets for various 1980s games. Not that this hack ever used a <code>poke</code> to get <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://skoolkit.ca/disassemblies/jet_set_willy/reference/pokes.html">infinite lives in Jet Set Willy</a>, of course.</p>

    

<p>While Voyager 1's lifespan is not infinite, it has endured far longer than anticipated and might be about to dodge yet another bullet. On March 3, the mission team saw something different in the stream of data returned from the spacecraft, which had been unreadable since December.</p>

        


        

<p>An engineer with the Deep Space Network (DSN) was able to decode it, and by March 10, the team determined that it contained a complete memory dump from the FDS.</p>
<p>The FDS memory read-out contains its code, variables, and science and engineering data for downlink.</p>

        

<p>Prior to NASA's announcement, Dr Suzanne Dodd, project manager for the Voyager Interstellar Mission, said in a <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.pasadenastarnews.com/2024/03/09/jpls-voyager-team-extremely-hopeful-after-ailing-faraway-craft-shows-signs-of-former-self/">Pasadena Star-News report</a> that the data being transmitted from the probe was "not exactly what we would expect, but they do look like something that can show us that the FDS is at least partially working."</p>

Previously, the probe's telemetry modulation unit (TMU) had begun in mid-December <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/12/14/engineers_work_to_fix_voyager/">transmitting</a> a repeating binary pattern as though it was somehow stuck. Engineers reckoned the issue was somewhere within the FDS.</p>
<p>The next step is to study the memory read-out and compare it to one transmitted before the problem arose. A solution to the issue could then be devised.</p>
<p>One of the original Voyager scientists, Garry Hunt, told <em>The Register</em> that engineers at JPL were determined to get communications with the stricken probe working again: "This requires both skills and patience with the long time between communication instructions and response."</p>
<p>The time lag is a problem. A command from Earth takes 22.5 hours to reach the probe, and the same period is needed again for a response. This means a 45-hour wait to see what a given command might have done.</p>

        

<p>The availability of skills is also an issue. Many of the engineers who worked on the project - Voyager 1 launched in 1977 - are no longer around, and the team that remains is faced with trawling through reams of decades-old documents to deal with unanticipated issues arising today. ®</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article> <article> <p>A few weeks ago, my friend <a href="https://ben.page/">Ben</a> and I won <a href="https://jumbohack.vercel.app/">JumboHack</a>, a hackathon at Tufts University. <a href="https://devpost.com/software/meal-plan-wrapped">Our entry</a> generates a Spotify Wrapped-like summary of students’ dining habits by scraping Tufts’ meal plan portal. Through some <a href="https://ben.page/wrapped">clever promotion</a> on Ben’s part, we managed to get hundreds of students to use it in just a couple of days.

<p>Tufts, like Brown and many other colleges, uses a piece of software (protected under an <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US6963857B1/">expired patent</a> that’s older than both of us) from a company called Atrium. Their marketing claims, in contrast to “legacy” systems, that it will “delight” users. As we will see, the irony of claiming Atrium’s software isn’t “legacy” is just too good.</p>
<p>Tufts calls their installation “JumboCash” and it can be accessed at <code>www.jumbocash.net</code>. (Don’t forget the <code>www.</code>—it won’t resolve without it.) However, the site that is ultimately loaded is determined by the <code>cid</code> (campus/college/customer ID?) parameter. Here’s Brown’s portal loaded through Tufts’ domain: <a href="https://www.jumbocash.net/index.php?cid=248"><code>www.jumbocash.net/index.php?cid=248</code></a>. You can even use the raw IP: <a href="http://3.131.28.213/index.php?cid=248"><code>3.131.28.213/index.php?cid=248</code></a> in all its <code>http://</code> glory.</p>
<figure><img src="https://tuftsesociety.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/tufts-university.jpg" alt="Bonus web development crime: Just as I've done here, the header of Tufts' JumboCash portal is hotlinked from the WordPress.com site of a long-deceased student organization"><figcaption>Bonus web development crime: Just as I've done here, the header of Tufts' JumboCash portal is hotlinked from the WordPress.com site of a long-deceased student organization</figcaption></figure>
<p>The portal is really a wrapper around the reanimated corpse of much older software, its rotting flesh visible through nonsensical decisions and the occasional XML response.</p>
<p>The first thing Ben and I noticed when logging into the JumboCash portal is that the session key is stored as a URL parameter, just like the <code>cid</code>.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>https://www.jumbocash.net/index.php?skey=20613b5ef40f04e15ecc5d5f56513b92&amp;cid=233</span></span></code></pre>
<p>While a cookie is set, it is ignored. You can copy the URL into a private browsing window (or change the domain to another school’s) and it will work just fine; remove the <code>skey</code> parameter and it won’t. Change to another IP address, and it…breaks? Clearly some attempt at security was made, and it feels a bit too complex to be the result of purely ignorance.</p>
<h2 id="guest-access">Guest access</h2>
<p>Because we can’t instruct students to copy-and-paste the URL (and thus their session key), we needed another way to access students’ transaction history. We turned our attention to JumboCash’s guest access feature.</p>
<p>Presumably intended for parents to reload their children’s accounts, it allows students to given an email address access and choose from a deceptively fine-grained set of permissions. I say “deceptively” because guests can change their own permissions and even add other guests. “Disabling” a guest’s access doesn’t actually restrict any features, and guests can re-enable themselves.</p>
<img src="https://jero.zone/_astro/add-guest.CRsawLLW_15bnN7.webp" alt="" width="2664" height="2016" loading="lazy" decoding="async">
<p>Adding a new guest sends them an email with a password. We purchased the excellent domain <code>jumbo.cash</code> and had students add <code><a href="https://jero.zone/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="117664746265517b647c737e3f72706279">[email&nbsp;protected]</a></code> to their accounts. We intercepted the emails with Postmark and pulled out the password, running a job to log in and scrape the requisite information.</p>
<figure><img src="https://jero.zone/_astro/email.CY2KmnK-_wyoPW.webp" alt="The email from JumboCash is pretty much the same" width="1928" height="830" loading="lazy" decoding="async"><figcaption>The email from JumboCash is pretty much the same</figcaption></figure>
<p>When it came to scraping the transaction history itself, we finally caught a small break: the portal allowed CSV export, making our job a bit easier. However, an HTML table, which is essentially XML, wouldn’t have been much trouble.</p>
<h2 id="the-final-hurdle">The final hurdle</h2>
<p>At the time, we decided adding a guest to Atrium’s “delightful” portal was already enough friction and decided not to ask students for their email. In hindsight, we should have collected them at the beginning and given students a custom <code>@jumbo.cash</code> email address to keep things straight.</p>
<p>To achieve this ✨magical✨ experience, we needed to figure out students’ email addresses from their name, since that’s all the portal seems to have. After an unsuccessful attempt at scraping Tufts’ Outlook directory, we took a closer look at the <a href="https://directory.tufts.edu/">public directory</a>, which includes the names and emails of every student. Popping the hood, it makes a nice little request to a JSON API, which appears to be a wrapper around one or more LDAP directories. But unfortunately, it’s not allowed to be that easy.</p>
<p>The JumboCash portal displays students’ legal first and last names (e.g. Benjamin not Ben). The directory, on the other hand, can only be searched by students’ preferred names. Though not displayed in the interface, its API does return their legal names in <code>Lastname, Firstname M.</code> format.</p>
<p>Our first idea was to search the directory by last name and lazily use the PHP standard library’s <a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.levenshtein.php">levenshtein() function</a> to find the closest match. However, this doesn’t work well with common or short last names—for example, “Li” is not only common but is included in lots of names like Julian and Colin and returns dozens of matches. Since the directory’s pagination was broken (while I have a theory as to why, it looks like it’s already been fixed), we couldn’t page through to find an exact match. Our gross solution was to try a bunch of formats: <code>Lastname</code>, <code>F. Lastname</code>, etc. and pick the closest name. This works…enough of the time.</p>
<h2 id="logging-in">Logging in</h2>
<p>Actually logging into JumboCash required two HTTP requests and four hours of reverse engineering. I spent so long on it that Ben, who had already scraped JumboCash for <a href="https://ben.page/swipes">a previous project</a>, started working on a Puppeteer solution in parallel.</p>
<p>But first, here’s how authentication actually works. A <code>POST</code> request is sent to <code>/login.php</code> with a <code>username</code> and <code>loginphrase</code>, which creates a session key. Then, second, a <code>GET</code> request to the same page “activates” the token. Failing to do this second request puts the UI into a weird “half-logged-in” state.</p>
<p>The first request returns, instead of a <code>Location</code> header, a snippet of JavaScript (<code>&lt;script type='JavaScript'&gt;</code> to be exact) to rediect to another page. The second page (also <code>/login.php</code>, just with some URL parameters) contains a loader and some nasty JavaScript.</p>

<p>While abnormal, this dance wouldn’t have taken the hours it did had one of our tools not <em>lied</em> to us. When using HTTPie to poke around the site, it would render the HTML returned by the first <code>POST</code> request, including executing the JavaScript it contained. However, while HTTPie’s webview still made the request (as a normal browser, without any of our headers), it didn’t show that it had.</p>
<p>We were baffled as to why session keys generated with requests from HTTPie worked, but those using even the cURL code it generated did not. As it turned out, HTTPie was secretly making the second “activation” request. HTTPie’s webview should probably not execute JavaScript, especially without showing the result. (It would also be nice if the webview stayed disabled instead of turning itself back on after every request.)</p>
<p>The JavaScript on the intermediary “loading” screen very responsibly checks if the browser supports the newfangled <code>XMLHttpRequest</code> API before polling an XML API for the status of the <code>skey</code>. While the concatenation in this script (included below) is out of control, I was luckily unable to find an XSS. That would have been quite fun, given the number of <code>.edu</code> domains this software runs on.</p>

<p>With all the reverse-engineering out of the way, we had a lot of fun designing the actual product. We went for a vivid and bold design, similar to Spotify Wrapped. Given how much time we spent on everything else (and a solid 8 hours of sleep!), I think it turned out alright.</p>
<figure><img src="https://jero.zone/_astro/screenshots.CFONoMTY_5THbR.webp" alt="The app&amp;#x27;s interface behaved like Instagram Stories" width="1494" height="939" loading="lazy" decoding="async"><figcaption>The app's interface behaved like Instagram Stories</figcaption></figure>
<p>We put posters up around campus and, as Ben details in <a href="https://ben.page/wrapped">his post</a>, made a few anonymous posts on Sidechat pretending to be users. They went (relatively) viral, and because we’d conspicuously included the URL on every slide, hundreds of students flocked to try it for themselves.</p>
<p>Overall, JumboHack was a lot of fun! Taking the train down from Providence (<a href="https://www.mbta.com/fares/commuter-rail-weekends">for just 10 bucks!</a>), hanging out with Ben, and taking home some AirPods was a great way to spend my Presidents’ Day weekend.</p>

<article id="post-1758">
	<!-- .entry-header -->

	<div>
		<p>My post a couple of months ago about the long lunch break that French kids get (between one and a half and two hours) elicited a lot of great responses. By Ministry of Education regulation, French children spend a minimum of 30 minutes eating (it’s often more), and then usually have at least an hour to play, if not more. Read the original post <a href="http://wp.me/p2fsgD-8q">here</a>.</p>
<p>Now that we’re back in Vancouver, my daughter’s lunch period is one hour long, including 10 minutes to eat. Yep, 10 minutes (from 12:00 to 12:10 in the school schedule, to be precise). Call me crazy, but I don’t think this is enough time.</p>
<p>Learning doesn’t stop in the lunchroom, in my opinion. If we are giving our children a slow lunch break, we are teaching them that food is an inconvenience, and eating is an interruption in the day. We encourage them to gobble their food, when the research shows that eating more slowly is healthier. In fact, the French spend longer eating, but eat less–in part because that ‘fullness feeling’  (satiety signal) needs about 20 minutes to get from your stomach to your brain. But the French also spend longer eating because they believe that it’s important to teach kids to eat well – it’s a life skill, like reading.</p>
<p>They also believe that eating is a wonderful social time which kids can enjoy (and that eating together creates a ‘positive peer pressure’ environment in which kids are more likely to eat well, and try new foods). Here’s a lovely quote from the school website in the town of Versailles (yes, home of the castle):</p>
<p><em>“Mealtime is a particularly important moment in a child’s day. Our responsibility is to provide children with healthy, balanced meals; to develop their sense of taste; to help children, complementing what they learn at home, to make good food choices without being influenced by trends, media, and marketing; and to teach them the relationship between eating habits and health. But above all else, we aim to enable children to spend joyful, convivial moments together, to learn a ‘savoir-vivre’ (which roughly translates as ‘know-how about life’, or ‘life skill’), to make time for communication, social exchange, and learning about society’s rules–so that they can socialize and cultivate friendships.”<br>
</em></p>
<p>Food for thought.</p>
<p>After chatting with Amber Strocel, she posted a <a href="http://www.strocel.com/short-school-lunch-periods/#comment-120911">thoughtful discussion of school lunches</a> on her blog. She included some great ideas and examples of strategies that schools are using. Should we put playtime before lunchtime, so kids aren’t rushing out the door to the playground? Should we extend the lunch hour, or count part of the lunch break as instructional time for teachers? Check out her blog for some great ideas about what we might be doing differently. My next blog post will explore what we might do about this, focusing on what the Slow Food movement and the school reform movements might learn from one another.</p>
<p>I’d also love to hear your thoughts, and hopefully inspiring examples about what innovative things schools are doing to make that kids are learning <em>how</em> to eat well, as well as what to eat.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="storywrap-433833">


<h3>from the <i>fix-your-own-shit</i> dept</h3>

<p>Oregon has officially become the seventh state (behind New York, California, Massachusetts, Colorado, Maine, and Minnesota) to <a href="https://www.oregonlive.com/silicon-forest/2024/03/oregon-passes-expansive-right-to-repair-law-defying-tech-industry-concerns.html#:~:text=Oregon%20became%20the%20fourth%20state,required%20to%20repair%20their%20gadgets.">pass “right to repair” legislation</a>, making it easier and more affordable for consumers to independently repair their own electronics. </p>
<p>The <a href="https://olis.oregonlegislature.gov/liz/2024R1/Measures/Overview/SB1596">bill</a>, which passed the Oregon Senate last month 25-5 and the House on Monday 42-13, is a bit more robust than the versions passed in earlier states. Among other things, the bill requires that device manufacturers make parts, tools and repair manuals available to consumers and third-party repair shops on “fair and reasonable terms.”</p>
<p>But it also takes aim at “<a href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/69320/how-parts-pairing-kills-independent-repair">parts pairing</a>,” or the practice of preventing you from replacing device parts without the approval of a company or its restrictive software. Apple, which <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2023/09/21/despite-some-progress-ifixit-says-apples-dedication-to-right-to-repair-still-sucks/">routinely uses this practice to try and monopolize repair</a>, lobbied <a href="https://www.404media.co/apple-is-lobbying-against-right-to-repair-again/">extensively against the Oregon bill</a>. As usual, under the (false) claim that eliminating parts pairing would put public safety and security at risk:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“We remain very concerned about the risk to consumers imposed by the broad parts-pairing restrictions in this bill,” John Perry, principal secure repair architect for Apple, said at a legislative hearing last month.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In reality, Apple is concerned that the crackdown on “parts pairing” will further erode the company’s lucrative efforts to monopolize repair and slow down the rate of shiny new phone sales. Apple has generally tried to pretend than its done a <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2023/11/16/apples-180-on-right-to-repair-was-more-of-a-90-degree-bend/">complete 180 on right to repair</a>, when it’s generally been more of a 40 degree turn toward <em>slightly</em> more reasonable policies. </p>
<p>Interestingly, Google supported Oregon’s legislation, and has more genuinely been <a href="https://www.404media.co/youtube-commenters-and-the-grassroots-movement-pushed-google-to-support-right-to-repair/">migrating away from the practice of parts pairing</a>. Activist and consumer groups like iFixit praised the bill’s passage in a statement:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“I’m beyond proud of my home state for passing the strongest-yet electronics Right to Repair bill,” Kyle Wiens, the CEO of iFixit, said in a statement. “By applying to most products made after 2015, this law will open up repair for the things Oregonians need to get fixed right now. And by limiting the repair-restricting practices of parts pairing, it protects fixing for years to come. We won’t stop fighting until everyone, everywhere has these rights.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Oregon’s bill is notable because it wasn’t aggressively watered down post-passage like some right to repair legislation (<a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2023/02/17/more-details-on-how-tech-lobbyists-lobotomized-nys-right-to-repair-law-with-governor-kathy-hochuls-help/">See: New York</a>). It’s expected the bill will face industry lawsuits. Still, right to reform remains one reform bright spot in a country where consumer protection has been on the chopping block for the better part of the last quarter century. </p>

        <p><em>(The following is a post by Helen Fedor, Reference Specialist in the European Division.)</em></p>
<p>The most famous work by Czech writer Jaroslav Hašek (1883-1923), and probably the best known work of Czech literature, is “Osudy dobrého vojáka Švejka za světové války” (The adventures of the good soldier Švejk during the world war), or as it is known in its English translation, “The Good Soldier Švejk.” The most translated Czech novel—read in some 60 languages—it satirizes bureaucracy, the military, and war.</p>

Švejk rubs ointment into his knee while the cleaning lady tells him of the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand—an event that triggered World War I and brought about Švejk’s many adventures.</figcaption></figure>
<p>Set in Austria-Hungary, the book opens with the 1914 news that Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria (1863-1914) has been assassinated in Sarajevo, an event that would trigger World War I. Josef Švejk, the antihero, enlists in the army and spends the war blundering from one ludicrous adventure to another. He seems earnest in his desire to carry out his orders, yet takes them to extremes and frustrates his superiors. For example, when Švejk is assigned to the barracks in České Budějovice (in southern Bohemia) as a prelude to going to the front, he manages to miss all the trains heading there. In his ‘zeal’ to reach the barracks and join the rest of his battalion, Švejk meanders all over southern Bohemia, vainly searching for České Budějovice, gets arrested as a suspected spy and deserter, and is escorted to the barracks.</p>
<p>Švejk bears more than a passing resemblance to the author, Hašek, who loved practical jokes, had a checkered career, and was himself drafted into the Austro-Hungarian army. Hašek’s pretended suicide attempt (by jumping off Charles Bridge into the Vltava River in Prague) ended with the police taking him to a mental institution. Also, during elections to the Austro-Hungarian parliament, Hašek ran for office as a member of his own newly founded Party of Moderate and Peaceful Progress Within the Limits of the Law. He eventually joined the anarchist movement and was arrested and imprisoned more than once.</p>

Synek, 1948-49. Illustration by Josef Lada. Two soldiers escorted Švejk to the home of the chaplain for “spiritual consolation” before his hanging. By the time Švejk and his escorts got there, the soldiers were drunk, and Švejk ended up guarding them while the chaplain (himself drunk) unsuccessfully tried to telephone the barracks, mistaking a coat rack for his nonexistent telephone.</figcaption></figure>
<p>Hašek planned to write the Švejk story in six parts. The first three were published 1921-23, but Hašek died in 1923, while working on part four. After his death, his publisher asked journalist and humorist Karel Vaněk to complete the work. Vaněk finished part four and later also wrote about Švejk’s adventures in Russian captivity and during the Russian Revolution.</p>
<p>The most famous illustrator of Švejk’s adventures was Josef Lada. His classic illustrations are instantly recognizable and have come to define Švejk, even though Hašek apparently never saw Lada’s drawings. A more recent illustrator is the delightful Petr Urban whose artwork is shown here.</p>
<p>Two other sequels to the Švejk story were set in the Nazi-controlled Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia (1939-45); both were written in the 1940s by anonymous authors. The first was the English-language “Švejk in the Protectorate,” published in London, 1942, by the exile publishing house The Czechoslovak. This small booklet begins with an account of the 1939 assassination attempt on Hitler: “So they’ve nearly killed our Adolf…,” echoing the opening words of Hašek’s novel. The preface of this work describes it as “a cruel and bitter satire where laughter is mingled with the fighting spirit of revenge and hatred.”</p>

<p>The other work, “Loyální občan Josef Švejk v protektoráte Čechy a Morava” (Loyal citizen Josef Švejk in the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia), was published in Prague by the unknown ‘Medius,’ in 1948. Only part one of this work was ever issued. The Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia was established on March 16, 1939, after Germany had occupied Czechoslovakia. Germany had already annexed the Sudetenland, composed of territory in the northern, southern, and western parts of the Czech Lands (Bohemia and Moravia), in October 1938; an independent Slovak Republic had been established on March 14, 1939.</p>
<p>The first English translation of Švejk was published by Paul Selver in 1930, but it was an abridged version that reduced the book to less than two-thirds of the original. Perhaps the best known English-language translation of Hašek’s book is &nbsp;by Cecil Parrott, originally published in 1973. His translation used Lada’s original drawings, and included maps showing Švejk’s travels.</p>

<p>The very first translation of Hašek’s book however, was into German, by Grete Reiner, in 1926. “Die Abenteuer des braven Soldaten Schwejk während des Weltkrieges” (The adventures of the good soldier Švejk during the world war) was published in Prague, which had a large German-speaking population.</p>
<p>Ms. Reiner, a native of Prague who was later killed at Auschwitz, was the executive editor of the anti-fascist magazine, “Deutsche Volkszeitung,” (German’s people daily ), and was largely responsible for spreading Švejk’s fame throughout Europe. Her translation, burned by the Nazis in 1933, was said to be one of playwright Bertolt Brecht’s favorite books. In 1927, Brecht himself wrote a stage adaptation based on the first three parts of the Švejk story. The songs for this production were written by Hanns Eisler, an Austrian who later composed the national anthem of the German Democratic Republic (East Germany).</p>

<p>Since then, Švejk has inspired further plays, films, comic books, several restaurants (in Prague, throughout the Czech Republic, and abroad), statues, an opera, TV adaptations, a BBC radio broadcast, an animated film, and books such as Joseph Heller’s “Catch-22.” No doubt Švejk will continue to inspire future generations.</p>

          <h3 id="context">Context</h3>

          <p>
            I’ve had the curiosity to explore radio communication protocols for
            a few years now, ever since I’ve started fiddling around with an
            RTL-SDR dongle. I always had the goal of figuring out how data is
            transmitted in remote controls (car key fobs particularly), trying
            replay attacks, and other possible attack vectors.
          </p>

          <p>
            Despite capturing some car key fob signals over the years, I haven’t
            had the chance of doing meaningful analysis on them, and that’s
            mainly due to the limited access I had to cars I could test on.
          </p>

          <p>
            This blog post aims to bring the uninitiated through my journey of
            having successfully reverse engineered and replayed a car’s key fob
            signal last year, starting from the very basic concepts of radio
            frequency and going all the way through my entire thought process
            while I was working on this project.
          </p>

          <p>
            Another goal I guess is to also prove that most cars are definitely
            not that easy to steal using replay attacks (unless it’s a
            <a href="https://rollingpwn.github.io/rolling-pwn/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Honda</a>, lol), despite Canada’s recent ban of the Flipper Zero, and them
            claiming the risk warrants the ban of a device made of very cheap
            and accessible wireless modules.
          </p>

          <h3 id="hardware-used">Hardware used</h3>

          <h4 id="rtl-sdr">RTL-SDR</h4>

          <p>
            I’ve had my first dive into the world of radio frequency back in
            2016 when I learned that a very cheap (~$10) terrestrial TV/radio
            USB dongle can easily be turned into a multi-purpose RF receiver to
            inspect and decode pretty much anything happening in the range of 24
            to 1750 MHz - this device is widely known as ‘RTL-SDR’:
          </p>

          <p><img src="https://i.0x44.cc/b/rtl-sdr.png" alt=""></p>

          <p>
            The secret why this cheap device is very powerful, is the simple
            fact that it uses a chip which allows the use of
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software-defined_radio" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">SDR (software defined radio)</a>. It turns out that this chip (RTL2832U) allowed skipping the
            signal processing that usually happens on the hardware-level which
            converts the raw signal into ‘meaningful’ data to be used by the
            host device (a TV/radio feed in the case of this device).
          </p>

          <p>
            By having direct access to the raw I/Q data, we can receive,
            visualize and save pretty much any signal in raw format, without
            needing to know the specifics of the RF configuration used to
            transmit (modulation, bandwidth, data rate, etc.), since we can
            analyze/process the raw data ourselves. This effectively gives us a
            window to scan for virtually any activity on the radio spectrum
            under the 1.7 GHz frequency.
          </p>

          <h4 id="flipper-zero">Flipper Zero</h4>

          <p>
            The Flipper Zero is an electronic gadget which attracted a lot of
            attention lately for being a hacker/troll’s ultimate Swiss knife,
            since it hosts a bunch of wireless hardware modules that allow
            ‘interacting with’ everyday electronics and consumer appliances.
          </p>

          <p><img src="https://i.0x44.cc/b/flipper-zero.jpg" alt=""></p>

          <p>
            The module that’s interesting to us in the Flipper is the Sub-GHz
            one, which is essentially a
            <a href="https://www.ti.com/product/CC1101" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">CC1101</a>
            chip that supports frequencies that are typically used in wireless
            consumer devices, and that are under 1 GHz, hence the name of the
            module.
          </p>

          <p>
            It’s important to note, however, that one could just buy the CC1101
            module separately ($5+) and make it work with an Arduino/Raspberry
            Pi or simply a USB-to-TTL adapter, but the Flipper is definitely
            cooler and more practical. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
          </p>

          <h4 id="cc1101-vs-rtl2832u">CC1101 vs RTL2832U</h4>

          <p>
            The CC1101 chip in the Flipper Zero, unlike the RTL2832U chip that’s
            on the RTL-SDR, is actually a transceiver module (supports sending
            and receiving), which means the Flipper Zero is the device we’ll be
            using to send signals.
          </p>

          <p>
            However, the CC1101 chip doesn’t support SDR, which means that it
            would only send back data that it had completely processed. In other
            terms, the CC1101 will only be useful to us if we set the right RF
            configuration of the transmitted signal.
          </p>

          <h3 id="radio-frequency-signal-basics-oversimplified">
            Radio frequency signal basics (<em>oversimplified</em>)
          </h3>

          <p>
            Now that we know a bit about the hardware we’ll be using, let’s go
            through some minimum basic concepts that are needed to tackle this
            subject.
          </p>

          <h4 id="intro">Intro</h4>

          <p>
            Radio frequency transmissions use radio waves, which are a type of
            electromagnetic radiation, in order to send signals.
          </p>

          <p>
            These waves are of a typically higher frequency than the original
            signal we’re transmitting and this is to ensure reliability in
            sending data, since signals can have varying characteristics that
            make sending them as radio waves impractical and susceptible to
            interference and weak travel distance.
          </p>

          <p>
            These waves are called carrier waves, since they are essentially
            modified to carry the original signal reliably through the air (more
            on this below).
          </p>

          <p>
            Let’s take a look at <em>some</em> of the basic information needed
            to send/receive a radio signal:
          </p>

          <h4 id="frequency">Frequency</h4>

          <p>
            This one is self-explanatory, it’s the number of times a second a
            carrier wave occurs. Frequency affects the wavelength (the higher
            the frequency the shorter the waves). This parameter is also
            typically used to define the communication channel.
          </p>

          <h4 id="modulation">Modulation</h4>

          <p>
            This refers to the way a signal is represented in the radio waves.
            The two most common modulation types, which I’m sure most people
            already know of, are:
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>AM</strong> (<em>amplitude</em> modulation) and
            <strong>FM</strong> (<em>frequency</em> modulation).
          </p>

          <p>
            The difference between these is simply the fact that for AM, the
            signal is modulated (encoded) in <em>amplitude</em> (or strength),
            which roughly means that the <em>change</em> in signal
            <em>strength</em> on the carrier waves is how the data is
            represented.
          </p>

          <p>
            For FM, as one can guess, the data is rather modulated in
            <em>frequency</em>. So, changes in the frequency of the waves are
            used here to determine the data.
          </p>

          <p>
            This is well visualized in this animation I found on Wikipedia (the
            ‘signal’ graph represents the data we’re trying to transmit):
          </p>

          <p>
            <img src="https://i.0x44.cc/b/radio-fm-vs-am-anim.gif" alt="">
          </p>

          <p>
            Modulations can also have different subtypes and characteristics
            which we’ll talk about later on.
          </p>

          <h4 id="bandwidth">Bandwidth</h4>

          <p>
            This refers to the range of frequencies occupied by a modulated RF
            signal, or in other words, the difference between the highest and
            the lowest frequency a modulated signal can have. This essentially
            dictates the amount of data a signal can carry.
          </p>

          <p>
            Since the rest of the radio characteristics are not terribly
            important for us to know at this stage, let’s move on to the fun
            stuff!
          </p>

          <h3 id="visual-analysis">Visual analysis</h3>

          <h4 id="sdr">SDR#</h4>

          <p>
            <a href="https://airspy.com/download/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">SDR#</a>
            is a free, intuitive, computer-based DSP (Digital Signal Processing)
            application for SDR written in C# with a focus on performance. It
            allows visualizing the radio spectrum in real time, and supports the
            demodulation of some common modulations. It also supports
            third-party plugins for custom modulations and integrations.
          </p>

          <p>
            We’ll be using this software for our signal discovery and initial
            analysis phase.
          </p>

          <p>
            By tuning into the 433.92 MHz frequency with our RTL-SDR dongle
            plugged in (using the WinUSB driver instead of the stock DVB-T one),
            we can watch the activity of most remote controls in close proximity
            (433.92 MHz being the standard unregulated frequency in the EU and
            other neighboring countries, including Morocco, where I live).
          </p>

          <p>
            On each car key fob button press we instantly notice that there’s 3
            successive short bursts generated, as can be seen on the waterfall
            view under the spectrum visualizer:
          </p>

              signal intensity)</small>
          </p>

          <p>
            We can also notice that the signal has two major ‘peaks’ on both
            sides of the 433.92&nbsp;MHz frequency (the red line in the middle is the
            exact tuning frequency).
          </p>

          <p>
            Doing some research on common modulation schemes, we come across
            2-FSK that sounds interesting:
          </p>

          <h4 id="2-fsk">2-FSK</h4>

          <p>
            FSK stands for Frequency-Shift Keying, which is a frequency
            modulation scheme in which data is encoded on a carrier signal by
            periodically shifting the frequency of the carrier between several
            discrete frequencies.
          </p>

          <p>
            Pretty straightforward so far, sounds like we’re dealing with FM
            here.
          </p>

          <p>
            The interesting part is the ‘2’ however, which here stands for the
            number of channels used in the encoding. So, we’re actually encoding
            binary data in two separate frequencies here, one for the
            <strong>0</strong> and the other for the <strong>1</strong>, which
            would explain the two peaks we’re noticing.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong><em>Note:</em></strong> One might wonder what the other
            smaller ‘peaks’ are in that screen capture - those are basically
            unwanted frequencies that are generated accidentally by the emitter
            chip, due to the cheap nature of the hardware, and due to the very
            close proximity of the remote and the antenna. So, it’s just a bunch
            of ‘noise’ that we can safely ignore.
          </p>

          <h3 id="practical-analysis">Practical analysis</h3>

          <p>
            Now that we checked what the signal looks like visually, let’s
            explore how we can work on analyzing it in order to read the bits
            from the RF waves in hopes to spot some sort of
            structure/consistency.
          </p>

          <h4 id="universal-radio-hacker">Universal Radio Hacker</h4>

          <p>
            As the README of its repository states, the
            <a href="https://github.com/jopohl/urh" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Universal Radio Hacker (URH)</a>
            is a complete open-source suite for wireless protocol investigation
            with native support for many common SDRs. URH allows easy
            demodulation of signals combined with an automatic detection of
            modulation parameters making it a breeze to identify the bits and
            bytes that fly over the air.
          </p>

          <p>
            This is precisely the software we need to decode radio waves into
            bits.
          </p>

          <p>
            As we open URH, we’re invited to either open a file or record
            directly from a device.
          </p>

          <p>
            Before recording, we have to select the source device, and set some
            basic radio parameters (I actually only made sure to put the right
            frequency and left everything else as default):
          </p>

          <p>
            <img src="https://i.0x44.cc/b/urh-record-dialog-rtlsdr.png" alt="">
          </p>

          <p>
            After recording a signal, URH will try to autodetect the right
            configuration to use when decoding the radio waves.
          </p>

          <p>
            On my initial recordings, I wasn’t able to get URH to find the right
            parameters for me, which gave me wrong results. I have however later
            figured out that recording multiple repetitive signals in one go
            increases the chance that URH will figure out the right
            configuration, which turned out to be in my case: 50 samples/symbol,
            FSK.
          </p>

          <p>
            <img src="https://i.0x44.cc/b/urh-signal-interpretation.png" alt="">
          </p>

          <p>
            Zooming in on one of the signals, we notice the 3 bursts we
            identified on SDR# (the second of which is made of 3 separate ones -
            so we have 5 sections to analyze now):
          </p>

          <p><img src="https://i.0x44.cc/b/urh-signal-zoom-in.png" alt=""></p>

          <p>
            For each of these sections, a bit sequence is automatically
            extracted, which we can also convert to hex for a better
            visualization:
          </p>

          <p>
            <img src="https://i.0x44.cc/b/urh-signal-zoom-in-hex.png" alt="">
          </p>

          <p>
            We can already notice a lot of consistency and repeating patterns in
            the bytes, which is a sign that we’re on the right path.
          </p>

          <p>
            However, to my eyes, we’re still missing something here, because we
            notice the same 5&nbsp;hex digits being repeated, with a lot of 0x55
            bytes (01010101) also, which is pretty intriguing.
          </p>

          <p>
            Going over to the next tab labeled ‘Analysis’, we can see the bytes
            we’ve just extracted from each burst, each represented in a line,
            and there’s a decoding option that shows up with a bunch of curious
            algorithms:
          </p>

          <p>
            <img src="https://i.0x44.cc/b/urh-analysis-decoding-options.png" alt="">
          </p>

          <p>
            By brute forcing my way and trying them consecutively, I noticed
            that one of them (Manchester II) converted all the 0x55 bytes to
            null ones, and without producing any decoding errors:
          </p>

          <p>
            <img src="https://i.0x44.cc/b/urh-manchester-decoded.png" alt="">
          </p>

          <p>These bytes look more legit now.</p>

          <h5 id="manchester-encoding">Manchester encoding</h5>

          <p>
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_code" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Manchester</a>
            is a very simple digital modulation scheme that ensures that the
            signal never remains at logic low or logic high for an extended
            period of time, and also converts the data signal into a
            data-plus-synchronization signal (for
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clock_recovery" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">clock recovery</a>).
          </p>

          <p>
            These characteristics are very useful when sending digital data over
            analog mediums that tend to be susceptible to noise and
            interference.
          </p>

          <p>
            In Manchester, binary data is encoded in two opposite bits,
            therefore:
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>0</strong> becomes <strong>01</strong> and
            <strong>1</strong> becomes <strong>10</strong> (or the other way
            around, depending on the convention):
          </p>

          <p>
            <img src="https://i.0x44.cc/b/manchester-visualization-wiki.png" alt="">
          </p>

          <p>Let’s go back and continue our investigation.</p>

          <p>
            By doing some manual examination and comparison of the different
            captures, we’re able to note that each button press generates a
            signal with the following characteristics:
          </p>

          <ol>
            <li>
              A <span>long burst</span> with no data
              (decodes to 100 null bytes).
            </li>
            <li>
              3 bursts which look very similar with only 2 bytes partially
              <span>changing</span>.
            </li>
            <li>
              A <span>final burst</span> which is
              shorter but still looks fairly similar to the previous 3 bursts.
            </li>
          </ol>

          <p>
            <img src="https://i.0x44.cc/b/urh-initial-signal-structure-highlight.png" alt="">
          </p>

          <p>
            I decided to look more closely at the 3 bursts (let’s call them
            packets) in the middle since they seem to be the important part of
            the signal, and I was quickly able to spot what seems to be an
            <span>incremental ID</span> which
            increases by 1 on each new signal:
          </p>

          <p>
            <img src="https://i.0x44.cc/b/urh-incremental-id-spotted.png" alt="">
          </p>

          <p>
            To be able to move forward with our analysis, we must learn about a
            very important remote control security mechanism:
          </p>

          <h4 id="rolling-codes">Rolling codes</h4>

          <p>
            A rolling code is used in keyless entry systems to prevent a simple
            form of replay attack, where an eavesdropper records the
            transmission and replays it at a later time to cause the receiver to
            ‘unlock’. Such systems are typical in garage door openers and
            keyless car entry systems. More on
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling_code" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>.
          </p>

          <p>
            The gist of this system is that the key and the car both ‘agree’ on
            a cryptographically secure algorithm in order to generate rolling
            codes that are used to authenticate the remote.
          </p>

          <p>
            These keys are generated and tracked using a <em>counter</em> which
            has to stay in sync between the remote and the car. This ensures
            that the car doesn’t reuse an old key, and that the remote always
            generates fresh keys.
          </p>

          <p>
            An example of a rolling code implementation is pictured below
            <small>(credits:
              <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8P_Wgl89jPU" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">RuhrSec 2017</a>)</small>:
          </p>

          <p>
            <img src="https://i.0x44.cc/b/rolling-code-explanation.png" alt="">
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li><strong>uid</strong>: ID of the car/remote link</li>
            <li>
              <strong>enc<sub>k</sub></strong>: Implementation of the rolling code algorithm
            </li>
            <li><strong>ctr</strong>: The car’s counter</li>
            <li><strong>ctr’</strong>: The remote’s counter</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            The validity window permits the remote to not go out of sync if the
            car doesn’t happen to receive the signal (typically with a max of
            255 out-of-range button presses on most implementations, after which
            the remote has to be manually resynchronized).
          </p>

          <p>Alright, let’s go back to the drawing board.</p>

          <p>
            Since we now know that rolling codes are
            <em>cryptographically</em> secure, it becomes easy for us to spot
            the
            <span>part of the signal</span>
            responsible for this implementation (which would be the one with the
            highest entropy):
          </p>

          <p>
            <img src="https://i.0x44.cc/b/urh-rolling-code-spotted.png" alt="">
          </p>

          <p>
            We can also make the assumption that the
            <span>incremental ID</span> we’ve
            identified earlier is the counter for the rolling code system. As it
            also conveniently sits right next to the code.
          </p>

          <p>
            By comparing lock and unlock signals, I was also able to quickly
            spot <span>the byte</span> responsible for the
            command (8 = unlock, 4 = lock):
          </p>

          <p>
            <img src="https://i.0x44.cc/b/urh-command-byte-spotted.png" alt="">
          </p>

          <p>
            Now all that’s left for us to guess from the signal’s ‘variable
            parts’ are the two <span>red changes</span> we
            marked earlier:
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>1)</strong> For the first one, we notice that the same
            values repeat themselves across the other captured signals.
          </p>

          <p>Converting the 3 values to binary, we notice the following:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>0x6: <strong>01</strong>10</li>
            <li>0xA: <strong>10</strong>10</li>
            <li>0xE: <strong>11</strong>10</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Interesting, looks as if it’s packing some sort of sequence number
            for the packets.
          </p>

          <p>And what if we check the final (4th) packet as well?</p>

          <ul>
            <li>0x13: <strong>100</strong>11</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Yup, our theory seems to check out
            <small>(ignore the lowest bit that changed here)</small>.
          </p>

          <p><strong>2)</strong> Let’s guess the last byte now.</p>

          <p>
            We can notice that this one not only changes for each packet, but it
            does so completely across all signals as well.
          </p>

          <p>
            Seeing that this is the last byte on the packet and that it changes
            pretty randomly, leads me to suspect this being a checksum.
          </p>

          <p>
            One thing we can try doing is a XOR of this byte with the other byte
            we just analyzed, to see if we can end up with a static value (since
            pretty much <em>everything</em> besides these two bytes actually
            stays <em>static</em> when it comes to the 3 rolling code packets).
          </p>

          <p>Let’s try with these two examples:</p>

          <p>
            <img src="https://i.0x44.cc/b/urh-checksum-theory-test.png" alt="">
          </p>

          <p>Example 1:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>0x06 ^ 0xB9 = <strong>0xBF</strong></li>
            <li>0x0A ^ 0xB5 = <strong>0xBF</strong></li>
            <li>0x0E ^ 0xB1 = <strong>0xBF</strong></li>
          </ul>

          <p>Example 2:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>0x06 ^ 0xCC = <strong>0xCA</strong></li>
            <li>0x0A ^ 0xC0 = <strong>0xCA</strong></li>
            <li>0x0E ^ 0xC4 = <strong>0xCA</strong></li>
          </ul>

          <p>Bingo. This is definitely a XOR checksum.</p>

          <p>
            By applying XOR on all the bytes of the packets, we notice that the
            value always ends up being off by 1:
          </p>

          <p><img src="https://i.0x44.cc/b/urh-bad-checksum.png" alt=""></p>

          <p>
            This leads us to conclude that the first 2 bytes of the packet are
            likely excluded from the checksum (which is where the 1 is coming
            from):
          </p>

          <p>
            <img src="https://i.0x44.cc/b/urh-synchronization-bytes.png" alt="">
          </p>

          <p>
            And this actually makes sense, since these bytes would act here as a
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syncword" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">syncword</a>
            to synchronize the receiver and indicate the beginning of the data.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Note:</strong> If you’re wondering about the utility of the
            initial <span>long burst</span> highlighted in
            yellow in the captures - that one serves to basically wake up the
            radio receiver and prepare it to start receiving data (since it goes
            in an idle low power state on inactivity). And if you’re also
            wondering why the remote sends 3 packets with roughly the same data,
            it’s simply to insure some sort of reliability. In case one of the
            packets gets corrupted on the way (which we saw happen on an earlier
            screenshot).
          </p>

          <h4 id="final-result">Final result</h4>

          <p>
            After labeling the rest of the bytes to my best guess, this is the

          <p>Neat. We’ve just reverse engineered a car key fob signal.</p>

          <p>
            Tune in next time when I (hopefully) write about how I integrated
            support for this signal format on the Flipper Zero in order to be
            able to read, re-serialize, and replay it.

          <p>Thanks for reading!</p>

<p><span>Vancouver has long been nicknamed the “city of glass” for its shimmering high-rise skyline. Over the next few years, that skyline will get a very large new addition: Sen</span><span>̓</span><span>áḵw, an 11-tower development that will Tetrize 6,000 apartments onto just over 10 acres of land in the heart of the city. Once complete, this will be the densest neighbourhood in Canada, providing thousands of homes for Vancouverites who have long been squeezed between the country’s priciest real estate and some of its lowest vacancy rates.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Sen</span><span>̓</span><span>áḵw is big, ambitious and undeniably urban—and undeniably Indigenous. It’s being built on reserve land owned by the Squamish First Nation, and it’s spearheaded by the Squamish Nation itself, in partnership with the private real estate developer Westbank. Because the project is on First Nations land, not city land, it’s under Squamish authority, free of Vancouver’s zoning rules. And the Nation has chosen to build bigger, denser and taller than any development on city property would be allowed.</span></p>

<p><span>Predictably, not everyone has been happy about it. Critics have included local planners, politicians and, especially, residents of Kitsilano Point, a rarified beachfront neighbourhood bordering the reserve. And there’s been an extra edge to their critiques that’s gone beyond standard-issue NIMBYism about too-tall buildings and preserving neighbourhood character. There’s also been a persistent sense of disbelief that Indigenous people could be responsible for this futuristic version of urban living. In 2022, Gordon Price, a prominent Vancouver urban planner and a former city councillor, told Gitxsan reporter Angela Sterritt, “When you’re building 30, 40-storey high rises out of concrete, there’s a big gap between that and an Indigenous way of building.”&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>The subtext is as unmissable as a skyscraper: Indigenous culture and urban life—let alone urban development—don’t mix. That response isn’t confined to Sen</span><span>̓</span><span>áḵw, either. On Vancouver’s west side, the Musqueam, Squamish and Tsleil-Waututh Nations—through a joint partnership called MST Development Corp.—are planning a 12-tower development called the Heather Lands. In 2022, city councillor Colleen Hardwick said of that project, “How do you reconcile Indigenous ways of being with 18-storey high-rises?” (Hardwick, it goes without saying, is not Indigenous.) MST is also planning an even bigger development, called Iy</span><span>̓</span><span>álmexw in the Squamish language and ʔəy</span><span>̓</span><span>alməx</span><span>ʷ</span><span> in Halkomelem. Better known as Jericho Lands, it will include 13,000 new homes on a 90-acre site. At a city council meeting this January, a stream of non-Indigenous residents turned up to oppose it. One woman speculated that the late Tsleil-Waututh Chief Dan George would be outraged at the “monstrous development on sacred land.”&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To Indigenous people themselves, though, these developments mark a decisive moment in the evolution of our sovereignty in this country. The fact is, Canadians aren’t used to seeing Indigenous people occupy places that are socially,</span> <span>economically or geographically valuable, like Sen</span><span>̓</span><span>áḵw. After decades of marginalization, our absence seems natural, our presence somehow unnatural. Something like Sen</span><span>̓</span><span>áḵw is remarkable not just in terms of its scale and economic value (expected to generate billions in revenue for the Squamish Nation). It’s remarkable because it’s a restoration of our authority and presence in the heart of a Canadian city.</span></p>

<p><span>And in fact, Indigenous people have always been part of Canada’s cities—indeed, those cities were often built on top of Indigenous communities. Sen</span><span>̓</span><span>áḵw itself was a city of cedar longhouses long before Vancouver existed. Its Squamish residents saw their land carved up for railways, until at last they were loaded onto a barge and shipped away in 1913, their homes torched. Similarly, the heart of Winnipeg, where its rivers meet, has been a hub for Indigenous nations for thousands of years. The Mi’kmaq on the east coast gathered in what is now Halifax Harbour long before settlers showed up. Yet in every case, arriving settlers displaced Indigenous citizens, usually to more distant and marginal locations. Sometimes this was framed as benevolence: during the 1950s, Inuit families were airlifted from traditional lands to the extreme High Arctic, under the auspices of encouraging them to resume traditional ways of life. In fact they were serving as evidence of Canada’s Cold War-era sovereignty over the north, and they were separated from their lands and hunting grounds. Many died.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>But more recently, Indigenous communities have been re-asserting the power taken from them, winning victories affirming their sovereign and treaty rights—which in turn are providing more authority over their own affairs and economic development. Last spring in Ontario, 21 Anishinaabe communities won a $10-billion settlement for a fair share of the wealth generated from their lands, as guaranteed in the long-ignored Robinson-Huron Treaty of 1850. Or consider Bill C-92, which the Supreme Court of Canada upheld this February, affirming the jurisdictional rights of Indigenous nations over child welfare services.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Likewise, the return of Sen</span><span>̓</span><span>áḵw to the Squamish people was only achieved after decades of court battles. Across the country, Indigenous nations have grown tired of waiting around for Canada to voluntarily uphold its end of the reconciliation bargain. Instead, they’re holding Canada and its citizens to account—not by request but by right, to claim the power long denied them. It’s that demonstration of power that makes some Canadians uneasy—Sen</span><span>̓</span><span>áḵw just happens to be a particularly and literally towering example of this sovereignty in action, one rising up from the heart of a major city. </span></p>
<p><span>What chafes critics, even those who might consider themselves progressive, is that they expect reconciliation to instead look like a kind of reversal, rewinding the tape of history to some museum-diorama past. Coalitions of neighbours near Iy̓álmexw and Sen</span><span>̓</span><span>áḵw have offered their own counter-proposals for developing the sites, featuring smaller, shorter buildings and other changes. At the January hearing for Iy̓álmexw, one resident called on the First Nations to build entirely with selectively logged B.C. timber, in accord with what she claimed were their cultural values. These types of requests reveal that many Canadians believe the purpose of reconciliation is not to uphold Indigenous rights and sovereignty, but to quietly scrub centuries of colonial residue from the landscape, ultimately in service of their own aesthetic preferences and personal interests.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>That attitude can cast Indigenous people in the role of glorified park rangers—and even then, with limits on their authority. Last August, when Líl̓wat and N’Quatqua First Nations exercised their jurisdiction by abruptly closing public access to Joffre Lakes Park, one of B.C.’s most popular Instagram backdrops, for a month of harvesting, hunting and ceremony, many visitors and nearby residents were outraged. No matter how it’s exercised, too much authority makes many Canadians nervous. But Indigenous nations are accountable, first and foremost, to their own citizens. That could mean temporarily barring access to traditional lands, as in Joffre Lakes. It could also mean maximizing the economic potential of their property, to provide housing and funds to support education, health care and community growth. As Squamish councillor Khelsilem told </span><i><span>The Tyee</span></i><span> in 2020, “Real estate development is an opportunity for us to generate real wealth for our community.”</span></p>
<p><span>In Sen</span><span>̓</span><span>áḵw’s case, it’s Indigenous by design, whatever it might look like to others. The project offers exciting architectural possibilities which could be replicated elsewhere by Indigenous leaders: a focus on communal public spaces rather than private yards, walking paths over parking spaces and the incorporation of Indigenous languages and designs reflecting thousands of years of site-specific history. And rather than taking an incremental approach to development, with concessions to nearby homeowners, the projects at Sen</span><span>̓</span><span>áḵw, Iy̓álmexw and Heather Lands consider the entire community—including those who don’t yet live there, and those often marginalized by city planning, such as renters, non-drivers and, obviously, Indigenous people. (250 affordable homes will be set aside at Sen</span><span>̓</span><span>áḵw for Squamish citizens, and managed by the nation’s non-profit society Hiy</span><span>̓</span><span>ám</span><span>̓</span><span> Housing.) On the Sen</span><span>̓</span><span>áḵw website, the Squamish Nation emphasized that rental housing will provide economic benefits for the next seven generations of its citizens. The chiefs of all three nations emphasized that Iy</span><span>̓</span><span>álmexw is for both “current and future residents of the region.”&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>Restoring Indigenous authority won’t turn back the clock to some pre-contact past. Instead it will propel us forward. These three First Nations have been resolute in their vision, refusing to diminish the size or scale of their developments to appease anyone. In fact, the number of homes planned for Iy</span><span>̓</span><span>álmexw has recently increased. And all three projects are proceeding. The policy plan for Iy</span><span>̓</span><span>álmexw was approved by Vancouver City Council in January. A lawsuit filed by a neighbourhood association to block Sen</span><span>̓</span><span>áḵw was dismissed last fall. Indigenous people as rights-holders, rather than recipients of Canadian largesse and tolerance, still makes some people uncomfortable, but they have some time to get used to it. Sen</span><span>̓</span><span>áḵw won’t be finished until around 2030. And in the decades that follow, Vancouver’s skyline will keep evolving—to look not like its colonial past, but an increasingly Indigenous future.</span></p>

  <p>Understand better how HTTP works in each version.</p>
<p><a href="https://alexandrehtrb.github.io/posts/2024/03/http2-e-http3-explicados">Ler em português</a></p>
<p>In the beginning of the 1990s, Tim Berners-Lee and his team at <a href="https://home.cern/">CERN</a> worked together to elaborate the basis of the World Wide Web, defining four building blocks for the Internet:</p>
<ul>
<li>A document format for hypertext (HTML)</li>
<li>A data transmission protocol (HTTP)</li>
<li>A web browser to view hypertext (the first browser, WorldWideWeb)</li>
<li>A server to transmit the data (an early version of httpd)</li>
</ul>
<p>HTTP reused for data transport the existing TCP/IP protocols, with HTTP message bytes residing in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_layer">application layer</a>, light blue in the image below.</p>
<p><img src="https://alexandrehtrb.github.io/assets/img/posts/2024_03_osi_model_tcp_ip.png" alt="OSI model"></p><h2 id="http%2F0.9" tabindex="-1"><a href="#http%2F0.9"><span>HTTP/0.9</span></a></h2>
<p>It was the first HTTP draft. The only existing method was <code>GET</code>; there were no headers nor status codes; and the only data format available was HTML. Just like in HTTP/1.0 and HTTP/1.1, the HTTP messages were in an ASCII text structure.</p>
<p>Example of a HTTP/0.9 request:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>GET /mypage.html</span></span>
<span><span></span></span></code></pre>
<p>Response example:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>&lt;html&gt;</span></span>
<span><span>  A very simple HTML page</span></span>
<span><span>&lt;/html&gt;</span></span>
<span><span></span></span></code></pre>
<h2 id="http%2F1.0" tabindex="-1"><a href="#http%2F1.0"><span>HTTP/1.0</span></a></h2>
<p>This version gave to HTTP its current structure, similar to a <a href="https://www.learninghub.ac.nz/writing/writing/writing-a-memorandum/">memorandum</a>, also introducing new methods (<code>HEAD</code> and <code>POST</code>), MIME types, status codes and protocol versioning.</p>
<p>Example of a HTTP/1.0 request:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>GET /mypage.html HTTP/1.0</span></span>
<span><span>User-Agent: NCSA_Mosaic/2.0 (Windows 3.1)</span></span>
<span><span></span></span></code></pre>
<p>Response example:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>200 OK</span></span>
<span><span>Date: Tue, 15 Nov 1994 08:12:31 GMT</span></span>
<span><span>Server: CERN/3.0 libwww/2.17</span></span>
<span><span>Content-Type: text/html</span></span>
<span><span></span></span>
<span><span>&lt;HTML&gt;</span></span>
<span><span>A page with an image</span></span>
<span><span>  &lt;IMG SRC="/myimage.gif"&gt;</span></span>
<span><span>&lt;/HTML&gt;</span></span>
<span><span></span></span></code></pre>
<h2 id="http%2F1.1" tabindex="-1"><a href="#http%2F1.1"><span>HTTP/1.1</span></a></h2>
<p>This version came up in early 1997, few months after its predecessor. The main changes were:</p>
<ul>
<li>Persistent TCP connections (keep-alive), saving machine and network resources. In the previous version, a new TCP connection was opened for each request and closed after the response.</li>
<li><code>Host</code> header, allowing more than one server under the same IP.</li>
<li>Header conventions for encoding, cache, language and MIME type.</li>
</ul>
<p>Example of a HTTP/1.1 request:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>GET /api/fruit/orange HTTP/1.1</span></span>
<span><span>Host: www.fruityvice.com</span></span>
<span><span>Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate, br</span></span>
<span><span></span></span></code></pre>
<p>Response example:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>HTTP/1.1 200 OK</span></span>
<span><span>Server: nginx/1.16.1</span></span>
<span><span>Date: Sun, 10 Mar 2024 20:44:25 GMT</span></span>

<p><img src="https://alexandrehtrb.github.io/assets/img/posts/2024_03_http1_tcp_packets.png" alt="HTTP1 in TCP packets"></p>
<p>In 2015, after many years of observation and studies on the performance of the Internet, the HTTP/2 was proposed and created, based on Google's SPDY.</p>
<p>Among its differences, were the multiplexing of many messages in a single TCP packet; binary format of the messages; and HPACK compression for headers.</p>
<p>In HTTP/1.1, two requests cannot ride together the same TCP connection - it is necessary that the first one ends for the subsequent to begin. This is called <em>head-of-line blocking</em>. In the diagram below, request 2 cannot be sent until response 1 arrives, considering that only one TCP connection is used.</p>
<pre><code><p>sequenceDiagram
    Client-&gt;&gt;+Server: req 1
    Server--&gt;&gt;-Client: res 1
    Client-&gt;&gt;+Server: req 2
    Server--&gt;&gt;-Client: res 2
</p></code></pre>
<p>With HTTP/2, this problem is solved with <em>streams</em>, each stream corresponds to a message. Many streams can be interleaved in a single TCP packet. If a stream can't emit its data for some reason, other streams can take its place in the TCP packet.</p>
<p>HTTP/2 streams are divided in <em>frames</em>, each one containing: the frame type, the stream that it belongs to, and the length in bytes. In the diagram below, a coloured rectangle is a TCP packet and a ✉ is a HTTP/2 frame inside it. The first and third TCP packets carry frames of different streams.</p>
<pre><code><p>sequenceDiagram
    rect rgb(239, 190, 125)
        Client-&gt;&gt;+Server: req1: #9993;1/1&lt;br&gt;+&lt;br&gt;req2: #9993;1/1
    end
    rect rgb(197, 234, 189)
        Server--&gt;&gt;Client: res1: #9993;1/2
    end
    rect rgb(197, 234, 189)
        Server--&gt;&gt;-Client: res1: #9993;2/2&lt;br&gt;+&lt;br&gt;res2: #9993;1/1
    end
</p></code></pre>
<p>The image below shows how frames go inside a TCP packet. Stream 1 carries a HTTP response for a JavaScript file and stream 2 carries a HTTP response for a CSS file.</p>
<p><img src="https://alexandrehtrb.github.io/assets/img/posts/2024_03_http2_tcp_packets.png" alt="HTTP2 frames in TCP packets"></p><h2 id="http%2F3" tabindex="-1"><a href="#http%2F3"><span>HTTP/3</span></a></h2>
<p>HTTP/3 was born from a new transport protocol, QUIC, created by Google in 2012. QUIC is encapsulated inside UDP, and compared to TCP, it proposes:</p>
<ul>
<li>fewer packet roundtrips to establish connection and TLS authentication;</li>
<li>more resilient connections regarding packet losses;</li>
<li>to solve the head-of-line blocking that exists in TCP and TLS.</li>
</ul>
<p>HTTP/2 solves the HTTP head-of-line blocking, but, this problem also happens with TCP and TLS. TCP understands that the data it needs to send is a contiguous sequence of packets, and if any packet is lost, it must be resent, in order to preserve information integrity. <em>With TCP, subsequent packets cannot be sent until the lost packet is successfully resent to the destination.</em></p>
<p>The diagram below explains visually how this happens in HTTP/2. The second packet only had frames of response 1, but its loss delays both response 1 and response 2 - that means that in this case, there is no parallelism.</p>
<pre><code><p>sequenceDiagram
    rect rgb(239, 190, 125)
        Client-&gt;&gt;+Server: req1: #9993;1/1&lt;br&gt;+&lt;br&gt;req2: #9993;1/1
    end
    rect rgb(197, 234, 189)
        Server--xClient: res1: #9993;1/2
    end
    Note over Client,Server: lost TCP packet&lt;br&gt;must be resent.&lt;br&gt;delays both res1 and res2
    rect rgb(197, 234, 189)
        Server--&gt;&gt;Client: res1: #9993;1/2
    end
    rect rgb(197, 234, 189)
        Server--&gt;&gt;-Client: res1: #9993;2/2&lt;br&gt;+&lt;br&gt;res2: #9993;1/1
    end
</p></code></pre>
<p>To solve TCP's head-of-line blocking, QUIC decided to use UDP for its transport protocol, because UDP does not care for guarantees of arrival. The responsibility of data integrity, that in TCP is part of the transport layer, is moved in QUIC to the application layer, and the frames of a message can arrive out of order, without blocking unrelated streams.</p>
<p><img src="https://alexandrehtrb.github.io/assets/img/posts/2024_03_http3_quic_packets.png" alt="HTTP3 QUIC packets"></p><pre><code><p>sequenceDiagram

    end
</p></code></pre>
<p>The head-of-line blocking related to TLS (SSL) happens on TCP because the cryptography is usually applied over the entire message content, meaning that all data (all packets) needs to be received for the decryption to happen. With QUIC, the cryptography is individual for each QUIC packet, that is decrypted on arrival, without having to receive all packets beforehand.</p>
<p>TLS with TCP:</p>
<ol>
<li>Input data: <code>A+B+C</code></li>

<p>* TLS 1.2 requires 2 roundtrips for cryptographic handshake and TLS 1.3 requires only 1, with the option for 0-RTT (<em>zero roundtrip time resumption</em>), where there is no need of previous handshake. <strong>However, 0-RTT enables <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-0-rtt">replay attacks</a> and therefore is unsafe.</strong></p>
<p>** QUIC's connection ID can be used for fingerprinting, posing a risk to user privacy, according to a <a href="https://alexandrehtrb.github.io/assets/misc/2024_03_research_A_QUIC_Look_at_Web_Tracking.pdf">research</a>.</p>
<h2 id="which-is-the-best-version%3F" tabindex="-1"><a href="#which-is-the-best-version%3F"><span>Which is the best version?</span></a></h2>
<p>The two best versions currently are HTTP/2 and HTTP/3.</p>
<p>HTTP/3 was designed for unstable connections, such as cellphone and satellite networks. To counter network instabilities, QUIC has a great degree of independence between the data streams and good resilience if packets are lost. Nevertheless, HTTP/3 has performance penalties, mainly for 1) the UDP protocol wasn't optimized by routers and operating systems over the last decades due to its low usage, making it comparatively slower than TCP; and 2) the packet-by-packet cryptography used by QUIC requires a greater number of mathematical operations, becoming less efficient than the entire message cryptography used in TCP. Also, there is the issue that the UDP protocol is restricted in some networks to protect against attacks like <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/udp-flood-ddos-attack/">UDP flood attack</a> and <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/deep-inside-a-dns-amplification-ddos-attack">DNS amplification attack</a>.</p>
<p>On reliable and stable connections, HTTP/2 many times offers better performance than HTTP/3.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, it's recommended to run compatibility and performance tests to determine which version is the most appropriate, and furthermore, a server can accept both HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 connections, leaving to the client the decision of which version to use.</p>

<h3>Downloading</h3>



<p>The sheet is available as an xlsb (Excel binary) file in the&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/ianand/spreadsheets-are-all-you-need/releases/tag/v0.5.0">Releases section</a>&nbsp;of the github repo. You should be able to download and run this file in Excel for Mac or PC.</p>



<h3>Using</h3>



<p>If you’re quickly trying to orient yourself to the spreadsheet this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjD2n_e9E3w">walk through video</a> may be helpful though it is not oriented to beginners. For beginners, it’s recommended to start with the lesson videos.</p>



<p>Please realize the implementation is just enough to run very small workloads:</p>



<ul>
<li>Full GPT2 small (124M parameters) model including byte pair encoding, embeddings, multi-headed attention, and multi-layer perceptron stages</li>



<li>Inference/forward pass only (no training)</li>



<li>Context is limited to 10 tokens in length</li>



<li>10 characters per word limit</li>



<li>Zero temperature output only</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>This sheet is very big.</strong>&nbsp;Unfortunately, it is not unusual for Excel to lock up (but only on a Mac) while using this spreadsheet. It is highly recommended to use the manual calculation mode in Excel and the Windows version of Excel (either on a Windows directory or via Parallels on a Mac).</p>



<h3>Issues</h3>



<p>Bugs are not out of the question. Please file issues on&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/ianand/spreadsheets-are-all-you-need">Github</a></p>

<h2 id="faq">FAQ</h2>



<h3>What about Google Sheets?</h3>



<p>This project actually started on Google Sheets but the full 124M model was too big and switched to Excel. I’m still exploring ways to make this work in Google Sheets but it is unlikely to fit into a single file as it can with Excel.</p>



<h3>Why can’t I chat with it like ChatGPT? It doesn’t match the output of ChatGPT?</h3>



<p>Aside from the minuscule context length, it also lacks the instruction tuning and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) that turn a large language model into a chatbot.</p>



<h3>Why is it called Spreadsheets-are-all-you-need</h3>



<p>The name is a play on the title of the famous&nbsp;<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762">Attention Is All You Need</a>&nbsp;paper which first described the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformer_(machine_learning_model)">Transformer machine learning architecture</a>&nbsp;that underlies ChatGPT, Claude, Bard, and many of the latest Generative AI tools.</p>

  <p>I started my blog originally to help me get to the next level in my career and help establish myself as an authority in the areas of tech that I was focusing on. I liked writing and thought I had something to say.</p><p>Looking back at my 6 years of blogging now it’s hard to recognise myself from the engineer I was back then before writing was a regular habit for me. It’s funny because in the end my blog <span>was</span> the key to unlock the next door in my career but not necessarily for the reasons I expected. I figured if I could write some interesting posts I could turn up to an interview and use it as a kind of portfolio, but it became so much more than that.</p><p>The thing that surprised me after a while of doing technical writing was that writing wasn’t just about me explaining something to an audience, it was a tool to give rigor to my thinking.&nbsp;I cared about my reputation and about my potential readers and so embarking on writing a blog post about a technical subject ended up involving a huge amount of work. I knew that if I wasn’t careful or was indeed careless about what I wrote I’d not only be wasting people’s time but I could be publicly ridiculed on the internet. So I only wrote about things that I had a fundamental understanding of or set about getting that deep understanding that I lacked first.</p><p>The great thing about writing is that it uncovers all these areas that you thought you understood but don’t. This is especially true when you know that competent and knowledgeable people are going to read it. You start explaining something in detail, about how it works, what the trade-offs are, the alternatives and so on and very soon your internal BS detector is going off. It’s yelling “How do you know that!?” and “What evidence do you have for this statement!?”. You realize that your knowledge is based on shaky foundations and your words are worthless. So you set out to learn the missing pieces, search for the insights and fundamental truths so that you can explain all this stuff with authenticity.</p><p>When you write regularly and face-off against this internal BS detector you either level up or go home. Writing forced me to learn things to a higher standard like nothing else. </p><p>After a while of writing my blog I realized that it had taught me how to think. It taught me how to discover insights that few others had seen. It brought me to the next level I needed. Then further down the road because I wrote quality posts I slowly got visibility within my niche area of tech and that translated into more work opportunities.</p><p>Now I don’t just write publicly on blogs but privately for my team when the subject is something I can’t share publicly or isn’t the kind of thing that I think is going to be valuable to others. I might write a kind of blog post about an imaginary feature I am envisaging, a new technique that can help us or how something works. Because I do share it with people I get that automatic BS detection in my head that tells me when my thinking is sloppy or on shaky ground. It also forces me to flesh out the idea, consider all its trade-offs. Sometimes it ends up being generally applicable enough that I can actually publish it. This is how my recent <a href="https://medium.com/splunk-maas/apache-bookkeeper-internals-part-1-high-level-6dce62269125">Apache BookKeeper internals blog series</a>  and my <a href="https://medium.com/splunk-maas/apache-bookkeeper-observability-part-1-introducing-the-metrics-7f0acb32d0dc">USE metrics series</a> started. I wanted to understand BookKeeper better and share that with my colleagues but in the end it was so valuable that I published it.</p><p>My recommendation is that you don’t look at blog writing as just something people do to work on their “personal brand”. It can definitely help with that, but first and foremost it is a tool that people can use to up their game and take their knowledge and critical thinking to the next level.</p><p>It is like training for your thinking, it makes you more powerful which translates to better understanding and greater insight. Blogging is less popular now than it was but don’t let that stop you, in the end the person that benefits most, even if few people read it, is you.<br></p><p>Photo credit: ESO</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              <p>My tech posts often come from kind of a negative place. I wish it wasn’t like that, but we all know how the mind works: writing with nuance and positivity is a lot harder than fired-up screeds of the “someone is wrong on the Internet” variety. I do try to check myself. I know that people come from all kinds of situations and codebases, everyone is doing their best given the conditions they’re in, and there really is no One True Way to write code. I will at least always try to give a good sense of how I’d prefer things be done instead, rather than just pointing at something and saying it’s bad.</p>

<p>But I think there’s another reason why I come across as negative or angry. And as always with these things it’s hard to tell if I’m just jaded and ossified from having spent my entire adult life touching keyboards, or if it has real merit: I feel like the web used to <em>work better</em>. Not in the sense of features or flagship sites—web-based email clients and word processors and image editors are all waaay better than they used to be and I would say the high-quality stuff is of higher quality than ever. I’m not pining for the HTML-only version of GMail, I promise. But if I were to estimate some rough median of “how well do websites work” I would also say that there’s an <em>incredible</em> amount of jank out there. My father called me in exasperation last night after trying and failing to book a plane ticket. I find myself having to go over to their house and do things like switch browsers, open private windows, occasionally even open up the Web Inspector to fiddle with the markup, and I hate every second of it. I’ve trained myself out of using the Back button and opening things in new windows, and I will often close and restart order flows rather than try to go back and edit something I messed up. And I just… WHY. Why is it so hard?</p>

<p>Your web browser is an amazing piece of software. Give it an HTML page and it’ll render and lay it out in milliseconds, and if you let it do what it wants to do (follow a link when it’s clicked, submit a form with a button, populate input fields, etc) it’ll just <em>work like everyone expects it to</em>. I think that’s where most of my pathos comes from: I have a lived experience from the Before Times when things were just pages and forms, and it turns out pages and forms get you very, very far.</p>

<p>I’m a web developer, so I know that the number one cause of jank and breakage is another developer having messed with the browser’s default way of doing things. I can usually figure out what has been tampered with and work around it. But normal people can’t. They expect the Back button to work, and they expect that the stuff they filled out on the previous page will be there when they click it. And it would! <em>If you would just let the browser do what it wants to do!</em></p>

<p>I could absolutely write cheerier, more charitable and uplifting tech posts. Everything doesn’t have to be an aggressive “do better” response to something or someone. But I assure you those posts come from a place of genuine concern: much of the modern web makes me sad and I feel like I’m screaming into the wind. Every broken contact form or booking site is a <em>truly spectacular</em> own-goal. If your calendar was a bunch of progressively enhanced checkboxes and a submit button, you could be riding off into the sunset and counting money instead of taking support calls from frustrated octogenarians. And it’s hard for me to shut up about that.</p>

<p>I care. I really do. That’s why I’m mad sometimes.</p>

<p dir="auto">LaVague is designed to automate menial tasks on behalf of its users. Many of these tasks are repetitive, time-consuming, and require little to no cognitive effort. By automating these tasks, LaVague aims to free up time for more meaningful endeavors, allowing users to focus on what truly matters to them.</p>
<p dir="auto">By providing an engine turning natural language queries into Selenium code, LaVague is designed to make it easy for users or other AIs to automate easily express web workflows and execute them on a browser.</p>
<p dir="auto">One of the key usages we see is to automate tasks that are personal to users and require them to be logged in, for instance automating the process of paying bills, filling out forms or pulling data from specific websites.</p>
<p dir="auto">LaVague is built on open-source projects and leverages open-sources models, either locally or remote, to ensure the transparency of the agent and ensures that it is aligned with users' interests.</p>

<ul dir="auto">
<li><strong>Natural Language Processing</strong>: Understands instructions in natural language to perform browser interactions.</li>
<li><strong>Selenium Integration</strong>: Seamlessly integrates with Selenium for automating web browsers.</li>
<li><strong>Open-Source</strong>: Built on open-source projects such as transformers and llama-index, and leverages open-source models, either locally or remote, to ensure the transparency of the agent and ensures that it is aligned with users' interests.</li>
<li><strong>Local models for privacy and control</strong>: Supports local models like <code>Gemma-7b</code> so that users can fully control their AI assistant and have privacy guarantees.</li>
<li><strong>Advanced AI techniques</strong>: Uses a local embedding (<code>bge-small-en-v1.5</code>) first to perform RAG to extract the most relevant HTML pieces to feed the LLM answering the query, as directly dropping the full HTML code would not fit in context. Then leverages Few-shot learning and Chain of Thought to elicit the most relevant Selenium code to perform the action without having to finetune the LLM (<code>Nous-Hermes-2-Mixtral-8x7B-DPO</code>) for code generation.</li>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A new industrial-scale 'sand battery' has been announced for Finland, which packs 1 MW of power and a capacity of up to 100 MWh of thermal energy for use during those cold polar winters. The new battery will be about 10 times bigger than a <a href="https://newatlas.com/energy/sand-battery-polar-night/" data-cms-ai="0">pilot plant</a> that’s been running since 2022.</p><p>The sand battery, developed by Polar Night Energy, is a clever concept. Basically, it’s a big steel silo of sand (or a similar solid material) that’s warmed up through a heat exchanger buried in the center, using excess electricity from the grid – say, that generated during a spike from renewable sources, when it’s cheap.</p><p>That energy can then be stored for months at a time, with reportedly very little loss, before being extracted as heat on demand. This could theoretically be converted back into electricity, although with some energy loss. But Polar Night says that the most efficient method is to just use the heat itself.</p><p>In a chilly place like Finland, that means feeding it into the local district heating system, which shares heat produced from industry or energy production through the community. Networks of pipes carry this heat as hot water or steam to warm up houses, buildings, even swimming pools. In this case, the new sand battery would be trialed in the district heating system of the Finnish municipality of Pornainen, run by a company called Loviisan Lämpö.</p><div data-align-center="">

That, the companies claim, equates to a week’s worth of Pornainen’s heat demands in winter, or a month’s worth in summer. By comparison, Polar Night’s previous sand battery stands 4 x 7 m (13 x 23 ft), for a nominal power rating of 100 kW and a capacity of 8 MWh.</p><p>The new battery should also reduce the carbon dioxide emissions of the district heating system by 160 tonnes per year, translating to an almost 70% reduction. The sand itself will also be sustainably sourced – it’ll consist of crushed soapstone, which is a manufacturing byproduct of another local industry. This material can apparently conduct heat even better than regular old sand.</p><p>While sand batteries might not find wide outside of areas that use district heating, they could still be one useful tool in a climate change toolbox that needs to be as diverse as possible.

    <p>If you enjoy this article, I have published a book explaining the
  internals of Git through implementation: <a href="https://shop.jcoglan.com/building-git/">Building Git</a>.</p>

<p>—</p>

<p>As a programmer, you probably use a version control system such as <a href="https://git-scm.com/">Git</a>, and
spend an awful lot of your time looking at diffs. You use them to check over
your uncommitted work in progress, to look at what changed in a single commit,
to compare two branches before performing a merge, and so on. Diffs are the
language through which you understand how things have changed in your software.</p>

<p>But as well as being read by people, diffs are used by your version control
system to automate changes. You can email a diff to someone and they can use the
<code>patch</code> or <code>git apply</code> commands to merge it into their working copy. <code>git merge</code>
has to reconcile and merge two or more change histories to produce a single
tree, often reconciling changes within the same file. <code>git add --patch</code> lets you
select individual changes from a working copy file rather than adding the whole
file to the index, and that involves both you the user reading the diffs, and
git selectively applying them to the indexed version of a file. And some version
control systems use the differences between versions as their primary way to
store the project history, rather than storing a snapshot of all the code for
each commit.</p>

<p>So diffs are central to version control, but you might not have thought much
about how they’re generated. Often when you read a diff, it seems obvious to you
which things should be marked as changes. You have an intuitive mental model of
what it means to insert a new function into a file, or to delete a redundant
one, or to rewrite a section. However, there’s an awful lot more to diffing than
meets the eye, and there are many ways to do it that produce different results.</p>

<p>Think for a moment about how you’d calculate a diff, and how you’d write a
function to do it. You might have noticed that diff programs only show you what
has changed, not what has stayed the same. How would you determine which parts
of a file have not changed? Once you’ve found a difference between them, how
would you find the next line in each version where the text matches up again?
It’s more complicated than it looks!</p>

<p>In this series of articles, I’d like to walk you through the default diff
algorithm used by Git. It was developed by Eugene W. Myers, and the <a href="http://www.xmailserver.org/diff2.pdf">original
paper</a> is available online. While the paper is quite short, it is quite
mathematically dense and is focussed on proving that it works. The explanations
here will be less rigorous, but will hopefully be more intuitive, giving a
detailed walk-through of what the algorithm actually does and how it works.</p>

<p>In this first article, we’ll lay out the basic model of what the algorithm is
trying to achieve and go through an example of how it works out the simplest set
of edits to get from one version to another.</p>

<p>To use the example from the paper, say we want to calculate the difference
between two strings:</p>

<ul>
  <li><i>a</i> = <code>ABCABBA</code></li>
  <li><i>b</i> = <code>CBABAC</code></li>
</ul>

<p>By “difference”, we mean a sequence of edits that will convert string <i>a</i>
into string <i>b</i>. One possible such sequence is to simply delete each
character in <i>a</i>, and then insert each character in <i>b</i>, or to use
common diff notation:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>- A
- B
- C
- A
- B
- B
- A
</span><span>+ C
+ B
+ A
+ B
+ A
+ C
</span></code></pre></div>

<p>However, we wouldn’t consider this a good-quality diff since it doesn’t tell us
very much. Changes to source code typically leave much of a file unmodified and
we really want to see <em>sections</em> of code that were inserted or deleted. A diff
that shows the entire file being removed and replaced with the new version isn’t
much use to us.</p>

<p>A better diff of these two strings would be:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>- A
- B
</span>  C
<span>+ B
</span>  A
  B
<span>- B
</span>  A
<span>+ C
</span></code></pre></div>

<p>This makes the smallest possible number of changes to <i>a</i> in order to
produce <i>b</i>, so it’s a better visualisation of what really changed. It’s
not the only possible solution, for example these are also valid:</p>

<div><pre><code>1.  - A       2.  - A       3.  + C
    - B           + C           - A
      C             B             B
    - A           - C           - C
      B             A             A
    + A             B             B
      B           - B           - B
      A             A             A
    + C           + C           + C
</code></pre></div>

<p>However, they are all <em>minimal</em>: they make the smallest number of edits
possible, which in this case is five. What’s interesting about them is they
differ in which sections they consider to be the same between the strings, and
which order they perform edits in. From looking at diffs, you probably have an
intuitive idea that diffs only show the things that changed, but these examples
show that there are many possible interpretations of the difference between two
files.</p>

<p>So, the purpose of diff algorithms is to provide a strategy for generating
diffs, where the diffs have certain desirable properties. We usually want diffs
to be as small as possible, but there are other considerations. For example,
when you change something, you’re probably used to seeing deletions followed by
insertions, not the other way round. That is, you’d rather see solution 2 than
solution 3 above. And, when you change a whole block of code, you’d like to see
the whole chunk being deleted followed by the new code being inserted, rather
than many deletions and insertions interleaved with each other.</p>

<div><pre><code>Good:   - one         Bad:    - one
        - two                 + four
        - three               - two
        + four                + five
        + five                + six
        + six                 - three
</code></pre></div>

<p>You also probably want to see deleted or inserted code that aligns with your idea
of the code’s structure, for example if you insert a method, you’d like that
method’s <code>end</code> to be considered new, rather than the <code>end</code> of the preceding
method:</p>

<div><pre><code>Good:   class Foo                   Bad:    class Foo
          def initialize(name)                def initialize(name)
            @name = name                        @name = name
          end                             +   end
      +                                   +
      +   def inspect                     +   def inspect
      +     @name                         +     @name
      +   end                                 end
        end                                 end
</code></pre></div>

<p>Myers’ algorithm is just one such strategy, but it’s fast and it produces diffs
that tend to be of good quality most of the time. It does this by being
<em>greedy</em>, that is trying to consume as many lines that are the same before
making a change (therefore avoiding the “wrong <code>end</code>” problem), and also by
preferring deletions over insertions when given a choice, so that deletions
appear first.</p>

<p>The Myers paper is based on the idea that finding the <em>shortest edit script</em>
(SES) can be modelled as a graph search. Let’s take our two strings, <i>a</i> =
<code>ABCABBA</code> and <i>b</i> = <code>CBABAC</code>, and build a graph of all the ways we can get
from <i>a</i> to <i>b</i>.</p>

<p>The (<i>x</i>, <i>y</i>) co-ordinates in the grid shown below correspond to
steps in the editing process; at (0,0) we have string <i>a</i>, that is, we have
not started editing. Moving rightward (increasing <i>x</i>) corresponds to
deleting a character from <i>a</i>, for example moving to (1,0) means we’ve
deleted the first <code>A</code> from <i>a</i>. Moving downward (increasing <i>y</i>)
corresponds to inserting a character from <i>b</i>, for example if we now move
from (1,0) down to (1,1), we insert the first <code>C</code> from <i>b</i>, and our edited
string is thus <code>CBCABBA</code>. At position (4,3), we have converted <code>ABCA</code> into
<code>CBA</code>, but we still need to convert <code>BBA</code> into <code>BAC</code>.  The bottom-right position
(7,6) corresponds to converting string <i>a</i> fully into string <i>b</i>.</p>

<p>As well as moving rightward and downward, in some positions we can also move
diagonally. This occurs when the two strings have the same character at the
position’s indexes, for example the third character in <i>a</i> and the first
character in <i>b</i> are both <code>C</code>, and so position (2,0) has a diagonal leading
to (3,1). This corresponds to consuming an equal character from both strings,
neither deleting nor inserting anything.</p>

<div><pre><code>       A     B     C     A     B     B     A

<p>The idea behind the Myers algorithm is quite simple: we want to get from (0,0)
to (7,6) (the bottom-right) in as few moves as possible. A “move” is a single
step rightward (a deletion from <i>a</i>) or downward (an insertion from
<i>b</i>). The most number of moves we could take to get from <i>a</i> to
<i>b</i> is 13: the combined length of the two strings.</p>

<p>However, walking diagonal paths is free since they don’t correspond to making
<em>changes</em>, thus we want to maximise the number of diagonal steps we take and
minimise the number of rightward/downward moves. The examples above show that we
can actually get from <i>a</i> to <i>b</i> making only five edits, and Myers
provides a strategy for finding that pathway.</p>

<p>To develop an intuition for how the algorithm works, let’s start exploring the
graph. To try to find the shortest path to the bottom-right position, we’ll
explore every possible path from (0,0) in tandem until we find a path that
reaches the end. I recommend keeping the above grid handy while you follow this.</p>

<p>Let’s start by recording our initial position at (0,0).</p>



<p>We have two options from this position: we can move downward and reach (0,1) or
move rightward and reach (1,0).</p>



<p>Now let’s consider (0,1). If we move downward from here we reach (0,2), but
there is a diagonal from there to (1,3), and from (1,3) to (2,4), and since
diagonal moves are free we can say that moving downward from (0,1) gets
us to (2,4) at the cost of only one move. Therefore we’ll mark the move from
(0,1) to (2,4) as a single step in our walk.</p>

<p>Moving rightward from (0,1) takes us to (1,1) and again there is a diagonal from
there to (2,2). Let’s mark both these moves on our walk.</p>

<div><pre><code>0,0 --- 1,0
 |
 |
0,1 --- 2,2
 |
 |
2,4
</code></pre></div>

<p>Now let’s consider the other branch we took from (0,0), moving rightward to
(1,0). Moving downward from (1,0) takes us to (1,1), which as we just found out
gets us to (2,2). Moving rightward from (1,0) takes us to (2,0), which has a
diagonal to (3,1). Again, we’ll record both these steps.</p>

<p>I’m recording (2,2) as being visited via (1,0) rather than (0,1) for reasons
that will become clear a little later. For intuition, consider that making a
rightward move first means performing a deletion first, and we generally want
deletions to appear before insertions.</p>

<div><pre><code>0,0 --- 1,0 --- 3,1
 |       |
 |       |
0,1     2,2
 |
 |
2,4
</code></pre></div>

<p>We’ve now fully explored the graph to two moves deep and we can begin on our
third move. Moving downward from (2,4) gets us to (2,5), and from there is a
diagonal to (3,6). Moving rightward from (2,4) takes us to (3,4), where again a
diagonal takes us to (4,5).</p>

<div><pre><code>0,0 --- 1,0 --- 3,1
 |       |
 |       |
0,1     2,2
 |
 |
2,4 --- 4,5
 |
 |
3,6
</code></pre></div>

<p>Next, we consider (2,2). Moving rightward from there is as we’ve seen before: we
move to (3,2), and follow the diagonals from there to (5,4).  Moving downward
introduces a new situation, however: this move gets us to (2,3) and there is no
diagonal from there. Now, if we were doing a general-purpose graph search, we’d
want to record both the result of moving rightward from (2,4) and the result of
moving downward from (2,2), that is:</p>

<div><pre><code>0,0 --- 1,0 --- 3,1
 |       |
 |       |
0,1     2,2 --- 5,4
 |        \
 |         \
2,4 -       2,3
 |   \
 |    4,5
3,6
</code></pre></div>

<p>However, the structure of the particular graphs we’re examining means that it’s
sufficient to just store the <em>best</em> position you can reach after a certain set
of edits. The above record shows us that making two insertions then a deletion
(down twice, and then right) gets us to (4,5), whereas making the deletion
first, and then the two insertions, gets us to (2,3). So, we’ll just keep the
(4,5) result and throw the (2,3) away, indicating (4,5) is the best position
reachable after one deletion and two insertions <em>in any order</em>.</p>

<div><pre><code>0,0 --- 1,0 --- 3,1
 |       |
 |       |
0,1     2,2 --- 5,4
 |
 |
2,4 --- 4,5
 |
 |
3,6
</code></pre></div>

<p>Finally in our depth-2 scan, we visit (3,1). Moving downward from there goes to
(3,2), which leads diagonally to (5,4), and so we’ll again record this as a move
downward from (3,1) rather than rightward from (2,2). Moving rightward from
(3,1) gives (4,1), which has a diagonal to (5,2).</p>

<p>Here’s the completed record after three moves:</p>

<div><pre><code>0,0 --- 1,0 --- 3,1 --- 5,2
 |       |       |
 |       |       |
0,1     2,2     5,4
 |
 |
2,4 --- 4,5
 |
 |
3,6
</code></pre></div>

<p>You’re probably getting the hang of this by now so let’s rattle through the
remaining moves. We can’t move downward from (3,6), and moving rightward from
there gives (4,6), which is also reachable downward from (4,5), so we’ll mark it
as such. Rightward of (4,5) is (5,5).</p>

<div><pre><code>0,0 --- 1,0 --- 3,1 --- 5,2
 |       |       |
 |       |       |
0,1     2,2     5,4
 |
 |
2,4 --- 4,5 --- 5,5
 |       |
 |       |
3,6     4,6
</code></pre></div>

<p>(5,5) is also downward of (5,4) so we’ll mark that, and moving rightward from
(5,4) gives (6,4), with a diagonal leading to (7,5).</p>

<div><pre><code>0,0 --- 1,0 --- 3,1 --- 5,2
 |       |       |
 |       |       |
0,1     2,2     5,4 --- 7,5
 |               |
 |               |
2,4 --- 4,5     5,5
 |       |
 |       |
3,6     4,6
</code></pre></div>

<p>Downward from (5,2) also leads to (7,5), and moving rightward from (5,2) leads
to (7,3), thus completing the fourth row of the scan.</p>

<div><pre><code>0,0 --- 1,0 --- 3,1 --- 5,2 --- 7,3
 |       |       |
 |       |       |
0,1     2,2     5,4 --- 7,5
 |               |
 |               |
2,4 --- 4,5     5,5
 |       |
 |       |
3,6     4,6
</code></pre></div>

<p>Now we begin the fifth row. Since we know there are diffs from <i>a</i> to
<i>b</i> requiring only five edits, we expect this row of the scan to find the
bottom-right position, (7,6).</p>

<p>There is nothing downward from (4,6), and rightward of that is (5,6), which is
also downward from (5,5). Rightward of (5,5) is (6,5).</p>

<div><pre><code>0,0 --- 1,0 --- 3,1 --- 5,2 --- 7,3
 |       |       |
 |       |       |
0,1     2,2     5,4 --- 7,5
 |               |
 |               |
2,4 --- 4,5     5,5 --- 6,5
 |       |       |
 |       |       |
3,6     4,6     5,6
</code></pre></div>

<p>Finally, moving downward from (7,5) gives (7,6) – the final position! This is
certainly better than (6,5), which we reached by going right, right, down, down,
right, and so we replace it in our trace of the moves.</p>

<div><pre><code>0,0 --- 1,0 --- 3,1 --- 5,2 --- 7,3
 |       |       |
 |       |       |
0,1     2,2     5,4 --- 7,5
 |               |       |
 |               |       |
2,4 --- 4,5     5,5     7,6
 |       |       |
 |       |       |
3,6     4,6     5,6
</code></pre></div>

<p>So that’s the basic idea the algorithm is based on: given two strings, find the
shortest path through a graph that represents the edit space between the two. We
explore every possible route through the graph breadth-first, and stop as soon
as we reach the final position.</p>

<p>In the next article, we’ll look at how Myers actually represents this process,
and start to look at implementing it in code.</p>
