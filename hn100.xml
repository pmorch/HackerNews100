    <h2>
    <a href="#Unified-Versus-Split-Diff"><span>Unified Versus Split Diff</span> <time datetime="2023-10-23">Oct 23, 2023</time></a>
    </h2>
<p><span>Which is better for code reviews, a unified diff or a split diff?</span></p>
<p><span>A split diff looks like this for me:</span></p>

<figure>

<img alt="" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1711539/277481233-026508cf-47ed-4897-934a-fee18b708553.png">
</figure>
<p><span>And this is a unified one:</span></p>

<figure>

<img alt="" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1711539/277481510-12ee62af-0305-412b-9f37-57a37744751b.png">
</figure>
<p><span>If the changes are simple and small, both views are good. But for larger, more complex changes</span>
<span>neither works for me.</span></p>
<p><span>For a large change, I don</span>’<span>t want to do a </span>“<span>diff review</span>”<span>, I want to do a proper code review of a</span>
<span>codebase at a particular instant in time, paying specific attention to the recently changed areas,</span>
<span>but mostly just doing general review, as if I am writing the code. I need to run tests, use goto</span>
<span>definition and other editor navigation features, apply local changes to check if some things could</span>
<span>have been written differently, look at the wider context to notice things that </span><em><span>should</span></em><span> have been</span>
<span>changed, and in general notice anything that might be not quite right with the codebase,</span>
<span>irrespective of the historical path to the current state of the code.</span></p>
<p><span>So, for me, the ideal diff view would look rather like this:</span></p>

<figure>

<img alt="" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1711539/277485436-5e9ff9d5-325b-4e2c-8285-4acb6a8c088b.png">
</figure>
<p><span>On the left, the current state of the code (which is also the on-disk state), with changes subtly</span>
<span>highlighted in the margins. On the right, the unified diff for the portion of the codebase currently</span>
<span>visible on the left.</span></p>
<p><span>Sadly, this format of review isn</span>’<span>t well supported by the tools </span>—<span> everyone seems to be happy</span>
<span>reviewing diffs, rather than the actual code?</span></p>
<p><span>I have a low-tech and pretty inefficient workflow for this style of review. A </span><a href="https://github.com/matklad/config/blob/master/xtool/src/gpr.rs"><code>gpr</code>
<span>script</span></a><span> for checking out a pull</span>
<span>request locally:</span></p>

<figure>


<pre><code><span><span>$</span> gpr 1234 --review</span></code></pre>

</figure>
<p><span>Internally, it does roughly</span></p>

<figure>


<pre><code><span><span>$</span> git fetch unstream refs/pull/1234/head</span>
<span><span>$</span> git switch --detach FETCH_HEAD</span>
<span><span>$</span> git reset $(git merge-base HEAD main)</span></code></pre>

</figure>
<p><span>The last line is the key </span>—<span> it erases all the commits from the pull request, but keeps all of the</span>
<span>changes. This lets me abuse my workflow for staging&amp;committing to do a code review </span>—
<a href="https://github.com/kahole/edamagit"><span>edamagit</span></a><span> shows the list of changed files, I get </span>“<span>go to</span>
<span>next/previous change</span>”<span> shortcuts in the editor, I can even use the staging area to mark hunks I have</span>
<span>reviewed.</span></p>
<p><span>The only thing I </span><em><span>don</span>’<span>t</span></em><span> get is automatic synchronization between magit status buffer, and the file</span>
<span>that</span>’<span>s currently open in the editor. That is, to view the current file and the diff on the side, I</span>
<span>have to manually open the diff and scroll it to the point I am currently looking at.</span></p>
<p><span>I wish it was easier to get this close to the code without building custom ad-hoc tools!</span></p>

								<p>Voyager 2 is over 12 billion miles from Earth, making its way through interstellar space. Along its almost 50-year journey, the probe has seen more of the universe than we ever will. Now, NASA has completed a critical software update for <a href="https://bgr.com/tag/voyager-2/">Voyager 2</a> that will help keep it running even longer.</p><div>	<h4>Tech. Entertainment. Science. Your inbox.</h4>	<p>Sign up for the most interesting tech &amp; entertainment news out there.</p>		<p>By signing up, I agree to the <a rel="noopener" href="https://pmc.com/terms-of-use/" target="_blank">Terms of Use</a> and have reviewed the <a rel="noopener" href="https://pmc.com/privacy-policy/" target="_blank">Privacy Notice.</a></p>	</div>
<p>The update, which took almost 18 hours to complete, was transmitted to help Voyager 2 avoid the same problem that its sibling, <a href="https://bgr.com/tag/voyager-1/">Voyager 1</a>, experienced last year. Back in 2022, NASA reported issues with <a href="https://bgr.com/science/a-bizarre-mystery-surrounding-nasa-voyager-1-probe-is-being-investigated/">readings from Voyager 1’s AACS</a>, which stands for attitude articular and control system. The telemetry data that NASA was getting didn’t make sense, and NASA was concerned it had lost the probe forever.</p>


<p>Thankfully, the issue doesn’t seem to have caused any lasting issues with Voyager 1, but NASA wants to avoid the same thing happening with Voyager 2, so it just sent out this huge software update. The patch is essentially an insurance policy that NASA hopes will project the probe for future interstellar space exploration.</p>

<p>Because the space probe is so far away, the data it sends back is exceptionally unique and important. And, since it took so long to send the update, NASA scientists are carrying out a readout of the AACS memory to ensure that it is in the right place for the update. If there aren’t any issues, it will trigger the Voyager 2 update on October 28.</p>
<p>Considering <a href="https://bgr.com/science/voyager-2-signal-reestablished-after-nasa-shouted-into-the-cosmos/">NASA lost contact with Voyager 2</a> briefly earlier this year, the test has many people on the edge of their seats, waiting to see where things go.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/nasas-voyager-team-focuses-on-software-patch-thrusters">NASA plans</a> to use Voyager 2 as a testbed for the update. If all goes according to plan, it will also send the patch to Voyager 1, which is currently more than 15 billion miles away from Earth, thus making its data even more valuable than that of Voyager 2. </p>
<p>The space agency says it is also allowing both probes to turn more before reorienting them in an attempt to slow the build-up of propellant residue in the fuel lines. Either way, both probes will hopefully get the update, allowing them to run for several more years before NASA has to worry about either of them giving out.</p>

<p>1Password, a password manager used by millions of people and more than 100,000 businesses, said it detected suspicious activity on a company account provided by Okta, the identity and authentication service that disclosed a breach on Friday.</p>
<p>“On September 29, we detected suspicious activity on our Okta instance that we use to manage our employee-facing apps,” 1Password CTO Pedro Canahuati wrote in an email. “We immediately terminated the activity, investigated, and found no compromise of user data or other sensitive systems, either employee-facing or user-facing.”</p>
<p>Since then, Canahuati said, his company had been working with Okta to determine the means that the unknown attacker used to access the account. On Friday, investigators confirmed it resulted from a breach Okta reported hitting its customer support management system.</p>
<p>Okta said then that a threat actor <a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2023/10/okta-says-hackers-breached-its-support-system-and-viewed-customer-files/">gained unauthorized access</a> to its customer support case management system and, from there, viewed files uploaded by some Okta customers. The files the threat actor obtained in the Okta compromise comprised HTTP archive, or HAR, files, which Okta support personnel use to replicate customer browser activity during troubleshooting sessions. Among the sensitive information they store are authentication cookies and session tokens, which malicious actors can use to impersonate valid users.
</p><p>Security firm BeyondTrust said it discovered the intrusion after an attacker used valid authentication cookies in an attempt to access its Okta account. The attacker could perform “a few confined actions,” but ultimately, BeyondTrust access policy controls stopped the activity and blocked all access to the account. 1Password now becomes the second known Okta customer to be targeted in a follow-on attack.</p>
<p>Monday’s statement from 1Password provided no further details about the incident, and representatives didn’t respond to questions. A report dated October 18 and shared on an internal 1Password Notion workspace said the threat actor obtained a HAR file a company IT employee had created when recently engaging with Okta support. The file contained a record of all traffic between the 1Password employee’s browser and Okta servers, including session cookies.</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>1Password representatives didn’t respond to a request to confirm the document's authenticity, which was provided in both text and screenshots by an anonymous 1Password employee.</p>
<p>According to the report, the attacker also accessed 1Password’s Okta tenant. Okta customers use these tenants to manage the system access and system privileges assigned to various employees, partners, or customers. The threat actor also managed to view group assignments in 1Password’s Okta tenant and perform other actions, none of which resulted in entries in event logs. While logged in, the threat actor updated what’s known as an IDP (identity provider), used to authenticate to a production environment provided by Google.</p>
<p>1Password’s IT team learned of the access on September 29 when team members received an unexpected email suggesting one of them had requested a list of 1Password users with admin rights to the Okta tenant. Team members recognized no authorized employee had made the request and alerted the company’s security response team. Since the incident came to light, 1Password has also changed the configuration settings for its Okta tenant, including denying logins from non-Okta identity providers.</p>
<p>A summary of the actions the attacker took are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Attempted to access the IT employee’s Okta dashboard but was blocked</li>
<li>Updated an existing IDP tied to 1Password’s production Google environment</li>
<li>Activated the IDP</li>
<li>Requested a report of administrative users</li>
</ul>
<p>On October 2, three days following the event, the attackers logged back into 1Password’s Okta tenant and tried to use the Google IDP they had previously enabled. The actor was unsuccessful because the IDP had been removed. Both the earlier and subsequent accesses came from a server provided by cloud host LeaseWeb in the US and used a version of Chrome on a Windows machine.</p>
<p>The Okta breach is one of a series of attacks in recent years on large companies that provide software or services to large numbers of customers. After gaining entry to the provider, attackers use their position in follow-on attacks targeting the customers. It is likely that more Okta customers will be identified in the weeks to come.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div fs-codehighlight-element="code" fs-toc-element="contents" fs-toc-offsettop="6rem" fs-toc-hideurlhash="true" fs-codehighlight-theme="base16/phd"><h2>What is Generative AI?</h2><figure><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/62e939ff79009c74307c8d3e/646b2da25475be2a2a5f6aac_d7a7a360.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>Example of background AI generated images</figcaption></figure><p>Generative AI refers to a type of artificial intelligence that is capable of generating new content that has not been explicitly programmed into the system. This is achieved by using machine learning algorithms to analyze and learn from large datasets, and then using that knowledge to create new content such as images, music, text, or even video.</p><p>Generative AI models are typically based on neural networks that use probabilistic methods to generate content that is similar to the training data, but not identical. For example, a generative AI model trained on a dataset of bird images might be able to generate new images of birds that have never been seen before.</p><h2>Why is Generative AI Useful?</h2><p>Generative AI has the potential to automate and streamline many tasks and processes, improve the quality and diversity of content, and provide new insights and predictions that can help individuals and organizations make better decisions. Specifically, it can be used in a variety of ways, such as:</p><ol role="list"><li><strong>Content Creation</strong>: Generative AI can be used to create new and original content, such as images, music, and text, that can be used in various industries, such as advertising, marketing, and entertainment.</li><li><strong>Data Augmentation</strong>: Generative AI can be used to create new data samples that are similar to existing data, which can be used to train machine learning models and improve their performance.</li><li><strong>Simulation</strong>: Generative AI can be used to create simulated environments and scenarios that can be used to test and evaluate new technologies, such as autonomous vehicles and robots.</li><li><strong>Personalization</strong>: Generative AI can be used to create personalized content, such as product recommendations and news articles, based on individual user preferences and behaviour.</li><li><strong>Predictive Analysis</strong>: Generative AI can be used to generate predictions and insights based on large datasets, such as predicting stock prices or identifying potential health risks.</li></ol><h2>What Images Can You Expect to Generate?</h2><p>Generative AI models excel at generating varying images in which there is a prominent object in the foreground and contextualized background. In these conditions, the models are capable of seamlessly replacing objects or backgrounds, changing graphic styles, or creating similar variations on images. This can allow users to easily create high quality art, create production quality product advertisement photos, or even augment and populate computer vision datasets by replacing backgrounds or foreground objects to cover edge cases.</p><h2>What are Some Generative AI Methods?</h2><p>There are many methods to generate data, ranging from more traditional cut-and-paste methods to from-scratch generation using state-of-the-art probabilistic models.</p><h4>Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)</h4><p>Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are a type of generative AI technique that uses a system of two neural networks to generate new content. The first network, called the generator, creates new samples, such as images or text, from a random noise signal. The second network, called the discriminator, evaluates whether the generated samples are similar enough to the training data.</p><figure><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/62e939ff79009c74307c8d3e/646b302a33d628c34a69a920_7de59d54.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>GAN architecture diagram (<a href="https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/gan/gan_structure" target="_blank">source</a>).</figcaption></figure><p>The generator and discriminator are trained together in a process known as adversarial training. The generator tries to create samples that can fool the discriminator into thinking they are real, while the discriminator tries to correctly classify the generated samples as fake. The result of this process is a generator network that is able to create new samples that are similar to the training data.</p><p>Despite their impressive results, GANs can be challenging to train and can suffer from issues such as mode collapse, where the generator produces a limited set of outputs rather than diverse and unique samples.</p><h4>Stable Diffusion</h4><figure><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/62e939ff79009c74307c8d3e/646b305d23fd983a2c83ee95_4170454c.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>Stable Diffusion model architecture diagram (<a href="https://scholar.harvard.edu/binxuw/classes/machine-learning-scratch/materials/stable-diffusion-scratch">source</a>).</figcaption></figure><p>Stable Diffusion is a variant of the diffusion process, which is a probabilistic model used in statistical physics to describe the behaviour of particles in a fluid. In the context of generative AI, <a href="https://stability.ai/blog/stable-diffusion-public-release" target="_blank">Stable Diffusion</a> refers to a method that gradually generates an image from a noise signal. The noise signal is passed through a sequence of increasingly complex convolutional neural networks (CNNs), with each network generating a slightly more refined version of the image. This process continues until the final output is generated, which is a high-quality image that is similar to the original training data.</p><p>The Stable Diffusion technique is designed to address some of the limitations of other generative AI techniques, such as generative adversarial networks (GANs), which can be unstable and difficult to train. Stable Diffusion is more stable and can produce high-quality, diverse, and realistic images that are suitable for a wide range of applications.</p><h2>Generating Product Images with Generative AI</h2><p>In this example, we will look at how we can combine certain methods together with traditional Computer Vision algorithms to generate more pristine images. The task for this example will be background augmentation for single objects, which can be used for a variety of applications such as object identification and product placement.</p><p>The three key ingredients for convincing and sufficiently varied images are:</p><ol role="list"><li><strong>Object Transform and Color Augmentations</strong>: creates more variation of the object to widen the variety of environments and scenarios it can be placed in.</li><li><strong>Background In-Painting</strong>: creates environmental variation in the background.</li><li><strong>Object In-Painting</strong>: fills in the background completely for a smoother transition between foreground and background.</li></ol><figure><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/62e939ff79009c74307c8d3e/646b30ca6c21bdbdd8611f1f_e34a2ec3.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>(a) Input image of a bottle of turmeric and ginger gummies (<a href="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0542/8677/8559/products/Tumeric-and-Ginger-Gummy-Vitamin_a_1200x1200.jpg?v=1621213802" target="_blank">source</a>), and (b) binary mask of the bottle. The object is filled with black pixels which are preserved during the in-painting process, while the remaining parts of the image with white pixels will be regenerated by Stable Diffusion.</figcaption></figure><p>All experiments below are run on a NVIDIA RTX 3080. If you wish to replicate the results or perform your own testing, it is recommended to use a GPU with at least 12GB of VRAM.</p><h4>Stable Diffusion In-Painting</h4><p>The original intent of Stable Diffusion was to generate new images from pure noise. However, one modification that has been gaining attention is the process of in-painting. It is traditionally a computer vision technique used to fill in or restore missing or damaged parts of an image. It involves automatically filling in the missing regions of an image with plausible content, such that the filled-in areas appear visually coherent and seamless with the surrounding areas. By masking certain areas of an image, we can direct Stable Diffusion to modify only the masked areas by iteratively re-noising and then denoising them based on a textual prompt.</p><p>We first need to obtain a segmentation mask of the object, which we can annotate on Datature’s Nexus to obtain a segmentation polygon. We then convert the polygon into a binary mask, where black pixels are preserved and white pixels will be in-painted.</p><div><pre><code>def annotation_to_mask(image, annotation):
   """Converts annotation to binary mask and saves it to disk.


   Args:
       image (np.array): Image to be masked.
       annotation (list):
           Annotation coordinates in the form of [x1, y1, x2, y2, ...].
   """
   annotation = np.array([(int(x), int(y))
                          for x, y in zip(*[iter(annotation)] * 2)])
   mask = np.ones(image.shape[:2], np.float32) * 255
   cv2.fillPoly(mask, [annotation], color=(0, 0, 0))
   cv2.imwrite(f"./mask/{IMAGE_NAME}", mask)</code></pre></div><p>We can then set up the Stable Diffusion pipeline by loading the image, mask, and set various parameters that are listed in the full code. To learn more on how the experimental parameters affect image generation, check out this <a href="https://blog.openart.ai/2023/02/13/the-most-complete-guide-to-stable-diffusion-parameters/" target="_blank">handy guide</a>.

However, there are a few imperfections, most notably that the borders between the object and the background are not pristine. The denoising process can sometimes warp the object which might not be ideal.</p><p>A less noticeable imperfection can be seen in the bottom row of text, which becomes gibberish. Though Stable Diffusion is known to be decent in generating text, especially in StabilityAI’s <a href="https://stability.ai/stablediffusion">latest XL model</a>, the text generation is typically guided by the prompt. In this case where there is existing text, it is not able to accurately reconstruct the text as this semantic information is not retained during the re-noising process. While larger text can be accurately reconstructed to a large degree, smaller text will suffer from being completely unintelligible. This is an issue that increasing the number of inference (denoising) steps to improve image quality and detail cannot solve.</p><h4>Two-Stage Background In-Painting</h4><p>To workaround this issue, we can perform object in-painting as a second stage to generate a pristine background. We then overlay the object (segmented from the original image using the binary mask) on top of the pristine background.</p><div><pre><code>

       else:
           out_image[i][j][:] = out_background[i][j][:]

</code></pre></div><figure><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/62e939ff79009c74307c8d3e/646b31e3e6c2b20c08bfb064_0af1d71d.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>(a) Output image from Stable Diffusion in-painting with the object masked out, (b) output image of the full background after a second pass through Stable Diffusion, and (c) final image after overlaying the segmented object onto the background.</figcaption></figure><p>The final image is crisper and looks more realistic. This seems to be a potential solution that can be used for image augmentation. However, we note that the object is still static. Its dimensions, location, and orientation are unchanged. This limits the amount of variation in the resulting generated dataset, and also limits Stable Diffusion in its generative power.</p><p>A solution to this is to perform traditional augmentations to the original image before it is fed into the Stable Diffusion pipeline. A popular library to do this is <a href="https://albumentations.ai/" target="_blank">Albumentations</a>, which efficiently implements a rich variety of image transform operations that are optimized for performance. It is widely used both in industry and in deep learning research.</p><div><pre><code>

])

</code></pre></div><p>A sample transformation is shown by shifting, scaling, and rotating the object with varying parameters. When the transformed image is fed into the Stable Diffusion pipeline, we obtain the following images:</p><figure><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/62e939ff79009c74307c8d3e/646b35988a08e9c914fc737d_fda0e507.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>Output images after transformations and in-painting.</figcaption></figure><p>Further testing with other input images yields the following results:</p><figure><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/62e939ff79009c74307c8d3e/646b35988a08e9c914fc73f4_e6b5802e.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>(a) Input image of a pink luggage (<a href="https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gh-072522-away-luggage-1658760915.png?crop=0.651xw:1.00xh;0.175xw,0&amp;resize=1200:*">source</a>), and (b) binary mask of the pink luggage.</figcaption></figure><figure><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/62e939ff79009c74307c8d3e/646b3599a725242fc8b4f2f9_345d9441.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>Output images with prompt: “<em>luggage on the sidewalk</em>”.</figcaption></figure><figure><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/62e939ff79009c74307c8d3e/646b35992bb254ea3ad44b68_87c9a5e9.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>Output images with prompt: “<em>luggage in a train station</em>”.</figcaption></figure><p>The benefit of using transformation augmentations is that segmentation masks already exist for the objects, as the same transformations can be easily applied to the original mask.</p><h4>Colour Augmentation with InstructPix2Pix</h4><p>To create even more variation, we can utilize InstructPix2Pix to modify other aspects of the object. InstructPix2Pix is a conditional diffusion method for editing images from human instructions that combines the powers of Stable Diffusion and GPT-3. It is currently not robust enough to make drastic modifications to images without losing semantic information, hence our example will simply be to modify the colour of an object.</p><div><pre><code>

As pointed out by a fellow HackerNews reader, we clearly forgot to include our code snippet for ControlNet in the article.</blockquote><p>ControlNet can be similarly utilized If you wish to have some control over what is being generated, or perform some style transfers to your objects and backgrounds. Any input images can first be preprocessed to generate a Canny edge map, which is then fed into the ControlNet pipeline for directed generation. Further preprocessing may be needed depending on your input image and the level of detail desired for the image generation to be visually realistic.</p><div><pre><code>

There is no universal solution that can reliably work on custom datasets and there is insufficient fine-grained control over how images can be specifically augmented.</p><p>The generation is also not fully automatic since there is a lot of prompt engineering and cherry picking involved, which requires a lot of user intervention and a deeper understanding of the nature of the dataset. Due to the compute power and time necessary to generate these images, it would be impractical to scale up to large dataset generation without investing heavily in dedicated hardware.</p><div>

<p id="subtitle">A protocol for secure browser sessions on the World Wide Web</p>

<p id="date">Last update: <time datetime="2023-06-14">2023-06-14</time></p>
<div>
<p>Note</p>
<p>This is a work in progress, based on my talk at Identiverse 2023. It’s intended
to be a starting point for discussion, not a complete or unambiguous spec.
Please get in touch if you have questions, comments, or suggestions; I’ll
update this page once I find a good locus for further discussion.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction<a href="#introduction" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>WebSession is a proposed replacement for cookies when establishing and
maintaining user sessions in a Web browser. Its goals are to be more secure,
offer more user control, and protect privacy better than cookies, while
remaining fast and easy to implement.</p>
<p>WebSession is separate from authentication protocols like usernames and
passwords, <a href="https://webauthn.guide/">WebAuthn</a>, and <a href="https://openid.net/connect/">OpenID Connect</a>. Those <em>prove</em> who you are;
WebSession is a way for the server to <em>remember</em> who you are across multiple
HTTP requests. WebSession also allows for existing unauthenticated use cases
supported by cookies, where you may not have a user account (or want to log
in), but still need to maintain state across requests. Examples include
anonymous shopping carts and ‘guest’ checkout, personalization without creating
a user account, A/B testing, analytics, and more.</p>
<h2 id="whats-wrong-with-cookies">What’s wrong with cookies?<a href="#whats-wrong-with-cookies" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<h3 id="security">Security<a href="#security" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>Currently when you log into a website, the server generates a unique session
ID and stores it in your browser as a <strong>cookie</strong>. On every subsequent request,
your browser sends this cookie to the server to prove that it’s you making the
request. This cookie, whether a <a href="https://jwt.io/">JWT</a> or opaque session identifier, is called
a <strong>bearer token</strong>, because it grants the holder the right to skip a full
authentication ceremony on every request, and no additional ‘proof’ is required
other than knowledge of the token.</p>
<p>If someone steals this cookie, they can impersonate you. Stolen cookie attacks
have happened in the past <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/7kvkqb/how-ea-games-was-hacked-slack">with disastrous effect</a>, and there
is <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/operation-cookie-monster-international-police-action-seizes-dark-web-market-2023-04-05/">a thriving trade in stolen cookies on the dark web</a>.</p>
<p>Cookies have a large surface area of attack, and little room for error. Secure
use of cookies for tracking a browser session includes, but is not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Setting the <code>Secure</code> flag so they are only sent over secure connections;</li>
<li>Setting the <code>SameSite</code> flag to prevent <abbr title="Cross-Site Request
  Forgery">CSRF</abbr> attacks;</li>
<li>Setting the <code>HttpOnly</code> flag to stop them from being read in JavaScript and/or
  stolen in <abbr title="Cross-Site Scripting">XSS</abbr> attacks;</li>
<li>Setting a reasonable expiry, and enforcing it on the server;</li>
<li>Correctly scoping the domain and path so that only the endpoints that are
  authorized to use the session receive the session cookie;</li>
<li>Ensuring your server does not have any application code that may
  inadvertently reflect a Cookie header back to a client (which would break the
  protection given by <code>HttpOnly</code>);</li>
<li>Ensuring cookies are not inadvertently logged or stored unsafely.</li>
</ul>
<p>Even with all of these, a compromised client, an unsecured application log, or
an eavesdropper on the connection after TLS termination could result in a
cookie being stolen. It is difficult to distinguish an attacker using a stolen
cookie from the legitimate user to whom it was originally issued.</p>
<h3 id="privacy-user-control-and-user-experience">Privacy, User Control, and User Experience<a href="#privacy-user-control-and-user-experience" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>Cookies were invented in 1994, and started out as a generic
mechanism for persistent key-value state which were quickly
adopted to provide authentication too. However as an ad hoc K/V
store, there is nothing reliably distinguishing ‘essential’
(i.e. authentication) cookies from analytics, tracking,
advertising, or preference cookies. As a result of increasingly
strict privacy laws across the world, users are now beset with
<a href="https://cookieinformation.com/cookie-banner/">cookie banners</a> across the Web, with no standard way to
either consent to or reject non-essential cookies.</p>
<p>We need a protocol that is dedicated to session maintenance, that gives control
back to the user either through prior browser configuration or a
consent-on-first-visit model. Browsers could use system-native, accessible UIs
that don’t interrupt content loading or page layout.</p>
<p>It’s also very common that a website wants credentials to be cleared when the
user is inactive for a certain amount of time. This is important for sensitive
applications such as banking and healthcare. Currently there’s no way to
enforce that a cookie is cleared on device lock or user inactivity,
<em>especially</em> because security requires that such cookies not be visible to
JavaScript. A native session management solution should be able to request that
the browser clear a session in the case of device lock, the user navigating
away, etc.</p>
<h2 id="how-would-websession-solve-these-problems">How would WebSession solve these problems?<a href="#how-would-websession-solve-these-problems" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<h3 id="security_1">Security<a href="#security_1" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>WebSession does not rely on bearer tokens. Instead, the browser and server
agree on a shared secret at the beginning of the session, using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffie%E2%80%93Hellman_key_exchange">Diffie-Hellman
key exchange (DHKE)</a>. This secret is never sent over the network, and it
cannot be computed by an eavesdropper, even with full observation of requests
and responses, thanks to the security guarantees of DHKE.</p>
<p>For every request, the browser generates a unique string (aka a ‘nonce’), which
it <em>signs</em> with the shared secret. The nonce and signature are sent with the
request, and the server can then verify that signature, while also checking to
make sure that nonce has not been used before.</p>
<p>WebSession does not treat security as optional, so there are no flags like
<code>Secure</code>, <code>SameSite</code>, or <code>HttpOnly</code> to forget. An endpoint that inadvertently
reflects headers would be useless if the server is tracking nonces properly. A
server-side expiry mechanism is still needed, and domain/path scoping may be
necessary. Even so, if a ‘bad’ endpoint receives a valid WebSession header, it
is limited to forging a single request, rather than having a reusable session
cookie that may allow an unbounded number of impersonated requests.</p>
<h3 id="privacy">Privacy<a href="#privacy" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>WebSession tokens are opaque identifiers, unlinkable back to real-world user
identities. Without extra work, they only identify the browser instance
between requests, not the user.</p>
<p>Because WebSession is dedicated to session maintenance and nothing else, a
client could theoretically reject <em>all</em> cookies on any supporting site, ideally
skipping the jarring cookie banner experience.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the browser-native integration could include things like a request
to clear a session on inactivity, device lock, navigation away from the page,
etc. This is best done via a browser-integrated, purposeful protocol for
session management rather than ad hoc JavaScript on every site.</p>
<h2 id="what-else-could-websession-provide">What else could WebSession provide?<a href="#what-else-could-websession-provide" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>Typically a browser session is identified with a particular human user, and one
of the most exciting new standards on the web today is <a href="https://webauthn.guide/">WebAuthn</a>, which
allows for cryptographically secure user verification. In theory, WebSession
could be extended with options asking the client to use the WebSession derived
secret as the challenge for a WebAuthn assertion. This would provide strong
proof to the server that the session has been established by the authenticated
user, thwarting even active MITM attacks.</p>
<h2 id="protocol-description">Protocol Description<a href="#protocol-description" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<h3 id="initial-request">Initial Request<a href="#initial-request" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>The browser makes a standard GET request to the website. In this case we’ll
assume the URL is <code>https://example.com/</code>.</p>
<h3 id="server-challenge">Server Challenge<a href="#server-challenge" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>The server generates and stores an ephemeral keypair for DHKE, hereby referred
to as <code>Spub</code> and <code>Spriv</code>. This will most likely be a point on the NIST P-256 or
X25519 elliptic curves.</p>
<p>The server then responds to the initial request with a <code>WWW-Authenticate</code>
header with the auth scheme <code>WebSession</code>, followed by a <strong>challenge</strong> as
unpadded <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4648#section-5">base64url</a>-encoded <a href="https://cbor.io/">CBOR</a>. These parameters include:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>alg</code>: an indication of the DHKE algorithm and other parameters.
  For example:</li>
<li><code>P256</code>, <code>P384</code>, <code>P521</code> etc.: ECDH over the corresponding NIST prime curves;</li>
<li><code>X25519</code>, <code>X448</code>: ECDH over Curve25519 and Curve448.
  At a minimum, implementations should support <code>P256</code> and <code>X25519</code>, since these
  are compact, widely available, and provide 128 bits of security.</li>
<li><code>exp</code>: the session expiry, as a UNIX timestamp (seconds since the epoch in
  UTC);</li>
<li><code>h</code>: which hashing algorithm to use for signatures. Must be one of <code>SHA-256</code>,
  <code>SHA-384</code>, or <code>SHA-512</code>.</li>
<li><code>s</code>: the encoding of <code>Spub</code>, specific to <code>alg</code>. Weierstrass curves like
  the NIST prime curves should use the compressed point format; Curve25519 and
  Curve448 points are usually only expressed in compressed form anyway. Since
  we’re using CBOR, these can be included in the object as a raw byte string.</li>
<li>Any as-yet undefined options.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="example">Example<a href="#example" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h4>
<p>The following challenge:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>{</span>
<span>    </span><span>"alg"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"X25519"</span><span>,</span>

<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Would result in this HTTP response:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code>200 OK
WWW-Authenticate: WebSession pGNhbGdmWDI1NTE5Y2V4cBpkdLgUYWhnU0hBLTI1NmFzWCBS4aZQYgwZbwKZMNi-VO-sfLSkf_zASwx3mbS-5fAoyA
</code></pre></div>
<h3 id="client-response">Client Response<a href="#client-response" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>At this point the browser can decide whether to initiate a session or not,
either based on interactive user feedback, previous behavior, or prior
configuration. If no session is desired, the client simply doesn’t respond to
the challenge, and continues making requests as usual. The rest of this
document assumes a session is desired.</p>
<ul>
<li>The client generates its own keypair, scoped to the origin (hereafter <code>Cpub</code>
  and <code>Cpriv</code>);</li>
<li>It derives a shared secret, using DH between <code>Spub</code> and <code>Cpriv</code>, and then
  applying <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HKDF">HKDF</a> on the resulting bytes (with the hashing algorithm <code>h</code>
  requested by the server earlier);</li>
<li>It chooses a 32-byte secure random nonce;</li>
<li>It builds a token <strong>body</strong> as a CBOR object containing:</li>
<li><code>s</code>: the server public key;</li>
<li><code>c</code>: the client public key;</li>
<li><code>o</code>: the origin;</li>
<li><code>n</code>: the nonce.</li>
<li>It produces a <strong>signature</strong> by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMAC">HMAC</a>ing the token body using the shared secret
  as the key;</li>
<li>Finally, it constructs an ASCII token by unpadded base64url-encoding the
  signature and body and then concatenating them with a ‘.’ character.</li>
</ul>
<p>In Python pseudocode:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>c_pub</span><span>,</span> <span>c_priv</span> <span>=</span> <span>gen_keypair</span><span>()</span>
<span>shared_secret</span> <span>=</span> <span>hkdf</span><span>(</span><span>dh</span><span>(</span><span>c_priv</span><span>,</span> <span>s_pub</span><span>))</span>
<span>nonce</span> <span>=</span> <span>secrets</span><span>.</span><span>token_bytes</span><span>(</span><span>32</span><span>)</span>

    <span>'o'</span><span>:</span> <span>'https://example.com'</span><span>,</span>

</code></pre></div>
<p>This token is then included in the next client request in the <code>Authorization</code>
header, with an auth scheme of <code>WebSession</code>. For example:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code>GET / HTTP/1.1
Authorization: WebSession 8qbsNWTO9bWTSSKPy6anrZ0wFS_OCLpBU6z8sMCYIXc.pGFjWCECti-THEz2E5V2GVho6BlS4hYCc2iSIQM3OAigEOIPqrRhc1ghAtuVyC-gkXNvLDiI3EX3vsoKr3LouSNokIwh2kbEr636YW9zaHR0cHM6Ly9leGFtcGxlLmNvbWFuWCCOCJPacqTehDoux9VHjkZW_1r9lqV2gWIjK81uhqCOqg
</code></pre></div>
<h3 id="server-validation">Server Validation<a href="#server-validation" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>The server validates an incoming request by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Splitting the token signature and body at the ‘.’ character and base64url-decoding them;</li>
<li>CBOR-parsing the body to extract <code>Cpub</code>, <code>Spub</code>, <code>origin</code> and <code>nonce</code>;</li>
<li>Looking up the corresponding <code>Spriv</code> for the session;</li>
<li>Deriving the same shared secret, using <code>Cpub</code> and <code>Spriv</code> and HKDF;</li>
<li>The shared secret may be cached for subsequent requests against the same
    <code>Spub</code> and <code>Spriv</code>; if it is not cached, the server MUST validate that the
    included <code>Cpub</code> does not change across requests.</li>
<li>Validating that the nonce has not been used already for this session.
  <strong>Important:</strong> at this point, the nonce should be added to the ‘seen’ set,
  because nonces should be invalidated whether the signature validation passes
  or fails. Failure to do so can allow attackers to brute-force a valid
  signature for a single nonce.</li>
<li>(Recommended) validating the origin is as expected;</li>
<li>Computing the HMAC over the provided token body and checking the signature.
  <strong>Note</strong>: it’s important to use a constant-time comparison function for the
  signature checking. Many crypto libraries have a ‘verify’ function which will
  do this, rather than computing the signature as a string and checking for
  equality.</li>
</ul>
<p>In Python pseudocode:</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-first_letter="O">
		<p>One of the most distinctive features of Apple silicon chips is that they have two types of CPU core, E (Efficiency) cores that are energy efficient but slower than the P (Performance) cores, which normally run much of the code in the apps we use. Apps don’t decide directly which cores they will be run on, that’s a privilege of macOS, but they register their interest by setting a Quality of Service, or QoS, which is then taken into account when they’re scheduled to run. With the introduction of <a href="https://eclecticlight.co/2023/10/18/how-game-mode-manages-cpu-and-gpu/">Game Mode</a> in Sonoma, CPU scheduling can now work differently, with E cores being reserved for the use of games. This article looks at another atypical situation, when running a macOS virtual machine (VM) assigned a set number of virtual cores. How does macOS Sonoma handle that?</p>
<h4>CPU cores</h4>
<p>M-series chips contain different types and numbers of CPU cores, depending on the model:</p>
<ul>
<li>Base models contain 4 E and 4 P cores; for the M1, those are Icestorm and Firestorm respectively, while the M2 has Blizzard and Avalanche. These are configured in two clusters, one containing the E cores, the other the P cores. Within each cluster, all cores are run at the same frequency, and they share L2 cache.</li>
<li>Pro and Max models contain 2-4 E and 6-8 P cores, in one E cluster and two P clusters, again running at a common frequency within the cluster, and sharing L2 cache.</li>
<li>Ultra models contain 4 (M1) or 8 (M2) E and 16 P cores, their clusters having common frequencies and L2 caches.</li>
</ul>
<p>In broad terms, allocation of executable threads to different cores depends on:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>QoS</strong> assigned to each thread. Those given low values for background and maintenance tasks, including Time Machine backups and Spotlight indexing, are run on E cores, and have no external control to allow their rescheduling to P cores. Those with higher QoS can be run on either P or E cores, and external controls can restrict them to E cores alone, although they’ll normally be run on P cores when they’re available.</li>
<li><strong>Clustering</strong>. Because all cores in a cluster run at the same frequency, it’s more efficient to recruit additional cores in the same cluster, as they’ll already be running at a higher frequency, rather than a core in a different cluster, whose frequency may then need to be increased. Clusters are normally recruited in sequence too: in Macs with two P clusters, threads are normally run on the first of those (P0), and only when additional cores are required is the second (P1) recruited. Running with a light load, P0 is therefore likely to be more active than other P clusters, which may spend long periods idling.</li>
<li><strong>Order</strong> within a cluster. Although applied more loosely than other principles, there is an observed tendency to recruit cores in order within a cluster. Where the P0 cluster contains cores P2, P3, P4 and P5, threads tend to be loaded onto P2 first, and P5 last. However, running threads are often relocated within a cluster, following which P2 may be left idle, while P5 bears the brunt.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thread scheduling and dispatch contains many more subtleties, but those influences normally dominate what you see in practice.</p>
<h4>Virtual CPU cores</h4>
<p>Under macOS lightweight virtualisation, virtual machines (VMs) are allocated a number of virtual CPU cores, all of which are the same type, equivalent to a P core. There is thus no option to allocate threads running in the VM to E cores on the host. This is illustrated in the following examples shown in Activity Monitor’s CPU History window.</p>

<p>Two different loads were applied to the M1 Max shown here: the two long peaks seen on the E cores were floating-point threads at a QoS of 9 for a background task, while the shorter peaks on four P cores were the same threads at a QoS of 33 for priority user tasks.</p>

<p>On the host, both thread loads were run similarly on the first cluster of P cores. This might suggest that the host simply hands over the cluster of P cores to be scheduled and dispatched by the VM. If you rely on what you’re shown in Activity Monitor, you could be tempted to reach that conclusion.</p>
<h4>Methods</h4>
<p>To assess core allocation for VMs, I used a Mac Studio M1 Max running Sonoma 14.0. A Sonoma 14.0 VM was built using Viable, and run during tests using that virtualisation app. Test loads were applied from the VM using my app AsmAttic, each thread running 5 x 10^8 tight loops of purposeless assembly code performing floating point arithmetic using registers alone. I detailed <a href="https://eclecticlight.co/2021/11/26/how-can-you-compare-the-performance-of-m1-chips-2-core-allocation/">this here</a>. Each thread typically takes about 3.2 seconds to complete, and serves here as an in-core load, not a benchmark. During each of those runs, <code>powermetrics</code> was run on the host to log <code>cpu_power</code> measurements over 0.1 second sampling periods. Frequency and active residency for all the cores was then extracted and analysed using DataGraph. Test runs included the same VM configured with 3 and 4 virtual cores, and with 1-6 threads, all at a QoS of 33.</p>
<h4>Single threads</h4>

<p>Running a single thread on three or four virtual cores resulted in the expected rapid change in P0 cluster frequency (above), and in active residency (percentage of available processor cycles that aren’t idle), shown below. As this gives total active residency for the whole cluster of four cores, its maximum is 400%. Although there are small peaks above the expected 100% for a single thread, those were probably threads from other processes.</p>

<p>As the number of threads run on the VM increases, so the number of cores running them rises to the limit imposed by the number of virtual cores. Looking first at the effect on host clusters, these might imply that VM threads are confined to the single P cluster, P0.</p>

<p>This chart shows cluster frequencies for the three clusters in the M1 Max. The test load was applied just after 1 second, and was completed at about 4 seconds, matching the reported elapsed time of about 3.2 seconds. P0 frequency (solid line) rose rapidly to just over 3,000 MHz, and was sustained at that until completion. The other P cluster (P1) was run much of that time at its idle of 600 MHz, with short peaks up to 2,500 MHz. The E cluster was run throughout at about 1,000 MHz, with fewer and smaller peaks.</p>

<p>Here, to enable easier comparison, cluster active residency is shown with a scale maximum of 100% for each of the three clusters. The effect of the load on P0 active residency (solid line) dominates much as it did for frequency, but there are also many smaller and briefer peaks. To unravel what those represent, you need to analyse individual core responses.</p>
<h4>Individual P cores</h4>
<p>A simple starting point is analysing the active residency in P0 by individual core, for a single thread test.</p>
<p><span><img data-attachment-id="75512" data-permalink="https://eclecticlight.co/vm3core1thractresbycore/" data-orig-file="https://eclecticlightdotcom.files.wordpress.com/2023/10/vm3core1thractresbycore.png" data-orig-size="1050,850" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="vm3core1thrActResByCore" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://eclecticlightdotcom.files.wordpress.com/2023/10/vm3core1thractresbycore.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://eclecticlightdotcom.files.wordpress.com/2023/10/vm3core1thractresbycore.png?w=940" loading="lazy" src="https://eclecticlightdotcom.files.wordpress.com/2023/10/vm3core1thractresbycore.png?w=940" alt="vm3core1thrActResByCore" srcset="https://eclecticlightdotcom.files.wordpress.com/2023/10/vm3core1thractresbycore.png 1050w, https://eclecticlightdotcom.files.wordpress.com/2023/10/vm3core1thractresbycore.png?w=150&amp;h=121 150w, https://eclecticlightdotcom.files.wordpress.com/2023/10/vm3core1thractresbycore.png?w=300&amp;h=243 300w, https://eclecticlightdotcom.files.wordpress.com/2023/10/vm3core1thractresbycore.png?w=768&amp;h=622 768w, https://eclecticlightdotcom.files.wordpress.com/2023/10/vm3core1thractresbycore.png?w=1024&amp;h=829 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1050px) 100vw, 1050px"></span></p>
<p>This bar chart shows just the test period, here as sample number rather than time (each sample representing approximately 0.1 second). Active residency for the first core, P2, is shown in red, P3 in orange, P4 in blue, and P5 in purple. The bulk of the test thread was run on P2 to begin with, swapped over to P4, then brought back to P2 to complete. There are, though, significant contributions made by P3 as well.</p>
<p>Extending this analysis to other thread numbers, and 4 virtual cores, demonstrated that all cores in the P0 were used to run the test threads, which were moved around not infrequently during each test run.</p>

<p>It’s only when you look at active residency across all P cores that the picture becomes clear: when the second P cluster is active, it appears to be handling some of the test load. This shows active residency for all eight P cores, when running 4 threads on 4 virtual cores. To maintain the 400% required to complete the threads on time, there are several sample periods in which P6 and P7 take significant load, for example in samples 12 and 27, about 1 and 2.5 seconds into the test.</p>
<p>Core allocation of threads being run on virtual cores thus appears to follow the same general rules as host threads running at high QoS, and shows no particular affinity for clusters or cores. Thus virtualisation isn’t a different mode, as far as core allocation is concerned.</p>
<h4>Conclusions</h4>
<ul>
<li>Threads from VM virtual cores are invariably run at high QoS, and are scheduled and dispatched by the host macOS in accordance with its normal rules. Virtualisation doesn’t bring any special core allocation or CPU performance mode.</li>
<li>Those threads are mobile across cores as with any other thread.</li>
<li>There’s no evidence that macOS makes any attempt to allocate virtual cores to physical cores.</li>
<li>Software in a VM has no means of designating that any of its threads should be run at lower QoS, or on host E cores. VMs thus lack energy efficiency and background performance advantages of macOS running on an Apple silicon host.</li>
</ul>

</p></figure>







<p>In a shocking turn of events, several smartphone manufacturers, including industry giant Samsung, have taken a drastic step that has left customers outraged. These companies have remotely disabled phones purchased through gray markets, effectively holding the users’ data hostage until they buy new phones from official retailers. This unethical practice has raised questions about consumer rights, the role of governments, and the level of control that manufacturers can exert over devices.</p>







<p><strong>Gray Market Phones in Mexico</strong></p>



<p>Many people in countries like Mexico often purchase gray market phones due to economic constraints. These devices are not stolen but are originally intended for other regions. They work perfectly well in their new homes, providing cost-effective alternatives to official store purchases.</p>



<p>However, users of these gray market phones in Mexico started receiving alarming messages on their devices. These messages warned them that their devices would be disabled for not complying with Mexican regulations, and they were urged to buy approved devices. Such messages appeared on phones from various manufacturers, but Samsung was the most aggressive in its approach.</p>











<p><strong>Samsung’s Heavy-Handed Approach</strong></p>



<p>Samsung’s actions were particularly egregious. Not only did they send messages regarding non-compliance with Mexican regulations, but they also remotely disabled users’ phones, rendering them virtually useless. This move was far from the expected outcome – if a device truly posed safety risks, it should have been switched off completely. Instead, Samsung allowed the devices to turn on but denied users access to their data and applications.</p>











<p><strong>Battery Voltage and Charging Safety Claims</strong></p>



<p>To justify their actions, Samsung cited battery voltage and charging safety as the reasons for disabling these devices. They claimed that these devices were approved for correct charging and safe use within Mexico, which was far from the truth. In reality, Samsung uses the same battery voltage in all regions, and they even stopped including chargers in the box, further undermining their own argument.</p>











<p><strong>Environmental Concerns and Manufacturer Greed</strong></p>



<p>Samsung’s dubious explanation is an attempt to greenwash their actions by framing them as environmentally conscious decisions. The reality, however, is that they are using these claims to extract more money from consumers. This is not about safety or the environment; it’s about profit.</p>











<p><strong>Government Response and Consumer Backlash</strong></p>



<p>The Mexican government swiftly responded to these unethical actions, siding with consumers’ rights. On October 19, the Federal Consumer Protection Agency (PROFECO) and the Federal Institute of Telecommunications (IFT) issued a suspension against manufacturers who had disabled these mobile devices, as they had violated consumer rights by blocking imported phones. Motorola and Samsung, the main culprits, had to cease their actions immediately and issued statements agreeing to cooperate with the Mexican government to find a solution.</p>











<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>



<p>This incident serves as a wake-up call for consumers and highlights the importance of protecting our digital rights. Manufacturers should not have the power to remotely disable devices that consumers have legitimately purchased. It’s a gross violation of trust, privacy, and consumer rights.</p>



<p>While some companies like Xiaomi opted for a more user-friendly approach by sending messages but not disabling devices, others like Samsung resorted to extreme measures, leaving users stranded with locked devices. This raises important questions about who controls the devices we own and how they can be used against us.</p>



<p>As consumers, it’s essential to remain vigilant, advocate for our rights, and support government agencies that stand up against unethical practices. In this case, the Mexican government’s swift response demonstrated the power of collective action in safeguarding consumer rights. Samsung and other manufacturers must be held accountable for their actions, and consumers should be cautious when dealing with companies that prioritize profit over ethical conduct.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>The index is a good predictor of whether a company will raise a round, says Konstantin Vinogradov, a general partner at Runa. Around a third of all the companies listed in the index since its <a data-offer-url="https://runacap.com/ross-index/" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://runacap.com/ross-index/&quot;}" href="https://runacap.com/ross-index/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">launch in 2020</a> have raised subsequent rounds within the next 12 months, he says.</p><p>Over time, metrics can invalidate themselves, says Stuart Geiger, an assistant professor at UC San Diego. He says two “laws” attributed to social scientists sum up why: The more a metric is used in decisionmaking, the more it will be manipulated (<a data-offer-url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campbell%27s_law" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campbell%27s_law&quot;}" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campbell%27s_law" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Campbell’s law</a>), and a metric that becomes a target ceases to be useful (<a data-offer-url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodhart%27s_law" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodhart%27s_law&quot;}" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodhart%27s_law" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Goodhart’s law</a>).</p><p>The line between smart strategy and cheating can be blurry. “If a company becomes number one on Product Hunt, they put it on their website, then maybe it will increase their conversion rate for customers,” says Vinogradov. “Is it just winning the game? Or is it a business-driven, reasonable strategy?”</p><p>Kevin Zhang, a former venture investor now building his own startup, says GitHub stars have seemed to become a target for entrepreneurs looking to impress. “I started noticing that founders were putting more star growth on their decks,” he says. “That always gives you a little bit of suspicion right? Oh, maybe it’s a little bit gamed.”</p><p>But Zhang and other investors say that while gaming a metric like stars might help a startup get a first meeting with VCs, it’s unlikely to get them a second. Investor perspectives on GitHub metrics have changed in recent years as a result of gamification and an increased understanding of the open source market, Zhang says. Good GitHub engagement is one promising signal, but it's not a bulletproof sign of success, Zhang, Vinogradov, and Aiyagari all say, with information on the founding team, market, and many other data points all considered before making an investment.</p><p>Cryptocurrency Preferred</p><p><a data-offer-url="https://baddhi.shop/shop/" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://baddhi.shop/shop/&quot;}" href="https://baddhi.shop/shop/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Baddhi Shop</a>, an online store offering inauthentic metrics, rolled out its GitHub services earlier this year. It also sells Product Hunt upvotes, as well as upvotes, followers, and views on Kaggle. When WIRED sent messages to the LinkedIn account of the site’s founder, Naga Durgarao Baddhi, responses came back claiming the business was aboveboard.</p><p>When an order comes in for GitHub stars or another metric, a team of 11 get clicking, “from different cloud devices,” Baddhi said, adding that this wasn’t spam because the shop respects each website's terms of service. GitHub is not the most popular metric-cheating offering, Baddhi added. Discord, a chat room service popular with crypto projects, gets daily purchases, and metrics for 10 other services are also popular, Baddhi says. Kellyn Slone, a spokesperson for Discord, says creating or selling fake accounts violates its terms of service, and it takes action in response, including removing users from the service.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="storywrap-423673">


<h3>from the <i>not-cool</i> dept</h3>

<p>It’s pretty much the way of the world: beyond the basic <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.techdirt.com/tag/enshittification/" target="_blank">enshittification</a> story that has been so well told over the past year or so about how companies get worse and worse as they get more and more powerful, there’s also the well known concept of successful innovative companies “pulling up the ladder” behind them, using the regulatory process to make it impossible for other companies to follow their own path to success. We’ve talked about this in the sense of <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.techdirt.com/2011/02/03/entrepreneurs-who-create-value-vs-entrepreneurs-who-lock-up-value/" target="_blank"><em>political entrepreneurship</em></a>, which is when the main entrepreneurial effort is not to innovate in newer and better products for customers, but rather using the political system for personal gain and to prevent competitors from havng the same opportunities.</p>
<p>It happens all too frequently. And it’s been happening lately with the big internet companies, which relied on the open internet to become successful, but under massive pressure from regulators (and the media), keep shooting the open internet in the back, each time they can present themselves as “supportive” of some dumb regulatory regime. Facebook did it six years ago by <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.techdirt.com/2017/11/08/will-sheryl-sandberg-facebook-help-small-websites-threatened-sesta/" target="_blank">supporting FOSTA wholeheartedly</a>, which was the key tide shift that made the law viable in Congress.</p>
<p>And, now, it appears that Google is going down that same path. There have been hints here and there, such as when it mostly <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.techdirt.com/2017/04/14/dont-wait-google-netflix-facebooks-help-if-you-want-to-save-net-neutrality/" target="_blank">gave up the fight</a> on net neutrality six years ago. However, Google had still appeared to be active in various fights to protect an open internet. </p>
<p>But, last week, Google took a big step towards pulling up the open internet ladder behind it, which got almost no coverage (and what coverage it got was misleading). And, for the life of me, I don’t understand why it chose to do this now. It’s one of the dumbest policy moves I’ve seen Google make in ages, and seems like a complete unforced error.</p>
<p>Last Monday, Google announced “<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/public-policy/google-legislation-framework-children-teens-safety/" target="_blank">a policy framework to protect children and teens online</a>,” which was echoed by subsidiary YouTube, which posted basically the same thing, talking about it’s “<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://blog.youtube/inside-youtube/youtubes-principled-approach-children-teenagers/" target="_blank">principled approach for children and teenagers</a>.” Both of these pushed not just a “principled approach” for companies to take, but <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/publicpolicy.google/en//resources/youth-legislative-framework.pdf" target="_blank">a legislative model</a> (and I hear that they’re out pushing “model bills” across legislatures as well).</p>
<p>The “legislative” model is, effectively, California’s Age Appropriate Design Code. Yes, the very law that was<a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.techdirt.com/2023/09/19/court-says-californias-age-appropriate-design-code-is-unconstitutional-just-as-we-warned/"> just declared unconstitutional</a> just a few weeks before Google basically threw its weight behind the approach. What’s funny is that many, many people have (incorrectly) believed that Google was some sort of legal mastermind behind the NetChoice lawsuits challenging California’s law and other similar laws, when the reality appears to be that Google knows full well that it can handle the requirements of the law, but smaller competitors cannot. Google likes the law. It wants more of them, apparently.</p>
<p>The model includes “age assurance” (which is effectively age verification, though everyone pretends it’s not), greater parental surveillance, and the compliance nightmare of “impact assessments” (we <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.techdirt.com/2022/08/24/dear-california-law-makers-how-the-hell-can-i-comply-with-your-new-age-appropriate-design-code/" target="_blank">talked about this nonsense</a> in relation to the California law). <strong>Again, for many companies this is a good idea</strong>. But just because something is a good idea for companies to do <em>does not mean</em> that it should be mandated by law.</p>
<p>But that’s exactly what Google is pushing for here, even as a law that more or less mimics its framework was just found to be unconstitutional. While cynical people will say that maybe Google is supporting these policies hoping that they will continue to be found unconstitutional, I see little evidence to support that. Instead, it really sounds like Google is fully onboard with these kinds of duty of care regulations that will harm smaller competitors, but which Google can handle just fine.</p>
<p>It’s pulling up the ladder behind it.</p>
<p>And yet, the press coverage of this focused on the fact that this was being presented as an “alternative” to a full on ban for kids under 18 to be on social media. The Verge <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/16/23919221/google-youtube-child-safety-age-verification-laws-privacy" target="_blank">framed this </a>as “Google asks Congress not to ban teens from social media,” leaving out that it was Google asking Congress to basically make it impossible for any site other than the largest, richest companies to be able to allow teens on social media. Same thing with TechCrunch, which framed it as Google <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/10/16/google-lobbies-against-legally-mandated-age-verification-for-minors/" target="_blank">lobbying against age verification</a>.</p>
<p>But… it’s not? It’s basically lobbying for age verification, just in the guise of “age assurance,” which is effectively “age verification, but if you’re a smaller company you can get it wrong some undefined amount of time, until someone sues you.” I mean, what’s here is not “lobbying against age verification,” it’s basically saying “here’s how to require age verification.”</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>A good understanding of user age can help online services offer age-appropriate experiences. That said, any method to determine the age of users across services comes with tradeoffs, such as intruding on privacy interests, requiring more data collection and use, or restricting adult users’ access to important information and services. Where required, age assurance – which can range from declaration to inference and verification – should be risk-based, preserving users’ access to information and services, and respecting their privacy. Where legislation mandates age assurance, it should do so through a workable, interoperable standard that preserves the potential for anonymous or pseudonymous experiences. It should avoid requiring collection or processing of additional personal information, treating all users like children, or impinging on the ability of adults to access information. More data-intrusive methods (such as verification with “hard identifiers” like government IDs) should be limited to high-risk services (e.g., alcohol, gambling, or pornography) or age correction. Moreover, age assurance requirements should permit online services to explore and adapt to improved technological approaches. In particular, requirements should enable new, privacy-protective ways to ensure users are at least the required age before engaging in certain activities. Finally, because age assurance technologies are novel, imperfect, and evolving, requirements should provide reasonable protection from liability for good-faith efforts to develop and implement improved solutions in this space.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Much like Facebook caving on FOSTA, this is Google caving on age verification and other “duty of care” approaches to regulating the way kids have access to the internet. It’s pulling up the ladder behind itself, knowing that it was able to grow without having to take these steps, and making sure that none of the up-and-coming challenges to Google’s position will have the same freedom to do so.</p>
<p>And, for what? So that Google can go to regulators and say “look, we’re not against regulations, here’s our framework”? But Google has smart policy people. They have to know how this plays out in reality. Just as with FOSTA, it completely backfired on Facebook (and the open internet). This approach will do the same.</p>
<p>Not only will these laws inevitably be used against the companies themselves, they’ll also be weaponized and modified by policymakers who will make them even worse and even more dangerous, all while pointing to Google’s “blessing” of this approach as an endorsement.</p>
<p>For years, Google had been somewhat unique in continuing to fight for the open internet long after many other companies were switching over to ladder pulling. There were hints that Google was going down this path in the past, but with this policy framework, the company has now made it clear that it has no intention of being a friend to the open internet any more.</p>

Theora's low (and now often incorrect) usage no longer justifies support for most users.

Notes:
- Zero day attacks against media codecs have spiked.
- Usage has fallen below measurable levels in UKM.
- The sites we manually inspected before levels dropped off were incorrectly preferring Theora over more modern codecs like VP9.
- It's never been supported by Safari or Chrome on Android.
- An ogv.js polyfill exists for the sites that still need Theora support.
- We are not removing support for ogg containers.

Our plan is to begin escalating experiments turning down Theora support in M120. During this time users can reactivate Theora support via chrome://flags/#theora-video-codec if needed.

The tentative timeline for this is (assuming everything goes smoothly):
- ~Oct 23, 2023: begin 50/50 canary dev experiments.
- ~Nov 1-6, 2023: begin 50/50 beta experiments.
- ~Dec 6, 2023: begin 1% stable experiments.
- ~Jan 8, 2024: begin 50% stable experiments.
- ~Jan 16th, 2024: launch at 100%.
- ~Feb 2024: remove code and chrome://flag in M123.
- ~Mar 2024: Chrome 123 will roll to stable.</p><h4>Blink component</h4><p><a href="https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/list?q=component:Internals%3EMedia%3ECodecs" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en-US&amp;q=https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/list?q%3Dcomponent:Internals%253EMedia%253ECodecs&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1698220805824000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3k0M7DYiTnjo0Pq3MO-yBO">Internals&gt;Media&gt;Codecs</a><span></span></p><h4>Search tags</h4><p><a href="https://chromestatus.com/features#tags:theora" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en-US&amp;q=https://chromestatus.com/features%23tags:theora&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1698220805824000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3AoLWgJu8RZ7v4ebtq-bwL">theora</a><span>,&nbsp;</span><a href="https://chromestatus.com/features#tags:vp3" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en-US&amp;q=https://chromestatus.com/features%23tags:vp3&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1698220805824000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0V0kpfFI4GsOcpd72BpsAB">vp3</a><span>,&nbsp;</span><a href="https://chromestatus.com/features#tags:video" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en-US&amp;q=https://chromestatus.com/features%23tags:video&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1698220805825000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2GJqSSKExSwXaeuNaTrtxa">video</a><span></span></p><h4>TAG review</h4><p><span>None</span></p><h4>TAG review status</h4><p><span>Not applicable</span></p><h4>Risks</h4><div><h4>Interoperability and Compatibility</h4><p>Sites which only provide a Theora video source will no longer have video playback.

<h3>TL;DR</h3>



<p><strong>Cascade</strong> is a RISC-V CPU fuzzer that generates <strong>valid</strong>, <strong>long</strong> and <strong>complex</strong> programs, and relies on a termination cascade-effect for bug detection. It detected 37 <strong>new</strong> bugs (29 new CVEs) in 5 RISC-V CPUs, which is more than all the existing fuzzers, combined. You can read a paper we wrote on Cascade <a href="https://comsec.ethz.ch/wp-content/files/cascade_sec24.pdf">here</a> and try it out <a href="https://github.com/comsec-group/cascade-artifacts">here</a>. Below is a video demo of it finding a bug in CVA6:</p>

</p></figure>



<h2>Motivation</h2>



<p>Fuzzing CPUs is akin to generating interesting programs, and observing expressions of buggy behaviors. An effective CPU fuzzing campaign must have some fundamental properties.</p>



<ul>
<li>Programs must be long to increase fuzzing throughput.</li>



<li>Programs must be complex to increase the probability of triggering a bug.</li>



<li>The fuzzer must reliably and efficiently detect bugs, once triggered.</li>
</ul>



<h2>Pitfalls of existing fuzzers</h2>



<p>Existing CPU fuzzers do not comply with these fundamental properties. Fuzzers may have the following shortcomings:</p>



<ul>
<li>Programs are short by design with trivial control flows.</li>



<li>The executed portion of the programs are short because the control flow is poorly managed.</li>



<li>Most instructions are not randomized and correspond to initialization and finalization.</li>



<li>Only a small part of the ISA is covered.</li>



<li>The CPU state is checked at instruction granularity, significantly impacting the fuzzing performance.</li>



<li>Bugs have a high chance of being shadowed because their expression is eventually overwritten in the control flow.</li>
</ul>



<p>Ultimately, a fuzzer with such pitfalls will suffer from critical weaknesses which will likely make fuzzing campaigns ineffective or inefficient.</p>







<p>Cascade is a RISC-V CPU fuzzer that generates valid, long and complex programs, and relies on a cascade-effect termination for bug detection. Fuzzing proceeds as follows:</p>



<ul>
<li>Intermediate program construction: First, Cascade builds an intermediate program with complex data and control flows, the latter being independent of the former.</li>



<li>Ultimate program construction: Cascade simulates the program using a golden model of the ISA to collect feedback about the behavior of the data flow. From this feedback, it entangles the data flow into the control flow to build the ultimate version of the program.</li>



<li>Ultimate program execution: Cascade executes the program on the CPU under test. Non-terminations indicate that a bug has been triggered by a program.</li>
</ul>



<p>Below you can see a design diagram of Cascade:</p>

<h2>Bug detection</h2>



<p>A common but unsatisfying way of detecting whether a bug has been triggered is to compare, instruction by instruction, whether the CPU state matches with the golden model state. This method is difficult to implement and expensive in terms of performance.</p>



<p>In Cascade-generated programs, due to the entanglement of data and control flow, a bug in the data flow will have a very high chance of altering the control flow, causing non-termination.</p>



<h2>Asynchronous ISA pre-simulation</h2>



<p>To transform an intermediate program into an ultimate program, i.e., to entangle the data flow into the control flow, Cascade uses the feedback from spike, a golden model of the RISC-V ISA to determine some <em>dependent</em> register values generated by critical points in the program. Knowing these values allows correcting them at a later point of the program to achieve the same control-flow and exceptional behavior as in the intermediate program, while entangling the data flow into the control flow. While there may be many dependent values and control-flow changes in a program, we show that a single careful execution of the ISA golden model suffices to entangle the data flow into the control flow at all points of the program.</p>



<h2>Reduction of buggy programs</h2>



<p>Cascade found tens of new bugs, but the programs that trigger them are long and complex. Cascade features a new mechanism that reduces bug-triggering programs into very few instructions, while preserving the bug-preserving behavior. Here is the Cascade’s bug reduction mechanism in action:</p>

</p></figure>



<h2>Discovered vulnerabilities</h2>



<p>Cascade found 37 new bugs (29 new CVEs) in 5 RISC-V CPUs. We reported them to their respective maintainers and fixed some of them ourselves. The discovered bugs have many security implications, ranging from information leakage to denial of service from user mode by a specific operation executed under speculation. Please look at the <a href="https://comsec.ethz.ch/wp-content/files/cascade_sec24.pdf">paper</a> if you want to know more about the bugs. The figure below summarizes the security impact of these bugs:</p>

<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>



<p><strong>Cascade found many bugs. Is RISC-V insecure?<br></strong>Given today’s highly manual RTL design flows, the appearance of bugs is very likely, regardless of the ISA. Note that more than 1000 errata were released in Intel Core and AMD CPUs in recent years (see <a href="https://comsec.ethz.ch/research/hardware-design-security/rememberr/">RemembERR</a>). Hence, from Cascade’s findings, there is no reason to consider RISC-V to be inherently less secure than other ISAs.</p>



<p><strong>I am a consumer, should I worry that Cascade finds bugs in my CPU?</strong><br>At the time of this writing, RISC-V CPUs in commodity computers are rather uncommon. Hence, Cascade will hopefully find the bugs before a CPU is mass-produced.</p>



<p><strong>Is Cascade only for RISC-V?</strong><br>Yes. While some ideas like AIPS can be ported to other mainstream ISAs, Cascade is at the moment implemented only for RISC-V.</p>



<p><strong>Can I use Cascade in CI/CD?</strong><br>Yes! On a reasonable server, Cascade finds many bugs in a matter of seconds, hence it is perfectly suited for quick checks as well as long runs.</p>



<p><strong>After fixing all the reported bugs, my CPU is now validated by Cascade. Is my CPU now perfectly safe and functional?</strong><br>No, Cascade does not offer formal guarantees. You may want to turn to formal methods for such guarantees, but they require more expertise and effort.</p>



<p><strong>What RISC-V extensions are currently being fuzzed by Cascade?<br></strong>Cascade fuzzes rv[32-64]imfd, including exceptions, MSU privilege transitions and many CSR interactions. We plan to add new fuzzing features such as memory virtualization and compressed instructions in the future. Feel free to contribute?</p>



<p><strong>How can I contribute to Cascade?</strong><br>Just open a pull request on <a href="https://github.com/comsec-group/cascade-artifacts">github</a> and we will have a look.</p>

  <p>By <a href="https://github.com/ocdtrekkie">Jacob Weisz</a>
    
    - 23 Oct 2023
  </p><p>Over the last couple of months, we have had a lot of people asking for an update on
the project. We’ve had to take a bit of time for self-care before putting together
our plans going forward, culminating in this update.</p>

<p><em>Note: Astute observers may notice this blog is on a new domain, sandstorm.org,
along with subtle changes to this version of the website. We will discuss why and
how this will impact our plans next week.</em></p>

<h2 id="remembering-ian-denhardt">Remembering Ian Denhardt</h2>

<p>As people closely following the project may already be aware, about three months
ago one of our core project contributors, <a href="https://github.com/zenhack">Ian Denhardt</a>, sadly and unexpectedly
passed away. It is impossible to overstate the significance of Ian’s contributions
to this project, from maintaining and fixing bugs in Sandstorm itself, to packaging,
re-packaging, and building a number of apps and tools, to starting a next-generation
platform for Sandstorm (more on this below). Ian has ultimately been the <em>primary</em>
contributor to our ecosystem as a whole for the past three years.</p>

<p>Ian was an incredibly gifted developer whose projects spanned from calendaring apps
and backup tools to operating system kernels and programming languages. But far more
than that, Ian was an incredibly humble and kind mentor and friend. Countless times
he helped me with problems that came down to something close to “How do I navigate a
Linux machine” without a hint of irritation. Steve Pomeroy <a href="https://staticfree.info/ian/">shared a story</a> about
Ian recently that exemplified the sort of thought and <em>care</em> that he put into
everything that he did.</p>

<p>We intend to honor Ian’s memory and vision by carrying forward his work and ensuring
that we continue to make self-hosting viable for everyone.</p>

<h2 id="introducing-tempest">Introducing Tempest</h2>

<p>Since late last year, Ian had been working heavily on an experimental alternative
software to run Sandstorm apps that we refer to as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230728221625/https://zenhack.net/2023/01/06/introducing-tempest.html">Tempest</a>. Tempest is a modern
take on the Sandstorm platform, supporting existing apps but dropping various
long-disused compatibility shims and embracing modern technologies and expectations.
It is written in Go, which is significantly more accessible to volunteer development
than Meteor and C++. Another key feature is the use of WASM to allow the client side
of the platform to also be written in Go and run Cap’n Proto directly in the browser.</p>

<p>Whereas Sandstorm was built with organization or SaaS provider scale as a focus,
Tempest development was planned with individual or small community use at the
forefront. One of the major goals Ian had intended to strive for with Tempest was the
ability to communicate with decentralized communication networks like ActivityPub and
Matrix, which has proven challenging for Sandstorm thus far.</p>

<p>As of this post, Tempest can run many Sandstorm apps and can import grains directly
from a Sandstorm install. However, it is still far from being a production-usable
application, and a lot of important API features for apps like external network access
and web publishing are not implemented.</p>

<p>Multiple community members have stepped forward in the past two months to let us know
that they would like to continue development of Tempest including Troy Farrell and Dan
Krol. We plan to bring the <a href="https://github.com/troyjfarrell/tempest">current work</a> on the project under the Sandstorm
organization to coordinate that effort. If you are interested in contributing, please
reach out on the project repository or the Sandstorm <a href="https://groups.google.com/g/sandstorm-dev">mailing list</a>.</p>

<h2 id="current-challenges-with-sandstorm">Current Challenges with Sandstorm</h2>

<p>While Tempest has been exciting as a potential leap forward, everyone using Sandstorm
today is still using “Sandstorm classic”. Sandstorm development has moved more slowly,
but it has not stood still. Several security improvements have been added in the past
couple of years, including improved sandboxing both on the server and client side and
a number of small but impactful UI improvements. Last month, Sandstorm’s 308th release
included Ian’s final contribution as well as additional localization work that Troy
contributed.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, as we hope to continue to support Sandstorm long-term, we’ve had an
increasingly challenging problem with the legacy MongoDB database underneath, as Meteor
has dropped support for the version we use. Ensuring a seamless migration on end-user
servers has proven to be a challenging problem. Dependency upgrades are not fun and
this has become a fairly unpleasant project to undertake for unpaid open source
contributors.</p>

<h2 id="moving-forward">Moving Forward</h2>

<p>Over the past few weeks, we have spoken to a number of potential outside parties about
taking on this project and building a migration so that we can update the databases of
existing Sandstorm servers and allow us to continue moving forward. We believe this is
the best way to ensure that Sandstorm servers continue to be the safest way to
self-host. The cost estimates we’ve discussed for the current Sandstorm aren’t
unreasonable, but they are significant.</p>

<p>We are looking to raise the funding for this project through our <a href="https://opencollective.com/sandstormcommunity">OpenCollective</a>.
If you are using Sandstorm, especially at an organization level, and can help ensure
that we are able to provide long-term support, please donate to the project. If you
believe that you or your organization may be willing to fund this effort in large part
or its entirety and would like additional details about the amount we would need to fund
this, please <a href="https://sandstorm.org/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#1d74737f72655d777c7e727f6a78746e67337e7270">contact me directly</a>.</p>

<p>Sandstorm is approaching it’s tenth birthday, and there’s still nothing else like it.
Capability-based security and a tireless focus on abstracting away complexity from the
user continue to make it the only platform which holds hope of letting <em>everyone</em>, not
just developers and IT professionals, self-host. Thank you for your continuing interest
and support.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div dir="auto"><p><span>Aviation is a poster child for economic stagnation. Yes, airline travel has gotten cheaper and safer—great. But every other aspect of aviation has struggled or even regressed. As I’ve </span><a href="https://www.elidourado.com/p/50-years-supersonic-ban" rel="">noted many times</a><span>, we </span><em>had</em><span> supersonic travel across the Atlantic from 1976 to 2003. Today, not even the world’s richest travelers can fly that fast.</span></p><p><span>Another part of aviation that has suffered over the last half-century is general aviation, particularly its low-end segment, personal aviation, in which people fly themselves to their destinations instead of hiring a private pilot to do it. Aviation is simply not practical personal transportation today. Where, one might ask, </span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Where-Flying-Car-Storrs-Hall/dp/1953953182/" rel="">is my flying car</a><span>?</span></p><p><span>Lately I have become obsessed with the Federal Aviation Administration’s new </span><a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2023/07/24/2023-14425/modernization-of-special-airworthiness-certification" rel="">MOSAIC rulemaking</a><span> on light-sport aircraft. The agency’s proposed rule is smart, counterintuitive, and potentially transformative. If not literal flying cars, it could make personal aviation in general much more viable. It’s an action that deserves both applause and careful study.</span></p><p><span>FAA is primarily a safety regulator. In 1996, in order to address perceived conflicts of interest after a handful of airliner crashes, Congress </span><a href="https://www.congress.gov/104/plaws/publ264/PLAW-104publ264.pdf#page=43" rel="">removed</a><span> the agency’s authorization to promote the development of civil aviation, saying that safety was the highest priority. FAA takes its safety mandate very seriously. Importantly, consistent with Congressional direction, it doesn’t apply the same safety standards to all activities, but instead </span><a href="https://downloads.regulations.gov/FAA-2015-1621-0018/attachment_1.pdf" rel="">explicitly adopts</a><span> a “safety continuum,” which is worth reviewing before we get to the content of the MOSAIC rule.</span></p><p>The safest form of aviation is on type-certified Part 25 airliners flying on Part 121 airlines by highly trained, licensed commercial airline pilots. The explicit safety target that FAA and other regulators have settled on is that catastrophic events should be “extremely improbable,” meaning one per billion flight-hours. The regulation of this kind of aviation is nothing short of maniacal. Consequently, it can cost billions of dollars to develop a Part 25 airliner through type certification.</p><p><span>Next along the safety continuum come type-certified Part 23 aircraft. These include most general aviation aircraft, and they can be up to 19,000 pounds of maximum takeoff weight and include seating for up to 19 passengers, although many of them are small four-seaters. To fly a Part 23 aircraft, you must have a private or recreational pilot’s license. In 2017, FAA modernized the Part 23 rules to be less prescriptive, allowing the use of consensus standards (most commonly, </span><a href="https://www.astm.org/" rel="">ASTM</a><span>’s).</span></p><p>The third spot on the continuum are light-sport aircraft (LSAs). This was a category FAA created in 2004 to fill a spot on the safety continuum between Part 23 aircraft and experimental amateur-built aircraft. No type certification is required, but the aircraft must still be built according to consensus standards. Under today’s rules, LSAs are subject to a number of restrictions to limit the size of the category: maximum speed is 120 knots, maximum weight is 1,320 pounds, the aircraft can only have 2 seats, and it can be powered only by one engine, which must be reciprocating. If you only want to fly LSAs, you don’t need a full private pilot’s license. FAA created a sport pilot certificate that can qualify you to fly an LSA with half the flight training.</p><p>Next along the safety continuum come experimental aircraft. This is America. You can build any aircraft you like, and if you can build it, you can fly it, subject to rules designed to limit the risk to the rest of the airspace and people on the ground. You can also buy a kit aircraft from a manufacturer and build it yourself. These aircraft are not only not type certified, they are not necessarily built according to any particular standards. You must be at least a private pilot to fly an experimental aircraft.</p><p>Rounding out the unsafe end of the safety continuum come ultralights. It turns out that FAA is perfectly willing to let you kill yourself in a flying vehicle as long as that vehicle weighs less than 254 pounds and can’t exceed 55 knots, and you do it in the daytime and in an unpopulated area. You need zero pilot training, the aircraft doesn’t have to be registered, and it doesn’t have to be built according to any particular standards.</p><p><span>The safety continuum makes sense. US airlines carry hundreds of millions of paying passengers per year. Those passengers have high safety expectations, particularly because some of them feel out of control on an airliner in a way that they don’t in a car they’re driving or riding in.</span></p><p><span> The airline business doesn’t work without a high safety bar. Furthermore, flying big vehicles poses a bigger risk to people on the ground, who are more likely to be harmed by a crash. It is worth reducing that externality through policy measures to ensure safety.</span></p><p>At the other end of the safety continuum, there are some pretty big benefits to allowing experimentation. The system of permissionless innovation under which the Wright brothers worked is directly responsible for us having aviation at all. We made rapid progress in the early days of aviation by sacrificing a lot of test pilots. Even today, new aviation technology often starts out in the experimental and light-sport world and works its way up to airliners over time as safety regulators figure out how to certify it as safe. Composite materials are one example—they were used in experimental aircraft for decades before the 787 became the first majority-composite airliner.</p><p>Another benefit of the safety continuum is that it provides an onramp for aviation engineering. Let’s say you were starting a company to build airliners. You could have trouble finding engineers with Part 25 experience—you might have to hire them away from Boeing or Airbus. But fortunately, it’s relatively easy to find engineers who have built experimental or Part 23 aircraft before. The Part 25 rules are more strict, but the basic principles of aviation engineering are the same no matter the size of the plane. If the lower end of the continuum were not there, Part 25 development would suffer.</p><p><span>For contrast, consider nuclear regulation. Although NRC is currently </span><a href="https://www.nrc.gov/reactors/new-reactors/advanced/rulemaking-and-guidance/part-53.html" rel="">doing a supposedly risk-informed rulemaking</a><span> for advanced reactors, it doesn’t really operate according to a safety continuum. Texas A&amp;M has an </span><a href="https://engineering.tamu.edu/nuclear/research/facilities/agn-201m-nuclear-reactor-laboratory.html" rel="">on-campus reactor</a><span> that produces </span><em>5 watts</em><span> of thermal energy—similar to a </span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=chemical+hand+warmers" rel="">chemical hand-warmer</a><span>—and that reactor is nevertheless licensed as a utilization facility under the same framework used for all research and energy-producing reactors. This heavy regulation means that few new reactors are being built, which in turn means that if you are starting a new nuclear company, you’re going to have mostly engineers who have never built a nuclear reactor of any kind before. This lack of space for experimentation, as I </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hata-Z6G8lE" rel="">discussed</a><span> with Last Energy CEO Bret Kugelmass recently, is one reason for stagnation in the nuclear industry.</span></p><p>There are two ways—one relatively obvious, one counterintuitive—that less stringent safety rules along the safety continuum can make us more safe over time.</p><p>Let’s start with the obvious one. If the compliance costs of safety regulation get too high, it will shut down iteration and innovation in the industry. These innovations include safety enhancements. After all, pilots and passengers generally want, other things equal, to be safe, so an unfettered free market will deliver cost-effective safety-improving innovations over time. It’s possible by some lights that the market will not produce the optimal amount of safety at all relevant margins, and so regulation persists. Yet everyone should recognize that there is such a thing as overregulation.</p><p><span>FAA </span><em>does</em><span> recognize this. The graphic below comes from a </span><a href="https://downloads.regulations.gov/FAA-2015-1621-0018/attachment_1.pdf" rel="">document</a><span> in which they explain the safety continuum doctrine. “If certifcation [sic] requirements and oversight are overly stringent,” they write, “safety can be jeopardized because the burden of certification will prevent the adoption of safety enhancing technologies.” It’s hard to get more clear than that.</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7ff7cdf8-e8c9-4822-8b1e-aabb0947934a_988x653.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7ff7cdf8-e8c9-4822-8b1e-aabb0947934a_988x653.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7ff7cdf8-e8c9-4822-8b1e-aabb0947934a_988x653.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7ff7cdf8-e8c9-4822-8b1e-aabb0947934a_988x653.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7ff7cdf8-e8c9-4822-8b1e-aabb0947934a_988x653.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7ff7cdf8-e8c9-4822-8b1e-aabb0947934a_988x653.png" width="988" height="653" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/7ff7cdf8-e8c9-4822-8b1e-aabb0947934a_988x653.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:653,&quot;width&quot;:988,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7ff7cdf8-e8c9-4822-8b1e-aabb0947934a_988x653.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7ff7cdf8-e8c9-4822-8b1e-aabb0947934a_988x653.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7ff7cdf8-e8c9-4822-8b1e-aabb0947934a_988x653.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7ff7cdf8-e8c9-4822-8b1e-aabb0947934a_988x653.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>There is second way that less rigorous safety standards can improve safety, one that is more paradoxical or at least counterintuitive. FAA can adjust the boundaries of the different points on the safety continuum. If through deregulation it can increase the attractiveness of being in a safer part of the continuum, it can increase overall system safety while in a static sense only decreasing safety standards.</p><p><span>Amazingly, FAA </span><a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/d/2023-14425/p-83" rel="">explicitly recognizes this</a><span> too, and is now through the MOSAIC rulemaking expanding the light-sport category in a deregulatory manner to induce pilots to upgrade their spot on the safety continuum from experimental to light-sport.</span></p><blockquote><p>Since the 2004 rule, light-sport category aircraft have shown a lower accident rate than experimental amateur-built airplanes. The FAA considers that the successful safety record of light-sport category aircraft validates certification requirements established in the 2004 final rule and provides support for expanding the scope of certification for light-sport category aircraft and operations. As a result, the FAA identified this proposed rule as an opportunity to expand the 2004 final rule to include a wider variety of aircraft, increase performance, and increase operating privileges to extend these safety benefits to more aircraft. The FAA intends for these expansions to increase safety by encouraging aircraft owners, who may be deciding between an experimental aircraft or a light-sport category aircraft, to choose aircraft higher on the safety continuum and, therefore, meet higher aircraft certification requirements.</p></blockquote><p>The data they are referring to are below. The y-axis measures the number of fatal accidents per 100,000 flight-hours. TC/Personal refers to Part 23 (type certified) aircraft used for non-commercial personal purposes. EAB is experimental amateur-built, and SLSA stands for special light-sport aircraft. These kinds of aircraft are all used by similar people and for similar purposes. The SLSA data is more volatile because of a low number of flight-hours compared to the other categories, but in most years, experimental aircraft are about twice as deadly as light-sport aircraft.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc1c5ee86-7852-42f2-82d2-ff580ee34854_789x553.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc1c5ee86-7852-42f2-82d2-ff580ee34854_789x553.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc1c5ee86-7852-42f2-82d2-ff580ee34854_789x553.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc1c5ee86-7852-42f2-82d2-ff580ee34854_789x553.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc1c5ee86-7852-42f2-82d2-ff580ee34854_789x553.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc1c5ee86-7852-42f2-82d2-ff580ee34854_789x553.png" width="789" height="553" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/c1c5ee86-7852-42f2-82d2-ff580ee34854_789x553.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:553,&quot;width&quot;:789,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc1c5ee86-7852-42f2-82d2-ff580ee34854_789x553.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc1c5ee86-7852-42f2-82d2-ff580ee34854_789x553.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc1c5ee86-7852-42f2-82d2-ff580ee34854_789x553.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc1c5ee86-7852-42f2-82d2-ff580ee34854_789x553.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>There are about 6 times as many EAB flight-hours as SLSA flight-hours, so if we move a large chunk of the EAB activity to SLSA, it could result in a net reduction in aviation fatalities, holding total flight-hours constant. To induce people to upgrade their spot on the safety continuum from experimental to light-sport, FAA needs to make the light-sport category more attractive, and boy are they delivering on that.</p><p><span>Modernization of Special Airworthiness Certification (MOSAIC) is the name of the </span><a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2023/07/24/2023-14425/modernization-of-special-airworthiness-certification" rel="">new rulemaking</a><span> initiative from FAA to expand the definition of light-sport aircraft. As discussed above, the explicit goal here is to make the new category so attractive that many recreational pilots switch from more dangerous experimental amateur-built aircraft to light-sport aircraft that are designed according to consensus standards. The changes are sweeping. Let’s walk through the relevant sections of the NPRM to see how FAA is expanding the category.</span></p><p><span>Under current rules, light-sport aircraft explicitly exclude helicopters and powered-lift aircraft (e.g., tilt-rotors and eVTOL aircraft). MOSAIC </span><a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2023/07/24/2023-14425/modernization-of-special-airworthiness-certification#h-41" rel="">proposes</a><span> to allow </span><em>any</em><span> kind of aircraft to be considered a light-sport aircraft if it meets the other criteria. This means we could see helicopters and eVTOLs come to market under light-sport rules—designed under consensus standards and not type certified.</span></p><p>It doesn’t mean that sport pilots would be allowed to fly all of these new light-sport aircraft. MOSAIC is decoupling the definition of light-sport aircraft from sport pilot privileges (that is, sport pilots cannot necessarily fly all light-sport aircraft by default). By doing this decoupling, FAA can be aggressive in deregulating the vehicles (not requiring them to be type certified) while being more cautious about expanding the privileges of pilots. Sport pilots can expand their privileges through additional ratings, although a rating does not necessarily exist for every aircraft considered an LSA.</p><p>To fly light-sport helicopters, sport pilots would have to get a helicopter rating, which they could only get for a helicopter that has simplified flight controls, about which more below. No rating would initially exist for light-sport powered-lift aircraft. FAA says this area is rapidly developing, and it expects that future rulemakings could expand privileges to cover these aircraft. This means that a two-seat eVTOL aircraft could come to market as an LSA, but you’d still need to have a private pilot’s license to fly one initially.</p><p><span>MOSAIC would allow light-sport aircraft to not be so light. Current rules limit LSAs’ maximum takeoff weight to 1,320 pounds, except for seaplanes, which get to be up to 1,430 pounds. Under the new rule, FAA is </span><a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2023/07/24/2023-14425/modernization-of-special-airworthiness-certification#h-42" rel="">scrapping</a><span> the weight requirement entirely. The agency notes that other requirements like maximum stall speed implicitly limit the weight of aircraft, so perhaps LSAs will top out at around 3,000 pounds.</span></p><p>From a safety perspective, they also argue that a weight limit is counterproductive. It discourages a more robust airframe design. It results in more jostling during turbulence, which could increase pilot workload. And it could preclude the installation of additional safety equipment like ballistic recovery systems. Under MOSAIC, then, LSAs will be able to about double in size and be safer as a consequence.</p><p><span>Another </span><a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2023/07/24/2023-14425/modernization-of-special-airworthiness-certification#h-43" rel="">big change</a><span> is to maximum cruise speed. Current light-sport rules limit LSAs to 120 knots. The MOSAIC NPRM notes that even </span><em>student</em><span> pilots, who are less experienced than sport pilots, are allowed to go faster than that. Furthermore, there is no evidence that there is a safety benefit from such a low speed limitation. “FAA has not noted any definitive data that links cruise speed as a contributing factor in accidents involving light-sport category aircraft.” Consequently, FAA is </span><em>more than doubling</em><span> the LSA speed limit to 250 knots.</span></p><p><span>Relatedly, current LSA rules require aircraft to have fixed landing gear. With the speed limit more than doubling, that no longer makes sense as it would wildly increase drag at cruising speeds. Under MOSAIC, FAA </span><a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2023/07/24/2023-14425/modernization-of-special-airworthiness-certification#h-49" rel="">will allow</a><span> LSAs to have retractable landing gear. It doesn’t link that change to higher speeds, but I think it’s only logical that if you are allowing 250 knots you have to allow retractable gear. Sport pilots would require an additional rating to operate retractable landing gear, since it’s important to remember to extend the landing gear before you land.</span></p><p><span>The other speed limit that is relevant is the clean stall speed. Under today’s rules, LSAs must have a stall speed of no more than 45 knots. MOSAIC </span><a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2023/07/24/2023-14425/modernization-of-special-airworthiness-certification#h-44" rel="">proposes to raise</a><span> this limit to 54 knots for airplanes only. Stall speed is relevant because it affects the speed at which an aircraft comes in for a landing. Since kinetic energy increases with velocity squared, this is a parameter that affects the amount of energy involved in a landing accident. FAA says that since the creation of LSAs in 2004, there have been 501 landing accidents involving an LSA, and only 7 of them were fatal. Consequently, there is room to go up from 45 knots.</span></p><p><span>While an increase to 54 knots is welcome, this is one of the few parameters in the MOSAIC rule that could generate some objection from stakeholders, who will want it to be higher still. If it were increased to the low 60s knots, the category could include planes like the forthcoming </span><a href="https://www.pipistrel-aircraft.com/products/panthera/" rel="">Pipistrel Panthera</a><span>.</span></p><p><span>Another instance of decoupling of sport pilot privileges and aircraft specifications is passenger capacity. Today’s light-sport rules limit everything to two seats (the pilot plus one passenger). MOSAIC </span><a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2023/07/24/2023-14425/modernization-of-special-airworthiness-certification#h-45" rel="">would allow</a><span> airplanes (but not other kinds of LSAs) to be manufactured with up to four seats. Sport pilots would still be limited to transporting one passenger. This is consistent with FAA taking aim at four-seat experimental airplanes flown by non-sport private pilots, trying to make it attractive for private pilots to “upgrade” their spot on the safety continuum to a standards-based aircraft. Undoubtedly, a lot of sport pilots will comment on this change, asking to be allowed to also carry additional passengers rather than flying with empty seats.</span></p><p><span>Under today’s light-sport rules, LSAs are limited to a single reciprocating (piston) engine. What this has meant in practice is that turboprops are not allowed. MOSAIC </span><a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2023/07/24/2023-14425/modernization-of-special-airworthiness-certification#h-46" rel="">eliminates this limitation</a><span>, prescribing no limit on the number or type of powerplant on the aircraft. FAA justifies this elimination by noting that modern turbines are simpler to operate than piston engines because of fancier firmware on the turbines.</span></p><p><span>While a turboprop LSA sounds awesome (a mini </span><a href="https://www.pilatus-aircraft.com/en/fly/pc-12" rel="">PC-12</a><span>, anyone?), this change allows far more than turboprops. A big movement in the eVTOL space is distributed electric propulsion. While batteries aren’t good enough to yield good range yet, there are a lot of advantages to electric motors—simplicity, fast spin-up, reliability. Distributed propulsion also yields redundancy and noise reduction.</span></p><p>Without a limitation on propulsion technology, there is no rule stopping a manufacturer from using a turbogenerator and using it to power a slew of electric motors. It’s up to the market to figure out whether something like this would be practical, but FAA rules won’t stand in the way.</p><p><span>This is the part where my jaw hit the floor. MOSAIC </span><a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2023/07/24/2023-14425/modernization-of-special-airworthiness-certification#h-70" rel="">makes specific provision</a><span> for “simplified flight controls.” In today’s airplanes, pilots have direct control of flight surfaces and available power. Imagine if instead of moving flaps and rudders you could just tell the airplane to turn left. You could fly it like in an arcade game. The aircraft would be responsible for keeping itself in a safe flight envelope, and it would take suggestions from the pilot as to what to do.</span></p><p>FAA is non-prescriptive about what simplified flight controls could look like. The requirements if manufacturers want to opt into simplified flight controls are that:</p><ol><li><p>The pilot cannot directly control flight surfaces or engine power.</p></li><li><p>The aircraft is designed to prevent loss of control regardless of pilot input.</p></li><li><p>The pilot has a means to discontinue the flight safely and quickly (triggering an emergency landing, return to starting point, course change, or a holding pattern).</p></li></ol><p>These flight controls could range from arcade-style controls to full self-piloting. Because these simplified controls would vary from model to model, FAA is proposing a model-specific endorsement for pilots who wish to fly any aircraft with simplified flight controls.</p><p>After World War II, expectations for general aviation were sky high. The war had driven significant advancements in aeronautics, navigation, and communication technologies. There were a large number of military surplus planes and a lot of trained pilots returning from the war. For someone alive in 1945, who had perhaps witnessed the social transformation wrought by the automobile, it would seem only natural that general aviation would be the next step in personal transportation.</p><p>Of course, it didn’t play out that way. The government significantly tightened certification requirements for general aviation in 1945 and 1965. With the market flooded with cheap, surplus military aircraft, it was hard for manufacturers to make money investing in new, more advanced models. And, of course, piloting an airplane using conventional flight controls is not as simple as driving a car, requiring significantly more skill, with lapses in attention more catastrophic.</p><p>If general aviation is to make a comeback, something like the MOSAIC rule is a prerequisite. By making a category of aircraft that doesn’t require type certification, is actually useful for transportation (250 knots and 4 seats), and can be flown with less skill via simplified flight controls, FAA is opening the door to a bigger market and vastly more innovation.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0fc98480-3455-4e26-a688-215c846df9a5_889x500.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0fc98480-3455-4e26-a688-215c846df9a5_889x500.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0fc98480-3455-4e26-a688-215c846df9a5_889x500.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0fc98480-3455-4e26-a688-215c846df9a5_889x500.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0fc98480-3455-4e26-a688-215c846df9a5_889x500.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0fc98480-3455-4e26-a688-215c846df9a5_889x500.png" width="889" height="500" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/0fc98480-3455-4e26-a688-215c846df9a5_889x500.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:500,&quot;width&quot;:889,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0fc98480-3455-4e26-a688-215c846df9a5_889x500.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0fc98480-3455-4e26-a688-215c846df9a5_889x500.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0fc98480-3455-4e26-a688-215c846df9a5_889x500.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0fc98480-3455-4e26-a688-215c846df9a5_889x500.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>Without the need for type certification, manufacturers can iterate on their designs more rapidly without going through the costly supplemental type certification process. They can include cheaper uncertified avionics. They can do over-the-air software updates.</p><p>Meanwhile, simplified flight controls and making LSAs actually useful could greatly increase demand for these aircraft as transportation. That increased demand feeds directly into manufacturing investment and the pace of iteration. The more progress there is in making these small planes really great, the more the demand for them will increase, creating a flywheel effect.</p><p>If we can get LSAs into mass manufacturing, production costs of the airframe could go down further. Mass manufactured items tend toward the cost of inputs. Aviation manufacturing entails more burdensome supply chain integrity requirements than other industries, so LSAs will likely never get as cheap as a Toyota Camry despite having similar mass, but it could be a smaller multiple of the cost.</p><p>In the near term, I’d love to see a MOSAIC aircraft that had the following:</p><ul><li><p>4 seats</p></li><li><p>200+ knot cruise speed</p></li><li><p>Distributed electric propulsion (maybe vectorable) powered by a turbogenerator and small battery for buffer and reserves</p></li><li><p>1000 nmi range</p></li><li><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STOL" rel="">STOL</a><span> capability to maximize versatility. DEP helps with this, and you have to have low stall speed anyway</span></p></li><li><p>Ultra-simplified controls including autopilot and autoland</p></li><li><p>Starlink on board for passenger connectivity, over-the-air avionics updates, and maintenance monitoring</p></li><li><p><span>Weight-saving and performance-improving technologies like </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avionics_Full-Duplex_Switched_Ethernet" rel="">ethernet-based addressing of actuators</a><span> instead of more traditional fly-by-wire</span></p></li><li><p>Active turbulence reduction</p></li><li><p>A ballistic recovery system</p></li></ul><p>This is the kind of aircraft that could draw people into flying, kicking off the flywheel of innovation and making personal aviation relevant again.</p><p>One reason I wrote this post is because I wanted to publicly praise FAA for such an innovative and thoughtful action. FAA’s longstanding safety continuum philosophy makes eminent sense, and with MOSAIC they are applying it with rigor and insight. This rulemaking will indeed, over time, make general aviation safer, both by increasing safety innovation and by inducing experimental pilots to upgrade their spot on the safety continuum. This is the public sector operating at its finest.</p><p>Although I have nothing but applause for the civil servants behind the MOSAIC rule, the policy change also makes a darker point about the history of general aviation in the United States. There’s nothing magical about the current moment that makes it the right time to expand the class of aircraft that don’t need to be certified. If it is the right policy now, and it is, then it was likely the right policy decades ago. If we had never introduced type certification into four-seat aircraft, we could be in much better shape today. Our present stagnation in general aviation is a direct result of 70 years of the wrong policy choices being made by FAA and its predecessors. There are many other areas, both within aviation and in the economy overall, where we are similarly making the wrong policy choices. If we want both safety and prosperity, we need to root them out.</p><p>The comment period for the MOSAIC rulemaking closes on January 22, 2024. It will take several months after comments close for the rule to be finalized and take effect. When it does, we’re going to have to throw a big party.</p></div></article></div></div>]]></description>

				<p>Helllloooo so it’s been a minute! And… for good reason.</p>
<p>I have a workflow that somewhat works well for me in which I write my blog posts in <a href="https://obsidian.md/">Obsidian</a> (with a template that helps me add tags and a description and stuff), and then when I want to post them, I copy and paste the post into the repository here, and then if I have images, I add the images to the repo, and then check all of the paths for it, and then ship it.</p>
<p>It works well, BUT there’s just enough overhead that sometimes I don’t write a post because there’s a few too many steps. I have a few partially-written posts that I haven’t published yet, because I keep thinking about the things getting in my way post-writing. I thought it would be nice to have a web interface for easily publishing blog posts here!</p>
<p>I wasn’t sure what CMS I’d use, because so many of them require quite a bit of setup, or they have more of a GUI interface rather than a markdown-oriented one. But, then I saw <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2023/09/smashing-magazine-tinacms-manage-editorial-workflow/">this blog post about how Smashing Magazine uses TinaCMS</a> and it looked like the perfect solution for me! I love the idea of being able to have everything be Git-based, markdown-based, and very lightweight. I was able to configure <a href="https://tina.io/">Tina</a> pretty quickly (I <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/cassidoo">streamed</a> it and luckily a core team member was in the chat and able to help me a bit when I was misunderstanding things) and it didn’t mess up my existing codebase in any way!</p>
<p>A few weeks ago I spoke at <a href="https://cfe.dev/events/codeword-conf-2023/">CodeWord Conf</a>, and something that Chris Coyier said in his segment stuck with me when he talked about his consistency: the fact that he can just type into a CMS and hit send, with minimal things getting in his way, has kept him more consistent in his writing. I do prefer Markdown and my usual local-first workflow, but the fact that I could spit out a blog quickly without any sort of copying and pasting or editing is something I’m excited to try.</p>
<p>This is the first post I’ve written and published with TinaCMS, and we’ll see how I like it over time!</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="storywrap-423274">


<h3>from the <i>do-not-pass-go,-do-not-collect-$200</i> dept</h3>

<p>Cleveland has spent years being dubbed the “<a href="https://www.cleveland.com/news/2020/09/cleveland-ranks-as-worst-connected-large-city-for-internet-in-2019.html" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.cleveland.com/news/2020/09/cleveland-ranks-as-worst-connected-large-city-for-internet-in-2019.html">worst connected city in the U.S.</a>” thanks to expensive, patchy, and slow broadband. Why Cleveland broadband sucks so badly isn’t really a mystery: consolidated monopoly/duopoly power has resulted in a broken market where local giants like AT&amp;T and Charter don’t have to compete on price, speeds, availability, customer service, or much of anything else. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2017/05/05/att-takes-heat-avoiding-broadband-upgrades-poor-areas/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.techdirt.com/2017/05/05/att-takes-heat-avoiding-broadband-upgrades-poor-areas/">Data also shows</a> that despite billions in tax breaks, regulatory favors, and subsidies, companies like AT&amp;T have long refused to upgrade low-income and minority Cleveland neighborhoods to fiber. These companies not only engage in this deployment “redlining,” but data also makes it clear they often charge these low income and minority neighborhoods <a href="https://www.cnet.com/home/internet/features/the-broadband-gaps-dirty-secret-redlining-still-exists-in-digital-form/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.cnet.com/home/internet/features/the-broadband-gaps-dirty-secret-redlining-still-exists-in-digital-form/">more money for the same or slower broadband</a>. </p>
<p>Last week I spent some time <a href="https://communitynets.org/content/clevelands-two-pronged-attack-make-worse-connected-city-label-relic-past" data-type="link" data-id="https://communitynets.org/content/clevelands-two-pronged-attack-make-worse-connected-city-label-relic-past">talking to Cleveland city leaders and local activists</a> about their plan to do something about it. On one hand, they’ve doled out $20 million in COVID relief broadband funding to local non-profit DigitalC to deliver fixed wireless broadband at speeds of 100 Mbps for as little as $18. </p>
<p>On the other hand, they’ve convinced a company named SiFi Networks to build a $500 million open access fiber network at no cost to taxpayers. SiFi Networks will benefit from a tight relationship with the city, while making its money from leasing access to the network to ISPs. </p>
<p>We’ve noted (see our <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2022/07/18/just-a-click-away-how-to-improve-broadband-competition/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.techdirt.com/2022/07/18/just-a-click-away-how-to-improve-broadband-competition/">Copia report on broadband competition</a>) that such open access networks routinely lower the cost for ISP market entry, boost competition, and generally result in lower prices. Monopolies like AT&amp;T, of course, have long opposed the idea, even if they would technically benefit from lower access costs, because it chips away at their consolidated monopoly power. </p>
<p>Local activists like DigitalC CEO Joshua Edmonds tell me they hope the project teaches U.S. towns and cities that there are alternatives to being feckless supplicants to regional telecom mono/duopolies:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“This is a major victory, and I hope that people don’t look at it as just a major victory for Cleveland. Every city where there’s a prevalent digital divide, where there’s political will and ability to execute, people should be paying close attention to what happens in Cleveland, paying close attention to how DigitalC was able to fight and navigate with our coalition of stakeholders.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>We’ll see what the finished network looks like. And now that Cleveland is challenging monopoly power, it will be interesting to see if local monopolies focus on challenging Cleveland. Big ISPs like AT&amp;T and Charter want to have their cake and eat it too; they don’t want to uniformly upgrade their broadband networks to next-gen speeds, but they genuinely don’t want others to do so either. </p>
<p>It’s a lot easier and cheaper to throw a bunch of campaign contributions at corrupt policymakers (<a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2021/02/19/new-bill-tries-to-ban-community-broadband-during-pandemic/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.techdirt.com/2021/02/19/new-bill-tries-to-ban-community-broadband-during-pandemic/">remember with the GOP wanted to ban all community broadband networks country-wide during the peak of the pandemic?</a> or how the telecom and GOP worked in concert to pass laws in 20 states effectively <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2021/04/15/washington-state-votes-to-kill-law-that-restricted-community-broadband/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.techdirt.com/2021/04/15/washington-state-votes-to-kill-law-that-restricted-community-broadband/">banning towns and cities from making these choices for themselves</a>?).</p>
<p>Community-owned broadband networks aren’t a magical panacea. Such efforts are like any other business plan, and require competency in design and implementation. But the community-owned and operated networks in more than 1,000 U.S. cities can (and routinely do) prompt a very broken and federal government-coddled status quo to actually try for once, much to its chagrin. </p>

<p>A startling revelation indicates that the UK government has substantially amplified its surveillance of the online activity of educators. Ranging from leading education experts to teaching assistants and librarians earning modest salaries, the magnifying glass of surveillance closely monitors posts critiquing education policies. The discovery was made by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/oct/21/uk-government-keeping-files-on-teaching-assistants-and-librarians-internet-activity">The Observer</a>, revealing that the Department for Education is keeping extensive records of such posts, something that we’ve <a href="https://reclaimthenet.org/uk-government-monitored-the-social-media-activity-of-education-critics">previously covered.</a></p>
<p>This revelation highlights the burning issues of free speech and censorship, causing widespread disquiet among the educational community. The surveillance of educators’ online activity portrays a scenario where dissent or criticism of government policy is not only surveilled but also cataloged, potentially affecting the educators’ professional careers.</p>
<p>Educators across the UK have demonstrated a wave of shock and anger in response to the discovery. Many have submitted Subject Access Requests [SARs], a Right to Access provision within the General Data Protection Regulation, requiring the Department of Education to disclose the information it holds under their names. These educators found file lengths spanning up to 60 pages, documenting their tweets and comments opposing the government’s policies and criticizing the schools inspectorate, Ofsted.</p>
<p>Nikki Cleveland, a higher-level teaching assistant and primary school librarian, was astounded to find that even her tweets concerning issues such as inadequate funding for school libraries and criticisms of Ofsted had been flagged and stored by the Department. Her discovery has only raised her cynicism towards the government and the Department of Education, questioning their apathy towards the challenges schools face daily.</p>
<p>This disturbing surveillance operation extends to more than just educators. Jon Biddle, a primary school teacher and English lead, reported that “dozens of other teachers” he knew had also discovered their accounts were under scrutiny. The scope and depth of this surveillance has led to growing skepticism about the Department’s priorities and resource allocation.</p>
<p>Cases have also surfaced of the Department attempting to silence voices critical of government policy. Early years specialists Ruth Swailes and Aaron Bradbury have previously faced attempts from the Department to cancel their conference due to their earlier critiques. Similarly, Dr. Mine Conkbayir, a renowned early childhood author, was allegedly threatened with funding withdrawal for a conference she was scheduled to keynote, due to her criticisms. As she recounts, the Department also attempted to curtail her talk duration and verify her speech contents, pulling the strings of academic dialogue.</p>
<p>In response to these revelations, the Department has chosen to remain largely opaque, stating that it would not be appropriate to comment on individual cases.</p>

Credit: Neuroscience News</figcaption></figure><p>“Our lab has years of experience studying fungi, so we embarked on the study of the connection between&nbsp;<em>C. albicans</em>&nbsp;and Alzheimer’s disease in animal models,” said corresponding author&nbsp;Dr. David Corry, Fulbright Endowed Chair in Pathology and professor of pathology and immunology and medicine at Baylor. He also is a member of Baylor’s Dan L Duncan Comprehensive Cancer Center.</p><p>“In 2019, we&nbsp;reported&nbsp;that&nbsp;<em>C. albicans</em>&nbsp;does get into the brain where it produces changes that are very similar to what is seen in Alzheimer’s disease. The current study extends that work to understand the molecular mechanisms.”</p><p>“Our first question was, how does&nbsp;<em>C. albicans</em>&nbsp;enter the brain? We found that&nbsp;<em>C. albicans</em>&nbsp;produces enzymes called secreted aspartic proteases (Saps) that breakdown the blood-brain barrier, giving the fungus access to the brain where it causes damage,” said first author&nbsp;Dr. Yifan Wu, postdoctoral scientist in pediatrics working in the Corry lab.</p><p>Next, the researchers asked, how is the fungus effectively cleared from the brain? Corry and his colleagues had&nbsp;previously shown&nbsp;that a&nbsp;<em>C. albicans</em>&nbsp;brain infection is fully resolved in otherwise healthy mice after 10 days. In this study, they reported that this occurred thanks to two mechanisms triggered by the fungus in brain cells called microglia.</p><p>“The same Saps that the fungus uses to break the blood-brain barrier also break down the amyloid precursor protein into AB-like peptides,” Wu said. “These peptides activate microglial brain cells via a cell surface receptor called Toll-like receptor 4, which keeps the fungi load low in the brain, but does not clear the infection.”</p><p><em>C. albicans</em>&nbsp;also produces a protein called candidalysin that also binds to microglia via a different receptor, CD11b. “Candidalysin-mediated activation of microglia is essential for clearance of&nbsp;<em>Candida</em>&nbsp;in the brain,” Wu said. “If we take away this pathway, fungi are no longer effectively cleared in the brain.”</p><p>“This work potentially contributes an important new piece of the puzzle regarding the development of Alzheimer’s disease,” Corry said.</p><p>“The current explanation for this condition is that it is mostly the result of the accumulation of toxic Ab-like peptides in the brain that leads to neurodegeneration. The dominant thinking is that these peptides are produced endogenously, our own brain proteases break down the amyloid precursor proteins generating the toxic Ab peptides.”</p><p>Here, the researchers show that the Ab-like peptides also can be generated from a different source –&nbsp;<em>C. albicans</em>. This common fungus, which has been detected in the brains of people with Alzheimer’s disease and other chronic neurodegenerative disorders, has its own set of proteases that can generate the same Ab-like peptides the brain can generate endogenously.</p><p>“We propose that the brain Ab-peptide aggregates that characterize multiple&nbsp;<em>Candida</em>-associated neurodegenerative conditions including Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease and others, may be generated both intrinsically by the brain and by&nbsp;<em>C. albicans</em>,” Corry said.</p><p>“These findings in animal models support conducting further studies to evaluate the role of&nbsp;<em>C. albicans</em>&nbsp;in the development of Alzheimer’s disease in people, which can potentially lead to innovative therapeutic strategies.”</p><h2>About this Alzheimer’s disease research news</h2><p><strong>Author: </strong><a href="https://neurosciencenews.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#c189aeaca0ef96a0b3b3a4af81a3a2acefa4a5b4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Homa Warren</a><br><strong>Source: </strong><a href="https://bcm.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Baylor College of Medicine</a><br><strong>Contact: </strong>Homa Warren – Baylor College of Medicine<br><strong>Image: </strong>The image is credited to Neuroscience News</p><p><strong>Original Research: </strong>Open access.<br>“<a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/pdf/S2211-1247(23)01252-4.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Toll-like receptor 4 and CD11b expressed on microglia coordinate eradication of Candida albicans cerebral mycosis</a>” by David Corry et al. <em>Cell Reports</em></p><hr> <!-- Form created by Optin Forms plugin by WPKube: create beautiful optin forms with ease! --> <!-- https://wpkube.com/ --><!--optinforms-form5-container--> <!-- / Optin Forms --> </div><!-- .entry-content --><!-- .entry-footer --></article><!-- #post-x --></main><!-- .site-main --></div></div>]]></description>

<p>Defendant’s failure to laugh at the question of whether he had “firearms, drugs, cats, dogs, alligators, and weapons” in his vehicle stop was not reasonable suspicion. United States v. Holloway, 2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 187752 (E.D. Pa. Oct. 18, 2023):</p>



<blockquote><p>Officer Smart testified that he regularly asks individuals a question concerning possession of “firearms, drugs, cats, dogs, alligators, and weapons” at vehicle stops because it “helps [him] read people’s body language and their demeanor.” … He further testified that he was trained by other officers to infer that an individual who does not laugh at such a question is nervous about either firearms or narcotics … and that he typically receives a “laughing response” to that question …. While courts “do give considerable deference to police officers’ determinations of reasonable suspicion, … courts do not owe them blind deference.” United States v. Alvin, 701 F. App’x 151, 156 (3d Cir. 2017) (internal quotations omitted). The Court does not find that laughing at a law enforcement officer while being questioned about drugs and weapons would be an appropriate response. Moreover, failing to laugh at a bizarre question while being questioned about drugs and weapons does not create reasonable suspicion to remove an individual from a car after a traffic violation.</p></blockquote>



<p>Note that the officer said he got that from other officers, not from official training.</p>

<p>As its name implies, the jet stream is essentially a river of fast-moving air in the atmosphere at about the altitude where airplanes fly. It is typically a few hundred miles across, and jets can indeed save a lot of fuel if they can fly within this air current, generally from west to east.</p>
<p>Jet streams also have significant implications for our weather on the ground, as they more or less steer storm systems that affect the mid-latitudes. That is, they in large part determine whether parts of the United States—which lies almost entirely in the mid-latitudes between the tropics and poles in the Northern Hemisphere—will see stormy or serene weather.</p>
<p>As always with weather, the situation is complex. But one of the more useful signals in a forecaster's arsenal is the El Niño–Southern Oscillation in the tropical Pacific Ocean, which vacillates between warmer sea surface temperatures (El Niño), cooler ones (La Niña), and neutral conditions. This broad pattern has widespread weather implications, including the location of the jet stream.</p>

<p>You probably know that we've been in an El Niño pattern since late spring. This is one reason why the summer of 2023 was so incredibly hot, as the addition of El Niño goosed the background warming of climate change after several La Niña years. Forecasters at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and Columbia University, who specialize in the Southern Oscillation, now predict that El Niño will peak late this fall into the winter months. It will be a fairly strong El Niño, with implications for this winter and—more speculatively—for next summer, which should be hot again.</p>
<h2>Winter outlook</h2>
<p>When El Niño is present during the winter months, it generally has a pronounced effect on the Pacific jet stream. Instead of being variable in its track, often entering North America near the state of Washington and southern British Columbia, it more consistently tracks into California and Mexico's Baja peninsula. This brings a more southerly storm track.</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>Since this pattern is what we'll see this winter, we can have a reasonably high confidence in a seasonal forecast for the United States. So when NOAA released its official outlook for the coming winter last week, it's no surprise that they're predicting a warmer and mild winter for the northern United States (and southern Canada, although it is not explicitly included in the US government agency's forecast). The southern half of the country should see near-normal conditions.</p><figure><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/IMAGE-winteroutlook_seasonal_temperature_2023-101923-scaled.gif" data-height="1978" data-width="2560" alt="The 2023–2024 US Winter Outlook map for temperature."><img alt="The 2023–2024 US Winter Outlook map for temperature." src="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/IMAGE-winteroutlook_seasonal_temperature_2023-101923-980x757.gif" width="980" height="757"></a><figcaption><p><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/IMAGE-winteroutlook_seasonal_temperature_2023-101923-scaled.gif" data-height="1978" data-width="2560">Enlarge</a> <span>/</span> The 2023–2024 US Winter Outlook map for temperature.</p><p>NOAA</p></figcaption></figure>
<p>The more interesting change comes in precipitation. Consistent with a more southerly jet stream, the northern tier of the United States should see a fairly dry winter. This may well mean less snow in the Great Lakes region of the country. However, the more southerly part of the country is likely to see an enhanced storm pattern, which generally means more rainfall.</p>
<p>This should be beneficial to parts of New Mexico, Texas, Louisiana, and Mississippi, which are in the throes of an "<a href="https://droughtmonitor.unl.edu/currentmap/statedroughtmonitor.aspx?conus">exceptional drought</a>" after an extremely hot summer in which high pressure dominated and there was relatively little precipitation.</p>
<p>“During late October, heavy precipitation is likely to result in drought improvement for the central US,"&nbsp;<a href="https://www.noaa.gov/news-release/us-winter-outlook-wetter-south-warmer-north">said</a> Brad Pugh, operational drought lead with NOAA’s Climate Prediction Center. "El Niño with its enhanced precipitation is expected to provide drought relief to the southern US during the next few months."</p>
<h2>The bigger picture</h2>
<p>These are only broad, background patterns, of course. This does not mean the upper Midwest won't see some snowstorms or seriously cold weather this winter. Texas, you may recall, saw one of its coldest winter storms in the last half century in early 2021, which <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2021/05/texas-power-outage-almost-became-weeks-long-catastrophe/">knocked out power to millions in the state</a>. This very cold weather came amid a La Niña winter, which is supposed to bring milder conditions to the southern United States. So, as always, the utility of seasonal forecasts is relatively low.</p>
<p>The other wild card, of course, is climate change. We saw unprecedentedly hot conditions this summer for much of the world, including the hottest temperatures ever recorded in parts of the Gulf of Mexico and Atlantic Ocean. What this all means for older, established weather patterns, we can't really say. All we can really know is what George R.R. Martin told us decades ago: "Winter is coming."</p>

If you don't know it, this feature lets you define a set of rules that your project must satisfy. For instance, the Yarn repository enforces that no two workspaces depend on different versions of any given dependencies, unless explicitly allowed.</p><p>Our constraints engine used to be powered by Tau-Prolog, a JavaScript <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prolog#Rules_and_facts" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Prolog</a> implementation. Unlike imperative languages like JavaScript, Prolog uses a different model called logic programming - you define that something exists if a rule is true. It's a very interesting pattern that integrates well with the concept of rule-based linting. Unfortunately, Prolog proved very complex to use, increasing the learning curve of constraints past the threshold we were comfortable with.</p><p>As a result, Prolog constraints are deprecated starting from Yarn 4, and <strong>they have been superseded by a shiny new JavaScript-based engine, with optional TypeScript support!</strong> We have been writing our own rules at <a href="https://www.datadoghq.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Datadog</a> with this framework for a couple of months now, with great success.

It's a handy way to surface errors before having to wait for the remote CI to raise them, and since the new engine is so fast, it has almost no impact on your install time 🚀</p></div><p>Various features in Yarn used to be shipped as sideloaded plugins that needed to be managed separately from the main bundle. While this helped us build a plugin ecosystem, it also proved challenging to manage for our users. We implemented some features to make that easier (auto-upgrade plugins when you auto-update Yarn), but in the end the few KiBs we gained by not shipping all the features by default weren't worth the confusion and friction they caused.</p><p>As a result, while Yarn still supports third-party plugins (and will continue to in the future), <strong>all the features and commands we build are now available as part of the main distribution</strong>. You can now use <span><code><span data-type="binary">yarn</span> <a data-tooltip-id="tooltip" data-tooltip-content="Open the upgrade interface

            <pubDate>Mon, 23 Oct 2023 14:01:47 GMT</pubDate>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://mswjs.io/blog/introducing-msw-2.0/">https://mswjs.io/blog/introducing-msw-2.0/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37985777">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>This November marks five years since Mock Service Worker has been first added to a <code>package.json</code>. Over that time, I have learned a lot about building libraries, designing APIs, and cultivating communities, which makes today’s announcement all the more special.</p>
<p>Version 2.0 marks a monumental chapter for MSW. A year in development, dozens of contributors, and thousands of lines changed, this update brings a refined public API with the first-class support for Fetch API primitives and all the features and bug fixes that it unlocks as a side effect. Let’s have a quick look at what changed and why.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you prefer consuming changes hands-on, feel free to dive into the <a href="https://mswjs.io/docs/migrations/1.x-to-2.x">Migration guide</a> for version 2.0. But if you’d like to learn more about the motivation, the challenges, behind-the-scenes, sweat and tears, and all that, then keep on reading.</p>
</blockquote>


<h2 id="the-beginnings"><a href="#the-beginnings">The beginnings</a></h2>
<p>If you’ve been using MSW, you are well familiar with this call signature:</p>
<div data-rehype-pretty-code-fragment=""><pre tabindex="0" data-language="js" data-theme="default"><code data-language="js" data-theme="default"><span data-line=""><span>(</span><span>req</span><span>, </span><span>res</span><span>, </span><span>ctx</span><span>) </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>res</span><span>(</span><span>...</span><span>)</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>This is a function called <em>response resolver</em>, and it acts as a callback that receives the intercepted request and decides how to handle it. The shape of the response resolver hasn’t changed a bit since I first wrote it in 2018. Back in the day, I was rather inspired by functional programming paradigms and function composition in particular, which you can clearly see in the way you declare mocked responses using the <code>res</code> function:</p>
<div data-rehype-pretty-code-fragment=""><pre tabindex="0" data-language="js" data-theme="default"><code data-language="js" data-theme="default"><span data-line=""><span>// Constructing a response is a matter of</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>// composing various response utilities,</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>// like "ctx.status" and "ctx.json".</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>res</span><span>(</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>  ctx.</span><span>status</span><span>(</span><span>201</span><span>),</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>  ctx.</span><span>json</span><span>({</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>    id: </span><span>'abc-123'</span><span>,</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>    title: </span><span>'Introducing MSW 2.0'</span><span>,</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>  })</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>)</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>From the practical standpoint, the <code>res()</code> composition API achieves its goals: it allows for response declaration, it’s readable, it scales and abstracts well. But years of shipping open-source software have taught me there are more aspects to your code than practicality. Despite its apparent benefits, this composition API failed to achieve a rather important characteristic.</p>
<p><strong>It failed to educate</strong>.</p>
<p>The degree of abstraction in the <code>res()</code> function is far too high to teach you, the developer, anything about actual responses on the web. As a maintainer with thousands of projects depending on the software I build, I feel it’s my responsibility to care about what developers learn from that software. I want them to achieve their goals but I also want them to learn concepts and APIs they can apply even outside of MSW because I firmly believe that’s what a good software does.</p>
<h2 id="the-essence"><a href="#the-essence">The essence</a></h2>
<p>MSW allows you to treat each response as a function of request, and that has been precisely what was going on under the hood.</p>
<div data-rehype-pretty-code-fragment=""><pre tabindex="0" data-language="js" data-theme="default"><code data-language="js" data-theme="default"><span data-line=""><span>// An abstract representation of the request -&gt; response flow.</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>responseSource.</span><span>on</span><span>(</span><span>'request'</span><span>, (</span><span>request</span><span>) </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> {</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>  </span><span>const</span><span> </span><span>isomorphicRequest</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>toIsomorphicRequest</span><span>(request)</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>  </span><span>const</span><span> </span><span>response</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>resolver</span><span>(isomorphicRequest, responseComposition, context)</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>  </span><span>return</span><span> </span><span>respondWith</span><span>(response)</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>})</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>While in the browser we receive the Fetch API <code>Request</code> instance to represent a request, things become more tangled once we step into Node.js.</p>
<p>Before version 2.0, MSW supported Node.js v14 - v16, which is a huge spectre of versions. There is no <code>fetch</code> present in those versions, which means we couldn’t rely on the Fetch API to represent outgoing requests. To account for that request class difference, the library coerced all requests to a single isomoprhic request instance, and that is precisely what you got as the <code>req</code> argument in the response resolver.</p>
<p>But that isomorphic request is entirely contrived. Worse still, extending it or adding new features required to manually implement them for every request module the developer could have used in Node.js. That was extremely tedious and lead to all sorts of bugs.</p>
<p>The effort behind v2.0 is precisely to eradicate those contrived APIs and fully embrace JavaScript standards.</p>
<h3 id="polyfills"><a href="#polyfills">Polyfills</a></h3>
<p><em>Why won’t you just use a <code>fetch</code> polyfill?</em> That’s precisely what I tried at first. It wasn’t long until I realized relying on polyfills won’t work at all.</p>
<p>See, as a developer, you can polyfill <code>fetch</code> in your project in many ways, most likely relying on third-party packages. You may be using <code>whatwg-fetch</code>, or <code>node-fetch</code>, or <code>isomorphic-fetch</code>, or <code>undici</code>. But MSW <strong>had to use just one package</strong>. And it’s not a problem of choice but a problem of interoperability.</p>
<p>Every <code>fetch</code> polyfill locks the identity of its internal classes like <code>Request</code>, <code>Response</code> and <code>Headers</code>. This means that none of those classes would pass the <code>instanceof</code> check, as one example, unless both you and MSW use the same polyfill, which is virtually impossible to predict.</p>
<div data-rehype-pretty-code-fragment=""><pre tabindex="0" data-language="js" data-theme="default"><code data-language="js" data-theme="default"><span data-line=""><span>// somewhere/in/msw.js</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>import</span><span> { Request } </span><span>from</span><span> </span><span>'polyfill-that-msw-uses'</span></span>
<span data-line=""> </span>
<span data-line=""><span>function</span><span> </span><span>isRequest</span><span>(</span><span>request</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>Request</span><span>) {</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>  </span><span>// This will produce a lot of false negatives</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>  </span><span>// if you provide a `request` constructed by</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>  </span><span>// a different polyfill than "polyfill-that-msw-uses".</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>  </span><span>return</span><span> request </span><span>instanceof</span><span> </span><span>Request</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>}</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Inferring the polyfilled classes isn’t a reliable route either. It implies that the polyfill is set globally but it may not be the case. It also makes TypeScript definitions insanely difficult to get right as some polyfills deviate from the specification.</p>
<p>I’ve spent almost a month fighting this to arrive at the simple conclusion: this was clearly not the way forward.</p>
<h2 id="the-way-forward"><a href="#the-way-forward">The way forward</a></h2>
<p>I took a call to deprecate support for Node.js ≤ v16 with the new version of MSW and I am glad I did that. By the time I was finished with the rewrite, Node.js v14 has already reached the end-of-life, Node.js v16 reaches the end of life this fall, and Node.js v18 itself goes into maintenance.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The day I removed Node.js v14 support from MSW will go in history as one of my happiest days as an engineer.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Node.js evolves fast, and it is thanks fo that evolution that MSW can rely on the standard Fetch API both in the browser and Node.js to represent requests and responses from version 2.0!</p>
<h2 id="the-new-api"><a href="#the-new-api">The new API</a></h2>
<p>Starting from 2.0, the way you declare request handlers (and response resolvers) will change. Here’s how the new API looks like:</p>
<div data-rehype-pretty-code-fragment=""><pre tabindex="0" data-language="js" data-theme="default"><code data-language="js" data-theme="default"><span data-line=""><span>import</span><span> { http } </span><span>from</span><span> </span><span>'msw'</span></span>
<span data-line=""> </span>
<span data-line=""><span>http.</span><span>get</span><span>(</span><span>'/resource'</span><span>, </span><span>async</span><span> ({ </span><span>request</span><span> }) </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> {</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>  </span><span>const</span><span> </span><span>user</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>await</span><span> request.</span><span>json</span><span>()</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>  </span><span>return</span><span> </span><span>new</span><span> </span><span>Response</span><span>(</span><span>`Hello, ${</span><span>user</span><span>.</span><span>name</span><span>}`</span><span>)</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>})</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>And you’ve guessed it, both <code>request</code> and <code>Response</code> are the standard Fetch API instances! This means feature-rich, standard way of handling requests and defining responses, end-to-end. This may not look like a big deal at first but that changes once you dive deeper.</p>
<p>Let’s say you wish to read the intercepted request’s body as <code>FormData</code>. This used to be a big point of friction in the past, but it’s a matter of using the platform now:</p>
<div data-rehype-pretty-code-fragment=""><pre tabindex="0" data-language="js" data-theme="default"><code data-language="js" data-theme="default"><span data-line=""><span>http.</span><span>post</span><span>(</span><span>'/user'</span><span>, </span><span>async</span><span> ({ </span><span>request</span><span> }) </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> {</span></span>
<span data-line="" data-highlighted-line=""><span>  </span><span>const</span><span> </span><span>data</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>await</span><span> request.</span><span>formData</span><span>()</span></span>
<span data-line="" data-highlighted-line=""><span>  </span><span>const</span><span> </span><span>email</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> data.</span><span>get</span><span>(</span><span>'email'</span><span>)</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>})</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>This change also means that MSW (and <strong>you</strong>!) doesn’t need to rely on any polyfills to get all that functionality. It doesn’t have to keep internal request/response representations or contrive support for features that have been present in the platform for years. This is indeed the future and it has never been brighter.</p>
<p>To make this point stick, let me show you a request handler that emulates a video stream and injects server-side latency between <em>each individual chunk</em> of that stream.</p>
<div data-rehype-pretty-code-fragment=""><pre tabindex="0" data-language="js" data-theme="default"><code data-language="js" data-theme="default"><span data-line=""><span>import</span><span> { http } </span><span>from</span><span> </span><span>'msw'</span></span>
<span data-line=""> </span>
<span data-line=""><span>http.</span><span>get</span><span>(</span><span>'/movie'</span><span>, </span><span>async</span><span> () </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> {</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>  </span><span>// Fetch a video stream.</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>  </span><span>const</span><span> </span><span>response</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>await</span><span> </span><span>fetch</span><span>(</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>    </span><span>'https://nickdesaulniers.github.io/netfix/demo/frag_bunny.mp4'</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>  )</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>  </span><span>const</span><span> </span><span>videoStream</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> response.body</span></span>
<span data-line=""> </span>
<span data-line=""><span>  </span><span>// Create a transform stream that will delay</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>  </span><span>// each chunk before writing it back to stream.</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>  </span><span>const</span><span> </span><span>latencyStream</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>new</span><span> </span><span>TransformStream</span><span>({</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>    </span><span>read</span><span>() {},</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>    </span><span>async</span><span> </span><span>transform</span><span>(</span><span>chunk</span><span>, </span><span>controller</span><span>) {</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>      </span><span>await</span><span> </span><span>new</span><span> </span><span>Promise</span><span>((</span><span>resolve</span><span>) </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>setTimeout</span><span>(resolve, </span><span>500</span><span>))</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>      controller.</span><span>enqueue</span><span>(chunk)</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>    },</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>  })</span></span>
<span data-line=""> </span>
<span data-line=""><span>  </span><span>// Pipe the original video stream through the latency stream.</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>  </span><span>return</span><span> </span><span>new</span><span> </span><span>Response</span><span>(videoStream.</span><span>pipeThrough</span><span>(latencyStream), response)</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>})</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>There is a lot going on in this request handler! But you know what’s the best part about it? The only MSW-specific part of this entire code snippet is this:</p>
<div data-rehype-pretty-code-fragment=""><pre tabindex="0" data-language="js" data-theme="default"><code data-language="js" data-theme="default"><span data-line=""><span>http.</span><span>get</span><span>(</span><span>'/movie'</span><span>, </span><span>async</span><span> () </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> {})</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p><strong>Everything else is standard JavaScript API</strong>. You can literally copy-paste that entire response resolver to your browser’s console and it will fetch the video and return you the transformed response. I hope you begin to realize how powerful this is.</p>
<p>MSW has already set a new threshold of reusability by allowing you to use the same request handlers across any environment and any tool. With 2.0, that threshold has been pushed through the roof. Use the platform, learn the platform, write code that makes sense even outside of request handlers.</p>
<h2 id="one-more-thing"><a href="#one-more-thing">One more thing</a></h2>
<p>Well, honestly, quite a bunch of things! The Fetch API support may be in the spotlight with this release but it also includes a dozen of bug fixes and improvements. MSW now ships with full compatibility with ESM, has proper code splitting, improves its internal architecture and refines its interception algorithm in Node.js.</p>
<p>You can see the full list of changes in the <a href="https://github.com/mswjs/msw/releases/tag/v2.0.0" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Release notes</a>.</p>
<h2 id="migration-guide"><a href="#migration-guide">Migration guide</a></h2>
<p>This release contains quite a number of breaking changes as the public API of the library has been reworked and improved. I know it will take you some time to adopt those changes but, trust me, you will absolutely love how your request handlers will look once you do.</p>
<p>Please follow these detailed migration guidelines to address each and every breaking change relevant to your setup:</p>

<h2 id="closing-thoughts"><a href="#closing-thoughts">Closing thoughts</a></h2>
<p>MSW went a long way from an overweekend prototype to one of the most used API mocking solutions in JavaScript. Today, it becomes <strong>the first solution to fully rely on the Fetch API primitives</strong>. I can’t wait for you to explore all the possibilities that unlocks. To many of you, MSW is already an inseparable part of their testing and development workflow, and with this release it will become the same for many more.</p>
<p>Working on the library full-time would be my dream. Unfortunately, it is quite far from becoming the reality. But <strong>you</strong> can change that. If you believe in what I’m doing, if you want to see MSW improve and evolve, please <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/mswjs" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Sponsor the project</a>. Every contribution brings me a step closer to my dream. Thank you.</p>
<h2 id="special-thanks"><a href="#special-thanks">Special thanks</a></h2>
<p>This release would not be possible without the incredible contributors who submitted issues, tried out the release candidate versions, shared their feedback, and believed in MSW. I will do my best to list everyone involved in this release below, in alphabetical order. Rest assured, these are the true heroes.</p>

        <p><em>Translations: <a href="https://tonsky.me/blog/disenchantment/zh/">Chinese</a> <a href="https://tonsky.me/blog/disenchantment/fr/">French</a> <a href="https://tonsky.me/blog/disenchantment/hu/">Hungarian</a> <a href="https://tonsky.me/blog/disenchantment/it/">Italian</a> <a href="https://tonsky.me/blog/disenchantment/ko/">Korean</a> <a href="https://tonsky.me/blog/disenchantment/pt/">Portuguese</a> <a href="https://tonsky.me/blog/disenchantment/ru/">Russian</a> <a href="https://tonsky.me/blog/disenchantment/es/">Spanish</a></em></p>
        <p>I’ve been programming for 15 years now. Recently, our industry’s lack of care for efficiency, simplicity, and excellence started really getting to me, to the point of me getting depressed by my own career and IT in general.</p>
        <p>Modern cars work, let’s say for the sake of argument, at 98% of what’s physically possible with the current engine design. Modern buildings use just enough material to fulfill their function and stay safe under the given conditions. All planes converged to the optimal size/form/load and basically look the same.</p>
        <p>Only in software, it’s fine if a program runs at 1% or even 0.01% of the possible performance. Everybody just seems to be ok with it. People are often even proud about how inefficient it is, as in “why should we worry, computers are fast enough”:</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p><a href="https://twitter.com/tveastman/status/1039002300600147968" target="_blank">@tveastman</a>: I have a Python program I run every day, it takes 1.5 seconds. I spent six hours re-writing it in rust, now it takes 0.06 seconds. That efficiency improvement means I'll make my time back in 41 years, 24 days :-)</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>You’ve probably heard this mantra: “Programmer time is more expensive than computer time.” What it means basically is that we’re wasting computers at an unprecedented scale. Would you buy a car if it eats 100 liters per 100 kilometers? How about 1000 liters? With computers, we do that all the time.</p>
        <figure>
<a href="https://xkcd.com/2021/" target="_blank"><img src="https://tonsky.me/blog/disenchantment/software_development@2x.gif?t=1697909369" width="349" height="440"></a>        </figure>
        <h2 id="everything-is-unbearably-slow">Everything is unbearably slow</h2>
        <p>Look around: our portable computers are thousands of times more powerful than the ones that brought man to the moon. Yet every other webpage struggles to maintain a smooth 60fps scroll on the latest top-of-the-line MacBook Pro. I can comfortably play games, watch 4K videos, but not scroll web pages? How is that ok?</p>
        <p>Google Inbox, a web app written by Google, running in Chrome browser also by Google, <a href="https://twitter.com/nikitonsky/statuses/968882438024941568" target="_blank">takes 13 seconds to open moderately-sized emails</a>:</p>
        <figure>

          </video>
        </figure>
        <p>It also animates empty white boxes instead of showing their content because it’s the only way anything can be animated on a webpage with decent performance. No, decent doesn’t mean 60fps, it’s rather “as fast as this web page could possibly go”. I’m dying to see the web community answer when 120Hz displays become mainstream. Shit barely hits 60Hz already.</p>
        <p>Windows 10 <a href="https://grumpy.website/post/0PeXr1S7N" target="_blank">takes 30 minutes to update</a>. What could it possibly be doing for that long? That much time is enough to fully format my SSD drive, download a fresh build and install it like 5 times in a row.</p>
        <figure>
<img src="https://tonsky.me/blog/disenchantment/windows_update.gif?t=1697909369" width="600" height="435">        </figure>
        <blockquote>
          <p><a href="https://pavelfatin.com/typing-with-pleasure/" target="_blank">Pavel Fatin</a>: Typing in editor is a relatively simple process, so even 286 PCs were able to provide a rather fluid typing experience.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Modern text editors have higher latency than 42-year-old Emacs. Text editors! What can be simpler? On each keystroke, all you have to do is update a tiny rectangular region and modern text editors can’t do that in 16ms. It’s a lot of time. A LOT. A 3D game can fill the whole screen with hundreds of thousands (!!!) of polygons in the same 16ms and also process input, recalculate the world and dynamically load/unload resources. How come?</p>
        <p>As a general trend, we’re not getting faster software with more features. We’re getting faster hardware that runs slower software with the same features. Everything works way below the possible speed. Ever wonder why your phone needs 30 to 60 seconds to boot? Why can’t it boot, say, in one second? There are no physical limitations to that. I would love to see that. I would love to see limits reached and explored, utilizing every last bit of performance we can get for something meaningful in a meaningful way.</p>
        <h2 id="everything-is-huuuuge">Everything is HUUUUGE</h2>
        <p>And then there’s bloat. Web apps could open up to 10 times faster if you just simply blocked all ads. Google begs everyone to stop shooting themselves in the foot with the AMP initiative—a technology solution to a problem that doesn’t need any technology, just a little bit of common sense. If you remove bloat, the web becomes crazy fast. How smart do you have to be to understand that?</p>
        <p>An Android system with no apps <a href="https://grumpy.website/post/0Oz1lDOq5" target="_blank">takes up almost 6 GB</a>. Just think for a second about how obscenely HUGE that number is. What’s in there, HD movies? I guess it’s basically code: kernel, drivers. Some string and resources too, sure, but those can’t be big. So, how many drivers do you need for a phone?</p>
        <figure>
<img src="https://tonsky.me/blog/disenchantment/android_storage.jpg?t=1697909369" width="550" height="489">        </figure>
        <p>Windows 95 was 30MB. Today we have web pages heavier than that! Windows 10 is 4GB, which is 133 times as big. But is it 133 times as superior? I mean, functionally they are basically the same. Yes, we have Cortana, but I doubt it takes 3970 MB. But whatever Windows 10 is, is Android really 150% of that?</p>
        <p>Google's keyboard app routinely eats 150 MB. Is an app that draws 30 keys on a screen really five times more complex than the whole Windows 95? Google app, which is basically just a package for Google Web Search, is 350 MB! Google Play Services, which I do not use (I don’t buy books, music or videos there)—300 MB that just sit there and which I’m unable to delete.</p>
        <figure>
<img src="https://tonsky.me/blog/disenchantment/apps_storage@2x.gif?t=1697909369" width="270" height="480">        </figure>
        <p>All that leaves me around 1 GB for my photos after I install all the essential (social, chats, maps, taxi, banks etc) apps. And that’s with no games and no music at all! Remember times when an OS, apps and all your data fit on a floppy?</p>
        <p>Your desktop todo app is probably written in Electron and thus <a href="https://josephg.com/blog/electron-is-flash-for-the-desktop/" target="_blank">has a userland driver for the Xbox 360 controller in it</a>, can render 3D graphics and play audio and take photos with your web camera.</p>
        <figure>
<img src="https://tonsky.me/blog/disenchantment/slack_memory.jpg?t=1697909369" width="703" height="455">        </figure>
        <p>A simple text chat is notorious for its load speed and memory consumption. Yes, you really have to count Slack in as a resource-heavy application. I mean, chatroom and barebones text editor, those are supposed to be two of the less demanding apps in the whole world. Welcome to 2018.</p>
        <p>At least it works, you might say. Well, bigger doesn’t imply better. Bigger means someone has lost control. Bigger means we don’t know what’s going on. Bigger means complexity tax, performance tax, reliability tax. This is not the norm and should not become the norm. Overweight apps should mean a red flag. They should mean run away scared.</p>
        <h2 id="everything-rots">Everything rots</h2>
        <p>A 16GB Android phone was perfectly fine 3 years ago. Today, with Android 8.1, it’s barely usable because each app has become at least twice as big <em>for no apparent reason</em>. There are no additional features. They are not faster or more optimized. They don’t look different. They just...grow?</p>
        <p>The iPhone 4s was released with iOS 5, but can barely run iOS 9. And it’s not because iOS 9 is that much superior—it’s basically the same. But their new hardware is faster, so they made software slower. Don’t worry—you got exciting new capabilities like...running the same apps with the same speed! I dunno.</p>
        <p>iOS 11 dropped support for 32-bit apps. That means if the developer isn’t around at the time of the iOS 11 release or isn’t willing to go back and update a once-perfectly-fine app, chances are you won’t be seeing their app ever again.</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>@<a href="https://twitter.com/jckarter/statuses/1017071794245623808" target="_blank">jckarter</a>: A DOS program can be made to run unmodified on pretty much any computer made since the 80s. A JavaScript app might break with tomorrow’s Chrome update</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Web pages working today <a href="https://tonsky.me/blog/chrome-intervention/">would not be compatible with any browser in 10 years time</a> (probably sooner).</p>
        <p>“It takes all the running you can do, to keep in the same place”. But what’s the point? I might enjoy occasionally buying a new phone and new MacBook as much as the next guy, but to do so just to be able to run all the same apps which just became slower?</p>
        <p>I think we can and should do better than that. Everyone is busy building stuff for right now, today, rarely for tomorrow. But it would be nice to also have stuff that lasts a little longer than that.</p>
        <h2 id="worse-is-better">Worse is better</h2>
        <p>Nobody understands anything at this point. Neither do they want to. We just throw barely baked shit out there, hope for the best and call it “startup wisdom”.</p>
        <p>Web pages ask you to refresh if anything goes wrong. Who has time to figure out what happened?</p>
        <figure>

        <p>Any web app produces a constant stream of “random” JS errors in the wild, even on compatible browsers.</p>
        <p>The whole webpage/SQL database architecture is built on a premise (hope, even) that nobody will touch your data while you look at the rendered webpage.</p>
        <p>Most collaborative implementations are “best effort” and have many common-life scenarios in which they lose data. Ever seen this dialogue “which version to keep?” I mean, the bar is so low today that your users would be happy to at least have a window like that.</p>

        <p>And no, in my world, an app that says “I’m gonna destroy some of your work, but you get to choose which one” is not okay.</p>
        <p>Linux kills random processes <em>by design</em>. And yet it’s the most popular server-side OS.</p>
        <p>Every device I own fails regularly one way or another. My Dell monitor needs a hard reboot from time to time because there’s software in it. Airdrop? You’re lucky if it’ll detect your device, otherwise, what do I do? Bluetooth? The spec is so complex that devices <a href="https://thewirecutter.com/blog/understanding-bluetooth-pairing-problems/" target="_blank">won’t talk to each other</a> and <a href="http://time.com/4358533/bluetooth-fix-how/" target="_blank">periodic resets are the best way to go</a>.</p>

        <p>And I’m not even touching the <a href="https://twitter.com/internetofshit" target="_blank">Internet of Things</a>. It’s so far beyond the laughing point I’m not even sure what to add.</p>
        <p>I want to take pride in my work. I want to deliver working, stable things. To do that, we need to understand what we are building, in and out, and that’s impossible to do in bloated, over-engineered systems.</p>
        <h2 id="programming-is-the-same-mess">Programming is the same mess</h2>
        <p>It just seems that nobody is interested in building quality, fast, efficient, lasting, foundational stuff anymore. Even when efficient solutions have been known for ages, we still struggle with the same problems: package management, build systems, compilers, language design, IDEs.</p>
        <p>Build systems are inherently unreliable and periodically require full clean, even though all info for invalidation is there. Nothing stops us from making build processes reliable, predictable and 100% reproducible. Just nobody thinks its important. NPM has stayed in “sometimes works” state for years.</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p><a href="https://twitter.com/przemyslawdabek/status/940547268729606145" target="_blank">@przemyslawdabek</a>: It seems to me that <code>rm -rf node_modules</code> is indispensable part of workflow when developing Node.js/JavaScript projects.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>And build times? Nobody thinks compiler that works minutes or even hours is a problem. What happened to “programmer’s time is more important”? Almost all compilers, pre- and post-processors add significant, sometimes disastrous time tax to your build without providing proportionally substantial benefits.</p>
        <figure>
<a href="https://xkcd.com/303/" target="_blank"><img src="https://tonsky.me/blog/disenchantment/compiling.gif?t=1697909369" width="413" height="360"></a>        </figure>
        <p>You would expect programmers to make mostly rational decisions, yet sometimes they do the exact opposite of that. E.g. choosing Hadoop <a href="https://www.chrisstucchio.com/blog/2013/hadoop_hatred.html" target="_blank">even when it’s slower than running the same task on a single desktop</a>.</p>
        <p>Machine learning and “AI” moved software to guessing in the times when most computers are not even reliable enough in the first place.</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p><a href="https://twitter.com/freetonik/status/1039826129190875136" target="_blank">@rakhim</a>: When an app or a service is described as “AI-powered” or “ML-based”, I read it as “unreliable, unpredictable, and impossible to reason about behavior”. I try to avoid “AI” because I want computers to be the opposite: reliable, predictable, reasonable.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>We put virtual machines inside Linux, and then we put Docker inside virtual machines, simply because nobody was able to clean up the mess that most programs, languages and their environment produce. We cover shit with blankets just not to deal with it. “Single binary” is still a HUGE selling point for Go, for example. No mess == success.</p>
        <figure>

        <p>And dependencies? People easily add overengineered “full package solutions” to solve the simplest problems without considering their costs. And those dependencies bring other dependencies. You end up with a tree that is something in between of horror story (OMG so big and full of conflicts) and comedy (there’s no reason we include these, <a href="https://medium.com/@jdan/i-peeked-into-my-node-modules-directory-and-you-wont-believe-what-happened-next-b89f63d21558" target="_blank">yet here they are</a>):</p>
        <figure>

        <p>Programs can’t work for years without reboots anymore. Sometimes <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/operations/unicorn.html#unicorn-worker-killer" target="_blank">even days are too much to ask</a>. Random stuff happens and nobody knows why.</p>
        <p>What’s worse, nobody has time to stop and figure out what happened. Why bother if you can always buy your way out of it. Spin another AWS instance. Restart process. Drop and restore the whole database. Write a watchdog that will restart your broken app every 20 minutes. Include same resources <a href="https://blog.timac.org/2017/0410-analysis-of-the-facebook-app-for-ios-v-87-0/" target="_blank">multiple times, zip and ship</a>. Move fast, don’t fix.</p>
        <p>That is not engineering. That’s just lazy programming. Engineering is understanding performance, structure, limits of what you build, deeply. Combining poorly written stuff with more poorly written stuff goes strictly against that. To progress, we need to understand what and why are we doing.</p>
        <h2 id="were-stuck-with-it">We’re stuck with it</h2>
        <p>So everything is just a pile of barely working code added on top of previously written barely working code. It keeps growing in size and complexity, diminishing any chance for a change.</p>
        <p>To have a healthy ecosystem you <em>need</em> to go back and revisit. You <em>need</em> to occasionally throw stuff away and replace it with better stuff.</p>
        <figure>

        <p>But who has time for that? We haven’t seen new OS kernels in what, 25 years? It’s just too complex to simply rewrite by now. Browsers are so full of edge cases and historical precedents by now that nobody dares to write layout engine from scratch.</p>
        <p>Today’s definition of progress is either <a href="https://twitter.com/sahrizv/status/1018184792611827712" target="_blank">throw more fuel into the fire</a>:</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>@sahrizv: 2014 - We must adopt #microservices to solve all problems with monoliths.</p>
          <p>2016 - We must adopt #docker to solve all problems with microservices</p>
          <p>2018 - We must adopt #kubernetes to solve all problems with docker</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>or <a href="https://twitter.com/dr_c0d3/status/1040092903052378112" target="_blank">reinventing the wheel</a>:</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>@dr_c0d3: 2000: Write 100s of lines of XML to "declaratively" configure your servlets and EJBs.</p>
          <p>2018: Write 100s of lines of YAML to "declaratively" configure your microservices.</p>
          <p>At least XML had schemas...</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>We’re stuck with what we have, and nobody will ever save us.</p>
        <h2 id="business-wont-care">Business won’t care</h2>
        <p>Neither will users. They are only learned to expect what we can provide. We (engineers) say every Android app takes 350 MB? Ok, they’ll live with that. We say we can’t give them smooth scrolling? Ok, they’ll live with a phone that stutter. We say “if it doesn’t work, reboot”? They’ll reboot. After all, they have no choice.</p>
        <p>There’s no competition either. Everybody is building the same slow, bloated, unreliable products. Occasional jump forward in quality does bring competitive advantage (iPhone/iOS vs other smartphones, Chrome vs other browsers) and forces everybody to regroup, but not for long.</p>
        <p>So it’s our mission as engineers to show the world what’s possible with today’s computers in terms of performance, reliability, quality, usability. If we care, people will learn. And there’s nobody but us to show them that it’s very much possible. If only we care.</p>
        <h2 id="its-not-all-bad">It’s not all bad</h2>
        <p>There are some bright spots indicating that improving over state-of-the-art is not impossible.</p>
        <p>Work <a href="https://twitter.com/mjpt777" target="_blank">Martin Thompson</a> has being doing (<a href="https://github.com/LMAX-Exchange/disruptor" target="_blank">LMAX Disruptor</a>, <a href="https://github.com/real-logic/simple-binary-encoding" target="_blank">SBE</a>, <a href="https://github.com/real-logic/aeron" target="_blank">Aeron</a>) is impressive, refreshingly simple and efficient.</p>
        <p><a href="https://github.com/google/xi-editor" target="_blank">Xi editor</a> by Raph Levien seems to be built with the right principles in mind.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/jblow888" target="_blank">Jonathan Blow</a> has a language he alone develops for his game that can compile 500k lines per second on his laptop. That’s cold compile, no intermediate caching, no incremental builds.</p>
        <p>You don’t have to be a genius to write fast programs. There’s no magic trick. The only thing required is not building on top of a huge pile of crap that modern toolchain is.</p>
        <h2 id="better-world-manifesto">Better world manifesto</h2>
        <p>I want to see progress. I want change. I want state-of-the-art in software engineering to improve, not just stand still. I don’t want to reinvent the same stuff over and over, less performant and more bloated each time. I want something to believe in, a worthy end goal, a future better than what we have today, and I want a community of engineers who share that vision.</p>
        <p>What we have today is not progress. We barely meet business goals with poor tools applied over the top. We’re stuck in local optima and nobody wants to move out. It’s not even a good place, it’s bloated and inefficient. We just somehow got used to it.</p>
        <p>So I want to call it out: where we are today is bullshit. As engineers, we can, and should, and will do better. We can have better tools, we can build better apps, faster, more predictable, more reliable, using fewer resources (orders of magnitude fewer!). We need to understand deeply what we are doing and why. We need to deliver: reliably, predictably, with topmost quality. We can—and should–take pride in our work. Not just “given what we had...”—no buts!</p>
        <p>I hope I’m not alone at this. I hope there are people out there who want to do the same. I’d appreciate if we at least start talking about how absurdly bad our current situation in the software industry is. And then we maybe figure out how to get out.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://github.com/mthiim/dilithium-java">https://github.com/mthiim/dilithium-java</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37984404">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-target="readme-toc.content">
            <article itemprop="text"><h2 tabindex="-1" id="user-content-crystals---dilithium" dir="auto"><a href="#crystals---dilithium">CRYSTALS - Dilithium</a></h2>
<p dir="auto">This is a Java implementation of Dilithium, based on the C reference implementation and documentation. Further, I've wrapped it into a JCE provider, making it easy to use via a standardized interface.</p>
<p dir="auto">So what is Dilithium? The cryptographic algorithms RSA and ECC have long been known known to be vulnerable to attacks using quantum computers via Shor's algorithm. While quantum computers of the prerequisite size do not yet exist in practice, there's an ongoing search for algorithms that don't have this vulnerability. In fact, <a href="https://www.nist.gov/" rel="nofollow">NIST</a> has been running a competition for over 6 years in order to identify quantum-safe alternatives. On July 5th NIST <a href="https://www.nist.gov/news-events/news/2022/07/nist-announces-first-four-quantum-resistant-cryptographic-algorithms" rel="nofollow">announced</a> the three picks for Post-quantum digital signature schemes. Dilithium was among the three and was in fact recommended as the primary algorithm. Big congratulations to the authors! I wanted to study this new algorithm, and what better way than to try and implement it. This is what you are looking at :-)</p>
<p dir="auto">Dilithium is part of the CRYSTALS suite of algorithms and is based on algebratic lattices. Think linear algebra but where the matrix/vector entries are polynomials in the ring <math-renderer data-static-url="https://github.githubassets.com/static" data-run-id="d56876d3d9cd8ad22bf1d84727d4e456">$R_q = \mathbb{Z}_q[X]/(X^n+1)$</math-renderer>. For much more information (including the specification and C reference implementation I used), see <a href="https://pq-crystals.org/index.shtml" rel="nofollow">their page</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto">Like the reference implementation, this implementation supports all three documented security levels (levels 2, 3 and 5), all using the deterministic signature scheme. It passes all the KAT tests from the package. It supports serialization and deserialization using the documented formats.</p>
<p dir="auto">I have a dependency on Bouncy castle, which provides the SHAKE128/256 algorithms used internally in Dilithium.</p>
<p dir="auto"><em>IMPORTANT! This is a "for fun" implementation written in a couple of days. It's not intended to be production-grade code. No warranty or support of any kind is provided. However, it can be useful for diving into and experimenting with post-quantum algorithms. Use it at your own risk. If you don't like those terms, you must refrain from using this software.</em></p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" id="user-content-loading-the-security-provider" dir="auto"><a href="#loading-the-security-provider">Loading the security provider</a></h2>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="DilithiumProvider provider = new DilithiumProvider();
Security.addProvider(provider);"><pre>DilithiumProvider provider = new <span>DilithiumProvider</span>();
Security.addProvider(provider)<span>;</span></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">If you wish, instead of adding the provider using addProvider(), you can omit this line and explicitly provide the provider-object when calling the .getInstance() methods (see below).</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" id="user-content-key-pair-generation" dir="auto"><a href="#key-pair-generation">Key pair generation</a></h2>
<p dir="auto">To generate a key pair you use:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="SecureRandom sr = new SecureRandom();
KeyPairGenerator kpg = KeyPairGenerator.getInstance(&quot;Dilithium&quot;);
kpg.initialize(DilithiumParameterSpec.LEVEL2, sr);			
KeyPair kp = kpg.generateKeyPair();"><pre>SecureRandom sr = new <span>SecureRandom</span>();
KeyPairGenerator kpg = KeyPairGenerator.getInstance(<span><span>"</span>Dilithium<span>"</span></span>)<span>;</span>
kpg.initialize(DilithiumParameterSpec.LEVEL2, sr)<span>;</span>			
KeyPair kp = <span>kpg.generateKeyPair</span>();</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Note that you must provide an algorithm parameter spec representing the desired security level - the above example uses level 2, but you can select 3 and 5 as well. The three parameter spec objects are declared as static fields on the DilithiumParameterSpec class. Alternatively, a static method, getSpecForSecurityLevel(), is provided on DilithiumParameterSpec, allowing you to easily retrieve the spec for a given level at runtime.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" id="user-content-signing" dir="auto"><a href="#signing">Signing</a></h2>
<p dir="auto">Having generated a key pair, signing works just the same as for other JCE providers. The example below signs a byte representation of "Joy!".</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="Signature sig = Signature.getInstance(&quot;Dilithium&quot;);
sig.initSign(kp.getPrivate());
sig.update(&quot;Joy!&quot;.getBytes());
byte[] signature = sig.sign();"><pre>Signature sig = Signature.getInstance(<span><span>"</span>Dilithium<span>"</span></span>)<span>;</span>
<span>sig.initSign(kp.getPrivate</span>());
<span>sig.update("Joy!".getBytes</span>());
byte[] signature = <span>sig.sign</span>();</pre></div>
<h2 tabindex="-1" id="user-content-signature-verification" dir="auto"><a href="#signature-verification">Signature verification</a></h2>
<p dir="auto">Just as for signing, verification works as for other JCE providers</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="Signature sig = Signature.getInstance(&quot;Dilithium&quot;);
sig.initVerify(kp.getPublic());
sig.update(&quot;Joy!&quot;.getBytes());
boolean b = sig.verify(signature);"><pre>Signature sig = Signature.getInstance(<span><span>"</span>Dilithium<span>"</span></span>)<span>;</span>
<span>sig.initVerify(kp.getPublic</span>());
<span>sig.update("Joy!".getBytes</span>());
boolean b = sig.verify(signature)<span>;</span></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">The boolean variable b now contains the outcome of the verification. Note that exceptions may be thrown in case of malformed signatures (as opposed to signatures that are merely incorrect).</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" id="user-content-key-serializationdeserialization" dir="auto"><a href="#key-serializationdeserialization">Key serialization/deserialization</a></h2>
<p dir="auto">You can use the .getEncoded() method on the public and private key objects to obtain a byte representation of the key. The formats are compatible with the reference implementation.
In order to instantiate the keys from the byte representation, a key factory is provided. You can use this with the provided DilithiumPublicKeySpec and DilithiumPrivateKeySpec classes.
They are constructed using two parameters, namely the parameter spec (same as used for generating) and the byte representation. Note that the parameter spec is not encoded into the byte representation, and I decided to make the parameter choice explit rather than trying to infer it from length. In the future, I anticipate that ASN.1-based formats with OID's etc. will be standardized, and they will then explcitly encode the parameters. Of course, the serialization format could change as well as the standardization process moves along.</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="byte[] pubkeyBytes = kp.getPublic().getEncoded(); // This is our bytes to be instantiated
KeyFactory kf = KeyFactory.getInstance(&quot;Dilithium&quot;);
PublicKey reconsructedPublicKey = kf.generatePublic(new DilithiumPublicKeySpec(spec, pubkeyBytes));"><pre>byte[] pubkeyBytes = <span>kp.getPublic().getEncoded</span>(); // This is our bytes to be instantiated
KeyFactory kf = KeyFactory.getInstance(<span><span>"</span>Dilithium<span>"</span></span>)<span>;</span>
PublicKey reconsructedPublicKey = kf.generatePublic(new DilithiumPublicKeySpec(spec, pubkeyBytes))<span>;</span></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">The private key may be reconstructed in the same fashion, using the DilithiumPrivateKeySpec class.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" id="user-content-low-level-use" dir="auto"><a href="#low-level-use">Low-level use</a></h2>
<p dir="auto">As an alternative to the low-level interface you can also use the static methods in the Dilithium class directly to generate, sign and verify. See e.g. how the JCE classes do it.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" id="user-content-running-the-known-answer-tests" dir="auto"><a href="#running-the-known-answer-tests">Running the known-answer tests</a></h2>
<p dir="auto">The official Dilithium package contains a known-answer test generator that generates a request and response file. I've provided a Java utility in KAT.java that can read the
request file generated by the reference implementation, run through the tests and generate a corresponding response file. You can then compare this response file to the one
generated by the official known-answer test generator and verify that they are byte-identical. The KAT.java program is run with parameters:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content=" <input-request-file> <output-response-file> <level>"><pre> <span>&lt;</span>input-request-file<span>&gt;</span> <span>&lt;</span>output-response-file<span>&gt;</span> <span>&lt;</span>level<span>&gt;</span></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Note that the desired security level (2, 3 or 5) must be provided as the 3rd argument. This must match what is configured in the config.h file in the C implementation when generating the response file used for comparison.</p>

Plant growth is declining all over the planet, and new research links the phenomenon to decreasing moisture in the air—a consequence of climate change.</p>

<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/5/8/eaax1396" target="_blank">study</a>&nbsp;published yesterday in&nbsp;<em>Science Advances</em>&nbsp;points to satellite observations that revealed expanding vegetation worldwide during much of the 1980s and 1990s. But then, about 20 years ago, the trend stopped.</p>

<p>Since then, more than half of the world’s vegetated landscapes have been experiencing a “browning” trend, or decrease in plant growth, according to the authors.</p>

<p>Climate records suggest the declines are associated with a metric known as vapor pressure deficit—that’s the difference between the amount of moisture the air actually holds versus the maximum amount of moisture it could be holding. A high deficit is sometimes referred to as an atmospheric drought.</p>

<p>Since the late 1990s, more than half of the world’s vegetated landscapes have experienced a growing deficit, or drying pattern.</p>

<p>Climate models indicate that vapor pressure deficit is likely to continue increasing as the world warms—a pattern that “might have a substantially negative impact on vegetation,” the authors write.</p>

<p>It’s not the first study to document the global decline in vegetation. A&nbsp;<a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/329/5994/940.abstract" target="_blank">2010 study</a>&nbsp;in&nbsp;<em>Science</em>&nbsp;was among the first to demonstrate that the greening increases of the 1990s had stalled or reversed. That study also suggested that the declines were probably water-related.</p>

<p>That’s not to say every last corner of Earth is losing its vegetation. Some recent studies have revealed that parts of the Arctic are “greening” as the chilly landscape warms. And there’s increasing plant growth still happening in other regions of the world, as well.</p>

<p>But on a global scale, averaged across the entire planet, the trend is pointing downward.</p>

<p>The declines challenge an argument often presented by skeptics of mainstream climate science to downplay the consequences of global warming: the idea that plants will grow faster with larger amounts of carbon dioxide. The argument hinges on the idea that food supplies will increase.</p>

<p>It’s largely a red herring, as climate scientists have patiently explained for years. Rising CO2 does benefit plants, at least up to a point, but it’s just one factor. Plants are also affected by many other symptoms of climate change, including rising temperatures, changing weather patterns, shifts in water availability and so on.</p>

<p>Many researchers have suggested that climate change, on the whole, is likely to be a net negative for much of the world’s vegetation, including agricultural crops. The new study would seem to suggest that those consequences are already in motion.</p>

<p>And as climate change affects plant growth, declining plant growth may also affect the pace of climate change.</p>

<p>Just last week, an anticipated&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/report/srccl/">report</a>&nbsp;from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change emphasized the importance of land and vegetation as climate mitigation tools (<a href="https://www.eenews.net/stories/1060880385/" target="_blank"><em>Climatewire</em></a>, Aug. 8). Forests and other vegetated landscapes tend to be significant carbon sinks, sucking carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere and storing it away. Less growth, on the other hand, means less carbon storage.</p>

<p>Atmospheric moisture, like carbon dioxide, is just one factor among many that may affect the world’s vegetation in the coming years. But since the drying trends seem to have had a particularly significant impact over the last two decades, the authors suggest that it “must be examined carefully when evaluating future carbon cycle responses.”</p>

E-commerce platform Shopify is suing a 'John Doe' defendant for sending numerous false copyright complaints. The DMCA takedown notices have targeted a variety of vendors, who had their legitimate products taken offline as a result of the fraudulent actions. In addition, these vendors risked losing their entire accounts due to multiple false claims.
</p>

<p><img decoding="async" src="https://torrentfreak.com/images/shopify-logo.jpg" alt="shopify" width="300" height="203" srcset="https://torrentfreak.com/images/shopify-logo.jpg 462w, https://torrentfreak.com/images/shopify-logo-300x203.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20300%20203'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-srcset="https://torrentfreak.com/images/shopify-logo.jpg 462w, https://torrentfreak.com/images/shopify-logo-300x203.jpg 300w" data-lazy-src="https://torrentfreak.com/images/shopify-logo.jpg">The DMCA takedown process gives copyright holders the option to remove infringing content from the web.</p>
<p>It’s a powerful, widely-used tool that takes millions of URLs and links offline every day. This often happens for a good reason, but some takedown efforts are questionable.</p>
<h2>Takedown Abuse</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.shopify.com/">Shopify</a> was targeted by a series of problematic DMCA requests earlier this month. The e-commerce platform typically receives thousands of takedown notices per month from rightsholders, which are in part processed automatically. That works well in most instances, but not always. </p>
<p>Starting on October 5, an unknown person created the account “Sacha Go” which was subsequently used to file dozens of DMCA takedown requests. The notices targeted listings on a variety of shops selling perfume products, claiming that they infringe copyright. </p>
<p>After being alerted by one of the targeted merchants Shopify looked into the matter, concluding that all takedowns were false. Instead of containing legitimate claims the DMCA notices were being used to harass Shopify and its merchants.</p>
<h2>Shopify Files Lawsuit</h2>
<p>The account information provided by “Sacha Go” turned out to be false. To stop this activity and any related to future accounts the defendant may create, Shopify filed a complaint alleging DMCA violations at a federal court in New York.</p>
<p>“Defendant Doe has sent Shopify dozens of DMCA takedown notices littered with misrepresentations, claiming that materials Shopify merchants have posted to their online stores supposedly infringe Doe’s copyrights. But Doe does not actually own any of the copyrights to which he claims ownership in these notices,” Shopify writes. </p>
<center><img decoding="async" src="https://torrentfreak.com/images/shop-suit.jpg" alt="shopift suit" width="600" height="485" srcset="https://torrentfreak.com/images/shop-suit.jpg 1115w, https://torrentfreak.com/images/shop-suit-300x242.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20600%20485'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-srcset="https://torrentfreak.com/images/shop-suit.jpg 1115w, https://torrentfreak.com/images/shop-suit-300x242.jpg 300w" data-lazy-src="https://torrentfreak.com/images/shop-suit.jpg"></center>
<p>Shopify says that it’s not feasible for the company to investigate the validity of all takedown notices in detail. As such, these false claims resulted in actual removals and the affected stores also received strikes on their accounts. </p>
<h2>Merchants at Risk</h2>
<p>The strikes will be removed if the merchant files a successful counternotice, but those can take up to two weeks to process. Also, those who are not aware of their right to appeal risk losing their accounts. </p>
<p>“[F]or unsuspecting merchants who may be unfamiliar with the DMCA, a sudden onslaught of takedown notices can result in the termination of their entire store under Shopify’s repeat infringer policy,” Shopify explains. </p>
<p>The defendant stands accused of sending more than 70 fraudulent takedown notices from October 5 to October 13, targeting at least twenty perfume shops with bogus copyright claims. These false claims resulted in 52 strikes against various stores. </p>
<h2>Shopify Seeks Damages and an Injunction</h2>
<p>On October 12, Shopify launched an investigation and the company ultimately restored all items and removed all strikes, but that came at significant cost. </p>
<p>“Those efforts cost Shopify tens of thousands of dollars in personnel time and resources. The loss of goodwill that Shopify suffered from penalizing innocent merchants cannot be quantified,” the company explains.</p>
<p>The defendant’s motivations are currently unknown, but it’s certainly possible that they run a competing perfume store. If that’s the case, these takedown notices were likely intended to harm competitors. </p>
<p>Through discovery, Shopify hopes to identify the John Doe and hold them responsible for the recent wave of DMCA abuse. In addition to requesting damages, Shopify also seeks an injunction to prevent more false DMCA notices going forward. </p>
