<p>You may not need any incentive to do this, but I’m going to argue that moving from WhatsApp to Signal is an important action, right now. There are other alternatives to WhatsApp, of course, but several have received criticism over various issues so I’m going to focus on Signal here. Please comment below if you’d like to propose ethical alternatives to WhatsApp. &nbsp;</p>



<p>In March I argued that we should <a href="https://greenstarsproject.org/2025/03/30/bluesky-an-ethical-replacement-for-x-twitter/"><strong>choose Bluesky over X/Twitter</strong></a>, based on the obvious reason of boycotting companies connected to Musk. Bluesky is structured as a benefit corporation (like Patagonia) and based on an open network, two features that create strong incentives for the company to not upset its users.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>This creates an alignment between Bluesky and its users – Bluesky is disincentivized to make a bad user experience. This also acts as a kind of poison pill against a billionaire takeover, or at least a deterrent against this.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Moving from X/Twitter to Bluesky does require some sacrifice for people who worked hard to build up a following on the former. But we’ve reached a point where support of Musk is unconscionable, whatever the sacrifice involved. The move from WhatsApp to Signal, however, is quite straightforward and completely painless. But in this case, some may be wondering, <em>why should I bother moving at all?</em></p>

<h2>Ethical issues with WhatsApp</h2>



<p>My biggest issues with using WhatsApp are related to its parent corporation, Meta (formerly Facebook) and its founder/CEO Mark Zuckerberg. But first, I want to mention a few issues specific to WhatsApp.</p>



<p>In early 2021, WhatsApp updated its terms of service, requiring users to opt into <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2021/01/12/whatsapps-new-terms-of-service-are-a-facebook-or-die-ultimatum/">sharing their data</a> with Facebook – including network details and location (even if you haven’t turned on location sharing). This 180° reversal on an <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/how-facebook-undermines-privacy-protections-for-its-2-billion-whatsapp-users">earlier promise</a> made by Zuckerberg that “WhatsApp is going to operate completely autonomously” was one of several events over the last 5 years that accelerated an exodus from WhatsApp to Signal. The large amount of metadata that WhatsApp collects is also shared with law enforcement agencies.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>WhatsApp shares metadata, unencrypted records that can reveal a lot about a user’s activity, with law enforcement agencies such as the Department of Justice. Some rivals, such as Signal, intentionally gather much less metadata to avoid incursions on its users’ privacy, and thus share far less with law enforcement. – <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/how-facebook-undermines-privacy-protections-for-its-2-billion-whatsapp-users">ProPublica</a></p>
</blockquote>



<p>I have to admit that I don’t give a huge amount of time fretting over these things during normal times. But we no longer live in normal times – people are now guilty by suspicion (or by association, based on their WhatsApp contacts) and convicted without due process.</p>



<p>Over the years, Zuckerberg and Meta have done more flip flopping than a White Lotus guest (walking around in flip-flops, you see). Facebook has since been <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/IP_17_1369">fined</a> €110 million by EU antitrust regulators and <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2019/07/ftc-imposes-5-billion-penalty-sweeping-new-privacy-restrictions">$5 billion</a> by the US Federal Trade Commission for deceiving regulators and users. Following this greater level of scrutiny, Zuckerberg has shown himself to be a person of little scruples, capitulating to whoever will do him favors.</p>



<h2>Meta and Zuckerberg</h2>



<p>Meta – a company so bad that it had to change its name to try to clean its reputation. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook%E2%80%93Cambridge_Analytica_data_scandal">Facebook–Cambridge Analytica scandal</a> involved the collection of user data without consent to create <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychographics">psychographic profiles</a> that were used in Donald Trump’s 2016 election campaign and suppressing Black voters in Trinidad and Tobago. WhatsApp, in particular, played a role in the Brazil’s 2018 election.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The vast majority of false information shared on WhatsApp in Brazil during the presidential election favoured the far-right winner, Jair Bolsonaro. The analysis sheds light on the spread of misinformation on the Facebook-owned app, with fears it could be poisoning political debate in one of the largest democracies in the world. – <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/30/whatsapp-fake-news-brazil-election-favoured-jair-bolsonaro-analysis-suggests">The Guardian</a>.</p>
</blockquote>



<blockquote>
<p>Companies supporting Jair Bolsonaro are buying a service called “mass blasts,” using the candidate’s list of WhatsApp users or buying lists from agencies specializing in digital strategy. – <a href="https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/internacional/en/brazil/2018/10/businessmen-fund-whatsapp-campaign-against-pt.shtml">Folha de S.Paulo</a>.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In 2018, Zuckerberg testified before US Congress, admitting: “It was my mistake, and I’m sorry.”</p>



<p>Aww! You’re totally forgiven, Zuck! You’ve learned your lesson, right?</p>



<p>But wait! Last year, as you probably know, Zuckerberg did the cowardly act of endorsing Trump by implication. I happened to catch this interview with the Zuck live on Bloomberg and was totally gagged (Hey Gen Z readers!). Take a look and marvel at Zuck sticking to his guns and maintaining his neutrality:</p>



<figure><div>
<p><iframe title="Zuckerberg Calls Trump 'Badass' Without Endorsing Him #politics" width="720" height="405" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bE7SyQWf4_U?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
</div></figure>



<p>Post-election, Zuck flew down to Florida for dinner with Trump (I’m imagining scenes from the hunting episode of <em>Succession</em>) and then got rid of DEI and moderation and all that weak stuff. It didn’t take long for Zuck to switch from humility (<em>It was my mistake, and I’m sorry</em>) to going on the Joe Rogan show to say this:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Masculine energy is good, and obviously, society has plenty of that, but I think corporate culture was really trying to get away from it,” Zuckerberg continued. “I think having a culture that celebrates the aggression a bit more has its own merits that are really positive.” – <a href="https://mashable.com/article/mark-zuckerberg-joe-rogan-masculine-feminine-energy">Mashable</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Ethical review of Signal</h2>



<p>Signal provides a very similar user experience to WhatsApp, so switching over is pretty seamless. This is not too surprising, considering that the current CEO of Signal LLC., Brian Action, was one of the cofounders of WhatsApp. WhatsApp was acquired by Facebook in 2014, and Acton <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/whatsapp-co-founder-acton-named-signals-interim-ceo-2022-01-10/">left the company</a> three years later due to differences around the use of customer data and targeted advertising.</p>



<p>A year later, Acton contributed $50 million to launch a non-profit, the Signal Foundation and a subsidiary, Signal Messenger, LLC.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>On 21 February 2018, Moxie Marlinspike and WhatsApp co-founder Brian Acton announced the formation of the Signal Technology Foundation, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization whose mission is “to support, accelerate, and broaden Signal’s mission of making private communication accessible and ubiquitous”. – <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_(software)#History">Wikipedia</a></p>
</blockquote>



<p>When the Electronic Frontier Foundation <a href="https://www.eff.org/pages/secure-messaging-scorecard">ranked messaging apps</a> for privacy and transparency, Signal was one of the few that received a perfect score. The nonprofit also has an <a href="https://ssd.eff.org/module/how-to-use-signal">updated guide</a> to using Signal, navigating its settings, etc.</p>



<p>The protection of data and personal privacy is important. The nonprofit Signal Foundation is led by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meredith_Whittaker">Meredith Whittaker</a>, a former director of the AI Now Institute at NYU, which examined the social impacts of AI and concentration of power in tech. She is a strong proponent of protecting privacy as a human right and an opponent of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance_capitalism">surveillance capitalism</a>. Signal’s predecessor, Open Whisper Systems <a href="https://cyberscoop.com/tor-signal-funding-donald-trump-steve-bannon-encryption/">received funding from</a> journalism nonprofit Freedom of the Press Foundation.</p>

<h3>Action plan for migrating from WhatsApp</h3>



<p>It’s easy to see how we all get drawn into using specific apps like WhatsApp – the user base reaches a critical size and it becomes the app to find everyone on. At the same time, the company becomes more lucrative (and in many cases is taken over by a bigger fish) and then ethical issues creep in. We learn to suppress our concerns because the app is just too convenient and, to quote The Cranberries, <em>Everybody Else Is Doing It, So Why Can’t We? </em>(R.I.P., Dolores).</p>



<p>The exit plan from WhatsApp is quite simple. Start by installing Signal and setting it up – it takes only a couple of minutes. Then, resume any WhatsApp conversations on Signal if that person is already a Signal user. If they are not, then switch to regular text messaging and gently suggest to that person to switch over to Signal. [Shout out to CeCe for reminding me to install Signal!] Group chats are a good way to get people to switch over as nobody will want to be the person who can’t be bothered making the switch.</p>



<p>The interference with elections is not OK.</p>



<p>I’ll leave the last word to future president, AOC:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Meta as in ‘we are a cancer to democracy metastasizing into a global surveillance and propaganda machine for boosting authoritarian regimes and destroying civil society… for profit!'” – <a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/facebook-to-meta-a-new-name-but-the-same-old-problems/">Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez</a></p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                    
<p>In recent months, we have received numerous reports from users across West Asia and North Africa (WANA) expressing alarm over a little-known but deeply intrusive bloatware application—AppCloud—pre-installed on Samsung’s A and M series smartphones. Without users’ knowledge or consent, this bloatware collects sensitive personal data, cannot be removed without compromising device security, and offers no clear information about its privacy practices.</p>



<p>AppCloud, developed by the controversial Israeli-founded company ironSource (now owned by the American company <a href="https://investors.unity.com/news/news-details/2022/Unity-Announces-Merger-Agreement-with-ironSource/default.aspx">Unity</a>), is embedded into devices sold in countries where such affiliations carry legal implications. Despite the serious privacy and security risks, Samsung has offered no transparency on how AppCloud functions, what data it collects, or why users cannot opt out.</p>



<p>This open letter, addressed to Samsung, calls for immediate transparency, accountability, and dialogue. Users deserve to know what is installed on their devices and how their data is being used, especially amid Israel’s espionage campaigns in the region.&nbsp;</p>



<p>_________</p>



<p>To Whom it May Concern,&nbsp;</p>



<p>We are writing to urgently request that Samsung be transparent regarding the pre-installation of AppCloud on its A and M series smartphones, particularly in West Asia and North Africa (WANA). We ask that Samsung provide information about AppCloud’s privacy practices, opt-out and removal options, and that Samsung reconsider future pre-installations in light of privacy rights. We also request a meeting with Samsung teams to discuss these concerns further.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Since the expansion of Samsung’s <a href="https://www.nasdaq.com/press-release/ironsource-expands-samsung-partnership-launching-on-samsung-mobile-devices-in-mena">partnership</a> with ironSource in 2022, AppCloud has been embedded by default on <a href="https://smex.org/invasive-israeli-software-is-harvesting-data-from-samsung-users-in-wana/">new A and M devices distributed in this region</a>.</p>



<p>According to our <a href="https://smex.org/invasive-israeli-software-is-harvesting-data-from-samsung-users-in-wana/">analysis</a>, this intrusive software is <strong>unremovable</strong>, deeply integrated into the devices’ operating system, making it nearly impossible for regular users to uninstall it without root access, which voids warranties and poses security risks. Even disabling the bloatware is not effective as it can reappear after system updates.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The privacy policy is <strong>opaque, </strong>there is no accessible and transparent privacy policy for this bloatware and users are in the dark about what data is collected and how it is used. There is also no straightforward opt-out mechanism. The bloatware collects sensitive user data, including biometric information, IP addresses, device fingerprints.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The installation of AppCloud is done <strong>without any consent </strong>from the user, which violates GDPR provisions in the EU and relevant data protection laws in the WANA region states.&nbsp;</p>



<p>AppCloud is developed by ironSource, <strong>an Israel-founded company (now acquired by American company Unity),</strong> raising additional legal and ethical concerns in countries where Israeli companies are barred from operating, such as <a href="https://www.lexismiddleeast.com/law/Lebanon/Law_1_1955">Lebanon</a>. ironSource is notorious for its questionable practices regarding user consent and data privacy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Samsung’s terms of service mention third party applications but do not specifically address AppCloud or ironSource, despite the significant data access and control granted to this bloatware app.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The forced installation of AppCloud <strong>undermines the privacy and security rights of users in the MENA region and beyond.</strong> The lack of transparency and control over personal data is particularly alarming given<a href="https://telecomlead.com/smart-phone/smartphone-strategies-in-middle-east-for-market-share-119061"> Samsung’s <strong>significant market share in the region</strong></a>.</p>



<p>In light of these concerns, we respectfully request that Samsung:</p>



<ul>
<li>Disclose the full privacy policy and data handling practices of AppCloud, making this information easily accessible to all users.</li>



<li>Offer a straightforward and effective method for users to opt out of AppCloud and remove it from their devices without compromising device functionality or warranty.</li>



<li>Provide a clear explanation for the decision to pre-install AppCloud on all A and M series devices in the WANA region.</li>



<li>Reconsider the continued pre-installation of AppCloud on future devices, in line with the right to privacy as established by Article 12 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.</li>



<li>We also request a <strong>meeting with the relevant Samsung teams</strong> to discuss these issues in detail and to better understand the company’s approach to user privacy and data protection in the WANA region.</li>
</ul>



<p>We look forward to your prompt response and to working together to ensure the privacy and security of all Samsung users.</p>

            <span>Abstract:</span>Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly capable of processing long inputs and locating specific information within them, as evidenced by their performance on the Needle in a Haystack (NIAH) test. However, while models excel at recalling surprising information, they still struggle to identify clearly omitted information. We introduce AbsenceBench to assesses LLMs' capacity to detect missing information across three domains: numerical sequences, poetry, and GitHub pull requests. AbsenceBench asks models to identify which pieces of a document were deliberately removed, given access to both the original and edited contexts. Despite the apparent straightforwardness of these tasks, our experiments reveal that even state-of-the-art models like Claude-3.7-Sonnet achieve only 69.6% F1-score with a modest average context length of 5K tokens. Our analysis suggests this poor performance stems from a fundamental limitation: Transformer attention mechanisms cannot easily attend to "gaps" in documents since these absences don't correspond to any specific keys that can be attended to. Overall, our results and analysis provide a case study of the close proximity of tasks where models are already superhuman (NIAH) and tasks where models breakdown unexpectedly (AbsenceBench).

We're here today at AMD's Advancing AI 2025 event, where the MI350 series has just been announced. And I have the pleasure to introduce, Alan Smith from AMD.</span></p><p><strong>Alan:</strong><span> Hello, everyone.</span></p><p><strong>George:</strong><span> What do you do at AMD?</span></p><p><strong>Alan</strong><span>: So I'm the chief architect of Instinct GPUs.</span></p><p><strong>George</strong><span>: Awesome, what does that job entail?</span></p><p><strong>Alan</strong><span>: So I'm responsible for the GPU product line definition, working with our data center GPU business partners to define the-, work with them on the definition of the requirements of the GPUs, and then work with the design teams to implement those requirements.</span></p><p><strong>George:</strong><span> Awesome. So, moving into MI350: MI350's still GFX9 based, and- for you guys in the audience, GFX9 is also known as Vega, or at least derivative of GFX9. Why is it that MI350 is still on GFX9, whereas clients such as RDNA 3 and 4, GFX11 and 12 respectively?</span></p><p><strong>Alan:</strong><span> Sure, yeah, it's a great question. So as you know, the CDNA architecture off of, you know, previous generations of Instinct GPUs, starting with MI100 and before, like you said, in the Vega generations, were all GCN architecture, which was Graphics Core Next. And over several generations, CDNA's been highly optimized for the types of distributed computing algorithms for high-performance computing and AI. And so we felt like starting with that base for MI350 would give us the right pieces that we needed to deliver the performance goals that we had for the MI350 series.</span></p><p><strong>George:</strong><span> And with GCN, as you know, there's a separate L1 cache and LDS, or Local Data Store. Why is that still in MI350? And why haven't they been merged?</span></p><p><strong>Alan:</strong><span> Yeah, so like you said, you know, it is a legacy piece of the GCN architecture. It's sort of fundamental to the way the compute unit is built. So we felt like in this generation, it wasn't the right opportunity to make a microarchitectural change of that scale. So what we did instead, was we increased the capacity of the LDS. So previously in MI300 series, we had a 64 kilobyte LDS, and we've increased that capacity to 160 kilobytes in MI350 series. And in addition to that, we increased the bandwidth as well. So we doubled the bandwidth of the LDS into the register file, in order to be able to feed the Tensor Core rates that we have in the MI350 series.</span></p><p><strong>George:</strong><span> And speaking of Tensor Cores, you've now introduced microscaling formats to MI350x for FP8, FP6, and FP4 data types. Interestingly enough, a major differentiator for MI350 is that FP6 is the same rate as FP4. Can you talk a little bit about how that was accomplished and why that is?</span></p><p><strong>Alan:</strong><span> Sure, yep, so one of the things that we felt like on MI350 in this timeframe, that it's going into the market and the current state of AI... we felt like that FP6 is a format that has potential to not only be used for inferencing, but potentially for training. And so we wanted to make sure that the capabilities for FP6 were class-leading relative to... what others maybe would have been implementing, or have implemented. And so, as you know, it's a long lead time to design hardware, so we were thinking about this years ago and wanted to make sure that MI350 had leadership in FP6 performance. So we made a decision to implement the FP6 data path at the same throughput as the FP4 data path. Of course, we had to take on a little bit more hardware in order to do that. FP6 has a few more bits, obviously, that's why it's called FP6. But we were able to do that within the area of constraints that we had in the matrix engine, and do that in a very power- and area-efficient way.</span></p><p><strong>George:</strong><span> And speaking of data types, I've noticed that TF32 is not on your ops list for hardware level acceleration. Why remove that feature from... or why was that not a major consideration for MI350?</span></p><p><strong>Alan:</strong><span> Yeah, well, it was a consideration, right? Because we did remove it. We felt like that in this timeframe, that brain float 16, or BF16, would be a format that would be leverageable for most models to replace TF32. And we can deliver a much higher throughput on BF16 than TF32, so we felt like it was the right trade off for this implementation.</span></p><p><strong>George:</strong><span> And if I was to use TF32, what would the speed be? Would it still be FP32, the speed of FP32?</span></p><p><strong>Alan:</strong><span> You have a choice. We offer some emulation, and I don't have all the details on the exact throughputs off the top of my head; but we do offer emulation, software-based emulation using BF16 to emulate TF32, or you can just cast it into FP32 and use it at FP32 rate.</span></p><p><strong>George:</strong><span> And moving from the CU up to the XCD, which is the compute die; the new compute die's now on N3P, and yet there's been a reduction from 40 CUs to 36 CUs physically on the die with four per shader engine fused off. Why 32 CUs now, and, why that reduction?</span></p><p><strong>Alan:</strong><span> Yeah, so on MI300, we had co-designed for both MI300X and MI300A, one for HPC and one for AI. In the MI300A, we have just six XCDs. And so, we wanted to make sure when we only had six of the accelerator chiplets that we had enough compute units to power the level of HPC or high-performance computing - which is traditional simulation in FP64 - to reach the performance levels that we wanted to hit for the leadership-class supercomputers that we were targeting with that market.</span></p><p>And so we did that and delivered the fastest supercomputer in the world along with Lawrence Livermore, with El Capitan. But so as a consideration there, we wanted to have more compute units for XCD so that we could get 224 total within MI300A. On 350, where it's designed specifically as an accelerator only, a discrete accelerator, we had more flexibility there. And so we decided that having a power of two number of active compute units per die - so 36 physical, like you said, but we enable 32. Four of them, one per shader engine, are used for harvesting and we yield those out in order to give us good high-volume manufacturing through TSMC-N3, which is a leading edge technology. So we have some of the spare ones that allow us to end up with 32 actually enabled.</p><p>And that's a nice power of two, and it's easy to tile tensors if you have a power of two. So most of the tensors that you're working with, or many of them, would be matrices that are based on a power of two. And so it allows you to tile them into the number of compute units easily, and reduces the total tail effect that you may have. Because if you have a non-power of two number of compute units, then some amount of the tensor may not map directly nicely, and so you may have some amount of work that you have to do at the end on just a subset of the compute unit. So we find that there's some optimization there by having a power of two.</p><p><strong>George:</strong><span> While the new compute unit is on N3P, the I/O die is on N6; why stick with N6?</span></p><p><strong>Alan:</strong><span> Yeah, great question. What we see in our chiplet technology, first of all, we have the choice, right? So being on chiplets gives you the flexibility to choose different technologies if appropriate. And the things that we have in the I/O die tend not to scale as well with advanced technologies. So things like the HBM5s, the high-speed certis, the caches that we have with the Infinity Cache, the SRAMs, those things don't scale as well. And so sticking with an older technology with a mature yield on a big die allows us to deliver a product cost and a TCO (Total Cost of Ownership) value proposition for our clients. And then we're able to leverage the most advanced technologies like N3P for the compute where we get a significant benefit in the power- and area-scaling to implement the compute units.</span></p><p><strong>George:</strong><span> And speaking of, other than the LDS, what's interesting to me is that there have not been any cache hierarchy changes. Why is that?</span></p><p><strong>Alan:</strong><span> Yeah, great question. So if you remember what I just said about MI300 being built to deliver the highest performance in HPC. And in order to do that, we needed to deliver significant global bandwidth into the compute units for double precision floating point. So we had already designed the Infinity Fabric and the fabric within the XCC or the Accelerated Compute Core to deliver sufficient bandwidth to feed the really high double precision matrix operations in MI300 and all the cache hierarchy associated with that. So we were able to leverage that amount of interconnecting capabilities that we had already built into MI300 and therefore didn't need to make any modifications to those.</span></p><p><strong>George:</strong><span> And with MI350, you've now moved from four base dies to two base dies. What has that enabled in terms of the layout of your top dies?</span></p><p>Alan: Yeah, so what we did, as you mentioned, so in MI350, the I/O dies, there's only two of them. And then each of them host four of the accelerator chiplets versus in MI300, we had four of the I/O dies, with each of them hosting two of the accelerator chiplets. So that's what you're talking about.</p><p>So what we did was, we wanted to increase the bandwidth from global, from HBM, which, MI300 was designed for HBM3 and MI350 was specially designed for HBM3E. So we wanted to go from 5.2 or 5.6 gigabit per second up to a full 8 gigabit per second. But we also wanted to do that at the lowest possible power, because delivering the bytes from HBM into the compute cores at the lowest energy per bit gives us more power at a fixed GPU power level, gives us more power into the compute at that same time. So on bandwidth-bound kernels that have a compute element, by reducing the amount of power that we spend in data transport, we can put more power into the compute and deliver a higher performance for those kernels.</p><p>So what we did by combining those two chips together into one was we were able to widen up the buses within those chips; so we deliver more bytes per clock, and therefore we can run them at a lower frequency and also a lower voltage, which gives us the V-squared scaling of voltage for the amount of power that it takes to deliver those bits. So that's why we did that.</p><p><strong>George:</strong><span> And speaking of power, MI350x is 1000 watts, and MI355x is 1400 watts. What are the different thermal considerations when considering that 40% uptick in power, not just in terms of cooling the system, but also keeping the individual chiplets within tolerances?</span></p><p><strong>Alan:</strong><span> Great question, and obviously we have some things to consider for our 3D architectures as well.</span></p><p>So when we do our total power and thermal architecture of these chips, we consider from the motherboard all the way up to the daughterboards, which are the UBB (Universal Baseboard), the OAM (OCP Accelerator Module) modules in this case, and then up through the stack of CoWoS (Chip on Wafer on Substrate), the I/O dies, which are in this intermediate layer, and then the compute that's above those. So we look at the total thermal density of that whole stack, and the amount of thermal transport or thermal resistance that we have within that stack, and the thermal interface materials that we need in order to build on top of that for heat removal, right?</p><p>And so we offer two different classes of thermal solutions for MI350 series. One of them air-cooled, like you mentioned. The other one is a direct-attach liquid cool. So the cold plate would then, in the liquid cool plate, liquid-cooled case would directly attach to the thermal interface material on top of the chips. So we do thermal modeling of that entire stack, and work directly with all of our technology partners to make sure that the power densities that we build into the chips can be handled by that entire thermal stack up.</p><p><strong>George:</strong><span> Awesome, and since we're running short on time, the most important question of this interview is, what's your favorite type of cheese?</span></p><p><strong>Alan:</strong><span> Oh, cheddar.</span></p><p><strong>George:</strong><span> Massively agree with you. What's your favorite brand of cheddar?</span></p><p><strong>Alan:</strong><span> I like the Vermont one. What is that, oh... Calbert's? I can't think of it. [Editor's note: It's Cabot Cheddar that is Alan's favorite]</span></p><p><strong>George:</strong><span> I know my personal favorite's probably Tillamook, which is, yeah, from Oregon. But anyway, thank you so much, Alan, for this interview.</span></p><p>If you would like to support the channel, hit like, hit subscribe.

    Inspired by <a href="https://wikitok.vercel.app/" target="_blank">WikiTok</a>, I thought I'd make something to discover
    sounds uploaded to Wikimedia. From political speeches and bird noises to genuine bangers,
    it's mostly wholesome, though I cant guarantee it won't play you something horrible once in a while.</p><p>
    If you want shorter sounds, try it in Revolution 9 Mode.

<p><a href="https://electrek.co/guides/byd/">BYD</a> has now begun testing solid-state EV batteries in its Tesla Model 3-rivalling Seal. Initial tests suggest that the total driving range could reach nearly 1,200 miles (1,875 km).</p>



<h2 id="h-byd-begins-testing-solid-state-ev-batteries-in-the-seal">BYD begins testing solid-state EV batteries in the Seal</h2>



<p>It has been over a decade since BYD first began researching and developing the promising new EV battery technology.</p>



<p>Last year, the company reached a milestone by testing its first solid-state battery cells with capacities of 20 Ah and 60 Ah. We knew BYD was planning to launch its first vehicles powered by the new batteries in 2027 after Sun Huajun, the CTO of BYD’s battery business, <a href="https://electrek.co/2025/02/17/byd-confirms-evs-all-solid-state-batteries-2027/">confirmed the timeline</a> earlier this year.</p>



<p>At the 2025 China All-Solid-State Battery Innovation and Development Summit, Sun stated that BYD has officially installed solid-state batteries in its popular Seal EV and is now testing them on roads.</p>	
	



<p>Once testing is finalized, which is expected to occur in 2027, BYD plans to begin installing solid-state batteries in its production vehicles.</p>

<p>Between 2027 and 2029, production will be limited during the first two years. However, in 2030, BYD plans to begin mass production. BYD has previously said that by the end of the decade, it expects “liquid and solid to be the same price.” In other words, solid-state batteries will be about the same cost as current liquid lithium-ion batteries.</p>



<p>The Seal, BYD’s Tesla Model 3-rivalling electric sedan, is expected to be the first EV available with solid-state batteries, starting in 2027. Other models will begin to hit the market in 2028 and the following years.</p>

<p>BYD’s solid-state batteries have an energy density of 400 Wh/kg, or nearly twice that of current lithium-ion batteries.</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://post.smzdm.com/p/a0zp33or/">local reports</a>, BYD’s solid-state EV batteries set a record by gaining 1,500 km (932 miles) range in just 12 minutes of charging. </p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" height="512" width="1024" src="https://electrek.co/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/06/BYD-Seal-Toyota-3.jpeg?quality=82&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1024" alt="BYD-Seal-solid-state-EV-batteries" srcset="https://electrek.co/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/06/BYD-Seal-Toyota-3.jpeg 1400w, https://electrek.co/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/06/BYD-Seal-Toyota-3.jpeg?resize=150,75 150w, https://electrek.co/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/06/BYD-Seal-Toyota-3.jpeg?resize=300,150 300w, https://electrek.co/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/06/BYD-Seal-Toyota-3.jpeg?resize=768,384 768w, https://electrek.co/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/06/BYD-Seal-Toyota-3.jpeg?resize=1024,512 1024w, https://electrek.co/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/06/BYD-Seal-Toyota-3.jpeg?resize=350,175 350w, https://electrek.co/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/06/BYD-Seal-Toyota-3.jpeg?resize=140,70 140w, https://electrek.co/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/06/BYD-Seal-Toyota-3.jpeg?resize=290,145 290w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption>BYD Seal EVs models in Japan (Source: BYD)</figcaption></figure>



<p>The test charged the battery to just 80%, meaning total EV range could reach upwards of 1,875 km (1,165 miles). Keep in mind, that is CLTC range. On the EPA scale, it would be closer to 1,300 km (808 miles), which is still way more than enough.</p>



<p>BYD’s Seal currently starts at just 175,800 yuan in China, or about $25,000. When it initially hits the market in 2027 with solid-state batteries, the Seal will likely be priced higher.</p>



<h2 id="h-electrek-s-take">Electrek’s Take</h2>




	<p>BYD is already dominating the global EV market. It just surpassed Tesla in Europe and the UK in monthly registrations for the first time, and this could be just the start.</p>



<p>With several new batteries and plenty of other EV technologies, including ultra-fast chargers, smart driving features, and advanced new platforms, BYD is laying the groundwork for more growth over the next few years.</p>



<p>Not only that, BYD is already known for its low-cost cars like the Seagull (Dolphin Surf in Europe), priced under $10,000 in China. The new tech is expected to unlock longer driving range, faster charging, and lower costs.</p>



<p>BYD will compete with CATL, Mercedes-Benz, Volkswagen, Stellantis, Nissan, and several others that are also aiming to launch their first EVs with solid-state batteries around 2027 or 2028. Nissan’s director of product planning in Europe, Christop Ambland, confirmed the company’s timeline this week with&nbsp;<em><a href="https://www.autoexpress.co.uk/nissan/367112/nissan-deliver-solid-state-battery-tech-production-car-2028" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Auto Express</a></em>, saying, “We will be ready for SSB (solid-state batteries) in 2028.”</p>

        <p>As we’re all celebrating the <a href="https://www.jaws50th.com/?ref=ironicsans.ghost.io" rel="noreferrer">50th anniversary</a> of the movie <em>Jaws</em>, here’s something I bet you didn’t know: Due to a fluke of publishing and copyright law, the <em>Jaws</em> shark is public domain.</p><p>It’s not the <em>character</em> of the shark that’s public domain – or someone would surely be making a low-budget horror prequel about how he became the Amity Island Killer. But I’m talking about the famous shark painting from the movie poster:</p><figure><img src="https://ironicsans.ghost.io/content/images/2025/06/poster.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy" width="889" height="1358" srcset="https://ironicsans.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2025/06/poster.jpg 600w, https://ironicsans.ghost.io/content/images/2025/06/poster.jpg 889w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Yep. That painting, the same one that appeared on the cover of the paperback edition of the novel, is public domain.</p><p>This is kind of a wild story.</p><p>When the book first came out, it didn’t have this cover art. An old <em>New York Times</em> <a href="https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1974/04/21/119458470.html?pageNumber=266&amp;ref=ironicsans.ghost.io" rel="noreferrer">article</a> about the book’s origin explains that the author, Peter Benchley, actually had his own idea for the cover. He thought it should show “a peaceful unsuspecting town through the bleached jaws of a shark.” He pitched his idea to Doubleday, who was publishing the hardcover version of the book.</p><p>So Doubleday senior editor Tom Congdon worked with art director Alex Gotfryd and had an artist produce this mock-up:</p><figure><img src="https://ironicsans.ghost.io/content/images/2025/06/image-1.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="330" height="482"><figcaption><span>Art by Wendell Minor</span></figcaption></figure><p>Congdon didn’t like it. He said, “the shark’s bones look too liplike and pendulous.” A preview of the cover was shown at a book sales manager’s conference, and there was “considerable resistance” from the salesmen who said it resembled a vagina with teeth.</p><p>The book was supposed to come out in January, 1974, but publication was delayed until February to rework the cover.</p><p>Congdon asked, “Can we have just a fish on the cover?”</p><p>But Gotfryd said no. “The cover’s not big enough. It will look like a sardine.”</p><p>So they settled on no image at all. The first printed cover was just black:</p><figure><img src="https://ironicsans.ghost.io/content/images/2025/06/original-cover.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1270" height="1858" srcset="https://ironicsans.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2025/06/original-cover.jpg 600w, https://ironicsans.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2025/06/original-cover.jpg 1000w, https://ironicsans.ghost.io/content/images/2025/06/original-cover.jpg 1270w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><span>From an eBay listing that was asking for $7,500. It didn’t sell.</span></figcaption></figure><p>Bantam had purchased the paperback rights to the book, but when Bantam president Oscar Dystal saw the empty cover, he didn’t like it. He said, “Without an image, no one would know what <em>Jaws</em> was. It could have been a book about dentistry.” It needed a shark.</p><p>So Gotfryd contacted an artist named Paul Bacon who made a rough sketch of the shark’s head, and at Gotfryd’s suggestion added a swimmer for scale. The next day, Bacon came back with the finished artwork that became the new hardcover dust jacket:</p><figure><img src="https://ironicsans.ghost.io/content/images/2025/06/image-2.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="925" height="1381" srcset="https://ironicsans.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2025/06/image-2.png 600w, https://ironicsans.ghost.io/content/images/2025/06/image-2.png 925w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Congdon later said, “We realized that the new version looked like a penis with teeth. But was that bad?”</p><p>Has any other design project ever gone from “we can’t use that because it looks like a vagina with teeth” to “that looks like a penis with teeth but let’s go with it?”</p><p>A year later, when Bantam was preparing to publish the paperback edition, they hired artist Roger Kastel to make an updated version of the cover. He went to the Museum of Natural History to study sharks, and he had a model pose across a couple of stools for reference of what someone looks like swimming. He used those elements in creating the now-famous illustration:</p><figure><img src="https://ironicsans.ghost.io/content/images/2025/06/paperback-cover.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy" width="600" height="989" srcset="https://ironicsans.ghost.io/content/images/2025/06/paperback-cover.jpg 600w"><figcaption><span>Here’s a whole other rabbit hole: The snow leopard exhibit in the Central Park Zoo is actually </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/13/nyregion/13snow.html?ref=ironicsans.ghost.io" rel="noreferrer"><span>named after</span></a><span> the model who posed for this cover, Allison Maher.

Kastel’s <a href="http://www.rogerkastel.com/biography.htm?ref=ironicsans.ghost.io" rel="noreferrer">official website</a> says that “Universal Studios, so impressed by the work, purchased the right to use this image as the poster for the movie.”</p><p>But a 2012 <a href="https://www.empireonline.com/movies/features/jaws-unsung-heroes/?ref=ironicsans.ghost.io" rel="noreferrer">article</a> in <em>Empire</em> says that Universal actually got the rights from Bantam for free:</p><blockquote>Impressed by the cover, Universal purloined Kastel’s work for the movie poster — Bantam books chief Oscar Dystel gave it to the filmmakers for free, losing out on millions of dollars — and it quickly became iconic.</blockquote><p>Whether Universal paid for the rights or not, Kastel became bitter about all the places it was showing up.</p><p>In 2015, he <a href="https://nypost.com/2015/07/26/how-the-famous-poster-from-jaws-was-created-and-lost/?ref=ironicsans.ghost.io" rel="noreferrer">told</a> the New York Post, “What really bothered me was that they used the image for merchandising. You see that poster on everything.” And in 2020, Kastel <a href="https://michaelpcoleman.wordpress.com/2020/07/18/jaws-iconic-artwork-and-the-artist-behind-it/?ref=ironicsans.ghost.io" rel="noreferrer">told</a> writer Michael P. Coleman, “We were floored by how they merchandised that image, from t-shirts to cartoons.”</p><p>It’s unclear when exactly Kastel realized that there was something fishy about the painting’s copyright situation. I can only speculate that at some point he wondered if he was entitled to some of the money from all the licensing, and discovered that the copyright to the image had never been properly established.</p><p>See, when he made the painting in 1975, copyright was still ruled by a 1909 law that said you had to include a copyright notice upon publication of a work, and that notice had to include your name. When the book was published, it carried no such notice for the artwork. It only had a copyright notice for the text. That meant that the painting became public domain as soon as it was published.</p><p>In a bit of timing bad luck, a new copyright law enacted just a year after the book came out eliminated the notice requirement.</p><p>So in early 2013, almost 40 years after <em>Jaws</em> was published, Kastel filed a copyright application for the <em>Jaws</em> illustration. But the copyright office denied it.</p><p>He filed an appeal. They denied that, too.</p><p>In 2014, he submitted a final appeal to the Copyright Office Review Board, and the <a href="https://www.copyright.gov/rulings-filings/review-board/docs/2014-appeal-JawsIllustration2014.pdf?ref=ironicsans.ghost.io" rel="noreferrer">decision</a> from the board is <a href="https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Jaws_Illustration_%28USCO_Review_Board%2C_2014%29?ref=ironicsans.ghost.io" rel="noreferrer">available</a> to read online. The main points are:</p><ul><li>The image was published without a proper copyright notice, so it became public domain under the law at the time.</li><li>The fact that the book said “Copyright © 1974 Peter Benchley” isn’t good enough to let the public know that the cover is copyrighted because that’s not the name of the cover art’s copyright owner.</li><li>This situation is not like magazines and anthologies, which are collective works with multiple contributors that can be covered by a single copyright notice. One illustration on the cover of a novel doesn’t make it a collective work.</li><li>If Benchley had licensed the artwork from Kastel or had some other legal relationship, that might make a difference. But he didn’t, so the works are unrelated and require separate notices.</li></ul><p>So the review board unambiguously rejected the claim:</p><blockquote>The Board has concluded that the copyright notice in the Book, which includes only Peter Benchley’s name, does not meet the statutory notice requirement under the 1909 Act and, as such, the Work was forfeited to the public domain upon its publication.</blockquote><p>So whether Universal paid anything for permission to use the artwork becomes a moot point because it turns out that they didn’t need permission. And anyone could have sold merchandise with the image without paying any licensing fees to Universal, Bantam, or Kastel.</p><p>Kastel <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/17/arts/roger-karl-kastel-dead-jaws-poster.html?ref=ironicsans.ghost.io" rel="noreferrer">died</a> in 2023 and, while he didn’t see any <em>Jaws</em> royalties from merchandise that featured his artwork, he did get more work as a result of it, including illustrating the <em>Gone With The Wind-</em>inspired poster for <em>The Empire Strikes Back</em>.</p><figure><img src="https://ironicsans.ghost.io/content/images/2025/06/wind-empire.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1290" height="1000" srcset="https://ironicsans.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2025/06/wind-empire.jpg 600w, https://ironicsans.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2025/06/wind-empire.jpg 1000w, https://ironicsans.ghost.io/content/images/2025/06/wind-empire.jpg 1290w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><span>How did I never notice this before?</span></figcaption></figure><p>One thing that Kastel definitely did own is the original artwork used for the <em>Jaws</em> book cover and poster. Unfortunately, the painting went missing in 1976 and nobody knows where it is.</p><p>One story goes that the painting went on a national tour to promote the book, making stops to appear in various book store windows, and then disappeared somewhere in Hollywood. Or it may have been last seen hanging in an exhibit at the Society of Illustrators in New York.</p><p>Kastel’s son Matthew thinks it was last seen at the New York Historical Society. At least that’s what he said in an article a few years back for <a href="https://www.dailyartmagazine.com/jaws-missing-painting/?ref=ironicsans.ghost.io" rel="noreferrer">Daily Art Magazine</a> but I suspect he was actually thinking of the Society of Illustrators. Either way, he wrote:</p><blockquote>But the question remains. What happened to my father’s work?<p>Where is one to start on a mystery over 45 years old with no clues? Outside of putting my father’s&nbsp;<em>Jaws</em>&nbsp;illustration on the back of milk cartons under the caption&nbsp;<em>MISSING</em>, I have no clue.</p><p>Was the painting simply lost, misplaced, or thrown away like an old movie prop by Universal out of lack of care or ignorance? Or was it stolen somewhere in Universal’s care by an admirer and/or enterprising thief?</p><p>My recourse is limited. By writing this article, I am taking a longshot approach that someone out there reading this may know about its whereabouts or fate and step forward. </p></blockquote><p>If you happen to know where the original <em>Jaws</em> painting is, <a href="http://thirdstrikeproductions.com/contact.htm?ref=ironicsans.ghost.io" rel="noreferrer">here</a> is where you can reach out to Matthew Kastel.</p><p>So that’s the story of how a pop culture icon became freely available for anyone to use. It’s good that creative works eventually become public domain, but I also believe an artist should be able to enjoy the fruits of his work in his lifetime if he wants to. So while I’m usually in favor of the commons, I feel like this time... it’s personal.</p><p>Fin.</p><figure><img src="https://ironicsans.ghost.io/content/images/2025/06/horiz-2.gif" alt="" loading="lazy" width="295" height="22"></figure><p>What a story.

I thought that was interesting and dug deeper. As I went down that rabbit hole I learned about the situation with Kastel’s better-known paperback illustration.</p><p>If you liked this article, you can show your support by becoming a <a href="https://ironicsans.ghost.io/#/portal/signup" rel="noreferrer">paid subscriber</a> of this newsletter, a <a href="https://ironicsans.ghost.io/#/portal/signup" rel="noreferrer">free subscriber</a> if you aren’t already, or by giving a <a href="https://buymeacoffee.com/ironicsans?ref=ironicsans.ghost.io" rel="noreferrer">one-time tip</a>, or just leaving a comment or reply to tell me you liked it.</p><p>And here’s a personal fun fact for people who got this far: My wedding was at the Society of Illustrators.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.euractiv.com/section/tech/news/scoop-commission-eyes-ditching-microsoft-azure-for-frances-ovhcloud-over-digital-sovereignty-fears/">https://www.euractiv.com/section/tech/news/scoop-commission-eyes-ditching-microsoft-azure-for-frances-ovhcloud-over-digital-sovereignty-fears/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44331045">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="metered-article"><p>
<strong>The European Commission is in advanced business negotiations with OVHcloud, the France-based major European cloud service provider, to transition its cloud services away from Microsoft, according to three senior sources with internal knowledge of the matter who spoke to Euractiv on condition of anonymity.</strong>
</p>
<p>
The infrastructure shift is being driven by a push for European digital sovereignty in the cloud market, following <a href="https://www.euractiv.com/section/tech/news/microsofts-email-shutdown-of-icc-prosecutor-fuels-eu-fears-of-us-tech-blackmail/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">concerns raised</a> by a US executive order that led to the shutdown of Microsoft services for an employee of a European-based institution.
</p>
<p>
The goal of the move would be to ensure that European institutions have greater control over their digital infrastructure and data – an idea that has been championed by the <a href="https://www.euractiv.com/section/tech/news/european-industry-big-win-germany-france-both-support-sovereign-eu-based-tech-infrastructure/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">EuroStack initiative</a>. It is also a blow for US tech behemoth Microsoft, which has been striving to reassure its European customers in the past weeks.
</p>
<p>
Once the European Commission "gets its house into order," it is expected to set a precedent for national public administrations to direct public procurement funds towards homegrown cloud providers, one source said. The Commission sees itself as a trend setter, they added, aligning with its broader strategy to enhance the EU's digital autonomy and reduce reliance on non-European tech giants.
</p>
<p>
We understand the Commission has been in discussions with OVHcloud for several weeks. However, an unknown number of other European cloud providers, including Germany's IONOS, France's Scaleway and Italy's Aruba, are also being considered as potential alternatives.
</p>
<p>
A unique aspect of this situation is that, for the first time, the two key digital departments of the Commission – DG CNECT, which drafts and enforces digital policies, and DG DIGIT, the IT department – are under the oversight of a single Commissioner (Henna Virkkunen) with a tech sovereignty portfolio.
</p>
<p>
This consolidation has made it easier to harmonise the political and technical priorities of the European executive, our sources told us.
</p>
<p>
"Discussions are indeed underway, both with the Commission and with other public and private institutions and organisations that are evaluating projects to migrate to a sovereign cloud," an OVHcloud spokesperson told Euractiv when we sought comment.
</p>
<p>
The Commission is "constantly scanning the market" and already "has a contract with OVHcloud" a Commission spokesperson said in response to Euractiv's request for comment. It did not confirm whether the Commission will actually switch away from Microsoft Azure.
</p>
<p>
In January, Euractiv <a href="https://www.euractiv.com/section/tech/news/internal-documents-reveal-commission-fears-over-microsoft-dependency/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed</a>&nbsp;that the Commission was concerned about its reliance on Microsoft, quoting internal documents.
</p>
<p>
Additionally, the EU institutions watchdog, the European Data Protection Supervisor <a href="https://www.euractiv.com/section/tech/news/eu-commission-breached-data-protection-rules-using-microsoft-365-eu-watchdog-found/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">found</a> last year that the EU's executive is in breach of data protection rules that apply to EU institutions over its use of Microsoft Azure cloud for some of its data.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><img src="https://jiazi-pc.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/1721291943273" title="" alt=""></p><p><span>In the sweltering heat of Shanghai, Jazzyear had the privilege of meeting Professor Jürgen Schmidhuber, a distinguished guest at the 2024 World Artificial Intelligence Conference (WAIC).&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Based on years of earlier research, Schmidhuber and his student Sepp Hochreiter published the architecture and training algorithms for Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks in 1997 in a journal. This type of RNN (Recurrent Neural Network) is widely used by tech giants for applications in natural language processing, speech recognition, video games, and more, including Apple’s Siri and Google’s translation services. Prior to the advent of ChatGPT, LSTM was heralded as “the most commercially valuable achievement in AI.” The 1997 LSTM paper is the most cited AI paper of the 20th&nbsp;century, perhaps even the most cited computer science paper of the century.</span></p><p><span>Even earlier, in his “Annus Mirabilis” 1990-1991, Schmidhuber laid the foundations for Generative AI, by introducing the principles of what ‘s now called GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks), non-normalized linear Transformers, and self-supervised Pretraining. These 3 contributions correspond to the “G,” “P,” and “T” in ChatGPT, where GPT stands for Generative Pre-Trained Transformer.</span></p><p><span>Long before the so-called “Deep Learning Trio” shared a Turing Award, Schmidhuber was already being hailed as the “Father of Mature AI” by The New York Times. Elon Musk also praised him on X, stating, “Schmidhuber invented it all.”</span></p><p><span>In 2013, the International Neural Network Society (INNS) awarded Schmidhuber the Helmholtz Award. In 2016, he received the IEEE Neural Network Pioneer Award in recognition of &nbsp;his&nbsp;"pioneering contributions to deep learning and neural networks."&nbsp;Currently, he serves as Scientific Director at the Swiss AI Lab IDSIA and heads the AI initiative at King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST) in Saudi Arabia. He is also involved with several AI companies.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Therefore, this 61-year-old German luminary has sparked a discourse: Why has Schmidhuber not won a Turing&nbsp;Award？</span></p><p><span>This is a key concern for many industry professionals, but it does not include Schmidhuber himself. During our two-day in-depth conversation, Schmidhuber, donning his signature stylish black beret and speaking fluent English with a German accent, came across as a scholar who combines humor with approachability. Yet beneath this amiable exterior lies an indomitable spirit, eager to establish scientific integrity in the fast moving field of AI research.</span></p><p><span>Discussing overlooked contributions of AI pioneers—particularly groundbreaking advancements achieved by small European labs before the tech giants took notice—Schmidhuber expressed a palpable urgency to correct misleading historical records of AI.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>For years, he has engaged in public debates with Yann LeCun, Geoffrey Hinton, Yoshua Bengio, Ian Goodfellow, and others, accusing them of rehashing not only his own earlier work, but also the earlier work of others, without citing the original inventors. He backs up his claims with numerous peer-reviewed references.</span></p><p><span>Schmidhuber’s forthrightness naturally stirs controversy. However, his perspective provides a valuable counter&nbsp;to a widespread yet misleading Silicon Valley&nbsp;narrative. Moreover, he not only speaks up for himself and his outstanding students, but also tirelessly champions other underappreciated contributors to the AI field, striving to give them their due recognition.</span></p><p><span>Regarding the debate over who should be called the “Father of AI,” Schmidhuber points out that one needs an entire civilization to build an AI. He also points out that modern AI is driven by mathematical and algorithmic principles discovered decades and even centuries before the term “AI” was coined in the 1950s.</span></p><p><span>As for the controversy online, Schmidhuber&nbsp;remains&nbsp;unfazed.&nbsp;He quotes Elvis Presley, saying, “Truth is like the sun. You can shut it out for a time, but it ain’t going away.”</span></p><p><span>&nbsp;<img src="https://jiazi-pc.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/1721291983283" title="" alt=""></span></p><p><span>In this exclusive interview with Jazzyear, Schmidhuber discussed the origins of AI, which greatly predate 1956, his own research that laid the foundations of modern AI, his view of the “Deep Learning Trio,” as well as the cosmos-changing future of self-replicating, self-improving machine civilizations. He also believes that, on the journey toward AGI, even those without significant funding can bring about revolutionary changes in AI research.</span></p><h2><span>1.&nbsp;Something better than the Transformer</span></h2><p><span>&nbsp;</span><strong><span>Jazzyear:&nbsp;</span><span>Let’s start with the history of artificial intelligence. You have a deep understanding of AI’s development. What do you think needs to be clarified about AI’s history?</span></strong></p><p><strong><span>Schmidhuber:</span></strong><span>&nbsp;Oh, there is a lot.&nbsp;For example, the origins of AI date back well before the 1956 Dartmouth Conference, which is sometimes cited as AI’s inception point, because there the name “AI” was coined for a field that was already old by then. In fact, as early as 1914, the Spaniard Leonardo Torres y Quevedo designed a chess-playing automaton at a time when chess was considered a domain exclusive to intelligent beings. The theory of AI can be traced back to Kurt Gödel’s work in 1931-1934 when he identified fundamental limitations of what can be computed by any AI.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Some claim&nbsp;that artificial neural networks (NNs, now widely used) are a relatively novel concept from the 1940s and 50s. However, “modern” neural nets date back over 200 years ago. Around 1800, Carl Friedrich Gauss and Adrien-Marie Legendre introduced what we now call a linear neural network, though they called it the “least squares method.” They had training data consisting of inputs and desired outputs, and minimized training set errors through adjusting weights, to generalize on unseen test data: linear neural nets!&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>This was what’s now called “shallow learning.” Some think that the more powerful, more recent “deep learning” is a 21st-century innovation. It isn’t. In 1965, in Ukraine, Alexey Ivakhnenko and Valentin Lapa had the first working deep multilayer networks that learned. For example, Ivakhnenko’s 1970 paper detailed an eight-layer deep learning network. Regrettably, certain much later publications on very similar approaches failed to credit the Ukrainian pioneers. Our field is rife with such cases of inadvertent or deliberate plagiarism.&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong><span>Jazzyear:&nbsp;You have also played a pivotal role in AI history. Could you talk about the miraculous year of 1991? What contributions did your research make to the AI industry during that period?</span></strong></p><p><strong><span>Schmidhuber:</span></strong><span>&nbsp;Our miracle year of 1990-91. That's something I'm really proud of. At the Technical University of Munich, we were lucky enough to publish many of the basic concepts behind today's AI, in particular,&nbsp;Generative AI.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>The GPT in ChatGPT stands for Generative Pre-trained Transformer. Let’s first look at the G in GPT and in “Generative AI.” Back in 1990, I had what’s now called a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), which I initially dubbed “Artificial Curiosity.” This involves two competing neural networks—a generator with adaptive probabilistic units and a predictor influenced by the generator’s output. The predictor tries to predict how the environment will react to the outputs of the generator. It minimizes its loss by gradient descent. However, in a minimax game, the generator tries to maximize what the predictor is minimizing. Essentially, it aims to “fool” the adversary by generating surprising content. This idea later found extensive use in Deepfake applications.</span></p><p><span>As for the “P” in GPT, it refers to Pre-training, another concept I published in 1991. I saw that unsupervised or self-supervised Pre-training can greatly compress sequences, facilitating downstream deep learning for long sequences, such as very long texts.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Then there’s the T, which stands for a neural net called Transformer. The name “Transformer” was coined&nbsp;at Google in 2017. However, I had already introduced variants of the concept in 1991 under the term “fast weight controllers” or “fast weight programmers.” One of my variants is now called the “unnormalized linear Transformer.” It was even more efficient than the modern Transformer, because it scaled linearly, requiring only a hundredfold increase in computational power for a hundredfold increase in input size, unlike today’s “quadratic” Transformers, which need a ten-thousandfold increase.</span></p><p><strong><span>Jazzyear：Many, including the creators of the quadratic Transformer, have stated that we need something better than it. It is certainly not perfect. What do you think the next generation of architectures should look like?</span></strong></p><p><strong><span>Schmidhuber:</span></strong><span>&nbsp;The 1991 linear Transformer above is actually a good starting point for making quadratic Transformers more efficient.&nbsp;However, to predict the next generation of large language models (LLMs), let’s first revisit the first generation. The first LLMs of Google and Facebook utilized our Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network (RNN), which also has roots in 1991, namely, in the thesis of my brilliant student Sepp Hochreiter. This thesis not only described experiments with the aforementioned pre-training (the P in ChatGPT), but also introduced residual connections, essential for deep learning and handling long sequences. I coined the term LSTM in 1995, but the name is not important, the only thing that counts is the math. LSTM was used for LLMs until the late 2010s when Transformers, easier to parallelize and thus advantageous for modern hardware like NVIDIA GPUs, took over.</span></p><p><strong><span>Jazzyear：Can&nbsp;RNNs solve tasks that elude Transformers?&nbsp;</span></strong></p><p><strong><span>Schmidhuber:&nbsp;</span></strong><span>Yes, they are more powerful in principle. For example, parity: consider bit strings such as 01100 or 101 or 1000010101110. Given such a bit string, is the number of 1s odd or even? Looks like a simple task, but Transformers fail to generalise on it. However, even simple RNNs can quickly solve this task, as I showed decades ago.</span></p><p><span>Recently, Hochreiter’s team developed an impressive LSTM extension called xLSTM, with linear scalability, outperforming Transformers on various language benchmarks. Its exceptional understanding of text semantics, alongside its versions that can be highly parallelized, makes xLSTM a compelling candidate for future large-scale experiments.</span></p><h2><span>2.&nbsp;What&nbsp;is&nbsp;the&nbsp;linear way of thinking？</span></h2><p><strong><span>Jazzyear: You are now leading the AI initiative at King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST) in Saudi Arabia. What drew you to take up this position?</span></strong></p><p><strong><span>Schmidhuber: </span></strong><span>Before that, I mostly worked in Switzerland, which is a great place for science, leading the world in terms of Nobel prizes, patents, citations, and AI publications per capita. But they don’t have a place like KAUST, which is now the university with the highest impact per faculty, surpassing institutions like Caltech and Princeton. KAUST seemed like a great opportunity to push AI research further. Saudi funding benefits the rest of the world, since we are producing lots of open-source results that are accessible from China, the USA, and other places.&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong><span>Jazzyear: I’m sure KAUST has substantial funds and resources for AI research. Is this why big companies are more attractive? Have small independent teams or academia become unable to achieve significant breakthroughs?</span></strong></p><p><strong><span>Schmidhuber:</span></strong><span> What constitutes a “significant breakthrough”? Is it the next foreseeable 0.5% performance boost of LLMs, demanding lots of computational power and money? Or is it a real breakthrough that makes the next AI as energy-efficient as a human brain? I still believe that someone with a good idea can revolutionize AI research without requiring enormous resources.</span></p><p><strong><span>Jazzyear: Based on your diverse experiences, how do you view the differences in AI academia and industry across the US, Europe, the Middle East, and China?</span></strong></p><p><strong><span>Schmidhuber:</span></strong><span> Europe, of course, is the origin of computers, computer science, AI, deep learning etc. Most of modern AI originated there. In particular, almost all of the core deep learning techniques were developed in the previous millennium in Europe (although there were also important contributions from Japan). Europe is still producing a lot of AI talent. At some point, however, scaling became crucial, and that’s where the US and China took over.&nbsp;Europe lacks tech giants like Google, Apple, Facebook, Amazon, Alibaba, TenCent, etc, although all these companies are based on the WWW, which also originated in Europe around 1990. Today, the US and China have numerous unicorn startups, whereas Europe has just a few. Large US companies with huge market valuations can easily buy some of Europe’s best talents and entire startups such as DeepMind.&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong><span>Jazzyear: How do you think DeepMind&nbsp;has developed recently? Earlier achievements like AlphaGo and AlphaZero were published in Nature or other journals. But now, the trend is more towards OpenAI’s model of delivering excellent products directly to users.</span></strong><span>（Shane Legg, co-founder of DeepMind, was a PhD student in Schmidhuber’s Swiss lab)</span></p><p><strong><span>Schmidhuber</span></strong><span>: DeepMind once was almost like academia without its drawbacks. Their well-funded researchers could publish without having to worry about writing grant proposals or teaching. However, even a star company like DeepMind was unable to sustain independent growth. It was sold to a much bigger US company even before it became a unicorn valued at $1 billion. Now it’s just a small part of Google.</span></p><p><strong><span>Jazzyear: There’s always a comparison between academic labs and big companies. Aditya Ramesh, one of the heads of OpenAI’s video generation product Sora, recently said that academia can mainly do evaluation and measurement or research AI explainability now, lacking resources like GPUs to make more significant contributions. By the way, Aditya doesn’t have a PhD because he joined OpenAI right after his undergraduate studies.</span></strong></p><p><strong><span>Schmidhuber:</span></strong><span> Did he really say that? Anyway, such statements seem a bit naïve, reflecting a very linear way of thinking: the current trend is to scale large foundation models through more and more compute, and since some people cannot imagine anything else, let’s just extrapolate the current trend, everything else must be useless!&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong><span>Jazzyear: So, you are definitely not a fan of scaling law?</span></strong></p><p><strong><span>Schmidhuber:</span></strong><span> I am the biggest fan of the old scaling law that says: every 5 years compute is getting 10 times cheaper (this law has held since 1941 when Konrad Zuse completed the first working general purpose computer in Berlin). That scaling law is the reason why our techniques from the 1990s are now on billions of smartphones. AI is getting 100 times cheaper per decade, and everybody will profit from this, not just a few big companies.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>It’s just that the scaling of present LLMs has little to do with AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) that learns like humans learn. How does a baby learn? Not by downloading the web. It learns to collect data through self-invented experiments that improve its adaptive neural world model, which it can use for planning. All of this, however, has little to do with the LLMs that are now so popular.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Corporations must maximize shareholder value, whereas scientific research seeks unprecedented discoveries. Don’t expect these quite different objectives to be aligned!</span></p><p><strong><span>Jazzyear: But money issues are always crucial, even for science.</span></strong></p><p><strong><span>Schmidhuber:</span></strong><span> Sure, for centuries, science and art have followed the money. For example, in the 1980s and 1990s, well-funded labs in rich countries such as Japan and West Germany were the cradle of innovations such as CNNs and Generative AI, respectively. Around 1995, the combined nominal GDP of these two tiny countries, the 2 big losers of World War II, exceeded the GDP of the US (the Chinese economy was still small back then). Today, only 3 decades later, the US and China are much bigger economically (since 2017, China has been number 1 in terms of PPP), and the scaling up of these old inventions mostly happened on the Pacific Rim in industrial labs.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>I recall when I first came to China 15 years ago, I had to show taxi drivers a picture of my hotel to tell them where I was going. Now, they just lift their smartphones, and I speak the destination in English or German, and they understand. My taxi driver may not know that this is based on research results from my lab, but it’s those resourceful and powerful companies that have popularized these technologies, helping to profoundly transform daily life. They are the ones who took academic inventions and made them accessible services.</span></p><h2><span>3.&nbsp;They should be stripped of their awards</span></h2><p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Jazzyear:&nbsp;Do you like being called the “Father of Modern AI”?</span></strong></p><p><strong><span>Schmidhuber:</span></strong><span>&nbsp;A single person cannot create an AI from scratch. You need an entire civilization to build an AI. You need people to create the basic algorithms, others to build computers, others to mine the materials from which the computers are made. You also need consumers, like gamers, who drive the demand for faster computers, and farmers who grow the food for all.&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong><span>Jazzyear:&nbsp;That’s interesting. Everyone plays a role in the creation of AI.</span></strong></p><p><strong><span>Schmidhuber:</span></strong><span>&nbsp;Of course, you can trace specific neural networks to their creators. For instance, the father of convolutional neural networks (CNN) is Kunihiko Fukushima, who published the basic CNN architecture in 1979 in Japan. In 1987, Alex Waibel, a German working in Japan, combined convolutions and backpropagation, the method published 1970 in Finland by Seppo Linnainmaa, now widely used to train neural nets. Zhang (1988) published&nbsp;the first backprop-trained two-dimensional CNNs, also in Japan.&nbsp;Thus, from 1979 to 1988, modern CNNs as we know them originated in Japan.&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong><span>Jazzyear:&nbsp;You have yet to receive the Turing Award. Is this a significant regret, or do you not concern yourself with it?</span></strong></p><p><strong><span>Schmidhuber:&nbsp;</span></strong><span>How much should you care about an&nbsp;award that was also given to people who republished key methods and ideas whose creators they failed&nbsp;to credit?&nbsp;is a total no-go in science, please check my report on this on the web.</span></p><p><strong><span>Jazzyear:&nbsp;Apparently you are referring to the European-born Deep&nbsp;Learning Trio—Geoffrey Hinton, Yoshua Bengio, and Yann LeCun—who won the Turing Award. You mentioned they have not adequately cited or acknowledged your earlier work. Has your opinion of them changed?&nbsp;</span></strong></p><p><strong><span>Schmidhuber:</span></strong><span>&nbsp;No.&nbsp;They frequently re-published others’ work without proper attribution. Even worse, they failed to correct this in subsequent publications. In science, this is unacceptable. My team has particularly suffered from this behavior; their most&nbsp;prominent work directly builds on ours. But this isn’t just about my own team; relevant work of many other scientists has been republished by them without proper attribution.&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong><span>Jazzyear:&nbsp;Do you think they owe you an apology?</span></strong></p><p><strong><span>Schmidhuber:</span></strong><span>&nbsp;They have never apologized in the past when they had a chance, and have never corrected their papers accordingly. They have violated the "Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct" of ACM, &nbsp;the organisation that hands out these awards:&nbsp;computing professionals should&nbsp;"credit the creators of ideas, inventions, work, and artifacts, and respect copyrights, patents, trade secrets, license agreements, and other methods of protecting authors' works."&nbsp;The awardees didn't; instead they credited each other (and collected citations) for inventions of other researchers. However, ACM&nbsp;"retains the right to revoke an Honor previously granted if ACM determines that it is in the best interests of the field to do so."&nbsp;&nbsp;So I guess they should be stripped of their awards.&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong><span>Jazzyear:&nbsp;Do you think they&nbsp;directly&nbsp;stole your ideas？</span></strong></p><p><strong><span>Schmidhuber:</span></strong><span>&nbsp;It is well-known that&nbsp;plagiarism can be “intentional and reckless” or “unintentional.” However,&nbsp;science has a well-established way of dealing with "multiple discovery" and plagiarism, be it unintentional or not, based on facts such as time stamps of publications and patents. &nbsp;And if you unintentionally reinvent something previously published, you must publish a corrigendum and credit the original inventor in all future papers and presentations. Failing to do so disqualifies you as a scientist. In a mature field such as math, you'd never get away with plagiarism. However, the field of machine learning seems still rather immature in comparison. Anyway, science is self-correcting, and we'll see that in machine learning, too. Sometimes it may take a while to settle disputes, but in the end, the facts must always win.&nbsp;</span></p><p><img src="https://jiazi-pc.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/1721292650522" title="" alt=""></p><p><span>Schmidhuber&nbsp;and the Deep Learning Trio</span></p><p><strong><span>Jazzyear:&nbsp;Criticizing prominent figures could lead to negative comments about you online. Do you read these comments? Do you Google yourself?</span></strong></p><p><strong><span>Schmidhuber:</span></strong><span>&nbsp;Richard Feynman, the famous physicist, once wrote a book: "What Do You Care What Other People Think?" The only thing that counts in science are the facts. If the facts are known, why should you care for misleading anonymous comments by trolls on the&nbsp;web?&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Some people resort to personal attacks when they can’t refute fact-based information, following the adage, “If you can’t argue with the facts, attack the messenger.” Fortunately, unlike politics, science is immune to personal attacks. Science isn’t democratic. If 100 people claim one thing and one person presents the opposite with factual support, the latter wins.</span></p><p><span>The famous singer Elvis Presley said, “Truth is like the sun. You can shut it out for a time, but it ain’t goin’ away.</span></p><p><strong><span>Jazzyear:&nbsp;Are you jealous of the American scientists? They might be richer than you.</span></strong></p><p><strong><span>Schmidhuber:</span></strong><span>&nbsp;Jealous?&nbsp;Richer? How on earth did you come up with this&nbsp;idea? Also, wealth means nothing in science. Einstein, the most famous scientist of all time, wasn’t rich. Still, they named him “person of the century.” No, I am just happy that the Americans and many others are using our methods so much.</span></p><h2><span>4.&nbsp;Self-replicating, self-improving machine civilizations</span></h2><p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Jazzyear: Do you have any mentors or role models in the scientific community?</span></strong></p><p><strong><span>Schmidhuber:</span></strong><span> In the 1970s, as a teenager, I initially aspired to be a physicist like my awesome idol, Einstein. A few years later, I realized that within my lifetime, I might be able to create an AI scientist far more intelligent than any human, capable of solving many problems I couldn’t, thus vastly amplifying my limited creativity. This realization set the course of my life.</span></p><p><span>Overall, I am a very self-driven person, learning hard lessons from experience. My best mentors have been those who allowed me to pursue my dreams without too much interference.</span></p><p><strong><span>Jazzyear: Are there any entrepreneurs you like?</span></strong></p><p><strong><span>Schmidhuber</span></strong><span>: Sure. I like Elon Musk, who kindly invited me to his wonderful family reunion, and Jensen Huang, whose awesome NVIDIA GPUs my team used in 2010 to make deep learning fast enough to break benchmark records. I also like several other amazing but perhaps less famous entrepreneurs.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span><img src="https://jiazi-pc.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/1721292695201" title="" alt=""></span></p><p><span>Schmidhuber met with Jensen Huang (left)</span></p><p><strong><span>Jazzyear:&nbsp;In previous reports from the New York Times, it’s been said that your misfortune might be being too early—publishing results years ahead of the powerful and affordable computers we now have. Do you consider your experiences unfortunate?</span></strong></p><p><strong><span>Schmidhuber:&nbsp;</span></strong><span>Not at all---had I done it later, someone else might have scooped me! Being ahead of time is great, especially in AI where compute is getting 10 times cheaper every 5 years, so a mere human lifetime is sufficient to see how it all pans out.&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong><span>Jazzyear:&nbsp;What kind of AGI world do you think children born after 2020 will face?</span></strong></p><p><strong><span>Schmidhuber: </span></strong><span>It will&nbsp;be awesome! Our AI&nbsp;is already helping to make human lives longer and healthier and easier, and this trend will accelerate. What's next? It’s true AGI in the physical world, not just today’s AI behind the screen. The physical challenges of the real world are far more complex than those of the virtual one. AI still has a long way to go before it can replace skilled trades like plumbers or electricians. However, there is reason to believe AI in the physical world will soon make significant strides.</span></p><p><span>A next major step will be self-replicating and self-improving societies of physical robots and other machines. We already have 3D printers that can print copies of parts of themselves. But no 3D printer can make a complete copy of itself, like a living being. To assemble a complete 3D printer, you need many other machines, for example, to take the raw material out of the ground, to refine it, to make the machines that make the machines that help make many unprintable parts of the 3D printer, to screw those parts together, and so on. Most importantly, you still need lots of people to oversee and manage all this, and to fix broken machines.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Eventually, however, there will be entire societies of clever and not-so-clever physical machines that can collectively build from scratch all the things needed to make copies of themselves, mine the raw materials they need, repair broken robots and robot factories, and so on. Basically, a machine civilisation that can make copies of itself and then, of course, improve itself. Basically, I am talking about a new form of life, about self-replicating, self-maintaining, self-improving hardware, as opposed to the already existing, self-improving, machine-learning software.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>There will be enormous commercial pressure to create such life-like hardware, because it represents the ultimate form of scaling, and its owners will become very rich, because economic growth is all about scaling.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Of course, such life-like hardware won't be confined to our little biosphere. No, variants of it will soon exist on other planets, or between planets, e.g. in the asteroid belt. As I have said many times in recent decades, space is hostile to humans but friendly to suitably designed robots, and it offers many more resources than our thin layer of biosphere, which receives less than a billionth of the energy of the Sun. Through life-like, self-replicating, self-maintaining hardware, the economy of our solar system will become billions of times larger than the current tiny economy of our biosphere. And of course, the coming expansion of the AI sphere won’t be limited to our tiny solar system.</span></p><p><strong><span>Jazzyear: What are the most pressing issues in AI safety and ethics today? Can AI pose threats comparable to nuclear weapons?</span></strong></p><p><strong><span>Schmidhuber: </span></strong><span>AI can indeed be weaponized, as recent conflicts involving cheap AI-driven drones have confirmed. But currently, AI does not pose new existential threats. As I have said for decades: we should be much more afraid of 60-years old technology in form of hydrogen bombs mounted on rockets, which can wipe out a big city within seconds, without any AI.</span></p><p><strong><span>Jazzyear: Some believe we have no room for trial and error with AGI. What can we do now to ensure safety?</span></strong></p><p><strong><span>Schmidhuber: </span></strong><span>This is like saying: let’s not have any more children because we cannot afford trial and error; we cannot simply create yet another human baby that might become a serial killer or develop extremely dangerous AI… By educating babies and AIs in a friendly, rational, and responsible manner, we greatly increase their chances of benefiting society rather than harming it.</span></p><p><strong><span>Jazzyear: In 2024, what new judgments do you have about AGI?</span></strong></p><p><strong><span>Schmidhuber:</span></strong><span> Since the 1970s, I’ve been saying that AI will soon become much smarter than humans, and that almost all AIs will soon be far from Earth where most of the physical resources are that they need to create even more and larger AIs. Self-driven AIs will first take over the solar system, and then the galaxy, and then within a few tens of billions of years the entire visible universe, in a way where humans cannot follow.&nbsp;I’ve been saying this for decades, since my teenager times. The only difference is that more people are listening now. In the 1970s, my mom used to say I am crazy when I explained that to her. In the 1980s, my fellow students said I am crazy. But recently, many have stopped calling me crazy because suddenly they think AGI is very close.</span></p><p><strong><span>Jazzyear: Can you offer any advice to Chinese startups or young Chinese scientists?</span></strong></p><p><strong><span>Schmidhuber:</span></strong><span> Sure! Study our old and recent papers and my AI Blog.</span></p><p><span>*Miss Jia, founder and CEO of Jazzyear, also contributed to the story.</span></p></div></div>]]></description>

																										<br><h3>Four senior executives at Palantir, Meta, and OpenAI have been formally appointed lieutenant colonels in the US Army following the creation of a “special” unit created for rich Big Tech mavens seeking military leadership roles.</h3>
<p>On June 13, the Army <a href="https://www.army.mil/article-amp/286317/army_launches_detachment_201_executive_innovation_corps_to_drive_tech_transformation">announced</a> the creation of Detachment 201, otherwise known as the “Executive Innovation Corps,” which it describes as “a new initiative designed to fuse cutting-edge tech expertise with military innovation.”</p>
<p>Four ultra-wealthy executives from top tech companies were sworn in to the unit ahead of President Trump’s heavily promoted military parade, which was itself sponsored by Palantir. The Army’s top spokesman <a href="https://breakingdefense.com/2025/06/anduril-meta-openai-execs-to-commission-into-army-reserve-form-detachment-201/">declared</a> that Detachment 201 was “being created to bring in tech innovation executives leaders to help the Army” with the recruitment and the subsequent training of “tech focused people.”</p>
<p>“By bringing private-sector know-how into uniform, Det. 201 is supercharging efforts like the Army Transformation Initiative, which aims to make the force leaner, smarter, and more lethal,” the Army wrote in an official statement.</p>

<p>Palantir is by far the S&amp;P 500’s top performing stock of the year, thanks in large part to the gargantuan contracts it has raked in from the Trump administration. According to the company’s founder, Alex Karp, Palantir “is here to disrupt… and when it’s necessary, to scare enemies, and on occasion, kill them.”</p>
<p>Shares of the dystopian data firm, which is named after the all-seeing orb used by the evil wizard Saruman to surveil Middle Earth in the Lord of the Rings, skyrocketed to an all-time high following Israel’s unprovoked assault on Iran.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, Karp has eagerly embraced the model of disaster capitalism, <a href="https://diginomica.com/bad-times-are-good-palantir-says-ceo-alex-karpwhich-fortunate-given-its-increased-losses-and">remarking</a>, “bad times are very good for Palantir because we build products… that are built for danger.”</p>

<p>In recent years, Palantir has come to dominate the Western information sphere, and now enjoys unfettered access to the sensitive data of citizens in countries from the US to the UK. With customers including the Department of Defense, CIA, NSA, FBI, ICE, and the Special Operations Command, Palantir has become a one-stop shop for weaponized AI-based data analysis. Amid the ruins of the national security state’s obsessive search for enemies overseas, Palantir built a reputation for being both user-friendly and slavishly obedient to the military establishment.</p>
<p>“If you do not feel comfortable supporting the legitimate efforts of America and its allies in the context of war, don’t join Palantir,” Karp <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ95Gmvg_D4">declared</a>.</p>
<p>In an <a href="https://www.thefp.com/p/im-the-cto-of-palantir-today-i-join">article</a> published on the day that military officials revealed the creation of Detachment 201, Mumbai-born Palantir CTO Shyam Sankar revealed he was among the four members of the “nation’s business elite” selected for a “special corps” meant to “deploy their technical talents in service of the [US] government.”</p>
<p>“Later today, on the eve of the U.S. Army’s <a href="https://www.army.mil/1775/">250th birthday</a>, I will raise my right hand, take an oath to support and defend the Constitution, and commission as a lieutenant colonel in the Army Reserve’s newly formed Detachment 201: Executive Innovation Corps,” he boasted.</p>
<p>Sankar was joined by what he described as “some of the most impressive minds from the world of technology: Kevin Weil, the chief product officer of OpenAI; Andrew “Boz” Bosworth, the chief technology officer of Meta; and Bob McGrew, formerly the chief research officer of OpenAI and engineering director of Palantir Technologies, where I work as chief technology officer.”</p>
<p>The creation of the techie Poindexter Patrol was necessary, Sankar suggested, due to a geopolitical “sea change” in which “Wars in Europe and the Middle East and, above all, the threat of a war in the Pacific” have “focused the national mind and initiated a scramble for mobilization.”</p>
<p>Despite his obvious glee at being fast tracked to military leadership, Sankar acknowledged it was an unusual arrangement.</p>
<p>“A decade ago, it would’ve been unthinkable for so many tech heavyweights to openly align with the U.S. military. Equally, it would’ve been out of character for the military to enlist the support of the nation’s business elite— much less to create a special corps so they could deploy their technical talents in service of the government.”</p>
<p>The Palantir executive pointed to “exploding pagers and long-distance drone strikes from shipping containers” as attacks which “prove that technology has once again changed the battlefield,” and that “our military has to change with it.”</p>
<p>With their newly-minted lieutenant colonels a world away, Palantir’s corporate officer corps will not be rallying the troops for the next war. But safely ensconced behind their digital curtain, they’ll be watching — and talking the next generation of nerds into signing up, too.</p>

          <p>Over the past few months, YouTube has been trying another round of anti-adblock measures. Currently the anti-adblock stuff is being A/B tested, and one of my accounts is in the experimental group. I wrote a filter that partially avoids one of the anti-adblock measures, fake buffering, on uBlock Origin (and Brave browser, since it uses the same filter rules). (It’s already in the default filter lists, you don’t need to manually add the filter.)</p>
<p>One thing that people have ran into is “fake buffering”, where videos will take a while to load due to a lot of buffering, but only at the very start of the video (there’s no mid-video fake buffering). As I’ll explain, the fake buffering is 80% of the length of the ads you would’ve seen, so even with fake buffering you’re still saving time using an adblocker.</p>
<h2 id="context">Context</h2>
<p>InnerTube is YouTube’s first party internal API that the web client and mobile apps use to interact with videos and get details about them. There are some legacy API endpoints that don’t go through InnerTube, but none of those are relevant today. InnerTube endpoints look like <code>https://www.youtube.com/youtubei/</code>. One of those endpoints is <code>/youtubei/v1/player</code>, which the web client calls when you click on a video to get data about the URL and GVS stream URLs.</p>
<p>GVS (Google Video Services) is a service that serves video streams for YouTube, Google Drive, and Google Photos. To stream a video from GVS, you need to get a GVS <code>/videoplayback</code> URL from InnerTube (or the Drive/Photos internal API). GVS URLs are signed and have an expiry time (usually 6 hours), so you can’t construct them on your own, you need to get one from InnerTube. One weird thing about GVS is that it isn’t only hosted from Google’s data center: ISPs can put <a href="https://support.google.com/interconnect/answer/9058809">Google Global Cache</a> servers in their infrastructure so that they can serve YouTube videos without needing to send traffic outside the ISP’s network (only public/unlisted YouTube videos are served by GGC; private YT videos and Drive/Photos videos are always served from Google data centers). GVS URLs look like <code>https://rr1---sn-gvbxgn-tt1e6.googlevideo.com/videoplayback?expire=1750321185&amp;...</code> (but with a lot more query parameters).</p>
<p>Originally the web client streamed video by just using some query parameters to the GVS URL to specify what range of video it wanted, and GVS responded with the video contents for that range. But for complicated reasons, YouTube decided to improve on this with SABR (Server ABR (Adaptive Bit Rate)), which is YouTube’s proprietary binary protocol for streaming video data, which is better at avoiding buffering than today’s open formats (e.g. MPEG-DASH). One thing that SABR supports is the server sending a backoff to the client, instructing the client to wait some amount of time before trying again instead of sending video/audio data.</p>
<h2 id="the-source-of-fake-buffering">The source of fake buffering</h2>
<p>What’s happening is that InnerTube is providing GVS streams that will give a backoff of 80% of the ad duration for ads for the first <code>/videoplayback</code> request (for the content video, not the ads), so for example if the ad is 15 seconds you’ll get 12 seconds of backoff when blocking ads. If you have an unskippable 6 second ad AND a 15 second unskippable ad together the backoff will be 16.8 seconds. To be clear this isn’t server-side ad insertion; the ad and content streams are still separate (YouTube <em>is</em> doing a server-side ad insertion experiment, but that’s separate from fake buffering). The “Experiencing interruptions” dialogs are likely triggered by long backoffs from GVS.</p>
<p>This backoff <em>always</em> happen if you’re in the A/B test, regardless of if YouTube thinks you’re using an adblocker. You just don’t notice it if you’re not blocking ads, because the web client starts loading the content video while the ad plays, so the only difference for non-ad-blocking users is that the content video doesn’t start buffering until the ad is 80% over.</p>
<p>I’ve seen claims online that YouTube is “DAMAGING Computers By SPIKING CPU Usage If You Use Ad Block”. This is completely false; YouTube doesn’t use CPU usage waiting for the backoff to expire (and even if they used a spinloop to implement the wait, maxing a single core for &lt;30 seconds won’t damage any CPU).</p>
<h2 id="become-unadvertisable">Become unadvertisable</h2>
<p>How can you avoid getting backoffed until the unskippable ad is over? Don’t get served an ad in the first place. If you set the <code>playbackContext.<wbr>contentPlaybackContext.<wbr>isInlinePlaybackNoAd</code> property in player requests to true, InnerTube won’t serve you any ads and thus won’t include any backoff in the GVS streams.</p>
<p>We can write a filter rule that makes it so whenever the web client stringifies JSON bound for a server request, we add <code>"isInlinePlaybackNoAd":true</code> to the stringified JSON.</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="adb"><span><span>www.youtube.com<span>##</span><span>+</span>js(trusted<span>-</span>replace<span>-</span>outbound<span>-</span>text, JSON.stringify, '<span>contentPlaybackContext</span><span>":{', 'contentPlaybackContext"</span>:<span>{</span><span>"isInlinePlaybackNoAd"</span>:<span>true</span>,', condition, '<span>contentPlaybackContext</span>')
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>How did I know to set that property? It’s referenced in the frontend JavaScript, so I could have spent a bunch of time reading all that. But there’s an easier way - while the web client interacts with InnerTube using JSON, that JSON API is actually generated from a Protocol Buffers definition, and there’s a way you can extract most of the underlying protobuf definition. I used <a href="https://github.com/ddd/req2proto">req2proto</a>, which is a tool to extract protobuf definitions from Google’s internal APIs to get the full definitions used in the <code>/youtubei/v1/player</code> call, and used that to find the <code>isInlinePlaybackNoAd</code> property.</p>
<p>This method only works for warm navigation, where you’ve already loaded the YouTube single page app and are clicking around within it. When you navigate directly to a watch page, the YouTube backend embeds a player response directly into the page as <code>ytInitialPlayerResponse</code>. Since the player request is made on the backend, we can’t set <code>isInlinePlaybackNoAd</code> on it.  One way to fix this for cold loads is to just remove that initial data to force YouTube to make a player request we can control (but see below before using these):</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="adb"><span><span>www.youtube.com<span>##</span><span>+</span>js(set, ytInitialData, undefined) <span>!</span> bad idea, see below
</span></span><span><span>www.youtube.com<span>##</span><span>+</span>js(set, ytInitialPlayerResponse, undefined) <span>!</span> bad idea<span>!</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This approach has some problems though, so you might not want to use it:</p>
<ul>
<li>It completely breaks livestreams, and probably some other things I haven’t tested</li>
<li>It causes the video player to briefly flash</li>
<li>It slows the page loading time</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="bypassing-the-locker-script">Bypassing the locker script</h2>
<p>So that filter kinda worked, but sometimes uBlock Origin wasn’t hooking <code>JSON.stringify</code>. I investigated further and it turns out YouTube is running an A/B test where sometimes they add this to the frontend HTML as the very first thing in the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> tag:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="html"><span><span>&lt;<span>script</span> <span>id</span><span>=</span><span>"bc-def"</span> <span>nonce</span><span>=</span><span>"[variable]"</span>&gt;<span>'use strict'</span>;<span>function</span> <span>a</span>(<span>b</span>,<span>c</span>){<span>try</span>{Object.<span>defineProperty</span>(<span>b</span>,<span>c</span>,{<span>writable</span><span>:!</span><span>1</span>,<span>configurable</span><span>:!</span><span>1</span>})}<span>catch</span>(<span>d</span>){}}<span>a</span>(window,<span>"fetch"</span>);<span>a</span>(window,<span>"JSON"</span>);<span>a</span>(window.<span>JSON</span>,<span>"stringify"</span>);<span>a</span>(window.<span>JSON</span>,<span>"parse"</span>);<span>a</span>(window,<span>"Array"</span>);<span>a</span>(Array.<span>prototype</span>,<span>"push"</span>);<span>a</span>(Array.<span>prototype</span>,<span>"forEach"</span>);<span>try</span>{<span>const</span> <span>b</span><span>=</span>document.<span>getElementById</span>(<span>"bc-def"</span>);<span>b</span><span>&amp;&amp;</span><span>b</span>.<span>remove</span>()}<span>catch</span>(<span>b</span>){};
</span></span><span><span>&lt;/<span>script</span>&gt;
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This locks a few global objects by using <code>Object.defineProperty</code> to set them as non-writable, which prevents later code from overwriting them with a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Proxy">Proxy</a> that alters their behaviour. So uBlock Origin can only proxy JSON.stringify if it can run before this locker script does. On Firefox this is easily resolvable - you can use a <a href="https://github.com/gorhill/ublock/wiki/static-filter-syntax#html-filters">HTML filter</a> to filter out the script tag from the source HTML before the page even starts being parsed. But that relies on extension APIs that Chromium doesn’t support.</p>
<p>The “fix” for the locker script so far is to hook <code>Object.assign</code> instead of <code>JSON.stringify</code>. <code>Object.assign</code> is another function that handles the request body before it gets fetched. It would be nice if there was a way to actually defuse the locker script, instead of working around it. The version of the filter that hooks <code>Object.assign</code> instead is more complicated because uBO’s scriptlets don’t let you replace text on a key of an object, so the filter in uBO’s filter list injects this JS:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="js"><span><span>(() =&gt; {
</span></span><span><span>    <span>const</span> <span>e</span> <span>=</span> {
</span></span><span><span>        <span>apply</span><span>:</span> (<span>e</span>, <span>n</span>, <span>arguments</span>) =&gt; {
</span></span><span><span>            <span>let</span> <span>t</span> <span>=</span> <span>Reflect</span>.<span>apply</span>(<span>e</span>, <span>n</span>, <span>arguments</span>);
</span></span><span><span>            <span>return</span> <span>3</span> <span>===</span> <span>arguments</span>.<span>length</span> <span>&amp;&amp;</span> <span>t</span><span>?</span>.<span>body</span> <span>&amp;&amp;</span> <span>"string"</span> <span>==</span> <span>typeof</span> <span>t</span>.<span>body</span> <span>&amp;&amp;</span> <span>!</span><span>t</span>.<span>body</span>.<span>includes</span>(<span>`"isInlinePlaybackNoAd":true`</span>) <span>&amp;&amp;</span> (<span>t</span>.<span>body</span> <span>=</span> <span>t</span>.<span>body</span>.<span>replace</span>(<span>`"contentPlaybackContext":{`</span>, <span>`"contentPlaybackContext":{"isInlinePlaybackNoAd":true,`</span>)), <span>t</span>
</span></span><span><span>        }
</span></span><span><span>    };
</span></span><span><span>    window.Object.<span>assign</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> Proxy(window.Object.<span>assign</span>, <span>e</span>)
</span></span><span><span>})();

<p>In the spring of 1996, Brian Reynolds and Jeff Briggs took a long, hard look around them and decided that they’d rather be somewhere else.</p>
<p>At that time, the two men were working for MicroProse Software, for whom they had just completed&nbsp;<a href="https://www.filfre.net/2023/01/sequels-in-strategy-gaming-part-1-civilization-ii"><em>Civilization II</em></a>, with Reynolds in the role of primary designer and programmer and Briggs in that of co-designer, producer, and soundtrack composer. They had brought the project in for well under $1 million, all that their bosses were willing to shell out for what they considered to be a game with only limited commercial potential. And yet the early sales were very strong indeed, proof that the pent-up demand for a modestly modernized successor to <a href="https://www.filfre.net/2018/03/the-game-of-everything-part-1-making-civilization">Sid Meier’s masterstroke</a> that Reynolds and Briggs had identified had been very, very real. Which is not to say that they were being given much credit for having proved their managers wrong.</p>
<p>MicroProse’s executives were really Spectrum Holobyte’s executives, ever since the latter company had acquired the former in December of 1993, in a deal lubricated by oodles of heedless venture capital and unsustainable levels of debt. Everything about the transaction seemed off-kilter; while MicroProse had <a href="https://www.filfre.net/tag/microprose/?order=asc">a long and rich history</a> and product portfolio, Spectrum Holobyte was known for <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/group/230/falcon-series/sort:date/">the <em>Falcon</em> series</a> of ultra-realistic combat flight simulators, for the first version of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.filfre.net/2017/06/a-tale-of-the-mirror-world-part-3-a-game-of-falling-shapes"><em>Tetris</em></a> to run on Western personal computers, and for not a whole lot else. Seeing the writing on the wall, “Wild Bill” Stealey, the partner in crime <a href="https://www.filfre.net/2015/03/microproses-simulation-industrial-complex-or-the-ballad-of-sid-and-wild-bill">with whom Sid Meier had founded MicroProse</a> back in 1982, walked out the door soon after the shark swallowed the whale. The conjoined company went on to lose a staggering $57.8 million in two years, despite such well-received, well-remembered, and reasonably if not extraordinarily popular games as <a href="https://www.filfre.net/2020/09/x-com"><em>XCOM</em></a>, <a href="https://www.filfre.net/2020/10/transport-tycoon"><em>Transport Tycoon</em></a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.filfre.net/2020/12/ethics-in-strategy-gaming-part-2-colonization"><em>Colonization</em></a>. By the spring of 1996, the two-headed beast, which was still publishing games under both the Spectrum Holobyte and MicroProse banners, was teetering on the brink of insolvency, with, in the words of its CEO Stephen M. Race, a “negative tangible net worth.” It would require a last-minute injection of foreign investment capital that June to save it from being de-listed from the NASDAQ stock exchange.</p>
<p>The unexpectedly strong sales of <em>Civilization II</em> — the game would eventually sell 3 million copies, enough to make it MicroProse’s best seller ever by a factor of three — were a rare smudge of black in this sea of red ink. Yet Reynolds and Briggs had no confidence in their managers’ ability to build on their success. They thought it was high time to get off the sinking ship, time to get away from a company that was no longer much fun to work at. They wanted to start their own little studio, to make the games they wanted to make their way.</p>
<p>But that, of course, was easier said than done. They had a proven track record inside the industry, but neither Brian Reynolds nor Jeff Briggs was a household name, even among hardcore gamers. Most of the latter still believed that <em>Civilization II</em> was the work of Sid Meier — an easy mistake to make, given how prominently Meier’s name was emblazoned on the box. Reynolds and Briggs needed investors, plus a publisher who would be willing to take a chance on them. Thankfully, the solution to their dilemma was quite literally staring them in the face every time they looked at that <em>Civilization II</em> box: they asked Sid Meier to abandon ship with them. After agonizing for a while about the prospect of leaving the company he had co-founded in the formative days of the American games industry, Meier agreed, largely for the same reason that Reynolds and Briggs had made their proposal to him in the first place: it just wasn’t any fun to be here anymore.</p>
<p>So, a delicate process of disentanglement began. Keenly aware of the legal peril in which their plans placed them, the three partners did everything in their power to make their departure as amicable and non-dramatic as possible. For instance, they staggered their resignations so as not to present an overly united front: Briggs left in May of 1996, Reynolds in June, and Meier in July. Even after officially resigning, Meier agreed to continue at MicroProse for some months more as a part-time consultant, long enough to see through <a href="https://www.filfre.net/2023/09/magic-and-loss-part-2-magic-on-the-screen">his computerized version</a> of the ultra-popular <a href="https://www.filfre.net/2023/09/magic-and-loss-part-1-magic-in-the-cards"><em>Magic: The Gathering</em></a> collectible-card game. He didn’t even complain when, in an ironic reversal of the usual practice of putting Sid Meier’s name on things that he didn’t actually design, his old bosses made it clear that they intended to scrub him from the credits of this game, which he had spent the better part of two years of his life working on. In return for all of this and for a firm promise to stay in his own lane once he was gone, he was allowed to take with him all of the code he had written during the past decade and a half at MicroProse. “They didn’t want to be making detailed strategy titles any more than we wanted to be making <em>Top Gun</em> flight simulators,” writes Meier in his memoir. On the face of it, this was a strange attitude for his former employer to have, given that <em>Civilization II</em> was selling so much better than any of its other games. But Brian Reynolds, Jeff Briggs, and Sid Meier were certainly not inclined to look the gift horse in the mouth.</p>
<p>They decided to call their new company Firaxis Games, a name that had its origin in a piece of music that Briggs had been tinkering with, which he had dubbed “Fiery Axis.” Jason Coleman, a MicroProse programmer who had coded on <em>Civilization II</em>, quit his job there as well and joined them. Sid Meier’s current girlfriend and future second wife Susan Brookins became their office manager.</p>
<p>The first office she was given to manage was a cramped space at the back of Absolute Quality, a game-testing service located in Hunt Valley, Maryland, just a stone’s throw away from Microprose’s offices. Their landlords/flatmates were, if nothing else, a daily reminder of the need to test, test, test when making games. Brian Reynolds (who writes of himself here in the third person):</p>
<blockquote><p>CEO Jeff Briggs worked the phones to rustle up some funding and did all the hard work of actually putting a new company together. Sid Meier and Brian Reynolds worked to scrape together some playable prototype code, and Jason Coleman wrote the first lines of JACKAL, the engine which these days pretty much holds everything together. Office-manager Susan Brookins found us some office furniture and bought crates of Coke, Sprite, and Dr. Pepper to stash in a mini-fridge Brian had saved from his college days. We remembered that at some indeterminate point in the past we were considered world-class game designers, but our day-to-day lives weren’t providing us with a lot of positive reinforcement on that point. So, for the first nine months of our existence as a company, we clunked over railroad tracks in the morning, played Spy Hunter in the upstairs kitchen, and declared “work at home” days when Absolute Quality had competitors in the office.</p></blockquote>
<p>Once the necessary financing was secured, the little gang of five moved into a proper office of their own and hired more of their former colleagues, many of whom had been laid off in a round of brutal cost-cutting that had taken place at MicroProse the same summer as the departure of the core trio. These folks bootstrapped Firaxis’s programming and art departments. Thanks to the cachet of the Sid Meier name/brand, the studio was already being seen as a potential force to be reckoned with. Publishers flew out to them instead of the other way around to pitch their services. In the end, Firaxis elected to sign on with Electronic Arts, the biggest publisher of them all.</p>
<p>The three founding fathers had come into the venture with a tacit understanding about the division of labor. Brian Reynolds would helm a sprawlingly ambitious but fundamentally iterative 4X strategy game, a “spiritual successor” to <em>Civilization I</em> and <em>II</em>. This was the project that had gotten Electronic Arts’s juices flowing; its box would, it went without saying, feature Sid Meier’s name prominently on its box, no matter how much or how little Meier ultimately had to do with it. Meanwhile Meier himself would have free rein to pursue the quirkier, more esoteric ideas that he had been indulging in ever since finishing <em>Civilization I</em>. And Briggs would be the utility player, making sure the business side ran smoothly, writing the music, and pitching in wherever help was needed on either partner’s project.</p>
<p>Sid Meier has a well-earned reputation for working rapidly and efficiently. It’s therefore no surprise that he was the first Firaxis designer to finish a game, and by a wide margin at that. Called simply <em>Gettysburg!</em> — or rather&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/6/sid-meiers-gettysburg/"><em>Sid Meier’s Gettysburg!</em></a> — it was based upon the battle that took place in that Pennsylvania city during the American Civil War. More expansively, it was an attempt to make a wargame that would be appealing to grognards but accessible enough to attract newcomers, by virtue of being real-time rather than turn-based, of being audiovisually attractive, and of offering a whole raft of difficulty levels and tutorials to ease the player into the experience. Upon its release in October of 1997, <em>Computer Gaming World</em> magazine called it “a landmark, a real-time-strategy game whose unique treatment of its subject matter points to a [new] direction for the whole genre.” For my own part, being neither a dedicated grognard nor someone who shares the fascination of so many Americans for the Civil War, I will defer to the contemporary journal of record. I’m sure that <em>Gettysburg!</em> does what it does very well, as almost all Sid Meier games do. On the broader question of whether it brought new faces into the grognard fold, the verdict is more mixed. Meier writes today that “it was a success,” but it was definitely not a hit on the scale of <a href="https://www.filfre.net/2020/11/ethics-in-strategy-gaming-part-1-panzer-general">SSI’s <em>Panzer General</em></a>, the last wargame to break out of its ghetto in a big way.</p>
<p>To the hungry eyes of Electronic Arts, <em>Gettysburg!</em> was just the appetizer anyway. The main dish would be <em>Alpha Centauri</em>.</p>
<p>The idea for&nbsp;<em>Alpha Centauri</em> had been batted around intermittently as a possible “sequel to&nbsp;<em>Civilization</em>” ever since Sid Meier had made one of the two possible victory conditions of that game the dispatching of a spaceship to that distant star, an achievement what was taken as a proof that the nation so doing had reached the absolute pinnacle of terrestrial achievement. In the wake of the original <em>Civilization’</em>s release and success, Meier had gone so far as to prototype some approaches to what happens after humanity becomes a star-faring species, only to abandon them for other things. Now, though, the old idea was newly appealing to the principals at Firaxis, for commercial as much as creative reasons. They had left the rights to the <em>Civilization</em> franchise behind them at MicroProse, meaning that a Firaxis&nbsp;<em>Civilization III</em> was, at least for the time being, not in the cards. But if they made a game called&nbsp;<em>Alpha Centauri</em> that used many of the same rules, systems, and gameplay philosophies, and that sported the name of Sid Meier on the box… well, people would get the message pretty clearly, wouldn’t they? This would be a sequel to <em>Civilization</em> in all but its lack of a Roman numeral.</p>
<p>When he actually started to try to make it happen, however, Brian Reynolds learned pretty quickly why Sid Meier had abandoned the idea. What seemed like a no-brainer in the abstract proved beset with complications when you really engaged. The central drama of <em>Civilization</em> was the competition and conflict <em>between</em> civilizations — which is also, not coincidentally, the central drama of human history itself. But where would the drama come from for a <em>single</em> group of enlightened emissaries from an earthly Utopia settling an alien planet? Whom would they compete against? Just exploring and settling and building weren’t enough, Reynolds thought. There needed to be a source of tension. There needed to be an Other.</p>
<p>So, Brian Reynolds started to read — not history this time, as he had when working on <em>Civilization II</em>, but science fiction. The eventual manual for <em>Alpha Centauri</em> would list seven authors that Reynolds found particularly inspiring, but it seems safe to say that his lodestar was Frank Herbert, the first writer on the list. This meant not only the inevitable <a href="https://www.filfre.net/2018/11/controlling-the-spice-part-1-dune-on-page-and-screen"><em>Dune</em></a>, but also — and perhaps even more importantly — a more obscure Herbert novel called&nbsp;<em>The Jesus Incident</em> that wasn’t even still in print at the time. One of its author’s more polarizing creations,&nbsp;<em>The Jesus Incident</em> is an elliptical, intensely philosophical and even spiritual novel about the attempt of a group of humans to colonize a planet that begins to manifest a form of sentience of its own, and proves more than capable of expressing its displeasure at their presence on its surface. This same conceit would become the central plot hook of <em>Alpha Centauri</em>.</p>
<p>Yes, I just used the word “plot.” And make no mistake about its significance. Of the threads that have remained unbroken throughout Sid Meier’s long career in game design, one of the most prominent is this mild-mannered man’s deep-seated antipathy toward any sort of set-piece, pre-scripted storytelling in games. Such a thing is, he has always said, a betrayal of computer games’ defining attribute as a form of media, their interactivity. For it prevents the player from playing her way, having her own fun, writing her own personal story using the sandbox the designer has provided. Firaxis had never been intended as exclusively “Sid Meier’s company,” but it had been envisioned as a studio that would create, broadly speaking, his type of games. For Reynolds to suggest injecting strong narrative elements into the studio’s very first 4X title was akin to Deng Xiaoping <a href="https://analog-antiquarian.net/2022/12/30/chapter-25-the-passing-of-the-old-guard/">suggesting to his politburo</a> that what post-Cultural Revolution China could really use was a shot of capitalism.</p>
<p>And yet Meier and the others around Reynolds let him get away with it, just as those around Deng did. They did so because he had proven himself with <em>Colonization</em> and&nbsp;<em>Civilization II</em>, because they trusted him, and because <em>Alpha Centauri</em> was at the end of the day his project. They hadn’t gone to the trouble of founding Firaxis in order to second-guess one another.</p>
<p>Thus Reynolds found himself writing far more snippets of static text for his strategy game than he had ever expected to. He crafted a series of textual “interludes” — they’re described by that word in the game — in which the planet’s slowly dawning consciousness and its rising anger at the primates swarming over its once-pristine surface are depicted in ways that mere mechanics could not entirely capture. They appear when the player reaches certain milestones, being yet one more attempt in the annals of gaming history to negotiate the tricky terrain that lies between emergent and fixed narrative.</p>

<p><em>Walking alone through the corridors of Morgan Industries, you skim the security reports on recent attacks by the horrific native “mind worms.” Giant swarms, or “boils,” of these mottled 10cm nightmares have wriggled out of the fungal beds of late, and now threaten to overwhelm base perimeters in several sectors. Victims are paralyzed with psi-induced terror, and then experience an unimaginably excruciating death as the worms burrow into the brain to implant their ravenous larvae.</em></p>
<p><em>Only the most disciplined security squads can overcome their fear long enough to trigger the flame guns which can keep the worms at bay. Clearly you will have to tend carefully to the morale of the troops.</em></p>
<p><em>Furthermore, since terror and surprise increase human casualties dramatically in these encounters, it will be important to strike first when mind-worm boils are detected. You consider ordering some Former detachments to construct sensors near vulnerable bases to aid in such detection efforts.</em></p>
</div>
<p><em>Alpha Centauri</em> became a darker game as it became more story-oriented, separating itself in the process from the sanguine tale of limitless human progress that is <em>Civilization</em>. Reynolds subverted&nbsp;<em>Alpha Centauri’</em>s original backstory about the perfect society that had finally advanced so far as to colonize the stars. In his new version, progress on Earth has not proved all it was cracked up to be. In fact, the planet his interstellar colonists left behind them was on its last legs, wracked by wars and environmental devastation. It’s strongly implied if not directly stated that earthly humanity is in all likelihood extinct by the time the colonists wake up from cryogenic sleep and look down upon the virgin new world that the game calls simply “Planet.”</p>
<hr>


<hr>

<p>Although the plot was destined to culminate in a reckoning with the consciousness of Planet itself, Brian Reynolds sensed that the game needed other, more grounded and immediate forms of conflict to give it urgency right from the beginning. He created these with another piece of backstory, one as contrived as could possibly be, but not ineffective in its context for all that. As told at length in <a href="https://ia904600.us.archive.org/20/items/alpha_centauri_books_download/Sid%20Meier%27s%20Alpha%20Centauri_%20Short%20Stories%20-%20Michael%20Ely.pdf">a novella</a> that Firaxis began publishing in installments on the game’s website more than six months before its release, mishaps and malevolence aboard the colony ship, which bore the sadly ironic name of <em>Unity</em>, led the colonists to split into seven feuding factions, each of whom inflexibly adhere to their own ideology about the best way to organize human society. The factions each made their way down to the surface of Planet separately, to become <em>Alpha Centauri’</em>s equivalent of&nbsp;<em>Civilization’</em>s nations. The player chooses one of them to guide.</p>
<p>So, in addition to the unusually strong plot, we have a heaping dose of political philosophy added to the mix; <em>Alpha Centauri</em> is an unapologetically heady game. Brian Reynolds had attended graduate school as a philosophy major in a previous life, and he drew from that background liberally. The factions’ viewpoints are fleshed out largely through a series of epigrams that appear as you research new technologies, that are attributed to whichever of the seven leaders would likely approve most of that development, with an occasional quote from Aristotle or Nietzsche dropped in for good measure.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.filfre.net/2025/06/alpha-centauri/alpha2/" rel="attachment wp-att-6378"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/alpha2-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="450" srcset="https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/alpha2-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/alpha2-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/alpha2.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px"></a></p>

<p><em>— CEO Nwabudike Morgan,<br>
Strategy Session</em></p>
</div>
<p>The factions are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Gaia’s Stepdaughters, staunch environmentalists who believe that humanity must learn to live in harmony with nature to avoid repeating the mistakes that led to the ruination of Earth.</li>
<li>The Human Hive, hardcore collectivists whose only complaint about <a href="https://analog-antiquarian.net/2022/12/16/chapter-24-the-cultural-revolution/">Chairman Mao’s Cultural Revolution</a> is that it didn’t go far enough.</li>
<li>Morgan Industries, hardcore capitalists whose only complaint about Ayn Rand is that she didn’t go far enough.</li>
<li>The University of Planet, STEM specialists who are convinced that scientific and technological progress alone would correct all that ails society if people would just let it run unfettered and go where it takes them.</li>
<li>The Lord’s Believers, a fundamentalist sect who are convinced that God will deliver humanity to paradise if we all just pray really hard and abide by a set of stringent, arbitrary dictates.</li>
<li>The Spartan Federation, who train their children from birth to be hardened, self-sacrificing warriors like <a href="https://analog-antiquarian.net/2020/03/27/chapter-12-the-reforms-of-lycurgus/">the Spartans of old</a>.</li>
<li>The Peacekeepers, the closest thing to pragmatists in this rogue’s gallery of ideologues; they value human rights, democracy, dialog, and consensus-building, and can sometimes seem just as wishy-washy and ineffectual in the face of militant extremism as the earthly United Nations that spawned them.</li>
</ul>
<p>Unlike the nations that appear in <em>Civilization I</em> and&nbsp;<em>II</em>, each of the factions in&nbsp;<em>Alpha Centauri</em> has a very significant set of systemic advantages and disadvantages that to a large extent force even a human player to guide them in a certain direction. For example, the Human Hive is excellent at building heavy infrastructure and pumping out babies, but poor at research, and can never become a democracy; the University of Planet is crazily great at research, but its populace has little patience for extended wars and is vulnerable to espionage. Trying to play a faction against type is, if not completely impossible for the advanced player, not an exercise for the faint of heart.</p>
<p>There is a lot of food for thought in the backstory of a ruined Earth and the foreground story of an angry Planet, as there is in the factions themselves and their ideologies, and trust me when I say that plenty of people have eaten their fill. Even today, more than a quarter-century after <em>Alpha Centauri’</em>s release, YouTube is full of introspective think-pieces purporting to tell us What It All Means.</p>
<p>Indeed, if anything, the game’s themes and atmosphere resonate more strongly today than they did when it first came out in February of 1999, at which time the American economy was booming, our world was as peaceful and open as it has ever been, and the fantasy that liberal democracy had won the day and we had reached the end of history could be easily maintained by the optimistic and the complacent. Alas, today <em>Alpha Centuari</em> feels far more believable than<em> Civilization</em> and its <em>sang-froid</em> about the inevitability of <a href="https://www.filfre.net/2018/03/the-game-of-everything-part-3-civilization-and-the-narrative-of-progress">perpetual progress</a>. These days,&nbsp;<em>Alpha Centauri’</em>s depiction of bickering, bitterly entrenched factions warring over the very nature of truth, progressing not at all spiritually or morally even as their technology runs wild in a hundred different perilous directions, strikes many as the more accurate picture of the nature of our species. People play <em>Alpha Centauri</em> to engage with modern life; they play&nbsp;<em>Civilization</em> to escape from it.</p>
<div id="attachment_6384"><p><a href="https://www.filfre.net/2025/06/alpha-centauri/alpha9/" rel="attachment wp-att-6384"><img decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-6384" src="https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/alpha9-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="450" srcset="https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/alpha9-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/alpha9-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/alpha9.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px"></a></p><p id="caption-attachment-6384">The original <em>Civilization</em> was ahead of the curve on <a href="https://www.filfre.net/2018/05/the-game-of-everything-part-10-civilization-and-the-limits-of-progress">global warming</a>, prompting accusations of “political correctness” from some gamers. Paying heed to the environment is even more important in <em>Alpha Centauri</em>, since failing to do so can only aggravate Planet’s innate hostility. The “Eo-Damage” statistic is key.</p></div>
<p>That said, we must also acknowledge that <em>Alpha Centauri</em> is disarmingly good at mirroring the beliefs of its players back at them. Many people like to read a strong environmentalist message in the game, and it’s not hard to see why. Your struggles with the hostile Planet, which is doing everything it can to protect itself against the alien parasites on its surface, is an extreme interpretation of the Gaia hypothesis about Earth, even as <em>Alpha Centauri’</em>s &nbsp;“transcendence” victory — the equivalent of&nbsp;<em>Civilization’</em>s tech victory that got us here in the first place — sees humanity overcoming its estrangement from its surroundings to literally become one with Planet.</p>
<p>For what it’s worth, though, in his “Designer’s Notes” at the back of the <em>Alpha Centauri</em> manual, the one message that Brian Reynolds explicitly states that he wishes for the game to convey is a very different one: that we ought to be getting on with the space race. “Are we content to stew in our collective juices, to turn inward as our planet runs inexorably out of resources?” he asks. “The stars are waiting for us. We have only to decide that it’s worth the effort to go there.” Personally, although I have nothing against space exploration in the abstract, I must say that I find the idea of space colonization as the solution to the problem of a beleaguered Planet Earth shallow if not actively dangerous. Even in the best-case scenario, many, many generations will pass before a significant number of humans will be able to call another celestial object their permanent home. In the meantime, there is in fact nothing “inexorable” about polluting our own planet and bleeding it dry; we have the means to stop doing so. To steal a phrase from Reynolds, we have only to decide that it’s worth the effort.</p>
<p>But enough with the ideology and the politics, you might be saying — how does <em>Alpha Centauri</em> play as a game? Interestingly, Brian Reynolds himself is somewhat ambivalent on this subject. He recalls that he set aside a week just to play <em>Civilization II</em> after he pronounced that game done, so thrilled was he at the way it had come out. Yet he says that he could barely stand to look at <em>Alpha Centauri</em> after it was finished. He was very proud of the world-building, the atmosphere, the fiction. But he didn’t feel like he had quite gotten the gameplay mechanics sorted so that they fully supported the fiction. And I can kind of see what he means.</p>
<p>To state the obvious: the gameplay of <em>Alpha Centauri</em> is deeply indebted to&nbsp;<em>Civilization</em>. Like, really, really indebted. So indebted that, when you first start to play it, you might be tempted to see it as little more than a cosmetic reskin. The cities of <em>Civilization</em> are now “bases”; the “goody-hut” villages are now supply pods dropped by the&nbsp;<em>Unity</em> in its last hours of life; barbarian tribes are native “mind worms”; settler engineers are terraformers; money is “energy credits”; Wonders of the World are Secret Projects; etc., etc. It is true that, as you continue to play, some aspects will begin to separate themselves from their inspiration. For example, and perhaps most notably, the mind worms prove to be more than just the early-game annoyance that <em>Civilization’</em>s barbarians are; instead they steadily grow in power and quantity as Planet is angered more and more by your presence. Still, the apple never does roll all that far from the tree.</p>
<div id="attachment_6379"><p><a href="https://www.filfre.net/2025/06/alpha-centauri/alpha3/" rel="attachment wp-att-6379"><img decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-6379" src="https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/alpha3-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="450" srcset="https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/alpha3-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/alpha3-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/alpha3.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px"></a></p><p id="caption-attachment-6379">Very early in a game of <em>Alpha Centauri</em>, when only a tiny part of the map has been revealed. Of all the contrivances in the fiction, this idea that you could have looked down on Planet from outer space and still have no clue about the geography of the place might be the most absurd.</p></div>
<p>Where&nbsp;<em>Alpha Centauri</em> does innovate in terms of its mechanics, its innovations are iterative rather than transformative. An isometric view replaces <em>Civilization’</em>s top-down view; this allows you to see the topography of the landscape, which is now important, as the solar farms you use to generate energy function best at higher elevations. The most welcome improvement might be the implementation of territorial borders for each faction, drawn automatically around each cluster of bases. To penetrate the borders of another faction with your own units is considered a hostile act. This eliminates the weirdness that dogged the first two iterations of <em>Civilization</em>, which essentially saw your empire as a linked network of city-states rather than a contiguous territorial holding. No longer do the computer players walk in and plop down a city… err, base right in the middle of five of your own; no longer do the infantry units of your alleged allies decide to entrench themselves on the choicest tile of your best base. Unsurprisingly given the increased verisimilitude they yielded, national borders would show up in every iteration of the main <em>Civilization </em>series after <em>Alpha Centauri</em>.</p>
<p>Other additions are of more dubious value. Brian Reynolds names as one of his biggest regrets his dogged determination to let you design your own units out of the raw materials — chassis, propulsion systems, weapons, armor, and so on — provided by your current state of progression up the tech tree, in the same way that galaxy-spanning 4X games like <a href="https://www.filfre.net/2020/10/master-of-magic"><em>Master of Orion</em></a> allowed. It proved a time-consuming nightmare to implement in this uni-planetary context. And, as Reynolds admits, it’s doubtful how much it really adds to the game. All that time and effort could likely have been better spent elsewhere.</p>
<p>When I look at it in a more holistic sense, it strikes me that&nbsp;<em>Alpha Centauri</em> got itself caught up in what had perchance become a self-defeating cycle for grand-strategy games by the end of the 1990s. Earlier games had had their scope and complexity strictly limited by the restrictions of the relatively primitive hardware on which they ran. Far from being a problem, these limits often served to keep the game manageable for the player. One thinks of 1990’s <a href="https://www.filfre.net/2017/03/railroad-tycoon"><em>Railroad Tycoon</em></a>, another Sid Meier classic, which only had memory enough for 35 trains and 35 stations; as a result, the growth of your railroad empire was stopped just before it started to become too unwieldy to micro-manage. Even the original&nbsp;<em>Civilization</em> was arguably more a beneficiary than a victim of similar constraints. By the time Brian Reynolds made <em>Civilization II</em>, however, strategy games could become a whole lot bigger and more complex, even as less progress had been made on finding ways to hide some of their complexity from the player who didn’t want to see it and to give her ways of automating the more routine tasks of empire management. Grand-strategy games became ever huger, more intricate machines, whose every valve and dial still had to be manipulated by hand. Some players love this sort of thing, and more power to them. But for a lot of them — a group that includes me — it becomes much, much too much.</p>
<p>To its credit,&nbsp;<em>Alpha Centauri</em> is aware of this problem, and does what it can to address it. If you start a new game at one of the two lowest of the six difficulty levels, it assumes you are probably new to the game as a whole, and takes you through a little tutorial when you access each screen for the first time. More thoroughgoingly, it gives you a suite of automation tools that at least nod in the direction of letting you set the high-level direction for your faction while your underlings sweat the details. You can decide whether each of your cities… err, bases should focus on “exploring,” “building,” “discovering,” or “conquering” and leave the rest to its “governor”; you can tell your terraforming units to just, well, terraform in whatever way they think best; you can even tell a unit just to go out and “explore” the blank spaces on your map.</p>
<div id="attachment_6382"><p><a href="https://www.filfre.net/2025/06/alpha-centauri/alpha7/" rel="attachment wp-att-6382"><img decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-6382" src="https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/alpha7-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="450" srcset="https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/alpha7-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/alpha7-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/alpha7.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px"></a></p><p id="caption-attachment-6382">Is the cure worse than the disease?</p></div>
<p>Sadly, though, these tools are more limited than they might first appear. The tutorials do a decent job of telling you what the different stuff on each screen is and does, but do almost nothing to explain the concepts that underlie them; that is to say, they tell you how to twiddle a variety of knobs, but don’t tell you <em>why</em> you might want to twiddle them. Meanwhile the automation functions are undermined by being abjectly stupid more often than not. Your governor will happily continue researching string theory while his rioting citizens are burning the place down around his ears. You can try to fine-tune his instructions, but there comes a point when you realize that it’s easier just to do everything yourself. The same applies to most of the automated unit functions. The supreme booby prize has to go to the aforementioned “explore” function. As far as I can determine, it just causes your unit to move in a random direction every turn, which tends to result in it chasing its tail like a dog that sat down in peanut butter rather than charging boldly into the unknown.</p>
<p>This, then, is the contradiction at the heart of&nbsp;<em>Alpha Centauri</em>, which is the same one that bothers me in <em>Civilization II</em>. A game that purports to be about Big Ideas demands that you spend most of your time engaged in the most fiddly sort of busywork. I hasten to state once again that this is not automatically a bad thing; again, some people enjoy that sort of micro-management very much. For my own part, I can get into it a bit at the outset, but once I have a dozen bases all demanding constant attention and 50 or 60 units pursuing their various objectives all over the map, I start to lose heart. For me, this problem is the bane of the 4X genre. I’m not enough of an expert on the field to know whether anyone has really come close to solving it; I look forward to finding out as we continue our journey through gaming history. As of this writing, though, my 4X gold standards remain <em>Civilization I</em> and&nbsp;<em>Master of Orion I</em>, because their core systems are simple enough that the late game never becomes completely overwhelming.</p>
<p>Speaking of&nbsp;<em>Master of Orion</em>: alongside the questionable idea of custom-built units, <em>Alpha Centauri</em> also lifts from that game the indubitably welcome one of a “diplomatic victory,” which eliminates the late-game tedium of having to hunt down every single enemy base and unit for a conquest victory that you know is going to be yours. If you can persuade or intimidate enough of the other factions to vote for you in the “Planetary Council” — or if you can amass such a large population of your own that you can swamp the vote — you can make an inevitability a reality by means of an election. Likewise, you can also win an “economic” victory by becoming crazy rich. These are smart additions that work as advertised. They may only nibble at the edges of the central problem I mentioned above, but, hey, credit where it’s due.</p>

<p>Aesthetically,&nbsp;<em>Alpha Centauri</em> is a marked improvement over&nbsp;<em>Civilization II</em>, which, trapped in the Windows 3.1 visual paradigm as it was, could feel a bit like “playing” a really advanced Excel spreadsheet. But <em>Alpha Centauri</em> also exhibits a cold — not to say sterile — personality, with none of the goofy humor that has always been one of <em>Civilization’</em>s most underrated qualities, serving to nip any pretentiousness in the bud by reminding us that the designers too know how silly a game that can pit Abraham Lincoln against Mahatma Gandhi in a nuclear-armed standoff ultimately is. There’s nothing like that understanding on display in <em>Alpha Centauri</em> — much less the campy troupe of live-action community-theater advisors who showed up to chew the scenery in <em>Civilization II</em>. The look and feel of <em>Alpha Centauri</em> is more <a href="https://www.filfre.net/2016/11/the-prophet-of-cyberspace">William Gibson</a> than Mel Brooks.</p>
<p>While the aesthetics of <em>Alpha Centauri</em> represent a departure from what came before, we’re back to the same old same old when it comes to the actual interface, just with more <em>stuff</em> packed into the menus and sub-menus. I’m sure that Brian Reynolds did what he could, but it will nevertheless come off as a convoluted mess to the uninitiated modern player. It’s heavily dependent on modes, a big no-no in GUI design since the days when <a href="https://www.filfre.net/2014/02/macintosh">the Apple Macintosh was a brand new product</a>. If you’re anything like me, you’ll accidentally move a unit about ten times in any given evening of play because you thought you were in “view” mode when you were actually in “move” mode. And no, there is no undo function, a feature for which I’d happily trade the ability to design my own units.</p>
<div id="attachment_6380"><p><a href="https://www.filfre.net/2025/06/alpha-centauri/alpha4/" rel="attachment wp-att-6380"><img decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-6380" src="https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/alpha4-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="450" srcset="https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/alpha4-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/alpha4-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/alpha4.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px"></a></p><p id="caption-attachment-6380">The exit dialog is one of the few exceptions to <em>Alpha Centauri</em> as a humor-free zone. “Please don’t go,” says a passable imitation of HAL from <em>2001: A Space Odyssey</em>. “The drones need you.” Note that this is a game in which you click “OK” to cancel. Somewhere out there a human-factors interface consultant is shuddering in horror.</p></div>
<p>As so often happens in reviews like these, I find now that I’ve highlighted the negative here more than I really intended to. <em>Alpha Centauri</em> is by no means a bad game; on the contrary, for some players it is a genuinely great one. It is, however, a sharply bifurcated game, whose fiction and gameplay are rather at odds with one another. The former is thoughtful and bold, even disturbing in a way that <em>Civilization</em> never dared to be. The latter is pretty much what you would expect from a game that was promoted as “<em>Civilization</em> in space,” and, indeed, that was crafted by the same man who gave us <em>Civilization II</em>. A quick survey of YouTube reveals the two halves of the whole all too plainly. Alongside those earnest think-pieces about What It All Means, there are plenty of videos that offer tips on the minutiae of its systems and show off the host’s skill at beating it at superhuman difficulty levels, untroubled by any of its deeper themes or messages.</p>
<p>As you’ve probably gathered from the tone of this article, <em>Alpha Centauri</em> leaves me with mixed feelings. I’m already getting annoyed by the micro-management by the time I get into the mid-game, even as I miss a certain magic sauce that is part and parcel of <em>Civilization</em>. There’s something almost mythical or allegorical about going from inventing the wheel to sending a colony ship on its way out to the stars. Going from Biogentics to the “Threshold of Transcendence” in <em>Alpha Centauri</em> is less relatable. And while the story and the additional philosophical textures that <em>Alpha Centauri</em> brings to the table are thought-provoking, they can only really be appreciated once. After that, you’re just clicking past the interludes and epigrams to get on to building the next thing you need for your extraterrestrial empire.</p>
<p>In fact, it seems to me that <em>Alpha Centauri</em> at the gameplay level favors the competitive player more than <a href="https://www.filfre.net/2011/07/the-rise-of-experiential-games">the experiential one</a>; being firmly in the experiential camp myself, this may explain why it doesn’t completely agree with me. It’s a more fiercely zero-sum affair than <em>Civilization</em>. Those players most interested in the development side of things can’t ensure a long period of peaceful growth by choosing to play against only one or two rivals. All seven factions are always in this game, and they seem to me far more prone to conflict than those of <em>Civilization</em>, what with the collection of mutually antithetical ideologies that are such inseparable parts of their identities. Suffice to say that the other faction leaders are exactly the self-righteous jerks that rigid ideological extremists tend to be in real life. This does not lend itself to peace and harmony on Planet even before the mind worms start to rise up en masse. Even when playing as the Peacekeepers, I found myself spending a lot more time fighting wars in <em>Alpha Centauri</em> than I ever did in&nbsp;<em>Civilization</em>, where I was generally able to set up a peaceful, trustworthy democracy, forge strong diplomatic and trading links with my neighbors, and ride my strong economy and happy and prosperous citizenry to the stars. Playing <em>Alpha Centuari</em>, by contrast, is more like being one of seven piranhas in a fishbowl than a valued member of a community of nations. If you can find one reliable ally, you’re doing pretty darn well on the diplomatic front. Intervals of peace tend to be the disruption in the status quo of war rather than the other way around.</p>
<div id="attachment_6381"><p><a href="https://www.filfre.net/2025/06/alpha-centauri/alpha5/" rel="attachment wp-att-6381"><img decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-6381" src="https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/alpha5-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="450" srcset="https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/alpha5-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/alpha5-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/alpha5.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px"></a></p><p id="caption-attachment-6381">The other factions spend an inordinate amount of time trying to extort money out of you.</p></div>
<p>There was always an understanding at Firaxis that, for all that&nbsp;<em>Alpha Centauri</em> was the best card they had to play at that point in time from a commercial standpoint, its sales probably weren’t destined to rival those of <em>Civilization II</em>. For the <em>Civilization</em> franchise has always attracted a fair number of people from outside the core gaming demographics, even if it is doubtful how many of them really buckle down to play it.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, <em>Alpha Centauri</em> did about as well as one could possibly expect after its release in February of 1999. (Electronic Arts would surely have preferred to have the game a few months earlier, to hit the Christmas buying season, but one of the reasons Firaxis had been founded had been to avoid such compromises.) Sales of up to 1 million units have been claimed for it by some of the principals involved. Even if that figure is a little inflated, as I suspect it may be, the game likely sold well into the high hundreds of thousands.</p>
<p>By 1999, an expansion pack for a successful game like&nbsp;<em>Alpha Centauri</em> was almost obligatory. And indeed, it’s hard to get around the feeling that&nbsp;<em>Alpha Centauri: Alien Crossfire</em>, which shipped in October of that year, was created more out of obligation than passion. Neither the navel-gazers nor the zero-summers among the original game’s fan base seem all that hugely fond of it. Patched together by a committee of no fewer than eight designers, with the name of Brian Reynolds the very last one listed, it adds no fewer than seven new factions, which only serve to muddy the narrative and gameplay waters without adding much of positive interest to the equation; the two alien factions that appear out of nowhere seem particularly out of place. If you ask me, <em>Alpha Centauri</em> is best played in its original form — certainly when you first start out with it, and possibly forever.</p>
<p>Be that as it may, the end of the second millennium saw Firaxis now firmly established as a studio and a brand, both of which would prove very enduring. The company remains with us to this day, still one of the leading lights in the field of 4X strategy, the custodian of the beloved <em>Civilization</em>…</p>
<p>Yes,&nbsp;<em>Civilization</em>. For their next big trick, Firaxis was about to get the chance to make a game under the name that they thought they’d left behind forever when they said farewell to MicroProse.</p>

<p dir="auto">For the first time since Netscape in 1994, it feels like we can reimagine browsers from scratch. The browser of tomorrow might not look like what we have today! That's why we're building Nxtscape - an open-source, agentic browser for the next era.</p>
<p dir="auto">We saw how tools like Cursor gave developers a 10x productivity boost, yet the browser—where we spend our entire day—feels stuck and we're constantly fighting it. I constantly have 70+ tabs open and lose track of them. Can't AI help group or close them? Simple workflows, like "order Tide Pods from my Amazon order history," should just work with agents right now. And form-filling is another huge pain that AI should be able to solve.</p>

<p dir="auto">We know there are other browsers. Here's why Nxtscape stands out:</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Nxtscape vs Chrome</h3><a id="user-content-nxtscape-vs-chrome" aria-label="Permalink: Nxtscape vs Chrome" href="#nxtscape-vs-chrome"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">While we're grateful for Google open-sourcing Chromium, the Chrome browser hasn't evolved much over the last 10 years and it lacks meaningful AI features (agentic automation, MCP support, ...).</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Nxtscape vs Brave</h3><a id="user-content-nxtscape-vs-brave" aria-label="Permalink: Nxtscape vs Brave" href="#nxtscape-vs-brave"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">We love what Brave started, but they've spread themselves too thin with crypto, search, VPNs, and other projects. Nxtscape is <strong>laser-focused</strong> on building the best <strong>AI-powered, productivity-focused, private browser</strong>. We want to bring you latest AI features sooner, like <strong>agentic automation and integrating MCP!</strong></p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Nxtscape vs Arc/Dia</h3><a id="user-content-nxtscape-vs-arcdia" aria-label="Permalink: Nxtscape vs Arc/Dia" href="#nxtscape-vs-arcdia"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Many loved Arc, but it was closed source. When the company abandoned it, users were left behind. That <strong>will never happen</strong> with Nxtscape. We are <strong>100% open source</strong>. If you don't like the direction we're going, you or the community can fork the code and build your own version. Power to the people!</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Nxtscape vs Perplexity Comet</h3><a id="user-content-nxtscape-vs-perplexity-comet" aria-label="Permalink: Nxtscape vs Perplexity Comet" href="#nxtscape-vs-perplexity-comet"></a></p>

    <p>Cloth is one of the most important goods a society can produce. Clothing is instrumental for culture, expression, and for protecting one's modesty. Historically, cloth was one of the most expensive items on the market. People bought one or two outfits at most and then wore them repeatedly for the rest of their lives. Clothing was treasured and passed down between generations the same way we pass jewelry down between generations. This cloth was made in factories by highly skilled weavers. These weavers had done the equivalent of PhD studies in weaving cloth and used state of the art hardware to do it.</p>
<p>As factories started to emerge, they were able to make cloth so much more cheaply than skilled weavers ever could thanks to inventions like the power loom. Power looms didn't require skilled workers operating them. You could even staff them with war orphans, which there was an abundance of thanks to all the wars. The quality of the cloth was absolutely terrible in comparison, but there was so much more of it made so much more quickly. This allowed the price of cloth to plummet, meaning that the wages that the artisans made fell from six shillings a day to six shillings per week over a period of time where the price of food doubled.</p>
<p>Mind you, the weavers didn't just reject technological progress for the sake of rejecting it. They tried to work with the ownership class and their power looms in order to produce the same cloth faster and cheaper than they had before. For a time, it did work out, but the powers that be didn't want that. They wanted more money at any cost.</p>
<p>At some point, someone had enough and decided to do something about it. Taking up the name Ned, he led a movement that resulted in riots, destroying factory equipment, and some got so bad they had to call the army in to break them up. Townspeople local to those factory towns were in full support of Ned's followers. Heck, even the soldiers sent to stop the riots ended up seeing the points behind what Ned's followers were doing and joined in themselves.</p>
<p>The ownership class destroyed the livelihood of the skilled workers so that they could make untold sums of money producing terrible cloth that people would turn their one-time purchase of clothing into a de-facto subscription that they had to renew every time their clothing wore out. Now we have fast fashion and don't expect our clothing to last more than a few years. I have a hoodie from AWS Re:Invent in 2022 that I'm going to have to throw out and replace because the sleeves are dying.</p>
<p>We only remember them as riots because their actions affected those in power. This movement was known as the Luddites, or the followers of Ned Ludd. The word "luddite" has since shifted meaning over time and is now understood as "someone who is against technological development". The Luddites were not against technology like the propaganda from the ownership class would have you expect, they fought against how it was implemented and the consequences of its rollout. They were skeptical that the shitty cloth that the power loom produced would be a net benefit to society because it meant that customers would inevitably have to buy their clothes over and over again, turning a one-time purchase into a subscription. Would that really benefit consumers or would that really benefit the owners of the factories?</p>
<p>Nowadays the Heritage Crafts Association of the United Kingdom lists many forms of weaving as <a href="https://www.heritagecrafts.org.uk/categories-of-risk/">Endangered or Critically Endangered crafts</a>, meaning that those skills are either at critical risk of dying out without any "fresh blood" learning how to do it, or the last generation of artisans that know how to do that craft are no longer teaching new apprentices. All that remains of that expertise is now contained in the R&amp;D departments of the companies that produce the next generations of power looms, and whatever heritage crafts practitioners remain.</p>
<p>Remember the Apollo program that let us travel to the moon? It was mostly powered by the Rocketdyne F1 engine. We have all of the technical specifications to build that rocket engine. We know all the parts you need, all the machining you have to do, and roughly understand how it would be done, but <a href="https://youtu.be/ovD0aLdRUs0">we can't build another Rocketdyne F1</a> because all of the finesse that had been built up around manufacturing it no longer exists. Society has moved on and we don't have expertise in the tools that they used to make it happen.</p>
<p>What are we losing in the process? We won't know until it's gone.</p>
<h2>We're going to run out of people with the word "Senior" in their title</h2>
<p>As I've worked through my career in computering, I've noticed a paradox that's made me uneasy and I haven't really been able to figure out why it keeps showing up: the industry only ever seems to want to hire people with the word Senior in their title. They almost never want to create people with the word Senior in their title. This is kinda concerning for me. People get old and no longer want to or are able to work. People get sick and become disabled. Accidental deaths happen and remove people from the workforce.</p>
<figure><a href="https://files.xeiaso.net/blog/2025/rolling-ladder-behind-us/dog-meme.jpg"><picture><source type="image/avif" srcset="https://files.xeiaso.net/blog/2025/rolling-ladder-behind-us/dog-meme.avif"><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://files.xeiaso.net/blog/2025/rolling-ladder-behind-us/dog-meme.webp"><img alt="A meme based on the format where the dog wants to fetch the ball but doesn't want to give the ball to the human to throw it, but with the text saying 'Senior?', 'Train Junior?', and 'No train junior, only hire senior'." loading="lazy" src="https://files.xeiaso.net/blog/2025/rolling-ladder-behind-us/dog-meme.jpg"></picture></a><figcaption>A meme based on the format where the dog wants to fetch the ball but doesn't want to give the ball to the human to throw it, but with the text saying 'Senior?', 'Train Junior?', and 'No train junior, only hire senior'.</figcaption></figure>
<p>If the industry at large isn't actively creating more people with the word Senior in their title, we are eventually going to run out of them. This is something that I want to address with Techaro at some point, but I'm not sure how to do that yet. I'll figure it out eventually. The non-conspiratorial angle for why this is happening is that money isn't free anymore and R&amp;D salaries are no longer taxable business expenses in the US, so software jobs that don't "produce significant value" are more risky to the company. So of course they'd steal from the future to save today. Sounds familiar, doesn't it?</p>
<div><p><img alt="Cadey is coffee" loading="lazy" src="https://stickers.xeiaso.net/sticker/cadey/coffee"></p><div><p><span><a href="https://xeiaso.net/characters#cadey">Cadey</a></span><span></span></p><p>Is this how we end up losing the craft of making high quality code the same
way we lost the craft of weaving high quality cloth?</p></div></div>
<p>However there's another big trend in the industry that concerns me: companies releasing products that replace expertise with generative AI agents that just inscrutably do the thing for you. This started out innocently enough - it was just better ways to fill in the blanks in your code. But this has ballooned and developed from better autocomplete to the point where you can <a href="https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/159068">just assign issues to GitHub Copilot</a> and have the issue magically get solved for you in a pull request. Ask the AI model for an essay and get a passable result in 15 minutes.</p>
<p>At some level, this is really cool. Like, think about it. This reduces toil and drudgery to waiting for half an hour at most. In a better world I would really enjoy having a tool like this to help deal with the toil work that I need to do but don't really have the energy to. Do you know how many more of these essays would get finished if I could offload some of the drudgery of my writing process to a machine?</p>
<p>We are not in such a better world. We are in a world where I get transphobic hate sent to the Techaro sales email. We are in a world where people like me are intentionally not making a lot of noise so that we can slide under the radar and avoid attention by those that would seek to destroy us. We are in a world where these AI tools are being pitched as the <a href="https://www.salesforce.com/news/stories/agentic-ai-reshapes-workforce/">next Industrial Revolution</a>, one where foisting our expertise away into language models is somehow being framed as a good thing for society.</p>
<p>There's just one small problem: who is going to be paid and reap the benefits from this change as expectations from the ownership class change? A lot of the ownership class only really experiences the work product outputs of what we do with computers. They don't know the struggles involved with designing things such as <a href="https://youtu.be/y8OnoxKotPQ">the user getting an email on their birthday</a>. They don't want to get pushback on things being difficult or to hear that people want to improve the quality of the code. They want their sparkle emoji buttons to magically make the line go up and they want them yesterday.</p>
<p>We deserve products that aren't cheaply made mass produced slop that incidentally does what people want instead of high quality products that are crafted to be exactly what people need, even if they don't know they need it.</p>
<p>Additionally, if this is such a transformational technology, why are key figures promoting it by talking down to people? Why wouldn't they be using this to <em>lift people up</em>?</p>

a lot better than hope ever will. Amygdala responses are pretty strong

<h2>Vibe coding is payday loans for technical debt</h2>
<p>As a technical educator, one of the things that I want to imprint onto people is that programming is a skill you can gain and that you too can both program things and learn how to program things. I want there to be more programmers out there. What I am about to say is not an attempt to gatekeep the skill and craft of computering; however, the ways that proponents of vibe coding are going about it are simply not the way forward to a sustainable future.</p>
<p>About a year ago, Cognition teased an AI product named <a href="https://devin.ai/">Devin</a>, a completely automated software engineer. You'd assign Devin tasks in Slack or Jira and then it would spin up a VM and plod its way through fixing whatever you asked it to. This demo deeply terrified me, as it was nearly identical to a story I wrote for the Techaro lore: <a href="https://xeiaso.net/blog/protos/">Protos</a>. The original source of that satire was experience working at a larger company that shall remain unnamed where the product team seemed to operate under the assumption that the development team had a secret "just implement that feature button" and that we as developers were working to go out of our way to <strong>NOT</strong> push it.</p>
<p>Devin was that "implement that feature" button the same way Protos mythically did. From what I've seen with companies that actually use Devin, it's nowhere near actually being useful and usually needs a lot of hand-holding to do anything remotely complicated, thank God.</p>
<p>The thing that really makes me worried is that the ownership class' expectations about the process of developing software are changing. People are being put on PIPs for not wanting to install Copilot. Deadlines come faster because <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ExperiencedDevs/comments/1kchah5/they_finally_started_tracking_our_usage_of_ai/">"the AI can write the code for you, right?"</a> Twitter and Reddit contain myriads of stories of "idea guys" using Cursor or Windscribe to generate their dream app's backend and then making posts like "some users claim they can see other people's stuff, what kind of developer do I need to hire for this?" Follow-up posts include gems such as "lol why do coders charge so much???"</p>
<p>By saving money in the short term by producing shitty software that doesn't last, are we actually spending more money over time re-buying nearly identical software after it evaporates from light use? This is the kind of thing that makes Canada not allow us to self-identify as Engineers, and I can't agree with their point more.</p>
<h3>Vibe Coding is just fancy UX</h3>
<p>Vibe coding is a distraction. It's a meme. It will come. It will go. Everyone will abandon the vibe coding tools eventually. My guess is that a lot of the startups propping up their vibe coding tools are trying to get people into monthly subscriptions as soon as possible so that they can mine passive income as their more casual users slowly give up on coding and just forget about the subscription.</p>
<p>I'm not gonna lie though, the UX of vibe coding tools is top-notch. From a design standpoint it's aiming for that subtle brilliance where it seems to read your mind and then fill in the blanks you didn't even know you needed filled in. This is a huge part of how you can avoid the terror of the empty canvas. If you know what you are doing, an empty canvas represents infinite possibilities. There's nothing there to limit you from being able to do it. You have total power to shape everything.</p>
<p>In my opinion, this is a really effective tool to help you get past that fear of having no ground to stand on. This helps you get past executive dysfunction and just ship things already. That part is a good thing. I genuinely want people to create more things with technology that are focused on the problems that they have. This is the core of how you learn to do new things. You solve small problems that can be applied to bigger circumstances. You gradually increase the scope of the problem as you solve individual parts of it.</p>
<p>I want more people to be able to do software development. I think that it's a travesty that we don't have basic computer literacy classes in every stage of education so that people know how the machines <strong>that control their lives</strong> work and how to use them to their advantage. Sure it's not as dopaminergic as TikTok or other social media apps, but there's a unique sense of victory that you get when things just work. Sometimes that feeling you get when things Just Work™ is the main thing that keeps me going. Especially in anno dominium two thousand and twenty five.</p>
<p>The main thing I'm afraid of is people becoming addicted to the vibe coding tools and letting their innate programming skills atrophy. I don't know how to suggest people combat this. I've been combating it by removing all of the automatic AI assistance from my editor (IE: I'll use a language server, but I won't have my editor do fill-in-the-middle autocomplete for me), but this isn't something that works for everyone. I've found myself more productive without it there and asking <a href="https://chatgpt.com/share/685430cf-79ec-800c-9ea2-251301066f3d">a model for the missing square peg to round hole</a> when I inevitably need some toil code made. I ended up not shipping that due to other requirements, but you get what I'm going at.</p>
<h3>The "S" in MCP stands for Security</h3>
<p>The biggest arguments I have against vibe coding and all of the tools behind it boil down to one major point: these tools have a security <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=matthew%207:24-27&amp;version=NIV">foundation of sand</a>. Most of the time when you install and configure a <a href="https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction">Model Context Protocol (MCP)</a> server, you add some information to a JSON file that your editor uses to know what tools it can dispatch with all of your configuration and API tokens. These MCP servers run as normal OS processes with absolutely no limit to what they can do. They can easily delete all files on your system, install malware into your autostart, or exfiltrate all your secrets without any oversight.</p>
<p>Oh, by the way, that whole "it's all in one JSON file with all your secrets" problem? That's now seen as a load-bearing feature so that scripts can automatically install MCP servers for you. You don't even need to get expertise in how the tools work! There's a MCP server installer MCP server so that you can say "Hey torment nexus, install GitHub integration for me please" and then it'll just do it with no human oversight or review on what you're actually installing. Seems safe to me! What could possibly go wrong?</p>
<p>If this is seriously the future of our industry, I wish that the people involved would take one trillionth of an iota of care about the security of the implementation. This is the poster child for something like the <a href="https://component-model.bytecodealliance.org/">WebAssembly Component Model</a>. This would let you define your MCP servers with strongly typed interfaces to the outside world that can be granted or denied permissions by users with strong capabilities. Combined with the concept of <a href="https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-06-18/server/resources">server resources</a>, this could let you expand functionality however you wanted. Running in WebAssembly means that the no MCP server can just read <code>~/.ssh/id_ed25519</code> and exfiltrate your SSH key. Running in WebAssembly means that it can't just connect to <code>probably-not-malware.lol</code> and then evaluate JavaScript code with user-level permissions on the fly. We shouldn't have to be telling developers "oh just run it all in Docker". We should have designed this to be fundamentally secure from the get-go. Personally, I only run MCP ecosystem things when contractually required to. Even then, I run it in a virtual machine that I've already marked as known compromised and use separate credentials not tied to me. Do with this information as you will.</p>
<p>I had a lot of respect for Anthropic before they released this feculent bile that is the Model Context Protocol spec and initial implementations to the public. It just feels so half-baked and barely functional. Sure I don't think they expected it to become the Next Big Meme™, but I thought they were trying to do things ethically above board. Everything I had seen from Anthropic before had such a high level of craft and quality, and this was such a huge standout.</p>
<p>We shouldn't have to be placing fundamental concerns like secret management or sandboxing as hand-waves to be done opt-in by the user. They're not gonna do it, and we're going to have <a href="https://forum.cursor.com/t/cursor-yolo-deleted-everything-in-my-computer/103131">more incidents where Cursor goes rogue and nukes your home folder</a> until someone cares enough about the craft of the industry to do it the right way.</p>
<h2>Everyone suffers so the few can gain</h2>
<p>I have a unique view into a lot of the impact that AI companies have had across society. I'm the CEO of <a href="https://techaro.lol/">Techaro</a>, a small one-person startup that develops <a href="https://anubis.techaro.lol/">Anubis</a>, a Web AI Firewall Utility that helps mitigate the load of automated mass scraping so that open source infrastructure can stay online. I've had sales calls with libraries and universities that are just being <em>swamped</em> by the load. There's stories of GitLab servers eating up <em>64 cores</em> of high-wattage server hardware due to all of the repeated scraping over and over in a loop. I swear a lot of this scraping has to be some kind of dataset arbitrage or something, that's the only thing that makes sense at this point.</p>
<p>And then in the news the AI companies claim "oh no we're just poor little victorian era orphans, we can't possibly afford to fairly compensate the people that made the things that make our generative AI models as great as they are". When the US copyright office <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/torconstantino/2025/05/29/us-copyright-office-shocks-big-tech-with-ai-fair-use-rebuke/">tried to make AI training not a fair use</a>, the head of that office suddenly found themselves jobless. Why must these companies be allowed to take everything without recourse or payment to the people that created the works that fundamentally power the models?</p>
<p>The actual answer to this is going to sound a bit out there, but stay with me: they believe that we're on the verge of creating artificial superintelligence; something that will be such a benevolent force of good that any strife in the short term will ultimately be cancelled out by the good that is created as a result. These people unironically believe that a machine god will arise and we'd be able to delegate all of our human problems to it and we'll all be fine forever. All under the thumb of the people that bought the GPUs with dollars to run that machine god.</p>
<p>As someone that grew up in a repressed environment full of evangelical christianity, I recognize this story instantly: it's the second coming of Christ wrapped in technology. Whenever I ask the true believers entirely sensible questions like "but if you can buy GPUs with dollars, doesn't that mean that whoever controls the artificial superintelligence thus controls everyone, even if the AI is fundamentally benevolent?" The responses I get are illuminating. They sound like the kinds of responses that evangelicals give when you question their faith.</p>
<h3>Artists suffer first</h3>
<p>Honestly though, the biggest impact I've seen across my friends has been what's happened to art commissions. I'm using these as an indicator for how the programming industry is going to trend. Software development is an art in the same vein as visual/creative arts, but a lot of the craft and process that goes into visual art is harder to notice because it gets presented as a flat single-dimensional medium.</p>
<p>Sometimes it can take days to get something right for a drawing. But most of the time people just see the results of the work, not the process that goes into it. This makes things like prompting "draw my Final Fantasy 14 character in Breath of the Wild" with images as references and getting a result in seconds look more impressive. If you commissioned a human to get a painting like this:</p>
<figure><a href="https://files.xeiaso.net/blog/2025/rolling-ladder-behind-us/zamqo-botw.jpg"><picture><source type="image/avif" srcset="https://files.xeiaso.net/blog/2025/rolling-ladder-behind-us/zamqo-botw.avif"><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://files.xeiaso.net/blog/2025/rolling-ladder-behind-us/zamqo-botw.webp"><img alt="An AI-generated illustration of my Final Fantasy 14 character composited into a screenshot of Breath of the Wild. Generated by GPT-4o through the ChatGPT interface. Inputs were a screenshot of Breath of the Wild and reference photos of my character." loading="lazy" src="https://files.xeiaso.net/blog/2025/rolling-ladder-behind-us/zamqo-botw.jpg"></picture></a><figcaption>An AI-generated illustration of my Final Fantasy 14 character composited into a screenshot of Breath of the Wild. Generated by GPT-4o through the ChatGPT interface. Inputs were a screenshot of Breath of the Wild and reference photos of my character.</figcaption></figure>
<p>It'd probably take at least a week or two as the artist worked through their commission queue and sent you in-progress works before they got the final results. By my estimates between the artists I prefer commissioning, this would cost somewhere between 150 USD and 500 EUR at minimum. Probably more when you account for delays in the artistic process and making sure the artist is properly paid for their time. It'd be a masterpiece that I'd probably get printed and framed, but it would take a nonzero amount of time.</p>
<p>If you only really enjoy the products of work and don't understand/respect any of the craftsmanship that goes into making it happen, you'd probably be okay with that instantly generated result. Sure the sun position in that image doesn't make sense, the fingers have weird definition, her tail is the wrong shape, it pokes out of the dress in a nonsensical way (to be fair, the reference photos have that too), the dress has nonsensical shading, and the layering of the armor isn't like the reference pictures, but you got the result in a minute!</p>
<p>A friend of mine runs <a href="https://furbooru.org/">an image board for furry art</a>. He thought that people would use generative AI tools as a part of their workflows to make better works of art faster. He was wrong, it just led to people flooding the site with the results of "wolf girl with absolutely massive milkers showing her feet paws" from their favourite image generation tool in every fur color imaginable, then with different characters, then with different anatomical features. There was no artistic direction or study there. Just an endless flood of slop that was passable at best.</p>
<p>Sure, you can make high quality art with generative AI. There's several comic series where things are incredibly temporally consistent because the artist trained their own models and took the time to genuinely gain expertise with the tools. They filter out the hallucination marks. They take the time to use it as a tool to accelerate their work instead of replacing their work. The boards they post it to go out of their way to excise the endless flood of slop and by controlling how the tools work they actually get a better result than they got by hand, much like how the skilled weavers were able to produce high quality cloth faster and cheaper with the power looms.</p>
<p>We are at the point where the artists want to go and destroy the generative image power looms. Sadly, they can't even though they desperately want to. These looms are locked in datacentres that are biometrically authenticated. All human interaction is done by a small set of trusted staff or done remotely by true believers.</p>
<p>I'm afraid of this kind of thing happening to the programming industry. A lot of what I'm seeing with vibe coding leading to short term gains at the cost of long term toil is lining up with this. Sure you get a decent result now, but long-term you have to go back and revise the work. This is a great deal if you are producing the software though; because that means you have turned one-time purchases into repeat customers as the shitty software you sold them inevitably breaks, forcing the customer to purchase fixes. The one-time purchase inevitably becomes a subscription.</p>
<p>We deserve more in our lives than good enough.</p>
<h2>Stop it with the sparkle emoji buttons</h2>
<p>Look, CEOs, I'm one of you so I get it. We've seen the data teams suck up billions for decades and this is the only time that they can look like they're making a huge return on the investment. Cut it out with shoving the sparkle emoji buttons in my face. If the AI-aided product flows are <em>so good</em> then the fact that they are using generative artificial intelligence should be <em>irrelevant</em>. You should be able to replace generative artificial intelligence with another technology and then the product will still be as great as it was before.</p>
<p>When I pick up my phone and try to contact someone I care about, I want to know that I am communicating with them and not a simulacrum of them. I can't have that same feeling anymore due to the fact that people that don't natively speak English are much more likely to filter things through ChatGPT to "sound professional".</p>
<p>I want your bad English. I want your bad art. I want to see the raw unfiltered expressions of humanity. I want to see your soul in action. I want to communicate with you, not a simulacrum that stochastically behaves like you would by accident.</p>
<p>And if I want to use an LLM, I'll use an LLM. Now go away with your sparkle emoji buttons and stop changing their CSS class names so that my uBlock filters keep working.</p>
<h2>The human cost</h2>
<p>This year has been a year full of despair and hurt for me and those close to me. I'm currently afraid to travel to the country I have citizenship in because the border police are run under a regime that is dead set on either elimination or legislating us out of existence. In this age of generative AI, I just feel so replaceable at my dayjob. My main work product is writing text that convinces people to use globally distributed object storage in a market where people don't realize that's something they actually need. Sure, this means that my path forward is simple: show them what they're missing out on. But I am just so tired. I hate this feeling of utter replaceability because you can get 80% as good of a result that I can produce with a single invocation of OpenAI's Deep Research.</p>
<p>Recently a decree came from above: our docs and blogposts need to be optimized for AI models as well as humans. I have domain expertise in generative AI, I know exactly how to write SEO tables and other things that the AI models can hook into seamlessly. The language that you have to use for that is nearly identical to what the cult leader used that one time I was roped into a cult. Is that really the future of marketing? Cult programming? I don't want this to be the case, but when you look out at everything out there, you can't help but see the signs.</p>
<p>Aspirationally, I write for humans. Mostly I write for the version of myself that was struggling a decade ago, unable to get or retain employment. I create things to create the environment where there are more like me, and I can't do that if I'm selling to soulless automatons instead of humans. If the artificial intelligence tools were…well…intelligent, they should be able to derive meaning from unaltered writing instead of me having to change how I write to make them hook better into it. If the biggest thing they're sold for is summarizing text and they can't even do that without author cooperation, what are we doing as a society?</p>
<p>Actually, what are we going to do when everyone that cares about the craft of software ages out, burns out, or escapes the industry because of the ownership class setting unrealistic expectations on people? Are the burnt out developers just going to stop teaching people the right ways to make software? Is society as a whole going to be <em>right</em> when they look back on the good old days and think that software used to be more reliable?</p>
<h2>The Butlerians had a point</h2>
<p>Frank Herbert's Dune world had superintelligent machines at one point. It led to a galactic war and humanity barely survived. As a result, all thinking machines were banned, humanity was set back technologically, and a rule was created: Thou shalt not make a machine in the likeness of a human mind. For a very long time, I thought this was very strange. After all, in a fantasy scifi world like Dune, thinking machines could automate so much toil that humans had to process. They had entire subspecies of humans that were functionally supercomputers with feelings that were used to calculate the impossibly complicated stellar draft equations so that faster-than-light travel didn't result in the ship zipping into a black hole, star, moon, asteroid, or planet.</p>
<p>After seeing a lot of the impact across humanity in later 2024 and into 2025, I completely understand the point that Frank Herbert had. It makes me wish that I could leave this industry, but this is the only thing that pays enough for me to afford life in a world where my husband gets casually laid off after being at the same company for six and a half years because some number in a spreadsheet put him on the shitlist. Food and rent keeps going up here, but wages don't. I'm incredibly privileged to be able to work in this industry as it is (I make enough to survive, don't worry), but I'm afraid that we're rolling the ladder up behind us so that future generations won't be able to get off the ground.</p>
<p>Maybe the problem isn't the AI tools, but the way they are deployed, who benefits from them, and what those benefits really are. Maybe the problem isn't the rampant scraping, but the culture of taking without giving anything back that ends up with groups providing critical infrastructure like FFmpeg, GNOME, Gitea, FreeBSD, NetBSD, and the United Nations having to resort to increasingly desperate measures to maintain uptime.</p>
<p>Maybe the problem really is winner-take-all capitalism.</p>
<hr>
<p>The deployment of generative artificial intelligence tools has been a disaster for the human race. They have allowed a select few to gain "higher productivity"; but they have destabilized society, have made work transactional, have subjected artists to indignities, have led to widespread psychological suffering for the hackers that build the tools AI companies rely on, and inflict severe damage on the natural world. The continued development of this technology will worsen this situation. It will certainly subject human beings to greater indignities and inflict greater damage on the natural world, it will probably lead to greater social disruption and psychological suffering, and it may lead to increased physical suffering even in "advanced" countries.</p>

<p>Past studies on <em>Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind</em> (風の谷のナウシカ; Topcraft, 1984) have primarily focused on its ecological themes and anti-war messages through analysis of the narrative as a whole or Nausicaä’s character. These studies address the ethical and environmental consequences of war shown through the dystopian nature of the film’s setting and its religious symbolism. However, I have seen almost no research on how visual storytelling contributes to these messages.</p>
<p>This paper addresses how the visual representation of the environmental consequences of war in <em>Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind</em> can impact our views of those issues in our world. The paper will show that the visuals in the film are not simply aesthetic decisions, but a crucial narrative device to convey the effects of war on both people and nature.</p>
<p>Therefore, this paper explores how Miyazaki uses elements of mise-en-scène such as color, lighting, body language and other visual storytelling elements to communicate and add emphasis to the anti-war messaging of the film; especially those that display both the ecological and human consequences of war. I argue that the film’s use of visuals not only supports the anti-war themes of the film as a whole but also adds a stronger emotional and moral weight to the story by reflecting real-life war technologies in its visuals. This allowed audiences to reflect on real-life issues regarding the environmental and human consequences of warfare. In this way, the film created a bridge between fantasy and reality, urging its viewers to strive for a more peaceful and environmentally conscious world.</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>Animated films, like many other art forms, can convey so much emotion and be filled to the brim with meaningful messages and ideas. Especially with animation, the director is able to display a myriad of stunning visuals that can be impossible to recreate in live action film. Throughout history we as humans have used storytelling and art to reflect on and understand the world and the current issues we face. With the state of our world being as it is, with conflict at every corner, with global warming and other environmental issues being more pressing matters than ever before, it is clear that the environmental messages in <em>Nausicaä</em> are of the utmost importance to our society today. This is why it is important to ask, how can the depiction of the environmental impact of war in this film help us change our view of and approach to these issues in real life?</p>
<p>Hayao Miyazaki’s 1984 film <em>Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind </em>follows the pacifistic and kindhearted princess of the Valley of the Wind as she navigates the apocalyptic landscape of the film, searching for a way to undo the damage caused by the wars of the past and prevent further damage in the present. Miyazaki’s filmography as a whole contains many important messages regarding the way in which humans interact with and affect the natural world. His films, including <em>Nausicaä</em>, focus on the relationships between humans and animals, exploring the imbalance between the human and natural worlds. With <em>Nausicaä</em> being the only film directed by Miyazaki that depicts a more modern style of warfare, this film could help to open people’s eyes to the damage war puts not just on the humans involved but on the environment which we all share.</p>
<p><em>Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind</em> was originally a manga of the same name that Hayao Miyazaki wrote for Animage, with it being released from February 1982 to March 1994. It saw great success amongst Japanese readers through its run. This prompted the manga’s adaptation into an animated film which was directed by Miyazaki and released to Japanese audiences in 1984. Due to the extreme inconsistencies between the original film and Showmen Inc.’s English dub of <em>Nausicaä </em>–renamed <em>Warriors of the Wind</em>– Miyazaki considered never releasing his films to foreign audiences again. This dub had changed the names of most characters, cut nearly 30 minutes off of the film and completely altered its message. Later, a deal was made between Studio Ghibli and Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment, and Miayzaki allowed them to dub his films under the condition that they make no cuts and keep the original meaning intact (Cinematheque, 2016). Because of this, Disney’s English dub will be the main focus of this paper (Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment, 1985).</p>
<h2>Keywords &amp; Terms</h2>
<p>For the purpose of this article, when referring to the natural world it would more specifically be described as the surrounding elements that are essential for the well-being of both human and non-human life which includes green spaces, wildlife habitats, biodiversity and clean air, water and soil. Additionally, there are several terms which one who has not watched the film would not be able to understand, and these terms are as follows.</p>
<p>The ohmu (Fig. 1) are enormous, powerful and intelligent pill bug-like animals which are feared by the people in the film due to the fact that they could be considered the kings of the toxic jungle.</p>

<p>The Toxic Jungle is a vast forest where the air, water, soil and plants are poisonous to all but the giant arthropods which inhabit it. The toxic jungle only became so poisonous after the Giant Warriors were used in the last days of the Ceramic War. The Giant Warriors (Fig. 2) are giant, biomechanical lifeforms which are treated, and act, more as weapons rather than as independent beings.</p>
<p>The Ceramic War is an apocalyptic war that occurred 1000 years before the events of the film in what was called the Ceramic Period, which destroyed civilization, caused an ecocide and created the vast Toxic Jungle during the Seven Days of Fire. The Seven Days of Fire was a seven-day period at the end of the Ceramic War in which the Giant Warriors were deployed.</p>

<h2>Literature Review</h2>
<p>When analyzing Miyazaki’s films, including <em>Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind</em>, often the messages regarding warfare’s effects on the natural world focus more on the direct impacts rather than the indirect ones. Additionally, many researchers look at the film from a spiritual lens with DeWeese-Boyd (2009) believing Nausicaä serves as a Christ-like figure, while both Morgan (2015) and Nunes (2021) believe that Nausicaä serves as an example of how to restore balance between humans and nature. Despite that, these authors see her role in restoring balance differently. Nunes believes that Nausicaä gave herself to nature, sacrificing her free will in order to heal the earth without personal bias. On the other hand, Morgan believes that she serves as an example of how the fragmentation between the mind, body, spirit and nature can be restored through respect and care for the natural world.</p>
<p>In addition to this, there are some researchers who believe that <em>Nausicaä</em> can be used as a teaching tool, with Kleese (2024) believing that, since the film is not directly associated with any singular real-life issue but with many different events and issues, it can be used in classrooms to help children understand the importance of nature and finding a democratic solution to both environmental and political issues in a more digestible way.</p>
<p>It is no wonder the previous research on Nausicaä has such a spiritual focus, as Miyazaki’s filmography as a whole often focuses on the relationship and imbalance between humans and the natural world in a very spiritual manner. However, <em>Nausicaä</em> not only explores the direct impacts of war and other human activities, but also their indirect ramifications. Thus, this paper will hopefully fill a gap in the existing <em>Nausicäa </em>literature by analyzing the film’s messages regarding warfare’s indirect effects on the environment and how this exercise can give us insight to our real-world problems.</p>
<h2>The importance of the environment</h2>
<p>Climate change and other environmental crises such as soil and water contamination are all issues which have been recognized as important by the public eye. From everyday people to those in important positions, most can agree that the health of the natural world is important to the health and survival of life on earth. As UN Secretary-General António Guterres said at the biodiversity COP in Montreal 2022, “Without nature, we have nothing” (Abbasi et al., 2023). Access to clean water is undeniably fundamental to life on Earth, be it human or not. Even with this being common knowledge, pollution has damaged water quality to a point where it is causing a rise in waterborne diseases and damaging the health of both freshwater and saltwater ecosystems (Abbasi et al., 2023). Additionally, the rising temperatures, extreme weather events, air pollution and the heightened spread of infectious diseases are just a few examples of major health issues exacerbated by climate change (Abbasi et al., 2023). As the human population grows, we see that demands on Earth’s ecosystems are becoming more unsustainable; with the way that we currently treat our environment, long-term human and non-human security are clearly at stake (dos Santos, 2024).</p>
<h2>The importance of war</h2>
<p>The ever-worsening health of our natural world impacts us in many ways. Land degradation and other environmental issues which may cause an area to be less habitable can lead to the disruption of social and economic systems. Shortages of land, shelter, food and water exacerbate poverty and the poor living conditions in many areas of the world (Anonymous, 2004), this in turn leads to mass migration and conflict over usable land and resources necessary for life (Abbasi et al., 2023). While the degradation of land can in itself cause wars to erupt between peoples disputing over the usable land, war can and has caused additional land degradation. In Afghanistan, for example, forests have been leveled and its land and farmlands polluted from the years of use of fuel, chemicals and mines during wartime (Bonds, 2015).</p>
<p>Certain practices of war have more devastating impacts on the longevity of our natural world. One poignant example of how destructive war can be to our planet can be seen in the burning of Kuwaiti oil wells that took place during the The Gulf War as a part of their scorched earth tactics. This resulted both in the soil becoming contaminated with excessive amounts of hydrocarbons and heavy metals and in the release of massive amounts of particulate matter and other pollutants into the atmosphere (Aldawsari, 2024).</p>
<h2>The importance of film</h2>
<p>Everything from the way a shot is framed to the smallest detail captured within the shot can have an effect on the viewers of a film. Displaying intense emotional imagery has been proven to have significant psychological effects on viewers. For instance, the Kuleshov effect is a famous example of how film influences viewers’ emotional perception; it has shown that point-of-view editing practices influence viewers’ emotional interpretation of neutral facial expressions in a face-scene-face sequence (Cao et al., 2024). With this in mind it is evident that the things that films show their viewers can and do impact how they view the world.</p>
<p>At the same, time films utilize the elements of mise-en-scène to convey messages to their audience. Mise-en-scène is a French term meaning what is put into a scene or frame and consists of all the visual information in front of the camera (Caprio, 2021). Understanding these elements may help understand what the director of a film wants to convey with any given scene and understand how the visuals impact the audience.</p>
<h2>Why anime?</h2>
<p>All forms of filmography are capable of affecting their audiences with the previously mentioned methods. However, animation is often able to employ visuals and different types of shots which can often be extremely difficult or expensive to replicate in live action film. Because of this and because animated films in the West are often avoidant of more serious topics, seeing as they are viewed as being only for small children, that Japanese animation, or anime, can be an immensely powerful and impactful type of filmmaking. Several studies have shown that anime can influence its audience and evoke positive changes in them (e.g., Yusof et al., 2024). With the unique perspective that anime provides, which is more provocative, tragic and contains far more complicated storylines than the ones seen in American popular cinema, anime has proven itself to be a tool for understanding the complex human–environment relationship and environmental problems (Mumcu &amp; Yılmaz, 2018).</p>
<h2>Why Miyazaki?</h2>
<p>Within the anime community Hayao Miyazaki has carved out an image for himself as a masterful director who is skilled in creating both enchanting fantasies and incredibly thought-provoking films (Mumcu &amp; Yılmaz, 2018). He is quite well renowned for his beautiful landscapes, heavy ecological themes and overall beautiful and touching storytelling. Several of his films such as <em>Princess Mononoke</em>, <em>Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind</em> and even <em>Ponyo</em> feature themes of ecological imbalance as the main plot points of the films. Even those which do not have these themes quite as ingrained in the plot still have some commentary on the matter or feature more lighthearted takes on nature’s relationship with humanity. This can be seen in the stories of <em>Spirited Away</em> and <em>My Neighbor Totoro</em>. Additionally, many of his films also approach themes of war and conflict, such as <em>Princess Mononoke</em>, <em>Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind</em>, <em>Porco Rosso</em>, <em>Castle in the Sky</em>, <em>Howl’s Moving Castle</em> and <em>The Wind Rises</em>. This leaves only six of his fifteen films, all of which have seen great success, with no themes of interest to this paper. For this reason, it is evident that Miyazaki is a perfect choice for the subject matter of this paper.</p>
<h2>Why Nausicaä?</h2>
<p>With only six of the fifteen films Miyazaki has directed or written having no themes of interest to this paper, one may wonder what it is that makes <em>Nausicaä</em> more suitable than any of his other films. Well, though many of his films touch on environmental issues with Miyazaki even going as far as saying “I’ve come to a point where I just can’t make a movie without addressing the problem of humanity as part of an ecosystem” in an interview with Asia Pulse, May 16, 1997, not many of his films include war in the main storyline. Only five do, as mentioned above. There are only two films, <em>Nausicaä </em>and <em>Princess Mononoke</em>, that cover both environmental issues and war. The major factor which puts <em>Nausicaä</em> over <em>Princess Mononoke</em> is the setting; <em>Princess Mononoke </em>is set in Japan’s late Muromachi Period, which was characterized by rapid industrialization and frequent conflicts. On the other hand, <em>Nausicaä </em>is set in the post-apocalyptic future which bears much resemblance to our world, with some current technologies such as guns, grenades and tanks being included, as well as fictitious technologies which closely mirror real-life technologies (e.g., how the Giant Warriors function similarly to nuclear bombs).</p>
<h2>Methodology</h2>
<p>As previously stated, the Kuleshov effect demonstrates that intense visuals can alter one’s interpretation of the world and this in itself proves that analysis via the elements of mise-en-scène is a viable method for breaking down <em>Nausicaä</em> with the purpose of determining how the visual depiction of the environmental impact of war can affect our view of and approach to these issues in real life. However, this isn’t the only reason mise-en-scène analysis was used within this study, since it has been used for teaching aspiring filmmakers how films communicate messages with visuals; as my question focuses on visual depictions in film, mise-en-scène analysis was perfectly suited for my project. The elements of mise-en-scène are as follows: settings and props, costume, hair and makeup, facial expressions and body language, lighting and color and lastly positioning. Each of the 38 scenes of the film were analyzed to see how these elements are utilized and what effect it can have on the audience.</p>
<h2>Findings</h2>
<p>Throughout the film the elements of mise-en-scène can be seen in use in many ways. Despite the subtle differences in the amount each element is used in the different parts of the story, the overall message urges viewers to rethink their stance on warfare and its technologies, not just for the impact it directly has on humans, but also for the sake of the natural world.</p>
<h2>War technologies</h2>
<p>One example of how body language, facial expressions and color are used to push the film’s message regarding the use of war technologies can be perfectly seen in the opening credits, which appear in scene two directly after the narrator introduces the world reading aloud the words that can be seen in figure one that state “One thousand years have passed since the collapse of industrialized civilization. The Toxic Jungle now spreads, threatening the survival of the last of the human race.” Right after this is read as the credits roll a tapestry is panned over, shown in Figure 3.</p>

<p>The tapestry shows how the creation of the Giant Warriors led to the creation of the Toxic Jungle and the fall of humanity. Within this tapestry, while in the process of building the warriors they appear confident in their body language and facial expressions, they are clearly calm and all is well. However, the colors of the warrior are bright and clash with that of the people which are more muted browns rather than the bright blues reds and yellows of the warrior. This itself already sets up for the destructive and overpowering nature of the Giant Warriors before they have even been finished and this is only confirmed when they are soon after in the tapestry shown wreaking havoc on the very same people who created them. In contrast to their poised expression and way of holding themselves previously in the tapestry, here they appear to be in great distress and panic. While this on its own is a striking visual representation of how dangerous technologies can be, even to their own creators, these visuals are given new meaning when we see the Giant Warriors in actual use towards the end of the film.</p>
<p>The audience was shown the similarities between the Giant Warriors and nuclear bombs in several instances towards the end of the film; in particular, there is one which really drives home the parallels between them (Figs. 4 and 5). In this scene, the Giant Warrior is being used by the main antagonist, its form being completely fictional and bearing no resemblance to real-life technologies, with the warrior shooting a beam of light from its mouth. The explosion that this caused very closely resembles the mushroom shape of nuclear bombs. Other aspects of this scene that help to draw similarities between this fictional tool of destruction and the very real nuclear weapons we have, such as the fact that before it dies the warrior only sets off two explosions. This could be a reflection of the fact that these technologies have only seen practical use twice, once in Hiroshima and once in Nagasaki. While these parallels alone drive a case for the film’s anti-war messaging, other elements regarding the Giant Warriors in other scenes help to push this narrative as well.</p>

<p>Every scene which has the Giant Warrior in it, from the beginning to the end of the film, is decisively negative. Around the middle of the film there is a scene where the warrior is in a sort of incubation. The film explains that the warrior needs time to develop before it is able to be used as a war machine and walk on its own. The warrior is depicted within this scene with its colors being both muddy and bloody, with the lighting highlighting not only its strange shape but also how slimy it appears. This all helps to show how grotesque it is, even when it hasn’t started to be destructive. With the clear parallels it has to nuclear weapons, it becomes obvious from nearly every mention and appearance of the Giant Warrior that if it is so grotesque and dangerous, then nuclear weapons must be just as horrifying. This specific scene very well pushes the idea that not only is the use of nuclear weapons immoral but so too is the development of them.</p>
<p>Aside from nuclear weapons, there are other very real weapons displayed in the film that we continue to use to this day. Such weapons include machine guns, shotguns, hand grenades, flash grenades and even larger things like gunships or tanks. While nearly all of these are represented in a very realistic way, the gunships are undoubtedly designed with significant creative liberty as the bodies of these aircrafts do not resemble any real aircraft. However, this does not mean these do not give a good representation of the flaws of such technologies. For examples, see Figures 6 and 7.</p>

<p>All of the previously mentioned technologies of war are portrayed within the film in a distinctly negative way. However, this does not mean that the film means to say there is absolutely no acceptable use of such things; there are also times when these are shown to be neutral or even positive. In truth there is a strong possibility that this film means to say that these technologies themselves are not evil, but the way that we as humans interact with them can make them that way. Nausicaä herself uses her gun towards the beginning of the film to remove part of an ohmu shell and she uses flash grenades to stun an ohmu, saving Lord Yupa. In the former instance, the use of the gun is shown in a completely neutral context, with it not even being used on any living thing and with the entire scene remaining quite peaceful; even the choices of lighting and colors being brighter than other parts of the Toxic Jungle adding to the serenity of the scene. This scene shows that such things can be used without causing any harm whatsoever. In the other instance the grenades are clearly used to stun the ohmu in order to protect and reduce harm for both parties.</p>
<p>In the instances in which these technologies are used in a harmful way, the negativity of it is conveyed both in the expression of the characters witnessing it or by the colors shown in the scene. With the scene of the Giant Warrior being used towards the end of the film, the characters on both sides are clearly in shock and awe of just how destructive this technology can be. Additionally, the use of color in that scene helps in pushing just how the use of these technologies causes far more harm than good. The warrior itself is melting into this dark bloody red sludge; this nasty red is contrasted with its sharp green eyes that appear completely devoid of any sort of soul. Its visage is utterly grotesque and it remains that way till it falls apart.</p>
<p>Other technologies that are more often used in warfare today are also critiqued. Towards the end of the film conflicts arise in the Valley with the people finally fighting back against the Tolmakian forces that have been occupying their land. Prior to this, the valley is shown to be a very peaceful and beautiful place with plenty of lush greenery and farmlands; the downfall of this serene environment begins when spores are found in the forest surrounding the valley. See Figures 8 and 9 for the before and after, respectively.</p>

<p>Initially, the people mean only to use their tools to burn the spores, using fire in moderation in order to solve their problem. However, things quickly get out of hand and they realize that they have no choice but to burn the entire forest down if they don’t want the Toxic Jungle to spread into the valley. This is the first time in the film that the valley is shown with colors like black, brown and others that are associated with decay, being more prevalent than greens and other more natural or lively colors. Throughout the entire film the use of fire is heavily frowned upon with Ohbaba warning the Tolmekians of why they should not even attempt to burn down the toxic jungle and, towards the end of the film, several characters going on about why they prefer the ways of the water and the wind over the way of fire since “Too much fire gives birth to nothing. Fire can reduce a forest to ashes in a day, while it takes the water and the wind 100 years to grow one”. With this film Miyazaki is urging us to stop relying on fire to solve our problems, both in a literal and figurative sense. This is shown not just through the speech of the characters but also in the way that the scenery changes and the way the characters react to the use of excess fire.</p>
<h2>Human &amp; environmental impact</h2>
<p>In the film the human and environmental impact of human activities such as war are explored in many scenes. One example of this can be seen in one scene towards the end of the film where Nausicaä and another character, Asbel, fly into the city of Pejite together on Nausicaä’s glider (Figs. 10, 11). It had previously been occupied by the Tolmekian forces but as they fly over it, the city is desolate and run down. The film reveals that the people of Pejite baited some of the ohmu into the city and let them wreak havoc in order to drive out the Tolmekians occupying the city. The film tries to show the audience how immoral this decision was not just from the sorrowful and ashamed expressions on the faces of the Pejite refugees and Asbel, the prince of Pejite. It also shows the impact these actions have had on the fauna, as the scenery is full of deceased animals of the Toxic Jungle. Additionally, while it is apparent that the city was once livable, now the characters need to use their masks to even be able to breathe within its premises. This shows that the damage done here was severe as some buildings were broken down, lives were lost and the land has been made uninhabitable for the foreseeable future.</p>

<p>The Pejite use the same strategy again later in the film. In this second instance, they lure the ohmu into the Valley of the Wind in order to keep the Giant Warrior out of the hands of the Tolmekians. There were several scenes which depict this event since it is the major conflict of the film; however, since the previous scene examined focused more on the environmental impact of this act, here the focus is on the human impact. In the scene Mito, who serves sort of as the assistant to Princess Nausicaä, returns to the Valley of the Wind and informs both the people of the valley and the occupying forces of the Tolmekians of the ohmu horde heading towards them. The audience is shown in this scene how much panic and distress the news brings both to the innocent citizens of the occupied territory and to the occupying forces, who were the only real target of this attack. The expressive use of facial expression and body language in this scene helps drive home just how impactful this is, even to the people who were never meant to be a target of this attack. Another scene that comes soon after reinforces this idea, when the insects begin their attack on the valley. This scene is utter chaos, the people attempt to seek shelter and the Tolmekian soldiers who were previously standing without shelter, emboldened by their control of the Giant Warrior, now scramble seeking shelter and clearly fearing for their lives. The expressiveness of this scene comes not only from the facial expressions and body language but also from the shaky and strange positioning of the camera which gives the scene a more panicked feel. In addition, the colors were muddled and the lighting was quite dim, with sudden flashes of bright blaring light that fed into the chaotic nature of the scene. This all works to show just how impactful efforts of war can be to humans, their environment and the other creatures who share it.</p>
<h2>Limitations</h2>
<p>Certain aspects of the method I chose when designing this project limited the results of my research. For instance, because I focused only on the visuals, my data does not take into account the role that the script, voice acting (especially the original) or soundtrack played in delivering certain messages to the audience. Additionally, while one can analyze, interpret, and hypothesize the main message(s) in the film and in each scene, it is impossible to extrapolate for all audiences. During the research process for this study, many additional questions have come up, including the following. Firstly, what effects do the audio elements of <em>Nausicaä</em> have on the audience? Secondly, can <em>Nausicaä</em> even be compared to Western religions given the fact that it was made in Japan? Lastly, how is the film interpreted by younger viewers versus older viewers?</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Through its stunning visual story-telling, <em>Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind</em> invites its audience to reconsider the toll war takes not just on people, but also the environment. With color, body language, facial expressions, and the overall environment of scenes, Miyazaki warns against the dangers of harmful technology and the moral implications of its use. From the violent and gruesome images of the Giant Warrior and destroyed landscape as a result of the use of war technology, to the depleted and unsafe landscapes and fearful gazes of terrified civilians robbed of their homes and any sense of normalcy, the film seeks to depict the enormous destructiveness that results from war. Additionally, Miyazaki’s illustrations are much more than fantasy, nodding toward the real world where parallel destruction occurs via nuclear weapons, environmental crises and modern warfare. The overarching message of the film’s visuals serves not only to paint a narrative, but to urge us to meet conflict with empathy, to protect our natural environment, and understand that it takes more courage and wisdom to find peace than to wage war. Although this data is subjective, seeing as it was based on my interpretation of the film’s visuals, it still suggests that visual storytelling has the potential to convey the ecologically damaging effects of war. Additionally, this discussion makes a contribution to the academic conversations on film, war and environmental sustainability all at the same time. Offering a visual, scene-based approach to analyzing storytelling that depicts war and environmental crisis in anime. Despite all this, further research is needed on large audience reception of these visual messages, cultural responses to these messages, or the influence auditory elements of film can have in delivering these messages.</p>

          <p>I’m Chris McCord, the creator of Elixir’s Phoenix framework. For the past several months, I’ve been working on a skunkworks project at Fly.io, and it’s time to show it off.</p>
<p>I wanted LLM agents to work just as well with Elixir as they do with Python and JavaScript. Last December, in order to figure out what that was going to take, I started a little weekend project to find out how difficult it would be to build a coding agent in Elixir.</p>

<p>A few weeks later, I had it spitting out working Phoenix applications and driving a full in-browser IDE. I knew this wasn’t going to stay a weekend project.</p>

<p>If you follow me on Twitter, you’ve probably seen me teasing this work as it picked up steam. We’re at a point where we’re pretty serious about this thing, and so it’s time to make a formal introduction.</p>

<p>World, meet <a href="https://phoenix.new/" title="">Phoenix.new</a>, a batteries-included fully-online coding agent tailored to Elixir and Phoenix. I think it’s going to be the fastest way to build collaborative, real-time applications.</p>

<p>Let’s see it in action:</p>

<h2 id="whats-interesting-about-phoenix-new"><a href="#whats-interesting-about-phoenix-new" aria-label="Anchor"></a><span>What’s Interesting About Phoenix.new</span></h2>
<p>First, even though it runs entirely in your browser, Phoenix.new gives both you and your agent a root shell, in an ephemeral virtual machine (a <a href="https://fly.io/docs/machines/overview/" title="">Fly Machine</a>) that gives our agent loop free rein to install things and run programs  — without any risk of messing up your local machine. You don’t think about any of this; you just open up the VSCode interface, push the shell button, and there you are, on the isolated machine you share with the Phoenix.new agent.</p>

<p>Second, it’s an agent system I built specifically for Phoenix. Phoenix is about real-time collaborative applications, and Phoenix.new knows what that means. To that end, Phoenix.new includes, in both its UI and its agent tools, a full browser. The Phoenix.new agent uses that browser “headlessly” to check its own front-end changes and interact with the app. Because it’s a full browser, instead of trying to iterate on screenshots, the agent sees real page content and JavaScript state – with or without a human present.</p>
<h2 id="what-root-access-gets-us"><a href="#what-root-access-gets-us" aria-label="Anchor"></a><span>What Root Access Gets Us</span></h2>
<p>Agents build software the way you did when you first got started, the way you still do today when you prototype things. They don’t carefully design Docker container layers and they don’t really do release cycles. An agent wants to pop a shell and get its fingernails dirty.</p>

<p>A fully isolated virtual machine means Phoenix.new’s fingernails can get <em>arbitrarily dirty.</em> If it wants to add a package to <code>mix.exs</code>, it can do that and then run <code>mix phx.server</code> or <code>mix test</code> and check the output. Sure. Every agent can do that. But if it wants to add an APT package to the base operating system, it can do that too, and make sure it worked. It owns the whole environment.</p>

<p>This offloads a huge amount of tedious, repetitive work.</p>

<p>At his <a href="https://youtu.be/LCEmiRjPEtQ?si=sR_bdu6-AqPXSNmY&amp;t=1902" title="">startup school talk last week</a>, Andrej Karpathy related his experience of building a restaurant menu visualizer, which takes camera pictures of text menus and transforms all the menu items into pictures. The code, which he vibe-coded with an LLM agent, was the easy part; he had it working in an afternoon. But getting the app online took him a whole week.</p>

<p>With Phoenix.new, I’m taking dead aim at this problem. The apps we produce live in the cloud from the minute they launch. They have private, shareable URLs (we detect anything the agent generates with a bound port and give it a preview URL underneath <code>phx.run</code>, with integrated port-forwarding), they integrate with Github, and they inherit all the infrastructure guardrails of Fly.io: hardware virtualization, WireGuard, and isolated networks.</p>
<p>Github’s <code>gh</code> CLI is installed by default. So the agent knows how to clone any repo, or browse issues, and you can even authorize it for internal repositories to get it working with your team’s existing projects and dependencies.</p>
<p>Full control of the environment also closes the loop between the agent and deployment. When Phoenix.new boots an app, it watches the logs, and tests the application. When an action triggers an error, Phoenix.new notices and gets to work.</p>
<h2 id="watch-it-build-in-real-time"><a href="#watch-it-build-in-real-time" aria-label="Anchor"></a><span>Watch It Build In Real Time</span></h2>
<p><a href="https://phoenix.new/" title="">Phoenix.new</a> can interact with web applications the way users do: with a real browser.</p>

<p>The Phoenix.new environment includes a headless Chrome browser that our agent knows how to drive. Prompt it to add a front-end feature to your application, and it won’t just sketch the code out and make sure it compiles and lints. It’ll pull the app up itself and poke at the UI, simultaneously looking at the page content, Javascript state, and serverside logs.</p>

<p>Phoenix is all about <a href="https://fly.io/blog/how-we-got-to-liveview/" title="">“live” real-time</a> interactivity, and gives us seamless live reload. The user interface for Phoenix.new itself includes a live preview of the app being worked on, so you can kick back and watch it build front-end features incrementally. Any other <code>.phx.run</code> tabs you have open also update as it goes. It’s wild.</p>
<video title="agent interacting with web" autoplay="autoplay" loop="loop" muted="muted" playsinline="playsinline" disablepictureinpicture="true" src="https://fly.io/blog/phoenix-new-the-remote-ai-runtime/assets/webjs.mp4"></video>

<h2 id="not-just-for-vibe-coding"><a href="#not-just-for-vibe-coding" aria-label="Anchor"></a><span>Not Just For Vibe Coding</span></h2>
<p>Phoenix.new can already build real, full-stack applications with WebSockets, Phoenix’s Presence features, and real databases. I’m seeing it succeed at business and collaborative applications right now.</p>

<p>But there’s no fixed bound on the tasks you can reasonably ask it to accomplish. If you can do it with a shell and a browser, I want Phoenix.new to do it too. And it can do these tasks with or without you present.</p>

<p>For example: set a <code>$DATABASE_URL</code> and tell the agent about it. The agent knows enough to go explore it with <code>psql</code>, and it’ll propose apps based on the schemas it finds. It can model Ecto schemas off the database. And if MySQL is your thing, the agent will just <code>apt install</code> a MySQL client and go to town.</p>

<p>Frontier model LLMs have vast world knowledge. They generalize extremely well. On stage at ElixirConfEU, I did a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ojL_VHc4gLk&amp;t=3923s" title="">demo vibe-coding Tetris</a> on stage. Phoenix.new nailed it, first try, first prompt. It’s not like there’s gobs of Phoenix LiveView Tetris examples floating around the Internet! But lots of people have published Tetris code, and lots of people have written LiveView stuff, and 2025 LLMs can connect those dots.</p>

<p>At this point you might be wondering – can I just ask it to build a Rails app? Or an Expo React Native app? Or Svelte? Or Go?</p>

<p>Yes, you can.</p>

<p>Our system prompt is tuned for Phoenix today, but all languages you care about are already installed. We’re still figuring out where to take this, but adding new languages and frameworks definitely ranks highly in my plans.</p>
<h2 id="our-async-agent-future"><a href="#our-async-agent-future" aria-label="Anchor"></a><span>Our Async Agent Future</span></h2>
<p><a href="https://fly.io/blog/youre-all-nuts/" title="">We’re at a massive step-change in developer workflows</a>.</p>

<p>Agents can do real work, today, with or without a human present. Buckle up: the future of development, at least in the common case, probably looks less like cracking open a shell and finding a file to edit, and more like popping into a CI environment with agents working away around the clock.</p>

<p>Local development isn’t going away. But there’s going to be a shift in where the majority of our iterations take place. I’m already using Phoenix.new to triage <code>phoenix-core</code> Github issues and pick problems to solve. I close my laptop, grab a cup of coffee, and wait for a PR to arrive — Phoenix.new knows how PRs work, too. We’re already here, and this space is just getting started.</p>

<p>This isn’t where I thought I’d end up when I started poking around. The Phoenix and LiveView journey was much the same. Something special was there and the projects took on a life of their own. I’m excited to share this work now, and see where it might take us. I can’t want to see what folks build.</p>
