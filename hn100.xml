    <section>
        
<hr>

<hr>
<p>I have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_dysphoria">gender dysphoria</a>. I find labels overly reifying; I feel reluctant to call myself <em>transgender</em>, per se: when prompted to state my gender identity or preferred pronouns, I fold my hands into the <a href="https://www.yogapedia.com/definition/6871/dhyana-mudra"><em>dhyana mudra</em></a> and state that I <em>practice <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C5%9A%C5%ABnyat%C4%81">emptiness</a> on the concept of gender</em>. Mostly people seem to vibe it, but sometimes it feels a little like weasel words. Other times, when I’m in a sillier mood, I’ll tell people I’m <em>genderfluid</em> – if only because it sounds like something I’d put in my station wagon. Of course, my faithful Subaru Outback was made before 2008, which means it wants the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Genuine-Subaru-SOA868V9210-Coolant-Gallon/dp/B007L72U1C/">green, long-life genderfluid</a>…</p>
<p>I experience an ongoing <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2013/02/18/typical-mind-and-gender-identity/">brain-body map</a> <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/09/05/book-review-surfing-uncertainty/">prediction error</a> – my brain seems to expect a differently shaped body to the one I wound up with. I have been acutely aware of this since before I hit puberty. Out of shame and embarassment, I suppressed this, but I also made a promise to myself that if I hadn’t come out by the time I turned thirty then I was allowed to get as weird as I needed to.</p>
<!-- To expand on the above: While I experience strong bodily dysphoria, I don't necessarily experience strong dysphoria around my sense of identity. It's possible that this is because I'm so chronically depersonalised that there's nothing really *there* to hang a sense of identity on. It's also possible that any sense of femininity I once felt was so deeply buried by the time I unearthed all this that I have a difficult time reconnecting to it. -->
<p>During the COVID-19 pandemic I went through a phase of using self-administered ketamine therapy to refactor a long list of maladaptive behavioural patterns, and eventually this particular issue became impossible to ignore. I had avoided reifying it for long enough, and this wasn’t working for me – I had to try something different. One evening in July 2021, I sat down with a close friend. <em>I am going to put a large amount of ketamine up my nose</em>, I said. <em>Your job is to start asking me questions about my sexuality.</em></p>
<p>Not long after, I had jumped through the relevant bureaucratic hoops, <!-- backed up my gametes, --> and subsequently found myself cycling home from the pharmacy with a paper bag filled with repurposed menopause medication – a starter pack of <em>100 µg/24 hr</em> estradiol patches, to be applied twice a week.</p>

</figure>
<p>While the <em>physical</em> effects of estrogen are <a href="https://genderdysphoria.fyi/en/second-puberty-fem">well-documented</a>, back when I came out I had difficulty finding detailed phenomenological reports of the <em>subjective</em> effects of estrogen. I did wind up reading a large number of anecdotal reports on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender">Reddit</a>, and found that in aggregate, people tend to report <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/rfpokm/mental_effects_of_estrogen_hrt/">positive subjective effects</a>. One could propose a number of non-exclusive hypotheses as to why – I’ll attempt to review these later in this post.</p>
<p>Did it make sense for me to try this? It was time to find out for myself. I unboxed the patches and placed one on my stomach.</p>

<h2 id="what-does-estrogen-do"><a href="#what-does-estrogen-do">What does estrogen <em>do</em>?</a></h2>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_hormone">sex hormones</a> – <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Androgen">androgens</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estrogen">estrogens</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progestogen">progestogens</a> – are produced by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endocrine_system">endocrine system</a>. They are released into the bloodstream in response to a range of regulatory factors – primarily the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothalamic%E2%80%93pituitary%E2%80%93gonadal_axis">hypothalamic–pituitary–gonadal axis</a> – as a signal for distant cells to regulate a wide variety of bodily functions.</p>

<p>At the other end, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"><em>receptors</em></a> are – very generally speaking – a class of proteins which can <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conformational_change">change their shape</a> when <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligand_(biochemistry)">specific molecules</a> bind to them. Of these, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estrogen_receptor"><em>estrogen receptors</em></a> are primarily <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_receptor"><em>nuclear receptors</em></a>, although a smaller fraction of them are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_surface_receptor"><em>cell surface receptors</em></a>. These are typically located in the cell’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytoplasm"><em>cytoplasm</em></a> – but when activated, they pass through the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_envelope"><em>nuclear membrane</em></a>, bind directly to DNA, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression">regulate the expression of specific genes</a>. For comparison, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurotransmitter_receptor"><em>neurotransmitter receptors</em></a> are primarily <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_surface_receptor"><em>cell surface receptors</em></a>. These are located in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_membrane"><em>cell membrane</em></a> – and when activated might <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligand-gated_ion_channel">allow ions to pass through the cell membrane</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabotropic_receptor">trigger other messaging systems within the cell</a>.</p>

<p>Estrogen receptors are located throughout the body. Of these, there are two main types – <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ER%CE%B1">ERα</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estrogen_receptor_beta">ERβ</a>. These have similar <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligand_(biochemistry)#binding_affinity">binding affinities</a> for estradiol, but are expressed in different proportions in different bodily tissues, and can have different effects on gene regulation.</p>
<p>Estrogen receptors are of course also located in the brain. <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33396472/">The Role of Estrogen Receptors and Their Signaling across Psychiatric Disorders</a> (Hwang et al., 2020) includes a map of where they are concentrated:</p>

<p>It is not surprising, then, that estrogen can have an influence on multiple aspects of brain function, including neurotransmitter levels. There’s a recent review paper which covers the latest information we have on this. From <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/neuroscience/articles/10.3389/fnins.2024.1348551/full">The impact of estradiol on serotonin, glutamate, and dopamine systems</a> (Bendis et al., 2024):</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Estradiol is a steroid hormone that influences the serotonergic, dopaminergic, and glutamatergic systems. Estradiol exerts its effects through classical mechanisms by binding to nuclear estrogen receptors α, and β, or through nonclassical mechanisms through binding to membrane bound estrogen receptors α, β, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPER">GPER</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The effects are so wide-ranging that any review I can write will no doubt oversimplify things. That said, I’d like to highlight two findings relevant to neurotransmitter levels:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serotonin"><em>Serotonin</em></a> synthesis is upregulated by ERβ via <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tryptophan_hydroxylase">tryptophan hydroxylase</a> transcription.</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dopamine"><em>Dopamine</em></a> synthesis is upregulated by ERα and downregulated by ERβ via <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrosine_hydroxylase">tyrosine hydroxylase</a> transcription. Potentially, they work in tandem to maintain homeostatic levels, but ERα has greater influence at higher estradiol levels.</li>
</ul>
<p>These neurotransmitters are, of course, <a href="https://x.com/AskYatharth/status/1615157727625637888">stereotypically</a> associated with <em>mood</em> and <em>reward</em>.</p>

<p>Estrogen receptors can also upregulate or downregulate production of neurotransmitter receptors. However, most of the evidence we have for this is from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligand_binding_assay">binding assays</a> performed on <em>rats</em>. As stated in another review paper, <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/neuroscience/articles/10.3389/fnins.2015.00037/full">Sex hormones affect neurotransmitters and shape the adult female brain during hormonal transition periods</a> (Barth et al., 2015):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Evidence from neuroimaging findings to link estrogen and the
serotonergic system in humans are still relatively sparse. Animal
data support ovariectomy to decrease <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5-HT1_receptor">5-HT1</a> binding, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5-HT2A_receptor">5-HT2A</a> binding and expression, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serotonin_transporter">5-HT transporter</a> binding sites and expression. These findings have
been shown to be reversible with estrogen replacement therapy.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This process involves several steps: First, researchers remove the ovaries from female rats, and then divide them into two groups – one receiving estrogen treatment and the other serving as a control. Next, finely sliced brain samples are taken from both groups and exposed to a radioactive ligand, which binds to the receptor of interest. Finally, these radioactive samples are used to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoradiograph">create images on radiosensitive film</a>, which is then developed and analysed.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>This is not the kind of procedure we generally perform on humans. Additionally, these preclinical rat model studies concern ovarectomized female rats and are intended to inform treatment programmes for postmenopausal human women – so their relevance to humans starting from an androgenic baseline is possibly somewhat limited. Still, there’s a <a href="https://academic.oup.com/endo/article-abstract/131/2/662/2496261">couple</a> <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/096007609500075B">of</a> these studies I’d like to highlight, which found estrogen caused:</p>

<p>Alright, so what are these <em>NMDA</em> and <em>5-HT2A</em> receptors responsible for? These are glutamate and serotonin receptors, respectively – and these are also the specific receptors that are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_antagonist"><em>antagonised</em></a> by <a href="https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Ketamine">ketamine</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agonist"><em>agonised</em></a> by most <a href="https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonergic_psychedelic">serotonergic psychedelics</a>. If recreational drugs targeting these receptors can engender euphoric subjective effects – what might estrogen be capable of?</p>

All this is to say that I think the basic science in your post is correct, but I am significantly skeptical that:

A. Potential neurological effects of increasing estrogen levels in normal healthy adults won’t tend to get buffered out by other regulatory systems, given that you're acting a couple steps upstream
B. We should typically expect to be able to generalize from AMABs to AFABs when it comes to this kind of thing.

<p>The subjective perceptual and psychological effects of estrogen are wide-ranging and subtle. I’ll start by discussing the more mundane sensory changes I experienced before moving on to those which might be more nebulous or ineffable.</p>
<!-- The big parts were that estrogen decreased autistic sensory sensitivities, decreased muscular tension and increased emotional fluidity. But I'll go through these in detail. -->
<h4 id="dosage"><a href="#dosage">Dosage</a></h4>
<p>At the time of writing, I’ve been on and off estrogen for a period of nearly three years. My initial dosage was one of the <em>100 µg/24 hr</em> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estradiol">estradiol</a> patches, but I doubled this after a short while. I have also tried <em>2 mg</em> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estradiol_valerate">estradiol valerate</a> pills, twice or three times daily – though this turned out to be too low, and I wound up switching back to patches. I have found using patches to result in the most striking and noticeable subjective effects. I have not yet tried injected estrogen, though I anticipate doing so before long.</p>
<!-- I did also take a [selective estrogen receptor modulator](https://transfemscience.org/articles/nonbinary-transfem-overview/#selective-estrogen-receptor-modulators-serms) because I wish to attenuate breast growth – *60 mg* [raloxifene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raloxifene), once daily. This has worked to prevent development of breast tissue, but it has not prevented fat redistribution. It is hard to tell if this has any subjective effect. -->
<p>Additionally, at one point I tried taking a <em>300 mg</em> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progesterone">progesterone</a> suppository. This made me feel quite stupid the following day, so I did not try this again.</p>
<h3 id="gustatory-perception"><a href="#gustatory-perception">Gustatory perception</a></h3>
<p>I’ve long been in the bad habit of rolling out of bed and grabbing a Monster Zero straight from the fridge first thing in the morning, and I tend to follow this up with Diet Coke throughout the day. This means that I’m fairly attuned to the taste of artificial sweeteners, so naturally the change in taste perception was the first thing I noticed – within a day or two of first putting the patches on, I found that <em>sweet</em> things tasted <em>sweeter</em>; and <em>sour</em> things tasted both <em>sweeter</em> and more <em>metallic</em> – and the cinnamon taste in my standard reference Diet Coke really <em>shone through</em>.</p>
<p>This was rather exciting; I was not expecting to find that the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taste#Basic_tastes">primary tastes</a> were not in fact primal, but in fact could shift around inside a lower-dimensional <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latent_space">latent space</a>. This got me theorising – as I wrote <a href="https://smoothbrains.net/posts/2024-06-18-an-informal-review-of-anthropic-qualia-states.html#the-somatic-field">elsewhere</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Perhaps taste could be built out of something like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyad_(music)"><em>dyadic</em></a> vibrations, tuned by evolution towards <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consonance_and_dissonance">consonance or dissonance</a> in order to generate an attractive or aversive response in the organism?</p>
</blockquote>
<!-- What might "metallic" mean, here? Slapback reverb? -->
<h3 id="olfactory-perception"><a href="#olfactory-perception">Olfactory perception</a></h3>
<p>It took me a little while before I noticed any change to my sense of smell, but this was more a factor of encountering the relevant stimulus. It was boys. Boys smelt different.</p>
<p>Much earlier in life, I’d had to convince myself I was gay by using the fact that boys smelt <em>really good</em>. This was very much no longer the case, and I began to notice wide variation in the way boys smelt, which sometimes was really quite unpleasant – <em>oniony</em>, even.</p>

<!-- In return, the boys in my life took turns smelling my armpits; they all said I smelt great. -->
<!-- Estrogen is known to [upregulate 5-HT2A receptor expression in the olfactory cortex of rats](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7632610/). I was unable to find any similar information about the gustatory cortex. -->
<h3 id="somatic-perception"><a href="#somatic-perception">Somatic perception</a></h3>
<p>I have somatic sensory issues. Skin sensations have always been overwhelming – my mother will confirm that I would scream if she attempted to dress me in wool, and in adulthood I avoid buying clothing with sleeves. By default, my skin feels like a bag of white noise – and when things get bad it can feel like my whole body is covered with randomised pinprick sensations, like minuscule <a href="https://smoothbrains.net/posts/2024-03-01-5-meo-dmt.html">topological defects</a> in the <a href="https://smoothbrains.net/posts/2024-06-18-an-informal-review-of-anthropic-qualia-states.html#the-somatic-field">somatic field</a>.</p>
<p>This has interfered with my ability to experience intimacy; simply lying in bed with somebody could be a stressful time for me. Estrogen ramps all of this way down in intensity – it’s a tremendous relief.</p>
<p>Perhaps my cleaning habits can provide an objective measure. Because things like sweat on my skin or leftover food in my mouth constitute intolerable sensory distractions, I’d tend to shower up to four times a day and brush my teeth about as often – since starting estrogen, I’m much less neurotic about both of these things.</p>
<p>A less turbulent nervous system also seems to be less disruptive for sleep. Beforehand, I took it for granted that I would often wake up throughout the night in a state of discomfort, whereas while I am on estrogen I reliably wake up in the morning feeling well-rested.</p>
<h3 id="visual-perception"><a href="#visual-perception">Visual perception</a></h3>
<p>It’s fairly common to hear reports of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MtF/comments/xcr66g/color_on_estrogen/">colours becoming more intense after starting hormone replacement therapy</a>. I’m familiar with how <a href="https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Color_enhancement">serotonergic psychedelics can produce this effect</a>, but I can’t say I observed any such thing myself. What did change was my sense of <em>space</em>.</p>
<p>This one’s quite subtle – it was the kind of thing that was more noticeable when I experimented with deliberately spiking my hormones. I’ll do my best to explain. It’s as if I took the entire volumetric representation of the space around me and increased the degree to which every point within that could influence the location of every other point, recursively. This allows everything to elastically settle into a more harmonious equilibrium. This effect is basically identical to what a small dose of psychedelics can do, specifically a tryptamine like <a href="https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocybin_mushrooms">psilocybin</a> or <a href="https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DMT">DMT</a>.</p>

<p>It’s hard to say what the utility of this might be. The balance between entropy and harmony is an important one – too much entropy and it’s hard to tell signal from noise, and too much harmony and you might miss important details. I did feel that with a more parsimonious model of the space around me, I got better at driving – though my friends would say I got more <em>confident</em> at driving. Competence might be orthogonal to confidence, but I maintain that parallel parking is much easier now.</p>
<h3 id="motor-output"><a href="#motor-output">Motor output</a></h3>
<p>I ride my bicycle every morning – this is my primary meditative practice. I am also surrounded by steep hills, so I noticed within a couple of days that I could not activate my quads and hamstrings as hard as I was used to. This happened much faster than could possibly be accounted for by muscular atrophy, so I surmised that this must be a neuromuscular phenomenon. Later on I switched back to my own hormones for a short period, and once again the change was quite rapid. There was nothing quite like the rush of <em>powering</em> uphill once again.</p>
<p>Being less strong honestly sucked pretty bad, and this required some psychological adjustment. <!-- I learned that muscular strength is but one of many axes along which one can maximise one's agency. --> The flipside of this was that I found estrogen to be a <em>superb</em> muscle relaxant, and ultimately this made the effect a net positive.</p>
<p>Around the time I transitioned was also the period when I was exploring some quite extreme ketamine-assisted <a href="https://www.fasciaresearch.com/literature/sensory-innervation/InnervationExcerpt.pdf">myofascial release</a> techniques in order to shake off a lifetime’s worth of accumulated tension from things like bad ergonomics and social anxiety. I’d say estrogen has been partially instrumental in getting me from a place where I’m constantly attacking myself with a foam roller and massage gun just to feel comfortable in my own body – to one where massage is more of a light maintenance task, like a bird preening its feathers.</p>
<!-- It's a fair trade. I like being soft and pliable. -->

<h3 id="emotional-modulation"><a href="#emotional-modulation">Emotional modulation</a></h3>
<p>I have spent a big chunk of my life navigating chronic emotional disaffection – high school sucked, and later I had an acute week-long dissociative episode when I was twenty-one which I’m not sure I ever quite came back from. Suffice it to say I lived an emotionally stagnant existence for most of my twenties – so when the hormones opened things up, I got quite attached to my new feelings.</p>
<p>Funny things were <em>funnier</em> – I recall a moment about a week after I started the hormone treatment, when I laughed at something I saw on YouTube – the surge of joy was like an electric cauteriser through my breastbone. Music <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGWbIw8oK9I"><em>works</em></a> now. I can lean in to the sense of affection I feel towards my friends. I cry more frequently; but this is clearly critical for releasing tension that would otherwise remain below the surface.</p>
<p>There’s another side to all this. I have had to navigate a number of situations where I now found myself unable to dissociate from some issue in my life that had been bothering me – I <em>had</em> to do something. Often this felt destructive; in retrospect there’s things I could have handled with far more grace and care, but instead I chose to drive a bulldozer through them.</p>
<!-- when normally I'd weather emotionally turbulent events without too much fuss -->
<p>For better or worse, this is what the hormones can do. It’s a bit of an epistemic nightmare – do I take action to deal with the thing that’s bugging me, or would it be better to skip my hormones for a day or two and see if I consider things differently? I can only recommend entering into this groundless game of instrumental hormone manipulation if one is comfortable taking responsibility for epistemic frame-shifting.</p>
<h3 id="attentional-modulation"><a href="#attentional-modulation">Attentional modulation</a></h3>
<p>I’d engaged with a number of deliberate psychological interventions in the lead-up to coming out, with the general aim of managing my social self-awareness. I knew I needed the confidence. If I was to socially transition, I’d need to not get too overwhelmed or hung up on what other people thought of me.</p>
<p>Of these, the most effective was <a href="https://x.com/m_ashcroft">Michael Ashcroft</a>’s <a href="http://expandingawareness.org/">extremely straightforward course</a> on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Technique">Alexander Technique</a>. I wrote about this in my writeup on <a href="https://smoothbrains.net/posts/2023-10-28-attention-and-awareness.html">attention and awareness</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Here’s how I usually explain it to people: You have <em>awareness</em>, which corresponds to everything currently in your sensorium. Then you have <em>attention</em>, which is a subset of that – like the beam of a spotlight – and most importantly, you have <em>agency</em> over it, you can choose where to point it and how wide or narrow you would like it to be.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sometimes we might feel that our attention is involuntarily yanked around by invisible aversive forces that are seemingly beyond our control – for instance, I might find it challenging to make eye contact with people at a party, and spend the whole time with my attention collapsed and pointed at the floor.</p>
<p>I think what Alexander Technique does is <a href="https://x.com/m_ashcroft/status/1807008725548363845">teach mindfulness of this class of phenomena and how to <em>expand</em> attention out of them</a>. Prior to transition, I deliberately experimented with this form of attentional modulation – primarily in the kind of social setting that I would normally find overwhelming, but also just while riding my bicycle outside. I think this kind of practice has a lot of potential for helping undo the archetypal trauma-induced behavioural patterns displayed by socially anxious autistic people. Personally I found it to be remarkably effective, and after some months of this I felt that my anxiety disorder was mostly in remission.</p>
<p>So it was a humungous letdown when I found that all of this got <em>significantly harder</em> on estrogen. I cringed my way through social events, and returned to staring at the floor – but I didn’t let this stop me. I thought of it like Goku training in the <a href="https://dragonball.fandom.com/wiki/Gravity_Machine">one hundred times Earth gravity chamber</a>. I just learned it all again from scratch.</p>
<h2 id="how-does-estrogen-work"><a href="#how-does-estrogen-work">How does estrogen <em>work</em>?</a></h2>
<p>If someone feels that they’d rather have a feminine body, estrogen is going to satisfy this desire – <em>within reason</em>. This is obvious. I’m more interested in finer-grained, <em>bottom-up</em> rather than <em>top-down</em> sensory phenomena. What are the other reasons that estrogen might <em>feel good</em>? I’d like to propose a number of theories – I’ll try to order them from least speculative to most speculative.</p>
<p>What should my <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Null_hypothesis">null hypothesis</a> be? <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DrWillPowers/comments/fcxboa/the_story_of_how_i_screwed_up_a_dose_calculation/">Would estrogen make someone without gender dysphoria feel good too?</a> Is it just a miraculous coincidence that estrogen just so happens to fix other issues that tend to be correlated with gender dysphoria – or do people with gender dysphoria suffer from an innate neurochemical deficit which can be corrected by hormone therapy?</p>

<p>The phenomenology of depersonalisation-derealisation is notoriously difficult to describe, but Zinnia has written the single best description of it that I’ve ever read. From her blog post, <a href="https://zinniajones.medium.com/trip-report-lamotrigine-a-drug-to-treat-depersonalization-e8171e165813">Trip report: Lamotrigine, a drug to treat depersonalization</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There was no point where I didn’t feel somehow removed from the world around me – this disconcerting sensation was present from my earliest memories. As a child I just didn’t really see the point of practically anything I was doing, or that anyone else was doing; it held no real emotional resonance or meaning for me. Whatever interests I chose to pursue felt more like an obligatory way of filling time, not something that had any value or importance in its own right.</p>
<p>I always felt the lack of spontaneity characteristic of depersonalization disorder, and whenever I chose to say anything, it felt rehearsed and acted out as if I had to engage my every word and action manually. Most of the time I would choose to say nothing at all. My feelings seemed to be kept at a distance, happening as something separate from an interior “me” who didn’t truly experience these emotions and seemingly couldn’t be touched by them. I was painfully conscious of all of these things.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>She continues with a visual description which I found particularly fascinating:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In sufferers of depersonalization, symptoms can become more prominent in the form of sudden attacks – and it gets worse the more you keep thinking about it. Later that night, I step outside to get some air, and the thought enters my mind that the trees, cars, and houses on our street could just be particularly elaborate Lego pieces. The clouds in the night sky could easily pass for a simple rendering in Blender. Isn’t at least half of what we see practically a hallucination that’s filled in by our brain without us even noticing? If all these things were just renderings, it seems like it would be easy to take advantage of that.</p>
<p>I can almost envision everything on our street coming apart piece by piece like an exploded technical diagram. The asphalt, the curb, the patches of grass, all of them could just lift into the air and drift apart, nothing but thin surfaces, almost like abstractions or mere representations. If I were to take a shovel and start digging a hole in the road, it would just be an indentation in that surface, pushing it to extend a bit in one direction or another – but underneath it, nothing. The houses along the street are just outgrowths of the surface, a sort of puckering in it, like a ball on a rubber sheet to demonstrate how gravity is the curvature of spacetime.</p>

See also, her [comment on r/transgender](https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/7t1z1w/comment/dt9e6xx/):

> Depersonalization (unreality and "no-self" feelings) was a really prominent feature of my life before transitioning, and it was highly distressing. I felt like a robot, like all my expressed emotions and actions were running entirely on manual, and I just wished anything could make me stop feeling this way. HRT made it go away within a week or two, and I had no idea that could even happen – I thought that was just my "normal", and it turns out it wasn't (I didn't even know depersonalization was a thing until a few years ago, so I had no language to describe it). I've been so, so happy since then and I feel that was when my life really began. It turns out depersonalization is much more common among trans people than among cis people, and that it declines after transitioning, specifically after treatment with HRT.
>
> I don't know enough about the relevant chemistry to remark on how this might have worked for your friend, but ketamine does have a rapid antidepressant effect and has been used in trials for this purpose, so it's possible that's what they were experiencing. Lamotrigine (Lamictal) is an anticonvulsant that's something like the opposite of ketamine: it inhibits glutamate release whereas ketamine stimulates it, resulting in ketamine's dissociative and DP/DR effects. It specifically blunts many of ketamine's effects (e.g. ketamine as an anesthetic will not work in cases of lamotrigine overdose). Lamotrigine, in combination with an SSRI, is one of the very few (possibly the only) treatments that's been found to be mostly effective for depersonalization disorder – it seems to have an anti-dissociative effect.
>
> I got on lamotrigine a few weeks back because I was curious about this (I really can't recommend this, as it can have serious side effects). After I'd titrated up, I went off my hormones for about 11 days. Normally when this happens I have a really noticeable and unbearable return of my depersonalization within 3-4 days. This time I was easily able to hold out for a week or so. Somehow, I felt almost normal. Things didn't really feel quite the same, but overall it felt like my DP/DR was at a 4 when it would normally be a screaming 10. I had no sense of feeling robotic, lacking spontaneity, or having a compulsive inner-monologue "observer", or lacking in genuine emotions. But by the last day I was starting to have some cognitive fog and a sense of the world being nothing but some strange infinitesimally thin surface stretched over infinite hollowness. It made me pretty uneasy, so since then I've been back on my HRT and that's all gone away.

<p>When I read this, I could not help but think two things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Wow, <em>this sounds just like my life</em>.</li>
<li>Wow, <em>this sounds just like being on <a href="https://smoothbrains.net/posts/2023-08-01-ketamine.html">ketamine</a></em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>I related very strongly to both her description of feeling distanced from life – as well as her description of the <a href="https://smoothbrains.net/posts/2024-06-18-an-informal-review-of-anthropic-qualia-states.html#the-visual-field">visual field</a> being – as she has written <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/7t1z1w/comment/dt9e6xx/">elsewhere</a> – <em>nothing but some strange infinitesimally thin surface stretched over infinite hollowness</em>. Both of these effects increase when I experiment with ketamine, and I also notice that both of these effects reverse when I use estrogen. In particular, the way in which estrogen alters <a href="#attentional-modulation">attentional modulation</a> also seems responsible for an increase in <a href="https://slehar.wordpress.com/2014/09/12/amodal-perception/">amodal perception</a>, which in turn makes the visual field feel less <em>hollow</em> – though I don’t necessarily regard this as <em>desirable</em> or <em>undesirable</em>. It just is.</p>

<p>Right now I don’t have much to add beyond: <em>wow, I think this checks out</em>. The question remains – does estrogen correct some kind of underlying <em>NMDA receptor expression deficit</em>, which ultimately leads to the psychological problems correlated with gender dysphoria – and, how does this relate to gender dysphoria itself?</p>

<p>Much of my personal research simply consists of reading a large number of Reddit comments. As such, I sorely wish for there to exist an equivalent paper to the DMT phenomenology one, but which scrapes <a href="http://reddit.com/r/asktransgender/">transgender</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMtFHRT/">support</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TransDIY/">subreddits</a> for subjective reports instead. However, until such time as one exists, the reader may just have to take my word for it when I claim a particular effect of estrogen is “commonly reported”.</p>
<p>One effect “commonly reported” by people just starting estrogen is that <a href="https://www.reddit.com/search/?q=estrogen+color">colours appear more saturated</a>. From a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MtF/comments/1dxe691/comment/lc1eyab/">typical comment</a> on an <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MtF/">r/MtF</a> thread <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MtF/comments/1dxe691/anyone_on_hrt_do_any_of_yall_see_colors_more/">asking if anyone experiences colours more vibrantly</a>:</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Referring back to the DMT phenomenology paper, <em>vivid</em> or <em>hyperintense</em> colours were reported in 25.2% of experiences. Personally, I didn’t experience any shift in colour perception, but I did find the other <a href="#visual-perception">visual perception</a> changes I experienced to be distinctively <em>psychedelic</em> in nature – as I mentioned earlier, particularly reminiscent of a tryptamine like <a href="https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocybin_mushrooms">psilocybin</a> or <a href="https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DMT">DMT</a>.

<p>Estrogen is known to <em>upregulate 5-HT2A receptor expression</em>, which is of course the same serotonin receptor which is agonised by most <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychedelic_drug">serotonergic psychedelics</a>. It seems quite reasonable to me to assume that this is what’s responsible for the various reported sensory enhancements in addition to the <a href="#emotional-modulation">changes in mood</a>.</p>
<p>I now have an additional question. In addition to correcting some kind of <em>NMDA receptor expression deficit</em> inherent to the gender dysphoric neurotype, does estrogen also correct a <em>5-HT2A receptor expression deficit</em> – or does tripping on estrogen <em>just feel good</em>?</p>

    The neuroscientist [Robin Carhart-Harris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robin_Carhart-Harris) theorises that the serotonin system is responsible for managing ongoing stress – and that the *5-HT1A receptor* is responsible for a *passive coping* mechanism while the *5-HT2A receptor* is responsible for an *active coping* mechanism. For a discussion of this theory, please see my post, [5-MeO-DMT: A crash course in phenomenal field topology](/posts/2024-03-01-5-meo-dmt.html).

<p>As <a href="#motor-output">mentioned above</a>, I found estrogen to be an incredibly powerful muscle relaxant. Using the <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2016/09/12/its-bayes-all-the-way-up/">Bayesian brain</a> model to understand this, it seems as if my nervous system holds <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/w/priors"><em>priors</em></a> for how tense every muscle in my body should be in response to a given situation – and these priors are <em>relaxed</em> under the influence of estrogen.</p>
<p>I have to credit estrogen with helping fix a number of long-standing neck and upper back problems which I’ve been dealing with for most of my life. It’s sufficiently powerful that I am skeptical that I would have been able to fix these issues while I was on testosterone. Notably, these issues don’t return when I stop taking estrogen.</p>
<p>The effects feel more foundational than this, however; estrogen feels like it reshapes my body map itself, <a href="https://smoothbrains.net/posts/2024-05-29-what-is-a-bodymind-knot.html">smoothing out knots</a> – like an elastic membrane being tightened, or a soap bubble reaching equilibrium. I’ve seen it “commonly reported” that estrogen makes people feel <em>more embodied</em>, and I suspect that this is what people might tend to mean by that.</p>

<p>Could this be related to the serotonergic activity? Might the estrogen be unwinding a lifetime of accumulated neuromuscular trauma through a form of low-dose psychedelic therapy? I suspect this effect is also responsible for my <a href="#emotional-modulation">changes in mood</a> – do emotions resonate more freely through a more parsimonious bodymind?</p>
<h3 id="estrogen-downregulates-autistic-sensory-sensitivity-issues"><a href="#estrogen-downregulates-autistic-sensory-sensitivity-issues">Estrogen downregulates autistic sensory sensitivity issues</a></h3>
<p>There’s a <a href="http://x.com/johnsonmxe">Mike Johnson</a> post I relate to, proposing a novel theory about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autism">autistic spectrum disorders</a>. From <a href="https://opentheory.net/2023/05/autism-as-a-disorder-of-dimensionality/">Autism as a disorder of dimensionality</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Every circuit has its own <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hausdorff_dimension">natural density/dimensionality</a> it’s designed for, and my intuition is that organs closer to the brain are designed to have higher dimensionality. In some sense this makes them more capable of general processing, but also more prone to the particular deficits expressed in autism, with the brain as the apex of this hierarchy.</p>
<p>Over time, civilization has thrown humanity increasingly high-dimensional challenges, leading to evolution progressively ‘dialing the dimensionality knob up’ on our nervous systems. Perhaps we can view dysfunctional autists as those who overshot the human nervous system’s current ‘Goldilocks zone’ for dimensionality and have nervous systems dominated by static/turbulence as a result. There may be different ‘flavors’ of autism, depending on which brain regions and tissues have elevated dimensionality.</p>
</blockquote>
<!-- [Neuron Number and Size in Prefrontal Cortex of Children With Autism](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/1104609) (Courchesne et al., 2011) -->
<p>When I read this some years ago, I had something of an <em>I’m in this picture and I don’t like it</em> moment. I don’t know that his theory is necessarily true, but I certainly felt that my own sensorium was <em>dominated by static/turbulence</em>.</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://smoothbrains.net/images/random/estrogen/lain_static.gif">
<figcaption>
Static is used as a recurring motif in the anime <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_Experiments_Lain">Serial Experiments Lain</a>, in which it is strongly hinted that the protagonist experiences sensory sensitivities.
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>As <a href="#somatic-perception">mentioned above</a>, I found that estrogen toned down my ongoing somatic sensitivities to more manageable levels – and there’s a handful of trans women I’ve spoken to who agreed with me that it turned the static down.</p>
<p>Autism tends to be <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/74/ss/ss7402a1.htm">diagnosed more often in those assigned male at birth</a>, and there’s a fair amount of research into the <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/endocrinology/articles/10.3389/fendo.2024.1371148/full">links between hormone levels and neuroatypicality</a>. Some researchers have even <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5193073/#__ffn_sectitle">proposed estrogen as a therapeutic target</a> for autism spectrum disorders.</p>
<p>Additionally, as <a href="https://x.com/slatestarcodex">Scott Alexander</a> mentions in <a href="https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/why-do-transgender-people-report">Why Do Transgender People Report Hypermobile Joints?</a>, <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2016/11/the-link-between-autism-and-trans-identity/507509/"><em>people with autism are about 8x more likely to be gender divergent than the general population</em></a>. Certainly this fits popular stereotypes of trans women, at least in my corner of the internet. Scott speculates:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My guess is something like joint issues → poor proprioception → all sensory experience is noisy and confusing → the brain, which is embodied and spends most of its time trying to process sensory experience, learns a different reasoning style → different reasoning style is less context-dependent (producing symptoms of autism) → different reasoning style when trying to interpret bodily correlates of gender (eg sex hormones) → transgender.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Personally, I don’t have any joint issues, and I think that his theory of dyphoria could be simpler than this. Perhaps autistic sensory sensitivities mean that the brain is constanly dealing with having to reject overly noisy sensory input, leading to a stressed out, overly tense, disembodied nervous system – and this is what ultimately manifests as dysphoria? However, this would only explain <em>sensory dysphoria</em>, and not <em>gender dysphoria</em>.</p>
<p>I also find that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ketogenic_diet">ketogenic dieting</a> helps with my sensory issues – as well as <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/07/18/know-your-gabapentinoids/">gabapentinoids like phenibut and pregabalin</a> – presumably by <em>reducing glutamatergic signalling</em>. Occasional <a href="https://opentheory.net/2019/11/neural-annealing-toward-a-neural-theory-of-everything/">neural annealing</a> through mild doses of <a href="https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonergic_psychedelic">serotonergic psychedelics</a> is also quite helpful. It’s difficult to say whether it’s the glutamate or serotonin system which is the root cause, but perhaps estrogen is particularly effective because it delivers changes to both?</p>
<h3 id="estrogen-can-produce-a-psychological-shift-from-autistic-to-schizotypal"><a href="#estrogen-can-produce-a-psychological-shift-from-autistic-to-schizotypal">Estrogen can produce a psychological shift from autistic to schizotypal</a></h3>
<p>A couple of years ago <a href="https://x.com/ElytraMithra">Ely</a> recommended that I read the paper, <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/17456916221075252">Autistic-Like Traits and Positive Schizotypy as Diametric Specializations of the Predictive Mind</a> (Andersen, 2022). It turned out to be the most interesting paper I read while writing this post. The author proposes that the archetypal behavioural traits observed in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autism"><em>autism</em></a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schizotypy"><em>schizotypy</em></a> – like variation in attentional modulation, theory of mind, and exploratory behaviour – are downstream from a fundamental <em>oversensitivity</em> or <em>undersensitivity</em> to sensory <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/09/05/book-review-surfing-uncertainty/">prediction errors</a>, respectively:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It has previously been argued that autism-spectrum conditions can be understood as resulting from a predictive-processing mechanism in which an inflexibly high weight is given to sensory-prediction errors that results in overfitting their predictive models to the world. Deficits in executive functioning, theory of mind, and central coherence are all argued to flow naturally from this core underlying mechanism.</p>
<p>The diametric model of autism and psychosis suggests a simple extension of this hypothesis. If people on the autism spectrum give an inflexibly high weight to sensory input, could it be that people with a predisposition to psychosis (i.e., people high in <em>positive schizotypy</em>) give an inflexibly <em>low</em> weight to sensory input?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Andersen carefully describes the terms <em>autism</em> and <em>schizotypy</em> as he uses them in the paper, emphasizing that these categories should be viewed as flexible and not defined by dysfunction:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In this article I refer to this axis as the <em>autism-schizotypy continuum</em>. For convenience, I refer to people on either end of this continuum as being an “autistic type” or a “schizotype”, although it should be understood that there are no clear-cut “types” and that these differences are continuous rather than categorical.</p>
<p>According to these models, everyone falls somewhere on the autism–schizotypy continuum, and neither autistic-like traits nor positive schizotypy represent dysfunction. Instead, each side of the continuum is accompanied by its own set of cognitive-perceptual strengths and weaknesses. People high in autistic-like traits are detail-oriented, have a focused attentional style that allows them to ignore distractors, have some advantages in sensory-discrimination abilities, and have highly developed systemizing skills, allowing them to learn and use complicated rules-based systems.</p>
<p>People high in positive schizotypy tend to be imaginative and creative and have a more diffuse attentional style (compared with the average person) that allows them to switch their attention more easily. There is also some evidence that people high in positive schizotypy tend to direct their attention toward highly abstract, “big-picture” concerns rather than focusing on details.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Andersen proposes that in the case of schizotypy, lower sensitivity to prediction errors permits sensory input to flow further up the predictive processing hierarchy, which is what results in the observed behavioural traits:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In autism, inflexibly high precision weighting of sensory input means that prediction matching tends to take place at relatively low levels of the processing hierarchy. Inflexibly low precision weighting of sensory input with positive schizotypy would have the opposite effect. Because the schizotype is, on average, handling fewer sensory-prediction errors than the autistic type (because they pay attention only to the large errors and ignore the smaller ones), prediction errors will tend to propagate farther up the processing hierarchy, affecting values, goals, and beliefs at higher levels of abstraction.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At this stage, I had to ask myself if the hormone I’d been taking which seemed to reduce my symptoms of autism was doing so by reducing an inherent oversensitivity to prediction errors? If this was the case, might it also be pushing me further towards the other end of the <em>autism-schizotypy continuum</em>? What might that look like? The paper has this to say about schizotypal patterns of belief:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Although the autistic type may rely more on culturally inherited high-level belief systems, the schizotype’s proclivity for tinkering with high-level priors may lead to the construction of relatively idiosyncratic high-level belief systems. In our own culture, this could manifest as having odd or (seemingly) unlikely beliefs about high-level causes. This may include beliefs in the paranormal, idiosyncratic religious beliefs (e.g., being “spiritual but not religious”), or believing conspiracy theories, all of which are associated with positive schizotypy.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I’ll outline some of the psychological changes I’ve noticed in myself since starting estrogen. The term “schizo” is used very informally in today’s internet vernacular, making it difficult to discuss these concepts in a sensible manner – but if the reader is comfortable playing armchair psychologist, perhaps they can judge for themselves whether the following makes me more “schizo”:</p>
<ul>
<li>Increased predisposition towards <a href="https://www.cell.com/trends/cognitive-sciences/abstract/S1364-6613(23)00094-3"><em>associative thinking</em></a>. Activities like tarot are more appealing.</li>
<li>Increased predisposition towards <a href="https://x.com/cube_flipper/status/1757637512682692991"><em>magical thinking</em></a>, leading to some idiosyncratic worldviews. This can probably be gauged by the <a href="https://x.com/cube_flipper/status/1800179966992400775">nonsense I post on Twitter</a>.</li>
<li>Increased experience of <a href="https://meaningness.com/"><em>meaningness</em></a> in day-to-day life. <a href="#emotional-modulation">This felt really good</a>.</li>
<li>Increased <em>mentalising</em> of other people’s internal states, resulting in a mixture of higher empathy and higher social anxiety. I’m somewhat more neurotic about potential threats.</li>
<li>Decreased <a href="#somatic-perception"><em>sensory sensitivity</em></a>.</li>
<li>Decreased <a href="#attentional-modulation"><em>attentional diffusion</em></a>, contrary to what the paper predicts.</li>
<li>Decreased <em>systematising</em> and <em>attention to detail</em>, for instance with tedious matters like finances.</li>
</ul>

<p>Armchair diagnoses aside, I do wish to assert that these psychological changes are quite similar to the kind of psychological changes I tend to experience while on a mild dose of psychedelics. So far as the pharmacology goes, there is an argument to be made that psychedelics induce a temporary state of psychosis via 5-HT2A agonism. From <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0269881120959637">Pivotal mental states</a> (Brouwer and Carhart-Harris, 2021):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The psychotomimetic (psychosis-mimicking) effects of classic 5-HT2A receptor agonist psychedelics have been well documented. Importantly, psychedelics are felt to be useful models of <em>incipient</em> psychotic states that may be more likely to display psychedelic-like phenomena, such as changes in perception, cognition and ego functioning. Conversely, established psychotic disorders such as schizophrenia are more likely to feature characteristics of <em>rigid</em> cognition such as fixed delusions. Selective 5-HT2A receptor antagonism attenuates the main characteristic subjective effects of LSD, psilocybin and ayahuasca and the intensity of psychedelic states is reliably predicted by 5-HT2A receptor occupancy.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s important to note that the authors are specifically discussing <em>psychosis</em> rather than <em>schizotypy</em>, and I couldn’t find any evidence that <em>schizotypy</em> involves 5-HT2A receptor signalling. That said, given the two are related, and given that estrogen <em>upregulates 5-HT2A receptor expression</em>, could estrogen be responsible for increased positive schizotypy via a similar mechanism to psychedelics?</p>

<hr>

<p>I’d like to review what I’ve claimed so far:</p>
<ul>
<li>Estrogen <em>upregulates NMDA receptor expression</em>, which may result in:
<ul>
<li><a href="#estrogen-is-like-the-opposite-of-ketamine">Decreased depersonalisation and derealisation</a></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Estrogen <em>upregulates 5-HT2A receptor expression</em>, which may result in:
<ul>
<li><a href="#estrogen-is-like-being-on-a-mild-dose-of-psychedelics-all-the-time">Increased “psychedelic” phenomenology</a></li>
<li><a href="#estrogen-loosens-the-bodymind">Increased “bodymind” flexibility and sense of embodiment</a></li>

<li><a href="#estrogen-can-produce-a-psychological-shift-from-autistic-to-schizotypal">Increased schizotypal traits</a></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>First of all, I should note that I don’t expect these claims about estrogen phenomenology to generalise from trans women to cis women, and I’d also be cautious about generalizing neuroendocrinological findings from postmenopausal women to people starting from an androgenic baseline. <!-- Additionally, the neurological effects I've described may be buffered by other regulatory systems, given that estrogen acts several steps upstream in complex biological pathways. --> All this aside, I think this should be mostly sufficient to explain why estrogen might make somebody <em>feel good</em>, especially if they are predisposed to depersonalisation, disembodiment, or autistic sensory sensitivities. However, I don’t think we’re that much closer to understanding whether hormone replacement therapy is actually correcting some kind of <em>innate deficit</em>.</p>
<p>Innateness of gender identity is a difficult topic to discuss. Here we are in 2025, and different political factions are motivated to claim that <em>gender dysphoria</em> is either a <a href="https://genderdysphoria.fyi/en/causes"><em>genuine phenomenon</em></a> or <a href="https://x.com/cube_flipper/status/1909409074619543977"><em>just a delusion</em></a>. Theories abound, and one of the more colourful – and <em>confronting</em> – treatments of the topic was written by <a href="https://sinceriously.blog-mirror.com/">Ziz</a>… <a href="https://x.com/kenthecowboy_/status/1884393311827550716">who is currently in jail</a>. From <a href="https://sinceriously.blog-mirror.com/intersex-brains-and-conceptual-warfare/">Intersex Brains And Conceptual Warfare</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The simplest explanation which fits the data (including nonbrain intersex conditions) is that sexual differentiation is a fragile rube goldberg machine, prone to random breakage. I speculate that humans have intersex brains so often because of evolution pulling out all stops for large brains and breaking things as a side effect.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Any honest public appraisal of the topic is likely to be clouded by politics, and given the current political climate, it seems unlikely that research may continue. Which is a shame, because I suspect research into <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-72486-6">prenatal hormone exposure</a>, <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34030966/">neuroanatomical variation</a>, and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DrWillPowers/wiki/meyer-powers_syndrome_faq/">atypical endocrine signalling</a> are promising avenues of exploration.</p>
<p>While I don’t think people should have to convince the medical system of the validity of their internal experience in order to justify a hormone prescription – other people <em>do</em>, and I don’t think this is likely to change anytime soon. So I think this research is <em>important</em> – not least because this is an issue that directly affects an unusually productive and talented segment of society, many of whom I consider my friends.</p>

<h3 id="phenomenology-of-gender-dysphoria"><a href="#phenomenology-of-gender-dysphoria">Phenomenology of gender dysphoria</a></h3>
<p>Here’s how I’d like to thread the needle. Gender dysphoria occupies an unusual epistemic status within a society not known for <a href="https://cosmicindigestion.substack.com/p/around-here-we-take-our-phenomenology">taking phenomenology seriously</a>, because – at least in liberal spaces – people’s self reports are generally never questioned.</p>
<p>I’m not complaining – I don’t think this is a bad thing, even though I can be picky with my metaepistemics sometimes. What I would like to see is further development into phenomenological models of gender dysphoria. <a href="https://genderdysphoria.fyi/">Existing models</a> are already quite comprehensive, covering phenomena from high-level <a href="https://genderdysphoria.fyi/en/social-dysphoria"><em>social dysphoria</em></a> to low-level <a href="https://genderdysphoria.fyi/en/physical-dysphoria"><em>physical dysphoria</em></a> – but I think they could utilise <em>even more</em> detail, as it may provide essential clues to what’s going on.</p>

<p>The low-level phenomenology of <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2013/02/18/typical-mind-and-gender-identity/">brain-body map mismatches</a> seems like a big part of the puzzle. There’s an old friend of mine, a loud-mouthed transman with a thick Queensland accent who swears up and down that he’s got a <em>fuckin’ ghost cock, mate</em>. Certainly the prevalence of phantom penises is <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/348950276_Phantom_Penis_Extrapolating_Neuroscience_and_Employing_Imagination_for_Trans_Male_Sexual_Embodiment">well-documented in the literature</a>. What’s going on there? My understanding of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cortical_homunculus">somatosensory homunculus</a> is that it can be quite <a href="https://smoothbrains.net/posts/2023-06-30-the-oral-tesseract.html">flexible with its representations</a>, so why might it persistently render a body corresponding to the opposite gender?</p>
<p>This wouldn’t be a <a href="https://smoothbrains.net/">smoothbrains.net</a> post if it didn’t have some nonsensical spitballing at the end. My usual psychedelic research requires me to entertain all kinds of metaphysical schizotheories – so I’m not averse to considering all kinds of theories of gender dysphoria, including ones incorporating <!-- [*body schemas*](https://x.com/cube_flipper/status/1702351420475990020) --> <a href="https://x.com/cube_flipper/status/1671342436294221826"><em>morphogenetic fields</em></a>, <a href="https://smoothbrains.net/posts/2024-05-29-what-is-a-bodymind-knot.html"><em>bodymind knots</em></a>, <a href="https://x.com/KanizsaBoundary/status/1809314763345908004"><em>past lives</em></a>, or even <a href="https://x.com/KanizsaBoundary/status/1808991203570209226"><em>vector field topology</em></a>.</p>
<p>Could it be the case that gender dysphoria is a morphic resonance phenomenon – and estrogen helps access the cosmic feminine unconscious by loading a different configuration file from the akashic records? <em>Who can say.</em> After all, if estrogen does make me more schizotypal… <em>why not lean into it</em>?</p>

		<p><em>This article was originally <a href="https://refactoring.fm/p/in-praise-of-normal-engineers">commissioned by Luca Rossi</a> (paywalled) for refactoring.fm, on February 11th, 2025. Luca edited a version of it that emphasized the importance of building “10x engineering teams” . It was later picked up by IEEE Spectrum (!!!), who scrapped most of the teams content and published a <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/10x-engineer">different, shorter piece</a> on March 13th.</em></p>
<p><em>This is my personal edit. It is not exactly identical to either of the versions that have been publicly released to date.

<p>Most of us have encountered a few engineers who seem practically magician-like, a class apart from the rest of us in their ability to reason about complex mental models, leap to non-obvious yet elegant solutions, or emit waves of high quality code at unreal velocity.<img data-recalc-dims="1" decoding="async" data-attachment-id="10015" data-permalink="https://charity.wtf/2025/06/19/in-praise-of-normal-engineers/normal-praise-black-squish/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/charity.wtf/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/normal-praise-black-squish.png?fit=1024%2C1024&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="1024,1024" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="In Praise of “Normal” Engineers" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/charity.wtf/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/normal-praise-black-squish.png?fit=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/charity.wtf/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/normal-praise-black-squish.png?fit=660%2C660&amp;ssl=1" src="https://i0.wp.com/charity.wtf/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/normal-praise-black-squish.png?resize=174%2C174&amp;ssl=1" alt="In Praise of &quot;Normal&quot; Engineers" width="174" height="174" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/charity.wtf/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/normal-praise-black-squish.png?resize=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/charity.wtf/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/normal-praise-black-squish.png?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w, https://i0.wp.com/charity.wtf/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/normal-praise-black-squish.png?resize=768%2C768&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/charity.wtf/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/normal-praise-black-squish.png?w=1024&amp;ssl=1 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 174px) 100vw, 174px"></p>
<p>I have run into any number of these incredible beings over the course of my career. I think this is what explains the curious durability of the “10x engineer” meme. It may be based on flimsy, shoddy research, and the claims people have made to defend it have often been&nbsp;risible (e.g. “10x engineers have dark backgrounds, are rarely seen doing UI work, are poor mentors and interviewers”), or blatantly double down on stereotypes (“we look for young dudes in hoodies that remind us of Mark Zuckerberg”). But damn if it doesn’t resonate with experience. It just feels true.</p>
<p>The problem is not the idea that there are engineers who are 10x as productive as other engineers. I don’t have a problem with this statement; in fact, that much seems self-evidently true. The problems I do have are twofold.</p>
<h2>Measuring productivity is fraught and imperfect</h2>
<p>First: how are you measuring productivity? I have a problem with the implication that there is One True Metric of productivity that you can standardize and sort people by. Consider, for a moment, the sheer combinatorial magnitude of skills and experiences at play:</p>
<ul>
<li>Are you working on microprocessors, IoT, database internals, web services, user experience, mobile apps, consulting, embedded systems, cryptography, animation, training models for gen AI… what?</li>
<li>Are you using golang, python, COBOL, lisp, perl, React, or brainfuck? What version, which libraries, which frameworks, what data models? What other software and build dependencies must you have mastered?<img data-recalc-dims="1" decoding="async" data-attachment-id="10009" data-permalink="https://charity.wtf/2025/06/19/in-praise-of-normal-engineers/normal-rainbow-black/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/charity.wtf/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/normal-rainbow-black.png?fit=1024%2C1024&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="1024,1024" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="normal-rainbow-black" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/charity.wtf/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/normal-rainbow-black.png?fit=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/charity.wtf/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/normal-rainbow-black.png?fit=660%2C660&amp;ssl=1" src="https://i0.wp.com/charity.wtf/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/normal-rainbow-black.png?resize=173%2C173&amp;ssl=1" alt="" width="173" height="173" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/charity.wtf/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/normal-rainbow-black.png?resize=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/charity.wtf/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/normal-rainbow-black.png?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w, https://i0.wp.com/charity.wtf/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/normal-rainbow-black.png?resize=768%2C768&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/charity.wtf/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/normal-rainbow-black.png?w=1024&amp;ssl=1 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 173px) 100vw, 173px"></li>
<li>What adjacent skills, market segments, or product subject matter expertise are you drawing upon…design, security, compliance, data visualization, marketing, finance, etc?</li>
<li>What stage of development? What scale of usage? What matters most — giving good advice in a consultative capacity, prototyping rapidly to find product-market fit, or writing code that is maintainable and performant over many years of amortized maintenance? Or are you writing for the Mars Rover, or shrinkwrapped software you can never change?</li>
</ul>
<p>Also: people and their skills and abilities are not static. At one point, I was a pretty good DBRE (I even co-wrote the book on it). Maybe I was even a 10x DB engineer then, but certainly not now. I haven’t debugged a query plan in years.</p>
<p>“10x engineer” makes it sound like 10x productivity is an immutable characteristic of a person. But someone who is a 10x engineer in a particular skill set is still going to have infinitely more areas where they are normal or average (or less). I know a lot of world class engineers, but I’ve never met anyone who is 10x better than everyone else across the board, in every situation.</p>
<h2>Engineers don’t own software, teams own software</h2>
<p>Second, and even more importantly: So what? It doesn’t matter. Individual engineers don’t own software, teams own software. <strong>The smallest unit of software ownership and delivery is the engineering team</strong>. It doesn’t matter how fast an individual engineer can write software, what matters is how fast the team can collectively write, test, review, ship, maintain, refactor, extend, architect, and revise the software that they own.</p>
<p>Everyone uses the same software delivery pipeline. If it takes the slowest engineer at your company five hours to ship a single line of code, it’s going to take the fastest engineer at your company five hours to ship a single line of code. The time spent writing code is typically dwarfed by the time spent on every other part of the software development lifecycle.</p>
<p>If you have services or software components that are owned by a single engineer, that person is a single point of failure.<img data-recalc-dims="1" fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" data-attachment-id="10013" data-permalink="https://charity.wtf/2025/06/19/in-praise-of-normal-engineers/normal-spof/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/charity.wtf/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/normal-spof.png?fit=1024%2C1024&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="1024,1024" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="normal-spof" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/charity.wtf/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/normal-spof.png?fit=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/charity.wtf/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/normal-spof.png?fit=660%2C660&amp;ssl=1" src="https://i0.wp.com/charity.wtf/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/normal-spof.png?resize=226%2C226&amp;ssl=1" alt="" width="226" height="226" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/charity.wtf/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/normal-spof.png?resize=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/charity.wtf/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/normal-spof.png?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w, https://i0.wp.com/charity.wtf/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/normal-spof.png?resize=768%2C768&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/charity.wtf/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/normal-spof.png?w=1024&amp;ssl=1 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 226px) 100vw, 226px"></p>
<p>I’m not saying this should never happen. It’s quite normal at startups to have individuals owning software, because the biggest existential risk that you face is not moving fast enough, not finding product market fit, and going out of business. But as you start to grow up as a company, as users start to demand more from you, and you start planning for the survival of the company to extend years into the future…ownership needs to get handed over to a team. Individual engineers get sick, go on vacation, and leave the company, and the business has got to be resilient to that.</p>
<p>If teams own software, then the key job of any engineering leader is to craft high-performing engineering teams. If you must 10x something, 10x this. <strong>Build 10x engineering teams.</strong></p>
<h2>The best engineering orgs are the ones where normal engineers can do great work</h2>
<p>When people talk about world-class engineering orgs, they often have in mind teams that are top-heavy with staff and principal engineers, or recruiting heavily from the ranks of ex-FAANG employees or top universities.</p>
<p>But I would argue that a truly great engineering org is one where you don’t HAVE to be one of the “best” or most pedigreed engineers in the world to get shit done and have a lot of impact on the business.</p>
<p>I think it’s actually the other way around. A truly great engineering organization is one where perfectly normal, workaday software engineers, with decent software engineering skills and an ordinary amount of expertise, can consistently move fast, ship code, respond to users, understand the systems they’ve built, and move the business forward a little bit more, day by day, week by week.</p>
<p>Any asshole can build an org where the most experienced, brilliant engineers in the world can build product and make progress. That is not hard. And putting all the spotlight on individual ability has a way of letting your leaders off the hook for doing their jobs. It is a HUGE competitive advantage if you can build sociotechnical systems where less experienced engineers can convert their effort and energy into product and business momentum.</p>
<p>A truly great engineering org also happens to be one that mints world-class software engineers. But we’re getting ahead of ourselves, here.</p>
<h2>Let’s talk about “normal” for a moment</h2>
<p>A lot of technical people got really attached to our identities as smart kids. The software industry tends to reflect and reinforce this preoccupation at every turn, from Netflix’s “we look for the top 10% of global talent” to Amazon’s talk about “bar-raising” or Coinbase’s recent claim to “hire the top .1%”. (Seriously, guys? Ok, well, Honeycomb is going to hire only the top <em>.00001%</em>!)</p>
<p>In this essay, I would like to challenge us to set that baggage to the side and think about ourselves as <em>normal people</em>.</p>
<p>It can be humbling to think of ourselves as normal people, but most of us are in fact pretty normal people (albeit with many years of highly specialized practice and experience), and<img data-recalc-dims="1" loading="lazy" decoding="async" data-attachment-id="10011" data-permalink="https://charity.wtf/2025/06/19/in-praise-of-normal-engineers/normal-made-not-born/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/charity.wtf/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/normal-made-not-born.png?fit=1024%2C1024&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="1024,1024" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="normal-made-not-born" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/charity.wtf/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/normal-made-not-born.png?fit=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/charity.wtf/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/normal-made-not-born.png?fit=660%2C660&amp;ssl=1" src="https://i0.wp.com/charity.wtf/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/normal-made-not-born.png?resize=264%2C264&amp;ssl=1" alt="" width="264" height="264" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/charity.wtf/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/normal-made-not-born.png?resize=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/charity.wtf/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/normal-made-not-born.png?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w, https://i0.wp.com/charity.wtf/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/normal-made-not-born.png?resize=768%2C768&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/charity.wtf/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/normal-made-not-born.png?w=1024&amp;ssl=1 1024w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 264px) 100vw, 264px"> there is <em>nothing wrong with that</em>. Even those of us who are certified geniuses on certain criteria are likely quite normal in other ways — kinesthetic, emotional, spatial, musical, linguistic, etc.</p>
<p>Software engineering both selects for and develops certain types of intelligence, particularly around abstract reasoning, but <em>nobody</em> is born a great software engineer. <strong>Great engineers are made, not born</strong>. I just don’t think there’s a lot more we can get out of thinking of ourselves as a special class of people, compared to the value we can derive from thinking of ourselves collectively as relatively normal people who have practiced a fairly niche craft for a very long time.</p>
<h2>Build sociotechnical systems with “normal people” in mind</h2>
<p>When it comes to hiring talent and building teams, yes, absolutely, we should focus on identifying the ways people are exceptional and talented and strong. But when it comes to building sociotechnical systems for software delivery, we should focus on all the ways people are <em>normal</em>.</p>

<p>Normal people have cognitive biases — confirmation bias, recency bias, hindsight bias. We work hard, we care, and we do our best; but we also forget things, get impatient, and zone out. Our eyes are inexorably drawn to the color red (unless we are colorblind). We develop habits and ways of doing things, and resist changing them. When we see the same text block repeatedly, we stop reading it.</p>
<p>We are embodied beings who can get overwhelmed and fatigued. If an alert wakes us up at 3 am, we are much more likely to make mistakes while responding to that alert than if we tried to do the same thing at 3pm. Our emotional state can affect the quality of our work. Our relationships impact our ability to get shit done.</p>
<p>When your systems are designed to be used by normal engineers, all that excess brilliance they have can get poured into the product itself, instead of wasting it on navigating the system itself.</p>
<h2>How do you turn normal engineers into 10x engineering teams?</h2>
<p>None of this should be terribly surprising; it’s all well known wisdom. In order to build the kind of sociotechnical systems for software delivery that enable normal engineers to move fast, learn continuously, and deliver great results as a team, you should:</p>
<h4>Shrink the interval between when you write the code and when the code goes live.</h4>
<p>Make it as short as possible; the shorter the better. I’ve written and given talks about this many, many times. The shorter the interval, the lower the cognitive carrying costs. The faster you can iterate, the better. The more of your brain can go into the product instead of the process of building it.</p>
<p>One of the most powerful things you can do is have a short, fast enough deploy cycle that you can ship one commit per deploy. I’ve referred to this as the “software engineering death spiral” … when the deploy cycle takes so long that you end up batching together a bunch of engineers’ diffs in every build. The slower it gets, the more you batch up, and the harder it becomes to figure out what happened or roll back. The longer it takes, the more people you need, the higher the coordination costs, and the more slowly everyone moves.</p>
<p>Deploy time is the feedback loop at the heart of the development process. It is almost impossible to overstate the centrality of keeping this short and tight.</p>
<h4>Make it easy and fast to roll back or recover from mistakes.</h4>
<p>Developers should be able to deploy their own code, figure out if it’s working as intended or not, and if not, roll forward or back swiftly and easily. No muss, no fuss, no thinking involved.</p>
<h4>Make it easy to do the right thing and hard to do the wrong thing. <img data-recalc-dims="1" loading="lazy" decoding="async" data-attachment-id="10018" data-permalink="https://charity.wtf/2025/06/19/in-praise-of-normal-engineers/normal-sparkles/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/charity.wtf/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/normal-sparkles.png?fit=1024%2C1024&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="1024,1024" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="normal-sparkles" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/charity.wtf/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/normal-sparkles.png?fit=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/charity.wtf/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/normal-sparkles.png?fit=660%2C660&amp;ssl=1" src="https://i0.wp.com/charity.wtf/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/normal-sparkles.png?resize=137%2C137&amp;ssl=1" alt="" width="137" height="137" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/charity.wtf/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/normal-sparkles.png?resize=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/charity.wtf/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/normal-sparkles.png?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w, https://i0.wp.com/charity.wtf/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/normal-sparkles.png?resize=768%2C768&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/charity.wtf/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/normal-sparkles.png?w=1024&amp;ssl=1 1024w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 137px) 100vw, 137px"></h4>
<p>Wrap designers and design thinking into all the touch points your engineers have with production systems. Use your platform engineering team to think about how to empower people to swiftly make changes and self-serve, but also remember that a lot of times people will be engaging with production late at night or when they’re very stressed, tired, and&nbsp;possibly freaking out. Build guard rails. The fastest way to ship a single line of code should also be the easiest way to ship a single line of code.</p>
<h4>Invest in instrumentation and observability.</h4>
<p>You’ll never know — not really — what the code you wrote does just by reading it. The only way to be sure is by instrumenting your code and watching real users run it in production. Good, friendly sociotechnical systems invest <em>heavily</em> in tools for sense-making.</p>
<p>Being able to visualize your work is what makes engineering abstractions accessible to actual engineers. You shouldn’t have to be a world-class engineer just to debug your own damn code.</p>
<h4>Devote engineering cycles to internal tooling and enablement.</h4>
<p>If fast, safe deploys, with guard rails, instrumentation, and highly parallelized test suites are “everybody’s job”, they will end up nobody’s job. Engineering productivity isn’t something you can outsource. Managing the interfaces between your software vendors and your own teams is both a science and an art. Making it look easy and intuitive is really hard. It needs an owner.</p>
<h4>Build an inclusive culture.</h4>
<p>Growth is the norm, growth is the baseline. People do their best work when they feel a sense of belonging. An inclusive culture is one where everyone feels safe to ask questions, explore, and make mistakes; where everyone is held to the same high standard, and given the support and encouragement they need to achieve their goals.</p>
<h4>Diverse teams are resilient teams.<img data-recalc-dims="1" loading="lazy" decoding="async" data-attachment-id="10017" data-permalink="https://charity.wtf/2025/06/19/in-praise-of-normal-engineers/normal-transp-rainbow/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/charity.wtf/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/normal-transp-rainbow.png?fit=1024%2C1024&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="1024,1024" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="normal-transp-rainbow" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/charity.wtf/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/normal-transp-rainbow.png?fit=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/charity.wtf/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/normal-transp-rainbow.png?fit=660%2C660&amp;ssl=1" src="https://i0.wp.com/charity.wtf/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/normal-transp-rainbow.png?resize=196%2C196&amp;ssl=1" alt="" width="196" height="196" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/charity.wtf/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/normal-transp-rainbow.png?resize=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/charity.wtf/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/normal-transp-rainbow.png?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w, https://i0.wp.com/charity.wtf/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/normal-transp-rainbow.png?resize=768%2C768&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/charity.wtf/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/normal-transp-rainbow.png?w=1024&amp;ssl=1 1024w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 196px) 100vw, 196px"></h4>
<p>Yeah, a team of super-senior engineers who all share a similar background can move incredibly fast, but a monoculture is fragile. Someone gets sick, someone gets pregnant, you start to grow and you need to integrate people from other backgrounds and the whole team can get derailed — fast.</p>
<p>When your teams are used to operating with a mix of genders, racial backgrounds, identities, age ranges, family statuses, geographical locations, skill sets, etc — when this is just table stakes, standard operating procedure — you’re better equipped to roll with it when life happens.</p>
<h4>Assemble engineering teams from a range of levels.</h4>
<p>The best engineering teams aren’t top-heavy with staff engineers and principal engineers. The best engineering teams are ones where nobody is running on autopilot, banging out a login page for the 300th time; everyone is working on something that challenges them and pushes their boundaries. Everyone is learning, everyone is teaching, everyone is pushing their own boundaries and growing. All the time.</p>
<p>By the way — all of that work you put into making your systems resilient, well-designed, and humane is the same work you would need to do to help onboard new engineers, develop junior talent, or let engineers move between teams.</p>
<p>It gets used and reused. Over and over and over again.</p>
<h2>The only meaningful measure of productivity is impact to the business</h2>
<p>The only thing that actually matters when it comes to engineering productivity is whether or not you are moving the business materially forward.</p>
<p>Which means…we can’t do this in a vacuum. The most important question is whether or not we are working on the right thing, which is a problem engineering can’t answer without help from product, design, and the rest of the business.</p>
<p>Software engineering isn’t about writing lots of lines of code, it’s about solving business problems using technology.</p>
<p>Senior and intermediate engineers are actually the workhorses of the industry. They move the business forward, step by step, day by day. They get to put their heads down and crank instead of constantly looking around the org and solving coordination problems. If you have to be a staff+ engineer to move the product forward, something is seriously wrong.</p>
<h2>Great engineering orgs mint world-class engineers</h2>
<p>A great engineering org is one where you don’t HAVE to be one of the best engineers in the world to have a lot of impact. But — rather ironically — great engineering orgs mint world class engineers like nobody’s business.</p>
<p>The best engineering orgs are not the ones with the smartest, most experienced people in the world, they’re the ones where normal software engineers can consistently make progress, deliver value to users, and move the business forward, day after day.<img data-recalc-dims="1" loading="lazy" decoding="async" data-attachment-id="10019" data-permalink="https://charity.wtf/2025/06/19/in-praise-of-normal-engineers/normal-system-does/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/charity.wtf/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/normal-system-does.png?fit=1024%2C1024&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="1024,1024" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="normal-system-does" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/charity.wtf/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/normal-system-does.png?fit=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/charity.wtf/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/normal-system-does.png?fit=660%2C660&amp;ssl=1" src="https://i0.wp.com/charity.wtf/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/normal-system-does.png?resize=253%2C253&amp;ssl=1" alt="" width="253" height="253" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/charity.wtf/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/normal-system-does.png?resize=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/charity.wtf/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/normal-system-does.png?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w, https://i0.wp.com/charity.wtf/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/normal-system-does.png?resize=768%2C768&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/charity.wtf/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/normal-system-does.png?w=1024&amp;ssl=1 1024w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 253px) 100vw, 253px"></p>
<p>Places where engineers can get shit done and have a lot of impact are a magnet for top performers. Nothing makes engineers happier than building things, solving problems, making progress.</p>
<p>If you’re lucky enough to have world-class engineers in your org, good for you! Your role as a leader is to leverage their brilliance for the good of your customers and your other engineers, without coming to depend on their brilliance. After all, these people don’t belong to you. They may walk out the door at any moment, and that has to be okay.</p>
<p>These people can be phenomenal assets, assuming they can be team players and keep their egos in check. Which is probably why so many tech companies seem to obsess over identifying and hiring them, especially in Silicon Valley.</p>
<p>But companies categorically overindex on finding these people after they’ve already been minted, which ends up reinforcing and replicating all the prejudices and inequities of the world at large. Talent may be evenly distributed across populations, but opportunity is not.</p>
<h2>Don’t hire the “best” people. Hire the right people.</h2>
<p>We (by which I mean the entire human race) place too much emphasis on individual agency and characteristics, and not enough on the systems that shape us and inform our behaviors.</p>
<p>I feel like a whole slew of issues (candidates self-selecting out of the interview process, diversity of applicants, etc) would be improved simply by shifting the focus on engineering hiring and interviewing away from this inordinate emphasis on hiring the BEST PEOPLE and realigning around the more reasonable and accurate RIGHT PEOPLE. <img data-recalc-dims="1" loading="lazy" decoding="async" data-attachment-id="10023" data-permalink="https://charity.wtf/2025/06/19/in-praise-of-normal-engineers/normal-hire/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/charity.wtf/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/normal-hire.png?fit=1024%2C1024&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="1024,1024" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="normal-hire" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/charity.wtf/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/normal-hire.png?fit=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/charity.wtf/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/normal-hire.png?fit=660%2C660&amp;ssl=1" src="https://i0.wp.com/charity.wtf/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/normal-hire.png?resize=182%2C182&amp;ssl=1" alt="" width="182" height="182" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/charity.wtf/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/normal-hire.png?resize=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/charity.wtf/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/normal-hire.png?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w, https://i0.wp.com/charity.wtf/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/normal-hire.png?resize=768%2C768&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/charity.wtf/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/normal-hire.png?w=1024&amp;ssl=1 1024w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 182px) 100vw, 182px"></p>
<p>It’s a competitive advantage to build an environment where people can be hired for their unique strengths, not their lack of weaknesses; where the emphasis is on composing teams rather than hiring the BEST people; where inclusivity is a given both for ethical reasons and&nbsp;because it raises the bar for performance for everyone. Inclusive culture is what actual meritocracy depends on.</p>
<p>This is the kind of place that engineering talent (and good humans) are drawn to like a moth to a flame. <strong>It feels good to ship</strong>. It feels <em>good</em> to move the business forward. It feels <em>good</em> to sharpen your skills and improve your craft. It’s the kind of place that people go when they want to become world class engineers. And it’s the kind of place where world class engineers want to stick around, to train up the next generation.</p>

<article>
    

    
    <div>
            <p>Around 2012-2013 I started to hear a <em>lot</em> in the sysadmin community about a technology called "Borg". It was (apparently) some sort of Linux container system inside of Google that ran all of their stuff. The terminology was a bit baffling, with something called a "Borglet" inside of clusters with "cells" but the basics started to leak. There was a concept of "services" and a concept of "jobs", where applications could use services to respond to user requests and then jobs to complete batch jobs that ran for much longer periods of time. </p><p>Then on June 7th, 2014, we got our first commit of Kubernetes. The Greek word for 'helmsman' that absolutely no one could pronounce correctly for the first three years. (Is it koo-ber-NET-ees? koo-ber-NEET-ees? Just give up and call it k8s like the rest of us.) </p><p>Microsoft, RedHat, IBM, Docker join the Kubernetes community pretty quickly after this, which raised Kubernetes from an interesting Google thing to "maybe this is a real product?" On July 21st 2015 we got the v1.0 release as well as the creation of the CNCF. </p><p>In the ten years since that initial commit, Kubernetes has become a large part of my professional life. I use it at home, at work, on side projects—anywhere it makes sense. It's a tool with a steep learning curve, but it's also a massive force multiplier. We no longer "manage infrastructure" at the server level; everything is declarative, scalable, recoverable and (if you’re lucky) self-healing.</p><p>But the journey hasn't been without problems. Some common trends have emerged, where mistakes or misconfiguration arise from where Kubernetes isn't opinionated enough. Even ten years on, we're still seeing a lot of churn inside of ecosystem and people stepping on well-documented landmines. So, knowing what we know now, what could we do differently to make this great tool even more applicable to more people and problems? </p><h3 id="what-did-k8s-get-right">What did k8s get right?</h3><p>Let's start with the positive stuff. Why are we still talking about this platform now? </p><p><strong>Containers at scale</strong></p><p>Containers as a tool for software development make perfect sense. Ditch the confusion of individual laptop configuration and have one standard, disposable concept that works across the entire stack. While tools like Docker Compose allowed for some deployments of containers, they were clunky and still required you as the admin to manage a lot of the steps. I set up a Compose stack with a deployment script that would remove the instance from the load balancer, pull the new containers, make sure they started and then re-added it to the LB, as did lots of folks. </p><p>K8s allowed for this concept to scale out, meaning it was possible to take a container from your laptop and deploy an identical container across thousands of servers. This flexibility allowed organizations to revisit their entire design strategy, dropping monoliths and adopting more flexible (and often more complicated) micro-service designs. </p><p><strong>Low-Maintenance</strong></p><p>If you think of the history of Operations as a sort of "naming timeline from pets to cattle", we started with what I affectionately call the "Simpsons" era. Servers were bare metal boxes set up by teams, they often had one-off names that became slang inside of teams and everything was a snowflake. The longer a server ran, the more cruft it picked up until it became a scary operation to even reboot them, much less attempt to rebuild them. I call it the "Simpsons" era because among the jobs I was working at the time, naming them after Simpsons characters was surprisingly common. Nothing fixed itself, everything was a manual operation. </p><p>Then we transition into the "01 Era". Tools like Puppet and Ansible have become common place, servers are more disposable and you start to see things like bastion hosts and other access control systems become the norm. Servers aren't all facing the internet, they're behind a load balancer and we've dropped the cute names for stuff like "app01" or "vpn02". Organizations designed it so they could lose some of their servers some of the time. However failures still weren't self-healing, someone still had to SSH in to see what broke, write up a fix in the tooling and then deploy it across the entire fleet. OS upgrades were still complicated affairs. </p><p>We're now in the "UUID Era". Servers exist to run containers, they are entirely disposable concepts. Nobody cares about how long a particular version of the OS is supported for, you just bake a new AMI and replace the entire machine. K8s wasn't the only technology enabling this, but it was the one that accelerated it. Now the idea of a bastion server with SSH keys that I go to the underlying server to fix problems is seen as more of a "break-glass" solution. Almost all solutions are "destroy that Node, let k8s reorganize things as needed, make a new Node". </p><p>A lot of the Linux skills that were critical to my career are largely nice to have now, not need to have. You can be happy or sad about that, I certainly switch between the two emotions on a regular basis, but it's just the truth. </p><p><strong>Running Jobs </strong></p><p>The k8s jobs system isn't perfect, but it's so much better than the "snowflake cron01 box" that was an extremely common sight at jobs for years. Running on a cron schedule or running from a message queue, it was now possible to reliably put jobs into a queue, have them get run, have them restart if they didn't work and then move on with your life. </p><p>Not only does this free up humans from a time-consuming and boring task, but it's also simply a more efficient use of resources. You are still spinning up a pod for every item in the queue, but your teams have a lot of flexibility inside of the "pod" concept for what they need to run and how they want to run it. This has really been a quality of life improvement for a lot of people, myself included, who just need to be able to easily background tasks and not think about them again. </p><p><strong>Service Discoverability and Load Balancing</strong></p><p>Hard-coded IP addresses that lived inside of applications as the template for where requests should be routed has been a curse following me around for years. If you were lucky, these dependencies weren't based on IP address but were actually DNS entries and you could change the thing behind the DNS entry without coordinating a deployment of a million applications. </p><p>K8s allowed for simple DNS names to call other services. It removed an entire category of errors and hassle and simplified the entire thing down. With the Service API you had a stable, long lived IP and hostname that you could just point things towards and not think about any of the underlying concepts. You even have concepts like ExternalName that allow you to treat external services like they're in the cluster. </p><h3 id="ditch-yaml-for-hcl">Ditch YAML for HCL</h3><p>YAML was appealing because it wasn't JSON or XML, which is like saying your new car is great because it's neither a horse nor a unicycle. It demos nicer for k8s, looks nicer sitting in a repo and has the <em>illusion</em> of being a simple file format. In reality. YAML is just too much for what we're trying to do with k8s and it's not a safe enough format. Indentation is error-prone, the files don't scale great (you really don't want a super long YAML file), debugging can be annoying. YAML has <em>so many</em> subtle behaviors outlined in its spec.</p><p>I still remember not believing what I was seeing the first time I saw the Norway Problem. For those lucky enough to not deal with it, the Norway Problem in YAML is when 'NO' gets interpreted as false. Imagine explaining to your Norwegian colleagues that their entire country evaluates to false in your configuration files. Add in accidental numbers from lack of quotes, the list goes on and on. There are much better posts on why YAML is crazy than I'm capable of writing: <a href="https://ruudvanasseldonk.com/2023/01/11/the-yaml-document-from-hell">https://ruudvanasseldonk.com/2023/01/11/the-yaml-document-from-hell</a></p><p><strong>Why HCL?</strong></p><p>HCL is already the format for Terraform, so at least we'd only have to hate one configuration language instead of two. It's strongly typed with explicit types. There's already good validation mechanisms. It is specifically designed to do the job that we are asking YAML to do and it's not much harder to read. It has built-in functions people are already using that would allow us to remove some of the third-party tooling from the YAML workflow. </p><p>I would wager 30% of Kubernetes clusters today are <em>already</em> being managed with HCL via Terraform. We don't need the Terraform part to get a lot of the benefits of a superior configuration language. </p><p>The only downsides are that HCL is slightly more verbose than YAML, and its Mozilla Public License 2.0 (MPL-2.0) would require careful legal review for integration into an Apache 2.0 project like Kubernetes. However, for the quality-of-life improvements it offers, these are hurdles worth clearing.</p><p><strong>Why HCL is better</strong></p><p>Let's take a simple YAML file. </p><pre><code># YAML doesn't enforce types
replicas: "3"  # String instead of integer
resources:
  limits:
    memory: 512  # Missing unit suffix
  requests:
    cpu: 0.5m    # Typo in CPU unit (should be 500m)</code></pre><p>Even in the most basic example, there are footguns everywhere. HCL and the type system would catch all of these problems. </p><pre><code>replicas = 3  # Explicitly an integer

resources {
  limits {
    memory = "512Mi"  # String for memory values
  }
  requests {
    cpu = 0.5  # Number for CPU values
  }
}</code></pre><p>Take a YAML file like this that you probably have 6000 in your k8s repo. Now look at HCL without needing external tooling. </p><pre><code># Need external tools or templating for dynamic values
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: app-config
data:
  # Can't easily generate or transform values
  DATABASE_URL: "postgres://user:password@db:5432/mydb"
  API_KEY: "static-key-value"
  TIMESTAMP: "2023-06-18T00:00:00Z"  # Hard-coded timestamp</code></pre><pre><code>resource "kubernetes_config_map" "app_config" {
  metadata {
    name = "app-config"
  }
  
  data = {
    DATABASE_URL = "postgres://${var.db_user}:${var.db_password}@${var.db_host}:${var.db_port}/${var.db_name}"
    API_KEY      = var.api_key != "" ? var.api_key : random_string.api_key.result
    TIMESTAMP    = timestamp()
  }
}

resource "random_string" "api_key" {
  length  = 32
  special = false
}</code></pre><p>Here's all the pros you get with this move. </p><ol><li><strong>Type Safety</strong>: Preventing type-related errors before deployment</li><li><strong>Variables and References</strong>: Reducing duplication and improving maintainability</li><li><strong>Functions and Expressions</strong>: Enabling dynamic configuration generation</li><li><strong>Conditional Logic</strong>: Supporting environment-specific configurations</li><li><strong>Loops and Iteration</strong>: Simplifying repetitive configurations</li><li><strong>Better Comments</strong>: Improving documentation and readability</li><li><strong>Error Handling</strong>: Making errors easier to identify and fix</li><li><strong>Modularity</strong>: Enabling reuse of configuration components</li><li><strong>Validation</strong>: Preventing invalid configurations</li><li><strong>Data Transformations</strong>: Supporting complex data manipulations<br></li></ol><h3 id="allow-etcd-swap-out">Allow etcd swap-out</h3><p>I know, I'm the 10,000 person to write this. Etcd has done a fine job, but it's a little crazy that it is the only tool for the job. For smaller clusters or smaller hardware configuration, it's a large use of resources in a cluster type where you will never hit the node count where it pays off. It's also a strange relationship between k8s and etcd now, where k8s is basically the only etcd customer left. </p><p>What I'm suggesting is taking the work of <a href="https://github.com/k3s-io/kine" rel="noreferrer">kine</a> and making it official. It makes sense for the long-term health of the project to have the ability to plug in more backends, adding this abstraction means it (should) be easier to swap in new/different backends in the future and it also allows for more specific tuning depending on the hardware I'm putting out there. </p><p>What I suspect this would end up looking like is much like this: <a href="https://github.com/canonical/k8s-dqlite">https://github.com/canonical/k8s-dqlite</a>. Distributed SQlite in-memory with Raft consensus and almost zero upgrade work required that would allow cluster operators to have more flexibility with the persistence layer of their k8s installations. If you have a conventional server setup in a datacenter and etcd resource usage is not a problem, great! But this allows for lower-end k8s to be a nicer experience and (hopefully) reduces dependence on the etcd project. </p><h3 id="beyond-helm-a-native-package-manager">Beyond Helm: A Native Package Manager</h3><p>Helm is a perfect example of a temporary hack that has grown to be a permanent dependency. I'm grateful to the maintainers of Helm for all of their hard work, growing what was originally a hackathon project into the de-facto way to install software into k8s clusters. It has done as good a job as something could in fulfilling that role without having a deeper integration into k8s. </p><p>All that said, Helm is a nightmare to use. The Go templates are tricky to debug, often containing complex logic that results in really confusing error scenarios. The error messages you get from those scenarios are often gibberish. Helm isn't a very good package system because it fails at some of the basic tasks you need a package system to do, which are transitive dependencies and resolving conflicts between dependencies. </p><p><strong>What do I mean?</strong></p><p>Tell me what this conditional logic is trying to do:</p><pre><code># A real-world example of complex conditional logic in Helm
{{- if or (and .Values.rbac.create .Values.serviceAccount.create) (and .Values.rbac.create (not .Values.serviceAccount.create) .Values.serviceAccount.name) }}
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRole
metadata:
  name: {{ template "myapp.fullname" . }}
  labels:
    {{- include "myapp.labels" . | nindent 4 }}
{{- end }}</code></pre><p>Or if I provide multiple values files to my chart, which one wins:</p><pre><code>helm install myapp ./mychart -f values-dev.yaml -f values-override.yaml --set service.type=NodePort</code></pre><p>Ok, what if I want to manage my application and all the application dependencies with a Helm chart. This makes sense, I have an application that itself has dependencies on other stuff so I want to put them all together. So I define my sub-charts or umbrella charts inside of my Chart.yaml. <br></p><pre><code>dependencies:
- name: nginx
  version: "1.2.3"
  repository: "&lt;https://example.com/charts&gt;"
- name: memcached
  version: "1.2.3"
  repository: "&lt;https://another.example.com/charts&gt;"
</code></pre><p>But assuming I have multiple applications, it's entirely possible that I have 2 services both with a dependency on nginx or whatever like this:<br></p><figure><img src="https://matduggan.com/content/images/2025/06/image-2.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="367" height="176"></figure><p>Helm doesn't handle this situation gracefully because template names are global with their templates loaded alphabetically. Basically you need to:</p><ul><li>Don't declare a dependency on the same chart more than once (hard to do for a lot of microservices)</li><li>If you do have the same chart declared multiple times, has to use the exact same version</li></ul><p>The list of issues goes on and on. </p><ul><li>Cross-Namespace installation stinks</li><li>Chart verification process is a pain and nobody uses it</li></ul><p>Let's just go to the front page of artifacthub:</p><figure><img src="https://matduggan.com/content/images/2025/06/image-3.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="978" height="794" srcset="https://matduggan.com/content/images/size/w600/2025/06/image-3.png 600w, https://matduggan.com/content/images/2025/06/image-3.png 978w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>I'll grab elasticsearch cause that seems important. </p><figure><img src="https://matduggan.com/content/images/2025/06/image-4.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="504" height="296"></figure><figure><img src="https://matduggan.com/content/images/2025/06/image-5.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="522" height="404"></figure><p>Seems <em>pretty bad</em> for the Official Elastic helm chart.

There isn't a way to make Helm good enough for the task of "package manager for all the critical infrastructure on the planet". </p><h4 id="what-would-a-k8s-package-system-look-like">What would a k8s package system look like?</h4><p>Let's call our hypothetical package system KubePkg, because if there's one thing the Kubernetes ecosystem needs, it's another abbreviated name with a 'K' in it. We would try to copy as much of the existing work inside the Linux ecosystem while taking advantage of the CRD power of k8s. My idea looks something like this:</p><figure><img src="https://matduggan.com/content/images/2025/06/image-8.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="600" height="356" srcset="https://matduggan.com/content/images/2025/06/image-8.png 600w"></figure><p>The packages are bundles like a Linux package:<br></p><figure><img src="https://matduggan.com/content/images/2025/06/image-9.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="528" height="196"></figure><p>There's a definition file that accounts for as many of the real scenarios that you actually encounter when installing a thing. </p><pre><code>apiVersion: kubepkg.io/v1

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="post-8908">
				
<p>A week ago I attended <a href="https://less.online/">LessOnline</a>, a rationalist blogging conference featuring many people I’ve known for years—Scott Alexander, Eliezer Yudkowsky, Zvi Mowshowitz, Sarah Constantin, Carl Feynman—as well as people I’ve known only online and was delighted to meet in person, like Joe Carlsmith and Jacob Falkovich and Daniel Reeves.  The conference was at <a href="https://www.lighthaven.space/">Lighthaven</a>, a bewildering maze of passageways, meeting-rooms, sleeping quarters, gardens, and vines off Telegraph Avenue in Berkeley, which has recently emerged as the nerd Shangri-La, or Galt’s Gulch, or Shire, or whatever.  I did two events at this year’s LessOnline: a conversation with Nate Soares about the <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/w/orthogonality-thesis">Orthogonality Thesis</a>, and an ask-me-anything session about quantum computing and theoretical computer science (no new ground there for regular consumers of my content).</p>



<p>What I’ll remember most from LessOnline is not the sessions, mine or others’, but the unending conversation among hundreds of people all over the grounds, which took place in parallel with the sessions and before and after them, from morning till night (and through the night, apparently, though I’ve gotten too old for that).  It felt like a single conversational archipelago, the largest in which I’ve ever taken part, and the conference’s real point.  (Attendees were exhorted, in the opening session, to skip as many sessions as possible in favor of intense small-group conversations—not only because it was better but also because the session rooms were too small.)</p>



<p>Within the conversational blob, just making my way from one building to another could take hours.  My mean free path was approximately five feet, before someone would notice my nametag and stop me with a question.  Here was my favorite opener:</p>



<p>“You’re Scott Aaronson?!  The quantum physicist who’s always getting into arguments on the Internet, and who’s essentially always right, but who sustains an unreasonable amount of psychic damage in the process?”</p>



<p>“Yes,” I replied, not bothering to correct the “physicist” part.</p>



<p>One night, I walked up to Scott Alexander, who sitting on the ground, with his large bald head and a blanket he was using as a robe, resembled a monk.  “Are you enjoying yourself?” he asked.</p>



<p>I replied, “you know, after all these years of being coy about it, I think I’m finally ready to become a Rationalist.  Is there, like, an initiation ritual or something?”</p>



<p>Scott said, “Oh, you were already initiated a decade ago; you just didn’t realize it at the time.”  Then he corrected himself: “two decades ago.”</p>



<p>The first thing I did, after coming out as a Rationalist, was to get into a heated argument with Other Scott A., Joe  Carlsmith, and other fellow-Rationalists about the ideas I set out twelve years ago in my <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/papers/giqtm3.pdf">Ghost in the Quantum Turing Machine</a> essay.  Briefly, my argument was that the irreversibility and ephemerality of biological life, which contrasts with the copyability, rewindability, etc. of programs running on digital computers, and which can ultimately be traced back to microscopic details of the universe’s initial state, subject to the No-Cloning Theorem of quantum mechanics, which then get chaotically amplified during brain activity … might be a clue to a deeper layer of the world, one that we understand about as well as the ancient Greeks understood Newtonian physics, but which is the layer where mysteries like free will and consciousness will ultimately need to be addressed.</p>



<p>I got into this argument partly because it came up, but partly also because this seemed like the biggest conflict between my beliefs and the consensus of my fellow Rationalists.  Maybe part of me wanted to demonstrate that my intellectual independence remained intact—sort of like a newspaper that gets bought out by a tycoon, and then immediately runs an investigation into the tycoon’s corruption, as well as his diaper fetish, just to prove it can.</p>



<p>The funny thing, though, is that all my beliefs are the same as they were before.  I’m still a computer scientist, an academic, a straight-ticket Democratic voter, a liberal Zionist, a Jew, etc. (all identities, incidentally, well-enough represented at LessOnline that I don’t even think I was the unique attendee in the intersection of them all).</p>



<p>Given how much I resonate with what the Rationalists are trying to do, why did it take me so long to identify as one?</p>



<p>Firstly, while 15 years ago I shared the Rationalists’ interests, sensibility, and outlook, and their stances on most issues, I also found them bizarrely, inexplicably obsessed with the question of whether AI would soon become superhumanly powerful and change the basic conditions of life on earth, and with how to make the AI transition go well.  Why <em>that</em>, as opposed to all the other sci-fi scenarios one could worry about, not to mention all the nearer-term risks to humanity?</p>



<p>Suffice it to say that empirical developments have since caused me to withdraw my objection.  Sometimes weird people are weird merely because they see the future sooner than others.  Indeed, it seems to me that the biggest thing the Rationalists got wrong about AI was to <em>underestimate</em> how soon the revolution would happen, and to overestimate how many new ideas would be needed for it (mostly, as we now know, it just took lots more compute and training data).  Now that I, too, spend some of my time working on AI alignment, I was able to use LessOnline in part for research meetings with colleagues.</p>



<p>A second reason I didn’t identify with the Rationalists was cultural: they were, and are, centrally a bunch of twentysomethings who “work” at an ever-changing list of Berkeley- and San-Francisco-based “orgs” of their own invention, and who live in group houses where they explore their exotic sexualities, gender identities, and fetishes, sometimes with the aid of psychedelics.  I, by contrast, am a straight, monogamous, middle-aged tenured professor, married to another such professor and raising two kids who go to normal schools.  Hanging out with the Rationalists always makes me feel older and younger at the same time.</p>



<p>So what changed?  For one thing, with the march of time, a significant fraction of Rationalists now have marriages, children, or both—indeed, a highlight of LessOnline was the many adorable toddlers running around the Lighthaven campus.  Rationalists are successfully reproducing!  Some because of explicit pronatalist ideology, or because they were persuaded by Bryan Caplan’s arguments in <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Selfish-Reasons-Have-More-Kids/dp/0465028616">Selfish Reasons to Have More Kids</a></em>.  But others simply because of the same impulses that led their ancestors to do the same for eons.  And perhaps because, like the Mormons or Amish or Orthodox Jews, but unlike typical secular urbanites, the Rationalists <em>believe </em>in something.  For all their fears around AI, they don’t <em>act</em> doomy, but buzz with ideas about how to build a better world for the next generation.</p>



<p>At a LessOnline parenting session, hosted by Julia Wise, I was surrounded by parents who worry about the same things I do: how do we raise our kids to be independent and agentic yet socialized and reasonably well-behaved, technologically savvy yet not droolingly addicted to iPad games?  What schooling options will let them accelerate in math, save them from the crushing monotony that we experienced?  How much of our own lives should we sacrifice on the altar of our kids’ “enrichment,” versus trusting Judith Rich Harris that such efforts quickly hit a point of diminishing returns?</p>



<p>A third reason I didn’t identify with the Rationalists was, frankly, that they gave off some (not all) of the vibes of a cult, with Eliezer as guru.  Eliezer writes in parables and koans.  He teaches that the fate of life on earth hangs in the balance, that the select few who understand the stakes have the terrible burden of steering the future.  Taking what Rationalists call the “outside view,” <em>how good is the track record for this sort of thing?</em></p>



<p>OK, but what did I actually see at Lighthaven?  I saw something that seemed to resemble a cult only insofar as the Beatniks, the Bloomsbury Group, the early Royal Society, or any other community that believed in something did.  When Eliezer himself—the bearded, cap-wearing Moses who led the nerds from bondage to their Promised Land in Berkeley—showed up, he was argued with like anyone else.  Eliezer has in any case largely passed his staff to a new generation: Nate Soares and Zvi Mowshowitz have found new and, in various ways, better ways of talking about AI risk; Scott Alexander has for the last decade written the blog that’s the community’s intellectual center; figures from Kelsey Piper to Jacob Falkovich to Aella have taken Rationalism in new directions, from mainstream political engagement to the … err … <a href="https://aella.substack.com/p/my-birthday-gangbang">statistical analysis of orgies</a>.</p>



<p>I’ll say this, though, on the naysayers’ side: it’s <em>really</em> hard to make dancing to AI-generated pop songs about Bayes’ theorem and Tarski’s definition of truth not feel cringe, as I can now attest from experience.</p>



<p>The cult thing brings me to the deepest reason I hesitated for so long to identify as a Rationalist: namely, I was scared that if I did, people whose approval I craved (including my academic colleagues, but also just randos on the Internet) would sneer at me.  For years, I searched of some way of explaining this community’s appeal so reasonable that it would silence the sneers.</p>



<p>It took years of psychological struggle, and (frankly) solidifying my own place in the world, to follow the true path, which of course is not to give a shit what some haters think of my life choices.  Consider: five years ago, it felt obvious to me that the entire Rationalist community might be about to implode, under existential threat from Cade Metz’s <em>New York Times</em> article, as well as RationalWiki and SneerClub and all the others laughing at the Rationalists and accusing them of every evil.  Yet last week at LessOnline, I saw a community that’s never been thriving more, with a beautiful real-world campus, excellent writers on every topic who felt like this was the place to be, and even a crop of kids.  How many of the sneerers are living such fulfilled lives?  To judge from their own angry, depressed self-disclosures, probably not many.</p>



<p>But are the sneerers right that, even if the Rationalists are enjoying their own lives, they’re making other people’s lives miserable?  Are they closet far-right monarchists, like Curtis Yarvin?  I liked how <em>The New Yorker</em> put it in its recent, long and (to my mind) <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2025/06/09/curtis-yarvin-profile">devastating profile of Yarvin</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The most generous engagement with Yarvin’s ideas has come from bloggers associated with the rationalist movement, which prides itself on weighing evidence for even seemingly far-fetched claims. Their formidable patience, however, has also worn thin. “He never addressed me as an equal, only as a brainwashed person,” Scott Aaronson, an eminent computer scientist, said of their conversations. “He seemed to think that if he just gave me one more reading assignment about happy slaves singing or one more monologue about F.D.R., I’d finally see the light.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The closest to right-wing politics that I witnessed at LessOnline was a session, with <a href="https://www.vox.com/authors/kelsey-piper">Kelsey Piper</a> and current and former congressional staffers, about the prospects for moderate Democrats to articulate a moderate, pro-abundance agenda that would resonate with the public and finally defeat MAGA.</p>



<p>But surely the Rationalists are incels, bitter that they can’t get laid?  Again, the closest I saw was a session where Jacob Falkovich helped a standing-room-only crowd of mostly male nerds confront their fears around dating and understand women better, with Rationalist women eagerly volunteering to answer questions about their perspective.  Gross, right?  (Also, for those already in relationships, Eliezer’s primary consort and former couples therapist <a href="https://www.grettaduleba.com/">Gretta Duleba</a> did a session on relationship conflict.)</p>



<p>So, yes, when it comes to the Rationalists, I’m going to believe my own lying eyes over the charges of the sneerers.  The sneerers can even say about me, in their favorite formulation, that I’ve “gone mask off,” confirmed the horrible things they’ve always suspected.  Yes, the mask is off—and beneath the mask is the same person I always was, who has an inordinate fondness for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Busy_beaver">Busy Beaver function</a> and the complexity class <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1004.0377">BQP/qpoly</a>, and who uses too many filler words and moves his hands too much, and who strongly supports the Enlightenment, and who once feared that his best shot at happiness in life would be to earn women’s pity rather than their contempt.  Incorrectly, as I’m glad to report.  From my nebbishy nadir to the present, a central thing that’s changed is that, from my family to my academic colleagues to the Rationalist community to my blog readers, I finally found some people who want what I have to sell.</p>

<p><strong><mark>Unrelated Announcements:</mark></strong></p>



<p>My replies to comments on this post might be light, as I’ll be accompanying my daughter on a school trip to the Galapagos Islands!</p>



<p>A few weeks ago, I was “ambushed” into leading a session on philosophy and theoretical computer science at UT Austin.  (I.e., asked to show up for the session, but thought I’d just be a participant rather than the main event.)  The session was then <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OST1DjD08Hg">recorded and placed on YouTube</a>—and surprisingly, given the circumstances, some people seemed to like it!</p>



<p>Friend-of-the-blog <a href="https://www.alonrosen.net/">Alon Rosen</a> has asked me to announce a <a href="https://cs.unibocconi.eu/call-nominations-trevisan-prize-2025">call for nominations</a> for a new theoretical computer science prize, in memory of my former professor (and fellow TCS blogger) <a href="https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=8057">Luca Trevisan</a>, who was lost to the world too soon.</p>



<p>And one more: Mahdi Cheraghchi has asked me to announce the STOC’2025 online poster session, registration deadline June 12; <a href="https://acm-stoc.org/stoc2025/call-for-posters.html">see here for more</a>.  Incidentally, I’ll be at STOC in Prague to give a plenary on quantum algorithms; I look forward to meeting any readers who are there!</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/18/6-month-old-solo-owned-vibe-coder-base44-sells-to-wix-for-80m-cash/">https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/18/6-month-old-solo-owned-vibe-coder-base44-sells-to-wix-for-80m-cash/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44316920">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p id="speakable-summary">There’s a lot of talk in the startup world about how AI makes individuals so productive that it could give rise to a generation of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Single-Handed-Unicorn-Billion-Dollar-Solopreneurs-Business/dp/B0DWSRS62N" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">“solo unicorns”</a> — one-person companies worth over $1 billion.</p>

<p>While an actual solo unicorn remains a mythical creature, Israeli developer Maor Shlomo provided compelling evidence Wednesday that the concept might not be impossible.&nbsp;</p>







<p>Shlomo sold his 6-month-old, bootstrapped vibe-coding startup Base44 to Wix for $80 million, Wix <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2025/06/18/3101508/0/en/Wix-Further-Expands-into-Vibe-Coding-with-Acquisition-of-Base44-a-Hyper-Growth-Startup-that-Simplifies-Web-and-App-Creation-with-AI.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">announced</a> Wednesday. And the deal was cash, Wix confirmed to TechCrunch.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Admittedly, this wasn’t a billion dollars or close to it. And Shlomo wasn’t truly solo — he had eight employees, Wix confirmed. They will collectively receive $25 million of the $80 million as a “retention” bonus. Wix declined to give details on that part of the deal, like how long they have to stay in their jobs to get full payouts.</p>

<p>Still, Base44’s rapid rise and impressive sale price have been the talk of the <a href="https://x.com/benln/status/1935327374079574427" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">vibe-coding community</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In its six months as a stand-alone company, Base44 reportedly grew to 250,000 users, hitting 10,000 users within its first three weeks. According to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7336025796509077504/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Shlomo’s posts</a> on X and LinkedIn, the company was profitable, generating $189,000 in profit in May even after covering high LLM token costs, which he also documented publicly.</p>

<p>Base44 spread mostly through word of mouth as Shlomo, a 31-year-old programmer, shared his building journey on LinkedIn and Twitter. The project began as a side venture, he told <a href="https://www.calcalistech.com/ctechnews/article/s1iflnlelx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Israeli tech news site CTech</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


<p>“Base44 is a moonshot experiment — helping everyone, technical or not, build software without coding at all,” he <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/maor-shlomo-1088b4144_excited-to-share-a-project-ive-been-working-activity-7297302969652277252-vcj8?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAAEjzLUBg333G2D9H7FJaye0FUkOP4V2yos">explained on LinkedIn</a> when he launched it to the public.</p>

<p>It’s one of the newer crop of vibe-coding products designed for non-programmers. Users enter text prompts, and the platform builds complete applications, with database, storage, authentication, analytics, and integration. It also supports email, texting, and maps, with a roadmap for more enterprise-grade security support.</p>

<p>Base44 isn’t unique in this area. Other vibe coders like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/22/adaptive-computer-wants-to-reinvent-the-pc-with-vibe-coding-for-non-programmers/">Adaptive Computer</a> handle similar infrastructure work. But Base44’s fast rise was astounding all the same.</p>







<p>Shlomo was already known in the Israeli startup community through his previous startup, the Insight Partners-backed data analytics company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/18/explorium-scores-75m-series-c-just-10-months-after-b-round/">Explorium</a>. His brother is also a co-founder of an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/27/hackers-are-targeting-machine-identities-token-security-just-raised-20m-to-stop-them/">AI security startup, Token Security,</a> which just raised $20 million led by Notable Capital (formerly GGV Capital) and a bunch of Israeli tech angels.</p>

<p>He quickly gained partnership agreements  for Base44 with big Israeli tech companies like eToro and Similarweb.</p>

<p>After posting about his decision to use Anthropic’s Claude LLM through AWS instead of models by OpenAI — mostly for cost-per-performance reasons — Amazon invited Base44 to demo at a Tel Aviv AWS event last month, which <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/maor-shlomo-1088b4144_it-was-an-honor-to-present-base44-on-the-activity-7333519004138942464-EVoB/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAAEjzLUBg333G2D9H7FJaye0FUkOP4V2yos" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Shlomo documented.</a></p>

<p>“Crazy f***ing journey so far,” Shlomo <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7341088575049891840/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">posted on LinkedIn</a> when announcing the news of the acquisition. Despite the growth and the profits — or really because of it — he sold his still-bootstrapped company because “the scale and volume we need is not something we can organically grow into&nbsp;… If we were able to get so far organically, bootstrapped, I’m excited to see our new pace now that we have all the resources in place,” he wrote.</p>

<p>For its part, Wix picked up a proven, fast-growing, local vibe-coding platform for a relative song because of its youth. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/22/why-openai-wanted-to-buy-cursor-but-opted-for-the-fast-growing-windsurf/">OpenAI paid $3 billion for Windsurf,</a> which was founded in 2021.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Wix, of course, offers no-code website building that look professionally designed. Adding a profitable LLM vibe-coding product to its offerings is a logical move.</p>

<p>Shlomo could not be immediately reached for additional comment.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><strong node="[object Object]">AI agents are a hot topic, but not every AI system needs to be one.</strong></p>
<p>While agents promise autonomy and decision-making power, simpler &amp; more cost-saving solutions better serve many real-world use cases. The key lies in choosing the right architecture for the problem at hand.</p>
<p>In this post, we'll explore recent developments in Large Language Models (LLMs) and discuss key concepts of AI systems.</p>
<p>We've worked with LLMs across projects of varying complexity, from zero-shot prompting to chain-of-thought reasoning, from RAG-based architectures to sophisticated workflows and autonomous agents.</p>
<p>This is an emerging field with evolving terminology. The boundaries between different concepts are still being defined, and classifications remain fluid. As the field progresses, new frameworks and practices emerge to build more reliable AI systems.</p>
<p>To demonstrate these different systems, we'll walk through a familiar use case – a resume-screening application – to reveal the unexpected leaps in capability (and complexity) at each level.</p>
<h2>Pure LLM</h2>
<p>A pure LLM is essentially a lossy compression of the internet, a snapshot of knowledge from its training data. It excels at tasks involving this stored knowledge: summarizing novels, writing essays about global warming, explaining special relativity to a 5-year-old, or composing haikus.</p>
<p>However, without additional capabilities, an LLM cannot provide real-time information like the current temperature in NYC. This distinguishes pure LLMs from chat applications like ChatGPT, which enhance their core LLM with real-time search and additional tools.</p>
<p>That said, not all enhancements require external context. There are several prompting techniques, including in-context learning and few-shot learning that help LLMs tackle specific problems without the need of context retrieval.</p>
<p><strong node="[object Object]">Example:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>To check if a resume is a good fit for a job description, an LLM with one-shot prompting and in-context learning can be utilized to classify it as Passed or Failed.</li>
</ul>
<p><span><img alt="AI System Development - Workflow-04.png" loading="lazy" width="1280" height="800" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://www.codelink.io/_next/static/chunks/images/strapi-bucket-production/AI_System_Development_Workflow_04_0c8d75b6b4/AI_System_Development_Workflow_04_0c8d75b6b4_1920.webp 1x, https://www.codelink.io/_next/static/chunks/images/strapi-bucket-production/AI_System_Development_Workflow_04_0c8d75b6b4/AI_System_Development_Workflow_04_0c8d75b6b4_2048.webp 2x" src="https://www.codelink.io/_next/static/chunks/images/strapi-bucket-production/AI_System_Development_Workflow_04_0c8d75b6b4/AI_System_Development_Workflow_04_0c8d75b6b4_2048.webp"></span></p>
<h2>RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)</h2>
<p>Retrieval methods enhance LLMs by providing relevant context, making them more current, precise, and practical. You can grant LLMs access to internal data for processing and manipulation. This context allows the LLM to extract information, create summaries, and generate responses. RAG can also incorporate real-time information through the latest data retrieval.</p>
<p><strong node="[object Object]">Example:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The resume screening application can be improved by retrieving internal company data, such as engineering playbooks, policies, and past resumes, to enrich the context and make better classification decisions.</li>
<li>Retrieval typically employs tools like vectorization, vector databases, and semantic search.</li>
</ul>
<p><span><img alt="AI System Development - Workflow-03.png" loading="lazy" width="1280" height="800" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://www.codelink.io/_next/static/chunks/images/strapi-bucket-production/AI_System_Development_Workflow_03_11d4779a1d/AI_System_Development_Workflow_03_11d4779a1d_1920.webp 1x, https://www.codelink.io/_next/static/chunks/images/strapi-bucket-production/AI_System_Development_Workflow_03_11d4779a1d/AI_System_Development_Workflow_03_11d4779a1d_2048.webp 2x" src="https://www.codelink.io/_next/static/chunks/images/strapi-bucket-production/AI_System_Development_Workflow_03_11d4779a1d/AI_System_Development_Workflow_03_11d4779a1d_2048.webp"></span></p>
<h2>Tool Use &amp; AI Workflow</h2>
<p>LLMs can automate business processes by following well-defined paths. They're most effective for consistent, well-structured tasks.</p>
<p>Tool use enables workflow automation. By connecting to APIs, whether for calculators, calendars, email services, or search engines, LLMs can leverage reliable external utilities instead of relying on their internal, non-deterministic capabilities.</p>
<p><strong node="[object Object]">Example:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>An AI workflow can connect to the hiring portal to fetch resumes and job descriptions → Evaluate qualifications based on experience, education, and skills → Send appropriate email responses (rejection or interview invitation).</li>
<li>For this resume scanning workflow, the LLM requires access to the database, email API, and calendar API. It follows predefined steps to automate the process programmatically.</li>
</ul>
<p><span><img alt="AI System Development - Workflow-02.png" loading="lazy" width="1280" height="800" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://www.codelink.io/_next/static/chunks/images/strapi-bucket-production/AI_System_Development_Workflow_02_db62eff345/AI_System_Development_Workflow_02_db62eff345_1920.webp 1x, https://www.codelink.io/_next/static/chunks/images/strapi-bucket-production/AI_System_Development_Workflow_02_db62eff345/AI_System_Development_Workflow_02_db62eff345_2048.webp 2x" src="https://www.codelink.io/_next/static/chunks/images/strapi-bucket-production/AI_System_Development_Workflow_02_db62eff345/AI_System_Development_Workflow_02_db62eff345_2048.webp"></span></p>
<h2>AI Agent</h2>
<p>AI Agents are systems that reason and make decisions independently. They break down tasks into steps, use external tools as needed, evaluate results, and determine the following actions: whether to store results, request human input, or proceed to the next step.</p>
<p>This represents another layer of abstraction above tool use &amp; AI workflow, automating both planning and decision-making.</p>
<p>While AI workflows require explicit user triggers (like button clicks) and follow programmatically defined paths, AI Agents can initiate workflows independently and determine their sequence and combination dynamically.</p>
<p><strong node="[object Object]">Example:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>An AI Agent can manage the entire recruitment process, including parsing CVs, coordinating availability via chat or email, scheduling interviews, and handling schedule changes.</li>

<h2>Key takeaway</h2>
<h3>1. Not every system requires an AI agent</h3>
<p>Start with simple, composable patterns and add complexity as needed. For some systems, retrieval alone suffices. In our resume screening example, a straightforward workflow works well when the criteria and actions are clear. Consider an Agent approach only when greater autonomy is needed to reduce human intervention.</p>
<h3>2. Focus on reliability over capability</h3>
<p>The non-deterministic nature of LLMs makes building dependable systems challenging. While creating proofs of concept is quick, scaling to production often reveals complications. Begin with a sandbox environment, implement consistent testing methods, and establish guardrails for reliability.</p></div></div>]]></description>
