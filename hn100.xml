<h2>Storing massive data, as cheap as possible</h2>



<p>The year is 1995 and you live in post-Soviet Russia. </p>



<p>It‚Äôs a hellish time: prices for basic consumer goods are <em>tripl</em>e what they were last year. Your employer just paid your salary in eggs instead of money. There are daily shootouts between rival gangs. üéµ<em>Your love life‚Äôs DOA‚Ä¶</em>üéµ</p>



<p>It‚Äôs a wonderful time: Russia is awash in Western computers, TVs, VCRs, cassette players and dialup modems. Technology that was strictly off-limits in 1989 is suddenly within reach.</p>



<p>As one of the lucky Russians to have a computer at home, you are facing a challenge: your 500MB hard drive is overflowing with software, games, and documents. You must find an affordable way to get more digital storage.</p>





<p>You <em>could</em> store files on cheap and plentiful floppy disks. But each floppy only stores 1.44MB and is known to randomly lose data. Your second option is to buy another hard drive. But that costs about $200 USD ‚Äì as much as a Russian‚Äôs entire monthly salary‚Ä¶</p>



<p>You head over to the local computer store in a gray mood. The store is cramped with bootlegged computer games, peripherals and hardware. Inside, you ask Yevgeni the proprietor whether there might be a cheap solution to your storage problem.</p>



<p>This is Yevgeni:</p>




<div>
<figure><a href="https://jacobfilipp.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/arvid-1031-in-package.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="805" height="532" src="https://jacobfilipp.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/arvid-1031-in-package.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://jacobfilipp.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/arvid-1031-in-package.jpg 805w, https://jacobfilipp.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/arvid-1031-in-package-300x198.jpg 300w, https://jacobfilipp.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/arvid-1031-in-package-768x508.jpg 768w, https://jacobfilipp.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/arvid-1031-in-package-766x506.jpg 766w" sizes="(max-width: 805px) 100vw, 805px"></a></figure></div>


<p>Fortunately, Yevgeni <em>does</em> have a 3<sub><sup>rd</sup></sub> option for you! It‚Äôs a truly innovative Russian-made product called <strong>the ‚ÄúArVid‚Äù card</strong>. It comes in a package like this: </p>



<p>It is an ISA expansion card for your computer and will allow you to use your home-VCR to store <strong>4 hard-drives‚Äô worth of data</strong> on a single VHS tape. The same tape you use to watch movies at home.</p>



<p>You hand over 80 American Dollars. Yevgeni slides out a little warranty card from inside the ArVid package, writes in the date of purchase and signs it. You step out of that store into the crisp air of a 1995 Moscow day. A proud owner of an ArVid 1030.</p>



<h2>Getting started with this device</h2>



<p>You take the package home and take a closer look at what‚Äôs inside:</p>



<div><p>There‚Äôs the ArVid ISA Card itself. This card slots into your ‚Äú386‚Äù PC motherboard. The plate sits flush with the back of your computer. It has a port for a cable and a glossy diode for receiving an infrared signal.</p><figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="400" height="300" src="https://jacobfilipp.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Kontr_Arvid-1020_2-e1705878838312.jpg" alt=""></figure></div>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="https://jacobfilipp.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/5333649035_335cdaf2a7_o-1024x576.jpg" alt=""></figure><p>The package includes several <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floppy_disk">3¬Ω‚Äù floppy disks</a> . Each one is loaded with 1.44MB of software, drivers and documentation. A printed documentation pamphlet with ‚Äú–êP–í–ò–î‚Äù on the front is also included.</p></div>



<div><p>Finally, there is a custom cable that connected your computer to your VCR. Aside from the standard ‚Äúvideo in‚Äù and ‚Äúvideo out‚Äù connectors, this cable has an extra wire with an Infrared emitting LED at the tip (circled in red).</p><figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="400" height="300" src="https://jacobfilipp.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Arvid-cable-with-IR-emitter.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://jacobfilipp.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Arvid-cable-with-IR-emitter.jpg 400w, https://jacobfilipp.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Arvid-cable-with-IR-emitter-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px"></figure></div>



<p>Here is how the card, VCR and home computer worked together:</p>



<div>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://jacobfilipp.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/arvid-diagram-for-web-2.svg">
</p>



<div>
<ol>
<li>Your CRT screen showed the program‚Äôs interface.</li>



<li>During setup, you‚Äôd use the VCR‚Äôs remote to send commands like ‚Äúplay‚Äù to the ArVid card.</li>



<li>The ArVid card is inserted into the computer. It has an infrared diode to record those signals for your remote. It also has a connector for a special cable that carried Video IN, Video OUT and Infrared Out signals.</li>



<li>The Video IN and Video OUT RCA jacks went into designated jacks on the VCR device.</li>



<li>The cable has a thin wire with an infrared transmitter diode. You‚Äôd usually place it close to the front of the VCR (or tape it to the front, as shown). This diode beams out the pre-recorded signals that impersonate the remote control.</li>



<li>A domestic VHS tape would store your data. A 3-hour tape could store 2GB.</li>
</ol>
</div>
</div>



<h2>Impersonating your VCR remote</h2>



<p>After installing the ArVid card into your<a href="https://ancientelectronics.wordpress.com/2014/04/23/anatomy-of-a-386-dos-pc/"> 386 PC</a> and connecting all the video wires, the next challenge was getting the card to control your domestic VCR. </p>



<p>The ArVid had a neat way of controlling VCRs: it did so by pretending to be the VCR‚Äôs own remote-control. To accomplish this trick, users needed to ‚Äúteach‚Äù the card which specific infrared remote-control signals corresponded to commands such as ‚Äúplay‚Äù, ‚Äústop‚Äù and ‚Äúrewind‚Äù.</p>



<p>To ‚Äúteach‚Äù the card, you needed to turn the back of your computer to face you. At the back of the card there was a shiny receiver diode. You‚Äôd point the VCR remote at it and the ArVid‚Äôs software would tell you which button to press while it recorded the signals. It could use modulated and unmodulated signals to disguise itself as your remote.</p>



<p>Teaching ArVid all of your VCR remote‚Äôs commands took 3 hours (‚Ä¶ or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070211143412/http://www.phantom.sannata.ru/cgi-bin/ikonboard/topic.cgi?forum=10&amp;topic=18">7 minutes, depending on who you believe</a> <sup>üá∑üá∫</sup>).</p>



<h2>Writing data to tape</h2>



<p>To prepare the tape for writing, ArVid tried to figure out the best ‚Äú<a href="https://electronics.howstuffworks.com/vcr2.htm">tracking alignment</a>‚Äù for your VCR. It did so by writing a 2.5-minute data segment to tape, then reading it back while adjusting the VCR‚Äôs ‚Äúread head‚Äù position to one of 6 different settings. ArVid calculated the reading ‚Äúerror rate‚Äù at each one of the 6 track positions. Finally, the software recommended the track alignment with the least number of errors for your VCR‚Äôs magnetic read-head.</p>



<p>Below: ArVid has tested 5 track-alignment options. It recommends option 3 ‚Äì although it had more ‚Äúdouble‚Äù errors than option 2 (164 of them) it had the fewest <em>total errors</em> at 7,887.</p>


<div>
<figure><a href="https://jacobfilipp.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Arvid-alignment-chooser-screen.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="624" height="427" src="https://jacobfilipp.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Arvid-alignment-chooser-screen.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://jacobfilipp.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Arvid-alignment-chooser-screen.jpg 624w, https://jacobfilipp.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Arvid-alignment-chooser-screen-300x205.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px"></a></figure></div>


<p>To write digital data from your computer to tape, you select the files using a custom file navigation program that resembled the popular ‚ÄúNorton Commander‚Äù application. Then pop one of these bad boys into your VCR:</p>





<p>Once you give the command to ‚Äúwrite‚Äù, the ArVid card converts your file‚Äôs data into a video signal. At the same time, ArVid flashes the infrared emitter to send a ‚Äústart recording‚Äù command to the VCR ‚Äì and your data starts being laid down on the VHS magnetic tape.</p>



<p>When the computer is finished recording the files to tape, there is a ‚Äúverification‚Äù step. ArVid rewinds the tape and reads back all the data it wrote to make sure there were no critical data losses.</p>


<div>

There were 23,795 ‚Äúsingle‚Äù errors and 149 ‚Äúdouble‚Äù errors. No ‚Äútriple‚Äù errors.</figcaption></figure></div>


<h2>Reading data from tape</h2>



<p>To get your data of the VHS tape and into your computer, you needed 2 things: the tape and a special ‚Äútable of contents‚Äù file. That file made it so you didn‚Äôt need to view the whole tape just to get a single file. ArVid left time markers on the tape that you could use to fast-forward to a specific file.</p>



<p>You‚Äôd insert the VHS tape into your VCR and bring up the ArVid software in reading mode. Pick the files you want to download from the tape and go! The device would send ‚Äúfast forward‚Äù, ‚Äúrewind‚Äù and ‚Äúplay‚Äù commands to your VCR and the video signal from the tape would go out of the VCR and into the computer. The computer converts the visual signal back into digital data.</p>



<h3>Boosting the quality of your backups</h3>



<p>The ArVid device and its software were remarkably reliable. But there were still things you could do if you wanted your data to stay safely stored on VHS tapes for a loooong time. The main factors within your control were the kind of VCR Device you owned and the quality of the VHS tapes you bought.</p>



<p>For the VCR, ArVid‚Äôs manufacturer recommended the pricy <em>Sony 130XR</em> and the cheaper <em>Akai-120EDG</em>. It appears that the best VCRs are heavy ones with a metal envelope. That‚Äôs because they don‚Äôt shake around as much when the tape is forwarded, rewound and stopped. You wouldn‚Äôt want a superfast-rewinding VCR either: the slow ArVid hardware would have trouble keeping up with it‚Ä¶ (<a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%9E%D0%B1%D1%81%D1%83%D0%B6%D0%B4%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%B5%3A%D0%90%D1%80%D0%92%D0%B8%D0%B4">see these comments on Russian Wikipedia</a><sup>üá∑üá∫</sup>). ArVid would not work with 60Hz NTSC VCRs.</p>



<p>For the VHS tapes, the best ones were tapes with a 180-minute capacity. These tapes have the thickest magnetic ribbon inside. Longer-playing tapes had thinner tape, which were mechanically weaker and would wear down from use. This ‚Äútape thickness‚Äù logic makes sense when you think about the fact that longer tapes have to be thinner to fit in a standard VHS case.</p>



<p><em>Here is a video of ArVid‚Äôs set up, writing and reading (in Russian):</em></p>

</p></figure>



<h2>The technical details</h2>



<p>To store signal on tape reliably, the device used only the luminance portion of the video signal. And only black and white ‚Äì no grays. That means that variations in colour and sound were <strong>not used</strong> when recording data.</p>



<p>As best as I could figure out, data was stored to tape using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-return-to-zero">Non-Return-to-Zero</a> encoding (<a href="https://groups.google.com/g/fido7.su.hardw.support.arvid/c/kEVSfplyuzk/m/ZWLxp3qYfhsJ">according to some Fido7 comments</a><sup>üá∑üá∫</sup>). On the tape itself, files were recorded in sections separated by 5-second blank intervals.</p>



<figure><a href="https://jacobfilipp.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/screenshot-arvid-faq-spacing-on-tape.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="604" height="249" src="https://jacobfilipp.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/screenshot-arvid-faq-spacing-on-tape.png" alt="" srcset="https://jacobfilipp.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/screenshot-arvid-faq-spacing-on-tape.png 604w, https://jacobfilipp.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/screenshot-arvid-faq-spacing-on-tape-300x124.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 604px) 100vw, 604px"></a><figcaption>An ASCII diagram from the ArVid FAQ, illustrating how files are laid out on tape.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Home-use VHS tapes had worse quality than commercial-grade magnetic tape, so the makers took extra measures to detect and fix errors on tape. ArVid read and wrote data using an error correction algorithm called ‚ÄúReed-Solomon with Interleaving‚Äù (I also came across mentions of a Galois algorithm). They claimed that this let the ArVid software correct up to 3 defective bytes in a code group, and a loss of up to 450 consecutive bytes could be corrected. After reading data from tape, the software performed a <a href="https://www.lammertbies.nl/comm/info/crc-calculation">CRC32 check </a>for errors, operating on every 512-byte block.</p>


<div>
<figure><a href="https://jacobfilipp.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/real-time-ad.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="722" height="973" src="https://jacobfilipp.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/real-time-ad.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://jacobfilipp.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/real-time-ad.jpg 722w, https://jacobfilipp.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/real-time-ad-223x300.jpg 223w" sizes="(max-width: 722px) 100vw, 722px"></a><figcaption>An ad for a computer store in gaming magazine Video-ACC. Mid 90s.</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>The ArVid software gave users a lot of information about the number of errors on tape. This was unique at a time when backup vendors preferred to pretend that errors didn‚Äôt exist. And it was a source of pride for the creators. This decision gave users the feedback they needed to improve their use of the system: you could see the impact of adjusting VCR tracking, purchasing better VHS tapes, switching out your VCR for another‚Ä¶ even placing your VCR on a sturdier surface to reduce shaking and errors.</p>



<p>Errors could also be caused by VHS players taking a long time to ‚Äúrev up to full speed‚Äù once playback started, so the ArVid software could be set to write more ‚Äúinitial empty frames‚Äù to make up for it.</p>



<p>Finally, the software saves a manifest of the files on your tape locally in ‚Äú.TDR‚Äù format. This local table-of-contents gave the device a fast way of seeing and accessing the right file locations without playing through the whole tape. If the .TDR file was lost, there was also a program to recreated it by reading through an entire tape (a slow affair).</p>



<p>This is what the ArVid data on VHS tapes looked like if you played it through a normal TV:</p>

<h2>ArVid in action</h2>



<h3>Capacity and cost ‚Äì how did it compare to other options? </h3>


<p>You could record an <strong>absolutely whopping</strong> amount of data onto a single VHS tape. All models of ArVid could record 1.08 Gigabytes onto a 180-minute tape, at a 100 kilobytes/sec speed. From model 1020 and onward, they could record 2.16 Gigabytes on that same tape (at 200 kilobytes/sec).</p>
<p>The ArVid system cost about $80 USD, with VHS tapes costing $4 USD, and a VCR that cost on average $160 (which many people already had at home). That was a phenomenal value for storage!</p>
<p>To show you just how good this was for the time, here are typical storage prices in 1997:</p>
<ul>
<li>CD-R recording drive ‚Äì would start at $300 for the drive. CD capacity ranged from 184-870 Mb. Note that the first consumer CD-R under $1,000 was only introduced in September 1995 (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD-R">the Hewlett Packard model 4020i manufactured by Philips)</a></li>
<li>ZIP drive ‚Äì cost $150 for the drive and $15 per disk (100mb each)</li>
<li>JAZ drive ‚Äì $350 for the drive, and $85 for each disk (up to 1GB each)</li>
<li>3.5‚Ä≥ floppy drive ‚Äì $28 CAD for the drive (source: <a href="https://archive.org/details/thecomputerpaper">1997 issue of the Computer Paper in Canada</a>) with the puny 1.44MB diskettes costing about $0.30 (as <a href="https://jacobfilipp.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/diskettes-ad-1997.jpg">seen in this ad</a> from the <a href="https://archive.org/details/issuu_dougalder_1996-01_tcp_on/page/n123/mode/2up">1996 issue of Computer Paper</a>). Although, you could get them as cheap as 14 cents if you‚Äôre willing to trust <a href="https://jacobfilipp.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/computer-clearance-and-apples.jpg">someone who runs a computers-and-apples warehouse!</a></li>
<li>Hard Drives ‚Äì typical capacity would be around 1.2GB and would cost $150 USD.
<ul>
<li>Note that just 2 years before ‚Äì in 1995 ‚Äì hard drive capacity would‚Äôve been only around 560 Mb (<a href="https://dosdays.co.uk/topics/1995.php">Source</a>). One VHS tape could store more information than an entire hard drive.</li>
</ul>

<h3>How long would data last on tape?</h3>



<p>The Canadian Conservation Institute says that <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/conservation-institute/services/conservation-preservation-publications/technical-bulletins/digitization-vhs-video-tapes.html#a2b">VHS tapes have a 10-30 year lifespan, on average</a>.</p>



<p>In 2011, <a href="https://www.phantom.sannata.org/viewtopic.php?f=&amp;t=8665">user <em>Ctrl</em> on the <em>Sannata</em> forum<sup>üá∑üá∫</sup> used an ArVid system to successfully recover</a> all the files they saved onto a VHS tape in 1994/1995 without any errors. That‚Äôs 16 years of reliable data storage. <em>Ctrl </em>used the last-generation 1052 card for both writing and recovery. Another tape from 98 (on a semi-professional BASF tape) had only minor errors that didn‚Äôt affect data restoration.</p>



<p>On the same thread, user&nbsp;<em>Teodor</em> claimed they had no problems reading tapes from the late 90s in 2011. This person successfully used Hitachi VHS tapes. They had errors reading data at first, with a Panasonic NV-SD450 VCR, but saw a big improvement when they switched to the JVC HR-DD868 VCR.</p>



<p>On the Rutracker torrent site, <a href="https://rutracker.org/forum/viewtopic.php?p=47499118#47499118">user <em>korvegeta</em> successfully read from tapes in 2011</a><sup>üá∑üá∫</sup>. Although it isn‚Äôt known exactly when they were recorded. I‚Äôd guess 1998.</p>



<h3>Real-world use cases</h3>



<p>The ArVid devices were sold as data backup solutions. ‚ÄúPO KSI‚Äù, the manufacturers, directly positioned them as competitors for backup providers like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_Memory_Systems">Colorado Memory Systems</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarter-inch_cartridge">QIC systems</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tandberg_Data">Tandberg Data</a> . </p>



<p>The nature of the medium ‚Äì VHS tape ‚Äì means that they can‚Äôt be read and rewritten over and over again. That‚Äôs because heavy use causes mechanical wear on the magnetic VHS tape. ‚ÄúWrite once ‚Äì read infrequently‚Äù is the ideal use case.</p>



<p>Throughout my ArVid research, I saw that people indeed used this device for data backup. Among them were people who used these disks at the office. This makes sense because the average home user had a hard drive that was 500mb-1.2GB in size and there simply wasn‚Äôt enough ‚Äústuff‚Äù around to fill up several 2GB Tapes‚Äô worth of data. Remember: this was in the infancy of the World Wide Web. No MP3s. No digital video. No software websites. Purchasing ArVid as a backup solution made more sense for a small business than for a home user.</p>



<p>Others mentioned storing Log Data on these tapes. There wasn‚Äôt much detail beyond that, except for an author that said he personally saw <a href="http://sannata.org/articles/arvid.shtml">academic experiment data being stored to tape using ArVid</a><sup>üá∑üá∫</sup>.</p>



<p>On both Russian and English forums, I found references to VHS tapes being used to shuttle Astronomical observation data between institutions. Presumably because of the cheap dollars-per-gigabyte for this medium.</p>

<p>People didn‚Äôt generally use these VHS tapes to exchange or sell data, like they did with floppy disks. There were several factors that made it challenging for one person to read data from a tape written by another person. These included differences in the ArVid hardware version, writing density, the quality of the VCR ‚Äì even differences in the processing power between the two computers ‚Äì all of them could create problems in reading a tape. This was despite the PO KSI team‚Äôs efforts to have backwards compatibility between ArVid versions. Another reason why tapes didn‚Äôt take off as a way to trade software: their capacity was overkill when most software at the time could fit on several floppies. I mean‚Ä¶ as late as 1997 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5o6NQmEA-8">Microsoft Office was available on floppy disks. Although 46 of them‚Ä¶</a></p>



<p>There were several interesting ‚Äúoff-label‚Äù uses for Arvid:</p>



<p>User <a href="https://www.yaplakal.com/forum3/st/25/topic2569781.html?hl=%D0%90%D1%80%D0%B2%D0%B8%D0%B4#entry120991245">–®–µ—Ä–∏–¥–∞–Ω (‚ÄúSheridan‚Äù) on the Yaplakal forums<sup>üá∑üá∫</sup>, </a>recalled travelling to Moscow to purchase ArVid-made VHS tapes with many computer games packed on them. Sheridan then travelled back home, copied the individual games off the tape onto floppy disks and resold them to eager locals.</p>



<p>In the year 2000, vagrants kept stealing the lightbulb in the lobby of one enterprising ArVid use. He put on his vigilante cape and set up a security camera, an ArVid 1052 and a VCR as a kind of jerry-rigged motion-triggered camera. The system stayed on all day and video recording would only start once ArVid detected major visual changes using the <em>Arvid Control</em> software package (‚Äú<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20041211201053/http://www.arvid.anadyr.ru/">Using ArVid as a surveillance system</a><sup>üá∑üá∫</sup>‚Äù). The culprits were caught on tape!</p>



<p>On Fidonet (a BBS network that also carried Usenet posts), ArVid  sparked the imaginations of Russia‚Äôs IT enthusiasts.&nbsp; One ambitious idea was to broadcast a video signal carrying data over a regular TV channel, in order to mass-share software to the homes of people who would tune in with their ArVid.</p>



<h2>Product improvements over time</h2>



<p>Production of ArVid cards went on from 1993 to the summer of 1998. In those 5 short years the product had a remarkable number of improvements.</p>



<p>The company that made them had the acronym ‚ÄúPO KSI‚Äù (short for ‚ÄúProfessional Association of Designers of Data Processing Systems‚Äù in Russian). They were based in Zelenograd, a ‚Äúone industry town‚Äù outside Moscow that was a hub for microelectronics production. The town was a brainchild of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Sarant">Alfred Sarant</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joel_Barr">Joel Barr</a> ‚Äì two spies who escaped from America and went on to illustrious careers in the USSR.</p>



<p>From a hardware perspective, the ISA cards <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZWUzcxMS7w">were an unusual mixture of Russian-made and foreign electronic components</a><sup>üá∑üá∫</sup>. The cards kept getting bigger built-in buffers and the ability to record data at a higher density (full history of specs in the Appendix). ArVid got a major boost when PO KSI moved from using an assembly of single-function microchips to using an <a href="https://www.alldatasheet.com/datasheet-pdf/pdf/525665/ACTEL/A1020B-PL84C.html">Actel a1020b-pl84c FPGA chip</a>. Switching to an FPGA processor meant that the cards ran cooler and didn‚Äôt cause the computer to overheat during operation.</p>



<p>Note the different look when you compare the older 1020 model with its integrated circuits to the newer 1052 with its big FPGA chip. <a href="https://www.phantom.sannata.org/viewtopic.php?t=2242&amp;start=33">(Photo source)</a><em>.</em></p>

<p>As we saw earlier, ‚Äútraining‚Äù the card to control your domestic VCR was critical to the system‚Äôs operation. Originally, ArVid would have had 2 infrared diodes built into the card‚Äôs back: a receiver to record signals from the remote control and a transmitter to send them ( <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PB9FvHNIzco">according to YouTube comments by user ‚Äúspbtvmaster‚Äù</a><sup>üá∑üá∫</sup>). But this setup meant that users had to rotate the back of their PC to face their VCR. PO KSI improved the experience by putting the infrared transmitter on a separate cable that could reach the VCR regardless of where the PC was facing.</p>



<p>Another improvement was to completely cut out the ‚Äútraining‚Äù phase for various VCR‚Äôs remotes. The company pre-recorded the remote-control sequences for common VCRs at the factory and shipped them with ArVid‚Äôs software package. Customers could pick their VCR make &amp; model from a list and be ready instantly. And if your VCR wasn‚Äôt on the preconfigured list, you could still train ArVid manually.</p>


<div>

<p>An extraordinary amount of documentation and software came with the ArVid device. You‚Äôd typically get:</p>
<ul>
<li>An up-to-date FAQ</li>
<li>User Interface walkthroughs for common operations</li>
<li>Descriptions of the .TDR format which was the ‚Äútable of contents‚Äù for tapes</li>
<li>API descriptions</li>
<li>Data on compatibility with different PCs, VCRs and Tapes</li>
</ul>

<p>I thought it was a ‚ÄúCatch 22‚Äù that you had to buy the device in order to read which VCRs/PCs it was compatible with. How would I know if my system is compatible if I only get this information after purchasing ArVid?</p>
<p>But it turned out that most of the ArVid documents were freely available from BBS systems belonging to PO KSI and authorized dealers. Just set your modem to dial the dealer‚Äôs number between the hours of 8pm and 8am, and you could download all the FAQs before you bought the system.</p>
<p>These BBSs were part of the FidoNet7 network, a Russian <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FidoNet">network of BBSs that used software compatible with FidoNet</a> but independent of its political structure. <a href="https://www.fidonet.us/dummyguide.html">Here is more info about FidoNet</a>.</p>
<p>In 1997, a ‚Äúnewsgroup‚Äù was established at ‚Äú<a href="https://groups.google.com/g/fido7.su.hardw.support.arvid">fido7.su.hardw.support.arvid</a>‚Äù<sup>üá∑üá∫</sup>. There, Mikel Lavrentyev ‚Äì the main ArVid dealer ‚Äì provided support to customers and prospects. There was also an official ArVid website at www.arvid.ru, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19990429075532/http://www.arvid.ru:8080/indexr.htm">now available through the Wayback Machine</a>. In this way, with a patchwork of Web and pre-Web technologies, customers could get close to real-time support. This was quite an accomplishment for a country that was undergoing rapid ‚Äì <strong>and often violent </strong>‚Äì privatization after the Soviet Union collapsed.</p>

<p>While ArVid‚Äôs producers were a small company with a tiny dealer network, they did provide a warranty for the device. The pictured warranty, for a late-model ArVid 105 from 1997, covered 3 years. This was meaningful in a society where everything was uncertain and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1998_Russian_financial_crisis#/media/File:Russian_inflation_rate_1993-2022.webp">inflation from 1993 to 1995 was always higher than 200% a year</a></p>



<h2>Software</h2>



<p>ArVid‚Äôs software could work under the DOS operating system, as well as Windows (3.1, 3.11, 95 and NT), and <a href="https://groups.google.com/g/relcom.comp.os.os2/c/0YaCfLtL7-Y/m/30jI9bTd0NQJ">OS/2</a><sup>üá∑üá∫</sup>. There were unofficial ports for <a href="https://groups.google.com/g/fido7.su.hardw.support.arvid/c/vOE7mg3DvqI/m/ejly3hHz80kJ">Linux</a><sup>üá∑üá∫</sup> and <a href="https://groups.google.com/g/fido7.su.hardw.support.arvid/c/esM2n46Jb_Y/m/ghsbNuFGsdcJ">FreeBSD</a><sup>üá∑üá∫</sup>.</p>



<p>The main User Interface for ArVid resembled the popular filesystem browsing program ‚ÄúNorton Commander‚Äù and made it simple to read and write files from a VHS tape. Other executables that came with the card let the user record Infrared signals for controlling their VCR, to change the configuration parameters, and to re-creating the special ‚Äútable of contents‚Äù file that listed file locations on a particular VHS tape.</p>

<p>The hardware, software, documentation and ‚ÄúAPI‚Äù bundled with ArVid opened a world of possibilities. These were the tools that programmers needed to create their own applications on top of the device. One such programmer was Slava Gostrenko.</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19981202040501/http://www.aha.ru/%7Egw/">Gostrenko created 3 interesting applications</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Arvid Draw</strong> ‚Äì a program that would show the contents of a text file to your ‚ÄúBig Screen‚Äù Television.</li>
<li><strong>Arvid Control</strong> ‚Äì a program that could act on visual signals from a TV broadcast or a surveillance camera. With this program, ArVid owners could do basic object detection / change detection in video signals. These changes could then trigger actions on the PC. The main pitch for it: while recording your favourite shows, the program could pause VCR recording during commercial breaks and resume it when the ads ended. You‚Äôd get commercial-free tapes.</li>
<li><strong>Arvid Audio</strong> ‚Äì a program that used the ArVid system to record audio (3 hours of music on a $2 tape). Audio could be recorded directly from CD, Audio In, or any other source that a SoundBlaster sound card could handle.</li>
</ul>

<p>Below is a set of all the ArVid-related software I could get my hands on. Some of it comes from the <a href="https://rutracker.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=3678449">Rutracker Windows Software torrent tracker</a><sup>üá∑üá∫</sup>, from <a href="http://old-dos.ru/index.php?page=files&amp;mode=files&amp;do=show&amp;id=1996">old-dos.ru</a><sup>üá∑üá∫</sup> , from a <a href="https://disk.yandex.com/d/ocH4tl993Hu4A7">Yandex Disk software dump</a> posted by YouTube user mazalov1972 and whatever dregs I could pull from the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/arvid.ru*">Wayback Machine version of arvid.ru</a> .</p>

<h2>Endgame</h2>



<p>In the summer of 1998 PO KSI stopped producing the ArVid.</p>



<p>Later that year, <a href="https://old.computerra.ru/194873/">an article in the Russian computer journal ‚ÄúComputerra‚Äù</a><sup>üá∑üá∫</sup> claimed that ArVid dropped in popularity because HDD storage and CD-R drives became cheaper. That article‚Äôs author, Andrei Fatkullin, pointed out that ArVid never achieved an ‚Äúeconomy of scale‚Äù. It was always priced at around $80 USD when the alternatives steadily got cheaper. (As an example, the latest ArVid cost <a href="https://groups.google.com/g/relcom.commerce.stocks/c/QVMaX4aqsaM/m/3FFZWLiySAkJ">$79 in 1994</a><sup>üá∑üá∫</sup> and <a href="https://groups.google.com/g/fido7.pvt.exch.pricelist/c/wDVs2uHY8w4/m/1EG4JOyWWIoJ">$90 in 1997</a><sup>üá∑üá∫</sup> while still doing the same fundamental ‚Äújob‚Äù.)</p>



<p>I think Fatkullin is correct about the cause of ArVid‚Äôs death. From my vantage point in 2023 I can see that storage costs have been declining predictably ‚Äì today $82 USD gets you a 2 Terabyte solid-state hard drive. Heck, for $8 USD you can get 128 GB of storage on a USB Stick. This doesn‚Äôt leave any space for a clunky data storage on VHS for $80‚Ä¶</p>



<p>A person who could‚Äôve predicted this decline in price would see that a product in this space has a ‚Äúbuilt-in retirement date‚Äù. VHS always had an upper limit on capacity: PO KSI claimed it was 3.34GB for a 3-hour tape. The last ArVid device hit that ceiling at 325 Kbytes/sec. Using VHS tapes and unreliable domestic VCRs for data storage was a temporary measure. Your home VCR couldn‚Äôt compete with a purpose-built commercial device. It was all just a brilliant hack that let people in a dirt-poor country get massive storage for pennies.</p>



<p>Even in the peak years of 1994-1997 ArVid couldn‚Äôt be more than a niche product: the average consumer couldn‚Äôt even <strong>get</strong> their hands on 2GB worth of digital ‚Äústuff‚Äù. Why would you need a 2GB backup solution when your entire hard drive is just 500 MB in size? The ‚Äúsweet spot‚Äù for ArVid was a small business or an academic organization ‚Äì entities that would drop ArVid and ‚Äúgraduate‚Äù to a more ‚Äúprofessional‚Äù backup solution as soon as they could.</p>



<p>In the <a href="https://www.phantom.sannata.org/viewtopic.php?t=2242&amp;start=33">Sannata forums</a><sup>üá∑üá∫</sup>, user ‚ÄúASL‚Äù says that ArVid was a product that was mostly used by the Fido7 crowd, a small group:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>In those times, the Trio64 cost 40 bucks, while the first Pentium was 100. During our first year at the university, out of our class (120 people), only five students had a computer. Only those who really needed it would pay a hundred for an archiving board. And even then, you had  to know about it <em>(information about it mostly circulated among Fido network users). And that was not a lot of people.</em></p>
</blockquote>



<p>Another factor slowing its spread: this was not a user-friendly device. It required skill to set up, to ‚Äútrain‚Äù for working with your VCR, and to troubleshoot the variety of issues that cropped up along the way‚Ä¶</p>



<p>As for the makers of ArVid, the PO KSI company:</p>



<p>PO KSI is still around and they <a href="http://poksi.ru/homeeng.html">have a website</a>. They <a href="http://poksi.ru/arvid.html">claim that 200,000 ArVid boards were manufactured</a><sup>üá∑üá∫</sup> but that assertion is <a href="https://www.phantom.sannata.org/viewtopic.php?t=2242&amp;start=33">hotly contested</a><sup>üá∑üá∫</sup> based on the analysis of serial numbers on the devices. PO KSI always had multiple product lines to rely on, like digital document scanning equipment and satellite photography devices. </p>



<p>This story doesn‚Äôt have a happy ending.</p>



<p>Russia has a sickly economy, and it does not have <a href="https://www.lexisnexis.com/en-us/rule-of-law/rule-of-law-equation.page">Rule of Law</a>. Entrepreneurs have to find stability and protection from violence ‚Äì and the best way to do so is to get in bed with the government (<a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/shirtless-vladimir-putin-takes-dip-icy-russian-lake/story?id=52450562">the oh-so-sexy government</a>). If <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PO_KSI">you dig deeper</a>, you‚Äôll discover that PO KSI has gone on to supply <a href="https://www.gazeta.ru/politics/2016/12/29_a_10456787.shtml">equipment for the Russian Census and for the military</a><sup>üá∑üá∫</sup>. In December 2016, the <a href="https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2016/12/29/fact-sheet-actions-response-russian-malicious-cyber-activity-and">US White House sanctioned the company</a> for providing specialized training to Russia‚Äôs GRU spy agency.</p>



<p>Post-Soviet Russia in the 1990s was a wild and violent place. For budding computer enthusiasts, this was an exciting time. A time when it was finally possible to get your hands on western technology. A time to take your rightful place on the global Internet. The lack of money meant that you had to get inventive ‚Äì the ArVid backup system was a shining example of this inventiveness, care and skill that could thrive in a chaotic environment. </p>



<p>But no amount of technical ability can change the reality of politics, power and even the national character of Russia. As I write this in 2023, Russian technologists can‚Äôt escape the same bleak choices facing ordinary Russians: escape, hide, persevere‚Ä¶ or collaborate and prosper.</p>

<h3>Was ArVid the first of its kind?</h3>



<p>No. There were several Western products that tried to accomplish the same thing. Storing data on <em>magnetic tape</em> was not a new thing: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic-tape_data_storage">tape was popular in the days of mainframes, and is still used today</a>. It is a cheap and reliable storage medium.</p>



<p>Storing data on <em>domestic VHS tapes</em> was the innovation here. It was also a logical next step from commercial tape technology, but only a few companies tried it and it ended up as a niche curiosity.</p>



<p>There is a long history of storing data on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cassette_tape_data_storage_formats">media meant for domestic <strong>music</strong> playback</a>. The Commodore Datasette devices and the cassette drives for the Atari 400/800 computers used audio cassettes for data storage:</p>

<p>For those who are curious to learn more about digital data storage on analog cassettes, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_cassettes">this Wikipedia page is a good starting point</a>. The main principle is that data ones-and-zeroes can be turned into audio or video signals and stored just like a song or a movie.</p>





<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131019213353/http://blog.modernmechanix.com/the-floppy-rom-software-distributed-on-records/">An extreme example of using a domestic medium for data is the ‚ÄúFloppy ROM‚Äù</a> ‚Äì a flexible <strong>turntable record</strong> that arrived as a magazine insert. You could put it on your record player, and ‚Äúplay‚Äù the programs on it into your computer. (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvXXkB2jic0&amp;t=260s">Here it is on video</a> ‚Äì you can see how thin and soft it is)</p>



<p>Moving from audio media to VHS tape, the Corvus ‚ÄúMirror‚Äù device was one that <a href="https://bitsavers.org/pdf/corvus/brochures/PC_Mirror_Brochure.pdf">could store 91 megabytes of data on a 3-hour tape</a>. In 1980 Corvus filed patent US4380047A for the device. From <a href="http://www.bitsavers.org/pdf/corvus/service/Corvus_Mirror_Service_Manual.pdf">the Corvus Mirror manual</a>, it appears that the product was in-market in 1984. </p>



<p>Youtuber <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSnrQBfBCzY"><em>Technology Connections</em> has a great video about the early days of storing high-fidelity digital audio on VHS tape</a>. At <a href="https://youtu.be/xSnrQBfBCzY?feature=shared&amp;t=837">time 13:57</a>, you can see how effectively proper error-correction algorithms compensated for errors on tape. The audio signal sounds great despite Alec‚Äôs intentional interference with it. This is why the ArVid‚Äôs software had so many error control measures.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19970110151745/http://www.danmere.com/backer.html">Danmere Backer</a> was often compared to the ArVid. It could store 1.5 GB on a 3-hour VHS tape in normal mode and 3GB in long-play.

<h3>Counterfeits</h3>



<p>A passive-aggressive rant in the ArVid FAQ documents mentioned that PO KSI had to deal with ‚Äúfake‚Äù ArVid cards. It appears that older cards ‚Äì the ones that weren‚Äôt based on an FPGA microchip ‚Äì could be hand-soldered from standard components.</p>



<p>Forum user ‚ÄúVintik_33‚Äù on the Sannata forums claims that they participated in a ring that <a href="https://www.phantom.sannata.org/viewtopic.php?t=2242&amp;start=44">made fake etched plates and soldered ArVid clones from components</a><sup>üá∑üá∫</sup>.</p>



<figure><a href="https://jacobfilipp.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/counterfit-ArVid-device.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="689" src="https://jacobfilipp.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/counterfit-ArVid-device-1024x689.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://jacobfilipp.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/counterfit-ArVid-device-1024x689.jpg 1024w, https://jacobfilipp.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/counterfit-ArVid-device-300x202.jpg 300w, https://jacobfilipp.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/counterfit-ArVid-device-768x517.jpg 768w, https://jacobfilipp.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/counterfit-ArVid-device-766x515.jpg 766w, https://jacobfilipp.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/counterfit-ArVid-device.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a><figcaption>An allegedly counterfeit ArVid card (<a href="https://www.phantom.sannata.org/viewtopic.php?t=2242&amp;start=33">source</a>).</figcaption></figure>



<h3>Where would people buy this device in the 90s?</h3>



<p>I spent a long time figuring out how PO KSI advertised these devices to the public. There were no magazine ads. Only a few spammy posts on Fido7‚Ä¶ There were about 5 authorized dealers of the product listed in the FAQs ‚Äì with most of them appearing to be individuals, rather than businesses. One endearing thing I found was a BBS file with prices and <strong>directions to the home </strong>of Mikel Lavrentyev, the primary dealer:</p>


<div>
<figure><a href="https://jacobfilipp.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/pricelist-and-mikel-address.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="619" height="862" src="https://jacobfilipp.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/pricelist-and-mikel-address.png" alt="" srcset="https://jacobfilipp.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/pricelist-and-mikel-address.png 619w, https://jacobfilipp.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/pricelist-and-mikel-address-215x300.png 215w" sizes="(max-width: 619px) 100vw, 619px"></a></figure></div>


<p>In one forum discussion, a user backed their opinion that ArVid had limited sales by stating ‚ÄúI visited Mikel‚Äôs place to pick up my device ‚Äì and it didn‚Äôt look like the home of a high-earning businessman‚Äù.</p>



<p>I believe that knowledge of this product spread by word of mouth. Especially among BBS operators. Mikel, in particular, seemed to be a key member of the Fido7 network of technologists and would have been part of the social scene in the 90s. This method of marketing would‚Äôve been great for staying under the radar of local criminals, but terrible for attracting the public‚Äôs business‚Ä¶</p>



<h3>How much will an ArVid cost me today?</h3>



<p>Nowadays (<em>the year 2023 ‚Äì when men were horses, and horses knew the value of a nickel</em>), a 1052 card sells for $10USD on Meshok.net. I also saw an old computer with an ArVid installed on sale for 18,500 Roubles ‚Äì about $205 USD ‚Äì on Avito.ru. You can search Avito, Meshok and Youla.ru for the Russian word ‚Äú–ê—Ä–≤–∏–¥‚Äù to find it.</p>



<p>Russia is under financial sanctions, so you may have trouble paying for the device and getting it shipped. You might have better luck looking for one on Ukrainian sites. Back in the 90s there was an official dealer in Kiev so there would be a few floating around. Stunningly, even though Ukraine is a warzone I‚Äôve been able to get eBay-bought items from Ukrainian dealers. With real-time shipment tracking and all!<br></p>



<h2>Appendix: list of device models</h2>



<p>The technical specifications are mainly from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010302150207/http://www.arvid.ru:8080/techdata/index.htm">the 2001 version of Arvid.ru</a>, with some notes from me.</p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Arvid 600</strong> <br>Was the first model, possibly internal. Worked only with Toshiba VS-109CZ and used exclusively the VCR‚Äôs time position indexing. But with a move towards supporting a variety of VCRs, Arvid couldn‚Äôt rely on that being present or to work well.<p>‚Äú[AD] The very first Arvids (Arvid-600 model) used only index search. However, they were initially designed only for VCR models Toshiba VS-109CZ, which happened to be in the KSI due to a certain batch. The index search there was quite reliable. The only limitation was that the recording length should not be less than a minute (everywhere ‚Äì closer marks simply would not be recognized as separate). In general, everything worked quite well.‚Äù</p></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Arvid 1000</strong><br>Mentioned in a copyright notice from 1993-1995.

<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>Free play is essential for children‚Äôs development and for their physical, mental, and social health. Opportunities to engage in outdoor free play‚Äîand risky play in particular‚Äîhave declined significantly in recent years, in part because safety measures have sought to prevent all play-related injuries rather than focusing on serious and fatal injuries. Risky play is defined by thrilling and exciting forms of free play that involve<em> </em>uncertainty of outcome and a possibility of physical injury. Proponents of risky play differentiate ‚Äòrisk‚Äô from ‚Äòhazard‚Äô and seek to reframe perceived risk as an opportunity for situational evaluation and personal development. This statement weighs the burden of play-related injuries alongside the evidence in favour of risky play, including its benefits, risks, and nuances, which can vary depending on a child‚Äôs developmental stage, ability, and social and medical context. Approaches are offered to promote open, constructive discussions with families and organizations. Paediatricians are encouraged to think of outdoor risky play as one way to help prevent and manage common health problems such as obesity, anxiety, and behavioural issues.&nbsp;</p>

</div>
<p>Play is essential for children‚Äôs development and for their physical, mental, and social health<sup>[<a href="#ref1">1</a>]</sup>. The right to play is recognized in the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child to be as fundamental as the rights to be cared for and protected from violence<sup>[<a href="#ref2">2</a>]</sup>. Children engaged in free play are also building social and executive functioning skills that are critical for school readiness and lifelong achievement<sup>[<a href="#ref3">3</a>]</sup><sup>[<a href="#ref4">4</a>]</sup>. Over the last several decades, family and social trends have increasingly prioritized the supervision and protection of children. A shift in the balance of play has also occurred, with unscheduled free play outdoors steadily giving way to planned, structured activities, including extra-curriculars and academics, in the lives of most children<sup>[<a href="#ref3">3</a>]</sup><sup>[<a href="#ref5">5</a>]</sup><sup>[<a href="#ref6">6</a>]</sup>. Children are spending more of their recreational time indoors (and often on screens) than playing outside with minimal supervision<sup>[<a href="#ref1">1</a>]</sup>. The 2022 ParticipACTION report card gave Canadian children a ‚ÄòD‚Äô grade for overall physical activity and a ‚ÄòD‚àí‚Äô&nbsp;for active play<sup>[<a href="#ref7">7</a>]</sup>. Many Canadian organizations are now calling for a shift in strategies to keep children ‚Äúas safe as necessary‚Äù rather than ‚Äúas safe as possible‚Äù, and a more balanced approach to healthy and active living that encourages the developmental benefits of risk-taking as well as preventing injury<sup>[<a href="#ref8">8</a>]</sup>.</p>
<p>This statement for paediatric health care providers (HCPs) describes the concept and benefits of outdoor risky play, along with its challenges and nuances related to children‚Äôs developmental stage, individual ability, and social and medical context. Approaches to promote open, constructive discussions with families and organizations are offered. Paediatricians are encouraged to think of outdoor risky play as a strategy to help prevent and manage common health problems such as obesity, anxiety, and behavioural issues<sup>[<a href="#ref9">9</a>]</sup><sup>[<a href="#ref10">10</a>]</sup>.</p>
<h2><strong>What is risky play?</strong></h2>
<p>Risky play is defined by thrilling and exciting forms of free play that involve uncertainty of outcome and a possibility of physical injury<sup>[<a href="#ref11">11</a>]</sup>. Based on evidence gathered over the last 15 years, primarily in children 1 to 13 years of age<sup>[<a href="#ref12">12</a>]</sup>, risky play is often further categorized into various play types (<a href="#Table 1">Table 1</a>)<sup>[<a href="#ref11">11</a>]</sup><sup>[<a href="#ref13">13</a>]</sup>. These categories are purposefully imprecise because activities can differ widely based on a child‚Äôs developmental stage (rather than age), past experience, and personality.</p>

<p><sup><em>Information drawn from references 11,13</em></sup></p>
<p>More specifically, the category of ‚Äúplaying at height‚Äù could involve:</p>
<ul>
<li>A toddler climbing and jumping from a chair,</li>
<li>An older child who feels confident in her/his motor and physical skills climbing a tree, several branches above the ground, or</li>
<li>A child of similar age but with a different temperament, experience, and skill level climbing a small tree or stopping just a few branches above ground.</li>
</ul>
<p>While the play looks different, all three children are engaged in risky play because they feel excited, thrilled, and challenged by their chosen activity.</p>
<p>Risky play is associated most often with activities outdoors or in nature because of the many challenging and creative opportunities for play these settings afford. Play involving natural, loose parts (e.g., gravel, sand, branches) or manufactured materials (e.g., tires, milk crates) that children can use in various ways, without specific direction, likewise supports rich opportunities for risky play<sup>[<a href="#ref14">14</a>]</sup><sup>-</sup><sup>[<a href="#ref16">16</a>]</sup>.</p>
<p><a id="Text box 1" name="Text box 1">Text box 1.</a> <strong>Risky play differentiates hazard from risk</strong></p>
<div>
<p><strong>A risk</strong> arises in situations where a child can recognize and evaluate the challenge and decide on a course of action based on personal preference and self-perceived skill. For example, how high to go on a climbing structure or how fast to run down a slope.</p>
<p>A <strong>hazard</strong> is posed by situations where the potential for injury is beyond the child‚Äôs capacity to recognize it as such or to manage it. For example, an improperly anchored slide could topple under a child‚Äôs weight, or a rotten tree limb may break.</p>
</div>
<p><sup><em>Reference 16</em></sup></p>
<p>Risk is inherent to free play. When children play spontaneously, they may choose to push boundaries and test limits. Risky play encourages creative, spontaneous play, first by eliminating hazards, then by supporting risk-taking that is chosen and controlled by the child and appropriate to her/his experience and ability (<a href="#Text box 1">Text box 1</a>)<sup>[<a href="#ref11">11</a>]</sup>. The concept of risky play is a response, in part, to restrictive safety programs and measures that have become more broadly implemented‚Äîand sometimes mandated‚Äîin child care settings, schools, and playgrounds in recent years. Given the developmental benefits of play-related risk-taking (detailed below), some researchers are advocating for safety rules that effectively prevent serious injury and death while helping children develop risk management strategies that are essential aspects of healthy and active growth<sup>[<a href="#ref1">1</a>]</sup><sup>[<a href="#ref17">17</a>]</sup>.</p>
<p>The literature on risky play has highlighted the need for a balanced approach between risk and hazard, where children‚Äôs overall health and well-being are served by addressing both their developmental and injury prevention needs. Environments such as a busy roadway or rough waters pose hazards that any responsible adult will recognize as hazardous. Yet some activities, like play around fire or rough-and-tumble play, offer a more nuanced relationship between risk and hazard, especially when taking characteristics of the individual child into account. The adult‚Äôs role is to identify hazards and remove or mitigate them, then to supervise appropriately for the type of activity as well as the child‚Äôs skill level, personality, and developmental stage (which may also involve no supervision). The degree of autonomy children have can be determined by how well an adult knows the children at play and their capabilities. Adults should always be ready to intervene when child‚Äôs play becomes a danger to self or others. Preventing children from engaging in risky play experiences is different from intervening in a timely manner that takes their skill level and self-confidence into account.</p>
<p>Risky play is<em> not</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ignoring evidence-based and mandated safety measures (e.g., the use of helmets, car seats, life jackets, stair safety gates)</li>
<li>Leaving children unsupervised in potentially hazardous situations (e.g., street play in traffic areas)</li>
<li>Pushing children to take risks beyond their own comfort level.</li>
</ul>
<p>Debate among researchers and decision-makers regarding the appropriate balance between risk-taking and injury prevention<sup>[<a href="#ref5">5</a>]</sup> has led to the use of other terms besides ‚Äúrisky‚Äù to qualify play. Examples include ‚Äòoutdoor play‚Äô, ‚Äònature play‚Äô, ‚Äòactive play‚Äô, ‚Äòadventurous play‚Äô, and ‚Äòfree‚Äô or ‚Äôunstructured‚Äô play. These terms are defined in the ‚ÄúTerminology and taxonomy of the Play, Learn, and Teach Outdoors-Network (PlaTO-Net)<sup>[<a href="#ref14">14</a>]</sup>. This work standardizes terminology and recognizes that organizations will understand the role and consequences of risk-taking differently and may prefer to use a range of terms to advance conversations about play. However, when children are free to play as they choose, risk is always present, though in different forms, and all descriptive terms imply some measure of risky play.</p>
<h2><strong>The benefits of risky play</strong></h2>
<p>A comprehensive literature search&nbsp;for the effects of risky play on children‚Äôs health, undertaken in March 2022, found ample evidence of benefits for children‚Äôs physical, mental, and social-emotional development, which are detailed below. Systematic reviews focused on the influence of nature and outdoor play on children‚Äôs health found positive relationships with physical activity<sup>[<a href="#ref18">18</a>]</sup><sup>[<a href="#ref19">19</a>]</sup>, well-being <sup>[<a href="#ref16">16</a>]</sup>, and with lowering perceived stress<sup>[<a href="#ref12">12</a>]</sup><sup>[<a href="#ref18">18</a>]</sup><sup>[<a href="#ref20">20</a>]</sup>.</p>
<h3><em>Physical health</em></h3>
<p>Studies that assessed children‚Äôs independent mobility (i.e.,&nbsp;their level of freedom to travel and play in their neighbourhood without adult supervision)<sup>[<a href="#ref21">21</a>]</sup> or the modification of play environments by adding loose parts, natural materials, and opportunities for risk-taking, showed increased levels of moderate to vigorous physical activity per day and decreased sedentary time<sup>[<a href="#ref21">21</a>]</sup><sup>-</sup><sup>[<a href="#ref24">24</a>]</sup>. Risky play may also contribute to supporting engagement in physical activities for life, a concept known as ‚Äòphysical literacy‚Äô, which assumes individuals have the cognitive, affective, and physical skills to ensure lifelong physical activity-related behaviours. Physical literacy interventions have been shown to improve several outcomes related to physical activity and health<sup>[<a href="#ref25">25</a>]</sup> and to reduce the likelihood of injury in sport settings<sup>[<a href="#ref26">26</a>]</sup>. One recent study showed that outdoor play with loose parts provides children with opportunities to develop risk-assessment and fundamental movement skills through repeated movements, which are both components of physical literacy<sup>[<a href="#ref27">27</a>]</sup>.</p>
<p>Risky play may also contribute to modulating the immune system. A study published in 2020 showed that adding plants and natural or loose elements (e.g., logs, barrels, tires) to a daycare yard for digging and climbing led to increased skin bacterial diversity and modified gut microbiota in children (through changes in plasma cytokine levels and T-reg cell frequencies)<sup>[<a href="#ref28">28</a>]</sup>.</p>
<h3><em>Mental and social-emotional health</em></h3>
<p>In addition to the positive effects of adding loose materials to the environment, increasing risk and challenges in school playgrounds can be positive for children‚Äôs mental health. One study of rough-and-tumble play found that allowing this form of play at school led to more reports of pushing and shoving but fewer related to bullying. Rough-and-tumble play may help build resilience and conflict resolution skills in children<sup>[<a href="#ref29">29</a>]</sup>.<sup>&nbsp; </sup>Studies have also associated rough-and-tumble play with better problem-solving scores in boys<sup>[<a href="#ref21">21</a>]</sup>. Following a 3-month school-based intervention providing risky play opportunities, teachers reported lower conflict sensitivity and higher self-esteem and concentration among children in Grade 4<sup>[<a href="#ref30">30</a>]</sup>.</p>
<p>The literature appears to support opportunities for children to recognize and test their limits and tackle new challenges<sup>[<a href="#ref31">31</a>]</sup>. Theoretical papers have suggested that children engaging in risky play will increase their socio-emotional skills and sense of belonging<sup>[<a href="#ref32">32</a>]</sup>. Also, the ability to communicate, cooperate, and compromise with others improves in situations where children can test and push their own limits<sup>[<a href="#ref21">21</a>]</sup><sup>[<a href="#ref32">32</a>]</sup><sup>-</sup><sup>[<a href="#ref34">34</a>]</sup>. Risky play helps facilitate children‚Äôs exposure to fear-provoking situations<sup>[<a href="#ref9">9</a>]</sup><sup>[<a href="#ref17">17</a>]</sup>, providing them with opportunities to experiment with uncertainty, associated physiological arousal, and coping strategies, which can significantly reduce children‚Äôs risk for elevated anxiety<sup>[<a href="#ref9">9</a>]</sup><sup>[<a href="#ref35">35</a>]</sup>.</p>
<h2><strong>Balancing the benefits of risk-taking with the possibility of injury</strong></h2>
<p>Injuries sustained during risky play are usually minor soft tissue injuries such as abrasions, contusions, and lacerations<sup>[<a href="#ref36">36</a>]</sup>. Studies on the incidence of risky play-related injuries have tended to focus on playground equipment height, surfacing, and fall-related injuries, with inconsistent results<sup>[<a href="#ref37">37</a>]</sup><sup>[<a href="#ref38">38</a>]</sup>. One study from New Zealand found fracture frequency and severity (mostly distal forearm) to be unrelated to the height of playground equipment<sup>[<a href="#ref37">37</a>]</sup>. However, a systematic review of risk factors for playground injuries did associate falls from playground equipment higher than 1.5 m with higher fracture odds<sup>[<a href="#ref38">38</a>]</sup>. While some stakeholders have asked for more scientific evidence confirming the safety of risky play<sup>[<a href="#ref39">39</a>]</sup>, the research has established that children are less likely to be injured while engaging in unstructured activities than when playing an organized sport<sup>[<a href="#ref40">40</a>]</sup>.</p>
<p>Head injuries and concussion are particularly concerning in children and youth. While both types of injury are increasing in sport<sup>[<a href="#ref41">41</a>]</sup> and playground environments<sup>[<a href="#ref42">42</a>]</sup>, data on incidence during outdoor risky play are lacking but believed anecdotally to be low. Analysis of the Canadian Hospital Injury Reporting and Prevention Program (CHIRPP) data on proportion of injury types sustained during popular childhood activities between April 2011 and January 2023 was revealing. The injury rate from climbing trees (195 cases per 100,000 CHIRPP records) was between 5 to 22 times lower than for other popular activities, such as indoor and outdoor soccer (4296 cases per 100,000), falls from playground equipment (4090 cases per 100,000), cycling (2816 cases per 100,000), and skateboarding (881 cases per 100,000)<sup>[<a href="#ref43">43</a>]</sup>.<sup>&nbsp; </sup>No child fatalities caused by falling from a tree have been reported in Canada in the past 20 years. Two playground-related fatalities occurred in Canada between 2007 and 2017<sup>[<a href="#ref44">44</a>]</sup>.</p>
<p>Some experts have attributed playground injuries to unexciting play structures. Low structures for all age groups and unnatural surfaces under play structures (e.g., synthetic surfacing rather than grass or sand) may lead to inappropriate equipment use and greater risk-taking<sup>[<a href="#ref1">1</a>]</sup>. Bored children may resort to play&nbsp;indoors or on screens, which also has health consequences<sup>[<a href="#ref5">5</a>]</sup><sup>[<a href="#ref45">45</a>]</sup>.</p>
<h2><strong>Is risky play equally appropriate for all child populations?</strong></h2>
<p>Concerns have been expressed regarding the unequal benefits of risky play for some populations, including Indigenous children, who face disproportionate levels of risk for injury in Canada<sup>[<a href="#ref46">46</a>]</sup>, and children who live in poverty or in marginalized neighborhoods<sup>[<a href="#ref47">47</a>]</sup>. The literature search for this statement did not find an ongoing project or published literature assessing the effects of risky play in First Nations, Inuit, and M√©tis children. Indigenous community perspectives on risky play and how to adapt the concept for their own realities are not yet known.</p>
<p>One Canadian study demonstrated that parents living in a marginalized neighbourhood are often concerned about ‚Äòhaving no extra money for (children‚Äôs)&nbsp;play‚Äô and the ‚Äòphysical safety of play spaces‚Äô<sup>[<a href="#ref47">47</a>]</sup>. A focus group of mothers new to Canada cited discarded needles, homeless people sleeping in parks, and proximity to the sex trade and drug users as barriers to outdoor play. These parents felt pressured to keep children indoors because they did not know and trust their neighborhood environments<sup>[<a href="#ref47">47</a>]</sup>. This research highlights the critical role of community programming, schools, and daycares in providing physical spaces, materials, and human resources toward ensuring safe, equitable access to outdoor play<sup>[<a href="#ref47">47</a>]</sup>.</p>
<p>Children with disabilities can benefit from engaging in risky play. A study demonstrated that over-protection and lowered expectations of children with a medical condition or disability can reduce their self-esteem and sense of ‚Äòbelonging‚Äô as well as impede independence<sup>[<a href="#ref48">48</a>]</sup>. Encouraging children with a disability to engage in manageable risk-taking (i.e., activities they can assess for risk and control themselves) can promote autonomy and self-responsibility, and reduce social exclusion<sup>[<a href="#ref49">49</a>]</sup><sup>[<a href="#ref50">50</a>]</sup>.</p>
<p>More research on the benefits and challenges of risky play for select populations is needed. In the meantime, however, making sure to include all children in risky play initiatives by accommodating and adapting play environments should be prioritized.</p>
<h2><strong>Reframing perceptions of risk</strong></h2>
<p>Protecting children from harm while ensuring their access to the opportunities and benefits of risky play can be challenging for parents, child care settings, and public policy-makers. Adults are responsible for providing the safe physical spaces and emotionally supportive environments that may also invite and optimize opportunities for spontaneous risky play. Such opportunities may include supervising children less closely (e.g., accepting that a child may climb higher, without a restraining hand or remaining at arm's length to break a fall). Ensuring there is time in a child‚Äôs schedule for free play, encouraging play with natural, loose parts (e.g., sticks, branches, or rocks), and allowing rough-and-tumble play are key conditions.</p>
<p>Communication and language around risk-taking is another factor that parents and educators may need to adapt in support of risky play. Cautions like ‚ÄòBe careful‚Äô, ‚ÄòAre you sure this is a good idea?‚Äô, ‚ÄòSlow down‚Äô, and ‚ÄòNot too high‚Äô are often heard when supervising children. While caring adults usually mean ‚ÄòI love you‚Äô, ‚ÄòI care about you‚Äô, or ‚ÄòI worry about you‚Äô, children who are cautioned repeatedly may learn to hear: ‚ÄòYou don‚Äôt trust me‚Äô or ‚ÄòYou don‚Äôt think I can do it‚Äô. Innocuous cautions, repeated often over time, can convey fear even when there is little or no danger present. Also, such ‚Äòwatchwords‚Äô do not offer guidance for managing play in a risky situation, which can (again, used repeatedly over time) negatively influence children‚Äôs confidence in their own skills and decrease the appeal of active play<sup>[<a href="#ref50">50</a>]</sup>.</p>
<p>Some experts have suggested that parents practice pausing for 15 to 30 seconds to observe children‚Äôs ‚Äòstate of play‚Äô before intervening<sup>[<a href="#ref51">51</a>]</sup>. The length of this pause depends on the individual child, situation, and activity being observed. When parents do intervene, their first focus can be on raising a child‚Äôs awareness of a situation or behaviour, then helping the child to manage a predicament or problem-solve (<a href="#Text box 2">Text box 2</a>).</p>

<h2><strong>Facilitating risky play opportunities for children</strong></h2>
<p>A 2012 review prioritized risky play for Canadian children based on extensive international experience<sup>[<a href="#ref1">1</a>]</sup>. In 2015, a multi-sectoral, inter-disciplinary group of active and healthy living, injury prevention, and insurance and legal experts published the first Canadian position statement on active outdoor play and promoting the implementation of risky play<sup>[<a href="#ref8">8</a>]</sup>. The Canadian Childcare Federation, the Canadian Public Health Association, and the Council of Chief Medical Officers of Health have also addressed the need for unstructured risky play in position statements<sup>[<a href="#ref35">35</a>]</sup><sup>[<a href="#ref52[53">52[53</a>]</sup>. They, along with some provincial/territorial governments, have called for a shift in strategy to keep children ‚Äúas safe as necessary‚Äù rather than ‚Äúas safe as possible‚Äù. The YMCA mandated risky play training for their child care staff in Canada and have shared the experience of rolling out this initiative at their website<sup>[<a href="#ref54">54</a>]</sup>.</p>
<p>Tools for parents, early childhood educators, teachers, designers, and administrators to help with the implementation of outdoor risky play follow the recommendations<sup>[<a href="#ref35">35</a>]</sup><sup>[<a href="#ref44">44</a>]</sup><sup>[<a href="#ref55">55</a>]</sup><sup>-</sup><sup>[<a href="#ref62">62</a>]</sup>.</p>
<h2><strong>Recommendations </strong></h2>
<p>Child health care providers are well positioned to talk with families about the benefits of outdoor risky play for children‚Äôs development, healthy and active living, and social-emotional well-being.</p>
<p>To help shift the emphasis of children‚Äôs play toward greater risk-tolerance, paediatricians and other child health care providers are encouraged to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Educate families about the benefits of risky play as part of counselling and resource-sharing, alongside injury prevention, healthy eating, and purposeful screen time.</li>
<li>Add risky play to their ‚Äòclinical toolbox‚Äô to help prevent or manage obesity, anxiety, and behavioural issues.</li>
<li>‚ÄòPrescribe‚Äô active outdoor free play as an alternative to recommending an optimal number of hours of exercise per day or week.</li>
<li>Help parents reframe their language around risk and hazard as children play.</li>
</ul>
<p>Public health authorities and government policy-makers should:</p>
<ul>
<li>Support early childhood educators (ECEs), teachers, municipal authorities, and community organizers with evidence for the benefits of spontaneous outdoor play, and funding to introduce and build on opportunities for risky play.</li>
<li>Help community, child care, and school settings comply with mandatory safety standards while improving opportunities for risky play.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Help advocate locally‚Äîwith child care settings, schools, and public parks¬≠‚Äîto enrich children‚Äôs play experiences by adding loose parts and natural elements and ensuring equitable access to risky play opportunities.</li>
<li>Help fund training for ECEs, school authorities, and community advocates regarding the benefits of risky play and how to optimize local opportunities to promote play, starting with these&nbsp;resources.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</li>

The firm has filed cases against platforms including Meta, Snap, TikTok, and Discord.</p><p>Bergman, who has been practicing law since 1991,<strong> </strong>had a storied career in asbestos litigation before turning his attention to social media. Inspired by the testimony of Facebook whistleblower <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/oct/24/frances-haugen-i-never-wanted-to-be-a-whistleblower-but-lives-were-in-danger" data-link-name="in body link">Frances Haugen</a>, Berman said he noticed a number of parallels between social media and asbestos. Both are products initially thought to be beneficial before being exposed as detrimental to human health, he said. The corporations involved brazenly tried to cover up the harms they knew were coming, he added.</p><p>‚ÄúThe confluence of these things made me think that this really was asbestos all over again,‚Äù Bergman said. ‚ÄúI saw this as an opportunity to do something different with my legal career ‚Äì something more proactive.‚Äù</p><p>Lawsuits against social media firms over alleged harms have long struggled to see their day in court due to section 230 of the 1996 Communications Decency Act, a federal law in the US that shields online platforms from liability for illegal actions of their users. With this in mind, Bergman took on a different tack, modeled after his days in asbestos litigation. Rather than arguing against content on the platforms, his firm leans on product liability laws and argues that the products are harmful by design.</p><p>‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not winning yet ‚Äì we‚Äôre just getting in the game,‚Äù Bergman said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs clear that this is going to be a long, hard fight.‚Äù</p><p>The Guardian spoke with Bergman about similarities between his history in asbestos litigation, his present focus on social media firms and his expectations for the upcoming Senate hearing.</p><p><strong>Can you start by talking about how the Social Media Victims Law Center came to exist?</strong></p><p>I founded the Social Media Victims Law Center in the fall of 2021. I had spent a career recovering money for injured victims, including over $1bn for asbestos victims over more than 20 years. But I reached the stage in life where I wanted to do something to not just compensate victims, but to stop people from becoming victims in the first place.</p><p>It coincided with the testimony of Francis Haugen before the Senate commerce committee, where she for the first time made clear what a lot of us suspected: that social media companies knowingly design products to addict kids ‚Äì as well as the surgeon general‚Äôs <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2023/05/23/surgeon-general-issues-new-advisory-about-effects-social-media-use-has-youth-mental-health.html" data-link-name="in body link">advisory on the youth mental health crisis</a> in the US, and around the world.</p><p><strong>What similarities have you seen between your career in asbestos litigation and your efforts to take on social media harms?</strong></p><p>These were some of the same dynamics that I had litigated in asbestos ‚Äì namely, a ubiquitous product that is at least initially seen as a very good thing. When social media first came out, they thought this was going to save the world, that it was going to be a change for the better. With social media, like asbestos, you have a cause-and-effect relationship between a product and a disease manifesting in terms of a public health crisis. Whereas asbestos was the largest industrial carcinogen that was ever exposed to workers around the world, with social media we see a public health crisis emerging in the form of youth mental health and suicidality, as well as sexual abuse arising from social media.</p><p>As in asbestos, you also have outrageous corporate misconduct. The reason the asbestos companies took the hits that they did was because their documents showed that they knowingly exposed workers to a product that they had actual knowledge was going to kill them. And what we‚Äôve seen from the social media companies is the same level of culpability. You look at Francis Haugen‚Äôs documents and see that they know their products make <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/nov/07/meta-facebook-employee-congress-testimony-instagram-child-harm-social-media" data-link-name="in body link">young girls feel worse</a> and give kids an addict‚Äôs mentality. We are seeing the same kinds of smoking gun documents that we saw in asbestos litigation.</p><p><strong>I know you‚Äôve talked about a lot of the similarities between your asbestos litigation and social media. Are there any key differences or changes you‚Äôve had to make to strategy?</strong></p><p>One of the key differences is that in asbestos litigation, the outrageous misconduct typically occurred decades before the manifestation of the disease in the exposed worker, whereas there is no latency period with social media.</p><p>The other difference is that we‚Äôre talking about young, vulnerable kids. The generation of clients that I previously represented ‚Äì while they didn‚Äôt know about asbestos, they understood they may have to work a dangerous job to put food on the table for their family. In this case, the exposed cohort are kids that, by virtue of basic neurology, do not have the reasoning power to make that kind of cost-benefit analysis.</p><p>The third major difference is that nobody is addicted to asbestos. People worked around it without knowing about it. In this case, we know that social media is addictive. We thought until about a year ago that this was a behavioral addiction, but new evidence is suggesting that there is an actual physiological addiction and that among adolescents, there‚Äôs differential brain development in the hypothalamus based upon frequency of social media use.</p><p>I think these differences make social media much more morally reprehensible than asbestos ‚Äì which is a hard thing to say, because I spent a career representing people who were dying because of asbestos companies‚Äô misconduct. But I always say the conduct of the social media industry makes the asbestos companies and their CEOs look like a bunch of Boy Scouts.</p><figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement"><a data-ignore="global-link-styling" href="#EmailSignup-skip-link-20">skip past newsletter promotion</a><p id="EmailSignup-skip-link-20" tabindex="0" aria-label="after newsletter promotion" role="note">after newsletter promotion</p></figure><p><strong>What about their behavior makes you say that? Is it just that they‚Äôre targeting such a vulnerable group of victims, or is it their legal strategies?</strong></p><p>Well, they‚Äôre addicting kids and they know it. They know the dopamine response diminishes over time as a young brain becomes habituated to particular stimuli, so the algorithms are designed to provide more and more discordant, disturbing and outrageous material in order to keep that level of engagement.</p><p>The other is that they are intentionally designed to take advantage of adolescents‚Äô need for social acceptance and social status with gamification features such as Snap streaks, or how many friends you have, or how often you are engaged with directly. We now understand that the dopamine response to a ‚Äúlike‚Äù on social media for a 14-year-old is a similar response to a bump of cocaine of an older person. So it is not only a physiological process, but also a sociological process.</p><p><strong>Could you speak generally about your legal strategies with social media firms and how they are different from people attempting to go up against these companies in the past?</strong></p><p>Past attempts have focused more on inadequate content moderation ‚Äì that the companies allowed a third party to post bullying, harassment or salacious content and didn‚Äôt remove it. That falls within traditional publishing protections, which are protected by section 230, so the courts have held up until now. To get around this, you‚Äôd have to focus on the design, which is what we are trying to do.</p><p><strong>Is this strategy similar to your asbestos career, in terms of focusing on failure to warn and product liability?</strong></p><p>Yes, the theory behind product liability is that you place the duty of creating a safe product in the hands of the party most able to make that product safe to manufacture. It‚Äôs basic Milton Friedman, Richard Posner economics; it‚Äôs not liberal woo-woo stuff.</p><p>What we are doing is seeking to adapt 1950s product liability concepts to 21st century products ‚Äì by definition, it‚Äôs pouring old wine into new bottles, but that‚Äôs what lawyers do.</p><p><strong>You‚Äôve talked a lot about your background with asbestos, but is there any other precedent for the kind of movement we‚Äôre seeing against </strong><strong>big </strong><strong>tech? I‚Äôve seen it compared to tobacco and opioids.</strong></p><p>Just as social media companies have designed their algorithms to be addictive, we know tobacco companies knowingly manipulated nicotine levels in their products to make them more addictive ‚Äì so there is a similarity there. The other similarity is that the tobacco companies marketed to young people, because they knew that lifetime smokers are often people that start smoking in their teens.</p><p><strong>It feels like there is generally a lot more support from both the public and legislators to rein in </strong><strong>big </strong><strong>tech recently, compared to the more free</strong><strong>wheeling early days of the internet. Why do you think the tide is turning on that?</strong></p><p>When the internet came out, it was greeted with a lot of optimism ‚Äì we thought it was this thing that was going to bring people together, and make us a closer and more prosperous society. The addictiveness of the algorithmic design was really unknown. One of the reasons for that is because these companies have operated under this veil of immunity [due to section 230] and avoid the kind of public scrutiny that other companies have.</p><p>It took a while for the harms associated with social media to publicly manifest and be identified. In the 90s, there was a landmark hearing in which CEOs of tobacco companies stood in front of Congress and testified they did not believe that nicotine was addictive. I think the upcoming hearing has the possibility of the same level of historic significance ‚Äì and hopefully, the same level of cure.</p></div></div>]]></description>

  <span><time datetime="2013-05-29">29 May 2013</time></span>
  <p>Since I haven't published anything in almost two months, let me jot down one thought that has come to mind frequently over the past few months.</p>
<h2>If you use LaTeX ‚Ä¶</h2>
<p>Well, first of all, are you sure you <em>have to</em> use LaTeX? By which I mean, are you sure you can't use Markdown+MathJax or textile+MathJax or restructuredText+MathJax? Especially if you're teaching your students, are you absolutely sure you are completely and utterly unable to use something simpler? Something that is more modern than learning a hundred bits of print typesetting that your student will never, ever need? Ok, just checking. So‚Ä¶</p>
<h2>If you (have to) use LaTeX, then make HTML your primary output.</h2>
<p>By which I mean: don't just produce PDFs that nobody can read on small screens, PDFs that nobody can read accessibly, PDFs that nobody will want to read in 5 years.</p>
<p>Make HTML your first output. It's important. HTML is the future engine for mathematical and scientific content. If you can't produce HTML, then ur doin it rong. If you don't produce HTML, you won't ever help all the people working on pushing math on the web forward.</p>
<p>It won't be trivial but easier than you think. Install <a href="http://dlmf.nist.gov/LaTeXML/a">LaTeXML</a> and learn how to use it. (Alternatively you probably have a copy of tex4ht installed with your TeX.) How hard is it? This hard:</p>
<pre><code>  latexml --dest=mydoc.xml mydoc.tex
  latexmlpost --dest=mydoc.html --format=html5 mydoc.xml
</code></pre>
<p>And when you run into LaTeXML limitations, then get over it, <a href="http://dlmf.nist.gov/LaTeXML/contact.html">report them back</a>, help make it better. If you run into problems with MathJax, <a href="https://github.com/mathjax/mathjax/issues">report them</a>, help make it better. You need graphics? Check out <a href="https://github.com/sonoisa/XyJax">xyjax</a>. You need pstricks? Check out <a href="http://mathapedia.com/">mathapedia</a>. You need computations? Check out <a href="http://www.sagemath.org/eval.html">Sage cell server</a>. It's all there, but you have to get started. To it today.</p>
<p>But if you've ever wanted math to be native on the web, then you have to realize that it <strong>won't happen without your help</strong>.</p>
<p>If you're too lazy for converting (e.g., when you're teaching), then use something that compiles to both TeX and HTML (like markdown+MathJax etc). Pick a decent tool for it, like <a href="http://www.inkcode.net/qute">Qute</a>, <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/retext/">ReText</a>, write on the web with <a href="http://fiduswriter.com/">FidusWriter</a> or <a href="http://authorea.com/">Authorea.com</a>, write in your favorite Mac-editor with <a href="http://markedapp.com/">Marked</a>, or <a href="https://github.com/revolunet/sublimetext-markdown-preview">extend sublimetext</a>, on an iPad app use <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/writing-kit-research-write/id426208994">Writing Kit</a> -- and that's just off the top of my head; there are many more editing environments that offer good syntax and MathJax integration. Many can save to TeX documents, anything can be converted via <a href="http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/">pandoc</a>. It's not perfect yet but it won't get better unless you give everybody some feedback.</p>
<p>So, if you can, don't author LaTeX, author <em>into</em> LaTeX. And whatever you do, compile it to HTML. It's important.</p>

<p><em>Comments</em></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>michalh21</strong>, 2013/05/30<br>
For LaTeX to html conversion, I would really recommend tex4ht, its problem is fragmentation of documentation, some information is completely missing, but on the other side it can convert any LaTeX document, it can be even configured to convert tikz pictures to svg, or to output math as <a href="http://www.albany.edu/~hammond/demos/Html5/arXiv/" rel="nofollow">mathml with mathjax rendering</a><br>
I think it is a good idea to output html for people who wants to read on tablets or smart phones, but personally, I still prefer to read PDFs, even on my laptop or PC. For me, PDF has advantage in better readability. HTML even with most recent trends like web fonts and responsive typography is still far behind PDF in this regard. Other advantage is pagination, it helps me with orientation in document. Maybe not so many readers pay attention to such things today, but I think majority of writers in LaTeX wouldn't like how bad their documents look in HTML.<br>
And last point :) I don't really think LaTeX is hard. For things that markdown etc. supports, like sections, tables, links or footnotes, it is only few commands to learn, every editor today supports snippets for fast inserting these commands, you can use templates for document preamble etc. And when you want to use things like referencing, bibliographies, indexing, glossaries etc, using LaTeX is much easier. Plus, for new functionality, you can write your own macros, which is easier than modifying markdown parser and inventing new syntax :)
<ul>
<li><strong>Peter</strong>, 2013/06/06<br>
Thanks for your comments. tex4ht is certainly a nice and powerful tool. But there‚Äôs a fundamental difference: it‚Äôs really a dvi-to-html converter, not a LaTeX-to-html one. That allows it to circumvent a lot of problems (by letting the TeX binary do all the hard work) but also comes with losses since LaTeX is semantically richer than TeX/DVI (something that‚Äôs visible in the quality of the MathML output last time I tried it).<br>
I understand that most people find PDFs better. IMO, HTML has much more potential than PDF to provide a better reading experience, with rich content and easy interaction with other web content (and of course PDFs are virtually inaccessible). My main point was merely that we won‚Äôt get there if we don‚Äôt get started. Authors, in any case, should care more about their readers than their own reading experience. They can, after all, produce whatever they like for themselves whereas a reader rarely has that option. (Personally, I prefer my handwritten notes but that won‚Äôt help anyone given my illegible hand writing)<br>
I‚Äôm definitely not trying to tell people what they should use. Certainly, an experienced user often finds LaTeX the most flexible and powerful tool (TeX is a programming language, after all). But this power brings an awful lot of problems with it and in almost all situation that power is not needed. So I do like to argue for the right tool for the job instead, especially in educational settings ‚Äî and above all, I would like to argue for conversion. No tool or format is perfect. But any content that cannot be converted to something else is (for better or worse) at a dead end.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Norman Lewis Perlmutter</strong>, 2013/06/04<br>
Given that LaTeX already compiles into pdf, might it be better to use or develop a pdf to html converter? This would have the added benefit of being able to convert pdf files not generated by LaTeX into html.
<ul>
<li><strong>Peter</strong>, 2013/06/06<br>
The short answer is: no. PDF is a very ‚Äúloss-ful‚Äù format. The only way to extract e.g. mathematical content is by using heuristics, i.e., guessing from the placement what kind of expression was actually used. While converters like pdf.js do a good job at reproducing the layout, they do not really convert to HTML, they merely render it (much like a printer) ‚Äî the output is inaccessible, doesn‚Äôt reflow well etc. TeX to HTML is already very solid and used in big publishing houses. Automatic conversion is perhaps at 95% ‚Äî but to get to 100% (which is needed), the open source projects out there need feedback.<br>
Since the conversion from for strictly mathematical TeX to MathML is very solid, it‚Äôs much easier to go directly anyway. The only remaining problem are the messy packages, in particular the graphical packages that could either be converted to static graphics (like LaTeXML or tex4ht do) or re-implemented in javascript (like xyjax or mathapedia).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>jessemckeown</strong>. 2013/06/06<br>
Well, I‚Äôm doing my very little bit, then; since you mention it, though, is there any plan to eventually absorb xyjax into the main mathjax? AMScd does do the arrows nicer than putting <code>\to</code> and <code>\downarrow</code> in a <code>\begin{array}\end{array}</code>, but‚Ä¶
<ul>
<li><strong>jessemckeown</strong>, 2013/06/06<br>
Oh, I forgot to make sure of the right website‚Ä¶</li>

<p><img alt="AMD" src="https://www.phoronix.com/assets/categories/amd.webp" width="100" height="100"></p><p>
With the AMD Ryzen 7040 series "Ryzen AI" was introduced as leveraging Xilinx IP onboard the new Zen 4 mobile processors. Ryzen AI is beginning to work its way out to more processors while <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/news/AMD-Ryzen-AI-Open-Source-Demo">it hasn't been supported on Linux</a>. Then in October was <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/news/Ryzen-AI-For-Linux-Requests">AMD wanting to hear from customer requests around Ryzen AI Linux support</a>. Well, today they did their first public code drop of the XDNA Linux driver for providing open-source support for Ryzen AI.
</p><p>
More than 1,000 requests for Linux support were logged following that October statement and since then I've been hearing quietly of AMD working on Linux support... Well, there's now an open-source but currently out-of-tree driver available. The XDNA driver will work with AMD Phoenix/Strix SoCs so far having Ryzen AI onboard. AMD has tested the driver to work on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS but you will need to be running the Linux 6.7 kernel or newer with IOMMU SVA support enabled. The Xilinx XRT software also needs to be built to work with this kernel driver. So far is a simple test script for verifying that your driver stack is currently setup.
</p><p><a href="https://www.phoronix.com/image-viewer.php?id=2024&amp;image=amd_xdna_linux_lrg" target="_blank"><img src="https://www.phoronix.net/image.php?id=2024&amp;image=amd_xdna_linux_med" alt="AMD XDNA Linux driver"></a></p>
<p>Those wanting to check out this XDNA open-source Linux driver can find it via <a href="https://github.com/amd/xdna-driver">amd/xdna-driver on GitHub</a>.
</p><p><img src="https://www.phoronix.net/image.php?id=2023&amp;image=ryzen_ai_1" alt="AMD Ryzen AI"></p>
<p>The documentation doesn't yet outline any upstreaming plans they have for this driver to get it into the mainline kernel or if they will just be maintaining it out-of-tree or what all their Linux support plans entail. In any event I'll be working on getting more information about their Ryzen AI / XDNA Linux plans for future article(s) on Phoronix as well as getting to trying this driver out once knowing the software support expectations.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>The study, led by Canadian federal scientists, adds to other research that found Alberta's oil sands were underreporting climate changing carbon emissions.</p><div id="details-body" data-words="524" itemprop="articleBody">
        <p>Aircraft flying over Alberta‚Äôs oil sands have found emissions of organic carbon ‚Äî a primary driver of air pollution ‚Äî between 1,900 per cent and 6,300 per cent higher than industry has reported.</p>

<p>That‚Äôs more than all the organic carbon pollution emitted across Canada combined, according to the new study, led by Canadian federal scientists and published in the journal Science Thursday.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Drew Gentner, a researcher at Yale University‚Äôs Department of Chemical and Environmental Engineering and one of 24 co-authors of&nbsp;the&nbsp;study, said the previously unaccounted for emissions from the Athabasca oil sands were largely made up of volatile organic compounds overlooked in routine monitoring. He said they were surprised by the massive gap.&nbsp;</p>

<p>‚ÄúThese compounds are important reactive chemicals in the atmosphere with implications for air quality and the environment,‚Äù said Gentner.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Those compounds react with sunlight to produce fine particulate matter ‚Äî which is linked to major health and climate effects ‚Äî and gases like ozone, a key component of smog and leading cause of pollution in Canadian cities.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Organic carbon pollution levels were found to be more than 1,500 per cent higher than U.S. mega-cities like Los Angeles, Calif., a city long known for smog.</p>

<p>Ozone has also been known to reduce wheat crop yields by up to a third, costing agriculture&nbsp;in East Asia up to US$63 billion a year, according to one 2022 <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43016-021-00422-6" target="_blank">study</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>‚ÄúDepending on the pollutant, air quality impacts can span from nearby communities in the region (e.g., Fort&nbsp;McMurray, Indigenous communities) to downwind impacts on humans and the environment,‚Äù said Gentner in an email.</p>

<p>Past monitoring has failed to capture the full scope of organic carbon pollution because it wasn‚Äôt looking at a diverse enough range of molecular sizes often associated with heavy oil and bitumen deposits. Such deposits&nbsp;are expected to account for 40 per cent of global oil production by 2040, the study found.&nbsp;</p>

<p>With an estimated 1.7 trillion barrels of oil, the Alberta oil sands make up most of Canada‚Äôs oil production and a large share of its carbon pollution.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Study the latest evidence industry is underreporting&nbsp;emissions</h3>

<p>In a <a href="https://academic.oup.com/pnasnexus/article/2/5/pgad140/7127723?login=false" target="_blank">study</a> released last April, some of the same researchers at Environment and Climate Change Canada used aircraft, satellite and historical data to reassess climate changing emissions from the oil sands.&nbsp;</p>

<p>They found the oil-producing region could be producing 31 million tonnes of unreported carbon dioxide into the atmosphere every year ‚Äî 65 per cent higher than industry reported.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The latest study found organic carbon pollution to be 20 to 64 times greater than&nbsp;reported in Canada‚Äôs National Pollutant Release Inventory, which is required the report the entire range of volatile organic compounds. That‚Äôs 13 per cent more than Canada‚Äôs entire annual output of organic carbon emissions.</p>

<p>‚ÄúMeasured [volatile organic compounds] only account for a fraction of total measured organic carbon,‚Äù said the study.</p>

<p>‚ÄúThus, the oil sands sector alone represents a dominant fraction of country-wide gas-phase organic carbon emissions, even when only including the facilities studied here.‚Äù&nbsp;</p>

<p>The researchers concluded that current surveillance of organic carbon pollution would need to change if Canada were to accurately report the full air quality and environmental impacts of the oil sands operations.&nbsp;</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><h2>Command-line Tools can be 235x Faster than your Hadoop Cluster</h2><h3 id="introduction"><a href="#introduction">Introduction</a></h3><p>As I was browsing the web and catching up on some sites I visit periodically, I found a cool article from <a href="https://tomhayden3.com/2013/12/27/chess-mr-job/">Tom Hayden</a> about using <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/elasticmapreduce/">Amazon Elastic Map Reduce</a> (EMR) and <a href="https://github.com/Yelp/mrjob">mrjob</a> in order to compute some statistics on win/loss ratios for chess games he downloaded from the <a href="https://www.top-5000.nl/pgn.htm">millionbase archive</a>, and generally have fun with EMR. Since the data volume was only about 1.75GB containing around 2 million chess games, I was skeptical of using Hadoop for the task, but I can understand his goal of learning and having fun with mrjob and EMR. Since the problem is basically just to look at the result lines of each file and aggregate the different results, it seems ideally suited to stream processing with shell commands. I tried this out, and for the same amount of data I was able to use my laptop to get the results in about 12 seconds (processing speed of about 270MB/sec), while the Hadoop processing took about 26 minutes (processing speed of about 1.14MB/sec).</p><p>After reporting that the time required to process the data with 7 c1.medium machine in the cluster took 26 minutes, Tom remarks</p><blockquote><p>This is probably better than it would take to run serially on my machine but probably not as good as if I did some kind of clever multi-threaded application locally.</p></blockquote><p>This is absolutely correct, although even serial processing may beat 26 minutes. Although Tom was doing the project for fun, often people use Hadoop and other so-called <em>Big Data (tm)</em> tools for real-world processing and analysis jobs that can be done faster with simpler tools and different techniques.</p><p>One especially under-used approach for data processing is using standard shell tools and commands. The benefits of this approach can be massive, since creating a data pipeline out of shell commands means that all the processing steps can be done in parallel. This is basically like having your own <a href="https://storm-project.net/">Storm</a> cluster on your local machine. Even the concepts of Spouts, Bolts, and Sinks transfer to shell pipes and the commands between them. You can pretty easily construct a stream processing pipeline with basic commands that will have extremely good performance compared to many modern <em>Big Data (tm)</em> tools.</p><p>An additional point is the batch versus streaming analysis approach. Tom mentions in the beginning of the piece that after loading 10000 games and doing the analysis locally, that he gets a bit short on memory. This is because all game data is loaded into RAM for the analysis. However, considering the problem for a bit, it can be easily solved with streaming analysis that requires basically no memory at all. The resulting stream processing pipeline we will create will be over 235 times faster than the Hadoop implementation and use virtually no memory.</p><h3 id="learn-about-the-data"><a href="#learn-about-the-data">Learn about the data</a></h3><p>The first step in the pipeline is to get the data out of the PGN files. Since I had no idea what kind of format this was, I checked it out on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Game_Notation">Wikipedia</a>.</p><pre tabindex="0"><code>[Event "F/S Return Match"]

</code></pre><p>We are only interested in the results of the game, which only have 3 real outcomes. The 1-0 case means that white won, the 0-1 case means that black won, and the 1/2-1/2 case means the game was a draw. There is also a <em>-</em> case meaning the game is ongoing or cannot be scored, but we ignore that for our purposes.</p><h3 id="acquire-sample-data"><a href="#acquire-sample-data">Acquire sample data</a></h3><p>The first thing to do is get a lot of game data. This proved more difficult than I thought it would be, but after some looking around online I found a git repository on GitHub from <a href="https://github.com/rozim/ChessData">rozim</a> that had plenty of games. I used this to compile a set of 3.46GB of data, which is about twice what Tom used in his test. The next step is to get all that data into our pipeline.</p><h3 id="build-a-processing-pipeline"><a href="#build-a-processing-pipeline">Build a processing pipeline</a></h3><p><em>If you are following along and timing your processing, don‚Äôt forget to clear your OS page cache as otherwise you won‚Äôt get valid processing times.</em></p><p>Shell commands are great for data processing pipelines because you get parallelism for free. For proof, try a simple example in your terminal.</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="bash"><span><span>sleep <span>3</span> | echo <span>"Hello world."</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Intuitively it may seem that the above will sleep for 3 seconds and then print <code>Hello world</code> but in fact both steps are done at the same time. This basic fact is what can offer such great speedups for simple non-IO-bound processing systems capable of running on a single machine.</p><p>Before starting the analysis pipeline, it is good to get a reference for how fast it could be and for this we can simply dump the data to <code>/dev/null</code>.</p><p>In this case, it takes about 13 seconds to go through the 3.46GB, which is about 272MB/sec. This would be a kind of upper-bound on how quickly data could be processed on this system due to IO constraints.</p><p>Now we can start on the analysis pipeline, the first step of which is using <code>cat</code> to generate the stream of data.</p><p>Since only the result lines in the files are interesting, we can simply scan through all the data files, and pick out the lines containing ‚ÄòResults‚Äô with <code>grep</code>.</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="bash"><span><span>cat *.pgn | grep <span>"Result"</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This will give us only the <code>Result</code> lines from the files. Now if we want, we can simply use the <code>sort</code> and <code>uniq</code> commands in order to get a list of all the unique items in the file along with their counts.</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="bash"><span><span>cat *.pgn | grep <span>"Result"</span> | sort | uniq -c
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This is a very straightforward analysis pipeline, and gives us the results in about 70 seconds. While we can certainly do better, assuming linear scaling this would have taken the Hadoop cluster approximately 52 minutes to process.</p><p>In order to reduce the speed further, we can take out the <code>sort | uniq</code> steps from the pipeline, and replace them with AWK, which is a wonderful tool/language for event-based data processing.</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="bash"><span><span>cat *.pgn | grep <span>"Result"</span> | awk <span>'{ split($0, a, "-"); res = substr(a[1], length(a[1]), 1); if (res == 1) white++; if (res == 0) black++; if (res == 2) draw++;} END { print white+black+draw, white, black, draw }'</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This will take each result record, split it on the hyphen, and take the character immediately to the left, which will be a 0 in the case of a win for black, a 1 in the case of a win for white, or a 2 in the case of a draw. Note that <code>$0</code> is a built-in variable that represents the entire record.</p><p>This reduces the running time to approximately 65 seconds, and since we‚Äôre processing twice as much data this is a speedup of around 47 times.</p><p>So even at this point we already have a speedup of around 47 with a naive local solution. Additionally, the memory usage is effectively zero since the only data stored is the actual counts, and incrementing 3 integers is almost free in memory space terms. However, looking at <code>htop</code> while this is running shows that <code>grep</code> is currently the bottleneck with full usage of a single CPU core.</p><h3 id="parallelize-the-bottlenecks"><a href="#parallelize-the-bottlenecks">Parallelize the bottlenecks</a></h3><p>This problem of unused cores can be fixed with the wonderful <code>xargs</code> command, which will allow us to parallelize the <code>grep</code>. Since <code>xargs</code> expects input in a certain way, it is safer and easier to use <code>find</code> with the <code>-print0</code> argument in order to make sure that each file name being passed to <code>xargs</code> is null-terminated. The corresponding <code>-0</code> tells <code>xargs</code> to expected null-terminated input. Additionally, the <code>-n</code> how many inputs to give each process and the <code>-P</code> indicates the number of processes to run in parallel. Also important to be aware of is that such a parallel pipeline doesn‚Äôt guarantee delivery order, but this isn‚Äôt a problem if you are used to dealing with distributed processing systems. The <code>-F</code> for <code>grep</code> indicates that we are only matching on fixed strings and not doing any fancy regex, and can offer a small speedup, which I did not notice in my testing.</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="bash"><span><span>find . -type f -name <span>'*.pgn'</span> -print0 | xargs -0 -n1 -P4 grep -F <span>"Result"</span> | gawk <span>'{ split($0, a, "-"); res = substr(a[1], length(a[1]), 1); if (res == 1) white++; if (res == 0) black++; if (res == 2) draw++;} END { print NR, white, black, draw }'</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This results in a run time of about 38 seconds, which is an additional 40% or so reduction in processing time from parallelizing the <code>grep</code> step in our pipeline. This gets us up to approximately 77 times faster than the Hadoop implementation.</p><p>Although we have improved the performance dramatically by parallelizing the <code>grep</code> step in our pipeline, we can actually remove this entirely by having <code>awk</code> filter the input records (lines in this case) and only operate on those containing the string ‚ÄúResult‚Äù.</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="bash"><span><span>find . -type f -name <span>'*.pgn'</span> -print0 | xargs -0 -n1 -P4 awk <span>'/Result/ { split($0, a, "-"); res = substr(a[1], length(a[1]), 1); if (res == 1) white++; if (res == 0) black++; if (res == 2) draw++;} END { print white+black+draw, white, black, draw }'</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>You may think that would be the correct solution, but this will output the results of <strong>each</strong> file individually, when we want to aggregate them all together. The resulting correct implementation is conceptually very similar to what the MapReduce implementation would be.</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="bash"><span><span>find . -type f -name <span>'*.pgn'</span> -print0 | xargs -0 -n4 -P4 awk <span>'/Result/ { split($0, a, "-"); res = substr(a[1], length(a[1]), 1); if (res == 1) white++; if (res == 0) black++; if (res == 2) draw++ } END { print white+black+draw, white, black, draw }'</span> | awk <span>'{games += $1; white += $2; black += $3; draw += $4; } END { print games, white, black, draw }'</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>By adding the second awk step at the end, we obtain the aggregated game information as desired.</p><p>This further improves the speed dramatically, achieving a running time of about 18 seconds, or about 174 times faster than the Hadoop implementation.</p><p>However, we can make it a bit faster still by using <a href="https://invisible-island.net/mawk/mawk.html">mawk</a>, which is often a drop-in replacement for <code>gawk</code> and can offer better performance.</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="bash"><span><span>find . -type f -name <span>'*.pgn'</span> -print0 | xargs -0 -n4 -P4 mawk <span>'/Result/ { split($0, a, "-"); res = substr(a[1], length(a[1]), 1); if (res == 1) white++; if (res == 0) black++; if (res == 2) draw++ } END { print white+black+draw, white, black, draw }'</span> | mawk <span>'{games += $1; white += $2; black += $3; draw += $4; } END { print games, white, black, draw }'</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This <code>find | xargs mawk | mawk</code> pipeline gets us down to a runtime of about 12 seconds, or about 270MB/sec, which is around 235 times faster than the Hadoop implementation.</p><h3 id="conclusion"><a href="#conclusion">Conclusion</a></h3><p>Hopefully this has illustrated some points about using and abusing tools like Hadoop for data processing tasks that can better be accomplished on a single machine with simple shell commands and tools. If you have a huge amount of data or really need distributed processing, then tools like Hadoop may be required, but more often than not these days I see Hadoop used where a traditional relational database or other solutions would be far better in terms of performance, cost of implementation, and ongoing maintenance.</p><a href="https://brid.gy/publish/mastodon"></a>

<p>NASA‚Äôs history-making Ingenuity Mars Helicopter has ended its mission at the Red Planet after surpassing expectations and making dozens more flights than planned. While the helicopter remains upright and in communication with ground controllers, imagery of its Jan. 18 flight sent to Earth this week indicates one or more of its rotor blades sustained damage during landing, and it is no longer capable of flight.</p>
<p>Originally designed as a technology demonstration to perform up to five experimental test flights over 30 days, the first aircraft on another world operated from the Martian surface for almost three years, performed 72 flights, and flew more than 14 times farther than planned while logging more than two hours of total flight time.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe historic journey of Ingenuity, the first aircraft on another planet, has come to end,‚Äù said NASA Administrator Bill Nelson. ‚ÄúThat remarkable helicopter flew higher and farther than we ever imagined and helped NASA do what we do best ‚Äì make the impossible, possible. Through missions like Ingenuity, NASA is paving the way for future flight in our solar system and smarter, safer human exploration to Mars and beyond.‚Äù</p>
<p><strong>NASA to Discuss Ingenuity Mission in Media Call Today</strong><em></em></p>
<p>In addition to video comments shared from Nelson about the mission‚Äôs conclusion, NASA will host a media teleconference at 5 p.m. EST today, Thursday, Jan. 25, to provide an update on Ingenuity Mars Helicopter.</p>
<p>Audio of the call will stream live on the agency‚Äôs <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/nasatv">website</a>.</p>
<p>Participants in the call are expected to include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lori Glaze, director, Planetary Science Division, NASA‚Äôs Science Mission Directorate at the agency‚Äôs headquarters in Washington</li>
<li>Laurie Leshin, director, NASA‚Äôs Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California</li>
<li>Teddy Tzanetos, Ingenuity project manager, NASA JPL</li>
</ul>
<p>Media who wish to participate by phone can request dial-in information by emailing <a href="mailto:hq-media@mail.nasa.gov">hq-media@mail.nasa.gov</a>.</p>
<p>Ingenuity landed on Mars Feb. 18, 2021, attached to the belly of NASA‚Äôs Perseverance rover and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMnOo2zcjXA" rel="noopener">first lifted off</a> the Martian surface on April 19, proving that powered, controlled flight on Mars was possible. After notching another four flights, it embarked on a new mission as an <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/nasas-ingenuity-helicopter-to-begin-new-demonstration-phase" rel="noopener">operations demonstration</a>, serving as an <a href="https://mars.nasa.gov/resources/26251/mars-mound-from-ingenuity-helicopters-perspective-in-3d/" rel="noopener">aerial scout</a> for Perseverance scientists and rover drivers. In 2023, the helicopter executed two successful flight tests that further expanded the team‚Äôs knowledge of its aerodynamic limits.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAt NASA JPL, innovation is at the heart of what we do,‚Äù said Leshin. ‚ÄúIngenuity is an exemplar of the way we push the boundaries of what‚Äôs possible every day. I‚Äôm incredibly proud of our team behind this historic technological achievement and eager to see what they‚Äôll invent next.‚Äù&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ingenuity‚Äôs team planned for the helicopter to make a short vertical flight on Jan. 18 to determine its location after executing an emergency landing on its previous flight. Data shows that, as planned, the helicopter achieved a maximum altitude of 40 feet (12 meters) and hovered for 4.5 seconds before starting its descent at a velocity of 3.3 feet per second (1 meter per second).</p>
<p>However, about 3 feet (1 meter) above the surface, Ingenuity lost contact with the rover, which serves as a communications relay for the rotorcraft. The following day, communications were reestablished and more information about the flight was relayed to ground controllers at NASA JPL. Imagery revealing damage to the rotor blade arrived several days later. The cause of the communications dropout and the helicopter‚Äôs orientation at time of touchdown are still being investigated.</p>



<p><strong>Triumphs, Challenges</strong></p>



<p>Over an extended mission that lasted for almost 1,000 Martian days, more than 33 times longer than originally planned, Ingenuity was upgraded with the ability to <a href="https://mars.nasa.gov/resources/27173/ingenuitys-hazard-avoidance-capability/" rel="noopener">autonomously choose landing sites</a> in treacherous terrain, dealt with a <a href="https://mars.nasa.gov/technology/helicopter/status/385/keeping-our-sense-of-direction-dealing-with-a-dead-sensor/" rel="noopener">dead sensor</a>, cleaned itself after <a href="https://mars.nasa.gov/technology/helicopter/status/366/dusty-flight-19-completed-and-looking-ahead-to-flight-20/" rel="noopener">dust storms</a>, operated from 48 different airfields, performed three emergency landings, and survived a frigid Martian winter.</p>



<p>Designed to operate in spring, Ingenuity was unable to power its heaters throughout the night during the coldest parts of winter, resulting in the flight computer periodically freezing and resetting. These power ‚Äúbrownouts‚Äù required the team to <a href="https://mars.nasa.gov/technology/helicopter/status/382/ingenuity-adapts-for-mars-winter-operations/" rel="noopener">redesign Ingenuity‚Äôs winter operations</a> in order to keep flying.</p>



<p>With flight operations now concluded, the Ingenuity team will perform final tests on helicopter systems and download the remaining imagery and data in Ingenuity‚Äôs onboard memory. The Perseverance rover is currently too far away to attempt to image the helicopter at its final airfield.</p>



<p>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs humbling Ingenuity not only carries onboard a <a href="https://images.nasa.gov/details/PIA24291" rel="noopener">swatch</a> from the original Wright Flyer, but also this helicopter followed in its footsteps and proved flight is possible on another world,‚Äù said Ingenuity‚Äôs project manager, Teddy Tzanetos of NASA JPL. ‚ÄúThe Mars helicopter would have never flown once, much less 72 times, if it were not for the passion and dedication of the Ingenuity and Perseverance teams. History‚Äôs first Mars helicopter will leave behind an indelible mark on the future of space exploration and will inspire fleets of aircraft on Mars ‚Äì and other worlds ‚Äì for decades to come.‚Äù</p>



<p><strong>More About Ingenuity</strong></p>



<p>The Ingenuity Mars Helicopter was built by NASA JPL, which also manages the project for NASA Headquarters. It is supported by NASA‚Äôs Science Mission Directorate. NASA‚Äôs Ames Research Center in California‚Äôs Silicon Valley and NASA‚Äôs Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia, provided significant flight performance analysis and technical assistance during Ingenuity‚Äôs development. AeroVironment Inc., Qualcomm, and SolAero also provided design assistance and major vehicle components. Lockheed Space designed and manufactured the&nbsp;<a href="https://mars.nasa.gov/resources/25081/testing-the-mars-helicopter-delivery-system/" rel="noopener">Mars Helicopter Delivery System</a>. At NASA Headquarters, Dave Lavery is the program executive for the Ingenuity Mars helicopter.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
	<p><span><span>A</span></span> historic new study out of Scotland shows the real-world impact of vaccines against the human papillomavirus: The country has detected no cases of cervical cancer in women born between 1988-1996 who were fully vaccinated against HPV between the ages of 12 and 13.</p>
<p>Many previous studies have shown that HPV vaccines are <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2023/11/08/hpv-vaccines-cancer-screenings/">extremely effective</a> in preventing cervical cancer. But the study, published on Monday in the <a href="https://academic.oup.com/jnci/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/jnci/djad263/7577291?redirectedFrom=fulltext&amp;login=true#no-access-message" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Journal of the National Cancer Institute</a>, is the first to monitor a national cohort of women over such a long time period and find no occurrence of cervical cancer.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe study is super exciting. It shows that the vaccine is extremely effective,‚Äù said Kathleen Schmeler, a professor of gynecologic oncology at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, who was not involved in the research. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs obviously early. We‚Äôre just starting to see the first data of the impact of the vaccine because it takes so long from the time of the vaccine to the effects.‚Äù</p>
<p>The results underscore the importance of working to increase uptake of the HPV vaccine in the U.S., said Schmeler. Scotland, for example, introduced routine immunization in schools in 2008, and <a href="https://publichealthscotland.scot/publications/hpv-immunisation-statistics-scotland/hpv-immunisation-statistics-scotland-school-year-202223/#:~:text=Coverage%20of%20the%20completed%20one,%2C%20a%20difference%20of%200.7%25." target="_blank" rel="noopener">close to 90%</a> of students in their fourth year of secondary school (equivalent to 10th grade in the U.S.) in the 2022-2023 school year had received at least one dose of the vaccine. <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/72/wr/mm7234a3.htm#:~:text=In%202022%2C%2089.9%25%20of%20adolescents,HPV%20vaccination%20(HPV%20UTD)." target="_blank" rel="noopener">In the U.S.</a>, where HPV vaccines are not administered in school, uptake among adolescents ages 13 to 17 is a little over 60%.</p>
		
		
<p>The study also points to how crucial the timing of vaccination is. ‚ÄúThe girls that didn‚Äôt develop any cancer were vaccinated before becoming sexually active,‚Äù said Schlemer. ‚ÄúSo we should not wait to vaccinate folks and really do it, for the guidelines, prior to becoming sexually active.‚Äù</p>
<h2>The benefits of receiving the HPV vaccine before age 14</h2>
<p>The authors of the Scotland study monitored the records of all women born between 1988 and 1996 who were eligible for cancer screening, about 450,000 women. Of that group, 40,000 were vaccinated between the ages of 12 and 13, and 124,000 received the vaccines at or after 14 years of age. The remaining women, nearly 300,000, were not vaccinated.</p>
<p>No cases of cervical cancer were found among the women who were vaccinated before they turned 14, even if they had only received one or two doses of the vaccine rather than the full, three-dose protocol. Also noteworthy is that women who received the three-dose protocol between the ages of 14 and 22 also benefited significantly. While some cases of cervical cancer were recorded in this group, the incidence (3.2 cases per 100,000 women) was two and a half times lower than among unvaccinated women (8.4 cases per 100,000 women).</p>
		
		
<p>‚ÄúI was very surprised that there were no cases‚Äù of cancer in the group who received vaccines before 14, said Tim Palmer, the former clinical lead for cervical screening in Scotland and an HPV immunization consultant at Public Health Scotland, who was a lead author of the study. ‚ÄúIn that age group, I expected about 15 to 17 a year in Scotland ‚Äî and we have had none.‚Äù</p>
<p>The types of vaccine administered to the cohorts monitored in the study changed as newer ones became available, covering more types of HPV. Until 2012, the vaccine in use was the bivalent Cervarix, targeting HPV 16 and 18. Then the quadrivalent Gardasil was administered until 2023, when the nonavalent Gardasil 9 was introduced.</p>
<p>This is why it‚Äôs still possible that cervical cancers may still arise even in vaccinated women, caused by the HPV strains not targeted by the earlier vaccines. ‚ÄúThere are obviously other HPV types that cause cancer,‚Äù Palmer said, noting that the current results don‚Äôt mean cases of cervical cancers, caused by less high-risk strains of HPV, won‚Äôt emerge in the analyzed cohort in the future.</p>
		
		
<p>The study‚Äôs findings don‚Äôt diminish the need for continued screenings for early detection of cervical cancers caused by HPV types that were not targeted in the original bivalent vaccine, said Palmer, but the vaccines effectively targeted the more aggressive strains of HPV (16 and 18).</p>
<p>The impact of the vaccination was also greater among women of lower socioeconomic status, who otherwise reported higher occurrences of cancer, said Palmer.</p>
<p>Ville Pimenoff, a senior researcher at the Karolinska Institutet and professor at the University of Oulu in Finland, published the results of a large cohort study in Finland <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2023/11/08/hpv-vaccines-cancer-screenings/">in November 2023</a>, which showed the effectiveness of cohort vaccination in creating herd immunity against HPV. He said the results from Scotland confirm his findings. ‚ÄúWhen you vaccinate in a cohort way, there seems to be very strong, protective immunity in those communities,‚Äù said Pimenoff, who was not involved in the Scottish study.</p>

Specifically, developers can shorten embeddings (i.e. remove some numbers from the end of the sequence) without the embedding losing its concept-representing properties by passing in the <code>dimensions</code> API parameter. For example, on the MTEB benchmark, a <code>text-embedding-3-large</code> embedding can be shortened to a size of 256 while still outperforming an unshortened <code>text-embedding-ada-002</code> embedding with a size of 1536.<br></p></div><!--]--><!--[--><div layout="auto" data-v-8a4788d5="" id="NewEmbeddingsModelsAndAPIUpdatesSizeScoreComparison-10"><table data-v-8a4788d5=""><thead data-v-8a4788d5=""><tr data-v-8a4788d5=""><td data-v-8a4788d5=""></td><td data-v-8a4788d5="">ada v2</td><td colspan="2" data-v-8a4788d5="">text-embedding-3-small</td><td colspan="3" data-v-8a4788d5="">text-embedding-3-large</td></tr></thead><tbody data-v-8a4788d5=""><tr data-v-8a4788d5=""><td data-v-8a4788d5="">Embedding size</td><td data-v-8a4788d5="">1536</td><td data-v-8a4788d5="">512</td><td data-v-8a4788d5="">1536</td><td data-v-8a4788d5="">256</td><td data-v-8a4788d5="">1024</td><td data-v-8a4788d5="">3072</td></tr><tr data-v-8a4788d5=""><td data-v-8a4788d5="">Average MTEB score</td><td data-v-8a4788d5="">61.0</td><td data-v-8a4788d5="">61.6</td><td data-v-8a4788d5="">62.3</td><td data-v-8a4788d5="">62.0</td><td data-v-8a4788d5="">64.1</td><td data-v-8a4788d5="">64.6</td></tr></tbody></table></div><!--]--><!--[--><div><p>This enables very flexible usage.

        <div>
             
                 <div><span>CUPERTINO, CALIFORNIA</span>&nbsp;Apple today announced changes to iOS, Safari, and the App Store impacting developers‚Äô apps in the European Union (EU) to comply with the Digital Markets Act (DMA). The changes include more than 600 new APIs, expanded app analytics, functionality for alternative browser engines, and options for processing app payments and distributing iOS apps. Across every change, Apple is introducing new safeguards that reduce ‚Äî but don‚Äôt eliminate ‚Äî new risks the DMA poses to EU users. With these steps, Apple will continue to deliver the best, most secure experience possible for EU users.
</div>
                 
             
                 <div>The new options for processing payments and downloading apps on iOS open new avenues for malware, fraud and scams, illicit and harmful content, and other privacy and security threats. That‚Äôs why Apple is introducing protections ‚Äî including Notarization for iOS apps, an authorization for marketplace developers, and disclosures on alternative payments ‚Äî to reduce risks and deliver the best, most secure experience possible for users in the EU. Even with these safeguards in place, many risks remain.
</div>
                 
             
                 <div>Developers can learn about these changes on the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/support/dma-and-apps-in-the-eu/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-analytics-exit-link="">Apple Developer Support page</a><span> and can begin&nbsp;testing&nbsp;new capabilities today in the iOS 17.4 beta. The new capabilities will become available to users in the 27 EU countries beginning in March 2024.</span>
</div>
                 
             
                 <div>‚ÄúThe changes we‚Äôre announcing today comply with the Digital Markets Act‚Äôs requirements in the European Union, while helping to protect EU users from the unavoidable increased privacy and security threats this regulation brings. Our priority remains creating the best, most secure possible experience for our users in the EU and around the world,‚Äù said Phil Schiller, Apple Fellow. ‚ÄúDevelopers can now learn about the new tools and terms available for alternative app distribution and alternative payment processing, new capabilities for alternative browser engines and contactless payments, and more. Importantly, developers can choose to remain on the same business terms in place today if they prefer.‚Äù
</div>
                 
             
                 <div>The changes for EU apps reflect the European Commission‚Äôs designation of iOS, Safari, and the App Store as ‚Äúcore platform services‚Äù under the Digital Markets Act. In March, Apple will share new resources to help EU users understand the changes they can expect. That includes guidance to help EU users navigate complexities the DMA‚Äôs changes bring ‚Äî including a less intuitive user experience ‚Äî and best practices for approaching new risks associated with downloading apps and processing payments outside of the App Store.
</div>
                 
             
                 <div>Available for developers‚Äô apps around the world, Apple also announced <a href="https://developer.apple.com/news/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-analytics-exit-link="">new options for streaming games</a>, along with more than 50 forthcoming reports in areas like engagement, commerce, app usage, and more.
</div>
                 
             
                 <h2>Changes to iOS
</h2>
                 
             
                 <div>In the EU, Apple is making a number of changes to iOS to comply with the DMA. For developers, those changes include new options for distributing apps. The coming changes to iOS in the EU include:
</div>
                 
             
                 <div><ul>
<li><strong>New options for distributing iOS apps from alternative app marketplaces</strong><span> ‚Äî including new APIs and tools that enable developers to offer their iOS apps for download from alternative app marketplaces.</span></li>
</ul>
</div>
                 
             
                 <div><ul>
<li><strong>New framework and APIs for creating alternative app marketplaces</strong> ‚Äî enabling marketplace developers to install apps and manage updates on behalf of other developers from their dedicated marketplace app.</li>
</ul>
</div>
                 
             
                 <div><ul>
<li><strong>New frameworks and APIs for alternative browser engines</strong> ‚Äî enabling developers to use browser engines, other than WebKit, for browser apps and apps with in-app browsing experiences.</li>
</ul>
</div>
                 
             
                 <div><ul>
<li><strong>Interoperability request form</strong> ‚Äî where developers can submit additional requests for interoperability with iPhone and iOS hardware and software features.</li>
</ul>
</div>
                 
             
                 <div>As announced by the European Commission, Apple is also sharing DMA-compliant changes impacting contactless payments. That includes new APIs enabling developers to use NFC technology in their banking and wallet apps throughout the European Economic Area. And in the EU, Apple is introducing new controls that allow users to select a third-party contactless payment app ‚Äî or an alternative app marketplace ‚Äî as their default.
</div>
                 
             
                 <div>Inevitably, the new options for developers‚Äô EU apps create new risks to Apple users and their devices. Apple can‚Äôt eliminate those risks, but within the DMA‚Äôs constraints, the company will take steps to reduce them. These safeguards will be in place when users download iOS 17.4 or later, beginning in March, and include:
</div>
                 
             
                 <div><ul>
<li><strong>Notarization for iOS apps</strong> ‚Äî a baseline review that applies to all apps, regardless of their distribution channel, focused on platform integrity and protecting users. Notarization involves a combination of automated checks and human review.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
</div>
                 
             
                 <div><ul>
<li><strong>App installation sheets</strong> ‚Äî that use information from the Notarization process to provide at-a-glance descriptions of apps and their functionality before download, including the developer, screenshots, and other essential information.</li>
</ul>
</div>
                 
             
                 <div><ul>
<li><strong>Authorization for marketplace developers</strong> ‚Äî to ensure marketplace developers commit to ongoing requirements that help protect users and developers.</li>
</ul>
</div>
                 
             
                 <div><ul>
<li><strong>Additional malware protections</strong> ‚Äî that prevent iOS apps from launching if they‚Äôre found to contain malware after being installed to a user‚Äôs device.</li>
</ul>
</div>
                 
             
                 <div>These protections ‚Äî including Notarization for iOS apps, and authorization for marketplace developers ‚Äî help reduce some of the privacy and security risks to iOS users in the EU. That includes threats like malware or malicious code, and risks of installing apps that misrepresent their functionality or the responsible developer.
</div>
                 
             
                 <div>However, Apple has less ability to address other risks ‚Äî including apps that contain scams, fraud, and abuse, or that expose users to illicit, objectionable, or harmful content. In addition, apps that use alternative browser engines ‚Äî other than Apple‚Äôs WebKit ‚Äî may negatively affect the user experience, including impacts to system performance and battery life.
</div>
                 
             
                 <div>Within the DMA‚Äôs constraints, Apple is committed to protecting the privacy, security, and quality of the iOS user experience in the EU as much as possible. For instance, App Tracking Transparency will continue to work with apps distributed outside of the App Store ‚Äî asking a user‚Äôs permission before a developer tracks their data across apps or websites. However, the DMA‚Äôs requirements mean that App Store features ‚Äî including Family Purchase Sharing and Ask to Buy ‚Äî will not be compatible with apps downloaded from outside of the App Store.
</div>
                 
             
                 <div>When these changes come into effect in March, Apple will share more detailed resources explaining the options available to users ‚Äî including best practices for protecting their privacy and security.
</div>
                 
             
                 <h2>Changes to Safari
</h2>
                 
             
                 <div>Today, iOS users already have the ability to set a third-party web browser ‚Äî other than Safari ‚Äî as their default. Reflecting the DMA‚Äôs requirements, Apple is also introducing a new choice screen that will surface when users first open Safari in iOS 17.4 or later. That screen will prompt EU users to choose a default browser from a list of options.
</div>
                 
             
                 <div>This change is a result of the DMA‚Äôs requirements, and means that EU users will be confronted with a list of default browsers before they have the opportunity to understand the options available to them. The screen also interrupts EU users‚Äô experience the first time they open Safari intending to navigate to a webpage.

                 <h2>Changes to the App Store
</h2>
                 
             
                 <div>On the App Store, Apple is sharing a number of changes for developers with apps in the EU, affecting apps across Apple‚Äôs operating systems ‚Äî including iOS, iPadOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS. The changes also include new disclosures informing EU users of the risks associated with using alternatives to the App Store‚Äôs secure payment processing.
</div>
                 
             
                 <div>For developers, those changes include:<br>
</div>
                 
             
                 <div><ul>
<li><strong>New options for using payment service providers (PSPs)</strong> ‚Äî within a developer‚Äôs app to process payments for digital goods and services.</li>
</ul>
</div>
                 
             
                 <div><ul>
<li><strong>New options for processing payments via link-out </strong>‚Äî where users can complete a transaction for digital goods and services on the developer‚Äôs external website. Developers can also inform EU users of promotions, discounts, and other deals available outside of their apps.</li>
</ul>
</div>
                 
             
                 <div><ul>
<li><strong>Business planning tools </strong>‚Äî for developers to estimate fees and understand metrics associated with Apple‚Äôs new business terms for apps in the EU.</li>
</ul>
</div>
                 
             
                 <div>The changes also include new steps to protect and inform EU users, including:
</div>
                 
             
                 <div><ul>
<li><strong><em></em>App Store product page labels</strong> ‚Äî that inform users when an app they‚Äôre downloading uses alternative payment processing.</li>
</ul>
</div>
                 
             
                 <div><ul>
<li><strong><em></em>In-app disclosure sheets</strong> ‚Äî that let users know when they are no longer transacting with Apple, and when a developer is directing them to transact using an alternative payment processor.</li>
</ul>
</div>
                 
             
                 <div><ul>
<li><strong><em></em>New</strong> <strong>App Review processes</strong> ‚Äî to verify that developers accurately communicate information about transactions that use alternative payment processors.</li>
</ul>
</div>
                 
             
                 <div><ul>
<li><strong>Expanded data portability on Apple‚Äôs Data &amp; Privacy site </strong>‚Äî where EU users can retrieve new data about their usage of the App Store and export it to an authorized third party.</li>
</ul>
</div>
                 
             
                 <div>For apps that use alternative payment processing, Apple will not be able to issue refunds, and will have less ability to support customers encountering issues, scams, or fraud. Helpful App Store features ‚Äî like Report a Problem, Family Sharing, and Ask to Buy ‚Äî will also not reflect these transactions. Users may have to share their payment information with additional parties, creating more opportunities for bad actors to steal sensitive financial information. And on the App Store, users‚Äô purchase history and subscription management will only reflect transactions made using the App Store‚Äôs In-App Purchase system.
</div>
                 
             
                 <h2>New Business Terms for Apps in the EU
</h2>
                 
             
                 <div>Also today, Apple is sharing new business terms available for developers‚Äô apps in the European Union. Developers can choose to adopt these new business terms, or stay on Apple‚Äôs existing terms. Developers must adopt the new business terms for EU apps to use the new capabilities for alternative distribution or alternative payment processing.
</div>
                 
             
                 <div>The new business terms for apps in the EU are necessary to support the DMA‚Äôs requirements for alternative distribution and payment processing. That includes a fee structure that reflects the many ways Apple creates value for developers‚Äô businesses ‚Äî including distribution and discovery on the App Store, the App Store‚Äôs secure payment processing, Apple‚Äôs trusted and secure mobile platform, and all the tools and technology to build and share innovative apps with users around the world.
</div>
                 
             
                 <div>Developers operating under either set of business terms can continue to use the App Store‚Äôs secure payment processing and share their apps on the App Store in the EU. And both sets of business terms reflect Apple‚Äôs long-standing work to make the app ecosystem the best opportunity for all developers.
</div>
                 
             
                 <div>Developers operating under the new business terms will have the option to distribute their iOS apps from the App Store and/or alternative app marketplaces. These developers can also choose to use alternative payment processors in their EU apps on the App Store, across Apple‚Äôs operating systems.
</div>
                 
             
                 <div>The new business terms for iOS apps in the EU have three elements:
</div>
                 
             
                 <div><ul>
<li><strong>Reduced commission</strong> ‚Äî iOS apps on the App Store will pay a reduced commission of either 10 percent (for the vast majority of developers, and subscriptions following their first year) or 17 percent on transactions for digital goods and services.</li>
</ul>
</div>
                 
             
                 <div><ul>
<li><strong><em></em>Payment processing fee</strong> ‚Äî iOS apps on the App Store can use the App Store‚Äôs payment processing for an additional 3 percent fee. Developers can use a payment service provider within their app or link users to their website to process payments for no additional fee to Apple.</li>
</ul>
</div>
                 
             
                 <div><ul>
<li><strong><em></em>Core Technology Fee</strong> ‚Äî iOS apps distributed from the App Store and/or an alternative app marketplace will pay ‚Ç¨0.50 for each first annual install per year over a 1 million threshold.</li>
</ul>
</div>

      CVE-2023-40547 - avoid incorrectly trusting HTTP headers
    </p>

    <div><pre>When retrieving files via HTTP or related protocols, shim attempts to
allocate a buffer to store the received data.  Unfortunately, this means
getting the size from an HTTP header, which can be manipulated to
specify a size that's smaller than the received data.  In this case, the
code accidentally uses the header for the allocation but the protocol
metadata to copy it from the rx buffer, resulting in an out-of-bounds
write.

This patch adds an additional check to test that the rx buffer is not
larger than the allocation.

Resolves: CVE-2023-40547

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section><h2 id="what-does-a-database-have-to-do-with-ai-anyway">What does a database have to do with AI, anyway?</h2><p>After a truly new technology arrives, it makes the future a lot harder to predict. The one thing you can be sure of is that you‚Äôre probably not going to continue in the same straight line that you‚Äôve been traveling. The truly impactful destinations are often just on the other side of a mountain that you can‚Äôt yet see the top of. This is also what makes technology so terrifying: once the mist clears you might find yourself in a totally new landscape without a map.</p><p>At MotherDuck, we‚Äôre excited about ways that AI can be used to help give people superpowers to understand their data. Someone with access to modern Google search would have looked like a wizard to people just a few decades ago; now we take it for granted that you can instantly settle any bet about how old is Morgan Freeman or when was the last time the Seattle Mariners won the World Series. Similarly, AI has the potential to divide the world into ‚Äúthings you did before AI‚Äù and ‚Äúthings you did afterwards.‚Äù</p><p>It was pretty clear to us that AI was already changing how people interact with their data when one of our early users mentioned they were spending a lot of their time cutting and pasting between ChatGPT and the MotherDuck query UI. That seems super inefficient, and since then we‚Äôve been trying to figure out how to shorten feedback loops and make data practitioners better at their jobs. Any time you have to leave the query you‚Äôre writing to check documentation, it distracts you from all of the details you‚Äôre keeping track of in your head.</p><p>Two weeks ago, in order to help analysts stay focused on their SQL, we <a href="https://motherduck.com/blog/introducing-fixit-ai-sql-error-fixer/">launched ‚ÄúFixIt,‚Äù</a> a feature that can pinpoint which line in your query has an error and suggest a fix. While ‚ÄúFixIt‚Äù is pretty simple, it can be surprisingly helpful. Instead of having to look up syntax for things like window functions with trailing averages or timestamp differencing, I can just write the SQL I think should work; if I get the ordering of arguments wrong, misspell something, or use the wrong quote type, ‚ÄúFixIt‚Äù will automatically write it correctly.</p><p>This week we‚Äôre taking the next step; in conjunction with <a href="https://www.numbersstation.ai/">Numbers Station</a>, we‚Äôre open sourcing a DuckDB specific text-to-SQL LLM. Our goal here is to give back to the DuckDB community and help seed interesting DuckDB applications. For the moment, we‚Äôve chosen to trade off some expressivity for faster and less expensive inference by using a small-ish model size. If this turns out to be an interesting area we will follow up more.</p><p>We hope that you‚Äôll come along with us as we continue to explore the ways that AI can make it easier to solve problems with data.</p></section>
<section><h2 id="about-duckdb-nsql">About DuckDB-NSQL</h2><p>We currently provide <a href="https://motherduck.com/docs/key-tasks/using-ml-to-query/">text-to-SQL functionality</a> within MotherDuck, using OpenAI‚Äôs most powerful models, that are doing exceptionally well on text-to-SQL <a href="https://yale-lily.github.io/spider">benchmarks</a> and have been proven useful in practice. We do, however, see a need for more lightweight models that enable DucKDB SQL assistance features at lower latency. Upon reviewing existing open models for text-to-SQL, we came to the realization that existing models and benchmarks primarily focus on analytical queries / SELECT statements.</p><p>Beyond fast analytical querying using regular SQL, a significant part of DuckDB's appeal lies in its <a href="https://duckdb.org/2022/05/04/friendlier-sql.html#group-by-all">friendly SQL</a> syntax, support for <a href="https://duckdb.org/docs/sql/data_types/overview#nesting">nested types</a>, varied <a href="https://duckdb.org/docs/data/overview">data import</a> options, and its diverse ecosystem of <a href="https://duckdb.org/docs/archive/0.9.2/extensions/overview">extensions</a>. Among others, extensions for querying Postgres, SQLite, and Iceberg tables, and support for JSON and GeoSpatial types.</p><p>We believe that text-to-SQL in the context of DuckDB is particularly useful if the model can help users leverage the full power of DuckDB, without having to go forth-and-back between the DuckDB documentation and the SQL shell. We‚Äôve all been there!</p><p>With DuckDB-NSQL-7B, we‚Äôre now releasing a text-to-SQL model that is aware of all documented features in DuckDB 0.9.2, including official extensions! Think of it as a documentation oracle that always gives you the exact DuckDB SQL query you are looking for.</p><p>The model was trained on about 200k synthetically generated and validated DuckDB SQL queries, guided by the DuckDB documentation, and more than 250k general <a href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/NumbersStation/NSText2SQL">Text-2-SQL questions from Numbers Station</a>, which makes the model not only capable of generating handy DuckDB snippets but also to generate SQL queries for answering analytical question.</p><p>We fully release the model weights on <a href="https://huggingface.co/motherduckdb/DuckDB-NSQL-7B-v0.1">Hugging Face</a>. and also release the model in a quantized <a href="https://huggingface.co/motherduckdb/DuckDB-NSQL-7B-v0.1-GGUF">GGUF format</a>, for use with llama.cpp.</p><p><em>Read up more about how we created and evaluated DuckDB-NSQL-7B on <a href="http://www.numbersstation.ai/post/duckdb-nsql-how-to-quack-in-sql">Numbers Station‚Äôs blog post</a></em></p></section>

<p><img alt="[Image: Mickey Mouse whistling on the bridge of a steamboat.]" data-original-height="600" data-original-width="720" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgmpMyJpJ8YH4hEKMKde_Pow2smdNeAH6fSTNsUd-g0ZOzvJRNoDwj0N1WNQL82P5MMJSZrz83kgqX9K86wFDNtde3Fczi4X8juTW3orD9acpHU3OrdTbAvqq2IfILDZJFvZtaav4JT1HbDybzN7sNyxr0ilR5mQMr0QZTF0Qb_r615A421JOMBvHli4fIX/s480/mikki.jpg" width="240"></p>

<p><em>Steamboat Willie</em> (1928) was one of the earliest cartoons with synchronized sound. That is, it had post-production sound effects; this was something new and exciting. Now that the cartoon has recently entered the public domain<a href="#bbc24">[bbc24]</a> we can safely delve into its famous soundtrack. See, there's something interesting about how it sounds...</p>

<p>If you listen closely to the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5pG1wbRKOg" title="Steamboat Willie (1928 Film) - 4K Film Remaster">soundtrack on Youtube</a> it sounds somehow distorted. You might be tempted to point out that it's 96 years old, yes. But you might also recognize that it is suffering from <em>flutter</em>, i.e. an unstable playback or recording speed.</p>

<p>In the spirit of this blog let's geek out for a bit and study this flutter distortion further. Can we learn something interesting? Could we perhaps learn enough to be able to reduce it?</p>

<p>Of course the flutter might be 100% authentic to how it sounded in theatres in the 1920s; we don't know when and why it appeared in the audio (more on that later!). It might have sounded even worse. But we can still hope to enjoy the sound effects in their original recorded form.</p>

<h3>Prior work</h3>

<p>I'm not the first one to notice this clip is 'fluttering' and to try and do something about it. I found videos of people's attempts to un-flutter it using Celemony Capstan, a professional tool made just for this purpose, with varying results. Capstan uses Melodyne's famous note detection engine to detect musical features and then controls a varispeed effect to cancel out any flutter.</p>

<p>But Capstan is expensive, and it's more fun to come up with a home-made solution anyway. And what about non-musical sounds? Besides, I had some code laying around in a forgotten desk drawer that just might fit the purpose.</p>

<h3>Finding a high quality source</h3>

<p>Why would I need a high-quality digital file of a poor-quality soundtrack from the 1920s? I guess it's the archivist in me hoping that it has been preserved with high level of detail. But also, if you're going to try and dig up some hidden details in the sound, you'd want minimal interference from any lossy psychoacoustic compression, right? These artifacts might become audible after varispeed effects and could also hinder frequency detection.</p>

<p>The high-quality <a href="https://archive.org/details/steamboat-willie-4-k-resolution">source</a> I found is in the Internet Archive. It might originally be coming from the 4K Blu-Ray release called Celebrating Mickey. The spectrogram doesn't show almost any compression artifacts that I can see, even in the quietest frequency ranges! Perfect!</p>

<p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhC59_S2FfWRnMghfZ4QuHa4GEugXiwUtUudblRrARDPO-v171yCcH4ri_lUxGpkcWCbh1d6htKfH7CSqmMjjJpG0id9XcyMLNTz2k5yVn2jTDvWu62jhr1bl0BOugwiI2CepLB3Y20DwI2sPGV_kQvPmt1nNdwvQPFVVeHVk-9JtyuxoUyyLCiG3IhXd-e/s1100/film_scan.jpg"><img alt="[Image: A single film frame.]" data-original-height="457" data-original-width="1100" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhC59_S2FfWRnMghfZ4QuHa4GEugXiwUtUudblRrARDPO-v171yCcH4ri_lUxGpkcWCbh1d6htKfH7CSqmMjjJpG0id9XcyMLNTz2k5yVn2jTDvWu62jhr1bl0BOugwiI2CepLB3Y20DwI2sPGV_kQvPmt1nNdwvQPFVVeHVk-9JtyuxoUyyLCiG3IhXd-e/s800/film_scan.jpg%202x" width="400"></a></p>

<p>But the Internet Archive <a href="https://archive.org/details/steamboat-willie-16mm-film-scan-4k-lossless">delivers</a> something even better. There's a lossless 4K scan of the movie with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound-on-film">optical soundtrack</a> partially included (above)! The lossless version is 34 GB, but there's a downscaled 480p MP4 one thousandth of the size.</p><p>I listened to the optical soundtrack from this low-resolution version with a little pixel-reader script. Turns out the flutter is already present on the film! (Edit: Note that we don't know where this particular film print came from. When was it created? Is there an original somewhere, without flutter?)</p>

<h3>Hand-guiding a frequency tracker</h3>

<p>Looking at the above spectrogram, we can see that the frequency of everything is zig-zagging as a function of time ‚Äì that's flutter all right. But how to quantify these variations? We could zoom in on one of the frequency peaks and follow the course of its frequency in time. I'm using FFT peak interpolation to find more accurate frequency estimates<a href="#gasior04" title="">[gasior04]</a>.</p>

<p>Take the sound of Pete's tobacco hitting the ship's bell around the 01'45'' mark. You'd think a bell is supposed to have a constant frequency, yet this one sounds quite unstable. We can follow any one of the harmonics and see how the playback speed (bell frequency) varies over the period of one second:</p>

<p>To my eye, this oscillation looks periodic and not random at all. We can run another round of FFT on a longer stretch of samples to find the strongest period of these fluctuations: It turns out to be 15 Hz. (Why 15? I so hoped it would have been 24 Hz ‚Äì it would have made a more interesting story! More on that later...)</p>

<p>Okay, so can we repeat this process for the whole movie? I don't think we can just automatically follow the frequency of every peak, since some sounds will naturally contain vibration and rises and drops in frequency. Not all of it is due to flutter. Some sort of a vetting process is needed. We could try a tedious manual route...</p>

<p>I made a little software tool (above) where I could click and drag little boxes onto a spectrogram to search for peaks in. This wobbly line is then simply taken to be the speed variation (red graph in the top picture).</p>

<p>It became quite a chore to annotate longer sounds as this software didn't come with undo, edit, or save features for the longest time!</p>

<p>Now let's think about what to do with this speed information...</p>

<h3>Desk drawer deep dive</h3>

<p>Some time ago I had made a tool that could well come in handy now. It was for correcting wobbly wideband radio recordings stored on VHS tapes. These recordings contained some empty carriers that happened to work like seismographs, accurately recording the tape speed variations. The tool then used a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrange_polynomial">Lagrange polynomial</a> to interpolate new samples at a steady interval, so called 'digital varispeed'.</p>

<p>It was ultimately based on an interesting paper on de-fluttering magnetic tapes using the tape bias signal as reference<a href="#howarth04">[howarth04]</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi-ftP_bhx7_ijHh3uG18VJRLnLsRbKWaho5kgEz3Hu5y5m5R1pYC3BivLZunACRMAllEkv4YrMKk1ANe3YVOeyuM2rvzMEW8LoHJqyewoU8B6ABosgMbwAptHtv4VTwU0zbKB6fJP5Qx36iiDS8Pm-ok9yAd9EYUfQO06Oi8-JSQp0UIe0LPhcsV4hqP6P/s547/1981.jpg"><img alt="[Image: Buttons of an old device, one of them Varispeed, labeled 1981.

<p>Here's what this digital varispeed sounds like when exaggerated. In the below example I'm doing it in a simpler way. Instead of the Lagrange method I first upsampled some music by 10x in an audio software; hand-drew a speed curve in Audacity; and then used that curve to pick samples out of the oversampled music:</p>

<p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjRocIM1OFdKzStrX8VTZ_pZnynkIJRxVZzCKjdBIkCa9FqKFTXNrYfwUBvsO0dp0iy0FpivP1g_FQboHFDF3xgNcWd303GLKqwH3s3NB2hyphenhyphenwhXyNdi3kNUMhS07pEdQw9cbcmaRZ94IGMfwdLfqDsIj9vh4PH2Qtqpvr6kJGZipaShCdrVYg-j59Sjo9Cy/s1501/speed-variations.png"><img alt="[Image: A waveform in Audacity.]" data-original-height="182" data-original-width="1501" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjRocIM1OFdKzStrX8VTZ_pZnynkIJRxVZzCKjdBIkCa9FqKFTXNrYfwUBvsO0dp0iy0FpivP1g_FQboHFDF3xgNcWd303GLKqwH3s3NB2hyphenhyphenwhXyNdi3kNUMhS07pEdQw9cbcmaRZ94IGMfwdLfqDsIj9vh4PH2Qtqpvr6kJGZipaShCdrVYg-j59Sjo9Cy/s550/speed-variations.png" srcset="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjRocIM1OFdKzStrX8VTZ_pZnynkIJRxVZzCKjdBIkCa9FqKFTXNrYfwUBvsO0dp0iy0FpivP1g_FQboHFDF3xgNcWd303GLKqwH3s3NB2hyphenhyphenwhXyNdi3kNUMhS07pEdQw9cbcmaRZ94IGMfwdLfqDsIj9vh4PH2Qtqpvr6kJGZipaShCdrVYg-j59Sjo9Cy/s1100/speed-variations.png 2x" width="550"></a></p>



<p>Carefully controlled, this effect can be used to cancel out flutter. Here's how: If we knew exactly how the playback speed was fluctuating we could instantly vary the speed of our resampler in the opposite direction, thus canceling the variations. And with the above research we now have that knowledge!</p>

<p>Well, almost. I couldn't always see a clear frequency peak to follow, so the graph is patchy. But.. Maybe it could help to band-pass the speed signal at 15 Hz? This would help fill out small gaps and also preserve vibrato and other fluctuations that aren't part of the flutter distortion. We can at least try!</p>

<p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj0n3FreUSaXNwU3f4_NacMaZACdrpp-bcD3AGkqcOLVPbVbGDs34gKuhIYvmzoW8sBSLWWJ1UwhJVefJ7HPRSFV3sw93N2oPVT5p98J54dQz6kQEiAPE_HKoej4DE4dXHtbMREBfLOX43NVzJ8LgETuGbJKS6KET1NqhfyXqmn8FOW3Pw579ivisEsNnU5/s1028/flutter-filter.png"><img alt="[Image: Two waveforms, one of them piecewise and noisy, the other one smooth and continuous.]" data-original-height="244" data-original-width="1028" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj0n3FreUSaXNwU3f4_NacMaZACdrpp-bcD3AGkqcOLVPbVbGDs34gKuhIYvmzoW8sBSLWWJ1UwhJVefJ7HPRSFV3sw93N2oPVT5p98J54dQz6kQEiAPE_HKoej4DE4dXHtbMREBfLOX43NVzJ8LgETuGbJKS6KET1NqhfyXqmn8FOW3Pw579ivisEsNnU5/s550/flutter-filter.png" srcset="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj0n3FreUSaXNwU3f4_NacMaZACdrpp-bcD3AGkqcOLVPbVbGDs34gKuhIYvmzoW8sBSLWWJ1UwhJVefJ7HPRSFV3sw93N2oPVT5p98J54dQz6kQEiAPE_HKoej4DE4dXHtbMREBfLOX43NVzJ8LgETuGbJKS6KET1NqhfyXqmn8FOW3Pw579ivisEsNnU5/s1100/flutter-filter.png 2x" width="550"></a></p>

<p>In the example above, I replaced empty parts with a constant value of 100% and then filtered the whole thing. This sews the disjointed parts together in a smooth way.</p>

<h3>Can we hear some examples already?</h3>

<p>This clip is from when the goat ate Minnie's sheet music and guitar ‚Äì the apparent catalyst event that sent Mickey Mouse to seek revenge on the entire animal kingdom.</p>

<p>You can definitely hear the difference in the bell-like sounds coming from the goats insides. It even sounds like the little flute notes in the beginning are easier to tell apart in the corrected version.</p>

<p>The cow's moo. That's a hard one because it's so rich in harmonics, in the spectrogram it looks almost like a <em>spaghetti bolognese</em>. My algorithm is constrained to a box and can't stay with one harmonic when the 'moo' slides in frequency. You can hear some artifacts because of this, but still the result sounds less sheep-like than the original.</p>

<h3>Sidetrack 1: Anything else we can find?</h3>

<p>Glad you're still reading! Let's step away from flutter for a while and take the raw audio track itself under the Fourier microscope. Zooming closer, is there anything interesting in the lower end?</p>

<p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhpgDAGqXTHKKLEf-Nsc4U2aBDg1NhpfQnoLcZt9fPXrh5LgosyzGyRckaNuA9O1Gb0XRKevcuwdFx9ZtCXGNKn5SNrrbGoMIHmNPjJW8_phqO4ZcB02wHAPpsin8q4yWw1WXI41Ly6l5tUYrm5kPC75aUH6jr1H8NIWW86Oe80bgwO5Rf8EcmCjsb_1vi5/s1074/annotated-200px.jpg"><img alt="[Image: Spectrogram showing a frequency range from 0 to 180 Hz.]" data-original-height="296" data-original-width="1074" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhpgDAGqXTHKKLEf-Nsc4U2aBDg1NhpfQnoLcZt9fPXrh5LgosyzGyRckaNuA9O1Gb0XRKevcuwdFx9ZtCXGNKn5SNrrbGoMIHmNPjJW8_phqO4ZcB02wHAPpsin8q4yWw1WXI41Ly6l5tUYrm5kPC75aUH6jr1H8NIWW86Oe80bgwO5Rf8EcmCjsb_1vi5/s550/annotated-200px.jpg" srcset="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhpgDAGqXTHKKLEf-Nsc4U2aBDg1NhpfQnoLcZt9fPXrh5LgosyzGyRckaNuA9O1Gb0XRKevcuwdFx9ZtCXGNKn5SNrrbGoMIHmNPjJW8_phqO4ZcB02wHAPpsin8q4yWw1WXI41Ly6l5tUYrm5kPC75aUH6jr1H8NIWW86Oe80bgwO5Rf8EcmCjsb_1vi5/s1100/annotated-200px.jpg 2x" width="550"></a></p>

<p>We can faintly see peaks at multiples of both 24 and 60 Hz. No surprises there, really... 24 Hz being the film framerate and 60 Hz the North American mains frequency. Was there a projector running in the recording studio? Or maybe it's an artifact of scanning the soundtrack one frame at a time? In any case, these sounds are pretty weak.</p>

<p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgmJ6HtiyVj-yVW0JA7Ae5VYVOLhNuSfVoam0-yXFdzlKW6u1LeVuulZ872Jv7i8ec3-ofsac_qnXfL78uXDvydAiiOc97mPVXO03fLrR6rOPQv4n26REMoqsqOgwRIlkv1VzxaZI0ZOmYAZWCzT_FsVv4nldRBxQDIvxZ9OgsuFUOxFUUfcHsLJmiaBdoa/s856/sidebands.jpg"><img alt="[Image: Spectrogram showing tones with apparent sidebands.]" data-original-height="275" data-original-width="856" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgmJ6HtiyVj-yVW0JA7Ae5VYVOLhNuSfVoam0-yXFdzlKW6u1LeVuulZ872Jv7i8ec3-ofsac_qnXfL78uXDvydAiiOc97mPVXO03fLrR6rOPQv4n26REMoqsqOgwRIlkv1VzxaZI0ZOmYAZWCzT_FsVv4nldRBxQDIvxZ9OgsuFUOxFUUfcHsLJmiaBdoa/s550/sidebands.jpg" srcset="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgmJ6HtiyVj-yVW0JA7Ae5VYVOLhNuSfVoam0-yXFdzlKW6u1LeVuulZ872Jv7i8ec3-ofsac_qnXfL78uXDvydAiiOc97mPVXO03fLrR6rOPQv4n26REMoqsqOgwRIlkv1VzxaZI0ZOmYAZWCzT_FsVv4nldRBxQDIvxZ9OgsuFUOxFUUfcHsLJmiaBdoa/s1100/sidebands.jpg 2x" width="550"></a></p>

<p>In some places you can see some sort of modulation that seems to be generating sidebands, just like in radio signals. It's especially visible in Mickey's whistle when it's flutter-corrected, here at the 5-second mark. The sidebands peaks are 107 and 196 Hz away from the 'carrier' if you will. I'm not sure what this could be. Fluctuating amplitude?</p>

<h3>Sidetrack 2: Playing sound-on-film frame by frame?</h3>

<p>This is an experiment I did some time ago. It's just a silly thought - what would happen if the soundtrack was being read in the same way as the picture is ‚Äì stopped 24 times per second? Would this be the <em>ultimate</em> flutter distortion?</p>

<p>In the olden days, sound was stored on the film next to the picture frames as analog information. Unlike the picture frames that had to be stopped momentarily for projection, the sound had to be played at a constant speed. There was a complicated mechanism in the projector to make this possible.</p>

<p>I found some speed curves for old-school movie projectors in <a href="https://www.windytan.com/2024/01/bickford72">[bickford72]</a>. They describe the film's deceleration and acceleration during these stops. Let's emulate these speed curves in audio with the oversampling varispeed method.</p>

<p>The video below is a 3D animation where this same speed curve controls an animation of a moving film in an imaginary machine. The clip is from another 1920s animation, <em>Alice in the Wooly West</em> (1926).</p>

<p><em>~~ Now we know ~~</em></p>

<h3>Conclusions</h3>

<ul>
  <li>We found a 15 Hz speed fluctuation that was, to some extent, reversible.</li>
  <li>This flutter signal is already present in the optical soundtrack of a film scan.</li>
  <li>With enough manual work, much of the soundtrack could probably be 'corrected'.</li>
  <li>'Hmm, that sounds odd' are sometimes the words of a white rabbit.</li>
</ul>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
            <p>Last time, I discussed the <a href="https://interjectedfuture.com/trade-offs-between-different-crdts">trade-offs between more traditional CRDTs</a>, such as the State-based CRDT, Op-based CRDT, and Delta-based CRDT. </p><p>There is another class of CRDTs: Merkle CRDTs.</p><p>Most ink spilled on CRDTs focuses on consistently merging data from different replicas. That's just half the story. Without a way of storing when concurrent edits happen, merges can't make consistent decisions about conflict resolution. </p><p>Normally, this is the job of <a href="https://haslab.wordpress.com/2011/07/08/version-vectors-are-not-vector-clocks/">version vectors</a> in State-based CRDTs and the log of causal operations in Op-based CRDTs. But if you're familiar with blockchains or Git, we notice that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merkle_tree">Merkle Trees and DAGs</a> (Directed Acyclical Graph) can also do the same job. </p><p>The following is how we construct this bookkeeping, exposed as an inherent structure of the concurrent state, rather than hidden away within a container. Let's look at the two variations:</p><ul><li><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.00107.pdf">Merkle-DAG CRDTs</a></li><li><a href="https://inria.hal.science/hal-02303490v1/document">Merkle Search Tree CRDTs</a></li></ul><h2 id="merkle-dag-crdt">Merkle-DAG CRDT</h2><p>The Merkle-DAG (Directed Acyclical Graph) models CRDTs as a growing DAG of Merkle nodes about concurrent updates as events occur. This is a Merklized version of <a href="https://www.bartoszsypytkowski.com/operation-based-crdts-protocol/">Op-based CRDTs</a>, where the internal bookkeeping grows with the number of state updates, rather than with the number of replicas.</p><p>Each node in the Merkle-DAG can carry a payload of operations, state snapshots, or even deltas. This node payload must be a CRDT for the Merkle-DAG to be a CRDT. However, these payload CRDTs can be much simpler in their implementation because the bookkeeping on concurrent edits is delegated up to the Merkle-DAG.</p><p>It's as if a state-based CRDT was turned inside-out. The common bookkeeping elements are now the container (the DAG), and the payload-specific bookkeeping is inside of the payload CRDT.</p><p>Beyond simpler bookkeeping for payload CRDTs, Merkle-DAG CRDTs have an advantage that non-Merklized CRDTs don't. They can determine equality by comparing root hashes, and they can determine diffs by walking down the DAG.</p><p>This reduces the bandwidth for syncing between replicas. </p><ol><li>A remote replica broadcasts its root hash to our local replica. </li><li>The local replica compares its root hash with the remote hash to determine if something has changed. </li><li>If the root hashes are different, it then asks the remote replica to send every node hash as it walks down the DAG from the root. </li><li>When the remote replica sends a hash that the local replica already has, the path from the root to this node is the list of all nodes missing in the local replica.</li></ol><p>This is quite a bit of chatter over the network, but the hashes don't have to be delivered in causal order any more. Merkle DAGs are by definition a causal chain of hashes. Hence, the nodes can be reordered at the receiver, regardless of how they were sent, as long as all of the nodes were received.</p><p>An upside of keeping the Merkle-DAG is that the data kept by a Merkle-DAG is immutable. It can be reconstructed and queried at any point in history. Immutability means diffs are easy, undos are easy, and provenance can be verified. But again, the downside here is a history of changes that grows with the number of events. However, Merkle Trees uses <a href="https://medium.com/@dumindux/how-immutable-data-structures-e-g-immutable-js-are-optimized-using-structural-sharing-e4424a866d56">structural sharing</a> as a form of compression to lower the space cost of storing such a data structure. </p><div><p>üí°</p><p>- Merging of two Merkle DAGs is done by comparing hashes and walking down a DAG.<br>- Node payload is a CRDT, and its merge function still needs to be commutative, associative, and idempotent.</p></div><div><p>üëç</p><p>- Smaller amount of data sent over the network to sync by comparing hashes.<br>- Sync protocol is simpler due to not needing causal order delivery, but still requires some chatter over the wire to find diff to send.<br>- Data is immutable so diffs, undos, and provenance is easy.</p></div><div><p>üëé</p><p>- Internal data structure grows with the number of updates.</p></div><h2 id="merkle-search-tree-crdt">Merkle Search Tree CRDT</h2><p>The second kind of Merkle CRDT is covered in the <a href="https://inria.hal.science/hal-02303490v1/document">Merkle Search Tree paper</a>.</p><figure><img src="https://interjectedfuture.com/content/images/2023/12/image-1.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="858" height="724" srcset="https://interjectedfuture.com/content/images/size/w600/2023/12/image-1.png 600w, https://interjectedfuture.com/content/images/2023/12/image-1.png 858w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>A Merkle Search Tree (MST) is a tree that maintains an ordered set of keys. It does this by maintaining a few invariants. </p><ol><li>All the keys in a node are ordered.</li><li>All child nodes between two keys in a node contain entries lexicographically between the two keys.</li><li>The leaf layer is layer zero. The layer above is layer one, with increasing layer numbers until the root. The layer a key belongs to is dictated by the number of leading zeros in the hash of the key.</li><li>A node has a content ID that's a hash of all its keys concatenated with the content IDs of all its children. A child node is referenced by its content id.</li></ol><p>Keys live in all nodes of an MST tree, unlike a B-tree where keys are only at the leaves. This construction makes MSTs advantageous in two ways: it is self-balancing and it is unicit.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>A MST is self-balancing through both invariants #2 and #3. When a key is inserted in the tree, the layer is determined by the key's hash and the node in the layer is determined by the key's value. When the key is inserted in a node between two keys, it necessarily splits the child node between the two keys into two nodes due to invariant #2. Given a hash is in base <em>B</em> and invariant #3, the average number of keys in layer <em>L</em> is <em>B</em> times the average number of keys in layer <em>L + 1</em>. Hence, the average node size is <em>B</em>. Due to the placement of a key being completely deterministic, the tree self-balances.</p><p>Unicity means, for a given set of keys, the MST is unique. It implies the MST's construction does not depend on the order of the keys that were inserted. This is extremely desireable, because we can tell if two MSTs are different simply by comparing their root hashes regardless of the insertion order. If the root hash is the same, then the two trees are the same. </p><p>To construct a CRDT out of an MST, we simply add a payload to each key that's also a CRDT. Since the MST is an ordered set, merging sets have well-defined semantics, and merging the payloads is delegated to the payload itself to resolve. </p><p>And just like the Merkle-DAG construction, the payload CRDT doesn't need to be as complicated. For example, to construct a Grow-Only CRDT, we select the set { ‚èä, ‚èâ } (called "bottom" and "top" respectively) as the payload CRDT. All the values of the payload start as "bottom" by default. Merging means taking the max of "top" vs "bottom" (top always wins in a max operation). </p><p>Unfortunately, the paper leaves out the construction of other CRDTs using MSTs, as it was left as an exercise for the reader. However, there are two other possible constructions I think will work.</p><p><a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3380787.3393678">Causal Length CRDTs</a> for add-remove sets could be implemented in MSTs with ‚Ñ§ (the set of integers) as the payload. If the number is even the key doesn't exist, and if it's odd, then it does. Merging would just be taking the max of the two replica's payloads.</p><p><a href="https://www.bartoszsypytkowski.com/operation-based-crdts-arrays-1/">Replicated Growable Arrays</a> (RGA) could be implemented by using virtual pointers concatted with the replica ID as the key. Since the MST keeps the keys ordered, we can read back the string by traversing in key order. This would need a mechanism outside of the MST to insert and assign tombstones for deletions. [^3]</p><p>Beyond that, there is an undetailed edge case. What if the key you're adding has a lot more (or a lot less) leading zeros in its hash than the number of leading zeros in the current root layer? Do you just add nodes in between the root and the new node? What should go in those in-between nodes? If there are no keys in these in-between nodes and just child content IDs, there would be no way to discern which child to descend into on a query. My guess is to simply insert a ghost key that doesn't exist in the set but only serves as a range bookend for queries. There are implementations to check out for details. [^4]</p><p>As for downsides, it's also vulnerable to attackers constructing a key with a large number of zeros and trying to insert it. That would result in a tall tree, reducing queries from O(log n) to O(n). And while the node size is on average <em>B</em>, the variance is spread pretty wide, so it can be common to have nodes that are too small or too large.</p><div><p>üí°</p><p>- Merging of two Merkle Search Trees is done similarly to a Merkle Tree: by comparing hashes and walking down the tree.<br>- Node payload is a CRDT, and its merge function still needs to be commutative, associative, and idempotent.</p></div><div><p>üëç</p><p>- Smaller amount of data sent over the network to sync by comparing hashes<br>- Sync protocol is simpler due to not needing causal order delivery, but still requires some chatter over the wire to find diff to send<br>- Self-balancing tree<br>- Trees are unicit<br>- Internal bookkeeping doesn't grow with either replicas or the number of updates</p></div><div><p>üëé</p><p>- Possible for attackers to construct tall trees to slow query times<br>- Variance of node sizes is large</p></div><h2 id="the-surprising-connection">The surprising connection</h2><p>After this and the <a href="https://interjectedfuture.com/trade-offs-between-different-crdts/">previous survey</a> on CRDTs, I came away with some clarity on them. </p><p>CRDTs need two main ingredients to work, a merge/application operator that's commutative and associative, and some bookkeeping to keep track of concurrent or causal edits. This bookkeeping is like an uncollapsed superposition of state while the system isn't sure if there are any more concurrent edits. If we can be sure that all replicas are synced, we can either collapse the state or simply throw it away if we don't need to travel back in time.</p><p>For typical CRDTs, this bookkeeping is internal, and you're given an interface to set and query, so one can pretend this is a regular state that can be updated in place. Merkle CRDTs turn this inside out, exposing the inherent structure of concurrent edits and uncollapsed state for users to see and exploit.</p><p>This mirrors closely with how Git is structured. That surprised me at first. But as I dove into Git's history, I found this tidbit in passing.</p><blockquote>The important part of a merge is not how it handles conflicts (which need to be verified by a human anyway if they are at all interesting), but that it should meld the history together right so that you have a new solid base for future merges.<p>In other words, the important part is the _trivial_ part: the naming of the parents, and keeping track of their relationship. Not the clashes.<br><a href="https://wincent.com/blog/a-look-back-bram-cohen-vs-linus-torvalds">Linus Travolus vs Bram Cohen</a></p></blockquote><p>The values are the contents of the file, and the bookkeeping on concurrent edits happens outside of the value. What stops Git from being a CRDT is that its default 3-way merge isn't commutative and associative.</p><p>As history proved, it's the bookkeeping data structure that's important for merges, not the conflict resolution itself. But in the case of CRDTs, it's important to constrain the merge with algebraic properties [^2].</p><h2 id="the-search-continues">The search continues</h2><p>Merkle Search Trees have lots of nice properties, such as unicity, self-balancing, and a CRDT that doesn't grow with the number of replicas or events. But I think we can do better. For one, the variance of the node sizes is large in MSTs, which makes for uneven trees. </p><p>In my search, I found <a href="https://github.com/attic-labs/noms/blob/master/doc/intro.md#prolly-trees-probabilistic-b-trees">Prolly Trees</a>, and will take a look at them. If anyone has other suggestions for data structures to look at to implement composable CRDTs, <a href="https://twitter.com/iamwil">let me know</a>. In the meantime, <a href="https://interjectedfuture.com/crdts-turned-inside-out/#/portal">subscribe</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/iamwil">follow me on twitter</a>.</p><hr><p>[^1] If you aren't familiar with the internals of Git, I'd recommend looking into it. &nbsp;Git is the only piece of software where learning its internal data structure made it easier to use. <br>- <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Internals-Plumbing-and-Porcelain">Git Internals: Plumbing and Porcelain</a><br>- <a href="https://marklodato.github.io/visual-git-guide/index-en.html">A Visual Guide to Git</a></p><p>[^2] The algebraic properties we need to maintain for a merge are commutativity, associativity, and idempotency.

<p>Zeb Figura of CodeWeavers <a href="https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20240124004028.16826-1-zfigura@codeweavers.com/" target="_blank">has proposed</a> a Windows NT synchronization primitive driver to help performance of running games and applications designed for Windows on Linux with Wine / Proton.</p>
<p>As per the RFC (request for comments) posted onto the Linux kernel mailing list&nbsp;Figura notes: "This patch series introduces a new char misc driver, /dev/ntsync, which is used to implement Windows NT synchronization primitives."</p>
<p>Then giving some background on it: "The Wine project emulates the Windows API in user space. One particular part of<br>
that API, namely the NT synchronization primitives, have historically been implemented via RPC to a dedicated "kernel" process. However, more recent applications use these APIs more strenuously, and the overhead of RPC has become a bottleneck.</p>
<p>The NT synchronization APIs are too complex to implement on top of existing primitives without sacrificing correctness. Certain operations, such as NtPulseEvent() or the "wait-for-all" mode of NtWaitForMultipleObjects(), require direct control over the underlying wait queue, and implementing a wait queue sufficiently robust for Wine in user space is not possible. This proposed driver, therefore, implements the problematic interfaces directly in the Linux kernel."</p>
<p>Figura did a presentation on it at the&nbsp;Linux Plumbers Conference in 2023 that you can see below:</p>

<p>What kind of performance difference might we see with something like this? The difference depends on your hardware and what you're trying to run but some FPS examples were given from multiple users including:</p>

<p><em>What hardware and software each was tested on was not noted.</em></p>
<p>Some impressive numbers but again it's hardware dependent, but even so any performance uplift would be welcome, so hopefully the patch series gets some good comments and approval after any tweaks are done that may be needed. Looks like we could end up seeing a nice future performance improvement for Linux and Steam Deck gaming with Wine and Proton.</p>
