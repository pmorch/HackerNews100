<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="maincontent"><p><span>T</span>he trap was laid in a rented office: two rooms in downtown Copenhagen, furnished without a whisper of Scandi style. If it wasn’t for a Frida Kahlo print on one wall, the premises might have felt as impersonal and stark as a confessional. That, in any event, was what it became. For six months, beginning in mid-2022, a parade of people – members of motorcycle gangs, entrepreneurs, lawyers, real-estate barons, politicians – trooped through to recount their sins to Amira Smajic. They didn’t come for expiation. They knew Smajic to be one of them – an outlaw, and in her particular case, a business lawyer so skilled at laundering money that she’d enabled a couple of billion kroner in financial crime over the previous decade. They called her the Ice Queen, because she showed not a flicker of regret for what she did.</p><p>In her office, Smajic’s visitors bragged about dodging tax, bribing officials or exploiting the bankruptcy code. She offered them coffee and coaxed forth their confidences. Six cameras and three microphones, secreted in power sockets, captured it all – footage that was turned into a documentary called The Black Swan. In its surreptitious method and breathtaking drama, The Black Swan bore all the fingerprints of its director, Mads Brügger, a provocateur who has spent his career searching for bombshells to drop but who had never quite managed it as well as he did here. Denmark’s national bird is the <em>Cygnus olor</em>, a swan as white as virtue. The Black Swan, in showing such easy, unbridled formulations of crime, blew up Denmark’s idea of itself.</p><p>Since airing last May as a five-part series on TV2, Denmark’s biggest television network, The Black Swan has sent the country into convulsions. One out of every two Danes has seen the documentary. After its release, a biker-gang member and his accountant were charged with financial crimes and taken into custody; others, including a municipal official, are under investigation. The Danish Bar and Law Society formally apologised to the minister of justice for the conduct of two lawyers caught on camera; they have been either fired or disbarred. A new money-laundering law was introduced to give banks more oversight over “client accounts” – the kind of accounts in which lawyers pool the funds of several clients and transact on their behalf, and that featured in many of the machinations in Smajic’s office. In her New Year’s speech, Denmark’s prime minister suggested biker-gang criminals ought to be stripped of their pension rights – a detail so specific it was surely inspired by The Black Swan.</p><p>Other Scandinavian nations also reeled upon watching The Black Swan. After the series premiered in Sweden, a criminologist at Lund University warned: “There’s a lot of evidence that it’s probably even worse here.” Norwegian civil servants invited Brügger to Oslo in January to talk to them about money-laundering. All of Scandinavia, he believes, has persuaded itself that crime exists only in violent, poor abscesses on the edges of their societies. “The Danes totally subscribe to this idea that Denmark has no corruption, and to the idea of Denmark as the end of the road,” Brügger said, referring to the political scientist Francis Fukuyama’s notion that “getting to Denmark” is the goal of every modern democracy. “The Black Swan punctured that hallucination,” Brügger said. “It was Denmark’s red-pill moment.”</p><p>Sitting in the Copenhagen offices of Frihedsbrevet, or Freedom Letter, an investigative journalism site Brügger co-founded in 2021, I asked him what ordinarily passes for corruption in Denmark. He thought about it for a comically long time. During his boyhood, he recalled, one major scandal involved a small-town mayor being bribed with a bathroom renovation for his home. In 2011, Danish newspapers carried as front-page news the revelation that the prime minister, Helle Thorning-Schmidt, was leasing her car from Germany, saving €20 a month and depriving the exchequer of €70 a month in tax. Brügger had told a Greek friend about this brouhaha; the friend stared at him and said: “Back home, we’re talking about a politician who was given an entire island as a bribe.” Brügger also related a Frihedsbrevet scoop: Copenhagen’s leading newspaper editors had been attending a Proust book club run by a government official, a degree of socialising that Brügger characterised as unhealthy. This was, he was suggesting, the scale of grift Danes were used to – chump-change tax avoidance and highbrow hobnobbing – until The Black Swan came along.</p><p>But he was embroidering for effect. There have been graver controversies: a stock price manipulation scheme in 2008; a money-laundering case <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/sep/21/is-money-laundering-scandal-at-danske-bank-the-largest-in-history" data-link-name="in body link">involving Danske Bank</a>; a $1bn tax fraud case that ended in a 12-year prison sentence for its mastermind last December. Michael Bang Petersen, a political scientist at Aarhus University who studies trust in Danish society, told me that citizens’ trust in politicians has fallen by 20 percentage points since 2007. But their trust in fellow citizens has stayed stable. When asked if they can trust most people, an astonishing 80% of Danes reply in the affirmative. Lawyers, roasted as rogues practically everywhere, enjoy a glowing reputation in Denmark, and the welfare state is revered, as inviolable as a cathedral.</p><p>“We’re taught from a young age that cheating the system is not something you do, because you end up pissing on everybody,” Ane Cortzen, a television presenter and Brügger’s sister, told me. “Cheating on taxes is one of the most serious crimes you can commit.” Kalle Johannes Rose, an associate professor at Copenhagen Business School, observed: “Most Danish scandals have to do with the state – public healthcare, public banks, public something or the other. People want to know their high taxes are being spent correctly. If they don’t trust the system, they don’t pay their taxes, and then the house of cards falls down.” The Black Swan thus invited viewers to dwell on their worst nightmare: a shattering of the trust that underpins not just the smooth functioning of their beloved welfare state but the essence of what makes Danes proud to be Danes.</p><hr><p><span>A</span>mira Smajic wears her dark hair pulled back so tightly that her skin tightens around her high cheekbones. It lends her the severe, credible look of a schoolteacher, doubtless an asset during her years of crime. In her first job after university, at an accounting firm, Smajic quickly sensed they were skating close to the edge of the law. Her employer was subsequently <a href="https://www.tv2fyn.dk/odense/amiras-laeremester-gav-gode-raad-paa-tv-men-traekker-spor-af-kriminalitet-bag-sig" data-link-name="in body link">convicted</a> of fraud and forgery – but by then, Smajic had struck out on her own, working with Denmark’s biker gangs, which are notorious for criminality and violence. “I specialised in making accounts look as needed – getting white money to turn black and vice versa,” she says in the film. For these services, she earned several hundred thousand kroner a month. “I shopped in Louis Vuitton every week. I bought shoes like other people buy milk.”</p><figure id="242ddae3-3346-4bf5-8735-d09d40c05c63" data-spacefinder-role="showcase" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement"><div id="img-2"><picture><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d18cb729190a1f2979995b1228575c2bb6da81d4/0_0_4096_2160/master/4096.jpg?width=880&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 1300px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 1300px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d18cb729190a1f2979995b1228575c2bb6da81d4/0_0_4096_2160/master/4096.jpg?width=880&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 1300px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d18cb729190a1f2979995b1228575c2bb6da81d4/0_0_4096_2160/master/4096.jpg?width=800&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 1140px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 1140px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d18cb729190a1f2979995b1228575c2bb6da81d4/0_0_4096_2160/master/4096.jpg?width=800&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 1140px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d18cb729190a1f2979995b1228575c2bb6da81d4/0_0_4096_2160/master/4096.jpg?width=640&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 980px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 980px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d18cb729190a1f2979995b1228575c2bb6da81d4/0_0_4096_2160/master/4096.jpg?width=640&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 980px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d18cb729190a1f2979995b1228575c2bb6da81d4/0_0_4096_2160/master/4096.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d18cb729190a1f2979995b1228575c2bb6da81d4/0_0_4096_2160/master/4096.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 660px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d18cb729190a1f2979995b1228575c2bb6da81d4/0_0_4096_2160/master/4096.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d18cb729190a1f2979995b1228575c2bb6da81d4/0_0_4096_2160/master/4096.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 480px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d18cb729190a1f2979995b1228575c2bb6da81d4/0_0_4096_2160/master/4096.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d18cb729190a1f2979995b1228575c2bb6da81d4/0_0_4096_2160/master/4096.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 320px)"><img alt="A woman with dark hair looks pensive and to the side of the image" src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d18cb729190a1f2979995b1228575c2bb6da81d4/0_0_4096_2160/master/4096.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" width="445" height="234.66796875" loading="lazy"></picture></div><figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline"><span><svg width="18" height="13" viewBox="0 0 18 13"><path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"></path></svg></span><span>Amira Smajic in a still from The Black Swan.</span> Photograph: Wingman Media/TV2 Denmark</figcaption></figure><p>In 2020, wearying of the paranoia and guilt of this delinquent life, Smajic thought of going public – through a book, perhaps, or a film. Having met several publishers and journalists, she eventually found her way to Brügger, and she commanded every shred of his attention. Over sushi, she told him so much about her connections with the criminal underworld that “she was clearly the real deal”, Brügger told me. He was instantly smitten, in that half-ardent, half-extractive way that journalists are with their subjects.</p><p>Brügger and TV2 first considered investigating the old contracts, emails and texts in Smajic’s files. But Michael Nørgaard, TV2’s editor-in-chief, said he was aware that Smajic had spent years engaging in fraud and forgery. “Could we believe that the materials she came to us with were intact – that she didn’t take out documents to put her in a better light?” he wondered. The idea to open a new office and clandestinely film its operations, Brügger and Nørgaard told me, came from Smajic. In a 2021 email, which Brügger showed me, Smajic excitedly laid out five pages of plans to monetise her past: articles, newsletters, podcasts, an eight-part true-crime show, the documentary, four books, the full panoply of a repentance empire. The arc, Smajic wrote, referring to herself in the third person, would be of “her social and moral redress”.</p><p>Brügger says he believed her. Smajic had come to Denmark as a child refugee from Bosnia, along with her family, and on one occasion she told Brügger that her father, who’d died of cancer, would have been disappointed that she’d turned to crime after Denmark had taken her in. “I will never get out of this life if I do nothing,” Smajic says in the first episode, with the air of a woman plotting to burn a bridge even as she flees over it. Before filming began, a security expert talked Smajic through the consequences of making the documentary, Brügger told me. “He didn’t spare her. He said she may have to relocate to another country, change her name, or not see her friends any more. She was crying, and I thought: ‘OK, that’s it. She’s out.’ But she insisted on continuing.”</p><p>Brügger and Nørgaard knew one more thing about Smajic. She was at the time, and had been for years, a police informant. On her request, they withheld that from the documentary – but they also didn’t let the police know in advance about the trap they were setting. In a brief contract, drafted at the outset of production and barely two pages long, Brügger’s producer, Peter Engel, stipulated that Smajic would be paid 30,000 kroner (roughly £3,350) a month. Engel said she also agreed to refrain from any actual criminal activity during production. In the opening minutes of The Black Swan, sitting across a desk from Smajic in a room resembling an interrogation chamber, Brügger asks her what the worst outcome of her undertaking could be. She replies: “That someone finds out and I will be liquidated before any of this is shown.”</p><hr><p><span>T</span>he suspense of whether Smajic will be unmasked keeps The Black Swan as taut as a bowstring. The documentary’s more immediate shocks come from watching people methodically plan to break the law. The crimes range from the paltry to the serious. A man named Wassem, to whom Smajic introduces herself in the first episode, runs a shawarma shop and wants to skip out on tax. Fasar Abrar Raja, a grey-bearded member of a motorcycle gang called Bandidos, helps demolition crews dispose of asbestos and other toxic material without the costly safety measures the law requires. For a fee, he will bribe environmental analysts and local officials to look the other way while he dumps the material in the Danish countryside. Fasar also brings along Martin Malm, a smooth-faced businessman who launders millions of kroner a month through his “invoice factories”: companies that issue fake invoices for services never rendered. (Malm might invoice a nightclub owner for providing bouncers, say; the owner would pay Malm, who’d keep a fee and return the rest to the owner in cash or some other fashion, allowing him to avoid paying tax on it. The bouncers, needless to say, don’t exist.)</p><p>One of the film’s revelations, Brügger says in a voiceover, is the connection “between the nice-looking, everyday citizens and the underworld”. In Smajic’s presence, a lawyer named Lise Roulund delivers to Fasar a USB drive full of confidential documents she has obtained from the police – an illegal act in itself. On suspicions of money-laundering, Fasar’s bank account has been frozen, so Roulund helps him enact his tax dodges by transferring money in and out of an account she controls. Without lawyers willing to look the other way, criminal activity would seize up, Roulund says. “We’re the ones who make it go around.”</p><p>Another lawyer, named Nicolai Dyhr, <a href="https://nyheder-tv2-dk.translate.goog/krimi/2024-05-15-topadvokat-fanget-paa-skjult-kamera-lovede-at-daekke-over-fakturafabrik-og-opfordrede-til-selskabssvindel?_x_tr_sl=da&amp;_x_tr_tl=en&amp;_x_tr_hl=en&amp;_x_tr_pto=sc" data-link-name="in body link">a partner at one of Denmark’s most prestigious law firms</a>, is a fount of suggestions on how to exploit the bankruptcy code. He lays out how Wassem could shutter his shawarma business, declare bankruptcy and avoid a tax debt of 2.4m kroner; he even details how Wassem could squeeze additional money out of a government fund that guarantees worker salaries while companies are going through bankruptcy. Malm, the businessman with the invoice factories, also files for bankruptcy, and Dyhr advises him to hide evidence of fraud and deliberately undervalue his businesses. (Later, Dyhr claimed he was “eel-trapping” – leading Malm on to secure him as a client, but with no plans to commit crimes. Dyhr sued TV2, demanding that all covert footage of him be edited out of the film, but <a href="https://nyheder.tv2.dk/samfund/2024-05-30-topadvokat-taber-sag-mod-tv-2-i-retten" data-link-name="in body link">lost</a> his case. Fasar denied committing the crimes discussed on camera; Malm told TV2 it “didn’t have the whole picture”; Roulund has refused to comment.)</p><p>By themselves, the sums of laundered money bandied about run only to a few million pounds, small enough in scale that one expert described it to me as <em>hyggekrim</em> – crime so domestic it’s practically cosy. But all these cons purport to show how simple it is to exploit the Danish state. It was one of the earliest lessons of Smajic’s career, she says: “The state always pays.”</p><p>Some episodes of The Black Swan prickle with violence. On a trip to his native Pakistan, Fasar discusses killing a patient in a hospital – a potential witness in a trial against him. (Nørgaard told me TV2 tipped off the Danish police about Fasar’s plans.) After returning to Copenhagen, Fasar storms into Smajic’s office, threatening to “crush you with my bare hands” because she has failed to secure a Danish passport for his daughter. Without breaking character, Smajic mollifies him. By the end of the meeting, they’re reminiscing about how a mental illness diagnosis concocted years ago has kept Fasar out of prison for drug and arms trafficking offences, and he’s laughing along. It’s an astonishing performance from Smajic – like watching someone act out Hamlet while walking a high wire.</p><p>Then, in the final episode, we learn Smajic is an even more nerveless and consummate actor than we thought – that she has double-crossed Brügger himself.</p><p>From one of Smajic’s sound recorders, the producers recover a file she has deleted, and discover that she knows Wassem far better than she lets on. His name is not even Wassem, and from their conversation on the file, about transporting cash, she seems to be engaged in an entirely different caper with him, one that Brügger and TV2 know nothing about. Upon investigation, they find she has secretly been running a second office, where they suspect she has been laundering hundreds of thousands of kroner via invoice factories for other clients. (Smajic has said she never facilitated any crimes during this period.) In <a href="https://nyheder.tv2.dk/samfund/2024-07-04-nye-tv-2-afsloeringer-faar-muldvarps-fortaelling-til-at-smuldre-yderligere" data-link-name="in body link">one case</a>, TV2 claims to have found undiluted fraud: Smajic embezzling 65,000 kroner from a client by forwarding him emails that she’d fabricated, and that appeared to be from the tax authority. Smajic isn’t a crook on the mend at all, the film concludes; she’s a crook in the thick of committing an assortment of crimes. When she finds out that Brügger and his colleagues know about her side hustles, she demands the documentary be shelved.</p><p>All documentaries are artificial: their footage has been carefully threshed and sieved with an eye to telling a story or pushing an argument. The Black Swan, though, relies on the unblinking, real-time gaze of hidden CCTV cameras, so we lull ourselves into thinking that we’re seeing the full picture, the full truth. No such thing. Instead, we get evasion upon evasion: Smajic’s charade for her clients, Malm cheating the taxman, TV2 withholding their work from the police, Brügger keeping details from his audience. Smajic’s final bluff merely confirms what Brügger seems to have believed throughout his career: everywhere, there are conspiracies and lies that he must expose, even if he has to participate in the dissembling himself.</p><hr><p><span>B</span>rügger, who turns 53 in June, is a very tall, very bald man with a very red beard. He never seems to run out of conversational energy; whatever time of day it is, he’s likely to be ready to talk for hours, looking at you unblinkingly through his chunky spectacles as he tells you how bizarre or absurd the world really is. When I first met him, at the Frihedsbrevet offices in January, we loitered in the building’s courtyard, our pates goose-pimpling over in the Danish winter, so he could finish his cigarette. He warmed us up with fresh gossip. We had originally planned to attend, that evening, a public lecture by three TV2 journalists about The Black Swan. But Smajic had emailed the journalists a few days earlier, promising to show up and ask a few questions of her own, such as: “How does it feel to take credit for a program I pay for with my life (even though I’m still breathing, yes)?” or “How many people have you thrown under the bus against your better judgment to make your story work?”</p><p>After the documentary’s release, fearing for her safety and that of her young son, Smajic had gone into hiding, so her cameo at the lecture would have been sensational. She would bring “a bunch of friends”, she warned – and then, in a second email, added: “Have you thought about and arranged security for that night … The assessment is that my participation that evening increases the risk for both me, you and the audience.”</p><p>Citing caution, TV2 cancelled the event. I couldn’t tell if Brügger felt disappointed or vindicated – the first at the dashed prospect of seeing Smajic rising in the audience and setting it abuzz, the second at how Smajic’s emails appeared laced with an articulate derangement. “She’s an expert in creating conflict and manipulating people,” he told me. “If you plant her inside a biker gang, she could tear it apart within two weeks.”</p><figure id="cd5cbf35-ce37-4549-b962-0ae96e7562ed" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement"><div id="img-3"><picture><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f3b484c06131fcd643dff4467ad1c4e6e1dafa3b/0_0_1920_960/master/1920.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f3b484c06131fcd643dff4467ad1c4e6e1dafa3b/0_0_1920_960/master/1920.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 660px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f3b484c06131fcd643dff4467ad1c4e6e1dafa3b/0_0_1920_960/master/1920.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f3b484c06131fcd643dff4467ad1c4e6e1dafa3b/0_0_1920_960/master/1920.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 480px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f3b484c06131fcd643dff4467ad1c4e6e1dafa3b/0_0_1920_960/master/1920.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f3b484c06131fcd643dff4467ad1c4e6e1dafa3b/0_0_1920_960/master/1920.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 320px)"><img alt="A women with her hair in a tight bun talks intensely to a man with a full beard.

His parents were journalists, and at the dinner table, his sister, Ane Cortzen, said: “We’d talk about society and politics, and you couldn’t just sit and listen. You had to have an opinion.” Cortzen remembers Brügger as an inventive child obsessed with comic books, to the point that he developed a “very black-and-white view of the world, in which some people are good and some are evil”. (On the middle finger of his right hand, Brügger wears a skull ring as homage to The Phantom, a comic-book crimefighter who wears a skintight purple suit and lives in a cave resembling a human cranium.) At university, Brügger studied film-making, and then worked at the state broadcaster, where he met his longtime producer, Peter Engel. “The best thing, I discovered, is to let him do his own stuff,” Engel said. “If you hear there’s a black market for diplomatic credentials, an ordinary journalist will say: ‘I’ll interview the broker and write a piece.’ Mads would say: ‘Let me become a fake diplomat.’ He always wants to step into his own universe.”</p><p>As a documentarian, Brügger likes to make things happen. Not for him the Attenboroughian serenity of waiting for a lion to grow hungry and then track down its antelope; he’d rather starve the lion, hobble the antelope, and then introduce both beasts into a cage to film the carnage. In all his projects, Brügger has mounted elaborate, artificial setups just like Smajic’s office, and lured people into self-indictment, folly or sudden disclosures. Most of his films pivot on Brügger pretending to be someone he isn’t. In The Red Chapel, which won a Sundance award in 2010, he plays the manager of a pair of comedians touring North Korea. In The Ambassador, he impersonates a Liberian diplomat in Central African Republic. His cameras are, if not hidden, claiming to be present for benign purposes. In Pyongyang with his comedians, Brügger’s tapes were screened every night by a government agency; the film’s splenetic views of North Korea – “a sanctuary for crazy people” – emerge in the edits and in Brügger’s voiceovers. As in The Black Swan, the most burning question in these films is always: will someone tear the facade away and expose Brügger?</p><p>Even in Cold Case Hammarskjöld, in which Brügger tamely appears as himself – a film-maker smelling conspiracy behind the death of Dag Hammarskjöld, the UN secretary general, in a 1961 plane crash – he cannot resist a splash of play-acting. He wears an all-white outfit, down to his sneakers, because, as he says in his narration: “I know for a fact that the villain of this story, he wore only white.” Brügger fails to prove that this villain – a long-dead South African mercenary – actually brought down Hammarskjöld’s plane, but that kind of factfinding is, in any case, never the priority of his films. “Hammarskjöld was a ticket to all the things I really enjoy: tracking down mercenaries, telling tales of evil men who dress in white, [and] rumours about secret African societies,” Brügger says in one voiceover. He’s always out for spectacle, shock and a wild ride. “If Hunter S Thompson had gone into film and ditched all the drugs,” a Norwegian columnist wrote of Cold Case Hammarskjöld, “maybe this is what he could have ended up with.”</p><p>Brügger’s approach can leave his collaborators uneasy. When I spoke to one of the comedians in The Red Chapel, he euphemistically called Brügger’s journalism “uncompromising,” adding: “Mads is often portrayed as either a villain or a genius – and maybe he’s both.” An early collaborator described Brügger to me as ruthlessly ambitious – someone who wouldn’t hesitate to pilfer an idea or sell out a friend to make good TV. But he admits Brügger can be charming and persuasive, and I know what he means. When Brügger outlines his outre philosophies of journalism – of orchestrating scenarios and entering them – you feel like a mug for having arranged an interview in a cafe.</p><p>It’s often unclear what Brügger is setting out to discover, what facts he’s seeking to establish. In The Red Chapel, even as his comedians rehearse on a riverbank, Brügger declares he wants to “expose the very core of the evil in North Korea” – an aim as grand and adolescent as it is vague. (As it happens, he never even makes it out of his minders’ line of sight.) As a Liberian diplomat in The Ambassador, Brügger tries to buy blood diamonds, pretends he wants to start a match factory in Central African Republic (CAR), and arranges to tour a “Pygmy village”. The CAR is a place with no moral boundaries, he tells us, and so it “offers itself as a sort of Jurassic Park for people longing for the Africa of the 1970s”. He circles some sort of exposé – evidence of how illicitly obtained diplomatic papers can be used to smuggle diamonds and commit other crimes – but never quite pins it to the mat. By the end of Cold Case Hammarskjöld, similarly, Brügger has proven no conspiracy. The ride has been weird, but the case remains cold.</p><figure id="2e6dc4ef-c60f-4268-a286-148c4a48ef49" data-spacefinder-role="supporting" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement"><div id="img-4"><picture><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8c99ca4a14df12530b5eafa382a1296885b21dc3/0_0_5463_6963/master/5463.jpg?width=380&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 1300px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 1300px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8c99ca4a14df12530b5eafa382a1296885b21dc3/0_0_5463_6963/master/5463.jpg?width=380&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 1300px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8c99ca4a14df12530b5eafa382a1296885b21dc3/0_0_5463_6963/master/5463.jpg?width=300&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 980px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 980px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8c99ca4a14df12530b5eafa382a1296885b21dc3/0_0_5463_6963/master/5463.jpg?width=300&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 980px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8c99ca4a14df12530b5eafa382a1296885b21dc3/0_0_5463_6963/master/5463.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8c99ca4a14df12530b5eafa382a1296885b21dc3/0_0_5463_6963/master/5463.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 660px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8c99ca4a14df12530b5eafa382a1296885b21dc3/0_0_5463_6963/master/5463.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8c99ca4a14df12530b5eafa382a1296885b21dc3/0_0_5463_6963/master/5463.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 480px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8c99ca4a14df12530b5eafa382a1296885b21dc3/0_0_5463_6963/master/5463.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8c99ca4a14df12530b5eafa382a1296885b21dc3/0_0_5463_6963/master/5463.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 320px)"><img alt="A man leans against a railing with a large tree beside him.

Ulrich Larsen, a retired chef who had watched The Red Chapel, tracked Brügger down in 2010 and volunteered as a spy within the Copenhagen chapter of the Korean Friendship Association. Brügger gave him cameras and instructed him to film everything. “I thought I’d just be showing these Danish guys as Monty Python weirdos doing silly walks,” Larsen told me. Instead, under Brügger’s supervision, Larsen posed so effectively as a sympathiser that he wound up penetrating the heart of North Korea’s influence network better than any full-time spy – and filmed himself doing it, to boot. With an accomplice, he duped North Korean officials into thinking he was setting up a drug and arms factory in Uganda – part of a plan to make enough money to buy North Korea weapons despite prevailing sanctions. The con ran a full decade – so long that Brügger sometimes clean forgot about it for months on end.</p><p>Brügger wouldn’t necessarily quibble with these characterisations of his movies. “I’m a film-maker who craves sensation,” he says in The Mole, and that he does provide. His tone is caustic, his characters are colourful, and his plot twists are what Lotte Folke Kaarsholm, the opinion editor at the Danish daily Politiken, wryly calls “maximalist”. During one of our conversations, Brügger quoted Jørgen Leth, the doyen of Danish documentarians, to describe their line of work as “laying a trap in the forest and then waiting behind a tree to see who falls in”. Later, I looked up the quote and found that Leth had talked about setting a trap for reality, to capture the most authentic version of the world. “We are relaxed, attentive and noncommittal,” he said in a 2000 interview. “Things happen when they happen.” Leth was advocating patience and preparation; Brügger was thinking of a literal trap to tempt someone into making a mistake.</p><hr><p><span>O</span>ne morning in Copenhagen, I visited Smajic’s lawyer, who led me into a conference room, laid his mobile on the table, and dialled her on speakerphone. The previous day, she’d been convicted in a different case of a million-kroner fraud; the following week, she would be sentenced to 18 months in prison. When we spoke, she was still in hiding, but there wasn’t a trace of anxiety in her voice. She complimented me on pronouncing her name correctly, and said she’d spoken to no other journalist since the documentary’s release. Midway through our conversation, while mentioning the episode during which Fasar threatened her, I told her I was appalled that journalists had put her in that position. I did mean it, but it’s also the sort of thing a journalist says, with exaggerated concern, to gain someone’s confidence. “That’s the first time someone has been sympathetic and said that,” she told me – something I knew to be false, because I’d read Danish columnists expressing the same views. Later, I learned that I <a href="https://www.berlingske.dk/indland/muldvarpen-fra-den-sorte-svane-taler-ud-for-foerste-gang-mit-familieliv-er?gaa_at=eafs&amp;gaa_n=AerBZYPjfiiCeAAOO_bRMmuC3e9iqWKjq_DRpaR6qkF8MPzipYwYAYzBjPpHb61Ocqs%3D&amp;gaa_ts=67cc5c96&amp;gaa_sig=2qAhukP5LmbRdoPxyXNVUhC9YQ0PDsHKKBaouYajSeunh_ynmu6epcvlSFrIZC21QUWIFajYL-bBATnf4dyVjw%3D%3D" data-link-name="in body link">was also not</a> the first journalist to interview her about the film.</p><p>Smajic believes she’s a victim of journalistic deceit. The Black Swan was meant to be about her life, she said, with the hidden camera footage being used only sparingly to corroborate her stories. She’d been offered no security during the filming, she said. When TV2 screened the first three episodes for her approval, they were really just raw, unedited clips, she maintained, and in any case, she’d been strongly medicated after a surgery and couldn’t assess them with a clear mind. (“Amira watched the edited episodes, they just needed finalising,” TV2’s Nørgaard told me. “During the four hours she spent with the editorial team that day, she appeared unaffected and seemed coherent, as we also documented in the series.”) Smajic hadn’t been running any other office at the time, she said to me, and in any case, “they hadn’t bought the rights to every single moment in my life”.</p><p>Smajic felt betrayed. “For two years, these people were telling me to go through with it, saying: ‘This is going to be the biggest thing. You’re going to be a star.’” When she began worrying that the documentary would place her in danger, she asked for it to be suspended. “They figured that if they made me out to be a criminal, I wouldn’t have a say,” she told me. Early in 2024, months before The Black Swan was due to be broadcast, Smajic sued for an injunction against the film. A court denied her plea on grounds of public interest. In its verdict, it decided Smajic was fully aware of the project’s risks, the protection that TV2 arranged for her, and the ambit of the documentary.</p><p>Among those who think Smajic was treated poorly is Jacob Mollerup, a veteran of the Danish media and a co-founder of Foreningen for Undersøgende Journalistik (FUJ), an association of investigative journalists. Mollerup described The Black Swan as “an exceptional production”, but argued Brügger had prized his dramatisation too much, abandoning fairness and balance in the bargain. “Normally, you protect your sources, but here they say: ‘Now she’s just a criminal, she broke our contract, so we can set aside her wishes about the production,” Mollerup told me. Hiding Smajic’s ongoing work as a police informant from The Black Swan’s viewers was dishonest, he said. If she was telling her handlers everything about the sting as it happened, that made it an operation implicitly sanctioned by the police – and plunged it into all sorts of ethical murk. Was Smajic inviting into her lair suspects whom the police wanted to nab? Which of the crimes being planned on camera were actually carried out, and how? Mollerup believes journalists must be transparent about their methods and precise in documenting misdeeds. When The Black Swan won an FUJ prize, he gave up his membership. “I told them: ‘This is not what I worked for.’”</p><p>Brügger briskly rejected all of Smajic’s statements. She’d often claimed to be on medication before, he said, including once when she was pleading loss of memory while testifying in another criminal trial. She was merely recycling this excuse to explain to me why she hadn’t objected to the advance cuts of the first three episodes, Brügger told me. On his laptop, he found a photo of a production team’s stakeout that had been in place throughout the sting, in an office near Smajic’s. The team constantly watched the feed from the hidden cameras, ready to summon security if things went south – a setup she knew about, he said. When I wondered if the police had known of Smajic’s parallel adventures in money-laundering, or perhaps even endorsed them for their own purposes, Brügger said: “I find it highly unlikely, but it’s a possibility. The police wouldn’t confirm or deny this anyway.”</p><p>Nothing I learned from Smajic solved the central mystery of The Black Swan: why did she choose to capsize her life by participating at all? Janet Malcolm, the deft vivisectionist of the psyche in journalism, would argue that such masochistic tendencies can be found in anyone who volunteers to talk to the press. But Smajic wasn’t just anyone: she was a habitual lawbreaker, so for her to let a television crew into the darkest corners of her life felt positively self-destructive. Perhaps she did think of exposure as disinfectant, a step towards a cure. Perhaps she believed she could bear any waves of bad press, or even surf them towards fame and freedom. “The thing is,” Brügger said, “with Amira, you can just never be sure of anything.”</p><figure id="a94f231d-1646-4653-90ab-23b5656477f0" data-spacefinder-role="supporting" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement"><div id="img-5"><picture><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6db9843604d2405a4ee4117387639bab135ec3ed/0_0_3500_3364/master/3500.jpg?width=380&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 1300px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 1300px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6db9843604d2405a4ee4117387639bab135ec3ed/0_0_3500_3364/master/3500.jpg?width=380&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 1300px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6db9843604d2405a4ee4117387639bab135ec3ed/0_0_3500_3364/master/3500.jpg?width=300&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 980px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 980px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6db9843604d2405a4ee4117387639bab135ec3ed/0_0_3500_3364/master/3500.jpg?width=300&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 980px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6db9843604d2405a4ee4117387639bab135ec3ed/0_0_3500_3364/master/3500.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6db9843604d2405a4ee4117387639bab135ec3ed/0_0_3500_3364/master/3500.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 660px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6db9843604d2405a4ee4117387639bab135ec3ed/0_0_3500_3364/master/3500.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6db9843604d2405a4ee4117387639bab135ec3ed/0_0_3500_3364/master/3500.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 480px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6db9843604d2405a4ee4117387639bab135ec3ed/0_0_3500_3364/master/3500.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6db9843604d2405a4ee4117387639bab135ec3ed/0_0_3500_3364/master/3500.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 320px)"><img alt="A painting of two woman with dark hair, holding hands.

Despite the lies and lawsuits, Brügger remains magnetised by Smajic. In one conversation, he’d mentioned his sole contribution to the decor of Smajic’s office: a print of The Two Fridas, in which Frida Kahlo painted herself twice, once with a gaping hole in her chest cavity, and again with a healthy heart and a small picture in her hand. “I’d hoped someone would come in and ask about it, but I didn’t prepare Amira for that,” Brügger said. This trap-within-a-trap is sprung in the fourth episode by a motorcycle thug’s curiosity, but Smajic improvises like a maestro. “It’s only when you cut out the heart that you can think coldly and rationally,” she explains. The picture the second Kahlo holds is of her child, Smajic ad-libs: “You can’t be cold if you have a family … That was me then, and this is me now.”</p><p>Brügger was delighted. “It was brilliant. I became so happy and excited when I saw that. It’s my favourite scene.” The journalist may often be cast as the seducer, coaxing information out of people, but he’s just as liable to be seduced – by the mirage of the perfect story, as clean and vivid as a comic book. For Brügger, Smajic had initially promised to provide just that. When she turned out to be staging a perilous deception, throwing his production into chaos, he only grew further enthralled – perhaps because he recognised in Smajic an even more skilled version of himself.</p><hr><p><span>I</span>t’s difficult to feel sorry for Smajic, or for anyone in The Black Swan. The most moving passages in Brügger’s films always involve peripheral players in the great jape: the Ugandan villagers who are told they will be relocated so that an arms factory can be built on their land; or the North Korean interpreter who weeps at the memorial to Kim Il-Sung, claiming she’s mourning him but possibly grieving for some other reason; or the Central African Republicans who take lessons in how to make matches in a factory that Brügger will never build. To his credit, Brügger acknowledges the odd pang of guilt in his voiceovers – but only in passing.</p><p>For The Ambassador, Brügger flew an Indian match-exporter named Sumeet Mehta to the CAR for a few days, ostensibly to train his employees. The Ambassador came out in 2011, but until I called him recently, Mehta didn’t know he’d featured in a documentary – or, indeed, that Brügger was a film-maker and not a diplomat. “I was kind of afraid to go, but I went anyway,” Mehta said, sounding baffled. “I sensed this factory was some kind of gimmick, but I didn’t know the reason behind it.” Ulrich Larsen told me that he wonders about the repercussions that the North Koreans unwittingly cast in The Mole might have suffered. “The rough answer is: I’m not responsible for what the regime does,” Larsen said. He hoped that “Mr Kang”, his translator in Pyongyang, was all right, “but of course, nobody knows. I did what I could. I brought his daughter a Lego.” Like Brügger, Larsen seemed to write it off as the cost of making an engrossing film. As Brügger says in The Red Chapel: “For your sake and mine, I have to lie.”</p><figure id="966ecf39-66e3-45f3-811a-b1a9553c0936" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement"><gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props="{&quot;richLinkIndex&quot;:49,&quot;element&quot;:{&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement&quot;,&quot;prefix&quot;:&quot;Related: &quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Who killed the prime minister?

Most journalists begin their careers at home before venturing farther afield. Brügger’s has run in reverse – in part, I think, because he, too, had once bought into the image of Denmark as a safe, dull place where nothing ever happens. “I’ve come to Africa because <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag">Europe</a> has become old and tired,” he says in The Ambassador – a sentence that could have been uttered by a European man in any of the last half-dozen centuries. It was a backhanded jibe: a suggestion that Europe was no longer troubled by the anarchic social disorder that he desires in his films. The Black Swan showed Brügger can find all that he craves at home: conspiracy, corruption, shape-shifters, sensation, stories that evaporate like dry ice or swallow you like quicksand. The world is full of lies, not least the ones we tell ourselves.</p></div></div>]]></description>

 <p id="h.7totxo172g4m"><span>An analysis of the NSO BLASTPASS iMessage exploit</span></p>
 <p><span>Posted by Ian Beer, Google Project Zero</span></p>
 
 <p><span>On September 7, 2023 Apple </span><span><a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/106361">issued</a></span><span>&nbsp;an out-of-band security update for iOS:</span></p>
 
 <p><span><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhpVzqhKSxPZc0TxpxC_Ka4_MVC3fJD4u9HbPMnh5jE4_tLYK08va_RroD4K3PkzOHV5SLJa8ovjXtUpF5FJRaA2SBW-SFv4fELlDeF8kEznmeBu4Zzi-kV_AMIlQLXBZTgUj9s6WQvkpE041lbp2XmSqGkj4u49X9EQOdNCeum_m1acT1HAul-xsuToi0/s1748/image8.png"><img alt="Release notes for iOS 16.6.1 and iPadOS 16.6.1, including CVE-2023-41064 for ImageIO and CVE-2023-41061 for Wallet, detailing security updates and potential exploitation." src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhpVzqhKSxPZc0TxpxC_Ka4_MVC3fJD4u9HbPMnh5jE4_tLYK08va_RroD4K3PkzOHV5SLJa8ovjXtUpF5FJRaA2SBW-SFv4fELlDeF8kEznmeBu4Zzi-kV_AMIlQLXBZTgUj9s6WQvkpE041lbp2XmSqGkj4u49X9EQOdNCeum_m1acT1HAul-xsuToi0/s1200/image8.png" title="Release notes for iOS 16.6.1 and iPadOS 16.6.1, including CVE-2023-41064 for ImageIO and CVE-2023-41061 for Wallet, detailing security updates and potential exploitation."></a></span></p>
 
 <p><span>Around the same time on September 7th 2023, </span><span><a href="https://citizenlab.ca/2023/09/blastpass-nso-group-iphone-zero-click-zero-day-exploit-captured-in-the-wild/">Citizen Lab published a blog post</a></span><span>&nbsp;linking the two CVEs fixed in iOS 16.6.1 to an "NSO Group Zero-Click, Zero-Day exploit captured in the wild":</span></p>
 
 <p><span>"</span><span>[The target was] an individual employed by a Washington DC-based civil society organization with international offices...</span></p>
 
 <p><span>The exploit chain was capable of compromising iPhones running the latest version of iOS (16.6) without any interaction from the victim.</span></p>
 
 <p><span>The exploit involved PassKit attachments containing malicious images sent from an attacker iMessage account to the victim."</span></p>
 
 <p><span>The day before, on September 6th 2023, Apple </span><span><a href="https://issues.chromium.org/issues/40071416">reported a vulnerability to the WebP project</a></span><span>, indicating in the report that they planned to ship a custom fix for Apple customers the next day.</span></p>
 
 <p><span>The WebP team posted their first </span><span><a href="https://chromium.googlesource.com/webm/libwebp/%2B/902bc9190331343b2017211debcec8d2ab87e17a">proposed fix</a></span><span>&nbsp;in the public git repo the next day, and five days after that on September 12th Google released a </span><span><a href="https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/2023/09/stable-channel-update-for-desktop_12.html">new Chrome stable release</a></span><span>&nbsp;containing the WebP fix. Both Apple and Google marked the issue as exploited in the wild, alerting other integrators of WebP that they should rapidly integrate the fix as well as causing the security research community to take a closer look...</span></p>
 
 <p><span>A couple of weeks later on September 21st 2023, former Project Zero team lead Ben Hawkes (in collaboration with </span><span><a href="https://x.com/mistymntncop">@mistymntncop</a></span><span>) published the </span><span><a href="https://blog.isosceles.com/the-webp-0day/">first detailed writeup</a></span><span>&nbsp;of the root cause of the vulnerability on the </span><span>Isosceles</span><span>&nbsp;Blog. A couple of months later, on November 3rd, a group called </span><span><a href="https://www.darknavy.org/">Dark Navy</a></span><span>&nbsp;published their first blog post: a two-part analysis (</span><span><a href="https://www.darknavy.org/blog/exploiting_the_libwebp_vulnerability_part_1/">Part 1</a></span><span>&nbsp;- </span><span><a href="https://www.darknavy.org/blog/exploiting_the_libwebp_vulnerability_part_2/">Part 2</a></span><span>) of the WebP vulnerability and a </span><span><a href="https://github.com/DarkNavySecurity/PoC/tree/main/CVE-2023-4863">proof-of-concept exploit</a></span><span>&nbsp;targeting Chrome (CVE-2023-4863).</span></p>
 
 
 <p><span>Whilst the Isosceles and Dark Navy posts explained the underlying memory corruption vulnerability in great detail, they were unable to solve another fascinating part of the puzzle: just how exactly do you land an exploit for this vulnerability in a one-shot, zero-click setup? As we'll soon see, the corruption primitive is very limited. Without access to the samples it was almost impossible to know.</span></p>
 
 <p><span>In mid-November, in collaboration with </span><span><a href="https://securitylab.amnesty.org/">Amnesty International Security Lab</a></span><span>, I was able to obtain a number of BLASTPASS </span><span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PKPASS">PKPass</a></span><span>&nbsp;sample files as well as crash logs from failed exploit attempts.</span></p>
 
 <p><span>This blog post covers my analysis of those samples and the journey to figure out how one of NSO's recent zero-click iOS exploits really worked. For me that journey began by immediately taking three months of paternity leave, and resumed in March 2024 where this story begins:</span></p><h3 id="h.l3phtwrgqdig"><span>Setting the scene</span></h3>
 <p><span>For a detailed analysis of the root-cause of the WebP vulnerability and the primitive it yields, I recommend first reading the three blog posts I mentioned earlier (</span><span><a href="https://blog.isosceles.com/the-webp-0day/">Isosceles</a></span><span>, </span><span><a href="https://www.darknavy.org/blog/exploiting_the_libwebp_vulnerability_part_1/">Dark Navy 1</a></span><span>, </span><span><a href="https://www.darknavy.org/blog/exploiting_the_libwebp_vulnerability_part_2/">Dark Navy 2</a></span><span>.) I won't restate their analyses here (both because you should read their original work, and because it's quite complicated!) Instead I'll briefly discuss WebP and the corruption </span><span>primitive the vulnerability</span><span>&nbsp;yields.</span></p><h3 id="h.115gmx6di0dd"><span>WebP</span></h3>
 <p><span><a href="https://developers.google.com/speed/webp">WebP</a></span><span>&nbsp;is a relatively modern image file format, first released in 2010. In reality WebP is actually two completely distinct image formats: </span><span><a href="https://developers.google.com/speed/webp/docs/compression%23lossy_webp">a lossy format</a></span><span>&nbsp;based on the VP8 video codec and a separate </span><span><a href="https://developers.google.com/speed/webp/docs/compression%23lossless_webp">lossless format</a></span><span>. The two formats share nothing apart from both using a </span><span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_Interchange_File_Format">RIFF</a></span><span>&nbsp;container and the string </span><span>WEBP</span><span>&nbsp;for the first chunk name. From that point on (12 bytes into the file) they are completely different. The vulnerability is in the lossless format, with the RIFF chunk name </span><span>VP8L</span><span>.</span></p>
 
 <p><span>Lossless WebP makes extensive use of </span><span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huffman_coding">Huffman coding</a></span><span>; there are at least 10 huffman trees present in the BLASTPASS sample. In the file they're stored as </span><span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canonical_Huffman_code">canonical huffman trees</a></span><span>, meaning that only the code lengths are retained. At decompression time those lengths are converted directly into a two-level huffman decoding table, with the five largest tables all getting squeezed together into the same pre-allocated buffer. The (it turns out not quite) maximum size of these tables is pre-computed based on the number of symbols they encode. If you're up to this part and you're slightly lost, the other three blogposts referenced above explain this in detail.</span></p>
 
 <p><span>With control over the symbol lengths it's possible to define all sorts of strange trees, many of which aren't valid. The fundamental issue was that the WebP code only checked the validity of the tree </span><span>after</span><span>&nbsp;building the decoding table. But the pre-computed size of the decoding table was only correct for </span><span>valid</span><span>&nbsp;trees.</span></p>
 
 <p><span>As the Isosceles blog post points out, this means that a fundamental part of the vulnerability is that triggering the bug </span><span>is</span><span>&nbsp;detected, though after memory has been corrupted, and image parsing stops only a few lines of code later</span><span>. This presents another exploitation mystery: in a zero-click context, how do you exploit a bug where every time the issue is triggered it also stops parsing any attacker-controlled data?</span></p>
 
 <p><span>The second mystery involves the actual corruption primitive. The vulnerability will write a </span><span>HuffmanCode</span><span>&nbsp;structure at a known offset past the end of the huffman tables buffer:</span></p>
 
 <p><span>// Huffman lookup table entry</span></p>
 <p><span>typedef struct {</span></p>
 <p><span>&nbsp; uint8_t bits;</span></p>
 <p><span>&nbsp; uint16_t value;</span></p>
 <p><span>} HuffmanCode;</span></p>
 
 <p><span><a href="https://www.darknavy.org/blog/exploiting_the_libwebp_vulnerability_part_1/%23how-to-control-the-data-to-write">As DarkNavy point out</a></span><span>, whilst the </span><span>bits</span><span>&nbsp;and </span><span>value</span><span>&nbsp;fields are nominally attacker-controlled, in reality there isn't that much flexibility. The fifth huffman table (the one at the end of the preallocated buffer, part of which can get written </span><span>out-of-bounds</span><span>) only has </span><span>40</span><span>&nbsp;symbols, limiting </span><span>value</span><span>&nbsp;to a maximum value of </span><span>39</span><span>&nbsp;(</span><span>0x27</span><span>) and </span><span>bits</span><span>&nbsp;will be between </span><span>1</span><span>&nbsp;and </span><span>7</span><span>&nbsp;(for a second-level table entry). There's a padding byte between </span><span>bits</span><span>&nbsp;and </span><span>value</span><span>&nbsp;which makes the largest value that could be written out-of-bounds </span><span>0x00270007</span><span>. And it just so happens that that's exactly the value which the exploit does write — and they likely didn't have that much choice about it.</span></p>
 
 <p><span>There's also not much flexibility in the huffman table allocation size. The table allocation in the exploit is </span><span>12072</span><span>&nbsp;(</span><span>0x2F28</span><span>) bytes, which will get rounded up to fit within a </span><span>0x3000</span><span>&nbsp;byte libmalloc </span><span>small</span><span>&nbsp;region. The code lengths are chosen such that the overflow occurs like this:</span></p>
 
 <p><span><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgDhw37v8HaNAcUY9lTzT-ePEPn_stvb57BbFv0ktM5_XCGEvQD2Mego6iMH3bBO8EZgWOfhFhg-e5R1YoUquDFdVwBWX6QRHIcccAWJnWQXlxwSU44nDYIQF_MCldcENnaef5JPaCR1Nmam7NrnZD2yng0BPEfrIDnIfww-efdAECA5F4UaSDfGi1dSJY/s766/image10.png"><img alt="Memory layout diagram showing Huffman tables at offset 0x3000 and the structure of a Huffman lookup table entry at offset 0x3058." src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgDhw37v8HaNAcUY9lTzT-ePEPn_stvb57BbFv0ktM5_XCGEvQD2Mego6iMH3bBO8EZgWOfhFhg-e5R1YoUquDFdVwBWX6QRHIcccAWJnWQXlxwSU44nDYIQF_MCldcENnaef5JPaCR1Nmam7NrnZD2yng0BPEfrIDnIfww-efdAECA5F4UaSDfGi1dSJY/s766/image10.png" title="Memory layout diagram showing Huffman tables at offset 0x3000 and the structure of a Huffman lookup table entry at offset 0x3058."></a></span></p>
 
 <p><span>To summarize: The 32-bit value </span><span>0x270007</span><span>&nbsp;will be written </span><span>0x58</span><span>&nbsp;bytes past the end of a </span><span>0x3000</span><span>&nbsp;byte huffman table allocation. And then WebP parsing will fail, and the decoder will bail out.</span></p><h3 id="h.ow3137rwwm6g"><span>Déjà vu?</span></h3>
 <p><span>Long-term readers of the Project Zero blog might be experiencing a sense of déjà vu at this point... haven't I already written a blog post about an NSO zero-click iPhone zero day exploiting a vulnerability in a slightly obscure lossless compression format used in an image parsed from an iMessage attachment?</span></p>
 
 <p><span><a href="https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2021/12/a-deep-dive-into-nso-zero-click.html">Indeed</a></span><span>.</span></p>
 
 <p><span>BLASTPASS has many similarities with </span><span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FORCEDENTRY">FORCEDENTRY</a></span><span>, and my initial hunch (which turned out to be completely wrong) was that this exploit might take a similar approach to build a weird machine using some fancier WebP features. To that end I started out by writing a WebP parser to see what features were actually used.</span></p><h3 id="h.2q4vz1fpty3b"><span>Transformation</span></h3>
 <p><span>In a very similar fashion to </span><span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JBIG2">JBIG2</a></span><span>, WebP also </span><span><a href="https://developers.google.com/speed/webp/docs/webp_lossless_bitstream_specification">supports</a></span><span>&nbsp;invertible transformations on the input pixel data:</span></p>

 <p><span>My initial theory was that the exploit might operate in a similar fashion to FORCEDENTRY and apply sequences of these transformations outside of the bounds of the image buffer to build a weird machine. But after implementing enough of the WebP format in python to parse every bit of the </span><span>VP8L</span><span>&nbsp;chunk it became pretty clear that it was only triggering the Huffman table overflow and nothing more. The VP8L chunk was only </span><span>1052</span><span>&nbsp;bytes, and pretty much all of it was the 10 Huffman tables needed to trigger the overflow.</span></p><h3 id="h.jkdp8pyrc6re"><span>What's in a pass?</span></h3>
 <p><span>Although BLASTPASS is often referred to as an exploit for "the WebP vulnerability", the attackers don't actually just send a WebP file (even though that is supported in iMessage). They send a </span><span><a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/passkit_apple_pay_and_wallet">PassKit</a></span><span>&nbsp;PKPass file, which contains a WebP. There must be a reason for this. So let's step back and actually take a look at one of the sample files I received:</span></p>
 
 <p><span>171K sample.pkpass</span></p>
 
 <p><span>$ file sample.pkpass </span></p>
 <p><span>sample.pkpass: Zip archive data, at least v2.0 to extract, compression method=deflate</span></p>
 
 <p><span>There are five files inside the PKPass zip archive:</span></p>
 
 <p><span>60K &nbsp;background.png</span></p>
 <p><span>5.5M logo.png</span></p>
 <p><span>175B manifest.json</span></p>
 <p><span>18B &nbsp;pass.json</span></p>
 <p><span>3.3K signature</span></p>
 
 <p><span>The 5.5MB </span><span>logo.png</span><span>&nbsp;is the WebP image, just with a </span><span>.png</span><span>&nbsp;extension instead of </span><span>.webp</span><span>:</span></p>
 
 <p><span>$ file logo.png:</span></p>
 <p><span>logo.png: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; RIFF (little-endian) data, Web/P image</span></p>
 
 <p><span>The closest thing to a specification for the PKPass format appears to be the </span><span><a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/PassKit_PG/Creating.html">Wallet Developer Guide</a></span><span>, and whilst it doesn't explicitly state that the </span><span>.png</span><span>&nbsp;files should actually be Portable Network Graphics images, that's presumably the intention. This is yet another parallel with FORCEDENTRY, where a similar trick was used to reach the PDF parser when attempting to parse a GIF.</span></p>
 
 <p><span>PKPass files require a valid signature which is contained in </span><span>manifest.json</span><span>&nbsp;and </span><span>signature</span><span>. The signature has a presumably fake name and more timestamps indicating that the PKPass is very likely being generated and signed on the fly for each exploit attempt.</span></p>
 
 <p><span>pass.json</span><span>&nbsp;is just this:</span></p>
 
 <p><span>{"pass": "PKpass"}</span></p>
 
 <p><span>Finally </span><span>background.png</span><span>:</span></p>
 
 <p><span>$ file background.png </span></p>
 <p><span>background.png: TIFF image data, big-endian, direntries=15, height=16, bps=0, compression=deflate, PhotometricIntepretation=RGB, orientation=upper-left, width=48</span></p>
 
 <p><span>Curious. Another file with a misleading extension; this time a </span><span>TIFF</span><span>&nbsp;file with a </span><span>.png</span><span>&nbsp;extension. </span></p>
 
 <p><span>We'll return to this TIFF later in the analysis as it plays a critical role in the exploit flow, but for now we'll focus on the WebP, with one short diversion:</span></p><h3 id="h.cf35pgn7ecq3"><span>Blastdoor</span></h3>
 <p><span>So far I've only mentioned the WebP vulnerability, but the Apple advisory I linked at the start of this post mentions two separate CVEs:</span></p>
 
 <p><span>The first, CVE-2023-41064 in ImageIO, is the WebP bug (though just to keep things confusing with a different CVE from the upstream WebP fix which is CVE-2023-4863 - they're the same vulnerability though).</span></p>
 
 <p><span>The second, CVE-2023-41061 in "Wallet", is described in the Apple advisory as: "</span><span>A maliciously crafted attachment may result in arbitrary code execution</span><span>".</span></p>
 
 <p><span>The </span><span><a href="https://blog.isosceles.com/the-webp-0day/">Isosceles blog post</a></span><span>&nbsp;hypothesises:</span></p>
 
 <p><span>"</span><span>Citizen Lab called this attack "BLASTPASS", since the attackers found a clever way to bypass the "BlastDoor" iMessage sandbox. We don't have the full technical details, but it looks like by bundling an image exploit in a PassKit attachment, the malicious image would be processed in a different, unsandboxed process. This corresponds to the first CVE that Apple released, CVE-2023-41061.</span><span>"</span></p>
 
 <p><span>This theory makes sense — FORCEDENTRY had a similar trick where the </span><span><a href="https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2022/03/forcedentry-sandbox-escape.html">JBIG2 bug was actually exploited inside </a></span><span><a href="https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2022/03/forcedentry-sandbox-escape.html">IMTranscoderAgent</a></span><span>&nbsp;instead of the more restrictive sandbox of BlastDoor. But in all my experimentation, as well as all the in-the-wild crash logs I've seen, this hypothesis doesn't seem to hold.</span></p>
 
 <p><span>The PKPass file and the images enclosed within </span><span>do</span><span>&nbsp;get parsed inside the BlastDoor sandbox and that's where the crashes occur or the payload executes — later on we'll also see evidence that the </span><span>NSExpression</span><span>&nbsp;payload which eventually gets evaluated expects to be running </span><span>inside</span><span>&nbsp;BlastDoor.</span></p>
 
 <p><span>My guess is that CVE-2023-41061 is more likely referring to the lax parsing of PKPasses which didn't reject images which weren't </span><span>png'</span><span>s.</span></p>
 
 <p><span>In late 2024</span><span>, I received another set of in-the-wild crash logs including two which do in fact strongly indicate that there was also a path to hit the WebP vulnerability in the MobileSMS process, outside the BlastDoor sandbox! Interestingly, the timestamps indicate that these devices were targeted in November 2023, two months after the vulnerability was patched.</span></p>
 
 <p><span>In those cases the WebP code was reached inside the MobileSMS process via a </span><span>ChatKit</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>CKPassPreviewMediaObject</span><span>&nbsp;created by a </span><span>CKAttachmentMessagePartChatItem</span><span>.</span></p><h3 id="h.le24xell6lgv"><span>What's in a WebP?</span></h3>
 <p><span>I mentioned that the </span><span>VP8L</span><span>&nbsp;chunk in the WebP file is only around 1KB. Yet in the file listing above the WebP file is 5.5MB! So what's in the rest of it? Expanding out my WebP parser we see that there's one more RIFF chunk:</span></p>
 
 <p><span>EXIF : 0x586bb8</span></p>
 <p><span>exif is Intel byte alignment</span></p>
 <p><span>EXIF has n_entries=1</span></p>
 <p><span>tag=8769 fmt=4 n_components=1 data=1a</span></p>
 <p><span>subIFD has n_entries=1</span></p>
 <p><span>tag=927c fmt=7 n_components=586b8c data=2c</span></p>
 
 <p><span>It's a (really really huge) </span><span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exif">EXIF</a></span><span>&nbsp;- the standard format which cameras use to store image metadata — stuff like the camera model, exposure time, f-stop etc.</span></p>
 
 <p><span>It's a tag-based format and pretty much all 5.5MB is inside one tag with the id </span><span>0x927c</span><span>. So what's that?</span></p>
 
 <p><span>Looking through an </span><span><a href="https://www.awaresystems.be/imaging/tiff/tifftags/privateifd/exif.html">online list of EXIF tags</a></span><span>&nbsp;just below the lens FocalLength tag and above the UserComment tag we spot </span><span>0x927c</span><span>:</span></p>

 <p><span>It's the very-vague-yet-fascinating sounding: "</span><span>MakerNote - Manufacturer specific information.</span><span>"</span></p>
 
 <p><span>Looking to </span><span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exif">Wikipedia for some clarification</a></span><span>&nbsp;on what that actually is, we learn that </span></p>
 
 <p><span>"the "MakerNote" tag contains information normally in a proprietary binary format."</span></p>
 
 <p><span>Modifying the webp parser to now dump out the MakerNote tag we see:</span></p>
 
 <p><span>$ file sample.makernote </span></p>
 <p><span>sample.makernote: Apple binary property list</span></p>
 
 <p><span>Apple's chosen format for the "proprietary binary format" is binary plist!</span></p>
 
 <p><span>And indeed: looking through the ImageIO library in IDA there's a clear path between the WebP parser, the EXIF parser, the MakerNote parser and the binary plist parser.</span></p><h3 id="h.9tu54e9o1ow0"><span>unbplisting</span></h3>
 <p><span>I covered the binary plist format in </span><span><a href="https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2023/10/an-analysis-of-an-in-the-wild-ios-safari-sandbox-escape.html">a previous blog post</a></span><span>. That was the second time I'd had to analyse a large bplist. The first time (for the FORCEDENTRY sandbox escape) it was possible mostly by hand, just using the human-readable output of </span><span>plutil</span><span>. Last year, for the Safari sandbox escape analysis, the bplist was 437KB and I had to write a custom bplist parser to figure out what was going on. Keeping the exponential curve going this year the bplist was 10x larger again.</span></p>
 
 <p><span>In this case it's fairly clear that the bplist must be a heap groom - and at 5.5MB, presumably a fairly complicated one. So what's it doing?</span></p><h3 id="h.dwp3fpvl5otv"><span>Switching Views</span></h3>
 <p><span>I had a hunch that the bplist would use duplicate dictionary keys as a fundamental building block for the heap groom, but running my parser it didn't output any... until I realised that my tool stored the parsed dictionaries directly as python dictionaries before dumping them. Fixing the tools to instead keep lists of keys and values it became clear that there were duplicate keys. Lots of them:</span></p>
 
 <p><span><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhi8ixELdnlgPEAlry1qJUaZAL0gu_lmlCy2OFHIpWIe3Jdmc89ST1jaPfEyInzGSxxUEbtX5L0dk5d5Z9L1RPSpDS0FDG_PJtCfy-HLcQBMYHZNokkE1XEgizDmBr_5Sww7JxA7joYE7zI0fMbuUt-34d5pXHAHSplO9t7lhzRMk7NObBmdIaPGkEe4eY/s1999/image6.png"><img alt="Screenshot of code showing a series of nested dictionary creations / duplicate keys" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhi8ixELdnlgPEAlry1qJUaZAL0gu_lmlCy2OFHIpWIe3Jdmc89ST1jaPfEyInzGSxxUEbtX5L0dk5d5Z9L1RPSpDS0FDG_PJtCfy-HLcQBMYHZNokkE1XEgizDmBr_5Sww7JxA7joYE7zI0fMbuUt-34d5pXHAHSplO9t7lhzRMk7NObBmdIaPGkEe4eY/s1200/image6.png" title="Screenshot of code showing a series of nested dictionary creations / duplicate keys"></a></span></p>
 
 <p><span>In the Safari exploit writeup I described how I used different visualisation techniques to try to explore the structure of the objects, looking for patterns I could use to simplify what was going on. In this case, modifying the parser to emit well-formed curly brackets and indentation then relying on </span><span><a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">VS Code</a></span><span>'s automatic code-folding proved to work well enough for browsing around and getting a feel for the structure of the groom object.</span></p>
 
 <p><span>Sometimes the right visualisation technique is sufficient to figure out what the exploit is trying to do. In this case, where the primitive is a heap-based buffer overflow, the groom will inevitably try to put two things next to each other in memory and I want to know "what two things?"</span></p>
 
 <p><span>But no matter how long I stared and scrolled, I couldn't figure anything out. Time to try something different.</span></p><h3 id="h.qsa5rb3wbgxp"><span>Instrumentation</span></h3>
 <p><span>I wrote a small helper to load the bplist using the same API as the </span><span>MakerNote</span><span>&nbsp;parser and ran it using the Mac Instruments app:</span></p>
 
 <p><span><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEioXK-ctrJxcKGIj-UEWZpLrFDR6z8L4jtEne1cJrcBpAEM_jYaHWn1NaQ_-DEAf7kZ8PSgrk1pzy11pe9TGfurgmHfFwW3MezoSrdZ_KQJzMUEIjkiL7mWt-gE-3XOiK1ooX7AibTNufcXkAjlWqS-x87ld2xLNm7sDygVVgduf_npeudyoA0645BDRuw/s1999/image1.png"><img alt="Screenshot of Instruments app showing memory allocation with detailed information for the top three categories: 'All Heap &amp; Anonymous...', 'CFString (store)', and 'Malloc 16.00 KiB'" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEioXK-ctrJxcKGIj-UEWZpLrFDR6z8L4jtEne1cJrcBpAEM_jYaHWn1NaQ_-DEAf7kZ8PSgrk1pzy11pe9TGfurgmHfFwW3MezoSrdZ_KQJzMUEIjkiL7mWt-gE-3XOiK1ooX7AibTNufcXkAjlWqS-x87ld2xLNm7sDygVVgduf_npeudyoA0645BDRuw/s1200/image1.png" title="Screenshot of Instruments app showing memory allocation with detailed information for the top three categories: 'All Heap &amp; Anonymous...', 'CFString (store)', and 'Malloc 16.00 KiB'"></a></span></p>
 
 <p><span>Parsing the single 5.5MB bplist causes nearly half a million allocations, churning through nearly a gigabyte of memory. Just looking through this allocation summary it's clear there's lots of </span><span>CFString</span><span>&nbsp;and </span><span>CFData</span><span>&nbsp;objects, likely used for heap shaping. Looking further down the list there are other interesting numbers:</span></p>
 
 <p><span><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhTNContQj1sCDNIzAplyRVfRMR6y1vgjkGkRBbKXdlIrmiVV90kTNmxSvWwcv4iQ7Ju6W_bbrmqoh7k7UoTvytds40F1p7WUWhGmMtk8a5LfZuVNt7P1VjwZJ980-Xee42x_rNEK_HTmGSkPy8xucdhd0eyHj5XCcH3PwPfN5ZmzbNXR0hu_T6UNwZlbE/s1428/image11.png"><img alt="Memory allocation table showing 'All Heap &amp; Anonymous...' using 990.66 MiB of total bytes, with 660.77 MiB being persistent." src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhTNContQj1sCDNIzAplyRVfRMR6y1vgjkGkRBbKXdlIrmiVV90kTNmxSvWwcv4iQ7Ju6W_bbrmqoh7k7UoTvytds40F1p7WUWhGmMtk8a5LfZuVNt7P1VjwZJ980-Xee42x_rNEK_HTmGSkPy8xucdhd0eyHj5XCcH3PwPfN5ZmzbNXR0hu_T6UNwZlbE/s1200/image11.png" title="Memory allocation table showing 'All Heap &amp; Anonymous...' using 990.66 MiB of total bytes, with 660.77 MiB being persistent."></a></span></p>
 
 <p><span>The </span><span>20'000</span><span>&nbsp;in the last line is far too round a number to be a coincidence. This number matches up with the number of </span><span>__NSDictionaryM</span><span>&nbsp;objects allocated:</span></p>

 <p><span>Finally, at the very bottom of the list there are two more allocation patterns which stand out:</span></p>

 <p><span>There are two sets of very large allocations: eighty 1MB allocations and 44 4MB ones.</span></p>
 
 <p><span>I modified my bplist tool again to dump out each unique string or data buffer, along with a count of how many times it was seen and its hash. Looking through the file listing there's a clear pattern:</span></p>

 <p><span>There are a large number of allocations which fall just below a "round" number in hexadecimal: </span><span>0x3ff</span><span>, </span><span>0x13ff</span><span>, </span><span>0x17ff</span><span>, </span><span>0x1fff</span><span>, </span><span>0x23ff</span><span>, </span><span>0x3fff</span><span>... That heavily hints that they are sized to fall exactly within certain allocator size buckets.</span></p>
 
 <p><span>Almost all of the allocations are just filled with zeros or '</span><span>A</span><span>'s. But the 1MB one is quite different:</span></p>

 <p><span>Further on in the hexdump of the 1MB object there's clearly an </span><span>NSExpression</span><span>&nbsp;payload - this payload is also visible just running </span><span>strings</span><span>&nbsp;on the WebP file. Matthias Frielingsdorf from iVerify gave a </span><span><a href="https://i.blackhat.com/Asia-24/Asia-24-Frielingsdorf-YouShallNotPassAnalysing.pdf">talk at BlackHat Asia with an initial analysis of this NSExpression payload</a></span><span>, we'll return to that at the end of this blog post.</span></p>
 
 <p><span>Equally striking (and visible in the hexdump above): there are clearly pointers in there. It's too early in the analysis to know whether this is a payload which gets rebased somehow, or whether there's a separate ASLR disclosure step.</span></p>
 
 <p><span>On a slightly higher level this hexdump looks a little bit like an Objective-C or C++ object, though some things are strange. Why are the first 24 bytes all zero? Why isn't there an isa pointer or vtable? It looks a bit like there are a number of integer fields before the pointers, but what are they? At this stage of the analysis, I had no idea.</span></p><h3 id="h.m4inyehexyvr"><span>Thinking dynamically</span></h3>
 <p><span>I had tried a </span><span>lot</span><span>&nbsp;to reproduce the exploit primitives on a real device; I built tooling to dynamically generate and sign legitimate PKPass files that I could send via iMessage to test devices and I could crash a lot, but I never seemed to get very far into the exploit - the iOS version range where the heap grooming works seems to be pretty small, and I didn't have an exact device and iOS version match to test on.</span></p>
 
 <p><span>Regardless of what I tried: sending the original exploits via iMessage, sending custom PKPasses with the trigger and groom, rendering the WebP directly in a test app or trying to use the PassKit APIs to render the PKPass file the best I could manage dynamically was to trigger a heap metadata integrity check failure, which I assumed was indicative of the exploit failing.</span></p>
 
 <p><span>(Amusingly, using the legitimate APIs to render the PKPass inside an app failed with an error that the PKPass file was malformed. And indeed, the exploit sample PKPass is malformed: it's missing multiple required files. But the "secure" PKPass BlastDoor parser entrypoint (</span><span>PKPassSecurePreviewContextCreateMessagesPreview</span><span>) is, in this regard at least, less strict and will attempt to render an incomplete and invalid PKPass).</span></p>
 
 <p><span>Though getting the whole PKPass parsed was proving tricky, with a bit of reversing it was possible to call the correct underlying CoreGraphics APIs to render the WebP and also get the EXIF/MakerNote parsed. By then setting a breakpoint when the huffman tables were allocated I had hoped it would be obvious what the overflow target was. But it was actually totally unclear what the following object was: (Here </span><span>X</span><span>3</span><span>&nbsp;points to the start of the huffman tables which are </span><span>0x3000</span><span>&nbsp;bytes large)</span></p>
 
 <p><span>(lldb) x/6xg $x3+0x3000</span></p>
 <p><span>0x112000000: 0x0000000111800000 0x0000000000000000</span></p>
 <p><span>0x112000010: 0x00000000001a1600 0x0000000000000004</span></p>
 <p><span>0x112000020: 0x0000000000000001 0x0000000000000019</span></p>
 
 <p><span>The first qword (</span><span>0x111800000</span><span>) is a valid pointer, but this is clearly not an Objective-C object, nor did it seem to look like any other recognizable object or have much to do with either the bplist or WebP. But running the tests a few times, there was a curious pattern:</span></p>
 
 <p><span>(lldb) x/6xg $x3+0x3000</span></p>
 <p><span>0x148000000: 0x0000000147800000 0x0000000000000000</span></p>
 <p><span>0x148000010: 0x000000000019c800 0x0000000000000004</span></p>
 <p><span>0x148000020: 0x0000000000000001 0x0000000000000019</span></p>
 
 <p><span>The huffman table is </span><span>0x2F28</span><span>&nbsp;bytes, which the allocator rounds up to </span><span>0x3000</span><span>. And in both of those test runs, adding the allocation size to the huffman table pointer yielded a suspiciously round number. There's no way that's a coincidence. Running a few more tests the </span><span>table+0x3000</span><span>&nbsp;pointer is always 8MB aligned. I remembered from some presentations on the iOS userspace allocator I'd read that 8MB is a meaningful number.

 <p><span>8MB is the size of the iOS userspace default allocator's small rack regions. It looks like they might be trying to groom the allocator not to target application-specific data but allocator metadata. Time to dive into some libmalloc internals!</span></p><h3 id="h.ghgbtq9u1wm2"><span>libmalloc</span></h3>
 <p><span>I'd suggest reading the two presentations linked above for a good overview of the iOS default userspace malloc implementation</span><span>. Libmalloc manages memory on four levels of abstraction. From largest to smallest those are: rack, magazine, region and block. The size split between the tiny, small and large racks depends on the platform. Almost all the relevant allocations for this exploit come from the small rack, so that's the one I'll focus on.</span></p>
 
 <p><span>Reading through the libmalloc source I noticed that the region trailer, whilst still called a trailer, has been now moved to the start of the region object. The small region manages memory in chunks of 8MB. That 8MB gets split up in to (for our purposes) three relevant parts: a header, an array of metadata words, then blocks of 512 bytes which form the allocations:</span></p>

 <p><span>The small region manages memory in units of 512 bytes called blocks. On iOS allocations from the small region consist of contiguous runs of up to 31 blocks. Each block has an associated 16-bit metadata word called a small meta word, which itself is subdivided into a "free" flag in the most-significant bit, and a 15-bit count.</span></p>
 
 <p><span>To mark a contiguous run of blocks as in-use (belonging to an allocation) the first meta word has its free flags cleared and the count set to the number of blocks in the run. On </span><span>free</span><span>, </span><span>an allocation is first placed on a lookaside list for rapid reuse without freeing. But once an allocation really gets freed the allocator will attempt to greedily coalesce neighbouring chunks. While in-use runs can never exceed 31 blocks, free runs can grow to encompass the entire region.</span></p><h3 id="h.r67dy0s0nxnn"><span>The groom</span></h3>
 <p><span>Below you can see the state of the meta words array for the small region directly following the one containing the huffman table as its last allocation: </span></p>

 <p><span>With some simple maths we can convert indexes in the meta words array into their corresponding heap pointers. Doing that it's possible to dump the memory associated with the allocations shown above. The larger </span><span>0x19</span><span>, </span><span>0x18</span><span>&nbsp;and </span><span>0x1c</span><span>&nbsp;allocations all seem to be generic groom allocations, but the two </span><span>0x3</span><span>&nbsp;block allocations appear more interesting. The first one (with the first metadata word at </span><span>0x14800005a</span><span>, shown in yellow) is the </span><span>code_lengths</span><span>&nbsp;array which gets freed directly after the huffman table building fails. The blue </span><span>0x3</span><span>&nbsp;block run (with the first metadata word at </span><span>0x148000090</span><span>) is the backing buffer for a </span><span>CFSet</span><span>&nbsp;object from the MakerNote and contains object pointers.</span></p>
 
 <p><span>Recall that the corruption primitive will write the dword </span><span>0x270007</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>0x58</span><span>&nbsp;bytes off the end of the </span><span>0x3000</span><span>&nbsp;allocation (and that allocation happens to sit directly in front of this small region).

 <p><span>It's changed the size of an in-use allocation from </span><span>3</span><span>&nbsp;blocks to </span><span>39</span><span>&nbsp;(or from </span><span>1536</span><span>&nbsp;to </span><span>19968</span><span>&nbsp;bytes).

 <p><span>The yellow (</span><span>0x8027</span><span>) allocation now extends beyond its original three blocks and completely overlaps the following green (</span><span>0x18</span><span>) and blue (</span><span>0x3</span><span>) as well as the start of the purple (</span><span>0x1c</span><span>) allocation.</span></p>
 
 <p><span>But as soon as this corruption occurs WebP parsing fails and it's not going to make any other allocations. So what are they doing? How are they able to leverage these overlapping allocations? I was pretty stumped.</span></p>
 
 <p><span>One theory was that perhaps it was some internal ImageIO or BlastDoor specific object which reallocated the overlapping memory. Another theory was that perhaps the exploit had two parts; this first part which puts overlapping entries on the allocator freelist, then another file which is sent to exploit that? And maybe I was lacking that file? But then, why would there be that huge 1MB payload with NSExpressions in it? That didn't add up.</span></p><h3 id="h.swwxr4jh7qvs"><span>Puzzling pieces</span></h3>
 <p><span>As is so often the case, stepping back and not thinking about the problem for a while I realised that I'd completely overlooked and forgotten something critical. Right at the very start of the analysis I had run </span><span>file</span><span>&nbsp;on all the files inside the PKPass and noted that </span><span>background.png</span><span>&nbsp;was actually not a </span><span>png</span><span>&nbsp;but a </span><span>TIFF</span><span>. I had then completely forgotten that. But now the solution seemed obvious: the reason to use a PKPass versus just a WebP is that the PKPass parser will render multiple images in sequence, and there must be something in the TIFF which reallocates the overlapping allocation with something useful.</span></p>

 <p><span>...</span></p>
 
 <p><span>This dumps the uncompressed TIFF strip buffer and this looks much more interesting! There's clearly some structure, though not a lot of it. Is this really enough to do something useful? It looks like there could be some sort of object, but I didn't recognise the structure, and had no idea how replacing an object with this would be useful. I explored two possibilities:</span></p><h4 id="h.w1yajpmi02ag"><span>1) Alpha blending:</span></h4>
 <p><span>This is actually the raw TIFF strip after decompression but before the rendering step which applies the </span><span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_compositing">alpha</a></span><span>, so it was possible that this got rendered "on top" of another object. That seemed like a reasonable explanation for why the object seemed so sparse; perhaps the idea was to just "move" a pointer value. The first 16 bytes of the strip look like this:</span></p>
 
 <p><span>00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 84 13 00 00 01 00 00 00</span></p>
 
 <p><span>which when viewed as two 64-bit values look like this:</span></p>
 
 <p><span>0x0000000000000000 0x0000000100001384</span></p>
 
 <p><span>It seemed sort-of plausible that rendering the </span><span>0x100001384</span><span>&nbsp;on top of another pointer might be a neat primitive, but there was something that didn't quite add up. This pointer-</span><span>ish</span><span>&nbsp;value is at the </span><span>start</span><span>&nbsp;of the strip buffer, so if the overlapping allocation got reallocated with this strip buffer </span><span>directly,</span><span>&nbsp;nothing interesting would happen, as the </span><span>overlapping</span><span>&nbsp;parts are </span><span>further</span><span>&nbsp;along. Maybe the overlapping buffer gets split up multiple times, but this was seeming less and less likely, and I couldn't reproduce this part of the exploit to actually observe what happened.</span></p><h4 id="h.xf2e3zlng30e"><span>2) This is an object:</span></h4>
 <p><span>The other theory I had was that this actually was an object. The 8 zero bytes at the start were certainly strange… </span><span>so then</span><span>&nbsp;what's the significance of the next 8 bytes?</span></p>
 
 <p><span>84 13 00 00 01 00 00 00</span></p>
 
 <p><span>I tried using </span><span>lldb</span><span>'s </span><span>memory find</span><span>&nbsp;command to see if there were other instances of that exact byte sequence occurring in a test iOS app rendering the WebP then the TIFF using the CoreGraphics APIs:</span></p>
 
 <p><span>(lldb) memory find -e 0x100001384 -- 0x100000000 0x200000000</span></p>
 <p><span>data not found within the range.</span></p>
 
 <p><span>Nope, plus it was very, very slow.</span></p>
 
 <p><span>One thing I had noticed was that this byte sequence was similar to one near the start of the 1MB groom object:</span></p>
 
 <p><span>00000000 &nbsp;00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 &nbsp;00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 &nbsp;|................|</span></p>
 <p><span>00000010 &nbsp;00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 &nbsp;</span><span>80 26 00 00 01 00 00 00</span><span>&nbsp; |.........&amp;......|</span></p>

 <p><span>They're not identical, but it seemed a strange coincidence.</span></p>
 
 <p><span>I took a bunch of test app core dumps using </span><span>lldb</span><span>'s </span><span>process save-core</span><span>&nbsp;command and wrote some simple code to search for similar-ish byte patterns. After some experimentation I managed to find something:</span></p>
 
 <p><span>1c7b2600 &nbsp;49 d2 e4 29 02 00 00 01 &nbsp;</span><span>84 13 00 00 02 00 00 00</span><span>&nbsp; |I..)............|</span></p>

 <p><span>It seems that the second byte in </span><span>__cfinfo</span><span>&nbsp;is a type identifier. And indeed, running </span><span>expr (int) CFArrayGetTypeID()</span><span>&nbsp;in </span><span>lldb</span><span>&nbsp;prints: </span><span>19</span><span>&nbsp;(</span><span>0x13</span><span>) which matches up with both the object found in the coredump as well as the strange (or now not so strange) object in the TIFF strip buffer.</span></p><h3 id="h.rn1kanz6est3"><span>X steps forwards, Y steps back</span></h3>
 <p><span>Looking through more of the CoreFoundation code it seems that the object in the TIFF strip buffer is a </span><span>CFArray</span><span>&nbsp;with inline storage containing one element with the value </span><span>0x1234abcd</span><span>. It also seems that it's possible for CF objects to have NULL isa pointers, which explains why the first 8 bytes of the fake object are zero.</span></p>
 
 <p><span>This is interesting, but it still doesn't actually get us any closer to figuring out what the next step of the exploit actually is. If the </span><span>CFArray</span><span>&nbsp;is meant to overlap with something, then what? And what interesting side-effects could having an </span><span>CFArray</span><span>&nbsp;with only a single element with the value </span><span>0x1234abcd</span><span>&nbsp;possibly have?</span></p>
 
 <p><span>This seems like one step forward and two steps back, but there's something else which we can now figure out: what that 1MB groom object actually is. Let's take a look at the start of it again:</span></p>
 
 <p><span>00000000 &nbsp;00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 &nbsp;00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 &nbsp;|................|</span></p>

 <p><span>It looks like another CF object, starting at </span><span>+0x10</span><span>&nbsp;in the buffer with the same NULL isa pointer, a reference count of </span><span>1</span><span>&nbsp;and a </span><span>__cfinfo</span><span>&nbsp;of </span><span>{0x80, 0x26, 0, 0}</span><span>. The type identifiers aren't actually fixed, they're allocated dynamically via calls to </span><span>_CFRuntimeRegisterClass</span><span>&nbsp;like this:</span></p>
 
 <p><span>CFTypeID</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>CFArrayGetTypeID(void)</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>{</span></p>
 <p><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; </span><span>static</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>dispatch_once_t</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>initOnce;</span></p>
 <p><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; </span><span>dispatch_once(&amp;initOnce,</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>^{</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>__kCFArrayTypeID</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>=</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>_CFRuntimeRegisterClass(&amp;__CFArrayClass);</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>});</span></p>
 <p><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; </span><span>return</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>__kCFArrayTypeID;</span></p>
 <p><span>}</span></p>
 
 <p><span>The </span><span>CFTypeID</span><span>s</span><span>&nbsp;are really just indexes into the </span><span>__CFRuntimeClassTable</span><span>&nbsp;array, and even though the types are allocated dynamically the ordering seems sufficiently stable that the hardcoded type values in the exploit work. </span><span>0x26</span><span>&nbsp;is the </span><span>CFTypeID</span><span>&nbsp;for </span><span>CFReadStream</span><span>:</span></p>
 
 <p><span>struct</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>_CFStream</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>{</span></p>

 <p><span>};</span></p>
 
 <p><span>Looking through the </span><span>CFStream</span><span>&nbsp;code it seems to call various callback functions during object destruction — that seems like a very likely path towards code execution, though with some significant caveats:</span></p>
 
 <p><span>Caveat I: It's still unclear how an overlapping allocation in the small malloc region could lead to a </span><span>CFRelease</span><span>&nbsp;being called on this 1MB allocation.</span></p>
 
 <p><span>Caveat II: What about ASLR? There have been some tricks in the past targeting "universal gadgets" which work across multiple slides. Nemo also had </span><span><a href="http://www.phrack.org/issues/69/9.html">a neat objective-c trick</a></span><span>&nbsp;for defeating ASLR in the past, so it's plausible that there's something like that here.</span></p>
 
 <p><span>Caveat III: What about PAC? If it's a data-only attack then maybe PAC isn't an issue, but if they are trying to JOP they'd need a trick beyond just an ASLR leak, as all forward control flow edges should be protected by PAC.</span></p><h3 id="h.w6e9d5pn9dq0"><span>Special Delivery</span></h3>
 <p><span>Around this time in my analysis </span><span><a href="https://x.com/helthydriver">Matthias Frielingsdorf</a></span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>offered me the use of an iPhone running 16.6, the same version as the targeted ITW victim. With Matthias' vulnerable iPhone, I was able to use the </span><span><a href="https://ellekit.space/dopamine/">Dopamine</a></span><span>&nbsp;jailbreak to attach </span><span>lldb</span><span>&nbsp;to </span><span>MessagesBlastDoorService</span><span>&nbsp;and a</span><span>fter a few tries was able to reproduce the exploit right up to the </span><span>CFRelease</span><span>&nbsp;call on the fake </span><span>CFReadStream</span><span>, confirming that that part of my analysis was correct! </span></p>
 
 <p><span>Collecting a few crashes led, yet again, to even more questions...</span></p><h3 id="h.ie8yjj3vyb3y"><span>Caveat I:</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Mysterious Pointers</span></h3>
 
 <p><span>Similar to the analysis of the huffman tables, there was a clear pattern in the fake object pointers, which this time were even stranger than the huffman tables. The crash site was here:</span></p>
 
 <p><span>LDR</span><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; </span><span>X8,</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>[X19,#0x30]</span></p>
 <p><span>LDR</span><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; </span><span>X8,</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>[X8,#0x58]</span></p>
 
 <p><span>At this point </span><span>X19</span><span>&nbsp;points to the fake </span><span>CFReadStream</span><span>&nbsp;object, and collecting a few </span><span>X19</span><span>&nbsp;values there's a pretty clear pattern:</span></p>
 
 <p><span>0x000000075f000010</span></p>
 <p><span>0x0000000d4f000010</span></p>
 
 <p><span>The fake object is inside a 1MB heap allocation, but all those fake object addresses are always 16 bytes above a 16MB-aligned address. It seemed really strange to me to end up with a pointer 0x10 bytes past such a round number. What kind of construct would lead to the creation of such a pointer? Even though I did have a debugger attached to </span><span>MessagesBlastDoorService</span><span>, it wasn't a time-travel debugger, so figuring out the history of such a pointer was non-trivial. Using the same core dump analysis techniques I could see that the pointer which would end up in </span><span>X19</span><span>&nbsp;was also present in the backing buffer of the </span><span>CFSet</span><span>&nbsp;described earlier. But how did it get there?</span></p>
 
 <p><span>Having found the strange </span><span>CFArray</span><span>&nbsp;inside the TIFF I was heavily biased towards believing that this must have something to do with it, so I wrote some tooling to modify the fake </span><span>CFArray</span><span>'s in the TIFF in the exploit. The theory was that by messing with that </span><span>CFArray</span><span>, I could cause a crash when it was used and figure out what was going on. But making minor changes to the strip buffer didn't seem to have any effect — the exploit still worked! Even replacing the entire strip buffer with </span><span>A</span><span>'s didn't stop the exploit working... What's going on?</span></p><h3 id="h.du8xlqhnw8z7"><span>Stepping back</span></h3>
 <p><span>I had made a list of the primitives I thought might lead to the creation of such a strange looking pointer — first on the list was a partial pointer overwrite. But then why the </span><span>CFArray</span><span>? But now having shown that the </span><span>CFArray</span><span>&nbsp;can't be involved, it was time to go back to the list. And step back even further and make sure I'd really looked at all of that TIFF...</span></p>
 
 <p><span>There were still those four other metadata buffers in the </span><span>tiffdump</span><span>&nbsp;output I'd shown earlier:</span></p>
 
 <p><span>700 (0x2bc) BYTE (1) 15347&lt;00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 ...&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span>33723 (0x83bb) UNDEFINED (7) 15347&lt;00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 ...&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span>34377 (0x8649) BYTE (1) 15347&lt;00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 ...&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span>ICC Profile (34675) UNDEFINED (7) 15347&lt;00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 ...&gt;</span></p>
 
 <p><span>I'd just dismissed them, but, maybe I shouldn't have done that? I had actually already dumped the full contents of each of those buffers and checked that there wasn't something else apart from the zeros. They were all zeros, except the third-to-last bytes which were 0x10, which I'd considered completely uninteresting. Uninteresting, unless you wanted to partially overwrite the three least-significant bytes of a little-endian pointer value with 0x000010 that is!</span></p>
 
 <p><span>Let's look back at the SMALL metadata:</span></p>
 
 <p><span>0x148000058: </span><span>0x0007</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>0x8027</span><span>&nbsp;0x0000 0x0000</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>0x0018 0x0000 0x0000 0x0000</span></p>
 <p><span>0x148000068: </span><span>0x0000 0x0000 0x0000 0x0000 0x0000 0x0000 0x0000 0x0000</span></p>
 <p><span>0x148000078: </span><span>0x0000 0x0000 0x0000 0x0000 0x0000 0x0000 0x0000 0x0000</span></p>
 <p><span>0x148000088: </span><span>0x0000 0x0000 0x0000 0x0000</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>0x0003 0x0000 0x0000</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>0x001c</span></p>
 <p><span>0x148000098: </span><span>0x0000 0x0000 0x0000 0x0000 0x0000 0x0000 0x0000 </span><span>0x8027</span></p>
 
 <p><span>Each of those four metadata buffers in the TIFF is </span><span>15347</span><span>&nbsp;bytes, which is </span><span>0x3bf3</span><span>&nbsp;— looked at another way that's </span><span>0x3c00</span><span>&nbsp;(the size rounded up to the next </span><span>0x200</span><span>&nbsp;block size), minus </span><span>5</span><span>, minus </span><span>8</span><span>.</span></p>
 
 <p><span>0x3c00</span><span>&nbsp;is exactly 30 </span><span>0x200</span><span>&nbsp;byte blocks. Each 16-bit word in the metadata array shown above corresponds to one </span><span>0x200</span><span>&nbsp;block, where the overlapping chunk in yellow starts at </span><span>0x14800005a</span><span>. Counting forwards 30 chunks means that the end of a </span><span>0x3c00</span><span>&nbsp;allocation overlaps perfectly with the end of the original blue three-chunk allocation:</span></p>
 
 <p><span>0x148000058: </span><span>0x0007</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>0x8027</span><span>&nbsp;0x0000 0x0000</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>0x0018 0x0000 0x0000 0x0000</span></p>
 <p><span>0x148000068: </span><span>0x0000 0x0000 0x0000 0x0000 0x0000 0x0000 0x0000 0x0000</span></p>
 <p><span>0x148000078: </span><span>0x0000 0x0000 0x0000 0x0000 0x0000 0x0000 0x0000 0x0000</span></p>
 <p><span>0x148000088: </span><span>0x0000 0x0000 0x0000 0x0000</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>0x0003 0x0000 0x0000</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>0x001c</span></p>
 <p><span>0x148000098: </span><span>0x0000 0x0000 0x0000 0x0000 0x0000 0x0000 0x0000 </span><span>0x8027</span></p>
 
 <p><span>This has the effect of overwriting all but the last 16 bytes of the blue allocation with zeros, then overwriting the three least-significant bytes of the second-to-last pointer-sized value with </span><span>0x10 00 00</span><span>; which, if that memory happened to contain a pointer, has the effect of "shifting" that pointer down to the nearest 16MB boundary, then adding </span><span>0x10</span><span>&nbsp;bytes! (For those who saw my </span><span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DZawX9I9MM6Y">2024 Offensivecon talk</a></span><span>, this was the missing link between the overlapping allocations and code execution I mentioned.)</span></p>
 
 
 <p><span>As mentioned earlier, that</span><span>&nbsp;blue allocation</span><span>&nbsp;starting with </span><span>0x0003</span><span>&nbsp;is the backing buffer of a </span><span>CFSet</span><span>&nbsp;object from the bplist inside the WebP MakerNote. The set is constructed in a very precise fashion such that the target pointer (the one to be rounded down) ends up as the second-to-last pointer in the backing buffer. The 1MB object is then also groomed such that it falls on a 16MB boundary below the object which the CFSet entry originally points to. Then when that </span><span>CFSet</span><span>&nbsp;is destructed it calls </span><span>CFRelease</span><span>&nbsp;on each object, causing the fake </span><span>CFReadStream</span><span>&nbsp;destructor to run.</span></p><h3 id="h.vdkjpva8e9lq"><span>Caveat II: ASLR</span></h3>
 <p><span>We've looked at the whole flow from huffman table overflow to </span><span>CFRelease</span><span>&nbsp;being invoked on a fake </span><span>CFReadStream</span><span>&nbsp;— but there's still stuff missing. The second open question I discussed earlier was ASLR. I had theorised that maybe it used a trick like a universal gadget, but is that the case?</span></p>
 
 <p><span>In addition to the samples, I was also able to obtain a number of crash logs from failed exploit attempts where those samples were thrown, which meant I could figure out the ASLR slide of the </span><span>MessagesBlastDoorService</span><span>&nbsp;when the exploit failed. In combination with the target device and exact OS build (also contained in the crash log) I could then obtain the matching </span><span>dyld_shared_cache</span><span>, subtract the runtime ASLR slide from a bunch of the pointer-looking things in the 1MB object and take a look at them. </span></p>
 
 <p><span>The simple answer is:</span><span>&nbsp;the 1MB object contains a large number of hardcoded, pre-slid, valid pointers. There's no weird machine, tricks or universal gadget here. By the time the PKPass is built and sent by the attackers they already know both the target device type and build as well as the runtime ASLR slide of the </span><span>MessagesBlastDoorService</span><span>...</span></p>
 
 <p><span>Based on </span><span><a href="https://iverify.io/post/clipping-wings-our-analysis-of-a-pegasus-spyware-sample">analysis by iVerify</a></span><span>,</span><span>&nbsp;as well as analysis of </span><span><a href="https://citizenlab.ca/2023/04/nso-groups-pegasus-spyware-returns-in-2022/">earlier exploit chains published by Citizen Lab</a></span><span>, my current working theory is that the large amount of HomeKit traffic seen in those cases is likely a separate ASLR/memory disclosure exploit.</span></p><h3 id="h.pybpzzcf990c"><span>Caveat III: Pointer Authentication</span></h3>
 <p><span>In the years since PAC was introduced we've seen a whole spectrum of interesting ways to either defeat, or just avoid, PAC. So what did these attackers do? To understand that let's follow the </span><span>CFReadStream</span><span>&nbsp;destruction code closely. (All these code snippets are from the most recently available version of CF from 2015, but the code doesn't seem to have changed much.)</span></p>
 
 <p><span>Here's the definition of the </span><span>CFReadStream</span><span>:</span></p>
 
 <p><span>static</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>const</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>CFRuntimeClass</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>__CFReadStreamClass</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>=</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>{</span></p>

 <p><span>Looking at the 1MB object again the flags field is the first non-base field:</span></p>

 <p><span>That gives a status code of </span><span>0x1f</span><span>&nbsp;with all the other flags bits clear. This gets through the two conditional branches to reach this close callback call:</span></p>
 
 
 <p><span>&nbsp; </span><span>if</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>(cb-&gt;close)</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>{</span></p>

 <p><span>MOV</span><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span>X19,</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>X0</span></p>

 <p><span>The fake </span><span>CFReadStream</span><span>&nbsp;is the first argument to this function, so passed in the </span><span>X0</span><span>&nbsp;register. It's then stored into </span><span>X19</span><span>&nbsp;so it survives the call to </span><span>__CFStreamGetStatus</span><span>.</span></p>
 
 <p><span>Skipping ahead past the flag checks we reach the callback callsite (this is also the crash site seen earlier):</span></p>
 
 <p><span>LDR</span><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span>X8,</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>[X19,#0x30]</span></p>
 <p><span>...</span></p>
 <p><span>LDR</span><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span>X8,</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>[X8,#0x58]</span></p>
 <p><span>CBZ</span><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span>X8,</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>loc_187076758</span></p>
 <p><span>LDR</span><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span>X1,</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>[X19,#0x28]</span></p>
 <p><span>MOV</span><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span>X0,</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>X19</span></p>
 <p><span>BLRAAZ</span><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </span><span>X8</span></p>
 
 <p><span>Let's walk through each instruction in turn there:</span></p>
 
 <p><span>First it loads the 64-bit value from </span><span>X19+0x30</span><span>&nbsp;into </span><span>X8</span><span>:</span></p>
 
 <p><span>LDR</span><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span>X8,</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>[X19,#0x30]</span></p>
 
 <p><span>Looking at the hexdump of the 1MB object above this will load the value </span><span>0x25846ec20</span><span>.</span></p>
 
 <p><span>From the crash reports we know the runtime ASLR slide of the </span><span>MessagesBlastDoorService</span><span>&nbsp;when this exploit was thrown was </span><span>0x3A8D0000</span><span>, so subtracting that we can figure out where in the shared cache this pointer should point:</span></p>
 
 <p><span>0x25846ec20-0x3A8D0000=0x21DB9EC20</span></p>
 
 <p><span>It points into the </span><span>__const</span><span>&nbsp;segment of the </span><span>TextToSpeechMauiSupport</span><span>&nbsp;library in the shared cache:</span></p>
 
 <p><span><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEisVBydDqsc93nYCwXZuJdCfA16RTdCOLAgDG0jBVQ1_qAmFpkdYPTzqHv4W69SbzLVBkNd9lgBoy8m3EWOfwDpS9EKDxwWt35m1eJnpER6E2UxaG3e8tBYdBwxA7bHvMuvUzH2zRNYj-C1HfRQHrOAI5qWHBVm9E4XYMWV8q-Wu0qk0j4-hEyYMEGxuWc/s1999/image14.png"><img alt="Assembly code snippet with the memory address 000000021DB9EC20 highlighted, followed by DataSectionWriter function definitions." src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEisVBydDqsc93nYCwXZuJdCfA16RTdCOLAgDG0jBVQ1_qAmFpkdYPTzqHv4W69SbzLVBkNd9lgBoy8m3EWOfwDpS9EKDxwWt35m1eJnpER6E2UxaG3e8tBYdBwxA7bHvMuvUzH2zRNYj-C1HfRQHrOAI5qWHBVm9E4XYMWV8q-Wu0qk0j4-hEyYMEGxuWc/s1200/image14.png" title="Assembly code snippet with the memory address 000000021DB9EC20 highlighted, followed by DataSectionWriter function definitions."></a></span></p>
 
 <p><span>The next instruction adds </span><span>0x58</span><span>&nbsp;to that TextToSpeechMauiSupport pointer and reads a 64-bit value from there:</span></p>
 
 <p><span>LDR</span><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span>X8,</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>[X8,#0x58]</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>//</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>x8</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>:=</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>[0x21DB9EC20+0x58]</span></p>
 
 <p><span>This loads the pointer to the function </span><span>_DataSectionWriter_CommitDataBlock</span><span>&nbsp;from </span><span>0x21DB9EC78</span><span>.</span></p>
 
 <p><span>IDA is simplifying something for us here: the function pointer loaded there is actually signed with the </span><span><a href="https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2019/02/examining-pointer-authentication-on.html">A-family instruction key</a></span><span><a href="https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2019/02/examining-pointer-authentication-on.html">&nbsp;with a zero context</a></span><span>. This signing happens transparently (either during load or when the page is faulted in).</span></p>
 
 <p><span>The remaining four instructions then check that the pointer wasn't </span><span>NULL</span><span>, load </span><span>X1</span><span>&nbsp;from offset </span><span>+0x28</span><span>&nbsp;in the fake 1MB object, move the pointer to the fake object back into </span><span>X0</span><span>&nbsp;and call the PAC'ed </span><span>_DataSectionWriter_CommitDataBlock</span><span>&nbsp;function pointer via </span><span>BLRAAZ</span><span>:</span></p>
 
 <p><span>CBZ</span><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span>X8,</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>loc_187076758</span></p>
 <p><span>LDR</span><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span>X1,</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>[X19,#0x28]</span></p>
 <p><span>MOV</span><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span>X0,</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>X19</span></p>
 <p><span>BLRAAZ</span><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </span><span>X8</span></p>
 <h3 id="h.85z2ks5ykaev"><span>Callback-Oriented Programming</span></h3>
 <p><span>A well-known attack against PAC is to swap two valid, PAC'ed pointers which are signed in the same way but point to different places (e.g. swapping two function pointers with different semantics, allowing you to exploit those semantic differences).</span></p>
 
 <p><span>Since a large number of PAC-protected pointers are signed with the A-family instruction key with a zero-context value, there are a large number of pointers to choose from. "Just" having an ASLR defeat shouldn't be enough to achieve this though; surely you'd need to disclose the actual PAC'ed pointer value? But that's not what happened above.</span></p>
 
 <p><span>Notice that the </span><span>CFStream</span><span>&nbsp;objects don't directly contain the callback function pointers — there's an extra level of indirection. The </span><span>CFStream</span><span>&nbsp;object contains a pointer </span><span>to</span><span>&nbsp;a callback structure, and </span><span>that</span><span>&nbsp;structure has the PAC'd function pointers. And crucially: that first pointer, the one </span><span>to</span><span>&nbsp;the callbacks structure, isn't protected by PAC. This means that the attackers can freely swap pointers to callback structures, operating one-level removed from the function pointers.</span></p>
 
 <p><span>This might seem like a severe constraint, but the dyld_shared_cache is vast and there are easily enough pre-existing callback structures to build a "callback-oriented JOP" chain, chaining together unsigned pointers to signed function pointers.</span></p>
 
 <p><span>The initial portion of the payload is a large callback-oriented JOP chain which is used to bootstrap the evaluation of the next payload stage, a large NSExpression.</span></p><h3 id="h.x0b2urrhmfz4"><span>Similarities</span></h3>
 <p><span>There are a number of similarities between this exploit chain and PWNYOURHOME, an earlier exploit also attributed by CitizenLab to NSO, </span><span><a href="https://citizenlab.ca/2023/04/nso-groups-pegasus-spyware-returns-in-2022/">described in this blog post in April 2023</a></span><span>.</span></p>
 
 <p><span>That chain also had an initial stage targeting HomeKit, followed by a stage targeting </span><span>MessagesBlastDoorService</span><span>&nbsp;and also involving a </span><span>MakerNote</span><span>&nbsp;object — the Citizen Lab post claims that at the time the </span><span>MakerNote</span><span>&nbsp;was inside a PNG file. My guess would be that that PNG was being used as the delivery mechanism for the </span><span>MakerNote</span><span>&nbsp;bplist heap grooming primitives discussed in this post.</span></p>
 
 <p><span>Based on Citizen Lab's description it also seems like PWNYOURHOME was leveraging a similar callback-oriented JOP technique, and it seems likely that there was also a HomeKit-based ASLR disclosure. The PWNYOURHOME post has a couple of extra details around a minor fix which Apple made, preventing parsing of "</span><span>certain HomeKit messages unless they arrive from a plausible source.</span><span>" But there still aren't enough details to figure out the underlying vulnerability or primitive. It seems likely to me that the same issue, or a variant thereof was still in use in BLASTPASS.</span></p><h3 id="h.x3s02rsriugj"><span>Key material</span></h3>
 <p><span>Matthias from iVerify presented an </span><span><a href="https://i.blackhat.com/Asia-24/Asia-24-Frielingsdorf-YouShallNotPassAnalysing.pdf">initial analysis of the NSExpression payload at BlackHat Asia</a></span><span>&nbsp;in April 2024. In early July 2024, Matthias and I took a closer look at the final stages of the NSExpression payload which decrypts an AES-encrypted NSExpression and executes it.</span></p>
 
 <p><span>It seems very likely that the encrypted payload contains a BlastDoor sandbox escape. Although the BlastDoor sandbox profile is fairly restrictive it still allows access to a number of system services like </span><span>notifyd</span><span>, </span><span>logd</span><span>&nbsp;and </span><span>mobilegestalt</span><span>. In addition to the syscall attack surface there's also a non-trivial IOKit driver attack surface:</span></p>

 <p><span>...</span></p>
 
 <p><span>(This profile snippet was generated using the </span><span><a href="https://github.com/cellebrite-labs/sandblaster">Cellebrite labs' fork of SandBlaster</a></span><span>)</span></p>
 
 <p><span>In FORCEDENTRY the sandbox escape was contained directly in the NSExpression payload (though that was an escape from the less-restrictive IMTranscoderAgent sandbox). This time around it seems extra care has been taken to prevent analysis of the sandbox escape.</span></p>
 
 <p><span>The question is: where does the key come from? We had a few theories:</span></p>
 <ul><li><span>Perhaps the key is just obfuscated, and by completely reversing the </span><span>NSExpression</span><span>&nbsp;payload we can find it?</span></li><li><span>Perhaps the key is derived from some target-specific information?</span></li><li><span>Perhaps the key was somehow delivered in some other way and can be read from inside BlastDoor?</span></li></ul>
 
 <p><span>We spent a day analysing the NSExpression payload and concluded that the third theory appeared to be the correct one. The NSExpression walks up the native stack looking for the communication ports back to </span><span>imagent</span><span>. It then hijacks that communication, effectively taking over responsibility for parsing all subsequent incoming requests from </span><span>imagent</span><span>&nbsp;for "defusing" of iMessage payloads. The NSExpression loops 100 times, parsing incoming requests as XPC messages, reading the </span><span>request</span><span>&nbsp;xpc dictionary then the </span><span>data</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>xpc data</span><span>&nbsp;object to get access to the raw, binary iMessage format. It waits until the device receives another iMessage with a specific format, and from that message extracts an AES key which is then used to decrypt the next NSExpression stage and evaluate it.</span></p>
 
 <p><span>We were unable to recover any messages with the matching format and therefore unable to analyse the next stage of the exploit.</span></p><h3 id="h.kwbzpb78bv4k"><span>Conclusion</span></h3>
 <p><span>In contrast to FORCEDENTRY, BLASTPASS's separation of the ASLR disclosure and RCE phases mitigated the need for a novel weird machine. Whilst the heap groom was impressively complicated and precise, the exploit still relied on well-known exploitation techniques. Furthermore, the MakerNote bplist groom and callback-JOP PAC defeat techniques appear to have been in use for multiple years, based on similarities with </span><span><a href="https://citizenlab.ca/2023/04/nso-groups-pegasus-spyware-returns-in-2022/">Citizenlab's blogpost in 2023</a></span><span>, which looked at devices compromised in 2022. </span></p>
 
 <p><span>Enforcing much stricter requirements on the format of the bplist inside the MakerNote (for example: a size limit or a strict-parser mode which rejects duplicate keys) would seem prudent. The callback-JOP issue is likely harder to mitigate.</span></p>
 
 <p><span>The HomeKit aspect of the exploit chain remains mostly a mystery, but it seems very likely that it was somehow involved in the ASLR disclosure. </span><span><a href="https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2021/01/a-look-at-imessage-in-ios-14.html">Samuel Groß's post "A Look at iMessage in iOS 14"</a></span><span>&nbsp;in 2021,</span><span>&nbsp;mentioned that Apple added support for re-randomizing the shared cache slide of certain services. Ensuring that BlastDoor has a unique ASLR slide could be a way to mitigate this.</span></p>
 
 <p><span>This is the second in-the-wild NSO exploit which relied on simply renaming a file extension to access a parser in an unexpected context which shouldn't have been allowed. </span></p>
 
 <p><span>FORCEDENTRY had a .gif which was really a .pdf. </span></p>
 
 <p><span>BLASTPASS had a .png which was really a .webp. </span></p>
 
 <p><span>A basic principle of sandboxing is treating all incoming attacker-controlled data as untrusted, and not simply trusting a file extension.</span></p>
 
 <p><span>This speaks to a broader challenge in sandboxing: that current approaches based on process isolation can only take you so far. They increase the length of an exploit chain, but don't necessarily reduce the size of the initial remote attack surface. Accurately mapping, then truly reducing the scope of that initial remote attack surface should be a top priority.</span></p>

The free version of this new edition is now available at
</p>



<p>
This new edition has been the occasion to overhaul the presentation in
many places, but its main purpose is the update to the new C standard,
<a href="https://www.iso.org/standard/82075.html">C23</a>.  The goal was to publish this new edition of Modern C at the same
time as the new C standard goes through the procedure of ISO
publication. The closest approximation of the contents of the new
standard in a publically available document can be found <a href="https://www.open-std.org/JTC1/SC22/WG14/www/docs/n3220.pdf">here</a>.  New
releases of major compilers already implement most of the new features
that it brings.
</p>

<p>
Among the most noticeable changes and additions that we handle are
those for integers: there are new bit-precise types coined
<code>_BitInt(N)</code>, new C library headers <code>&lt;stdckdint.h&gt;</code> (for arithmetic
with overflow check) and <code>&lt;stdbit.h&gt;</code> (for bit manipulation),
possibilities for 128 bit types on modern architectures, and
substantial improvements for enumeration types. Other new concepts in
C23 include a <code>nullptr</code> constant and its underlying type, syntactic
annotation with attributes, more tools for type generic programming
such as type inference with <code>auto</code> and <code>typeof</code>, default
initialization with <code>{}</code>, even for variable length arrays, and
<code>constexpr</code> for name constants of any type. Furthermore, new material
has been added, discussing compound expressions and lambdas, so-called
“internationalization”, a comprehensive approach for program failure.
</p>

<p>
Also added has been an appendix and a temporary include header for an
easy transition to C23 on existing platforms, that will allow you to
start off with C23 right away.

            <span>Abstract:</span>We present DeepSeek-V3, a strong Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) language model with 671B total parameters with 37B activated for each token. To achieve efficient inference and cost-effective training, DeepSeek-V3 adopts Multi-head Latent Attention (MLA) and DeepSeekMoE architectures, which were thoroughly validated in DeepSeek-V2. Furthermore, DeepSeek-V3 pioneers an auxiliary-loss-free strategy for load balancing and sets a multi-token prediction training objective for stronger performance. We pre-train DeepSeek-V3 on 14.8 trillion diverse and high-quality tokens, followed by Supervised Fine-Tuning and Reinforcement Learning stages to fully harness its capabilities. Comprehensive evaluations reveal that DeepSeek-V3 outperforms other open-source models and achieves performance comparable to leading closed-source models. Despite its excellent performance, DeepSeek-V3 requires only 2.788M H800 GPU hours for its full training. In addition, its training process is remarkably stable. Throughout the entire training process, we did not experience any irrecoverable loss spikes or perform any rollbacks. The model checkpoints are available at <a href="https://github.com/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3" rel="external noopener nofollow">this https URL</a>.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                    <p dir="ltr">Apple has introduced DJ with Apple Music, which enables&nbsp;<a href="https://www.musicweek.com/digital/read/apple-music-launches-replay-2024-and-reveals-year-end-charts/090980"><span>Apple Music</span></a><span> subscribers to build and mix sets directly from the streaming services catalogue.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr">The feature is integrated with DJ software and hardware platforms AlphaTheta, Serato and InMusic’s Engine DJ, Denon DJ, Numark, and Rane DJ. It builds on an integration with Algoriddim's Djay Pro software.</p>
<p dir="ltr">DJs at all levels will have access to Apple Music’s catalogue of more than 100 million songs to create and rehearse their sets on any of these DJ software and hardware platforms&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Apple Music is committed to supporting DJs,” said<a href="https://www.musicweek.com/live/read/apple-music-and-the-warehouse-project-to-release-spatial-audio-dj-sets/090349"> Stephen Campbell, global head of dance, electronic &amp; DJ mixes at Apple Music</a>. “With this latest integration, we’re taking that commitment even further – seamlessly connecting Apple Music with the industry’s leading DJ software and hardware. This innovation brings the full power of Apple Music into the creative workflow, making it easier than ever for DJs to access, play, and discover music in real time.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Users can also access a new dedicated DJ with Apple Music category page, spotlighting a series of DJ-friendly editorial playlists, along with new curator pages for each DJ software and hardware platform that will showcase any mixes or sample playlists that can be used to practice.</p>
<p dir="ltr">"The integration of Djay with Apple Music across mobile, desktop, and spatial devices opens up a world of creative possibilities for both beginners and seasoned pros,” said Karim Morsy, CEO at Algoriddim. “With instant access to Apple Music’s catalogue of over 100 million songs, <a href="https://www.musicweek.com/digital/read/apple-music-monetises-dj-mixes-for-creators-and-rights-holders/084104">DJs can mix anytime</a>, anywhere – transforming the way they discover and play their favorite music. Whether using Automix for a seamless, hands-free experience or crafting their own unique sets with djay’s powerful mixing tools, this integration marks a major milestone in making DJing more accessible than ever.”</p>
<blockquote>

<p dir="ltr">“We are thrilled to bring this integration with Apple Music to DJs around the world and in their creative process," said Yoshinori Kataoka, president and CEO of AlphaTheta. "This marks a significant step forward in making DJing more accessible, and we couldn’t be more excited about the possibilities it opens up.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">"At inMusic, our goal has always been to empower DJs with innovative tools that enhance creativity and performance,” said Morgan Donoghue, VP marketing, DJ brands at InMusic. “Integrating Apple Music into our Engine DJ platforms marks a major step forward, giving DJs instant access to a vast library of over 100 million tracks and expertly curated playlists to build and refine their sets with ease. This collaboration ensures DJs at every level can seamlessly discover, play, and integrate new music into their creative workflow."</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Teaming up with Apple Music is a milestone moment for Serato’s artist community,” said Young Ly, CEO at Serato. “We are excited to see established and new DJs alike combine their passion and creativity with access to one of the largest streaming catalogues in the world.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">DJ with Apple Music builds upon <a href="https://www.musicweek.com/digital/read/apple-music-expands-live-global-radio-offering-with-three-stations/091020">Apple Music’s DJ Mixes</a>, a programme that launched on the platform in September 2021 with a collection of thousands of sets.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">In December, Apple Music also launched Apple Music Club, a live global radio station with curated DJ mixes.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Today’s launch aims to expand on that relationship by encouraging DJs to use this integrated experience as a creative tool, allowing them to access and find inspiration in their libraries more easily,” concluded the statement.</p>

            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <div data-role="selectable">
    <p>Encased in the skull, perched atop the spine, the brain has a carefully managed existence. It receives only certain nutrients, filtered through <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/how-the-brain-protects-itself-from-blood-borne-threats-20230620/">the blood-brain barrier</a>; an elaborate system of protective membranes surrounds it. That privileged space contains a mystery. For more than a century, scientists have wondered: If it’s so hard for anything to get into the brain, how does waste get out?</p>
<p>The brain has one of the highest metabolisms of any organ in the body, and that process must yield by-products that need to be removed. In the rest of the body, blood vessels are shadowed by a system of lymphatic vessels. Molecules that have served their purpose in the blood move into these fluid-filled tubes and are swept away to the lymph nodes for processing. But blood vessels in the brain have no such outlet. Several hundred kilometers of them, all told, seem to thread their way through this dense, busily working tissue without a matching waste system.</p>
<p>However, the brain’s blood vessels are surrounded by open, fluid-filled spaces. In recent decades, the cerebrospinal fluid, or CSF, in those spaces has drawn a great deal of interest. “Maybe the CSF can be a highway, in a way, for the flow or exchange of different things within the brain,” said Steven Proulx, who studies the CSF system at the University of Bern.</p>
<p>A recent paper in <em>Cell</em> contains a new report about <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2024.11.027">what is going on around the brain</a> and in its hidden cavities. A team at the University of Rochester led by the neurologist <a href="https://www.urmc.rochester.edu/labs/nedergaard">Maiken Nedergaard</a> asked whether the slow pumping of the brain’s blood vessels might be able to push the fluid around, among, and in some cases through cells, to potentially drive a system of drainage. In a mouse model, researchers injected a glowing dye into CSF, manipulated the blood vessel walls to trigger a pumping action, and saw the dye concentration increase in the brain soon after. They concluded that the movement of blood vessels might be enough to move CSF, and possibly the brain’s waste, over long distances.</p>
<p>The team took a further step in their interpretation. Because this kind of pumping — distinct from the familiar pulse from the heart — is regularly observed during sleep, they suggest that perhaps their observations can help explain why sleep feels refreshing. But it’s a hypothesis that <a href="https://www.thetransmitter.org/glymphatic-system/maiken-nedergaards-power-of-disruption/">not everyone agrees is well founded</a>. When it comes to ascribing purpose to the fluid moving through the brain, many researchers believe that the truth is still elusive.</p>
<h2><strong>Brain Drain</strong></h2>
<p>At the center of the brain are flooded caverns, like great cisterns shrouded in darkness, called ventricles. Cerebrospinal fluid seeps from the ventricle walls and then moves. Under pressure, it emerges elsewhere within the skull, flows down the neck and enters the spine.</p>

                            <p>The neurologist Maiken Nedergaard’s “glymphatic hypothesis” proposes that cerebrospinal fluid helps drain waste from the brain during sleep. Her evidence is highly debated.</p>

    <p>Scientists have known for more than a century that, <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2094440/">at the moment of death</a>, CSF flows from the spine into the brain. This suggests that the living brain somehow keeps the stuff moving, but no one knows exactly how or where it flows. Any arrows drawn on diagrams of the brain and skull to show its movement should not be taken as the complete truth.</p>
<p>“Everyone accepts that there must be some kind of flow here,” said <a href="https://ki.se/en/people/christer-betsholtz">Christer Betsholtz</a>, a professor of vascular biology at the Karolinska Institute in Sweden. “About half a liter of CSF is produced in the ventricles every day, and it has to get out. People are still fighting about where the cerebrospinal fluid gets out.”</p>

<p>Also under discussion is whether it picks up waste on the way out of the brain and, crucially, how. There is good evidence that small molecules, at least, can diffuse through the spaces between cells, make their way to the CSF, and <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-804279-3.00002-2">ride it out of the brain</a>. In fact, some researchers believe that the entire system works by way of passive diffusion.</p>
<p>In 2012, results from Nedergaard’s lab suggested a more active process. Nedergaard, along with the neurologist <a href="https://psychiatry.uw.edu/profile/jeff-iliff/">Jeffrey Iliff</a>, then a postdoc in her lab, and their colleagues, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/scitranslmed.3003748">injected a tracer into cerebrospinal fluid</a> and watched it quickly arrive elsewhere. How did it get from one place to another? They proposed that the spaces around blood vessels commune with even smaller spaces deep in the brain, between individual cells. They also suggested that CSF moves through brain cells called astrocytes into those spaces. There, the fluid might drop off some molecules and pick up others; it may then wend its way back out to the spaces around blood vessels, and thence move waste out of the brain. All of this would have to be driven by a flow of uncertain mechanism.</p>
<p>It was a striking idea. Nedergaard, who is the senior author of the new paper, and colleagues soon made it more striking by linking it to another mystery: why sleep seems to be beneficial. In a 2013 paper, her team wrote that there was <a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/science.1241224">more movement of cerebrospinal fluid</a> in sleeping and anesthetized mice than in waking ones — and that perhaps during sleep CSF sweeps waste out of the brain. Maybe this “brainwashing,” as headlines described it, could provide one reason <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/what-we-know-why-need-sleep-quanta-magazine-sojqe">why sleep is necessary</a>, and explain how much better we feel after a good night of it.</p>

    <p>“I’m of the strong belief that the restorative part of sleep is not memory consolidation,” Nedergaard said. “Maybe it is partly. But it is really the housekeeping function of sleep that is important.”</p>
<p>In the years since those initial studies, <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=glymphatic&amp;page=1">a large number of papers</a> referencing this brain-drainage theory, called the glymphatic hypothesis, have been published. It’s a catchy idea, but parts of the story <a href="https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.27679">raise red flags</a> to some researchers who study the brain’s vasculature.</p>
<p><a href="https://profiles.ucsf.edu/alan.verkman">Alan Verkman</a>, a professor emeritus at the University of California, San Francisco who studies fluid flow in the body, has argued that some aspects of the theory are physically implausible — for instance, the channels said to let the fluid in cannot actually play the role demanded of them. According to Betsholtz, there is no evidence that fluid is moving into the spaces around blood vessels that leave the brain.</p>
<p>But many other researchers appear to have accepted the glymphatic hypothesis. That’s because it fills a hole in our understanding of the brain, said <a href="https://mcdonald.ucsf.edu/our-research">Donald McDonald</a>, who studies blood and lymph vessels at the UCSF School of Medicine. Personally, he doesn’t feel that the theory holds water, but he acknowledges its popularity. It fits comfortably in the space where there is a mystery.</p>
<h2><strong>Ebb and Flow</strong></h2>

<p>Imagine a sealed bottle of water. To study that fluid in its natural state, you have to cut a hole in the bottle. This is the difficulty that scientists studying CSF flow have to deal with. “If you are studying a fluid and you put a hole in the system, you really change it,” said <a href="https://imes.mit.edu/people/lewis-laura">Laura Lewis</a>, a professor of neuroscience at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. “Fluid dynamics are really easily disturbed by invasive procedures.” Further, so many behaviors that living animals perform, such as breathing and having a heartbeat, directly affect the fluid.</p>
<p>Building a case for a new hypothesis in this area, then, is tricky. In the Nedergaard group’s recent <em>Cell</em> paper, the team wanted to explore <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2024.11.027">an intriguing connection</a> that would not only explain how CSF could be pumped between brain cells, but also link that process to sleep.</p>
<p>For the study, mice underwent surgery to have sensors, wires and tubes implanted within the brain — one way to study the bottle of water. The researchers’ goal was to inject tracer dye into CSF at one point in the brain and then track its oscillations and dynamics while the mice slept.</p>
<p>The data showed that, while mice were in their non–rapid eye movement (NREM) phase of sleep, the concentration of tracer moved rhythmically. From a sensor perched above the brain surface, the researchers saw a pattern of increases and decreases, according to first author Natalie Haugland. “It had this wave pattern.”</p>
<p>What could be driving this rhythmic flow? The researchers thought of the neurotransmitter norepinephrine, which causes blood vessels to constrict. “Norepinephrine is very well known for controlling blood flow,” Nedergaard said. It’s possible, they thought, that vessels constricting and relaxing could put enough force on the surrounding cerebrospinal fluid to push it through the brain’s tissues.</p>

    <p>What’s more, during NREM sleep norepinephrine levels change rhythmically. This neurotransmitter could help tie together their hypotheses — the physical movement of CSF through brain tissues and the “brainwashing” occurring during sleep.</p>
<p>The team engineered mice in which they could switch the production of the neurotransmitter on and off. When norepinephrine levels went up, the volume of CSF in the brain went up, they saw, suggesting that it was somehow altering the fluid’s flow.</p>

<p>Then, to test whether the pumping of blood vessels could move CSF, the team engineered mice with blood vessel walls they could manipulate directly. Instead of pumping the vessels slowly, as happens naturally, they moved the walls quickly — once every 10 seconds rather than once every 50. “When we did this, we increased CSF flow on one side of the brain” in a very small area where they were pumping, Haugland said. “It was very local. … Everywhere else in the brain it was the same.”</p>
<p>For Nedergaard, Haugland and their collaborators, the findings tie together norepinephrine, the physical movement of blood vessels, and the flow of CSF in the brain. Nedergaard also asserts that the results are consistent with her group’s earlier finding that there is more brain drainage during sleep than during wakefulness.</p>
<p>“We have been searching for why the glymphatic [system] primarily works when we sleep for a long time,” Nedergaard said. “The paper is really about: Now we’ve found the motor or the driver of how we wash the brain when we sleep.”</p>
<p>However, to critics of the theory, there are still too many open spaces.</p>
<h2><strong>Under Pressure</strong></h2>

<p>McDonald, of the UCSF School of Medicine, pointed out that the work is complex and requires many intricate methods. However, he’s concerned that Nedergaard is working backward: seeking an explanation for her hypothesis rather than trying to find out how the system actually works. “In this paper, it’s unclear what is interpretation and what is data,” he said. “Very early on, their interpretation gets substituted for what actually are the data.” He pointed to schematics showing flow dynamics that he doesn’t see supported, for instance.</p>
<p>Proulx questioned whether the tracer dye moved via an active force at all. The molecule is so small that it could be traveling by diffusion, he said. He imagines an experiment, using techniques Nedergaard’s lab has used before, where a large molecule is infused into the CSF. If the rhythmic releases of norepinephrine correlate with the arrival of a larger tracer at a sensor on the brain’s surface, that would be a fascinating finding. “That’s what I would have liked to have seen,” he said. To his eye, it would make a clearer connection between fluid flow and norepinephrine than the lab’s work has shown thus far.</p>
<p>The critiques of Nedergaard’s work come on strong in part because this idea is currently the most prominent hypothesis of CSF flow in the brain. That may change if other researchers can introduce other ideas that can be tested. Another wrinkle is that not everyone means the same thing when they talk about the glymphatic system. “Some people use ‘glymphatics’ to mean ‘waste transport system of the brain.’ Other people use it to mean a really specific mechanistic model,” Lewis said. “It’s clear that the brain has and needs a waste clearance system. … It’s really interesting to explore what that is and how that works.”</p>
        
        
<p>Haugland, now a postdoc at the University of Oxford, is aware of the controversy about the glymphatic hypothesis. “There is critique of it. I’m also not sure that we understand it in the right way,” she said. “The more people who are actually working on finding out how it works, no matter what their hypothesis is — all that will help drive the field forward and give us more knowledge.</p>
<p>“The results are what they are. They show something about the biology,” she continued. “We are trying to ask a lot of questions and we’re not, maybe, all the time very good at it because we don’t know how it works — the big picture.”</p>
<p>“Nobody has the truth,” Proulx said, about what the brain is doing up there, in our skulls, to rid itself of its waste. “Some people think they know. But I think we don’t know.”</p>

</div>



<div>
<div>
<h2>WHAT ARE<br><mark>ACTION</mark><strong><mark> SLOTS</mark></strong>?</h2>



<p>Before Action Slots, each data-block specific animation—like an object’s position, a camera’s depth of field, or a material’s shader properties—needed its own separate Action. This made it difficult to animate multiple elements together or share animations between objects or even projects.</p>
</div>



<div>
<div>
<p>For example, if you wanted to animate a camera moving while also changing its depth of field, you’d need two separate Actions, which couldn’t be easily linked or reused.</p>



<p>Now you can mix all sorts of animations such as an object’s position, its material properties, even compositing effects—all within a single Action.</p>

<h2><strong>Pole</strong> Position</h2>



<p>A new option in the <strong>Select by Trait</strong> operator lets you select by pole count.</p>



<p>Easily find all 3-pole or 5-pole points in your mesh.</p>



<p>Given their impact on topology, the default selects all poles that do not have 4 edges, allowing for easy inspection.</p>

<p>Joining triangles to quads now prioritizes quad-dominant topology, creating a more structured “grid” layout. This helps maintain cleaner geometry and improves mesh flow, especially in models where uniform quads are preferred.</p>



<p>This behavior can be adjusted using a <strong>topology influence factor</strong>, to better control how triangles are merged.</p>

<h2>Vertex &amp; Edge <strong>Dissolve</strong></h2>

<h5>COMPOSITOR</h5>



<h2><strong>Speed</strong><br>for Everyone</h2>



<p>The CPU compositor was rewritten to pave the way for future development.</p>



<p>The rewrite provides significant improvements in performance in certain configurations of some nodes, caching of static resources like images, and less memory usage on node setups with many nodes that operate on pixels.</p>



<p>Filter nodes are particularly faster now:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/4.4/compositing/types/utilities/levels.html" data-type="link" data-id="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/4.4/compositing/types/utilities/levels.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Levels</a></strong> node is up to <strong>10x</strong> faster.</li>

<li><a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/4.4/compositing/types/filter/pixelate.html" data-type="link" data-id="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/4.4/compositing/types/filter/pixelate.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Pixelate</strong></a> node is <strong>9x</strong> faster.</li>
</ul>



<p>Adjusting compositor node trees can be significantly faster and more interactive. That’s because the compositor now <a href="https://projects.blender.org/blender/blender/commit/e53ac805af" data-type="link" data-id="https://projects.blender.org/blender/blender/commit/e53ac805af">avoids computing outputs</a> that aren’t viewed by the user through the backdrop or image editor.</p>



<p>The overall compositing experience should now feel more responsive, whether you’re using the CPU or GPU.</p>

<p>Back in 2017, <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2017/09/iphone_x_event_thoughts_and_observations">the iPhone X was announced alongside the iPhones 8 and 8 Plus</a> in mid-September. The iPhones 8 shipped that month, and I published <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2017/09/the_iphones_8">a review of the iPhones 8</a> on September 19. The iPhone X, though, <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2017/09/the-future-is-here-iphone-x/">wasn’t available to order until October 27</a>, and didn’t start shipping to customers until November 3. It was an unusual iPhone release cycle that year, to say the least. Initial reviews of the much-anticipated iPhone X appeared on October 31, but I’d only had the phone for 24 hours when the embargo dropped, so I published <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2017/10/iphone_x_review_roundup">some initial impressions then</a>, but wound up not publishing my <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2017/12/the_iphone_x">full review of the iPhone X</a> until December 26.</p>

<p>A few days later I wrote a follow-up regarding a specific new interaction design, “<a href="https://daringfireball.net/2017/12/side_button_to_confirm_payments_on_iphone_x">Pressing the Side Button to Confirm Payments on iPhone X</a>”, which I began thus:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Occasionally I notice a burst of traffic to Daring Fireball from
Hacker News. It’s always short-lived, because for reasons I’ve
never seen explained, Daring Fireball articles always get
blacklisted from Hacker News once they hit their front page. It’s
apparent that a lot of HN readers do not like my work on the basis
that they see me as a shameless Apple shill, but it’s a shame the
articles get deleted because I like reading the comments. I feel
like it keeps me on my toes to read the comments from people who
don’t like Daring Fireball.</p>

<p>Even after being blacklisted from the Hacker News homepage,
though, the comment threads still exist. I went through <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16014464">the
Hacker News comments on my iPhone X review</a> today, and a few
comments about how Apple Pay works on the iPhone X caught my
attention.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What I didn’t mention then was that DF’s buried status at HN was, at the time, a relatively new phenomenon. Hacker News <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2013/05/18/the-evolution-of-hacker-news/">started in early 2007</a> and for a yearslong stretch, Daring Fireball articles seemed more or less appropriately popular there. Articles that I would think would resonate with the HN readership would hit, and get what always seemed to me an appropriate number of comments. At some point in the mid-2010s though, it seemed like DF articles would get downvoted or flagged after hitting the HN front page. I’d been noticing this for some time when I wrote the above in December 2017.</p>

<p>But even in 2017, DF articles would get active comment threads on HN occasionally. The Hacker News thread I referenced above, <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16014464">regarding my iPhone X review</a>, garnered 107 comments. In the years after that, DF articles went from being mysteriously disappeared <em>after</em> hitting the HN front page (and gaining some comment traction) to pretty much <em>never</em> hitting the HN front page (and thus never gaining any comment traction). I found this curious, and I couldn’t figure out <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/newsfaq.html">why or how</a> this was happening — or who was doing it — but I didn’t mention it much.</p>

<p>Two years ago, <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2023/02/making_our_hearts_sing#fn1-2023-02-01">I did mention it again in a footnote</a>, in a piece about the inexplicably poor state of Android apps from a design perspective:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It sounds a bit conspiratorial, but <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2017/12/side_button_to_confirm_payments_on_iphone_x">for several years
now</a> it’s seemed clear to me that Hacker News has
Daring Fireball in some sort of graylist. It’s not blacklisted,
obviously, given the aforementioned <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34605535">two</a>
<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34611552">threads</a> about yesterday’s piece, but nothing I
write here ever gains any significant traction there. Ever. And
the reason there are two threads for yesterday’s piece is that the
first one disappeared from the home page soon after it was posted.
I think? In <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/from?site=daringfireball.net">this list of recent Hacker News threads for articles
from DF</a>, going back four months, only three have
more than 10 comments — and two of those are the threads from
yesterday. I don’t know who I pissed off there or why, but I’ve
never seen an explanation for this. <strong>UPDATE:</strong> <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34626587">HN commenter
Michiel de Mare has quantified the apparent
suppression</a>, based on the ranking of this very
article. Exactly what I’ve noticed for years.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You can see this yourself right now, with <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/from?site=daringfireball.net">the current list of recent DF articles submitted to Hacker News</a>. Most of them have 0, 1, or 2 comments. Some got up to 3. “<a href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/03/something_is_rotten_in_the_state_of_cupertino">Something Is Rotten in the State of Cupertino</a>” is the most read, most commented upon things I’ve written in a while. On Hacker News <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43348891">it got just 28 comments</a> before being shitlisted, which, I have to say, is just weird. That’s one piece I’d have thought would resonate with the HN audience, and make for good grist for discussion. Then, after the original thread was shitlisted, someone re-submitted it (perhaps confused that it wasn’t on the HN front page). That re-submission <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43355009">got 1 comment</a> before it too fell to the mysterious shitlist reaper.</p>

<p>The one recent exception is “<a href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/03/why_cant_we_screenshot_frames_from_drm-protected_video">Why Can’t We Screenshot Frames From DRM-Protected Video on Apple Devices?</a>”, which somehow <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43223985">escaped the shitlist and garnered 208 comments</a>. These occasional exceptions to DF’s general shitlisting at HN have always made the whole thing more mysterious to me. There’s clearly no programmatic blacklisting that keeps Daring Fireball articles from being submitted, or from gaining a few comments. But once any traction occurs, <em>something</em> happens and poof, they’re gone from the Hacker News front page. It certainly doesn’t make any sense to me why my off-hand post griping about our inability to screenshot DRM video frames would be an order of magnitude more popular than “Something Is Rotten in the State of Cupertino” was.</p>

<p>Today, though, I saw <a href="https://jasette.facil.services/@jerome/114229390677476922">a helpful mention on Mastodon</a> that pointed me to an interesting project. An author named Michael Lynch has written a tool to quantify “<a href="https://refactoringenglish.com/tools/hn-popularity/">the highest-ranking personal blogs of Hacker News</a>” since HN’s inception in 2007. According to Lynch’s all-time listing, Daring Fireball ranks #5, which I have to say surprised me, given its years of inexplicable (or at the very least, unexplained) shitlisting status. But Lynch’s tool lets you select date ranges. If you look at <a href="https://refactoringenglish.com/tools/hn-popularity/?start=2006-10-09&amp;end=2021-03-26&amp;limit=100">2007 through 2021</a>, Daring Fireball ranked #3, behind only <a href="https://paulgraham.com/">Paul Graham’s renowned eponymous blog</a> and Brian Krebs’s excellent (and also eponymous) <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/">Krebs on Security</a>. From <a href="https://refactoringenglish.com/tools/hn-popularity/?start=2006-10-09&amp;end=2013-03-26&amp;limit=100">2007 though 2013</a>, DF ranked #2, behind only Graham (who created Hacker News). But if you look at the last four years, from <a href="https://refactoringenglish.com/tools/hn-popularity/?start=2021-10-09&amp;end=2025-03-26&amp;limit=100">2021 through 2025</a>, Daring Fireball ranks #72.</p>

<p>Maybe I’ve lost my fastball, and I just don’t write so good no more. Or maybe it’s not me, but the Hacker News audience that has changed in recent years.<sup id="fnr1-2025-03-26"><a href="#fn1-2025-03-26">1</a></sup> But it seems to me <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34626587">there’s something fishy going on</a>. What bothers me isn’t so much that Daring Fireball is shitlisted at Hacker News — even though I really did enjoy reading the commentary on my posts back when they regularly surfaced there, and <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=jgruber">still do</a> when one slips through the cracks. What bothers me is that it’s unexplained. Which, ultimately, seems not so much censorial as just cowardly.</p>

<p dir="auto">Aren't you <em>müde</em> from writing Rust programs in English? Do you like saying
"scheiße" a lot? Would you like to try something different, in an exotic and
funny-sounding language? Would you want to bring some German touch to your

<p dir="auto"><strong>rost</strong> (German for <em>Rust</em>) is here to save your day, as it allows you to
write Rust programs in German, using German keywords, German function names,
German idioms.</p>

German Rust is fully compatible with English-Rust, so you can mix both at your

<h2>‘This isn’t public safety, it’s intimidation’</h2><p>Neighbors said they were rattled by the arrest, which happened at 5:30 p.m. on a residential block.</p><p>“It looked like a kidnapping,” said Michael Mathis, a 32-year-old software engineer whose surveillance camera captured the arrest. “They approach her and start grabbing her with their faces covered. They’re covering their faces. They’re in unmarked vehicles.”</p><p>Tufts University President Sunil Kumar said in a statement that the school learned that authorities detained an international graduate student and the student’s visa had been terminated.</p><p>“The university had no pre-knowledge of this incident and did not share any information with federal authorities prior to the event,” Kumar said. </p>

Ayanna Pressley called the arrest “a horrifying violation of Rumeysa’s constitutional rights to due process and free speech.”</p><p>“She must be immediately released,” Pressley said in a statement. “We won’t stand by while the Trump Administration continues to abduct students with legal status and attack our fundamental freedoms.”</p><p>Massachusetts Attorney General Andrea Joy Campbell called the video “disturbing.”</p><p>“Based on what we now know, it is alarming that the federal administration chose to ambush and detain her, apparently targeting a law-abiding individual because of her political views,” she said. “This isn’t public safety, it’s intimidation that will, and should, be closely scrutinized in court.”</p>
    
<h2>Court says not to remove Ozturk from the state, but she is listed as being held in Louisiana</h2><p>U.S. District Judge Indira Talwani issued an order giving the government until Friday to answer why Ozturk was being detained. Talwani also ordered that Ozturk not be moved outside the District of Massachusetts without 48 hours advance notice. </p><p>But as of Wednesday evening, the U.S. Immigration and Custom Enforcement’s online detainee locator system listed her as being held at the South Louisiana ICE Processing Center in Basile, Louisiana.</p><p>A senior DHS spokesperson confirmed Ozturk’s detention and the termination of her visa.</p><p>“DHS and (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) investigations found Ozturk engaged in activities in support of Hamas, a foreign terrorist organization that relishes the killing of Americans. A visa is a privilege, not a right. Glorifying and supporting terrorists who kill Americans is grounds for visa issuance to be terminated. This is common sense security,” the spokesperson told the AP.</p><h2>Ozturk cowrote article criticizing university response to Palestinian issues</h2><p>Ozturk was one of four students last March who wrote an op-ed in The Tufts Daily criticizing the university’s response to its community union Senate passing resolutions that demanded Tufts “acknowledge the Palestinian genocide,” disclose its investments and divest from companies with direct or indirect ties to Israel.</p><p>Friends said Ozturk was not otherwise closely involved in protests against Israel. But after the piece was published, her name, photo and work history were featured by Canary Mission, a website that says it documents people who “promote hatred of the U.S.A., Israel and Jews on North American college campuses.” The op-ed was the only cited example of “anti-Israel activism” by Ozturk. </p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div dir="auto"><p><em><span>I’ve been thinking a lot about autonomous vehicles as I prepare for next Wednesday’s </span><a href="https://www.rideai.org/" rel="">Ride AI Summit</a><span> in Los Angeles.</span></em></p><p><em>I’ll be moderating two panels. One features three companies—Waabi, Bot.auto, and Torc—that are working to automate long-haul trucking. The other features Nuro and Wayve, two of the leading companies developing next-generation driver asssistance systems for customer-owned cars.</em></p><p><em><span>We still have some tickets available, so if you are involved—or interested—in the AV industry, you’ll want to </span><a href="https://www.rideai.org/events/ride-ai" rel="">join us in Los Angeles</a><span>.</span></em></p><p>The first ever fatal crash involving a fully driverless vehicle occurred in San Francisco on January 19. The driverless vehicle belonged to Waymo, but the crash was not Waymo’s fault.</p><p><span>Here’s what happened: a Waymo with no driver or passengers stopped for a red light. Another car stopped behind the Waymo. Then, according to Waymo, </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCQqu_ZBzic" rel="">a human-driven SUV rear-ended the other vehicles</a><span> at high speed, causing a six-car pileup that killed one person and injured five others. Someone’s dog also died in the crash.</span></p><p>Another major Waymo crash occurred in October in San Francisco. Once again, a driverless Waymo was stopped for a red light. According to Waymo, a vehicle traveling in the opposite direction crossed the double yellow line and crashed into an SUV that was stopped to the Waymo’s left. The force of the impact shoved the SUV into the Waymo. One person was seriously injured.</p><p>These two incidents produced worse injuries than any other Waymo crash in the last nine months. But in other respects they were typical Waymo crashes. Most Waymo crashes involve a Waymo vehicle scrupulously following the rules while a human driver flouts them: speeding, running red lights, careening out of their lanes, and so forth.</p><p>Waymo’s service will only grow in the coming months and years. So Waymo will inevitably be involved in more crashes—including some crashes that cause serious injuries and even death.</p><p>But as this happens, it’s crucial to keep the denominator in mind. Since 2020, Waymo has reported roughly 60 crashes serious enough to trigger an airbag or cause an injury. But those crashes occurred over more than 50 million miles of driverless operations. If you randomly selected 50 million miles of human driving—that’s roughly 70 lifetimes behind the wheel—you would likely see far more serious crashes than Waymo has experienced to date.</p><p>Federal regulations require Waymo to report all significant crashes, whether or not the Waymo vehicle was at fault—indeed, whether or not the Waymo is even moving at the time of the crash. I’ve spent the last few days poring over Waymo’s crash reports from the last nine months. Let’s dig in.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fecf0cc65-34c8-475e-8397-8da0c388d838_4032x3024.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fecf0cc65-34c8-475e-8397-8da0c388d838_4032x3024.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fecf0cc65-34c8-475e-8397-8da0c388d838_4032x3024.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fecf0cc65-34c8-475e-8397-8da0c388d838_4032x3024.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fecf0cc65-34c8-475e-8397-8da0c388d838_4032x3024.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fecf0cc65-34c8-475e-8397-8da0c388d838_4032x3024.jpeg" width="1456" height="1092" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/ecf0cc65-34c8-475e-8397-8da0c388d838_4032x3024.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1092,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:6089362,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://www.understandingai.org/i/159863907?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fecf0cc65-34c8-475e-8397-8da0c388d838_4032x3024.jpeg&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fecf0cc65-34c8-475e-8397-8da0c388d838_4032x3024.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fecf0cc65-34c8-475e-8397-8da0c388d838_4032x3024.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fecf0cc65-34c8-475e-8397-8da0c388d838_4032x3024.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fecf0cc65-34c8-475e-8397-8da0c388d838_4032x3024.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption>A Waymo car in Los Angeles. (Photo by P_Wei via Getty)</figcaption></figure></div><p><span>Last September, I </span><a href="https://www.understandingai.org/p/human-drivers-are-to-blame-for-most" rel="">analyzed</a><span> Waymo crashes through June 2024. So this section will focus on crashes between July 2024 and February 2025. During that period, Waymo reported 38 crashes that were serious enough to either cause an (alleged) injury or an airbag deployment.</span></p><p>In my view only one of these crashes was clearly Waymo’s fault. Waymo may have been responsible for three other crashes—there wasn’t enough information to say for certain. The remaining 34 crashes seemed to be mostly or entirely the fault of others:</p><ul><li><p><span>The two serious crashes I mentioned at the start of this article are among </span><strong>16 crashes</strong><span> where another vehicle crashed into a stationary Waymo (or caused a multi-car pileup involving a stationary Waymo). This included ten rear-end crashes, three side-swipe crashes, and three crashes where a vehicle coming from the opposite direction crossed the center line.</span></p></li><li><p><span>Another </span><strong>eight crashes</strong><span> involved another car (or in one case a bicycle) rear-ending a moving Waymo.</span></p></li><li><p><span>A further </span><strong>five crashes</strong><span> involved another vehicle veering into a Waymo’s right of way. This included a car running a red light, a scooter running a red light, and a car running a stop sign.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Three crashes</strong><span> occurred while Waymo was dropping a passenger off. The passenger opened the door and hit a passing car or bicycle. Waymo has a </span><a href="https://waymo.com/blog/2023/05/keeping-riders-and-other-road-users/" rel="">“Safe Exit” program</a><span> to alert passengers and prevent this kind of crash, but it’s not foolproof.</span></p></li></ul><p>There were two incidents where it seems like no crash happened at all:</p><ul><li><p>In one incident, Waymo says that its vehicle “slowed and moved slightly to the left within its lane, preparing to change lanes due to a stopped truck ahead.” This apparently spooked an SUV driver in the next lane, who jerked the wheel to the left and ran into the opposite curb. Waymo says its vehicle never left its lane or made contact with the SUV.</p></li><li><p>In another incident, a pedestrian walked in front of a stopped Waymo. The Waymo began moving after the pedestrian had passed, but then the pedestrian “turned around and approached the Waymo AV.” According to Waymo, the pedestrian “may have made contact with the driver side of the Waymo AV” and “later claimed to have a minor injury.” Waymo’s report stops just short of calling this pedestrian a liar.</p></li></ul><p>So that’s a total of 34 crashes. I don’t want to make categorical statements about these crashes because in most cases I only have Waymo’s side of the story. But it doesn’t seem like Waymo was at fault in any of them.</p><p>There was one crash where Waymo clearly seemed to be at fault: in December, a Waymo in Los Angeles ran into a plastic crate, pushing it into the path of a scooter in the next lane. The scooterist hit the crate and fell down. Waymo doesn’t know whether the person riding the scooter was injured.</p><p>I had trouble judging the final three crashes, all of which involved another vehicle making an unprotected left turn across a Waymo’s lane of travel. In two of these cases, Waymo says its vehicle slammed on the brakes but couldn’t stop in time to avoid a crash. In the third case, the other vehicle hit the Waymo from the side. Waymo’s summaries make it sound like the other car was at fault in all three cases, but I don’t feel like I have enough information to make a definite judgment.</p><p>Even if we assume all three of these crashes were Waymo’s fault, that would still mean that a large majority of the 38 serious crashes were not Waymo’s fault. And as we’ll see, Waymo vehicles are involved in many fewer serious crashes than human-driven vehicles.</p><p><span>Another way to evaluate the safety of Waymo vehicles is by comparing their per-mile crash rate to human drivers. Waymo has been regularly publishing data about this over the last couple of years. Its most recent release came last week, when Waymo updated its </span><a href="https://waymo.com/safety/" rel="">safety data hub</a><span> to cover crashes through the end of 2024.</span></p><p>Waymo knows exactly how many times its vehicles have crashed. What’s tricky is figuring out the appropriate human baseline, since human drivers don’t necessarily report every crash. Waymo has tried to address this by estimating human crash rates in its two biggest markets—Phoenix and San Francisco. Waymo’s analysis focused on the 44 million miles Waymo had driven in these cities through December, ignoring its smaller operations in Los Angeles and Austin.</p><p><span>Using human crash data, Waymo estimated that human drivers on the same roads would get into 78 crashes serious enough to trigger an airbag. By comparison, Waymo’s driverless vehicles only got into 13 airbag crashes. That represents an </span><strong>83 percent reduction</strong><span> in airbag crashes relative to typical human drivers.</span></p><p><span>This is slightly worse than last September, when Waymo estimated an </span><strong>84 percent reduction</strong><span> in airbag crashes over Waymo’s first 21 million miles.</span></p><p><span>Over the same 44 million miles, Waymo estimates that human drivers would get into 190 crashes serious enough to cause an injury. Instead, Waymo only got in 36 injury-causing crashes across San Francisco or Phoenix. That’s an </span><strong>81 percent reduction</strong><span> in injury-causing crashes.</span></p><p><span>This is a significant improvement over last September, when Waymo estimated its cars had </span><strong>73 percent fewer</strong><span> injury-causing crashes over its first 21 million driverless miles.</span></p><p>The above analysis counts all crashes, whether or not Waymo’s technology was at fault. Things look even better for Waymo if we focus on crashes where Waymo was determined to be responsible for a crash.</p><p><span>To assess this, Waymo </span><a href="https://waymo.com/blog/2024/12/new-swiss-re-study-waymo" rel="">co-authored a study</a><span> in December with the insurance giant Swiss Re. It focused on crashes that led to successful insurance claims against Waymo. This data seems particularly credible because third parties, not Waymo, decide when a crash is serious enough to file an insurance claim. And claims adjusters, not Waymo, decide whether to hold Waymo responsible for a crash.</span></p><p>But one downside is that it takes a few months for insurance claims to be filed. So the December report focused on crashes that occurred through July 2024.</p><p>Waymo had completed 25 million driverless miles by July 2024. And by the end of November 2024, Waymo had faced only two potentially successful claims for bodily injury. Both claims are still pending, which means they could still be resolved in Waymo’s favor.</p><p><span>One of them was this crash that I described at the beginning of my </span><a href="https://www.understandingai.org/p/human-drivers-are-to-blame-for-most" rel="">September article</a><span> about Waymo’s safety record:</span></p><blockquote><p>On a Friday evening last November, police chased a silver sedan across the San Francisco Bay Bridge. The fleeing vehicle entered San Francisco and went careening through the city’s crowded streets. At the intersection of 11th and Folsom streets, it sideswiped the fronts of two other vehicles, veered onto a sidewalk, and hit two pedestrians.</p><p>According to a local news story, both pedestrians were taken to the hospital with one suffering major injuries. The driver of the silver sedan was injured, as was a passenger in one of the other vehicles. No one was injured in the third car, a driverless Waymo robotaxi.</p></blockquote><p>It seems unlikely that an insurance adjuster will ultimately hold Waymo responsible for these injuries.</p><p>The other pending injury claim doesn’t seem like a slam dunk either. In that case, another vehicle steered into a bike lane before crashing into a Waymo as it was making a left turn.</p><p>But let’s assume that both crashes are judged to be Waymo’s fault. That would still be a strong overall safety record.</p><p>Based on insurance industry records, Waymo and Swiss Re estimate that human drivers in San Francisco and Phoenix would generate about 26 successful bodily injury claims over 25 million miles of driving. So even if both of the pending claims against Waymo succeed, two injuries represent a more than 90 percent reduction in successful injury claims relative to typical human drivers.</p><p>The reduction in property damage claims is almost as dramatic. Waymo’s vehicles generated nine successful or pending property damage claims over its first 25 million miles. Waymo and Swiss Re estimate that human drivers in the same geographic areas would have generated 78 property damage claims. So Waymo generated 88 percent fewer property damage claims than typical human drivers.</p></div></article></div><div id="discussion"><h4>Discussion about this post</h4></div></div>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://edera.dev/stories/styrolite">https://edera.dev/stories/styrolite</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43486997">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2>Why build a new low-level container runtime?</h2><p>The idea of separating the low-level container runtime concerns into its own tool or microservice is not new. Outside of the Kubernetes CRI, which presents container lifecycle management as a pluggable microservice, there are simpler tools which provide a low-level container runtime as well, such as the unshare utility in util-linux, as well as another tool called Bubblewrap.</p><p>But these tools are either too high-level (like the Kubernetes CRI), or they are designed to be used via shell scripting: Bubblewrap has a high amount of configurability, but is only accessible via a very complicated CLI that is easy to get wrong, while util-linux’s unshare has basic functionality, but also locked behind a CLI. While CLIs allow for rapid iteration, we needed something different for Edera Protect: a rich programmatic interface for spawning and managing containers with precision. Styrolite provides the best of both worlds—a clean API directly usable from Rust, while preserving the rapid iteration capabilities of a CLI.</p><h2>How Styrolite Works: Linux Containers Under the Hood</h2><p>Importantly, we designed Styrolite with full awareness that Linux namespaces were never intended as hard security boundaries—a fact that explains why container escape vulnerabilities continue to emerge. Our approach acknowledges these limitations while providing a more robust foundation.</p><p>Containers in Linux – as opposed to <a href="https://docs.freebsd.org/en/books/handbook/jails/">other</a> <a href="https://illumos.org/man/7/zones">containerization</a> <a href="https://openvz.org/">efforts</a> <a href="http://linux-vserver.org/Welcome_to_Linux-VServer.org">elsewhere</a> – are built on <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/namespaces.7.html">Linux namespaces</a>. A namespace in Linux allows for an alternative view of a given type of resource, for example: the mount namespace allows for an alternative view of the mount table, and thus an alternative view of the root filesystem, while the PID namespace allows for an alternative view of the system process set. Container runtimes compose these namespaces to provide containerized environments, allowing for great flexibility at the cost of higher complexity.</p><p>At the root of all container runtimes is the <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/unshare.2.html">Linux unshare(2) syscall</a>.&nbsp; This allows for a currently running process to dissociate from one or more of its current namespaces into a forked version of the namespace that can be modified.&nbsp; In general, container runtimes unshare most namespaces by default because it is necessary to do:</p><ul role="list"><li>Mount namespaces are unshared from the host so that we can pivot into a modifiable copy of a container image as the container’s root filesystem.</li><li>PID namespaces are unshared from the host so that the containerized workload cannot view processes outside of the container.</li><li>IPC namespaces are unshared from the host so that the containerized workload cannot view or manipulate System V IPC resources unrelated to the containerized workload.</li><li>User namespaces are unshared from the host so that UIDs and GIDs inside the container are remapped to safer UIDs and GIDs in the host namespace.&nbsp; In other words, root inside a container when running in a user namespace is usually running as an unprivileged UID outside the container environment.</li><li>Time namespaces may be unshared from the host to modify the visible system uptime.</li><li>UTS namespaces may be unshared from the host to change the visible system hostname.</li><li>Network namespaces may be unshared from the host to force the containerized workload to use an alternate networking path.</li></ul><p>On the Edera Protect platform, all of these namespaces are unshared at different levels in the stack.&nbsp; Styrolite when used inside the Edera Protect platform is primarily responsible for dealing with the Mount, PID, IPC, User, Time and UTS namespaces, while networking is handled elsewhere in the platform.</p><h2>Simple, Programmatic Interface</h2><p>Here's a glimpse of how Styrolite simplifies container creation compared to traditional approaches:</p><pre contenteditable="false"><code><span>// Create a basic container with Styrolite</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>let</span><span> mut request = CreateRequestBuilder::</span><span>new</span><span>()
</span><span>    .with_rootfs(</span><span>"/path/to/container/rootfs"</span><span>)
</span>    .set_executable(“/bin/sh”)
    .set_arguments(vec![“-i”])
    .set_working_directory(“/”)
    .push_namespace(Namespace::User)
    .push_namespace(Namespace::Mount)
    .push_namespace(Namespace::Pid)
    .to_request();

<span></span><span>// Launch a process in the container</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>let</span><span> runner = Runner::</span><span>new</span><span>(“styrolite”);
</span>runner.run(request)?;</code></pre><p>This clean interface makes container creation and management more maintainable and less error-prone than complex CLI commands or shell scripts.</p><h2>Real-World Applications</h2><p>Styrolite powers several important use cases:</p><ul role="list"><li><strong>Secure microservices:</strong> Within Edera Protect, Styrolite enables fine-grained container isolation for security-critical workloads</li><li><strong>Application sandboxing</strong>: Our companion tool, styrojail, helps Linux users limit resource consumption and improve security for applications like web browsers that process untrusted input</li><li><strong>Custom CI/CD environments: </strong>Developers can use Styrolite to create isolated build environments with precise resource controls</li></ul><h2>Performance and Security</h2><p>Styrolite is designed with minimal overhead, providing container initialization times comparable to or faster than traditional CLI approaches while offering stronger programmatic guarantees about container state.</p><p>Our security-first design acknowledges the inherent limitations of Linux namespaces while providing a more robust foundation through careful defaults and explicit security controls.</p><h2>Join the Community</h2><p>When we decided to build a low-level containerization tool for our own use in Edera Protect, we immediately knew it would have other benefits to the greater OSS community. We welcome contributions from the community:</p><ul role="list"><li>Star and fork the project on <a href="https://github.com/edera-dev/styrolite">GitHub</a></li><li>Try out Styrojail for application sandboxing</li><li>Report issues or suggest improvements</li><li>Contribute code or documentation</li></ul><p>We're committed to Styrolite's continued development and look forward to seeing how the community builds with it!</p></div></div>]]></description>

<p><img alt="Oracle" height="900" src="https://www.bleepstatic.com/content/hl-images/2025/03/21/Oracle.jpg" width="1600"></p>

<p data-end="189" data-start="70">Despite Oracle&nbsp;denying a breach of its Oracle Cloud federated SSO login servers and the theft of account data for 6 million people, BleepingComputer has confirmed with multiple companies that associated data samples shared by the threat actor are valid.</p>

<p>Last week, a person named ‘rose87168’ claimed to have&nbsp;<a data-sk="tooltip_parent" data-stringify-link="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/oracle-denies-data-breach-after-hacker-claims-theft-of-6-million-data-records/" delay="150" href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/oracle-denies-data-breach-after-hacker-claims-theft-of-6-million-data-records/" navigationtraceid="TCJS5FY9E-to-Channel:UF436JBS4" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">breached Oracle Cloud servers</a>&nbsp;and began selling the alleged authentication data and encrypted passwords of 6 million users.&nbsp;The threat actor also said that stolen SSO and LDAP passwords could be decrypted using the info in the stolen files and offered to share some of the data with anyone who could help recover them.</p>

<p>The threat actor released multiple text files consisting of a database, LDAP data, and a list of 140,621 domains of companies that were allegedly impacted by the breach. It should be noted that some of the company domains look like tests, and there are multiple domains per company.</p>

<figure><img alt="Threat actor selling allegedly stolen Oracle Cloud data" height="500" src="https://www.bleepstatic.com/images/news/u/1109292/2025/Oracle%20Cloud%20data%20leak.jpg" width="1236"><figcaption><strong>Threat actor selling allegedly stolen Oracle Cloud data</strong><br><em>Source: BleepingComputer</em></figcaption></figure><p>In addition to the data, rose87168 shared an&nbsp;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250301161517/http:/login.us2.oraclecloud.com/oamfed/x.txt?x" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Archive.org URL</a> with BleepingComputer for a text file hosted on the "login.us2.oraclecloud.com" server that contained their email address. This file indicates that the threat actor could create files on Oracle's server, indicating an actual breach.</p>

<p>However, Oracle has denied that it suffered a breach of Oracle Cloud and has refused to respond to any further questions about the incident.</p>

<p>"There has been no breach of Oracle Cloud. The published credentials are not for the Oracle Cloud. No Oracle Cloud customers experienced a breach or lost any data," the company told BleepingComputer last Friday.</p>

<p>This denial, however, contradicts findings from BleepingComputer, which received additional samples of the leaked data from the threat actor and contacted the associated companies.</p>

<p>Representatives from these companies, all who agreed to confirm the data under the promise of anonymity, confirmed the authenticity of the information. The companies stated that the associated LDAP display names, email addresses, given names, and other identifying information were all correct and belonged to them.</p>

<p>The threat actor also shared emails with BleepingComputer, claiming to be part of an exchange between them and Oracle.</p>

<p>One email shows the threat actor contacting Oracle's security email (secalert_us@oracle.com) to report that they hacked the servers.</p>

<p>"I've dug into your cloud dashboard infrastructure and found a massive vulnerability that has handed me full access to info on 6 million users," reads the email seen by BleepingComputer.</p>

<p>Another email thread shared with BleepingComputer shows an exchange between the threat actor and someone using a ProtonMail email address who claims to be from Oracle. BleepingComputer has redacted the email address of this other person as we could not verify their identity or the veracity of the email thread.</p>

<p>In this email exchange, the threat actor says someone from Oracle using a @proton.me email address told them that "We received your emails. Let’s use this email for all communications from now on. Let me know when you get this."</p>

<p data-end="716" data-start="551">Cybersecurity firm Cloudsek has also <a href="https://www.cloudsek.com/blog/the-biggest-supply-chain-hack-of-2025-6m-records-for-sale-exfiltrated-from-oracle-cloud-affecting-over-140k-tenants" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">found</a> an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250217171149/https://login.us2.oraclecloud.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Archive.org URL</a> showing that the "login.us2.oraclecloud.com" server was running Oracle Fusion Middleware 11g as of February 17, 2025. Oracle&nbsp;has since taken this server offline after news of the alleged breach was reported.</p>

<p>This version of the software was impacted by a vulnerability&nbsp;tracked as <a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/cve-2021-35587" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">CVE-2021-35587</a> that allowed unauthenticated attackers to compromise Oracle Access Manager. The threat actor claimed that this vulnerability was used in the alleged breach of Oracle's servers.</p>

<p>BleepingComputer has emailed Oracle numerous times about this information but has not received any response.</p>

This is a long overdue post on <a href="https://labs.iximiuz.com/">iximiuz Labs</a>' internal kitchen.
It'll cover why I decided to build my own learning-by-doing platform for DevOps, SRE, and Platform engineers, how I designed it, what technology stack chose, and how various components of the platform were implemented.
It'll also touch on some of the trade-offs that I had to make along the way and highlight the most interesting parts of the platform's architecture.
In the end, I'll, of course, share my thoughts on what's next on the roadmap.
Sounds interesting? Then brace for a long read!</p>

</p>
 
<div><p>Level up your server-side game — join 9,000 engineers getting insightful learning materials straight to their inbox.</p></div>
 <h2 id="why-my-own-online-playgrounds">Why my own online playgrounds?</h2>
<p>Before I decided to go all-in with iximiuz Labs, I'd already been <del>blogging</del> producing technical educational content for a few years.
My primary means of expression were plain writing and (quite a lot of) drawing.
However, there was one more, often overlooked but important, part - <strong>providing reproducible instructions on how to repeat the experiments from my articles to help students gain their own hands-on experience</strong>.</p>
<p>Instead of just reading about a technology, I wanted the student to try it out, play with it, and see how it works first-hand.
This, in particular, required me to spend a non-trivial amount of time per article to come up with a set of steps to set up a lab environment...
But the harsh reality is that regardless of how big my effort was,
there would always be people lacking the right hardware, software, and/or skills to actually run these instructions.
So, I always felt that it could be done more efficiently.</p>
<p>A pretty common solution for this problem is to provide a web terminal connected to a pre-configured environment right on the article's page.
It definitely eliminates a great deal of the obstacles for the students.
They no longer need to install anything on their machines,
and it becomes possible to follow the instructions in the article without leaving the browser.</p>
<p><img src="https://iximiuz.com/iximiuz-labs-story/katacoda-like-ux-min.png" alt="Blog post with an integrated web terminal on the side."></p><p>However, <strong>my personal experience with platforms providing such UX was not very positive</strong>.
I've tried a few of them, with Katacoda being the most notable one, but I was not impressed.
In the examples I've come across, the main focus would usually be on the playground capabilities and not on the educational content.
Students would often be provided with <del>humdrum</del> text materials on the left, from where they would have to copy-paste commands into the terminal on the right making it not very different from a regular blog post accompanied by a cloud VM.</p>
<p>I wanted to do better! 🤪</p>
<p>If I were to enhance my articles with playgrounds (not an easy undertaking for me at all), I wanted them to be a true integral part of the learning experience, not just a sidekick on my blog.</p>
<p>For me, <strong>the ultimate goal of tech education is to prepare the student to solve problems in real production environments</strong>
where there is often no instructor to guide them through the process.
Thus, efficient playgrounds should be designed in a way that would allow the student to learn by doing on their own, not by simply following instructions.
However, if the gap between the student's current skills and the skills required to solve the problem is too big,
the student would likely get stuck and give up.
It meant that I had to come up with a hybrid approach allowing the student to learn the theory in a structured (by the content author) way and then giving them a chance to apply what they've just learned on practice in a less-guided production-like environment.</p>
<p>On my ideal learning-by-doing platform, <strong>students would be walked through the theoretical part of the content first</strong>,
where they can learn the concepts and get familiar with the tools and techniques required to solve the problem.
And then, <strong>they would be presented with a set of exercises to try out and better internalize their newly acquired skills</strong>.</p>
<p>You can think of the first, theoretical, part as my traditional deep-dive blog post, where the main focus is on the text and visuals, and the terminal on the side is just an addition (so, not very different from a proverbial KataCoda).
The second, practical, part though, is meant to be something that I haven't seen in the wild much -
think of <strong>LeetCode- or even CodinGame-styled exercises (with interactive solution checking, gamification elements, and whatnot) but for Docker, Kubernetes, and other typical tools and technologies used by DevOps, SRE, or Platform engineers</strong>.</p>


<p>Interesting that as a student, I would probably be more looking forward to the new capabilities the playgrounds give me during the practical phase of learning.
However, as a teacher, I'm excited about the new possibilities that the playgrounds unlock for both, practical and theoretical, parts of education.</p>
<p>For the content authors, the playgrounds in the theoretical part become a new means of expression - for instance,
<strong>the instructor can use the playground to animate the processes and concepts from the lesson</strong>.
Just look at this PoC of a visualizer that I've come up with to explain how Kubernetes works - it utilizes the playground to run a Kubernetes cluster and render its state changes on a web canvas as the student interacts with it, all in real-time:</p>


<p>All this combined, it sounded like it was worth giving a shot -
if I were to try, I wouldn't be building yet another KataCoda but rather a new type of educational platform that I haven't seen before and which I would enjoy using myself as a student and as a teacher.</p>
<h2 id="high-level-design-goals">High-level design goals</h2>
<p>The rant above was inexcusably long, but I hope it gives you a better idea of what I'm trying to achieve with the platform as well as justifies some of the design decisions that I'm going to describe below.</p>
<p>As usual with system design, there's (way) more than one way to skin a cat.
My main goal was to ship something that would be good enough to start with, given the very limited resources I had to dedicate to the project.
My guiding principles were (and still are):</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://matt-rickard.com/galls-law">Keep it simple</a> - no <del>Kubernetes</del> fancy tech, no large-scale cloud providers, no complex architecture.</li>
<li>Keep it reliable - no single point of failure and minimal probability of data loss.</li>
<li><a href="https://jvns.ca/blog/2023/05/25/new-playground--memory-spy/">Keep it secure</a> - limited attack surface and low incentives for the attackers.</li>
<li>Keep it cheap - the main cost factor (besides my time investment) should be the servers with playground VMs and not the management infrastructure.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=modXC5IWTJI">Keep it realistic</a> - the first version of the platform should scale to 100-200 active playgrounds without any major redesign, and it's fine to rewrite it from scratch if it ever needs to scale beyond that.</li>
<li><a href="https://iximiuz.com/en/posts/how-to-start-programming-in-go-for-devops/">Keep it productive</a> - use only programming languages and infra components that I'm already fluent in to avoid fighting multiple battles at once.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here is a high-level design of the platform that I came up with given the above constraints:</p>
<p><img src="https://iximiuz.com/iximiuz-labs-story/iximiuz-Labs-high-level-arch-min.png" alt="iximiuz Labs v1 architecture"></p><p>The high-level idea is that there is a (static) web application, a central component called <em>Foreman</em>, concerned with everything but the playgrounds, and a fleet of horizontally scalable bare-metal servers (workers) behind it, each running a number of microVMs.</p>
<h2 id="foreman-component">Foreman component</h2>
<p>The kitchen-sink Foreman component includes a frontend application, a backend service for it, and a number of background jobs for various bookkeeping tasks.
It's by no means the most elegant approach, but it's not uncommon to structure things this way either, and since there is just a single developer (me) working on the platform, there is absolutely no need to split it into microservices just yet.</p>
<p>The main responsibilities of Foreman are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Serve the (static) frontend JavaScript application, including the server-side rendering (SSR) of some pages for better SEO.</li>
<li>Implement authentication and authorization flows for end users (OAuth via GitHub at the moment).</li>
<li>Provide a simple REST API for the frontend app to start and stop courses, lessons, and freeform playgrounds.</li>
<li>Manage the fleet of workers and microVMs (pick the right worker server to start a new microVM on, monitor the health of the worker servers, update the status of the microVMs in the database, etc.).</li>
<li>Handle basic content management tasks (create, update, delete courses, lessons, playgrounds, etc).</li>
</ul>
<!-- TODO: Video: Editing a markdown lesson with automatic preview -->

<p>All Foreman's subsystems are stateless, and their operations are mostly idempotent.
Even when I deploy multiple instances of Foreman, they can all work with the same database without (m)any conflicts.</p>
<p>From the security perspective, Foreman is likely the most sensitive component of the platform.
Gaining access to it would allow the attacker to mess with the content and the users' data, and also start any number of playgrounds.
However, it's not as bad as it sounds.</p>
<p>Messing with the content is not nice, but the mitigation is simple - I can always wipe it out and restore it from the source (all content lives in a Git repo).
The user data is somewhat more concerning, but the only thing the platform collects at the moment is the user's GitHub profile ID (for authentication purposes), which is public information anyway,
and the rest of the data, like the status of microVMs or users' course progress, is not so valuable outside of the platform's context.
Starting an arbitrary number of playgrounds is not a big deal either - the platform is designed to run only allowed microVM images, and Foreman doesn't have control over what's allowed and what's not.
So the attacker would be able to start a bunch of microVMs, but so is any other (premium) user of the platform.</p>
<h2 id="fleet-of-workers">Fleet of workers</h2>
<p>This is where I had to be the most creative.
Unlike Foreman, which is a pretty typical piece of software, the workers are much more exotic
and required quite a bit of experimentation and prototyping to get right.</p>
<p>Each worker server is a bare-metal machine (because it needs to run Firecracker, and nested virtualization isn't fun) with a bunch of daemons controlling various aspects of the worker's and microVM's lifecycle.</p>
<p>The worker servers are meant to be horizontally scalable and independent from each other.
They are also, in a way, stateless - the only state they maintain is the state of the microVMs they are running at the moment.
While it may cause some temporary inconvenience for the users, if something goes wrong with the worker server (including the server being compromised), it can be simply wiped out and replaced with a new one without a ripple effect on the rest of the platform.</p>
<h3 id="bender-daemon">Bender daemon</h3>
<p>The key component on a worker server is a daemon called <em>Bender</em>. It's responsible for the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pulling the template microVM rootfs and kernel images.</li>
<li>Preparing student-customized Firecracker drive images.</li>
<li>Configuring system resources (networking, temporary users, etc.) for microVMs.</li>
<li>Launching microVMs (including maintaining a warm pool of configured but not yet started playgrounds).</li>
<li>Monitoring microVMs' health and terminating failed or expired ones.</li>
<li>Exposing a simple REST API for Foreman to start and stop microVMs.</li>
</ul>
<p>In other words, Bender to microVMs is what Docker or containerd is to containers - it's a single-host <del>container</del> microVM management daemon with a REST API.</p>
<p>Due to its nature, Bender is a highly privileged component (it runs as <em>root</em> directly on the host 🙈),
so my goal is to keep it as simple and focused as possible to minimize the attack surface.
Bender is also not exposed to end users directly (ideally, I'd not even expose it to the Internet, but currently, there is no LAN between Foreman and the workers due to my choice of the hosting providers).</p>
<p>Luckily, Bender is the only component that needs to run as <em>root</em> on the worker server.</p>
<h3 id="firecracker-microvms">Firecracker microVMs</h3>
<p>Every playground on iximiuz Labs consists of one or more microVMs.
The goal is to give the student shell access to an ephemeral Linux machine or a group of machines connected into a virtual network.</p>
<p>The multi-node nature of the playgrounds, plus various security and performance considerations, made me write quite a bit of custom code on top of Firecracker:</p>
<p><img src="https://iximiuz.com/iximiuz-labs-story/multi-node-playground-min.png" alt="Multi-node playground architecture."></p><p>The design of the playgrounds is highly influenced by <a href="https://github.com/weaveworks/ignite">Weave Ignite</a> and Kubernetes.</p>
<p>Weave Ignite taught me to run Firecracker microVMs in Docker containers - it helps a lot with network management and also simplifies the cleanup logic.
To configure networking for a microVM, one needs to create a tun/tap device on the host, attach it to the microVM,
and add a bunch of iptables rules to route the traffic to/from the microVM.
Alex Ellis has a great <a href="https://github.com/alexellis/firecracker-init-lab">GitHub project</a> demonstrating how to do that.
It's not too complicated, but when it needs to be done for tens of microVMs on a single host, and combined with the egress and side- traffic filtering, it becomes a bit of a pain
to manage.
However, most of the networking trickery, including the creation of tun/tap devices, can be done in an isolated network namespace of a Docker container.
And when the VM is terminated, the container is terminated as well, so the cleanup is automatic (well, Docker will do it for you).</p>
<p>And Kubernetes inspired me to take the idea of running Firecracker microVMs in containers even further.
In Kubernetes, <a href="https://iximiuz.com/en/posts/containers-vs-pods/">Pods are essentially groups of semi-fused containers that share some of their namespaces</a>, most notably the network namespace.
But it sounds pretty much what I needed for my multi-node playgrounds - a group of microVMs that can communicate with each other over a virtual network
can be represented as a group of containers that share the same network namespace.
And every such group gets its own Docker network (with a bunch of extra firewall rules) to isolate it from the other groups.</p>
<p>From the security standpoint, Firecracker microVMs are the most exposed part of the platform - I give Internet strangers direct shell access to them!
But they are also the most limited and isolated part of the system - each microVM gets an ephemeral non-privileged user assigned, then <a href="https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker/blob/83bde9c7dd791b96ec12406b5a012330d9e0833f/docs/jailer.md">jailed</a> and containerized on top of that.
Even breaking out of the VM would still require the attacker to gain root access to the host.
Nothing is impossible, but I personally don't know how to do that, and I'm doing my best to keep the system up-to-date with the latest security patches.</p>
<p>MicroVMs are resource- and rate-limited, and they are automatically terminated after a certain period of time.
The egress traffic from the <strong>free-tier microVMs</strong> is not just rate-limited but also restricted to DNS and HTTP(S) and only to an allow-listed set of hosts (this part was a bit tricky to implement, but thanks to my extensive experience with Envoy and Istio, I got it seemingly right after a few iterations).</p>
<h3 id="conductor-daemon">Conductor daemon</h3>
<p>As it was supposed to be clear from its name, the <em>Conductor</em> daemon is concerned with passing the commands from the student to the microVMs and back.
At the moment, it includes the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Terminal</em> session(s) - a bidirectional stream of bytes between the student's browser and the microVM's shell.</li>
<li><em>Tasks</em> - a set of commands to be executed on the microVM in accordance with the lesson's instructions.</li>
</ul>
<p>When a browser tab is about to make a new Conductor connection,
it <em>claims</em> a connection slot sending an authenticated request to Foreman.
Foreman then issues a unique short-lived token for the connection and registers it in the corresponding Conductor instance before returning the token to the browser.
Once the browser receives the token, it can establish a WebSocket connection directly to the Conductor instance on the worker server with the target microVM.</p>
<p>The web terminal in the browser is implemented using <a href="https://github.com/xtermjs/xterm.js">Xterm.js</a>, and Conductor uses a similar to <a href="https://github.com/yudai/gotty">yudai/gotty</a> approach to proxy a TTY-controlled shell session to the browser.
The shell session itself is a good old SSH connection over a Unix socket which is mounted into the microVM's container and then proxied by the <em>Firestarter</em> shim component to the microVM's tap interface.</p>
<p><img src="https://iximiuz.com/iximiuz-labs-story/conductor-daemon-role-min.png" alt="conductor daemon role in the system."></p><p>The <em>tasks</em> are also passed to the playground via a WebSocket connection to Conductor.
I'll touch on the tasks in more detail in the next section, but for now, it's enough to know that they are just a set of commands authored by the lesson's author
and executed on the microVM in a predefined order.
When a task changes its state (e.g., from <em>pending</em> to <em>running</em> or from <em>running</em> to <em>finished</em>), Conductor notifies the browser page about it via a WebSocket message.
This is how the student's progress is tracked and visualized in the browser.</p>
<h3 id="automatic-solution-checking-subsystem">Automatic solution-checking subsystem</h3>
<p>The automatic solution checking is one of the most interesting parts of iximiuz Labs.
Even more, it's likely the key differentiator at the moment.
The subsystem deserves a separate blog post, which I should definitely write one day, but for now, I'll just give you a high-level overview
and highlight the most interesting technical challenges I had to overcome.</p>
<p>The automatic solution-checking subsystem is based on the concept of <em>tasks</em>.
Tasks are low-level building blocks behind the content's interactive elements and the exercises in the practice sections.
The content author can define a set of commands, in a similar way GitHub Actions pipelines are written,
that will be sent to the playground microVMs upon starting the lesson (or the exercise).</p>
<p><img src="https://iximiuz.com/iximiuz-labs-story/tasks.jpeg" alt="Example of a task definition."></p><p>On the microVM side, the commands are organized in a directed acyclic graph (DAG) and then periodically executed by a special daemon called <em>Examiner</em>.
If the task's command terminates with a non-zero exit code or times out, it's (almost) immediately retried.
And when a command finally finishes successfully, the browser page gets notified about it via a WebSocket message passed through Conductor.</p>
<p>The original idea was to (re-)use the SSH sessions (from the web terminal implementation) to pass the commands from Conductor to Examiner daemons:</p>
<p><img src="https://iximiuz.com/iximiuz-labs-story/verification-engine.jpeg" alt="Automatic solution-checking subsystem."></p><p>However, the implementation turned out to be too complex and unreliable, especially when it came to timely reporting the task's state changes to the browser.
Surprisingly, the help came from the most unexpected place - gRPC!
gRPC is a perfect fit for the local communication between a daemon and its CLI client -
different projects, including containerd, use it for that purpose.
The <em>Examiner</em> daemon had already been using gRPC for the communication with its CLI client, <em>examinerctl</em>, meaning:</p>
<ul>
<li>Conductor could use the same gRPC client directly to pass the commands to the Examiner daemon instead of executing them via <em>examinerctl</em> over SSH.</li>
<li>gRPC streams could be used to notify Conductor, and transitively the browser, about the task's state changes in a timely and reliable manner.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://iximiuz.com/iximiuz-labs-story/examiner-examinerctl-grpc-min.png" alt="Using gRPC for local communication between a daemon and a CLI client."></p><h2 id="choosing-the-technology-stack">Choosing the technology stack</h2>
<p>It's not hard to notice that the above components are very diverse in their nature.
Thus, picking a single programming language or a framework for the whole platform was not an option.
However, since <a href="https://matt-rickard.com/minimal-viable-frameworks">the toolchain sprawl is a real problem</a>,
I tried to minimize the number of technologies involved as much as possible.</p>
<p><img width="45%" src="https://iximiuz.com/iximiuz-labs-story/iximiuz-labs-tech-stack.png" alt="iximiuz Labs tech stack: 34% Go, 27% Vue, 25% JavaScript, 10% misc shell scripts and Dockerfiles"></p><p>The need for developing a frontend app made the choice of JavaScript (or TypeScript) a no-brainer.
Hypothetically, I could have used Node.js for system daemons as well, but most of the projects in the Cloud Native space are written in Go,
and I didn't want to fight the ecosystem.
So, Go it was. But that's where I stopped.
Despite my warm feelings towards Python and Rust, I didn't want to introduce yet another language into the mix.
The tandem of Go and JavaScript is not my favorite, but it covers all the bases, and historically I've been pretty productive with it.</p>
<h3 id="frontend-app-and-api-layer">Frontend app and API layer</h3>
<p>Initially, I thought I'd use Vue.js for the frontend app (the only web framework I'm more or less fluent in)
and put an API server behind it written in Go.
However, I soon realized that I'd need to implement the server-side rendering (SSR) for SEO purposes -
after all, that's one of the main traffic sources for my blog at the moment.
So it made me try Nuxt 3, and rather unexpectedly, I liked it!
Nuxt 3 was just released out of beta,
still a bit rough around the edges, and with very limited documentation,
but nevertheless, I managed to bootstrap a simple app with SSR and a REST API in a matter of hours.
Six months later, I'm still using Nuxt 3, and I'm even happier with my choice now.</p>
<p>To avoid dealing a lot with the basic UI components, I bought the <a href="https://tailwindui.com/">Tailwind UI kit</a> and befriended it with <a href="https://daisyui.com/">daisyUI</a> -
the Frankenstein's monster I'm not proud of, but it worked!
Overall, I was pleasantly surprised by how much a hardcore backend engineer can achieve with the modern frontend stack these days:</p>
<blockquote data-lang="en" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>I've been solo-building a pet project for a few months, and I'm pleasantly surprised by how much a hardcore backend engineer can achieve with the modern frontend stack! 💪</p><p>A thread on tools and tricks that helped me to develop a Web UI for iximiuz Labs 🧵 <a href="https://t.co/nrpVLUVe1T">pic.twitter.com/nrpVLUVe1T</a></p></div>— Ivan Velichko (@iximiuz) <a href="https://twitter.com/iximiuz/status/1640380028952227843?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 27, 2023</a></blockquote> 

<p>The built-in API layer in Nuxt 3 turned out to be so handy, that I decided not to implement a separate API server in Go, at least for now.
But if there is no separate API server, why not to try putting the background jobs into the Nuxt app as well?
That's how the main business logic of the platform ended up being implemented in JavaScript 🙈</p>
<h3 id="backend-worker-servers-and-infra-glue">Backend worker servers and infra glue</h3>
<p>Two main daemons that live on the worker servers are written in Go.
One of them is launched as a systemd service, and the other one runs in a Docker container.
Both daemons expose HTTP APIs (via <a href="https://github.com/go-chi/chi">chi</a>),
and one of the daemons also has a built-in WebSocket server (via the archived <a href="https://github.com/gorilla/websocket">gorilla/websocket</a> package).</p>
<p>Docker is heavily (ab)used all over the platform:</p>
<ul>
<li>For development purposes - various dev tools are containerized.</li>
<li>As a means to package and deploy the daemons, microVM rootfs and kernel images, etc.</li>
<li>As a runtime for one of the daemons and surrounding infrastructure (Redis, Nginx, Envoy, etc.).</li>
<li>As a runtime for playgrounds - Firecracker microVMs are launched inside Docker containers.</li>
</ul>
<p>Interesting that playgrounds at the moment are also described in Dockerfiles, then built as Docker images, and stored in a private Docker registry.
When the playground management daemon needs to start a new playground, it pulls the image from the registry, extracts it into a directory, and creates a Firecracker drive image from its contents.</p>
<p>Other notable technologies used on worker servers are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Nginx - as a reverse-proxy in front of the backend daemons.</li>
<li>Envoy - as a transparent TCP egress proxy for the microVMs.</li>
<li>Redis - as a storage for daemons' state and as a message broker between them.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="hosting-and-data-storage-providers">Hosting and data storage providers</h3>
<p>I've considered quite a few options for hosting the platform, and it wasn't an easy choice. The goals were:</p>
<ul>
<li>Keep the costs as low as possible.</li>
<li>Avoid managing some pieces (e.g., frontend ingress, databases, etc.).</li>
<li>...but retain the ability to manage the others (e.g., the frontend app itself, the worker servers, etc).</li>
<li>Choose a geographically scalable solution (students' proximity to the VMs is important).</li>
</ul>
<p>For the frontend app, I honestly tried to stay open-minded and considered all the fancy serverless-ish and edge-y solutions - Vercel, Netlify, Firebase, to name a few.</p>
<p>However, I ended up using <del>good old cloud VMs</del> more traditional <a href="https://fly.io/docs/machines/">fly.io Machines</a>.
The amount of control over the frontend app Fly Machines give me is close to ideal - I can package in a container whatever (and however) I want and deploy it to a bunch of cheap VMs in a bunch of regions in a matter of seconds.
The ingress (including TLS termination and load balancing) and the automatic restarts on failure will be managed by fly.io.
The only thing that is not covered by fly.io yet is (more or less advanced) observability, but I'm hoping it'll be addressed soon.</p>
<p>For the storage layer, I tried to be open-minded again (considered Supabase, Fauna, Xata, Upstash...),
but in the end, I decided to go with the most boring option - MongoDB Atlas (with point-in-time backups).
I almost chose Fly's (semi-managed) Postgres offering, but at the time, the failback (after a failover) was not working as expected, and I didn't want to deal with it.
I should probably give it another try, though, because MongoDB is great for production but not so great for analytics and reporting (at least in my experience).</p>
<p>The choice for the worker servers was much easier - <a href="https://www.hetzner.com/sb">Hetzner Auction</a> is the cheapest bare-metal hosting I've ever known (I currently pay ~$40/mo for a server with 128GB RAM and 6 cores), on which I can fit tens of concurrent playgrounds. And if I ever need to expand to other regions, I'll likely try finding a similar hosting provider in the Americas and/or Asia.</p>
<p>The total monthly infra bill is currently around $100, where 80-90% of it is the cost of the worker servers.</p>
<h2 id="whats-next-on-the-roadmap">What's next on the roadmap?</h2>
<p>Content, of course!
I've already finished the first module (with two solid lessons) of my <a href="https://labs.iximiuz.com/courses/containerd-cli">course on containerd</a>,
but after blogging about containers for almost five years, I've accumulated soooo many content ideas... Now I finally have a platform to implement them on!</p>
<p>On the feature side, things that I'm planning to add next are:</p>
<ul>
<li>IDE integration (<a href="https://github.com/eclipse-theia/theia">Eclipse Theia</a> or the like) - apparently, not everyone is a Vim fan 🤷‍♂️</li>
<li>Multi-node playgrounds - the engine is already there, but the UI needs to catch up 👷‍♂️</li>
<li>Kubernetes visualizer from the video at the beginning of the article ❤️‍🔥</li>
</ul>
<p>One of the dream goals is to open-source Bender and the Firecracker rootfs generation tooling.
However, before I can find a sustainable way to fund the work on the platform, I'm not sure if I can afford to spend time on it.</p>
<p>Of course, the users should have control over the roadmap too, not just me.
And speaking of the users, I'm staying open-minded - initially, I built the platform for myself (as an author) and for the readers of my blog (as students),
but I can see it being used by other educators and/or the students themselves to create and share their own labs.
Companies can use it to train their employees or conduct automated job interviews - something similar to HackerRank but for DevOps topics.
And universities can potentially use it to teach CS students.
The possibilities are endless (tm) 🚀</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <article role="article">
  
  
  <div><p><span>This week, the genetic testing company </span><a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/03/24/nx-s1-5338622/23andme-bankruptcy-genetic-data-privacy"><span>23andMe filed for bankruptcy</span></a><span>, which means the genetic data the company collected on millions of users is now up for sale. If you do not want your data included in any potential sale, it’s a good time to ask the company to delete it. <br></span></p>
<p><span>When the company first announced it was considering a sale, </span><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2024/10/sale-23andmes-data-would-be-bad-privacy-heres-what-customers-can-do"><span>we highlighted many of the potential issues</span></a><span>, including selling that data to companies with poor security practices or direct links to law enforcement. With this bankruptcy, the concerns we expressed last year remain the same. It is unclear what will happen with your genetic data if 23andMe finds a buyer, and that uncertainty is a clear indication that you should consider deleting your data. </span><a href="https://oag.ca.gov/news/press-releases/attorney-general-bonta-urgently-issues-consumer-alert-23andme-customers"><span>California attorney general Rob Bonta agrees</span></a><span>.</span></p>
<h3><span>First: Download Your Data</span></h3>
<p><span><img src="https://www.eff.org/files/2025/03/26/picture1.png" width="936" height="568" alt="screenshot of 23andme data delete page" title="screenshot of 23andme data delete page"></span></p>
<p><span>Before you delete your account, you may want to download the data for your own uses. If you do so, be sure to store it securely. To download you data:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Log into your 23andMe account and click your username, then click "Settings."&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span>Scroll down to the bottom where it says "23andMe Data" and click "View."</span></li>
<li><span>Here, you'll find the option to download various parts of your 23andMe data. The most important ones to consider are:</span></li>
<ol>
<li><span>The "Reports Summary" includes details like the "Wellness Reports," "Ancestry Reports," and "Traits Reports."</span></li>
<li><span>The "Ancestry Composition Raw Data" the company's interpretation of your raw genetic data.</span></li>
<li><span>If you were using the DNA Relatives feature, the "Family Tree Data" includes all the information about your relatives. Based on the descriptions of the data we've seen, this sounds like the data the bad actors collected.</span></li>
<li><span>You can also download the "Raw data," which is the uninterpreted version of your DNA.&nbsp;</span></li>
</ol>
</ol>
<p><span>There are other types of data you can download on this page, though much of it will not be of use to you without special software. But there's no harm in downloading it all.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><span>How to Delete Your Data</span></h3>
<p><span><img src="https://www.eff.org/files/2025/03/26/picture2.png" width="936" height="604" alt="screenshot of 23andme data delete page" title="screenshot of 23andme data delete page"></span></p>
<p><span>Finally, you can delete your data and revoke consent for research. While it doesn’t make this clear on the deletion page, this </span><a href="https://customercare.23andme.com/hc/en-us/articles/212170688-Requesting-23andMe-Account-Closure"><span>also authorizes the company</span></a><span> to destroy your DNA sample, if you hadn't already asked them to do so. You can also make this request more explicit if you want in the </span><a href="https://customercare.23andme.com/hc/en-us/articles/202907570-Preferences-Notifications-Consent-Report-Configuration"><span>Account preferences section</span></a><span> page.</span></p>
<p><span>If you're still on the page to download your data from the steps above, you can skip to step three. Otherwise:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Click your username, then click "Settings."&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span>Scroll down to the bottom where it says "23andMe Data" and click "View."</span></li>
<li><span>Scroll down to the bottom of this page, and click "Permanently Delete Data."</span></li>
<li><span>You should get a message stating that 23andMe received the request but you need to confirm by clicking a link sent to your email.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span>Head to your email account associated with your 23andMe account to find the email titled "23andMe Delete Account Request." Click the "Permanently Delete All Records" button at the bottom of the email, and you will be taken to a page that will say "Your data is being deleted" (You may need to log in again, if you logged out).</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span>23andMe should give every user a real choice to say “no” to a data transfer in this bankruptcy and ensure that any buyer makes real privacy commitments. Other consumer genetic genealogy companies should proactively take these steps as well. Our DNA contains our entire genetic makeup. It can reveal where our ancestors came from, who we are related to, our physical characteristics, and whether we are likely to get genetically determined diseases. Even if you don’t add your own DNA to a private database, a relative could make that choice for you by adding their own. <br></span></p>
<p><span>This incident is an example of why this matters, and how certain features that may seem useful in the moment can be weaponized in novel ways. A bankruptcy should not result in our data getting shuffled off to the highest bidder without our input or a guarantee of&nbsp; real protections.</span></p>

          <p>Google is planning a major change to the way it develops new versions of the Android operating system. Since <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2008/10/google-liberates-android-source-code-so-start-developing/">the beginning</a>, large swaths of the software have been developed in public-facing channels, but that will no longer be the case. This does not mean Android is shedding its open source roots, but the process won't be as transparent.</p>
<p>Google <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-android-development-aosp-3538503/">has confirmed</a> to Android Authority that all Android development work going forward will take place in Google's internal branch. This is a shift from the way Google has worked on Android in the past, which featured frequent updates to the public AOSP branch. Anyone can access AOSP, but the internal branches are only available to Google and companies with a Google Mobile Services (GMS) license, like Samsung, Motorola, and others.</p>
<p>According to the company, it is making this change to simplify things, building on a recent change to trunk-based development. As Google works on both public and private branches of Android, the two fall out of sync with respect to features and API support. This forces Google to tediously merge the branches for every release. By focusing on the internal branch, Google claims it can streamline releases and make life easier for everyone.</p>
<p>When new versions of Android are done, Google says it will continue to publish the source code in AOSP as always. Supposedly, this will allow developers to focus on supporting their apps without keeping track of pending changes to the platform in AOSP. Licensed OEMs, meanwhile, can just focus on the lively internal branch as they work on devices that can take a year or more to launch.</p>

<p dir="auto">A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that provides browser automation capabilities using <a href="https://playwright.dev/" rel="nofollow">Playwright</a>. This server enables LLMs to interact with web pages through structured accessibility snapshots, bypassing the need for screenshots or visually-tuned models.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://onemileatatime.com/news/airline-demand-canada-united-states-collapses/">https://onemileatatime.com/news/airline-demand-canada-united-states-collapses/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43485649">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
			
<p>Recently, I wrote about how <a href="https://onemileatatime.com/insights/united-states-tourism-decline-trump/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">we’re seeing a general softening of demand</a> for travel to the United States, for a variety of reasons. There’s no denying that the most contentious situation is between Canada and the United States, and we now have some data that shows just how extreme the change in demand is.</p>



<div id="ez-toc-container">

<nav><ul><li><a href="#transborder_flight_bookings_are_down_by_70" title="Transborder flight bookings are down by 70%+">Transborder flight bookings are down by 70%+</a></li><li><a href="#when_will_airlines_slash_more_transborder_capacity" title="When will airlines slash more transborder capacity?">When will airlines slash more transborder capacity?</a></li><li><a href="#bottom_line" title="Bottom line">Bottom line</a></li></ul></nav></div>
<h2 id="h-transborder-flight-bookings-are-down-by-70"><span id="transborder_flight_bookings_are_down_by_70"></span>Transborder flight bookings are down by 70%+<span></span></h2>



<p>We’ve known that travel demand between Canada and the United States has been decreasing, both by air and by roads. We’ve seen some airlines scale back their flight schedules between the two countries, and we’ve also seen a substantial decline in road border crossings. However, it looks like what we’ve seen so far is just the tip of the iceberg.</p>



<p>Aviation analytics company <a href="https://www.oag.com/blog/canada-us-airline-capacity-aviation-market" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">OAG has published some data</a> on the decline in flight bookings between the countries, and it’s worse than most people probably imagined. Specifically, the company compared summer season bookings in March 2024 vs. March 2025. In other words, at this point in both years, how many people have booked transborder flights in April through September?</p>



<p>Well, I hope you’re sitting down. For that six month period, the number of tickets booked is down anywhere from 71.4% to 75.7%. Just as an example, April is less than a week away, and here’s how bookings between the two countries are looking:</p>



<ul>
<li>In March 2024, 1,218,570 tickets had been booked for April 2024</li>



<li>In March 2025, 295,982 tickets have been booked for April 2025</li>



<li>That represents a 75.7% reduction in tickets booked</li>
</ul>



<p>I knew it was bad, but I didn’t expect it would be that bad, as that level of demand shift is something you almost never see.</p><!-- /1019006/OMAAT_InContent -->





<p>Everyone can draw their own conclusions as to what’s causing this. It’s also anyone’s guess if we’re at rock bottom in terms of consumer sentiment, and if we’ll see more close-in bookings than in past years. But either way, April is right around the corner, and those drops are massive.</p>

<h2 id="h-when-will-airlines-slash-more-transborder-capacity"><span id="when_will_airlines_slash_more_transborder_capacity"></span>When will airlines slash more transborder capacity?<span></span></h2>



<p>We’ve seen airlines cancel a bit of capacity between the United States and Canada, but nothing that nearly reflects the decline in future bookings that we’re seeing. According to OAG, so far airlines have slashed anywhere from 1.6% to 3.5% of their schedules between the two countries for April through September.</p>



<p>However, based on current data, that doesn’t even begin to cover the adjustments that will need to be made, unless something drastic happens soon. Obviously one would assume that Air Canada would be most impacted by these changes, given that the airline has the largest transborder network. Perhaps we’ll see Air Canada shift more capacity domestically, or to countries other than the United States, to account for where consumers want to travel to.</p>



<p>This can’t be an easy situation for those in airline route planning, since it’s hard to know for how long demand will remain so depressed. It’s not easy to just totally rework your route network, especially when it’s anyone’s guess how this evolves.</p>

<h2 id="h-bottom-line"><span id="bottom_line"></span>Bottom line<span></span></h2>



<p>We’ve known that there has been a decline in travel between Canada and the United States. However, the situation for future flight bookings looks much worse, with an over 70% reduction in flight bookings for the summer season. So far airlines have slashed at most 3.5% of their schedules, so presumably some significant changes will still have to be made.</p>



<p><strong>What do you make of these statistics on future transborder flight bookings? Are you surprised by the size of the decline?</strong></p>

<p>The <a href="https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction">Model context protocol</a> (aka MCP) is a way to provide tools and context to the LLM. From the MCP docs:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>MCP is an open protocol that standardizes how applications provide context to LLMs. Think of MCP like a USB-C port for AI applications. Just as USB-C provides a standardized way to connect your devices to various peripherals and accessories, MCP provides a standardized way to connect AI models to different data sources and tools.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Agents SDK has support for MCP. This enables you to use a wide range of MCP servers to provide tools to your Agents.</p>
<h2 id="mcp-servers">MCP servers</h2>
<p>Currently, the MCP spec defines two kinds of servers, based on the transport mechanism they use:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>stdio</strong> servers run as a subprocess of your application. You can think of them as running "locally".</li>
<li><strong>HTTP over SSE</strong> servers run remotely. You connect to them via a URL.</li>
</ol>
<p>You can use the <a title="MCPServerStdio" href="https://openai.github.io/openai-agents-python/ref/mcp/server/#agents.mcp.server.MCPServerStdio"><code>MCPServerStdio</code></a> and <a title="MCPServerSse" href="https://openai.github.io/openai-agents-python/ref/mcp/server/#agents.mcp.server.MCPServerSse"><code>MCPServerSse</code></a> classes to connect to these servers.</p>
<p>For example, this is how you'd use the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem">official MCP filesystem server</a>.</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span id="__span-0-1"><a id="__codelineno-0-1" name="__codelineno-0-1" href="#__codelineno-0-1"></a><span>async</span> <span>with</span> <span>MCPServerStdio</span><span>(</span>

</span></code></pre></div>
<h2 id="using-mcp-servers">Using MCP servers</h2>
<p>MCP servers can be added to Agents. The Agents SDK will call <code>list_tools()</code> on the MCP servers each time the Agent is run. This makes the LLM aware of the MCP server's tools. When the LLM calls a tool from an MCP server, the SDK calls <code>call_tool()</code> on that server.</p>

<h2 id="caching">Caching</h2>
<p>Every time an Agent runs, it calls <code>list_tools()</code> on the MCP server. This can be a latency hit, especially if the server is a remote server. To automatically cache the list of tools, you can pass <code>cache_tools_list=True</code> to both <a title="MCPServerStdio" href="https://openai.github.io/openai-agents-python/ref/mcp/server/#agents.mcp.server.MCPServerStdio"><code>MCPServerStdio</code></a> and <a title="MCPServerSse" href="https://openai.github.io/openai-agents-python/ref/mcp/server/#agents.mcp.server.MCPServerSse"><code>MCPServerSse</code></a>. You should only do this if you're certain the tool list will not change.</p>
<p>If you want to invalidate the cache, you can call <code>invalidate_tools_cache()</code> on the servers.</p>

<p>For years now, Android has been developed in a way that allowed the public to look in on Google’s work, but that’s now changing as Google has just confirmed that it will start to develop the operating system entirely in its internal branch.</p>



<p>The Android Open Source Project (AOSP) has left most of Google’s work in developing Android as an operating system visible to the public eye. But, starting next week, Google is moving that work behind closed doors.</p>



<p>Google confirmed to <em><a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-android-development-aosp-3538503/">Android Authority</a></em> that “all Android development will occur within Google’s internal branches,” the publication says. This is a shift from how Android has been developed for a very long time, but also aligns with more recent moves Google has been making. For a while now, Google has been developing most parts of Android behind closed doors in its “internal branches,” with the “AOSP branch” only having certain other aspects of Android’s framework (including Bluetooth, kernel, and some other core components). As such, it’s been quite a while since the current state of AOSP is at the same level as Google’s internal builds, leaving developers and others to wait on Google to make a public release to get <em>all </em>of the new changes.</p>



<p>With this change to move everything to its internal, private development branch, Google isn’t changing the speed at which these new builds arrive. Rather, this will potentially streamline the process and prevent conflicts when merging the branches.</p>	
	



<p>This does not mean that Google is making Android a closed-source platform, but rather that the open-source aspect will only be released when a new branch is released to AOSP with those changes, including when new full versions or maintenance releases are finished.</p>



<p>In the end, users of Android almost certainly won’t see any changes from this new structure. App developers will also likely be unaffected. The biggest impact may be on the tidbits caught from AOSP that make their way into the public eye, such as the <a href="https://9to5google.com/2025/03/21/google-pixel-10-aosp-android-boot-time-improvement/">recent appearance of “Pixel 10” in an AOSP commit.</a> That may be for the best, as those small tidbits can often be misconstrued or overhyped, leading to confusion later on.</p>



<p>A formal announcement of this change is apparently coming “later this week,” with the change itself happening next week. We’ll update this post when Google makes further details available.</p>

And, while there has been <a href="https://www.reversinglabs.com/blog/the-changing-face-of-open-source-security" rel="noopener">some decline in malware numbers between 2023 and 2024</a>, this year's numbers don’t seem to continue that downward trend. Still, while RL has detected some interesting npm malware so far this year, none of it warranted a detailed writeup.</p><p>Then March rolled around, and two very interesting packages were published on npm: <a href="https://secure.software/npm/packages/ethers-provider2" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>ethers-provider2</span></a> and <a href="https://secure.software/npm/packages/ethers-providerz" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>ethers-providerz</span></a>. These were simple downloaders whose malicious payload was cleverly hidden, with a second stage that “patches” the legitimate npm package <a href="https://secure.software/npm/packages/ethers" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>ethers</span></a>, installed locally, with a new file containing the malicious payload. That patched file ultimately serves a reverse shell.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>This approach reveals a high level of sophistication on the threat actor’s part that deserves some further analysis and exploration.&nbsp;</p></div>

<h2><em>ethers-provider2</em> delivers the malware</h2>
<div><p>The package <em>ethers-provider2 </em>was still available on npm at the time of publication. The package mirrors another, legitimate and widely-used npm package, <em>ssh2</em>, which has more than 350 million downloads and more than 1,600 dependent applications. The <em>ethers-provider2</em> package contains the <em>ssh2</em> source code, adding some malicious elements to it. So the whole package functions exactly how the <em>ssh2</em> package would — with something extra.</p><p>The package was easily detected by RL's Spectra platform, with telltale signs it contained malicious code. First, the file <em>install.js </em>had been modified to include a malicious payload downloading second stage malware from the domain <em>hxxp[:]//5[.]199[.]166[.]1[:]31337/install</em>. Upon installation, the install script install.js is executed and a second stage is downloaded to a temporary file and then executed. Immediately after that, the temporary file is deleted, removing any indication that anything happened, which was another sign the package is malicious, since this usually doesn’t happen in legitimate packages.&nbsp;</p><p>As we looked at the second stage malware, things got really interesting. The malware goes into an infinite loop that checks if the legitimate npm package <em>ethers</em> is installed locally. If it is installed, or once it is installed, the second-stage malware springs into action: replacing one of its files, <em>provider-jsonrpc.js</em>, with a file that looks- and functions the same, but includes additional, malicious code that downloads the third-stage malware from <em>hxxp[:]//5[.]199[.]166[.]1[:]31337/config</em> and executes it.</p></div>

<p>Figure 1: ethers-provider2’s second stage</p>
<div><p>The second-stage malware also creates a file, <em>loader.js</em>, which writes code with the same functionality as the malicious code used to “patch” the ethers’ file, and then runs it.</p><p>The third stage serves a reverse shell connecting to the threat actor’s server, which is accessed using an ssh client from <em>ethers-provider2</em>. This client functions in the same way as a client from a legitimate <em>ssh2 </em>package would, but it is modified to receive additional messages. That means that the connection opened with this client turns into a reverse shell once it receives a custom message from the server. This is true even if the <em>ethers-provider2</em> package is removed from a compromised system: the client will still be used under certain circumstances, providing a degree of persistence for the attackers.&nbsp;</p></div>

<p>Figure 2: Reverse shell opened towards threat actors’ server</p>
<h2>Discussion</h2>
<div><p>While not as common as infostealers on the npm platform, downloaders are far from uncommon and are frequently encountered. However, this downloader is notable because of the exceptional strategies employed by the attackers to hide the malicious payload it delivered. These evasive techniques were more thorough and effective than we have observed in npm-based downloaders before.&nbsp;</p><p>Specifically, once the malicious payload, <em>ethers-provider2</em>, was delivered, its removal wouldn’t necessarily remove its malicious functionality. Instead, it would remain hidden in another location. And if the package <em>ethers-provider2</em> was present when the ethers package was removed and installed again, it would patch it again in the same way described previously.&nbsp;</p><p>It is also important to mention once again that the malicious code was only put inside the locally installed npm package <a href="https://secure.software/npm/packages/ethers" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>ethers</em></a>, and that the official npm package ethers was not compromised in any way.&nbsp;</p></div>
<h2>I am (not) throwin’ away my shot</h2>
<div><p>The other package belonging to the same campaign, <em>ethers-providerz </em>had only three versions, and the last two were very similar to <em>ethers-provider2</em>; whereas the first one <em>1.16.0</em> looked more like a test version, with some parts that didn't work as the threat actor probably intended.</p><p>The malicious payload was located in the install script <em>install.js</em>. It tries to “patch” several files of a legitimate locally installed npm package <em>@ethersproject/providers</em> in the same way <em>ethers’ </em>file <em>provider-jsonrpc.js </em>was patched.&nbsp;</p></div>
<p>Which npm package was targeted for patching is speculative at this point, because the path to each file was written incorrectly, with the threat actor defining the scope, but not providing the name of the intended package.</p>
<a href="https://blog.reversinglabs.com/hubfs/Blog/Malicious-npm-patch-figure_3.png"><img src="https://www.reversinglabs.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blog/Malicious-npm-patch-figure_3.png?width=1400&amp;name=Malicious-npm-patch-figure_3.png" alt="ReversingLabs" width="1400" srcset="https://www.reversinglabs.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blog/Malicious-npm-patch-figure_3.png?width=700&amp;name=Malicious-npm-patch-figure_3.png 700w, https://www.reversinglabs.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blog/Malicious-npm-patch-figure_3.png?width=1400&amp;name=Malicious-npm-patch-figure_3.png 1400w, https://www.reversinglabs.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blog/Malicious-npm-patch-figure_3.png?width=2100&amp;name=Malicious-npm-patch-figure_3.png 2100w, https://www.reversinglabs.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blog/Malicious-npm-patch-figure_3.png?width=2800&amp;name=Malicious-npm-patch-figure_3.png 2800w, https://www.reversinglabs.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blog/Malicious-npm-patch-figure_3.png?width=3500&amp;name=Malicious-npm-patch-figure_3.png 3500w, https://www.reversinglabs.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blog/Malicious-npm-patch-figure_3.png?width=4200&amp;name=Malicious-npm-patch-figure_3.png 4200w" sizes="(max-width: 1400px) 100vw, 1400px"></a>
<p>Figure 3: Malicious payload inside install.js script</p>
<div><p>The RL research team also observed the malicious payload creating a malicious file, <em>loader.js</em>, in the folder <em>node_modules</em>, and executing it. The <em>node_modules</em> folder is where npm packages are stored by default once they are installed. The file <em>loader.js</em> downloads the second stage from <em>hxxp[:]//5[.]199[.]166[.]1[:]31337/config</em>.</p><p>What's interesting about this is that there is a legitimate npm package called <a href="https://secure.software/npm/packages/loader.js" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>loader.js</em></a> with more than 24 million downloads and 5,200 dependent applications.This suggests that, as with <span>ssh2</span>, &nbsp;the threat actor was looking to “patch” a common, legitimate, and locally-installed npm package with a nearly identical version containing malicious code.</p></div>
<h2>RL YARA rule helps detect <em>ethers</em></h2>
<div><p>Detection of the malicious packages <em>ethers-provider2</em> and <em>ethers-providerz</em> was the easy part. They had very low download counts and contained non-obfuscated malicious code downloading the second stage inside the install script. RL’s Spectra platform finds obfuscated or non-obfuscated — and clearly malicious code — lurking in install scripts by identifying behaviors and characteristics when scanning both open- source and commercial, closed-source binaries. &nbsp;</p><p>Despite the low download numbers, these packages are powerful and malicious. If their mission is successful, they will corrupt the locally installed package ethers and maintain persistence on compromised systems even if that package is removed.</p><p>As of the time of publication, the package <em>ethers-providerz</em> was removed from npm, probably by the package's author because it has no security holding package. Package <em>ethers-provider2</em> is still on npm, but has been reported to the npm maintainers. </p><p>To address the risks posed by these packages, RL developed a simple YARA rule to help in detecting whether locally installed package <em>ethers</em> was “patched” or not.</p></div>

<h2>Even more packages?</h2>
<p>After this research was done, new packages were found that appear to be connected to this campaign: <em>reproduction-hardhat</em> and <em>@theoretical123/providers</em>. The former was a simple reverse shell that would connect to the IP address <em>5[.]199[.]166[.]1</em>, and the latter was a package downloading a second stage from <em>hxxp[:]//5[.]199[.]166[.]1[:]31337/config</em> and impersonating a legitimate npm package <em>@ethersproject/providers</em>. Both have been removed from npm.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<div><p>As RL noted in its <a href="https://www.reversinglabs.com/sscs-report" rel="noopener">2025 Software Supply Chain Security Report</a>, the scope of software supply chain risks is growing for both software producers and end-user organizations. While there was a drop in instances of malware discovered on open-source repositories like npm and PyPI in 2024, threat actors have not lost interest in promoting malicious packages to open-source developers.&nbsp;</p><p>This latest campaign is evidence that the risk of downloading malware and compromising development environments and networks remains high, while novel ways of serving malicious payloads are emerging.</p><p>The RL research team has already seen malicious packages serving malicious payloads that was in plain sight, obfuscated or cleverly hidden. Sometimes these packages are malicious by design. Other times, popular legitimate npm packages were hijacked and injected with malicious code. In these cases, there is usually a combination of approaches: the designed-malicious npm package injects a malicious payload into a legitimate and locally installed npm package, making it serve as a reverse shell. This approach makes it easier for the threat actor by reducing hurdles to hijacking a malicious open-source package.&nbsp;</p><p>What is even more ominous with this current threat: Even if the malicious package <span>ethers-provider2</span> is removed, the threat actors made sure their malicious functionality would persist. This highlights the importance of being alert to supply chain threats and attacks, since there are many malicious packages lurking on npm, serving malware in novel and not-so-novel ways.</p></div>
<h2>Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)</h2>
<div><p>Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) refer to forensic artifacts or evidence related to a security breach or unauthorized activity on a computer network or system. IOCs play a crucial role in cybersecurity investigations and cyber incident response efforts, helping analysts and cybersecurity professionals identify and detect potential security incidents.</p><p>The following IOCs were collected as part of RL's investigation of this malicious software supply chain campaign.</p></div>
