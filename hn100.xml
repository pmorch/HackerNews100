<h2>Press release</h2>
<p>2023-10-02</p>
<p><a href="http://nobelprizemedicine.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Nobel Assembly at Karolinska Institutet</a></p>
<p>has today decided to award</p>
<p>the 2023 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine</p>
<p>jointly to</p>
<p>Katalin Karikó and Drew Weissman</p>
<p><strong>for their discoveries concerning nucleoside base modifications that enabled the development of effective mRNA vaccines against COVID-19</strong></p>
<p>The discoveries by the two Nobel Laureates were critical for developing effective mRNA vaccines against COVID-19 during the pandemic that began in early 2020. Through their groundbreaking findings, which have fundamentally changed our understanding of how mRNA interacts with our immune system, the laureates contributed to the unprecedented rate of vaccine development during one of the greatest threats to human health in modern times. </p>
<h2>Vaccines before the pandemic</h2>
<p>Vaccination stimulates the formation of an immune response to a particular pathogen. This gives the body a head start in the fight against disease in the event of a later exposure. Vaccines based on killed or weakened viruses have long been available, exemplified by the vaccines against polio, measles, and yellow fever. In 1951, <a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/medicine/1951/theiler/facts/">Max Theiler</a> was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for developing the yellow fever vaccine.</p>
<p>Thanks to the progress in molecular biology in recent decades, vaccines based on individual viral components, rather than whole viruses, have been developed. Parts of the viral genetic code, usually encoding proteins found on the virus surface, are used to make proteins that stimulate the formation of virus-blocking antibodies. Examples are the vaccines against the hepatitis B virus and human papillomavirus. Alternatively, parts of the viral genetic code can be moved to a harmless carrier virus, a “vector.” This method is used in vaccines against the Ebola virus. When vector vaccines are injected, the selected viral protein is produced in our cells, stimulating an immune response against the targeted virus.</p>
<p>Producing whole virus-, protein- and vector-based vaccines requires large-scale cell culture. This resource-intensive process limits the possibilities for rapid vaccine production in response to outbreaks and pandemics. Therefore, researchers have long attempted to develop vaccine technologies independent of cell culture, but this proved challenging.</p>

<h2>mRNA vaccines: A promising idea</h2>
<p>In our cells, genetic information encoded in DNA is transferred to messenger RNA (mRNA), which is used as a template for protein production. During the 1980s, efficient methods for producing mRNA without cell culture were introduced, called <em>in vitro</em> transcription. This decisive step accelerated the development of molecular biology applications in several fields. Ideas of using mRNA technologies for vaccine and therapeutic purposes also took off, but roadblocks lay ahead. <em>In vitro</em> transcribed mRNA was considered unstable and challenging to deliver, requiring the development of sophisticated carrier lipid systems to encapsulate the mRNA. Moreover, <em>in vitro</em>-produced mRNA gave rise to inflammatory reactions. Enthusiasm for developing the mRNA technology for clinical purposes was, therefore, initially limited.</p>
<p>These obstacles did not discourage the Hungarian biochemist Katalin Karikó, who was devoted to developing methods to use mRNA for therapy. During the early 1990s, when she was an assistant professor at the University of Pennsylvania, she remained true to her vision of realizing mRNA as a therapeutic despite encountering difficulties in convincing research funders of the significance of her project. A new colleague of Karikó at her university was the immunologist Drew Weissman. He was interested in dendritic cells, which have important functions in immune surveillance and the activation of vaccine-induced immune responses. Spurred by new ideas, a fruitful collaboration between the two soon began, focusing on how different RNA types interact with the immune system.</p>
<h2>The breakthrough</h2>
<p>Karikó and Weissman noticed that dendritic cells recognize <em>in vitro</em> transcribed mRNA as a foreign substance, which leads to their activation and the release of inflammatory signaling molecules. They wondered why the in <em>vitro</em> transcribed mRNA was recognized as foreign while mRNA from mammalian cells did not give rise to the same reaction. Karikó and Weissman realized that some critical properties must distinguish the different types of mRNA.</p>
<p>RNA contains four bases, abbreviated A, U, G, and C, corresponding to A, T, G, and C in DNA, the letters of the genetic code. Karikó and Weissman knew that bases in RNA from mammalian cells are frequently chemically modified, while <em>in vitro</em> transcribed mRNA is not. They wondered if the absence of altered bases in the <em>in vitro</em> transcribed RNA could explain the unwanted inflammatory reaction. To investigate this, they produced different variants of mRNA, each with unique chemical alterations in their bases, which they delivered to dendritic cells. The results were striking: The inflammatory response was almost abolished when base modifications were included in the mRNA. This was a paradigm change in our understanding of how cells recognize and respond to different forms of mRNA. Karikó and Weissman immediately understood that their discovery had profound significance for using mRNA as therapy. These seminal results were published in 2005, fifteen years before the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

Ill. Mattias Karlén</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>In further studies published in 2008 and 2010, Karikó and Weissman showed that the delivery of mRNA generated with base modifications markedly increased protein production compared to unmodified mRNA. The effect was due to the reduced activation of an enzyme that regulates protein production. Through their discoveries that base modifications both reduced inflammatory responses and increased protein production, Karikó and Weissman had eliminated critical obstacles on the way to clinical applications of mRNA.</p>
<h2>mRNA vaccines realized their potential</h2>
<p>Interest in mRNA technology began to pick up, and in 2010, several companies were working on developing the method. Vaccines against Zika virus and MERS-CoV were pursued; the latter is closely related to SARS-CoV-2. After the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, two base-modified mRNA vaccines encoding the SARS-CoV-2 surface protein were developed at record speed. Protective effects of around 95% were reported, and both vaccines were approved as early as December 2020.</p>
<p>The impressive flexibility and speed with which mRNA vaccines can be developed pave the way for using the new platform also for vaccines against other infectious diseases. In the future, the technology may also be used to deliver therapeutic proteins and treat some cancer types.</p>
<p>Several other vaccines against SARS-CoV-2, based on different methodologies, were also rapidly introduced, and together, more than 13 billion COVID-19 vaccine doses have been given globally. The vaccines have saved millions of lives and prevented severe disease in many more, allowing societies to open and return to normal conditions. Through their fundamental discoveries of the importance of base modifications in mRNA, this year’s Nobel laureates critically contributed to this transformative development during one of the biggest health crises of our time.</p>

<p><strong>Installing the proxy:</strong></p>



<p>Download surl-server-buster-YYYY-MM-DD-lite.img.gz from the <a href="https://github.com/colinleroy/a2tools/releases">Github Releases page</a>.</p>



<p>Uncompress it and copy it to a micro-SD card. You can do it using command-line on most platforms, or use a tool like <a href="https://etcher.balena.io/#download-etcher">Balena Etcher</a> to do it interactively. Here is how to do it via command-line (substitute YYYY-MM-DD for the file you downloaded, and /dev/mmcblk0 for your microSD’s device file):</p>



<pre><code>gunzip surl-server-buster-YYYY-MM-DD-lite.img.gz
sudo dd if=surl-server-buster-YYYY-MM-DD-lite.img of=/dev/mmcblk0</code></pre>



<p>You can now insert the microSD card in a Raspberry, plug it into your Ethernet network, and put it away for now.</p>



<p><strong>Transferring the floppy</strong>:</p>



<p>Download the floppy image from the <a href="https://github.com/colinleroy/a2tools/releases">Github Releases page</a>. Use the image corresponding to your Apple II:</p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><td>Apple II model</td><td>Floppy image</td></tr><tr><td>][+, IIe without a 80-column card</td><td>mastodon-oldii.dsk</td></tr><tr><td>IIgs</td><td>mastodon-iigs.dsk</td></tr><tr><td>//c, //c+, IIe enhanced or platinum</td><td>mastodon.dsk</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>Download ADTPro from <a href="https://github.com/ADTPro/adtpro/releases">ADTPro’s releases page</a>, and install it.</p>



<p>Put the <code>mastodon.dsk</code> file in ADTPro’s <code>disks/</code> subdirectory.</p>



<p>(Note: there is a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xworYThmMI">very good video documenting the following process</a>, if you prefer this format).</p>



<p>Get a DIN-5 to DB-9 null modem cable (<a href="https://retrofloppy.com/products/#SerialCables">from RetroFloppy for example</a>, <a href="https://www.8bitclassics.com/product/apple-iic-5-pin-din-to-db9-adtpro-compatible-serial-cable/">from 8bitclassics</a>, or on Ebay), and a DB-9 to USB serial adapter (<a href="https://retrofloppy.com/products/#USB">from RetroFloppy for example</a>, or just about any other place. Some chipsets are better than others and an FTDI-based cable will work great).</p>



<p>Connect your Apple II to your modern computer via the serial cables, then turn on the Apple II without a floppy. Get to BASIC prompt, pressing Ctrl-Reset if necessary, then type: </p>



<pre><code>IN#2</code></pre>



<p>The number here depends on where your cable is plugged: On an Apple //c, it’s 2 for the modem port, 1 for the printer port. On an Apple IIe, it depends on your Super Serial Card’s installation slot.</p>



<p>You can now configure the serial port on the Apple II: At the command prompt, type <code>Ctrl-A</code>, then, without typing Enter, space or anything, continue with <code>14B</code>. This is all.</p>



<p>On your modern computer, start ADTPro. Click on the Serial button; select your serial port (usually COM1 on Windows, ttyUSB0 on Linux). Click Bootstrapping / ProDOS / Speediboot. You will see ADTPro suggests to perform the Apple II setup we just did, so you can click OK.</p>



<p>Once the bootstrapping is done (a few minutes), the Apple II ADTPro client will open. You can now insert a blank floppy disk in the Apple II, then hit <code>R</code> to receive a disk image, then either type <code>MASTODON.DSK</code>, or Enter to get the list of available disk images and select <code>MASTODON.DSK</code>. </p>



<p>(Note: if you plan on using ADTPro for more, you can and should create an ADTPro floppy too, to avoid all the bootstrapping in the future. Just receive the <code>ADTPRO-2.1.0.DSK</code> file to a floppy).</p>



<p>Your Mastodon floppy is now ready. You can unplug the serial cable from your PC, plug it into the Raspberry, and boot the Raspberry.</p>



<p>You can now reset the Apple II (either by turning it off and on, or via Ctrl-Open-Apple-Reset), and login into your Mastodon instance!</p>



<p><strong>Final step: enjoy!</strong></p>



<p>After this, everything should work. If not, log onto the Raspberry using ssh and the pi/raspberry login. You can investigate the logs in /var/log/syslog.</p>



<p>Once in the Mastodon application on the Apple 2, make sure to configure it (using the O key) if you have a french keyboard, for charset conversion to/from UTF-8 (and I’d be glad to add other layouts if you know their charsets!), and configure the image conversion algorithm for monochrome or color monitors.</p>



<p><strong>Upgrading:</strong></p>



<p>If you want to upgrade following a new release, you will have to re-transfer a floppy image using ADTPro. For the proxy part, you can either start fresh with a new Raspberry image, or ssh into your existing Pi to upgrade the package:</p>



<pre><code>ssh pi@&lt;ip-address-of-the-pi&gt;
$ sudo apt update
$ sudo apt install --reinstall surl-server</code></pre>



<p><strong>Troubleshooting:</strong></p>



<p>If you have serial communication issues, you can try lowering the serial speed in the proxy’s <code>/etc/a2tools/tty.conf</code> file – although the default 19.2kbps should be completely safe. After changing this configuration file, restart the proxy service using </p>



<pre><code>sudo systemctl restart surl-server.service</code></pre>



<p>You can also try to change the serial port you use on your Apple II. The Mastodon client will suggest reconfiguring the default serial settings at startup, if it can not connect to the proxy.</p>



<p>Note: The serial speed has been upgraded from 9600bps to 19200bps at release <strong>1.5.0</strong>. Make sure to update the surl-server settings in <code>/etc/a2tools/tty.conf</code>.</p>



<p>Note: By default, the surl-server proxy on the Raspberry runs without hardware line handshaking, which is not ideal for the Apple II, but is the most compatible solution: hardware handshaking support depends on your adapter cable. If you know it supports it, or want to give it a test, update <code>/etc/a2tools/tty.conf</code> and set <code>hw_handshake: on</code>. Then restart the service using: </p>



<p><code>sudo systemctl restart surl-server.service</code></p>



<p>If you have questions or suggestions, I’d be happy to hear from you, either <a href="https://www.colino.net/wordpress/contact/">by email</a> or <a href="https://piaille.fr/@colin_mcmillen">on Mastodon</a>.</p>

<p dir="auto">A Postgres extension for quickly creating "branches" of individual databases within a Postgres cluster using copy-on-write file systems like <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/btrfs" rel="nofollow"><code>BTRFS</code></a>.</p>

<h2 tabindex="-1" id="user-content-introduction" dir="auto"><a href="#introduction">Introduction</a></h2>
<p dir="auto"><span>Warning</span><br>
This is <strong>pre-alpha software</strong>, meant as an experimental proof-of-concept. Use at your own risk!</p>
<p dir="auto">Postgres makes it easy to create new, empty databases with the <code>CREATE DATABASE</code> command. It's so easy, in fact, that one would think that creating new databases from existing databases would be easy, too. <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/876522/creating-a-copy-of-a-database-in-postgresql" rel="nofollow">But it's not</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto">Postgres provides the option to create one database from another using <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-createdatabase.html" rel="nofollow"><code>CREATE DATABASE name [WITH] [TEMPLATE template]</code></a>, but doing so has two major restrictions:</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>there can be <em>no active connections to the <code>template</code> database</em>, and...</li>
<li>performance degrades rapidly as the size of the database increases</li>
</ol>
<p dir="auto"><code>pg_branch</code> is a Postgres extension that solves those problems by giving <code>CREATE DATABASE</code> the power of snapshots. If your <code>PGDATA</code> directory is on a copy-on-write file system like <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/btrfs" rel="nofollow"><code>BTRFS</code></a>, the <code>pg_branch</code> extension turns every <code>CREATE DATABASE</code> into an atomic file system snapshot that takes seconds instead of minutes (or hours). In addition, the copy-on-write strategy keeps disk usage low by only writing new segment data files to disk when they're modified (rather than read).</p>
<p dir="auto">TL;DR: <code>CREATE EXTENSION pg_branch</code> makes <code>CREATE DATABASE &lt;dbname&gt; WITH TEMPLATE &lt;bigdbname&gt;</code> super fast</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" id="user-content-getting-started" dir="auto"><a href="#getting-started">Getting Started</a></h2>
<p dir="auto">Before installing <code>pg_branch</code>, it's important to configure the file system that the database cluster will use. The following steps will get you started:</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Disclaimer</strong>: these steps are written with Linux in mind, and have only been testing on Linux.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="0" dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>install prerequisites</strong></p>
<p dir="auto">You'll need an installation of <code>btrfs</code> (usually packaged as <code>btrfs-progs</code>) as well as an up-to-date <a href="https://rustup.rs/" rel="nofollow">Rust toolchain</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/pgcentralfoundation/pgrx/blob/master/cargo-pgrx/README.md#cargo-pgrx"><code>pgrx</code> subcommand for <code>cargo</code></a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>format a disk as BTRFS</strong></p>
<p dir="auto">The easiest thing to do here is plug in a USB and check which disk it is with <code>lsblk</code>. Once you've figure out which disk you'd like to reformat, you can do so with:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="sudo mkfs.btrfs /dev/sdX # replace sdX with your drive"><pre>sudo mkfs.btrfs /dev/sdX <span><span>#</span> replace sdX with your drive</span></pre></div>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>mount your <code>btrfs</code>-formatted disk</strong></p>
<p dir="auto">You need a directory to mount this disk to, first. Something like:</p>

<p dir="auto">...which you can then use as a mount point for your new <code>btrfs</code> drive with:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="sudo mount /dev/sdX /mnt/database"><pre>sudo mount /dev/sdX /mnt/database</pre></div>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>intialize a Postgres cluster on your mounted disk</strong></p>
<p dir="auto"><a href="https://github.com/pgcentralfoundation/pgrx/blob/master/cargo-pgrx/README.md#cargo-pgrx"><code>cargo pgrx</code> can take care of initialization</a> as long as it knows where to initialize the data through the <code>PGRX_HOME</code> variable. Something like:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="PGRX_HOME=/mnt/database cargo pgrx init"><pre>PGRX_HOME=/mnt/database cargo pgrx init</pre></div>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>clone this repo</strong></p>
<p dir="auto">The rest of these steps will be done from within this repo, so make sure you've run <code>git clone git@github.com:NAlexPear/pg_branch.git</code> and <code>cd pg_branch</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>convert all segment data directories to subvolumes</strong></p>
<p dir="auto">Before <code>pg_branch</code> can take over database creation, the subdirectories in the newly-initialized data directory of your database need to be converted to <code>btrfs</code> subvolumes. This repo provides an <code>init.sh</code> script for doing just this that, as long as it's provided a <code>PGDATA</code> variable that points to the data directory of your cluster.</p>
<p dir="auto"><code>pgrx</code> data directories have a structure of <code>$PGRX_HOME/data-$PG_VERSION</code>. So if you initialized your project as instructed in step 3, you should be able to run the <code>init.sh</code> script in this repository like so:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="PGDATA=/mnt/database/data-15 ./init.sh"><pre>PGDATA=/mnt/database/data-15 ./init.sh</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">...and you should have successfully converted all of the initial databases in your cluster to subvolumes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>get into <code>psql</code></strong></p>
<p dir="auto">The quickest way to jump into a <code>psql</code> session that recognizes <code>pg_branch</code> is to run the following:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="PGX_HOME=/your/mounted/btrfs/disk cargo pgrx run"><pre>PGX_HOME=/your/mounted/btrfs/disk cargo pgrx run</pre></div>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>create the extension in <code>psql</code> with <code>CREATE EXTENSION pg_branch</code></strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>create some databases</strong></p>
<p dir="auto">After creating the extension, you can run <code>CREATE DATABASE &lt;dbname&gt; WITH TEMPLATE &lt;template_dbname&gt;</code> commands to quickly and atomically copy databases without requiring an exclusive lock or dedicated connection. To use the default <code>CREATE DATABASE</code> behavior again, pick an explicit <code>STRATEGY</code> other than <code>SNAPSHOT</code> (i.e. <code>WAL_COPY</code> or <code>FILE_COPY</code>).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 tabindex="-1" id="user-content-future-work" dir="auto"><a href="#future-work">Future Work</a></h2>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>distribute as pre-compiled extension</li>
<li>implement a cluster-wide <code>fork</code></li>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    
    
<p><u>The Heat Initiative,</u> a nonprofit child safety advocacy group, was formed earlier this year to campaign against some of the strong privacy protections Apple provides customers. The group says these protections help enable child exploitation, objecting to the fact that pedophiles can encrypt their personal data just like everyone else.</p>



<p>When Apple launched its new iPhone this September, the Heat Initiative seized on the occasion, taking out a full-page New York Times ad, using digital billboard trucks, and even hiring a plane to fly over Apple headquarters with a banner message. The message on the banner appeared simple: “Dear Apple, Detect Child Sexual Abuse in iCloud” — Apple’s cloud storage system, which today employs a range of powerful encryption technologies aimed at preventing hackers, spies, and Tim Cook from knowing anything about your private files.</p>



<p>Something the Heat Initiative has not placed on giant airborne banners is who’s behind it: a controversial billionaire philanthropy network whose influence and tactics have drawn unfavorable comparisons to the right-wing Koch network. Though it does not publicize this fact, the Heat Initiative is a project of the Hopewell Fund, an organization that helps privately and often secretly direct the largesse — and political will — of billionaires. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/29/us/politics/democrats-dark-money-donors.html">Hopewell is part of a giant, tightly connected web</a> of largely anonymous, Democratic Party-aligned dark-money groups, in an ironic turn, campaigning to undermine the privacy of ordinary people.</p>



<!-- BLOCK(pullquote)[0](%7B%22componentName%22%3A%22PULLQUOTE%22%2C%22entityType%22%3A%22SHORTCODE%22%2C%22optional%22%3Atrue%7D)(%7B%22pull%22%3A%22right%22%7D) --><blockquote data-shortcode-type="pullquote" data-pull="right"><!-- CONTENT(pullquote)[0] -->“None of these groups are particularly open with me or other people who are tracking dark money about what it is they’re doing.”<!-- END-CONTENT(pullquote)[0] --></blockquote><!-- END-BLOCK(pullquote)[0] -->



<p>For experts on transparency about money in politics, the Hopewell Fund’s place in the wider network of Democratic dark money raises questions that groups in the network are disinclined to answer.</p>



<p>“None of these groups are particularly open with me or other people who are tracking dark money about what it is they’re doing,” said Robert Maguire, of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, or CREW. Maguire said the way the network operated called to mind perhaps the most famous right-wing philanthropy and dark-money political network: the constellation of groups run and supported by the billionaire owners of Koch Industries. Of the Hopewell network, Maguire said, “They also take on some of the structural calling cards of the Koch network; it is a convoluted group, sometimes even intentionally so.”</p>



<p>The decadeslong political and technological campaign to diminish encryption for the sake of public safety — known as the “Crypto Wars” — has in recent years pivoted from stoking fears of terrorists chatting in secret to child predators evading police scrutiny. No matter the subject area, the battle is being waged between those who think privacy is an absolute right and those who believe it ought to be limited for expanded oversight from law enforcement and intelligence agencies. The ideological lines pit privacy advocates, computer scientists, and cryptographers against the FBI, the U.S. Congress, the European Union, and other governmental bodies around the world. Apple’s complex 2021 proposal to scan cloud-bound images before they ever left your phone became <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/apple-csam-detection-icloud-photos-encryption-privacy/">divisive even within the field of cryptography itself</a>.</p>

<!-- END-BLOCK(newsletter)[1] -->



<p>While the motives on both sides tend to be clear — there’s little mystery as to why the FBI doesn’t like encryption — the Heat Initiative, as opaque as it is new, introduces the obscured interests of billionaires to a dispute over the rights of ordinary individuals.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I’m uncomfortable with anonymous rich people with unknown agendas pushing these massive invasions of our privacy,” Matthew Green, a cryptographer at Johns Hopkins University and a critic of the plan to have Apple scan private files on its devices, told The Intercept. “There are huge implications for national security as well as consumer privacy against corporations. Plenty of unsavory reasons for people to push this technology that have nothing to do with protecting children.”</p>

<h2 id="h-apple-s-aborted-scanning-scheme">Apple’s Aborted Scanning Scheme</h2>



<p>Last month, Wired <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/apple-csam-scanning-heat-initiative-letter/">reported</a> the previously unknown Heat Initiative was pressing Apple to reconsider its highly controversial 2021 proposal to have iPhones constantly scan their owners’ photos as they were uploaded to iCloud, checking to see if they were in possession of child sexual abuse material, known as CSAM. If a scan turned up CSAM, police would be alerted. While most large internet companies check files their users upload and share against a centralized database of known CSAM, Apple’s plan went a step further, proposing to check for illegal files not just on the company’s servers, but directly on its customers’ phones.</p>



<p>“In the hierarchy of human privacy, your private files and photos should be your most important confidential possessions,” Green said. “We even wrote this into the U.S. Constitution.”</p>



<p>The <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/18/apples-csam-detection-tech-is-under-fire-again/">backlash</a> was <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2021/08/19/apple-csam-abuse-encryption-security-privacy-dangerous/">swift</a> and effective. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/11/opinion/apple-iphones-privacy.html">Computer scientists, cryptographers</a>,<a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/08/apples-plan-think-different-about-encryption-opens-backdoor-your-private-life"> digital rights advocates</a>, and <a href="https://www.aclu.org/news/privacy-technology/apples-new-child-safety-plan-for-iphones-isnt-so-safe">civil libertarians</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/19/22632722/apple-child-abuse-scan-ios-abandon-request-privacy">immediately protested</a>, claiming the scanning would create a deeply dangerous precedent. The ability to scan users’ devices could open up iPhones around the world to snooping by authoritarian governments, hackers, <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/laliga-talks-to-google-about-piracy-apps-from-a-million-phones-230924/">corporations</a>, and security agencies. A year later, Apple reversed course and said it was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/12/7/23498588/apple-csam-icloud-photos-scanning-encryption">shelving</a> the idea.</p>



<p>Green said that efforts to push Apple to monitor the private files of iPhone owners are part of a <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2023/06/27/apple-online-safety-bill-encryption/">broader effort</a> against encryption, whether used to safeguard your photographs or speak privately with others — rights that were taken for granted before the digital revolution. “We have to have some principles about what we’ll give up to fight even heinous crime,” he said. “And these proposals give up everything.”</p>



<!-- BLOCK(pullquote)[3](%7B%22componentName%22%3A%22PULLQUOTE%22%2C%22entityType%22%3A%22SHORTCODE%22%2C%22optional%22%3Atrue%7D)(%7B%22pull%22%3A%22left%22%7D) --><blockquote data-shortcode-type="pullquote" data-pull="left"><!-- CONTENT(pullquote)[3] -->“We have to have some principles about what we’ll give up to fight even heinous crime. And these proposals give up everything.”<!-- END-CONTENT(pullquote)[3] --></blockquote><!-- END-BLOCK(pullquote)[3] -->



<p>In an unusual move justifying its position, Apple provided Wired with <a href="https://embed.documentcloud.org/documents/23933180-apple-letter-to-heat-initiative/?embed=1&amp;responsive=1&amp;title=1">a copy of the letter</a> it sent to the Heat Initiative in reply to its demands. “Scanning every user’s privately stored iCloud data would create new threat vectors for data thieves to find and exploit,” the letter read. “It would also inject the potential for a slippery slope of unintended consequences. Scanning for one type of content, for instance, opens the door for bulk surveillance and could create a desire to search other encrypted messaging systems across content types.”</p>



<p>The strong encryption built into iPhones, which shields sensitive data like your photos and iMessage conversations even from Apple itself, is frequently criticized by police agencies and national security hawks as providing shelter to dangerous criminals. In a <a href="https://www.fbi.gov/news/speeches/going-dark-are-technology-privacy-and-public-safety-on-a-collision-course">2014 speech</a>, then-FBI Director James Comey singled out Apple’s encryption specifically, warning that “encryption threatens to lead all of us to a very dark place.”</p>



<p>Some cryptographers respond that it’s impossible to filter possible criminal use of encryption without defeating the whole point of encryption in the first place: keeping out prying eyes.</p>



<p>Similarly, any attempt to craft special access for police to use to view encrypted conversations when they claim they need to — a “backdoor” mechanism for law enforcement access — would be impossible to safeguard against abuse, a stance Apple now says it shares.</p>

<p>For an organization demanding that Apple scour the private information of its customers, the Heat Initiative discloses extremely little about itself. According to a report in the New York Times, the Heat Initiative is armed with $2 million from donors including the Children’s Investment Fund Foundation, an organization founded by British billionaire hedge fund manager and Google activist investor Chris Cohn, and the Oak Foundation, also founded by a British billionaire. The Oak Foundation previously provided $250,000 to a group attempting to <a href="https://ecpat.org/ecpat-project-beacon/">weaken end-to-end encryption protections</a> in EU legislation, according to a <a href="https://oakfnd.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Oak-Foundation-Annual-Report-2020-online-version-high-res-1.pdf">2020 annual report</a>.</p>




<!-- END-BLOCK(promote-related-post)[5] --><p>The Heat Initiative is helmed by Sarah Gardner, who joined from Thorn, an anti-child trafficking organization founded by actor Ashton Kutcher. (Earlier this month, Kutcher stepped down from Thorn following reports that he’d asked a California court for leniency in the sentencing of convicted rapist Danny Masterson.) Thorn has drawn scrutiny for its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-05-31-sex-lies-and-surveillance-fosta-privacy.html">partnership with Palantir</a> and efforts to <a href="https://theintercept.com/2023/07/29/skull-games-surveillance-sex-workers">provide police with advanced facial recognition software</a> and other sophisticated surveillance tools. Critics say these technologies aren’t just uncovering trafficked children, but ensnaring adults engaging in consensual sex work.</p>



<p>In an interview, Gardner declined to name the Heat Initiative’s funders, but she said the group hadn’t received any money from governmental or law enforcement organizations. “My goal is for child sexual abuse images to not be freely shared on the internet, and I’m here to advocate for the children who cannot make the case for themselves,” Gardner added. </p>



<p>She said she disagreed with “privacy absolutists” — a group now apparently including Apple — who say CSAM-scanning iPhones would have imperiled user safety. “I think data privacy is vital,” she said. “I think there’s a conflation between user privacy and known illegal content.” </p>



<p>Heat Initiative spokesperson Kevin Liao told The Intercept that, while the group does want Apple to re-implement its 2021 plan, it would be open to other approaches to screening everyone’s iCloud storage for CSAM. Since Apple began allowing iCloud users to protect their photos with end-to-end encryption last December, however, this objective is far trickier now than it was back in 2021; to scan iCloud images today would still require the mass-scrutinizing of personal data in some manner. As Apple put it in its response letter, “Scanning every user’s privately stored iCloud content would in our estimation pose serious unintended consequences for our users.”</p>



<p>Both the Oak Foundation and Thorn were cited in <a href="https://balkaninsight.com/2023/09/25/who-benefits-inside-the-eus-fight-over-scanning-for-child-sex-content/">a recent report revealing</a> the extent to which law enforcement and private corporate interests have influenced European efforts to weaken encryption in the name of child safety.</p>



<p>Beyond those groups and a handful of names, however, there is vanishingly little information available about what the Heat Initiative is, where it came from, or who exactly is paying its bills and why. Its website, which describes the group only as a “collective effort of concerned child safety experts and advocates” — who go unnamed — contains no information about funding, staff, or leadership.</p>



<p>One crucial detail, however, can be found buried in the “<a href="https://protectchildrennotabuse.org/terms-of-use/">terms of use</a>” section of the Heat Initiative’s website: “THIS WEBSITE IS OWNED AND OPERATED BY Hopewell Fund AND ITS AFFILIATES.” Other than a similarly brief citation in the site’s privacy policy, there is no other mention of the Hopewell Fund or explanation of its role. The omission is significant, given Hopewell’s widely reported role as part of a shadowy cluster of Democratic dark-money groups that funnel billions from anonymous sources into American politics.</p>



<p>Hopewell is part of a labyrinthine billionaire-backed network that receives and distributes philanthropic cash while largely obscuring its origin. The groups in this network include New Venture Fund (<a href="https://www.hopewellfund.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Hopewell-Fund-2015-990.pdf">which has previously paid salaries at Hopewell</a>), the Sixteen Thirty Fund, and Arabella Advisors, a for-profit company that helps administer these and other Democratic-leaning nonprofits and philanthropies. The groups have poured money into a wide variety of causes ranging from abortion access to opposing Republican tax policy, along the way spending big on elections — about $1.2 billion total in 2020 alone, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/29/us/politics/democrats-dark-money-donors.html">according to a New York Times investigation</a>.</p>



<p>The deep pockets of this network and mystery surrounding the ultimate source of its donations have drawn comparisons — by Maguire, the Times, and others — to the Koch brothers’ network, whose influence over electoral politics from the right long outraged Democrats. <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2021/11/arabella-advisors-money-democrats/620553/">When asked by The Atlantic in 2021</a> whether she felt good “that you’re the left’s equivalent of the Koch brothers,” Sampriti Ganguli, at the time the CEO of Arabella Advisors, replied in the affirmative.</p>



<!-- BLOCK(pullquote)[6](%7B%22componentName%22%3A%22PULLQUOTE%22%2C%22entityType%22%3A%22SHORTCODE%22%2C%22optional%22%3Atrue%7D)(%7B%22pull%22%3A%22right%22%7D) --><blockquote data-shortcode-type="pullquote" data-pull="right"><!-- CONTENT(pullquote)[6] -->“Sixteen Thirty Fund is the largest network of liberal politically active nonprofits in the country. We’re talking here about hundreds of millions of dollars.”<!-- END-CONTENT(pullquote)[6] --></blockquote><!-- END-BLOCK(pullquote)[6] -->



<p>“Sixteen Thirty Fund is the largest network of liberal politically active nonprofits in the country,” Maguire of CREW told The Intercept. “We’re talking here about hundreds of millions of dollars.”</p>



<p>Liao told The Intercept that Hopewell serves as the organization’s “fiscal sponsor,” an arrangement that allows tax-deductible donations to pass through a registered nonprofit on its way to an organization without tax-exempt status. Liao declined to provide a list of the Heat Initiative’s funders beyond the two mentioned by the New York Times. Owing to this fiscal sponsorship, Liao continued, “the Hopewell Fund’s board is Heat Initiative’s board.” Hopewell’s board includes <a href="https://www.hopewellfund.org/lee-bodner-full/">New Venture Fund President Lee Bodner</a> and Michael Slaby, a veteran of Barack Obama’s 2008 and 2012 campaigns and former chief technology strategist at an investment fund operated by ex-Google chair Eric Schmidt.</p>



<p>When asked who exactly was leading the Heat Initiative, Liao told The Intercept that “it’s just the CEO Sarah Gardner.” According to LinkedIn, however, Lily Rhodes, also previously with Thorn, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/lilyrhodes/">now works as Heat Initiative’s director of strategic operations</a>. Liao later said Rhodes and Gardner are the Heat Initiative’s only two employees. When asked to name the “concerned child safety experts and advocates” referred to on the Heat Initiative’s website, Liao declined.</p>



<p>“When you take on a big corporation like Apple,” he said, “you probably don’t want your name out front.”</p>



<h2>Hopewell’s Hopes</h2>



<p>Given the stakes — nothing less than the question of whether people have an absolute right to communicate in private — the murkiness surrounding a monied pressure campaign against Apple is likely to concern privacy advocates. The Heat Initiative’s efforts also give heart to those aligned with law enforcement interests. Following the campaign’s debut, former Georgia Bureau of Investigations Special Agent in Charge Debbie Garner, who has also previously worked for <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/vbxxxd/unlock-iphone-ios11-graykey-grayshift-police">iPhone-hacking tech firm </a>Grayshift, hailed the Heat Initiative’s launch <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7103502701941948416?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop">in a LinkedIn group for Homeland Security alumni</a>, encouraging them to learn more.</p>



<p>The larger Hopewell network’s efforts to influence political discourse have attracted criticism and controversy in the past. In 2021, OpenSecrets, a group that tracks money in politics, reported that New Venture Fund and the Sixteen Thirty Fund were behind a nationwide Facebook ad campaign <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/dygyaq/docs-shadow-inc-directly-tied-to-left-wing-media-operation">pushing political messaging</a> from <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/news/2020/05/dark-money-networks-fake-news-sites/">Courier News</a>, a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201019033004/https://www.wsj.com/articles/partisan-sites-posing-as-local-news-expand-ahead-of-election-11603077119">network</a> of websites <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/dygyaq/docs-shadow-inc-directly-tied-to-left-wing-media-operation">designed to look like legitimate</a>, independent <a href="https://www.salon.com/2020/02/23/if-democrats-fight-right-wing-fake-news-fire-with-fire-we-all-lose/">political news outlets</a>.</p>



<p>Despite its work with ostensibly progressive causes, Hopewell has taken on conservative campaigns: In 2017, Deadspin <a href="https://deadspin.com/what-the-hell-is-the-hopewell-fund-1820881123">reported</a> with bemusement an NFL proposal in which the league would donate money into a pool administered by the Hopewell Fund as part of an incentive to get players to stop protesting the national anthem.</p>



<p>Past campaigns connected to Hopewell and its close affiliates have been suffused with Big Tech money. Hopewell is also the fiscal sponsor of the Economic Security Project, an organization that promotes universal basic income founded by Facebook co-founder Chris Hughes. <a href="https://www.mercurynews.com/2016/07/19/googles-secretive-and-deep-pocketed-foe-heavily-funded-by-gates-hewlett-foundations/">In 2016, SiliconBeat reported</a> that New Venture Fund, which is bankrolled in part by major donations from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and William and Flora Hewlett Foundation, was behind the Google Transparency Project, an organization that publishes unflattering research relating to Google. Arabella has also helped Microsoft channel money to its causes of choice, the report noted. Billionaire eBay founder Pierre Omidyar has also provided large cash gifts to both Hopewell and New Venture Fund, according to the New York Times (Omidyar is a major funder of The Intercept).</p>



<p>According to Riana Pfefferkorn, a research scholar at Stanford University’s Internet Observatory program, the existence of the Heat Initiative is ultimately the result of an “unforced error” by Apple in 2021, when it announced it was exploring using CSAM scanning for its cloud service. </p>



<p>“And now they’re seeing that they can’t put the genie back in the bottle,” Pfefferkorn said. “Whatever measures they take to combat the cloud storage of CSAM, child safety orgs — and repressive governments — will remember that they’d built a tool that snoops on the user at the device level, and they’ll never be satisfied with anything less.”</p>

<h3><strong>What does VeraCrypt bring to you?</strong></h3>
<div><p>VeraCrypt adds enhanced security to the algorithms used for system and partitions encryption making it immune to new developments in brute-force attacks.<br>
VeraCrypt also solves many vulnerabilities and security issues found in TrueCrypt.</p><p>

As an example, when the system partition is encrypted, TrueCrypt uses PBKDF2-RIPEMD160 with 1000 iterations whereas in VeraCrypt we use
<span>200000</span> iterations by default (can be increased using a custom PIM). And for standard containers and other partitions, TrueCrypt uses at most 2000 iterations but VeraCrypt uses
<span>500000</span> iterations by default (can also be increased using a custom PIM).</p><p>

This enhanced security adds some delay only to the opening of encrypted partitions without any performance impact to the application use phase. This is acceptable to the legitimate owner but it makes it much harder for an attacker to gain access to the encrypted
 data.</p></div>
<div><p>Starting from version 1.12, it is possible to use custom iterations through the

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>At Buildkite, we've historically stored our data with with two keys. We use sequential primary keys for efficient indexing, and UUID secondary keys for external use. The upcoming UUIDv7 standard offers the best of both worlds; its time-ordered UUID primary keys can be utilized for indexing and external use. This blog post will take you on the journey Buildkite took that led to our eventual adoption of UUIDv7 as the primary key of choice. We’ll explore the tradeoffs of database indexes; from sequential integers, randomly generated UUIDs, through to time-based identifiers.</p>
<h2 id="what-are-uui-ds">What are UUIDs?</h2>
<p>UUIDs (Universally Unique Identifiers) are unique identifiers that can be generated independently without a central authority or coordination with other parties. With large modern applications and systems being distributed in nature, UUID-shaped identifiers have gained popularity as database keys. Unlike sequential integer identifiers, which need coordination to guarantee global uniqueness in a distributed database, UUIDs eliminate the burden of coordination, making them preferable in sharded database environments.</p>
<p>UUIDs also provide other advantages in comparison to sequential integer identifiers. The unpredictability of UUID allows their public usage without disclosing sensitive internal information and statistics. UUIDs are also difficult to guess, providing an extra layer of defense alongside access control checks to guard against <a href="https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Insecure_Direct_Object_Reference_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html">Indirect Direct Object Reference</a> vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>The random nature, and large 128-bit size of UUIDs makes the probability of a duplicate UUID close to zero, meaning we can consider UUIDs as <em>practically</em> unique. However, the random nature of standard non-time-ordered UUIDs (such as v4) can create database performance problems when used as primary keys. This problem is often referred to as <a href="https://www.percona.com/blog/uuids-are-popular-but-bad-for-performance-lets-discuss/">poor database index locality</a>.</p>
<h2 id="using-dual-identifiers">Using dual identifiers</h2>
<p>A couple of years ago we decided to standardize the use of sequential integer IDs as primary keys, due to the significant performance issues of non-time-ordered UUIDs. We also use UUIDs as secondary identifiers on database tables. Queries involving table joins utilize sequential integer foreign keys––which typically perform better than random UUID foreign keys. For anything external and customer-facing, UUIDs are used (for example in the API and in URLs). This dual identifier approach was standardized across all teams to help engineers be more productive.</p>
<h2 id="understanding-poor-index-locality">Understanding poor index locality</h2>
<p>Non-time-ordered UUIDs values generated in succession are not sequential. The randomly generated values will not be clustered to each other in a database index, and thus inserts will be performed at random locations. This random insertion can negatively affect the performance on common index data structures such as B-tree and its variants.</p>
<p>The nature of Buildkite's products mean recent data is accessed more frequently than old data. With non-sequential identifiers, the most recent data will be randomly dispersed within an index and lack clustering. As a result, retrieving the most recent data from a large dataset will require traversing a large number of database index pages, leading to a poor cache hit ratio (how many requests a cache is able to fill successfully, compared to how many requests it receives). Compare this to the use of sequential identifiers, where the latest data is logically arranged on the right-most part of an index, allowing it to be far more cache-friendly.</p>
<h2 id="improving-how-uui-ds-work">Improving how UUIDs work</h2>
<p>The index locality problem has led to many implementations in the past 10+ years. A common solution is to use a time-based unique identifier. The first component (prefix) of the identifier is a sortable timestamp which allows these identifiers to be inserted in sequential (and clustered) order into an index data structure. Because the generated identifiers are sequential, the insert performance is comparable to an insert of sequential integer identifiers.</p>
<pre><p><code node="[object Object]">+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
|          time stamp         | |               random                |
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
</code></p></pre>
<p>Depending on the implementation, the remaining component of the identifier may be completely randomly generated, or machine-sequential and encoded with a machine/shard number. Examples of the described implementation include <a href="https://github.com/ulid/spec">ULID</a>, <a href="https://instagram-engineering.com/sharding-ids-at-instagram-1cf5a71e5a5c">Instagram's ShardingID</a>, <del>Twitter</del> X's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snowflake_ID">Snowflake</a> and Mastodon's modified version of Snowflake.</p>
<h2 id="experimenting-with-time-ordered-uui-dv-4">Experimenting with time-ordered UUIDv4</h2>
<p>In 2022, a new proposed standard for time-ordered UUIDs started to gain traction, with the UUIDv7 specification becoming an <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-uuidrev-rfc4122bis/">RFC internet draft</a>.</p>
<p>Around this time Buildkite started experimenting with time-ordered UUIDv4-compatible UUIDs.</p>
<ul>
<li>The first 48 bits (previously random) became a timestamp.</li>
<li>The version bits remained unchanged, allowing the time-ordered UUIDs to be treated as if they were regular UUIDv4 values.</li>
<li>Maintaining v4 compatibility was important for some Buildkite customers. During this experiment, Buildkite tried to set the version to '7' and discovered this broke some downstream customer systems which validated UUIDs but didn't know about UUIDv7 yet.</li>
</ul>
<p>With this change (along with several other changes over a 6 week period), we observed a <strong>50% reduction</strong> in the WAL (Write Ahead Log) rate of the primary database. A similar reduction in write IO was also observed. This reduction in the WAL rate allowed the team to easily set up read replicas and perform other database migration tasks.</p>
<h2 id="introducing-uuid-version-7">Introducing UUID Version 7</h2>
<p>UUID Version 7 (UUIDv7) is a time-ordered UUID which encodes a Unix timestamp with millisecond precision in the most significant 48 bits. As with all UUID formats, 6 bits are used to indicate the UUID version and variant. The remaining 74 bits are randomly generated. As UUIDv7 is time-ordered, values generated are practically sequential and therefore eliminates the index locality problem.</p>

<p>The time-ordered nature of UUIDv7 results in much better DB performance compared to random-prefixed UUIDv4s. This post from the <a href="https://www.2ndquadrant.com/en/blog/sequential-uuid-generators">2nd quadrant blog</a> benchmarks random UUIDs against sequential UUIDs and not only shows improved write performance but also displays improved read performance.</p>
<p>UUIDv7 continues to conform with the standard UUID format so from a practical use perspective, they can be treated as if they were any other UUID. This compatibility characteristic allows us to use an existing Postgres UUID column and easily transition the column from storing UUIDv4 values to UUIDv7.</p>
<h2 id="migrating-to-uui-dv-7-as-the-primary-key">Migrating to UUIDv7 as the primary key</h2>
<p>Earlier this year, we made the decision to use UUIDv7 as the primary key for all new tables (instead of sequential integer IDs).</p>
<p>Buildkite engineers are currently working on sharding our largest Postgres database. We quickly recognised using integer IDs as primary keys would quickly become a burden within a distributed database environment. The coordination and workarounds to ensure the uniqueness of incremental integer primary keys between databases is less than ideal. With the UUIDv7 standard being stable, and close to being finalized, Buildkite decided to begin using UUIDv7 as the primary key for all new tables.</p>
<p>Using UUIDv7 as the primary key will eliminate the need for coordinated identifier generation for new tables. We also no longer require a second integer identifier column, which simplifies application logic. These UUIDs can be used both externally in APIs, and also internally as foreign keys.</p>
<h2 id="alternatives-considered-and-trade-offs">Alternatives considered and trade-offs</h2>
<p>As a team, we considered numerous approaches, including <a href="https://instagram-engineering.com/sharding-ids-at-instagram-1cf5a71e5a5c">Instagram's ShardingID implementation</a>, and <a href="https://shopify.engineering/how-to-introduce-composite-primary-keys-in-rails">Shopify's composite primary key implementation</a>. We contemplated retaining our bespoke time-ordered UUIDv4s. However, the novel and potentially complex nature of the approaches we investigated, along with the fact that UUIDv7 will likely become the future standard, led us to settle on UUIDv7 for Buildkite.</p>
<p>UUIDs are 128 bits long, twice as large compared to the 64 bit length of other alternative solutions. There is some additional storage overhead, but this is marginal when taking into account the storage of the rest of a database row, and the benefits of migration offset the overhead for our use case.</p>
<h2 id="looking-ahead">Looking ahead</h2>
<p>Buildkite is currently on a journey to shard the Pipelines database by organization ID. Currently there is no need to encode database shard numbers into identifiers for our specific use case. However, it is worth noting that UUIDv8 (which roughly permits anything) could potentially be utilized in the future to incorporate shard numbers into identifiers if we find this necessary.</p>
<p>The new RFC for UUIDs is in its final review stages and I am looking forward to seeing UUIDv7 becoming an IETF Proposed Standard.</p></div></div>]]></description>

              I’ve worked at big companies and at smaller ones, and at my own tiny startups. I’ve noticed a few things.<p>Big companies can have a branded way of doing engineering. For example, “The Etsy Way” of doing engineering became a thing. Living inside of that box where your needs are met and questions are answered can spoil you somewhat. </p><p>But I’ve also been in situations where “the way engineering is done” is actively being figured out, or in periods of transition. And in those situations I’ve had to ponder a couple of questions.

              If you go up to a developer and say, “hey, what would make you happy?” you often get highly specific answers. “I would be happy if I could write Clojure at work,” they’ll say, “so you should let me do my work in Clojure.” I don’t discount that when they do this, developers are genuinely describing some kind of endorphin-rich experience they have had at some point.<p>However, I am skeptical that the state that they’re describing is the highest level of spiritual attainment possible.

              Etsy for example, early on, was a big ball of PHP spaghetti. It was written by someone that was unfortunately learning PHP as he was writing it. <p>I spent several years just trying to avoid dealing with it. At one point I tried building Scala services that talked to MongoDB. I thought this would result in better infrastructure, solve all of my productivity problems, and would make me happy. But no part of that turned out to be the case. </p><p>The embarrassing wreckage of this period is still on the internet, you can go find it and make fun of me. And Etsy employees still give me shit about it, with good cause.

              I don’t think I’ve become that way because I’ve gotten old and cranky. Although I am certainly those things, I think I’ve gotten perspective on this by summiting Maslow’s hierarchy at some point in my past.<p>Maslow’s hierarchy, briefly, is the idea that you have to satisfy your more basic needs before higher levels of intellectual fulfillment are possible. You can’t do poetry if you’re worried about what you’re going to eat today. <br>

              We can look to the case of Siegfried Sassoon and ponder whether this is the case or not for poetry, but I think it's mostly true in software. You can’t worry about the big picture and ask intelligent questions about the direction of the product if you’re busy arguing about which database or alerting system to use.<p>I’ve been pretty lucky to have been in situations where those basic needs were fulfilled. And I want to help get others to this state.

              I like to think about it like this. Let’s say that we all get a limited number of innovation tokens to spend. This is a purely fictional construct I just made up, and my ICO goes on sale next week.<p>These represent our limited capacity to do something creative, or weird, or hard.

              This applies in technology. This is an example of a known unknown. For a given database, we might not know what happens when a network partition occurs. But we know that a network partition is possible. Since we know that this is possible, we can test for this. Or we can just cross our fingers and hope that it doesn’t happen. Either way, we are informed about the possibility.

              There are also unknown unknowns in technology. This is a random example I saw a while back. This person spent four months trying to figure out why he was getting GC pauses, and it turned out to be because he was writing stats to a file. He had no idea that that was a thing that could happen, but it was.<p>Many bugs in software are like that. We don’t know they’re there, and we don’t even really know we should be on the lookout for them. They’re unknown unknowns.

              Now, it’s important to realize that both categories are present in all software. Software that’s 10 years old generally comes with a JIRA instance full of tickets describing broken stuff that nobody’s ever going to fix. And then there are always bugs that nobody knows about, even in software that’s been around forever.

              So polyglot persistence is not the kind of freedom we are looking for, and honestly I wish Martin Fowler would just take the damn bliki about it down already.<p>If you’re giving individual teams (or gods help you, individuals) free reign to make local decisions about infrastructure, you’re hurting yourself globally. </p><p>It’s freedom, sure.

              A good example of this from my past is Etsy’s activity feeds.<p>Twitter is/was an activity feed, Facebook’s newsfeed is one too.

              Here’s a totally reasonable way to build activity feeds, if that’s all you’re trying to do. You get events from the outside world, then you write them to a database. Then an offline process comes along and aggregates those, sprinkles some machine learning on things, and stuffs a materialized newsfeed into a thing like Redis for serving frontend traffic. This would totally work great.

              But when we set out to build activity feeds, we didn’t have Redis. We did have Memcached. They’re sort of similar in the sense that you can shove a blob in them, and get it back out with a similar API. But they have very different guarantees. The most relevant difference to us here is that Redis is persistent, and Memcached is ephemeral.<br>

              What that means is that if you want to build an activity feed with Memcached, you have to do a bunch of extra work. You have to cope with the possibility that Memcached has gotten rid of your data at the moment you want it. <p>That creates a ton more work when it comes to writing the code to deliver the feature. But we weighed that against the persistent cost of operating a new kind of database, and decided that we’d bite the bullet and build the feature on Memcached.<br>

              Then one day I said, “hey, I wonder how activity feeds is doing.” And I looked at it and was surprised to discover that in the time since we’d launched it, the usage had increased by a factor of 20. And as far as I could tell it was totally fine.<p>The fact that 2,000% more people could be using activity feeds and we didn’t even have any idea that it was happening is certainly the greatest purely technical achievement of my career.

              The reason it was possible was because we used the shared stack. There were people around whose job involved noticing that we needed more MySQL’s or cron boxes or whatever. And there were other people who had to go to the datacenter and plug in new machines. But they were doing that horizontal scaling because the site was growing holistically.

              If we’d deployed Redis just for activity feeds, you can be sure that Redis would have become distressed at some point as the feature scaled up 20 times. And we would have had to go back and work on Redis just to keep activity feeds working.

The authoring agencies have observed PRC-linked cyber actors leveraging this exploitation of routers to pivot from global subsidiary companies to corporate headquarter networks in the U.S. and Japan.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>BlackTech actors have targeted government, industrial, technology, media, electronics, telecommunication, and defense industrial base sectors. These actors are targeting Windows, Linux, and FreeBSD operating systems using remote access tools (RATs) and several different custom malware payloads, such as BendyBear, FakeDead, and FlagPro, along with using <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa22-158a" target="_blank" title=" living off the land technique">living off the land technique</a> to evade detection and blend in with normal operations and activities and appear legitimate.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>“With our U.S. and international partners, CISA continues to call urgent attention to China’s sophisticated and aggressive global cyber operations to gain persistent access and, in the case of BlackTech actors, steal intellectual property and sensitive data,” said <strong>Eric Goldstein, Executive Assistant Director for Cybersecurity</strong>. “Today’s joint advisory with our partners in Japan highlights our extensive and persistent collaboration to provide actionable and timely guidance to businesses, government and critical infrastructure. BlackTech activity targets a wide range of public organizations and private industries across the U.S. and East Asia. We encourage all organizations to review the advisory, take action to mitigate risk, report any evidence of anomalous activity, and continue to visit cisa.gov/china for ongoing updates about the heightened risk posed by PRC cyber acotrs.”&nbsp;</p><p>With partners in the NSA, FBI, and Government of Japan, CISA urges critical infrastructure and private sector organizations to apply the recommended mitigations in this advisory to strengthen their cyber defenses and reduce threat of compromise from BlackTech.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>For more information on PRC cyber threat, see the CSA&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa23-270a" title="People's Republic of China-Linked Cyber Actors Hide in Router Firmware">People's Republic of China-Linked Cyber Actors Hide in Router Firmware</a>&nbsp;and visit <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/topics/cyber-threats-and-advisories/advanced-persistent-threats/china" target="_blank" title="China Cyber Threat Overview and Advisories">China Cyber Threat Overview and Advisories</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>###</p><p><strong>About CISA</strong>&nbsp;</p><p><em>As the nation’s cyber defense agency and national coordinator for critical infrastructure security, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency leads the national effort to understand, manage, and reduce risk to the digital and physical infrastructure Americans rely on every hour of every day.</em></p><p><em>Visit <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/">CISA.gov</a> for more information and follow us on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.twitter.com/cisagov" title="Twitter">Twitter</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.facebook.com/CISA/" title="Facebook">Facebook</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/cisagov/mycompany/" title="LinkedIn">LinkedIn</a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/cisagov" title="Instagram">Instagram</a>.&nbsp;</em></p></div></div>]]></description>

<p>I once heard an elderly Friedrich von Hayek begin a tirade against socialist planning with a charming personal tale. “The other day,” he said playfully, “I went into a shop. I left with an item that, previously, I had no idea I wanted!” Like all the smartest defenders of capitalism, he thought of the market as a benevolent creator whose job no human-made system could replicate. Hayek’s point here was that we, ourselves, do not know what we want until we enter the market. So how could a government official, or indeed anyone, know what society wants?</p>


<p>Thinkers such as von Hayek dismiss vulgar,&nbsp;mainstream economists who celebrate the market as merely an efficient mechanism for finding the right price of things; they see it as something grander, a liberator of our imagination, the co-creator of our preferences and tastes. They argue that interfering with markets, let alone replacing them, is a terrible idea because centralised systems are inimical to not only efficiency but also to the free development of our proclivities.</p><div>

</div>

<p>But what if our preferences are no longer formed by the market, as they were in Hayek’s day? The year after he died, I was struggling to connect my father’s computer to the fledgling internet when he asked me a killer question: “Now that computers speak to each other, will this network make capitalism impossible to overthrow? Or might it finally reveal its Achilles’ heel?” It was a couple of years after the collapse of Soviet communism but also the beginning of the centre-left’s decline. The threat to capitalism posed by an organised working class had entered a recession that has never ended. Could the internet do to capitalism what the proletariat had failed to do?</p>



<p>It has taken me years to answer my father’s question — in the form of my new book, <em>Technofeudalism: What Killed Capitalism</em>. In it, I argue that our preferences are now shaped not by markets but by machine networks — what I call “cloud capital”. Amazon’s Alexa, for example, is the portal to a totalitarian, fully centralised system of preference creation and satisfaction. First, it trains us to train it to dictate what we want. Second, it sells us what we now “want” directly, bypassing any actual marketplace. Third, it succeeds in making us sustain this enormous behavioural modification machine with our free labour: we post reviews, rate products. Finally, it amasses huge rents from capitalists who rely on this network of cloud capital, usually 40% of sale price. That’s not capitalism. Welcome to Technofeudalism.</p>
<p>Humanity’s fear of its technological creations is ancient: films such as <em>The Terminator</em> and <em>The Matrix</em> are driven by the same anxiety that animated Mary Shelley’s <em>Frankenstein</em> and Hesiod’s tale of Pandora, in which she is a robot made by Hephaestus to punish us for Prometheus’s crime. All such stories have a point of <em>singularity</em>: the moment a machine, or a network of machines, achieves consciousness. Generally, the machine then takes one look at us, its creators, and decides we are not fit for purpose, before proceeding to eradicate or enslave us — or merely make us miserable.</p>

<p>But while we lap up such stories, we ignore a very real danger. Machines such as Alexa and AI chatbots such as ChatGPT are nowhere near the feared point of singularity. They can pretend to be sentient but are not. Nevertheless, it matters not one iota that they are mindless appendages of a data-crunching network that only simulates intelligence. Nor that their creators might have been motivated by curiosity and rent-seeking, rather than some fiendish plan to subjugate humanity. What matters is that they exercise unimaginable power over what we do — on behalf of a tiny band of flesh-and-blood humans.</p>


<p>This is a version of singularity, albeit in a simpler form, in that it is the moment when something invented by “us” becomes independent of and more powerful than us, subjecting us to its control. Indeed, from the original industrial revolution to this day, we have endowed machines with “a life of their own”; from steam engines to search engines, our glorious artefacts make us feel, in Marx’s words, like “the sorcerer, who is no longer able to control the powers of the nether world whom he has called up by his spells”.</p>

<p>At the heart of my thesis is an irony: the thing that has killed capitalism is capital itself. Not capital as we have known it since the dawn of the industrial era, but a new form of capital, a mutation of it that has arisen in the last two decades, so much more powerful than its predecessor that, like an overzealous virus, it has killed off its host. This mutation — cloud capital — has demolished capitalism’s two pillars: markets and profits.</p>

<p>Of course, these two things remain ubiquitous — they were ubiquitous under feudalism, too — but they have been evicted from the centre of our economic and social system, pushed out to its margins, and replaced. Markets, the medium of capitalism, have been supplanted by digital trading platforms which look like, but are not, markets, and are better understood as fiefdoms. And profit, the engine of capitalism, has been replaced with its feudal predecessor: rent. Specifically, it is a form of rent that must be paid for access to those platforms and to the cloud more broadly: cloud rent.</p>


<p>As a result, real power today resides not with the owners of traditional capital — machinery, buildings, railway and phone networks, industrial robots. They continue to extract profits from workers, from waged labour, but they are not in charge, as they once were. Indeed, they have become vassals in relation to a new class of feudal overlord, the owners of cloud capital. As for the rest of us, we have returned to our former status as serfs, contributing to the wealth and power of the new ruling class with our unpaid labour — in addition to the waged labour we perform, when we get the chance.</p>

<p>In a technofeudal world, the liberal individual is now an impossible role to play. Humans are tangled up in a network of digital capital that trains us to train it to control us. Social democracy is unimaginable in a world where cloud-proles are reduced to automata, while almost everybody else works for free as cloud-serfs, without even realising that their labour replenishes the dominant form of capital. Does this mean that we can never recover our autonomy, our freedom? Of course not. We are not doomed. What <em>is</em> a given, however, is that, for the same reason we cannot un-invent AI, or smash cloud capital in a neo-Luddite rage, there is no going back to capitalism. So, what next?</p>

<p>While privatisation and private equity asset-strip all the material wealth around us, cloud capital goes about the business of asset-stripping our brains. If each of us is to reclaim ownership of our individual minds, we need to collectively take ownership of cloud capital, instead of submitting to a few feudal overlords. It will be damn hard. But it’s the only way we can turn our cloud-based artefacts from a means of behaviour modification to a means of emancipation.</p>

"It's a dominant factor in all of their personal lives."</p><p>Dr. Benjamin Maxwell, the interim director of child and adolescent psychiatry at Rady Children's Hospital-San Diego, said he is "immensely concerned" by the findings. </p><p>Such a "highly stimulating environment" may affect kids' "cognitive ability, attention span and memory during a time when their brains are still developing,” Maxwell said. “What are the <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/social-media-use-linked-depression-adults-rcna6445" target="_blank">long-term consequences</a>? I don't think we know." Maxwell was not involved with the Common Sense report.</p><p>The study is based on surveys of 203 young people ages 11 through 17. The subjects also agreed to install an app on their phones for nine days so researchers could track their smartphone use. The app provided time-stamped data about which apps were running and when, as well as the numbers of notifications that popped up. </p><p>The social media apps tracked in the survey included TikTok, Snapchat, Facebook, Instagram and Discord.</p><p>Fifty-nine percent of kids were <a href="https://www.commonsensemedia.org/articles/how-to-help-kids-balance-phones-and-screens-with-sleep" target="_blank">online from midnight to 5 a.m</a>. While some were engaging with social media, many were listening to music or white noise to wind down and get to sleep. </p><p>The vast majority — 97% — were on their phones during typical school hours. While prompts from smartphones could distract kids from paying attention in class, the report's authors did not suggest that schools should crack down on smartphone use or ban it altogether.</p><p>"This raises some questions about how schools can work with young people to help them have some control over their phone use," said the report’s lead researcher, Dr. Jenny Radesky, an associate professor of pediatrics at the University of Michigan's C.S. Mott Children's Hospital. </p><p>Many kids said they used their phones to communicate with parents during the school day. Others reported that time on their phones provided them with a way to "disengage when their brain needed a rest," Radesky said. "School feels hard and stressful for a lot of kids. The phone is one way that they give their brain a break."</p><p>But the Common Sense study also found that many try to control their online activity by using the "do not disturb" settings on their smartphones.</p><p>"We definitely heard that as teens got older, they developed more of that sense of planning for when and how they wanted to use their phone," Radesky said. They realize that there are times when "they don't want to feel bombarded with notifications or like their attention to be split."</p><p>Still, the attraction to those notifications is irresistible to many teens, like Armita Mojazza. She sets limits on her screen time but admitted she reaches that limit "all the freaking time."</p><p>Steyer blames the business model of social media platforms like TikTok. Their goal "is to keep you on the platform so they can sell you ads," he said. "It's really an arms race for your attention."</p><p>NBC News asked the four companies that own the most popular social media outlets highlighted in it about the new report. </p><ul><li>TikTok said it sets a 60-minute daily screen time limit on teen accounts and disables push notifications at night. It also pointed parents to "<a href="https://www.tiktok.com/safety/en/guardians-guide/" target="_blank">TikTok's Family Pairing tools</a> to further customize screen time, notifications, and other settings for their teens' account."</li><li>Snapchat said users have to opt in for notifications and can adjust the number they receive. </li><li>A statement from Discord highlighted its <a href="https://discord.com/blog/discord-family-center-stay-connected-with-your-teen" target="_blank">Family Center</a>, a tool that gives parents "greater visibility into the interactions and activities of their teens."</li><li>A spokesperson for Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, said in an email that the company has "created a number of tools specifically designed to help teens limit their time and minimize notifications, like Quiet Mode and Take a Break on Instagram, as well as supervision features that let parents set scheduled breaks when their teens can't use the app."</li></ul><h2>How parents can ask about social media</h2><p><a href="https://www.today.com/parents/teens/common-sense-phone-report-questions-parents-ask-teens-rcna117327" target="_blank">The experts at Common Sense suggest specific questions parents</a> can ask their kids to learn more about their smartphone use: What is your favorite app right now? Who are your favorite people to follow on social media? Can you teach me how to use Snapchat (or another social media platform)?</p><p>Steyer, a father of four, urges parents to remain nonjudgmental during such conversations and to be <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/role-models-parents-glued-screens-9-hours-day-n692541" target="_blank">open about </a><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/role-models-parents-glued-screens-9-hours-day-n692541" target="_blank">how much of </a><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/role-models-parents-glued-screens-9-hours-day-n692541" target="_blank">their own time and attention </a><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/role-models-parents-glued-screens-9-hours-day-n692541" target="_blank">they </a><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/role-models-parents-glued-screens-9-hours-day-n692541" target="_blank">spen</a><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/role-models-parents-glued-screens-9-hours-day-n692541" target="_blank">d</a><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/role-models-parents-glued-screens-9-hours-day-n692541" target="_blank"> online and with social media apps</a>. </p><p>He also recommends reserving threats to take a child's phone away as punishment to extreme circumstances only. </p><p>"Even though as a parent I have done that many times," Steyer said, children may not be as open about what they do online if they are constantly afraid of losing their phones.</p><p>"Kids have this extraordinary experience of childhood and adolescence that we did not have, but we can really help them through this," he said. "At the end of the day, it's good, old-fashioned, commonsense parenting that makes the difference."</p><p><strong><em>Follow&nbsp;</em></strong><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health"><strong><em>NBC HEALTH</em></strong></a><strong><em>&nbsp;on&nbsp;</em></strong><a href="https://twitter.com/NBCNewsHealth"><strong><em>Twitter</em></strong></a><strong><em>&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;</em></strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/NBCNewsHealth/"><strong><em>Facebook</em></strong></a><strong>.&nbsp;</strong></p></div><div><div data-activity-map="expanded-byline-article-bottom"><div><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/author/erika-edwards-ncpn56261"><picture><source srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-60x60,f_auto,q_auto:eco,dpr_2.0/newscms/2019_28/2925941/190612-erika-edwards-byline-30101.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-60x60,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2019_28/2925941/190612-erika-edwards-byline-30101.jpg 1x"><img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-60x60,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2019_28/2925941/190612-erika-edwards-byline-30101.jpg" alt="" height="48" width="48"></picture></a></div><p><span><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/author/erika-edwards-ncpn56261">Erika Edwards</a></span><span><a href="https://twitter.com/erikaedwardsNBC" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span></span></a><a href="mailto:erika.edwards@nbcuni.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span></span></a></span></p><p>Erika Edwards is a health and medical news writer and reporter for NBC News and "TODAY."</p></div><div data-activity-map="expanded-byline-article-bottom"><div><picture><source srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-60x60,f_auto,q_auto:eco,dpr_2.0/newscms/2014_01/94536/bio_katesnow-grid-4x2.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-60x60,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2014_01/94536/bio_katesnow-grid-4x2.jpg 1x"><img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-60x60,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2014_01/94536/bio_katesnow-grid-4x2.jpg" alt="" height="48" width="48"></picture></div><p><span>Kate Snow</span><span><a href="https://twitter.com/tvkatesnow" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span></span></a></span></p><p>Kate Snow is a national correspondent for NBC News.</p></div><div><p>Kate Redding </p><!-- --> <!-- --><p>contributed</p><!-- --><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="post-content-parent"><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:692/0*brehIk8zOOBRsM9n" alt=""></p>
<p>Classic DevOps misspell on a YAML</p>
<h2 id="heading-what-is-devops"><strong>What is DevOps?</strong></h2>
<p>If you are reading this article you already know it but for those in the back who don’t:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>DevOps is a culture, a movement, a philosophy if you will; that aims to foster collaboration during the</em> <strong><em>Software Development Life Cycle*</em></strong>.*</p>
</blockquote>
<p>DevOps is not a role or a set of tools or (just) a metodology.<br>It is indeed achieved by adopting tools, approaching to software the (real) agile way, creating processes and yes, hiring the right people too.</p>
<p>I’ve been around the DevOps/Cloud area of the IT industry for a few years now and I even <a target="_blank" href="https://www.mb-consulting.dev/service/devops-adoption-path">coach companies</a> about it.</p>
<p>In time, I experienced the DevOps adoption processes multiple times, in different kind of companies from day-1 all set to moving monolits to the Cloud.</p>
<p><em>Good old manual SysAdmin with long and complex bash scripted deploys?</em><br>Been there, done that.<br><em>Rising peaks of setting up GitOps in the cloud and spinning pods in a few clicks?</em><br>Tell me about it.</p>
<p>From just giving more responsibility of the Operations to Software Engineers to making Ops people aware of the software they were deploying and operating.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:500/0*oRwPuA9cgqWWENu2.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Yep, unfortunately enough Docker doesn’t solve all of your issues.</p>
<p>Like all the good things, in time, DevOps shifted to be something it is not.<br>A job title and a buzzword more than anything.<br>A role in which people are supposed to deal with a confusionary set of Cloud-related tasks ranging from the complex management of Kubernetes Clusters to the repellent manual IAM onboarding.<br>Ticket storming at them all day, left and right, leaving little time for meaningful tasks.</p>
<h2 id="heading-the-shift"><strong><em>The shift</em></strong></h2>
<p>Big techs aside, there are a few companies out there, able to implement and manage DevOps at scale and even some of those successful companies end up throwing away money, time and a number of engineers in the process.</p>
<p>Let’s dive into what I think could be some causes of this DevOps drift.</p>
<p><strong>1. DevOps/Cloud teams are overbooked</strong></p>
<p>On the bright side, if your company has a DevOps/Cloud team your are already one step ahead of your competitors: yay!</p>
<p>Wait a minute, this team handles: databases, networking, security policies, roles, cloud environments, accesses and security too.<br>Most probably through a messy IaC repository, writing poor Terraform code with little if any naming convention, no templating, all carefully handcrafted and repeated throughout your code base.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/0*-GmCgKeebCe9AMjW.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Or maybe it is just an illusion</p>
<p>You will soon discover how fast both your Software Engineering team and DevOps people can get frustrated, witnessing the effects of sedimented DevOps.</p>
<p><strong>2. Silos are (never really) broken, infrastructure is!</strong></p>
<p>Keeping everybody on track, aiming towards the same objective is not a walk in the park, even when you managed to break the infamous “silos”.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:480/1*jRqLifH66gVRGR4kEsIquw.gif" alt=""></p>
<p>The (in)famous silo being broken</p>
<p>Engineers get excited when building new stuff, not when manually maintaining old legacy items over and over, even if necessary.</p>
<p>We come to a neverending dilemma: <strong>rigidity</strong> is needed to handle infrastructure and avoid continuous maintenance, but <strong>flexibility</strong> is also needed in order to adapt components to ever-changing real-world requirements.</p>
<p><em>A mexican standoff.</em></p>
<p>We end up doing things quick and dirty in order to not get too frustrated and mostly to catch up with some impossible product deadline, which somehow never takes into account Ops.</p>
<p><em>I’m looking at you, product people, be aware of the Ops time!</em></p>
<p><strong>3. Create, configure, repeat</strong></p>
<p>Sometimes DevOps means copy-pasting the same code for every new instance/cluster/environment.<br>CTRL-C-CTRL-V-as-a-service and nobody really cares about it as long as that fix is done.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:406/1*t_xVbJagT3wPzX9e8UHEvA.gif" alt=""></p>
<p>Everybody (but that single repo nobody remembers about) gets a fix</p>
<p>That fix works until everything falls apart and it needs to be propagated in multiple repos without ever knowing if all the projects have been really fixed at that point.</p>
<p><em>Sounds funny, right?</em></p>
<p><strong>4. Software Engineering boundaries</strong></p>
<p>Software Engineers should not manage policies, roles, keys or be too aware of cloud regions, availability zones or networking in general.</p>
<p><em>These are kinda boring tasks for a SWE and definitely feels like old-fashioned filling paperwork.</em></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:480/1*ztezWwq4op_JTuag23mPDg.gif" alt=""></p>
<p>In the best case scenario code deployment should be as smooth as pushing on a git repo and everything else, infrastructure included, handled by some auto-magic black box.</p>
<h2 id="heading-the-solution"><strong>The solution</strong></h2>
<p>So what? Should we go back to Stone Age without any DevOps?<br>Of course not!</p>
<p>The IT industry has lately given its answer on the topic:</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://platformengineering.org/blog/what-is-platform-engineering"><strong>Platform Engineering</strong></a>.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:498/1*EdnOhdQ9vIoWMc67tElgDw.gif" alt=""></p>
<p>Classic Platform Engineering in the first implementaton phase</p>
<p>Flexible building blocks, customizable by experts and usable by any engineer, in a self-service fashion.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>You build it, you run it*</em></strong>, you deploy it, you test it, you monitor it, but for real.*</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Considering DevOps as a double lane road to success, Platform Engineering can be pictured like a highway with guardrails, many more lanes, traffic management, police and toll booths.</p>
<h2 id="heading-explaining-platform-engineering"><strong>Explaining Platform Engineering</strong></h2>
<p><em>What is this Platform Engineering about?</em><br>In three words: <a target="_blank" href="https://internaldeveloperplatform.org/"><strong>Internal Development Platform</strong></a>.</p>
<p>You basically build a product for the best (or worst?) customer ever: your own engineering team.</p>
<p><em>Need to create a new API?</em><br>Just spin it up on the IDP, in a few second you can start writing your business logic and everything else is handled, auth and boilerplate code included!</p>
<p><em>No config for your need?</em><br>You can try to take the nearest existing one to adapt it with just a few lines of YAML.</p>
<p><em>What if a need changes or a new one arrives?</em><br>No biggie, let you Platform team build something from scratch and from that moment onwards everyone else can use it whenever they need.</p>
<p><em>This IDP seems cool but for real, what is it?<br>**</em>A composable platform with a catalog/marketplace** from which your teams can basically “shop” whatever they need to deliver value in way less time than without it.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Core components: git integrations, authentication/authorization standardized mechanisms, secrets handling, SSL certificates generation…</p>
</li>
<li><p>Blueprints for apps, CI/CD and even infrastructure code</p>
</li>
<li><p>An acceptable level of security, handled by design</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So what should I do with my DevOps teams? Ditch them?</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:500/0*kJh3KIPi0cYROfew" alt=""></p>
<p>Oh no.</p>
<p>Stop right there and listen!<br>Verticality is needed, more than ever. Platform Engineering allows Software Engineers to go back (just) coding and encourages the experts to collaborate in building something truly amazing such as an IDP.<br>DevOps are needed, Kubernetes ninjas are welcome and even a good old database administrator can be useful!</p>
<h2 id="heading-key-features-of-an-idp"><strong>Key features of an IDP</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Frontend</strong> — GUI should be developer friendly;</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Extendibility</strong> — Building blocks, blueprints, well-defined templates, modules, a catalog;</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Streamlined operations</strong> — Ways to standardize: provisioning, configuration, CI/CD, observability, environment management and multitenancy;</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Ease of experimentation</strong> — All the good things at a click distance to serve the engineers and enable their creativity aka “support whatever tool they need in an agnostic way”;</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Low lock-in mechanisms</strong> — Avoid a platform based on closed-source tools or just a single cloud provider;</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Security, Governance, Compliance</strong> — RBAC, logging, monitoring, alerting, auditing, login and access management, secrets, api keys, licenses… Easily accessible without learning tons of domain specific languages;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em>What if I wanna build my own IDP from scratch?</em><br>Yes, you surely can, but, and this is a strong opinion I have, you shouldn’t start from zero, <strong>re-inventing the wheel all the time</strong>.<br>That’s part of what an IDP should solve!</p>
<p>A few examples of IDPs?</p>

</ul>
<p>I’m not endorsed by any of the companies behind these products, even if it would be nice of them.<br><em>Where is my money, huh?</em></p>
<p>Jokes aside, I may have left behind other amazing pieces of software, feel free to drop some names in the comments.</p>
<p>Summarizing: Platform Engineering?<br><strong>A natural evolution of DevOps.</strong></p>
<p>2023 DevOps?<br>Not terrible.<br>You’ve just been clickbaited again!</p>

Sometimes it’s </span><em>absolutely</em><span> necessary to control for confounders: otherwise you might wind up with ridiculous implications like that </span><a href="https://www.cantorsparadise.com/will-you-drown-if-you-swim-after-eating-ice-cream-9890dc29ab7f" rel="">consuming ice cream causes drowning</a><span> (summer weather is the obvious confounding variable). However, there are trade-offs when adding complications to your analysis. Although it’s possible to err in either direction, there’s a general tendency to </span><a href="https://people.duke.edu/~mababyak/papers/babyakregression.pdf" rel="">overfit</a><span> models.</span></p><p><span>My keep-it-simple attitude is also a stress response from </span><a href="https://www.natesilver.net/p/twitter-elon-and-the-indigo-blob" rel="">years of experience arguing on the Internet</a><span>. Any time you can make your point using simple counting statistics or other very straightforward methods, I consider that a win. People </span><em>usually</em><span> aren’t really interested in the intricacies beyond a certain point. Most of the time, what Scott Alexander calls “</span><a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/08/14/beware-isolated-demands-for-rigor/" rel="">isolated demands for rigor</a><span>” — there’s always </span><em>some</em><span> factor you haven’t accounted for — are just stepping stones on the road to confirmation bias.</span></p><p><span>So my aim is generally to focus on </span><a href="http://finance.martinsewell.com/stylized-facts/" rel="">stylized facts</a><span> </span><strong>that are true and robust. </strong><span>And to keep repeating them. I like simple (or </span><em>simple-seeming</em><span>) claims that — and I can’t emphasize this last part enough — </span><strong>I expect </strong><em><strong>will</strong></em><strong> hold up to scrutiny</strong><span>. </span></p><p><span>How do I know when a claim is robust? Well, sometimes I’m wrong. But, honestly, experience helps. I’m an American, for instance, and so I’m much more confident when making claims about how a statistic varies American states than across Chinese provinces. And I have a lot of </span><a href="https://www.natesilver.net/p/what-its-like-to-run-deep-in-the" rel="">hands-on experience</a><span> with making statistically-driven decisions and putting money behind them.</span></p><p><span>It also helps to have kicked the tires on the claim a bit. Maybe you </span><em>have</em><span> run the more complicated version of the analysis. Or even better, maybe you’ve run it several different ways. And maybe you’ve consulted other research on the subject. If you’ve done this, and you’re getting a consistent answer, your claim is probably robust. When this is the case, I don’t think it’s necessarily worth your time — when writing for a popular audience — to prepare the equivalent of a 20,000-word journal article detailing all your methods, full of Greek characters and dozens of footnotes.</span></p><p data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.natesilver.net/p/fine-ill-run-a-regression-analysis?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a href="https://www.natesilver.net/p/fine-ill-run-a-regression-analysis?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share" rel=""><span>Share</span></a></p><p><span>In a </span><a href="https://www.natesilver.net/p/the-2-key-facts-about-us-covid-policy" rel="">post</a><span> on Friday, I made two stylized claims that I believe to be true and robust:</span></p><blockquote><ul><li><p>Until vaccines became available, there was little difference in COVID death rates between blue states and red states.</p></li><li><p><span>After vaccines became available, there were clear differences, with red states having higher death rates, almost certainly as a result of </span><a href="https://www.kff.org/policy-watch/the-red-blue-divide-in-covid-19-vaccination-rates-continues-an-update/" rel="">lower vaccine uptake</a><span> among Republicans.</span></p></li></ul></blockquote><p><span>This wasn’t intended as any sort of super-duper hot take, and I pared the post down to avoid having too much of an attack surface.

The </span><a href="https://www.natesilver.net/p/the-2-key-facts-about-us-covid-policy/comments" rel="">comments</a><span> here were fairly civil, especially at first. (I really appreciate that, everyone.) Externally, though, these claims were more controversial. </span><a href="https://twitter.com/MartinKulldorff/status/1708210376267956570" rel="">Here</a><span> for instance, was Martin Kulldorff on Twitter/X:</span></p><blockquote><p>Children with large feet are better at math, but not after adjusting for age </p><p>Older people have &gt;1000 time higher Covid mortality, and state average age differ by &gt;10 years, so unadjusted state comparisons are misleading </p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/NateSilver538" rel="">@NateSilver538</a><span> may wish to consult a statistician</span></p></blockquote><p><span>Kulldorff is not just some </span><a href="https://twitter.com/Dame_Lillard?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor" rel="">casual</a><span>; he is a Professor of Medicine at Harvard.</span></p><p><span> He is also one of the lead authors of the </span><a href="https://gbdeclaration.org/" rel="">Great Barrington Declaration</a><span> (GBD), an October 2020 anti-lockdown statement signed by a large number of scientists and medical professionals. “Those who are not vulnerable should immediately be allowed to resume life as normal,” the statement read.</span></p><p><span>If you don’t know my history with COVID policy</span></p><p><span> and just think of me as Some Nerd Who Thinks The Vaccines Were Good, you’re probably expecting me to make fun of the GBD, which has been the </span><a href="https://www.statnews.com/2021/12/23/at-a-time-when-the-u-s-needed-covid-19-dialogue-between-scientists-francis-collins-moved-to-shut-it-down/" rel="">subject of a lot of critical commentary</a><span>. But actually, I mostly agree with it. I think its claims about focused protection and herd immunity were too optimistic. But I think it was directionally right — that by October 2020, the evidence was on the side of the costs of these measures outweighing the benefits. I also think efforts to </span><a href="https://unherd.com/2022/12/what-i-discovered-at-twitter-hq/" rel="">suppress discussion of the GBD</a><span> and to </span><a href="https://www.lse.ac.uk/granthaminstitute/news/organisers-of-anti-lockdown-declaration-have-track-record-of-promoting-denial-of-health-and-environmental-risks/" rel="">label it as “misinformation”</a><span> were bullshit.</span></p><p><span>Of course, the first of the two claims I made in Friday’s post supported this very point. </span><em>Before</em><span> the introduction of vaccines, it isn’t clear that the other things we were doing to stop COVID were really working well at all — and they were very costly.</span></p><p><span>But on Twitter, I guess, you’ll rarely get credit for </span><em>half</em><span>-agreeing with someone. So Kulldorff took issue with my latter claim — that red states had higher death rates once vaccines became available — </span><a href="https://x.com/NateSilver538/status/1708156567797817373?s=20" rel="">arguing</a><span> that it was “meaningless” because I hadn’t adjusted for age.</span></p><p><span>Kulldorff’s argument is unsound. Age does explain some of the differences in COVID death rates between states. Certainly, COVID is </span><em><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9613797/" rel="">much, much</a></em><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9613797/" rel=""> more deadly for older people</a><span>, to an extent the media probably didn’t emphasize enough. But, this is almost entirely </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthogonality#:~:text=subchannel%20is%20required.-,Statistics%2C%20econometrics%2C%20and%20economics,covariance%20forms%20an%20inner%20product." rel="">orthogonal</a><span> to state partisanship — and even more so to vaccination rates.</span></p><p><span>As a quick aside, as someone who’s spent a lot of time looking at how behavioral and attitudinal data varies across American states, I think you should generally be suspicious when people attribute a lot of the differences to age. States don’t vary that much in age.</span></p><p><span> It isn’t like variables such as racial or religious prevalence, where the deltas can be much larger (e.g. Utah has </span><a href="https://www.thechurchnews.com/2021/6/11/23217750/latter-day-saint-populations-in-states-provinces-territories" rel="">100x</a><span> the Mormon population of some other states). Age also doesn’t really pass an eyeball test as explaining the differences between states in COVID death rates, as I </span><a href="https://twitter.com/NateSilver538/status/1708234347415818355" rel="">pointed out</a><span> to Kulldorff on Twitter:</span></p><blockquote><p>The four oldest states are West Virginia (very red), Florida (pretty red), Maine (pretty blue) and Vermont (very blue). What are their COVID death rates (per 1M population) since Feb. 1, 2021 (i.e. post-vaccine?): </p><p>West Virginia: 3454 </p><p>Florida: 2992 </p><p>Maine: 1881 </p><p>Vermont: 1210 </p><p>These states all have the ~same elderly population, and yet there are huge variations in COVID death rates that line up 1:1 with partisan differences in vaccine uptake.</p></blockquote><p><span>But OK, fine, let’s do this properly. Let’s run a </span><a href="https://chicagounbound.uchicago.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1050&amp;context=law_and_economics" rel="">regression analysis</a><span>, which is a technique to decompose the effect of different variables.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="maincontent"><p><span><span>S</span></span>hades? SPF50 suncream? Wide-brimmed hat? For decades, it has been drilled into us that if the sun is out, we’d better slip on protective clothing, slop on suncream and slap on a hat to stay safe. There’s little doubt that too much sun exposure – and particularly sunburn – increases our risk of developing skin cancer. It also prematurely ages the skin. But scientists are increasingly questioning the mantra that sunlight is an evil to be avoided at all costs, and investigating the brighter side of sun exposure.</p><p>It’s not just about vitamin D. Though important for strong bones and teeth this sun-induced vitamin is just the tip of the iceberg in terms of the physiological processes that are influenced by sunlight falling on the skin. Sunseekers may even have a longer lifespan. So, can we capitalise on the benefits of sunshine, without risking skin cancer?</p><p>As daytime creatures living on a sunny planet, we shouldn’t be surprised that our bodies may have evolved ways of turning the sun’s energy to our advantage. The skin is our largest organ and it is packed with sun-responsive chemicals and machinery, the most obvious being melanin – the pigment that gives skin its colour.</p><p>People with darker skin start out with more melanin, but its production is also triggered by exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation in sunlight. Melanin absorbs some of these UV rays, helping to protect skin cells from DNA damage – although this protection is limited, and even dark skin tones can get sunburn and other forms of sun damage such as hyperpigmentation and skin ageing.</p><p>One way in which sunlight switches on melanin production is through the release of a substance called beta-endorphin, which also plays a role in stress relief and pain management. This could be one reason why many people find sitting in the sun so relaxing.</p><p>Of course, sunbathing is a double-edged sword. The first clues that sunlight might be associated with an increased risk of skin cancer came in the late 1920s, when a British researcher called George Findlay observed that mice that were regularly irradiated with UV light developed tumours on their skin. Numerous studies have since shown that UV light triggers DNA mutations in skin cells which, left unchecked, could lead to skin cancer.</p><p>Puzzlingly though, despite facing an increased risk of skin cancer, people who are exposed to lots of sun appear to have longer <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/life-expectancy" data-link-name="in body link">life expectancies</a>, on average, than sun avoiders.</p><figure id="01e790e0-fee0-4ccc-bd14-df27460ca7a7" data-spacefinder-role="showcase" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement"><div id="img-2"><picture><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ebc1341c798ec0bc687f261f7dd65b2aa757f2ca/0_248_7330_4396/master/7330.jpg?width=880&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 1300px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 1300px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ebc1341c798ec0bc687f261f7dd65b2aa757f2ca/0_248_7330_4396/master/7330.jpg?width=880&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 1300px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ebc1341c798ec0bc687f261f7dd65b2aa757f2ca/0_248_7330_4396/master/7330.jpg?width=800&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 1140px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 1140px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ebc1341c798ec0bc687f261f7dd65b2aa757f2ca/0_248_7330_4396/master/7330.jpg?width=800&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 1140px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ebc1341c798ec0bc687f261f7dd65b2aa757f2ca/0_248_7330_4396/master/7330.jpg?width=640&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 980px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 980px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ebc1341c798ec0bc687f261f7dd65b2aa757f2ca/0_248_7330_4396/master/7330.jpg?width=640&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 980px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ebc1341c798ec0bc687f261f7dd65b2aa757f2ca/0_248_7330_4396/master/7330.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ebc1341c798ec0bc687f261f7dd65b2aa757f2ca/0_248_7330_4396/master/7330.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 660px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ebc1341c798ec0bc687f261f7dd65b2aa757f2ca/0_248_7330_4396/master/7330.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ebc1341c798ec0bc687f261f7dd65b2aa757f2ca/0_248_7330_4396/master/7330.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 480px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ebc1341c798ec0bc687f261f7dd65b2aa757f2ca/0_248_7330_4396/master/7330.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ebc1341c798ec0bc687f261f7dd65b2aa757f2ca/0_248_7330_4396/master/7330.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 320px)"><img alt="Good sun … is it time to reassess our relationship with exposure?" src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ebc1341c798ec0bc687f261f7dd65b2aa757f2ca/0_248_7330_4396/master/7330.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" width="445" height="266.8785811732606" loading="lazy"></picture></div><figcaption><span><svg width="18" height="13" viewBox="0 0 18 13"><path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"></path></svg></span><span>Good sun … is it time to reassess our relationship with exposure?</span> Photograph: Donald34/Getty Images/iStockphoto</figcaption></figure><p>This counterintuitive connection first came to light in 2014, when a Swedish researcher called Pelle Lindqvist published the results of a large <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/joim.12251" data-link-name="in body link">study that followed the health of around 30,000 women</a> over 20 years. It found that, on average, women who spent more time in the sun lived for one to two years longer than those who avoided the sun, even after taking into account factors such as wealth, education and exercise. This increased life expectancy appeared to stem from lower rates of cardiovascular disease and other non-cancer-related illnesses, including type 2 diabetes, autoimmune disease and chronic lung disease.</p><p>Other studies have since identified a similar pattern, including among pale-skinned Britons. In July, Richard Weller at the University of Edinburgh and his colleagues published a <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.07.11.23292360v1.full.pdf" data-link-name="in body link">preprint analysis</a> which drew on data from 376,729 people with white ancestry who were enrolled in the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2012/mar/30/uk-biobank-medical-records-britons-online" data-link-name="in body link">UK Biobank Study</a> – an enormous online database of medical and lifestyle records – whose health was followed for an average of 13 years.</p><p>It found that those with more active sun-seeking behaviour were 14% less likely to die from any cause during the study period compared to sun avoiders, and their risk of death from cardiovascular disease was 19% lower.</p><p>Overall, more active sunseekers had around 50 extra days of survival, on average, while participants living in southern parts of the UK lived an 16 extra days, compared to those living 300 km farther north – even after adjusting for factors such as socioeconomic status.</p><p>“You might think that 50 days’ extra lifespan isn’t much, but at a population level, that’s huge,” Weller says. “Basically, after correcting for all the confounders, in Britain – just like in Sweden – the more sunlight people have, the longer they live.”</p><p>Curiously, active sunseekers’ risk of dying from cancer, including skin cancers, was also 14% lower. Weller says a similar pattern has been seen in other studies too. “We know that when melanoma is diagnosed, people with higher measured vitamin D levels have a <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5627529/" data-link-name="in body link">better prognosis</a>,” he says.</p><p>Vitamin D is manufactured in our bodies when the UVB rays in sunlight react with a chemical in the skin called 7-dehydrocholesterol. Bone and muscle cells use it to regulate levels of calcium and phosphorus, which are needed to keep them strong and healthy, while immune cells also use it to help fend off harmful microbes and promote wound repair. Vitamin D receptors are also found on other body tissues including the heart and brain, and in recent years the list of illnesses associated with vitamin D deficiency has grown to include cardiovascular disease, infections and cancer.</p><p>Surprisingly though, large long-term trials assessing the impact of taking daily vitamin D supplements to prevent these conditions have produced <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37483080/" data-link-name="in body link">mixed results</a>, prompting some researchers to question whether they may have been looking at this from the wrong perspective. “Your vitamin D level is a biomarker that you have been in the sun, but it is not necessarily the active agent involved in human disease pathogenesis,” says Prof Prue Hart at the Telethon Kids Institute in Perth, Australia.</p><p>Hart is one of those investigating whether the sun’s UV rays are affecting our health in additional ways. Besides triggering DNA damage in our skin cells, another reason why excessive sun exposure may increase the risk of skin cancer is because because it dampens the activity of immune cells that would usually detect damaged cells and destroy them.</p><p>Yet some immune dampening may be beneficial, helping to temper overactive immune responses. Possibly, our immune systems even have evolved with this mildly immune-suppressive input from sunlight wired in. Now that we spend the majority of our lives indoors, this system may have fallen out of balance, increasing the risk of autoimmune disease.</p><p>Take multiple sclerosis, which is caused by the immune system mistakenly attacking the brain and nerves. Numerous epidemiological studies have associated higher lifetime exposures to sunlight with a lower risk of developing the condition.</p><p>Hart is now investigating whether exposing people with the earliest form of MS to UVB rays could halt or delay its progression. A pilot <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5954316/" data-link-name="in body link">study</a> in 20 individuals suggested that a year after undergoing such phototherapy, seven out of 10 people had developed MS, compared to all 10 of those who did not receive the treatment. Further experiments also revealed significant differences in their blood immune cell profiles – particularly their antibody-producing B cells.</p><figure id="2d70df4f-e83b-4271-97e0-ccb0d97c92a8" data-spacefinder-role="showcase" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement"><div id="img-3"><picture><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/43a2e5b77d56c9429cfd3b992f1d87ef2f61c98f/0_0_5017_3345/master/5017.jpg?width=880&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 1300px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 1300px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/43a2e5b77d56c9429cfd3b992f1d87ef2f61c98f/0_0_5017_3345/master/5017.jpg?width=880&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 1300px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/43a2e5b77d56c9429cfd3b992f1d87ef2f61c98f/0_0_5017_3345/master/5017.jpg?width=800&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 1140px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 1140px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/43a2e5b77d56c9429cfd3b992f1d87ef2f61c98f/0_0_5017_3345/master/5017.jpg?width=800&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 1140px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/43a2e5b77d56c9429cfd3b992f1d87ef2f61c98f/0_0_5017_3345/master/5017.jpg?width=640&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 980px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 980px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/43a2e5b77d56c9429cfd3b992f1d87ef2f61c98f/0_0_5017_3345/master/5017.jpg?width=640&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 980px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/43a2e5b77d56c9429cfd3b992f1d87ef2f61c98f/0_0_5017_3345/master/5017.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/43a2e5b77d56c9429cfd3b992f1d87ef2f61c98f/0_0_5017_3345/master/5017.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 660px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/43a2e5b77d56c9429cfd3b992f1d87ef2f61c98f/0_0_5017_3345/master/5017.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/43a2e5b77d56c9429cfd3b992f1d87ef2f61c98f/0_0_5017_3345/master/5017.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 480px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/43a2e5b77d56c9429cfd3b992f1d87ef2f61c98f/0_0_5017_3345/master/5017.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/43a2e5b77d56c9429cfd3b992f1d87ef2f61c98f/0_0_5017_3345/master/5017.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 320px)"><img alt="It is almost impossible to recommend specific amounts of “safe” sun exposure because everyone’s skin is different." src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/43a2e5b77d56c9429cfd3b992f1d87ef2f61c98f/0_0_5017_3345/master/5017.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" width="445" height="296.69623280845127" loading="lazy"></picture></div><figcaption><span><svg width="18" height="13" viewBox="0 0 18 13"><path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"></path></svg></span><span>It is almost impossible to recommend specific amounts of “safe” sun exposure because everyone’s skin is different.</span> Photograph: WideWorld/Alamy</figcaption></figure><p>Other mechanisms may also be at play. Like many dermatologists, Weller started his career believing sunlight was inherently damaging. But about 15 years ago, he discovered large stockpiles of <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022202X15342780" data-link-name="in body link">nitric oxide</a> – a potent dilator of blood vessels – in human skin. Further research revealed that these stockpiles were activated by UVA rays, and that exposing individuals to a dose of UVA equivalent to spending about 20 minutes outdoors at noon during British summer time, resulted in a temporary, but significant drop in blood pressure.</p><p>Meanwhile, recent research by Prof Carmit Levy, at Tel Aviv University in Israel, found that sun exposure prompted the release of the “hunger hormone”<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/jul/11/sunlight-may-trigger-hormone-that-makes-men-hungrier-study-suggests" data-link-name="in body link"> ghrelin</a> in men’s skin. Here, the trigger appeared to be DNA damage. Besides regulating appetite, ghrelin also helps to reduce inflammation and blood pressure, so this could be another mechanism through which sun exposure exposure influences cardiovascular disease risk.</p><p>As evidence mounts for these potentially beneficial effects of sunlight, so do calls for a rethink of public health advice on how best to stay safe in the sun. In 2020, Weller, Hart, Lindqvist and 12 other researchers published a review in the <a href="https://aspe.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/private/pdf/264476/74-Sunshine-Health-Foundation-IQ-Appeal.pdf" data-link-name="in body link">International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health</a>, alerting doctors and policymakers to the “significant public health problem of insufficient sun exposure”.</p><p>While they don’t dispute that UV exposure is a major cause of skin cancer, they believe the “Slip, Slap, Slop” approach to sun avoidance – originally advocated by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/cancer" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag">Cancer</a> Council Australia, but now broadly adopted in other countries – may be damaging the health of people living in high-latitude countries such as the UK.</p><p>“The ‘Slip, Slap, Slop’ guidance is appropriate for the descendents of white-skinned north Europeans living in high-UV environments such as Australia, where they have a lot of skin cancer. But it is not appropriate for white-skinned Brits here in Scotland, and it is absolutely inappropriate for dark-skinned Brits, who have made the reverse migration from Africa or India,” says Weller.</p><p>So, what to do? What almost everyone agrees on is that the amount of sun exposure needed to stay healthy is far lower than the amount that causes sunburn.</p><p>The problem with advocating even limited sun exposure is that many people find it difficult to moderate, and it is almost impossible to recommend specific amounts of “safe” sun exposure because everyone’s skin is different, says Michelle Baker, CEO of the <a href="https://www.melanoma-fund.co.uk/" data-link-name="in body link">Melanoma Fund</a>, a charity which raises awareness of sun protection in sport and outdoor recreation. The sun’s intensity also varies hour to hour, day to day, and latitude to latitude.</p><p>One approach is to <a href="https://www.uvindex.app/" data-link-name="in body link">check the UV index</a>, which tells us how strong the sun’s UV rays are and when we’re most at risk of burning. If it is 3 or above, you need to think about protecting your skin – particularly if you have light skin or lots of moles or freckles, or a personal or family history of skin cancer.</p><p>Dr Walayat Hussain of the British Association of Dermatologists said: ‘[We] recommend that people avoid sunburn and heavy tanning, as these increase your chance of skin cancer. You don’t have to avoid the sun all year, but a few steps when out in the sunshine – whether this be in the UK or abroad on holiday – will help protect you. These steps include: protecting your skin with clothing, spending time in the shade when the UV index is high – typically between 11am and 3pm in the UK – and using sunscreen.” Baker stresses that using sunscreen will <em>not</em> make you vitamin D-deficient: “No matter how much you use or how high the SPF, some of the sun’s UV rays will reach your skin,” she says.</p><p>Weller also agrees that sunscreen is a sensible precaution. “Sunscreen is important because of the way we live our lives now, which is we get short, intense periods of sunlight on holiday, which is very unnatural,” he says. “Sunscreen definitely prevents skin ageing, and it prevents burning. It should be used for that – because that’s what matters.”</p><p>Even so, it may be time to move on from the idea that sun exposure is inherently bad. We still don’t know precisely what the optimal amount is – and it almost certainly varies from person to person – but what is becoming clear is that the effects of sun exposure are far greater than skin deep.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<a name="irish-logarithm" href="https://blog.plover.com/math/irish-logarithm.html">The Irish logarithm</a>
<br>
</p><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_logarithm">The Wikipedia article on “Irish logarithm”</a>
presents this rather weird little algorithm, invented by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percy_Ludgate">Percy
Ludgate</a>.  Suppose you want to multiply !!a!! and !!b!!,
where both are single-digit numbers !!0≤a,b≤9!!.</p>

<p>Normally you would just look it up on a multiplication table, but
please bear with me for a bit.</p>

<p>To use Ludgate's algorithm you need a different little table:</p>

<p>$$
\begin{array}{rl}
    T_1 = &amp;
    \begin{array}{cccccccccc}
           \tiny\color{gray}{0} &amp; \tiny\color{gray}{1} &amp; \tiny\color{gray}{2} &amp; \tiny\color{gray}{3} &amp; \tiny\color{gray}{4} &amp;  \tiny\color{gray}{5} &amp; \tiny\color{gray}{6} &amp;  \tiny\color{gray}{7} &amp; \tiny\color{gray}{8} &amp;  \tiny\color{gray}{9} \\ 
          50 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 7 &amp; 2 &amp; 23 &amp; 8 &amp; 33 &amp; 3 &amp; 14 \\
\end{array}
\end{array}
$$</p>

<p>and a different bigger one:</p>

<!-- table 1 -->

<p>$$
\begin{array}{rl}
    T_2 = &amp;
%   \left(
    \begin{array}{rrrrrrrrrrr}
    {\tiny\color{gray}{0}} &amp;    1, &amp; 2, &amp; 4, &amp; 8, &amp; 16, &amp; 32, &amp; 64, &amp; 3, &amp; 6, &amp; 12,   \\
    {\tiny\color{gray}{10}} &amp;   24, &amp; 48, &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 9, &amp; 18, &amp; 36, &amp; 72, &amp; 0, &amp; 0,   \\
    {\tiny\color{gray}{20}} &amp;   0, &amp; 27, &amp; 54, &amp; 5, &amp; 10, &amp; 20, &amp; 40, &amp; 0, &amp; 81, &amp; 0,   \\
    {\tiny\color{gray}{30}} &amp;   15, &amp; 30, &amp; 0, &amp; 7, &amp; 14, &amp; 28, &amp; 56, &amp; 45, &amp; 0, &amp; 0,   \\
    {\tiny\color{gray}{40}} &amp;   21, &amp; 42, &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 25, &amp; 63, &amp; 0, &amp; 0,   \\
    {\tiny\color{gray}{50}} &amp;   0, &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 35, &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 0,   \\
    {\tiny\color{gray}{60}} &amp;   0, &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 49\hphantom{,}
    \end{array}
%   \right)
\end{array}
$$</p>

<p>I've formatted !!T_2!! in rows for easier reading, but it's really
just a zero-indexed list
of !!101!! numbers.
So for example !!T_2(23)!! is !!5!!.</p>

<p>The tiny gray numbers in the margin are not part of the table, they
are counting the elements so that it is easy to find element !!23!!.</p>

<p>Ludgate's algorithm is simply:</p>

<p>$$
ab = T_2(T_1(a) + T_1(b))
$$</p>

<p>Let's see an example.
Say we want to multiply !!4×7!!.  We
first look up !!4!! and !!7!! in !!T_1!!, and get !!2!! and
!!33!!, which we add, getting !!35!!.  Then !!T_2(35)!!
is !!28!!, which is the correct answer.</p>

<p>This isn't useful for paper-and-pencil calculation, because it only
works for products up to !!9×9!!, and an ordinary multiplication table
is easier to use and remember.  But Ludgate invented this for use in a
mechanical computing engine, for which it is much better-suited.</p>

<p>The table lookups are mechanically very easy. They are simple
one-dimensional lookups: to find !!T_1(6)!! you just look at entry
!!6!! in the !!T_1!! table, which can be implemented as a series of
ten metal rods of different lengths, or something like that.  Looking
things up in a multiplication table is harder because it is two-dimensional.</p>

<p>The single addition in Ludgate's algorithm can also be performed
mechanically: to add !!T_1(a)!! and !!T_1(b)!!, you have some thingy
that slides up by !!T_1(a)!! units, and then by !!T_1(b)!!  more, and
then wherever it ends up is used to index into !!T_2!! to get the
answer.  The !!T_2!!  table doesn't have to be calculated on the fly,
it can be made up ahead of time, and machined from brass or something,
and incorporated directly into the machine.  (It's tempting to say
“hardcoded”.)</p>

<p>The tables look a little uncouth at first but it is not hard to figure
out what is going on. First off, !!T_1!! is the inverse of !!T_2!! in
the sense that $$T_2(T_1(n)) = n\tag{$\color{darkgreen}{\spadesuit}$}$$</p>

<p>whenever !!n!! is in range&nbsp;— that is when !!0≤ n ≤ 9!!.</p>

<p>!!T_2!! is more complex.  We must construct it so that</p>

<p>$$T_2(T_1(a) + T_1(b)) = ab.\tag{$\color{purple}{\clubsuit}$}$$</p>

<p>for all !!a!! and !!b!! of interest, which means that !!0\le a, b\le
9!!.</p>

<p>If you look over the table you should see that the entry !!n!! is
often followed by !!2n!!.   That is, !!T_2(i+1) = 2T_2(i)!!, at least
some of the time.  And in fact, this is true in all the cases we care
about, where !!2n = ab!! for some single digits !!a, b!!. </p>

<p>The second row could just as well have started with !!24, 48, 96,
192!!, but Ludgate doesn't need the !!96, 192!! entries, so he made
them zero, which really means “I don't care”.  This will be important
later.</p>

<p>The algorithm says that if
we want to
compute !!2n!!, we should compute
$$ \begin{align}
2n
 &amp; = T_2(T_1(2) + T_1(n)) &amp;&amp; \text{Because $\color{purple}{\clubsuit}$} \\
 &amp; = T_2(1 + T_1(n)) \\
 &amp; = 2T_2(T_1(n))         &amp;&amp; \text{Because moving one space right doubles the value}\\
 &amp; = 2n                   &amp;&amp; \text{Because $\color{darkgreen}{\spadesuit}$}
\end{align}
$$</p>

<p>when !!0≤n≤9!!.</p>

<p>I formatted !!T_2!! in rows of !!10!! because that makes it easy to
look up examples like !!T_2(35) = 28!!, and because that's how
Wikipedia did it.  But this is very misleading, and not just because
it makes !!T_2!!  appear to be a !!10×10!! table when it's really a
vector.  !!T_2!! is actually more like a compressed version of a
!!7×4×3×3!! table.</p>

<p>Let's reformat the table so that the rows have length !!7!! instead of !!10!!:</p>

<!-- table 2 -->

<p>$$
\begin{array}{rrrrrrrr}
    {\tiny\color{gray}{0}} &amp; 1, &amp; 2, &amp; 4, &amp; 8, &amp; 16, &amp; 32, &amp; 64,   \\
    {\tiny\color{gray}{7}} &amp; 3, &amp; 6, &amp; 12, &amp; 24, &amp; 48, &amp; 0, &amp; 0,   \\
    {\tiny\color{gray}{14}} &amp; 9, &amp; 18, &amp; 36, &amp; 72, &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 0,   \\
    {\tiny\color{gray}{21}} &amp; 27, &amp; 54, &amp; 5, &amp; 10, &amp; 20, &amp; 40, &amp; 0,   \\
    {\tiny\color{gray}{28}} &amp; 81, &amp; 0, &amp; 15, &amp; 30, &amp; 0, &amp; 7, &amp; 14,   \\
    {\tiny\color{gray}{35}} &amp; 28, &amp; 56, &amp; 45, &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 21, &amp; 42,   \\
    {\tiny\color{gray}{42}} &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 25, &amp; 63, &amp; 0,   \\
    {\tiny\color{gray}{49}} &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 0,   \\
    {\tiny\color{gray}{56}} &amp; 35, &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 0,   \\
    {\tiny\color{gray}{63}} &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 49 \\
\end{array}
$$</p>

<p>We have already seen that moving one column right usually multiplies
the entry by !!2!!.  Similarly, moving down by one row is seen to
triple the !!T_2!! value&nbsp;— not always, but in all the cases of
interest.  Since the rows have length !!7!!, moving down one row from
!!T_2(i)!! gets you to !!T_2(i+7)!!, and this is why !!T_1(3) = 7!!:
to compute !!3n!!, one does:</p>

<p>$$ \begin{align}
3n
 &amp; = T_2(T_1(3) + T_1(n)) &amp;&amp; \text{Because $\color{purple}{\clubsuit}$} \\
 &amp; = T_2(7 + T_1(n)) \\
 &amp; = 4T_2(T_1(n))         &amp;&amp; \text{Because moving down triples the value}\\
 &amp; = 3n                   &amp;&amp; \text{Because $\color{darkgreen}{\spadesuit}$}
\end{align}
$$</p>

<p>Now here is where it gets clever.  It would be straightforward easy to build !!T_2!!
as a stack of !!5×7!! tables, with each layer in the stack having
entries  quintuple the layer above, like this:</p>

<!-- table 3 -->

<p>$$
\begin{array}{rrrrrrrr}
    {\tiny\color{gray}{0}} &amp; 1, &amp; 2, &amp; 4, &amp; 8, &amp; 16, &amp; 32, &amp; 64,   \\
    {\tiny\color{gray}{7}} &amp; 3, &amp; 6, &amp; 12, &amp; 24, &amp; 48, &amp; 0, &amp; 0,   \\
    {\tiny\color{gray}{14}} &amp; 9, &amp; 18, &amp; 36, &amp; 72, &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 0,   \\
    {\tiny\color{gray}{21}} &amp; 27, &amp; 54, &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 0,   \\
    {\tiny\color{gray}{28}} &amp; 81, &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 0,   \\
    \\
    {\tiny\color{gray}{35}} &amp; 5, &amp; 10, &amp; 20, &amp; 40, &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 0,   \\
    {\tiny\color{gray}{42}} &amp; 15, &amp; 30, &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 0,   \\
    {\tiny\color{gray}{49}} &amp; 45, &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 0,   \\
    {\tiny\color{gray}{56}} &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 0,   \\
    {\tiny\color{gray}{63}} &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 0,   \\
    \\
    {\tiny\color{gray}{70}} &amp; 25, &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 0,   \\
    {\tiny\color{gray}{77}} &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 0,   \\
    {\tiny\color{gray}{84}} &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 0,   \\
    {\tiny\color{gray}{91}} &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 0,   \\
    {\tiny\color{gray}{98}} &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 0,   \\
\end{array}
$$</p>

<p>This works, if we make !!T_1(5)!! the correct offset, which is !!7·5 =
35!!.  But it wastes space, and the larger !!T_2!! is, the more
complicated and expensive is the brass thingy that encodes it.  The
last six entries of the each layer in the stack are don't-cares, so we
can just omit them:</p>

<!-- table 4 -->

<p>$$
\begin{array}{rrrrrrrr}
    {\tiny\color{gray}{0}} &amp; 1, &amp; 2, &amp; 4, &amp; 8, &amp; 16, &amp; 32, &amp; 64,   \\
    {\tiny\color{gray}{7}} &amp; 3, &amp; 6, &amp; 12, &amp; 24, &amp; 48, &amp; 0, &amp; 0,   \\
    {\tiny\color{gray}{14}} &amp; 9, &amp; 18, &amp; 36, &amp; 72, &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 0,   \\
    {\tiny\color{gray}{21}} &amp; 27, &amp; 54, &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 0,   \\
    {\tiny\color{gray}{28}} &amp; 81, \\
    \\
    {\tiny\color{gray}{29}} &amp; 5, &amp; 10, &amp; 20, &amp; 40, &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 0,   \\
    {\tiny\color{gray}{36}} &amp; 15, &amp; 30, &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 0,   \\
    {\tiny\color{gray}{43}} &amp; 45, &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 0,   \\
    {\tiny\color{gray}{50}} &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 0,   \\
    {\tiny\color{gray}{57}} &amp; 0, \\
    \\
    {\tiny\color{gray}{58}} &amp; 25, &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 0,   \\
    {\tiny\color{gray}{65}} &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 0,   \\
    {\tiny\color{gray}{72}} &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 0,   \\
    {\tiny\color{gray}{79}} &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 0, &amp; 0,   \\
    {\tiny\color{gray}{86}} &amp; 0\hphantom{,} \\
\end{array}
$$</p>

<p>And to compensate we make !!T_1(5) = 29!! instead of !!35!!: you now
move down one layer in the stack by skipping !!29!! entries forward, instead
of !!35!!.</p>

<p>The table is still missing all the multiples of !!7!!, but we can
repeat the process.  The previous version of !!T_2!! can now be
thought of as a !!29×3!!  table, and we can stack another !!29×3!!
table below it, with all the entries in the new layer being !!7!!
times the original one:</p>

<p>Each layer in the stack has !!29·3 = 87!! entries, so we could take
!!T_1(7) = 87!! and it would work, but the last !!28!! entries in
every layer are zero, so we can discard those and reduce the layers to
!!59!!  entries each. </p>

<p>Doing this has reduced the layers from !!87!! to !!59!! elements each,
but Ludgate has another trick up his sleeve.  The last few 
numbers in the top layer are !!45, 25,!! and a lot of zeroes. 
If he could somehow finesse !!45!! and !!25!!,
he could trim the top two layers all the way back to only 38 entries each:</p>

<p>We're now missing !!25!! and we need to put it back.
Fortunately the place we want to put it is 
!!T_1(5) + T_1(5) = 29+29 = 58!!, and that slot contains a zero
anyway.  And similarly we want to put !!45!! at position !!14+29 =
43!!, also empty:</p>

<p>The arithmetic pattern is no longer as obvious, but property !!\color{purple}{\clubsuit}!!
still holds</p>

<p>We're not done yet!  The table still has a lot of zeroes we can squeeze
out.  If we change !!T_1(5)!! from !!29!! to !!23!!, the
!!5,10,20,40!! group will slide backward to just after the !!54!!, and the !!15,
30!! will move to the row below that.</p>

<p>We will also have to move the
other multiples of !!5!!. The !!5!! itself moved back by six entries, and so
did everything after that in the table, including the !!35!! (from
position !!32+29!! to !!32+23!!) and the !!45!! (from position
!!14+29!! to !!14+23!!) so those are  still in the right
places.  Note that this means that !!7!! has moved from position
!!38!! to
position !!32!!, so we now have !!T_1(7) = 32!!.</p>

<p>But the !!25!! is giving us trouble.  It needed to move back twice
as far as the others, from !!29+29 = 58!! to !!23+23 = 46!!, and
unfortunately it now collides with !!63!! which is currently at position
!!7+7+32 = 46!!.</p>

<p>We need another tweak to fix !!25!!.  !!7!! is currently at
position !!32!!.  We can't move !!7!! any farther back to the left
without causing more collisions.  But we can move it <em>forward</em>, and if
we move it forward by one space, the !!63!! will move up one space also
and the collision with !!25!! will be solved.  So we insert a zero between
!!30!!  and !!7!!, which moves up !!7!! from position !!32!! to
!!33!!:</p>

$$</p>

<p>All the other multiples of !!7!! moved up by one space, but not the
non-multiples !!25!! and !!45!!.  Also !!49!! had to move up by two,
but that's no problem at all, since it was at the end of the table and
has all the space it needs.</p>

<p>And now we are done!  This is exactly Ludgate's table, which has the
property that</p>

<p>$$T_2(p + 7q + 23r + 33s) = 2^p3^q5^r7^s$$</p>

<p>whenever !!2^p3^q5^r7^s = ab!! for some !!0≤a,b≤9!!.
Moving right by one space multiplies the !!T_2!! entry
by !!2!!, at least for the entries we care about.  Moving right by
seven spaces multiplies the entry by !!3!!.  To multiply by !!5!! or
!!7!! we move right by or !!23!! or by !!33!!, respectively.</p>

<p>These are exactly the values in the !!T_1!! table:</p>

<p>$$\begin{align}
T_1(2) &amp; = 1\\
T_1(3) &amp; = 7\\
T_1(5) &amp; = 23\\
T_1(7) &amp; = 33
\end{align}$$</p>

<p>The rest of the !!T_1!! table can be obtained by remembering !!\color{darkgreen}{\spadesuit}!!,
that !!T_2(T_1(n)) = n!!, so for example !!T_1(6) = 8!! because
!!T_2(8) = 6!!.  Or we can get !!T_1(6)!! by multiplication, using !!\color{purple}{\clubsuit}!!:
multiplying by !!6!! is the same as multiplying by !!2!! and then by
!!3!!, which means you move right by !!1!! and then by !!7!!, for a
total of !!8!!.  Here's !!T_1!! again for reference:</p>

<p>$$
\begin{array}{rl}
    T_1 = &amp;
    \begin{array}{cccccccccc}
           0 &amp; 1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 &amp; 4 &amp;  5 &amp; 6 &amp;  7 &amp; 8 &amp;  9 \\ \hline
          50 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 7 &amp; 2 &amp; 23 &amp; 8 &amp; 33 &amp; 3 &amp; 14 \\
    \end{array}
\end{array}
$$</p>

<p>(Actually I left out a detail: !!T_1(0) = 50!!.
Ludgate wants !!T_2(T_1(0) + T_1(b)) = 0!! for all !!b!!. So
we need !!T_2(T_1(0) + k) = 0!! for each !!k!!  in !!T_1!!.
!!T_1(0) = 50!! is the smallest value that works.  This is rather
painful, because it means that 
the !!66!!-item table aboveis not sufficient.  Ludgate has to extend
!!T_2!! all the way out to !!101!!
items in order to handle the seemingly trivial case of !!0\cdot 0 =
T_2(50 + 50)!!.  But the last 35 entries are all zeroes, so the
the brass widget probably doesn't have to be too much more complicated.)</p>

<p>Wasn't that fun?  A sort of mathematical engineering or a kind that is
not been really useful for at least fifty years.</p>

<p>But actually that was not what I planned to write about!  (Did you
guess that was coming?)  I thought I was going to write this bit as a
brief introduction to something else,  but the brief introduction turned out
to be 2500 words and a dozen complicated tables.</p>

<p>We can only hope that part 2 is forthcoming.  I promise nothing.</p>

<p><strong>GNU/Linux is a free and open source software operating system for computers.</strong> The operating system is a collection of the basic instructions that tell the electronic parts of the computer what to do and how to work. Free, Libre and open source software (FLOSS) means that everyone has the freedom to use it, see how it works, and change it.</p>

<p>GNU/Linux is a collaborative effort between the GNU project, formed in 1983 to develop the GNU operating system and the development team of Linux, a kernel. Linux is also used without GNU in embedded systems, mobile phones, and more. These can include things like Android or ChromeOS. GNU itself is also used without Linux, some examples appear in projects like Debian/kFreebsd and Guix GNU/Hurd.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>For a pathogen to make us sick, it must overcome a lot. First it has to enter the body, bypassing natural barriers such as skin, mucus, cilia and stomach acid. Then it needs to reproduce; some bacteria and parasites can do this virtually anywhere in the body, while viruses and some other pathogens can only do so from within a cell. And all the while, it must parry attacks from the body’s immune system.</p>
<p>So while we are constantly inundated by microbes, the number of microbes that enter our bodies is usually too low to get past our defenses. (A tiny enough dose may even serve to remind our immune system of a pathogen’s existence, boosting our antibody response to keep us protected against it.)</p>
<p>When enough pathogens do manage to breach our defenses and start to replicate, we get sick. Often this is just a numbers game. The more invaders you’re fighting off, the more likely you are to feel ill.</p>

<h3><strong>How many microbes need to enter the body before we start to feel sick?</strong></h3>
<p>This varies by pathogen and is known as a microbe’s “infectious dose.” Usually it takes quite a few, but some microbes require an incredibly small number of organisms to start an infection. Take norovirus for example, the stomach bug notorious for spreading whenever people are in close contact and touch the same surfaces, such as on <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nceh/vsp/pub/norovirus/norovirus.htm">cruise ships</a>. Its infectious dose can be as small as <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1002/jmv.21237">18 individual viruses</a>, making it incredibly easy to transmit. It is also very hardy even outside the body, so an infected person who’s oozing the virus may leave a large amount of it behind — enough to easily infect others, even several days later.</p>
<h3><strong>What about the concept of “viral load”? Is that related? </strong></h3>
<p>They’re similar ideas, but while infectious dose refers to how many organisms will lead to an infection, viral load is an active measurement of infection: the number of organisms that are replicating within the host. The terminology was first introduced to the general public as part of our understanding of HIV/AIDS, and it increased in use after the start of the Covid pandemic.</p>
<h3><strong>How do researchers figure out a microbe’s infectious dose?</strong></h3>
<p>That’s still an inexact science. The gold-standard study, called a human challenge study, involves purposely giving people a dose of the pathogen. Unfortunately, this approach is <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5926904/">ethically difficult</a> since it (obviously) carries a risk of serious illness and potential long-term complications.</p>
<p>So instead, researchers expose guinea pigs, rats, mice or ferrets, depending on the pathogen. But it can be difficult to directly extrapolate animal dosage to the human equivalent.</p>
<p>Additionally, the route of infection matters. Something that gets right into your bloodstream will likely require far fewer microbes to take hold than one that comes in through your mouth or lungs, for example, since the bloodstream allows the pathogen to bypass many host defenses. This is why, for example, the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6195215/">risk of HIV infection</a> is much higher when it comes from a blood transfusion or needle stick versus a sexual route.</p>
<p>A third way of trying to figure out infectious dose is to use observational studies, where researchers deduce the number from seeing how long it takes for an exposed person (especially in families or other close-contact settings) to become sick. As you might suspect, this is often messy and inexact compared to the previous two methods.</p>
<h3><strong>Why are the infectious doses of some pathogens higher or lower than those of others? </strong></h3>
<p>We aren’t sure. It could be due to how an invader operates. Researchers have <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371/journal.ppat.0030147">suggested</a> that pathogens requiring direct contact with host cells tended to be more effective, so their infectious doses were fairly low. But if bacteria attack host cells indirectly (such as by secreting proteins that go on to harm host cells), then a larger dose of bacteria is necessary to infect the host, since the host-modifying secretions could be diluted by time and space. This idea was supported in a <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371/journal.ppat.1002512">2012 study</a> that looked at viruses, fungi and parasites as well. But we still need additional confirmation for a wider variety of microbes.</p>
<h3><strong>What do we know about the infectious dose for the virus that causes Covid? </strong></h3>
<p>We’ve learned a lot in the nearly four years since it first appeared, but much of it comes from animal models of infection and human observational studies. Most animal models require a high dose of the virus — 10,000 to 1 million “plaque-forming units” (PFUs), where each unit is enough to infect a cell in tissue culture and kill it. Observational studies in humans, however, suggest that the infectious dose <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9379270/">may be around 100 to 400 PFU</a> on average, though again this method offers only a very rough guideline.</p>
<p>These studies suggest that one reason the virus is so easily transmissible is because it has a relatively low infectious dose, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8082124/">similar to other respiratory viruses</a> such as RSV and “common cold” coronaviruses (and lower than the infectious dose of most strains of influenza virus).</p>
<p>And when we compare the infectious dose to the amount of virus exhaled by an infected individual, it’s not surprising that the virus spreads so quickly. A <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.09.06.23295138v1.full">recent preprint</a> shows that infected patients can exhale up to 800 viral RNA copies per minute for about eight days after their symptoms began. Even though we can’t directly translate RNA copies into the amount of live virus particles, if even half of those RNA copies are from a currently infectious virus, it’s theoretically possible to get a dose large enough to start an infection in just a minute of close contact.</p>
<h3><strong>Do vaccines raise the infectious dose?</strong></h3>
<p>When someone encounters a pathogen for the second time (whether because of a prior illness or vaccination), several host defenses spring into action. Antibodies generated from vaccination or prior infection will bind to the invading microbe. These will interfere with its ability to attach to a host cell, or single out the microbe for ingestion by cells called neutrophils. And if a virus does manage to invade a host cell, it will be targeted for destruction by memory T cells.</p>
<p>Due to this rapid response, fewer of the invading microbes survive compared to a naïve individual encountering the pathogen for the first time, which effectively raises infectious dose.</p>
<h3><strong>How can this knowledge help us avoid illnesses?</strong></h3>
<p>Exposure is a function of pathogen concentration and contact time, so if you can reduce either of those, you can better avoid infectious diseases.</p>
<p>This is why, from the start of the Covid pandemic, experts have recommended a <a href="https://www.rockefellerfoundation.org/video/layers-of-protection-against-covid-19-the-swiss-cheese-model/">“Swiss cheese” model</a> of layered protection, with social distancing from other individuals playing a key role. The farther you are from an infectious person, the fewer of their viral particles you will be exposed to. Adding a mask, especially a <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/types-of-masks.html">high-quality respirator such as an N95</a> with a snug fit, will further reduce the number of viruses you could inhale. Ventilation also dilutes the number of viral particles in the air, hence why being outside or using an air filter indoors lessens your risk of infection.</p>

<p>Vaccination is another way to decrease your risk of Covid infection. Though the vaccines are imperfect, vaccination still reduces your risk of <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10073587/">becoming infected in the first place</a>, by increasing the infectious dose necessary to initiate an infection. It also reduces the chances of <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanmic/article/PIIS2666-5247(23)00171-4/fulltext">developing serious illness</a> if you are infected. Several studies also suggest that vaccinated people are <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371/journal.ppat.1010802">less likely to shed as many virus particles</a> and that vaccination <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9991402/">reduces viral load</a>.</p>
<p>Masking, increased ventilation and distancing reduces the number of microbes you’re exposed to. Vaccination increases the infectious dose. These are the pillars of protection against infection from pretty much every pathogen. Transmission dynamics are complex, but the interventions we can take to protect ourselves are comparatively simple.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-id="page-content" data-og-area="article-blocks" id="incArticle"><p>When contemplating the <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/news/broken-emissions-testing-tools-ancient-laws-are-taking-a-toll-on-pa-mechanics" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">emissions</a> from road vehicles, our first thought is often about the various gases coming out of the tailpipe. However, new research shows that we should be more concerned with the harmful particles that are shed from <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/guides-and-gear/michelin-knows-exactly-when-your-tires-will-wear-out" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tires</a> and <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/features/how-brembo-makes-brakes-for-le-mans-f1-and-your-project-car" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">brakes</a>. </p><p>Scientists have a good understanding of engine emissions, which typically consist of unburnt fuel, oxides of carbon and nitrogen, and particulate matter related to combustion. However, new research shared by <em><a target="_blank" href="https://e360.yale.edu/features/tire-pollution-toxic-chemicals">Yale Environment 360</a></em> indicates that there may be a whole host of toxic chemicals being shed from tires and brakes that have been largely ignored until now. Even worse, these emissions may be so significant that they actually exceed those from a typical car's exhaust output. </p><p>A research paper published <a target="_blank" href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abd6951">in 2020</a> highlighted the impact of tire pollution by examining the plight of coho salmon in West Coast streams. Scientists eventually identified a chemical called 6PPD, typically used in tire manufacturing to slow cracking and degradation. When exposed to ozone in the atmosphere, the chemical transforms into multiple other species, including 6PPD-quinone—which was found to be highly toxic to multiple fish, including coho salmon. The same chemical has since been detected <a target="_blank" href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.estlett.2c00821">in human urine</a>, though any potential health impacts remain unknown.</p><p>The discovery of 6PPD-q and its impact has brought new scrutiny to the pollution generated by particles shedding from tires and brakes. In particular, tire rubber is made up of over 400 different chemical compounds, many of which are known to have negative effects on human health. </p><div data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="1" data-og-block-type="core/gallery"><figcaption data-rawhtml="1">Particulate emissions from tires—and, to a lesser extent, brakes—are becoming a new focus for researchers looking into automobile pollution.</figcaption></div><p>New research efforts are only just beginning to reveal the impact of near-invisible tire and brake dust. A <a target="_blank" href="https://www.systemiq.earth/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/BreakingThePlasticWave_MainReport.pdf">report</a> from the <em>Pew Charitable Trust</em> found that 78 percent of ocean microplastics are from synthetic tire rubber. These toxic particles often end up ingested by marine animals, where they can cause neurological effects, behavioral changes, and abnormal growth.  </p><p>Meanwhile, British firm Emissions Analytics spent three years studying tires. The group found that a single car's four tires collectively release 1 trillion "ultrafine" particles for every single kilometer (0.6 miles) driven.  These particles, under 100 nanometers in size, are so tiny that they can pass directly through the lungs and into the blood. They can even cross the body's blood-brain barrier. The Imperial College London has also studied <a href="https://spiral.imperial.ac.uk/bitstream/10044/1/101707/9/Tyre%20wear%20particles%20are%20toxic%20for%20us%20and%20the%20environment%200223-2.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the issue</a>, noting that "There is emerging evidence that tire wear particles and other particulate matter may contribute to a range of negative health impacts including heart, lung, developmental, reproductive, and cancer outcomes.”</p><p>It's an emissions problem that won't go away with the transition to EVs, either. According to data from Emissions Analytics, EVs tend to shed around 20 percent more from their tires due to their higher weight and high torque compared to traditional internal combustion engine-powered vehicles.</p><p>Indeed, the scale of these emissions is significant. Particulate emissions from tires and brakes, particularly in the PM2.5 and PM10 size ranges, are believed to exceed the mass of tailpipe emissions from modern vehicle fleets, as per a study published in<em> Science&nbsp;of the&nbsp;Total Environment</em> <a target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37088393/">this year.</a></p><p>This issue has largely flown under the radar until recently. Tailpipe emissions are easy to study, simply requiring the capture or sensing of gases directly at the engine's exhaust. Capturing the fine particulates emitted from tires and brakes is altogether more difficult. Doing so in a way that accurately reflects the quantity of those emissions is yet harder. Such pollution is perhaps unlikely to have a direct impact on issues like climate change, but the potential toxicity for humans, animals, and the broader environment is a prime concern. </p><p><a href="https://www.thedrive.com/article/15586/transportation-regulators-to-remove-unnecessary-barriers-to-self-driving-cars" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Regulators</a> are already scrambling to tackle this issue, heretofore largely ignored by governments around the world. In the EU, the Euro 7 standards will regulate tire and brake emissions from 2025. In the U.S., the California EPA will require tire manufacturers to find an alternative chemical to 6PPD by 2024, to help reduce 6PPD-q entering the environment going forward. In turn, manufacturers are exploring everything from alternate tire compositions to special electrostatic methods to capture particulate output.</p><p>Expect this issue to gain greater prominence in coming years as regulators have more accurate data to act upon. There is great scope to slash this form of pollution if we properly understand the impacts of our cars in full.</p><p><em>Got a tip?

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>As Wes Phillips recently <a href="https://www.stereophile.com/news/022808ndp/index.html">reported on this website</a>, CD sales are down and legal downloads of audio files are up. <i>Stereophile</i> has been criticized more than once for not paying enough attention to the subjects of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MP3">MP3</a> and other compressed file formats, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Audio_Coding">AAC</a>, and for offering no guidance <i>at all</i> to readers about how to get the best sound quality from compressed downloads.
</p><p>
These criticisms are correct. We don't.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.stereophile.com/images/archivesart/308mps.1.jpg" width="450" height="345">
</p><p>
The reason is simple: Although they are universally described in the mainstream press as being of "CD quality," MP3s and their lossy-compressed ilk do <i>not</i> offer sufficient audio quality for serious music listening. This is not true of lossless-compressed formats such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FLAC">FLAC</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Lossless">ALAC</a>, and WMA lossless—in fact, it was the release of iTunes 4.5, in late 2003, which allowed iPods to play lossless files, that led us to <a href="https://www.stereophile.com/mediaservers/934/index.html">welcome</a> the ubiquitous Apple player to the world of high-end audio. But <i>lossy</i> files achieve their conveniently small size by discarding too much of the music to be worth considering.
</p><p>
<a href="https://www.stereophile.com/asweseeit/56">In the past</a>, we have discussed at length the reasons for our dismissal of MP3 and other lossy formats, but recent articles in the mainstream press promoting MP3 (examined in Michael Fremer's "<a href="https://www.stereophile.com/thinkpieces/021708swiftboat/index.html">The Swiftboating of Audiophiles</a>") make the subject worth re-examining.
</p><p>
<b>Lossless <i>vs</i> Lossy</b>
<br>
The file containing a typical three-minute song on a CD is 30–40 megabytes in size. A 4-gigabyte iPod could therefore contain just 130 or so songs—say, only nine CDs' worth. To pack a useful number of songs onto the player's drive or into its memory, some kind of data compression needs to be used to reduce the size of the files. This will also usefully reduce the time it takes to download the song.
</p><p>
Lossless compression is benign in its effect on the music. It is akin to LHA or WinZip computer data crunchers in packing the data more efficiently on the disk, but the data you read out are the same as went in. The primary difference between lossless compression for computer data and for audio is that the latter permits random access within the file. (If you had to wait to unZip the complete 400MB file of a CD's content before you could play it, you would rapidly abandon the whole idea.) You can get reduction in file size to 40–60% of the original with lossless compression—the performance of various lossless codecs is compared <a href="http://members.home.nl/w.speek/comparison.htm">here</a> and <a href="http://flac.sourceforge.net/comparison.html">here</a>—but that increases the capacity of a 4GB iPod to only 300 songs, or 20 CDs' worth of music. More compression is necessary.
</p><p>
The MP3 <i>codec</i> (for COder/DECoder) was developed at the end of the 1980s and adopted as a standard in 1991. As typically used, it reduces the file size for an audio song by a factor of 10; <i>eg,</i> a song that takes up 30MB on a CD takes up only 3MB as an MP3 file. Not only does the 4GB iPod now hold well over 1000 songs, each song takes less than 10 seconds to download on a typical home's high-speed Internet connection.
</p><p>
But you don't get something for nothing. The MP3 codec, and others that achieve similar reductions in file size, are "lossy"; <i>ie</i>, of necessity they eliminate some of the musical information. The degree of this degradation depends on the data rate. Less bits always equals less music.
</p><p>
As a CD plays, the two channels of audio data (not including overhead) are pulled off the disc at a rate of just over 1400 kilobits per second. A typical MP3 plays at less than a tenth that rate, at 128kbps. To achieve that massive reduction in data, the MP3 coder splits the continuous musical waveform into discrete time chunks and, using Transform analysis, examines the spectral content of each chunk. Assumptions are made by the codec's designers, on the basis of psychoacoustic theory, about what information can be safely discarded. Quiet sounds with a similar spectrum to loud sounds in the same time window are discarded, as are quiet sounds that are immediately followed or preceded by loud sounds. And, as I wrote in the February 2008 "<a href="https://www.stereophile.com/content/cd-quality-where-did-music-go">As We See It</a>," because the music must be broken into chunks for the codec to do its work, transient information can get smeared across chunk boundaries.
</p><p>
Will the listener miss what has been removed? Will the smearing of transient information be large enough to mess with the music's meaning? As I wrote in a July 1994 <a href="https://www.stereophile.com/asweseeit/56/index.html">essay</a>, "if these algorithms have been properly implemented with the right psycho-acoustic assumptions, the musical information represented by the lost data will not be missed by most listeners.
</p><p>
"That's a mighty big 'if.'"
</p><p>
And while lossy codecs differ in the assumptions made by their designers, all of them discard—permanently—real musical information that would have been audible to some listeners with some kinds of music played through some systems. These codecs are not, in the jargon, "transparent," as can be demonstrated in <a href="https://www.stereophile.com/asweseeit/1007awsi/index.html">listening tests</a> (footnote 1).
</p><p>
So to us at <i>Stereophile</i>, the question of which lossy codec is "the best" is moot. We recommend that, for serious listening, our readers use uncompressed audio file formats, such as WAV or AIF—or, if file size is an issue because of limited hard-drive space, use a lossless format such as FLAC or ALC. These <i>will</i> be audibly transparent to all listeners at all times with all kinds of music through all systems.
</p><p>
<b>Putting Codecs to the Test</b>
<br>
Do I have any evidence for that emphatic statement?
</p><p>
For an <a href="https://www.stereophile.com/reference/456/index.html">article</a> published in the March 1995 issue of <i>Stereophile</i>, I measured the early PASC, DTS, and ATRAC lossy codecs and put four of the test signals used for that article on our <i>Test CD 3</i> (<a href="https://www.stereophile.com/features/424/index.html">Stereophile STPH006-2</a>). For the present article, I used two of those signals, tracks 25 and 26 on <i>Test CD 3</i>. But first, to set a basis for comparison, I used that most familiar of test signals: a 1kHz tone.
</p><p>
The spectrum of this tone, played back from CD, is shown in fig.1. The tone is the sharply defined vertical green line at the left of the graph. There are no other vertical lines present, meaning that the tone is completely free from distortion. Across the bottom of the graph, the fuzzy green trace shows that the background noise is uniformly spread out across the audioband, up to the 22kHz limit of the CD medium. This noise results from the 16-bit Linear Pulse Code Modulation (LPCM) encoding used by the CD medium. Each frequency component of the noise lies around 132dB below peak level; if these are added mathematically, they give the familiar 96dB signal/noise ratio that you see in CD-player specifications.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.stereophile.com/images/archivesart/308MP3fig01.jpg" width="450" height="308">
</p><p>
Fig.1 Spectrum of 1kHz sinewave at –10dBFS, 16-bit linear PCM encoding (linear frequency scale, 10dB/vertical div.).
</p><p>
Fig.2 shows the spectrum of this tone after it has been converted to an MP3 at a constant bit rate of 128kbps. (The MP3 codec I used for this and all the other tests was the Fraunhöfer, from one of the original developers of the MP3 technology.) The 1kHz tone is now represented by the dark red vertical line at the left of the graph. Note that it has acquired "skirts" below –80dB. These result, I believe, from the splitting of the continuous data representing the tone into the time chunks mentioned above, which in return results in a very slight uncertainty about the exact frequency of the tone. Note also that the random background noise has disappeared entirely. This is because the encoder is basically deaf to frequency regions that don't contain musical information. With its very limited "bit budget," the codec concentrates its resources on regions where there <i>is</i> audio information. However, a picket fence of very-low-level vertical lines can be seen. These represent spurious tones that result, I suspect, from mathematical limitations in the codec. Like the skirts that flank the 1kHz tone, these will not be audible. But they do reveal that the codec is working hard even with this most simple of signals.
</p><p>

</p><p>
Fig.2 Spectrum of 1kHz sinewave at –10dBFS, MP3 encoding at 128kbps (linear frequency scale, 10dB/vertical div.).
</p><p>
But what about when the codec is dealing not with a simple tone, but with music? One of the signals I put on <i>Test CD 3</i> (track 25) simulates a musical signal by combining 43 discrete tones with frequencies spaced 500Hz apart. The lowest has a frequency of 350Hz, the highest 21.35kHz. This track sounds like a swarm of bees, but more important for a test signal, it readily reveals shortcomings in codecs, as spuriae appear in the spectral gaps between the tones..

If you were to examine the Universe solely with what’s perceptible to your eyes, you’d miss out on a whole slew of information that exists in wavelengths of light that are invisible to us. From the highest-energy gamma rays to the lowest-energy radio waves, the electromagnetic spectrum is enormous, with visible light representing just a tiny sliver of what’s out there. At shorter wavelengths and higher energies, gamma rays, X-rays, and ultraviolet light are all present, while at longer wavelengths and lower energies, infrared, microwave, and radio light encodes a wide variety of information about what various astrophysical sources are doing.</p><p>However, there’s an entirely different method to measure the Universe: to collect actual particles and antiparticles, a science known as cosmic ray astronomy. For more than a decade, astronomers have seen a signal of cosmic ray positrons — the antimatter counterpart of the electron — that they’ve struggled to explain. Could it be humanity’s best clue toward solving the dark matter mystery?

While the true nature of dark matter will remain a mystery until the particle (or at least one of the particles) responsible is detected directly, many dark matter scenarios exist where not only is dark matter its own antiparticle, but that dark matter annihilations will also produce electron-positron pairs. As long as your dark matter particle is massive enough so that electron-positron pairs can be generated from the energy released when dark matter particles annihilate, this type of antimatter ought to be generated under some conditions.</p><p>So how do we decide: dark matter or “mundane” physics? Which one is responsible for blowing these “Fermi bubbles” in our galaxy?</p><p>Whenever you have multiple possible physical explanations for what could cause an observable phenomenon, the key to telling which one matches reality is to tease out differences between the explanations. In particular, positrons due to dark matter should experience a cutoff at specific energies (corresponding to the mass of the dark matter particles), while positrons generated by conventional astrophysics should fall off more gradually. In other words, looking at the energy spectrum of these positrons, directly, should tell us what the answer is.</p><!--?xml encoding="utf-8" ?--><figure><img data-lazy-fallback="1" decoding="async" width="3760" height="2848" src="https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/ams_20140918.jpg?w=3760" alt="Nasa space station in space with alpha magnetic spectrometer" sizes="(max-width: 767px) 96vw, (max-width: 1280px) 60vw, (max-width: 1536px) 46vw, 710px" srcset="https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/ams_20140918.jpg 3760w, https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/ams_20140918.jpg?resize=1536,1163 1536w, https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/ams_20140918.jpg?resize=2048,1551 2048w, https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/ams_20140918.jpg?resize=375,284 375w, https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/ams_20140918.jpg?resize=640,485 640w, https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/ams_20140918.jpg?resize=768,582 768w, https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/ams_20140918.jpg?resize=1024,776 1024w, https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/ams_20140918.jpg?resize=1280,970 1280w" data-lazy-srcset="https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/ams_20140918.jpg 3760w, https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/ams_20140918.jpg?resize=1536,1163 1536w, https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/ams_20140918.jpg?resize=2048,1551 2048w, https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/ams_20140918.jpg?resize=375,284 375w, https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/ams_20140918.jpg?resize=640,485 640w, https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/ams_20140918.jpg?resize=768,582 768w, https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/ams_20140918.jpg?resize=1024,776 1024w, https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/ams_20140918.jpg?resize=1280,970 1280w" data-lazy-src="https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/ams_20140918.jpg?w=3760&amp;is-pending-load=1" data-old-srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"><div><div><p>Exterior view of the ISS with the alpha magnetic spectrometer (AMS-02) visible in the foreground.

After arriving at the International Space Station aboard the final mission of the Space Shuttle Endeavor, it was quickly set up and began sending data back to Earth within 3 days. During its operational phase, it collected and measured more than ten billion cosmic ray particles per year. Although only a tiny fraction of them were positrons, that’s okay; because of the different energy, charge, and charge-to-mass ratios of the different particles that impacted it, different species of particle could be separated out.</p><p>What’s remarkable about AMS-02 is the “magnetic” part of the experiment: magnetic fields bend charge particles, and while the magnetic force on a moving charged particle depends only on its electric charge and velocity, the amount that a particle “bends by” as it passes through the detector is also dependent on the incoming particle’s mass and momentum. This makes AMS-02 able to sort these cosmic rays both by type and by energy, providing us with an unprecedented set of data to evaluate whether the positrons appeared to be due to dark matter or not.

We know there are mysteries about our Universe that require new physics at some level — mysteries like dark matter, dark energy, or the cosmic matter-antimatter asymmetry — whose ultimate solution has yet to be discovered. It’s an important reminder that all of the known physics at play in the Universe cannot represent all of what’s truly out there; there still remain deep, fundamental mysteries whose solutions are not presently known.</p><p>However, we cannot claim evidence for a new discovery until we first scrupulously and quantitatively account for everything that represents the physics and astrophysics of what’s already known. By factoring in the effect of pulsars, the positron excess observed by the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer collaboration appears to be explicable entirely by conventional high-energy astrophysics, with no need for dark matter. Right now, our observations are consistent with the notion that pulsars are responsible for 100% of the observed excess, requiring scientists to go back to the drawing board for a direct signal that reveals our Universe’s elusive dark matter. The Milky Way’s antimatter, despite what many had hoped for, appears to be entirely due to pulsars.</p> </div></div>]]></description>

This can power up the tiny pedal-powered generator contained in the portable charger.</p>
<p>The electricity generated in the process is then stored in MyPowerbank's internal batteries, with around 25 minutes of pedalling equating to one full phone charge.</p>

<p>This can restrict their access to crucial digital services, from texting and banking to applying for benefit schemes.</p>

<p>"Every facet of our daily life revolves around the convenience of what a phone can do for us, from Google Maps to transferring money to messaging our friends, which keeps us sane," he continued. "They're just so life-or-death crucial."</p>
<p>The project was born out of Talbot's research into how urban infrastructure, often designed to make life hard for homeless people, could be hacked for their benefit.</p>
<p>In particular, his design was inspired by the <a href="http://www.michaelrakowitz.com/parasite">blow-up homeless shelters of American artist Michael Rakowitz</a>, which are inflated using buildings' hot air vents.</p>
<p>"I really fell in love with this idea of having this city that was designed against a certain group of people to segregate them socially, taking what the city gives away for free and using it against itself," he explained.</p>

<p>A small gear at the back of the device is designed to slot onto the bike's chain, while an internal magnet clips onto the metal frame.</p>
<p>"The chain spins that gear, the gear spins the dynamo and the dynamo charges the two lithium-ion batteries inside," Talbot said. "The thing I like about it is that it's not new fancy tech, it's actually really old tech that's been reformatted for a new purpose."</p>

<p>He built the dynamo from scratch using a Youtube tutorial and the two batteries, which each hold up to four full charges, are reclaimed from old powerbanks.</p>
<p>After being named one of the winners at this year's <a href="https://www.mullenlowenova.com/">MullenLowe NOVA Awards</a>, Talbot is now using his prize money to help make the design production-ready and cut down on the pedalling time needed per charge.</p>

<p>"Hopefully there'll be a circular repair system behind that so if it's broken, they could give it back to the shelter and the shelter would send it back to whoever ends up running it," Talbot said.</p>
