    <p>The <strong>European Union Council</strong> has once again retreated from its controversial <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2025/09/chat-control-back-menu-eu-it-still-must-be-stopped-0">Chat Control proposal</a>, a plan that would have required widespread scanning of encrypted messages. The withdrawal by the current <strong>Danish presidency</strong> represents yet another chapter in a long-running battle between privacy advocates and lawmakers who believe they can compromise encryption in the name of public safety. While this latest defeat is a victory for digital rights, the fight is far from over, and the <em>fundamental misunderstanding of encryption technology</em> continues to plague policy discussions across Europe.</p>

<h2 id="a-zombie-proposal-that-refuses-to-die">A zombie proposal that refuses to die</h2>

<p>Since its introduction in 2022, Chat Control has become what privacy advocates call a <em>zombie proposal</em>, repeatedly resurrected despite consistent opposition from civil society, technical experts, and the public. The <strong>Electronic Frontier Foundation</strong> and <a href="https://www.globalencryption.org/2024/05/joint-statement-on-the-dangers-of-the-may-2024-council-of-the-eu-compromise-proposal-on-eu-csam/">more than 80 civil society organizations</a> have strongly opposed the legislation, which would mandate client-side scanning of encrypted communications under the guise of combating child sexual abuse material.</p>

<p>The pattern has become predictable. EU lawmakers introduce the proposal, claiming it includes safeguards for privacy. Technical experts explain why those safeguards are illusory. Public pressure mounts. The proposal is withdrawn or modified. Then, after a brief hiatus, it returns with minor tweaks, and the cycle begins anew. This latest withdrawal by the <strong>Danish presidency</strong> follows the same script, but the underlying issues remain unresolved.</p>

<p>What makes this particularly frustrating is that the fundamental problem with Chat Control has never been addressed. The proposal seeks to create what privacy experts call a ‚Äúbackdoor‚Äù into encryption, allowing authorities to scan messages before they‚Äôre encrypted or after they‚Äôre decrypted. Proponents argue this preserves encryption while enabling content moderation, but this reveals a <em>dangerous misunderstanding</em> of how encryption actually works. Creating any mechanism to access encrypted content inherently weakens the entire system, making it vulnerable not just to authorized access but to malicious actors as well.</p>

<h2 id="the-technical-impossibility-of-safe-scanning">The technical impossibility of ‚Äúsafe‚Äù scanning</h2>

<p>The core issue with Chat Control and similar proposals lies in a fundamental misunderstanding of encryption technology. End-to-end encryption works because only the sender and recipient possess the keys to decrypt messages. Any third party, whether a government agency or a tech company, cannot read the contents. This is not a design choice but a mathematical certainty that ensures the security of billions of communications daily.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/11/why-adding-client-side-scanning-breaks-end-end-encryption">Client-side scanning</a>, the technical approach favored by Chat Control advocates, attempts to circumvent this limitation by analyzing messages on users‚Äô devices before encryption or after decryption. While this might sound like a clever workaround, it fundamentally breaks the security model of encryption. If a device can scan and report on message content, so can malware, hackers, or authoritarian governments who might compel tech companies to expand the scope of scanning.</p>

<p>Security researchers have repeatedly demonstrated that there is <em>no way to create a scanning system</em> that only works for ‚Äúgood guys.‚Äù <strong>Apple</strong> learned this lesson the hard way in 2021 when it proposed a similar system for detecting child abuse imagery in iCloud photos. The backlash from security experts was swift and devastating, forcing the company to abandon the plan. The same security vulnerabilities that would enable Chat Control would inevitably be exploited by malicious actors, putting everyone at greater risk.</p>

<p>Moreover, the scope creep inherent in surveillance technologies is well documented. A system initially designed to detect illegal content could easily be expanded to monitor political dissent, religious expression, or any other communication governments deem problematic. <strong>Countries around the world</strong> are watching the EU‚Äôs actions closely. If Chat Control were to pass, it would set a dangerous precedent that authoritarian regimes would eagerly exploit, claiming they‚Äôre simply following Europe‚Äôs lead in implementing ‚Äúreasonable‚Äù content moderation.</p>

<h2 id="public-pressure-and-the-power-of-resistance">Public pressure and the power of resistance</h2>

<p>The withdrawal of Chat Control demonstrates the <em>critical importance of sustained public engagement</em> in technology policy. Unlike previous instances where technical proposals sailed through legislative processes with little public awareness, this fight has been characterized by unprecedented mobilization from civil society organizations, technology companies, security researchers, and ordinary citizens concerned about their digital rights.</p>

<p>Organizations like the <strong>Electronic Frontier Foundation</strong>, <strong>European Digital Rights</strong>, and numerous national privacy advocacy groups have played a crucial role in educating the public about the risks of Chat Control. Their efforts have included detailed technical explanations, legal analysis, and coordination of opposition campaigns that have reached millions of Europeans. This groundswell of opposition has made it politically toxic for lawmakers to support the proposal, at least in its current form.</p>

<p>The effectiveness of this resistance offers important lessons for future policy battles. First, technical expertise matters. When security researchers speak with a unified voice about the impossibility of safe backdoors, it becomes harder for politicians to dismiss concerns as alarmist. Second, coalition-building across different sectors strengthens opposition. When <a href="https://edri.org/our-work/chat-control-what-is-actually-going-on/">civil liberties groups</a>, tech companies, and individual users all oppose a policy, it suggests the problems are real and widespread. Third, sustained pressure is essential because, as Chat Control demonstrates, bad proposals rarely die on the first attempt.</p>

<p>However, this victory should be tempered with realism. The forces pushing for Chat Control have not given up, and the underlying political dynamics that gave rise to the proposal remain unchanged. Politicians face genuine pressure to be seen as ‚Äúdoing something‚Äù about online harms, particularly regarding child safety. Until alternative approaches that don‚Äôt compromise encryption gain political traction, proposals like Chat Control will continue to resurface.</p>

<h2 id="the-path-forward-requires-education-and-alternatives">The path forward requires education and alternatives</h2>

<p>The repeated resurrection of Chat Control points to a deeper problem in how technology policy is made. Many lawmakers genuinely believe they can have both strong encryption and government access to encrypted content. This belief persists despite unanimous opposition from the cryptographic community because the political incentives favor appearing tough on crime over understanding complex technical realities.</p>

<p>Breaking this cycle requires a <em>fundamental shift in how we approach online safety</em>. Rather than seeking technological magic bullets that promise security without trade-offs, policymakers need to invest in solutions that actually work. This includes better funding for law enforcement training and tools that don‚Äôt require breaking encryption, improved international cooperation on criminal investigations, and addressing the root causes of online exploitation through social programs and education.</p>

<p><strong>Technology companies</strong> also bear responsibility for developing and promoting genuinely privacy-preserving safety features. End-to-end encrypted platforms can implement abuse prevention measures that don‚Äôt involve content scanning, such as metadata analysis, user reporting systems, and account-level restrictions for suspicious behavior. While these approaches may be less comprehensive than mass surveillance, they achieve meaningful safety improvements without the catastrophic privacy trade-offs of backdoors.</p>

<p>Looking ahead, the privacy community cannot simply celebrate the withdrawal of Chat Control and move on. The next presidency of the EU Council will bring new opportunities for the proposal to resurface in yet another modified form. Sustained vigilance, continued public education, and proactive development of alternative safety measures will be essential. The fight to protect encryption is not a single battle but an ongoing campaign that requires long-term commitment from everyone who values digital privacy and security.</p>

<p>The withdrawal of Chat Control is a victory, but it‚Äôs a temporary one. The fundamental challenge remains: convincing policymakers that some trade-offs are not worth making, and that breaking encryption to combat illegal content creates far more problems than it solves. Until that message truly sinks in, the zombie proposal will keep rising from the grave, and the privacy community must remain ready to defeat it again and again.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/1oj52xx/tech_companies_are_firing_everyone_to_fund_ai_but/">https://old.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/1oj52xx/tech_companies_are_firing_everyone_to_fund_ai_but/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45782267">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>So, Amazon announced they're laying off 30k people. This is set to be the largest layoff in the company‚Äôs history. That's on top of Microsoft cutting 15k, Meta cutting 3.6k and Google cutting hundreds this year. Over 180,000 tech workers laid off in 2025 alone.</p>

<p>But here's what nobody's connecting and it's actually insane when you connect all the dots. These same companies are spending over $300 billion on AI this year. So they're firing people to "free up capital for AI investments." Then spending that money buying stuff from each other. And none of it's making them money yet.</p>

<p>Let me break down what's actually happening:</p>

<p>Layoff is just an excuse - Every company's using the same line. "We're restructuring for AI." "AI will handle these tasks now." "We need to fund AI initiatives."</p>

<p>Zuckerberg said AI could be ready this year to "effectively be a sort of mid-level engineer capable of writing code.", Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said "we will need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today.", Salesforce laid off 4,000 customer support staff and their CEO literally said it was because of "increasing AI adoption.", IBM cut 8,000 jobs in HR because "AI tools take over routine administrative tasks."</p>

<p>So the story is AI's now capable of doing these jobs right? That's why they gotta fire everyone. Except the thing is - They're not saving that money. They're spending way more than they're saving.</p>

<p>and <strong>where the money is really going?</strong> They're buying from each other - </p>

<ul>
<li>Microsoft buys Nvidia chips. Rents cloud capacity from Amazon AWS. Buys software from other companies. </li>
<li>Amazon buys Nvidia chips. Uses Microsoft software. Rents capacity they can't build fast enough.</li>
<li>Meta buys Nvidia chips. Rents infrastructure from Google Cloud and AWS</li>
<li>Apple doesn't even build AI infrastructure. They rent everything from Google AWS and Azure. So Apple pays Google. Google pays Nvidia. Nvidia pays TSMC for manufacturing. Microsoft pays Amazon. Amazon pays Microsoft. Meta pays everyone.</li>
</ul>

<p>They're literally just passing money in circles. The "Magnificent 7" stocks/companies Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta and Tesla, have a combined market cap of $17 trillion. For reference US GDP is $30 trillion. But their combined revenue in 2024? $2.2 trillion. Net profit? around $550 billion.</p>

<p>They're trading at an average P/E ratio of 35. That means investors are paying $35 for every $1 of profit. The S&amp;P 500 without them? P/E of 15.5. Why the premium? Because everyone believes AI is going to make them wildly profitable in the future.</p>

<p>But right now they're just spending money. On each other. Creating the illusion of growth.</p>

<p>But here's the trap. These companies CAN'T stop now. Because if any of them stops their stock crashes. Investors think they're giving up on AI and falling behind. So they're locked in an arms race. Have to keep spending to maintain stock prices even if the spending doesn't generate returns.</p>

<p>Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet Meta increased capex by 42% in 2024. Planning another 17% increase in 2025. $244 billion total spend next year across just those 4.</p>

<p>and it's going to Mostly Nvidia. Who uses it to buy manufacturing from TSMC. Who uses it to buy equipment from ASML. Money moving in circles.</p>

<p><strong>Connecting the dots</strong></p>

<p>So let me spell this out. These companies are:</p>

<ol>
<li>Laying off hundreds of thousands of workers to "fund AI"</li>
<li>Spending way more on AI than they're saving from layoffs</li>
<li>Buying most of that AI infrastructure from each other</li>
<li>Not making any actual profit from AI yet</li>
<li>Can't stop spending or their stocks crash</li>
<li>Creating the illusion of economic growth through spending alone</li>
</ol>

<p>So when you hear "stock market hit a new record" that means these 7 companies went up. The other 493? They contributed 46%. And why did these 7 go up? Because they're spending hundreds of billions on AI. Which inflates their valuations. Which makes the S&amp;P go up. Which makes everyone think the economy's great. Your 401k? Probably heavy in S&amp;P 500 index funds. Which means 37% of your retirement is bet on these 7 companies and their AI spending paying off eventually.</p>

<p>And we're all just along for the ride.</p>

<p><strong>TLDR</strong></p>

<p>Amazon laid off 30,000 people yesterday. Microsoft 15,000 this year. Meta 3,600. Intel 22,000. Over 180,000 tech workers fired in 2025. All saying it's to "fund AI initiatives." But they're spending $300B+ on AI way more than they're saving from layoffs. Most of that money going to each other in circles. Apple rents AI infrastructure from Google AWS Azure. Everyone buys Nvidia chips. They pay each other for cloud capacity. AI spending added 0.5% to GDP. Without it GDP would've grown 0.6%. Only Meta showing actual AI revenue. Everyone else just spending hoping it pays off. Goldman Sachs and Sequoia reports say ROI is nonexistent so far. But they can't stop spending or stocks crash. Locked in arms race. The 7 biggest tech companies are 37% of S&amp;P 500. Made up 54% of gains in 2024. Your 401k is probably 37% bet on AI spending paying off. If it doesn't they're massively overvalued at 35x earnings. Firing people to fund buying stuff from each other while making no profit yet.</p>

		<p><span>arXiv‚Äôs computer science (CS) category has updated its moderation practice with respect to review (or survey) articles and position papers. Before being considered for submission to arXiv‚Äôs CS category, review articles and position papers must now be accepted at a journal or a conference and complete successful peer review. When submitting review articles or position papers, authors must include documentation of successful peer review to receive full consideration. Review/survey articles or position papers submitted to arXiv without this documentation will be likely to be rejected and not appear on arXiv.</span><span><br>
</span><span><br>
</span><span>This change is being implemented due to the unmanageable influx of review articles and position papers to arXiv CS.</span></p>
<p><b>Is this a policy change?</b></p>
<p><span>Technically, no! If you take a look at </span><a href="https://info.arxiv.org/help/policies/content-types.html"><span>arXiv‚Äôs policies for specific content types</span></a><span> you‚Äôll notice that review articles and position papers are not (and have never been) listed as part of the accepted content types. Review articles and position papers have, in the past, only been accepted at moderator discretion, because the few we received were of high quality and of interest to arXiv readers and the scientific community at large.</span></p>
<p><b>Why is the arXiv CS category making this change?</b></p>
<p><span>In the past few years, arXiv has been flooded with papers. Generative AI / large language models have added to this flood by making papers ‚Äì especially papers not introducing new research results ‚Äì fast and easy to write. While categories across arXiv have all seen a major increase in submissions, it‚Äôs particularly pronounced in arXiv‚Äôs CS category.</span></p>
<p><span>The goal of this change of practice is to:</span></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Help arXiv readers more easily find valuable review articles and position papers written by subject matter experts</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Free up moderators to focus on the content types officially accepted by arXiv, reduce submission hold times, and keep the pace of scientific discovery going!</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span><strong>Above all, the core purpose of arXiv is to share research papers and facilitate scientific discovery quickly and freely. </strong>We are making this change in support of that mission.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In the past, arXiv CS received a relatively small amount of review or survey articles, and those we did receive were of extremely high quality, written by senior researchers at the request of publications like Annual Reviews, Proceedings of the IEEE, and Computing Surveys. Position paper submissions to arXiv were similarly rare, and usually produced by scientific societies or government study groups (for example,the Computing Research Association of the National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine).&nbsp; While, as now, these papers were not content types officially accepted by arXiv, the arXiv moderators accepted them because of their scholarly value to the research community.</span></p>
<p><span>Fast forward to present day ‚Äì submissions to arXiv in general have risen dramatically, and we now receive hundreds of review articles every month. The advent of large language models have made this type of content relatively easy to churn out on demand, and the majority of the review articles we receive are little more than annotated bibliographies, with no substantial discussion of open research issues.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>arXiv believes that there are position papers and review articles that are of value to the scientific community, and we would like to be able to share them on arXiv. However, our team of volunteer moderators do not have the time or bandwidth to review the hundreds of these articles we receive without taking time away from our core purpose, which is to share research articles.</span></p>
<p><span>Reasonable and trusted outside refereed venues already exist (conferences and journals) which solicit position papers and review articles on subjects of concern or interest to our readers (such as concerns over privacy, ethics, safety, and security of recent CS technologies, particularly applications of artificial intelligence) and as part of that process, they conduct in-depth review to assure quality, evidential support of opinions, and scholarly value. Since arXiv does not have the resources to conduct this quality-control in-house for content types that we do not officially accept, this change of practice is allowing us to rely on these refereed venues to do so for us so that we can still share position papers and review articles of value on arXiv.</span></p>
<p><b>How do I submit my review article or position paper to arXiv? </b><span>Before submission to arXiv, have your review article or position paper accepted to a refereed venue with peer review like a journal or a conference.</span> <span>Review articles or position papers must be accepted to a journal or conference before being submitted to arXiv and you must have documentation of complete and successful peer review.</span></p>
<p><span>Please note: the review conducted at conference workshops generally does not meet the same standard of rigor of traditional peer review and is not enough to have your review article or position paper accepted to arXiv. </span></p>
<p><b>How do I show my review article or position paper has successfully completed peer review? </b><span>When you submit to arXiv, please include the peer reviewed journal reference and DOI metadata. If you do not provide this, your review article or position paper will likely be rejected.</span></p>
<p><b>Can I resubmit my position paper or review article after being rejected? </b><span>If your position paper or review article was rejected because it did not complete a successful peer review process, you can submit an appeal request to resubmit if your article has since completed a successful peer review process. Do not resubmit your position paper or review article without an accepted appeal. Here are the </span><a href="https://info.arxiv.org/help/moderation/appeals.html"><span>instructions for how to appeal.</span></a></p>
<p><b>I have a scientific paper studying the impact of science and technology in society. Can I submit this to arXiv without peer review? </b><span>Yes, arXiv has always released these types of scientific papers, for example in cs.CY or physics.soc-ph. These are scientific research papers and are not subject to this moderation practice change.</span></p>
<p><b>Will other categories on arXiv also change their practice re: review articles and position papers? </b><span>Each category of arXiv has different moderators, who are subject matter experts with a terminal degree in their particular subject, to best serve the scholarly pursuits, goals, and standards of their category. While all moderators adhere to arXiv policy, the only policy arXiv has in place with regard to review articles and position papers is that they are not a generally accepted content type. The goal of the moderators of each category is to make sure the work being submitted is actually science, and that it is of potential interest to the scientific community. If other categories see a similar rise in LLM-written review articles and position papers, they may choose to change their moderation practices in a similar manner to better serve arXiv authors and readers. We will make these updates public if and when they do occur.</span></p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://jellyfin.org/posts/SQLite-locking/">https://jellyfin.org/posts/SQLite-locking/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45781298">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="__blog-post-container"><p>SQLite is a powerful database engine, but due to its design, it has limitations that should not be overlooked.</p>
<p>Jellyfin has used a SQLite-based database for storing most of its data for years, but it has also encountered issues on many systems. In this blog post, I will explain how we address these limitations and how developers using SQLite can apply the same solutions.</p>
<p>This will be a technical blog post intended for developers and everyone wanting to learn about concurrency.</p>
<p>Also Jellyfin's implementation of locking for SQLite should be fairly easy to be implemented into another EF Core application if you are facing the same issue.</p>
<p>- JPVenson</p>
<!-- -->
<h2 id="the-premise">The Premise<a href="#the-premise" aria-label="Direct link to The Premise" title="Direct link to The Premise" translate="no">‚Äã</a></h2>
<p>SQLite is a file-based database engine running within your application and allows you to store data in a relational structure.
Overall it gives your application the means of storing structured data as a single file and without having to depend on another application to do so.
Naturally this also comes at a price. If your application fully manages this file, the assumption must be made that your application is the sole owner of this file, and nobody else will tinker with it while you are writing data to it.</p>
<p>So an application that wants to use SQLite as its database needs to be the only one accessing it.
Having established this fact, an important thought arises: if only a single write operation should be performed on a single file at a time, this rule must also apply to operations within the same application.</p>
<h2 id="the-w-a-l-mode">The W-A-L mode<a href="#the-w-a-l-mode" aria-label="Direct link to The W-A-L mode" title="Direct link to The W-A-L mode" translate="no">‚Äã</a></h2>
<p>SQLite has a feature that tries to get around this limitation: the Write-Ahead-Log (WAL).
The WAL is a separate file that acts as a journal of operations that should be applied to an SQLite file.
This allows multiple parallel writes to take place and get enqueued into the WAL.
When another part of the application wants to read data, it reads from the actual database, then scans the WAL for modifications and applies them on the fly.
This is not a foolproof solution; there are still scenarios where WAL does not prevent locking conflicts.</p>
<h2 id="sqlite-transactions">SQLite transactions<a href="#sqlite-transactions" aria-label="Direct link to SQLite transactions" title="Direct link to SQLite transactions" translate="no">‚Äã</a></h2>
<p>A transaction is supposed to ensure two things.
Modifications made within a transaction can be reverted, either when something goes wrong or when the application decides it should and optionally a transaction may also block other readers from reading data that is modified within a transaction.
This is where it gets spicy and we come to the real reason why I am writing this blog post.
For some reason on some systems that run Jellyfin when a transaction takes place the SQLite engine reports the database is locked and instead of waiting for the transaction to be resolved the engine refuses to wait and just crashes.
This seems to be a not uncommon issue and there are many reports to be found on the issue.</p>
<p>The factor that makes this issue so bad is that it does not happen reliably. So far we only have one team member where this can be (somewhat) reliably be reproduced which makes this an even worse a bug.
From the reports this issue happens across all operating systems, drive speeds and with or without virtualization.
So we do not have any deciding factor identified that even contributes to the likelihood of the issue happening.</p>
<h2 id="the-jellyfin-factor">The Jellyfin factor<a href="#the-jellyfin-factor" aria-label="Direct link to The Jellyfin factor" title="Direct link to The Jellyfin factor" translate="no">‚Äã</a></h2>
<p>Having established the general theory on how SQLite behaves, we also have to look at the specifics of Jellyfins usage of SQLite.
During normal operations on a recommended setup (Non-Networked Storage and preferably SSD) its unusual for any problems to arise, however the way Jellyfin utilises the SQLite db up to 10.11 is very suboptimal.
In versions prior to 10.11 Jellyfin had a bug in its parallel task limit which resulted in exponential overscheduling of library scan operations which hammered the database engine with thousands of parallel write requests that an SQLite engine is simply not able to handle.
While most SQLite engine implementations have retry behavior, they also have timeouts and checks in place to prevent limitless waiting so if we stress the engine enough, it just fails with an error.
That and very long running and frankly unoptimized transactions could lead to the database just being overloaded with requests and flaking out.</p>
<h2 id="the-solution">The solution<a href="#the-solution" aria-label="Direct link to The solution" title="Direct link to The solution" translate="no">‚Äã</a></h2>
<p>Since we moved the codebase over to EF Core proper, we have the tools to actually do something about this as EF Core gives us a structured abstraction level.
EF Core supports a way of hooking into every command execution or transaction by creating <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/logging-events-diagnostics/interceptors" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Interceptors</a>.
With an interceptor we can finally do the straight forward idea of just "not" writing to the database in parallel in a transparent way to the caller.
The overall idea is to have multiple strategies of locking. Because all levels of synchronization will inevitably come at the cost of performance, we only want to do it when it is really necessary.
So, I decided on three locking strategies:</p>
<ol>
<li>No-Lock</li>
<li>Optimistic locking</li>
<li>Pessimistic locking</li>
</ol>
<p>As a default, the no-lock behavior does exactly what the name implies. Nothing. This is the default because my research shows that for 99% all of this is not an issue and every interaction at this level will slow down the whole application.</p>
<p>Both the optimistic and pessimistic behaviors use two interceptors‚Äîone for transactions and one for commands‚Äîand override <code>SaveChanges</code> in <code>JellyfinDbContext</code>.</p>
<h3 id="optimistic-locking-behavior">Optimistic locking behavior<a href="#optimistic-locking-behavior" aria-label="Direct link to Optimistic locking behavior" title="Direct link to Optimistic locking behavior" translate="no">‚Äã</a></h3>
<p>Optimistic locking means to assume the operation in question will succeed and only handle issues afterwards. In essence this can be boiled down to "Try and Retry and Retry ..." for a set number of times until either we succeed with the operation or fail entirely.
This still leaves the possibility that we will not actually be able to perform a write, but the introduced overhead is far less than the Pessimistic locking behavior.</p>
<p>The idea behind how this works is simple: every time two operations try to write to the database, one will always win. The other will fail, wait some time, then retry a few times.</p>
<p>Jellyfin uses the <code>Polly</code> library perform the retry behavior and will only retry operations it will find have been locked due to this exact issue.</p>
<h3 id="pessimistic-locking-behavior">Pessimistic locking behavior<a href="#pessimistic-locking-behavior" aria-label="Direct link to Pessimistic locking behavior" title="Direct link to Pessimistic locking behavior" translate="no">‚Äã</a></h3>
<p>Pessimistic locking always locks when a write to SQLite should be performed. Essentially every time an transaction is started or a write operation on the database is done though EF Core, Jellyfin will wait until all other read operations are finished and then block all other operations may they be read or write until the write in question has been performed.
This however means, that Jellyfin can only ever perform a single write to the database, even if it would technically does not need to.</p>
<p>In theory, an application should have no issue reading from table "Alice" while writing to table "Bob" however to eliminate all possible sources of concurrency related locking, Jellyfin will only ever allow a single write performed on its database in this mode.
While this will absolutely result in the most stable operation, it will undoubtedly also be the slowest.</p>
<p>Jellyfin uses a <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fundamentals/runtime-libraries/system-threading-readerwriterlockslim" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ReaderWriterLockSlim</a> to lock the operations, that means we allow an unlimited number of reads to happen concurrently while only one write may ever be done on the database.</p>
<h3 id="the-future-smart-locking-behavior">The future Smart locking behavior<a href="#the-future-smart-locking-behavior" aria-label="Direct link to The future Smart locking behavior" title="Direct link to The future Smart locking behavior" translate="no">‚Äã</a></h3>
<p>In the future we might also consider combining both modes, to get the best of both worlds.</p>
<h2>The result</h2>
<p>Initial testing showed that with both modes, we had great success in handling the underlying issue. While we are not yet sure why this happens only on some systems when others work, we at least now have an option for users previously left out of using Jellyfin.</p>
<p>When I was researching this topic, I found many reports all over the internet facing the same error but nobody was able to provide a conclusive explanation whats really happening here.
There have been similar proposals made to handle it but there wasn't a "ready to drop in" solution that handles all the different cases or only code that required massive modifications to every EF Core query.
Jellyfin's implementation of the locking behaviors should be a copy-paste solution for everyone having the same issues as its using interceptors and the caller has no idea of the actual locking behavior.</p>
<p>Best of luck,</p>

<pre>Hi all,

I plan to introduce hard Rust dependencies and Rust code into
APT, no earlier than May 2026. This extends at first to the
Rust compiler and standard library, and the Sequoia ecosystem.

In particular, our code to parse .deb, .ar, .tar, and the
HTTP signature verification code would strongly benefit
from memory safe languages and a stronger approach to
unit testing.

If you maintain a port without a working Rust toolchain,
please ensure it has one within the next 6 months, or
sunset the port.

It's important for the project as whole to be able to
move forward and rely on modern tools and technologies
and not be held back by trying to shoehorn modern software
on retro computing devices.

Thank you for your understanding.

Maybe it's investors whispering that your team is "understaffed compared to benchmarks." Being understaffed compared to benchmarks almost always should be a source of pride, not a problem. People should be surprised how small your team is, not how big it is.</p><p>What holds you back is rarely team size ‚Äì it's the clarity of your focus, skill and ability to execute. Larger teams mean slower progress, more management overhead, more meetings, more opinions, and usually dilution of vision and standards. Yet growing the team has somehow become a symbol of success.</p><p>At Linear, we hired our first employee after six months and roughly doubled the team each year. With each hire, we make sure they truly elevate the team. We don't set out to hire ten engineers ‚Äì we hire the next <em>great</em> engineer. This intentional approach has allowed us to maintain both quality and culture.</p><p>The most underrated thing about profitability is how much peace of mind it gives you. Once you're profitable, you stop worrying about survival and focus on what really matters: building something great. Building the way you want. Instead of optimizing for the next fundraising round, you optimize for value creation.</p><p>While profitability might not come quickly for every startup, I believe it's achievable sooner than most think. If you're creating a new market, or truly require massive scale like a social network, or significant upfront investment like a hardware company, it might take longer. But if you're in a category where there isn't hard upfront investment, and you get some level of product-market fit with customers willing to pay, you can probably be profitable. You can decide to become profitable. And usually, it's a decision about how much and how fast you hire.</p><p><strong>Measure What Matters</strong></p><p>Revenue per employee is one of the clearest ways to see you‚Äôre hiring appropriately. While some of the best public companies benchmark at $1-2M per employee, for startups it's not unreasonable to target the range of $500k-$1M per employee.</p><p><strong>Understand Your Risk Profile</strong></p><p>Are you building something highly speculative where you're not sure if there's a market for it, or are you building something that already has a market but with a different take on it? In the former case profitability takes longer, but in the latter it could happen right away. Most software today, especially in the B2B space, is about building a modern version of something existing.</p><p><strong>Hire Intentionally and Slower</strong></p><p>For most software startups, ten people before product-market fit should be your ceiling, not your target. After PMF, every hire should address a specific, pressing need ‚Äì not just fill out an org chart. At Linear, our deliberately slow headcount growth forced us to be selective, which meant making better hires. It also protected our culture, since rapid hiring often dilutes the very things that made your startup special in the first place. When you hire less, you naturally hire better.</p><p><strong>Raise on Your Own Terms </strong></p><p>Being profitable doesn't mean you have to be anti-investors. It means you have that choice, and investors are quite interested in profitable companies that also grow fast. You can raise more, less, or nothing. You can wait for the right timing, the right partner, or fund. For most ambitious startups, it can still be a good idea to raise something even if you could get by bootstrapping. Investors can still be helpful, and the additional cash balance can help you to make larger investments, or acquisitions.</p><p>The point is that you can be and are allowed to be profitable as a startup. It's not a bad thing, it's not an oxymoron or as hard as people make it out to be. The secret is that a lot of successful companies actually were quite profitable early on, they just didn't talk about it. When you're profitable, you make decisions based on what's best for your customers and your product, not what's best for impressing investors.</p><p>I didn't set out to build a profitable startup. But once I got there, I realized I wouldn't want to build a company any other way.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><header></header><section><article> <p>A few months back, while playing around with <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://threejs.org/">Three.js</a>, I came across something that completely derailed my plans. Strange attractors - fancy math that creates beautiful patterns. At first I thought I'd just render one and move on, but then soon I realized that this is too much fun. When complexity emerges from three simple equations, when you see something chaotic emerge into beautiful, it's hard not to waste some time. I've spent countless hours, maybe more than I'd care to admit, watching these patterns form. I realized there's something deeply satisfying about seeing order emerge from randomness. Let me show you what kept me hooked.</p>

<h2>The Basics: Dynamical Systems and Chaos Theory</h2>
<p>Dynamical Systems are a mathematical way to understand how things <strong>change over time</strong>. Imagine you have a system, which
could be anything from the movement of planets to the growth of a population. In this system, there are rules that
determine how it evolves from one moment to the next. These rules tell you what will happen next based on what is
happening now. Some examples are, a pendulum, the weather patterns, a flock of birds, the spread of a virus in a
population (we are all too familiar with this one), and stock market.</p>
<p>There are two primary things to understand about this system:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Phase Space</strong>: This is like a big collection of all the possible states the system can be in. Each state is like a
snapshot of the system at a specific time. This is also called the <strong>state space</strong> or the <strong>world state</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Dynamics</strong>: These are the rules that takes one state of the system and moves it to the next state. It can be
represented as a function that transforms the system from now to later.</li>
</ul>

<p>For instance, when studying population growth, a phase-space (world-state) might consist of the current population size
and the rate of growth or decline at a specific time. The dynamics would then be derived from models of population
dynamics, which, considering factors like birth rates, death rates, and carrying capacity of the environment, dictate
the changes in population size over time.</p>
<p>Another way of saying this is that the dynamical systems describe how things change over time, in a space of
possibilities, governed by a set of rules. Numerous fields such as biology, physics, economics, and applied mathematics,
study systems like these, focusing on the specific rules that dictate their evolution. These rules are grounded in
relevant theories, such as Newtonian mechanics, fluid dynamics, and mathematics of economics, among others.</p>
<h3 id="chaos-theory">Chaos Theory</h3>
<p>There are different ways of classifying dynamical systems, and one of the most interesting is the classification into
chaotic and non-chaotic systems. The change over time in non-chaotic systems is more deterministic as compared to
chaotic systems which exhibit randomness and unpredictability.</p>
<p><strong>Chaos Theory</strong> is the sub branch of dynamical systems that studies chaotic systems and challenges the traditional
deterministic views of causality. Most of the natural systems we observe are chaotic in nature, like the weather, a drop
of ink dissolving in water, social and economic behaviours etc. In contrast, systems like the movement of planets,
pendulums, and simple harmonic oscillators are extremely predictable and non-chaotic.</p>
<p>Chaos Theory deals with systems that exhibit irregular and unpredictable behavior over time, even though they follow
deterministic rules. Having a set of rules that govern the system, and yet exhibit randomness and unpredictability,
might seem a bit contradictory, but it is because the rules do not always represent the whole system. In fact, most of
the time, these rules are an approximation of the system and that is what leads to the unpredictability. In complex
systems, we do not have enough information to come up with a perfect set of rules. And by using incomplete information
to make predictions, we introduce uncertainty, which amplifies over time, leading to the chaotic behaviour.</p>

<p>Chaotic systems generally have many non-linear interacting components, which we partially understand (or can partially
observe) and which are very sensitive to small changes. A small change in the initial conditions can lead to a
completely different outcome, a phenomenon known as the <strong>butterfly effect</strong>. In this post, we will try to see the
butterfly effect in action but before that, let's talk about <strong>Strange Attractors</strong>.</p>
<h2>Strange Attractors</h2>
<p>To understand Strange Attractors, let's first understand what an attractor is. As discussed earlier, dynamical systems
are all about <strong>change over time</strong>. During this change, the system moves through different possible states (remember the
phase space jargon?). An attractor is a set of states towards which a system tends to settle over time, or you can say,
towards which it is <strong>attracted</strong>. It's like a magnet that pulls the system towards it.</p>
<p>For example, think of a pendulum. When you release it, it swings back and forth, but eventually, it comes to rest at the
bottom. The bottom is the attractor in this case. It's the state towards which the pendulum is attracted.</p>
<p>This happens due to the system's inherent dynamics, which govern how states in the phase space change. Here are some of
the reasons why different states get attracted towards attractors:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Stability</strong>: Attractors are stable states of the system, meaning that once the system reaches them, it tends to stay
there. This stability arises from the system's dynamics, which push it towards the attractor and keep it there.</li>
<li><strong>Dissipation</strong>: Many dynamical systems have dissipative forces, which cause the system to lose energy over time. This
loss of energy leads the system to settle into a lower-energy state, which often corresponds to an attractor. This is
what happens in the case of the pendulum.</li>
<li><strong>Contraction</strong>: In some regions of the phase space, the system's dynamics cause trajectories to converge. This
contraction effect means that nearby states will tend to come closer together over time, eventually being drawn
towards the attractor.</li>
</ul>

<p>Some attractors have complex governing equations that can create unpredictable trajectories or behaviours. These
nonlinear interactions can result in multiple stable states or periodic orbits, towards which the system evolves. These
complex attractors are categorised as <strong>strange attractors</strong>. They are called "strange" due to their unique
characteristics.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Fractal Structure</strong>: Strange attractors often have a fractal-like structure, meaning they display intricate
patterns that repeat at different scales. This complexity sets them apart from simpler, regular attractors.</li>
<li><strong>Sensitive Dependence on Initial Conditions</strong>: Systems with strange attractors are highly sensitive to their initial
conditions. Small changes in the starting point can lead to vastly different long-term behaviors, a phenomenon known
as the "butterfly effect".</li>
<li><strong>Unpredictable Trajectories</strong>: The trajectories on a strange attractor never repeat themselves, exhibiting
non-periodic motion. The system's behavior appears random and unpredictable, even though it is governed by
deterministic rules.</li>
<li><strong>Emergent Order from Chaos</strong>: Despite their chaotic nature, strange attractors exhibit a form of underlying order.
Patterns and structures emerge from the seemingly random behavior, revealing the complex dynamics at play.</li>
</ol>
<p>You can observe most of these characteristics in the visualisation. The one which is most fascinating to observe is the
butterfly effect.</p>
<h3 id="the-butterfly-effect">The Butterfly Effect</h3>
<blockquote><p>A butterfly can flutter its wings over a flower in China and cause a hurricane in the Caribbean.</p></blockquote>
<p>One of the defining features of strange attractors is their sensitivity to initial conditions. This means that small
changes in the starting state of the system can lead to vastly different long-term behaviors, a phenomenon known as the
<strong>butterfly effect</strong>. In chaotic systems, tiny variations in the initial conditions can amplify over time, leading to
drastically different outcomes.</p>

<p>In our visualisation, let's observe this behavior on Thomas Attractor. It is governed by the following equations:</p>

<p>There is another way of observing the butterfly effect in this visualisation. Change the <code>Initial State</code> from <code>cube</code> to
<code>sphere surface</code> in the control panel and observe how the particles move differently in the two cases. The particles
eventually get attracted to the same states but have different trajectories.</p>

<h2>Implementation Details</h2>
<p>This visualization required rendering a large number of particles using Three.js. To achieve this efficiently, we used a
technique called <strong>ping-pong rendering</strong> <sup><a href="#user-content-fn-2" id="user-content-fnref-2" aria-describedby="footnote-label">2</a></sup>. This method handles iterative updates of particle systems directly on the GPU,
minimizing data transfers between the CPU and GPU. It utilizes two frame buffer objects (FBOs) that alternate roles: One
stores the current state of particles and render them on the screen, while the other calculates the next state.</p>
<h3 id="implementation-workflow">Implementation Workflow</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Setting Up Frame Buffer Objects (FBOs):</strong> We start by creating two FBOs, <code>ping</code> and <code>pong</code>, to hold the current and
next state of particles. These buffers store data such as particle positions in RGBA channels, making efficient use
of GPU resources.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Shader Programs for Particle Dynamics:</strong> The shader programs execute on the GPU and apply attractor dynamics to
each particle. Following is the attractor function which update the particle positions based on the attractor equation.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Rendering and Buffer Swapping:</strong> In each frame, the shader computes the new positions based on the attractor's
equations and stores them in the inactive buffer. After updating, the roles of the FBOs are swapped: The previously
inactive buffer becomes active, and vice versa.</p>

</li>
</ol>
<p>This combination of efficient shader calculations and the ping-pong technique allows us to render the particle system.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="centercontent">
<p itemprop="description">Last night I had a very strange experience: About two thirds of the way through reading a Web page about myself, Tim Bray, I
    succumbed to boredom and killed the tab. Thus my introduction to
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grokipedia">Grokipedia</a>. Here are early impressions.</p>

<p id="p-1"><span>On Bray</span> ¬∑ 
My Grokipedia entry has over seven thousand words, compared to a mere 1,300 in
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Bray">my Wikipedia article</a>. It‚Äôs pretty clear how it was generated; an LLM, trained
    on who-knows-what but definitely including that Wikipedia article and this blog, was told to go nuts.</p>

<p>Speaking as a leading but highly biased expert on the subject of T. Bray, here are the key take-aways:</p>

<p id="p-2"><span>(Overly) complete</span> ¬∑ 
It covers all the territory; there is no phase of my life‚Äôs activity that could possibly be encountered in combing the Web
    that is not exhaustively covered. In theory this should be good but in fact, who cares about the details of what I worked on
    at Sun Microsystems between 2004 and 2010? I suppose I should but, like I said, I couldn‚Äôt force myself to plod all the way
    through it.</p>

<p id="p-3"><span>Wrong</span> ¬∑ 
Every paragraph contains significant errors. Sometimes the text is explicitly self-contradictory on the face of it,
    sometimes the mistakes are subtle enough that only I would spot them.</p>

<p id="p-4"><span>Style</span> ¬∑ 
The writing has that LLM view-from-nowhere flat-affect semi-academic flavor. I don‚Äôt like it but the evidence suggests that
    some people do?</p>

<p id="p-5"><span>References</span> ¬∑ 
All the references are just URLs and at least some of them entirely fail to support the text. Here‚Äôs an example. In
    discussion of my expert-witness work for the FTC in their litigation against Meta concerning its acquisitions of Instagram and
    WhatsApp, Grokipedia says:</p>

<blockquote><p>[Bray] opined that users' perceptions of response times in online services critically influence market
    dynamics.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It cites
    <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/ftc_gov/pdf/FTCReplytoMetaResponse-CounterstatementofMaterialFacts.pdf">Federal
    Trade Commission‚Äôs Reply to Meta Platforms, Inc.‚Äôs Response to Federal Trade Commission‚Äôs Counterstatement of Material
    Facts</a> (warning: 2,857-page PDF). Okay, that was one of the things I argued, but the 425 pages of court documents that I
    filed, and the references to my reporting in the monster document, make it clear that it was one tiny subset of the main
    argument.</p>

<p>Anyhow, I (so that you won‚Äôt have to) spent a solid fifteen minutes spelunking back and forth through that FTC doc, looking
    for strings like ‚Äúresponse time‚Äù and ‚Äúlatency‚Äù and so on. Maybe somewhere in those pages there‚Äôs support for the claim quoted
    above, but I couldn‚Äôt find it.</p>

<p id="p-6"><span>Useful?</span> ¬∑ 
Wikipedia, in my mind, has two main purposes: A quick visit to find out the basics about some city or person or plant or
    whatever, or a deep-dive to find out what we <em>really</em> know about genetic linkages to autism or Bach‚Äôs relationship with
    Frederick the Great or whatever.</p>

<p>At the moment, Grokipedia doesn‚Äôt really serve either purpose very well. But, after all, this is release 0.1, maybe we
    should give it a chance.</p>

<p>Or, maybe not.</p>

<p id="p-7"><span>Woke/Anti-Woke</span> ¬∑ 
The whole point, one gathers, is to provide an antidote to Wikipedia‚Äôs alleged woke bias. So I dug into that. Let‚Äôs consider
    three examples of what I found.  First, from that same paragraph about the FTC opinion quoted above:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>While Bray and aligned progressives contend that such dominance stifles innovation by enabling predatory acquisitions and
      reduced rivalry‚Äîevidenced by fewer startup exits in concentrated sectors‚Äîcounterarguments highlight that Big Tech's scale has
      fueled empirical gains, with these firms investing over $240 billion in U.S. R&amp;D in 2024 (more than a quarter of national
      totals) and driving AI, cloud, and patent surges.[<a href="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2020/06/08/Anti-monopoly">128</a>]
      [<a href="https://www.intereconomics.eu/contents/year/2025/number/2/article/big-tech-and-the-us-digital-military-industrial-complex.html">131</a>] Six tech industries alone accounted for
      over one-third of 
      U.S. GDP growth from 2012‚Äì2021, comprising about 9% of the 
      economy and sustaining 9.3 million jobs amid falling consumer prices and rapid technological diffusion.
      [<a href="https://itif.org/publications/2023/05/30/six-tech-industries-accounted-for-more-than-one-third-of-gdp-growth-in-the-last-decade/">132]</a> 
      [<a href="https://jamesmadison.org/the-united-states-is-the-leader-of-the-digital-revolution-pro-tech-policies-are-key/">133</a>]
      Right-leaning economists often defend consumer welfare metrics and market self-correction, warning that forced divestitures
      risk eroding the efficiencies and investment incentives that have propelled sector productivity above 6% annual growth in key
      areas like durable manufacturing tech.
      [<a href="https://itif.org/publications/2025/09/19/five-persistent-myths-about-big-tech/">134</a>]
      [<a href="https://www.nber.org/digest/oct01/technology-and-productivity-growth?page=1&amp;perPage=50">135</a>]</p>

</blockquote>
<p>I‚Äôve linked the numbered citations to the indicated URLs. Maybe visit one or two of them and see what you think? Four are
    to articles arguing, basically, that monopolies must be OK because the companies accused of it are growing really fast and
    driving the economy. They seem mostly to be from right-wing think-tanks but I guess that‚Äôs what those think-tanks are for.  One
    of them, #131, <cite>Big Tech and the US Digital-Military-Industrial Complex</cite>, I think isn‚Äôt helpful to the argument at
    all. But still, it‚Äôs broadly doing what they advertise: Pushing back against ‚Äúwoke‚Äù positions, in this case the position that
    monopolization is bad.</p>

<p>I looked at a couple of other examples.  For example, this is from the header of the Greta Thunberg article:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>While credited with elevating youth engagement on environmental issues, Thunberg's promotion of urgent, existential climate
      threats has drawn scrutiny for diverging from nuanced empirical assessments of climate risks and adaptation capacities, as
      well as for extending her activism into broader political arenas such as anti-capitalist and geopolitical protests.[5][6]</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Somehow I feel no urge to click on those citation links.</p>

<p>If Ms Thunberg is out there on the ‚Äúwoke‚Äù end of the spectrum, let‚Äôs flit over to the other end, namely the entry for
    J.D. Vance, on the subject of his book <cite>Hillbilly Elegy</cite>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Critics from progressive outlets, including Sarah Smarsh in her 2018 book <cite>Heartland</cite>, faulted the memoir for
      overemphasizing personal and cultural failings at the expense of structural economic policies, arguing it perpetuated
      stereotypes of rural whites as self-sabotaging.[71] These objections, often rooted in institutional analyses from academia and
      media, overlooked data on behavioral patterns like opioid dependency rates‚Äîpeaking at 21.5 deaths per 100,000 in Appalachia
      around 2016‚Äîthat aligned with Vance's observations of "deaths of despair" precursors.[72]</p>

</blockquote>
<p>I read and enjoyed <cite>Heartland</cite> but the citation is to a <cite>New Yorker</cite> article that doesn‚Äôt mention
    Smarsh. As for the second sentence‚Ä¶ my first reaction as I trudged through its many clauses, was ‚Äúlife‚Äôs too short‚Äù.
    But seriously, opioid-death statistics weaken the hypothesis about structural economic issues? Don‚Äôt get it.</p>

<p id="p-8"><span>Take-away</span> ¬∑ 
Wikipedia is,
    <a href="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2024/06/15/Wikipedia-Pain">to quote myself</a>, the encyclopedia that ‚Äúanyone who‚Äôs willing to
    provide citations can edit‚Äù.
    Grokipedia is ‚Äúthe encyclopedia that Elon Musk‚Äôs LLM can edit, with sketchy citations and no progressive argument left
    un-attacked.‚Äù</p>

<p>So I guess it‚Äôs Working As Intended?</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      

<p><img src="https://enaix.github.io/assets/img/android-skull.jpg" alt="android skull"></p>

<p>As you all know, Google has introduced developer verification as a way to prevent users from installing ‚Äúunregistered‚Äù APKs. This measure was taken as a security feature to link every APK in existence to its developer, as in Play Store.</p>

<p><a href="https://developer.android.com/developer-verification">Link to the Android documentation</a>, <a href="https://developer.android.com/developer-verification/guides/faq">link to FAQ</a></p>

<h2 id="why-this-is-bad">Why this is bad</h2>

<p>This has already been discussed by <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/10/google-confirms-android-dev-verification-will-have-free-and-paid-tiers-no-public-list-of-devs/">ArsTechnica</a> and on some threads (some cherry-picked ones): <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/1nwddik/heres_how_androids_new_app_verification_rules/">reddit</a>, <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45017028">ycombinator</a>, <a href="https://hackaday.com/2025/08/26/google-will-require-developer-verification-even-for-sideloading/">hackaday</a>.</p>

<p>A quick recap of the main points (as of 30 Oct 2025):</p>

<ul>
  <li>The base tier costs $25, as in Play Market. Requires an ID</li>
  <li>There will be a limited ‚Äúhobbyist‚Äù unpaid license. Google claims that they won‚Äôt require an ID</li>
  <li>Legal info is told to be private, unlike with Play Market</li>
  <li>The verification code is supposed to be located in Play Services, <strong>but Google hasn‚Äôt published the source code yet</strong></li>
  <li>Google assures that it would be possible to install applications locally using ADB, <strong>but there are no details on this</strong></li>
  <li>Hobbyist license restrictions are unknown</li>
</ul>

<p>A few months prior Google has decided to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/03/google-makes-android-development-private-will-continue-open-source-releases/">make Android development private</a>, which seems to be a preparation for the upcoming changes (<a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-not-killing-aosp-3566882/">another article</a>). Due to this change in AOSP release format, it is no longer possible to track what exactly Google is doing.</p>

<p>My answer to this question is that it would simply prevent small developers from distributing their apps, including myself. If we take the legal route, a hobbyist license is supposed to have some limit on the number of installs by design. If we take, say, 10K installs, this is not enough in my case. Another question is how exactly the process of verification is going to happen, what if Google adopts the same rules as in Play Store? Taking my <a href="https://github.com/enaix/Kirikiroid2-debloated">fork of the old VN engine port</a>, this apk would not pass security checks, as the old codebase relies on legacy external storage permissions, which are banned in Play Store. If we take the adb route, there are <strong>no guarantees that this method is going to work in the future in the form you expect</strong>. For instance, Google mentions that this method is meant for on-device tests during development, and nothing prevents them from reporting the install to their servers and checking if a self-signed apk has been installed on other devices. Another way to put it, this is problematic for an average Android user to perform these steps, and this is going to be the developer‚Äôs problem.</p>

<p>The situation links pretty well with Samsung <a href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/say-goodbye-to-your-custom-roms-as-one-ui-8-kills-bootloader-unlock/">removing bootloader unlocking with the One UI 8 update</a>. Great, duh‚Ä¶</p>

<h2 id="the-concept">The concept</h2>

<p><img src="https://enaix.github.io/assets/img/loader1.svg" alt="apk loader"></p>

<p>My vision of the hack is to distribute a verified loader apk, which in turn dynamically loads any apk the user wants. A user obtains the loader apk once and loads apps without installing as much as they want.</p>

<p>The Java virtual machine in Android is the ART/Dalvik runtime (I will refer to it as Dalvik, it seems that Google hates cool names). Did you know that Dalvik natively <a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/dalvik/system/PathClassLoader">allows dynamic code execution using PathClassLoader</a>? So an apk may just load some zip/apk/dex code from external storage and execute it in current context. Essentially, this means that we can natively load the apk into memory and execute any code inside of the target apk, and we are not altering the original code signature of the loader.</p>

<p>In order to actually run the apk, the loader needs to properly initialize the main activity (aka the main screen, or the entrypoint) of the target apk. So, the main activity needs to be initialized and somehow placed inside of the Android‚Äôs activity cycle with the loader acting as a wrapper. Then, the loader apk should handle other aspects like local files handling and names conflict resolution. This can be achieved by patching the target apk bytecode: .odex/.dex classes may be dynamically decompiled into .smali, analyzed and compiled back into a modified apk. Furthermore, the loader would have to parse AndroidManifest options of the target (main activity location, screen options).</p>

<h3 id="implementation">Implementation</h3>

<p>Developing such wrapper in a straightforward way has proven to be rather difficult, as Android <a href="https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/base/+/master/core/java/android/app/Activity.java">activity management logic</a> is extremely complicated and differs from version to version. In short, it was problematic to perform the initialization process the right way. Some people suggested to avoid the initialization step completely, and use Unsafe Dalvik api to register the target‚Äôs activity as the loader apk activity stub, which is declared in the loader‚Äôs manifest without class. I couldn‚Äôt find exact methods in the <a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/sun/misc/Unsafe">Unsafe documentation</a>, but this actually may be a way to go.</p>

<p>Due to this particular issue I couldn‚Äôt bring the proof of concept to a working state in a reasonable time, and because of this I was considering to not publish this article at all. The purpose of this post is not to give a somewhat ready solution, but get some feedback on the concept, as I was not ready to devote lots of time on a potentially broken solution.</p>

<h2 id="the-logistics">The logistics</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Information provided in this section is for educational use only, all scenarios discussed below are hypothetical.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>In order to install the loader apk on the device, it would require, well, some form of verification. Hobbyist license is the only choice here, as paying $25 for each attempt is not optimal. Since the hobbyist license has a limited number of installs, there should be multiple instances of the apk with separate licences. In this hypothetical scenario there may either be a pool of volunteers who sign the code, or completely random users who are willing to help. In the second case, the loader code would somehow need to be verified or scanned, since such distribution system would be vulnerable to malware.</p>

<p>The final and the most important issue in this process is the verification process itself, as the loader code may (and likely will) be flagged by Google. So, the code would require some form of obfuscation like code flow modification and implementing double functionality (for instance, registering it as a file manager). If Google decides to ban dynamic code loading altogether, the final solution would be to pack the Dalvik runtime into the loader as a native library. This of course would have extremely low performance, but it should be technically possible.</p>

<p>Overall, the hypothetical plan has lots of assumptions, with which I‚Äôm not happy with. First of all, it requires lots of manual work by the volunteers or random people, and this work also includes the apk obfuscation, which was not discussed in detail. Then, the verification process itself should be somewhat permissive to allow potentially suspicious apps (I would like to hear how does this happen with current Play Store verification).</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>The project described in this article by no means is a finished solution, and if you have started to think what else could work, it means that the article has reached its original goal. I believe that we would eventually come up with a proper solution in the future. Thank you for reading!</p>

<p>Most leaders reflexively think of silos as BAD and collaboration as GOOD. This manifesto defends silos and challenges the value of collaboration.</p>
<h2>Increasing collaboration can do harm</h2>
<p>In general, you should aim to maximize collaboration <em>within</em> teams, and minimize collaboration <em>between</em> teams.</p>
<h3>Why maximize collaboration within teams?</h3>
<p>A collaborative team works together on one or two goals. Why?</p>
<ul>
<li>This maximizes <a href="https://www.rubick.com/communication-is-shared-state/">shared state</a> ‚Äî everyone has a common understanding of goals, progress, and who is doing what.</li>
<li>This gives team members a better ability to focus and coordinate their work with each other.</li>
<li>Team members have overlapping areas of knowledge, so they can critique each other‚Äôs work and help each other grow.</li>
<li>They are more innovative, because the interplay between people as they work on the same goal helps generate more diverse thinking and improve decision-making.</li>
<li>When someone leaves the team, the fact that others have a shared understanding of the work means the team can survive and continue to work effectively.</li>
<li>People can go on vacation or leave without as much disruption.</li>
</ul>
<p>Collaborative teams feel great to be a part of ‚Äî everyone shares the same victories and accomplishments together. A team that doesn‚Äôt collaborate often really isn‚Äôt a team at all.</p>
<h3>Why minimize collaboration between teams?</h3>
<p>To the maximum extent possible, teams should have what they need to succeed within the borders of their team. And where that is not true, you need some structure to ensure the team can get what it needs in a way that will scale with the organization‚Äôs growth.</p>
<p>As companies grow, communication and dependencies proliferate. Companies start out with many-to-many communication. As they grow, the communication patterns within the company must necessarily switch to being segmented and defined. Otherwise, the communication burden on teams will grow at an exponential rate, and the increasing complexity will degrade the effectiveness of the company.</p>
<p>I observed an example of this at New Relic:</p>
<ol>
<li>As the engineering organization grew, we encouraged a collaborative culture and rewarded people for collaboration between teams (it was even part of our promotion criteria ‚Äî you can blame that on me!).</li>
<li>After a few years, the increasing number of teams made it more and more difficult to manage dependencies between teams, to the point that it eventually became impossible to accomplish any large project within the organization. I know, because I was one of the ‚Äúbest project managers‚Äù, so I got put on many of those large projects ‚Äî and they were systematically impossible to execute on. We all tried heroically to make it work, but the system was rigged ‚Äî there wasn‚Äôt a way to accomplish these larger projects.</li>
<li>The solution to this was to eventually define the interaction models between teams, reduce dependencies, and add some <a href="https://www.rubick.com/product-council/?utm_source=ck-silos&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_campaign=silos">structure to prioritization</a> and communication.</li>
</ol>
<p>Looking back in retrospect, it was as obvious as math what happened, but I see organizations fall into this trap over and over. We‚Äôll talk more about how to structure these solutions in the second blog post in this series.</p>
<p>Collaboration <em>sounds</em> great, but it‚Äôs something you want to actively be combating between teams. A little collaboration is fine, but excessive collaboration between teams is a sign your organization isn‚Äôt structured well. If you ever wonder why Bezos took such a hard line on his <a href="https://chrislaing.net/blog/the-memo/#fn:1">API mandate</a> in 2002, this probably factored into it. Bezos structured Amazon so that teams were as independent as possible.</p>
<h2>What are silos?</h2>
<p>Silos are boundaries between groups of people, based on the organizational structure and teams they‚Äôre working on.</p>
<h2>Why do silos exist?</h2>
<p>Silos exist because humans have cognitive and communication limits:</p>
<ul>
<li>Humans can only handle a certain number of relationships</li>
<li>Humans have a limit to how much communication they can handle.</li>
<li>Humans are pre-wired to think in terms of teams and tribes. We work better in small groups.</li>
<li>Humans have cognitive limits on the amount they can focus on.</li>
</ul>
<p>It‚Äôs important to recognize that these limits are real limits, and not something you can wish away. Every company in the world (above a certain size) operates in teams that specialize. We organize into teams and have org structures generally because that is what human beings need to work in larger groups.</p>
<p>There are ways to flex certain aspects of this. For example, a company that is designed to be fully asynchronous can rely on process and tooling to change some of these constraints. But even then, you‚Äôre moving the constraints around, not eliminating them completely. You need to operate in a way that recognizes these limits.</p>
<h2>Why do leaders want to break down silos?</h2>
<p>Leaders start talking about breaking down silos when they see that individual parts of the company aren‚Äôt achieving larger business outcomes and are excessively focused on their own area. Alternatively, they talk about breaking down silos when parts of the company aren‚Äôt well coordinated with each other. Generally this happens once the organization has become complex enough that the structure is getting in the way.</p>
<p>Here are a couple of examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>Marketing is planning a major announcement of an upcoming launch, but can‚Äôt get a timing commitment from the product and engineering teams.</li>
<li>Two teams in engineering are building the same service, but in slightly different ways.</li>
</ul>
<p>Leaders see these things, and start blathering about ‚Äúbreaking down silos‚Äù and ‚Äúincreasing collaboration‚Äù. What‚Äôs wrong with that?</p>
<h2>‚ÄúBreaking down silos‚Äù represents incomplete thinking</h2>
<p><strong>‚ÄúBreaking down silos‚Äù is an exhortation rather than a diagnosis or prescription of how to improve the situation</strong>. ‚ÄúBreaking down silos‚Äù blames individuals for not having a big enough vision and working across boundaries, instead of looking with curiosity at the system and asking <em>why</em> they are doing what they‚Äôre doing. It‚Äôs expecting people to have your level of perspective without figuring out why they don‚Äôt.</p>
<p>But the main problem is that it isn‚Äôt specific enough.</p>
<h2>Communication != Collaboration != Coordination</h2>
<p>When you hear someone say they want teams to collaborate more or break down silos, encourage them to look at the problem from three perspectives:</p>
<h3>Coordination</h3>
<p>Usually when people talk about collaboration, what they‚Äôre really looking for is better coordination.</p>
<p>Coordination is ‚Äúthe harmonious functioning of parts for effective results‚Äù (<a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/coordination">Merriam-Webster</a>)</p>
<p>The US military found that the best way to coordinate groups of people quickly and effectively was to <a href="https://www.marines.mil/News/Publications/MCPEL/Electronic-Library-Display/Article/899837/mcdp-1/">centralize coordination and decentralize decision-making and execution</a>. This is still the state of the art for organizational design. You want local groups to be able to act independently and have what they need to be successful. You want centralized functions to set high level objectives and coordinate where necessary to produce the right outcomes.</p>
<p>We‚Äôll talk in the second post in this series about a multitude of ways you can coordinate groups of people working together.</p>
<h3>Communication</h3>
<p>Communication is transferring information from one person or group to another.</p>
<p>When people talk about needing increased collaboration, you can often achieve this more effectively by looking at the flow of information between people, and redesigning it. Typically, you can do something like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Ask people how they are getting information today.</li>
<li>Find out what information people actually need.</li>
<li>Design the lightest weight version of this you can imagine.</li>
<li>Try it out</li>
<li>Get feedback and act on that feedback.</li>
</ol>
<p>One thing I‚Äôve done over and over in many startups is set up weekly communication on projects in engineering. This helps the marketing organization understand how to coordinate their work with engineering, among other benefits.</p>
<h3>Collaboration</h3>
<p>Collaboration is when people work together to produce an outcome. When teams are collaborating, it means they‚Äôre working with other teams to achieve outcomes together. That‚Äôs often a sign the team isn‚Äôt set up well. Ideally, it should have what it needs to do what it needs without dependencies on other teams.</p>
<p>A team that has to collaborate to achieve its objectives is going to be less reliably successful. In general, teams shouldn‚Äôt be collaborating with more than a couple of teams, unless they‚Äôre explicitly set up to be that way. For example, in some organizations you might set up the design team as a ‚Äúservice‚Äù organization which provides design for a larger organization. For teams that are set up that way, it can be fine, but it usually should be very carefully thought through. What is the interaction model for the team, and how will it deal with the inevitable fact that there will be excess demands on it? We‚Äôll cover some of these patterns and their tradeoffs in the second post in this series.</p>
<p>Of course, the world is messy, and you shouldn‚Äôt expect a complete lack of collaboration between teams. But when you see teams collaborate, that‚Äôs something to pay attention to.</p>
<h2>Technical analogy</h2>
<p>You might think of silos as ‚Äúencapsulation‚Äù. Leaders want to dig into the internals of the classes holding the logic they need. But it‚Äôs a bad solution to just bolt that on ‚Äî you really need to refactor things so that they are better structured.</p>
<h2>How do you get teams to coordinate better?</h2>
<p>In the next post in this series, I share concrete <a href="https://www.rubick.com/coordination-models/">patterns that help teams and departments work across organizational boundaries</a>.</p>
