<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-element="story-body" data-subscriber-content=""> <p>California lawmakers on Thursday narrowly approved a bill supported by veterans and criminal justice reform advocates to decriminalize the possession and personal use of a limited list of natural psychedelics, including “magic mushrooms.” </p><p>Gov. Gavin Newsom will now decide the fate of <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=202320240SB58" target="_blank">Senate Bill 58,</a> which would remove criminal penalties for the possession and use of psilocybin and psilocin, the active ingredients in psychedelic mushrooms, mescaline and dimethyltryptamine, or DMT, known as ayahuasca. The bill also would require the California Health and Human Services Agency to study the therapeutic use of psychedelics and submit a report with its findings and recommendations to the Legislature. </p><p>The measure passed the Senate 21 to 14, with several Democrats opposing. </p><p>“California’s veterans, first responders, and others struggling with PTSD, depression, and addiction deserve access to these promising plant medicines,” state Sen. Scott Wiener (D-San Francisco) said in a statement after the bill passed the Assembly in a bipartisan 42-11 vote. “It’s time to stop criminalizing people who use psychedelics for healing or personal well-being.”</p><p>The measure would apply only to those 21 and older and does not authorize the personal transfer or sale of psychedelics in dispensaries. Rather, it would mean police cannot arrest people who have or use limited amounts of the drugs. <a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/06/05/730061916/oakland-city-council-effectively-decriminalizes-psychedelic-mushrooms" target="_blank">Oakland</a> and <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/01/30/us/santa-cruz-mushrooms-psychedelics-trnd/index.html" target="_blank">Santa Cruz</a> have passed similar measures. </p><p>Criminal justice reform advocates said decriminalizing psychedelics is a step toward ending a war on drugs, while veterans groups said it would help destigmatize psychedelics that, in some cases, have been more effective in treating post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety and depression than traditional drugs and therapies. </p><p>Jesse Gould, a former army ranger and founder of the Heroic Hearts Project, SB 58’s sponsor, said the measure would help prevent veterans from having to make the choice between “saving their own life or becoming a criminal in the eyes of their country.” </p><p>Gould said psychedelics helped him through his own journey with PTSD after three deployments to Afghanistan. He said many of his organization’s clients have similarly turned to hallucinogens for relief after other interventions didn’t work.</p><p>“This is just very basic, people should not be criminalized if they are using personal possession of these substances. If people are choosing to do that in their own privacy, they should absolutely be able to have that ability,” Gould said. “We just came out of 20 years of war. There’s clearly a mental health issue.” </p><p>The measure that passed the Senate is a narrowed version that Wiener first introduced last year that would have also decriminalized the use and possession of MDMA, commonly known as ecstasy, and LSD. Wiener also agreed this summer to cut ibogaine, a psychoactive alkaloid found in the iboga shrub, from the decriminalization portion of SB 58 and instead added it to the list of therapeutics to be studied.</p><p>Those changes eased some concerns among lawmakers, including a handful of Republicans who voted for the proposal. </p><p>Assemblymember Bill Essayli (R-Corona) said he was convinced to support the bill after it was revised to include only three plant-based psychedelics and because it is largely limited to personal use and has an age requirement of 21. </p><p>“I think the data is clear that while pharmaceuticals certainly have a benefit to some people, it’s not having a benefit on all of society,” Essayli said. “And I think we can say our approach to mental health in the medical community is not working. I think we are worse off now than we were before.” </p><p>But the bill divided Democrats, with many of the caucus’ more moderate members either abstaining or voting in opposition of the measure. Law enforcement lobbied against the proposal, arguing that the drugs were understudied and could lead to a surge in crime. Parental organizations also worry that the bill lacks the necessary guardrails to keep young adults and teenagers from experimenting with the drugs. </p><p>Lisa Hudson, a Marin County mom who has opposed the bill, said her 16-year-old son Shayne Rebbetoy died at their home after taking mushrooms and running off their deck, thinking he could fly. Hudson said the bill fails to include the necessary education, research and training for first responders. </p><p>“I fear more deaths amongst teenagers, amongst young adults, amongst veterans, and people who are searching for this therapeutic benefit,” Hudson said. “Because in an unregulated model, you’re spinning the roulette wheel. ... To me, it’s just so irresponsible and reckless.” </p><p>Newsom has until Oct. 14 to approve or veto hundreds of bills. If signed, the bill would go into effect on Jan. 1, 2025. </p> </div></div>]]></description>

        <p>Updated for <strong>emacs 29</strong></p>
      
      <img src="https://www.masteringemacs.org/static/img/fleuron2.gif">
      
<p>Wonderful news! Emacs 29.1 is out now. If you’re wondering what’s new, and why it’s <em>absolutely</em> worth upgrading, keep reading. I’ve annotated the NEWS file – as I’ve been doing for the last thirteen years – with my own thoughts and comments on the deluge of new and interesting features.</p><p>To celebrate, <a href="https://www.masteringemacs.org/book">my book on Emacs</a> is also on sale: 29% off.</p><p>Before I go into the specifics of every minor item, a quick summary of what I think are the major highlights of Emacs 29.1:</p><dl><dt>Official tree-sitter support</dt><dd><p>Tree-sitter is a third-party library that parses your text (usually code, but also things like Markdown) into a <em>concrete syntax tree</em>. It’s one of the hallmark features in Emacs 29, though it is optional for now.</p><p>I have written extensively about tree sitter. If you’re new, and wondering why you should care, read my article on <a href="https://www.masteringemacs.org/article/tree-sitter-complications-of-parsing-languages">tree-sitter and the complications of parsing languages</a>.</p><p>Briefly, a concrete syntax tree is the distillation of your text or code, and so it’s better than regular expressions and <em>ad hoc</em> snippets of code at extracting meaning from your code. It offers better font locking (syntax highlighting); correct and more precise indentation; and limitless potential to extract syntactically interesting elements from your code. That means you can do <a href="https://www.masteringemacs.org/article/combobulate-structured-movement-editing-treesitter">structured movement and editing with tree-sitter</a>, as my package Combobulate aims to do, in the vein of paredit and similar tools.</p><p>Installing tree-sitter is not straight forward, at least until your package manager starts shipping Emacs 29 with tree sitter support. My article on <a href="https://www.masteringemacs.org/article/how-to-get-started-tree-sitter">how to get started with tree-sitter</a> is a good place to start if you’re using Linux.</p></dd><dt>EGlot, the Language Server Client</dt><dd><p>EGlot, the leaner complement to the fully-featured LSP-mode, is now built into Emacs. It should work out of the box. Just type <code>M-x eglot</code> in a buffer to get started.</p></dd><dt>Use-package</dt><dd><p>I wrote about <a href="https://www.masteringemacs.org/article/spotlight-use-package-a-declarative-configuration-tool">use-package, a declarative configuration tool</a> back when it came out. That was a decade ago, almost. It’s finally in Emacs, which is a good thing indeed.</p><p>It’s an easier and more expressive way of sharing Emacs configuration snippets, and knowing it’s built in just makes everything much easier.</p></dd><dt>Better long line support</dt><dd><p>There have been, ah, several bites at this rather bitter cherry over the years.</p><p>Emacs gums up on very long lines. To say it’s infuriating would be an understatement. I’ve been caught out by this a million times. Sometimes I have to kill Emacs as it’s desperately trying to append to the same, long line of text.</p><p>It’s still not <em>solved</em>, but it <em>is</em> a lot better. More on that below.</p></dd><dt>Native SQLite Support</dt><dd><p>SQLite support, in one form or another, has been around for a while. Now you can legitimately compile Emacs with sqlite support, which is a large step forward.</p><p>As much as we like to delude ourselves into thinking that unstructured orgmode text, or even s-expressions, represent the pinnacle of text editing and the acme of scrappy hackerdom, that mantra does come with a significant penalty to performance. Ask anyone with very large org mode files or someone who wants to fast, random access to clown-sized s-expression trees. I’m sure we’ll see a much larger effort towards representing – yes, indeed, the whole point of Emacs – text in buffers as we know it, but with a fast query engine and efficient storage medium in the backend. The two need not be mutually exclusive.</p></dd><dt>Changing the init directory</dt><dd><p>You can now instruct Emacs to read its initialization from another directory from the command line. Hugely useful if you’re using and testing multiple Emacs versions at the same time.</p></dd><dt>Pixel Scroll Precision Mode</dt><dd><p>You can enable <code>M-x pixel-scroll-precision-mode</code> and get smooth scrolling like you do in other programs.</p></dd></dl><h2 id="installation-changes-in-emacs-29.1">Installation Changes in Emacs 29.1</h2><pre><code>Ahead-of-time native compilation can now be requested via configure.
Use '--with-native-compilation=aot' to request that all the Lisp files
in the Emacs tree should be natively compiled ahead of time.  (This is
slow on most machines.)

This feature existed in Emacs 28.1, but was less easy to request.</code></pre><p>Native compilation was the marquee feature in Emacs 28. It uses GCC’s libgccjit to add just-in-time compilation for all elisp code, resulting in – usually – greatly improved performance. My article, <a href="https://www.masteringemacs.org/article/speed-up-emacs-libjansson-native-elisp-compilation">Speed up Emacs with libjansson and native elisp compilation</a>, has all the gory details.</p><p>This new switch is, as it says, really just a way of front loading the (frustrating to some, but I do not mind) elisp compilation that usually runs in the background in Emacs. You could tell it to do this before also, but it was admittedly harder.</p><p>The thing is, native compilation is only run once; once it’s done, it won’t run again unless the source file changes.</p><p>So, if you want to do it all up front while you’re building Emacs from source, you can with this switch.</p><pre><code>Emacs can be built with the tree-sitter parsing library.
This library, together with separate grammar libraries for each
language, provides incremental parsing capabilities for several
popular programming languages and other formatted files.  Emacs built
with this library offers major modes, described elsewhere in this
file, that are based on the tree-sitter's parsers.  If you have the
tree-sitter library installed, the configure script will automatically
include it in the build; use '--without-tree-sitter' at configure time
to disable that.

Emacs modes based on the tree-sitter library require an additional
grammar library for each mode.  These grammar libraries provide the
tree-sitter library with language-specific lexical analysis and
parsing capabilities, and are developed separately from the
tree-sitter library itself.  If you don't have a grammar library
required by some Emacs major mode, and your distro doesn't provide it
as an installable package, you can compile and install such a library
yourself.  Many libraries can be downloaded from the tree-sitter site:

    https://github.com/tree-sitter

Emacs provides a user command, 'treesit-install-language-grammar',
that automates the download and build process of a grammar library.
It prompts for the language, the URL of the language grammar's VCS
repository, and then uses the installed C/C++ compiler to build the
library and install it.

You can also do this manually.  To compile such a library after
cloning its Git repository, compile the files "scanner.c" and
"parser.c" (sometimes named "scanner.cc" and "parser.cc") in the "src"
subdirectory of the library's source tree using the C or C++ compiler,
then link these two files into a shared library named
"libtree-sitter-LANG.so" ("libtree-sitter-LANG.dll" on MS-Windows,
"libtree-sitter-LANG.dylib" on macOS), where LANG is the name of the
language supported by the grammar as it is expected by the Emacs major
mode (for example, "c" for 'c-ts-mode', "cpp" for 'c++-ts-mode',
"python" for 'python-ts-mode', etc.).  Then place the shared library
you've built in the same directory where you keep the other shared
libraries used by Emacs, or in the "tree-sitter" subdirectory of your
'user-emacs-directory', or in a directory mentioned in the variable
'treesit-extra-load-path'.

You only need to install language grammar libraries required by the
Emacs modes you will use, as Emacs loads these libraries only when the
corresponding mode is turned on in some buffer for the first time in
an Emacs session.

We generally recommend to use the latest versions of grammar libraries
available from their sites, as these libraries are in constant
development and occasionally add features and fix important bugs to
follow the advances in the programming languages they support.</code></pre><p>As I recommended in the beginning, my article on <a href="https://www.masteringemacs.org/article/how-to-get-started-tree-sitter">installing tree-sitter</a> is a good place to start if you’re unfamiliar with the finer points of installing tree-sitter. Doubly so for the shared libraries you need for the languages you want tree-sitter to use. I demonstrate how you can both compile from source, but also download pre-compiled binaries. The latter is especially important for OSes like Windows where you may not have the tooling required to do this yourself.</p><p>It’s… a significant barrier to entry, in my opinion, to require all this work before you can use tree-sitter. The maintainers’ reasons for not shipping the libraries is also reasonable: it’s not in the scope of the GNU Emacs project to lug around a bunch of libraries written by third-party sources.</p><p>Having said that, the frustration of setting it up is somewhat alleviated by the helpful <code>treesit-install-language-grammar</code> function, as it’ll attempt to guess the target and compiler switches required and automatically check out the tree-sitter libraries from Ghit. But, still, it could be easier.</p><p>So, yeah, again: read my article where I cover all the gotchas and things you need to know. This sort of stuff is the prize you get for going through with it all:</p><figure>
<img src="https://www.masteringemacs.org/static/uploads/combobulate/expand-region.gif" alt="">
<figcaption>My package, <a href="https://www.masteringemacs.org/article/combobulate-structured-movement-editing-treesitter">Combobulate</a>, adds advanced editing and movement using tree-sitter. This is Combobulate's expand region feature, bound to <code>M-h</code>.</figcaption>
</figure><p>Thanks to tree-sitter you can have crisp and clear “expand region” functionality that’ll correctly mark the boundaries of each syntactic unit.</p><pre><code>Emacs can be built with built-in support for accessing SQLite databases.
This uses the popular sqlite3 library, and can be disabled by using
the '--without-sqlite3' option to the 'configure' script.</code></pre><p>With formal support of SQLite in Emacs, I can imagine that this’ll be one of those options most distro maintainers will enable by default, as SQLite’s widely used in most distros already. That’s good new for everyone: SQLite will find a place in all manner of places in Emacs over time.</p><p>All we need now is a nice, ergonomic and Lispy query builder layer on top. Any takers?</p><pre><code>Support for the WebP image format.
This support is built by default when the libwebp library is
available, and includes support for animated WebP images.  To disable
WebP support, use the '--without-webp' configure flag.  Image
specifiers can now use ':type webp'.</code></pre><p>Useful if you do a lot of web development where that is becoming a common file format. I cannot divine how this integrates with the imagemagick configure flag, though. The implication is it is not required at all or that it even works with imagemagick.</p><pre><code>Emacs now installs the ".pdmp" file using a unique fingerprint in the name.
The file is typically installed using a file name akin to
"...dir/libexec/emacs/29.1/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu/emacs-&lt;fingerprint&gt;.pdmp".
If a constant file name is required, the file can be renamed to
"emacs.pdmp", and Emacs will find it during startup anyway.</code></pre><p>This should be of interest to few, except maybe distro maintainers.</p><pre><code>Emacs on X now uses XInput 2 for input events.
If your X server has support and you have the XInput 2 development
headers installed, Emacs will use the X Input Extension for handling
input.  If this causes problems, you can configure Emacs with the
option '--without-xinput2' to disable this support.

'(featurep 'xinput2)' can be used to test for the presence of XInput 2
support from Lisp programs.</code></pre><p>I reported a couple of bugs against this (which were fixed within the hour!) particularly around mouse wheel scrolling not working well. If you do compile Emacs with this flag, as I have and still do, I’d keep an eye on weird input event regressions. Make sure you report them.</p><pre><code>Emacs can now be optionally built with the Cairo XCB backend.
Configure Emacs with the '--with-cairo-xcb' option to use the Cairo
XCB backend; the default is not to use it.  This backend makes Emacs
moderately faster when running over X connections with high latency,
but is currently known to crash when Emacs repeatedly closes and opens
a display connection to the same terminal; this could happen, for
example, if you repeatedly visit files via emacsclient in a single
client frame, each time deleting the frame with 'C-x C-c'.</code></pre><p>Cairo’s an open source 2d rendering library that Emacs added support for some versions ago.</p><pre><code>Emacs now supports being built with pure GTK.
To use this option, make sure the GTK 3 (version 3.22.23 or later) and
Cairo development files are installed, and configure Emacs with the
option '--with-pgtk'.  Unlike the default X and GTK build, the
resulting Emacs binary will work on any underlying window system
supported by GDK, such as Wayland and Broadway.  We recommend that you
use this configuration only if you are running a window system other
than X that's supported by GDK.  Running this configuration on X is
known to have problems, such as undesirable frame positioning and
various issues with keyboard input of sequences such as 'C-;' and
'C-S-u'.  Running this on WSL is also known to have problems.

Note that, unlike the X build of Emacs, the PGTK build cannot
automatically switch to text-mode interface (thus emulating '-nw') if
it cannot determine the default display; it will instead complain and
ask you to invoke it with the explicit '-nw' option.</code></pre><p>The warning about not running Emacs built with <code>--with-pgtk</code> under X cannot be understated. You really shouldn’t do that, though you’ll occasionally see references to people insisting that you build Emacs with it, regardless of the window system you’re using. If you’re not using Wayland/Broadway, you probably do not care about this.</p><pre><code>Emacs has been ported to the Haiku operating system.
The configuration process should automatically detect and build for
Haiku.  There is also an optional window-system port to Haiku, which
can be enabled by configuring Emacs with the option '--with-be-app',
which will require the Haiku Application Kit development headers and a
C++ compiler to be present on your system.  If Emacs is not built with
the option '--with-be-app', the resulting Emacs will only run in
text-mode terminals.

To enable Cairo support, ensure that the Cairo and FreeType
development files are present on your system, and configure Emacs with
'--with-be-cairo'.

Unlike X, there is no compile-time option to enable or disable
double-buffering; it is always enabled.  To disable it, change the
frame parameter 'inhibit-double-buffering' instead.</code></pre><pre><code>Emacs no longer reduces the size of the Japanese dictionary.
Building Emacs includes generation of a Japanese dictionary, which is
used by Japanese input methods.  Previously, the build included a step
of reducing the size of this dictionary's vocabulary.  This vocabulary
reduction is now optional, by default off.  If you need the Emacs
build to include the vocabulary reduction, configure Emacs with the
option '--with-small-ja-dic'.  In an Emacs source tree already
configured without that option, you can force the vocabulary reduction
by saying

    make -C leim generate-ja-dic JA_DIC_NO_REDUCTION_OPTION=''

after deleting "lisp/leim/ja-dic/ja-dic.el".</code></pre><pre><code>The docstrings of preloaded files are not in "etc/DOC" any more.
Instead, they're fetched as needed from the corresponding ".elc"
files, as was already the case for all the non-preloaded files.</code></pre><h2 id="startup-changes-in-emacs-29.1">Startup Changes in Emacs 29.1</h2><pre><code>'--batch' and '--script' now adjust the garbage collection levels.
These switches now set 'gc-cons-percentage' to 1.0 (up from the
default of 0.1).  This means that batch processes will typically use
more memory than before, but use less time doing garbage collection.
Batch jobs that are supposed to run for a long time should adjust the
limit back down again.</code></pre><p>That’s excellent news and it cuts out the middle-man of having to manually <code>let</code>-bind these variables if you were doing complex things in batch mode.</p><pre><code>Emacs can now be used more easily in an executable script.
If you start an executable script with

    #!/usr/bin/emacs -x

Emacs will start without reading any init files (like with '--quick'),
and then execute the rest of the script file as Emacs Lisp.  When it
reaches the end of the script, Emacs will exit with an exit code from
the value of the final form.</code></pre><p>I’ll have to experiment and see if I can elide the need for <code>bash</code> in my tool <code>ezf</code>, which is an Emacs-only version of the <code>fzf</code> tool. See: <a href="https://www.masteringemacs.org/article/fuzzy-finding-emacs-instead-of-fzf">Fuzzy Finding with Emacs Instead of fzf</a>.</p><pre><code>Emacs now supports setting 'user-emacs-directory' via '--init-directory'.
Use the '--init-directory' command-line option to set
'user-emacs-directory'.</code></pre><p>Wonderful news for those of us who have to test our packages using various Emacs versions and user configurations.</p><pre><code>Emacs now has a '--fingerprint' option.
This will output a string identifying the current Emacs build, and exit.</code></pre><p>Useful if you run Emacs in CI, I guess.</p><pre><code>New hook 'after-pdump-load-hook'.
This is run at the end of the Emacs startup process, and is meant to
be used to reinitialize data structures that would normally be done at
load time.</code></pre><p>This is unlikely to be of use to anyone except elisp grognards doing very particular things.</p><h3 id="native-compilation">Native Compilation</h3><pre><code>New command 'native-compile-prune-cache'.
This command deletes old subdirectories of the eln cache (but not the
ones for the current Emacs version).  Note that subdirectories of the
system directory where the "*.eln" files are installed (usually, the
last entry in 'native-comp-eln-load-path') are not deleted.</code></pre><p>If you regularly rebuild Emacs from scratch, it’s probably worth enabling this.</p><pre><code>New function 'startup-redirect-eln-cache'.
This function can be called in your init files to change the
user-specific directory where Emacs stores the "*.eln" files produced
by native compilation of Lisp packages Emacs loads.  The default
eln cache directory is unchanged: it is the "eln-cache" subdirectory
of 'user-emacs-directory'.</code></pre><p>Files are put in your – usually <code>.emacs.d</code> – directory by default. If you dislike Emacs polluting that directory you can now change it.</p><h2 id="incompatible-changes-in-emacs-29.1">Incompatible changes in Emacs 29.1</h2><pre><code>The image commands have changed key bindings.
In previous Emacs versions, the '+', '-' and 'r' keys were bound when
point was over an image.  In Emacs 29.1, additional commands have been
added, and this made it more likely that users would trigger the image
commands by mistake.  To avoid this, all image commands have been
moved to the 'i' prefix keymap, so '+' is now 'i +', '-' is now 'i -',
and 'r' is now 'i r'.  In addition, these commands are now repeating,
so you can rotate an image twice by saying 'i r r', for instance.</code></pre><p>It’s not clear, but all the key bindings (incl. the new ones) now live under <code>i</code>. See <code>M-x describe-keymap image-slice-map</code>.</p><pre><code>Emacs now picks the correct coding-system for X input methods.
Previously, Emacs would use 'locale-coding-system' for input
methods, which could in some circumstances be incorrect, especially
when the input method chose to fall back to some other coding system.

Emacs now automatically detects the coding-system used by input
methods, and uses that to decode input in preference to the value of
'locale-coding-system'.  This unfortunately means that users who have
changed the coding system used to decode X keyboard input must adjust
their customizations to 'locale-coding-system' to the variable
'x-input-coding-system' instead.</code></pre><p>Not sure how many people this is likely to affect, but fixing this is nice. I do feel the variable is a little bit mis-named now, as I would not ordinarily connect locale (be it in the i18n or unix LOCALE sense of the word) to my X windows keyboard input.</p><pre><code>Bookmarks no longer include context for encrypted files.
If you're visiting an encrypted file, setting a bookmark no longer
includes excerpts from that buffer in the bookmarks file.  This is
implemented by the new hook 'bookmark-inhibit-context-functions',
where packages can register a function which returns non-nil for file
names to be excluded from adding such excerpts.</code></pre><p>Heh. Whoops. It’s easy to see how it could happen due to how bookmarking is implemented in Emacs. The perils of having so many disparate and tangled systems all working together in (mostly) harmony.</p><pre><code>'show-paren-mode' is now disabled in 'special-mode' buffers.
In Emacs versions previous to Emacs 28.1, 'show-paren-mode' defaulted
off.  In Emacs 28.1, the mode was switched on in all buffers.  In
Emacs 29.1, this was changed to be switched on in all editing-related
buffers, but not in buffers that inherit from 'special-mode'.  To go
back to how things worked in Emacs 28.1, put the following in your
init file:

    (setopt show-paren-predicate t)</code></pre><p>Unlikely to bother too many people in <em>theory</em> when you read this, but it also affects Help and Info buffers! So if you want it back in those, you clearly have to re-set it for all special buffers.</p><pre><code>Explicitly-set read-only state is preserved when reverting a buffer.
If you use the 'C-x C-q' command to change the read-only state of the
buffer and then revert it, Emacs would previously use the file
permission bits to determine whether the buffer should be read-only
after reverting the buffer.  Emacs now remembers the decision made in
'C-x C-q'.</code></pre><p>That’s a handy fix for me if you also use TRAMP or such-like to view files that you only have read permissions to look at. Now you can have auto revert on and yet still apply things like <code>M-x flush-lines</code> without losing the read only flag on revert.</p><pre><code>The Gtk selection face is no longer used for the region.
The combination of a Gtk-controlled background and a foreground color
controlled by the internal Emacs machinery led to low-contrast faces
in common default setups.  Emacs now uses the same 'region' face on
Gtk and non-Gtk setups.</code></pre><p>Never spotted this issue myself, though it’s nice to see these little burrs get filed off, one by one.</p><pre><code>'C-h f' and 'C-h x' may now require confirmation when you press 'RET'.
If the text in the minibuffer cannot be completed to a single function
or command, typing 'RET' will not automatically complete to the shortest
candidate, but will instead ask for confirmation.  Typing 'TAB' will
complete as much as possible, and another 'TAB' will show all the
possible completions.  This allows you to insist on the functions name
even if Help doesn't appear to know about it, by confirming with a
second 'RET'.</code></pre><p>I’m unclear if this is a generic change to the completion system or if it’s limited to just those two commands.</p><pre><code>'w' ('dired-copy-filename-as-kill') has changed behavior.
If there are several files marked, file names containing space and
quote characters will be quoted "like this".</code></pre><p>Good. I’ve been caught out by that bug before.</p><pre><code>The 'd' command now more consistently skips dot files.
In previous Emacs versions, commands like 'C-u 10 d' would put the "D"
mark on the next ten files, no matter whether they were dot files
(i.e., "." and "..") or not, while marking the next ten lines with the
mouse (in 'transient-mark-mode') and then hitting 'd' would skip dot
files.  These now work equivalently.</code></pre><p>Another nice fix. Imagine the panic of seeing <code>..</code> or <code>.</code> marked D after you’ve triggered the delete action…</p><pre><code>'/ a' in "*Packages*" buffer now limits by archive name(s) instead of regexp.</code></pre><p>I don’t have any strong feelings about this. Is regexp search ever really useful in a repository where you’re looking for things by name? Word stemming and other such techniques would be a more useful feature than regexp. I can’t imagine too many people mind this.</p><pre><code>Setting the goal columns now also affects '&lt;prior&gt;' and '&lt;next&gt;'.
Previously, 'C-x C-n' only affected 'next-line' and 'previous-line',
but it now also affects 'scroll-up-command' and 'scroll-down-command'.</code></pre><p>Goal columns change the default column offset point is placed at on a line. Set it to 10, and point is set at the 10th column position when you move up or down a line. All this does is make it so your page up / down keys also respect it.</p><p>(You can unset a goal column with <code>C-0 C-x C-n</code>.)</p><pre><code>Isearch in "*Help*" and "*info*" now char-folds quote characters by default.
This means that you can say 'C-s `foo' (GRAVE ACCENT) if the buffer
contains "‘foo" (LEFT SINGLE QUOTATION MARK) and the like.  These
quotation characters look somewhat similar in some fonts.  To switch
this off, disable the new 'isearch-fold-quotes-mode' minor mode.</code></pre><p>This is useful outside those buffers, of course. If you work with prose where the unicode glyphs are common, you can instead search for their elementary ASCII cousins instead and still match. Turn it on – why not?</p><pre><code>Sorting commands no longer necessarily change modification status.
In earlier Emacs versions, commands like 'sort-lines' would always
change buffer modification status to "modified", whether they changed
something in the buffer or not.  This has been changed: the buffer is
marked as modified only if the sorting ended up actually changing the
contents of the buffer.</code></pre><p>You can still toggle a buffer’s modification manually with <code>M-~</code> though.</p><pre><code>'string-lines' handles trailing newlines differently.
It no longer returns an empty final string if the string ends with a
newline.</code></pre><pre><code>'TAB' and '&lt;backtab&gt;' are now bound in 'button-map'.
This means that if point is on a button, 'TAB' will take you to the
next button, even if the mode has bound it to something else.  This
also means that 'TAB' on a button in an 'outline-minor-mode' heading
will move point instead of collapsing the outline.</code></pre><p>Nice change. Buttons aren’t just <em>buttons</em>, they are often clickable things generally speaking. Hyperlinks often also fall under this category.</p><pre><code>'outline-minor-mode-cycle-map' is now parent of 'outline-minor-mode'.
Instead of adding text property 'keymap' with 'outline-minor-mode-cycle'
on outline headings in 'outline-minor-mode', the keymap
'outline-minor-mode-cycle' is now active in the whole buffer.
But keybindings in 'outline-minor-mode-cycle' still take effect
only on outline headings because they are bound with the help of
'outline-minor-mode-cycle--bind' that checks if point is on a heading.</code></pre><p>Mechanical change that is unlikely to affect day-to-day use if you use outline. I suspect this is mostly done to make it easier to search keymaps or perhaps fix some obscure keyboard events that don’t activate property keymaps.</p><pre><code>'Info-default-directory-list' is no longer populated at Emacs startup.
If you have code in your init file that removes directories from

Functions like 'current-time' now yield '(TICKS . HZ)' timestamps if
this new variable is nil.  The variable defaults to t, which means
these functions default to timestamps of the forms '(HI LO US PS)',
'(HI LO US)' or '(HI LO)', which are less regular and less efficient.
This is part of a long-planned change first documented in Emacs 27.
Developers are encouraged to test timestamp-related code with this

1. To use 'display-line-numbers-mode', add something like this to your

   your Init file, in addition to any existing customizations:

Obsolete in Emacs usually means that it’ll get removed <em>eventually</em> or, indeed, never; it comes down to how many flare-ups there are on the mailing list.</p><p>Still, Emacs’s many dusty corners remain, to me, a fun time capsule and a look back at how things were. We shouldn’t rush into removing things just because they’re mostly forgotten.</p><pre><code>The quickurl.el library is now obsolete.

This is actually a bugfix, since this is how 'utf-8-auto' was
documented from day one; it just didn't behave according to
documentation.  It turns out some Lisp programs were using this
coding-system on the wrong assumption that the "auto" part means some
automagic handling of the end-of-line (EOL) format conversion; those
programs will now start to fail, because BOM signature in UTF-8 encoded
text is rarely expected.  That is the reason we mention this bugfix
here.

In general, this coding-system should probably never be used for
encoding, only for decoding.</code></pre><h2 id="changes-in-emacs-29.1">Changes in Emacs 29.1</h2><pre><code>New user option 'major-mode-remap-alist' to specify favorite major modes.

The display of long lines has been optimized, and Emacs should no
longer choke when a buffer on display contains long lines.  The
variable 'long-line-threshold' controls whether and when these display
optimizations are in effect.

A companion variable 'large-hscroll-threshold' controls when another
set of display optimizations are in effect, which are aimed
specifically at speeding up display of long lines that are truncated
on display.

If you still experience slowdowns while editing files with long lines,
this may be due to line truncation, or to one of the enabled minor
modes, or to the current major mode.  Try turning off line truncation
with 'C-x x t', or try disabling all known slow minor modes with
'M-x so-long-minor-mode', or try disabling both known slow minor modes
and the major mode with 'M-x so-long-mode', or visit the file with
'M-x find-file-literally' instead of the usual 'C-x C-f'.

In buffers in which these display optimizations are in effect, the
'fontification-functions', 'pre-command-hook' and 'post-command-hook'
hooks are executed on a narrowed portion of the buffer, whose size is
controlled by the variables 'long-line-optimizations-region-size' and
'long-line-optimizations-bol-search-limit', as if they were in a
'with-restriction' form.  This may, in particular, cause occasional
mis-fontifications in these buffers.  Modes which are affected by
these optimizations and by the fact that the buffer is narrowed,
should adapt and either modify their algorithm so as not to expect the
entire buffer to be accessible, or, if accessing outside of the
narrowed region doesn't hurt performance, use the
'without-restriction' form to temporarily lift the restriction and
access portions of the buffer outside of the narrowed region.

The new function 'long-line-optimizations-p' returns non-nil when
these optimizations are in effect in the current buffer.</code></pre><p>So long, <code>so-long-mode</code>. Having said that, I’m still getting coughs and sputters on long lines, on occasion. But it’s a marked improvement over older Emacsen. You should follow the advice given above and experiment to find the right settings for you.</p><pre><code>New command to change the font size globally.
To increase the font size, type 'C-x C-M-+' or 'C-x C-M-='; to
decrease it, type 'C-x C-M--'; to restore the font size, type 'C-x
C-M-0'.  The final key in these commands may be repeated without the
leading 'C-x' and without the modifiers, e.g. 'C-x C-M-+ C-M-+ C-M-+'
and 'C-x C-M-+ + +' increase the font size by three steps.  When
'mouse-wheel-mode' is enabled, 'C-M-wheel-up' and 'C-M-wheel-down' also
increase and decrease the font size globally.  Additionally, the
user option 'global-text-scale-adjust-resizes-frames' controls whether
the frames are resized when the font size is changed.</code></pre><p>You can already use <code>C-x C-=</code> and friends to adjust a single buffer, so it’s nice to see it extended to all of Emacs. Great for projectors and screen sharing.</p><pre><code>New config variable 'syntax-wholeline-max' to reduce the cost of long lines.
This variable is used by some operations (mostly syntax-propertization
and font-locking) to treat lines longer than this variable as if they
were made up of various smaller lines.  This can help reduce the
slowdowns seen in buffers made of a single long line, but can also
cause misbehavior in the presence of such long lines (though most of
that misbehavior should usually be limited to mis-highlighting).  You
can recover the previous behavior with:

    (setq syntax-wholeline-max most-positive-fixnum)</code></pre><p>Definitely worth playing with if you have performance issues. It’s set to 10,000 which I think sounds like a reasonable default. Syntax here refers to a huge range of commands, many of them you probably don’t know of, like <code>parse-partial-sexp</code> and <code>syntax-ppss</code>. Needless to say, everything from font locking to navigation and editing are affected in one way or another.</p><pre><code>New bindings in 'find-function-setup-keys' for 'find-library'.

Emacs allows different completion predicates to be used with 'M-x'
(i.e., 'execute-extended-command') via the

'M-X' (note upper case X) command, which only displays commands
especially relevant to the current buffer.  Emacs now allows toggling
between these modes while the user is inputting a command by hitting
'M-X' while in the minibuffer.</code></pre><p>Nice change. The <code>M-X</code> (note case) key binding filters the list of commands to the ones deemed “relevant” to your active buffer.

If you use the mark commands to select stuff, like <code>C-M-SPC</code> or <code>M-@</code>, then you’d delete the text if you typed a character. With this option, it only happens if you select by some other means.</p><pre><code>New user option 'switch-to-prev-buffer-skip-regexp'.
This should be a regexp or a list of regexps; buffers whose names
match those regexps will be ignored by 'switch-to-prev-buffer' and
'switch-to-next-buffer'.</code></pre><p>If you use either of these commands (<code>C-x C-&lt;right/left&gt;</code>) to navigate, you’d probably want to add all the flotsam and jetsam you don’t want to switch to.</p><pre><code>New command 'rename-visited-file'.
This command renames the file visited by the current buffer by moving
it to a new name or location, and also makes the buffer visit this new
file.</code></pre><p>Yep. Emacs has never had the ability to rename a file <em>in-situ</em> from the buffer. Until someone pointed that out to me I thought it did. But then I remember I rename everything in dired — and seemingly so did everyone else who used Emacs up until now when that command was added.</p><p>A long, over-due command.</p><pre><code>The entries following the buffers in the "Buffers" menu can now be altered.
Change the 'menu-bar-buffers-menu-command-entries' variable to alter
the entries that follow the buffer list.</code></pre><p>You can customize Emacs’s menu entries by altering this variable.</p><pre><code>'delete-process' is now a command.
When called interactively, it will kill the process running in the
current buffer (if any).  This can be useful if you have runaway
output in the current buffer (from a process or a network connection),
and want to stop it.</code></pre><p>Very useful. You should know about <code>M-x list-processes</code> also.</p><pre><code>New command 'restart-emacs'.
This is like 'save-buffers-kill-emacs', but instead of just killing
the current Emacs process at the end, it starts a new Emacs process
(using the same command line arguments as the running Emacs process).
'kill-emacs' and 'save-buffers-kill-emacs' have also gained new
optional arguments to restart instead of just killing the current
process.</code></pre><p>Nice to have.</p><h2 id="drag-and-drop">Drag and Drop</h2><p>Just as a quick side note: you can drag and drop a bunch of stuff into Emacs and have it do the right thing. Files get opened, for instance, if you drag them into Emacs. If you drag them into message buffer you’ll instead <em>attach</em> them as a file. Great if you do email in Emacs like I do.</p><pre><code>New user option 'mouse-drag-mode-line-buffer'.
If non-nil, dragging on the buffer name part of the mode-line will
drag the buffer's associated file to other programs.  This option is
currently only available on X, Haiku and Nextstep (GNUstep or macOS).</code></pre><p>Neat. No way I’ll ever remember that, but it’s a nice addition.</p><pre><code>New user option 'mouse-drag-and-drop-region-cross-program'.
If non-nil, this option allows dragging text in the region from Emacs
to another program.</code></pre><p>That I <em>will</em> remember though.</p><pre><code>New user option 'mouse-drag-and-drop-region-scroll-margin'.
If non-nil, this option allows scrolling a window while dragging text
around without a scroll wheel.</code></pre><p>Another one of those features people who move to Emacs come to depend on.</p><pre><code>The value of 'mouse-drag-copy-region' can now be the symbol 'non-empty'.
This prevents mouse drag gestures from putting empty strings onto the
kill ring.</code></pre><p>You’d probably want to set this to t.</p><pre><code>New user options 'dnd-indicate-insertion-point' and 'dnd-scroll-margin'.
These options allow adjusting point and scrolling a window when
dragging items from another program.</code></pre><pre><code>The X Direct Save (XDS) protocol is now supported.
This means dropping an image or file link from programs such as
Firefox will no longer create a temporary file in a random directory,
instead asking you where to save the file first.</code></pre><p>Never heard of this protocol before, but it reads like a fine improvement over the copy-to-temp approach Emacs employed before.</p><pre><code>New user option 'record-all-keys'.
If non-nil, this option will force recording of all input keys,
including those typed in response to passwords prompt (this was the
previous behavior).  The default is nil, which inhibits recording of
passwords.</code></pre><p>Keep in mind Emacs still records most stuff you type. See the lossage for an example: <code>C-h l</code>.</p><pre><code>New function 'command-query'.
This function makes its argument command prompt the user for
confirmation before executing.</code></pre><pre><code>The 'disabled' property of a command's symbol can now be a list.
The first element of the list should be the symbol 'query', which will
cause the command disabled this way prompt the user with a y/n or a
yes/no question before executing.  The new function 'command-query' is
a convenient method of making commands disabled in this way.</code></pre><p>There are a handful of commands marked disabled in Emacs as they’re confusing to beginners. You might’ve run into the prompts when you typed one of them.</p><pre><code>'count-words' will now report buffer totals if given a prefix.
Without a prefix, it will only report the word count for the narrowed
part of the buffer.</code></pre><pre><code>'count-words' will now report sentence count when used interactively.</code></pre><p>Cue the interminable arguments over what constitutes a sentence.</p><pre><code>New user option 'set-message-functions'.
It allows more flexible control of how echo-area messages are displayed
by adding functions to this list.  The default value is a list of one
element: 'set-minibuffer-message', which displays echo-area messages
at the end of the minibuffer text when the minibuffer is active.
Other useful functions include 'inhibit-message', which allows
specifying, via 'inhibit-message-regexps', the list of messages whose
display should be inhibited; and 'set-multi-message' that accumulates
recent messages and displays them stacked together.</code></pre><p>Nifty new features. The echo area is a busy area now, particularly if you’re using a lot of tools, all vying for your attention. Maybe give the multi-message approach a shot if you’re missing messages? I wrote about a similar problem with Eldoc and competing messages. <a href="https://www.masteringemacs.org/article/seamlessly-merge-multiple-documentation-sources-eldoc">Seamlessly Merge Multiple Documentation Sources with Eldoc</a>.</p><pre><code>New user option 'find-library-include-other-files'.
If set to nil, commands like 'find-library' will only include library
files in the completion candidates.  The default is t, which preserves
previous behavior, whereby non-library files could also be included.</code></pre><pre><code>New command 'sqlite-mode-open-file' for examining an sqlite3 file.
This uses the new 'sqlite-mode' which allows listing the tables in a
DB file, and examining and modifying the columns and the contents of
those tables.</code></pre><p>Nifty!</p><pre><code>'write-file' will now copy some file mode bits.
If the current buffer is visiting a file that is executable, the
'C-x C-w' command will now make the new file executable, too.</code></pre><p>Along the same lines, you should consider the switch to <a href="https://www.masteringemacs.org/article/script-files-executable-automatically">make script files executable automatically</a>.</p><pre><code>New user option 'process-error-pause-time'.
This determines how long to pause Emacs after a process
filter/sentinel error has been handled.</code></pre><p>If you regularly cancel out of compilation buffers or other processes and find the delay annoying, try setting it to 0.</p><pre><code>New faces for font-lock.
These faces are primarily meant for use with tree-sitter.  They are:
'font-lock-bracket-face', 'font-lock-delimiter-face',
'font-lock-escape-face', 'font-lock-function-call-face',
'font-lock-misc-punctuation-face', 'font-lock-number-face',
'font-lock-operator-face', 'font-lock-property-name-face',
'font-lock-property-use-face', 'font-lock-punctuation-face',
'font-lock-regexp-face', and 'font-lock-variable-use-face'.</code></pre><p>This is part of the tree-sitter changes. As TS allows for far more precise selection of syntactic constructs, it made sense to add a bunch of faces.</p><p>You’ll want to customize them to suit your needs.</p><pre><code>New face 'variable-pitch-text'.
This face is like 'variable-pitch' (from which it inherits), but is
slightly larger, which should help with the visual size differences
between the default, non-proportional font and proportional fonts when
mixed.</code></pre><pre><code>New face 'mode-line-active'.
This inherits from the 'mode-line' face, but is the face actually used
on the mode lines (along with 'mode-line-inactive').</code></pre><pre><code>New face attribute pseudo-value 'reset'.
This value stands for the value of the corresponding attribute of the
'default' face.  It can be used to reset attribute values produced by
inheriting from other faces.</code></pre><p>Useful if you want some, but not all, inheriting faces.</p><pre><code>New X resource "borderThickness".
This controls the thickness of the external borders of the menu bars
and pop-up menus.</code></pre><pre><code>New X resource "inputStyle".
This controls the style of the pre-edit and status areas of X input
methods.</code></pre><pre><code>New X resources "highlightForeground" and "highlightBackground".
Only in the Lucid build, this controls colors used for highlighted
menu item widgets.</code></pre><pre><code>On X, Emacs now tries to synchronize window resize with the window manager.
This leads to less flicker and empty areas of a frame being displayed
when a frame is being resized.  Unfortunately, it does not work on
some ancient buggy window managers, so if Emacs appears to freeze, but
is still responsive to input, you can turn it off by setting the X
resource "synchronizeResize" to "off".</code></pre><pre><code>On X, Emacs can optionally synchronize display with the graphics hardware.
When this is enabled by setting the X resource "synchronizeResize" to
"extended", frame content "tearing" is drastically reduced.  This is
only supported on the Motif, Lucid, and no-toolkit builds, and
requires an X compositing manager supporting the extended frame
synchronization protocol (see
https://fishsoup.net/misc/wm-spec-synchronization.html).

This behavior can be toggled on and off via the frame parameter
'use-frame-synchronization'.</code></pre><pre><code>New frame parameter 'alpha-background' and X resource "alphaBackground".
This controls the opacity of the text background when running on a
composited display.</code></pre><p>Party like it’s 1998. Remember back when everyone took screenshots of their KDE/GNOME/WindowMaker desktops and they all had that obligatory semi-translucent terminal window?</p><pre><code>New frame parameter 'shaded'.
With window managers which support this, it controls whether or not a
frame's contents will be hidden, leaving only the title bar on display.</code></pre><pre><code>New user option 'x-gtk-use-native-input'.
This controls whether or not GTK input methods are used by Emacs,
instead of XIM input methods.  Defaults to nil.</code></pre><pre><code>New user option 'use-system-tooltips'.
This controls whether to use the toolkit tooltips, or Emacs's own
native implementation of tooltips as small frames.  This option is
only meaningful if Emacs was built with GTK+, Nextstep, or Haiku
support, and defaults to t, which makes Emacs use the toolkit
tooltips.  The existing GTK-specific option
'x-gtk-use-system-tooltips' is now an alias of this new option.</code></pre><p>I long ago disabled tooltips and made them appear in the echo area instead:</p><pre><code>(tooltip-mode nil)
(setq tooltip-use-echo-area t)
(setq x-gtk-use-system-tooltips nil)</code></pre><pre><code>Non-native tooltips are now supported on Nextstep.
This means Emacs built with GNUstep or built on macOS is now able to
display different faces and images inside tooltips when the
'use-system-tooltips' user option is nil.</code></pre><pre><code>New minor mode 'pixel-scroll-precision-mode'.
When enabled, and if your mouse supports it, you can scroll the
display up or down at pixel resolution, according to what your mouse
wheel reports.  Unlike 'pixel-scroll-mode', this mode scrolls the
display pixel-by-pixel, as opposed to only animating line-by-line
scrolls.</code></pre><p>Pixel-perfect scrolling, at least in theory. On my computer it does act funny around large images, though this is mostly a limitation of Emacs’s display engine, more than the pixel scrolling.</p><h2 id="terminal-emacs">Terminal Emacs</h2><pre><code>Emacs will now use 24-bit colors on terminals that support "Tc" capability.
This is in addition to previously-supported ways of discovering 24-bit
color support: either via the "RGB" or "setf24" capabilities, or if
the 'COLORTERM' environment variable is set to the value "truecolor".</code></pre><p>Emacs has had 24-bit support for years, so this is really only about catching the tail end of termcaps.</p><pre><code>Select active regions with xterm selection support.
On terminals with xterm "setSelection" support, the active region may be
saved to the X primary selection, following the
'select-active-regions' variable.  This support is enabled when
'tty-select-active-regions' is non-nil.</code></pre><p>Worth setting to t if you prefer running Emacs in a GUI terminal.</p><pre><code>New command to set up display of unsupported characters.
The new command 'standard-display-by-replacement-char' produces Lisp
code that sets up the 'standard-display-table' to use a replacement
character for display of characters that the text-mode terminal
doesn't support.  This code is intended to be used in your init files.
This feature is most useful with the Linux console and similar
terminals, where Emacs has a reliable way of determining which
characters have glyphs in the font loaded into the terminal's memory.</code></pre><p>This is the default character to display if Emacs or you terminal cannot. If you have strong views on this, you should contemplate changing it.</p><pre><code>New functions to set terminal output buffer size.
The new functions 'tty--set-output-buffer-size' and
'tty--output-buffer-size' allow setting and retrieving the output
buffer size of a terminal device.  The default buffer size is and has
always been BUFSIZ, which is defined in your system's stdio.h.  When
you set a buffer size with 'tty--set-output-buffer-size', this also
prevents Emacs from explicitly flushing the tty output stream, except
at the end of display update.</code></pre><p>I’ve no opinion nor any wisdom to share as to why you’d want to change this. Keen to hear from people who do though.</p><h2 id="ert">ERT</h2><p>ERT is Emacs’s unit test framework.</p><pre><code>New ERT variables 'ert-batch-print-length' and 'ert-batch-print-level'.
These variables will override 'print-length' and 'print-level' when
printing Lisp values in ERT batch test results.</code></pre><pre><code>Redefining an ERT test in batch mode now signals an error.
Executing 'ert-deftest' with the same name as an existing test causes
the previous definition to be discarded, which was probably not
intended when this occurs in batch mode.  To remedy the error, rename
tests so that they all have unique names.</code></pre><pre><code>ERT can generate JUnit test reports.
When environment variable 'EMACS_TEST_JUNIT_REPORT' is set, ERT
generates a JUnit test report under this file name.  This is useful
for Emacs integration into CI/CD test environments.</code></pre><pre><code>Unbound test symbols now signal an 'ert-test-unbound' error.
This affects the 'ert-select-tests' function and its callers.</code></pre><h2 id="emoji">Emoji</h2><p>There’s a NEWS category just for Emoji now?</p><pre><code>Emacs now has several new methods for inserting Emoji.
The Emoji commands are under the new 'C-x 8 e' prefix.</code></pre><p>This is now the primary composition key for dealing with emoji.</p><pre><code>New command 'emoji-insert' (bound to 'C-x 8 e e' and 'C-x 8 e i').
This command guides you through various Emoji categories and
combinations in a graphical menu system.</code></pre><p><code>C-x 8 e e</code> opens a <a href="https://www.masteringemacs.org/article/introduction-magit-emacs-mode-git">Magit-style</a> popup using the now-builtin transient package. I think this is the first instance of using transient in Emacs?</p><pre><code>New command 'emoji-search' (bound to 'C-x 8 e s').
This command lets you search for and insert an Emoji based on names.</code></pre><p>Like <code>C-x 8 RET</code>, but the search space limited to just emoji.</p><pre><code>New command 'emoji-list' (bound to 'C-x 8 e l').
This command lists all Emoji (categorized by themes) in a special
buffer and lets you choose one of them to insert.</code></pre><p>Rather useful overview of smileys in a buffer. This is my preferred method for picking out emoji; note that the emoji are hyperlinked will insert the smiley at point.</p><pre><code>New command 'emoji-recent' (bound to 'C-x 8 e r').
This command lets you choose among the Emoji you have recently
inserted and insert it.</code></pre><pre><code>New command 'emoji-describe' (bound to 'C-x 8 e d').
This command will tell you the name of the Emoji at point.  (It also
works for non-Emoji characters.)</code></pre><p>It prints the unicode descriptor for the character at point. It’s also available in <code>C-u C-x =</code>.</p><pre><code>New commands 'emoji-zoom-increase' and 'emoji-zoom-decrease'.
These are bound to 'C-x 8 e +' and 'C-x 8 e -', respectively.  They
can be used on any character, but are mainly useful for Emoji.</code></pre><pre><code>New command 'emoji-zoom-reset'.
This is bound to 'C-x 8 e 0', and undoes any size changes performed by
'emoji-zoom-increase' and 'emoji-zoom-decrease'.</code></pre><pre><code>New input method 'emoji'.
This allows you to enter Emoji using short strings, eg ':face_palm:'
or ':scream:'.</code></pre><p>I think I wrote the first input method to insert Emoji. In fact, it was the upcoming emoji code in Emacs 29 that prompted me to blog about it: <a href="https://www.masteringemacs.org/article/inserting-emoji-input-methods">Inserting Emoji with Input Methods</a>.</p><p>Input methods are a nifty way of inserting chorded text. It’s a really pleasant way of inserting diacritics. If you’re unfamiliar with input methods, then check out <a href="https://www.masteringemacs.org/article/diacritics-in-emacs">Olé! Diacritics in Emacs</a>.</p><h2 id="help">Help</h2><pre><code>Variable values displayed by 'C-h v' in "*Help*" are now fontified.</code></pre><p>Yep. Big fan of this change.</p><pre><code>New user option 'help-clean-buttons'.
If non-nil, link buttons in "*Help*" buffers will have any surrounding
quotes removed.</code></pre><pre><code>'M-x apropos-variable' output now includes values of variables.
Such an apropos buffer is more easily viewed with outlining after
enabling 'outline-minor-mode' in 'apropos-mode'.</code></pre><p>Nifty change indeed. The apropos commands in Emacs should not be slept on.</p><pre><code>New docstring syntax to indicate that symbols shouldn't be links.
When displaying docstrings in "*Help*" buffers, strings that are
"`like-this'" are made into links (if they point to a bound
function/variable).  This can lead to false positives when talking
about values that are symbols that happen to have the same names as
functions/variables.  To inhibit this buttonification, use the new
"\\+`like-this'" syntax.</code></pre><pre><code>New user option 'help-window-keep-selected'.
If non-nil, commands to show the info manual and the source will reuse
the same window in which the "*Help*" buffer is shown.</code></pre><p>If you have strong preferences on where the windows should go, consider enabling this. Alternatively, my article on <a href="https://www.masteringemacs.org/article/demystifying-emacs-window-manager">Demystifying Emacs’s Window Manager</a> will teach you how to tame window management in Emacs.</p><pre><code>Commands like 'C-h f' have changed how they describe menu bindings.
For instance, previously a command might be described as having the
following bindings:

    It is bound to &lt;open&gt;, C-x C-f, &lt;menu-bar&gt; &lt;file&gt; &lt;new-file&gt;.

This has been changed to:

    It is bound to &lt;open&gt; and C-x C-f.
    It can also be invoked from the menu: File → Visit New File...</code></pre><pre><code>The 'C-h .' command now accepts a prefix argument.
'C-u C-h .' would previously inhibit displaying a warning message if
there was no local help at point.  This has been changed to call
'button-describe'/'widget-describe' and display button/widget help
instead.</code></pre><pre><code>New user option 'help-enable-variable-value-editing'.
If enabled, 'e' on a value in "*Help*" will pop you to a new buffer
where you can edit the value.  This is not enabled by default, because
it is easy to make an edit that yields an invalid result.</code></pre><p>There’s also <code>c</code> in a help window to open its customize window. That is perhaps of more use to most people.</p><pre><code>'C-h b' uses outlining by default.
Set 'describe-bindings-outline' to nil to get back the old behavior.</code></pre><p><code>C-h b</code> is a great command to know about. It displays all the pertinent bindings in a buffer.</p><pre><code>Jumping to function/variable source now saves mark before moving point.
Jumping to source from a "*Help*" buffer moves point when the source
buffer is already open.  Now, the old point is pushed onto mark ring.</code></pre><p>The global/local mark rings are worth learning about. They’re useful beacons for moving around in Emacs and they are always precipitated by a user-led action.</p><pre><code>New key bindings in "*Help*" buffers: 'n' and 'p'.
These will take you (respectively) to the next and previous "page".</code></pre><p>Page here meaning the old-fashioned concept in LISP and Emacs where the FORM FEED (<code>^L</code>) character is used to denote a page in code. That’s what all the <code>xxx-page</code> command do; they operate on them.</p><pre><code>'describe-char' now also outputs the name of Emoji sequences.</code></pre><pre><code>New key binding in "*Help*" buffer: 'I'.
This will take you to the Emacs Lisp manual entry for the item
displayed, if any.</code></pre><p>There is also <code>i</code> which goes to the manual; this, in turn, tries to find the elisp symbol reference.</p><pre><code>The 'C-h m' ('describe-mode') "*Help*" buffer has been reformatted.
It now only includes local minor modes at the start, and the global
minor modes are listed after the major mode.</code></pre><p>I like this change, as this is most likely what you want to look at first, anyway.</p><pre><code>The user option 'help-window-select' now affects apropos commands.
The apropos commands will now select the apropos window if
'help-window-select' is non-nil.</code></pre><p>See above regarding windows.</p><pre><code>'describe-keymap' now considers the symbol at point.
If the symbol at point is a keymap, 'describe-keymap' suggests it as
the default candidate.</code></pre><p>Always nice to see contextual completions. I wish more commands did this.</p><pre><code>New command 'help-quick' displays an overview of common commands.
The command pops up a buffer at the bottom of the screen with a few
helpful commands for various tasks.  You can toggle the display using
'C-h C-q'.</code></pre><p>This is cheat sheet for keyboard shortcuts. My view is still that you should use the menu bar until you’ve memorized the keys you’re ever likely to encounter in a cheat sheet.</p><pre><code>Emacs now comes with Org v9.6.
See the file "etc/ORG-NEWS" for user-visible changes in Org.</code></pre><h2 id="outline-mode">Outline Mode</h2><p>Outline is the progenitor to Org mode and works in much the same way. It is, of course, vastly simpler.</p><pre><code>Support for customizing the default visibility state of headings.
Customize the user option 'outline-default-state' to define what
headings will be visible initially, after Outline mode is turned on.
When the value is a number, the user option 'outline-default-rules'
determines the visibility of the subtree starting at the corresponding
level.  Values are provided to control showing a heading subtree
depending on whether the heading matches a regexp, or on whether its
subtree has long lines or is itself too long.</code></pre><h3 id="outline-minor-mode">Outline Minor Mode</h3><pre><code>New user option 'outline-minor-mode-use-buttons'.
If non-nil, Outline Minor Mode will use buttons to hide/show outlines
in addition to the ellipsis.  The default is nil, but in 'help-mode'
it has the value 'insert' that inserts the buttons directly into the
buffer, and you can use 'RET' to cycle outline visibility.  When
the value is 'in-margins', Outline Minor Mode uses the window margins
for buttons that hide/show outlines.</code></pre><pre><code>Buttons and headings now have their own keymaps.
'outline-button-icon-map', 'outline-overlay-button-map', and
'outline-inserted-button-map' are now available as defined keymaps
instead of being anonymous keymaps.</code></pre><h2 id="windows">Windows</h2><p>See my article on <a href="https://www.masteringemacs.org/article/demystifying-emacs-window-manager">Demystifying Emacs’s Window Manager</a> to truly understand how all these window changes below work, and how you can use them. The subject is well beyond the scope of this blog entry.</p><pre><code>New commands 'split-root-window-below' and 'split-root-window-right'.
These commands split the root window in two, and are bound to 'C-x w 2'
and 'C-x w 3', respectively.  A number of other useful window-related
commands are now available with key sequences that start with the
'C-x w' prefix.</code></pre><p>I am glad they added these. One of the things about Emacs’s window system is that you only ever operate within the part of the tree – Emacs’s window layout is stored in a simple tree structure – that your active window is in. So, splitting against the root window wasn’t possible without elisp.</p><pre><code>New display action 'display-buffer-full-frame'.
This action removes other windows from the frame when displaying a
buffer on that frame.</code></pre><p>This is a <code>display-buffer</code> action that ensures a buffer is displayed in a new frame.</p><pre><code>'display-buffer' now can set up the body size of the chosen window.
For example, a 'display-buffer-alist' entry of

    (window-width . (body-columns . 40))

will make the body of the chosen window 40 columns wide.  For the
height use 'window-height' and 'body-lines', respectively.</code></pre><p>The body is the size of the window without the margins and all the other bits. You can already set the height/width of a window, but now you can also do it with just the body. Should allow for more fine-grained control.</p><pre><code>'display-buffer' provides more options for using an existing window.
The display buffer action functions 'display-buffer-use-some-window' and
'display-buffer-use-least-recent-window' now honor the action alist
entry 'window-min-height' as well as the entries listed below to make
the display of several buffers in a row more amenable.</code></pre><p>Excellent news. Placing a window is difficult for Emacs as it has to respect a range of constraints and criteria. And when it fails to do it the way you want or expect it to, it can easily lead to user frustration.</p><pre><code>New buffer display action alist entry 'lru-frames'.
This allows specifying which frames 'display-buffer' should consider
when using a window that shows another buffer.  It is interpreted as
per the ALL-FRAMES argument of 'get-lru-window'.</code></pre><p>LRU meaning Least-Recently-Used.</p><pre><code>New buffer display action alist entry 'lru-time'.
'display-buffer' will ignore windows with a use time higher than this
when using a window that shows another buffer.</code></pre><pre><code>New buffer display action alist entry 'bump-use-time'.
This has 'display-buffer' bump the use time of any window it returns,
making it a less likely candidate for displaying another buffer.</code></pre><p>Taken together, you can use this to cycle buffers through windows using a combination of lru-time and bump-use-time. Now I’m curious to hear where this was first used.</p><pre><code>New buffer display action alist entry 'window-min-width'.
This allows specifying a preferred minimum width of the window used to
display a buffer.</code></pre><p>Useful to help constrain where Emacs can put a buffer (or a window, for that matter) and it should hopefully prevent things from popping up in tiny little windows that won’t fit the buffer’s content.</p><pre><code>You can specify on which window 'scroll-other-window' operates.
This is controlled by the new 'other-window-scroll-default' variable,
which should be set to a function that returns a window.  When this
variable is nil, 'next-window' is used.</code></pre><p>A hidden feature of Emacs is the ability to carry out a limited number of actions on other, nearby windows. <code>C-M-S-v</code> scrolls down the ‘other’ window (useful if you have two or more windows, one you’re editing and the other you’re reading along from.)</p><p>But now you can seemingly customize how this ‘other’ window is chosen.</p><h2 id="frames">Frames</h2><pre><code>Deleted frames can now be undeleted.
The 16 most recently deleted frames can be undeleted with 'C-x 5 u' when
'undelete-frame-mode' is enabled.  Without a prefix argument, undelete
the most recently deleted frame.  With a numerical prefix argument
between 1 and 16, where 1 is the most recently deleted frame, undelete
the corresponding deleted frame.</code></pre><p>Neat! I’m sure we’ve all closed a frame by accident.</p><pre><code>The variable 'icon-title-format' can now have the value t.
That value means to use 'frame-title-format' for iconified frames.
This is useful with some window managers and desktop environments
which treat changes in frame's title as requests to raise the frame
and/or give it input focus, or if you want the frame's title to be the
same no matter if the frame is iconified or not.</code></pre><h2 id="tab-bars-and-tab-lines">Tab Bars and Tab Lines</h2><p>Tab <em>bars</em> are window configurations; custom set pieces for how you want to arrange your windows. Tab <em>lines</em> are just a tabbed list of buffers.</p><pre><code>New user option 'tab-bar-auto-width' to automatically determine tab width.
This option is non-nil by default, which resizes tab-bar tabs so that
their width is evenly distributed across the tab bar.  A companion
option 'tab-bar-auto-width-max' controls the maximum width of a tab
before its name on display is truncated.</code></pre><p>If you want dynamic sizing and dislike truncated names, try it out.</p><pre><code>'C-x t RET' creates a new tab when the provided tab name doesn't exist.
It prompts for the name of a tab and switches to it, creating a new
tab if no tab exists by that name.</code></pre><p>Great if you want to navigate by tab name <em>or</em> maybe create a new one if that name does not exist.</p><pre><code>New keymap 'tab-bar-history-mode-map'.
By default, it contains 'C-c &lt;left&gt;' and 'C-c &lt;right&gt;' to browse
the history of tab window configurations back and forward.</code></pre><p>This feature is already in older Emacsen; what’s new is the mode map.</p><h2 id="bidi">BIDI</h2><pre><code>Better detection of text suspiciously reordered on display.
The function 'bidi-find-overridden-directionality' has been extended
to detect reordering effects produced by embeddings and isolates
(started by directional formatting control characters such as RLO and
LRI).  The new command 'highlight-confusing-reorderings' finds and
highlights segments of buffer text whose reordering for display is
suspicious and could be malicious.</code></pre><p><em>Confusables</em> are a group of unicode characters that appear to look like well-known (often Western) characters but are in actual fact from other scripts. This is what spammers and scammers tend to use to make it appear like a domain name or email is actually someone else.</p><h2 id="emacs-server-and-client">Emacs Server and Client</h2><p>Emacs has a client-server architecture, of course. It’s great! Set <code>EDITOR</code> to <code>emacsclient</code> and then <code>M-x server-start</code> (or any number of other ways of starting an Emacs server!) and now your Emacs will open files in a running instance.</p><pre><code>New command-line option '-r'/'--reuse-frame' for emacsclient.
With this command-line option, Emacs reuses an existing graphical client
frame if one exists; otherwise it creates a new frame.</code></pre><pre><code>New command-line option '-w N'/'--timeout=N' for emacsclient.
With this command-line option, emacsclient will exit if Emacs does not
respond within N seconds.  The default is to wait forever.</code></pre><pre><code>'server-stop-automatically' can be used to automatically stop the server.
The Emacs server will be automatically stopped when certain conditions
are met.  The conditions are determined by the argument to
'server-stop-automatically', which can be 'empty', 'delete-frame' or
'kill-terminal'.</code></pre><p>Worthwhile if you have a use case that requires shutting down the server when you are finished. I, however, tend to keep it running forever and ever.</p><h2 id="rcirc">Rcirc</h2><p>Rcirc is one of <em>two</em> IRC clients in Emacs. The other is ERC.</p><pre><code>New command 'rcirc-when'.
This shows the reception time of the message at point (if available).</code></pre><pre><code>New user option 'rcirc-cycle-completion-flag'.
Rcirc now uses the default 'completion-at-point' mechanism.  The
conventional IRC behavior of completing by cycling through the
available options can be restored by enabling this option.</code></pre><pre><code>New user option 'rcirc-bridge-bot-alist'.
If you are in a channel where a bot is responsible for bridging
between networks, you can use this variable to make these messages
appear more native.  For example, you might set the option to:

    (setopt rcirc-bridge-bot-alist '(("bridge" . "{\\(.+?\\)}[[:space:]]+")))

for messages like

    09:47 &lt;bridge&gt; {john} I am not on IRC

to be reformatted into

    09:47 &lt;john&gt; I am not on IRC</code></pre><pre><code>New formatting commands.
Most IRC clients (including rcirc) support basic formatting using
control codes.  Under the 'C-c C-f' prefix a few commands have been
added to insert these automatically.  For example, if a region is
active and 'C-c C-f C-b' is invoked, markup is inserted for the region
to be highlighted in bold.</code></pre><p>Remember when ornery graybeard <em>ircII</em> users would shout at mIRC users for using colors in channels? Now you can shout at mIRC users in boldface.</p><pre><code>'imenu' is now bound to 'M-g i' globally.</code></pre><p>I prefer <code>M-i</code>. It’s bound to <code>tab-to-tab-stop</code>, which is beyond useless. Nevertheless, it’s about time they bind one of the most useful navigational aids to a key.</p><pre><code>New function 'imenu-flush-cache'.
Use it if you want Imenu to forget the buffer's index alist and
recreate it anew next time 'imenu' is invoked.</code></pre><p>This is of interest to major mode programmers.</p><pre><code>Emacs is now capable of abandoning a window's redisplay that takes too long.
This is controlled by the new variable 'max-redisplay-ticks'.  If that
variable is set to a non-zero value, display of a window will be
aborted after that many low-level redisplay operations, thus
preventing Emacs from becoming wedged when visiting files with very
long lines.  The default is zero, which disables the feature: Emacs
will wait forever for redisplay to finish.  (We believe you won't need
this feature, given the ability to display buffers with very long
lines.)</code></pre><p>I hope so, too.</p><h2 id="editing-changes-in-emacs-29.1">Editing Changes in Emacs 29.1</h2><pre><code>'M-SPC' is now bound to 'cycle-spacing'.
Formerly it invoked 'just-one-space'.  The actions performed by
'cycle-spacing' and their order can now be customized via the user
option 'cycle-spacing-actions'.</code></pre><p>If you didn’t know, this used to set the amount of whitespace around point to just one space. Super-duper command in code and prose: combine with <code>M-^</code> to ‘lift’ the current line to the one above. That’d usually leave excess spacing, which you could then delete with <code>M-SPC</code>.</p><p>I recommend you review <code>cycle-spacing-actions</code> now that it’s changed.</p><pre><code>'zap-to-char' and 'zap-up-to-char' are case-sensitive for upper-case chars.
These commands now behave as case-sensitive for interactive calls when
they are invoked with an uppercase character, regardless of the value
of 'case-fold-search'.</code></pre><p>Case folding is mostly applied to the likes of isearch and replace-regexp. With it on (the default), Emacs will ignore casing <em>unless</em> you enter an uppercase letter. At that point Emacs becomes case-sensitive in search and replace. Great feature and really underrated.</p><pre><code>'scroll-other-window' and 'scroll-other-window-down' now respect remapping.
These commands (bound to 'C-M-v' and 'C-M-V') used to scroll the other
windows without looking at customizations in that other window.  These
functions now check whether they have been rebound in the buffer shown
in that other window, and then call the remapped function instead.  In
addition, these commands now also respect the
'scroll-error-top-bottom' user option.</code></pre><p>I’ve never remapped them, so I never knew there were problems when you did.</p><pre><code>Indentation of 'cl-flet' and 'cl-labels' has changed.
These forms now indent like this:

    (cl-flet ((bla (x)
                (* x x)))
      (bla 42))

This change also affects 'cl-macrolet', 'cl-flet*' and
'cl-symbol-macrolet'.</code></pre><p>I have no real opinion on this, but clearly someone did.</p><pre><code>New user option 'translate-upper-case-key-bindings'.
Set this option to nil to inhibit the default translation of upper
case keys to their lower case variants.</code></pre><p>If true (default), then Emacs will convert an upper case key binding to a lower case one provided there is no upper case binding. It is, in other words, there to catch mistyped commands. Just leave it as is. It’s a good default.</p><pre><code>New command 'ensure-empty-lines'.
This command increases (or decreases) the number of empty lines before
point.</code></pre><p>I can definitely find a user for this in <a href="https://www.masteringemacs.org/article/keyboard-macros-are-misunderstood">keyboard macros</a>, where it’s hard to assert the presence or absence of a certain number of things without a lot of diligence.</p><pre><code>Improved mouse behavior with auto-scrolling modes.
When clicking inside the 'scroll-margin' or 'hscroll-margin' region,
point is now moved only when releasing the mouse button.  This no
longer results in a bogus selection, unless the mouse has also been
dragged.</code></pre><pre><code>'kill-ring-max' now defaults to 120.</code></pre><p>I never noticed the old limit, to be honest. I couldn’t even tell you what it was.</p><pre><code>New user option 'yank-menu-max-items'.
Customize this option to limit the number of entries in the menu
"Edit → Paste from Kill Menu".  The default is 60.</code></pre><pre><code>New user option 'copy-region-blink-predicate'.
By default, when copying a region with 'kill-ring-save', Emacs only
blinks point and mark when the region is not denoted visually, that
is, when either the region is inactive, or the 'region' face is
indistinguishable from the 'default' face.

Users who would rather enable blinking unconditionally can now set
this user option to 'always'.  To disable blinking unconditionally,
either set this option to 'ignore', or set 'copy-region-blink-delay'
to 0.</code></pre><pre><code>Performing a pinch gesture on a touchpad now increases the text scale.</code></pre><p>Wait until you find out that Emacs has mouse gestures. <code>M-x strokes-help</code>.</p><h2 id="show-paren-mode">Show Paren Mode</h2><p>Show paren mode highlights the matching delimiters at point.</p><pre><code>New user option 'show-paren-context-when-offscreen'.
When non-nil, if the point is in a closing delimiter and the opening
delimiter is offscreen, shows some context around the opening
delimiter in the echo area.  The default is nil.

This option can also be set to the symbols 'overlay' or 'child-frame',
in which case the context is shown in an overlay or child-frame at the
top-left of the current window.  The latter option requires a
graphical frame.  On non-graphical frames, the context is shown in the
echo area.</code></pre><p>This is a <em>great</em> feature, as it does more than it implies here. I recommend you experiment with it on (or set to <code>overlay</code> or <code>child-frame</code>).</p><h2 id="comint">Comint</h2><p>Comint is the general term for Emacs’s interface that communicates with sub-processes, like bash or python.</p><pre><code>'comint-term-environment' is now aware of connection-local variables.
The user option 'comint-terminfo-terminal' and the variable
'system-uses-terminfo' can now be set as connection-local variables to
change the terminal used on a remote host.</code></pre><p>Connection-local variables are variables, much like buffer-local ones, that are specific to a particular network connection.</p><pre><code>New user option 'comint-delete-old-input'.
When nil, this prevents comint from deleting the current input when
inserting previous input using '&lt;mouse-2&gt;'.  The default is t, to
preserve previous behavior.</code></pre><pre><code>New minor mode 'comint-fontify-input-mode'.
This minor mode is enabled by default in "*shell*" and "*ielm*"
buffers.  It fontifies input text according to 'shell-mode' or
'emacs-lisp-mode' font-lock rules.  Customize the user options
'shell-fontify-input-enable' and 'ielm-fontify-input-enable' to nil if
you don't want to enable input fontification by default.</code></pre><p>Handy and a good default. You’ll get free syntax highlighting. It’s already there for the output, but until now, it never worked with the input.</p><h2 id="mwheel">Mwheel</h2><pre><code>New user options for alternate wheel events.
The user options 'mouse-wheel-down-alternate-event' and
'mouse-wheel-up-alternate-event' as well as the variables
'mouse-wheel-left-alternate-event' and
'mouse-wheel-right-alternate-event' have been added to better support
systems where two kinds of wheel events can be received.</code></pre><h2 id="internationalization">Internationalization</h2><pre><code>The '&lt;Delete&gt;' function key now allows deleting the entire composed sequence.
For the details, see the item about the 'delete-forward-char' command
above.</code></pre><p>This was covered earlier.</p><pre><code>New user option 'composition-break-at-point'.
Setting it to a non-nil value temporarily disables automatic
composition of character sequences at point, and thus makes it easier
to edit such sequences by allowing point to "enter" the composed
sequence.</code></pre><pre><code>Support for many old scripts and writing systems.
Emacs now supports, and has language-environments and input methods,
for several dozens of old scripts that were used in the past for

The default input method for the Tamil language environment is now
"tamil-phonetic" which is a customizable phonetic input method.  To
change the input method's translation rules, customize the user option
'tamil-translation-rules'.</code></pre><pre><code>New 'tamil99' input method for the Tamil language.
This supports the keyboard layout specifically designed for the Tamil

This is a variant of the 'slovak' input method, which corresponds to
the QWERTY Slovak keyboards.</code></pre><pre><code>New input method 'cyrillic-chuvash'.
This input method is based on the russian-computer input method, and
is intended for typing in the Chuvash language written in the Cyrillic

applicable keywords.  This disables most known behavioral quirks
unique to auth-source-pass, such as wildcard subdomain matching.</code></pre><h3 id="dired">Dired</h3><p>Dired is the Emacs Directory Editor, bound to <code>C-x d</code>.</p><pre><code>'dired-guess-shell-command' moved from dired-x to dired.
This means that 'dired-do-shell-command' will now provide smarter
defaults without first having to require 'dired-x'.  See the node
"(emacs) Shell Command Guessing" in the Emacs manual for more details.</code></pre><p><code>dired-x</code> was one of those red-headed step children of Dired. It’s always had a long list of really useful features that, somehow, never really made it into the main file, for unknown reasons. That wouldn’t matter if it was loaded by default, but it wasn’t. So you always had two types of Dired users: those who did, and those who did not, know about or use dired-x.</p><p>Anyway. This is a welcome change. It’ll offer better guesses for what to do with the file at point.</p><pre><code>'dired-clean-up-buffers-too' moved from dired-x to dired.
This means that Dired now offers to kill buffers visiting files and
dirs when they are deleted in Dired.  Before, you had to require
'dired-x' to enable this behavior.  To disable this behavior,
customize the user option 'dired-clean-up-buffers-too' to nil.  The
related user option 'dired-clean-confirm-killing-deleted-buffers'
(which see) has also been moved to 'dired'.</code></pre><p>Controversial default, but a lot of people use dired as the focal point of their work.</p><pre><code>'dired-do-relsymlink' moved from dired-x to dired.
The corresponding key 'Y' is now bound by default in Dired.</code></pre><pre><code>'dired-do-relsymlink-regexp' moved from dired-x to dired.
The corresponding key sequence '% Y' is now bound by default in Dired.</code></pre><p>Relative symlinks should’ve been part of dired from day one.</p><pre><code>'M-G' is now bound to 'dired-goto-subdir'.
Before, that binding was only available if the dired-x package was
loaded.</code></pre><p>Another useful command worth knowing about.</p><pre><code>'dired-info' and 'dired-man' moved from dired-x to dired.
The 'dired-info' and 'dired-man' commands have been moved from the
dired-x package to dired.  They have also been renamed to
'dired-do-info' and 'dired-do-man'; the old command names are obsolete
aliases.

The keys 'I' ('dired-do-info') and 'N' ('dired-do-man') are now bound
in Dired mode by default.  The user options 'dired-bind-man' and
'dired-bind-info' no longer have any effect and are obsolete.

To get the old behavior back and unbind these keys in Dired mode, add
the following to your Init file:

    (with-eval-after-load 'dired
      (keymap-set dired-mode-map "N" nil)
      (keymap-set dired-mode-map "I" nil))</code></pre><p>These commands will render a groff/troff/lroff ‘man’ file, or a TeXInfo info manual and open it.</p><pre><code>New command 'dired-do-eww'.
This command visits the file on the current line with EWW.</code></pre><p>EWW is Emacs’s Web Wowser.</p><pre><code>'browse-url-of-dired-file' can now call the secondary browser.
When invoked with a prefix arg, this will now call
'browse-url-secondary-browser-function' instead of the default
browser.  'browse-url-of-dired-file' is bound to 'W' by default in
dired mode.</code></pre><p>Interesting addition. Meanwhile <code>M-x browse-url</code> does not feature this.</p><pre><code>New user option 'dired-omit-lines'.
This is used by 'dired-omit-mode', and now allows you to hide based on
other things than just the file names.</code></pre><p>Omit mode hides things you do not wish to see in a dired buffer. Great way to filter out junk.</p><pre><code>New user option 'dired-mouse-drag-files'.
If non-nil, dragging file names with the mouse in a Dired buffer will
initiate a drag-and-drop session allowing them to be opened in other
programs.</code></pre><p>I use the mouse often in other programs, and drag and drop is in that weird sweet spot for me, speed-wise, where dragging in and out of Emacs is a desirable thing to be able to do.</p><pre><code>New user option 'dired-free-space'.
Dired will now, by default, include the free space in the first line
instead of having it on a separate line.  To get the previous behavior
back, say:

    (setopt dired-free-space 'separate)</code></pre><pre><code>New user option 'dired-make-directory-clickable'.
If non-nil (which is the default), hitting 'RET' or 'mouse-1' on
the directory components at the directory displayed at the start of
the buffer will take you to that directory.</code></pre><pre><code>Search and replace in Dired/Wdired supports more regexps.
For example, the regexp ".*" will match only characters that are part
of the file name.  Also "^.*$" can be used to match at the beginning
of the file name and at the end of the file name.  This is used only
when searching on file names.  In Wdired this can be used when the new
user option 'wdired-search-replace-filenames' is non-nil (which is the
default).</code></pre><p>Great change. The search scope for regexp in dired and <a href="https://www.masteringemacs.org/article/wdired-editable-dired-buffers">wdired</a> is now confined to the filename, which is infinitely more useful than the previous behavior.</p><h3 id="elisp">Elisp</h3><pre><code>New command 'elisp-eval-region-or-buffer' (bound to 'C-c C-e').
This command evals the forms in the active region or in the whole buffer.</code></pre><p>Great addition, as <code>M-x eval-buffer</code> was never bound to anything.</p><pre><code>New commands 'elisp-byte-compile-file' and 'elisp-byte-compile-buffer'.
These commands (bound to 'C-c C-f' and 'C-c C-b', respectively)
byte-compile the visited file and the current buffer, respectively.</code></pre><p>Also useful if you rely on the byte compiler to flag common mistakes.</p><h3 id="games">Games</h3><p>Emacs ships with a range of <a href="https://www.masteringemacs.org/article/fun-games-in-emacs">fun computer games</a>.</p><pre><code>New user option 'tetris-allow-repetitions'.
This controls how randomness is implemented (whether to use pure
randomness as before, or to use a bag).</code></pre><h3 id="battery">Battery</h3><p>The Battery library concerns tooling related to laptop batteries.</p><pre><code>New user option 'battery-update-functions'.

It converts all manner of documents to simple images so you can browse them in Emacs.</p><pre><code>doc-view can now generate SVG images when viewing PDF files.
If Emacs is built with SVG support, doc-view can generate SVG files
when using MuPDF as the converter for PDF files, which generally leads
to sharper images (especially when zooming), and allows customization
of background and foreground color of the page via the new user
options 'doc-view-svg-background' and 'doc-view-svg-foreground'.  To
activate this behavior, set 'doc-view-mupdf-use-svg' to non-nil if
your Emacs has SVG support.  Note that, with some versions of MuPDF,
SVG generation is known to sometimes produce SVG files that are buggy
or can take a long time to render.</code></pre><p>SVG support is a nice addition, thanks to Emacs’s support for libsvg.</p><h3 id="enriched-mode">Enriched Mode</h3><p>Enriched mode (“Rich-Text Format”, to others) is a useful little mode if you want basic WYSIWYG-style document editing.</p><pre><code>New command 'enriched-toggle-markup'.

As of Perl 5.10, 'perl -E 0' behaves like 'perl -e 0' but also activates
all optional features of the Perl version in use.  'perldb' now uses
this invocation as its default.</code></pre><h3 id="customize">Customize</h3><p><code>M-x customize</code> is Emacs’s configuration tool.</p><pre><code>New command 'custom-toggle-hide-all-widgets'.

(invalid byte code and macros).</code></pre><pre><code>New DWIM action on 'x' in "*Packages*" buffer.
If no packages are marked, 'x' will install the package under point if
it isn't already, and remove it if it is installed.  Customize the new
option 'package-menu-use-current-if-no-marks' to the nil value to get
back the old behavior of signaling an error in that case.</code></pre><p>I’d probably turn it off. Seems easy to fat finger and delete something.</p><pre><code>New command 'package-vc-install'.
Packages can now be installed directly from source by cloning from
their repository.</code></pre><p>Many of us have been waiting for this feature. It checks out – using VC, Emacs’s generic version control frontend – a repository and installs it as a package.</p><p>Unfortunately, it does not plug into <code>use-package</code>.</p><pre><code>New command 'package-vc-install-from-checkout'.
An existing checkout can now be loaded via package.el, by creating a
symbolic link from the usual package directory to the checkout.</code></pre><p>This is really handy for those of us who develop packages and want to test that it all works.</p><pre><code>New command 'package-vc-checkout'.
Used to fetch the source of a package by cloning a repository without
activating the package.</code></pre><pre><code>New command 'package-vc-prepare-patch'.
This command allows you to send patches to package maintainers, for
packages checked out using 'package-vc-install'.</code></pre><p>Handy – I look forward to seeing if this gets used.</p><pre><code>New command 'package-report-bug'.
This command helps you compose an email for sending bug reports to
package maintainers, and is bound to 'b' in the "*Packages*" buffer.</code></pre><p>Also very nice. And a good way of acknowledging the role that repositories play in the package ecosystem in Emacs today.</p><pre><code>New user option 'package-vc-selected-packages'.
By customizing this user option you can specify specific packages to
install.</code></pre><pre><code>New user option 'package-install-upgrade-built-in'.
When enabled, 'package-install' will include in the list of
upgradeable packages those built-in packages (like Eglot and
use-package, for example) for which a newer version is available in
package archives, and will allow installing those newer versions.  By
default, this is disabled; however, if 'package-install' is invoked
with a prefix argument, it will act as if this new option were
enabled.

In addition, when this option is non-nil, built-in packages for which
a new version is available in archives can be upgraded via the package
menu produced by 'list-packages'.  If you do set this option non-nil,
we recommend not to use the 'U' command, but instead to use '/ u' to
show the packages which can be upgraded, and then decide which ones of
them you actually want to update from the archives.

If you customize this option, we recommend you place its non-default
setting in your early-init file.</code></pre><p>The thing this solves is this: how should Emacs handle upgrades to packages it ships with? I recommend you cautiously decide whether to upgrade builtin packages or not.</p><h3 id="emacs-sessions-desktop">Emacs Sessions (Desktop)</h3><p>Desktop mode saves your Emacs session and restores it when you restart Emacs.</p><pre><code>New user option to load a locked desktop if locking Emacs is not running.
The option 'desktop-load-locked-desktop' can now be set to the value
'check-pid', which means to allow loading a locked ".emacs.desktop"
file if the Emacs process which locked it is no longer running on the
local machine.  This allows avoiding questions about locked desktop
files when the Emacs session which locked it crashes, or was otherwise
interrupted and didn't exit gracefully.  See the "(emacs) Saving
Emacs Sessions" node in the Emacs manual for more details.</code></pre><h3 id="miscellaneous">Miscellaneous</h3><pre><code>New command 'scratch-buffer'.
This command switches to the "*scratch*" buffer.  If "*scratch*" doesn't
exist, the command creates it first.  You can use this command if you
inadvertently delete the "*scratch*" buffer.</code></pre><p>Weirdly useful, this. I like the scratch buffer.</p><h3 id="debugging">Debugging</h3><pre><code>'q' in a "*Backtrace*" buffer no longer clears the buffer.
Instead it just buries the buffer and switches the mode from
'debugger-mode' to 'backtrace-mode', since commands like 'e' are no
longer available after exiting the recursive edit.</code></pre><p>A quality of life change more than anything.</p><pre><code>New user option 'debug-allow-recursive-debug'.
This user option controls whether the 'e' (in a "*Backtrace*"
buffer or while edebugging) and 'C-x C-e' (while edebugging) commands
lead to a (further) backtrace.  By default, this variable is nil,
which is a change in behavior from previous Emacs versions.</code></pre><pre><code>'e' in edebug can now take a prefix arg to pretty-print the results.
When invoked with a prefix argument, as in 'C-u e', this command will
pop up a new buffer and show the full pretty-printed value there.</code></pre><p>I like this a lot. Pretty printing output is still a bit poor in Emacs, in my opinion.</p><pre><code>'C-x C-e' now interprets a non-zero prefix arg to pretty-print the results.
When invoked with a non-zero prefix argument, as in 'C-u C-x C-e',
this command will pop up a new buffer and show the full pretty-printed
value there.</code></pre><pre><code>You can now generate a backtrace from Lisp errors in redisplay.
To do this, set the new variable 'backtrace-on-redisplay-error' to a

named "*Redisplay-trace*".  This buffer will not be automatically
displayed in a window.</code></pre><h3 id="compile">Compile</h3><p><code>M-x compile</code> is a generic compilation system with error highlighting, and more. See <a href="https://www.masteringemacs.org/article/compiling-running-scripts-emacs">Compiling and running scripts in Emacs</a>.</p><pre><code>New user option 'compilation-hidden-output'.
This regular expression can be used to make specific parts of
compilation output invisible.</code></pre><p>Can come in handy if you deal with noisy build output</p><pre><code>The 'compilation-auto-jump-to-first-error' user option has been extended.
It can now have the additional values 'if-location-known' (which will
only jump if the location of the first error is known), and
'first-known' (which will jump to the first known error location).</code></pre><p>Now <em>that</em> is helpful. It’s worth your time trying that out if you are a regular user of compile, as I am.</p><pre><code>New user option 'compilation-max-output-line-length'.
Lines longer than the value of this option will have their ends
hidden, with a button to reveal the hidden text.  This speeds up
operations like grepping on files that have few newlines.  The default
value is 400; set to nil to disable hiding.</code></pre><p>This should help stop things like minified files from gumming up everything.</p><h3 id="flymake">Flymake</h3><p>Flymake is the on-the-fly syntax and linter frontend.

This mode adds some highlighting, makes the 'M-q' command aware of the
format of NEWS entries, and has special commands for doing maintenance
of the Emacs NEWS files.  In addition, this mode turns on
'outline-minor-mode', and thus displays customizable icons (see

before saving the value.</code></pre><h3 id="minibuffer-and-completions">Minibuffer and Completions</h3><p>Minibuffer completion’s a dizzying array of options now. I’ve written a guide on <a href="https://www.masteringemacs.org/article/understanding-minibuffer-completion">understanding minibuffer completion</a> if you want to know more.</p><pre><code>New commands for navigating completions from the minibuffer.
When the minibuffer is the current buffer, typing 'M-&lt;up&gt;' or
'M-&lt;down&gt;' selects a previous/next completion candidate from the
"*Completions*" buffer and inserts it to the minibuffer.
When the user option 'minibuffer-completion-auto-choose' is nil,
'M-&lt;up&gt;' and 'M-&lt;down&gt;' do the same, but without inserting
a completion candidate to the minibuffer, then 'M-RET' can be used
to choose the currently active candidate from the "*Completions*"
buffer and exit the minibuffer.  With a prefix argument, 'C-u M-RET'
inserts the currently active candidate to the minibuffer, but doesn't
exit the minibuffer.  These keys are also available for in-buffer
completion, but they don't insert candidates automatically, you need
to type 'M-RET' to insert the selected candidate to the buffer.</code></pre><p>If you use the <em>Completions</em> buffer to help select matches – one of many possible workflows – then you’re likely to find this selection mechanism a useful alternative to the cumbersome methods of picking and choosing from that buffer before.</p><p>If you use a fancy type-as-you-complete completion framework, then you’re not likely to benefit from this change at all.</p><pre><code>Choosing a completion with a prefix argument doesn't exit the minibuffer.
This means that typing 'C-u RET' on a completion candidate in the
"*Completions*" buffer inserts the completion into the minibuffer,
but doesn't exit the minibuffer.</code></pre><p>Niche use, but the completion system’s flexible and omnipresent, as you can ‘enter’ the completion mechanism using any number of features in Emacs, such as <code>M-x shell</code>, where the ability to repeatedly insert matches is useful.</p><pre><code>The "*Completions*" buffer can now be automatically selected.
To enable this behavior, customize the user option
'completion-auto-select' to t, then pressing 'TAB' will switch to the
"*Completions*" buffer when it pops up that buffer.  If the value is
'second-tab', then the first 'TAB' will display "*Completions*", and
the second one will switch to the "*Completions*" buffer.</code></pre><p>This feature also plays into the <em>Completions</em> buffer workflow. I’ve never been a huge fan of mucking around with manually selecting stuff, preferring instead to type my way to an answer and then only use the buffer as a popup of remaining choices.</p><pre><code>New user option 'completion-auto-wrap'.
When non-nil, the commands 'next-completion' and 'previous-completion'
automatically wrap around on reaching the beginning or the end of
the "*Completions*" buffer.</code></pre><pre><code>New values for the 'completion-auto-help' user option.
There are two new values to control the way the "*Completions*" buffer
behaves after pressing a 'TAB' if completion is not unique.  The value
'always' updates or shows the "*Completions*" buffer after any attempt
to complete.  The value 'visual' is like 'always', but only updates
the completions if they are already visible.  The default value t
always hides the completion buffer after some completion is made.</code></pre><p>All this controls is how or when the buffer is shown, which is again down to the specifics of your completion setup. If you want the buffer to only appear when you tab twice, now you can.</p><pre><code>New commands to complete the minibuffer history.
'minibuffer-complete-history' ('C-x &lt;up&gt;') is like 'minibuffer-complete'
but completes on the history items instead of the default completion
table.  'minibuffer-complete-defaults' ('C-x &lt;down&gt;') completes
on the list of default items.</code></pre><pre><code>User option 'minibuffer-eldef-shorten-default' is now obsolete.
Customize the user option 'minibuffer-default-prompt-format' instead.</code></pre><pre><code>New user option 'completions-sort'.
This option controls the sorting of the completion candidates in
the "*Completions*" buffer.  Available styles are no sorting,
alphabetical (the default), or a custom sort function.</code></pre><p>Sort order is weirdly important, as you can sort by frequency, context, etc. I expect this feature will prove enduring and popular going forward.</p><pre><code>New user option 'completions-max-height'.
This option limits the height of the "*Completions*" buffer.</code></pre><p>Instead of toying with <code>display-buffer-alist</code>, you can now set this height directly.</p><pre><code>New user option 'completions-header-format'.
This is a string to control the header line to show in the
"*Completions*" buffer before the list of completions.
If it contains "%s", that is replaced with the number of completions.
If nil, the header line is not shown.</code></pre><pre><code>New user option 'completions-highlight-face'.
When this user option names a face, the current
candidate in the "*Completions*" buffer is highlighted with that face.
The nil value disables this highlighting.  The default is to highlight
using the 'completions-highlight' face.</code></pre><pre><code>You can now define abbrevs for the minibuffer modes.
'minibuffer-mode-abbrev-table' and
'minibuffer-inactive-mode-abbrev-table' are now defined.</code></pre><p>That’s actually quite helpful. <a href="https://www.masteringemacs.org/article/correcting-typos-misspellings-abbrev">Abbrev</a> is meant for simple typos and word replacements, and indeed they can happen anywhere, even in the minibuffer.</p><h3 id="isearch-and-replace">Isearch and Replace</h3><pre><code>Changes in how Isearch responds to 'mouse-yank-at-point'.
If a user does 'C-s' and then uses '&lt;mouse-2&gt;' ('mouse-yank-primary')
outside the echo area, Emacs will, by default, end the Isearch and
yank the text at mouse cursor.  But if 'mouse-yank-at-point' is
non-nil, the text will now be added to the Isearch instead.</code></pre><pre><code>Changes for values 'no' and 'no-ding' of 'isearch-wrap-pause'.
Now with these values the search will wrap around not only on repeating
with 'C-s C-s', but also after typing a character.</code></pre><p>Isearch will by default wrap around and start anew if you double-tap <code>C-s</code> at the end of the search.</p><pre><code>New user option 'char-fold-override'.
Non-nil means that the default definitions of equivalent characters
are overridden.</code></pre><p>The character folding feature (turning one character into another, for the purposes of ease of searching) is governed by this, new, variable, and <code>char-fold-[include/exclude]</code>.</p><pre><code>New command 'describe-char-fold-equivalences'.
It displays character equivalences used by 'char-fold-to-regexp'.</code></pre><p>This command is an intuitive display of what a character is folded to, if anything.</p><pre><code>New command 'isearch-emoji-by-name'.
It is bound to 'C-x 8 e RET' during an incremental search.  The
command accepts the Unicode name of an Emoji (for example, "smiling
face" or "heart with arrow"), like 'C-x 8 e e', with minibuffer
completion, and adds the Emoji into the search string.</code></pre><p>Oddly specific, but… OK.</p><h3 id="gdbmi">GDB/MI</h3><pre><code>New user option 'gdb-debuginfod-enable-setting'.
On capable platforms, GDB 10.1 and later can download missing source
and debug info files from special-purpose servers, called "debuginfod
servers".  Use this new option to control whether 'M-x gdb' instructs
GDB to download missing files from debuginfod servers when you debug
the corresponding programs.  The default is to ask you at the
beginning of each debugging session whether to download the files for
that session.</code></pre><h3 id="glyphless-characters">Glyphless Characters</h3><pre><code>New minor mode 'glyphless-display-mode'.
This allows an easy way to toggle seeing all glyphless characters in
the current buffer.</code></pre><pre><code>The extra slot of 'glyphless-char-display' can now have cons values.
The extra slot of the 'glyphless-char-display' char-table can now have
values that are cons cells, specifying separate values for text-mode

The 'acronym' method of displaying glyphless characters on text-mode
frames treats single-character acronyms specially: they are displayed
without the surrounding '[..]' "box", thus in effect treating such
"acronyms" as replacement characters.</code></pre><h3 id="registers">Registers</h3><p>Registers are single-character short-hands that can store a wide range of things, including strings, numbers, points, window configurations, and much more.</p><pre><code>Buffer names can now be stored in registers.

It copies the name of the function near point into the kill ring.</code></pre><pre><code>'N' and 'P' are now bound to 'shortdoc-{next,previous}-section'.
This is in addition to the old keybindings 'C-c C-n' and 'C-c C-p'.</code></pre><h3 id="vc">VC</h3><p>VC is Emacs’s generic Version Control system that works with all major and minor version control systems. They’re bound to <code>C-x v</code>. I love VC, even though I use Magit with Git for 95% of what I do.</p><p>It works really well and offers a unified view of all version control systems it supports.</p><pre><code>New command 'vc-pull-and-push'.
This commands first does a "pull" command, and if that is successful,
does a "push" command afterwards.  Currently supported in Git and Bzr.</code></pre><p>Handy time saver.</p><pre><code>'C-x v b' prefix key is used now for branch commands.
'vc-print-branch-log' is bound to 'C-x v b l', and new commands are
'vc-create-branch' ('C-x v b c') and 'vc-switch-branch' ('C-x v b s').
The VC Directory buffer now uses the prefix 'b' for these branch-related
commands.</code></pre><p>This is a great set of features, and if you use VC, you should definitely learn them.</p><pre><code>New command 'vc-dir-mark-by-regexp' bound to '% m' and '* %'.
This command marks files based on a regexp.  If given a prefix
argument, unmark instead.</code></pre><p>Much like dired. Note that this is meant to be run in <code>C-x v d</code>, the dired-style VC buffer.</p><pre><code>New command 'C-x v !' ('vc-edit-next-command').
This prefix command requests editing of the next VC shell command
before execution.  For example, in a Git repository, you can produce a
log of more than one branch by typing 'C-x v ! C-x v b l' and then
appending additional branch names to the 'git log' command.

The intention is that this command can be used to access a wide
variety of version control system-specific functionality from VC
without complexifying either the VC command set or the backend API.</code></pre><pre><code>'C-x v v' in a diffs buffer allows to commit only some of the changes.
This command is intended to allow you to commit only some of the
changes you have in your working tree.  Begin by creating a buffer
with the changes against the last commit, e.g. with 'C-x v D'
('vc-root-diff').  Then edit the diffs to remove the hunks you don't
want to commit.  Finally, type 'C-x v v' in that diff buffer to commit
only part of your changes, those whose hunks were left in the buffer.</code></pre><p>Partial commits of hunks is a great feature of Magit, and I am happy to see it in VC also.</p><pre><code>'C-x v v' on an unregistered file will now use the most specific backend.
Previously, if you had an SVN-covered "~/" directory, and a Git-covered
directory in "~/foo/bar", using 'C-x v v' on a new, unregistered file
"~/foo/bar/zot" would register it in the SVN repository in "~/" instead of
in the Git repository in "~/foo/bar".  This makes this command
consistent with 'vc-responsible-backend'.</code></pre><pre><code>Log Edit now fontifies long Git commit summary lines.
Writing shorter summary lines avoids truncation in contexts in which
Git commands display summary lines.  See the two new user options
'vc-git-log-edit-summary-target-len' and 'vc-git-log-edit-summary-max-len'.</code></pre><pre><code>New 'log-edit-headers-separator' face.
It is used to style the line that separates the 'log-edit' headers
from the 'log-edit' summary.</code></pre><pre><code>The function 'vc-read-revision' accepts a new MULTIPLE argument.
If non-nil, multiple revisions can be queried.  This is done using
'completing-read-multiple'.</code></pre><pre><code>New function 'vc-read-multiple-revisions'.
This function invokes 'vc-read-revision' with a non-nil value for
MULTIPLE.</code></pre><pre><code>New command 'vc-prepare-patch'.
Patches for any version control system can be prepared using VC.  The
command will query what commits to send and will compose messages for
your mail user agent.  The behavior of 'vc-prepare-patch' can be
modified by the user options 'vc-prepare-patches-separately' and
'vc-default-patch-addressee'.</code></pre><h3 id="message">Message</h3><p>Message is Emacs’s Message mode intended for e-mails and suchlike.</p><pre><code>New user option 'mml-attach-file-at-the-end'.

If you work in a corporate environment, you’re probably using LDAP. You can use EUDC to talk to Microsoft Exchange (or FreeIPA, or …) and pull out contracts and whatnot from it. Powerful stuff.</p><pre><code>Deprecations planned for next release.
After Emacs 29.1, some aspects of EUDC will be deprecated.  The goal
of these deprecations is to simplify EUDC server configuration by
making 'eudc-server-hotlist' the only place to add servers.  There
will not be a need to set the server using the 'eudc-set-server'
command.  Instead, the 'eudc-server-hotlist' user option should be
customized to have an entry for the server.  The plan is to obsolete
the 'eudc-hotlist' package since Customize is sufficient for changing
'eudc-server-hotlist'.  How the 'eudc-server' user option works in this
context is to-be-determined; it can't be removed, because that would
break compatibility, but it may become synchronized with
'eudc-server-hotlist' so that 'eudc-server' is always equal to '(car
eudc-server-hotlist)'.  The first entry in 'eudc-server-hotlist' is the
first server tried by 'eudc-expand-try-all'.  The hotlist
simplification will allow 'eudc-query-form' to show a drop down of
possible servers, instead of requiring a call to 'eudc-set-server'
like it does in this release.  The default value of
'eudc-ignore-options-file' will be changed from nil to t.</code></pre><pre><code>New user option 'eudc-ignore-options-file' that defaults to nil.
The 'eudc-ignore-options-file' user option can be configured to ignore
the 'eudc-options-file' (typically "~/.emacs.d/eudc-options").  Most
users should configure this to t and put EUDC configuration in the
main Emacs initialization file ("~/.emacs" or "~/.emacs.d/init.el").</code></pre><pre><code>'eudc-expansion-overwrites-query' to 'eudc-expansion-save-query-as-kill'.
The user option 'eudc-expansion-overwrites-query' is renamed to
'eudc-expansion-save-query-as-kill' to reflect the actual behavior of
the user option.  The former is kept as alias.</code></pre><pre><code>New command 'eudc-expand-try-all'.
This command can be used in place of 'eudc-expand-inline'.  It takes a
prefix argument that causes 'eudc-expand-try-all' to return matches
from all servers instead of just the matches from the first server to
return any.  This is useful for example, if one wants to search LDAP
for a name that happens to match a contact in one's BBDB.</code></pre><pre><code>New behavior and default for user option 'eudc-inline-expansion-format'.
EUDC inline expansion result formatting defaulted to

    ("%s %s &lt;%s&gt;" firstname name email)

Since email address specifications need to comply with RFC 5322 in
order to be useful in messages, there was a risk of producing syntax
which was standard with RFC 822, but is marked as obsolete syntax by
its successor RFC 5322.  Also, the first and last name part was never
enclosed in double quotes, potentially producing invalid address
specifications, which may be rejected by a receiving MTA.  Thus, this
variable can now additionally be set to nil (the new default), or a
function.  In both cases, the formatted result will be in compliance
with RFC 5322.  When set to nil, a default format very similar to the
old default will be produced.  When set to a function, that function
is called, and the returned values are used to populate the phrase and
comment parts (see RFC 5322 for definitions).  In both cases, the
phrase part will be automatically quoted if necessary.</code></pre><pre><code>New function 'eudc-capf-complete' with 'message-mode' integration.
EUDC can now contribute email addresses to 'completion-at-point' by
adding the new function 'eudc-capf-complete' to
'completion-at-point-functions' in 'message-mode'.</code></pre><p>The missing link that ties EUDC into Emacs’s general-purpose completion framework called “capf” (short for <code>completion-at-point-functions</code>)</p><pre><code>Additional attributes of query and results in eudcb-macos-contacts.el.

A new back-end for ecomplete allows information from that database to
be queried by EUDC, too.  The attributes present in the EUDC query are
used to select the entry type in the ecomplete database.</code></pre><pre><code>New back-end for mailabbrev.
A new back-end for mailabbrev allows information from that database to

rendered web pages by using their title, URL, or a user-defined
function which returns a string.  For the first two cases, the length
of the resulting name is controlled by the user option
'eww-buffer-name-length'.  By default, no automatic renaming is
performed.</code></pre><pre><code>New user option 'shr-allowed-images'.
This complements 'shr-blocked-images', but allows specifying just the
allowed images.</code></pre><pre><code>New user option 'shr-use-xwidgets-for-media'.
If non-nil (and Emacs has been built with support for xwidgets),
display &lt;video&gt; elements with an xwidget.  Note that this is
experimental; it is known to crash Emacs on some systems, and just
doesn't work on other systems.  Also see etc/PROBLEMS.</code></pre><p>If you compile Emacs with xwidget support, then maybe — just maybe – you might be able to watch a video link in your EWW buffer.</p><pre><code>New user option 'eww-url-transformers'.
These are used to alter an URL before using it.  By default it removes
the common "utm_" trackers from URLs.</code></pre><h3 id="find-dired">Find Dired</h3><p>Who needs <code>find</code> and <code>xargs</code> when you have <a href="https://www.masteringemacs.org/article/dired-shell-commands-find-xargs-replacement">Dired, the find &amp; xargs replacement</a>?</p><pre><code>New command 'find-dired-with-command'.
This enables users to run 'find-dired' with an arbitrary command,
enabling running commands previously unsupported and also enabling new
commands to be built on top.</code></pre><h3 id="gnus">Gnus</h3><p>For some, GNUS is a news, mail, and rss reader; for others, it’s a lifestyle.</p><pre><code>Tool bar changes in Gnus/Message.
There were previously two styles of tool bars available in Gnus and
Message, referred to as 'gnus-summary-tool-bar-retro',
'gnus-group-tool-bar-retro' and 'message-tool-bar-retro', and
'gnus-summary-tool-bar-gnome', 'gnus-group-tool-bar-gnome' and
'message-tool-bar-gnome'.  The "retro" tool bars have been removed (as
well as the icons used), and the "gnome" tool bars are now the only
pre-defined toolbars.</code></pre><pre><code>'gnus-summary-up-thread' and 'gnus-summary-down-thread' bindings removed.
The 'gnus-summary-down-thread' binding to 'M-C-d' was shadowed by
'gnus-summary-read-document', and these commands are also available on
'T u' and 'T d' respectively.</code></pre><pre><code>Gnus now uses a variable-pitch font in the headers by default.
To get the monospace font back, you can put something like the
following in your ".gnus" file:

    (set-face-attribute 'gnus-header nil :inherit 'unspecified)</code></pre><pre><code>The default value of 'gnus-treat-fold-headers' is now 'head'.</code></pre><pre><code>New face 'gnus-header'.
All other 'gnus-header-*' faces inherit from this face now.</code></pre><pre><code>New user option 'gnus-treat-emojize-symbols'.
If non-nil, symbols that have an Emoji representation will be
displayed as emojis.  The default is nil.</code></pre><pre><code>New command 'gnus-article-emojize-symbols'.
This is bound to 'W D e' and will display symbols that have Emoji
representation as Emoji.</code></pre><pre><code>New mu backend for gnus-search.
Configuration is very similar to the notmuch and namazu backends.  It
supports the unified search syntax.</code></pre><p>Interesting. <code>mu</code> is a standalone mail indexer, and <code>mu4e</code> a mail reader on top of it. So it’s perhaps possible, then, to use GNUS for mail reading, and outsource storing and indexing?</p><pre><code>'gnus-html-image-cache-ttl' is now a seconds count.
Formerly it was a pair of numbers '(A B)' that represented 65536*A + B,
to cater to older Emacs implementations that lacked bignums.
The older form still works but is undocumented.</code></pre><h3 id="rmail">Rmail</h3><p>Rmail is yet another way of interacting with email in Emacs.</p><pre><code>Rmail partial summaries can now be applied one on top of the other.
You can now narrow the set of messages selected by Rmail summary's
criteria (recipients, topic, senders, etc.) by making a summary of the
already summarized messages.  For example, invoking
'rmail-summary-by-senders', followed by 'rmail-summary-by-topic' will
produce a summary where both the senders and the topic are according
to your selection.  The new user option
'rmail-summary-progressively-narrow' controls whether the stacking of
the filters is in effect; customize it to a non-nil value to enable
this feature.</code></pre><pre><code>New Rmail summary: by thread.
The new command 'rmail-summary-by-thread' produces a summary of
messages that belong to a single thread of discussion.</code></pre><h3 id="eieio">EIEIO</h3><p>EIEIO is Elisp’s CLOS-style object oriented system. It’s also a nursery rhyme.</p><blockquote><p>Old MacDonald had a farm…</p></blockquote><pre><code>'slot-value' can now be used to access slots of 'cl-defstruct' objects.</code></pre><h3 id="align">Align</h3><p>Align is Emacs’s text alignment facility.</p><pre><code>Alignment in 'text-mode' has changed.
Previously, 'M-x align' didn't do anything, and you had to say 'C-u
M-x align' for it to work.  This has now been changed.  The default
regexp for 'C-u M-x align-regexp' has also been changed to be easier
for inexperienced users to use.</code></pre><h3 id="help-1">Help</h3><p>Help is, well, help. It’s the mode you interact with when you ask Emacs for help.</p><pre><code>New mode, 'emacs-news-view-mode', for viewing the NEWS file.
This mode is used by the 'C-h N' command, and adds buttons to manual
entries and symbol references.</code></pre><pre><code>New user option 'help-link-key-to-documentation'.
When this option is non-nil (which is the default), key bindings
displayed in the "*Help*" buffer will be linked to the documentation
for the command they are bound to.  This does not affect listings of
key bindings and functions (such as 'C-h b').</code></pre><p>More interlinking is always a good thing. I’m glad they’re spending more time improving this in recent Emacsen.</p><h3 id="info-look">Info Look</h3><pre><code>info-look specs can now be expanded at run time instead of a load time.
The new ':doc-spec-function' element can be used to compute the
':doc-spec' element when the user asks for info on that particular
mode (instead of at load time).</code></pre><h3 id="ansi-color">Ansi Color</h3><p>Ansi color is Emacs’s rather tired and limited ANSI color feature.</p><pre><code>Support for ANSI 256-color and 24-bit colors.
256-color and 24-bit color codes are now handled by ANSI color
filters and displayed with the specified color.</code></pre><h3 id="term-mode">Term Mode</h3><p>Term is Emacs’s terminal emulator. Not to be confused with shells!</p><p>See <a href="https://www.masteringemacs.org/article/running-shells-in-emacs-overview">Running Shells and Terminal Emulators in Emacs</a></p><pre><code>New user option 'term-bind-function-keys'.
If non-nil, 'term-mode' will pass the function keys on to the
underlying shell instead of using the normal Emacs bindings.</code></pre><pre><code>Support for ANSI 256-color and 24-bit colors, italic and other fonts.
'term-mode' can now display 256-color and 24-bit color codes.  It can
also handle ANSI codes for faint, italic and blinking text, displaying
it with new 'term-{faint,italic,slow-blink,fast-blink}' faces.</code></pre><h3 id="project">Project</h3><p>Project is the latest in a long, <em>long</em> list of project management solutions built into Emacs. This one seems to have a bit more staying power than the others before it (filesets, CEDET’s project management suite EDE, filecache, …) and that is a good thing.</p><p>Emacs has sorely lacked a proper project manager that people can rally behind.</p><pre><code>'project-find-file' and 'project-or-external-find-file' can include all.
The commands 'project-find-file' and 'project-or-external-find-file'
now accept a prefix argument, which is interpreted to mean "include
all files".</code></pre><pre><code>New command 'project-list-buffers' bound to 'C-x p C-b'.
This command displays a list of buffers from the current project.</code></pre><p>Scoping buffers to the project is good. Shame it’s not using <code>M-x ibuffer</code>.</p><pre><code>'project-kill-buffers' can display the list of buffers to kill.
Customize the user option 'project-kill-buffers-display-buffer-list'
to enable the display of the buffer list.</code></pre><pre><code>New user option 'project-vc-extra-root-markers'.
Use it to add detection of nested projects (inside a VCS repository),
or projects outside of VCS repositories.

As a consequence, the 'VC project backend' is formally renamed to
'VC-aware project backend'.</code></pre><pre><code>New user option 'project-vc-include-untracked'.
If non-nil, files untracked by a VCS are considered to be part of
the project by a VC project based on that VCS.</code></pre><h3 id="xref">Xref</h3><p>Xref is the cross-referencing tool that replaced the rather poor and cumbersome “TAGS” search machinery.</p><pre><code>New command 'xref-go-forward'.
It is bound to 'C-M-,' and jumps to the location where you previously
invoked 'xref-go-back' ('M-,', also known as 'xref-pop-marker-stack').</code></pre><pre><code>The depth of the Xref marker stack is now infinite.
The implementation of the Xref marker stack was changed in a way that
allows as many places to be saved on the stack as needed, limited only
by the available memory.  Therefore, the variables
'find-tag-marker-ring-length' and 'xref-marker-ring-length' are now
obsolete and unused; setting them has no effect.</code></pre><p>Not sure I ever knew, much less reached, the old limit.</p><pre><code>'xref-query-replace-in-results' prompting change.
This command no longer prompts for FROM when called without prefix
argument.  This makes the most common case faster: replacing entire
matches.</code></pre><pre><code>New command 'xref-find-references-and-replace' to rename one identifier.</code></pre><p>Handy, as it saves on typing.</p><pre><code>New variable 'xref-current-item' (renamed from a private version).</code></pre><pre><code>New function 'xref-show-xrefs'.</code></pre><pre><code>'outline-minor-mode' is supported in Xref buffers.
You can enable outlining by adding 'outline-minor-mode' to
'xref-after-update-hook'.</code></pre><p>I didn’t know I wanted this in my life, but… I do! that’s a neat feature. And, just sayin’, if it weren’t for this NEWS entry, nobody – ever – would figure this out.</p><h3 id="file-notifications">File Notifications</h3><p>Emacs can stay updated on file system changes thanks to a range of OS-specific mechanisms.</p><pre><code>The new command 'file-notify-rm-all-watches' removes all file notifications.</code></pre><h3 id="sql">Sql</h3><pre><code>Sql now supports sending of passwords in-process.
To improve security, if an sql product has ':password-in-comint' set
to t, a password supplied via the minibuffer will be sent in-process,
as opposed to via the command-line.</code></pre><h3 id="image-mode">Image Mode</h3><pre><code>New command 'image-transform-fit-to-window'.
This command fits the image to the current window by scaling down or
up as necessary.  Unlike 'image-transform-fit-both', this can scale
the image up as well as down.  It is bound to 's w' in Image Mode by
default.</code></pre><p>I do use the Image mode feature in Emacs, but I’ve never had to scale an image up; but it’s good to know it’s there.</p><pre><code>New command 'image-mode-wallpaper-set'.
This command sets the desktop background to the current image.  It is
bound to 'W' in Image Mode by default.</code></pre><p>I live in Emacs; it may as well be my wallpaper.</p><pre><code>'image-transform-fit-to-{height,width}' are now obsolete.
Use the new command 'image-transform-fit-to-window' instead.
The keybinding for 'image-transform-fit-to-width' is now 's i'.</code></pre><pre><code>User option 'image-auto-resize' can now be set to 'fit-window'.
This works like 'image-transform-fit-to-window'.</code></pre><pre><code>New user option 'image-auto-resize-max-scale-percent'.
The new 'fit-window' option will never scale an image more than this
much (in percent).  It is nil by default, which means no limit.</code></pre><pre><code>New user option 'image-text-based-formats'.
This controls whether or not to show a message, when opening certain
image formats, explaining how to edit it as text.  The default is to
show this message for SVG and XPM.</code></pre><pre><code>New command 'image-transform-set-percent'.
It allows resizing the image to a percentage of its original size, and
is bound to 's p' in Image mode.</code></pre><pre><code>'image-transform-original' renamed to 'image-transform-reset-to-original'.
The old name was confusing, and is now an obsolete function alias.</code></pre><pre><code>'image-transform-reset' renamed to 'image-transform-reset-to-initial'.
The old name was confusing, and is now an obsolete function alias.</code></pre><h3 id="images">Images</h3><pre><code>New commands 'image-crop' and 'image-cut'.
These commands allow interactively cropping/cutting the image at
point.  The commands are bound to keys 'i c' and 'i x' (respectively)
in the local keymap over images.  They rely on external programs, by
default "convert" from ImageMagick, to do the actual cropping/eliding
of the image file.</code></pre><pre><code>New commands 'image-flip-horizontally' and 'image-flip-vertically'.
These commands horizontally and vertically flip the image under point,
and are bound to 'i h' and 'i v', respectively.</code></pre><pre><code>Users can now add special image conversion functions.
This is done via 'image-converter-add-handler'.</code></pre><h3 id="image-dired">Image Dired</h3><p>Yep, image dired is a thing. It’ll generate thumbnails of images and display them alongside the file.</p><pre><code>'image-dired-image-mode' is now based on 'image-mode'.
This avoids converting images in the background, and makes Image-Dired
noticeably faster.  New keybindings from 'image-mode' are now
available in the "*image-dired-display-image*" buffer; press '?' or
'h' in that buffer to see the full list.</code></pre><p>This is just a consolidation of code.</p><pre><code>Navigation and marking commands now work in image display buffer.
The following new bindings have been added:
- 'n', 'SPC' =&gt; 'image-dired-display-next'
- 'p', 'DEL' =&gt; 'image-dired-display-previous'
- 'm'        =&gt; 'image-dired-mark-thumb-original-file'
- 'd'        =&gt; 'image-dired-flag-thumb-original-file'
- 'u'        =&gt; 'image-dired-unmark-thumb-original-file'</code></pre><p>They have been sorely missed. I never quite understood why they couldn’t do this before. I ended up writing my own glue code to do this.</p><pre><code>New command 'image-dired-unmark-all-marks'.
It removes all marks from all files in the thumbnail and the
associated Dired buffer, and is bound to 'U' in the thumbnail and
display buffer.</code></pre><pre><code>New command 'image-dired-do-flagged-delete'.
It deletes all flagged files, and is bound to 'x' in the thumbnail
buffer.  It replaces the command 'image-dired-delete-marked', which is
now an obsolete alias.</code></pre><pre><code>New command 'image-dired-copy-filename-as-kill'.
It copies the name of the marked or current image to the kill ring,
and is bound to 'w' in the thumbnail buffer.</code></pre><pre><code>New command 'image-dired-wallpaper-set'.
This command sets the desktop background to the image at point in the
thumbnail buffer.  It is bound to 'W' by default.</code></pre><pre><code>'image-dired-slideshow-start' is now bound to 'S'.
It is bound in both the thumbnail and display buffer, and no longer
prompts for a timeout; use a numerical prefix (e.g. 'C-u 8 S') to set
the timeout.</code></pre><pre><code>New user option 'image-dired-marking-shows-next'.
If this option is non-nil (the default), marking, unmarking or
flagging an image in either the thumbnail or display buffer shows the
next image.</code></pre><pre><code>New face 'image-dired-thumb-flagged'.
If 'image-dired-thumb-mark' is non-nil (the default), this face is
used for images that are flagged for deletion in the Dired buffer
associated with Image-Dired.</code></pre><pre><code>Image information is now shown in the header line of the thumbnail buffer.
This replaces the message that most navigation commands in the
thumbnail buffer used to show at the bottom of the screen.</code></pre><pre><code>New specifiers for 'image-dired-display-properties-format'.
This is used to format the new header line.  The new specifiers are:
"%d" for the name of the directory that the file is in, "%n" for
file's number in the thumbnail buffer, and "%s" for the file size.

The default format has been updated to use this.  If you prefer the
old format, add this to your Init file:

    (setopt image-dired-display-properties-format "%b: %f (%t): %c")</code></pre><pre><code>New faces for the header line of the thumbnail buffer.
These faces correspond to different parts of the header line, as
specified in 'image-dired-display-properties-format':
- 'image-dired-thumb-header-directory-name'
- 'image-dired-thumb-header-file-name'
- 'image-dired-thumb-header-file-size'
- 'image-dired-thumb-header-image-count'</code></pre><pre><code>PDF support.
Image-Dired now displays thumbnails for PDF files.  Type 'RET' on a
PDF file in the thumbnail buffer to visit the corresponding PDF.</code></pre><pre><code>Support GraphicsMagick command line tools.
Support for the GraphicsMagick command line tool ("gm") has been
added, and is used when it is available instead of ImageMagick.</code></pre><pre><code>Support Thumbnail Managing Standard v0.9.0 (Dec 2020).
This standard allows sharing generated thumbnails across different
programs.  Version 0.9.0 adds two larger thumbnail sizes: 512x512 and
1024x1024 pixels.  See the user option 'image-dired-thumbnail-storage'
to use it; it is not enabled by default.</code></pre><pre><code>Reduce dependency on external "exiftool" program.
The 'image-dired-copy-with-exif-file-name' command no longer requires
an external "exiftool" program to be available.  The user options
'image-dired-cmd-read-exif-data-program' and
'image-dired-cmd-read-exif-data-options' are now obsolete.</code></pre><pre><code>Support for bookmark.el.
The command 'bookmark-set' (bound to 'C-x r m') is now supported in
the thumbnail view, and will create a bookmark that opens the current
directory in Image-Dired.</code></pre><p>Nifty addition to Emacs’s general-purpose bookmarking tool.</p><pre><code>The 'image-dired-slideshow-start' command no longer prompts.
It no longer inconveniently prompts for a number of images and a
delay: it runs indefinitely, but stops automatically on any command.
You can set the delay with a prefix argument, or a negative prefix
argument to prompt for a delay.  Customize the user option
'image-dired-slideshow-delay' to change the default from 5 seconds.</code></pre><pre><code>'image-dired-show-all-from-dir-max-files' increased to 1000.
This user option controls asking for confirmation when starting
Image-Dired in a directory with many files.  Since Image-Dired creates
thumbnails in the background in recent versions, this is not as
important as it used to be.  You can now also customize this option to
nil to disable this confirmation completely.</code></pre><pre><code>'image-dired-thumb-size' increased to 128.</code></pre><pre><code>'image-dired-db-file' renamed to 'image-dired-tags-db-file'.</code></pre><pre><code>'image-dired-display-image-mode' renamed to 'image-dired-image-mode'.
The corresponding keymap is now named 'image-dired-image-mode-map'.</code></pre><pre><code>Some commands have been renamed to be shorter.
- 'image-dired-display-thumbnail-original-image' has been renamed to
  'image-dired-display-this'.
- 'image-dired-display-next-thumbnail-original' has been renamed to
  'image-dired-display-next'.
- 'image-dired-display-previous-thumbnail-original' has been renamed
  to 'image-dired-display-previous'.
The old names are now obsolete aliases.</code></pre><pre><code>'image-dired-thumb-{height,width}' are now obsolete.
Customize 'image-dired-thumb-size' instead, which will set both the
height and width.</code></pre><pre><code>HTML image gallery generation is now obsolete.
The 'image-dired-gallery-generate' command and these user options are
now obsolete: 'image-dired-gallery-thumb-image-root-url',
'image-dired-gallery-hidden-tags', 'image-dired-gallery-dir',
'image-dired-gallery-image-root-url'.</code></pre><pre><code>'image-dired-rotate-thumbnail-{left,right}' are now obsolete.
Instead, use commands 'image-dired-refresh-thumb' to generate a new
thumbnail, or 'image-rotate' to rotate the thumbnail without updating
the thumbnail file.</code></pre><pre><code>Some commands and user options are now obsolete.
Since 'image-dired-display-image-mode' is now based on 'image-mode',
some commands and user options are no longer needed and are now obsolete:
'image-dired-cmd-create-temp-image-options',
'image-dired-cmd-create-temp-image-program',
'image-dired-display-current-image-full',
'image-dired-display-current-image-sized',
'image-dired-display-window-height-correction',
'image-dired-display-window-width-correction',
'image-dired-temp-image-file'.</code></pre><pre><code>New function 'exif-field'.
This is a convenience function to extract the field data from
'exif-parse-file' and 'exif-parse-buffer'.</code></pre><h3 id="bookmarks">Bookmarks</h3><p>Bookmarks is Emacs’s general-purpose bookmark facility. Nearly anything can be bookmarked, recalled and edited. It’s a powerful feature, and greatly underused. Try bookmarking: files, eww buffers, info node buffers, dired, image dired, and more.</p><pre><code>'list-bookmarks' now includes a type column.
Types are registered via a 'bookmark-handler-type' symbol property on
the jumping function.</code></pre><pre><code>'bookmark-sort-flag' can now be set to 'last-modified'.
This will display bookmark list from most recently set to least
recently set.</code></pre><pre><code>When editing a bookmark annotation, 'C-c C-k' will now cancel.
It is bound to the new command 'bookmark-edit-annotation-cancel'.</code></pre><pre><code>New user option 'bookmark-fringe-mark'.
This option controls the bitmap used to indicate bookmarks in the
fringe (or nil to disable showing this marker).</code></pre><h3 id="xwidget">Xwidget</h3><p>Xwidget is an optional, compiled module that – in theory – grants access to ‘widgets’ like Chromium in Emacs. I say <em>in theory</em>, as it can be quite unstable.</p><pre><code>New user option 'xwidget-webkit-buffer-name-format'.
This option controls how xwidget-webkit buffers are named.</code></pre><pre><code>New user option 'xwidget-webkit-cookie-file'.
This option controls whether the xwidget-webkit buffers save cookies
set by web pages, and if so, in which file to save them.</code></pre><pre><code>New minor mode 'xwidget-webkit-edit-mode'.
When this mode is enabled, self-inserting characters and other common
web browser shortcut keys are redefined to send themselves to the
WebKit widget.</code></pre><pre><code>New minor mode 'xwidget-webkit-isearch-mode'.
This mode acts similarly to incremental search, and allows searching
the contents of a WebKit widget.  In xwidget-webkit mode, it is bound
to 'C-s' and 'C-r'.</code></pre><p>Seems useful, if it behaves like isearch does elsewhere.</p><pre><code>New command 'xwidget-webkit-browse-history'.
This command displays a buffer containing the page load history of
the current WebKit widget, and allows you to navigate it.</code></pre><pre><code>On X, the WebKit inspector is now available inside xwidgets.
To access the inspector, right click on the widget and select "Inspect
Element".</code></pre><pre><code>"Open in New Window" in a WebKit widget's context menu now works.
The newly created buffer will be displayed via 'display-buffer', which
can be customized through the usual mechanism of 'display-buffer-alist'
and friends.</code></pre><h3 id="tramp">Tramp</h3><p>Tramp is the remote connection tool in Emacs. It’s excellent, and one of my favorite features.</p><pre><code>New connection methods "docker", "podman" and "kubernetes".
They allow accessing containers provided by Docker and similar
programs.</code></pre><p>Great feature additions. Now you can trivially <code>cd</code> into a docker container from <a href="https://www.masteringemacs.org/article/complete-guide-mastering-eshell">Eshell</a>, from <code>find-file</code>, or anywhere else that accepts a filepath.</p><pre><code>Tramp supports abbreviating remote home directories now.
When calling 'abbreviate-file-name' on a Tramp file name, the result
will abbreviate the user's home directory, for example by abbreviating
"/ssh:user@host:/home/user" to "/ssh:user@host:~".</code></pre><pre><code>New user option 'tramp-use-scp-direct-remote-copying'.
When set to non-nil, Tramp does not copy files between two remote
hosts via a local copy in its temporary directory, but lets the 'scp'
command do this job.</code></pre><pre><code>Proper password prompts for methods "doas", "sudo" and "sudoedit".
The password prompts for these methods reflect now the credentials of
the user requesting such a connection, and not of the user who is the
target.  This has always been needed, just the password prompt and the
related 'auth-sources' entry were wrong.</code></pre><pre><code>New user option 'tramp-completion-use-cache'.
During user and host name completion in the minibuffer, results from
Tramp's connection cache are taken into account.  This can be disabled
by setting the user option 'tramp-completion-use-cache' to nil.</code></pre><h3 id="browse-url">Browse URL</h3><p>Browse url opens up an URL in your browser.</p><pre><code>New user option 'browse-url-default-scheme'.
This user option decides which URL scheme that 'browse-url' and
related functions will use by default.  For example, you could
customize this to "https" to always prefer HTTPS URLs.</code></pre><pre><code>New user option 'browse-url-irc-function'.
This option specifies a function for opening "irc://" links.  It
defaults to the new function 'browse-url-irc'.</code></pre><pre><code>New function 'browse-url-irc'.
This multipurpose autoloaded function can be used for opening "irc://"
and "ircs://" URLS by any caller that passes a URL string as an initial
arg.</code></pre><pre><code>Support for the Netscape web browser has been removed.
This support has been obsolete since Emacs 25.1.  The final version of
the Netscape web browser was released in February, 2008.</code></pre><pre><code>Support for the Galeon web browser has been removed.
This support has been obsolete since Emacs 25.1.  The final version of
the Galeon web browser was released in September, 2008.</code></pre><pre><code>Support for the Mozilla web browser is now obsolete.
Note that this historical web browser is different from Mozilla
Firefox; it is its predecessor.</code></pre><h3 id="python-mode">Python Mode</h3><pre><code>Project shells and a new user option 'python-shell-dedicated'.
When called with a prefix argument, 'run-python' now offers the choice
of creating a shell dedicated to the current project.  This shell runs
in the project root directory and is shared among all project buffers.

Without a prefix argument, the kind of shell (buffer-dedicated,
project-dedicated or global) is specified by the new
'python-shell-dedicated' user option.</code></pre><p>A welcome addition. This is the benefit of having a builtin <em>and</em> well-supported project tool in Emacs.</p><h3 id="ruby-mode">Ruby Mode</h3><pre><code>New user option 'ruby-toggle-block-space-before-parameters'.</code></pre><pre><code>Support for endless methods.</code></pre><pre><code>New user options that determine indentation logic.
'ruby-method-params-indent', 'ruby-block-indent',
'ruby-after-operator-indent', 'ruby-method-call-indent',
'ruby-parenless-call-arguments-indent'.  See the docstrings for
explanations and examples.</code></pre><h3 id="eshell-1">Eshell</h3><p>Eshell is Emacs’s shell written in elisp.</p><pre><code>New feature to easily bypass Eshell's own pipelining.
Prefixing '|', '&lt;' or '&gt;' with an asterisk, i.e. '*|', '*&lt;' or '*&gt;',
will cause the whole command to be passed to the operating system
shell.  This is particularly useful to bypass Eshell's own pipelining
support for pipelines which will move a lot of data.  See section
"Running Shell Pipelines Natively" in the Eshell manual, node
"(eshell) Pipelines".</code></pre><p>Pipelining in eshell was never all that feature complete; it could also be slow. These redirections allow us to circumvent eshell in favor of a shell that implements it correctly – and expediently.</p><pre><code>New module to help supplying absolute file names to remote commands.
After enabling the new 'eshell-elecslash' module, typing a forward
slash as the first character of a command line argument will
automatically insert the Tramp prefix.  The automatic insertion
applies only when 'default-directory' is remote and the command is a
Lisp function.  This frees you from having to keep track of whether
commands are Lisp function or external when supplying absolute file
name arguments.  See the "(eshell) Electric forward slash" node in the
Eshell manual for details.</code></pre><p>One annoyance about <code>cd</code>’ing into a remote directory in Tramp was always how easy it was to accidentally <code>cd</code> <em>out</em> of it again. This will go some way towards alleviating that.</p><pre><code>Improved support for redirection operators in Eshell.
Eshell now supports a wider variety of redirection operators.  For
example, you can now redirect both stdout and stderr via '&amp;&gt;' or
duplicate one output handle to another via 'NEW-FD&gt;&amp;OLD-FD'.  For more
information, see the "(eshell) Redirection" node in the Eshell manual.</code></pre><pre><code>New eshell built-in command 'doas'.
The privilege-escalation program 'doas' has been added to the existing
'su' and 'sudo' commands from the 'eshell-tramp' module.  The external
command may still be accessed by using '*doas'.</code></pre><p><code>doas</code> is slowly taking over as a smaller – safer – alternative to the sprawling <code>sudo</code> program.</p><pre><code>Double-quoting an Eshell expansion now treats the result as a single string.
If an Eshell expansion like '$FOO' is surrounded by double quotes, the
result will always be a single string, no matter the type that would
otherwise be returned.</code></pre><pre><code>Concatenating Eshell expansions now works more similarly to other shells.
When concatenating an Eshell expansion that returns a list, "adjacent"
elements of each operand are now concatenated together,
e.g. '$(list "a" "b")c' returns '("a" "bc")'.  See the "(eshell)
Expansion" node in the Eshell manual for more details.</code></pre><pre><code>Eshell subcommands with multiline numeric output return lists of numbers.
If every line of the output of an Eshell subcommand like '${COMMAND}'
is numeric, the result will be a list of numbers (or a single number
if only one line of output).  Previously, this only converted numbers
when there was a single line of output.</code></pre><pre><code>Built-in Eshell commands now follow Posix/GNU argument syntax conventions.
Built-in commands in Eshell now accept command-line options with
values passed as a single token, such as '-oVALUE' or
'--option=VALUE'.  New commands can take advantage of this with the
'eshell-eval-using-options' macro.  See "Defining new built-in
commands" in the "(eshell) Built-ins" node of the Eshell manual.</code></pre><pre><code>Eshell globs ending with "/" now match only directories.
Additionally, globs ending with "**/" or "***/" no longer raise an
error, and now expand to all directories recursively (following
symlinks in the latter case).</code></pre><pre><code>Lisp forms in Eshell now treat a nil result as a failed exit status.
When executing a command that looks like '(lisp form)' and returns
nil, Eshell will set the exit status (available in the '$?'
variable) to 2.  This allows commands like that to be used in
conditionals.  To change this behavior, customize the new
'eshell-lisp-form-nil-is-failure' user option.</code></pre><h3 id="shell">Shell</h3><p>Shell mode is Emacs’s wrapper around a common shell, usually bash or the cmd.exe on Windows.</p><pre><code>New user option 'shell-kill-buffer-on-exit'.

Emacs now comes with the Eglot package, which enhances various Emacs
features, such as completion, documentation, error detection, etc.,
based on data provided by language servers using the Language Server
Protocol (LSP).  See the new Info manual "(eglot) Top" for more.  Also
see "etc/EGLOT-NEWS".

If you want to be able to use 'package-install' to upgrade Eglot to
newer versions released on GNU ELPA, customize the new option
'package-install-upgrade-built-in' to a non-nil value.</code></pre><p>You should <em>definitely</em> read the manual for this package if you want to use it. You’ll want to make sure you have the right language server, et al. But, generally speaking, <code>M-x eglot</code> is all you need.</p><pre><code>use-package: Declarative package configuration.
use-package is now shipped with Emacs.  It provides the 'use-package'

If you want to be able to use 'package-install' to upgrade use-package

'package-install-upgrade-built-in' to a non-nil value.</code></pre><pre><code>New package 'wallpaper'.
This package provides the command 'wallpaper-set', which sets the
desktop background image.  Depending on the system and the desktop,
this may require an external program (such as "swaybg", "gm",
"display" or "xloadimage").  If so, a suitable command should be
detected automatically in most cases.  It can also be customized
manually if needed, using the new user options 'wallpaper-command' and
'wallpaper-command-args'.</code></pre><p>A fine complement to <code>M-x zone</code>, Emacs’s screensaver.</p><pre><code>New package 'oclosure'.
This allows the creation of OClosures, which are "functions with

This is a dark version of the 'leuven' theme.</code></pre><pre><code>New mode 'erts-mode'.
This mode is used to edit files geared towards testing actions in
Emacs buffers, like indentation and the like.  The new ert function
'ert-test-erts-file' is used to parse these files.</code></pre><p>One of the hardest things about writing tests for a text editor package is having to keep tabs on the point, the text, the window layout, etc. <em>Anything</em> that helps make that easier is a win for everyone.</p><pre><code>New major mode 'js-json-mode'.
This is a lightweight variant of 'js-mode' that is used by default
when visiting JSON files.</code></pre><pre><code>New major mode 'csharp-mode'.
A major mode based on CC Mode for editing programs in the C# language.
This mode is auto-enabled for files with the ".cs" extension.</code></pre><pre><code>New major modes based on the tree-sitter library.
These new major modes are available if Emacs was built with the
tree-sitter library.  They provide support for font-locking,
indentation, and navigation by defuns based on parsing the buffer text
by a tree-sitter parser.  Some major modes also offer support for
Imenu and 'which-func'.

The new modes based on tree-sitter are for now entirely optional, and
you must turn them on manually, or load them in your init file, or
customize 'auto-mode-alist' to turn them on automatically for certain
files.  You can also customize 'major-mode-remap-alist' to
automatically turn on some tree-sitter based modes for the same files
for which a "built-in" mode would be turned on.  For example:

    (add-to-list 'major-mode-remap-alist '(ruby-mode . ruby-ts-mode))

If you try these modes and don't like them, you can go back to the
"built-in" modes by restarting Emacs.  (If you use desktop.el to save
and restore Emacs sessions, make sure no buffer under these modes is
recorded in the desktop file, before restarting.)  But please tell us
why you didn't like the tree-sitter based modes, so that we could try
improving them.

Each major mode based on tree-sitter needs a language grammar library,
usually named "libtree-sitter-LANG.so" ("libtree-sitter-LANG.dll" on
MS-Windows), where LANG is the corresponding language name.  Emacs
looks for these libraries in the following places:

 . in the directories mentioned in the list 'treesit-extra-load-path'
 . in the "tree-sitter" subdirectory of your 'user-emacs-directory'
   (by default, "~/.emacs.d/tree-sitter")
 . in the standard system directories where other shared libraries are
   usually installed

We recommend to install these libraries in one of the standard system
locations (the last place in the above list).

If a language grammar library required by a mode is not found in any
of the above places, the mode will display a warning when you try to
turn it on.</code></pre><p>This is a good summary of what you need to do to start using tree-sitter. But, as I’ve said before, it can be a bit gnarly if you haven’t done this sort of thing before.

Emacs now uses an implementation of overlays that is much more
efficient than the original one, and should speed up all the
operations that involve overlays, especially when there are lots of
them in a buffer.

As result of this, some minor incompatibilities in behavior could be
observed, as described below.  Except those minor incompatibilities,
no other changes in behavior of overlays should be visible on the Lisp
or user level, with the exception of better performance and the order
of overlays returned by functions that don't promise any particular
order.</code></pre><p>Overlays are ranges of positions in Emacs that you can apply to a buffer and assign all manner of metadata and contextual information. This is how a wide range of Emacs’s features work: from flymake errors to buttons to many other things. Speedups and efficiency gains here pay dividends everywhere else.</p><pre><code>The function 'overlay-recenter' is now a no-op.
This function does nothing, and in particular has no effect on the
value returned by 'overlay-lists'.  The purpose of 'overlay-recenter'
was to allow more efficient lookup of overlays around a certain buffer
position; however with the new implementation the lookup of overlays
is efficient regardless of their position, and there's no longer any
need to "optimize" the lookup, nor any notion of a "center" of the
overlays.</code></pre><pre><code>The function 'overlay-lists' returns one unified list of overlays.
This function used to return a cons of two lists, one with overlays
before the "center" position, the other after that "center".  It now
returns a list whose 'car' is the list of all the buffer overlays, and
whose 'cdr' is always nil.</code></pre><pre><code>'format-prompt' now uses 'substitute-command-keys'.
This means that both the prompt and 'minibuffer-default-prompt-format'
will have key definitions and single quotes handled specially.</code></pre><pre><code>New function 'substitute-quotes'.
This function works like 'substitute-command-keys' but only
substitutes quote characters.</code></pre><pre><code>'find-image' now uses 'create-image'.
This means that images found through 'find-image' also have
auto-scaling applied.  (This only makes a difference on HiDPI
displays.)</code></pre><pre><code>Changes in how "raw" in-memory XBM images are specified.
Some years back Emacs gained the ability to scale images, and you
could then specify ':width' and ':height' when using 'create-image' on all
image types -- except XBM images, because this format already used the
':width' and ':height' arguments to specify the width/height of the "raw"
in-memory format.  This meant that if you used these specifications
on, for instance, XBM files, Emacs would refuse to display them.  This
has been changed, and ':width'/':height' now works as with all other image
formats, and the way to specify the width/height of the "raw"
in-memory format is now by using ':data-width' and ':data-height'.</code></pre><pre><code>"loaddefs.el" generation has been reimplemented.
The various "loaddefs.el" files in the Emacs tree (which contain
information about autoloads, built-in packages and package prefixes)
used to be generated by functions in autoloads.el.  These are now
generated by loaddefs-gen.el instead.  This leads to functionally
equivalent "loaddefs.el" files, but they do not use exactly the same
syntax, so using 'M-x update-file-autoloads' no longer works.  (This
didn't work well in most files in the past, either, but it will now
signal an error in any file.)

In addition, files are scanned in a slightly different way.
Previously, ';;;###' specs inside a top-level form (i.e., something
like '(when ... ;;;### ...)' would be ignored.  They are now parsed as
usual.</code></pre><pre><code>Themes have special autoload cookies.
All built-in themes are scraped for ';;;###theme-autoload' cookies
that are loaded along with the regular auto-loaded code.</code></pre><pre><code>'buffer-modified-p' has been extended.
This function was previously documented to return only nil or t.  This
has been changed to nil/'autosaved'/non-nil.  The new 'autosaved'
value means that the buffer is modified, but that it hasn't been
modified since the time of last auto-save.</code></pre><pre><code>'with-silent-modifications' also restores buffer autosave status.
'with-silent-modifications' is a macro meant to be used by the font
locking machinery to allow applying text properties without changing
the modification status of the buffer.  However, it didn't restore the
buffer autosave status, so applying font locking to a modified buffer
that had already been auto-saved would trigger another auto-saving.
This is no longer the case.</code></pre><pre><code>'prin1' doesn't always escape "." and "?" in symbols any more.
Previously, symbols like 'foo.bar' would be printed by 'prin1' as
"foo\.bar".  This now prints as "foo.bar" instead.  The Emacs Lisp
reader interprets these strings as referring to the same symbol, so
this is virtually always backwards-compatible, but there may
theoretically be code out there that expects a specific printed
representation.

The same is the case with the "?" character: The 'foo?' symbol is now
printed as "foo?" instead of "foo\?".

If the "." and "?" characters are the first character in the symbol,
they will still be escaped, so the '.foo' symbol is still printed as
"\.foo" and the '?bar' symbol is still printed as "\?bar".</code></pre><pre><code>Remapping 'mode-line' face no longer works as expected.
'mode-line' is now the parent face of the new 'mode-line-active' face,
and remapping parent of basic faces does not work reliably.
Instead of remapping 'mode-line', you have to remap 'mode-line-active'.</code></pre><pre><code>'make-process' has been extended to support ptys when ':stderr' is set.
Previously, setting ':stderr' to a non-nil value would force the
process's connection to use pipes.  Now, Emacs will use a pty for
stdin and stdout if requested no matter the value of ':stderr'.</code></pre><p>PTYs (pseudo-terminals) are generally much faster and better to use than pipes when you want to interface with a sub-process.</p><pre><code>User option 'mail-source-ignore-errors' is now obsolete.
The whole mechanism for prompting users to continue in case of
mail-source errors has been removed, so this option is no longer
needed.</code></pre><h3 id="fonts">Fonts</h3><pre><code>Emacs now supports 'medium' fonts.
Emacs previously didn't distinguish between the 'regular'/'normal'
weight and the 'medium' weight, but it now also supports the (heavier)
'medium' weight.  However, this means that if you specify a weight of
'normal' and the font doesn't have this weight, Emacs won't find the
font spec.  In these cases, replacing ":weight 'normal" with ":weight
'medium" should fix the issue.</code></pre><p>Better and more sophisticated font rendering is always a positive. Emacs has made so many strides in this area over the years. Don’t forget that <code>M-x customize-face default</code> is still a good way to experiment with fonts.</p><pre><code>Keymap descriptions by Help commands have changed.
'help--describe-command', 'C-h b' and associated functions that output
keymap descriptions have changed.  In particular, prefix commands are
not output at all, and instead of "??" for closures/functions, these
functions output "[closure]"/"[lambda]".  You can get back the old
behavior of including prefix commands by customizing the new option
'describe-bindings-show-prefix-commands' to a non-nil value.</code></pre><pre><code>'downcase' details have changed slightly.
In certain locales, changing the case of an ASCII-range character may
turn it into a multibyte character, most notably with "I" in Turkish
(the lowercase is "ı", 0x0131).  Previously, 'downcase' on a unibyte
string was buggy, and would mistakenly just return the lower byte of
this, 0x31 (the digit "1").  'downcase' on a unibyte string has now
been changed to downcase such characters as if they were ASCII.  To
get proper locale-dependent downcasing, the string has to be converted
to multibyte first.  (This goes for the other case-changing functions,
too.)</code></pre><pre><code>Functions in 'tramp-foreign-file-name-handler-alist' have changed.
Functions to determine which Tramp file name handler to use are now
passed a file name in dissected form (via 'tramp-dissect-file-name')
instead of in string form.</code></pre><pre><code>'def' indentation changes.
In 'emacs-lisp-mode', forms with a symbol with a name that start with
"def" have been automatically indented as if they were 'defun'-like
forms, for instance:

    (defzot 1
      2 3)

This heuristic has now been removed, and all functions/macros that
want to be indented this way have to be marked with

    (declare (indent defun))

or the like.  If the function/macro definition itself can't be
changed, the indentation can also be adjusted by saying something
like:

    (put 'defzot 'lisp-indent-function 'defun)</code></pre><pre><code>The 'inhibit-changing-match-data' variable is now obsolete.
Instead, functions like 'string-match' and 'looking-at' now take an
optional INHIBIT-MODIFY argument.</code></pre><pre><code>'gnus-define-keys' is now obsolete.

'lsh' behaves in somewhat surprising and platform-dependent ways for
negative arguments, and is generally slower than 'ash', which should be

'lsh' with the construct '(with-suppressed-warnings ((suspicious lsh)) ...)',

Emacs has a number of rather obscure generalized variables defined,
that, for instance, allowed you to say things like:

    (setf (point-min) 4)

These never caught on and have been made obsolete.  The form above,
for instance, is the same as saying

    (narrow-to-region 4 (point-max))

The following generalized variables have been made obsolete:
'buffer-file-name', 'buffer-local-value', 'buffer-modified-p',
'buffer-name', 'buffer-string', 'buffer-substring', 'current-buffer',
'current-column', 'current-global-map', 'current-input-mode',

Previously, the 'dotimes' loop counter could be modified inside the
loop body, but only in code using dynamic binding.  Now the behavior
is the same as when using lexical binding: changes to the loop
variable have no effect on subsequent iterations.  That is,

    (dotimes (i 10)
      (print i)
      (setq i (+ i 6)))

now always prints the numbers 0 .. 9.

</code></pre><h3 id="lisp-changes-in-emacs-29.1">Lisp Changes in Emacs 29.1</h3><pre><code>Interpreted closures are "safe for space".
As was already the case for byte-compiled closures, instead of capturing
the whole current lexical environment, interpreted closures now only
capture the part of the environment that they need.
The previous behavior could occasionally lead to memory leaks or
to problems where a printed closure would not be 'read'able because
of an un'read'able value in an unrelated lexical variable.</code></pre><pre><code>New accessor function 'file-attribute-file-identifier'.
It returns the list of the inode number and device identifier
retrieved by 'file-attributes'.  This value can be used to identify a
file uniquely.  The device identifier can be a single number or (for
remote files) a cons of 2 numbers.</code></pre><pre><code>New macro 'while-let'.
This is like 'when-let', but repeats until a binding form is nil.</code></pre><p>Useful addition. I’m liking all the <code>xxx-let</code> bindings they’ve been adding over the years. It cuts down on chaff and it retains readability.</p><pre><code>New function 'make-obsolete-generalized-variable'.
This can be used to mark setters used by 'setf' as obsolete, and the
byte-compiler will then warn about using them.</code></pre><pre><code>New functions 'pos-eol' and 'pos-bol'.
These are like 'line-end-position' and 'line-beginning-position'
(respectively), but ignore fields (and are more efficient).</code></pre><pre><code>New function 'compiled-function-p'.
This returns non-nil if its argument is either a built-in, or a
byte-compiled, or a natively-compiled function object, or a function
loaded from a dynamic module.</code></pre><pre><code>'deactivate-mark' can have new value 'dont-save'.
This value means that Emacs should deactivate the mark as usual, but
without setting the primary selection, if 'select-active-regions' is
enabled.</code></pre><pre><code>New 'declare' form 'interactive-args'.
This can be used to specify what forms to put into 'command-history'
when executing commands interactively.</code></pre><pre><code>The FORM argument of 'time-convert' is mandatory.
'time-convert' can still be called without it, as before, but the
compiler now emits a warning about this deprecated usage.</code></pre><pre><code>Emacs now supports user-customizable and themable icons.
These can be used for buttons in buffers and the like.  See the
"(elisp) Icons" and "(emacs) Icons" nodes in the manuals for details.</code></pre><pre><code>New arguments MESSAGE and TIMEOUT of 'set-transient-map'.
MESSAGE specifies a message to display after activating the transient
map, including a special formatting spec to list available keys.
TIMEOUT is the idle time after which to deactivate the transient map.
The default timeout value can be defined by the new variable
'set-transient-map-timeout'.</code></pre><pre><code>New forms 'with-restriction' and 'without-restriction'.
These forms can be used as enhanced alternatives to the
'save-restriction' form combined with, respectively,
'narrow-to-region' and 'widen'.  They also accept an optional label
argument, with which labeled narrowings can be created and lifted.
See the "(elisp) Narrowing" node for details.</code></pre><h3 id="connection-local-variables">Connection Local Variables</h3><pre><code>Some connection-local variables are now user options.
The variables 'connection-local-profile-alist' and
'connection-local-criteria-alist' are now user options, in order to
make it more convenient to inspect and modify them.</code></pre><pre><code>New function 'connection-local-update-profile-variables'.
This function allows to modify the settings of an existing
connection-local profile.</code></pre><pre><code>New macro 'with-connection-local-application-variables'.
This macro works like 'with-connection-local-variables', but it allows
using another application instead of 'tramp'.  This is useful when
running code in a buffer where Tramp has already set some
connection-local variables.</code></pre><pre><code>New macro 'setq-connection-local'.
This allows dynamically setting variable values for a particular
connection within the body of 'with-connection-local-{application-}variables'.
See the "(elisp) Connection Local Variables" node in the Lisp
Reference manual for more information.</code></pre><pre><code>'plist-get', 'plist-put' and 'plist-member' are no longer limited to 'eq'.
These function now take an optional comparison PREDICATE argument.</code></pre><pre><code>'read-multiple-choice' can now use long-form answers.</code></pre><pre><code>'M-s c' in 'read-regexp' now toggles case folding.</code></pre><pre><code>'completing-read' now allows a function as its REQUIRE-MATCH argument.
This function is called to see whether what the user has typed is a
match.  This is also available from functions that call
'completing-read', like 'read-file-name'.</code></pre><pre><code>'posn-col-row' can now give position data based on windows.
Previously, it reported data only based on the frame.</code></pre><pre><code>'file-expand-wildcards' can now also take a regexp as PATTERN argument.</code></pre><pre><code>vc-mtn (the VC backend for Monotone) has been made obsolete.</code></pre><pre><code>'gui-set-selection' can specify different values for different data types.
If DATA is a string, then its text properties are searched for values
for each specific data type while the selection is being converted.</code></pre><pre><code>New eldoc function 'elisp-eldoc-var-docstring-with-value'.
This function includes the current value of the variable in eldoc display
and can be used as a more detailed alternative to 'elisp-eldoc-var-docstring'.</code></pre><pre><code>'save-some-buffers' can now be extended to save other things.
Traditionally, 'save-some-buffers' saved buffers, and also saved
abbrevs.  This has been generalized via the
'save-some-buffers-functions' variable, and packages can now register
things to be saved.</code></pre><pre><code>New function 'string-equal-ignore-case'.
This compares strings ignoring case differences.</code></pre><pre><code>'symbol-file' can now report natively-compiled ".eln" files.
If Emacs was built with native-compilation enabled, Lisp programs can
now call 'symbol-file' with the new optional 3rd argument non-nil to
request the name of the ".eln" file which defined a given symbol.</code></pre><pre><code>New macro 'with-memoization' provides a very primitive form of memoization.</code></pre><pre><code>'max-char' can now report the maximum codepoint according to Unicode.
When called with a new optional argument UNICODE non-nil, 'max-char'
will now report the maximum valid codepoint defined by the Unicode
Standard.</code></pre><h3 id="seq">Seq</h3><p>Seq is a library that adds a range of functions that operate on all manner of sequences. It’s filled a gaping void that the likes of <code>dash.el</code> also tries to fill.</p><pre><code>New function 'seq-split'.
This returns a list of sub-sequences of the specified sequence.</code></pre><pre><code>New function 'seq-remove-at-position'.
This function returns a copy of the specified sequence with the
element at a given (zero-based) index removed.</code></pre><pre><code>New function 'seq-positions'.
This returns a list of the (zero-based) indices of elements matching a
given predicate in the specified sequence.</code></pre><pre><code>New function 'seq-keep'.
This is like 'seq-map', but removes all nil results from the returned
list.</code></pre><h3 id="themes">Themes</h3><p>Color themes, that is.</p><pre><code>New hooks 'enable-theme-functions' and 'disable-theme-functions'.
These are run after enabling and disabling a theme, respectively.</code></pre><pre><code>Themes can now be made obsolete.
Using 'make-obsolete' on a theme is now supported.  This will make
'load-theme' issue a warning when loading the theme.</code></pre><pre><code>New hook 'display-monitors-changed-functions'.
It is called whenever the configuration of different monitors on a
display changes.</code></pre><pre><code>'prin1' and 'prin1-to-string' now take an optional OVERRIDES argument.
This argument can be used to override values of print-related settings.</code></pre><pre><code>New minor mode 'header-line-indent-mode'.
This is meant to be used by Lisp programs that show a header line
which should be kept aligned with the buffer contents when the user
switches 'display-line-numbers-mode' on or off, and when the width of
line-number display changes.  See the "(elisp) Header Lines" node in
the Emacs Lisp Reference manual for more information.</code></pre><pre><code>New global minor mode 'lost-selection-mode'.
This global minor mode makes Emacs deactivate the mark in all buffers
when the primary selection is obtained by another program.</code></pre><pre><code>On X, Emacs will try to preserve selection ownership when a frame is deleted.
This means that if you make Emacs the owner of a selection, such as by
selecting some text into the clipboard or primary selection, and then
delete the current frame, you will still be able to insert the
contents of that selection into other programs as long as another
frame is open on the same display.  This behavior can be disabled by
setting the user option 'x-auto-preserve-selections' to nil.</code></pre><pre><code>New predicate 'char-uppercase-p'.
This returns non-nil if its argument its an uppercase character.</code></pre><h3 id="byte-compilation">Byte Compilation</h3><pre><code>Byte compilation will now warn about some quoting mistakes in docstrings.
When writing code snippets that contains the "'" character (APOSTROPHE),
that quote character has to be escaped to avoid Emacs displaying it as
"’" (LEFT SINGLE QUOTATION MARK), which would make code examples like

    (setq foo '(1 2 3))

invalid.  Emacs will now warn during byte compilation if it sees
something like that, and also warn about when using RIGHT/LEFT SINGLE
QUOTATION MARK directly.  In both these cases, if these characters
should really be present in the docstring, they should be quoted with
"\=".</code></pre><pre><code>Byte compilation will now warn about some malformed 'defcustom' types.
It is very common to write 'defcustom' types on the form:

    :type '(choice (const :tag "foo" 'bar))

I.e., double-quoting the 'bar', which is almost never the correct
value.  The byte compiler will now issue a warning if it encounters
these forms.</code></pre><pre><code>'restore-buffer-modified-p' can now alter buffer auto-save state.
With a FLAG value of 'autosaved', it will mark the buffer as having
been auto-saved since the time of last modification.</code></pre><pre><code>New minor mode 'isearch-fold-quotes-mode'.
This sets up 'search-default-mode' so that quote characters are
char-folded into each other.  It is used, by default, in "*Help*" and
"*info*" buffers.</code></pre><p>We talked about this before.</p><pre><code>New macro 'buffer-local-set-state'.
This is a helper macro to be used by minor modes that wish to restore
buffer-local variables back to their original states when the mode is
switched off.</code></pre><p>This should help minor mode authors that temporarily alter values restore them to their correct, former values without keeping a copy of the values around.</p><pre><code>New macro 'with-buffer-unmodified-if-unchanged'.
If the buffer is marked as unmodified, and code does modifications
that, in total, means that the buffer is identical to the buffer
before, mark the buffer as unmodified again.</code></pre><pre><code>New function 'malloc-trim'.
This function allows returning unused memory back to the operating
system, and is mainly meant as a debugging tool.  It is currently
available only when Emacs was built with glibc as the C library.</code></pre><pre><code>'x-show-tip' no longer hard-codes a timeout default.
The new variable 'x-show-tooltip-timeout' allows the user to alter
this for packages that don't use 'tooltip-show', but instead call the
lower level function directly.</code></pre><pre><code>New function 'current-cpu-time'.
It gives access to the CPU time used by the Emacs process, for
example for benchmarking purposes.</code></pre><pre><code>New function 'string-edit'.
This is meant to be used when the user has to edit a (potentially)
long string.  It pops up a new buffer where you can edit the string,
and the provided callback is called when the user types 'C-c C-c'.</code></pre><p>Great addition. There’s a wide range of cases in Emacs where that would come in handy.</p><pre><code>New function 'read-string-from-buffer'.
This is a modal version of 'string-edit', and can be used as an
alternative to 'read-string'.</code></pre><pre><code>The return value of 'clear-message-function' is not ignored anymore.
If the function returns 'dont-clear-message', then the message is not
cleared, with the assumption that the function cleared it itself.</code></pre><pre><code>The local variables section now supports defining fallback modes.
This was previously only available when using a property line (i.e.,
putting the modes on the first line of a file).</code></pre><pre><code>New function 'flush-standard-output'.
This enables display of lines that don't end in a newline from
batch-based Emacs scripts.</code></pre><pre><code>New convenience function 'buttonize-region'.
This works like 'buttonize', but for a region instead of a string.</code></pre><pre><code>'macroexp-let2*' can omit TEST argument and use single-var bindings.</code></pre><pre><code>New macro-writing macros, 'cl-with-gensyms' and 'cl-once-only'.
See the "(cl) Macro-Writing Macros" manual section for descriptions.</code></pre><pre><code>New variable 'last-event-device' and new function 'device-class'.
On X Windows, 'last-event-device' specifies the input extension device
from which the last input event originated, and 'device-class' can be
used to determine the type of an input device.</code></pre><pre><code>Variable 'track-mouse' can have a new value 'drag-source'.
This means the same as 'dropping', but modifies the mouse position
list in reported motion events if there is no frame underneath the
mouse pointer.</code></pre><pre><code>New functions for dragging items from Emacs to other programs.
The new functions 'x-begin-drag', 'dnd-begin-file-drag',
'dnd-begin-drag-files', and 'dnd-direct-save' allow dragging contents
(such as files and text) from Emacs to other programs.</code></pre><pre><code>New function 'ietf-drums-parse-date-string'.
This function parses RFC5322 (and RFC822) date strings, and should be
used instead of 'parse-time-string' when parsing data that's standards
compliant.</code></pre><pre><code>New macro 'setopt'.
This is like 'setq', but is meant to be used for user options instead
of plain variables, and uses 'custom-set'/'set-default' to set them.</code></pre><p>Intended as a drop-in replacement for customizable options, as they can have edge triggers that run when the value changes. That is something <code>setq</code> cannot do, which can in rare cases lead to bugs.</p><pre><code>New utility predicate 'mode-line-window-selected-p'.
This is meant to be used from ':eval' mode line constructs to create
different mode line looks for selected and unselected windows.</code></pre><pre><code>New variable 'messages-buffer-name'.
This variable (defaulting to "*Messages*") allows packages to override
where messages are logged.</code></pre><pre><code>New function 'readablep'.
This function says whether an object can be written out and then
read back by the Emacs Lisp reader.</code></pre><pre><code>New variable 'print-unreadable-function'.
This variable allows changing how Emacs prints unreadable objects.</code></pre><pre><code>The user option 'polling-period' now accepts floating point values.
This means Emacs can now poll for input during Lisp execution more
frequently than once in a second.</code></pre><pre><code>New function 'bidi-string-strip-control-characters'.
This utility function is meant for displaying strings when it is
essential that there's no bidirectional context.  It removes all the
bidirectional formatting control characters (such as RLM, LRO, PDF,
etc.) from its argument string.  The characters it removes are listed
in the value of 'bidi-control-characters'.</code></pre><pre><code>The Gnus range functions have been moved to a new library, range.el.
All the old names have been made obsolete.</code></pre><pre><code>New function 'function-alias-p'.
This predicate says whether an object is a function alias, and if it
is, the alias chain is returned.</code></pre><pre><code>New variable 'lisp-directory' holds the directory of Emacs's own Lisp files.</code></pre><pre><code>New facility for handling session state: 'multisession-value'.
This can be used as a convenient way to store (simple) application
state, and the command 'list-multisession-values' allows users to list
(and edit) this data.</code></pre><pre><code>New function 'get-display-property'.
This is like 'get-text-property', but works on the 'display' text
property.</code></pre><pre><code>New function 'add-display-text-property'.
This is like 'put-text-property', but works on the 'display' text
property.</code></pre><pre><code>New 'min-width' 'display' property.
This allows setting a minimum display width for a region of text.</code></pre><pre><code>New 'cursor-face' text property.
This uses 'cursor-face' instead of the default face when cursor is on or
near the character and 'cursor-face-highlight-mode' is enabled.  The
user option 'cursor-face-highlight-nonselected-window' is similar to
'highlight-nonselected-windows', but for this property.</code></pre><pre><code>New event type 'touch-end'.
This event is sent whenever the user's finger moves off the mouse
wheel on some mice, or when the user's finger moves off the touchpad.</code></pre><pre><code>New event type 'pinch'.
This event is sent when a user performs a pinch gesture on a touchpad,
which is comprised of placing two fingers on the touchpad and moving
them towards or away from each other.</code></pre><pre><code>New hook 'x-pre-popup-menu-hook'.
This hook is run before 'x-popup-menu' is about to display a
deck-of-cards menu on screen.</code></pre><pre><code>New hook 'post-select-region-hook'.
This hook is run immediately after 'select-active-regions'.  It causes
the region to be set as the primary selection.</code></pre><pre><code>New function 'buffer-match-p'.
Check if a buffer satisfies some condition.  Some examples for
conditions can be regular expressions that match a buffer name, a
cons-cell like '(major-mode . shell-mode)' that matches any buffer
where 'major-mode' is 'shell-mode' or a combination with a condition
like '(and "\\`\\*.+\\*\\'" (major-mode . special-mode))'.</code></pre><pre><code>New function 'match-buffers'.
It uses 'buffer-match-p' to gather a list of buffers that match a
condition.</code></pre><pre><code>New optional arguments TEXT-FACE and DEFAULT-FACE for 'tooltip-show'.
They allow changing the faces used for the tooltip text and frame
colors of the resulting tooltip frame from the default 'tooltip' face.</code></pre><h3 id="text-security-and-suspiciousness">Text Security and Suspiciousness</h3><pre><code>New library textsec.el.
This library contains a number of checks for whether a string is
"suspicious".  This usually means that the string contains characters
that have glyphs that can be confused with other, more commonly used
glyphs, or contains bidirectional (or other) formatting characters
that may be used to confuse a user.</code></pre><p>This is back to what I was saying earlier about <em>confusables</em>.</p><pre><code>New user option 'textsec-check'.
If non-nil (which is the default), Emacs packages that are vulnerable
to attackers trying to confuse the users will use the textsec library
to mark suspicious text.  For instance shr/eww will mark suspicious
URLs and links, Gnus will mark suspicious From addresses, and
Message mode will query the user if the user is sending mail to a
suspicious address.  If this variable is nil, these checks are
disabled.</code></pre><pre><code>New function 'textsec-suspicious-p'.
This is the main function Emacs applications should be using to check
whether a string is suspicious.  It heeds the 'textsec-check' user
option.</code></pre><h3 id="keymaps-and-key-definitions">Keymaps and Key Definitions</h3><pre><code>'where-is-internal' can now filter events marked as non key events.
If a command maps to a key binding like '[some-event]', and 'some-event'
has a symbol plist containing a non-nil 'non-key-event' property, then
that binding is ignored by 'where-is-internal'.</code></pre><pre><code>New functions for defining and manipulating keystrokes.
These all take the syntax defined by 'key-valid-p', which is basically
the same syntax as the one accepted by the 'kbd' macro.  None of the
older functions have been deprecated or altered, but they are now
de-emphasized in the documentation, and we encourage Lisp programs to
switch to these new functions.

Use 'keymap-set' instead of 'define-key'.
Use 'keymap-global-set' instead of 'global-set-key'.
Use 'keymap-local-set' instead of 'local-set-key'.
Use 'keymap-global-unset' instead of 'global-unset-key'.
Use 'keymap-local-unset' instead of 'local-unset-key'.
Use 'keymap-substitute' instead of 'substitute-key-definition'.
Use 'keymap-set-after' instead of 'define-key-after'.
Use 'keymap-lookup' instead of 'lookup-key' and 'key-binding'.
Use 'keymap-local-lookup' instead of 'local-key-binding'.
Use 'keymap-global-lookup' instead of 'global-key-binding'.</code></pre><p>I’m glad they’re thinking about unifying the rather inconsistent key binding system in Emacs, but we’re decades away from ever obsoleting the existing ones. They’re just too ingrained (and they work fine.)</p><pre><code>'define-key' now takes an optional REMOVE argument.
If non-nil, remove the definition from the keymap.  This is subtly
different from setting a definition to nil: when the keymap has a
parent such a definition will shadow the parent's definition.</code></pre><p>Weirdly, removing (not marking <code>nil</code> or <code>ignore</code>) was quite hard.</p><pre><code>'read-multiple-choice' now takes an optional SHOW-HELP argument.
If non-nil, show the help buffer immediately, before any user input.</code></pre><pre><code>New function 'key-valid-p'.
The 'kbd' function is quite permissive, and will try to return
something usable even if the syntax of the argument isn't completely
correct.  The 'key-valid-p' predicate does a stricter check of the
syntax.</code></pre><pre><code>New function 'key-parse'.
This is like 'kbd', but only returns vectors instead of a mix of
vectors and strings.</code></pre><pre><code>New ':type' for 'defcustom' for keys.
The new 'key' type can be used for options that should be a valid key
according to 'key-valid-p'.  The type 'key-sequence' is now obsolete.</code></pre><pre><code>New function 'define-keymap'.
This function allows defining a number of keystrokes with one form.</code></pre><pre><code>New macro 'defvar-keymap'.
This macro allows defining keymap variables more conveniently.</code></pre><pre><code>'defvar-keymap' can specify 'repeat-mode' behavior for the keymap.
Use ':repeat t' to have all bindings be repeatable or for more
advanced usage:

    :repeat (:enter (commands ...) :exit (commands ...))</code></pre><pre><code>'kbd' can now be used in built-in, preloaded libraries.
It no longer depends on edmacro.el and cl-lib.el.</code></pre><pre><code>New substitution in docstrings and 'substitute-command-keys'.
Use \\`KEYSEQ' to insert a literal key sequence "KEYSEQ" (for example
\\`C-k') in a docstring or when calling 'substitute-command-keys',
which will use the same face as a command substitution.  This should
be used only when a key sequence has no corresponding command, for
example when it is read directly with 'read-key-sequence'.  It must be
a valid key sequence according to 'key-valid-p'.</code></pre><pre><code>'lookup-key' is more permissive when searching for extended menu items.
In Emacs 28.1, the behavior of 'lookup-key' was changed: when looking
for a menu item '[menu-bar Foo-Bar]', first try to find an exact
match, then look for the lowercased '[menu-bar foo-bar]'.

This has been extended, so that when looking for a menu item with a
symbol containing spaces, as in '[menu-bar Foo\ Bar]', first look for
an exact match, then the lowercased '[menu-bar foo\ bar]' and finally
'[menu-bar foo-bar]'.  This further improves backwards-compatibility
when converting menus to use 'easy-menu-define'.</code></pre><pre><code>New function 'file-name-split'.
This returns a list of all the components of a file name.</code></pre><pre><code>New function 'file-name-parent-directory'.
This returns the parent directory of a file name.</code></pre><pre><code>New macro 'with-undo-amalgamate'.
It records a particular sequence of operations as a single undo step.</code></pre><pre><code>New command 'yank-media'.
This command supports yanking non-plain-text media like images and
HTML from other applications into Emacs.  It is only supported in
modes that have registered support for it, and only on capable
platforms.</code></pre><pre><code>New command 'yank-media-types'.
This command lets you examine all data in the current selection and
the clipboard, and insert it into the buffer.</code></pre><pre><code>New variable 'yank-transform-functions'.
This variable allows the user to alter the string to be inserted.</code></pre><pre><code>New command 'yank-in-context'.
This command tries to preserve string/comment syntax when yanking.</code></pre><pre><code>New function 'minibuffer-lazy-highlight-setup'.
This function allows setting up the minibuffer so that lazy
highlighting of its content is applied in the original window.</code></pre><pre><code>New text property 'inhibit-isearch'.
If set, 'isearch' will skip these areas, which can be useful (for
instance) when covering huge amounts of data (that has no meaningful
searchable data, like image data) with a 'display' text property.</code></pre><pre><code>'insert-image' now takes an INHIBIT-ISEARCH optional argument.
It marks the image with the 'inhibit-isearch' text property, which
inhibits 'isearch' matching the STRING argument.</code></pre><pre><code>New variable 'replace-regexp-function'.
Function to call to convert the entered FROM string to an Emacs
regexp in 'query-replace' and similar commands.  It can be used to
implement a different regexp syntax for search/replace.</code></pre><pre><code>'E' in 'query-replace' now edits the replacement with exact case.
Previously, this command did the same as 'e'.</code></pre><pre><code>New variables to customize defaults of FROM for 'query-replace*' commands.
The new variable 'query-replace-read-from-default' can be set to a
function that returns the default value of FROM when 'query-replace'
prompts for a string to be replaced.  An example of such a function is
'find-tag-default'.

The new variable 'query-replace-read-from-regexp-default' can be set
to a function (such as 'find-tag-default-as-regexp') that returns the
default value of FROM when 'query-replace-regexp' prompts for a regexp
whose matches are to be replaced.  If these variables are nil (which
is the default), 'query-replace' and 'query-replace-regexp' take the
default value from the previous FROM-TO pair.</code></pre><h3 id="lisp-pretty-printer-pp">Lisp pretty-printer (‘pp’)</h3><pre><code>New function 'pp-emacs-lisp-code'.
'pp' formats general Lisp sexps.  This function does much the same,
but applies formatting rules appropriate for Emacs Lisp code.  Note
that this could currently be quite slow, and is thus appropriate only
for relatively small code fragments.</code></pre><pre><code>New user option 'pp-use-max-width'.
If non-nil, 'pp' and all 'pp-*' commands that format the results, will
attempt to limit the line length when formatting long lists and
vectors.  This uses 'pp-emacs-lisp-code', and thus could be slow for
large lists.</code></pre><pre><code>New function 'file-has-changed-p'.
This convenience function is useful when writing code that parses
files at run-time, and allows Lisp programs to re-parse files only
when they have changed.</code></pre><pre><code>'abbreviate-file-name' now respects magic file name handlers.</code></pre><pre><code>New function 'font-has-char-p'.
This can be used to check whether a specific font has a glyph for a
character.</code></pre><pre><code>'window-text-pixel-size' now accepts a new argument IGNORE-LINE-AT-END.
This controls whether or not the last screen line of the text being
measured will be counted for the purpose of calculating the text
dimensions.</code></pre><pre><code>'window-text-pixel-size' understands a new meaning of FROM.
Specifying a cons as the FROM argument allows to start measuring text
from a specified amount of pixels above or below a position.</code></pre><pre><code>'window-body-width' and 'window-body-height' can use remapped faces.
Specifying 'remap' as the PIXELWISE argument now checks if the default
face was remapped, and if so, uses the remapped face to determine the
character width/height.</code></pre><pre><code>'set-window-vscroll' now accepts a new argument PRESERVE-VSCROLL-P.
This means the vscroll will not be reset when set on a window that is
"frozen" due to a mini-window being resized.</code></pre><h3 id="xdg-support">XDG Support</h3><pre><code>New function 'xdg-state-home'.
It returns the new 'XDG_STATE_HOME' environment variable.  It should
point to a file name that "contains state data that should persist
between (application) restarts, but that is not important or portable
enough to the user that it should be stored in $XDG_DATA_HOME".
(This variable was introduced in the XDG Base Directory Specification
version 0.8 released on May 8, 2021.)</code></pre><p>Let’s hope this is the beginning of well-behaved elisp code (incl. core Emacs!) that’ll put all their junk files there instead of in my <code>.emacs.d</code> directory.</p><pre><code>New function 'xdg-current-desktop'.
It returns a list of strings, corresponding to the colon-separated
list of names in the 'XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP' environment variable, which
identify the current desktop environment.
(This variable was introduced in XDG Desktop Entry Specification
version 1.2.)</code></pre><pre><code>New function 'xdg-session-type'.
It returns the 'XDG_SESSION_TYPE' environment variable.  (This is not
part of any official standard; see the man page pam_systemd(8) for
more information.)</code></pre><pre><code>New macro 'with-delayed-message'.
This macro is like 'progn', but will output the specified message if
the body takes longer to execute than the specified timeout.</code></pre><pre><code>New function 'funcall-with-delayed-message'.
This function is like 'funcall', but will output the specified message
if the function takes longer to execute than the specified timeout.</code></pre><h3 id="locale">Locale</h3><pre><code>New variable 'current-locale-environment'.
This holds the value of the previous call to 'set-locale-environment'.</code></pre><pre><code>New macro 'with-locale-environment'.
This macro can be used to change the locale temporarily while
executing code.</code></pre><h3 id="table">Table</h3><p>Table creates editable ASCII tables. I find it incredibly buggy.</p><pre><code>New user option 'table-latex-environment'.
This allows switching between "table" and "tabular".</code></pre><h3 id="tabulated-list-mode">Tabulated List Mode</h3><pre><code>A column can now be set to an image descriptor.
The 'tabulated-list-entries' variable now supports using an image
descriptor, which means to insert an image in that column instead of
text.  See the documentation string of that variable for details.</code></pre><pre><code>':keys' in 'menu-item' can now be a function.
If so, it is called whenever the menu is computed, and can be used to
calculate the keys dynamically.</code></pre><pre><code>New major mode 'clean-mode'.
This is a new major mode meant for debugging.  It kills absolutely all
local variables and removes overlays and text properties.</code></pre><pre><code>'kill-all-local-variables' can now kill all local variables.
If given the new optional KILL-PERMANENT argument, it also kills
permanent local variables.</code></pre><pre><code>Third 'mapconcat' argument SEPARATOR is now optional.
An explicit nil always meant the empty string, now it can be left out.</code></pre><pre><code>New function 'image-at-point-p'.
This function returns t if point is on a valid image, and nil
otherwise.</code></pre><pre><code>New function 'buffer-text-pixel-size'.
This is similar to 'window-text-pixel-size', but can be used when the
buffer isn't displayed.</code></pre><pre><code>New function 'string-pixel-width'.
This returns the width of a string in pixels.  This can be useful when
dealing with variable pitch fonts and glyphs that have widths that
aren't integer multiples of the default font.</code></pre><pre><code>New function 'string-glyph-split'.
This function splits a string into a list of strings representing
separate glyphs.  This takes into account combining characters and
grapheme clusters, by treating each sequence of characters composed on
display as a single unit.</code></pre><h3 id="xwidget-1">Xwidget</h3><pre><code>The function 'make-xwidget' now accepts an optional RELATED argument.
This argument is used as another widget for the newly created WebKit
widget to share settings and subprocesses with.  It must be another
WebKit widget.</code></pre><pre><code>New function 'xwidget-perform-lispy-event'.
This function allows you to send events to xwidgets.  Usually, some
equivalent of the event will be sent, but there is no guarantee of
what the widget will actually receive.

On GTK+, only key and function key events are implemented.</code></pre><pre><code>New function 'xwidget-webkit-load-html'.
This function is used to load HTML text into WebKit xwidgets
directly, in contrast to creating a temporary file to hold the
markup, and passing the URI of the file as an argument to
'xwidget-webkit-goto-uri'.</code></pre><pre><code>New functions for performing searches on WebKit xwidgets.
Some new functions, such as 'xwidget-webkit-search', have been added
for performing searches on WebKit xwidgets.</code></pre><pre><code>New function 'xwidget-webkit-back-forward-list'.
This function returns the history of page-loads in a WebKit xwidget.</code></pre><pre><code>New function 'xwidget-webkit-estimated-load-progress'.
This function returns the estimated progress of page loading in a
WebKit xwidget.</code></pre><pre><code>New function 'xwidget-webkit-stop-loading'.
This function terminates all data transfer during page loads in a
WebKit xwidget.</code></pre><pre><code>'load-changed' xwidget events are now more detailed.
In particular, they can now have different arguments based on the
state of the WebKit widget.  'load-finished' is sent when a load has
completed, 'load-started' when a load first starts, 'load-redirected'
after a redirect, and 'load-committed' when the WebKit widget first
commits to the load.</code></pre><pre><code>New event type 'xwidget-display-event'.
These events are sent whenever an xwidget requests that Emacs displays
another xwidget.  The only arguments to this event are the xwidget
that should be displayed, and the xwidget that asked to display it.</code></pre><pre><code>New function 'xwidget-webkit-set-cookie-storage-file'.
This function is used to control where and if an xwidget stores
cookies set by web pages on disk.</code></pre><pre><code>New variable 'help-buffer-under-preparation'.
This variable is bound to t during the preparation of a "*Help*" buffer.</code></pre><pre><code>Timestamps like '(1 . 1000)' now work without warnings being generated.
For example, '(time-add nil '(1 . 1000))' no longer warns that the
'(1 . 1000)' acts like '(1000 . 1000000)'.  This warning, which was a
temporary transition aid for Emacs 27, has served its purpose.</code></pre><pre><code>'encode-time' now also accepts a 6-element list with just time and date.
'(encode-time (list SECOND MINUTE HOUR DAY MONTH YEAR))' is now short for
'(encode-time (list SECOND MINUTE HOUR DAY MONTH YEAR nil -1 nil))'.</code></pre><pre><code>'date-to-time' now accepts arguments that lack month, day, or time.
The function now assumes the earliest possible values if its argument
lacks month, day, or time.  For example, (date-to-time "2021-12-04")
now assumes a time of "00:00" instead of signaling an error.</code></pre><pre><code>'format-seconds' now allows suppressing zero-value trailing elements.
The new "%x" non-printing control character will suppress zero-value
elements that appear after "%x".</code></pre><pre><code>New events for taking advantage of touchscreen devices.
The events 'touchscreen-begin', 'touchscreen-update', and
'touchscreen-end' have been added to take better advantage of
touch-capable display panels.</code></pre><pre><code>New error symbol 'permission-denied'.
This is a subcategory of 'file-error', and is signaled when some file
operation fails because the OS doesn't allow Emacs to access a file or
a directory.</code></pre><pre><code>Warning about "eager macro-expansion failure" is now an error.</code></pre><pre><code>Previously, the X "reverseVideo" value at startup was heeded for all frames.
This meant that if you had a "reverseVideo" resource on the initial
display, and then opened up a new frame on a display without any
explicit "reverseVideo" setting, it would get heeded there, too.  (This
included terminal frames.)  In Emacs 29, the "reverseVideo" X resource
is handled like all the other X resources, and set on a per-frame basis.</code></pre><pre><code>The ':underline' face attribute now accepts a new property.
The property ':position' now specifies the position of the underline
when used as part of a property list specification for the
':underline' attribute.</code></pre><pre><code>'defalias' records a more precise history of definitions.
This is recorded in the 'function-history' symbol property.</code></pre><pre><code>New hook 'save-place-after-find-file-hook'.
This is called at the end of 'save-place-find-file-hook'.</code></pre><pre><code>'indian-tml-base-table' no longer translates digits.
Use 'indian-tml-base-digits-table' if you want digits translation.</code></pre><pre><code>'indian-tml-itrans-v5-hash' no longer translates digits.
Use 'indian-tml-itrans-digits-v5-hash' if you want digits
translation.</code></pre><pre><code>'shell-quote-argument' has a new optional argument POSIX.
This is useful when quoting shell arguments for a remote shell
invocation.  Such shells are POSIX conformant by default.</code></pre><pre><code>'make-process' can set connection type independently for input and output.
When calling 'make-process', communication via pty can be enabled
selectively for just input or output by passing a cons cell for
':connection-type', e.g. '(pipe . pty)'.  When examining a process
later, you can determine whether a particular stream for a process
uses a pty by passing one of 'stdin', 'stdout', or 'stderr' as the
second argument to 'process-tty-name'.</code></pre><pre><code>'signal-process' now consults the list 'signal-process-functions'.
This is to determine which function has to be called in order to
deliver the signal.  This allows Tramp to send the signal to remote
asynchronous processes.  The hitherto existing implementation has been
moved to 'internal-default-signal-process'.</code></pre><pre><code>Some system information functions honor remote systems now.
'list-system-processes' returns remote process IDs.
'memory-info' returns memory information of remote systems.
'process-attributes' expects a remote process ID.
This happens only when the current buffer's 'default-directory' is
remote.  In order to preserve the old behavior, bind
'default-directory' to a local directory, like

    (let ((default-directory temporary-file-directory))
      (list-system-processes))</code></pre><pre><code>New functions 'take' and 'ntake'.
'(take N LIST)' returns the first N elements of LIST; 'ntake' does
the same but works by modifying LIST destructively.</code></pre><pre><code>'string-split' is now an alias for 'split-string'.</code></pre><pre><code>'format-spec' now accepts functions in the replacement.
The function is called only when used in the format string.  This is
useful to avoid side-effects such as prompting, when the value is not
actually being used for anything.</code></pre><pre><code>The variable 'max-specpdl-size' has been made obsolete.
Now 'max-lisp-eval-depth' alone is used for limiting Lisp recursion
and stack usage.  'max-specpdl-size' is still present as a plain
variable for compatibility but its limiting powers have been taken away.</code></pre><pre><code>New function 'external-completion-table'.
This function returns a completion table designed to ease
communication between Emacs's completion facilities and external tools
offering completion services, particularly tools whose full working
set is too big to transfer to Emacs every time a completion is
needed.  The table uses new 'external' completion style exclusively
and cannot work with regular styles such as 'basic' or 'flex'.</code></pre><pre><code>Magic file name handlers for 'make-directory-internal' are no longer needed.
Instead, Emacs uses the already-existing 'make-directory' handlers.</code></pre><pre><code>'(make-directory DIR t)' returns non-nil if DIR already exists.
This can let a caller know whether it created DIR.  Formerly,
'make-directory's return value was unspecified.

</code></pre><h3 id="changes-in-emacs-29.1-on-non-free-operating-systems">Changes in Emacs 29.1 on Non-Free Operating Systems</h3><h3 id="ms-windows">MS-Windows</h3><pre><code>Emacs now supports double-buffering on MS-Windows to reduce display flicker.
(This was supported on Free systems since Emacs 26.1.)

To disable double-buffering (e.g., if it causes display problems), set
the frame parameter 'inhibit-double-buffering' to a non-nil value.
You can do that either by adding

    '(inhibit-double-buffering . t)

to 'default-frame-alist', or by modifying the frame parameters of the
selected frame by evaluating

    (modify-frame-parameters nil '((inhibit-double-buffering . t)))</code></pre><pre><code>Emacs now supports system dark mode.
On Windows 10 (version 1809 and higher) and Windows 11, Emacs will now
follow the system's dark mode: GUI frames use the appropriate light or
dark title bar and scroll bars, based on the user's Windows-wide color
settings.</code></pre><pre><code>Emacs now uses native image APIs to display some image formats.
On Windows 2000 and later, Emacs now defaults to using the native
image APIs for displaying the BMP, GIF, JPEG, PNG, and TIFF images.
This means Emacs on MS-Windows needs no longer use external image
support libraries to display those images.  Other image types -- XPM,
SVG, and WEBP -- still need support libraries for Emacs to be able to
display them.

The use of native image APIs is controlled by the variable
'w32-use-native-image-API', whose value now defaults to t on systems
where those APIs are available.</code></pre><pre><code>Emacs now supports display of BMP images using native image APIs.
When 'w32-use-native-image-API' is non-nil, Emacs on MS-Windows now
has built-in support for displaying BMP images.</code></pre><pre><code>GUI Yes/No dialogs now include a "Cancel" button.
The "Cancel" button is in addition to "Yes" and "No", and is intended
to allow users to quit the dialog, as an equivalent of 'C-g' when Emacs
asks a yes/no question via the echo area.  This is controlled by the
new variable 'w32-yes-no-dialog-show-cancel', by default t.  Set it to
nil to get back the old behavior of showing a modal dialog with only
two buttons: "Yes" and "No".</code></pre><h3 id="cygwin">Cygwin</h3><pre><code>'process-attributes' is now implemented.</code></pre><h3 id="macos">macOS</h3><pre><code>The 'ns-popup-font-panel' command has been removed.
Use the general command 'M-x menu-set-font' instead.</code></pre>

<p>Don't let <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/09/chrome-is-getting-a-big-redesign-with-rounded-corners-material-you-colors/">Chrome's big redesign</a> distract you from the fact that Chrome's invasive new ad platform, ridiculously branded the "Privacy Sandbox," is also getting a widespread rollout in Chrome today. If you haven't been following this, this feature will track the web pages you visit and generate a list of advertising topics that it will share with web pages whenever they ask, and it's built directly into the Chrome browser. It's been in the news previously as "<a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/04/everybody-hates-floc-googles-tracking-plan-for-chrome-ads/">FLoC</a>" and then the "<a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/01/google-drops-floc-after-widespread-opposition-pivots-to-topics-api-plan/">Topics API</a>," and despite widespread opposition from just about every non-advertiser in the world, Google owns Chrome and is one of the world's biggest advertising companies, so this is being railroaded into the production builds.</p>
<p>Google seemingly knows this won't be popular. Unlike the glitzy front-page Google blog post that the redesign got, the big ad platform launch announcement is tucked away on the <a href="https://privacysandbox.com/news/privacy-sandbox-for-the-web-reaches-general-availability">privacysandbox.com</a> page. The blog post says the ad platform is hitting "general availability" today, meaning it has rolled out to most Chrome users. This has been a long time coming, with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/07/20/google-starts-the-ga-rollout-of-its-privacy-sandbox-apis-to-all-chrome-users/">the APIs</a> rolling out about a month ago and a million incremental steps in the beta and dev builds, but now the deed is finally done.</p>

<p>Users should see a pop-up when they start up Chrome soon, informing them that an "ad privacy" feature has been rolled out to them and enabled. The new pop-up has been hitting users all week. As you can see in the pop-up, all of Google's documentation about this feature feels like it was written on opposite day, with Google calling the browser-based advertising platform "a significant step on the path towards a fundamentally more private web."</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>The argument here is that someday—not now, but someday—Google promises to turn off third-party tracking cookies in Chrome, and the new ad platform, which has some limitations, is better than the free-for-all that is third-party cookies. The thing is, third-party cookies mostly only affect Chrome users. Apple and Firefox have both been blocking third-party cookies for years and won't be implementing Google's new advertising system—it's only the Chromium browsers that still allow them.
</p><p>That's actually what started this whole process: Apple dealt a giant blow to Google's core revenue stream when it blocked third-party cookies in Safari in 2020. While it was a win for privacy, Google's not following suit until it can secure its advertising business. The Federated Learning of Cohorts and now the Topics API are part of a plan to pitch an "alternative" tracking platform, and Google argues that there <em>has</em> to be a tracking alternative—you can't just not be spied on. The Electronic Frontier Foundation also argued this when it called Google's FLoC a "<a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/03/googles-floc-terrible-idea">terrible idea</a>," saying "[Google's] framing is based on a false premise that we have to choose between 'old tracking' and 'new tracking.' It’s not either-or. Instead of re-inventing the tracking wheel, we should imagine a better world without the myriad problems of targeted ads."</p>
<p>Chrome has some controls for this built into the browser now. Just go to the Chrome Settings, then "Privacy and Security," then "Ad privacy" (alternatively, paste "chrome://settings/adPrivacy" into the address bar). From there, you can click through to each of the <em>three</em> individual pages and turn off the top checkbox, and in a mere six clicks, you can presumably turn off the ad platform. If you leave it on for a while, you can check out the "Ad topics" page, where Google will show you what ads Chrome things you would like to see. This list gets sent to advertisers when you visit a page.</p>
<p>Google says it will block third-party cookies in the second half of 2024—presumably after it makes sure the "Privacy Sandbox" will allow it to keep its profits up. Did any user in the world want a user tracking and ad platform baked directly into their browser? Probably not, but this is Google, and they control Chrome, and this probably still won't make people switch to Firefox.</p>

<p data-beyondwords-marker="e1b6e16e-ec18-4eba-8b9c-e1dd39b99281">On July 30, I flew from my home in New York City to Anchorage, Alaska, to hitchhike to the Arctic Ocean.</p>



<p data-beyondwords-marker="e84e26c4-1875-43de-9592-b3d7a4476f9e">I am not mentally imbalanced. I am a reporter who covers the trucking industry. Let me provide some more context: Back in May, with my colleague John Paul Hampstead, I wrote a story about <a href="https://www.freightwaves.com/news/alaskan-trucking-fleets-promise-150k-driver-salaries-amid-drilling-boom">the controversial growth of drilling in Alaska</a> and its effect on the $800 billion trucking industry.</p>



<p data-beyondwords-marker="7d59f8a7-044f-4883-924d-fa6478125bd9">There’s a <a href="https://www.freightwaves.com/news/trucking-bloodbath-snares-fleets-large-and-small">nasty freight recession slamming U.S. trucking fleets</a>, but Alaska seems to be experiencing the opposite. Alaskan trucking executives told me <a href="https://www.freightwaves.com/news/alaskan-trucking-fleets-promise-150k-driver-salaries-amid-drilling-boom">in May</a> that they’re planning on doubling in size. They want to hire not just Alaska residents, but folks from the Lower 48.&nbsp;</p>



<p data-beyondwords-marker="5018ac1d-5ca1-4701-8ab3-cc00b1adf234">Sourdough Express, which was founded in 1898, is one of those companies looking to lavish pay raises on employees and hire more. Just this month, President Josh Norum gave his linehaul truck drivers a 25% pay bump. “[W]e are building the team for all the work the next 4 years,” he recently told me over text message.</p>



<p data-beyondwords-marker="d36063d7-3f08-4be2-935e-aff7da6e4b62">These companies particularly want more drivers to haul equipment on the <a href="https://dot.alaska.gov/highways/dalton/">Dalton Highway</a>, which ends in the North Slope oil drilling region. It’s not a job for any ol’ truck driver. I wanted to see the experience for myself — why was it that trucking in Alaska had inspired shows like “Ice Road Truckers?” Why is everyone so fascinated by driving a truck in a really cold place? And is it as dangerous as it looks on television?</p>



<figure data-beyondwords-marker="659de3d5-08a5-422f-b2c5-d368b4fce4a0"><img decoding="async" width="1056" height="816" src="https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/05/image-7.jpeg" alt="" srcset="https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/05/image-7.jpeg 1056w, https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/05/image-7-600x464.jpeg 600w, https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/05/image-7-768x593.jpeg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1056px) 100vw, 1056px"><figcaption><em>Alaska’s North Slope Borough. A whopping 11,000 people live here, which is actually more than I would have guessed. (Image: U.S. Bureau of Land Management)</em></figcaption></figure>



<p data-beyondwords-marker="54f3fab4-a504-417d-8978-bdcfc6ae50fd">Norum advised me to come before the summer was up. So, on July 30, I took the 12-ish hour trip to Anchorage. I was only four hours behind Eastern Time but incredibly thrown off. At 10 p.m. local time, or 2 a.m. Eastern, the skies were bright blue, the sun beating down.&nbsp;</p>



<p data-beyondwords-marker="34974777-de2d-4957-b2b1-fc920f9d1c63">I fell asleep regardless. That next morning, I was off to Sourdough Express’ Anchorage terminal.&nbsp;</p>



<figure data-beyondwords-marker="4f7ddc03-0644-4885-bb84-4f5874679d33"><img decoding="async" width="1600" height="1126" src="https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/05/image-1.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/05/image-1.png 1600w, https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/05/image-1-600x422.png 600w, https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/05/image-1-1200x845.png 1200w, https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/05/image-1-768x540.png 768w, https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/05/image-1-1536x1081.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px"><figcaption><em>My path. I would travel from Anchorage to Fairbanks, stay in a hotel overnight, then go from Fairbanks to Deadhorse. (Google Maps)</em></figcaption></figure>



<p data-beyondwords-marker="0f835d27-151f-43da-8f8f-b6014e680fd3">The Anchorage terminal was more hectic than I would have expected. It reminded me of other truck terminals I’ve been to <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/day-in-the-life-coca-cola-delivery-truck-driver-nyc-2018-10">in New York City</a> — plenty of day cabs and overnight cabs alike.</p>



<p data-beyondwords-marker="5f86b382-228c-4462-a5fa-4cc9ad3a68f1">Summer is actually a slower time for Alaskan trucking fleets for Sourdough. Even in the Arctic Circle, the summer is too warm to maintain the region’s famous ice roads.&nbsp;</p>



<p data-beyondwords-marker="cc086e42-c113-40f8-8c63-82f0d9983d00">Local governments <a href="https://psmag.com/environment/how-to-build-an-ice-road">create those ice roads</a> every November and December. On that hard, frozen ground, oil company workers build and live in so-called “man camps” where they work wild shifts all winter. Truck drivers service those man camps with everything from Cheetos to drilling equipment to mattresses.&nbsp;</p>



<p data-beyondwords-marker="a916c94a-9b9e-4532-a125-a43d01f6efde">The land is too soft and squishy to support oil rigs and trucks in the summer. Instead, this season is when truckers bring up everything that oil companies will need in the winter. It’s the full-time Alaskan truck drivers who stick around, hauling pipes and steel plates that will be used in a few months. I wouldn’t be experiencing the ice roads during this trip, but if I gathered my gumption perhaps I could come back in the winter.&nbsp;</p>



<p data-beyondwords-marker="335be780-b388-4e7a-a9c7-58f963ca8bfd">Then, in the winter, truck drivers from all over the U.S. come up to cash in on the lucrative, dangerous, thrilling job of being an ice road trucker. An executive at Alaska West Express, another local trucking company, told me in May that such truck drivers can make $150,000 to $170,000 a year, in addition to benefits. It’s an amazing compensation compared to the typical tractor-trailer driver, who <a href="https://www.bls.gov/ooh/transportation-and-material-moving/heavy-and-tractor-trailer-truck-drivers.htm">the federal government says earns a median annual wage of around $48,000</a>.</p>



<p data-beyondwords-marker="0a4535ed-83b4-4db4-a408-4259fe7515cb">Well, anyways, before I could enjoy the Dalton Highway, I had to get from Anchorage to Fairbanks. Kyle Monnier, a 30-year-old who was born and raised in Alaska, would be my driver for that journey.&nbsp;</p>



<p data-beyondwords-marker="c8f50c93-51cd-43f6-968b-d15f86178d46">I went to the bathroom before we left. I got used to wearing this safety vest. It provides a nice splash of color to any outfit you may be wearing.</p>

<p data-beyondwords-marker="6e98f921-9c9a-4854-8c65-a1d92cc035f3">And off we went!&nbsp;</p>



<h2 data-beyondwords-marker="10914305-8832-4fb9-8908-13198f89b3ad" id="h-july-31-anchorage-to-fairbanks-359-miles">July 31: Anchorage to Fairbanks, 359 miles</h2>



<p data-beyondwords-marker="00102818-c606-41ba-bdfa-857306894481">Monnier and I would be hauling two trailers (typical for Alaska) of building supplies from Anchorage to Fairbanks. These weren’t urgent loads. The first trailer was wood and the one behind was insulation.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<figure data-beyondwords-marker="23adf1c8-299b-4e85-93fd-eb4052288ace"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1600" height="1200" src="https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/05/image-14.jpeg" alt="" srcset="https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/05/image-14.jpeg 1600w, https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/05/image-14-600x450.jpeg 600w, https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/05/image-14-1200x900.jpeg 1200w, https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/05/image-14-768x576.jpeg 768w, https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/05/image-14-1536x1152.jpeg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px"><figcaption><em>12:51 p.m. A full view of the truck while we grabbed lunch.

<p data-beyondwords-marker="60bd817d-6b65-494c-922b-25574da0b13f">The first, unexpected thing I learned about trucking in Alaska is the difference in the state’s hours-of-service (HOS) laws. Federal laws require truck drivers to drive no more than 11 hours in a 14-hour period. They also need to take 34 hours off duty if they’ve driven up to 60 hours in a seven-day period or 70 hours in an eight-day period. (Here’s more information on HOS regulations <a href="https://www.fmcsa.dot.gov/regulations/hours-service/summary-hours-service-regulations">if for some bizarre reason you are curious</a>.)</p>



<p data-beyondwords-marker="ac8ffb7e-e320-4922-89be-2ad58ce1c9a6">HOS regulations can be a snore outside the trucking community, but <a href="https://www.freightwaves.com/news/federal-law-designed-to-make-trucking-safer-may-have-aggravated-worst-issues">they’re huge for drivers</a>. They function totally differently in Alaska. I was shocked when I got into Monnier’s cab that he had 15 hours of driving in a 20-hour window. His on-duty time was 80 hours, too.</p>



<p data-beyondwords-marker="098823af-805f-4ee8-a9e3-525ae3cb513d">Alaska has extended HOS rules in part because driving here can be so unpredictable. For example, dirt roads means equipment can get unexpectedly beat up. Because Alaska is so sparsely populated, you might be waiting a while for a mechanic if you need help.&nbsp;</p>



<p data-beyondwords-marker="68802539-e6a9-469d-a502-0aaa1c931a34">Getting out of Anchorage was quick enough, though Monnier said the traffic leaving the big city is pretty bad. Coming from New York, this didn’t look terribly congested to me.&nbsp;</p>



<figure data-beyondwords-marker="1c7229e8-5fde-49f2-aa97-ea626672cc5f"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1600" height="1200" src="https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/05/image-8.jpeg" alt="" srcset="https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/05/image-8.jpeg 1600w, https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/05/image-8-600x450.jpeg 600w, https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/05/image-8-1200x900.jpeg 1200w, https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/05/image-8-768x576.jpeg 768w, https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/05/image-8-1536x1152.jpeg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px"><figcaption><em>8:55 a.m. A definite plus of driving in Alaska is the lack of traffic and the views.&nbsp;(Photo: Rachel Premack/FreightWaves)</em> </figcaption></figure>



<figure data-beyondwords-marker="9a1d7ec4-5eec-44be-8e4a-5d7ca39cdb78"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1600" height="1200" src="https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/05/image-11.jpeg" alt="" srcset="https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/05/image-11.jpeg 1600w, https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/05/image-11-600x450.jpeg 600w, https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/05/image-11-1200x900.jpeg 1200w, https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/05/image-11-768x576.jpeg 768w, https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/05/image-11-1536x1152.jpeg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px"><figcaption><em>2:09 p.m. We’re near Denali National Park here.

<p data-beyondwords-marker="a9015f28-9591-44f8-bc34-9b165e6beb49">On days that he works, Monnier drives the six hours from Anchorage to Fairbanks, unloads, and then typically drives the six hours back to Anchorage empty. He usually stops at a gas station for a simple meal. At his usual spot, I got surprisingly good chicken nuggets and a bag of chips.</p>



<p data-beyondwords-marker="c34c6cc5-aded-4cbd-9a7f-acc642ed1536">I’ve reported for years about how truck drivers usually have to rely on packaged and processed foods. One thing I didn’t truly understand before riding along with Monnier is just how important energy drinks are for a truck driver. When you’re chugging along the road, you can’t exactly park at an artisan cafe or go through a Starbucks drive-thru. Instead, Monster energy drinks — or in my case, Celsius — become your main source of caffeine.</p>



<figure data-beyondwords-marker="b5f27da6-4ac1-4eb3-bfca-9ba861aa71bd"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1600" height="1200" src="https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/05/image-6.jpeg" alt="" srcset="https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/05/image-6.jpeg 1600w, https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/05/image-6-600x450.jpeg 600w, https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/05/image-6-1200x900.jpeg 1200w, https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/05/image-6-768x576.jpeg 768w, https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/05/image-6-1536x1152.jpeg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px"><figcaption><em>2:20 p.m. I built up the courage at last to ask Monnier if I could get a picture of him.&nbsp;(Photo: Rachel Premack/FreightWaves)</em></figcaption></figure>



<p data-beyondwords-marker="52c1476e-e562-4347-8d55-d053222d9d32">We were on the road for about seven hours, so we naturally talked for a while. Monnier’s wife and son live in the Lower 48, though she’s also from Alaska. Monnier became a truck driver shortly after graduating from high school.&nbsp;</p>



<p data-beyondwords-marker="9825b6ec-a17f-45e0-9505-1b3b8e0d42ea">After several hours chatting, Monnier played the music he normally listens to while he’s driving. He was worried I might be offended by rap music, but I am not. His music taste ended up eclectic at minimum — rap to country to electronica to “Barbie Girl.” (He has not watched the movie!) “I have listened to every song on Pandora at least 20 times,” he said.</p>



<figure data-beyondwords-marker="038ce675-9aa9-46eb-9b4c-e920a855df68"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1600" height="1200" src="https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/05/image-13.jpeg" alt="" srcset="https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/05/image-13.jpeg 1600w, https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/05/image-13-600x450.jpeg 600w, https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/05/image-13-1200x900.jpeg 1200w, https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/05/image-13-768x576.jpeg 768w, https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/05/image-13-1536x1152.jpeg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px"><figcaption><em>5:23 p.m. Unhooking and leaving Fairbanks.&nbsp;(Photo: Rachel Premack/FreightWaves)</em></figcaption></figure>



<p data-beyondwords-marker="36397495-f2c1-48d6-a188-6ea028a9ea59">All good things must come to an end, and eventually Monnier and I reached Fairbanks. He unhooked his load and bobtailed back to Anchorage; very little freight comes out of Fairbanks headed downstate. My day was finished, but his was only halfway over.</p>



<h2 data-beyondwords-marker="c9cecafc-8c92-4bcb-b5a6-b4167913f48c" id="h-aug-1-fairbanks-to-prudhoe-bay-495-miles">Aug. 1: Fairbanks to Prudhoe Bay, 495 miles</h2>



<p data-beyondwords-marker="c3abc538-0d00-4584-9a46-e865fb624ef2">I enjoyed a good night’s sleep at a Best Western Plus. The sun set at 11:02 p.m. Next on deck was the more fearsome part of the journey: Fairbanks to Prudhoe Bay on the Dalton Highway. Monnier said he had gone a few times and was open to driving on it again.</p>



<p data-beyondwords-marker="8652b804-2300-4d4a-a847-e4ab5ef8ff81">I would be riding with Richard Mustain. Monnier assured me Mustain — or Mustang, as his call sign goes — was a Dalton Highway veteran, who knew just about everything there is to know about the road.&nbsp;</p>



<p data-beyondwords-marker="2f9b0014-402e-4c06-bc2a-e11d1cd9ce15">After a good night’s sleep, I arrived before 8 the next morning at Sourdough’s Fairbanks terminal.</p>

<p data-beyondwords-marker="63d005e5-c20f-4a24-ab28-fb6e364a3a36">Mustang and I would be hauling pipes for the oil fields in Prudhoe. We would also be joined by a training driver named Mike who had never gone on the Dalton Highway before.</p>



<p data-beyondwords-marker="0b43047b-b61b-460a-88a3-49c080d5e92a">Alaskan truck drivers call it “the Dalton.” They also all know it is exactly 414 miles. Construction on the road finished in 1974. It exists only because of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System, which runs above and below ground alongside the Dalton. During the ride, I would gaze upon the pipeline as a fond friend accompanying us. In retrospect, it is incredibly odd to rely upon a pipeline as a source of mental support.</p>



<p data-beyondwords-marker="c208357b-843d-490c-a313-6523f0f1216f">The Dalton does not begin in Fairbanks. First, you have to drive exactly 73.1 miles on another road called the Elliot Highway. I lost phone service shortly into the Elliot, and did not get it again until we reached the end of the trip. At the beginning of the Dalton, you see a series of alarming signs that make clear to anyone not driving an 18-wheeler that maybe you should bugger off: “HEAVY INDUSTRIAL TRAFFIC. PROCEED WITH CAUTION.”</p>



<p data-beyondwords-marker="23755a91-35db-4ebf-a204-7b1cc37e26cd">I was comfortably in the passenger seat of Mustang’s 2024 Peterbilt and had no guilt about proceeding.</p>



<figure data-beyondwords-marker="17c904ee-234e-4226-9be1-01014f7dcc6d"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1600" height="1200" src="https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/05/image-15.jpeg" alt="" srcset="https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/05/image-15.jpeg 1600w, https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/05/image-15-600x450.jpeg 600w, https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/05/image-15-1200x900.jpeg 1200w, https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/05/image-15-768x576.jpeg 768w, https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/05/image-15-1536x1152.jpeg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px"><figcaption><em>Mustang at 10:45 a.m.</em> <em>(Photo: Rachel Premack/FreightWaves)</em></figcaption></figure>



<p data-beyondwords-marker="b39e4ec1-0c77-4534-a520-2b3ada4f7974">Truck drivers on the Dalton are dealing with steep grades in addition to heavy loads. Sourdough trucks typically haul around 110,000 pounds here – a significant bump from the typical 80,000-pound limit in the Lower 48. Oversized loads escorted by two pick-up trucks are also common here. So, when truck drivers are slowly navigating hills or curves on the road, typical passenger vehicles or motorbikes pose a safety issue.</p>



<p data-beyondwords-marker="730daa18-9f3d-4c3e-85d4-456251ccb0a8">Mustang said he typically drives around 35 mph. It’s not surprising, then, that passenger vehicles might try to skirt around him. The issue of motorcyclists and “four-wheelers” (as truck drivers call us plebeians) quickly became clear.&nbsp;</p>



<p data-beyondwords-marker="461acfc8-42d8-44b7-b424-9df28b60966e">Mustang remained calm about 6 miles into the Dalton when a pack of motorbikes passed us. Moves on the road that might send a typical driver (not me, of course) into a fit of expletives didn’t get more than a chuckle from Mustang. Whenever the odd car appeared on the horizon, he would get on his CB radio and alert Mike behind us to keep a watch out.</p>

<p data-beyondwords-marker="33699167-4b19-4a99-b174-9b0056df1c2a"><em>10:36 a.m. Respect heavy industrial traffic!</em> <em>(Photo: Rachel Premack/FreightWaves)</em></p>



<p data-beyondwords-marker="90a6e06e-1d7f-4635-b5e7-e07b240110f3">Mustang is a Missouri native, a self-described “farm boy” who quit high school and started a family as a young man. He’s been a truck driver for 30 years. In 2015, a friend of his was telling a group — all truck drivers — about his experience hauling fuel. Mustang was the only one who actually went that winter. He showed up at the Fairbanks airport with a gym bag, completely out of his element.</p>



<p data-beyondwords-marker="ea7aa368-8d04-4941-8ec1-0d57cda310dc">“It was scary to come up here,” Mustang said. “I didn’t know nobody. People I didn’t know picked me up from the airport.”</p>



<p data-beyondwords-marker="971c82f4-2660-4aab-937d-80cc558a1798">He loved it immediately. He barely took photos on his phone before he moved to Alaska; now, he has about 10,000 of them. Most of them are in the same place, just different seasons. The long grasses change colors — red, pink, beige. That makes the mountains look different week to week. And then there’s the sky. Because of the ice crystals that form in the atmosphere during the long winters, “sun dogs” appear where it looks like there are three suns in the sky. Most fantastic might be the aurora borealis, which can make it look like the sky is swirling, shooting fingers down. “It will make your insides feel funny,” Mustang said.</p>



<p data-beyondwords-marker="f71454cf-1cfb-4ae9-bb9f-19a3c2c54ed0">Mustang identifies as a “cheechako,” which is Alaskan slang for someone who just moved here and is amazed by everything. After about 10 years as a cheechako, Mustang says you become a “sourdough” — not a native-born Alaskan, but a hardened resident who isn’t, say, taking pictures of the same mountain every few days.&nbsp;</p>



<p data-beyondwords-marker="d5a4471b-aca9-4d1b-aff5-cbe0bcf94f93">“They come outside, look around and aren’t amazed by what they see,” Mustang said. “I’m not sure I’ll get to that point.”</p>



<p data-beyondwords-marker="9efaedf9-eb63-4281-8935-0d6a4bc92693">John, an Anchorage resident I met after the ride-along, mentioned to me that he views himself as Alaskan, not American. Alaska is, of course, a U.S. state, but many residents here refer to the contiguous 48 states the way Canadians might. I heard folks call the Lower 48 the “States,” “America” or simply “the lower.”</p>



<p data-beyondwords-marker="c2af19f1-595c-45ab-af8d-c1aa325d6e7b">“Once you start living in Alaska, you lose touch with ‘the lower’ — the last tornado, the last school shooting,” Mustang told me. “It’s like being in a different country when you live here.”</p>

<p data-beyondwords-marker="ed14d742-a95d-4312-b76f-2630243a7b5c"><em>11:34 a.m. Truck drivers on the Dalton typically warn each other when they’re approaching each other.&nbsp;(Photo: Rachel Premack/FreightWaves)</em></p>



<p data-beyondwords-marker="e0f61eb0-b19e-4e1e-8ce9-5a1256882a9e">The Dalton is mostly a dirt road. Mustang told me it’s normal for a trucker’s windshield to crack during the workday because rocks fling around the vehicle’s tires and hit the windshield.</p>



<p data-beyondwords-marker="3ba9e2a6-cfdb-4338-8469-04d3067bcb9a">Four-wheelers and motorcyclists aside, the Dalton is truly a trucker’s kingdom. Every few dozen mileposts, there’s a spot with a nickname, likely christened by a truck driver. At milepost 74, there’s the “Roller Coaster,” featuring ups and downs. “Finger Mountain” is at milepost 98, so named because it looks like a middle finger. (I didn’t see the resemblance.) Milepost 126 is “Oh Shit Corner,” where a sharp turn may shock Dalton truckers who don’t have Mustang on the CB radio guiding them. Milepost 132 is “Gobbler’s Knob.” We are in polite company and I will not share the origin of that name.</p>

<p data-beyondwords-marker="d14e63c0-4ab5-4a8a-813f-35974e128402">Some signs on the Dalton pointed out these charming names, but it’s otherwise just passed down from each generation of Dalton truckers. Mustang said he’s part of the third generation of truck drivers on the Dalton. The first came in the 1970s and 1980s — guys who truly roughed it and whom Mustang spoke of with reverence. He said it took three days back then to get to Prudhoe Bay; now it can be done in 14 hours. Next, there was the next generation who trained the likes of Mustang. Mustang embraces the responsibility of training the next generation. He wears a Prudhoe Bay T-shirt most days as a sort of uniform.&nbsp;</p>



<p data-beyondwords-marker="c6dc1d78-6476-4e33-b4aa-6f8e66c186bf">Most exciting to me was milepost 115, when we officially crossed into the Arctic Circle.</p>



<figure data-beyondwords-marker="7a406426-624f-48b5-b307-f31734a2556c"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1600" height="1200" src="https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/05/image-4.jpeg" alt="" srcset="https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/05/image-4.jpeg 1600w, https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/05/image-4-600x450.jpeg 600w, https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/05/image-4-1200x900.jpeg 1200w, https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/05/image-4-768x576.jpeg 768w, https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/05/image-4-1536x1152.jpeg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px"><figcaption><em>2:10 p.m. It wasn’t even that cold.

<p data-beyondwords-marker="23e2414b-df46-4676-b55e-8437581bafef">I learned that the Arctic Circle, which I previously thought meant “it’s really cold,” refers to any location on Earth where the sun is up for 24 hours at least one day a year and down for 24 hours at least one day a year.</p>



<p data-beyondwords-marker="9bd88784-69e9-4e1a-9edf-973adf3e76ed">It cannot be overstated that the Dalton, and the entire state of Alaska, is beautiful. The summer is particularly fantastic. I did not see a dark sky once the entire week I was in Alaska, which is probably why I was easily delighted during my seven days there. The weather was a perfect 60 to 70 degrees.</p>



<p data-beyondwords-marker="4a1f6025-0e33-41a9-97ff-afcb5dfda0e7">The winter, of course, is less charming. In Anchorage, where nearly half of the state lives, the sun is up for as little as 5 1/2 hours a day. <a href="https://digitalcommons.du.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1042&amp;context=geog_ms_capstone">Research on Alaska</a> suggests that depression, alcoholism and even partner abuse increase amid these dark, cold days.</p>



<p data-beyondwords-marker="6eea8c71-9f06-4d49-b8af-8fad22535721">“The light and dark messes with your insides, your mind, your body,” Mustang said, and luckily added, “but it doesn’t seem to bother me.”</p>



<p data-beyondwords-marker="fa27bc8c-4966-430c-8498-88f80df18ffe">It’s even worse in our final destination of Prudhoe Bay, where thousands work and live in the winter. The sun does not rise — at all — from late November to late January. John, the Alaskan I met later that week, told me he was an oil rig worker when he was a younger man. The big conversation during the winters in the cafeteria was whether or not you saw the sun that day.</p>



<p data-beyondwords-marker="9e57db24-6bd1-42b5-945b-7d8fa1071729">The truck cabin was getting sunnier as we discussed all this. That’s because the trees were shrinking. We were approaching the tundra.</p>



<figure data-beyondwords-marker="1002867b-1d7f-4207-8db9-1f47e5943aab"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1600" height="1201" src="https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/05/image-3.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/05/image-3.png 1600w, https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/05/image-3-600x450.png 600w, https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/05/image-3-1200x901.png 1200w, https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/05/image-3-768x576.png 768w, https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/05/image-3-1536x1153.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px"><figcaption><em>3:20 p.m. If you think this picture is nice, guess what the real view was like!</em></figcaption></figure>



<p data-beyondwords-marker="a01ac434-c044-48ce-bce2-66bb9cb14c92">We were also approaching the last place where a truck driver (or trucking journalist) could get food and use the bathroom until we hit Deadhorse, the main settlement of Prudhoe Bay. It was also frankly one of the first places since we got on the Dalton that functioned as a rest stop. The town is Coldfoot.</p>



<p data-beyondwords-marker="a986d267-20eb-444f-a21e-22669d2b733e">By the way, you may have been wondering how anyone uses the bathroom when driving in the Arctic wilderness. It’s called pulling over to “kick a tire” (read: peeing next to your truck). Creative ways to use the bathroom while trucking aren’t exclusive to Alaska, but here it can get dangerous. Mustang told me of a recent episode when he kicked a tire and came back around to his truck to find a bear standing there. He charged the bear and it mercifully ran off. I do not need to tell you here that I drank very little water the day I was on the Dalton.</p>



<p data-beyondwords-marker="2b0a94ef-988a-4eaa-9bbf-4b87e03a77d2">Exhausted and hungry, I was happy to get to Coldfoot. It’s allegedly the world’s farthest north truck stop.</p>



<p data-beyondwords-marker="7cb64c08-c0cc-47e3-8fb8-2d1845cf38ad">Mustang warned me not to get anything fried. As previously stated, opportunities for bathrooms are limited.</p>

<p data-beyondwords-marker="62d38649-5abc-4a91-ae33-ec7b7c0dddc2">Mustang went back out to his truck to check up on his and Mike’s equipment. Meanwhile, I was kind of … confused on what to do next. We were going to sit at a communal table specifically for truck drivers, but I felt a bit out of sorts. The jet lag started to kick in and I felt a bit awkward.&nbsp;</p>

<p data-beyondwords-marker="2f456d21-24ab-4a05-9c76-be6959869dd8">Anyways, I sat down and ate my burger. Then I bought some stuff from the gift shop.</p>



<p data-beyondwords-marker="0f6f57a1-77e3-4991-8258-9be134cd2919">I started to get a real appreciation then for how long a truck driver’s workday is. We started the work day nearly eight hours ago, but we still had about half the Dalton left to drive. Mustang told me that a particularly active Dalton truck driver can do three trips to Prudhoe a week, which translates to about six 14-hour days and three nights away from home. Mustang sticks to two weekly trips up to Prudhoe.&nbsp;</p>



<p data-beyondwords-marker="c79a034c-99bc-43c9-bc21-a24f5a37b379">Our workday was about to get a bit longer. Mustang and Mike, the trainee behind us, needed to get some work done on Mike’s truck. Coldfoot has a machine shop with a mechanic who can fix up minor equipment issues.</p>



<figure data-beyondwords-marker="beab4d9d-df68-4531-8a57-d3d18aac9fb6"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1600" height="1200" src="https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/05/image-1.jpeg" alt="" srcset="https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/05/image-1.jpeg 1600w, https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/05/image-1-600x450.jpeg 600w, https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/05/image-1-1200x900.jpeg 1200w, https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/05/image-1-768x576.jpeg 768w, https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/05/image-1-1536x1152.jpeg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px"><figcaption><em>4:50 p.m. This is the point in which I am slightly fading away.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p data-beyondwords-marker="878e40d5-1081-4c26-920b-586e650f40d2">Ultimately, the issue was fixed. We were back on the road a bit after 5 p.m. It was longer than anyone wanted to be held up. We still had about 5 1/2 hours before we reached Prudhoe.</p>



<p data-beyondwords-marker="c216ae15-77bb-4449-bfbf-d16213eea1ca">It’s a necessity for Dalton truck drivers to know how to do minor — or major — repairs on their vehicles. The issue on Mike’s equipment was thankfully quick and the guys were able to catch it near a mechanic’s shop, rather than on the side of the highway hours from anyone. These were brand-new Peterbilts, and the road had already given them a bit of a beating. Mustang noted to me that most trucks in Alaska have separate fuel tanks because, say, a caribou might come up and pierce one of them with its antlers. This sounded slightly ridiculous until I saw caribou later on the drive.</p>



<p data-beyondwords-marker="22b59599-c4a4-41db-acb8-d4eee636501e">At 5:52 p.m., I wrote the following in my notes: “I am tired!!!”</p>



<figure data-beyondwords-marker="e64bb6e4-f152-4f85-8524-1a0b390a1e95"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1600" height="1200" src="https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/05/image-2.jpeg" alt="" srcset="https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/05/image-2.jpeg 1600w, https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/05/image-2-600x450.jpeg 600w, https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/05/image-2-1200x900.jpeg 1200w, https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/05/image-2-768x576.jpeg 768w, https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/05/image-2-1536x1152.jpeg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px"><figcaption><em>6:46 p.m. No more trees.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p data-beyondwords-marker="7a90c456-d5bc-41c0-a2c6-cbbe197898c1">It was time for me to wake up. We were nearing milepost 248: the fearsome Atigun Pass, nearly 4,800 feet above sea level. That’s where the Continental Divide crosses with the Dalton. In the winter, avalanches often shut down the road. Robb Christenson, the director of sales and pricing at Sourdough, warned me about this one back in Anchorage.</p>



<p data-beyondwords-marker="5d0bccce-8414-4876-b029-52d917b23e4a">As we climbed the Atigun, drivers waiting to descend waited for us; this was all coordinated on the CB radio. The altitude meter clicked up and up and up.</p>



<p data-beyondwords-marker="6f35273c-8422-4210-92ae-e0a5b861652b">Mustang said the Atigun is “a piece of cake.” But you need to know how to approach it. In the Lower 48, truck drivers learn that they need to shift into a lower gear when descending a hill. However, in Alaska, Mustang said instead while going downhill you actually need to go into a <em>higher</em> gear. It’s because drivers here are hauling heavier loads. Keeping to a low gear would just push your vehicle down the mountain and you’d risk losing control. It sounds like a quick fix, but Mustang said new drivers from the Lower 48 struggle to make this adjustment. The busted guardrails on either side of the Dalton at this stretch of the drive was a grim reminder that this stretch of highway is unforgiving to mistakes.&nbsp;</p>



<p data-beyondwords-marker="70c61418-fe3e-4b81-b8e8-1d0ce23f6040">Anyways, Mustang indeed went into the 10th gear as we descended the Continental Divide. And here I am, weeks later, telling you the tale.</p>



<p data-beyondwords-marker="4c20c21e-2c32-4270-838a-3ed488fad26e">“This is the greatest trucking job in the world,” Mustang told me. “No traffic, no stoplights, just trucking. You see bears and critters and water.”</p>



<p data-beyondwords-marker="7db831be-ffc4-4630-9e01-e0bf93d3b90a">That’s great for Mustang. However, I was not doing so hot. Sitting in a passenger seat for 12 hours (without air ride!) was not ideal. For some reason, my left knee hurt. My stomach held two Celsius energy drinks, a burger, a cream-based soup and very little water. It was becoming very clear to me again why truck drivers struggle with not just food on the road, but their body literally hurting.</p>



<p data-beyondwords-marker="556a09c5-6a7e-4146-a8ee-5d50b5c27333">Combating the boredom, monotony and body aches by eating junk food seemed appropriate to me. Mustang said he once struggled with the same urges. He proudly now snacks on beef jerky and berries instead of candy bars and sips water instead of soda pop.&nbsp;</p>



<p data-beyondwords-marker="b936ecc6-a4b0-4b18-9db6-63451325cd4b">“It’s really easy to eat the wrong stuff while you’re trucking,” Mustang said. “A lot of depression goes on in trucking, because you’re away from your family. I love what I do but I’m way out of shape. Sitting in here, you don’t get no workout on your muscles.”</p>



<p data-beyondwords-marker="1f463650-268f-4795-bd10-444312a026f5">Mustang tells me we have about 2 1/2 hours left. This is the most glorious news in the world. Now that the elevation (and avalanche risk) has passed us, the pipeline has reemerged.</p>



<figure data-beyondwords-marker="f72130e7-e108-4945-9aef-6877d13a0e43"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1600" height="1198" src="https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/05/image-4.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/05/image-4.png 1600w, https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/05/image-4-600x449.png 600w, https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/05/image-4-1200x899.png 1200w, https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/05/image-4-768x575.png 768w, https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/05/image-4-1536x1150.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px"><figcaption><em>8:05 p.m. I am still in the truck. Don’t worry, my dear pipeline is on the other side of the road.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p data-beyondwords-marker="827ea345-fe13-4ad7-ac61-a64249b48025">There aren’t too many people who live out here, as you could pretty well imagine. However, Mustang does drive to them during the wintertime, when ice roads make a slew of other communities accessible by car. Truck drivers bring food and other supplies to towns in the “bush.” These are communities of mostly Alaska Natives who aren’t connected to other settlements with roads. Until recently, people in the bush fished, hunted and foraged for food. But now, as money from drilling projects floods their communities, Alaska Natives are buying more from, say, <a href="https://corporate.walmart.com/newsroom/business/20170308/northern-lights-meet-the-warm-hearted-associates-of-alaska">Walmart</a> and truck drivers are able to drive these goods to the bush towns. When there are no ice roads in warmer months, bush communities rely on planes or boats to deliver these nonperishable goods.</p>



<p data-beyondwords-marker="caf913ad-272e-40d8-99e1-4a1619a919f5">Not all of the residents of these bush communities are happy with these developments. On one hand, energy companies have flooded Alaska Native communities <a href="https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/features/pipeline-impact-pipeline-alaska-natives/">with cash and work opportunities</a>. Subsistence living is no longer the norm. However, new issues have plagued these settlements. Alaska Native communities now see outsize rates of diabetes, alcoholism and drug abuse compared to other Alaskans.&nbsp;</p>



<p data-beyondwords-marker="26eeb6d1-3608-4f0c-8cca-49e49a33f8fc">Some local leaders say these issues <a href="https://ndncollective.org/consultation-process-inadequate-new-letter-from-nuiqsut-community-leaders-to-department-of-interior/">are partially a result of oil development</a>. They’re particularly concerned about ConocoPhillips Alaska’s Willow project, which could produce up to 180,000 barrels of oil a day. President Joe Biden approved the Willow project <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/12/climate/biden-willow-arctic-drilling-restrictions.html">in March</a>. That’s good news for truck drivers and oil workers but alarming for those who say the project will be a “carbon bomb” that heightens the climate crisis. Locally, some Native Alaskans say increased drilling affects traditional rites like caribou hunting. (And that would, in turn, make them more reliant on nonperishable, processed foods from outside their communities.)</p>



<p data-beyondwords-marker="007102b0-e1b7-4e30-9d75-1041eeaedab2">Speaking of hunting, we start scanning the horizon for critters. I do spot a few caribou. We haven’t seen any bears, but they’re more scared of people than you’d think. Mustang said buffalo out here will ram your truck “until they die.” There’s another creature called <a href="https://www.adfg.alaska.gov/index.cfm?adfg=muskox.main">muskox</a>, which is native to the Arctic. Their fur is incredibly soft.</p>



<p data-beyondwords-marker="55766b8e-c14a-495b-b699-726eb2f98eb5">Before I realize it, the ride is nearly finished. I am a little sad to leave.&nbsp;</p>



<figure data-beyondwords-marker="fd5fa2a8-da33-44bc-a559-197f9f35e9dc"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1600" height="1193" src="https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/05/image.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/05/image.png 1600w, https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/05/image-600x447.png 600w, https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/05/image-1200x895.png 1200w, https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/05/image-768x573.png 768w, https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/05/image-1536x1145.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px"><figcaption><em>10:10 p.m. This is the tundra!</em></figcaption></figure>



<p data-beyondwords-marker="ba72d7fa-d902-4584-8d5a-717347012158">We are at last in the tundra. It’s not what I expected. It’s a beautiful, bright green grass dotted with wildflowers and slashed with light blue streams. Mustang tells me the fields are soaking wet. We still see some hunters nestled in the tall grasses, looking to shoot caribou. It’s unclear to me if they’re locals or came up here to hunt.</p>



<p data-beyondwords-marker="b580ef94-4a9d-467c-9caf-bddc5a11b7cd">And, once again, the landscape changes. Now it’s permafrost, which is soil that remains at or below freezing even in the summer. It’s cracked because the permafrost is no longer so permanent. Even in the Arctic Circle, temperatures are rising. Even parts of the road are starting to get hilly because the permafrost is melting and expanding.</p>



<figure data-beyondwords-marker="0970b97f-9196-4d8e-9455-d09dd2964e9a"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1600" height="1188" src="https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/05/image-5.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/05/image-5.png 1600w, https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/05/image-5-600x446.png 600w, https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/05/image-5-1200x891.png 1200w, https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/05/image-5-768x570.png 768w, https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/05/image-5-1536x1140.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px"><figcaption><em>10:24 p.m. Permafrost galore. Did I mention this is hour 14 in the truck?</em></figcaption></figure>



<p data-beyondwords-marker="06f9666a-331f-449e-a6f2-6ed647710842">And then, against all odds, we make it to Deadhorse. The oil rigs, the squat buildings, the man camps, they all appear like a mirage.</p>



<figure data-beyondwords-marker="37897395-b088-44af-8836-930680510409"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1600" height="1200" src="https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/05/image-5.jpeg" alt="" srcset="https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/05/image-5.jpeg 1600w, https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/05/image-5-600x450.jpeg 600w, https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/05/image-5-1200x900.jpeg 1200w, https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/05/image-5-768x576.jpeg 768w, https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/05/image-5-1536x1152.jpeg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px"><figcaption><em>10:31 p.m. I never thought I would be so happy to see an oil rig.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p data-beyondwords-marker="a1f03544-867e-49b2-9a4e-e11140df1ad0">I thank Mustang for an unforgettable experience. He admits it’s another workday for him. I fear I was an annoying passenger, or maybe he’s finally sick of Alaska, sick of trucking.</p>



<p data-beyondwords-marker="8cec2176-8d6e-42e1-91dc-367d104b3f27">But later, he sends me no fewer than nine videos (a mere slice of his 10,000-photo library) of musk oxen, pink grasses, caribou interrupting traffic, Northern Lights and even his truck on a barge heading out to the Arctic Ocean.</p>



<p data-beyondwords-marker="75722911-9a9b-4131-b72b-af5ec6a507db">“All of these videos pretty much explain why I love this job so much,” Mustang writes in his text message. He is a “cheechako” yet.&nbsp;</p>



<p data-beyondwords-marker="ea845d25-9400-49ab-894a-75fda75862b1"><em>Thank you to Richard Mustain, Kyle Monnier, Josh Norum and everyone else at Sourdough Express I met for taking the time to show me around Alaska.

<p>In a new report, the federal department charged with analyzing how efficiently US taxpayer dollars are spent, the Government Accountability Office, says NASA lacks transparency on the true costs of its Space Launch System rocket program.</p>
<p>Published on Thursday, the new report (<a href="https://www.gao.gov/assets/gao-23-105609.pdf">see .pdf</a>) examines the billions of dollars spent by NASA on the development of the massive rocket, which made a successful debut launch in late 2022 with the Artemis I mission. Surprisingly, as part of the reporting process, NASA officials admitted the rocket was too expensive to support its lunar exploration efforts as part of the Artemis program.</p>
<p>"Senior NASA officials told GAO that at current cost levels, the SLS program is unaffordable," the new report states.</p>
<h2>Poor tools to understand true costs</h2>
<p>The Government Accountability Office expressed serious concerns about NASA's decision not to measure production costs of SLS rocket elements, including the core stages and rocket engines needed for future launches. Instead, NASA told the report authors that it plans to "monitor production costs and affordability of the SLS program via the five-year production and operations cost estimate."</p>
<p>However, the report states, these are "poor tools" for a cost baseline for the SLS rocket program and will make it difficult for taxpayers to measure costs and the performance of NASA and its contractors over time. Moreover, the report indicates that NASA has not regularly updated its five-year production cost estimates for the rocket. The report also cites concerns about development costs of future hardware for NASA's big-ticket rocket program, including the Exploration Upper Stage.</p>
<p>Another problem with NASA's cost estimates is that they do not appear to account for delays to Artemis missions. It is probable that the Artemis II mission, a crewed flight around the Moon, will launch no earlier than 2025. The Artemis III crewed landing will likely slip to at least 2026, if not more, with additional delays down the line. At least one NASA official apparently told the Government Accountability Office that these delays would have no cost impacts, which seems highly improbable.</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>"Some NASA officials told us that changes to Artemis mission dates should not affect the SLS program’s cost estimate," the report states. "Other officials noted that the program’s cost estimate would be expected to increase to account for the delay to the Artemis IV mission, which shifted from 2026 to 2028."</p>
<h2>How to pare back unsustainable costs</h2>
<p>NASA officials interviewed by the Government Accountability Office acknowledged that they were concerned about the costs of the SLS rocket.</p>
<p>"NASA recognizes the need to improve the affordability of the SLS program and is taking steps to do so," the report states. "Senior agency officials have told us that at current cost levels the SLS program is unsustainable and exceeds what NASA officials believe will be available for its Artemis missions."</p>
<p>Officials from the space agency said they had a four-step plan to reduce costs of the SLS rocket program over time:</p>
<ul>
<li>Stabilize the flight schedule</li>
<li>Achieve learning curve efficiencies</li>
<li>Encourage innovation</li>
<li>Adjust acquisition strategies to reduce cost risk</li>
</ul>
<p>Setting aside that some of these goals sound suspiciously like corporate speak, the report makes clear that these are aspirational aims for now. "NASA, however, has not yet identified specific program-level cost-saving goals which it hopes to achieve," the authors write. "NASA has made some progress toward implementing these strategies, but it is too early to fully evaluate their effect on cost."</p>
<h2>Can NASA really control costs?</h2>
<p>While NASA certainly deserves credit for talking about the excessive cost of the SLS rocket—a fact that has been pointed out by critics for more than a decade but largely ignored by NASA officials and congressional leaders—it is not at all clear that they will be able to control costs. For example, NASA recently said that it is working with the primary contractor of the SLS rocket's main engines, Aerojet, to reduce the cost of each engine by 30 percent, down to $70.5 million by the end of this decade.</p>
<p>However, NASA's inspector general, Paul Martin, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2023/05/a-new-report-finds-nasa-has-spent-an-obscene-amount-of-money-on-sls-propulsion/">said this claim was dubious</a>. According to Martin, when calculating the projected cost savings of the new RS-25 engines, NASA and Aerojet only included material, engineering support, and touch labor, while project management and overhead costs are excluded.</p>
<p>And even at $70.5 million, these engines are very, very far from being affordable compared to the existing US commercial market for powerful rocket engines. Blue Origin manufactures an engine of comparable power and size, the BE-4, for less than $20 million. And SpaceX is seeking to push the similarly powerful Raptor rocket engine costs even lower, to less than $1 million per engine.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.adept.ai/blog/persimmon-8b">https://www.adept.ai/blog/persimmon-8b</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37422615">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
  <p>We’re excited to open-source Persimmon-8B, the best fully permissively-licensed model in the 8B class.
The code and weights are <a href="https://github.com/persimmon-ai-labs/adept-inference">here</a>.</p>
<p>At Adept, we’re working towards an AI agent that can help people do anything they need to do on a computer. We’re not in the business of shipping isolated language models (LMs)—this was an early output of the model scaling program that will support our products.</p>
<p>Over the last year, we’ve been amazed by how smart small models are becoming, and we wanted to give the community access to an even better 8B LM to build on for any use case, with an open Apache license and publicly accessible weights. The 8B size is a sweet spot for most users without access to large-scale compute—they can be finetuned on a single GPU, run at a decent speed on modern MacBooks, and may even fit on mobile devices.</p>
<p>Persimmon-8B has several nice properties:</p>
<ol>
<li>This is the most capable open-source, fully permissive model with fewer than 10 billion parameters. We are releasing it under an Apache license for maximum flexibility.</li>
<li>We trained it from scratch using a context size of 16K. Many LM use cases are context-bound; our model has 4 times the context size of LLaMA2 and 8 times that of GPT-3, MPT, etc.</li>
<li>Our base model exceeds other ~8B models and matches LLaMA2 performance despite having been trained on only 0.37x as much data as LLaMA2.</li>
<li>The model has 70k unused embeddings for multimodal extensions, and has sparse activations.</li>
<li>The inference code we’re releasing along with the model is unique—it combines the speed of C++ implementations (e.g. FasterTransformer) with the flexibility of naive Python inference.</li>
</ol>
<p>We’re excited to see how the community takes advantage of these capabilities not present in other open source language models, and we hope this model spurs even greater innovation!</p>
<p><strong>Because this is a raw model release, we have not added further finetuning, postprocessing or sampling strategies to control for toxic outputs.</strong></p>
<h2 id="a-more-realistic-way-of-doing-evals">A more realistic way of doing evals</h2>
<p>Determining the quality of a language model is still as much art as science. Model quality is not an absolute metric and depends on how the language model will be used. In most use cases, we expect language models to generate text. However, a common methodology for evaluating language models doesn’t actually ask them to generate any text at all. Consider the following multiple choice question from the common HellaSwag eval set. The goal is to pick which of the four answers best continues the “question.”</p>
<p><em>A woman is outside with a bucket and a dog. The dog is running around trying to avoid a bath. She…</em></p>
<p><em>a) rinses the bucket off with soap and blow dries the dog’s head.<br>
b) uses a hose to keep it from getting soapy.<br>
c) gets the dog wet, then it runs away again.<br>
d) gets into a bathtub with the dog.</em></p>
<p>One way to evaluate the model is to simply ask it to answer the question and then see which choice it makes – (a), (b), (c), or (d).  This mimics the experience of how people actually interact with language models – they ask questions and expect answers. This is analogous to e.g. <a href="https://crfm.stanford.edu/helm/latest/">HELM</a>.</p>
<p>A more common practice in ML is instead to use the implicit probabilities that the language model assigns to each choice. For option (a) above, we calculate the probability of “rinses” given the previous sentences, and then probability of “the” given the previous sentences plus “rinses,“ and so on. We then multiply all these probabilities together, giving the probability of the entire sequence for option (a). We do this for all four choices (optionally adding length normalization to account for different length sequences) and select the option with the highest sequence probability. This is a fine way to measure the intrinsic knowledge of a language model, but a poor way to understand what actually interacting with it is like.</p>
<p>Since we care about interacting with language models, we do all of our evals with the former technique–we directly generate answers from the model. We’re releasing the prompts we use so that others can reproduce these numbers.</p>
<h2 id="results">Results</h2>
<p>We compared Persimmon-8B to the current most powerful model in its size range—<a href="https://ai.meta.com/llama/">LLama 2</a>—and to <a href="https://www.mosaicml.com/blog/mpt-7b">MPT 7B Instruct</a>.
Our instruction-fine-tuned model—Persimmon-8B-FT—is the strongest performing model on all but one of the metrics.
Our base model—Persimmon-8B-Base—performs comparably to Llama 2, despite having seen only 37% as much training data.</p>

<h2 id="model-details">Model Details</h2>
<p>Persimmon-8B is a standard decoder-only transformer with several architecture modifications.</p>
<p>We use the squared ReLU activation function<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-activationnote" id="user-content-fnref-activationnote" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label">2</a></sup>. We use rotary positional encodings – our internal experiments found it superior to Alibi. We add layernorm to the Q and K embeddings before they enter the attention calculation.</p>
<p>The checkpoint we are releasing has approximately 9.3B parameters. In order to make pipelining during training more efficient, we chose to decouple the input and output embeddings. Doing this does not increase the capacity of the model–it is purely a systems optimization to avoid all-reducing the gradients for the (very large) embeddings across potentially slow communication links. In terms of inference cost, the model is equivalent to an 8B parameter model with coupled input/output embeddings.</p>
<p>Furthermore, in a space-constrained environment, the 70k unused embeddings (corresponding to reserved tokens) could be removed from the input/output embedding matrices.
This would reduce the model size by approximately 570M parameters.</p>
<p>We train the model from start to finish with a sequence length of 16K on 737B tokens uniformly sampled from a much larger dataset, which is a mix of text (~75%) and code (~25%).</p>
<p>Natively training on such long sequences throughout training is made possible by our development of an improved version of <a href="https://www.adept.ai/blog/flashier-attention">FlashAttention</a>, (<a href="https://github.com/Dao-AILab/flash-attention">Github</a>). We also modified the base for rotary calculations to allow for full position resolution at this longer length. This contrasts with all other open source models, which use a sequence length of at most 4096 for the majority of training. We use a vocabulary of 262k tokens, built using a unigram sentencepiece model.</p>
<p>We’ve included a table with important model information below:</p>

<h2 id="flexible-and-fast-inference">Flexible and Fast Inference</h2>
<p>We’re also releasing fast inference code for this model–with a short prompt, we can sample ~56 tokens per second on one 80GB A100 GPU<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-embeddingnote" id="user-content-fnref-embeddingnote" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label">3</a></sup>. While most optimized inference code is complicated and brittle, we’ve managed to make ours flexible without sacrificing speed. We can define models in PyTorch, run inference with minimal changes, and still be faster than FasterTransformer.</p>
<p>There are two main things that slow down traditional inference implementations:</p>
<ol>
<li>First, both the Python runtime and CUDA kernel dispatch incur per-operation overheads.</li>
<li>Second, failing to fuse operations means we spend time writing to memory and then reading back again the same values; while this overhead might go unnoticed during training (which is compute bound), inference is usually bottlenecked by memory bandwidth.</li>
</ol>
<p>The standard practice for achieving fast inference is to rewrite the entire model inference loop in C++, as in FasterTransformer, and call out to special fused kernels in CUDA. But this means that any changes to the model require painfully reimplementing every feature twice: once in Python / PyTorch in the training code and again in C++ in the inference codebase.  We found this process too cumbersome and error prone to iterate quickly on the model.</p>
<p>We wanted a strategy that would fix both of these slowdowns without maintaining a separate C++ codebase.</p>
<ol>
<li>To handle operator fusion, we’ve extracted one of the attention kernels<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-kernelname" id="user-content-fnref-kernelname" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label">4</a></sup> from <a href="https://github.com/NVIDIA/FasterTransformer">NVIDIA’s FasterTransformer repo</a>. During Python inference, we simply replace the attention operation with a call to this kernel. Because our architecture modifications don’t touch the core attention operation, this highly complex kernel can remain unmodified.</li>
<li>To handle the per-operator overheads, we use <a href="https://pytorch.org/blog/accelerating-pytorch-with-cuda-graphs/">CUDA graphs</a> to capture and replay the forward pass. We’ve also implemented this in a way that works with tensor parallelism, which lets us easily use multiple GPUs for inference.</li>
</ol>
<p>This strategy gives us the best of worlds—we can write model code in only one place while still doing inference faster than FasterTransformer. We really hope this accelerates the exciting applications that folks in the community can build.</p>
<p>This is just the first small release in a series of things we’re excited to put out this fall and winter. Enjoy!</p>

That ISP is very well known as the only one that started to advertise a 25 Gbit/s connection available for private customers a few years ago; however, it takes time for them to upgrade equipment on POPs and, in my particular case, they actually needed to open a POP nearby (In that case they have some sharing agreement with another ISP and capacity, as well as other features, are limited — it is still FTTH and not a GPON, but speed is limited to 1 Gbps for home user). But in 2023, they've announced that soon there will be a POP close by, and they'll move all users to their main product (fiber7), and as that will be a new POP, 25 Gbps will be available immediately.</p><figure><figcaption>Have I mentioned that photography is my hobby?</figcaption></figure><p id="761e">I work as an SRE at Google Switzerland and have some Networking experience. Still, I only have a little hands-on experience besides relatively dull things at home, so I've decided that this is the chance for me to get some, even though 25Gbps at home is absolute overkill. Here, I'll describe my journey and thought process with that project. There will be at least one cat in this series of posts, some photos I took (including photos of hardware), and, of course, the story.</p><h2 id="327c">Planning</h2><h2 id="ef9b">Learning from other people's experience</h2><p id="9fd4">After some searching, I found a series of blog posts by Michael Stapelberg about his <a href="https://michael.stapelberg.ch/posts/2021-07-10-linux-25gbit-internet-router-pc-build/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">router from a PC</a> and <a href="https://michael.stapelberg.ch/posts/2021-05-28-configured-and-returned-mikrotik-ccr2004-for-fiber7/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">his experience with the Mikrotik CCR200</a>4 25 Gbit/s router. However, the last one doesn't include any performance test to show how it works with 25 Gbps networks. However, on Mikrotik forums, people write all kinds of posts, including those <a href="https://forum.mikrotik.com/viewtopic.php?t=191459" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">about performance</a>; let me quote some information from the thread:</p><blockquote><p id="4509">When I first got my 2004’s, routing performance seemed limited to 2–3Gbps, a far cry from the potential 20–40Gbps mentioned on the website</p></blockquote><p id="dd0e">But that was at first, the same user also wrote:</p><blockquote><p id="e5ef">At around 19Gbps both 2004’s hit over the 90% mark, regardless of UDP or TCP traffic. Using the built-in speed tests on the 2116’s, the TCP tests ranged from 4Gbps one-way to 8.8Gbps, with a very rare 9.2Gbps on occasion. There were zero firewall rules, queues, or anything else in all four routers, simply IP addresses and a couple of static routes.</p></blockquote><p id="ccfb">That sounds good, right? 19 Gbps is okay; maybe I don't need to bother building my own router, right? I can leave with the problems that Michael described.</p><p id="97f8">But wait…</p><blockquote><p id="23db">On 7.6 and 7.7beta9, my throughput tests were much lower, like 6–7Gbps instead of 8–9Gbps per port. So while 7.7 claims to have fixed support for the various SFP+ rates, there’s a performance hit somewhere else.</p></blockquote><p id="d6aa">And another user says on the same thread:</p><blockquote><p id="2ef7">Locally I get max 7 Gbps, and against the init7 iperf3 server (25G connection!), about 5.5 Gbps.</p></blockquote><p id="5265">And that is a router that costs 500 CHF in Switzerland (~570$ as of the time of writing). People over the internet are discussing other options, and the conclusion is that if you want to have reliable 20+ Gbps, you need to go for CCR2216, which has an MSRP of 2795$ and, not surprisingly, in Switzerland, that would be around 2420 CHF (2760$). While specs are impressive (16-core ARM CPU with 2 GHz single-core clocks, for example), the price is not very convincing.</p><p id="6613">And so I've decided to build my own router.</p><h2 id="91e8">Gathering requirements</h2><p id="bea8">Thinking about what I want my router to do is an essential first step, as I can see what I need to buy. After a bit of thinking, here is the list I've gathered:</p><ol><li id="865f">It should be able to route ≥ 20 Gbps</li><li id="8fd5">It should have at least 1 SFP28 for input and at least 2 SFP28 for output, but ideally, that should be 1 SFP28 in and 4 SFP28 out (a total of 5 in an ideal case)</li><li id="3e89">I should be able to have one port that has decent 10 Gbps performance, SFP+ or RJ45 — it doesn't matter that much.</li><li id="f513">It should be quiet as it will be in a living room (the place where I have fibre coming out of my wall)</li><li id="29d5">Ideally, it should have low power consumption.</li><li id="f797">Ideally, I should be able to reuse leftover hardware I have.</li></ol><p id="7e8a">In terms of leftover hardware, since the last PC upgrade, I have an entire Ryzen 3000 system without a case and disks sitting on a shelf (Ryzen 3900X, 32 GB of RAM, MSI X570 Ace as the motherboard and relatively old AIO water cooler, I also have a bunch of old graphics cards around).</p><h2 id="7c5d">Choosing network cards</h2><figure><figcaption>SFP+ RJ45, SFP28 with fibre attached.</figcaption></figure><h2 id="8448">A few words about PCIe</h2><p id="871f">As we are talking about bandwidth — let's do some math to check what we'll need in terms of PCIe bandwidth.</p><p id="b74f">If you want to know more about PCIe (and in simple words), I recommend a video by <a href="https://gynvael.coldwind.pl/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">Gynvael Coldwind</a> called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE0fnGbI8B8" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">PCI Express To Hell</a>. But the vital thing to remember is that PCIe bandwidth for each lane is limited by a version that both the motherboard and the device support. Then, you can safely multiply single-lane bandwidth by the number of lanes the device or slot provides (the lowest number of those two). As price matters, I won't consider very new cards, so we can forget about PCIe 5.0 here (also, only Ryzen 7000 and Core 12th gen or newer might have support for that). Most of the network cards I'll consider will be relatively old, so the prime candidate here is PCIe 3.0, but there is a chance that I'll get something a bit newer — so I need to keep in mind the specs of PCIe 4.0.</p><p id="4d2d">For PCIe 3.0, single lane bandwidth is 8 GT/s (you can roughly think that it is 8 Gbps per lane, but there is overhead, so, in reality, it is a bit smaller, closer to 7.5 Gbps), and for PCIe 4.0 — that is 16 GT/s (the overhead is still there, so I will approximate that by 15 Gbps per lane).</p><p id="3b4a">Another thing to keep in mind is that desktop motherboards and CPUs support roughly 20–24 PCIe lanes in total, so it is even theoretically impossible to get more than ~360 Gbps. But there is a caveat — the slot can be (I'm talking here only about bandwidth, not physical parameters) x16, x8, x4, x2 or x1. And in reality, x2 is extremely rare. So even if the card can't consume all 8 lanes, it will still cost us all 8 if inserted into a slot that works in x8 mode.</p><p id="6ef8">A single 25 Gbps network port will need about 3.34 PCIe 3.0 lanes (rounding that up to 4), and in the case of PCIe 4.0 — half of that (rounding that up to 2). So, in the case of PCIe 3.0, it is possible to have 2 cards in x8 slots with 2x 25 Gbps ports (SFP28) or 1 card with 4 ports in x16 slot. With PCIe 4.0 (if I find an inexpensive PCIe 4.0 card with these parameters), it is theoretically possible to have 8 ports in an x16 PCIe 4.0 slot or 2x 4 port cards in x8 slots. There are 2xQSFP28 cards for PCIe 4.0; however, you will likely be limited to 4xSFP28 port cards at best.</p><p id="59ac">For cards, it is essential to verify what they can do. Some cards support both x8 PCIe 4.0 and x16 PCIe 3.0, but that is relatively rare, and newer cards (newer in this case = more expensive).</p><h2 id="aa8f">About network cards</h2><p id="b826">After some research, here is what I found online (note: I was searching for a decent quality used hardware here as well, but I would mention it only when the price difference is more than 2x compared to the price of the new — that would allow me to buy even extra pairs of spare cards in case it will stop working and still save a lot of money) and here is the list (I'll be providing both prices in CHF and USD for simplicity):</p><ol><li id="76a8">Broadcom P425G — You don't see it that often as Used on eBay, but there are some, like <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/276011814562" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">this one</a> for 195$ + 29.33$ shipping costs + duties(241.60 USD total = 213.63 CHF total, excl. duties)<br>The card has 4 SFP28 ports, supports either PCIe 4.0 x8 or PCIe 3.0 x16 (same card), passive cooling, about 19W total power consumption, and supports fancy stuff like RoCE, NVMe-oF offloading. It is, however, designed for classic enterprise with some settings available only in the network card's BIOS (which you need to enter during the boot process).</li><li id="33d9">Intel XXV710–<a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/394849367635" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">99.99$ + 32.46$</a> shipping + duties (142.65$ total = 126.07 CHF).<br>It has 2 SFP28 ports, PCIe 3.0 x8, and passive cooling. 14.1W power consumption, almost no offloads, and people saying that firmware on those cards is funky and you might need to juggle it to make it work properly (e.g. card might hang if ports are added to a bridge with other cards).</li><li id="28ed">Intel E810–339.26 CHF (incl. VAT) = 384.04$ <a href="https://www.distrelec.ch/en/network-adapter-25gbps-2x-sfp28-pcie-pci-x16-intel-e810xxvda2/p/30368307" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">NEW on Distrelec</a> (there are offers on eBay, but the price difference is insignificant). It is a bit newer than XXV710 and has more offloads (RoCE v2, NVMe-oF and stuff), but power consumption is reported to be 16–20W (so a bit up compared to XXV710), but people complain about the same problems as with XXV710 — problems finding correct firmware.</li><li id="829d">Mellanox ConnectX-4 LX. The cheapest I could find was on eBay, costing 49.48 GBP (62.7 USD = 55.18 CHF). It is advertised as "brand new, made in China", but I am unsure how true that is.<br>The card has 2 SFP28 ports, PCIe 3.0 x8, and passive cooling. Power consumption is tricky as different sources tell different stories, somewhere between 7.8 and 11.1 W.<br>It has some essential offloading support, nothing fancy, though.</li><li id="4d7f">Mellanox ConnectX-5. The cheapest one I've found <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/144739330341" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">was 158$ </a>(=139.88 CHF). That version also has 2xSFP28, and the main difference between this one and ConnectX-4 is support for more offloading, including Open V-Switch. It seems overkill for home use.</li><li id="6dbe">Mellanox ConnectX-5 MCX516A-CCAT. That one has 2xQSFP28, which means a potential total bandwidth of 200 Gbps. Its price <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/305065565271" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">is 269.99$ + 30.05$ shipping + duties</a> (333.63$ total = 295.36 CHF). There are caveats there…<br>First — it is PCIe 3.0 x16, so the total available bandwidth (on the bus) is about 126 Gbps, slightly less than 200. However, some <a href="https://forums.servethehome.com/index.php?threads%2Fmellanox-flashing-connectx-5-to-connectx-5-ex-pcie-3-0-to-pcie-4-0.34865%2F=" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">forum threads</a> mention that it is possible to force-flash it into MCX516A-CDAT, which gives it PCIe 4.0 support, as it seems to use the same chip and the identical PCB. It is unknown and not guaranteed to work or be stable after that.<br>Second — it is QSFP28. You must use breakout cables unless you want 100 Gbps (over aggregated 4xSFP28). That means it will be a DAC (direct-attached copper) cable or fibre (either with an SFP28 end or just plain fibre). Usually, those cables are designed so that all 4 of your destination devices are in the same place (and in case it is a breakout to SFP28 — you'll have 4 identical SFP28 ends, which limits its compatibility as no SFP+ for you).</li><li id="71a7">Netronome Agilio CX 2x25 GbE. That one costs about<a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/185570704496" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank"> 118$ + 27.21$ shipping + duties</a> (156.39$ = 138.42 CHF). It has 2xSFP28 and supports quite a lot of offloads, and what makes it interesting is that it has an SDK that allows you to do eBPF offloading or write processing in P4.</li></ol><p id="f73f">Ultimately, I decided to go for a mix of ConnectX 4-LX and Netronome because the ability to play with P4 sounded so cool that I thought it would be fun to play with it. I bought 6 Mellanoxes (2 into router, 1 into PC, 1 to Thunderbolt -&gt; PCIe for laptop and 2 spares) and 2 Netronomes.</p><h2 id="8c63">Note about ConnectX</h2><p id="07fa">I bought mine from several different sellers (including one I've mentioned here; two others were a bit more expensive) and got a mix of "Made in China" and "Made in Israel" cards as well, and they came with different firmware. One that was "Made in China" came with ancient but original firmware (it seems to be from 2018, around its manufacturing date from the sticker), but one of them was OEM Mellanox for Huawei. The difference is that with the original one, you download mlxup from the Nvidia site, and if you have internet, it updates firmware (also, beware: <strong>firmware from 2018 didn't work in all motherboards I've tried </strong>— e.x. Desktop with X670E didn't recognise the card until I updated it; I suspect that in 2018, they didn't come with UEFI-native firmware by default as the UEFI version was empty), but that doesn't work with Huawei — product ID was different. There is a trick to force-flash it with original firmware, described in two posts on the <a href="https://forums.servethehome.com/index.php?threads%2Flenovo-connectx-4-card-flash-to-mellanox.32434%2F=#post-369048" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">servethehome thread</a>.</p><p id="a6a6">TLDR: I assume you have something debian-like and downloaded new firmware from the website.

I've tried 3 different connectors — fs.com's, ubiquity's and MikroTik's (v2) — The last one didn't want to work in Mellanox card — it just doesn't power up at all without any debug messages (even in debug mode in drivers) or anything. Ubiquity's one worked well, but it is detected as 10G Ethernet, transceiver type: multimode, 50um, Shortwave laser(!) with a wavelength of 850nm(!!) which have 100m(max) length copper cable(!!!). And while that seems to work fine with Mellanox, I can quickly get that it won't start in other cards or devices. Output for such a connector (if you are interested) looks like this:</p><pre><span id="33f5"># ethtool -m enp16s0f1np1<br> Identifier                                : 0x03 (SFP)<br> Extended identifier                       : 0x04 (GBIC/SFP defined by 2-wire interface ID)<br> Connector                                 : 0x22 (RJ45)<br> Transceiver codes                         : 0x10 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x20 0x40 0x04 0x80 0x00<br> Transceiver type                          : 10G Ethernet: 10G Base-SR<br> Transceiver type                          : FC: intermediate distance (I)<br> Transceiver type                          : FC: Shortwave laser w/o OFC (SN)<br> Transceiver type                          : FC: Multimode, 50um (M5)<br> Transceiver type                          : FC: 1200 MBytes/sec<br> Encoding                                  : 0x06 (64B/66B)<br> BR, Nominal                               : 10300MBd<br> Rate identifier                           : 0x00 (unspecified)<br> Length (SMF,km)                           : 0km<br> Length (SMF)                              : 0m<br> Length (50um)                             : 0m<br> Length (62.5um)                           : 0m<br> Length (Copper)                           : 100m<br> Length (OM3)                              : 0m<br> Laser wavelength                          : 850nm<br> Vendor name                               : Ubiquiti Inc.<br> Vendor OUI                                : 24:5a:4c<br> Vendor PN                                 : UACC-CM-RJ45-MG<br> Vendor rev                                : U07<br> Option values                             : 0x00 0x00<br> BR margin, max                            : 0%<br> BR margin, min                            : 0%<br> Vendor SN                                 : AK22117511563<br> Date code                                 : 221119</span></pre><p id="615c">And the second thing — is power consumption. For some reason, ethtool doesn't report the temperature of SFP+ RJ45. Still, they are known to dissipate roughly 2–3W of power, which is quite a lot for a connector and without active cooling of your card, it will likely overheat under certain conditions.</p><p id="430c">Other than that, I bought a few SFP28 single-mode fibre modules from fs.com, and they are working fine, as well as SFP28 DACs. However, if you want to support European manufacturers — you might want to consider buying from Flexoptix. Remember that you need to check wavelength for both rx and tx. Whatever is needed on the receiving side will be specified by your ISP; however, for connecting different devices, you will need to swap RX and TX wavelength on the other end. For, you went for TX 1331 and RX 1271 nm on the router, then on NAS, you will need to have TX 1271 and RX 1331 modules. Websites usually will advise you on what to get.</p><h2 id="7279">Singlemode vs multimode vs DAC</h2><p id="85d8">The maximum length of DAC cables is only about 10 meters (33 feet), and as I needed fibre across my apartment, I went for DAC only for connection between Router and NAS as there is no reason to move them away from each other.</p><p id="2b0a">I went for single-mode everywhere for the sole reason of unification, as I already have single-mode fibre as input. Also, in that case, I can change the cables or modules in case of any failures. Single-mode cables are cheaper, but SFP modules are a bit more expensive; single-mode cable is thinner (one cable, while multimode is usually 2 cables attached).</p><h2 id="96d4">Cable types</h2><p id="9cb7">For multimode cables, you will have different OM specs (OM3, OM4, etc.). Speed and distance will depend on what you will get. OM3 is usually used for 10G for up to 300 meters; it can work for 25Gbps or 40Gbps, but distance will be significantly reduced (to 70–100 meters). In many places, it is mentioned that SFP28 is usually combined with OM4 cables. I haven't tried it, though, as I went for single-mode cables.</p><p id="ff41">For single-mode cables, I went for BiDi SFPs (I am not even sure if you can find non-BiDi SFP28 ones) and simplex cables. Connector type is essential; when connecting 2 devices, you want to get LC UPC / LC UPC ones.</p><p id="bbf1">Remember that cutting fibre and adding a new connector is more complex. You will need a Kevlar Cutter to cut fibre, an Optical Stripper to cut out extra stuff from the cable, a Cleaver to align it and pre-polished field assembly connectors to put back on. You can mend the cable, but a device wielding fibre costs about 2,000.</p><p id="2f25">Here, I refer to <a href="https://michael.stapelberg.ch/posts/2020-08-09-fiber-link-home-network/#hardware-selection" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">Michael Stapelbrg's blog post</a> written in 2020 about his choice of equipment and instructions on how to use it.</p><h2 id="d868">Other hardware and final configuration</h2><p id="a932">I've replaced my AIO water cooling with a simple air cooler. I went for Be Quiet! Pure Rock Slim 2 claims to be enough to handle up to 135W TDP CPUs, which should be more than enough for my use case.</p><p id="56e5">As for the chassis, I initially thought about Corsair 4000D, copying Michael's decision, but after some experiments, I've decided to go with Fractal North Mesh instead. There were a few reasons behind that:</p><ol><li id="a4fa">Fractal North have more fans installed out of the box.</li><li id="7639">Fractal's chassis is a bit bigger, and its mesh version has a fan mount that can blow directly over PCIe cards.</li><li id="6bd6">Ergonomically, Fractal seems to be a bit better — SSD mount is easier to access, it has more space for proper cable management and a few more small benefits over 4000D.</li></ol><p id="8329">One thing you should be aware about Fractal North — while it is a rather big case that can handle a large CPU cooler, it would interfere with the extra fan mounting plate, and something like Noctua D-15 will block you from having additional fans blowing onto your PCIe cards.</p><p id="7ca2">For a PSU, I went with Be Quiet!

An example of such a motherboard is the AsRock B550 Taichi.</p><p id="9dcd">I would swap a CPU for either Ryzen 5700X or Ryzen Pro 5750G. Though a bit questionable, What is better as Ryzen 5xxx with integrated graphics is limited to PCIe 3.0. If I need more ports available for me, I'd need to go for P425, which would require PCIe 4.0 x8 or PCIe 3.0 x16, but Ryzen doesn't have enough PCIe lanes to support x16 + x8, and I'll be limited to x16+x4 and then 5700X would be better as I'll get x8 + x8 PCIe 4.0.</p><p id="7379">I would also go for 3200 MHz ECC DDR4 memory instead of a typical desktop one, and I won't need more than 16GB total (even if that is more than I need).</p><p id="80ff">Taichi, CPU and RAM would cost an extra 267 CHF (299.06 USD), RAM would be about 43.50 CHF (48.72 USD) for 2x8, and CPU is another 180 CHF (201.61 USD) for 5700X, which would bring the total spent to 1096.9 CHF (1228.74 USD), some of the HW you can now find used and save a bit on the overall setup.</p><p id="fefe">It is also possible to build around Intel, and as of now, I'd go for 12th Gen Core i3 as a start (i3–12300T), just keeping in mind that the router still benefits from great single-thread 2–4 core performance.</p><p id="a41b">I might've considered EPYC or Xeon builds to work around PCIe slot limitations as an alternative.</p><h2 id="a96e">Results</h2><figure></figure><p id="99d1">After the build, while waiting for a 25 Gbps connection to be available, I ran some basic tests using a directly attached machine (Netronome &lt;-&gt; Mellanox ConnectX 4 LX, Netronome is on the server).</p><p id="d859">In this case, 172.16.0.1 is the router, and 172.16.0.2 will be a client. For simple benchmarking, I will use iperf3 and, by default, in single-threaded TCP mode (that would be a bit unrealistic and also should be harder for the system):</p><pre><span id="8b25"># iperf3 -c 172.16.0.2 -t 120<br>Connecting to host 172.16.0.2, port 5201<br>[  5] local 172.16.0.1 port 41114 connected to 172.16.0.2 port 5201<br>[ ID] Interval           Transfer     Bitrate         Retr  Cwnd<br>[  5]   0.00-1.00   sec  2.74 GBytes  23.5 Gbits/sec    0   2.67 MBytes<br>[  5]   1.00-2.00   sec  2.74 GBytes  23.5 Gbits/sec    0   2.80 MBytes<br>[  5]   2.00-3.00   sec  2.74 GBytes  23.5 Gbits/sec    0   2.80 MBytes<br>[  5]   3.00-4.00   sec  2.74 GBytes  23.5 Gbits/sec    0   2.80 MBytes<br>[  5]   4.00-5.00   sec  2.74 GBytes  23.5 Gbits/sec    0   2.80 MBytes<br>[  5]   5.00-6.00   sec  2.74 GBytes  23.5 Gbits/sec    0   2.80 MBytes</span></pre><p id="24d3">Looks good and promising (reminding that bitrate is useful data size, while raw line rate in that case is around 25 Gbps).

In that case, everything seems to be just running fine (and the CPU isn't ramping up to its full base frequency, consuming roughly 50% of a single core while running it at ~3 GHz, while Netronome caused it to boost to the highest achievable boost frequency, which for mine 3900X is ~4.4 GHz).</p><p id="797a">So I realised it wouldn't be easy to keep Netronome in place and get decent performance.</p><h2 id="a085">What is next?</h2><p id="144a">As of the time of writing, I'm still waiting for ISP to connect me to 25 Gbps.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Since our <a href="https://www.modular.com/blog/a-unified-extensible-platform-to-superpower-your-ai">launch</a> of the Mojo programming language on May 2nd, more than 120K+ developers have signed up to use the Mojo Playground and 19K+ developers actively discuss Mojo on <a href="https://discord.gg/modular">Discord</a> and <a href="https://github.com/modularml/mojo">GitHub</a>. Today, we’re excited to announce the next big step in Mojo’s evolution: <strong>Mojo is now available for local </strong><a href="https://developer.modular.com/"><strong>download</strong></a> – beginning with <strong>Linux systems</strong>, and adding Mac and Windows in coming releases.</p><p>While the <a href="https://playground.modular.com/">Mojo Playground</a> provides an easy hosted introduction to the language, the local Mojo toolchain empowers developers to accomplish much more. Local developer tools provide access to the full power of Mojo, including <strong>a full set of compiler features and IDE tools that make it easy to build and iterate on Mojo applications</strong>.</p><figure><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/64174a9fd03969ab5b930a08/64fa0ab7e29b0d13abaabff4_mojo-eco.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>In this blog post, we’ll take a high-level tour of what’s inside the Mojo SDK. First, let’s quickly review what Mojo is and how it can benefit you.</p><h3>Mojo: a high performance 'Python++' language for compute</h3><p>Mojo is <strong>a new programming language for AI developers that will grow into being a superset of Python over time</strong>. It already supports integrating with arbitrary Python code seamlessly and has a scalable programming model to target performance-critical systems, including accelerators (e.g. GPUs) that are pervasive in AI.</p><p>Mojo meets you where you are today, and enables you to progressively adopt new features to enable high performance where you need it. Mojo combines the best of dynamic and static languages together, and can achieve <a href="https://www.modular.com/blog/mojo-a-journey-to-68-000x-speedup-over-python-part-3">up to 68,000x the performance</a> of Python today. You can read more about <a href="https://docs.modular.com/mojo/why-mojo.html">Mojo’s origin story</a> in our docs, but let’s recap a few important benefits that Mojo unlocks for users:</p><ul role="list"><li><strong>Write everything in one language</strong>: Mojo meets AI developers where they are, combining the usability of Python with the systems programming features that cause developers to have to reach for C, C++, or CUDA. Your research and deployment teams can now work in a common codebase, streamlining the research to production workflow.</li><li><strong>Unlock Python performance</strong>: Python is pervasive, but not the right tool for tasks that require high performance or exotic hardware. Mojo enables high performance on CPUs, as well as support for exotic accelerators like GPUs and ASICs, providing performance on par with C++ and CUDA.</li><li><strong>Access the entire Python ecosystem</strong>: Mojo provides full interoperability with the Python ecosystem, making it seamless to use the Python libraries while taking advantage of Mojo’s features and performance benefits. For example, you can seamlessly intermix NumPy and Matplotlib with your Mojo code.</li><li><strong>Upgrade your AI workloads</strong>: Mojo integrates tightly with the Modular AI Engine, empowering you to easily extend your AI workloads with custom operations, including pre-processing, post-processing operations and high-performance mathematical algorithms. You can integrate kernel fusion, graph rewrites, shape functions, and more.</li></ul><p>As we’ve shown in <a href="https://www.modular.com/blog/how-mojo-gets-a-35-000x-speedup-over-python-part-1">past</a> <a href="https://www.modular.com/blog/how-mojo-gets-a-35-000x-speedup-over-python-part-2">blog</a> <a href="https://www.modular.com/blog/mojo-a-journey-to-68-000x-speedup-over-python-part-3">posts</a>, with simple code changes to existing Python code, you can get significant (&gt;68000x) speedups with Mojo for compute-bound workloads. If you are a Python programmer, check out <a href="https://www.modular.com/blog/an-easy-introduction-to-mojo-for-python-programmers">this blog post</a> for an easy introduction to performance optimizations with Mojo.&nbsp;</p><p>Mojo is now available for download to your computer, but Mojo is a lot more than a compiler.</p><h3>The Mojo Toolbox</h3><p>The first release of the Mojo SDK comes with <strong>everything you need to easily develop Mojo programs</strong>. This includes the following tools:</p><ul role="list"><li><strong>mojo driver:</strong> provides a shell (for read-eval-print-loop or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop">REPL</a>), and allows you to build and run Mojo programs, package Mojo modules (including support for the 🔥 extension!), generate docs, and format code<a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=modular-mojotools.vscode-mojo"><strong>‍</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=modular-mojotools.vscode-mojo"><strong>Extension for Visual Studio Code (VS Code)</strong></a>: supports various productivity features such as syntax highlighting, code completion, and more&nbsp;<strong>‍</strong></li><li><strong>Jupyter kernel:</strong> supports building and running Mojo notebooks, including Python code<strong>‍</strong></li><li><strong>Debugging support (coming soon):</strong> step into and inspect running Mojo programs, even intermixing C++ and Mojo stack frames</li></ul><p>This initial release of the SDK supports X86/Linux systems, and we will expand to additional operating systems, hardware, and tool features in upcoming updates.</p><figure><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/64174a9fd03969ab5b930a08/64f8bbb424cf49c042319fed_Tf_aqSWFNEZO993md-Yuh7Bs5ZEMglx-kyDaTzq66m1q3W4eGqFtaH6warFjp69XTIk2bvVj-q2caffdimzLZMQkl9gs3_HA5p9uXjd0YfHiZwrJryiYWJGN5QoxnpSgwflRyHOllLZwe0HN7kbSAU8.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>A view of the Mojo SDK</figcaption></figure><p>‍</p><p>Now, let’s take a look at each of the tools available in the current release of the SDK.</p><h3>Mojo Driver</h3><p>Just as with Python, you can start programming in a REPL by running the mojo command.

		<p>Microsoft’s AI-powered Copilots are changing the way we work, making customers more efficient while unlocking new levels of creativity. While these transformative tools open doors to new possibilities, they are also raising new questions. Some customers are concerned about the risk of IP infringement claims if they use the output produced by generative AI. This is understandable, given recent public inquiries by authors and artists regarding how their own work is being used in conjunction with AI models and services.</p>
<p>To address this customer concern, Microsoft is announcing our new Copilot Copyright Commitment. As customers ask whether they can use Microsoft’s Copilot services and the output they generate without worrying about copyright claims, we are providing a straightforward answer: yes, you can, and if you are challenged on copyright grounds, we will assume responsibility for the potential legal risks involved.</p>
<p>This new commitment extends our existing intellectual property indemnity support to commercial Copilot services and builds on our previous <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2023/06/08/announcing-microsofts-ai-customer-commitments/">AI Customer Commitments</a>. Specifically, if a third party sues a commercial customer for copyright infringement for using Microsoft’s Copilots or the output they generate, we will defend the customer and pay the amount of any adverse judgments or settlements that result from the lawsuit, as long as the customer used the guardrails and content filters we have built into our products.</p>
<p>You’ll find more details below. Let me start with <em><u>why</u></em> we are offering this program:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>We believe in standing behind our customers when they use our products.</strong> We are charging our commercial customers for our Copilots, and if their use creates legal issues, we should make this our problem rather than our customers’ problem. This philosophy is not new: For roughly two decades we’ve defended our customers against patent claims relating to our products, and we’ve steadily expanded this coverage over time. Expanding our defense obligations to cover copyright claims directed at our Copilots is another step along these lines.</li>
<li><strong>We are sensitive to the concerns of authors, and we believe that Microsoft rather than our customers should assume the responsibility to address them.</strong> Even where existing copyright law is clear, generative AI is raising new public policy issues and shining a light on multiple public goals. We believe the world needs AI to advance the spread of knowledge and help solve major societal challenges. Yet it is critical for authors to retain control of their rights under copyright law and earn a healthy return on their creations. And we should ensure that the content needed to train and ground AI models is not locked up in the hands of one or a few companies in ways that would stifle competition and innovation. We are committed to the hard and sustained efforts that will be needed to take creative and constructive steps to advance all these goals.</li>
<li><strong>We have built important guardrails into our Copilots to help respect authors’ copyrights.</strong> We have incorporated filters and other technologies that are designed to reduce the likelihood that Copilots return infringing content. These build on and complement our work to protect digital safety, security, and privacy, based on a broad range of guardrails such as classifiers, metaprompts, content filtering, and operational monitoring and abuse detection, including that which potentially infringes third-party content. Our new Copilot Copyright Commitment requires that customers use these technologies, creating incentives for everyone to better respect copyright concerns.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>More details on our Copilot Copyright Commitment</strong></p>
<p>The Copilot Copyright Commitment extends Microsoft’s existing IP indemnification coverage to copyright claims relating to the use of our AI-powered Copilots, including the output they generate, specifically for paid versions of Microsoft commercial Copilot services and Bing Chat Enterprise. This includes Microsoft 365 Copilot that brings generative AI to Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and more – enabling a user to reason across their data or turn a document into a presentation. It also includes GitHub Copilot, which enables developers to spend less time on rote coding, and more time on creating wholly new and transformative outputs.</p>
<p><a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/5/2023/09/Copilot-Indemnification-Blog-Image-UPDATE.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="2880" height="1350" src="https://blogs.microsoft.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/5/2023/09/Copilot-Indemnification-Blog-Image-UPDATE.png" alt="" srcset="https://blogs.microsoft.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/5/2023/09/Copilot-Indemnification-Blog-Image-UPDATE.png 2880w, https://blogs.microsoft.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/5/2023/09/Copilot-Indemnification-Blog-Image-UPDATE-300x141.png 300w, https://blogs.microsoft.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/5/2023/09/Copilot-Indemnification-Blog-Image-UPDATE-1024x480.png 1024w, https://blogs.microsoft.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/5/2023/09/Copilot-Indemnification-Blog-Image-UPDATE-768x360.png 768w, https://blogs.microsoft.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/5/2023/09/Copilot-Indemnification-Blog-Image-UPDATE-1536x720.png 1536w, https://blogs.microsoft.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/5/2023/09/Copilot-Indemnification-Blog-Image-UPDATE-2048x960.png 2048w, https://blogs.microsoft.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/5/2023/09/Copilot-Indemnification-Blog-Image-UPDATE-1920x900.png 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 2880px) 100vw, 2880px"></a></p>
<p>There are important conditions to this program, recognizing that there are potential ways that our technology could intentionally be misused to generate harmful content. To protect against this, customers must use the content filters and other safety systems built into the product and must not attempt to generate infringing materials, including not providing input to a Copilot service that the customer does not have appropriate rights to use.</p>
<p>This new benefit doesn’t change Microsoft’s position that it does not claim any intellectual property rights in the outputs of its Copilot services.</p>
<p>We have published more details of the Copilot Copyright Commitment for customers and welcome the opportunity to have further conversations as Copilots become more widely available.</p>
<p><strong>Our shared AI journey</strong></p>
<p>Today’s announcement is a first step. Like all new technologies, AI raises legal questions that our industry will need to work through with a wide array of stakeholders. This step represents a pledge to our customers that the copyright liability of our products is ours to shoulder, not theirs.</p>
<p>Microsoft is bullish on the benefits of AI, but, as with any powerful technology, we’re clear-eyed about the challenges and risks associated with it, including protecting creative works. It is our responsibility to help manage these risks by listening to and working with others in the tech sector, authors and artists and their representatives, government officials, the academic community, and civil society. We look forward to building on such announcements with new initiatives that help ensure that AI advances the spread of knowledge while protecting the rights and needs of creators.</p>

Over the past two and a half years, TAG has continued to track and disrupt campaigns from these actors, <a href="https://blog.google/threat-analysis-group/countering-threats-north-korea/">finding 0-days</a> and protecting online users. Recently, TAG became aware of a new campaign likely from the same actors based on similarities with the previous campaign. TAG is aware of at least one actively exploited 0-day being used to target security researchers in the past several weeks. The vulnerability has been reported to the affected vendor and is in the process of being patched.</p><p data-block-key="9i3qk">While our analysis of this campaign continues, we are providing an early notification of our initial findings to warn the security research community.

In one case, they carried on a months-long conversation, attempting to collaborate with a security researcher on topics of mutual interest. After initial contact via X, they moved to an encrypted messaging app such as Signal, WhatsApp or Wire. Once a relationship was developed with a targeted researcher, the threat actors sent a malicious file that contained at least one 0-day in a popular software package.</p>

The <a href="https://github.com/dbgsymbol/">source code</a> for this tool was first published on GitHub on September 30, 2022, with several updates being released since. On the surface, this tool appears to be a useful utility for quickly and easily downloading symbol information from a number of different sources. <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/debugger/symbols">Symbols</a> provide additional information about a binary that can be helpful when debugging software issues or while conducting vulnerability research.</p><p data-block-key="2u0jk">But the tool also has the ability to download and execute arbitrary code from an attacker-controlled domain. If you have downloaded or run this tool, TAG recommends taking precautions to ensure your system is in a known clean state, likely requiring a reinstall of the operating system.</p></div>

Include a list of evidence items you have already collected. Litigation is difficult and expensive, but if you have a strong case (and it sounds like you do) then the law firm may take it on contingency in return for a larger portion of the settlement/judgment.<p>EDIT: I wouldn't trust the opinions of the 'just execute better' posters here, considering your competitors' employees already infiltrated your slack channel.

Copycats and rip-offs are a fact of life, but that doesn't mean they should enjoy free reign. It's not that I think litigation is better than execution, but people exclusively advocating the latter are expressing an opinion about how they think things should work in a perfect world while not having any assets of their own on the line.

It happens all the time. Personally I would prefer that the world didn't work this way, but it's just how the game is played.<p>There are a lot of people in the tech world with the right connections, access to capital, and execution skill, but who either aren't creative enough to come up with an innovative product, or prefer to be the nth-mover in an already-validated market to the risk of trying to establish a new market. If they see that you have a good idea but aren't executing/growing/raising money at an A+ level, they will swoop in and copy your idea and then pretend that they were the first to come up with it.</p><p>There's nothing necessarily wrong with this apart from (imo) being kind of lame on a personal level. The consumer ultimately benefits from the competition, and you have only yourself to blame really for creating an opening by not executing quickly and effectively enough. It's capitalism. All the solutions to this 'problem' I've ever heard proposed--software patents and the like--create far worse problems for people who want to innovate.</p><p>If you're working on a new idea and are seeing real traction, you just need to expect this and factor it into your strategy. This is why so much emphasis is placed on having a 'moat' of some kind that is difficult to reproduce. If you're seeing success and it's easy to copy you, someone's probably already working on a clone.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p>Since Tailscale was founded in 2019, customers have been forced to choose between either Tailscale or Mullvad without the ability for them to co-exist.</p>

<p>Today we announce a partnership with Tailscale that allows you to use both in conjunction through the Tailscale app. This functionality is not available through the Mullvad VPN app.</p>

<p>This partnership allows customers of Tailscale to make use of our WireGuard VPN servers as “exit nodes”. This means that whilst connected to Tailscale, you can access your devices across Tailscale’s mesh network, whilst still connecting outbound through Mullvad VPN WireGuard servers in any location.</p>

<p>Some simple examples of this could be:</p>

<p><strong>Mobile phone:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Connects to a PC via Tailscale at your home to access private photo albums</li>
	<li>At the same time: browses the Internet via a Mullvad VPN server located in Sweden</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Personal computer:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Connects via Tailscale to another PC whilst in a cafe to work on self-hosted documents</li>
	<li>At the same time: sends all other traffic through Mullvad VPN whilst on unencrypted WiFi</li>
</ul>

<p>Read more on using Mullvad exit nodes with Tailscales VPN service on Tailscales website here: <a href="https://tailscale.com/kb/1258/mullvad-exit-nodes/">https://tailscale.com/kb/1258/mullvad-exit-nodes/</a></p>

            <pubDate>Thu, 07 Sep 2023 15:22:26 GMT</pubDate>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://blog.kagi.com/small-web">https://blog.kagi.com/small-web</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37420281">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            
            <p>As a part of our ongoing pursuit to humanize the web, we are pleased to announce the launch of Kagi Small Web.</p>

<h2>What is Kagi Small Web?</h2>

<p>While there is no single definition, “small web” typically refers to the non-commercial part of the web, crafted by individuals to express themselves or share knowledge without seeking any financial gain. This concept often evokes nostalgia for the early, less commercialized days of the web, before the ad-supported business model took over the internet (and we started <a href="https://blog.kagi.com/age-pagerank-over">fighting back</a>!)</p>

<p>For a deeper understanding, Ben Hoyt’s “<a href="https://benhoyt.com/writings/the-small-web-is-beautiful/">The Small Web is Beautiful</a>” serves as an excellent primer. Additionally, our GitHub repository links to <a href="https://github.com/kagisearch/smallweb#small-web-is-beautiful">several more articles</a> on this topic.</p>

<p>Kagi Small Web offers a fresh approach by promoting recently published content from the “small web.” We gather new content, published within the last week, from a handpicked list of blogs and surface it in multiple ways:</p>

<ul>
<li>Directly within <a href="https://kagi.com/">Kagi search results</a> for applicable queries (existing Kagi members do not need to do anything, this will be automatic)</li>
<li>Via the new <a href="https://kagi.com/smallweb">Kagi Small Web website</a></li>
<li>Through the Kagi Small Web <a href="https://kagi.com/api/v1/smallweb/feed">RSS feed</a></li>
<li>Via our Search API, where results are now part of the <a href="https://help.kagi.com/kagi/api/enrich.html">news enrichment API</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Initially inspired by a <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36575081">vibrant discussion on Hacker News</a>, we began our experiment in late July, <a href="https://twitter.com/KagiHQ/status/1685376538852687873">highlighting blog posts from HN users</a> within our search results. The positive feedback propelled the initiative forward. Today, our evolving concept boasts a curated list of nearly 6,000 genuine websites featuring people with a wide variety of interests.</p>

<p>The entire Kagi Small Web initiative, including the list of curated websites, is open-source and can be found on <a href="https://github.com/kagisearch/smallweb">Kagi’s GitHub</a>.</p>

<h2>Small Web in Kagi Search: A Unique Flavor</h2>

<p>Since inception, we’ve been featuring content from the small web through our proprietary Teclis and TinyGem <a href="https://help.kagi.com/kagi/search-details/search-sources.html#internal">search indexes</a>. This inclusion of high-quality, lesser-known parts of the web is part of what sets Kagi’s search results apart and gives them a unique flavor.</p>

<p>Today we’re taking this a step further by integrating Kagi Small Web results into the index.</p>

<p>For instance, a search for “<a href="https://kagi.com/search?q=swiftui&amp;r=us&amp;sh=KDbKVza9CAapjd2vu2dOmg">swiftui</a>” now brings up <a href="https://useyourloaf.com/blog/swiftui-sensory-feedback/">this</a> intriguing article from the small web.  It discusses a noteworthy change in iOS 17 and comes from Keith Harrison’s “Use Your Loaf” blog. Yes, you’ve just met one of your “web neighbors.”</p>

<p><img src="https://kagifeedback.org/assets/files/2023-09-06/1694022077-846506-screenshot-2023-09-06-at-104044.png" alt="swiftui search example"></p>

<p>(note that the example Kagi search URL has been generated using Kagi’s “<a href="https://help.kagi.com/kagi/getting-started/#sharing-search-results">Share this Search</a>” feature, enabling users without a Kagi account to view the results)</p>

<p>And to compare to the above, see Google’s search results for “<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=swiftui">swiftui</a>”.</p>

<p>Another example: a search for “<a href="https://kagi.com/search?q=apple+watch&amp;r=us&amp;sh=dx8wSwPLpyWhxxOEJvGJQQ">apple watch</a>” yields <a href="https://www.screamingatmyscreen.com/so-long-apple-watch/">this recent piece</a> from Timo’s ‘Screaming at My Screen’ blog.</p>

<p><img src="https://kagifeedback.org/assets/files/2023-09-06/1694023033-814006-screenshot-2023-09-06-at-105649.png" alt="apple watch example"></p>

<p>Notice how it adds a fresh perspective to the prevailing opinions on Apple Watch, including a fascinating neighboring result about <a href="https://prometheus.med.utah.edu/~bwjones/2015/07/apple-watch-pixels/">Apple Watch Pixels</a> from 2015, coming from our Teclis index.</p>

<p>Compare this diversity to <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=apple+watch">Google’s results</a> for the same term.</p>

<p>We strongly believe that including the results from the “small web” not only brings us closer to a more humane experience in the web search, but makes the search genuinely better!</p>

<h2>Introducing the Kagi Small Web Website</h2>

<p>We are also launching the <a href="https://kagi.com/smallweb">Kagi Small Web website</a>,  a new platform through which we want to surface all the recent content from the small web, that usually zips by in legacy search engines.</p>

<p><img src="https://kagifeedback.org/assets/files/2023-09-06/1694030544-838854-screenshot-2023-09-06-at-130216.png" alt="Kagi Small Web website"></p>

<p>Designed in line with the ethos of the “small web,” our website operates without JavaScript.</p>

<p>Here, you can “appreciate” a post or jot down a temporary public note about it. These notes will vanish in about a week as we cycle in new content - emphasizing the fleeting, imperfect nature of the small web.</p>

<p>When we previewed the site to a select group of beta testers on our <a href="https://kagi.com/discord">Discord channel</a>, one user was especially excited to find their blog among the curated feeds. Though they hadn’t posted recently and weren’t featured on the KSW website, they felt inspired to write more. This enthusiasm serves as a direct counter to the creeping “adshitification” of the web, encouraging genuine content over commercial clutter.</p>

<p>Our selection criteria for the curated feeds are:</p>

<ul>
<li>The blog must have a post at least three years old.</li>
<li>Content must be in English (hard to curate non-English).</li>
<li>The site should offer authentic self-expression or high informational value.</li>
<li>No NSFW</li>
</ul>

<p>For a post to appear on the KSW website, additional conditions include:</p>

<ul>
<li>It needs to be no older than seven days.</li>
<li>The site should be compatible with iframe embedding. If it’s not, we’ll still index it for our search results.</li>
</ul>

<p>The website is also <a href="https://github.com/kagisearch/smallweb/tree/main/app">open source</a>, and we’re open to merge requests.</p>

<h2>Discover Small YouTube</h2>

<p>Explore our experimental “Small YouTube” feature <a href="https://kagi.com/smallweb/?yt">here</a>.</p>

<p>It surfaces content from emerging YouTube creators who have fewer than 400k subscribers. Your feedback on this criterion is welcome.</p>

<h2>Access via Feed and API</h2>

<p>Obtain real-time updates from Kagi Small Web through our <a href="https://kagi.com/api/v1/smallweb/feed/">RSS feed</a>, refreshed every 5 hours.</p>

<p>For API enthusiasts, Kagi Small Web is integrated into our <a href="https://help.kagi.com/kagi/api/enrich.html">TinyGem index</a>, offering high-quality, non-mainstream news from around the web at $2 per 1000 queries.</p>

<h2>How to Contribute and Provide Feedback</h2>

<p>We’re open to refinements. If you notice omissions or inclusions that don’t fit, please contribute to our curated list following the <a href="https://github.com/kagisearch/smallweb/tree/main#add-a-site-or-channel-to-the-list">guidelines</a>.</p>

<p>For bug reports and feature suggestions, head to <a href="https://kagifeedback.org/">kagifeedback.org</a> and use the small-web tag to categorize your post.</p>

<p>For general discussions, join us on <a href="https://kagi.com/discord">Kagi Discord</a>.</p>

<h2>Final Words</h2>

<p>The driving question behind this initiative was simple yet profound: the web is made of millions of humans, so where are they? Why do they get overshadowed in traditional search engines, and how can we remedy this?</p>

<p>This project required a certain leap of faith as the content we crawl may contain anything, and we are putting our reputation on the line vouching for it.</p>

<p>But we also recognize that the “small web” is the lifeblood of the internet, and the web we are fighting for. Those who contribute to it have already taken their own leaps of faith, often taking time and effort to create, without the assurance of an audience.</p>

<p>Our goal is to change that narrative. Together with the global community of people who envision a different web, we’re committed to revitalizing a digital space abundant in creativity, self-expression, and meaningful content - a more humane web for all.</p>

<p><a href="https://mullvad.net/">Mullvad</a> is a Virtual Private Network (VPN) service that’s known for its strong commitment to user privacy, anonymity, and security. It safeguards user privacy by not logging or monitoring user activity, and it uses a unique account number system for subscriptions, meaning personal data is not tied to your account. Services like Mullvad help you browse the internet more privately.</p>
<p>Taking advantage of this new partnership means that even when you’re far from home, you can stay connected to the things you care about via Tailscale and maintain private internet browsing from your tailnet thanks to Mullvad’s secure and high-speed global network.</p>
<h3 id="tailscale-vs-mullvad">Tailscale vs. Mullvad</h3>
<p>You may have heard the term VPN being used interchangeably to refer to Tailscale and services like Mullvad. While both uses are technically correct, there’s a stark difference in why you’d use each type of service. Tailscale helps smooth out the connectivity problems of today by building you a personal private internet, which we call a tailnet. This helps you connect to the services and people you care about, securely, from just about anywhere on the planet. Privacy VPNs help you connect to the internet in a secure, private, and anonymous manner. You can protect yourself from advertisers, ISPs, threat actors on a public Wi-Fi network, marketing sites, and more by using a privacy VPN to mask your device identity.</p>
<p>Before today, you’d have to roll your own infrastructure to get some of the same benefits of a privacy VPN while using Tailscale. With our Mullvad partnership, that changes.</p>
<h3 id="mullvad-is-your-privacy-edge">Mullvad is your privacy edge</h3>
<p>When you use Mullvad, you get instant access to hundreds of servers in 40+ countries around the world. To connect to any one of those servers, your device generates a WireGuard key pair: the public key is used to identify peers in Mullvad’s infrastructure, and the private key is used to encrypt traffic. When you use Tailscale with a Mullvad exit node, it’s the same thing! Your node registers its existing Tailscale-generated WireGuard key pair with Mullvad’s infrastructure. Any traffic coming over the internet is terminated at Mullvad’s network edge, and end-to-end encrypted all the way to your device. Basically, you get to bring Mullvad’s entire fleet of servers into your tailnet.</p>

</figure>

<p>Tailscale acts as a coordination layer between your devices and Mullvad’s network edge. Tailscale’s control layer continually updates the available Mullvad network map, and tells your devices which servers to connect to in each available region or city, and alerts your device of any changes that may affect your connection. Tailscale then lets your device know which Mullvad nodes are available, and sends your device connection information for the selected region or city. From there, traffic goes directly through the connected Mullvad node to the internet. Like other traffic flowing over your tailnet, your data is end-to-end encrypted. Tailscale doesn’t have the private key, so we can’t see your traffic.</p>
<h3 id="using-mullvad-exit-nodes">Using Mullvad Exit Nodes</h3>
<p>Starting today, you can use Mullvad exit nodes to do things like privately and securely browse the web at home or on-the-go, protect yourself prying eyes on public Wi-Fi, connect to the internet from specific locations around the globe, and forward non-standard port traffic like web, game, or media servers through Mullvad’s network edge. Want to give it a try yourself?</p>
<ul>
<li>To enable Mullvad Exit Nodes, have a tailnet admin head over to the <a href="https://login.tailscale.com/admin/settings/general">general settings</a> page of your admin console, and click <strong>Configure</strong>.</li>
<li>Select the devices you’d like to use with Mullvad on your tailnet.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="private-and-mostly-anonymous">Private and (mostly) anonymous</h3>
<p>Tailscale is a privacy-first company, and we go out of our way to design our software to preserve the privacy of its users. We’re also an identity-based company, and that property is similarly built into our architecture. Each Tailscale connection is a WireGuard tunnel — which is end-to-end encrypted, meaning that we can’t see the contents of the traffic even if we wanted to, and also authenticated, providing strong guarantees that traffic is flowing between endpoints that are who they claim to be.</p>
<p>You can see how this works in the design of the feature we’re announcing today. Mullvad is not sent any of your personal information; while Tailscale knows who you are through associated identity providers, this information is never needed for a connection to Mullvad’s servers. We let your local Tailscale client know where to send over its public WireGuard keys to establish a connection. From there, any traffic to the internet will flow through Mullvad VPN infrastructure, obscuring the personal details of your device, network, and connection from prying eyes.</p>
<p>For many use cases, that is a great combination. You get Tailscale’s strong privacy guarantees and a framework that keeps the number of parties with access to your identity to a minimum. It’s not true anonymity, because that’s a problem Tailscale is not trying to solve. But for the many users who want Tailscale’s powerful encryption and ease of use, and whose threat model allows for that kind of conditional anonymity, it works.</p>
<p>There are also valid use cases that require privacy <em>and</em> true anonymity. But there are risks to providing these guarantees commercially, <a href="https://mullvad.net/en/blog/2023/5/29/removing-the-support-for-forwarded-ports/">as cited by Mullvad</a> and <a href="https://www.ivpn.net/blog/gradual-removal-of-port-forwarding/">others</a>. Bad actors can take advantage of these services, turning them into abuse vectors. That in turn can lead to a worse experience for everyone, including the people who most rely on these services for their own safety. This is a genuinely hard problem, compounded by the fact that it can affect vulnerable populations with very little room for error. For people with this challenging threat model, education is important: resources like <a href="https://ssd.eff.org/">EFF’s Surveillance Self-Defense guide</a> can help explain what tools are appropriate.</p>
<h3 id="mullvad--tailscale">Mullvad + Tailscale</h3>
<p>Mullvad exit nodes are ready to use starting today, available as a public beta. You can scale your Mullvad use across your family or team for a rate of $5 per month for every 5 devices with access, with recurring automated billing. Mullvad is available as a paid add-on to any current Tailscale plans, including our Free plan. To get started, head over to your <a href="https://login.tailscale.com/admin/settings/general">general settings</a> tab in the admin console and select <strong>Configure</strong>.</p>

This week's question had me busy doing a lot of research, including consulting Dr. Emilie Zuniga, <a href="https://blog.duolingo.com/language-tips-from-a-hyperpolyglot/">a hyperpolyglot</a>. Let's take a look!</p><h3 id="our-question-this-week">Our question this week:</h3><!--kg-card-begin: html--><div><p>Dear Duolingo,</p><p>

I love Dear Duolingo and reading about how different languages can be! My question is: Are there any words that all languages have in common?
</p><p>
Thanks,<br>
One-hit wonder
</p></div><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>If you're learning a new language, you already know that grammar can be wildly different, new sounds can be incredibly hard to learn, and of course each word is different! Even <a href="https://blog.duolingo.com/cognates-in-spanish/#what-is-a-cognate">cognates</a>—words that look and mean the same in different languages—can <a href="https://blog.duolingo.com/false-cognates/">sometimes be misleading</a>. Cognates get borrowed from one language to another, or they get passed down from an older language (like Latin) to the languages that evolve from it (like <a href="https://blog.duolingo.com/what-are-romance-languages/">Spanish, French, and Italian</a>). </p><p>But cognates are often limited to languages spoken in the same region, or are shared across languages that have been in contact with each other. Are there any words that made it outside their region to <em>all</em> languages?</p><p>For this post, I wasn't able to research all 7000+ languages (unfortunately!). But I did look at a lot of them, and I found a surprising answer:</p><p>YES!!*</p><p>*Or, well… it seems like 2 words have come close. 😬 Let's take a look!</p><h2 id="honorable-mentions-3-words-that-made-it-pretty-far">Honorable mentions: 3 words that made it pretty far</h2><p>Before we get to the (possible) winners, there are a few words to mention that really tried their hardest to make it around the globe. For these words, there are just a few options worldwide:</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>🫖 <strong>Words for tea</strong><br>Whether you take milk or sugar or prefer black or green, you probably call this drink either <a href="https://blog.duolingo.com/double-names-chai-tea-naan-bread/">"tea" or "chai"</a>—and both words originated from a single word used in east Asia long ago! Which one your language uses reflects the history of this beverage and <a href="http://languageoffood.blogspot.com/2014/08/tea-if-by-sea.html?ref=blog.duolingo.com">how it traveled the world</a>. Over the centuries that single word underwent many small changes to its pronunciation in different parts of China… leading to 2 distinct words today! Which word your language uses depends on which region of China speakers of your language were trading with.</p><p><em>Exceptions: We don't know of any! But with over 7,000 languages in the world, there's bound to be some exceptions we don't know about.</em></p><p>🍍 <strong>Words for pineapple</strong><br>For this tropical fruit, there are basically 3 options around the world: words that sound like <em>ananas,</em> words that sound like <em>abacaxi</em>, and words having something to do with pine cones.</p><p><em>Ananas</em> and <em>abacaxi </em>both come from words used by the Tupi, an indigenous community in South America, where this fruit comes from. Today, you'll find a form of <em>ananas</em> in Hindi, Arabic, Swahili, and most European languages. Interestingly, both Tupi-origin words are used in Portuguese: <em>Ananás</em> is the word in Portugal, <em>abacaxi</em> is the word in Brazil, and the Portuguese-speaking Azores use both, for different kinds of pineapples!</p><p>Long ago, English used a form of <em>ananas</em> as well, but it was soon replaced by the word <em>pineapple</em>… which originally meant "pinecone"! In Germanic languages like English, <em>apple</em> was a generic word for any fruit, so a <em>pineapple</em> was the "fruit" of the pine tree. In the 17th century, 2 important things happened to change this: A new word <em>pinecone </em>came onto the scene for the pine tree fruits, and people started talking about an incredible new-to-them fruit that sort of looked like that pine tree fruit. <em>Pineapple </em>was repurposed for the new fruit!</p><p>Many languages that use <em>pineapple</em>-like words borrowed their word from English, although Spanish <em>piña</em> (like <em>pino, </em>"pine tree") evolved separately for the same reasons!</p><p><em>Exceptions: Mandarin Chinese uses a different word for pineapple.</em></p><p>🍊 <strong>Words for orange</strong><br>This citrus fruit has a similar story: A bitter orange fruit that originated in Asia was popularized and traded by merchants who used a variant of the Sanskrit word <em>naranga-s</em> (orange tree). But some centuries later, a new, sweeter orange made its way into markets worldwide, and it ended up being named after the Portuguese merchants who bought and sold it. So some languages use a <em>naranga-s</em> word (which was adopted into Persian, then Arabic, and then to European languages), and others use a word that sounds like <em>portugal</em>!</p><p>Those 2 words cover most languages, but there's a third word in the mix: <em>appelsin</em>, and words like it. These variants are found in languages of northern Europe and in Russian and Ukrainian. This is another version of <em>apple</em> showing up with that general "fruit" meaning, and the suffix <em>-sin </em>comes from the Latin word for China (an <em>appelsin </em>is a "Chinese fruit" or "Chinese apple").</p><p><em>Exceptions: Hindi, Mandarin Chinese, and Swahili use something besides these 3 options for "orange." It's also worth noting that some languages have different words for the fruit and the color, so one might be like the options here and the other could be something else!</em></p><h2 id="runners-up-2-words-that-nearly-made-it">Runners up: 2 words that *nearly* made it<br></h2><!--kg-card-begin: html--><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>🚕 <strong>Words for taxi</strong><br>On this list, <em>taxi</em> is the newest, having only been coined in the early 20th century! Its swift adoption in languages worldwide reflects the <a href="https://blog.duolingo.com/history-of-english-language/">growth of English</a>, car culture, and this sort of car service that charges a fee (like a <em>tax</em>!).</p><p><em>Exceptions: Mandarin Chinese and Icelandic use their own words instead of </em>taxi<em>: 出租车 (chūzūchē) in Mandarin and</em> <em>leigubíl in Icelandic.</em> <em>Modern Standard Arabic uses سيارة أجرة. In all 3, the word is based on the words for "rent" and "car"! (Note that Arabic dialects typically use a word like "taxi.")</em></p><p>🍅 <strong>Words for tomato</strong><br>Now back to foods: <em>tomato</em> is another word and food that has spread across the globe. It comes from the Nahuatl word <em>tómatl</em>, and so many communities first encountered the food from the Spanish who called it a <em>tomate</em>. </p><p><em>Exceptions: Italian uses </em>pomodoro<em>, and some other languages use a word similar to the Italian one. Mandarin Chinese is another exception!</em></p><h2 id="our-champions-2-words-that-are-the-same-worldwide">Our champions: 2 words that are the same worldwide</h2><p>This pair pushed through borders when our runners up lost steam: You can use both words in basically any country and it has the same meaning everywhere. They might be pronounced slightly differently, or have an extra ending or prefix, but the core words have made it around the world—this time, even to Chinese.</p><p>Ready? 🥁🥁🥁</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>☕️ <strong>COFFEE</strong><br>Like the other food words on this list, there was a time when coffee was unknown in much of the world. 😳 As it was traded and adopted in communities worldwide, the Arabic word &nbsp;قهوة <em>qahwah </em>was adopted along with it—and in the variants of <em>qahwah</em> you can see how languages tweak the sounds of a word to make it their own! </p><p>The Arabic "q" sounds is produced at the back of the throat, so other languages used whatever sound they had at the very back of the mouth (typically a "k" sound like in English <em>coffee</em>). The "w" in the Arabic word was also often replaced (not all languages have a "w" sound!)—the Turkish word <em>kahve</em> uses the "v" sound which is also made at the lips. It's the Turkish word that was borrowed into many European languages, and so you can see an additional change from "v" to another lip sound: the "f" you know from English <em>coffee</em>, Spanish <em>café</em>, Italian <em>caffè</em>, etc.</p><p>Are there any exceptions? 🤔 &nbsp;Probably… but we don't know them! (<a href="mailto:dearduolingo@duolingo.com">Tell us!</a>)<br></p><p>🍫 <strong>CHOCOLATE</strong><br>And alongside that hot cup of joe is the word for chocolate: It's the same everywhere around the world! If a language has a word for this confection, then it's based on a Nahuatl word or phrase for a drink made of ceiba and cocoa. The Spanish version of this word (probably quite a bit different from the original Nahuatl word) has been borrowed by communities worldwide. </p><p>When other communities and languages adopted this new food, they slightly altered the pronunciation and spelling to match their language. For example, German and Russian replaced the "ch" sound with "sh," and Japanese added "o" to the end of the English word since Japanese words can't end with "t" sounds.</p><p>Just like with the other semi-global words in this post, <em>chocolate</em> gets this honor because the food and idea of <em>chocolate</em> itself originated in one region and was unknown elsewhere—so when people first learned about the food, they learned the Nahuatl word for it at the same time, too. They went hand in hand! And as the product spread around the world, that single word was carried along for the ride.</p><p>So the world over, some variation of <em>coffee </em>and <em>chocolate</em> will get you exactly what you're hoping for!</p><h2 id="all-for-one-and-one-for-all">All for one, and one for all!</h2><p>It's fun to see what kinds of words many unrelated languages do share! And now you can be proud that you probably know 2 words in (nearly) every spoken language on earth. 😉</p><p>For more answers to your language and learning questions, get in touch with us by emailing <a href="mailto:dearduolingo@duolingo.com">dearduolingo@duolingo.com</a>.</p>

<div>
<p>Moviegoers, critics, and the average internet user have all used the aggregation site Rotten Tomatoes at one point or another. The website categorizes films and shows from “fresh” to “rotten,” with rotten being those with lower ratings. Now it looks like the site’s scores have been <a href="https://www.screengeek.net/2019/02/27/captain-marvel-rotten-tomatoes-early-user-reviews-disabled/">manipulated</a> for more than five years.</p>
<p>As noted via <a href="https://www.vulture.com/article/rotten-tomatoes-movie-rating.html">Vulture</a>, it looks like a PR firm has manipulated movie scores on Rotten Tomatoes by paying the critics directly. This has been happening for years.</p>
<p>The PR firm, named Bunker 15, is said to pay as much as $50.00 for a single Rotten Tomatoes review. The payments, which aren’t typically disclosed, are usually given to obscure critics who happen to be part of a pool tracked by Rotten Tomatoes. Though it’s worth noting that the aggregation site’s rules prohibit <strong>“Reviewing based on a financial incentive.”</strong></p>
<p>Director <a href="https://www.screengeek.net/tag/paul-schrader/">Paul Schrader</a>, also a critic, spoke out against Rotten Tomatoes which he says is part of a <strong>“broken”</strong> system.</p>
<p><strong>“The system is broken. Audiences are dumber. Normal people don’t go through reviews like they used to. Rotten Tomatoes is something the studios can game. So they do.”</strong></p>
<p>The site responded by delisting a variety of Bunker 15 films from their website. Furthermore, they issued a warning to any critics that reviewed them. The warning emphasizes that they do not tolerate manipulation on their platform.</p>
<p><strong>“We take the integrity of our scores seriously and do not tolerate any attempts to manipulate them. We have a dedicated team who monitors our platforms regularly and thoroughly investigates and resolves any suspicious activity.”</strong></p>
<p>It’s possible that there are other similar cases happening on the website. And while <a href="https://www.screengeek.net/tag/rotten-tomatoes/">RT</a> can try to remove these websites – it looks like moviegoers, critics, and even studios feel that audiences just rely too heavily on the platform. And, for that reason alone, it makes sense why manipulation is bound to happen.</p>
<p>Stay tuned to ScreenGeek for any additional updates on this situation with Rotten Tomatoes as we have them.</p>

                                        <p>Over a summer of record-breaking heat and energy use, the Electric Reliability Council of Texas has frequently called on Texans to voluntarily conserve power to help shore up the grid. But on Wednesday night, ERCOT went much further, entering into emergency operations for the first time since 2021 and introducing the possibility that rolling blackouts may be necessary to stabilize the Texas power system.</p><p>The evening started, as many before it, with a conservation call. Starting around 6 p.m., ERCOT asked people to voluntarily keep their air conditioning turned down and not run big appliances. The call came, the group said, as heat drove energy demand up and wind power was forecasted to be low.</p>
<p>These calls for conservation are one option the grid operator has to help balance energy supply and demand on the grid. When supply and demand are out of whack, it disrupts the frequency over which electricity travels on the system. The frequency should be kept steady at about 60 hertz. If it deviates for too long, that can break the electric grid, <a href="https://www.kut.org/energy-environment/2021-02-24/texas-power-grid-was-4-minutes-and-37-seconds-away-from-collapsing-heres-how-it-happened" target="_blank">leading to catastrophe</a>.</p><p>Despite that call to conserve, between 6:30 p.m. and 7 p.m., the power reserves available to the Texas grid began dropping suddenly. A drop in reserves is common in the evenings, as solar power decreases as the sun goes down. But the speed at which the system lost energy suggests more was at play, prompting some grid-watchers to suspect <a href="https://twitter.com/EEpartnership/status/1699618217759514958?s=20" target="_blank">a large power plant stopped working.</a></p><p>Regardless of the cause, the shock to the system appears to have caught grid operators off guard.</p><p>When energy reserves start to look threatened, ERCOT will ideally call an Emergency Alert Level 1, allowing it to pull power resources from new places to stabilize the grid. In this case, the grid operator immediately declared an Alert Level 2 at around 7:30 p.m.</p><p>That’s the level just preceding rolling blackouts.</p><p>“Controlled outages may be needed to protect the electric system,” the group warned in an email. “Please reduce electric use. If you have medical needs, contact your local utility, and have a backup plan."</p><p>Around the same time, the frequency of the grid also started to tumble.</p><p>Declaring an energy Emergency Alert Level 2 allowed ERCOT to take several actions to rebalance the grid, including enacting more demand response programs that pay large power users to conserve energy, forcing any idling power generators (if, indeed, any were idling) to produce electrons, and trying to pull extra electricity from the few interconnections between Texas' grid and neighboring grids. Texas is the only state with its own independent power grid.</p>
<p>“Tonight, in ERCOT there was a sudden frequency drop, for reasons that are still being investigated. Industrial loads were called upon to shut down their operations and help stabilize the grid,” read a statement from the Texas Association of Manufacturers. “Many reduced their usage voluntarily, while others were retained by ERCOT in advance to address this type of unexpected situation.”</p><p>Some of these tactics have proven controversial with consumers. One program that pays <a href="https://www.kut.org/energy-environment/2023-08-28/ercot-pays-big-companies-to-conserve-power-prompting-some-consumers-to-ask-why-not-me" target="_blank">big power users like cryptocurrency operations </a>millions to conserve, has come under particular scrutiny, as Texans have been asked to conserve voluntarily for months.</p><p>If these emergency tactics don’t stabilize the grid, the next option is "rolling blackouts," meaning to cut power to users for brief periods of times to rebalance supply and demand. </p><p>On Wednesday night, that last resort was not needed. </p><p>The emergency lasted about two hours, after which ERCOT said grid conditions had returned to normal.</p><p>“By entering EEA 2, ERCOT was able to utilize additional reserve resources to protect the reliability of the grid,” the grid operator <a href="https://twitter.com/ERCOT_ISO/status/1699612869107572910?s=20" target="_blank">said around 9:30 p.m</a>. “No power outages associated with the ERCOT power grid were necessary.”</p><p>The event left unanswered questions, especially about what happened to energy supply. People are wondering why reserves dropped so quickly, and why the grid operator appeared to not see it coming.</p><p>But the one other, obvious, contributing factor was record-high energy demand due to a Texas heat wave that has begun to feel never-ending.  </p><p>"This is what happens when it is 97 degrees outside at ~8 pm," Michael Webber, a professor in UT Austin’s Department of Mechanical Engineering <a href="https://twitter.com/MichaelEWebber/status/1699585727967703466?s=20" target="_blank">tweeted</a>. "Demand at 8 pm this year is as high as our 5 pm peaks last year. Insane."</p><p><i>This is a developing story …</i><br></p>

The state respects the cultural differences and lifestyles of ethnic groups, and ensures the equal rights of ethnic minorities in politics, economy, culture, language and folk customs, religious belief and other aspects, with coordinated measures. In 2013 China’s ethnic minorities and areas inhabited by ethnic minorities made new achievements and developments in various undertakings, and all ethnic minorities fully enjoyed and effectively exercised their basic rights. The political rights of ethnic minorities are fully guaranteed. Areas inhibited by ethnic minorities in compact communities exercising regional ethnic autonomy enjoy autonomous rights in a wide range of areas, including legislative power, flexibility in the execution of relevant state laws and regulations, the right to use their own spoken and written languages, personnel management power, financial management power, and the right of independently developing their special culture and education. The advantages of regional ethnic autonomy are best exemplified in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region. Xinjiang is an ethnic autonomous area mainly inhibited by the Uyghur people. Autonomous organs at all levels in Xinjiang formulate and implement autonomous regulations, local rules and regulations, and legally binding decisions in light of their actual conditions, ensuring the autonomous rights of ethnic autonomous areas. All China’s 55 ethnic minority groups elect deputies to the NPC and members to the National Committee of the CPPCC. Ethnic minorities’ economic and social rights are fully protected.</p></blockquote><p><span>Never mind that </span><strong>none of this answers my actual question.</strong></p><p>Some final, if premature, observations:</p><ol><li><p><span>From the carefully neutral line on Myanmar to the boilerplate copy-pasting, it is clear that ERNIE tries its best to toe Beijing’s line. </span><strong>When approached directly, it’s not easy to get it to go off script, especially as it frequently shuts down conversations.</strong><span> Hypothetical prompting, however, can lead it to show new perspectives.

Intel will likely adopt ASML's High-NA tools for its post-18A process technologies, whereas its rivals from TSMC and Samsung will use them later in this decade. But those scanners are not going to be cheap. It is estimated that they may cost over $300 million per unit, which will further rise costs of leading-edge fabs.</p><figure data-bordeaux-image-check=""><div><p><picture><source type="image/webp" alt="ASML" onerror="if(this.src &amp;&amp; this.src.indexOf('missing-image.svg') !== -1){return true;};this.parentNode.replaceChild(window.missingImage(),this)" data-normal="https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/tomshardware/media/img/missing-image.svg" data-srcset="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fJZFqKVUyn65n6WqsPeGZ5-320-80.png.webp 320w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fJZFqKVUyn65n6WqsPeGZ5-480-80.png.webp 480w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fJZFqKVUyn65n6WqsPeGZ5-650-80.png.webp 650w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fJZFqKVUyn65n6WqsPeGZ5-970-80.png.webp 970w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fJZFqKVUyn65n6WqsPeGZ5-1024-80.png.webp 1024w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fJZFqKVUyn65n6WqsPeGZ5-1200-80.png.webp 1200w" data-sizes="(min-width: 1000px) 970px, calc(100vw - 40px)" data-original-mos="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fJZFqKVUyn65n6WqsPeGZ5.png" data-pin-media="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fJZFqKVUyn65n6WqsPeGZ5.png"><source type="image/png" alt="ASML" onerror="if(this.src &amp;&amp; this.src.indexOf('missing-image.svg') !== -1){return true;};this.parentNode.replaceChild(window.missingImage(),this)" data-normal="https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/tomshardware/media/img/missing-image.svg" data-srcset="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fJZFqKVUyn65n6WqsPeGZ5-320-80.png 320w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fJZFqKVUyn65n6WqsPeGZ5-480-80.png 480w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fJZFqKVUyn65n6WqsPeGZ5-650-80.png 650w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fJZFqKVUyn65n6WqsPeGZ5-970-80.png 970w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fJZFqKVUyn65n6WqsPeGZ5-1024-80.png 1024w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fJZFqKVUyn65n6WqsPeGZ5-1200-80.png 1200w" data-sizes="(min-width: 1000px) 970px, calc(100vw - 40px)" data-original-mos="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fJZFqKVUyn65n6WqsPeGZ5.png" data-pin-media="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fJZFqKVUyn65n6WqsPeGZ5.png"><img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fJZFqKVUyn65n6WqsPeGZ5.png" alt="ASML" onerror="if(this.src &amp;&amp; this.src.indexOf('missing-image.svg') !== -1){return true;};this.parentNode.replaceChild(window.missingImage(),this)" data-normal="https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/tomshardware/media/img/missing-image.svg" data-srcset="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fJZFqKVUyn65n6WqsPeGZ5-320-80.png 320w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fJZFqKVUyn65n6WqsPeGZ5-480-80.png 480w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fJZFqKVUyn65n6WqsPeGZ5-650-80.png 650w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fJZFqKVUyn65n6WqsPeGZ5-970-80.png 970w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fJZFqKVUyn65n6WqsPeGZ5-1024-80.png 1024w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fJZFqKVUyn65n6WqsPeGZ5-1200-80.png 1200w" data-sizes="(min-width: 1000px) 970px, calc(100vw - 40px)" data-original-mos="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fJZFqKVUyn65n6WqsPeGZ5.png" data-pin-media="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fJZFqKVUyn65n6WqsPeGZ5.png" srcset="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fJZFqKVUyn65n6WqsPeGZ5-320-80.png 320w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fJZFqKVUyn65n6WqsPeGZ5-480-80.png 480w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fJZFqKVUyn65n6WqsPeGZ5-650-80.png 650w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fJZFqKVUyn65n6WqsPeGZ5-970-80.png 970w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fJZFqKVUyn65n6WqsPeGZ5-1024-80.png 1024w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fJZFqKVUyn65n6WqsPeGZ5-1200-80.png 1200w"></picture></p></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description"><span itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: ASML)</span></figcaption></figure><p>ASML's contemporary EUV scanners with a 0.33 NA and a 13nm resolution can print chips with metal pitches of around 30nm with single exposure patterning, which is good enough for production nodes like 5nm or 4nm-classes. For everything finer, chipmakers either need to use EUV double patterning or pattern shaping techniques, which is what they are going to be doing for the next couple of years. But beyond that they plan to use ASML's next-generation High-NA EUV scanners with a 0.55 NA and a resolution of around 8nm.</p><p>It is necessary to note that 0.55 NA EUV tools will not supplant the current deep ultraviolet (DUV) and EUV equipment in contemporary fabs, just like introduction of 0.33 NA EUV did not phase out DUV lithography. ASML will keep advancing its DUV and 0.33 NA EUV scanners for the foreseeable future. Concurrently, High-NA EUV lithography will play a pivotal role in shrinking transistor dimensions and boosting their performance.</p>

<p>If you know us, you will know that we are the team behind <a href="https://github.com/Textualize/rich">Rich</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Textualize/textual">Textual</a> — two popular Python libraries that work magic in the terminal.</p>

<p>Today we are adding one project more to that lineup: <a href="https://github.com/Textualize/textual-web">textual-web</a>.</p>
<!-- more -->

<p>Textual Web takes a Textual-powered TUI and turns it in to a web application.
Here's a video of that in action:</p>
<p>
<iframe width="auto" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/A8k8TD7_wg0" title="Textual Web in action" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p>

<p>With the <code>textual-web</code> command you can publish any Textual app on the web, making it available to anyone you send the URL to.
This works without creating a socket server on your machine, so you won't have to configure firewalls and ports to share your applications.</p>
<p>We're excited about the possibilities here.
Textual web apps are fast to spin up and tear down, and they can run just about anywhere that has an outgoing internet connection.
They can be built by a single developer without any experience with a traditional web stack.
All you need is proficiency in Python and a little time to read our <a href="https://textual.textualize.io/">lovely docs</a>.</p>
<p>Future releases will expose more of the Web platform APIs to Textual apps, such as notifications and file system access.
We plan to do this in a way that allows the same (Python) code to drive those features.
For instance, a Textual app might save a file to disk in a terminal, but offer to download it in the browser.</p>
<p>Also in the pipeline is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_web_app">PWA</a> support, so you can build terminal apps, web apps, and desktop apps with a single codebase.</p>
<p>Textual Web is currently in a public beta. Join our <a href="https://discord.gg/Enf6Z3qhVr">Discord server</a> if you would like to help us test, or if you have any questions.</p>

<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Introduction</h2>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Welcome to snake-fury</strong>: the Haskell challenge for beginners. This challenge aims to provide a learning path for people willing to learn Haskell further than basic recursion exercises by implementing the snake game in Haskell. Snake-fury's pedagogical approach is based on two legs:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>snake-fury isn't a tutorial but a challenge.</li>
<li>snake-fury is focused on learning by refactoring, not by example.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">The first leg means that you'll be asked to implement some functions/algorithms. It is expected that the challenger will be unable to implement them without some research on Hackage's documentation, blogs, youtube videos, etc. There will be guidelines to help the challenger. Nevertheless, an important skill when learning Haskell is to be able to search, read and understand the documentation that is (often, but not always) more complex and less accessible than other programming languages.</p>
<p dir="auto">The second leg is even more interesting. Haskell is notoriously known for its difficulty and the popularization of the holy triad: Functor - Applicative - Monad. There are plenty of tutorials showing examples and hundreds of thousands of lines trying to make them accessible and newcomer-friendly... But with all due respect, It seems they all fail to explain: "Why monads? Why not other less mathematical abstraction? Why not classic OOP patterns?". The approach given by snake-fury is to make the same application twice... it sounds crazy, but the idea goes like this: You'll implement a "pure" version of the snake game: No monads, no functors, no abstractions [<a href="#note-about-not-using-monads">see below</a>]. Then you will refactor the core application logic using the state and reader monads. Then you'll be asked to abstract your code and to use <code>mtl</code> classes to make your code less dependent on the concrete implementation.</p>
<p dir="auto">Below there is a dramatization of Haskell's learning curve. This challenge aims to be a helpful companion from the newby slope to the temple of oblivion... but be aware, nothing will save you from the temptation of abandon. Hopefully, you'll be able to climb up to the temple and spread the lambdas</p>
<p dir="auto"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/lsmor/snake-fury/blob/main/assets/Haskell_learning_curve.png"><img src="https://github.com/lsmor/snake-fury/raw/main/assets/Haskell_learning_curve.png" alt="dramatization of Haskell's learning curve"></a></p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">note about not using monads</h3>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">By that I mean, not using do notation nor functor/applicative/monads combinators like <code>liftA2</code>, <code>fmap</code>, <code>&gt;&gt;=</code>, etc...
Obviously, The IO and the asynchronous part of the code are provided and the challenger is not expected to solve it.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Start coding: Building a MVP</h2>
<p dir="auto">First you need access to a Haskell development environment. You can either:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Install it locally following the <a href="https://www.haskell.org/get-started/" rel="nofollow">official guide</a> (Recommended).</li>
<li>You can use gitpod to quickly jump into an <a href="https://www.gitpod.io/docs/introduction/getting-started" rel="nofollow">online environment</a>. Follow these considerations:
<ul dir="auto">
<li>You will need a fork of the repo in order to save your progress</li>
<li>If you are a <code>stack</code> user, modify the <code>hie.yaml</code> so the cradle is <code>stack</code> not <code>cabal</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Once you have a dev-env up and running, clone the code and move to <code>snake-fury-exercise</code> branch</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="git clone https://github.com/lsmor/snake-fury.git
git checkout snake-fury-exercise

# Optionally, you can create a solution branch out of this one
git checkout -b my-solution # (example name)"><pre>git clone https://github.com/lsmor/snake-fury.git
git checkout snake-fury-exercise

<span><span>#</span> Optionally, you can create a solution branch out of this one</span>
git checkout -b my-solution <span><span>#</span> (example name)</span></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">You should see this folder structure (among other files)</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="app
 |- Main.hs            # (implemented)     the entrypoint of your application.
src
 |- EventQueue.hs      # (implemented)     here is the EventQueue.
 |- GameState.hs       # (not implemented) here will go the logic of the game.
 |- RenderState.hs     # (not implemented) here will go the data structures for rendering the game
 |- Initialization.hs  # (implemented)     some utility functions"><pre>app
 <span>|</span>- Main.hs            <span><span>#</span> (implemented)     the entrypoint of your application.</span>

 <span>|</span>- EventQueue.hs      <span><span>#</span> (implemented)     here is the EventQueue.</span>
 <span>|</span>- GameState.hs       <span><span>#</span> (not implemented) here will go the logic of the game.</span>

 <span>|</span>- Initialization.hs  <span><span>#</span> (implemented)     some utility functions</span></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Exercises are comments in the files:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><code>src/GameState.hs</code></li>
<li><code>src/RenderState.hs</code></li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">They can be filled in any order.</p>
<p dir="auto">Each file correspond to each component in the system (and some utilities to keep code simpler). Be sure you read the <a href="#architecture">architecture</a> section to understand why the code is structured this way. Notice that you'll need to implement as many auxiliary functions as you need to make it work. If you feel stuck you can check the <a href="#solution-branches">solution</a> I've implemented.</p>
<p dir="auto">Once you complete all exercises in <code>GameState.hs</code> and <code>RenderState.hs</code> you should be able to run the snake game in a terminal with the command below.</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="# To move the snake, either

<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Continue coding: Refactors</h2>
<p dir="auto">You've built a minimum viable product. Now it is time to improve it!. In the <code>exercises</code> folder you have intructions for refactoring. Follow them one by one as enumerated. One of the ideas is you feel the power of the type system when refactoring. Also you'll be dealing with poor design choices implemented in the mpv part.</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><strong>refactor-1</strong>: you will move from you mvp to a full snake game with all the functionality: like a score counter and increasing speed. Also, you'll deal with performance issue the mvp has.</li>
<li><strong>refactor-2</strong>: you will refactor the logic of the game to use the state monad. Hopefully you'll find code much easier to read.</li>
<li><strong>refactor-3</strong>: you will refactor the logic of the game to use the reader + state monad stack. Also, as an optional but recommended exercise, you can learn about the IO monad</li>
<li><strong>refactor-4</strong>: You will refactor the code to use <code>mtl</code> like constraints. Now the code looks a little bit abstract but it is easy to read and follow</li>
<li><strong>refactor-5</strong>: Finally, you'll refactor the code to be fully abstracted over the monad stack you use. You will create you own type classes expressing exactly the actions you want to execute.</li>
</ul>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Solution branches</h2>
<p dir="auto">You have multiple solutions branches, one for each refactor step and one for the mvp. Below you have the relation of branches and refactors. You can run <code>git branch -l</code> to see the list of all branches.</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><code>solution-mvp</code> branch corresponds to the solution of the first exercise</li>
<li><code>solution-refactor-1</code> branch corresponds to the solution of the first refactor in <a href="https://github.com/lsmor/snake-fury/blob/main/exercises/refactor-1.md">exercises/refactor-1</a></li>
<li><code>solution-refactor-2.1</code> branch corresponds to the solution of the second refactor, step 1 in <a href="https://github.com/lsmor/snake-fury/blob/main/exercises/refactor-2.md#step-1-apply-changes-locally">exercises/refactor-2</a></li>
<li><code>solution-refactor-2.2</code> branch corresponds to the solution of the second refactor, step 2 in <a href="https://github.com/lsmor/snake-fury/blob/main/exercises/refactor-2.md#step-2-did-you-spot-the-pattern-thats-a-monad">exercises/refactor-2</a></li>
<li><code>solution-refactor-3</code> branch corresponds to the solution of the third refactor in <a href="https://github.com/lsmor/snake-fury/blob/main/exercises/refactor-3.md">exercises/refactor-3</a></li>
<li><code>solution-refactor-4.1</code> branch corresponds to the solution of the fourth refactor, step 1 in <a href="https://github.com/lsmor/snake-fury/blob/main/exercises/refactor-4.md#step-1-mtl-constraints">exercises/refactor-4</a></li>
<li><code>solution-refactor-4.2</code> branch corresponds to the solution of the fourth refactor, step 2 in <a href="https://github.com/lsmor/snake-fury/blob/main/exercises/refactor-4.md#step-2-glue-together-renderstate-and-gamestate">exercises/refactor-4</a></li>
<li><code>solution-refactor-5</code> branch corresponds to the solution of the fifth refactor in <a href="https://github.com/lsmor/snake-fury/blob/main/exercises/refactor-5.md">exercises/refactor-5</a></li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">My solution might be different than yours, and that is totally fine. All solution branches should build and run the same as your exercise branch.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">note 1: <code>main</code> branch is unstable an you shouldn't build it. Contains all sort of experiments, including an heavy sdl front-end</p>
<p dir="auto">note 2: At the moment, the <code>main</code> branch doesn't use frames per second but microseconds as input parameter. Hence <code>cabal run snake-fury -- 10 10 100000</code> will run at 10 fps. In the exercise branch, the input parameter is correct. So if you want to build from <code>main</code> be aware of this change.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Architecture</h2>
<p dir="auto">The general architecture of the software is the following:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>There are three major components:
<ul dir="auto">
<li>An <em>Event Queue</em>: It keeps a queue of the following events to happen in the game based on the user keyboard input</li>
<li>A <em>Game State</em>: Is the logic state. It keeps track on the snake body, the current apple, the direction of movement, etc...</li>
<li>A <em>Render State</em>: Is the game board. Instead of building up the board from the GameState, we keep an array in memory and modify it as convenient</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Each compoment sends a message to the next one in the following order: <code>(user keyboard) -&gt; EventQueue -&gt; GameState -&gt; RenderState -&gt; (render device)</code></li>
<li>We have two threads:
<ul dir="auto">
<li>The secondary thread is continuously reading from user's keyboard and pushing the key strokes into an asynchronous <code>EventQueue</code></li>
<li>The main thread reads at steady time from the <code>EventQueue</code>, and based on what the user has pressed, it runs the game logic and prints the board in the console</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Notice that two threads are necessary, since user could press keys faster than the game updates (fps). For example let say we run a frame each second and a half (normal speed in the snake game), then a user is likely to press keys faster than that. If the key strokes are catched only when a frame is about to be rendered, then many strokes will be lost.</p>
<p dir="auto">The following diagram helps to visualize</p>
<p dir="auto"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/lsmor/snake-fury/blob/main/assets/snake_architecture.png"><img src="https://github.com/lsmor/snake-fury/raw/main/assets/snake_architecture.png" alt="Overview of the architecture"></a></p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Contributions and Feedback</h2>
<p dir="auto">Please, open an issue if you:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>find some solution branch doesn't build. Typically this is due to some external dependencies not available or an error with <code>cabal</code>. Add label <em>solution branch does not build</em> to the issue</li>
<li>If you think the README or any of the exercises is poorly written, or could be improved substantially. Add label <em>documentation</em> to the issue</li>
<li>If the software builds but it missbehaves. For example, the snake doesn't move, or the board looks wrong. Add label <em>bug</em> to the issue</li>
<li>If you want to provide some feedback (see below). Add label <em>feedback</em> to the issue.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">If you want to contribute with a PR, take into account that due to the refactoring nature of the challenge, there are many branches. This makes integration difficult but you should follow these two rules:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><strong>Documentation</strong> should be merge into <code>main</code> branch. This rule apply to README, any markdown under <code>exercises</code>, and any file in the <code>assets</code> folder</li>
<li><strong>Code</strong> should be merge into <code>solution-mvp</code> if the change applies to all refactors; Or merge into <code>solution-refactor-XXX</code> if the change applies only to that refactor, hence you should branch out from the corresponding branch. Any change done in <code>solution-mvp</code> is merge into <code>snake-fury-exercise</code> and <code>solution-refactor-XXX</code>.</li>
<li>If you aren't sure how to contribute, just ask :)</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">The branch graph look like:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="main
 |-solution-mvp
   |-snake-fury-exercise
   |-solution-refactor-1
     |-solution-refactor-2
       |-solution-refactor-2.2
         |-solution-refactor-3
           |-solution-refactor-4.1
             |-solution-refactor-4.2
               |-solution-refactor-5"><pre>main
 |-solution-mvp
   |-snake-fury-exercise
   |-solution-refactor-1
     |-solution-refactor-2
       |-solution-refactor-2.2
         |-solution-refactor-3
           |-solution-refactor-4.1
             |-solution-refactor-4.2
               |-solution-refactor-5</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Also I'd appreciate if you write some feedback for me. As already said, open an issue with a label <em>feedback</em>. These issue won't be closed, as it is easier for someone comming to the challenge to filter by open issues with label <em>feedback</em>, rather than closed issues. Please, do not use the <em>feedback</em> issue for any other than providing feedback, so if you have an idea on how to improve the challenge open a second issue with your proposal. Ideally <em>feedback</em> issue will have a maximum of two comments: the feedback itself, and a second comment in case the issue is outdated due to changes.  Avoid meaningless feeback if possible.</p>
<p dir="auto">Positive feedback should answer these questions:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>How much Haskell did you know before starting the challenge?</li>
<li>Does the project helped you with some concepts more than other resources?</li>
<li>In your opinion, What's the most difficult part?</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Negative feedback (is welcome) should answer these questions:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>How much Haskell did you know before starting the challenge?</li>
<li>How much of the project have you completed?</li>
<li>How can I improve the challenge?</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Here are some examples:</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Wrong positive feedback</strong></p>
<p dir="auto">This challenge is cool!</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Right positive feedback</strong></p>
<p dir="auto">This challenge is cool!. I learnt some Haskell a year ago but could not build anything usefull with it (so I was in the valley of frustration and abandom the language). Monads are much clearer now, I am still wrapping my head around mtl style, but sure I will get it!!.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Wrong negative feedback</strong></p>
<p dir="auto">This challenge is worthless</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Right negative feedback</strong></p>
<p dir="auto">This challenge is worthless. I've being learning Haskell for the last 6 months and still I am unable to build anything usefull. Building the mpv is doable (but very difficult), but when you start with the first refactor you end up touching the f**** IO monad and using ByteString/Builder. Why on earth Haskell hasn't a good default string library??.</p>
<p dir="auto">This challenge should make an effort to explain all the inconviniences newcommers should face when getting into the language.</p>

            <pubDate>Thu, 07 Sep 2023 10:21:44 GMT</pubDate>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/09/07/uk_government_clause_online_safety_bill/">https://www.theregister.com/2023/09/07/uk_government_clause_online_safety_bill/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37416909">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p><span>Comment</span> Sanity appears to have prevailed in the debate over the UK Online Safety bill after the government agreed to ditch proposals - at least for the time being - to legislate the scanning of encrypted messages.</p>
<p>In response to questions regarding the technical feasibility of scanning messages and the assessments that Ofcom must make, Lord Parkinson, a Digital, Culture, Media and Sport minister, <a target="_blank" href="https://hansard.parliament.uk/lords/2023-09-06/debates/4AC6A32E-0C53-46C7-A714-AD4165C484D7/OnlineSafetyBill">said</a>: "If the appropriate technology does not exist that meets these requirements, then Ofcom will not be able to use Clause 122 to require its use."</p>
<p>Clause 122 in the Online Safety Bill relates to online terrorism and child exploitation content.</p>

    

<p>Parkinson said: "A notice can be issued only where technically feasible and where technology has been accredited as meeting minimum standards of accuracy."</p>

        


        

<p>Thus no scanning of encrypted messages unless it is technically feasible to do so. Quantum computing, anyone?</p>
<h3>Victory? Not so fast...</h3>
<p>The statements have been widely interpreted as a victory for technology firms, many of which had <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/04/28/online_safety_bill_age_checks/">threatened</a> to exit the UK over the requirement that it must be possible for encrypted messages to be scanned for illegal content.</p>
<p>However, it could also be argued that the changes only represent the bare minimum needed to get the bill across the line. The controversial clauses remain largely in place, with the buck passed to future administrations, or to when reading the messages becomes "technically feasible."</p>
<p>Matthew Hodgson, CEO of Element, said: "The government saying 'no scanning until it's technically feasible' is nonsense. Scanning is fundamentally incompatible with end-to-end encrypted messaging apps. Scanning bypasses the encryption in order to scan, exposing your messages to attackers."</p>

        

<p>He told <i>The Register</i> that the statement and the reaction from some section of the tech community left him terrified. “It’s not a win at all,” he said.</p>
<p>Hodgson continued: “the ministers must be feeling utterly smug… the pressure has been removed from them to change the bill and stop scanning, and they didn’t have to do anything”</p>
<p>“It's terrible because the law still says that scanning can be obligated on encrypted messaging providers, it would still undermine end to end encryption. And all it is [doing] is pushing it slightly down the line until somebody decides it's technically feasible, which is a completely subjective thing.”</p>

        

<p>Martina Larkin, CEO of Project Liberty, queried the thinking behind the clause and said: "No one is questioning that more must be done to protect people, especially children, online. However the debate should not be about protecting children versus protecting privacy. We can have, and should have, both."</p>
<p>"When it comes to how we build a better web, everybody loses when rash decisions are made. Trying to protect children by building backdoors into encryption will have unprecedented negative consequences for online privacy, the use of people's data as well as the protection of free speech and democratic values. No one would ever willingly let a complete stranger read all of your mail, put cameras in their house, and follow their every move. So why do it online?"</p>
<ul>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/06/29/apple_online_safety_bill_opposition/">Now Apple takes a bite out of encryption-bypassing 'spy clause' in UK internet law</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/04/18/wrong_time_to_weaken_encryption/">Wrong time to weaken encryption, UK IT chartered institute tells government</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/04/28/online_safety_bill_age_checks/">Online Safety Bill age checks? We won't do 'em, says Wikipedia</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/04/21/meta_encryption_police/">International cops urge Meta <em>not</em> to implement secure encryption for all</a></li>
</ul>
<p>We'll draw a discreet veil over the devices with potential for surveillance supplied by large technology companies that people have indeed cheerfully installed in their houses. Still, both Larkin and Hodgson make excellent points.</p>
<p>A spokesperson from Index on Censorship said: "The Online Safety Bill as currently drafted is still a threat to encryption and as such puts at risk everyone from journalists working with whistleblowers to ordinary citizens talking in private. We need to see amendments urgently to protect our right to free speech online."</p>
<p>Attempts to paint the UK government's apparent climbdown as a victory for big tech is missing the point. At best, a skirmish might have been won and a ceasefire temporarily declared. However, the larger battle over privacy and encryption on the internet has yet to be fought. ®</p>

<p>Apple has acquired 50-year-old record label BIS Records, the Swedish company's founder, Robert von Bahr, <a href="https://www.bis.se/">announced</a> Tuesday. The purchase of the classical music-focused label follows Apple's late March launch of the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/03/apple-will-launch-a-new-app-exclusively-for-classical-music-later-this-month/">Apple Music Classical</a> app.</p>
<p>Apple's BIS purchase adds to the app, which in March Apple called the "world's largest classical music catalogue" with "over" 5 million tracks. Von Bahr said the record label will be incorporated into the Apple Music Classical app and Platoon. Apple bought <a href="https://www.platoon.ai/">Platoon</a>, which identifies new talent and helps creators make, distribute, and market their content, in 2018. Von Bahr noted his just turning 80 as part of the decision to sell. He also pointed to his interest in Apple's support for spatial audio and in bringing "classical music to new audiences all over the world."</p>
<p>Neither Apple nor BIS disclosed the price of the acquisition. However, von Bahr said that he and the rest of the BIS staff will be "retained" by Apple.</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>The acquisition is another step in Apple's efforts to target classical music as it seeks to differentiate its streaming platform. Classical music still represents a drop in the massive bucket of on-demand music streaming. Data from data analytics firm <a href="https://luminatedata.com/blog/concerto-more-like-concert-oh/">Luminate</a> and cited by <a href="https://www.billboard.com/pro/apple-music-classical-app-good-streaming-business/">Billboard</a> in March found that classical music represented 0.8 percent of on-demand streams in the US in 2022. However, the data firm also <a href="https://luminatedata.com/blog/concerto-more-like-concert-oh/">said</a> in June that the classical music genre outpaced total US on-demand streaming growth in 2022 (13.4 percent year over year versus 12.2 percent year over year, respectively).</p>

<p>Apple launched Apple Music Classical as a separate app from <a href="https://howl.me/ckwW0tvIk7q" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Apple Music</a> on March 28. Building upon Apple's 2018 acquisition of <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/primephonic-wants-to-save-classical-music-1-stream-at-a-time">Primephonic</a>, Apple Music Classical allows various search parameters related to classical works, from song title and composer, to conductor and orchestra names, soloist performers, and more. Additional features include composer biographies and deep-dives on famous works. Since its release, Apple Music Classical has added support for devices running Android 9 Pie and later.</p>
<p>Apple didn't respond to questions seeking clarification on how Apple Music Classical artists get paid and if it differs from payments for Apple Music artists. <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/reviews/apple-music-classical">PCMag</a> in March suggested that the classical music app pays per stream, as Apple Music does. However, that wouldn't benefit older classical works. With its BIS acquisition, Apple may gain insight into how to navigate the financial side of classical music.</p>

<p dir="auto"><strong>exa</strong> is a modern replacement for the venerable file-listing command-line program <code>ls</code> that ships with Unix and Linux operating systems, giving it more features and better defaults.
It uses colours to distinguish file types and metadata.
It knows about symlinks, extended attributes, and Git.
And it’s <strong>small</strong>, <strong>fast</strong>, and just <strong>one single binary</strong>.</p>
<p dir="auto">By deliberately making some decisions differently, exa attempts to be a more featureful, more user-friendly version of <code>ls</code>.

</h2>
<p dir="auto">exa is written in <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/" rel="nofollow">Rust</a>.
You will need rustc version 1.66.1 or higher.
The recommended way to install Rust for development is from the <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install" rel="nofollow">official download page</a>, using rustup.</p>
<p dir="auto">Once Rust is installed, you can compile exa with Cargo:</p>

<ul dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto">The <a href="https://github.com/casey/just">just</a> command runner can be used to run some helpful development commands, in a manner similar to <code>make</code>.
Run <code>just --list</code> to get an overview of what’s available.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">If you are compiling a copy for yourself, be sure to run <code>cargo build --release</code> or <code>just build-release</code> to benefit from release-mode optimisations.
Copy the resulting binary, which will be in the <code>target/release</code> directory, into a folder in your <code>$PATH</code>.
<code>/usr/local/bin</code> is usually a good choice.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">To compile and install the manual pages, you will need <a href="https://pandoc.org/" rel="nofollow">pandoc</a>.
The <code>just man</code> command will compile the Markdown into manual pages, which it will place in the <code>target/man</code> directory.
To use them, copy them into a directory that <code>man</code> will read.
<code>/usr/local/share/man</code> is usually a good choice.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">exa depends on <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/git2-rs">libgit2</a> for certain features.
If you’re unable to compile libgit2, you can opt out of Git support by running <code>cargo build --no-default-features</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">If you intend to compile for musl, you will need to use the flag <code>vendored-openssl</code> if you want to get the Git feature working.
The full command is <code>cargo build --release --target=x86_64-unknown-linux-musl --features vendored-openssl,git</code>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">For more information, see the <a href="https://the.exa.website/install/source" rel="nofollow">Building from Source page</a>.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Testing with Vagrant</h3>
<p dir="auto">exa uses <a href="https://www.vagrantup.com/" rel="nofollow">Vagrant</a> to configure virtual machines for testing.</p>
<p dir="auto">Programs such as exa that are basically interfaces to the system are <a href="https://eev.ee/blog/2016/08/22/testing-for-people-who-hate-testing/#troublesome-cases" rel="nofollow">notoriously difficult to test</a>.
Although the internal components have unit tests, it’s impossible to do a complete end-to-end test without mandating the current user’s name, the time zone, the locale, and directory structure to test.
(And yes, these tests are worth doing. I have missed an edge case on many an occasion.)</p>
<p dir="auto">The initial attempt to solve the problem was just to create a directory of “awkward” test cases, run exa on it, and make sure it produced the correct output.
But even this output would change if, say, the user’s locale formats dates in a different way.
These can be mocked inside the code, but at the cost of making that code more complicated to read and understand.</p>
<p dir="auto">An alternative solution is to fake <em>everything</em>: create a virtual machine with a known state and run the tests on <em>that</em>.
This is what Vagrant does.
Although it takes a while to download and set up, it gives everyone the same development environment to test for any obvious regressions.</p>
<p dir="auto">First, initialise the VM:</p>

<p dir="auto">The first command downloads the virtual machine image, and then runs our provisioning script, which installs Rust and exa’s build-time dependencies, configures the environment, and generates some awkward files and folders to use as test cases.
Once this is done, you can SSH in, and build and test:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="host$ vagrant ssh
vm$ cd /vagrant
vm$ cargo build
vm$ ./xtests/run
All the tests passed!"><pre><code>host$ vagrant ssh
vm$ cd /vagrant
vm$ cargo build
vm$ ./xtests/run
All the tests passed!
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Of course, the drawback of having a standard development environment is that you stop noticing bugs that occur outside of it.
For this reason, Vagrant isn’t a <em>necessary</em> development step — it’s there if you’d like to use it, but exa still gets used and tested on other platforms.
It can still be built and compiled on any target triple that it supports, VM or no VM, with <code>cargo build</code> and <code>cargo test</code>.</p>

    Someone keeps trying to reset my facebook password.   I keep getting these "account recovery code" emails.  They're legit.
  </p><p>
    Whoever is doing apparently doesn't have access to my email, though, as  they keep doing it and when I check logins, I only see the devices that I have with me logged in.
  </p><p>
    Is there a way I can find out who is doing this?   Or at least get an IP address of the login attempts
  </p><p>
    I want to know if this is really someone trying to steal my account, or if it's just a Facebook-connected app that I have exhibiting some kind of bizarre bug.
  </p><p>
    I've already turned on 2FA (already had it on before this, but only with text messages, I added the Authenticator app as well)
  </p><p>
    I also went ahead and actually changed my password (NOT a password reset, changed it from within account settings) , just because good security practices.
  </p><p>
    It's annoying that this is happening, but since the security measures I already had in place have defeated these attempts,  not dire.   Still, really annoying.
  </p><p>
    I've tried searching for a way to disable password reset attempts,  but the Facebook article about it just redirects back to itself.
  </p><p>
    .
  </p><p>
    Anyone have any insights?  A way to stop this?    I don't just want to mark the reset emails as spam, what if I really need to reset my password at some point?

<p>After 3 years, the new world record was set by installing LoRaWAN trackers on a fishing boat <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.vesselfinder.com/?imo=8797219">Estrela de Sesimbra</a> and on its buoys on the Sesimbra coast, Portugal. The tracker was able to make contact with a gateway in the Canarian Islands. Three messages have been received by the <em>“cablpa-pitilleros”</em> gateway connected to The Things Stack Community Edition.</p>

<p>Nuno Cruz reports that the trackers were installed by the team of the <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://custodian.solvit.pt/">Custodian project</a> which is lead by <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.solvit.pt/">Solvit </a>and includes <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://fit.isel.pt/">FIT</a>/<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.isel.pt/">ISEL</a> (where Nuno Cruz is a researcher), <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.aircentre.org/">AirCentre DOCAPESCA</a>, <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://lotacor.pt/">LOTAÇOR</a>, <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.ntnu.edu/">NTNU</a>, <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.uavision.com/">UAVISION</a> and <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://terinovazores.pt/">TERINOV</a>.

<p>The remarkable point of this record is that it is achieved at sea level. Reaching extended distances with LoRaWAN at sea level eliminates potential variables introduced by varying altitudes, providing a standardized and objective measure of the technology's capabilities. We do have to note that this is an exceptional achievement. The majority of The Things Stack-operated devices range between 25 and 100 meters (75-300 feet) from the gateway.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-page-content="true"><p>As part of Canva's ongoing mission to build the world's most trusted platform, we continuously evaluate the security of our software dependencies. Identifying and resolving vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies helps improve the security of Canva, as well as the wider internet. Coupled with security controls like sandboxing, we continue to make it increasingly difficult for attackers to reach their objectives by exploiting third-party dependencies.</p>
<p>One such dependency Canva uses is <a target="_new" href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/librsvg">librsvg</a> (via <a target="_new" href="https://www.libvips.org/">libvips</a>). We use librsvg to quickly render user-provided SVGs into thumbnails later displayed as PNGs. By exploiting differences in URL parsers when rendering an SVG with librsvg, we showed it's possible to include arbitrary files from disk in the resulting image. The <a target="_new" href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/librsvg/-/issues/996">librsvg maintainers quickly patched the issue</a> and issued a security vulnerability (<a target="_new" href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-38633">CVE-2023-38633</a>).</p>
<p>We're sharing this research as another example of the <a target="_new" href="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2022/01/10/dont-mix-url-parsers/">dangers of mixing URL parsers</a>, especially because the example we discovered is very subtle.</p>
<p>A special thanks to Federico (librsvg maintainer), John (libvips maintainer), and Lovell (<a target="_new" href="https://sharp.pixelplumbing.com/">Sharp</a> maintainer) for their work and excellent coordinated response.</p>
<h2 id="prequel">Prequel</h2>
<p>The <a target="_new" href="https://github.com/elttam/publications/blob/master/writeups/inkscape-xml.md">XML Parsing Issues in Inkscape in CLI</a> write-up from Elttam's Victor Kahan shows how Inkscape is vulnerable to path traversal when rendering SVGs. Extending Victor's research, we found that while XInclude wasn't directly supported in Inkscape 0.9, it exhibited some interesting behavior when an SVG was nested in another SVG.</p>
<p>For example, consider the following inner SVG.</p>
<pre><p><span>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="no"?&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>&lt;</span><span>svg</span><span> </span><span>width</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>300</span><span>"</span><span> </span><span>height</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>300</span><span>"</span><span> </span><span>xmlns:</span><span>xi</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude</span><span>"</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>&lt;</span><span>rect</span><span> </span><span>width</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>300</span><span>"</span><span> </span><span>height</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>300</span><span>"</span><span> </span><span>style</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>fill:rgb(255,204,204);</span><span>"</span><span> </span><span>/&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>&lt;</span><span>text</span><span> </span><span>x</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>0</span><span>"</span><span> </span><span>y</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>100</span><span>"</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>&lt;</span><span>xi:</span><span>include</span><span> </span><span>href</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>/etc/passwd</span><span>"</span><span> </span><span>parse</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>text</span><span>"</span><span> </span><span>encoding</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>ASCII</span><span>"</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>      </span><span>&lt;</span><span>xi:</span><span>fallback</span><span>&gt;</span><span>file not found</span><span>&lt;/</span><span>xi:</span><span>fallback</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>&lt;/</span><span>xi:</span><span>include</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>&lt;/</span><span>text</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>&lt;/</span><span>svg</span><span>&gt;</span></p></pre>

<p>When run with Inkscape 0.92.4, it produced an image where the XInclude fallback was triggered.</p>
<pre><p><span>$ inkscape </span><span>-f</span><span> test.svg </span><span>-e</span><span> out.png </span><span>-w</span><span> </span><span>300</span></p></pre>
<p><span><span></span><img alt="File not found" loading="lazy" width="300" height="300" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" src="https://www.canva.dev/_next/static/media/file-not-found.82e8094e.png"><span></span></span></p>
<p>The fact that Xinclude was supported at all was surprising because it can often lead to security vulnerabilities. While Inkscape isn't used by the Canva product, <a target="_new" href="https://gitlab.com/inkscape/inkscape/-/blob/0.92.x/src/display/cairo-utils.cpp#L230">digging into the Inkscape code path</a> showed that nested images are loaded with <a target="_new" href="https://docs.gtk.org/gdk-pixbuf/">GdkPixbuf</a>, which itself delegates SVG loading to <a target="_new" href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/librsvg">librsvg</a>. This was of great interest because librsvg is something that Canva <em>does</em> use.</p>
<h2 id="xinclude">XInclude</h2>
<p><a target="_new" href="https://www.w3.org/TR/xinclude/">XInclude</a> is a mechanism for merging XML documents, which can lead to security vulnerabilities when a user-provided XML document (like an SVG) is assembled or rendered on a server.</p>
<p><span><span></span><img alt="Xinclude example" loading="lazy" width="935" height="335" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" src="https://www.canva.dev/_next/static/media/lfi.3ef943bb.png"><span></span></span></p>
<p>There are two standout elements in XInclude:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/xinclude/#include_element"><code>xi:include</code></a> to include contents of a referenced URL, such as a file or HTTP request. The content being included can be plaintext or XML.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/xinclude/#fallback_element"><code>xi:fallback</code></a> to nominate content that should be rendered when the referenced content can't be loaded by <code>xi:Include</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Security checks aside, the following XML document loads the contents of <code>/etc/passwd</code> when processed.</p>
<pre><p><span>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="no"?&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>&lt;</span><span>example</span><span> </span><span>xmlns:</span><span>xi</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude</span><span>"</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>&lt;</span><span>xi:</span><span>include</span><span> </span><span>href</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>/etc/passwd</span><span>"</span><span> </span><span>parse</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>text</span><span>"</span><span> </span><span>encoding</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>ASCII</span><span>"</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>&lt;</span><span>xi:</span><span>fallback</span><span>&gt;</span><span>file not found</span><span>&lt;/</span><span>xi:</span><span>fallback</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>&lt;/</span><span>xi:</span><span>include</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>&lt;/</span><span>example</span><span>&gt;</span></p></pre>
<h2 id="there-are-rules">There are rules</h2>
<p>librsvg is a Rust library to render SVG images to <a target="_new" href="https://www.cairographics.org/">Cairo</a> surfaces. Most of the heavy lifting is now implemented in Rust, but the library relies on the Cairo and GNOME glib C libraries.</p>
<p><span><span></span><img alt="Librsvg overview" loading="lazy" width="697" height="311" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" src="https://www.canva.dev/_next/static/media/librsvg.e1b01ae7.png"><span></span></span></p>
<p>From the prequel, we knew librsvg supported at least some of the XInclude standards. To understand how much, <a target="_new" href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/librsvg/-/tree/eec9d15145da5f6e2b70c5974b3e3c6ecac876e0">we dug into its implementation</a>. As it turns out, every external URL reference in an SVG passes through a single method for validation. This includes references such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>&lt;image href="file:///something.png" /&gt;</code></li>
<li><code>&lt;rect filter="url('file-with-filters.svg#my_filter')" /&gt;</code></li>
<li><code>&lt;xi:include href="/etc/passwd" ... /&gt;</code></li>
</ul>
<p>The librsvg <a target="_new" href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/librsvg/-/blob/eec9d15145da5f6e2b70c5974b3e3c6ecac876e0/rsvg/src/url_resolver.rs#L32">url_resolver.resolve_href</a> method implements some <a target="_new" href="https://gnome.pages.gitlab.gnome.org/librsvg/Rsvg-2.0/class.Handle.html#security-and-locations-of-referenced-files">strict security checks</a> to restrict what references can be loaded when processing an SVG document:</p>
<ul>
<li>All <code>data:</code> URLs are permitted because they can't reference external files by design.</li>
<li>The referenced scheme must match the "current document" scheme. For example, when processing <code>file:///foo/bar/example.svg</code>, any encountered URL must be of the <code>file:</code> scheme.</li>
<li>Encountered files must be in the same directory as the current document, or within a subdirectory of the current document. This is enforced by <a target="_new" href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/librsvg/-/blob/eec9d15145da5f6e2b70c5974b3e3c6ecac876e0/rsvg/src/url_resolver.rs#L68-85">checking the URL path</a>.</li>
<li>All other schemes are rejected, including <code>http:</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>These strict rules are the reason our earlier naive XInclude tests failed. But we were very interested to see if we could bypass the rules. This could result in path traversal when processing an SVG, for example, being able to include files like <code>/etc/passwd</code> in the contents of the rendered SVG to PNG.</p>
<h2 id="parser-mismatch">Parser Mismatch</h2>
<p>Resolving a URL within an SVG document has two steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Validate the URL as per the resolve rules mentioned earlier.</li>
<li>If successful, <a target="_new" href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/librsvg/-/blob/eec9d15145da5f6e2b70c5974b3e3c6ecac876e0/rsvg/src/io.rs#L87">load the contents</a>, which parses URLs using <a target="_new" href="https://docs.gtk.org/gio/">Gio</a>'s inbuilt URI parser.</li>

<p>Knowing there were two URL parsers at play (one to validate the URL and one to load the contents), to bypass the security checks, we needed to find URLs where the parsers disagreed.</p>
<p>With some quick tests, we mapped out how the URL parsers process different URLs.</p>

<p><a target="_new" href="https://docs.gtk.org/gio/">Gio</a> doesn't expose generic URL parsing (aside from GUri, which isn't on the callpath). But <code>g_filename_from_uri</code> returns on some examples.</p>

<h2 id="bypassing-validation">Bypassing Validation</h2>
<p>Given this understanding of where the URL parsers were at, we took the relevant parts from librsvg and set up a fuzzing harness ("resolve") to run the same logic as the resolve URL logic when encountering a reference (href, XInclude, etc.) from an on-disk "current.svg" file. This allowed us to quickly test and fuzz inputs to see how the parsers and validation logic were evaluated. Some interesting outputs from fuzzing were as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>resolve 'current.svg'</code>: Passes as expected.</li>
<li><code>resolve run '../../../../../../../etc/passwd'</code>: Canonicalization fails with 'No such file or directory'.</li>
<li><code>resolve 'current.svg?../../../../../../../etc/passwd'</code>: Passes.</li>
<li><code>resolve 'none/../current.svg'</code>: Passes as expected.</li>
</ul>
<p>The last 2 results showed us that <code>GFile::for_uri</code> happily resolves path traversals, including path traversals in the query string. However, the second result, <code>../../../../../../../etc/passwd</code>, failed because of the canonicalization check.</p>
<h3 id="bypassing-canonicalization">Bypassing Canonicalization</h3>
<p>Part of librsvg's URL validation is to canonicalize the built URL to replace .. and . segments per regular filesystem path rules. It does this using Rust's <a target="_new" href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/fs/fn.canonicalize.html">std::fs::canonicalize</a> (calling <a target="_new" href="https://linux.die.net/man/3/realpath">realpath</a>), which throws an error if:</p>
<ul>
<li>The path doesn't exist.</li>
<li>A non-final component in the path isn't a directory.</li>
</ul>
<p>Because we don't always know the name of the 'current' SVG on disk, we needed to bypass canonicalization if we wanted to have a URL pass librsvg's validation. After some rapid testing, it turns out this is relatively straightforward.</p>
<pre><p><span>$ realpath current.svg</span></p><p><span>/home/zsims/projects/librsvg-poc/current.svg</span></p><p><span>$ realpath </span><span>.</span><span></span></p><p><span>/home/zsims/projects/librsvg-poc/</span></p></pre>
<p>As it turns out, <code>realpath(".")</code> and <code>std::fs::canonicalize(".")</code> both return the "current directory". We can use this as a placeholder in our PoC instead of <code>current.svg</code>.</p>
<h2 id="proof-of-concept">Proof of concept</h2>
<p>Knowing how the URL parsers mismatch, and how we can bypass canonicalization without knowing the current file name, we can build a payload to include <code>/etc/passwd</code>.</p>
<pre><p><span>.?../../../../../../../etc/passwd</span></p></pre>
<p>Within a <code>poc.svg</code> SVG, this looks like the following.</p>
<pre><p><span>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="no"?&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>&lt;</span><span>svg</span><span> </span><span>width</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>300</span><span>"</span><span> </span><span>height</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>300</span><span>"</span><span> </span><span>xmlns:</span><span>xi</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude</span><span>"</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>&lt;</span><span>rect</span><span> </span><span>width</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>300</span><span>"</span><span> </span><span>height</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>300</span><span>"</span><span> </span><span>style</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>fill:rgb(255,204,204);</span><span>"</span><span> </span><span>/&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>&lt;</span><span>text</span><span> </span><span>x</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>0</span><span>"</span><span> </span><span>y</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>100</span><span>"</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>&lt;</span><span>xi:</span><span>include</span><span> </span><span>href</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>.?../../../../../../../etc/passwd</span><span>"</span><span> </span><span>parse</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>text</span><span>"</span><span> </span><span>encoding</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>ASCII</span><span>"</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>      </span><span>&lt;</span><span>xi:</span><span>fallback</span><span>&gt;</span><span>file not found</span><span>&lt;/</span><span>xi:</span><span>fallback</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>&lt;/</span><span>xi:</span><span>include</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>&lt;/</span><span>text</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>&lt;/</span><span>svg</span><span>&gt;</span></p></pre>
<p>And produces the following result.</p>
<pre><p><span>$ rsvg-convert poc.svg &gt; poc.png</span></p></pre>
<p><span><span></span><img alt="Proof of concept" loading="lazy" width="300" height="300" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" src="https://www.canva.dev/_next/static/media/poc.19965e7b.png"><span></span></span></p>
<p>We get a similar result when running through vipsthumbnail.</p>
<p>Sensitive files within <code>/proc</code>, such as <code>/proc/self/environ</code>, failed because of character encoding.</p>
<pre><p><span>$ rsvg-convert proc-poc.svg &gt; proc-poc.png</span></p><p><span>thread 'main' panicked at 'str::ToGlibPtr&lt;*const c_char&gt;: unexpected '' character: NulError(21...</span></p></pre>
<p>Note that this PoC only works where the SVG is loaded from a <code>file://</code>. SVGs loaded through <code>data:</code> or <code>resource:</code> schemes are not vulnerable.</p>
<h2 id="patch">Patch</h2>
<p>Following the report to librsvg's maintainer (see <a target="_new" href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/librsvg/-/issues/996">Issue 996</a>), Federico <a target="_new" href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/librsvg/-/merge_requests/861">patched the issue</a> to add improved URL validation and use the validated URL as input into GFile. Part of the response from Federico included a heads-up to maintainers of Sharp and libvips to upgrade before the issue was disclosed publicly as <a target="_new" href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-38633">CVE-2023-38633</a>.</p>
<p>The issue also prompted some discussion about <a target="_new" href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/glib/-/issues/3050">file URL parsing in glib</a>, resulting in some <a target="_new" href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/glib/-/merge_requests/3502">additional validation</a> in the library.</p>
<p>There were a few standouts from discovery and patching:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a target="_new" href="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2022/01/10/dont-mix-url-parsers/">dangers of mixing URL parsers</a> are just as applicable to <code>file://</code> URLs and in-process use as they are for networked services and <code>http://</code> URLs.</li>
<li><code>file://</code> URLs are special. For example, the URL specification highlights <a target="_new" href="https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#file-state">support for query strings in <code>file://</code></a> URLs,&nbsp;but the support in the implementations we reviewed varied greatly.</li>
<li>Efforts to migrate existing C code to Rust are not without risk. Although memory safety is much improved, differences in contracts (like URL parsing) can have negative security consequences.</li>
<li>Make sure you're only parsing URLs once, and using that parsed value from that point onwards.</li>
<li>If possible, enforce your own validation on files, like SVGs, before processing further. This is the reason <a target="_new" href="https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/MediaWiki">MediaWiki</a> is not impacted by this issue because <code>xi:include</code> elements are rejected before the SVG reaches librsvg.</li>
</ul>
