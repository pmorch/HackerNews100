<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The dream of soaring in the sky like a bird has captivated the human mind for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Icarus">ages</a>. Although many failed, some eventually <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wright_Flyer">succeeded</a> in achieving that goal. These days we take air transportation for granted, but the physics of flight can still be puzzling.</p>
<p>In this article we’ll investigate what makes airplanes fly by looking at the forces generated by the flow of air around the aircraft’s wings. More specifically, we’ll focus on the cross section of those wings to reveal the shape of an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airfoil"><em>airfoil</em></a> – you can see it presented in <span><strong>yellow</strong></span> below:</p>


<p>We’ll find out how the shape and the <span><strong>orientation</strong></span> of the <span><strong>airfoil</strong></span> helps airplanes remain airborne. We’ll also learn about the behavior and properties of air and other flowing matter. In the demonstration below, you can see a fluid flowing around a <span><strong>gray cube</strong></span>. Using the slider to change just one <span><strong>property</strong></span> of this substance, we can end up with vastly different effects on the liveliness of that flow:</p>


<p>Over the course of this blog post we’ll build some intuitions for why these different effects happen to airfoils and other objects placed in flowing air. We’ll start this journey by looking at some of the methods we can use to visualize the motion of the air.</p>
<h2 id="visualizing-flow">Visualizing Flow<a href="https://ciechanow.ski/airfoil/#visualizing-flow" arialabel="Anchor"><img src="https://ciechanow.ski/images/anchor.png" width="16px" height="8px"></a> </h2>
<p>If you’ve ever been outside in a grassy area on a windy fall day, you may have witnessed something similar to the little scene seen below. The slider lets you control the <span><strong>speed of time</strong></span> to observe in detail how the <span><strong>falling leaves</strong></span> and the bending <span><strong>blades of grass</strong></span> are visibly affected by the wind sweeping through this area:</p>


<p>We intuitively understand that it’s the flowing air that pushes the vegetation around, but note that we only observe the effects that the wind has on other objects – we can’t see the motion of the air <em>itself</em>. I could show you a similarly windy scene without the <span><strong>grass</strong></span> and <span><strong>leaves</strong></span>, and I could try to convince you that there is something going on there, but that completely empty demonstration wouldn’t be very gratifying.</p>
<p>Since the air’s transparency prevents us from tracking its movement directly, we have to come up with some other ways that can help us see its motion. Thankfully, the little outdoor scene already provides us with some ideas.</p>
<p>Notice that as the wind hits a blade of grass, that blade naturally bends in the direction of the blowing gust, and the faster that gust, the stronger the bending. A&nbsp;single blade indicates the direction and speed of the flow of air in that area.</p>
<p>In the next demonstration we’re looking at the same grassy field from above. When seen from this perspective, all the <span><strong>blades</strong></span> form short lines that are locally aligned with the wind. The more leaned over a blade of grass is, the longer the line it forms. We can mimic this behavior with a collection of <span><strong>small arrows</strong></span> placed all over the area, as seen on the right side:</p>


<p>Each <span><strong>arrow</strong></span> represents the direction and the speed of the flow of air at that location – the longer the <span><strong>arrow</strong></span>, the faster the flow. In these windy conditions the flow varies from place to place and it also changes over time, which we can clearly see in the motion of the <span><strong>arrows</strong></span>.</p>
<p>Note that we have some flexibility in how the speed of wind corresponds to the length of an <span><strong>arrow</strong></span>. I adjusted the lengths of the <span><strong>arrows</strong></span> to prevent them from visually overlapping, but I also made sure to maintain their <em>relative</em> lengths – if one <span><strong>arrow</strong></span> is twice as long as the other, then the flow at that location is also twice as fast.</p>
<p>For visual clarity I’m also not packing the <span><strong>arrows</strong></span> as densely as the <span><strong>blades of grass</strong></span> are placed, but it’s important to note that <em>every</em> point in the flow has its own velocity which contributes to the complete velocity <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_field"><em>field</em></a> present in this area. If we wanted to, we could draw a <span><strong>velocity arrow</strong></span> at any of the seemingly empty spots on the right side.</p>
<p>The arrows are convenient, but the grassy scene also has another aid for visualizing flows. Many light objects like <span><strong>leaves</strong></span>, flower petals, dust, or smoke are very easily influenced by the motion of the surrounding air. They quickly change their velocity to match the flow of the wind. We can replicate the behavior of these light objects with <span><strong>little markers</strong></span> that are pushed around by that flow. You can see them on the right side:</p>


<p>These little <span><strong>markers</strong></span> also show us the motion of the air. Each <span><strong>marker</strong></span> represents an object so small and light that it instantly picks up the speed of the surrounding airflow. We’d have a hard time seeing these miniscule specks at their actual sizes, so I’m drawing the <span><strong>markers</strong></span> as visible dots.</p>
<p>In fact, the motion of each <span><strong>marker</strong></span> is equivalent to the motion of the parcel of air right around it. If you <a href="#" onclick="grass3_f0();return false;">slow down time</a>, you’ll be able to see how each <span><strong>marker</strong></span> just moves in the direction of the <span><strong>arrows</strong></span> underneath it. I also made each <span><strong>marker</strong></span> leave a little ghost trail behind it – this lets us track the path the air, as represented by the <span><strong>marker</strong></span>, took on the way to its current position.</p>
<p>Let’s pause for a second to emphasize what the <span><strong>grass</strong></span>-like <span><strong>arrows</strong></span> and <span><strong>leaf</strong></span>-like <span><strong>markers</strong></span> represent –&nbsp;they both show the <em>velocity</em> of the flow of air, but in slightly different ways. An <span><strong>arrow</strong></span> is attached to its fixed point in space, so it represents the current direction and speed of the flow at <em>that location</em>. The whole collection of arrows lets us easily see what the entire flow is doing at the moment.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the little <span><strong>markers</strong></span> are actively following the flow, letting us see how the air is actually <em>moving</em> through space, with the ghosty trails giving us some historical overview of where this parcel of air has come from.</p>
<p>The two methods we’ve seen so far are very versatile, but sometimes we don’t care about the local direction of the flow, only its speed – in the middle of this grassy field one might get cold from a fast blowing wind regardless of the direction from which that wind is coming. This brings us the third way of visualizing flow:</p>


<p>In this method we show the <em>speed</em> of the airflow using colors of varying brightness – the faster the wind, the brighter the color. You can see the whole <strong><span>spectrum of colors</span></strong> in the scale below the plot.</p>
<p>This method shows the speed of the flow at <em>all</em> locations giving us a more fine-grained insight into the motion of air at the cost of the directional information. To help with that I’ll sometimes overlay the regular arrows on top to let us know where the flow is going as well.</p>
<p>You may have noticed that all these methods present a flat, two dimensional view of the flow. It’s based on the assumption that the wind in our little scene doesn’t change with elevation, and that it also doesn’t blow towards or away from the ground.</p>
<p>In reality, the air velocity could vary in all three dimensions, and that air could also flow upwards or downwards. Thankfully, the air flows we’ll consider in this article will be two dimensional and the simple flat drawings will suffice.</p>
<p>Before we finish this section, let me bring up visualization of a simple airflow, but this time I’ll give you some control over its <span><strong>direction</strong></span>, which you can change using the second slider. The first one once more controls the <span><strong>speed of time</strong></span>:</p>



<p>Don’t be misled by the frozen arrows, the wind is actually blowing there. Remember that the arrows represent the local velocity of the flow of air, so while the velocity doesn’t change, the <em>position</em> of each packet of air does. You can see those changes by tracking the <span><strong>markers</strong></span> moving around with the flow. This demonstration represents a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid_dynamics#Steady_vs_unsteady_flow"><em>steady flow</em></a>, which means that its properties don’t change over time.</p>
<p>So far we’ve been exploring the notion of airflow’s velocity on a more intuitive level, with a general understanding that’s it’s “the air” moving around in some direction and at some speed. I illustrated that concept using simple <span><strong>arrows↑</strong></span>, <span><strong>markers&nbsp;•</strong></span>, and <strong><span>varying colors</span></strong>, but we’re now ready to investigate the details hiding behind those straightforward graphical representations.</p>
<p>To do that, we have to look at individual particles of air. Although I <a href="https://ciechanow.ski/sound/#air">briefly discussed</a> the particle nature of air before, this time around we’re going to take a closer look at the motion of these molecules, and what it means for airflow as a whole.</p>
<h2 id="velocity">Velocity<a href="https://ciechanow.ski/airfoil/#velocity" arialabel="Anchor"><img src="https://ciechanow.ski/images/anchor.png" width="16px" height="8px"></a> </h2>
<p>Let’s take a look at the air particles in a small, marked out volume of space seen in the demonstration below – you can drag the cube around to change the viewing angle. The slider controls the <span><strong>speed of time</strong></span>:</p>


<p>You’re witnessing the motion of over twelve thousand air particles. It may seem like a lot, but this cube is <em>extremely</em> <span>tiny</span>, its sides are only 80 nanometers long. To put this in perspective using more familiar sizes, if that cube’s side measured just <span>1 inch</span><span>1 centimeter</span>, it would contain around <span>410 quintillion, or 4.1×10<sup>20</sup></span><span>25 quintillion, or 2.5×10<sup>19</sup></span> particles.</p>
<p>The particles are zipping around in random directions, constantly entering and leaving this region. However, despite all this motion what you’re seeing here is a simulation of <em>still</em> air.</p>
<p>To understand how all this movement ends up creating still conditions, we first have to look at the velocity of each particle – I’ll visualize it with a small arrow in the direction of motion. To make things a easier to see, I’ll also <span><strong>highlight</strong></span> a few of the particles while fading out the rest of them:</p>


<p>The length of an arrow is proportional to the speed of a particle, so when you <a href="#" onclick="particles2_f0();return false;">freeze the time</a> you should be able to see how some particles are slower and some are faster. This speed variation follows a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell%E2%80%93Boltzmann_distribution">certain distribution</a> that’s related to temperature – the warmer the air, the faster the motion of its particles.</p>
<p>At room temperature the average speed of a particle in air is an astonishing <span>1030&nbsp;mph</span><span>1650&nbsp;km/h</span>, which is many times higher than even <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saffir%E2%80%93Simpson_scale#Category_5">the most severe hurricanes</a>. Given the size of the cube, this means that even at the <a href="#" onclick="particles2_f1();return false;">fastest speed of simulation</a> everything happens 11 <em>billion</em> times slower than in real life.</p>
<p>If you paid close attention, you may have also noticed that sometimes the particles randomly change direction and speed of their motion – this happens when molecules collide. Each particle experiences roughly ten billion collisions per second. We’ll get back to these interactions later on, but for now let’s try to figure out how all this turmoil creates still air.</p>
<p>Having just seen the small velocity arrows of individual particles, let’s calculate the <em>average</em> velocity of a group of three <span><strong>particles</strong></span>, using the process shown below. We first take the velocity arrows <span><strong>from</strong></span> <span><strong>each</strong></span> <span><strong>particle</strong></span> and place them head to toe, one after another. Then we connect the start of the <span><strong>first arrow</strong></span> with the end of the <span><strong>last arrow</strong></span> to create the <span><strong>sum</strong></span> of all velocities. Finally, we divide, or scale down, the length of this <span><strong>sum</strong></span> by the number of particles to get the <span><strong>average velocity</strong></span>:</p>

<p>In the next demonstration we’re repeating this whole procedure by tallying up all the particles inside the <span><strong>red box</strong></span>. You can change the <span><strong>size</strong></span> of that region with the second slider. The <strong>large arrow</strong> in the middle shows the average velocity of particles in the box. To make that <strong>central arrow</strong> visible, I’m making it much larger than the tiny arrows tied to particles:</p>



<p>The counter in the bottom part of the demonstration tracks the current number of particles in the <span><strong>red cube</strong></span>. That value fluctuates as the molecules enter and leave that region. While aggregating over a small number of particles creates a very <a href="#" onclick="particles3_f0();return false;">noisy readout</a>, it doesn’t take <em>that</em> many particles to get a much <a href="#" onclick="particles3_f1();return false;">steadier measure</a>.</p>
<p>Recall that the scale of the <strong>large central arrow</strong> is much larger than the scale of individual tiny arrows attached to each particle. Despite that increase in size, the <strong>arrow</strong> practically disappears when we average out a larger number of particles and we can clearly see that the average velocity of particles is more or less zero even in this extremely small volume.</p>
<p>In still conditions, all these motions in different directions average out to nothing. As some particles enter the area from a random direction, the others also leave it in a random way. The <em>bulk</em> of air doesn’t really go anywhere and the particles just meander in a random fashion.</p>
<p>An imperfect, but convenient analogy is to imagine a swarm of bees flying in the air. While all the individual insects are actively roaming around at different speeds, the group as a whole may steadily stay in one place.</p>
<p>All these experiments form the key to understanding what happens when wind sweeps through an area. In the demonstration below, we’re once again watching a small volume of space, but this time you can control the <span><strong>speed</strong></span> of the blowing wind:</p>



<p>Notice the <span>mph</span><span>km/h</span> speedometer in the bottom of the demonstration. This is not a mistake –&nbsp;even with <a href="#" onclick="particles4_f0();return false;">hurricane-level wind speeds</a> it’s very hard to see any difference in the motion of the particles. Perhaps you’ve managed to see the tiniest shifts in the small particle arrows as you drag the <span><strong>second slider</strong></span> around with <a href="#" onclick="particles4_f1();return false;">time paused</a>, but it’s difficult to even perceive from which direction the wind is blowing.</p>
<p>However, when we use the procedure of averaging the velocity of all the particles, we can reveal the motion of their group in the box of a given <span><strong>size</strong></span>, at a specific <span><strong>speed</strong></span> of the flow:</p>




<p>Because the motion of each individual particle is so disordered, we have to look at many of them at once to discern any universal characteristics. And when we do <a href="#" onclick="particles5_f0();return false;">just that</a>, from all the chaos emerges order.</p>
<p>It’s important to note that with this approach we’re tracking the velocity of the flow within the same region of space outlined by the <span><strong>red box</strong></span> – the molecules keep entering and leaving this area as the flow moves and the <strong>arrow</strong> in the middle shows the average velocity of the air’s particles in that <span><strong>area</strong></span>.</p>
<p>This is <em>exactly</em> what the grass-like arrows we’ve played with in the previous section represent – each one shows the average velocity of air particles in that local region of space. The <strong>big arrow</strong> we just saw in the middle of the swarm in the <span><strong>averaging red box</strong></span> is equivalent to each of the <span><strong>arrows</strong></span> seen below:</p>


<p>Naturally, the <span><strong>averaging box</strong></span> needs to be large enough to avoid the jitteriness related to aggregation of too few particles, but at any scale that we could care about the noisy readout completely disappears.</p>
<p>The <em>average</em> motion of particles is very different than the motion of each individual molecule. Even in very fast flows, many of the molecules move in the opposite direction than what the arrow indicates, but if we tally up all the particle motion, the air as a whole does make forward progress in the direction of velocity.</p>
<p>Up to this point, we’ve mostly looked at the flow of air by looking at wind and the way it moves through space, but what we consider a motion of air is relative. Let’s see how, by merely changing the point of view, we can create a motion of air in otherwise windless conditions.</p>
<h2 id="relative-velocity">Relative Velocity<a href="https://ciechanow.ski/airfoil/#relative-velocity" arialabel="Anchor"><img src="https://ciechanow.ski/images/anchor.png" width="16px" height="8px"></a> </h2>
<p>Let’s zoom away from the world of microscopic particles to look at the motion of larger bodies. In the demonstration below, you can see two different views of the same <span><strong>car</strong></span> driving in the left direction. In the top part, the camera stays firmly on the ground, but in the bottom part, the camera tracks the motion of the <span><strong>vehicle</strong></span>. If needed, you can restart the scene with the button in the bottom left corner or tweak the <span><strong>speed of time</strong></span> with the slider:</p>


<p>These two views show the exact same scene – we’re just changing what the camera is focusing on. As seen in the top part, from the perspective of the static camera, it’s only the <span><strong>car</strong></span> that has some velocity in the left direction.</p>
<p>On the other hand, from the perspective of the camera focused on the <span><strong>vehicle</strong></span>, the <span><strong>car</strong></span> doesn’t move, but <em>everything else</em> does. The poles and road markings all move to the right with a speed equal to that of the <span><strong>car</strong></span>. This shouldn’t come as a surprise from daily experience in any form of transportation – when you’re sitting in a moving vehicle, static things in the surrounding environment seem to move towards and past you.</p>
<p>The very same rules apply to any region of air – I’ve outlined some of them with dashed boxes <span></span>  up in the sky. For the observer on the ground that air is still, but from the <span><strong>car’s</strong></span> perspective, that air is moving.</p>
<p>With that in mind, let’s see the same scene, but this time I’ll add the familiar small arrows showing the air’s velocity as “seen” by the camera:</p>


<p>From the point of view of the <span><strong>car</strong></span>, as seen in the bottom view, the air is moving to the right, as if there was some wind blowing right at the <span><strong>vehicle</strong></span>. You’ve probably felt this many times by sticking your hand out the window – it feels no different than if you were standing still on the ground with the wind hitting your fingers.</p>
<p>In fact, there is absolutely no difference between “regular” wind and wind experienced by the <span><strong>car</strong></span>  or your hand sticking out the window – both are simply a motion of air relative to some object. This means that we can use our arrows to represent any motion of air, as long as we note what that motion is relative to.</p>
<p>You may have also noticed that the moving <span><strong>car</strong></span> affects the motion of air in its vicinity. Let me bring up the previous demonstration one more time:</p>


<p>In the top view, we can see how the front of the <span><strong>vehicle</strong></span> pushes the air forward, and how the air “bends” and speeds up around the shape of the <span><strong>car</strong></span> to roughly follow its shape, only to end up circling right behind the <span><strong>machine</strong></span>.</p>
<p>The same effects are seen in the bottom view – they’re just experienced differently. For example, the air right in front of the <span><strong>car</strong></span> slows down, while the air on top moves even faster than the rest of the undisturbed, distant air.</p>
<p>We’ll soon explore <em>why</em> the air behaves this way when flowing around an object, but for now let’s raise above the ground to see the motion of an <span><strong>airplane</strong></span> flying in the sky. We’ll use the familiar setup of a camera kept steady relative the ground, as seen in the top part, and a camera that follows the <span><strong>airplane</strong></span>, seen in the bottom part:</p>


<p>Before we continue, notice that it’s getting a little hard to pay close attention to what happens to the moving objects in the ground-fixed camera view – the bodies quickly leave the field of view of the demonstrations. For the rest of this article I’ll stick to the camera style seen in the bottom part of the demonstration – this will let us directly track the interaction between the object and the air that flows around that object.</p>
<p>From the point of view of the <span><strong>airplane</strong></span>, it also experiences a flow of incoming air as seen by the air “boxes” approaching the <span><strong>plane</strong></span>, which is very similar to the car example. What’s completely different from the car example is the fact that the <span><strong>airplane</strong></span> somehow stays suspended in the air, despite gravity pulling it down towards the ground. This means that there must be some other force acting on it to prevent the plane from falling from the sky.</p>
<p>Let’s compare these two vehicles by looking at the basic forces affecting their motion, starting with the diagram of forces acting on the <span><strong>car</strong></span>:</p>


<p>The down-pulling <span><strong>gravity force</strong></span> is counteracted by the <span><strong>reaction forces</strong></span> from the ground – they act through the <span><strong>car’s</strong></span> tires to prevent the <span><strong>car</strong></span> from sinking. The air drag and other forms of resistance <span><strong>push</strong></span> the car back, but the <span><strong>car’s</strong></span> tires powered by the engine keep <span><strong>propelling</strong></span> the car forward.</p>
<p>In my previous article I presented a <a href="https://ciechanow.ski/bicycle/#forces">more elaborate description</a> of the interplay between forces and objects, but to briefly recap here, if forces acting on an object are balanced, then that object will maintain its current velocity.</p>
<p>All forces on the <span><strong>car</strong></span> <em>are</em> balanced and the <span><strong>vehicle</strong></span> moves forward with constant speed, and it doesn’t move at all in the up or down direction – the <span><strong>object’s</strong></span> velocity is indeed constant.</p>
<p>Let’s draw a similar diagram of forces for the flying <span><strong>plane</strong></span>:</p>


<p>We still have the <span><strong>air drag</strong></span> that pushes the <span><strong>vehicle</strong></span> back, and the <span><strong>plane’s</strong></span> propeller powered by the engine keeps  <span><strong>pushing</strong></span> it forward. As a result the <span><strong>plane</strong></span> moves forward with constant speed.</p>
<p>We also have the down-pulling <span><strong>gravity</strong></span>. This time, however, that <span><strong>gravity</strong></span> is not countered by the reaction forces from the ground, but instead it’s balanced by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lift_(force)"><em>lift</em></a>, a <span><strong>force</strong></span> that pushes the <span><strong>plane</strong></span> up. When <span><strong>gravity</strong></span> and <span><strong>lift</strong></span> are equalized, the plane doesn’t move up or down either.</p>
<p>Airplanes create most of their lift with wings, which are carefully designed to generate that force. While length, area, and the overall geometry of the wings are very important, in this article we’ll focus on the shape of the cross-section of a wing which I highlighted below in <span><strong>yellow</strong></span>:</p>

<p>This is an <span><strong>airfoil</strong></span>, the protagonist of this article. This <span><strong>airfoil</strong></span> has a smooth, rounded front and a sharp trailing edge. Let’s take a closer look at the flow of air around this <span><strong>airfoil</strong></span> using the grass-like arrows that show the velocity of air at that location:</p>


<p>These arrows paint an interesting picture, but in the demonstration below I’ve also added the little leaf-like <strong>markers</strong> that track the motion of air parcels in the flow. I&nbsp;steadily release a whole line of them from the left side, but you can also <span>click</span><span>tap</span> anywhere in the flow to drop a <strong>marker</strong> at that location. You can do this in any demonstration that has a little hand symbol in the bottom right corner:</p>

<p>The <strong>markers</strong> show that the flow splits ahead of the <span><strong>airfoil</strong></span>, then it gently changes direction to glide above and below the <span><strong>shape</strong></span>. Moreover, the <strong>markers</strong> right in front of the <span><strong>airfoil</strong></span> gradually slow down and lag behind their neighbors. The air somehow senses the presence of the body.</p>
<p>It may be hard to see, but the top and bottom sections of this <span><strong>airfoil</strong></span> aren’t symmetric. This asymmetric design is very important, but right now it will needlessly complicate our discussion on how the flow around this shape arises.</p>
<p>To simplify things a little, let’s use a less complicated shape of a <em>symmetric</em> <span><strong>airfoil</strong></span> – you can see it in the demonstration below. I overlay the previous asymmetric shape with a <span>dashed</span> outline to show the difference between the two:</p>

<p>The motion of air around this airfoil is very similar – the flow changes its direction and speed when it passes around an object. Until now we’ve simply been observing that the flow changes to adapt to the shape of the body, but it’s finally time to understand <em>why</em> it happens. To explain that behavior we need to go back to the world of air particles to discuss the concept of pressure.</p>
<h2 id="pressure">Pressure<a href="https://ciechanow.ski/airfoil/#pressure" arialabel="Anchor"><img src="https://ciechanow.ski/images/anchor.png" width="16px" height="8px"></a> </h2>
<p>As we’ve discussed, even in the seemingly steady conditions the particles of air are zipping around at high speeds colliding with each other at an incredible rate. The surface of any object placed in the air will also experience these bounces.</p>
<p>In the demonstration below, you can see air particles bombarding a <span><strong>small box</strong></span>. Every time a collision happens I briefly mark it with a <strong>dark spot</strong> on the surface of that <span><strong>cube</strong></span>:</p>


<p>To understand the implications of these collisions, let’s first take a look at objects with more ordinary sizes. In the demonstration below, <span><strong>tennis balls</strong></span> are hitting a large <span><strong>cardboard box</strong></span> from the left and right side. By dragging the slider you can change the <span><strong>intensity</strong></span> of both streams of balls:</p>


<p>When a <span><strong>tennis ball</strong></span> hits the <span><strong>box</strong></span>, the collision imparts some force on it, causing the <span><strong>box</strong></span> to move. However, in this simulation the collisions from all the <span><strong>balls</strong></span> on each side balance each other out, so the <span><strong>box</strong></span> doesn’t make any consistent progress in either direction.</p>
<p>In real air, the situation is similar, but at vastly different scales. The mass of each particle constituting air is absolutely miniscule, so the impact of an individual collision on any object of meaningful size is completely imperceptible.</p>
<p>Moreover, each air particle hitting an object has a different speed, and it strikes the surface of that object at a different angle – some hit the object straight on, but some barely graze it. Due to the enormous number of these collisions happening at every instant of time, all these variations average out, and even a small section of surface of any body experiences uniform bombardment.</p>
<p>In aggregate, we say that the air exerts <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"><em>pressure</em></a> on any object present in that air. The magnitude of this pressure depends on the intensity of these collisions across an area.</p>
<p>Let’s see how this pressure manifests on our <span><strong>tiny cube</strong></span>. In the demonstration below, you can use the second slider to control the <span><strong>number of air molecules</strong></span> present in this volume:</p>



<p>The <span><strong>black arrows</strong></span> you see on the sides of the cube symbolize the magnitude of pressure on these walls. As we <em>uniformly</em> increase the <span><strong>number of particles</strong></span> in this volume, the intensity of collisions, and thus the <span><strong>pressure</strong></span>, also increases. Because the collisions happen at more or less the same rate on every side of the <span><strong>box</strong></span>, the net balance of forces is also maintained and the <span><strong>cube</strong></span> doesn’t move, regardless of how big or small the overall <span><strong>pressure</strong></span> is.</p>
<p>This is exactly what happens in the Earth’s atmosphere – everything is constantly squeezed by relatively high pressure caused by the barrage of countless air particles. That pressure is typically balanced either by an object’s material, which resists compression like a spring, or by the air itself that fills the insides of the object. When that inner air is removed, the seemingly innocuous atmospheric pressure <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0N17tEW_WEU&amp;t=165s">reveals its might</a>.</p>
<p>The underlying particle nature also shows us that pressure is never negative. Without any particle collisions, we reach the lowest possible pressure of zero. Beyond that, any impacts on the surface of an object create some amount of positive pressure.</p>
<p>In the demonstrations we’ve seen so far, the <em>balanced</em> number of collisions on each wall was very important for keeping the objects steady. Unsurprisingly, more interesting things happen when this harmony isn’t maintained. Let’s first investigate this scenario using the <span><strong>tennis balls</strong></span>. In the demonstration below, the slider controls if it’s the <span><strong>left side or the right side</strong></span> that’s shooting more balls:</p>


<p>As you can see, if one of the sides has a <a href="#" onclick="balls2_f0();return false;">higher number of collisions</a>, the forces acting on the <span><strong>box</strong></span> are no longer balanced and the <span><strong>box</strong></span> starts to move.</p>
<p>The very same situation happens in air, which you can witness in the simulation below. Notice that the volume in which the <span><strong>tiny cube</strong></span> exists has more particles on one side than the other. Observe what happens to <span><strong>cube</strong></span> once you let <span><strong>the time run</strong></span> using the slider:</p>


<p>The higher number of particle collisions on one side of the <span><strong>cube</strong></span> creates higher <span><strong>pressure forces</strong></span> on that wall. The uneven forces end up pushing the <span><strong>block</strong></span> to the side. In this demonstration, the pressure re-balances after a while and the <span><strong>cube</strong></span> stops moving.</p>
<p>Intuitively, the air exerts an imbalanced net force on the <span><strong>cube</strong></span> only when different parts of that <span><strong>object</strong></span> experience different pressure – it’s the <em>spatial variation</em> in pressure that creates an acting net force. When the <em>difference</em> in pressure between any two points increases, the net force acting on the object also grows.</p>
<p>It’s easy to see that a larger number of collisions on the left side of an object would start to exert a net force pushing that object to the right, but, perhaps surprisingly, the same rules apply to any chunk of air itself.</p>
<p>In the demonstration below, I once again made one half of the test volume contain more particles than the other half. As you <span><strong>unpause</strong></span> the demonstration, observe the average velocity of molecules in the  <span><strong>marked out</strong></span> section of air:</p>



<p>The particles on the more occupied side can easily travel to the less crowded side, because there are fewer particles there to collide with and bounce back from. Additionally, each particle in the less populated section is more likely to hit a particle in the more populated section, which will typically cause that particle from the desolate side to bounce back where it came from.</p>
<p>The particles end up, on average, traveling from the area of high pressure to the area of lower pressure. Even though we don’t have any clean borders between different sections, we can still see the bulk of particles getting accelerated towards the less dense section.</p>
<p>Once again, the initial pressure differences in the test volume dissipate after a while. On their own, these freely suspended pressure variations quickly disappear, but we will soon see how, with the aid of airflow, these areas of different pressure can be sustained indefinitely.</p>
<p>In the examples we’ve been playing with, the notion of increased pressure came from an increased number of collisions, which in turn came from an increased number of particles in the area. This shows that, all other things being equal, pressure is tied to the local density of the air, which was very easy to perceive in an increased concentration of molecules.</p>
<p>However, the pressure can also grow due to increased average speed of the particles, which in turn comes with increased temperature. As particles get faster, each collision gets more impactful and it pushes on an object or other particles a bit harder, causing the overall pressure to also increase. In the demonstration below, we can simulate this with <span><strong>tennis balls</strong></span> hitting the <span><strong>cardboard box</strong></span> at the same rate, but with <span><strong>different speeds</strong></span>, which you can control with the slider:</p>


<p>As we make the <span><strong>balls</strong></span> on one side of the <span><strong>box</strong></span> <a href="#" onclick="balls3_f0();return false;">faster</a>, their impacts also become stronger and the <span><strong>package</strong></span> starts moving to the right, even though the <em>number</em> of collisions per second is equal on both sides.</p>
<p>The important point from these discussions is that air pressure exerts force on everything inside it, be it a solid object or any parcel of air. It’s a little unintuitive that the air itself both exerts the pressure and it also “feels” the pressure, but it’s all just a consequence of very rapid motions of particles and the collisions between them happening at an enormous rate.</p>
<p>Recall that even in small volumes of air there are billions of billions of particles, and each particle experiences roughly ten billion collisions per second. What we’ve simulated at a micro scale and in slow motion as countable, individual interactions, very quickly smooths out into a uniform and uninterrupted notion of force-exerting pressure.</p>
<p>This fact lets us abandon the molecules and their collisions yet again. It’s not a big loss, since counting the number and intensity of collisions was never convenient in the first place, but we can now investigate some other ways of visualizing pressure in a region of air.</p>
<h2 id="visualizing-pressure">Visualizing Pressure<a href="https://ciechanow.ski/airfoil/#visualizing-pressure" arialabel="Anchor"><img src="https://ciechanow.ski/images/anchor.png" width="16px" height="8px"></a> </h2>
<p>As we’ve seen in the particle simulations, pressure can vary from place to place. One of the most convenient ways to express this variation is to use colors of different intensities. Let’s see how that simple approach could work here. In the demonstration below, the dashed circles represent regions of high <span></span> and low <span></span> pressure – you can drag them around to change their position:</p>

<p>This map of pressure is colored with <strong><span data-color0="E3BFBB" data-color1="E5432E">varying shades of red</span></strong> as indicated by the scale below – the <span><strong>redder</strong></span> the color, the <span><strong>higher</strong></span> the pressure. The small triangle <span>▼</span> in the middle of the scale indicates the location of the  base, <em>static</em> pressure present in the atmosphere.</p>
<p>In this simulation we have complete control over where the different locations of <span><strong>lower</strong></span>  and <span><strong>higher</strong></span> pressure are. To make things more interesting, each draggable pressure circle has a different strength and range. You can infer this variation from color changes around these points.</p>
<p>Let’s put an <span><strong>airfoil</strong></span> in this area to see how it’s affected by the pressure of the surrounding air. The <span><strong>arrows</strong></span> seen below symbolize the force that pressure exerts on the surface of the <span><strong>airfoil</strong></span> at that location. They’re the exact same <span><strong>arrows</strong></span> that we’ve seen acting on the walls of the tiny yellow cube, here we just see them at a larger scale:</p>

<p>As you move around the locations of <span><strong>lower</strong></span>  and <span><strong>higher</strong></span> pressure, the <span><strong>forces</strong></span> acting on the surface of the <span><strong>airfoil</strong></span> also change, matching what we’ve seen with little cubes bombarded by air particles. The static pressure always exerts some base load, but in the areas of <span><strong>higher</strong></span> pressure the <span><strong>surface forces</strong></span> are higher, and in the areas of <span><strong>lower</strong></span> pressure the <span><strong>surface forces</strong></span> are lower than these base forces.</p>
<p>Note that you can also move the pressure circles into the <span><strong>airfoil</strong></span>, but it only serves as a convenience to let you customize the shape of the air pressure field <em>around</em> that body – we don’t particularly care about the pressure inside the solid itself.</p>
<p>When we tally up all the <span><strong>pressure forces</strong></span> acting on each piece of the <span><strong>airfoil’s</strong></span> surface, we end up with the <span><strong>net force</strong></span> acting on that object. In the demonstration below, I’m showing it with the <span><strong>big arrow</strong></span> at the center of the <span><strong>airfoil</strong></span>:</p>

<p>By changing the distribution of pressure around the <span><strong>airfoil</strong></span>, we can affect the <span><strong>total force</strong></span> that this object feels.</p>
<p>The reddish plots we’ve been looking at are correct, but a little inconvenient. Recall that <span><strong>final net force</strong></span> on the object depends only on the <em>differences</em> of pressure – when we uniformly increased the number of collisions on the walls of the tiny cube, it steadily remained in place.</p>
<p>This means that the static background pressure doesn’t matter for the <span><strong>cumulative forces</strong></span> acting on an object. It’s only the differences relative to that static pressure that affect the overall balance. This lets us overhaul our visual representation of pressure – we can use no color where the pressure has the static value, use <span><strong>blue color</strong></span> when the pressure is <span><strong>lower</strong></span> than the static pressure, and use <span><strong>red color</strong></span> when the pressure is <span><strong>higher</strong></span> than the static pressure:</p>

<p>This is the <em>exact</em> same distribution of pressure that we’ve just seen. All the pressure demos in this section are connected, and here we simply changed the reference point against which we present the pressure variation.</p>
<p>If we then throw in the <span><strong>airfoil</strong></span> back into the mix we can now also adjust the <span><strong>arrows</strong></span> representing the <span><strong>forces</strong></span> that the pressure exerts on the surface of that <span><strong>object</strong></span>:</p>

<p>The areas of <span><strong>higher</strong></span> pressure still seem to push on the surface of the <span><strong>airfoil</strong></span>, but the areas of <span><strong>lower</strong></span> pressure now seem to <em>pull</em> it. However, I need to emphasize once more that pressure <em>always</em> pushes on the object, and we can only talk about a pulling force when we discard that uniform, pushing contribution coming from the static pressure. In those “pulling” areas the pressure is still pushing, it just pushes less intensely.</p>
<p>I will also use the convenient terms of <span><strong>positive</strong></span> and <span><strong>negative</strong></span> pressure, but remember that this refers to their difference from the static pressure. The phrase “pressure lower than static pressure” is a mouthful, so the expression “negative pressure” is very handy, even when it hides the fact that pressure is always positive.</p>
<p>While the color variations used here show the true nature of the smoothly varying pressure changes, they make it a little hard to see how quickly those changes happen. To fix this, I’ll also draw the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contour_line"><em>contour lines</em></a> that join the locations of the same pressure – they’re very similar to lines of the same altitude you may have seen on maps:</p>

<p>Every point on one of those contour lines has the same value of pressure, and each subsequent line is drawn at the same increment of pressure – you can see this in the scale placed below the plot. This means that the closer the lines are together, the more quickly the pressure changes in that area.</p>
<p>The mathematical concept that describes the direction and rapidness of these changes is known as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient"><em>gradient</em></a>. Informally, gradient describes how some property changes from one point to another, and, thankfully, this notion tracks closely with how this word is used in graphic design to describe smooth color changes. Wherever you see a <strong><span data-color0="3F90CD" data-color1="dddddd" data-color2="E5432E"> color gradient</span></strong> , this also implies that there is a <strong><span data-color0="3F90CD" data-color1="dddddd" data-color2="E5432E">pressure gradient</span></strong>  – the pressure changes from place to place.</p>
<p>This spatial variation is particularly important for the motion of air. Recall that the air pressure differences don’t just exert forces on solid objects, but also on the air itself – any small parcel of air is subject to the same whims of pressure forces.</p>
<p>Those spatial variations in pressure end up pushing the air around, changing its velocity. Let’s see this in action using the little leaf-like <strong>markers</strong> that are moved around by pressure differences. In the demonstration below, I’m steadily releasing the <strong>markers</strong> from the left side –&nbsp;notice how their trajectory changes when you modify the pressure field:</p>


<p>You may still find it a little difficult to grasp how pressure differences affect the motion of a parcel of air. Luckily, we can draw parallels between the contour lines of pressure seen on these pressure maps and the contour lines of elevation seen on traditional maps. This lets us build a little pressure-landscape analogy.</p>
<p>In the demonstration below, the very same distribution of pressure is expressed as a mountainy landscape. <span><strong>Positive</strong></span> pressure lifts the ground above the base level and <span><strong>negative</strong></span> pressure depresses it below the base level. A parcel of air moves like a marble that loses speed when climbing uphill and accelerates when rolling downhill. You can drag the demo around to change the viewing angle:</p>


<p>Notice that when the pressure changes more rapidly and the contour lines are closer, the steepness of the corresponding hill or valley also increases, and so do the forces acting on a parcel of air. If the pressure is increasing by a large amount, it may even make the <strong>marker</strong> go back. This landscape analogy also shows that the static pressure doesn’t matter for the motion of air parcels, as any changes in static pressure would just lift all the areas by the same amount without changing their steepness.</p>
<p>When watching these air parcels move around, you may have noticed that things were a little bit off. For example, it’s possible for air parcels coming from different directions to arrive at the same location, and then continue to travel in different directions. You can see an example of that on the left side of the demonstration below, with the slider letting you <span><strong>scrub back and forth in time</strong></span>:</p>


<p>Recall that the markers always follow the local velocity of air, so the motion seen in the left part implies that the air at the <a href="#" onclick="parcels_crossing_f0();return false;">location of the meetup</a> of the <span><strong>two</strong></span> <span><strong>markers</strong></span>  has two different velocities at the same time, which is not realistic.</p>
<p>It’s worth pointing out that the situation seen on right side, where <span><strong>one marker</strong></span> merely <a href="#" onclick="parcels_crossing_f1();return false;">intersects</a> the <strong><span data-color0="F0D9C0" data-color1="E09F56">historical path</span></strong> of the <span><strong>other</strong></span>, <em>can</em> be realistic, as long as we’re dealing with an unsteady flow, where the <span><strong>velocity</strong></span> of the air at the crossing location has changed since the <span><strong>first marker</strong></span> was there. For steady conditions in which no changes occur over time, the scenario seen on the right is also not physically correct.</p>
<p>We’ll look at some unsteady flows later in the article, but for now we’re interested in steady conditions so the crossing paths of our <strong>markers</strong> indicate implausible velocities. Even more dubious result happen when we simulate the motion of these <strong>markers</strong> with an <span><strong>airfoil</strong></span> present in the flow:</p>


<p>For most distributions of pressure, the air markers will flow right through the <span><strong>body</strong></span>. This is clearly wrong! The demonstrations we’ve seen so far correctly represent what would happen to individual air parcels and bodies placed in these pressure fields, but those pressure fields themselves were completely made up and didn’t correspond to any physical reality. Our mistake was that we completely ignored any interactions between the pressure of the air and the <em>motion</em> of that air.</p>
<p>The flow of air, the pressure of air, and the shape of the objects placed in that air are all tied together – for a given incoming flow speed and the shape of the object, we can’t just arbitrarily arrange the pressure field like we did in our artificial demonstrations. Instead, that pressure field will arise on its own.</p>
<p>Let’s see a <em>real</em> distribution of pressure around this airfoil and witness how it affects the motion of air parcels around it:</p>

<p>The behavior of air parcels now matches our intuitive expectations – the <strong>markers</strong> don’t go through the body, and in these steady conditions they also don’t cross paths.</p>
<p>We’re now one step closer to understanding how the flow of air takes its shape to move around an <span><strong>airfoil</strong></span> – it’s the pressure differences that cause the flow to change its direction and speed.</p>
<p>The pressure field we’ve just seen clearly works – regions of <span><strong>lower</strong></span> and <span><strong>higher</strong></span> pressure guide the air around the airfoil. However, it’s still unclear how these areas emerged in the first place. Let’s try to follow nature’s path to see how this pressure distribution is created and sustained in a flow.</p>
<h2 id="airfoil-flow">Airfoil Flow<a href="https://ciechanow.ski/airfoil/#airfoil-flow" arialabel="Anchor"><img src="https://ciechanow.ski/images/anchor.png" width="16px" height="8px"></a> </h2>
<p>Before we start building the correct pressure field from scratch, let’s first establish two guiding principles that the flow around any object has to follow.</p>
<p>Firstly, the air can’t penetrate solid walls. A valid pressure field should either completely stop the flow at the surface of the object, or redirect that flow to make it travel in the direction perpendicular to the walls. This means that the markers that we track can never get inside the object.</p>
<p>Secondly, we also have the restrictions on the relative motion of the markers. For now we’ll only be interested in steady conditions, which means that the markers can’t cross their paths – we expect the ghostly historical trails to never intersect.</p>
<p>Let’s first focus on the pressure field in front of the airfoil. In the demonstration below, I created an <em>artificial</em> pressure field in that frontal region, you can control it using the slider:</p>


<p>It should quickly become clear that to prevent the approaching air from getting into the object, the pressure in the frontal region has to be <span><strong>positive</strong></span>, so that it pushes the incoming air away.</p>
<p>If that <span><strong>positive pressure</strong></span> in front is <a href="#" onclick="symmetric_airfoil_fvm4_f0();return false;">too low</a> the air can still erroneously flow through the object. If that pressure is <a href="#" onclick="symmetric_airfoil_fvm4_f1();return false;">too high</a>, the air parcels arriving at the airfoil will turn back and incorrectly cross paths with the incoming air. When the pressure is <a href="#" onclick="symmetric_airfoil_fvm4_f2();return false;">just right</a>, the air parcels don’t go through the wall, and, at least in front of the object, they also don’t cross their paths.</p>
<p>The faster the incoming flow, the higher the pushing force required to slow down and redirect the incoming air. In the demonstration below, you can also control the <span><strong>speed</strong></span> of that incoming air using the second slider:</p>



<p>While for <a href="#" onclick="symmetric_airfoil_fvm5_f0();return false;">slow flows</a>, only a small amount of <span><strong>positive pressure</strong></span>  is <a href="#" onclick="symmetric_airfoil_fvm5_f1();return false;">enough</a> to stop the incoming air, for <a href="#" onclick="symmetric_airfoil_fvm5_f2();return false;">fast flows</a>, the pressure in front of the airfoil has to become <a href="#" onclick="symmetric_airfoil_fvm5_f3();return false;">much higher</a>.</p>
<p>The pressure needed to stop air at a given velocity is known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stagnation_pressure"><em>stagnation pressure</em></a> and it’s proportional to the <em>square</em> of that velocity – twice as high speed requires four times larger pressure.  Naturally, when there is <a href="#" onclick="symmetric_airfoil_fvm5_f4();return false;">no flow</a>, no pressure is required as the air no longer tries to flow through the object.</p>
<p>In the previous two demonstrations, we manually adjusted the pressure to get the correct result, but in nature this process happens on its own – it’s the flow <em>itself</em> that creates this region of increased pressure in front of the object.</p>
<p>As the incoming parcels of air arrive at the surface of the airfoil, they can’t continue going forward, but air parcels from further up ahead continuously want to keep flowing into this region. This compresses the air close to the object, which causes the pressure in front to increase, which then helps to slow down the incoming flow.</p>
<p>This mechanism is self-balancing – if the pressure is too low to push away the incoming air parcels, the air parcels will compact the existing air more, causing an increase in pressure. If the pressure is too high, it will easily push the incoming air away, which relieves the frontal area, causing the pressure to decrease. Any fluctuations quickly settle to an equilibrium that balances the pressure in the entire frontal region.</p>
<p>Let’s look at the distribution of the <span><strong>positive</strong></span> frontal pressure once more:</p>

<p>Notice that the <span><strong>positive pressure</strong></span> isn’t limited to just the close vicinity of the airfoil, but it spreads out much further ahead to gradually reach the value of the static pressure, far away from the airfoil itself.</p>
<p>All in all, we have a large area of increasing pressure that starts far away from the body and ends at its surface. Those pressure differences create a pressure “hill” that not only gradually slows the incoming air down, but it also redirects that air to flow around the object.</p>
<p>It seems that with our frontal pressure field we’ve easily completed our goal of preventing the air from flowing through the walls of the body. However, our second guideline of non-crossing marker paths is still not fulfilled – this condition is broken above and below the airfoil.</p>
<p>Let’s first try to rectify this manually. In the demonstration below, you can control the pressure in these two regions using the slider:</p>


<p>While <span><strong>positive</strong></span> values of pressure in those zones make the <a href="#" onclick="symmetric_airfoil_fvm6_f0();return false;">problem worse</a>, <span><strong>negative</strong></span> values get us <a href="#" onclick="symmetric_airfoil_fvm6_f1();return false;">much closer</a> to the expected behavior – in the top and bottom areas the <strong>markers</strong> no longer veer off into different directions. However, that pressure can’t be <a href="#" onclick="symmetric_airfoil_fvm6_f2();return false;"><em>too</em> low</a>, otherwise it will pull the <strong>markers</strong> back into the body.</p>
<p>In real flow, these regions of <span><strong>lower</strong></span> pressure arise on their own, but the explanation for this phenomenon is a little less straightforward than what I’ve described for the area of <span><strong>positive</strong></span> pressure in the frontal region. We can get <em>some</em>, albeit a bit hand-wavy,  understanding by observing what happens to the air <strong>markers</strong> when those <span><strong>negative</strong></span> regions are <a href="#" onclick="symmetric_airfoil_fvm6_f3();return false;">missing</a>.</p>
<p>In that scenario, the incoming air parcels no longer reach those areas above and below the airfoil, causing some local depletion of air that has since left those zones. This decreases the pressure in those regions, and that lower pressure attracts the surrounding air to flow into those less occupied spaces.</p>
<p>If that lower pressure is <em>too</em> negative, more air will come in and the pressure will rise. If the pressure is not negative enough, those region will get depleted again. Once again, it’s the flow itself that creates the balancing system – without the flow no pressure differences would arise.</p>
<p>As we’ll see later on, in more extreme scenarios that negative pressure can alter the flow more dramatically, and the regions of “missing” air get filled through other means, but for now let’s close things up by tweaking the pressure in the rear part of the airfoil:</p>


<p>Some amount of <span><strong>positive</strong></span> pressure in the rear <a href="#" onclick="symmetric_airfoil_fvm7_f0();return false;">prevents</a> the air parcels from smashing into each other after leaving the airfoil. Intuitively, this pressure arises naturally from the flow, because as the air slides off from the ends of the top and bottom sides, it all arrives into the same region, creating some compression.</p>
<p>If that compressive pressure in the rear is too low, more air will manage to get in, which will further increase the pressure. If that pressure is too high, it will push the incoming air away, which depletes the area and the pressure decreases. The system balances itself yet again.</p>
<p>The quite informal description of these balances that I’ve presented can be formalized mathematically using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navier%E2%80%93Stokes_equations"><em>Navier–Stokes equations</em></a>. These equations describe the motion of liquids and gasses, collectively known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid"><em>fluids</em></a>, subject to various forces like gravity, or, most importantly for us, pressure.</p>
<p>Navier–Stokes equations are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navier%E2%80%93Stokes_existence_and_smoothness"><em>notoriously difficult</em></a> to solve analytically, but a lot of insight about the behavior of fluids can be gained with computer simulations with various degrees of complexity.</p>
<p>In this article, I’m also employing simulations to investigate the flow of air around objects. However, the computer models used here are quite simplified and they don’t reflect the <em>full</em> richness of physics involved in the motion of air. These <em>slow-motion</em> demonstrations are intended to present the broad strokes of the delicate interaction between the air and the airfoil, but I would advise against relying on them when building an airworthy airplane.</p>
<p>With all of these caveats in place, let’s get back to the pressure distribution around a symmetric airfoil. We’re done recreating the nature-made pressure field, but there is one small aspect that we haven’t yet accounted for.</p>
<p>For our experiments, I kept the pressure steady in time so that we could focus on its general outlines. In practice, a pressure field imposed by a fast flow around any object will experience some degree of instability, which you can see in the demonstration below. You can once more drop the markers at any location to track the flow in the area:</p>

<p>As the pressure builds up on one side, it redirects the flow, which changes the pressure again. The pressure ends up oscillating back and forth like a swing. The pressure distribution and the flow direction are once again at the mercy of their mutual balance, one affecting the other. We’ll soon see some other examples of these unstable behaviors.</p>
<p>As we’ve just seen, the variation in pressure doesn’t just happen in the close vicinity of the airfoil, but it stretches quite far away from the body itself. This means that the velocity of the flow is also affected quite far away from the shape.</p>
<p>However, when it comes to the forces exerted on the airfoil, it’s only the pressure right at the surface of the airfoil that matters. Let’s bring back the two tools we’ve used before: <span><strong>surface arrows</strong></span> that show how the air pushes or “pulls” on the airfoil, and the <span><strong>net force</strong></span> arrow that tallies up the net results of <span><strong>these forces</strong></span>:</p>

<p>As the pressure field fluctuates, the resulting <span><strong>net force</strong></span> also moves around. Let’s decompose this force into two different components, one  <span><strong>perpendicular</strong></span> to the flow, and one <span><strong>parallel</strong></span> to it:</p>

<p>The force acting in the direction perpendicular to the flow is known as <span><strong>lift</strong></span>, and the one acting in the direction of the flow is known as <span><strong>pressure drag</strong></span>, or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasitic_drag#Form_drag"><em>form drag</em></a>. As the name implies, this component of drag is created by the distribution of pressure around the shape.</p>
<p>For this airfoil, the <span><strong>pressure drag</strong></span> is very tiny. While airfoils are specifically designed to minimize the overall drag, most of that force hindering their motion comes from another source – we’ll discuss it soon enough.</p>
<p>Notice that as this flow fluctuates, the <span><strong>lift</strong></span> force jumps around, but averaged over time the upward and downward swings of that <span><strong>force</strong></span> end up balancing each other. This airfoil in <em>this</em> configuration doesn’t generate any continuous lift.</p>
<p>This shouldn’t come as a surprise since this situation is completely symmetric, so the pressure forces on the upper and lower sides of the airfoil are, on average, completely balanced. However, there is an easy way to disturb that symmetry. In the demonstration below, we’re once again meeting the plain, symmetric airfoil, but this time we can gently <span><strong>tilt</strong></span> it using the slider:</p>


<p>The <span><strong>slider</strong></span> controls the so-called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle_of_attack"><em>angle of attack</em></a>, which is spanned between some reference line on the body, like the one joining the front and back, and the direction of the incoming flow. I’m showing this angle right in the middle of the airfoil.</p>
<p>As we <a href="#" onclick="symmetric_airfoil_fvm20_f0();return false;">change</a> the <span><strong>angle of attack</strong></span>, the shape that the airflow “sees” is no longer symmetrical relative to the incoming direction of that flow. The velocity and pressure fields adapt in their mutual push and pull to form a new, asymmetric distribution. Notice that the stagnation point of <span><strong>high pressure</strong></span> has moved around, and the little markers that indicate the motion of air now travel on very different paths below and above and below the airfoil.</p>
<p>If we then put the <span><strong>pressure arrows</strong></span> back in, we can tally them all up to get the resulting <span><strong>lift</strong></span> and <span><strong>pressure drag</strong></span>. When compared to the previous simulation, I’m scaling down all the arrows to make them fit in the bounds of the demonstration:</p>


<p>When this symmetric airfoil is <a href="#" onclick="symmetric_airfoil_fvm21_f0();return false;">tilted up</a>, the asymmetric pressure distribution generates a <span><strong>lift force</strong></span> that pushes the object up. Conversely, for a <a href="#" onclick="symmetric_airfoil_fvm21_f1();return false;">downward tilted airfoil</a>, the pressure forces <span><strong>push</strong></span> the airfoil down.</p>
<p>Naturally, we’re typically interested in upward-pointing forces, and when the <span><strong>lift</strong></span> generated by the wings is equal to the weight of the plane, the plane will stay in the air without raising or falling to the ground – we’re finally flying.</p>
<p>Let’s plot the dependence between the <span><strong>lifting force</strong></span> and the <span><strong>angle of attack</strong></span> of an airfoil – you can see it in the right side of the demonstration below. Note that this plot presents time-averaged and <em>settled</em> values, so you may have to wait a little for the flow to normalize and the <span><strong>lift</strong></span> to start oscillating around the expected value:</p>


<p>Clearly, as the <span><strong>angle of attack</strong></span> increases, so does the generated <span><strong>lift</strong></span>. The same thing happens on the other end of the spectrum, where a more negative  <span><strong>angle of attack</strong></span> creates more negative lift. Note that for this symmetric airfoil the positive and negative sides of the diagram are just mirror images of each other, so let’s focus only on positive  <span><strong>angles of attack</strong></span>.</p>
<p>One could naively hope that we could keep increasing the  <span><strong>angle of attack</strong></span> to generate more and more <span><strong>lift</strong></span>. Let’s see what happens in practice:</p>


<p>Initially, the <span><strong>lift</strong></span> force indeed keeps increasing with the <span><strong>angle of attack</strong></span>, but at some point <a href="#" onclick="symmetric_airfoil_fvm23_f0();return false;">it plateaus</a>. Once that <em>critical</em> angle of attack is surpassed, the <span><strong>lift</strong></span> force <a href="#" onclick="symmetric_airfoil_fvm23_f1();return false;">starts to fall</a> after the flow <a href="#" onclick="symmetric_airfoil_fvm23_f2();return false;">fully develops</a>.</p>
<p>What we’re witnessing here is known as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stall_(fluid_dynamics)"><em>stall</em></a>. The onset of a stall imposes limits on how much <span><strong>lift</strong></span> the wings of an airplane can generate from merely increasing the angle of attack.</p>
<p>Notice that when the stall happens, the pressure distribution on the upper part of the airfoil becomes very erratic – it’s not only the surface <span><strong>pressure arrows</strong></span> that are changing rapidly, but the whole pressure field in that area is very disturbed.</p>
<p>Let’s bring in the velocity arrows and markers to get a better feel on what’s going on in that region:</p>


<p>At high angles of attack, the flow above the upper part of the airfoil becomes very complicated. If you <span>click</span><span>tap</span> in that region to drop a few markers, you’ll notice that the air is trapped in various swirling eddies that are eventually shed to fly away with rest of the flow.</p>
<p>We’re witnessing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_separation"><em>flow separation</em></a>, where the main part of the flow detaches from the surface and doesn’t follow its shape anymore. The interactions in the complicated flow right above the airfoil affect the pressure field, which then <em>decreases</em> <span><strong>lift</strong></span>.</p>
<p>There is a lot going on there, but to understand how these effects arise we have to talk about a property that affects the flow of every fluid: viscosity.</p>
<h2 id="viscosity">Viscosity<a href="https://ciechanow.ski/airfoil/#viscosity" arialabel="Anchor"><img src="https://ciechanow.ski/images/anchor.png" width="16px" height="8px"></a> </h2>
<p>You might have heard the term <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viscosity"><em>viscosity</em></a> used to describe “thickness” of different liquids, with a classic example that contrasts the slowness of the flow of honey to the rapidness of the flow of water.</p>
<p>Viscosity is also a property of gasses like air, but before I describe this concept more formally, we’ll first build an intuitive understanding of what viscosity is and what it does to the flow of different fluids.</p>
<p>In the demonstration below, the fluid flows in from the left side, but note that the flow in the top half is faster than the flow in the bottom half, which is reflected by the different lengths of the arrows. Dragging the slider to the left decreases the <span><strong>viscosity</strong></span> of the fluid, and dragging the slider to the right increases <span><strong>viscosity</strong></span>:</p>


<p>While we can see some changes to the arrows as we move the slider around, you probably agree that, for this flow, the arrow-based visualization isn’t very rewarding. Let’s add the color-based <strong><span>visualization of speed</span></strong> distribution in this flow:</p>


<p>We can now see how <span><strong>viscosity</strong></span> blends the speed variation between different sections of the fluid. For highly <a href="#" onclick="fdm2_f0();return false;">viscous fluids</a>, this mixing behavior spreads very easily and the initially distinct velocities of the two layers average out quite rapidly.</p>
<p>At <a href="#" onclick="fdm2_f1();return false;">lower viscosity</a> these two layers with different speeds remain quite separated. If you make the viscosity <a href="#" onclick="fdm2_f2();return false;">low enough</a>, you may even notice that, after a while, the flow develops some interesting wave-like phenomena – we’ll get back to these soon.</p>
<p>All this mixing behavior may remind you of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion"><em>diffusion</em></a> process, where some quantity, like temperature or concentration, evens out over time. Let’s see some basic diffusion in action. In the simulation below, I filled half of the bottle with with <span><strong>red-dyed water</strong></span>, while the other half is filled with <span><strong>blue-dyed water</strong></span>. The slider lets you control the <span><strong>speed of time</strong></span>:</p>


<p>As <a href="#" onclick="bottle_f0();return false;">time passes</a>, the sharp difference between the two layer blends more and more to eventually completely disappear. Clearly, there is some similarity between the diffusion of differently <span><strong>colored</strong></span> <span><strong>dyes</strong></span> and the averaging of velocity that we’ve seen in the earlier example.</p>
<p>In our flow demonstrations, <span><strong>viscosity</strong></span> seemed to have controlled the diffusion of velocity. To define it more precisely, <span><strong>viscosity</strong></span> controls the diffusion of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Momentum"><em>momentum</em></a>, which is a product of velocity <em>and</em> mass. The simplified fluids we’re looking at have more or less constant density, so each equally-sized parcel of those fluids has the same mass. Therefore, if it makes things easier for you, wherever you see the word momentum you can think of velocity, but in more complex scenarios these differences can matter.</p>
<p>Let me bring in the previous flow simulation one more time:</p>


<p>You’ve probably noticed that, as the flow moves to the right, the size of this blended region increases. When the regions of fluid with different momentums meet for the first time, they barely have any time to average out, and the blending is minimal. As time passes, these regions of fluid get to average out more, similarly to how two different layers of dyed water mix more over time.</p>
<p>However, as time is passing, these parcels also <em>keep moving</em>, and that stronger blending happens further to the right. The downstream regions had more time to mix and average out, so the visible thickness of the blended region on the right side is also larger.</p>
<p>With higher <span><strong>viscosity</strong></span>, the size of blended region grows much more quickly, which lets us be more precise about our working definition – <span><strong>viscosity</strong></span> controls the <em>rate</em> of the diffusion of momentum.</p>
<p>So far we’ve only observed flows with nicely separated horizontal layers, but <span><strong>viscosity</strong></span> averages momentum between <em>any</em> two regions of fluids. In the demonstration below, you can witness how <span><strong>viscosity</strong></span> affects a swirly motion of fluid in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vortex"><em>vortex</em></a>:</p>


<p>Notice that with <a href="#" onclick="fdm4_f0();return false;">high viscosity</a> any differences in velocity are very quickly diluted out into nothing, but with <a href="#" onclick="fdm4_f1();return false;">low viscosity</a> the revolving motion can survive for quite a while.</p>
<p><span><strong>Viscosity</strong></span> has a damping or smoothing effect that makes it much harder to sustain any large variation in a velocity field. Let’s see how this affects the motion of objects in fluids of various viscosity. In the demonstration below, we’re tracking a velocity field close to a very <span><strong>thin plate</strong></span> put directly in the stream of an incoming fluid of adjustable <span><strong>viscosity</strong></span>:</p>


<p>With <a href="#" onclick="fdm5_f0();return false;">high viscosity</a>, there is a large region of slow down around the <span><strong>plate</strong></span> that regains its speed fairly quickly behind the object. At <a href="#" onclick="fdm5_f1();return false;">lower viscosity</a> that surrounding region is much smaller, but it extends much further behind the <span><strong>plate</strong></span>. For <a href="#" onclick="fdm5_f2();return false;">very low viscosity</a> we’re once again seeing some more unusual behavior that we’ll get back to in a minute.</p>
<p>From the dark colors we can easily see that right by the surface of the <span><strong>plate</strong></span> the fluid doesn’t move at all – it sticks to that surface. This velocity difference between the halted flow at the wall and the moving outer flow gets smoothed out over time by <span><strong>viscosity</strong></span>, similar to how it blended in the flow between two different layers of fluid.</p>
<p>As before, with higher <span><strong>viscosity</strong></span>, the velocity averaging process becomes more rapid, and the blended region becomes more widespread. This averaging effect doesn’t just alter the velocity of fluid, but it also affects the plate. In some sense, the <span><strong>viscosity</strong></span> also wants to make the velocity of the surface of the <span><strong>plate</strong></span> to be more like the velocity of the surrounding flow.</p>
<p>The viscosity makes the flow want to pull the <span><strong>plate</strong></span> with it, which creates a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shear_force"><em>shearing force</em></a> that tries to slide the surface of this object away. The net effect is that that viscosity creates additional drag known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin_friction_drag"><em>skin friction drag</em></a> that wants to slow down any object moving in it.</p>
<p>All of these effects underline why highly viscous fluids are “thick”. Viscosity not only quickly averages any local differences in velocity, which prevents those fluids from flowing easily, but it also represses motion of objects in those fluids – you’ve likely experienced the difficulty of moving a spoon through a jar of honey.</p>
<p>The flow of any fluid exhibits tiny, random disturbances. In fluids with high viscosity, these variations are very quickly dispersed, so their motion is rarely erratic. Fluids with low viscosity aren’t as effective at damping motion, and these disturbances can grow to create oscillatory patterns. We’ve seen glimpses of them in the previous simulations, but here is another example:</p>


<p>At lower viscosity the flow becomes <a href="#" onclick="fdm10_f0();return false;">quite wave-y</a>. Those <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelvin%E2%80%93Helmholtz_instability"><em>instabilities</em></a> happen at the border of regions of fluid with different velocities, like where the slow wake behind a plate is in contact with the fast external flow. In those regions, any tiny random intrusion of slower flow into the faster flow can get magnified and rolled over like a wave.</p>
<p>In our discussion of the motion of air around an airfoil, we’ve seen how the flow, the pressure field, and the shape of the body have effects on each other. These influences can be quite dynamic in nature, with distributions of velocity and pressure swinging back and forth in a never-ending fight for dominance.</p>
<p>In the demonstration below, we can see a more dramatic example of these battles, where, depending on the <span><strong>viscosity</strong></span>, the flow around a <span><strong>gray cube</strong></span> can take many different forms:</p>


<p>With very <a href="#" onclick="fdm9_f0();return false;">high viscosity</a>, the flow is completely stable, but as <a href="#" onclick="fdm9_f1();return false;">viscosity decreases</a>, it starts to regularly oscillate from side to side, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vortex_shedding"><em>shedding vortices</em></a> in the process. At <a href="#" onclick="fdm9_f2();return false;">very low viscosity</a>, the motion becomes even more erratic.</p>
<p>While I can’t easily simulate it here, with further decrease in viscosity, the flow <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8zKWaxohng">can develop</a> full featured <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbulence"><em>turbulence</em></a> in which highly irregular and chaotic mixing motions occur at different scales. Turbulent flow stands in contrast to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laminar_flow"><em>laminar flow</em></a>, in which neighboring areas of fluid move in an orderly way past each other without any varying fluctuations.</p>
<p>Although we’ve put most of our focus on <span><strong>viscosity</strong></span>, which is often denoted with the Greek letter <strong>μ</strong>, the general behavior of the flow also depends on its velocity <strong>u</strong>, density <strong>ρ</strong>, and the size <strong>L</strong> of the body or container involved in the flow. These parameters are tied together by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reynolds_number"><em>Reynolds number</em></a> <strong>Re</strong>:</p>
<p>
Re = <span>
    <span>ρ · u · L</span>
    <span>/</span>
    <span>μ</span> 
</span>
</p>
<p>Flows with the same Reynolds numbers exhibit similar behavior, which means that if we make the obstacle size <strong>L</strong> twice as large and we halve the speed of the flow <strong>u</strong>, the Reynolds number won’t change and neither will the characteristics of the flow – it will exhibit the same smooth or oscillatory motion.</p>
<p>The Reynolds number also “predicts” the onset of turbulence. When we increase the speed of the flow <strong>u</strong>, or decrease the viscosity <strong>μ</strong>, the Reynolds number rises. When it reaches a high enough value, turbulence is likely to occur.</p>
<p>Let’s quantify the difference in viscosity between different fluids. The precise values aren’t that important to us, but to briefly be a bit more formal, viscosity is expressed in units of pascal-seconds, or <strong>Pa·s</strong>. To let us use more manageable numbers, the following table uses millipascal-seconds, or <strong>mPa·s</strong>:</p>
<table>
<tbody><tr><td>honey</td><td>~10000 <span>mPa·s</span></td></tr>
<tr><td>olive oil</td><td>~100 <span>mPa·s</span></td></tr>
<tr><td>water</td><td>1.0 <span>mPa·s</span></td></tr>
<tr><td>air</td><td>0.018 <span>mPa·s</span></td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>These values are measured at <span>68 °F</span><span>20 °C</span>, but many fluids like oil get much less viscous with increased temperature. As expected, honey is significantly more viscous than water. Compared to water, the viscosity of air is around 50 times less still, but even a very low viscosity has effects on flow and its interaction with solid walls.</p>
<p>To understand how viscosity arises in gasses like air, we have to once more get back to the world of particles. So far we’ve been watching them from a distance, with individual collisions barely perceptible in the moving swarm. This time we’re going take a closer look at these interactions.</p>
<p>In the demonstration below, you can experience a simplified simulation of <span><strong>two</strong></span> <span><strong>molecules</strong></span> colliding in space. Each molecule represents nitrogen or oxygen – these two elements constitute the vast majority of air, and, in normal conditions, each one consists of two atoms.</p>
<p>You can drag the <span><strong>orange particle</strong></span> around, and once you let go I’ll automatically aim it so that it hits the <span><strong>blue particle</strong></span>. The speed of the <span><strong>orange molecule</strong></span> is four times larger than the speed of the <span><strong>blue one</strong></span>:</p>

<p>Notice that after the collision, it’s the <span><strong>orange molecule</strong></span> that’s slow, and it’s the <span><strong>blue one</strong></span> that’s fast. In this demonstration the two particles have the same mass and they collide straight on, so they simply end up trading velocities.</p>
<p>More generally, particles of different masses that strike each other at different angles will exchange some amount of momentum. Recall that the heavier the particle, or the faster it moves, the higher its momentum.</p>
<p>Let’s see how this behavior ends up affecting the average velocities of larger quantities of molecules. In the <span><strong>paused</strong></span> demonstration below, air molecules are grouped into two different parts. The air in the <span><strong>blue region</strong></span> has higher velocity than the air in the <span><strong>red region</strong></span>, which you can see in the black arrows showing the <span><strong>average velocity</strong></span> in those regions. Notice what happens to <span><strong>these averages</strong></span> as you let <span><strong>time flow</strong></span> by dragging the slider:</p>



<p>At the very beginning, the <span><strong>average velocities</strong></span> in these <span><strong>two</strong></span> <span><strong>sections</strong></span> are visibly different, but they quickly even out when fast particles from the <span><strong>blue region</strong></span> flow into the slower <span><strong>red region</strong></span>, and the slower particles from the <span><strong>red region</strong></span> move into the faster <span><strong>blue region</strong></span>, balancing the initial velocity differences.</p>
<p>Moreover, some of the faster particles collide with slower particles in the <span><strong>red region</strong></span> and some of the slower particles collide with faster particles from <span><strong>above</strong></span>. The faster particles lose some of their higher momentum, while the slower particles gain some of the momentum. All of these effects “dilute” some of those average velocity differences between the two regions.</p>
<p>You may also remember that when we observed a flow of fluid around a flat plate, that fluid wasn’t moving at all right on the surface of that plate, because it was stuck to it. Let’s see how this behavior may arise on a microscopic scale.</p>
<p>In the demonstration below, we’re watching the familiar air particles right next to the <span><strong>surface of an object</strong></span>. To make tracking easier, I’m <span><strong>highlighting</strong></span> some of the particles in the vicinity of this <span><strong>surface</strong></span>:</p>


<p>When seen at a very large magnification, this <span><strong>surface</strong></span>, like almost all surfaces, isn’t perfectly smooth and has various peaks and valleys. The particles hitting these irregularities get bounced in more or less random directions. Some of the unlucky molecules can even get stuck for a while in these local crevices.</p>
<p>Close to the <span><strong>surface</strong></span>, the random collisions with peaks and valleys prevent the particles from making bulk progress in <em>any</em> direction. The average velocity of the air flow by the wall is more or less zero. Some molecular interactions between the particles and the <span><strong>surface</strong></span> can also prevent the fluid from moving.</p>
<p>This sticking behavior is known as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No-slip_condition"><em>no‑slip condition</em></a> and it holds true for most typical flows of fluids that we experience day to day. It’s only in extreme conditions of very rarified gasses in the upper parts of the atmosphere or flows in microscopic capillaries that can break this assumption.</p>
<p>Let’s leave the world of particles behind for the last time and see how these two effects play an important role of influencing the airflow close to the surface of any object.</p>
<h2 id="boundary-layer">Boundary Layer<a href="https://ciechanow.ski/airfoil/#boundary-layer" arialabel="Anchor"><img src="https://ciechanow.ski/images/anchor.png" width="16px" height="8px"></a> </h2>
<p>Let’s take another look at a <span><strong>thin plate</strong></span>  placed in the stream of incoming fluid:</p>

<p>From this broader perspective, it’s hard to see how the flow interacts with the surface of that <span><strong>plate</strong></span>, because the effects of viscosity are limited to the region close to that surface. Let’s focus our attention on the small area that I’ve outlined with a <span>dashed</span> line, right in the top part of the <span><strong>plate</strong></span>. Here it is zoomed up close:</p>

<p>We can once more see that, due to the no-slip condition, the velocity is zero at the <span><strong>wall</strong></span>, and then it <strong><span>grows to meet</span></strong> the velocity of the flow further away from the surface itself. What we’re seeing here is known as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boundary_layer"><em>boundary layer</em></a>, which spans the region between the <span><strong>surface</strong></span> of the object and the “outer” flow, which is mostly unaffected by the presence of the object.</p>
<p>Because the velocity in the boundary layer smoothly approaches the speed of the outer flow, it doesn’t have a well-defined end point. One of the choices is to agree that the boundary layer ends where the speed reaches 99% of the speed of the surrounding flow far away from the <span><strong>solid surface</strong></span>. Let me visualize this boundary in the flow using a <span><strong>dashed line</strong></span>:</p>

<p>As we move with the flow along the distance of the plate, the viscosity keeps averaging out the velocity differences, making the boundary layer thicker – this is similar to what we’ve seen at larger scales with highly viscous flows around objects.</p>
<p>Let’s quantify the distribution of speed in the boundary layer a little more precisely. In the demonstration below, I put the velocity arrows back in. I then connected the ends of these arrows with a thin line to show a <em>profile</em> of velocity at that location along the <span><strong>surface</strong></span>:</p>

<p>Notice that, initially, the velocity close to the wall increases almost linearly, but then it smoothly tapers to reach the speed of the external flow. The velocity profile close to the surface has a certain steepness, which I’m showing with the <span><strong>white dotted line</strong></span>. This line determines the amount of skin friction drag at that spot – the closer to the <span><strong>surface</strong></span>, or more horizontal, the <span><strong>line</strong></span> is, the higher the skin drag.</p>
<p>As the differences in velocity become less severe, the force with which viscosity wants to drag the surface with the flow also decreases. In the conditions present in the demonstration, the skin friction drag decreases over distance.</p>
<p>At this point you hopefully have an intuitive grasp of how viscosity affects the flow close to the surface of the object. From our earlier discussion, you may also remember that pressure differences also affect how the flow behaves, with parcels of air slowing down when climbing the hill of <strong><span data-color0="3F90CD" data-color1="dddddd" data-color2="E5432E">increasing pressure</span></strong> and accelerating on the downhill of the <strong><span data-color0="E5432E" data-color1="dddddd" data-color2="3F90CD">decreasing pressure</span></strong>.</p>
<p>In the boundary layer flows we played with, the pressure distribution was more or less constant in the investigated region. Let’s see how the flow changes when we vary that pressure.</p>
<p>In the top part of the demonstration below we see the exact same view of velocity we’ve experimented with so far. In the bottom part of the demonstration below you can see the pressure distribution in the boundary layer, which you can change using the slider below.</p>


<p>If the pressure <a href="#" onclick="boundary4_f0();return false;">decreases</a> in the direction of the flow in the boundary layer, we say that the pressure gradient is <em>favorable</em>. <strong><span data-color0="E5432E" data-color1="dddddd" data-color2="3F90CD">Favorable pressure gradient</span></strong> accelerates the air, and the boundary layer doesn’t grow as quickly, since the slowdown caused by viscosity is opposed by that acceleration.</p>
<p>When the pressure <a href="#" onclick="boundary4_f1();return false;">increases</a> in the direction of the flow, we say that the pressure gradient is <em>adverse</em>. <strong><span data-color0="3F90CD" data-color1="dddddd" data-color2="E5432E">Adverse pressure gradient</span></strong> pushes <em>against</em> the direction of motion of the air. Far away from the <span><strong>surface</strong></span>, the air has enough momentum that the adverse pressure merely slows the flow down. However, close to the <span><strong>surface</strong></span>, the flow in the boundary layer was slow in the first place, so a pushing <strong><span data-color0="3F90CD" data-color1="dddddd" data-color2="E5432E">adverse pressure gradient</span></strong> may even reverse the direction of the flow.</p>
<p>When the flow in the boundary layer gets reversed, we say that the boundary layer <em>separates</em>. This region of reversed flow can form a sort of wedge that can lift the rest of the flow away from the <span><strong>surface</strong></span>.</p>
<p>Let’s take a step back from the subtleties of boundary layers to see how what we’ve learned corresponds to behavior of a flow around an airfoil. Let me once more bring up the demonstration that brought us here in the first place:</p>


<p>As we move across the surface of the airfoil, the <span><strong>high pressure</strong></span> at the stagnation point up front gradually decreases to reach <span><strong>minimum</strong></span> close to the “peak” of that curved surface. Across this transition the <strong><span data-color0="E5432E" data-color1="dddddd" data-color2="3F90CD">pressure gradient is favorable</span></strong>, and that distribution works in our favor – the boundary layer stays nicely attached to the surface.</p>
<p>However, as the air reaches the valley of the <span><strong>lowest pressure</strong></span>, it then has to start climbing back up to reach the <span><strong>slightly positive</strong></span> pressure in the rear of the airfoil. For <a href="#" onclick="symmetric_airfoil_fvm24a_f0();return false;">small values</a> of the  <span><strong>angle of attack</strong></span>, the pressure pit from which the air has to climb out is not very deep and the <strong><span data-color0="3F90CD" data-color1="dddddd" data-color2="E5432E">adverse pressure gradient</span></strong> isn’t very strong, so the boundary layer remains attached.</p>
<p>As we <a href="#" onclick="symmetric_airfoil_fvm24a_f1();return false;">increase</a> the <span><strong>angle of attack</strong></span> of the airfoil, the pressure on top becomes <span><strong>lower</strong></span> and <span><strong>lower</strong></span>. For even <a href="#" onclick="symmetric_airfoil_fvm24a_f2();return false;">higher angles</a>, the <strong><span data-color0="3F90CD" data-color1="dddddd" data-color2="E5432E">adverse pressure gradient</span></strong> becomes so strong that it  <a href="#" onclick="symmetric_airfoil_fvm24a_f3();return false;">eventually</a> reverses the flow in the boundary layer, creating separation. Let’s look at this region up close to see how the arrows of velocity in the separated region point in the other direction:</p>

<p>If you <span>click</span><span>tap</span> to add <strong>markers</strong> in the bottom right corner of the simulation you’ll notice that many of them move <em>against</em> the bulk of the flow – the boundary layer and the flow have separated.</p>
<p>We’ll get back to looking at airfoils soon enough, but we still have a few things to wrap up in the world of boundary layers.</p>
<p>The boundary layers we’ve looked at so far were <em>laminar</em> – the layers of fluid with different velocities flowed in an orderly way on top of each other. However, at higher flow speeds and over larger distances, or at high Reynolds numbers, the flow in the boundary layer transitions to a <em>turbulent</em> flow:</p>

<p>Be aware that what you’re seeing here is a very simplified simulation of a turbulent boundary layer. Turbulence is inherently three dimensional and it contains various evolving structures of different sizes that are extremely computationally expensive to evaluate in detail. Thankfully, you can find many videos of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wr984EOmNaY">computer</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXsl4eyupUY">simulations</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1TbkLIDWys">real flows</a> showing turbulent boundary layers.</p>
<p>While the laminar boundary layers we’ve seen in the past exhibited very organized flows, the turbulent one is very chaotic, with large and small swirls causing the flow to mix very rapidly. The transition from laminar to turbulent boundary layer happens spontaneously, but for a given flow speed, the location of the transition depends on surface roughness, steadiness of the flow outside of the boundary layer, and presence of pressure gradients.</p>
<p>At any given moment, the velocity profile in the turbulent boundary layer is very unsteady, but it can be averaged over time to get the mean distribution of speed. Let’s compare the <em>time-averaged</em> profiles of the <span><strong>laminar</strong></span> and <span><strong>turbulent</strong></span> boundary layers:</p>

<p>In the dynamic simulation of the <span><strong>turbulent</strong></span> boundary layer, we saw how the slower flow close to the <span><strong>surface</strong></span> rapidly mixed with the upper regions of the flow. This slows down those faster sections, and we need to go farther away from the <span><strong>surface</strong></span> for these sluggish intrusions to stop affecting the flow. For this reason, the <span><strong>turbulent</strong></span> boundary layer is thicker and grows faster than a <span><strong>laminar</strong></span> boundary layer.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the strong <span><strong>turbulent</strong></span>  mixing causes the fast external flow to get close to the body, so the overall velocity profile by the <span><strong>surface</strong></span> increases much more quickly in the <span><strong>turbulent</strong></span> case as opposed to <span><strong>laminar</strong></span> case – I’m showing that with <span><strong>white dotted lines</strong></span>.</p>
<p>Recall that the more horizontal the velocity profile at the <span><strong>surface</strong></span> of the object, the bigger the skin friction drag – a <span><strong>turbulent</strong></span>  boundary layer has higher skin friction drag than a <span><strong>laminar</strong></span> layer. Despite the cost of increased friction drag, a <span><strong>turbulent</strong></span>  boundary layer is often beneficial.</p>
<p>Because of that higher velocity closer to the surface, a turbulent boundary layer is more resistant to <strong><span data-color0="3F90CD" data-color1="dddddd" data-color2="E5432E">adverse pressure gradients</span></strong> and it can stay attached to the surface of an object for longer distances.</p>
<p>For some objects like golf balls, which purposefully make their boundary layer turbulent by roughing up the surface with little dimples, the delayed separation also decreases the <span><strong>pressure drag</strong></span> caused by uneven pressure distribution. That reduction more than compensates for the increased skin friction drag, making the dimply golf balls fly farther than equivalent smooth balls.</p>
<p>For airfoils, a turbulent boundary layer delays separation of the flow, which can help prevent stall at higher angles of attack, but at normal cruising conditions the increased skin friction becomes an important drawback. For many aerodynamic shapes in typical conditions, the skin friction drag is the primary contributor to the total drag that these objects experience.</p>
<p>As we’ve seen, by increasing the angle of attack on an airfoil, the lift force grows up to a certain limit, at which the boundary layer separates over most of the upper surface. By staying under this limit, a symmetric airfoil can safely generate lift force.</p>
<p>However, when it comes to  <span><strong>angle of attack</strong></span> and <span><strong>lift</strong></span>, the shape of an airfoil isn’t particularly unique in its <span><strong>lift</strong></span>-creation capabilities. Most simple elongated shapes generate <span><strong>lift</strong></span> when put in a flow at an  <span><strong>angle of attack</strong></span>. In the demonstration below, you can <span><strong>tilt</strong></span> a <span><strong>flat plate</strong></span> and see the forces exerted by the pressure field around it:</p>


<p>You may be surprised to see that, at small  <span><strong>angles of attack</strong></span>, this flat plate also generates <span><strong>lift</strong></span>. An airfoil-like shape is not a requirement for <span><strong>lift</strong></span> generation. After all, paper airplanes with their flat wings can fly just fine. <span><strong>Lift</strong></span> is just an outcome of the pressure distribution created and sustained by the flow.</p>
<p>Although it doesn’t take a sophisticated shape to generate lift at an angle of attack, a well-designed airfoil can often create more lift and with lower drag. In the last section of this article, we’ll explore how other variations to the shape of an airfoil can affect its characteristics.</p>
<h2 id="airfoil-shapes">Airfoil Shapes<a href="https://ciechanow.ski/airfoil/#airfoil-shapes" arialabel="Anchor"><img src="https://ciechanow.ski/images/anchor.png" width="16px" height="8px"></a> </h2>
<p>Let’s go back to the simple symmetric airfoil we’ve been playing with thus far. This time, however, we’re able to control its <span><strong>thickness</strong></span> using the slider:</p>


<p>Notice that as we increase the <span><strong>thickness</strong></span> of the airfoil, the pressure on the top and bottom sections of the shape becomes more <span><strong>negative</strong></span>. For this symmetric airfoil at 0° angle of attack the thickness doesn’t change much other than increasing the <span><strong>pressure drag</strong></span>.</p>
<p>However, if we break the symmetry of the shape, we can use thickness-dependence to make one side of the airfoil have a higher <span><strong>negative</strong></span> pressure than the other. In the demonstration below, you can control the “thickness” of the upper surface of the airfoil using the slider:</p>


<p>Notice that an asymmetric shape creates an asymmetric pressure distribution, which ends up creating <span><strong>lift</strong></span> without any changes to angle of attack. With some slight tweaking of this shape we finally recreated the asymmetric shape we first saw on the airplane in the early sections of this article.</p>
<p>Naturally, when combined with an increasing <span><strong>angle of attack</strong></span>, this airfoil will generate even more <span><strong>lift</strong></span> until it eventually reaches stalling conditions:</p>


<p>While symmetric airfoils are sometimes used in acrobatic airplanes, which often find themselves flying upside down, most typical planes use an asymmetric airfoil shape.</p>
<p>The underlying mechanism of <span><strong>lift</strong></span> generation by changing the <span><strong>angle of attack</strong></span> or by shaping the object differently is ultimately the same – we’re changing the placement and orientation of the surface of the body relative to the incoming flow. The flow reacts by changing the velocity and pressure distribution, and the resulting pressure field creates the forces on that object.</p>
<p>This all means that we have a lot of flexibility in how an airfoil is shaped, as long as the resulting pressure distribution fulfills the design goals of achieving a certain amount of lift while minimizing drag.</p>
<p>For example, in some applications it’s important to minimize the skin friction drag caused by a turbulent boundary layer. Some <em>laminar flow airfoils</em> achieve this by shaping the airfoil to move the “pit” of <span><strong>negative pressure</strong></span> further to the back of the airfoil:</p>


<p>The <strong><span data-color0="E5432E" data-color1="dddddd" data-color2="3F90CD">favorable pressure gradient</span></strong> between the front and the lowest pressure point extends over a longer distance across the surface of this airfoil, which, at least in principle, helps to keep the boundary layer laminar to keep the skin friction low.</p>
<p>Notice that even this unusual airfoil had a rounded front and a sharp back. The roundness of the front helps the air smoothly flow around this area at different  <span><strong>angles of attack</strong></span>, and the sharp back reduces the pressure drag by avoiding the separation of the flow.</p>
<p>The velocity of the flow around the airfoil is also a contributing factor to the design of the shape. Let’s look at the speed distribution in the flow around a simple asymmetric airfoil using the <strong><span>varying colors</span></strong> and <strong>markers</strong>:</p>


<p>The flow above the airfoil is faster than the incoming flow as indicated by brighter colors. The markers that start in the same line don’t end up sliding off the airfoil in the same formation – the ones on top are further ahead. This is particularly visible for <a href="#" onclick="airfoil_fvm3_f0();return false;">larger</a> values of the <span><strong>angles of attack</strong></span>.</p>
<p>This acceleration in the upper part becomes another point of consideration for airfoil design. While commercial airliners don’t fly faster than the speed of sound, the accelerated flow in the top part of an airfoil <em>can</em> break that barrier. This creates a shockwave that can sometimes be <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HekbC6Pl4_Y">seen in flight</a>. Modern airliners use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supercritical_airfoil">supercritical airfoils</a> that are designed to reduce these drag-causing shockwaves by carefully controlling the speed of the flow around the wing.</p>
<p>Planes designed to fly <em>above</em> the speed of sound use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supersonic_airfoils"><em>supersonic airfoils</em></a> that are quite different from the shapes we’ve seen. These airfoils have a thin profile and their front edge is sharp and not rounded. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supersonic_speed"><em>Supersonic</em></a> flows of air are more complicated than what we’ve explored in this article, as variations in density and temperature become an important component of the behavior of the flow.</p>
<p>Many of the airfoils used today are designed specifically for the plane they’ll be used in. Moreover, that cross-sectional shape may change across the length of the wing. Real airplanes are three dimensional and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wing_configuration">overall shape of the wings</a> also significantly affects the lift and drag of an airplane, but ultimately all the resulting forces are an outcome of interactions between the flow and the body.</p>

<p>John Anderson’s <a href="https://www.mheducation.com/highered/product/fundamentals-aerodynamics-anderson/1264151926.html">Fundamentals of Aerodynamics</a> is a very well-written textbook on aerodynamics. Over the course of over a thousand pages, the author presents a classic exposition of the motion of fluids and their interactions with bodies put in those flows.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Understanding+Aerodynamics%3A+Arguing+from+the+Real+Physics-p-9781119967514">Understanding Aerodynamics</a> by Doug McLean is a great textbook that takes a different approach of explaining aerodynamic phenomena using physical reasoning. For me, the crowning achievement of the publication is showing that many popular explanations of the origins of lift are either incorrect or they’re based on merely mathematically convenient theorems. The author’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QKCK4lJLQHU">video lecture</a> gives an overview of some of these misconceptions.</p>
<p>In this article, I’m using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_fluid_dynamics"><em>computational fluid dynamics</em></a> to simulate the flow of air around different objects. For an approachable introduction to these methods I enjoyed Tony Saad’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEaLl6Sf-KIC7oet7zvNfW03aocrIq-s4">series of lectures</a> on the topic. For an alternative, and slightly more rigorous approach, Lorena Barba created <a href="https://lorenabarba.com/blog/cfd-python-12-steps-to-navier-stokes/">12 steps to Navier-Stokes</a>. That website is also accompanied by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL30F4C5ABCE62CB61">video lectures</a>.</p>
<p>Finally, YouTuber <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@braintruffle/videos">braintruffle</a> created a series of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLMoTR49uj6ld32zLVWmcGXaW7w2ey7Vh4">beautiful videos</a> that start with the behavior of fluids on a quantum scale and build up increasingly abstract models that can be used in more practical applications. The videos are packed with interesting takes on fluid mechanics, and they’re worth watching for their visuals alone.</p>
<h2 id="final-words">Final Words<a href="https://ciechanow.ski/airfoil/#final-words" arialabel="Anchor"><img src="https://ciechanow.ski/images/anchor.png" width="16px" height="8px"></a> </h2>
<p>If you were to sit on a flying airplane and look out the window to glance at its wings, you’d often have a hard time seeing anything going on. However, in that crisp clearness of air whose invisible flow sustains the varied pressure field, lies the hidden source of lift that overcomes the might of gravity to keep the plane safely above the ground.</p>
<p>Since the first human flight, we’ve now mastered the art of soaring in the skies by bending the flow of air to our will, using physical quantities like pressure and velocity to help shape our designs. These tangible concepts are ultimately just a manifestation of motions and collisions of billions of inanimate air particles that somehow conspire to assemble the forces we need.</p>
<p>I hope this deeper, technical exploration of airfoils hasn’t diminished your appreciation of the greatness of flight. Perhaps paradoxically, by seeing how all the pieces fit together, you’ll find the whole thing even more magical.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><p>January 26, 2026</p><h2>What's better than a devil you don't know?<br>The devil you do.</h2>

<p>I've used Windows for as long as I've been alive. At 6 years old, my first computer was a Windows 98 machine, with an Athlon XP 1900+ (Palomino core) and a GeForce 440 MX, blessed with a generous 256 megabytes of RAM.</p>

<p>Looking back, I kinda got scammed with that graphics card, but what could I do? I was a silly kid. (The missing shader support came back to bite me in the ass)</p>
<p>Also, is it weird that I still remember the specs of my first computer, 22 years later?</p>

<p>Anyway, Windows has been familiar and comfortable. I knew all the workarounds and how to extract maximum efficiency from it.</p>
<p>I was a happy user, for over 20 years, and Windows has been my go-to for everything computer-related.</p>

<p>Even after becoming a software developer and using a macbook, I'd still find myself reaching for Windows at times.</p>
<p>That is, until Microsoft decided to turn it into something completely unrecognizable and unusable.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.himthe.dev/img/blog/microslop/1.png" alt="Microsoft is a company that turns OS into slop"></p>
<br>
<h2>It all came crashing down</h2>

<p>I think it started with the Windows 10 full-screen ads.</p>

<p>You know, those friendly suggestions telling you to try OneDrive or to "use the recommended browser settings" (<em>reads as "please try Edge and OneDrive, we're desperate"</em>).</p>

<p><img src="https://www.himthe.dev/img/blog/microslop/5.png" alt="Windows 10 full-screen ads"></p>

<p>Actually, scratch that, I think it really started with the non-consensual updates:</p>
<br>
<blockquote>
<p>Oh you're doing work? That's so cute... we're gonna close whatever apps you had open, because we're updating now. We own your computer.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>You had unsaved work? Too bad, it's gone, get bent.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At first I ignored it, and carried on as normal. Sure, I'd get mad from time to time and I'd complain.</p>
<p>But hey, nothing beats the convenience of being able to have all of your applications in one place</p>
<h4>Right? Right?</h4>

<p>My breaking point came with the 24H2 update. It installed on my system <em>without my consent</em>, like any other major update.
I knew there were problems with it, people were already complaining on Reddit, so I just postponed it, and kept postponing it.</p>

<p>All it took was for me to leave my computer on and unattended for a while, and <strong>BOOM</strong>, just like that -  the major OS update that nobody wanted, it was on my computer.</p>
<br>
<h2>The Chrome Seizure Incident</h2>
<p><em>Spoiler: all hell broke loose.</em></p>

<p>As soon as 24H2 landed on my machine, I encountered a bug so bizarre I thought I was losing my marbles.<br>
If Chrome was positioned <em>under</em> any other window, it would start having what I can only describe as a visual seizure.<br>
Here's Ableton Live with Chrome (Reddit) under it:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.himthe.dev/img/blog/microslop/2.gif" alt="Windows 24H2 being a piece of shit"></p>

<p>Worse, there was a decent chance this would trigger a full system lock, leaving me smashing my desk in impotent rage. I shit you not.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.himthe.dev/img/blog/microslop/3.gif" alt="Gif of of XQC raging"></p>
<br>
<div><p>I tried to rollback. The rollback failed with an error. I reinstalled Windows. The bug persisted.<br>
Like digital herpes, I just couldn't get rid of it.</p><p>
The solution? Installing an Insider build. Yes, the solution to Microsoft's broken stable release was to use their <em>unstable</em> release.</p></div>
<br>
<h2>The Sequel I Never Wanted</h2>

<p>The Insider build worked...sort of. But now I had a new bug: Chrome would randomly lock up for about 30 seconds when a video was playing.
My options were to wait it out or press Ctrl+Alt+Delete and Esc to force my way back to a working browser.
After some digging, I discovered this was caused by an NVIDIA-Microsoft driver incompatibility.</p>

</ul>

<p>I've found out that the flickers and the chrome lock-up issues are likely caused by the Multiplane Overlay (MPO) pipeline. Microsoft blamed NVIDIA for not correctly implementing it in their drivers. NVIDIA blamed Microsoft.
What's clear is that if you were facing this issue, you were essentially screwed because these 2 companies would just pass the hot potato to each other.</p>
<p>I should mention that this bug persisted even after I went off the Insider build and on 25H2. And when I posted on r/Microsoft, they just deleted it.</p>
<p>The latest and greatest OS surely cannot be broken beyond repair, surely I'm using my PC wrong.</p>

<p>So there I was, finally grasping the reality of what you're up against, as a Windows user:</p>
<ul>
<li>Random bugs that break basic functionality</li>
<li>Updates that install without permission and brick my system</li>
<li>Copilot and OneDrive ads appearing in every corner of the OS</li>
<li>Copilot buttons everywhere, coming for every application</li>
<li>Can't even make a local account without hacking the setup with Rufus (they even removed the terminal workaround)</li>
<li>Zero actionable fixes or even an aknowledgment of their fuckups</li>
</ul>

<p>People often say Linux is "too much work.".</p>
<p>And I agree. They're completely justified to complain. There's the documentation page diving, the forums, the reddit threads. And, most importantly, you have to basically rewire your brain and stop expecting it to behave like Windows used to.</p>

<p>But I looked at the list above and realized: Windows is now <em>also</em> too much work.<br>
And the difference with Windows is that you're going to do all that work while actively fighting your computer only for it to be undone when the next surprise update comes and ruins everything.</p>

<p>You might be thinking "just disable updates, man" or "just install LTSC", or "just run some random debloat script off of GitHub".
<strong>Why?</strong> Why would I jump through all these hoops? I'd rather put in the effort for an OS that knows what consent is and respects me as a user.</p>
<br>
<h2>Could the grass actually be greener on the other side?</h2>

<p>To set the stage: I'm a software developer and a musician.</p>
<br>

<li><a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/2mKbWigSc3yk0U9uxJDVRK?si=5xDceGSsSyqIWAYsj9BerQ">Spotify</a></li>
</ul>

<p>As you can imagine, I was legitimately worried about app support on Linux, and how it would distrupt my workflow.</p>

<p>But after Chrome crashing for the 10000th time, I said "enough is enough", and decided to go big. I installed <a href="https://cachyos.org/">CachyOS</a>, a performance-focused Arch-based distribution, on my main machine (9800X3D, RTX 5080).</p>

<p>It wasn't a painless process. In fact, sleep mode was broken from the start,
and my system would fail to detect the monitor after waking up.</p>
<p>What's more, Ableton Live does not have a native Linux build, only Windows and macOS. So I couldn't use it anymore, at least not without fucking around with Wine (which doesn't fully support it), or without keeping a Windows VM and taking an L on audio latency.</p>

<p>But unlike Windows, on CachyOS I could actually fix my NVIDIA woes by following <a href="https://discuss.cachyos.org/t/nvidia-and-sleep-failing-to-detect-monitor/12029/11">this thread</a> on their forum.</p>
<p>All I had to do was add the NVIDIA modules to mkinitcpio. One config change, a command to rebuild the initramfs, and problem solved.</p>
<p>I also found a good native alternative to Ableton Live - <a href="https://www.bitwig.com/">Bitwig Studio</a>, which bothered to release a native Linux Build.</p>

<p>Thanks to the constant progress that was made with Pipewire, I'm getting audio latency on par with Mac OS, and lower than Windows.
And my workflow didn't even change that much, since Bitwig is made by ex-Ableton developers that seem to give a shit.</p>

<p>As for my development tools, on Windows you already accept the fact that <strong>you WILL</strong> use WSL or docker, so realistically I just cut the broken middleman.</p>

<p>Now compare that to the Windows fuckery above.</p>
<br>
<h2>What You're Signing Up For</h2>

<p>If 3 years ago you would have told me that Microsoft would singlehandedly sabotage their own OS, doing more Linux marketing than the most neckbearded Linux fanboy (or the most femboy Thinkpad enjoyer), I'd have laughed in your face,
called you delusional, and then hurled some more insults your way.</p>

<p><strong>Yet here we are</strong>, I've been dual-booting CachyOS for over a year, and in the last month I've been using it exclusively.</p>

<p>So what is the actual state of Linux in 2026, from my honest perspective?</p>
<br>
<h5>Web Browsing</h5>
<p>All major browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Brave) have native Linux builds. Full support. No compromises.<br>
Video playback works flawlessly, with hardware acceleration even. On AMD, on NVidia and yes, on Intel too.</p>
<br>
<h5>Software Development</h5>
<p>Linux is the <em>preferred</em> platform for development.</p>
<p>Better terminal support, native package managers, Docker runs natively without the WSL overhead, and your production servers are probably running Linux anyway.</p>
<p>Hell, even Microsoft has their own Linux distro, <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/azurelinux">Azure Linux</a> (Formerly CBL-Mariner).</p>
<br>
<h5>Content Creation</h5>
<p>This is where people assume Linux falls short. And they're right, but not completely:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Adobe Suite</strong>: Runs via Winboat. Far from perfect (no video acceleration, laggy at times), but functional</li>
<li><strong>DaVinci Resolve</strong>: Native Linux app. Professional-grade video editing, free tier available</li>
<li><strong>Kdenlive</strong>: Native Linux app, completely free and open source</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h5>Music Production</h5>
<ul>
<li><strong>Bitwig Studio</strong>: Incredible DAW that was designed that runs natively on Linux</li>
<li><strong>Ardour</strong>: Native, free, open-source DAW</li>
<li><strong>Audio latency</strong>: Thanks to PipeWire, Linux audio latency is actually <em>lower</em> than Windows</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h5>Gaming</h5>
<p>Here's where things get interesting. The perception is that gaming on Linux is a compromise. In 2026, that's increasingly untrue:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Proton/Wine</strong>: Pretty much all games without kernel-level anti-cheat work out of the box through Steam's Proton compatibility layer</li>
<li><strong>Performance</strong>: For AMD GPUs, gaming performance is on par with Windows, on average</li>
<li><strong>NVIDIA</strong>: There was a 10-30% performance penalty on Intel/NVIDIA GPU setups, but recent Vulkan extensions are taking care of that.</li>
</ul>
<p>NVIDIA has released beta drivers making use of these improvements, and once Wine/DXVK/Proton are updated to make use of the extensions, the performance delta should be essentially gone</p>

<p>The only real limitation is that some games with anti-cheat like Valorant, Call of Duty or League of Legends won't run.
But honestly I think not being able to launch League of Legends is actually a feature - one final reason to install Linux.</p>

<p>It's not all bad, though. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1808500/ARC_Raiders/">Arc Raiders</a> makes use of Easy Anti-Cheat, yet runs flawlessly. In fact, I've been playing it like a madman.
It goes to show that if the developers want to, it's possible.</p>
<br>
<h5>3D Modeling</h5>
<p>Still falls short compared to Windows and Mac OS (Autodesk, I'm looking at you).</p>
<p>The silver lining is that Blender has a native build. So if it's your main application, you're good to go.</p>
<br>
<h5>General Usage</h5>
<p>Basic operations are <em>so much faster</em> on Linux.
Opening directories, launching applications, system responsiveness.
It's like your computer took a line of coke, and is now ready to work.</p>

<p>No more waiting for the Start menu to decide it wants to open. No more File Explorer hanging when you need it the most.</p>

<p>Since we're on the topic of Linux improvements, I want to address the elephant in the room - people who keep saying "I want to switch", but keep moving the goalposts:</p>
<br>
<blockquote>
<p>"I'll switch when Linux supports X."</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Linux supports X.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>"Okay, but what about Y?"</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Linux supports Y.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>"Well, Z is still missing..."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you're always finding the next reason not to switch, you're not looking for solutions, <strong>you're looking for excuses to stay complacent</strong>.</p>
<p>I was that person, so I would know.</p>

<p>At the same time, <strong>I want to take it down a notch</strong> and say that there are still plenty of use cases (Especially creative work, and like stated previously, 3D modelling and also Game Dev) where it simply doesn't make sense to switch.</p>
<p>So if you're in that scenario, don't feel pressured, just wait for things to improve.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p>And if you don't plan on ever switching, more power to you.</p>
<p>I'm not here to judge, just here to vent my Microsoft frustrations.</p>

<p>And I didn't really want to switch either, because who wants to re-learn how their computer should be operated from scratch?
What I really wanted was for Windows to work, but Microsoft didn't.</p>
<br>
<h2>The Windows Retrospective</h2>

<p>While I'm enjoying my new Linux setup, Windows 11 is having a miserable year, and we're only a month in!</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.windowslatest.com/2026/01/21/windows-11-had-20-major-update-problems-in-2025-and-and-2026-started-badly-too-what-are-you-doing-microsoft/">Windows Latest</a>, there were over <strong>20 major update problems</strong> in 2025 alone, and 2026 is starting off strong, with the January update causing black screens and Outlook crashes.</p>

<p><strong>Here's a quick 2025 Spotify Wrapped of the bugs Windows users dealt with:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>USB audio devices randomly stopped working</li>
<li>Webcams failed to be detected</li>
<li>BitLocker settings became inaccessible</li>
<li>Adobe Premiere Pro couldn't drag clips on the timeline</li>
<li>Cursor constantly spinning for no reason</li>
<li>Remote Desktop sessions randomly disconnecting</li>
<li>The Copilot app accidentally getting deleted (okay, this is actually a good change for once)</li>
<li>Blue screens of death in mandatory security updates</li>
<li>Windows Hello face recognition broken</li>
<li>File Explorer becoming unresponsive</li>
<li>FPS drops and system reboots while gaming</li>
<li>Task Manager spawning infinite copies of itself</li>
<li>Dark mode breaking with white flashes</li>
</ul>

<p>And the company's response? Crickets. They're busy boasting that 30% of their code is currently being written by AI. Don't worry, Microsoft, we can definitely tell.</p>

<p>For the remainder of 2026, Microsoft is cooking up a big one: replacing more and more native apps with React Native.
But don't let the name fool you, there's nothing "native" about it.
These are projects designed to be easily ported across any machine and architecture, because underneath it all, it's just JavaScript.</p>
<p>And each one spawns its own Chromium process, gobbling up your RAM so you can enjoy the privilege of opening <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/react-native/rnw-settings-win11/">the Settings app</a>.</p>

<p>I could maybe understand this for a weather widget. But when it's coming for core system apps, it's <strong>LAZY!</strong></p>
<p>I'm gonna go full conspiracy nut here, but I bet it's because the LLM understands JavaScript better, and Microsoft can't be asked to pay actual humans to write proper native code.</p>

<h2>Not Because I Wanted To, But Because Microsoft Forced My Hand</h2>

<p>So here I am. Fully switched to Linux.</p>
<p>Not because I'm some open-source idealist or command-line warrior (I'm just some guy), but because Microsoft turned into Microslop.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.himthe.dev/img/blog/microslop/4.png" alt="New Microslop logo"></p>

<p>Meanwhile, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella wrote a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/05/microsofts-nadella-wants-us-to-stop-thinking-of-ai-as-slop/">blog post</a> asking people to stop calling AI-generated content "slop" and to think of AI as "bicycles for the mind."<br></p>

<p><strong>Well, Mr Satya, I have a couple of bicycles that will blow your mind:</strong></p>
<p>You are the biggest Linux evangelist there ever was, you single-handedly convinced countless people to ditch your buggy, ad-ridden, bloated, slop-infested mess of an OS.</p>
<p>And worst of all, you're like a pit bull that has lock-jawed onto OpenAI's ballsack, and you're not letting go, not matter how much we tell you to.</p>

<p>So we're calling slop for what it is: disgusting slop.</p>
<p>You're chasing profit like your life depends on it, yet you've completely forgotten the very thing that generates profit: <strong>user satisfaction</strong>.</p>

<p>Now you're stuck in a circlejerk of fake value in a fake bubble, and OpenAI's hand is so far up your ass they're playing shadow puppets with your tonsils.</p>

<p>The time to switch is now. The tools are ready. The only question is: <strong>are you?</strong></p>
<div><p>Satya came down from his cloud in the sky,</p><p>With Copilot dreams and a gleam in his eye,</p><p>He sprinkled AI on each app, every field,</p><p>Till users cried "Fuck!", and the slop was revealed.</p></div>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <article>
    <p>If I have to pick my favourite German word, I would probably pick “neugierig” because it describes me very well. It means curious, but that is not the literal meaning. Like many German words, it comes from two parts: neu and gierig. Neu means new, and gierig means greedy. So the literal idea behind neugierig is being greedy for new things. That fits me well.</p>

<p>I really enjoy learning new things. That is why I read a lot, watch documentaries, and explore different topics. I am greedy for new information. This also includes what is happening around the world.</p>

<p>For years, I followed the news to keep an eye on what was happening in my country, in the world, and in the tech industry. I curated a list of sources that matched my taste, from international newspapers to YouTube channels, Reddit, and tech-focused websites. Every day, I checked these sources through their websites or my RSS reader to stay up to date.</p>

<p>At the end of last year, I had some time to reflect on my habits. I thought about what makes me happy, what makes me stressed, and how the things I do every day contribute to my goals.</p>

<p>When I looked at the time I spent reading the news and how I felt afterward, I realised it was not helping me at all. Most of the time, I felt more stressed than informed. I also noticed that almost every source focuses heavily on negative stories, simply because those attract more attention and clicks.</p>

<p>When it comes to world news, I started to see the same patterns repeating. A lot of headlines about political figures, conflicts far away, and problems I have no control over. I asked myself how much of this actually affects my daily life, and I could not come up with a good answer. Many things are happening in the world, but they rarely change anything in my day-to-day routine. That made me question why I was following them so closely.</p>

<p>The same applies to tech news. Most of it revolves around big personalities, constant AI updates, startups getting acquired, people becoming rich, hardware I will probably never buy, and rumours about products that may never be released. In most cases, none of this has any real impact on my life. New technologies are usually easy to learn when they become relevant, and it is hard to know which ones will still matter in a few years.</p>

<p>After thinking about whether I really need to follow the news, I decided that I do not. This does not mean I do not care about the world or the tech industry. I am just not interested in following daily updates that do not add much value to my life.</p>

<p>One thing I am still interested in is what is happening in my city. For that, I recently discovered a newsletter from Die Zeit called <a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.zeit.de/serie/elbvertiefung">Elbvertiefung</a>. Every weekday at 6 AM, they send a short newsletter about what happened in Hamburg, and sometimes they also recommend a book or a new restaurant or cafe. I start my day by reading it. Since it is in German, it also helps me improve my language skills.</p>

<p>For the rest of the news, I am considering subscribing to a magazine that covers important events in Germany, the EU, or the world every few months. This kind of format filters out short-term noise and fear-driven stories. These publications usually make money by selling the magazine rather than ads, so they tend to focus more on quality. (If you have any recommendations, feel free to <a href="https://mertbulan.com/contact">reach out</a>.)</p>

<p>At the beginning of this year, I decided to stop following the news. As a result, I started reading more. Last year, I finished 20 books. This year, just in January, I finished 7 books. I still satisfy my curiosity and learn new things, but I just changed the medium. And I feel much better because of it.</p>

          Sounds familiar? This is how I historically have been running
          benchmarks and other experiments requiring a repeated sequence of
          commands — type them manually once, then rely on shell history (and
          maybe some terminal splits) for reproduction. These past few years
          I’ve arrived at a much better workflow pattern — <code>make.ts</code>.
          I was forced to adapt it once I started working with multiprocess
          applications, where manually entering commands is borderline
          infeasible. In retrospect, I should have adapted the workflow years
          earlier.
        </p>
        <section id="The-Pattern">
          <h2><a href="#The-Pattern">The Pattern</a></h2>
          <p>
            Use a (gitignored) file for interactive scripting. Instead of
            entering a command directly into the terminal, write it to a file
            first, and then run the file. For me, I type stuff into <code>make.ts</code> and then run <code>./make.ts</code> in my terminal
            (Ok, I need <em>one</em> <kbd><kbd>Up Enter</kbd></kbd> for that).
          </p>
          <p>
            I want to be clear here, I am not advocating writing “proper”
            scripts, just capturing your interactive, ad-hoc command to a
            persistent file. Of course any command that you want to execute
            <em>repeatedly</em> belongs to the build system. The surprising
            thing is that even more complex one-off commands benefit from
            running through file, because it will take you several tries to get
            them right!
          </p>
          <p>
            There are many benefits relative to <kbd><kbd>Up Up Up</kbd></kbd>
            workflow:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Real commands tend to get large, and it is so much nicer to use a
              real 2D text editor rather than shell’s line editor.
            </li>
            <li>
              If you need more than one command, you can write several commands,
              and still run them all with a single key (before <code>make.ts</code>, I was prone to constructing rather horrific
              &amp;&amp; conjuncts for this reason).
            </li>
            <li>
              With a sequence of command outlined, you nudge yourself towards
              incrementally improving them, making them idempotent, and
              otherwise investing into your own workflow for the next few
              minutes, without falling into the YAGNI pit from the outset.
            </li>
            <li>
              At some point you might realize after, say, running a series of
              ad-hoc benchmarks interactively, that you’d rather write a proper
              script which executes a collection of benchmarks with varying
              parameters. With the file approach, you already have the meat of
              the script implemented, and you only need to wrap in a couple of
              fors and ifs.
            </li>
            <li>
              Finally, if you happen to work with multi-process projects, you’ll
              find it easier to manage concurrency declaratively, spawning a
              tree of processes from a single script, rather than switching
              between terminal splits.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </section>
        <section id="Details">
          <h2><a href="#Details">Details</a></h2>
          <p>
            Use a consistent filename for the script. I use <code>make.ts</code>, and so there’s a <code>make.ts</code> in the root
            of most projects I work on. Correspondingly, I have <code>make.ts</code> line in project’s <code>.git/info/exclude</code>
            — the <code>.gitignore</code> file which is not shared. The fixed
            name reduces fixed costs — whenever I need complex interactivity I
            don’t need to come up with a name for a new file, I open my
            pre-existing <code>make.ts</code>, wipe whatever was there and start
            hacking. Similarly, I have <code>./make.ts</code> in my shell
            history, so
            <a href="https://fishshell.com/docs/current/interactive.html#autosuggestions">fish autosuggestions</a>
            work for me. At one point, I had a VS Code task to run <code>make.ts</code>, though I now use
            <a href="https://matklad.github.io/2025/08/31/vibe-coding-terminal-editor.html">terminal editor</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Start the script with hash bang,
            <span><code>#!/usr/bin/env -S deno run
                --allow-all</code></span>
            in my case, and
            <span><code>chmod a+x make.ts</code></span>
            the file, to make it easy to run.
          </p>
          <p>Write the script in a language that:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              you are comfortable with,
            </li>
            <li>
              doesn’t require huge setup,
            </li>
            <li>
              makes it easy to spawn subprocesses,
            </li>
            <li>
              has good support for concurrency.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            For me, that is TypeScript. Modern JavaScript is sufficiently
            ergonomic, and structural, gradual typing is a sweet spot that gives
            you reasonable code completion, but still allows brute-forcing any
            problem by throwing enough stringly dicts at it.
          </p>
          <p>
            JavaScript’s tagged template syntax is brilliant for scripting
            use-cases:
          </p>

          <figure>
            <pre><code><span><span>function</span> <span>$</span>(<span>literal, ...interpolated</span>) {</span>
<span>  <span>console</span>.<span>log</span>({ literal, interpolated });</span>
<span>}</span>
<span></span>
<span><span>const</span> dir = <span>"hello, world"</span>;</span>
<span>$<span>`ls <span>${dir}</span>`</span>;</span></code></pre>
          </figure>
          <p>prints</p>

          <figure>
            <pre><code><span><span>{</span></span>
<span>    literal<span>:</span> <span>[</span> <span>"ls "</span><span>,</span> <span>""</span> <span>]</span><span>,</span></span>
<span>    interpolated<span>:</span> <span>[</span> <span>"hello, world"</span> <span>]</span></span>
<span><span>}</span></span></code></pre>
          </figure>
          <p>
            What happens here is that <code>$</code> gets a list of literal
            string fragments inside the backticks, and then, separately, a list
            of values to be interpolated in-between. It <em>could</em>
            concatenate everything to just a single string, but it doesn’t have
            to. This is precisely what is required for process spawning, where
            you want to pass an array of strings to the <code>exec</code>
            syscall.
          </p>
          <p>
            Specifically, I use <a href="https://github.com/dsherret/dax">dax</a> library with Deno, which is excellent as a single-binary
            batteries-included scripting environment (see <a href="https://matklad.github.io/2023/02/12/a-love-letter-to-deno.html">&lt;3 Deno</a>). Bun has a dax-like library in the box and is a
            good alternative (though I personally stick with Deno because of
            <code>deno fmt</code> and <code>deno lsp</code>). You could also use
            famous zx, though be mindful that it
            <a href="https://google.github.io/zx/configuration#shell">uses your shell as a middleman</a>, something I consider to be
            sloppy (<a href="https://julialang.org/blog/2012/03/shelling-out-sucks/">explanation</a>).
          </p>
          <p>
            While <code>dax</code> makes it convenient to spawn a single
            program, <code>async/await</code> is excellent for herding a slither
            of processes:
          </p>

          <figure>
            <pre><code><span><span>await</span> <span>Promise</span>.<span>all</span>([</span>
<span>    $<span>`sleep 5`</span>,</span>
<span>    $<span>`sleep 10`</span>,</span>
<span>]);</span></code></pre>
          </figure>

            Here’s how I applied this pattern earlier today. I wanted to measure
            how TigerBeetle cluster recovers from the crash of the primary. The
            manual way to do that would be to create a bunch of ssh sessions for
            several cloud machines, format datafiles, start replicas, and then
            create some load. I
            <em>almost</em> started to split my terminal up, but then figured
            out I can do it the smart way.
          </p>
          <p>
            The first step was cross-compiling the binary, uploading it to the
            cloud machines, and running the cluster (using my <a href="https://matklad.github.io/2026/01/20/vibecoding-2.html">box</a> from the other week):
          </p>

          <p>
            Running the above the second time, I realized that I need to kill
            the old cluster first, so two new commands are “interactively”
            inserted:
          </p>

          <figure>
            <pre><code><span><span>await</span> $<span>`./zig/zig build -Drelease -Dtarget=x86_64-linux`</span>;</span>
<span><span>await</span> $<span>`box sync 0-5 ./tigerbeetle`</span>;</span>
<span></span>
<span><span>await</span> $<span>`box run 0-5 rm 0_??.tigerbeetle`</span>.<span>noThrow</span>();</span>
<span><span>await</span> $<span>`box run 0-5 pkill tigerbeetle`</span>.<span>noThrow</span>();</span>
<span></span>
<span><span>await</span> $<span>`box run 0-5</span></span>
<span><span>    ./tigerbeetle format --cluster=0 --replica-count=6 --replica=?? 0_??.tigerbeetle`</span>;</span>
<span><span>await</span> $<span>`box run 0-5</span></span>
<span><span>    ./tigerbeetle start --addresses=?0-5? 0_??.tigerbeetle`</span>;</span></code></pre>
          </figure>
          <p>
            At this point, my investment in writing this file and not just
            entering the commands one-by-one already paid off!
          </p>
          <p>
            The next step is to run the benchmark load in parallel with the
            cluster:
          </p>

          <figure>
            <pre><code><span><span>await</span> <span>Promise</span>.<span>all</span>([</span>
<span>    $<span>`box run 0-5 ./tigerbeetle start     --addresses=?0-5? 0_??.tigerbeetle`</span>,</span>
<span>    $<span>`box run 6   ./tigerbeetle benchmark --addresses=?0-5?`</span>,</span>
<span>])</span></code></pre>
          </figure>
          <p>
            I don’t need two terminals for two processes, and I get to
            copy-paste-edit the mostly same command.
          </p>
          <p>
            For the next step, I actually want to kill one of the replicas, and
            I also want to capture live logs, to see in real-time how the
            cluster reacts. This is where <code>0-5</code> multiplexing syntax
            of box falls short, but, given that this is JavaScript, I can just
            write a for loop:
          </p>

          <figure>
            <pre><code><span><span>const</span> replicas = <span>range</span>(<span>6</span>).<span>map</span>(<span>(<span>it</span>) =&gt;</span></span>
<span>    $<span>`box run <span>${it}</span></span></span>
<span><span>        ./tigerbeetle start --addresses=?0-5? 0_??.tigerbeetle</span></span>
<span><span>        &amp;&gt; logs/<span>${it}</span>.log`</span></span>
<span>        .<span>noThrow</span>()</span>
<span>        .<span>spawn</span>()</span>
<span>);</span>
<span></span>
<span><span>await</span> <span>Promise</span>.<span>all</span>([</span>
<span>    $<span>`box run 6 ./tigerbeetle benchmark --addresses=?0-5?`</span>,</span>
<span>    (<span>async</span> () =&gt; {</span>
<span>        <span>await</span> $.<span>sleep</span>(<span>"20s"</span>);</span>
<span>        <span>console</span>.<span>log</span>(<span>"REDRUM"</span>);</span>
<span>        <span>await</span> $<span>`box run 1 pkill tigerbeetle`</span>;</span>
<span>    })(),</span>
<span>]);</span>
<span></span>
<span>replicas.<span>forEach</span>(<span>(<span>it</span>) =&gt;</span> it.<span>kill</span>());</span>
<span><span>await</span> <span>Promise</span>.<span>all</span>(replicas);</span></code></pre>
          </figure>
          <p>
            At this point, I do need two terminals. One runs <code>./make.ts</code> and shows the log from the benchmark itself, the
            other runs <code>tail -f logs/2.log</code> to watch the next replica
            to become primary.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have definitelly crossed the line where writing a script makes
            sense, but the neat thing is that the gradual evolution up to this
            point. There isn’t a discontinuity where I need to spend 15 minutes
            trying to shape various ad-hoc commands from five terminals into a
            single coherent script, it was in the file to begin with.
          </p>
          <p>
            And then the script is easy to evolve. Once you realize that it’s a
            good idea to also run the same benchmark against a different,
            baseline version TigerBeetle, you replace <code>./tigerbeetle</code>
            with
            <code>./${tigerbeetle}</code> and wrap everything into
          </p>

          <figure>
            <pre><code><span><span>async</span> <span>function</span> <span>benchmark</span>(<span>tigerbeetle: <span>string</span></span>) {</span>
<span>    <span>// ...</span></span>
<span>}</span>
<span></span>
<span><span>const</span> tigerbeetle = <span>Deno</span>.<span>args</span>[<span>0</span>]</span>
<span><span>await</span> <span>benchmark</span>(tigerbeetle);</span></code></pre>
          </figure>

          <figure>
            <pre><code><span><span>$</span> ./make.ts tigerbeetle-baseline</span>
<span><span>$</span> ./make.ts tigerbeetle</span></code></pre>
          </figure>
          <p>
            A bit more hacking, and you end up with a repeatable benchmark
            schedule for a matrix of parameters:
          </p>

          <figure>
            <pre><code><span><span>for</span> (<span>const</span> attempt <span>of</span> [<span>0</span>, <span>1</span>])</span>
<span><span>for</span> (<span>const</span> tigerbeetle <span>of</span> [<span>"baseline"</span>, <span>"tigerbeetle"</span>])</span>
<span><span>for</span> (<span>const</span> mode <span>of</span> [<span>"normal"</span>, <span>"viewchange"</span>]) {</span>
<span>    <span>const</span> results = $.<span>path</span>(</span>
<span>        <span>`./results/<span>${tigerbeetle}</span>-<span>${mode}</span>-<span>${attempt}</span>`</span>,</span>
<span>    );</span>
<span>    <span>await</span> <span>benchmark</span>(tigerbeetle, mode, results);</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
          </figure>
          <p>
            That’s the gist of it. Don’t let the shell history be your source,
            capture it into the file first!

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

		<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><span>WhatsApp has adopted and rolled out a new layer of security for users – built with Rust – as part of its effort to harden defenses against malware threats.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>WhatsApp’s experience creating and distributing our media consistency library in Rust to billions of devices and browsers proves Rust is production ready at a global scale.</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><span>Our Media Handling Strategy</span></h2>
<p><span>WhatsApp provides default end-to-end encryption for over 3 billion people to message securely each and every day. Online security is an adversarial space, and to continue ensuring users can keep messaging securely, we’re constantly adapting and evolving our strategy against cyber-security threats – all while supporting the WhatsApp infrastructure to help people connect.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>For example, WhatsApp, like many other applications, allows users to share media and other types of documents. WhatsApp helps protect users by warning about dangerous attachments like APKs, yet rare and sophisticated malware could be hidden within a seemingly benign file like an image or video. These maliciously crafted files might target unpatched vulnerabilities in the operating system, libraries distributed by the operating system, or the application itself.</span></p>
<p><span>To help protect against such potential threads, WhatsApp is increasingly using the Rust programming language, including in our media sharing functionality. Rust is a memory safe language offering numerous security benefits. We believe that this is the largest rollout globally of any library written in Rust.</span></p>
<p><span>To help explain why and how we rolled this out, we should first look back at a key OS-level vulnerability that sent an important signal to WhatsApp around hardening media-sharing defenses.</span></p>
<h2>2015 Android Vulnerability: A Wake-up Call for Media File Protections</h2>
<p><span>In 2015, Android devices, and the applications that ran on them, became vulnerable to the “</span><a href="https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/alerts/2015/07/28/stagefright-android-vulnerability" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Stagefright” vulnerability</span></a><span>. The bug lay in the processing of media files by operating system-provided libraries, so WhatsApp and other applications could not patch the underlying vulnerability. Because it could often take months for people to update to the latest version of their software, we set out to find solutions that would keep WhatsApp users safe, even in the event of an operating system vulnerability.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>At that time, we realized that a cross-platform C++ library already developed by WhatsApp to send and consistently format MP4 files (called “wamedia”) could be modified to detect files which do not adhere to the MP4 standard and might trigger bugs in a vulnerable OS library on the receiver side – hence putting a target’s security at risk. We rolled out this check and were able to protect WhatsApp users from the Stagefright vulnerability much more rapidly than by depending on users to update the OS itself.</span></p>
<p><span>But because media checks run automatically on download and process untrusted inputs, we identified early on that wamedia was a prime candidate for using a memory safe language.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Rust-at-scale_inline.jpg" alt="" width="2100" height="1250" srcset="https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Rust-at-scale_inline.jpg 2100w, https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Rust-at-scale_inline.jpg?resize=916,545 916w, https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Rust-at-scale_inline.jpg?resize=768,457 768w, https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Rust-at-scale_inline.jpg?resize=1024,610 1024w, https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Rust-at-scale_inline.jpg?resize=1536,914 1536w, https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Rust-at-scale_inline.jpg?resize=2048,1219 2048w, https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Rust-at-scale_inline.jpg?resize=96,57 96w, https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Rust-at-scale_inline.jpg?resize=192,114 192w" sizes="(max-width: 992px) 100vw, 62vw"></p>
<h2><span>Our Solution: Rust at Scale</span></h2>
<p><span>Rather than an incremental rewrite, we developed the Rust version of wamedia in parallel with the original C++ version. We used differential fuzzing and extensive integration and unit tests to ensure compatibility between the two implementations.</span></p>
<p><span>Two major hurdles were the initial binary size increase due to bringing in the Rust standard library and the build system support required for the diverse platforms supported by WhatsApp. WhatsApp made a long-term bet to build that support. In the end, we replaced 160,000 lines of C++ (excluding tests) with 90,000 lines of Rust (including tests). The Rust version showed performance and runtime memory usage advantages over the C++. Given this success, Rust was fully rolled out to all WhatsApp users and many platforms: Android, iOS, Mac, Web, Wearables, and more. With this positive evidence in hand, memory safe languages will play an ever increasing part in WhatsApp’s overall approach to application and user security.</span></p>
<p><span>Over time, we’ve added more checks for non-conformant structures within certain file types to help protect downstream libraries from parser differential exploit attempts. Additionally, we check higher risk file types, even if structurally conformant, for risk indicators. For instance, PDFs are often a vehicle for malware, and more specifically, the presence of embedded files and scripting elements within a PDF further raise risks. We also detect when one file type masquerades as another, through a spoofed extension or MIME type. Finally, we uniformly flag known dangerous file types, such as executables or applications, for special handling in the application UX. Altogether, we call this ensemble of checks “Kaleidoscope.” This system protects people on WhatsApp from potentially malicious unofficial clients and attachments. Although format checks will not stop every attack, this layer of defense helps mitigate many of them.</span></p>
<p><span>Each month, these libraries are distributed to billions of phones, laptops, desktops, watches, and browsers running on multiple operating systems for people on WhatsApp, Messenger, and Instagram. This is the largest ever deployment of Rust code to a diverse set of end-user platforms and products that we are aware of. Our experience speaks to the production-readiness and unique value proposition of Rust on the client-side.</span></p>
<h2>How Rust Fits In To WhatsApp’s Approach to App Security</h2>
<p><span>This is just one example of WhatsApp’s many investments in security. It’s why we built default end-to-end encryption for personal messages and calls, offer <a href="https://blog.whatsapp.com/end-to-end-encrypted-backups-on-whatsapp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">end-to-end encrypted </a></span><span>backups</span><span>, and use </span><a href="https://tech.facebook.com/engineering/2023/4/strengthening-whatsapp-end-to-end-encryption-key-transparency/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>key transparency technology</span></a><span> to verify a secure connection, provide additional </span><a href="https://engineering.fb.com/2023/11/08/security/whatsapp-calls-enhancing-security/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>calling protections</span></a><span>, and more.</span></p>
<p><span>WhatsApp has a strong track record of being loud when we find issues and working to hold bad actors accountable. For example, WhatsApp </span><a href="https://www.whatsapp.com/security/advisories" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>reports CVEs</span></a><span> for important issues we find in our applications, even if we do not find evidence of exploitation. We do this to give people on WhatsApp the best chance of protecting themselves by seeing a security advisory and updating quickly.</span></p>
<p><span>To ensure application security, we first must identify and quantify the sources of risk. We do this through internal and external audits like </span><a href="https://research.nccgroup.com/2021/10/27/public-report-whatsapp-end-to-end-encrypted-backups-security-assessment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>NCC Group’s public assessment</span></a><span> of WhatsApp’s end-to-end encrypted backups, fuzzing, </span><a href="https://engineering.fb.com/2021/10/20/security/static-analysis-award/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>static analysis</span></a><span>, supply chain management, and automated attack surface analysis. We also recently expanded our </span><a href="https://bugbounty.meta.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Bug Bounty program</span></a><span> to introduce the </span><a href="https://bugbounty.meta.com/blog/15th-anniversary-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>WhatsApp Research Proxy</span></a><span> – a tool that makes research into WhatsApp’s network protocol more effective.</span></p>
<p><span>Next, we reduce the identified risk. Like many others in the industry, we found that the majority of the high severity vulnerabilities we published were due to memory safety issues in code written in the C and C++ programming languages. To combat this we invest in three parallel strategies:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Design the product to minimize unnecessary attack surface exposure.</span></li>
<li><span>Invest in security assurance for the remaining C and C++ code.</span></li>
<li><span>Default the choice of memory safe languages, and not C and C++, for new code.</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span>WhatsApp has added protections like CFI, hardened memory allocators, safer buffer handling APIs, and more. C and C++ developers have specialized security training, development guidelines, and automated security analysis on their changes. We also have strict SLAs for fixing issues uncovered by the risk identification process.</span></p>
<h2><span>Accelerating Rust Adoption to Enhance Security</span></h2>
<p><span>Rust enabled WhatsApp’s security team to develop a secure, high performance, cross-platform library to ensure media shared on the platform is consistent and safe across devices. This is an important step forward in adding additional security behind the scenes for users and part of our ongoing defense-in-depth approach. Security teams at WhatsApp and Meta are highlighting opportunities for high impact adoption of Rust to interested teams, and we anticipate accelerating adoption of Rust over the coming years. </span></p>

That is our goal: preventing vulnerabilities, not merely patching them after deployment.</h2><h2 id="what-this-means">What This Means</h2><p>OpenSSL represents one of the most deployed, battle-tested, and carefully maintained open-source projects in existence. The fact that 12 previously unknown vulnerabilities could still be found there, including issues dating back to 1998, suggests that manual review faces significant limits, even in mature, heavily audited codebases.</p><p>Human reviewers are constrained by time, attention, and the sheer volume of code in modern systems. Traditional static analysis catches certain bug classes but struggles with complex logic errors and timing-dependent issues. By contrast, autonomous AI-driven analysis operates at a different scale. It can examine code paths and edge cases that would take human reviewers months to cover, and it runs continuously rather than periodically.</p><p>This doesn't mean that AI can replace human expertise. The OpenSSL maintainers' deep knowledge of the codebase was essential for validating findings and developing robust fixes. But it does change the SLA of security. When autonomous discovery is paired with responsible disclosure, it <strong>collapses the time-to-remediation</strong> for the entire ecosystem.</p><p>The 12 OpenSSL vulnerabilities we identified, spanning 8+ subsystems from CMS to QUIC to post-quantum signatures, represent a milestone in our (admittedly ambitious) mission: moving from reactive patching to securing the software foundation that modern civilization depends on.</p><h2 id="collaboration-with-openssl">Collaboration with OpenSSL</h2><p>From the moment our system flagged these anomalies, we approached this as a partnership with the OpenSSL community. We submitted detailed technical reports through their coordinated security reporting process, including complete reproduction steps, root cause analysis, and concrete patch proposals. In each case, our proposed fixes either informed or were directly adopted by the OpenSSL team.</p><p>As Matt Caswell, Executive Director of the OpenSSL Foundation, said, “Keeping widely deployed cryptography secure requires tight coordination between maintainers and researchers. We appreciate AISLE's responsible disclosures and the quality of their engagement across these issues." </p><p>The OpenSSL team's responsiveness was exceptional. Under the leadership of Tomáš Mráz, the Chief Technical Officer (CTO) at the OpenSSL Foundation, the maintainers engaged technically at every stage: validating findings, refining patches, coordinating releases across multiple branches, and synchronizing with downstream distributions.</p><h2 id="further-reading">Further Reading</h2><ul><li value="1"><a href="https://aisle.com/blog/aisle-discovers-three-of-the-four-openssl-vulnerabilities-of-2025" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AISLE's detailed technical analysis of the Q3 2025 discoveries</a>  </li><li value="2"><a href="https://openssl-library.org/news/vulnerabilities/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OpenSSL Security Advisories</a></li></ul><p>For questions about AISLE's autonomous analyzer, reach out to us at <a href="https://aisle.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#19717c7575765978706a757c377a7674" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span data-cfemail="670f020b0b0827060e140b024904080a">[email&nbsp;protected]</span></a>.  </p><p><em>Our appreciation goes to Tomáš Mráz, Matt Caswell, Neil Horman, and the OpenSSL team for their collaboration throughout this process.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
     <p>Hello! One of my favourite things is starting to learn an
Old Boring Technology that I’ve never tried before but that has been around for
20+ years. It feels really good when every problem I’m ever going to have has
been solved already 1000 times and I can just get stuff done easily.</p>
<p>I’ve thought it would be cool to learn a popular web framework like
Rails or Django or Laravel for a long time, but I’d never really managed to
make it happen. But I started learning Django to make a website a few months
back, I’ve been liking it so far, and here are a few quick notes!</p>
<h3 id="less-magic-than-rails">
    <a href="#less-magic-than-rails">
      less magic than Rails
    </a>
</h3>
<p>I spent some time <a href="https://jvns.ca/blog/2020/11/09/day-1--a-little-rails-/">trying to learn Rails</a> in 2020,
and while it was cool and I really wanted to like Rails (the Ruby community is great!),
I found that if I left my Rails project alone for months, when I came
back to it it was hard for me to remember how to get anything done because
(for example) if it says <code>resources :topics</code> in your <code>routes.rb</code>, on its own
that doesn’t tell you where the <code>topics</code> routes are configured, you need to
remember or look up the convention.</p>
<p>Being able to abandon a project for months or years and then come back to it is
really important to me (that’s how all my projects work!), and Django feels easier
to me because things are more explicit.</p>
<p>In my small Django project it feels like I just have 5 main files (other
than the settings files): <code>urls.py</code>, <code>models.py</code>, <code>views.py</code>, <code>admin.py</code>, and
<code>tests.py</code>, and if I want to know where something else is (like an HTML template)
is then it’s usually explicitly referenced from one of those files.</p>
<h3 id="a-built-in-admin">
    <a href="#a-built-in-admin">
      a built-in admin
    </a>
</h3>
<p>For this project I wanted to have an admin interface to manually edit or view
some of the data in the database. Django has a really nice built-in admin
interface, and I can customize it with just a little bit of code.</p>
<p>For example, here’s part of one of my admin classes, which sets up which fields
to display in the “list” view,  which field to search on, and how to order them
by default.</p>
<pre><code>@admin.register(Zine)
class ZineAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
    list_display = ["name", "publication_date", "free", "slug", "image_preview"]
    search_fields = ["name", "slug"]
    readonly_fields = ["image_preview"]
    ordering = ["-publication_date"]
</code></pre>
<h3 id="it-s-fun-to-have-an-orm">
    <a href="#it-s-fun-to-have-an-orm">
      it’s fun to have an ORM
    </a>
</h3>
<p>In the past my attitude has been “ORMs? Who needs them? I can just write my own SQL queries!”.
I’ve been enjoying Django’s ORM so far though, and I think it’s cool how Django
uses <code>__</code> to represent a <code>JOIN</code>, like this:</p>
<pre><code>Zine.objects
    .exclude(product__order__email_hash=email_hash)
</code></pre>
<p>This query involves 5 tables: <code>zines</code>, <code>zine_products</code>, <code>products</code>, <code>order_products</code>, and <code>orders</code>.
To make this work I just had to tell Django that there’s a <code>ManyToManyField</code>
relating “orders” and “products”, and another <code>ManyToManyField</code> relating
“zines”, and “products”, so that it knows how to connect <code>zines</code>, <code>orders</code>, <code>products</code>.</p>
<p>I definitely <em>could</em> write that query, but writing <code>product__order__email_hash</code> is
a lot less typing, it feels a lot easier to read, and honestly I think it would
take me a little while to figure out how to construct the query
(which needs to do a few other things than just those joins).</p>
<p>I have zero concern about the performance of my ORM-generated queries so I’m
pretty excited about ORMs for now, though I’m sure I’ll find things to be
frustrated with eventually.</p>
<h3 id="automatic-migrations">
    <a href="#automatic-migrations">
      automatic migrations!
    </a>
</h3>
<p>The other great thing about the ORM is migrations!</p>
<p>If I add, delete, or change a field in <code>models.py</code>, Django will automatically
generate a migration script like <code>migrations/0006_delete_imageblob.py</code>.</p>
<p>I assume that I could edit those scripts if I wanted, but so far I’ve just
been running the generated scripts with no change and it’s been going great. It
really feels like magic.</p>
<p>I’m realizing that being able to do migrations easily is important for me right
now because I’m changing my data model fairly often as I figure out how I want
it to work.</p>
<h3 id="i-like-the-docs">
    <a href="#i-like-the-docs">
      I like the docs
    </a>
</h3>
<p>I had a bad habit of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krMw1QTP2no">never reading the documentation</a>
but I’ve been really enjoying the parts of Django’s docs that I’ve read so far.
This isn’t by accident: Jacob Kaplan-Moss has a
<a href="https://pyvideo.org/pycon-us-2011/pycon-2011--writing-great-documentation.html">talk from PyCon 2011</a>
on Django’s documentation culture.</p>
<p>For example the <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/6.0/topics/db/models/">intro to models</a>
lists the most important common fields you might want to set when using the ORM.</p>
<h3 id="using-sqlite">
    <a href="#using-sqlite">
      using sqlite
    </a>
</h3>
<p>After having a bad experience trying to operate Postgres and not being able to
understand what was going on, I decided to run all of my small websites with
SQLite instead. It’s been going way better, and I love being able to backup by
just doing a <code>VACUUM INTO</code> and then copying the resulting single file.</p>
<p>I’ve been following <a href="https://alldjango.com/articles/definitive-guide-to-using-django-sqlite-in-production">these instructions</a>
for using SQLite with Django in production.</p>
<p>I think it should be fine because I’m expecting the site to have a few hundred
writes per day at most, much less than <a href="https://messwithdns.net/">Mess with DNS</a>
which has a lot more of writes and has been working well (though the writes are
split across 3 different SQLite databases).</p>
<h3 id="built-in-email-and-more">
    <a href="#built-in-email-and-more">
      built in email (and more)
    </a>
</h3>
<p>Django seems to be very “batteries-included”, which I love – if I want CSRF
protection, or a <code>Content-Security-Policy</code>, or I want to send email, it’s all
in there!</p>
<p>For example, I wanted to save the emails Django sends to a file in dev mode (so
that it didn’t send real email to real people), which was just a little bit
of configuration.</p>
<p>I just put this <code>settings/dev.py</code>:</p>
<pre><code>EMAIL_BACKEND = "django.core.mail.backends.filebased.EmailBackend"
EMAIL_FILE_PATH = BASE_DIR / "emails"
</code></pre>
<p>and then set up the production email like this in <code>settings/production.py</code></p>
<pre><code>EMAIL_BACKEND = "django.core.mail.backends.smtp.EmailBackend"
EMAIL_HOST = "smtp.whatever.com"
EMAIL_PORT = 587
EMAIL_USE_TLS = True
EMAIL_HOST_USER = "xxxx"
EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD = os.getenv('EMAIL_API_KEY')
</code></pre>
<p>That made me feel like if I want some other basic website feature, there’s
likely to be an easy way to do it built into Django already.</p>
<h3 id="the-settings-file-still-feels-like-a-lot">
    <a href="#the-settings-file-still-feels-like-a-lot">
      the settings file still feels like a lot
    </a>
</h3>
<p>I’m still a bit intimidated by the <code>settings.py</code> file: Django’s settings system
works by setting a bunch of global variables in a file, and I feel a bit
stressed about… what if I make a typo in the name of one of those variables?
How will I know? What if I type <code>WSGI_APPLICATOIN = "config.wsgi.application"</code>
instead of <code>WSGI_APPLICATION</code>?</p>
<p>I guess I’ve gotten used to having a Python language server tell me when I’ve
made a typo and so now it feels a bit disorienting when I can’t rely on the
language server support.</p>
<h3 id="that-s-all-for-now">
    <a href="#that-s-all-for-now">
      that’s all for now!
    </a>
</h3>
<p>I haven’t really successfully used an actual web framework for a project before
(right now almost all of my websites are either a single Go binary or static
sites), so I’m interested in seeing how it goes!</p>
<p>There’s still lots for me to learn about, I still haven’t really gotten into
Django’s form validation tooling or authentication systems.</p>
<p>Thanks to Marco Rogers for convincing me to give ORMs a chance.</p>
<p>(we’re still experimenting with the comments-on-Mastodon system! <a href="https://comments.jvns.ca/post/115969229107460589">Here are the comments on Mastodon</a>! tell me your favourite Django feature!)</p>

<p>That's our mascot. Entirely CSG. A rounded cube intersected with a sphere for the body, spheres for eyes, cylinders for arms. Eight materials, seventeen parts, one GLB file.</p>
<!-- -->
<h2>Why Rust</h2>
<p>The geometry engine is <a href="https://github.com/elalish/manifold" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">manifold</a>, which guarantees watertight meshes from boolean operations. The Rust bindings give us zero-cost abstractions over the C++ core — the operator overloads compile down to direct manifold calls. No garbage collection pauses. No floating point surprises from a scripting layer.</p>
<p>But honestly, the main reason is <span>the toolchain</span>. <code>cargo test</code> runs 21 unit tests that verify volumes, surface areas, bounding boxes, and export round-trips. <code>cargo clippy</code> catches issues before they become parts with holes in the wrong place. Types prevent you from passing a radius where a diameter was expected.</p>
<p>CAD files <em>should</em> be code. Code has tests, reviews, diffs, and CI. An STL file has... bytes.</p>
<!-- -->
<h2>Built for agents</h2>
<p>One thing I care about that most CAD tools don't: vcad is designed to be used by <span>AI coding agents</span>.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/ecto/vcad" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">README</a> has full API tables, a cookbook with copy-pasteable recipes, and a section on <a href="https://github.com/ahujasid/blender-mcp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Blender MCP</a> integration. An agent can read the docs, generate a part, export it, import it into Blender, position a camera, and render a preview — all in one conversation.</p>
<p>Every render in this post was made that way. Claude generated the geometry with vcad, imported each STL/GLB into Blender via MCP, set up studio lighting, and rendered to PNG. No human touched Blender.</p>
<p>The feedback loop is: describe a part → code generates → mesh exports → render previews → iterate. All in the terminal.</p>

<p dir="auto"><strong>Time Station Emulator</strong> turns almost any phone or tablet into a low-frequency
radio transmitter broadcasting a time signal that can synchronize most
radio-controlled (“atomic”) clocks and watches.</p>
<p dir="auto">Real time signal broadcasts are limited in geographic range and notoriously
prone to interference in urban areas, so many such clocks end up never actually
using their self-setting functionality. <strong>Time Station Emulator</strong> may allow
setting such clocks when/where a suitable signal is not otherwise available.</p>

<p dir="auto">The hard requirements of note are browser WebAssembly support and DAC support
for ≥44.1 KHz PCM. Almost any device running a browser from ≥2019 should
work.</p>
<p dir="auto">However, as of early 2024, <strong>Safari on iOS</strong> and <strong>Firefox on Android</strong> have
multiple breaking issues and <strong>will not work</strong>.</p>
<p dir="auto">For other devices, <strong>Time Station Emulator</strong> works best with a
<strong>built-in speaker</strong> of a <strong>phone or tablet</strong>. See
<a href="#technical-details">Technical Details</a> for an explanation.</p>

<p dir="auto"><strong>Choose emulator settings.</strong></p>
<p dir="auto">The most important setting is which time station to emulate. Certain settings
are only available for certain stations.</p>
<p dir="auto">Clocks (or watches) that support more than one station may prefer one of them
over the others.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Choose any clock settings and place the clock into sync mode.</strong></p>
<p dir="auto">If your clock has them, try to choose station and/or time zone settings that
make sense for your location.</p>
<p dir="auto">Most clocks provide a way to force a synchronization attempt. You will
probably have to navigate menus and/or press physical buttons.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Position the speaker as close as possible to the clock’s antenna.</strong></p>
<p dir="auto">The transmission range is quite short, so positioning is crucial. Some
experimentation will probably be required, especially if you’re unsure where
the antenna is.</p>
<p dir="auto">The volume should be set so that the clock picks up the cleanest signal.
Usually, this occurs at or near the maximum possible volume.</p>

<p dir="auto"><strong>Time Station Emulator</strong> generates an audio waveform intentionally crafted to
create, when played back through consumer-grade audio hardware, the right kind
of RF noise to be mistaken for a time station broadcast.</p>
<p dir="auto">Specifically, given a fundamental carrier frequency used by a real time station,
it generates and modulates the highest odd-numbered subharmonic that also falls
below the Nyquist frequencies of common playback sample rates.</p>
<p dir="auto">One of the higher-frequency harmonics inevitably created by any real-world DAC
during playback will then be the original fundamental, which should leak to the
environment as a short-range radio transmission via the ad-hoc antenna formed by
the physical wires and circuit traces in the audio output path.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>If you have Chrome Canary installed with the 'Experimental Web Platform features' flag enabled, you can now try out a new HTML <code>meta</code> tag:</p><pre><code><span><span><span><span>&lt;</span>meta</span> <span>name</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>text-scale<span>"</span></span> <span>content</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>scale<span>"</span></span> <span>/&gt;</span></span></span></code></pre><p>This is a feature that I proposed at the CSS Working Group back in Summer 2024 and developed with a lot of help from David Grogan and Philip Rogers from the Google Chrome team. <a href="https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/blob/main/css-env-1/explainers/meta-text-scale.md">You can read the full explainer here.</a> I'm delighted that is finally in the <a href="https://drafts.csswg.org/css-fonts-5/#text-scale-meta">CSS Fonts 5 specification</a> and supported in a browser behind a flag!</p><h2 id="heading-what-is-it">What is it?<a href="#heading-what-is-it"><span> permalink</span></a></h2><p>Have you ever noticed that when you increase the system text size in your iOS or Android phone's accessibility settings, the text gets bigger everywhere except on the web?</p><p>On Safari and Chrome, it makes absolutely no difference.</p><p><img src="https://www.joshtumath.uk/images/2026-01-27-meta-scale-comparison-before.png" alt="If an Android user increases their text scale on their display size and text settings page, website text doesn't get bigger in Chrome. It looks the same." loading="lazy" width="693" height="374"></p><p>Interestingly though, on Firefox for Android, the browser does a full page zoom. But that's very different to text scaling.</p><p>And that's not great, because <a href="https://appt.org/en/stats/font-size">research by Appt</a> shows around 37% of Android users and 34% of iOS users have changed their system-level text scale factor from the default. And web developers currently have no way to respect that.</p><p>The new <code>&lt;meta name=text-scale&gt;</code> tag is here to fix that. Just like how the <code>&lt;meta name=viewport&gt;</code> tag tells the browser that your website is designed to work for small viewport sizes, the <code>&lt;meta name=text-scale&gt;</code> tells the browser, 'Hey, I've designed my website to still work if the user increases their OS text size.'</p><p>The plan is: once you have <code>&lt;meta name=text-scale&gt;</code> on your page, the text will respect the user's text size preference.</p><p>Here's how the BBC website looks with <code>&lt;meta name=text-scale&gt;</code>.</p><p><img src="https://www.joshtumath.uk/images/2026-01-27-meta-scale-bbc-homepage.png" alt="Screenshot of the BBC homepage on a mobile sized viewport using the meta tag. All of the text is double the size." loading="lazy" width="1066" height="800"></p><h2 id="heading-why-do-i-have-to-enable-it-why-can't-browsers-do-it-anyway">Why do I have to enable it? Why can't browsers do it anyway?<a href="#heading-why-do-i-have-to-enable-it-why-can't-browsers-do-it-anyway"><span> permalink</span></a></h2><p>This can't be enabled everywhere. Trust me. It would be a bad idea.</p><p>Users of desktop browsers can already increase a website's text size, but it's a hidden feature these days. Here's what happens if someone doubles the text size on LinkedIn in Firefox.</p><p><img src="https://www.joshtumath.uk/images/2026-01-27-linkedin.png" alt="Screenshot of LinkedIn with 200% text scaling. A lot of text is squashed and truncated in the navigation bar and on someone's post." loading="lazy" width="1588" height="1002"></p><p>It's a car crash. And I don't mean to single out LinkedIn. There are many examples. In fact, most of our websites probably would look something like this.</p><p>And this is just on large desktop viewports. Imagine what would happen if we enabled this on mobile devices!</p><p>Even on smaller viewports, users should be able to increase the text size up to 200% without having to horizontally scroll. The relevant WCAG 2.2 guidelines are <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#resize-text">1.4.4 Resize Text</a> and <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#reflow">1.4.10 Reflow</a>.</p><p>So that is why it's necessary for us to opt-in. Just like how from 2008 – when the first smartphones came out – it was necessary for us to opt-in to supporting mobile viewports.</p><h2 id="heading-how-do-i-support-text-scaling-on-my-website">How do I support text scaling on my website?<a href="#heading-how-do-i-support-text-scaling-on-my-website"><span> permalink</span></a></h2><p>You shouldn't wait for all browsers to support <code>&lt;meta name=text-scale&gt;</code> before you support text scaling. It's something we all should be supporting anyway but probably haven't been testing for. Desktop browsers have recently been hiding their text sizing features in favour of zoom. And we've all probably been testing zoom instead.</p><p>Zoom increases everything, including images, padding, margins, gaps. <em>Everything.</em> And that's regardless of whether you're using <code>em</code> units or <code>px</code> units.</p><p>True text scaling is different. It only changes the default font size.</p><p>You've probably been taught a best practice similar to this: always use font-relative length units in your CSS, like <code>em</code> or <code>rem</code>, not absolute units like <code>px</code> or <code>cm</code>. If you use <code>px</code> units, your website won't support text resizing.</p><p>That is mostly true, but it doesn't mean you can <em>never</em> use <code>px</code> units.</p><p>These are my three basic tips for supporting text scaling.</p><h3 id="heading-tip-1:-don't-override-the-initial-font-size">Tip 1: Don't override the initial font size<a href="#heading-tip-1:-don't-override-the-initial-font-size"><span> permalink</span></a></h3><p>The default font size comes from the initial value of the CSS <code>font-size</code> property. If an author doesn't specify a size, the initial <code>font-size</code> is <code>medium</code>. But what is <code>medium</code>? Typically it's 16px. But on desktop browsers, users can change it to whatever they want.</p><p>This is ultimately what the <code>&lt;meta name=text-scale&gt;</code> tag does: when the tag is present and once browsers support it, mobile users will be able to change the default font size as well.</p><p>So if you override the default font size, the <code>&lt;meta name=text-scale&gt;</code> tag will have no effect.</p><pre><code><span><span>&lt;!-- 👎 Don't do this --&gt;</span></span><br><span></span><br><span><span><span><span>&lt;</span>meta</span> <span>name</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>text-scale<span>"</span></span> <span>content</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>scale<span>"</span></span> <span>/&gt;</span></span></span><br><span></span><br><span><span><span>&lt;</span>style</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span><span><br><span>  <span>:root</span> <span>{</span></span><br><span>    <span>font-size</span><span>:</span> 16px<span>;</span></span><br><span>  <span>}</span></span><br></span></span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>style</span><span>&gt;</span></span></code></pre><p>Ideally, don't touch it. Or use percentage values to modify it.</p><h3 id="heading-tip-2:-only-use-font-relative-units-for-content">Tip 2: Only use font-relative units for content<a href="#heading-tip-2:-only-use-font-relative-units-for-content"><span> permalink</span></a></h3><p>Text scaling doesn't need to replicate zoom. If you use font-relative units like <code>em</code> and <code>rem</code> everywhere that you set a length, everything will scale up the same way as browser zoom.</p><p>Instead, only use font-relative units on things like text, images and icons. You don't need to use it on properties like <code>margin</code>, <code>padding</code> or <code>gap</code>.</p><p>If you do that, there's more room for the content, which is especially important on portrait mobile devices.</p><p>What about <code>border-width</code>, though? I think borders generally count as content, but you need to think of the use case. A button or text box border should get thicker, but a divider line between list items is arguably aesthetic and you could define its width using <code>px</code> units.</p><p><img src="https://www.joshtumath.uk/images/2026-01-27-scale-content-not-spacing.png" alt="Screenshot of the CBBC website with text scaled by 200%. The text and images are larger but the padding and gaps are the same." loading="lazy" width="1588" height="1002"></p><h3 id="heading-tip-3:-test-test-test">Tip 3: Test, test, test<a href="#heading-tip-3:-test-test-test"><span> permalink</span></a></h3><p>Try to simulate a user on a cheap smartphone who has doubled their text scale.</p><p>On a desktop browser, open the viewport tester in the dev tools and set the viewport to 320px width. Then, change the text scale to 200%. <a href="https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/blob/main/css-env-1/explainers/env-preferred-text-scale.md#ua-level-font-setting">See the <code>env(preferred-text-scale)</code> explainer for how to do that in each browser.</a></p><p>If you do that, you'll quickly see the problem areas. Think about how to adapt your layout to fit very large text.</p><h2 id="heading-what's-next">What's next?<a href="#heading-what's-next"><span> permalink</span></a></h2><p>There's more to think about, but I hope that's enough to get you started!</p><p>Hopefully the other browsers will start to support it later in the year, but I've not heard any information about it.</p><p>There is one problem we're still thinking about: how do we get large text to scale at a lower rate than body text. It's great that the body text can scale up from 16px to 32px, but does heading text need to scale up from 32px to 64px? It's already huge. If you have any thoughts, please do let me know!</p><p>I'll be talking more about this at <a href="https://cssday.nl/">CSS Day 2026 in June.</a> I hope to see you there! And I'm sure there will be more documentation published about text scaling later in the year. I think it's an area we're all lacking experience with after relying on browser zoom to keep us going for so long.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div><p>One thing I've learnt from movie production is actually what separates professional from amateur quality is in the audio itself. Have you thought about implementing personaplex from NVDIA or other voice models that can both talk and listen at the same time?</p><p>Currently the conversation still feels too STT-LLM-TTS that I think a lot of the voice agents suffer from (Seems like only Sesame and NVDIA so far have nailed the natural conversation flow). Still, crazy good work train your own diffusion models, I remember taking a look at the latest literature on diffusion and was mind blown by the advances in last years or so since u-net architecture days.</p><p>EDIT: I see that the primary focus is on video generation not audio.</p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr id="46786768"><td><table><tbody><tr><td indent="1"><img src="https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif" height="1" width="40"></td><td><center><a id="up_46786768" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=46786768&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D46783600"></a></center></td><td><br>
<div><p>This is a good point on audio. Our main priority so far has been reducing latency. In service of that, we were deep in the process of integrating Hume's two-way S2S voice model instead of ElevenLabs. But then we realized that ElevenLabs had made their STT-LLM-TTS pipeline way faster in the past month and left it at that. See our measurements here (they're super interesting): <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/18kq2JKAsSahJ6yn5IJ9gCDf15y7Hje0U0Mn5qVettlg/edit?usp=sharing" rel="nofollow">https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/18kq2JKAsSahJ6yn5IJ9g...</a></p><p>But, to your point, there are many benefits of two-way S2S voice beyond just speed.</p><p>Using our LiveKit integration you can use LemonSlice with any voice provider you like. The current S2S providers LiveKit offers include OpenAI, Gemini, and Grok and I'm sure they'll add Personaplex soon.</p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr id="46787511"><td></td></tr><tr id="46793321"><td><table><tbody><tr><td indent="0"><img src="https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif" height="1" width="0"></td><td><center><a id="up_46793321" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=46793321&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D46783600"></a></center></td><td><br>

<div><p>I asked the Spanish tutor if he/it was familiar with the terms seseo[0] and ceceo[1] and he said it wasn't, which surprised me. Ideally it would be possible to choose which Spanish dialect to practise as mainland Spain pronunciation is very different to Latin America. In general it didn't convince me it was really hearing how I was pronouncing words, an important part of learning a language. I would say the tutor is useful for intermediate and advanced speakers but not beginners due to this and the speed at which he speaks.</p><p>At one point subtitles written in pseudo Chinese characters were shown; I can send a screenshot if this is useful.</p><p>The latency was slightly distracting, and as others have commented the NVIDIA Personaplex demos [2] are very impressive in this regard.</p><p>In general, a very positive experience, thank you.</p><p>[0] <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phonological_history_of_Spanish_coronal_fricatives#Seseo" rel="nofollow">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phonological_history_of_Spanis...</a>

The administration’s opponents have used group text chats to track Immigration and Customs Enforcement operations, share photos of suspected ICE vehicles and raise awareness for neighbors. In June, administration officials <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/iceblock-app-ice-agent-sightings-tops-app-store-white-house-backlash-rcna216327" target="_blank">criticized ICEBlock</a>, an app designed to share information about ICE sightings. Apple <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/apple-removes-iceblock-app-criticism-trump-administration-rcna235333" target="_blank">removed the app</a> from its app store in October, prompting a lawsuit <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/iceblock-developer-sues-trump-administration-app-removal-apple-store-rcna248045" target="_blank">from the app’s developer</a> alleging the administration unlawfully pressured Apple to remove it. </p><p id="anchor-00f834">In the past few days, the group text chats — especially those on the encrypted messaging app Signal — have drawn attention from right-wing media. On Saturday, Cam Higby, a conservative journalist based near Seattle, said in a thread on X that he had “infiltrated” Signal groups from around Minneapolis that he alleged were obstructing law enforcement. His thread, which got <a href="https://x.com/camhigby/status/2015093523733733474" target="_blank">20 million views</a>, focused on how the groups share such information as the license plate numbers of suspected federal vehicles. NBC News has not verified Higby’s claims.</p><p id="anchor-80b9bf">Patel said he got the idea for the investigation from Higby.</p><p id="anchor-33975a">“As soon as Higby put that post out, I opened an investigation on it,” he said. “We immediately opened up that investigation, because that sort of Signal chat — being coordinated with individuals not just locally in Minnesota, but maybe even around the country — if that leads to a break in the federal statute or a violation of some law, then we are going to arrest people.”</p><p id="anchor-b23e67">The Signal Foundation, the nonprofit organization that operates the Signal app, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. </p><p id="anchor-32952d">Signal, which is considered one of the most secure chat apps, is <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/security/signal-app-used-hegseth-can-leave-door-open-hackers-rcna197956" target="_blank">a go-to resource</a> for people concerned about privacy.  It is perhaps best known as the app Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth used to share <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/national-security/pentagon-inspector-general-investigation-signalgate-complete-rcna247030" target="_blank">sensitive military information</a> last year in a group chat that accidentally included a journalist.</p><p id="anchor-9d0775">In the Twin Cities, Signal group chats have been a <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/minneapolis-school-patrols-ice-immigration-surge-rcna254477" target="_blank">standard part of toolkits</a> — along with walkie-talkies and whistles — used by activists, parents and neighborhood-watch members who have organized as volunteers to warn families about immigration enforcement activities by relaying real-time information, especially near schools. Patrol volunteers have said that, with <a href="https://www.fox9.com/news/ice-minnesota-how-many-feds-minnesota" target="_blank">more than 3,000</a> federal immigration agents in Minnesota, they are motivated by a desire to protect parents, children and school staff members who are not U.S. citizens.</p><p id="anchor-c5ebe7">Patel did not say which laws he thought Minnesota residents may have violated. An FBI spokesperson said the bureau had no further information to provide.</p><p id="anchor-2e2534">The announcement seemed likely to have implications for the First Amendment’s guarantee of free speech. Alex Abdo, litigation director at the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University, said the First Amendment protects the right to record law enforcement officers as they carry out their official responsibilities.</p><p id="anchor-3ecfcf">“The ability of everyday citizens to hold government agents to account, by observing them and advocating for change, is what has distinguished the American experiment with democracy from authoritarian regimes around the world,” Abdo said in an email.</p><p id="anchor-29aaea">“Unless the FBI has evidence of a crime, and not just evidence of activity the Constitution protects, it should stand down,” he said.</p><p id="anchor-2fc1ab">Patel acknowledged in the interview with Johnson that an investigation into group text chats would raise free speech concerns and said the FBI <a href="https://youtu.be/MwG5jS0cL9E?si=ue_6WtIujZzYbrWV&amp;t=279" target="_blank">would “balance” the rights</a> guaranteed by the First and Second amendments with what he said were potential violations of federal law.</p><p id="anchor-5ee288">“Now, we will balance the First and Second amendment constantly, but we have to let the community know that we will not tolerate acts of violence and an escalation and a violation of the federal code,” he said. The Second Amendment <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-administration/trump-administration-second-amendment-rights-minneapolis-shooting-rcna255784" target="_blank">could be at issue</a> because Alex Pretti, the nurse shot and killed by a federal agent Saturday in Minneapolis, was permitted to carry a gun in public and had one with him.</p><p id="anchor-153bf9">Terr, of the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, said the government does not get to “balance” the First Amendment against its other interests.</p><p id="anchor-ef9959">“The Constitution takes precedence over any conflicting state or federal law, and over any official’s desire to suppress speech they dislike,” he said in his email.</p><p id="anchor-e709cd">He added: “There is a First Amendment exception for speech intended and likely to provoke imminent unlawful action, but that doesn’t apply to just any speech the government claims puts officials in harm’s way. By contrast, if individuals are threatening federal agents or conspiring to physically harm them, that is illegal. But conspiracy requires an agreement to commit a specific crime and a substantial step toward carrying it out.”</p><p id="anchor-e530b0">Patel also said the FBI had made “substantial progress” in an investigation into groups and people responsible for funding resistance to immigration enforcement. He alleged that the protests and neighborhood monitoring are “not happening organically” but did not immediately provide evidence.</p></div><div><div data-activity-map="expanded-byline-article-bottom"><p>David Ingram is a tech reporter for NBC News.</p></div><div><p>Ryan J.

<p>The Department of Homeland Security now says that two weeks of critical surveillance footage from within Immigrations and Customs Enforcement’s Broadview detention center wasn’t actually lost in a “system crash,” but rather, was never recorded in the first place. It is also arguing that, had the footage been recorded, it would be irrelevant because prisoner living conditions have improved since the time it was supposed to be recorded.</p><p><a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/projects/223855-ice-broadview/?ref=404media.co" rel="noreferrer">The filings</a>, made by U.S. attorneys on behalf of Greg Bovino, Kristi Noem, and other DHS officials, are the latest in an ongoing class action lawsuit against the U.S. government filed by detainees at the Chicago-area ICE detention center. The people suing the government in this case argue that they were held in <a href="https://www.404media.co/two-weeks-of-surveillance-footage-from-ice-detention-center-irretrievably-destroyed/"><u>subhuman, illegal conditions at Broadview</u></a>: “They are denied sufficient food and water […] the temperatures are extreme and uncomfortable […] the physical conditions are filthy, with poor sanitation, clogged toilets, and blood, human fluids, and insects in the sinks and the floor […] federal officers who patrol Broadview under Defendants’ authority are abusive and cruel,” their complaint reads in part.</p><p>As we <a href="https://www.404media.co/two-weeks-of-surveillance-footage-from-ice-detention-center-irretrievably-destroyed/"><u>have reported</u></a>, the plaintiffs’ lawyers have been trying to get the government to produce nearly two weeks worth of surveillance footage from inside the detention center from between October 20 and October 31, 2025, which was a critical period where ICE was detaining people en masse in Chicago. The government first said that the footage had been “irretrievably destroyed,” but that it was working with its vendor, a one-person company called Five by Five, to try to recover it. In a later filing, it <a href="https://www.404media.co/ice-says-critical-evidence-in-broadview-abuse-case-was-lost-in-system-crash-a-day-after-it-was-sued/"><u>said that the footage was lost due to a nonspecific</u></a> “system crash.”&nbsp;</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://allenai.org/blog/open-coding-agents">https://allenai.org/blog/open-coding-agents</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46783017">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="main-content"><div><p>Over the past year, coding agents have transformed how developers write, test, and maintain software. These systems can debug, refactor, and even submit pull requests—fundamentally changing what software development looks like. Yet despite this progress, most coding agents share the same constraints: they're closed, expensive to train, and difficult to study or adapt to private codebases.</p><p><strong>Ai2 Open Coding Agents</strong> change that. Today we’re releasing not just a collection of strong open coding models, but a training method that makes building your own coding agent for any codebase – for example, your personal codebase or an internal codebase at your organization – remarkably accessible for tasks including code generation, code review, debugging, maintenance, and code explanation.</p><p>Closed models haven't seen your internal code, so they don't know it—custom data pipelines, internal APIs, specific org conventions, and so on. Training on your private data teaches them, but generating synthetic training data from private codebases that works for agents has been challenging and cost-prohibitive. Our method makes it easy—reproducing the performance of the previously best open-source model costs ~$400 of compute, or up to $12,000 for performance that rivals the best industry models of the same size. This puts the full recipe within reach for labs and small teams.&nbsp;</p><p>Resource constraints drove us to maximize efficiency at every stage, from data quality to inference costs to model selection. The result: we match SWE-smith, a synthetic data method, at 57× lower cost and SkyRL, an open-source reinforcement learning (RL) system, at 26× lower cost.</p><p>The first release in our Open Coding Agents family is <strong>SERA</strong> (Soft-verified Efficient Repository Agents). The strongest – SERA-32B – solves 54.2% of SWE-Bench Verified problems,&nbsp; surpassing prior open-source state-of-the-art coding models of comparable sizes and context lengths while requiring only 40 GPU days (or fewer) to train on a cluster of 2 NVIDIA Hopper GPUs or NVIDIA RTX PRO 6000 Blackwell Server Edition GPUs. SERA models are optimized and compatible with Claude Code out of the box. With our fine-tuning method, you can specialize them to your own codebase including your full engineering stack and conventions quickly and at low cost.</p><p>We collaborated with NVIDIA to optimize SERA inference for their accelerated infrastructure, ensuring researchers and developers can get the most out of these models in production environments. Early benchmarks are promising: running in BF16 precision on 4xH100 GPUs, SERA achieves approximately 1,950 peak output tokens per second with a 16k context window. At FP8 precision, SERA reaches 3,700 peak output tokens per second—a higher throughput at almost negligible accuracy drop. On next-generation Blackwell 4xB200 systems running in NVFP4, SERA scales further to around 8,600 peak output tokens per second.</p><p>Every component of this release is open – models, Claude Code integration, and training recipes – and can be launched with a single line of code, making it easy to use even for those without LLM training experience. We're also releasing state-of-the-art training data so researchers can inspect what worked and push it further, and conduct deep science while avoiding the many stumbling blocks, dead ends, and other roadblocks typical of coding agents.</p><p>One result we're especially excited about: SERA uniquely enables adapting to private datasets like internal codebases, and we see evidence that a smaller, open model can replicate and possibly even exceed the performance of a more capable "teacher" coding agent in these setups. For example, SERA-32B can surpass its 110B parameter teacher (GLM-4.5-Air) on codebases like Django and Sympy after training on just 8,000 samples at a cost of $1,300.&nbsp;</p><p>Accessible open models can now inherit strong agentic behavior through a simple, reproducible pipeline—no large-scale RL infrastructure or engineering team required. Case in point, SERA was built largely by a single Ai2 researcher.</p><h3>The challenge: specializing agents to your data</h3><p>If you’re a small to mid-sized business or independent developer, you probably have code that works with customer data in ways no public model has ever seen. Training on that data would help, but generating agent-ready synthetic data from private codebases has been the hard part. The holy grail would be a method that yields state-of-the-art training data for any codebase, with minimal setup and clear evidence that the tuned model is actually learning agentic behavior versus fragile heuristics.</p><p>We tackle this challenge with our new post-training approach that achieves state-of-the-art open-source results on SWE-Bench at a fraction of the typical training costs. Two innovations make it both inexpensive and effective:</p><ul><li><strong>Soft-verified generation (SVG).</strong> Synthetic training data generation, which is key to training a strong coding agent, is usually done by generating pairs of code examples that have both incorrect and corrected code. From these examples, the coding agent can learn how to transform incorrect code into correct code by generating a patch with line-by-line code changes. Usually, these examples need to be carefully tested to ensure that they’re actually correct. In SVG, our main finding is that patches don’t need to be correct to be helpful for coding. Just like different code can lead to the same, correct solution, with SVG we generate synthetic training data by having patches that are only partially correct. This removes the need to thoroughly test for full correctness, which in turn alleviates the need for complex infrastructure for testing and costly generation of precise examples. We demonstrate that this soft-verified data scales exactly like "hard-verified" training data.</li><li><strong>Scaling with a bug-type menu.</strong> To diversify data without becoming bottlenecked on finding real bugs, we draw from a taxonomy of 51 common bug patterns identified in prior analyses. For each function in a repository, we can generate multiple distinct bug-style prompts—so a repo with thousands of functions can yield tens of thousands of varied agentic trajectories at low cost.</li><li><strong>High simulated workflow fidelity. </strong>A key finding is that high-quality synthetic training data should mirror the workflow of a developer rather than the precise details of correct code. This means correct coding data is less important than data that reflects how a developer works on a problem. Combined with SVG, this insight enables repository training<em>: </em>generating training data for any code repository, making it straightforward to scale synthetic data generation massively.</li></ul><p>Together, these innovations mean that if you or your organization has a private codebase, you can use SERA to fine-tune a small model to strong performance on your data—easily and affordably. Instead of designing a complicated RL pipeline and test harness for every new task setting, you generate targeted synthetic data and run a straightforward supervised fine-tuning (SFT) job.</p><h3>State-of-the-art performance, accessible hardware</h3><p>Using SERA, we've developed a family of models ranging from 8B to 32B parameters, all built on Qwen3 and trained up to 32K context length with the help of various teacher models. We expect the same recipe to keep improving as we scale to larger backbones and context lengths, but the key point is that the current pipeline is already cheap and feasible for anyone to run, customize, and iterate on today—opening up wide access and endless possibilities for future research.</p><p>Our efficient technique enabled highly precise science. By keeping costs low, we could systematically disentangle the many factors that have made comparisons between agentic systems unreliable. This rigorous methodology drove rapid iteration, leading us from soft-verified generation to the full SERA approach.&nbsp;</p><p>When we align inference conditions for fair comparison, SERA performs competitively with leading open coding agents. At 32K context, <strong>SERA-32B</strong> achieves 49.5% ± 1.9% on SWE-Bench Verified, comparable to Devstral Small 2 (50.0% ± 1.3%) and GLM-4.5-Air (50.5% ± 1.3%). At 64K context, SERA-32B reaches 54.2% ± 1.4%—competitive with longer-context baselines.&nbsp;</p><p>Strong closed-weight coding agents like Devstral Small 2 are an important point of comparison. When we control for key variables, SERA-32B comes close: within ~0.5 points at 32K and ~4.9 points at 64K compared to Devstral Small 2 despite SERA being pure SFT and not trained beyond 32K tokens, both of which disadvantage longer-context evaluation.&nbsp;</p><p>We also explored how teacher strength affects results. GLM-4.6 yields our best numbers, but GLM-4.5-Air gets surprisingly close at lower cost. The gap between teachers becomes most meaningful in higher-compute regimes—suggesting that depending on your budget and target performance, a weaker (and cheaper) teacher can be the better overall choice, especially for early iterations.</p><p>To validate our synthetic data generation strategy, we tested repository-specific specialization on Django, SymPy, and Sphinx—the three largest repositories in SWE-Bench. Because these have actual test instances, we can quantify how well specialization works in practice. This serves as a proxy for the downstream use case we care most about: adapting to private codebases that may lack comprehensive tests or follow nonstandard structures.</p><p>The results are promising. Our specialized models – trained on 8,000 synthetic trajectories per repository – consistently match and often exceed the performance of the 100B+ parameter models we used as teachers. At 32K context, the specialized models achieve 52.23% on Django and 51.11% on SymPy, compared to GLM-4.5-Air's 51.20% and 48.89%. The gains are most pronounced on Django and SymPy, which together account for over 60% of all SWE-Bench problems.</p><p>These results highlight two crucial advantages of our method. First, specialization pays off: a 32B model fine-tuned to a specific codebase can match or surpass a 100B+ general-purpose teacher, delivering comparable performance at one-third the size with lower memory requirements, faster inference, and reduced operational costs. Second, simplicity scales: our SFT-only pipeline on an open base model is now competitive with heavily engineered, large-team efforts. Together, these findings lower the barrier to entry for researchers, make results easier to reproduce, and turn agentic coding progress into something the whole community can validate and build on.</p><h3>Built for developers and researchers</h3><p>Our release package includes everything needed to reproduce, test, and build on SERA—a lightweight deployment requiring just two lines of code to launch an inference server. We've also developed a setup script and inference optimizations that make SERA directly compatible with Claude Code.</p><figure><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="View Getting started with SERA in Claude Code on YouTube" href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=LfLIi4ZR_jA"><span><img alt="" loading="lazy" decoding="async" data-nimg="fill" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://allenai.org/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FLfLIi4ZR_jA%2Fmaxresdefault.jpg&amp;w=640&amp;q=75 640w, https://allenai.org/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FLfLIi4ZR_jA%2Fmaxresdefault.jpg&amp;w=750&amp;q=75 750w, https://allenai.org/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FLfLIi4ZR_jA%2Fmaxresdefault.jpg&amp;w=828&amp;q=75 828w, https://allenai.org/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FLfLIi4ZR_jA%2Fmaxresdefault.jpg&amp;w=1080&amp;q=75 1080w, https://allenai.org/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FLfLIi4ZR_jA%2Fmaxresdefault.jpg&amp;w=1200&amp;q=75 1200w, https://allenai.org/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FLfLIi4ZR_jA%2Fmaxresdefault.jpg&amp;w=1920&amp;q=75 1920w, https://allenai.org/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FLfLIi4ZR_jA%2Fmaxresdefault.jpg&amp;w=2048&amp;q=75 2048w, https://allenai.org/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FLfLIi4ZR_jA%2Fmaxresdefault.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 3840w" src="https://allenai.org/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FLfLIi4ZR_jA%2Fmaxresdefault.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75"><span><svg><use href="#play-svg"></use></svg></span></span></a></p></figure><p>A key difference from closed-weight systems is our commitment to openness and reproducibility:</p><ul><li>We release <strong>models, code, all generated agent data, and a full recipe to generate your own data</strong> so anyone can reproduce our results or customize them to new domains.&nbsp;</li><li>Our training pipeline is <strong>intentionally simple</strong>—standard SFT on trajectories with no custom RL infrastructure needed.&nbsp;</li><li>The total cost to reproduce performance levels of the best previous open-source result only is <strong>roughly $400</strong> on commodity cloud GPUs, more than 25 times cheaper than many existing approaches that require complex distributed setups and still fall short on performance.</li><li>The total cost to reproduce top open-weight models in industry, such as Devstral Small 2, is <strong>only $12,000</strong>.</li></ul><p>We believe bringing the cost of replicating strong coding agents down to a few hundred dollars will unlock research that simply wasn't possible before.

              <h2>What Happened</h2>
              <p>In December 2025, <a href="https://au.pcmag.com/security/114866/hackers-steal-limited-data-on-20-of-soundcloud-users" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SoundCloud announced it had discovered unauthorised activity on its platform</a>. The incident allowed an attacker to map publicly available SoundCloud profile data to email addresses for approximately 20% of its users. The impacted data included 30M unique email addresses, names, usernames, avatars, follower and following counts and, in some cases, the user’s country. The attackers later attempted to extort SoundCloud before publicly releasing the data the following month.</p>
