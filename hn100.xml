In 2018, thousands of Google employees protested a Pentagon project, fearing technology they developed could be used for lethal purposes. That proved to be the <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/3-years-maven-uproar-google-warms-pentagon/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">high water mark of Silicon Valley opposition</a> to the Department of Defense, with Google since earning hundreds of millions from its defense contracts. The Pentagon has made <a href="https://www.wsj.com/amp/articles/pentagon-woos-silicon-valley-to-join-ranks-of-arms-makers-38b1d4c0" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a concerted effort</a> in recent years to win over Silicon Valley startups in order to develop new weapons technology and integrate advanced tools into the department’s operations. U.S.-China tensions and Russia’s war in Ukraine have also served to dispel many of the qualms entrepreneurs once had about military collaboration. “What’s emerged lately is a kind of <a href="https://www.semafor.com/article/01/03/2024/defense-tech-is-having-its-moment-in-silicon-valley" rel="noopener" target="_blank">techno-patriotism in Silicon Valley</a>,” wrote Semafor’s technology editor Reed Albergotti.</p></div><div><h3>AI may remake the military, but could come with profound risks</h3><div><p>Wired</p><!-- --><p>, </p><!-- --><p>Vox</p><!-- --><p>, </p><!-- --><p>Foreign Policy</p></div><p>Defense experts have been bullish about the impact AI will have on the military. Former Google CEO Eric Schmidt, now a prominent defense industry figure, has compared the arrival of AI to the <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/eric-schmidt-is-building-the-perfect-ai-war-fighting-machine/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CEinstein%20wrote%20a%20letter%20to,distributed%20systems%20are%20that%20powerful.%E2%80%9D" rel="noopener" target="_blank">advent of nuclear weapons</a>, Wired reported. “Einstein wrote a letter to Roosevelt in the 1930s saying that there is this new technology — nuclear weapons — that could change war, which it clearly did. I would argue that [AI-powered] autonomy and decentralized, distributed systems are that powerful,” Schmidt said. But advocacy groups have warned that integrating AI into warfare could come with profound risks given AI’s tendency to “hallucinate” — make up fake information and pass it off as real — which could have far higher stakes if AI-powered systema wwew integrated into <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2023/11/28/23972547/the-militarized-ai-risk-thats-bigger-than-killer-robots" rel="noopener" target="_blank">command and control systems</a>. The Arms Control Association has warned that the rush to “​​exploit emerging technologies for military use has accelerated at a much faster pace than efforts to assess <a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2023/04/11/ai-arms-race-artificial-intelligence-chatgpt-military-technology/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the dangers they pose</a>.”</p></div><div><h3>OpenAI rules are unclear about scope of possible military deals</h3><div><p>The Information</p><!-- --><p>, </p><!-- --><p>Euromaidan Press</p><!-- --><p>, </p><!-- --><p>The Economist</p></div><p>Although OpenAI has ruled out developing weapons, its new policy would likely allow it to provide <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/chatgpt-coming-to-an-army-near-you" rel="noopener" target="_blank">AI software to the Department of Defense</a> for uses such as helping analysts interpret data or write code, The Information reported. But as the war in Ukraine has shown, the divide between data crunching and warfare may not be as clear-cut as OpenAI would like. Ukraine has developed and imported software <a href="https://euromaidanpress.com/2023/08/09/ground-and-marine-drones-ai-and-javelin-training-simulator-how-ukrainian-military-technology-advancements-bring-country-closer-to-victory/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">to analyze large data</a>, which has allowed its artillery operators to be rapidly notified of Russian targets in the area and dramatically speed up <a href="https://www.economist.com/special-report/2023/07/03/the-war-in-ukraine-shows-how-technology-is-changing-the-battlefield" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the pace at which they can fire</a>. Meanwhile, The Information warned that the change in policy could be enough to reignite the debate over AI safety at OpenAI that contributed to Sam Altman’s brief firing as CEO.</p></div></div><div><p><img src="https://www.semafor.com/_next/static/media/semafor-logo-small.cc0a7c9c.svg" width="19" height="19" alt="Semafor Logo"></p></div></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div role="main" id="maincontent"><article expanded="true"><div data-io-article-url="/2024/01/16/us-app-store-alternative-purchase-option/"><p>Apple is making major changes to its U.S. iOS <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a> policies, and developers are now able to direct customers to a non-App Store purchasing option for digital goods. Apple is allowing apps to feature a single link to a developer website that leads to an in-app purchase alternative, but Apple plans to continue to collect a 12 to 27 percent commission on content bought this way.</p>
<p><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/t/MuYr2cyAEYdr0CMrrvuycUPK5vs=/400x0/article-new/2022/01/iOS-App-Store-General-Feature-JoeBlue.jpg?lossy" srcset="https://images.macrumors.com/t/MuYr2cyAEYdr0CMrrvuycUPK5vs=/400x0/article-new/2022/01/iOS-App-Store-General-Feature-JoeBlue.jpg?lossy 400w,https://images.macrumors.com/t/j81xjhvPhb1xAaD6jc-kW3SoaHc=/800x0/article-new/2022/01/iOS-App-Store-General-Feature-JoeBlue.jpg?lossy 800w,https://images.macrumors.com/t/6S1CCkPCfv7Bu5OKPv07871bKhY=/1600x0/article-new/2022/01/iOS-App-Store-General-Feature-JoeBlue.jpg 1600w,https://images.macrumors.com/t/2D83fOzXH1a-mo51oJaSX0SjmzQ=/2500x0/filters:no_upscale()/article-new/2022/01/iOS-App-Store-General-Feature-JoeBlue.jpg 2500w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 697px" alt="iOS App Store General Feature JoeBlue" width="2250" height="1266"><br>Apple's update and the backstory that led to it are a bit complicated, but what <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> users need to know is that some apps in the U.S. storefront will soon feature a link to their website where subscriptions and other content can be purchased outside of the ‌App Store‌ in-app purchase system, likely with a discounted price.</p>
<p>Developers who want to offer this option will need to apply for a StoreKit External Purchase Link Entitlement, as Apple has outlined in both updated ‌App Store‌ Review Guidelines and the statement of compliance submitted to the Northern California U.S. District Court. With a Link Entitlement, a developer is able to direct a user to an out-of-app purchasing mechanism using an external purchase link. From Apple's modified ‌App Store‌ rules:<br>
</p>
<blockquote><p>Developers may apply for an entitlement to provide a link in their app to a website the developer owns or maintains responsibility for in order to purchase such items. Learn more about the entitlement. In accordance with the entitlement agreement, the link may inform users about where and how to purchase those in-app purchase items, and the fact that such items may be available for a comparatively lower price. The entitlement is limited to use only in the iOS or iPadOS App Store on the United States storefront. In all other storefronts, apps and their metadata may not include buttons, external links, or other calls to action that direct customers to purchasing mechanisms other than in-app purchase.</p>
<p>If your app engages in misleading marketing practices, scams, or fraud in relation to the entitlement, your app will be removed from the App Store and you may be removed from the Apple Developer Program.</p></blockquote>
<p>There are several requirements that developers need to adhere to maintain the privacy and security of the ‌App Store‌ ecosystem, and notably, Apple will collect a commission on purchases made using these Entitlement Links. Rather than 30 percent, Apple will collect a 27 percent fee on user purchases or year-one subscriptions made through the link. On the second year of a subscription, the commission fee drops to 12 percent, which is three percentage points lower than the 15 percent fee that Apple collects from second-year or longer subscriptions made through the in-app purchase system. Apps that participate in the ‌App Store‌ Small Business Program will be charged a 12 percent commission rate.</p>
<p>The commission will apply to transactions for digital goods and services that take place on a developers website within seven days after a user taps through an External Purchase Link to an external website. </p>
<p>Several key points about Entitlement Links are listed below.</p>
<ul>
<li>All links to outside purchasing methods must use the Entitlement Link system, and developers must apply and get Apple's approval.</li>
<li>Developers are permitted to have a single plain link on <strong>one</strong> screen of an app. The link can be at a sign-in screen, in user settings, or elsewhere, but it can only be in one place. The single location may not be an interstitial, modal, or pop-up.</li>
<li>The link can mention the specific price of content on a website, or that content is discounted on the website from the ‌App Store‌ price. Comparisons are allowed.</li>
<li>Links cannot be placed directly on an in-app purchase screen or in the in-app purchase flow.</li>
<li>Developers need to certify that the third-party payment service provider they are using for out-of-app purchasing meets industry standards for payment processors, and that they will offer users processes for managing subscriptions, requesting refunds, and disputing unauthorized transactions.</li>
<li>Apps that participate in Apple's Video Partner Program or News Partner Program are not eligible for Link Entitlement.</li>
<li>Apps that use the StoreKit External Purchase Link must continue to offer in-app purchases as an option.</li>
<li>‌App Store‌ pages are not able to include information about purchasing on a website or a link to a website.</li>
<li>Digital purchases that are sold on an app's website through the Entitlement Link must be available for use in that app.</li>
<li>The StoreKit External Purchase Link cannot discourage users from making in-app purchases or mimic an in-app purchase.</li>
<li>Links must open a new window in the default browser of the device, and are not able to open a web view.</li>
<li>No redirecting, intermediate links, or URL tracking parameters are allowed.</li>
<li>Developers are required to provide a periodic accounting of qualifying out-of-app purchases, and Apple has a right to audit developers' accounting to ensure compliance with their commission obligations and to charge interest and offset payments.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Link Entitlement process and the ‌App Store‌ changes are applicable only in the U.S. ‌App Store‌. Apps for all other storefronts are not able to include buttons, external links, or calls to action that direct customers to alternative purchasing options.</p>

<p>The changes today stem from Apple's 2021 legal battle with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/epic-games/">Epic Games</a>. Apple won the dispute and the court did not find that Apple had violated U.S. antitrust law, but Apple was at the time ordered to remove "anti-steering" rules preventing developers from informing customers about alternatives to in-app purchases. That order has been on hold <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/07/17/app-store-rule-change-epic-games-delayed/">during the appeals process</a>, but the appeals process ended today.</p>
<p>Both Apple and ‌Epic Games‌ <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/28/apple-epic-appeal-supreme-court/">had appealed</a> to the United States Supreme Court, but the Supreme Court <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/16/supreme-court-declines-to-hear-apple-vs-epic-case/">declined to hear the case</a>. That means the initial ruling and the appeals court ruling that agreed with it are permanent, and Apple now has to comply with the part of that order that required it to change the ‌App Store‌ rules.</p>
<p>The anti-steering rule was two-pronged, requiring Apple to allow for links to in-app purchase alternatives and to allow developers to communicate with customers outside of the ‌App Store‌ through email and other contact information collected in the app. The outside communication part of the order was already satisfied with a change that Apple made to the ‌App Store‌ rules in 2021 to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/26/app-store-changes-developer-lawsuit-settlement/">settle a class-action developer lawsuit</a>.</p>
<p>Apple has already been allowing developers to use communication methods like email to inform customers about payment methods available outside of iOS apps, and Apple makes it clear in its messaging today that there are no limits on developers' out-of-app communications with users. The full statements that Apple provided to the court have been obtained by <em>MacRumors</em> and can be read below. </p>


<p><b>Update:</b> ‌Epic Games‌ CEO Tim Sweeney criticized Apple's ‌App Store‌ changes and said that Epic plans to contest Apple's "bad-faith compliance plan" in District Court. </p>

          <h3>Fluorite lenses: Corrective capabilities beyond the limits of ordinary optical glass</h3>

          <p><img src="https://global.canon/ja/c-museum/common/img/special/exhibition2-1.jpg" alt="Fluorite lenses: Corrective capabilities beyond the limits of ordinary optical glass"></p><p>One crucial material that supports the high image quality characteristic of Canon lenses is fluorite, which is a crystallized form of calcium fluoride. It has long been known that using a fluorite lens in conjunction with a
            glass lens can reduce chromatic aberration to extremely low levels. However, natural fluorite occurs in small sizes that are suitable only for use in small optical equipment such as the object lenses of microscopes. Canon, in its pursuit
            of progress in imaging capabilities, was keen on utilizing fluorite in its photography lenses, set out to develop its own technology for forming large, high-purity artificial fluorite crystals using fluorite ore as a raw material. In May
            1969, the <a href="https://global.canon/en/c-museum/product/fl117.html">FL-F300mm f/5.6</a>—the world’s first consumer telephoto lens to employ fluorite lens elements—was released.</p>

          
          <h4>How fluorite lens elements correct chromatic aberration</h4>
          <p>You might have noticed the outlines of your subjects tinted in a way that resembles a color fringe. This is chromatic aberration, and it can also take the form of a haziness throughout the entire image. As this prevents the subject
              from being rendered accurately, it needs to be corrected so that the image quality is sharp, clear, and faithful to the scene.</p>
          <div>
            <p><img src="https://global.canon/ja/c-museum/common/img/special/exhibition2-2.jpg" alt="The purple fringing at the edges if these branches is a form of chromatic aberration."></p><p>The purple fringing at the edges if these branches is a form of chromatic aberration.</p>
          </div>
          
          <p>Chromatic aberration happens because when light passes through a glass surface, the different-colored waves within it (red, green, blue, etc.) are refracted at different angles due to their different lengths, with each
            color converging at a different focal point. Such aberration is usually corrected by using a combination of concave and convex lenses, which refract the light in opposite directions to each other.</p>
          <p><img src="https://global.canon/ja/c-museum/common/img/special/exhibition2-3_en.jpg" alt="Chromatic aberration correction using concave and convex glass lenses">

          </p>
          
          <p><strong>Chromatic aberration correction using concave and convex glass lenses</strong></p>
          <p>However, it is not possible to correct the chromatic aberration on all wavelengths by using ordinary glass. The chromatic aberration, which occurs on certain wavelengths such as red, is called residual chromatic
            aberration. As the refractive index of the wavelengths differ depending on the type of optical glass, there are limitations to how much residual chromatic aberration can be mitigated depending on the combination and properties of the
            optical glass. </p>
          <p>This is where fluorite comes in handy. As fluorite is a fundamentally different material than conventional optical glass, it can be used in combination with glass to correct chromatic aberration more effectively. It is
            particularly effective on telephoto lenses, where the long focal length exacerbates chromatic aberration.</p>

          </p>
          
          <p><strong>Chromatic aberration correction using a convex fluorite lens and a concave glass lens</strong></p>
          <p>Canon’s fluorite lens elements incorporate natural fluorite as a raw material, endowing the lenses with low-refractive, low-dispersion properties not possible with glass lenses. Fluorite lenses are also unique in their
            extraordinary partial dispersion tendencies: the red to green wavelengths are dispersed with the same tendencies as glass, but the green to blue wavelengths are dispersed more than glass. Using a convex fluorite lens element alongside a
            high-dispersion glass concave lens element therefore eliminates residual chromatic aberration, making possible a lens that produces clear, sharp, and high-quality images.</p>

            <div>
              <h5><strong>Refraction and dispersion</strong></h5>
              <p>‘Refraction’ is the phenomenon in which light changes direction when it passes through the surface of a material such as glass. The degree of the directional change is called the ‘refractive index’. As the refractive
                index varies depending on the color constituents (wavelengths) of the light, each color bends in a different direction. This is known as color dispersion. On optical glass, dispersion occurs at a fixed proportion regardless of the
                wavelength, whereas on fluorite, dispersion occurs at different proportions for different wavelengths and is known as ‘extraordinary partial dispersion’. </p>
            </div>
            
          </div>
          
          <h4>The emergence of fluorite lenses and how they improve the image quality of telephoto lenses</h4>
          <p>Fluorite lenses transcend traditional limitations to reduce chromatic aberration to an extremely low level. These lenses have their origins the Canon F Project, which started in August 1966. Canon’s lens developers strongly
            believed that to create a lens that was performed better than existing lenses, it was first necessary to create a new material, and it was this conviction that drive them to establish the technology for producing artificial fluorite
            crystals to use in camera lenses.</p>
          <p>The challenge in producing artificial fluorite crystals lay in the crystallization. The term “glass” was originally used to describe the state of a material. Being non-crystalline, it consists of atoms fixed in random
            positions--simply melting glass allows it to be processed into different shapes. On the other hand, fluorite is a crystalline substance, and its constituent atoms must be arranged in a specific configuration for it to crystalize. </p>
          <p>To pulverize natural fluorite, purify it, and then restore the exact atomic structure to recrystallize it into a size large enough for application in a camera lens is a near-impossible feat. Therefore, the developers had to
            ensure a precisely controlled vacuum environment where the temperature is kept at least 1,000℃, so they designed an apparatus to artificially produce large crystals with high purity In 1968, two years after the F project started, Canon
            finally managed to overcome these obstacles to successfully form artificial fluorite crystals large enough to be used in camera lenses. </p>
          <div>
            <p><img src="https://global.canon/ja/c-museum/common/img/special/exhibition2-8.jpg" alt="natural fluorite crystals">
            </p>
            <p>The stones on the left are natural fluorite crystals. They are green and purple due to impurities within the crystals. At the middle is an artificial fluorite crystal ingot produced by Canon.<br>When heated, natural
                fluorite glows with a dreamy light that resembles that of fireflies, which is said to be the reason behind its Japanese name, <i>hotaru ishi</i>, literally “firefly stone”. Just like how fireflies require clean water to live, only
                pure fluorite can “shine” as photography lenses.</p>
            
          </div>
          
          <p>Another challenge in fluorite lens production is its polishing. As fluorite is softer and more delicate than glass, the same methods used for polishing glass are not suitable. Therefore, Canon developed a special technology
            for polishing fluorite lenses that requires up to four times longer than the time needed to polish ordinary optical glass. This technology was successfully commercialized the following year, in May 1969.
          </p>
          <p><img src="https://global.canon/ja/c-museum/common/img/special/exhibition2-9.jpg" alt="The first lens to employ fluorite lens elements was the FL-F300mm f/5.6 (released in 1969). The bright green line, meant to evoke the image of the glow of fluorite, indicates that the lens features a fluorite lens element."></p><p>The first lens to employ fluorite lens elements was the FL-F300mm f/5.6 (released in 1969). The bright green line, meant to evoke the image of the glow of fluorite, indicates that the lens features a fluorite
            lens element.</p>
          <p>The FL-F300mm f/5.6, whose successful commercialization was achieved by transcending many challenges, was highly acclaimed for is vivid, high-contrast rendering, and became widely used in such professions as
            photojournalism. </p>
          <p>Canon subsequently improved on is high temperature vacuum, temperature control, and polishing technologies, enabling the use of fluorite lens elements in many more lenses. Canon remains committed to pursuing the highest
            image quality for its telephoto lenses. </p>

          <h4>The fluorite lens production process</h4>
          <p>While the grinding and polishing processes may seem identical for all kinds of optical glass, each stage of the fluorite lens production process requires slow, meticulous attention to detail.</p>
          <div>

            <p><b>1. Raw materials</b><br>The raw material for fluorite lenses is naturally occurring fluorite ore.</p>

            </p>
            
            <p><b>2. Pulverization and refinement</b><br>The raw fluorite is pulverized and refined to remove impurities before being poured into a graphite crucible that does not melt easily.</p>

            </p>
            
            <p><b>3. Crystallization </b><br>The crucible is placed in a crystal-growing apparatus with a heater on top and heated to 1,400℃. After the raw fluorite has melted, the crucible is gradually lowered, allowing crystallization to occur
                starting from the bottom of the crucible.</p>

            </p>
            
            <p><b>4. Annealing</b><br>The annealing process removes strains that occur inside the crystals formed. Strain that lead to cracks are removed by heating the crystals to a high temperature insufficient to melt them, and then slowly
                cooling them to room temperature over a long period of several weeks.</p>

            </p>
            
            <p><b>5. Trimming and rough processing</b><br>The unnecessary parts of the crystal surface are trimmed off, and the crystal is rough-processed to the required size. The interior of the crystal is inspected for anomalies. </p>

            </p>
            
            <p><b>7. Polishing</b><br>The surfaces of the crystal are polished with a pellet made from coagulated polish until they are semi-transparent and meet the specified dimensions. Finally, a special polish is used to remove fine scratches.

          <div>
            <p>Since the FL-F300mm, Canon has produced 39 more lenses that employ fluorite lens elements. As fluorite lens elements not only correct chromatic aberration but also contribute to reducing the size and weight of products,
                they are proactively used in large telephoto lenses.<br>These lenses are much beloved by many photographers who demand high image quality at super telephoto focal lengths, including not only professional sports photographers and
                photojournalists, but also enthusiasts who photograph subjects such as wild birds, trains and aircraft.</p>

I’m going to be sharing below a more in-depth post-mortem of our service interruption last week.
Assisting me in responding to this incident was Seth, one of our senior engineers, and Luan, our DevOps engineer.</p><p>This will be fairly technical, you can skip to “Next Steps” for takeaways.
The summary is that we were the target of some actors misusing the service, exploting a pathological case in our infrastructure, and we immediately released mitigations and are working on improvements in several areas of our code and communications.</p><h2 id="timeline">Timeline</h2><p>On January 12th, approx. 5:30PM UTC, the team became aware of an infrastructure issue occurring by way of our internal monitoring and user reports of issues.
The nature of the issue was causing slow loading or complete page timeouts for users in various regions.</p><p>This incident unfortunately took us quite some time to resolve - we deeply thank our users for their patience, and the opportunity to give some background as to what was going on, and how we plan to move forward.</p><p>At first, by what turned out to be a complete coincidence, the incident occurred at precisely the same time that we were performing an infrastructure upgrade to our VMs with additional RAM resources.
Our monitoring was reporting both high latency and issues with our application’s database connection pool.
While no code changes were part of this upgrade, and “old” instances were reporting some issues as well, we decided the first course of action was to revert this change.</p><p>This revert completed at around 6:50 PM, but as we continued to monitor the issue persisted.
Meanwhile, we had been inspecting the behavior of our application’s database connection pools, which were saturated with connections to our primary DB instance.
It was unclear what the exact cause of this was yet, but what was clear is that the total number of connections being established globally to our primary exceeded its maximum configured connection limit.</p><p>Our next move was to evaluate if we had somehow caught ourselves in a “spiral” of exhausting our maximum connections, wherein any instance that we would replace would simply get its connection pool exhausted again, queuing for access to the primary.
In several steps we tried replacing a few instances to see what effect reducing the congestion would have.
We also were making progress on evaluating various parts of the databases internal health and query performance.</p><p>With mild signs that cycling some instances was helping, at 9:30PM UTC we decided to pause all user traffic by redirecting users to our status page to give the database a break and completely reset all connection pools in one shot.
We installed the redirect and issued a restart of all nodes.
Once all appeared stable, we started letting traffic back in again.
Unfortunately, the issue persisted.</p><p>While looking at the database state, it became clear to our engineers that the root cause was in fact high contention on rows in the users table.
This contention caused a steep increase in write latency, which in turn put backpressure on our application’s connection pool, causing it to eventually exhaust all available connections as writes were taking too long to complete.
The writes were all stemming from one instance that would eventually starve the rest of our global instances of access to our primary, thus causing disruption in all other regions.</p><p>This didn’t exactly come as a surprise to us, as for the entirety of Kagi’s life so far we have actually used the cheapest, single-core database available to us on GCP!
To this day we’ve yet to exceed 50% load capacity on it, which we’ve worked hard to achieve.
This has always carried the risk of the database being relatively easy to knock over, but we have so far kept load and latency under control with redundancy, distributed read-replicas, and high scrutiny over the SQL we write.</p><p>We then took steps to identify the bad actors, where we found accounts created within 24hrs and over 60,000 searches performed in short time period from a single user facing account.
While we do offer unlimited searches to our users, such volume was a clear abuse of our platform, against our terms of use.
As such, we removed searching capability from the offending accounts.</p><p>At the same time, we issued a hotfix that disabled the particular writes that were causing high contention, in addition to some upgrades of our database driver, which included several relevant bug fixes to connection pool health.
This would help ensure that immediately the same pathological case could not be exploited again.</p><p>By midnight, the issue was fully resolved.
The team continued to closely monitor for any signals that the actors were returning, but they did not.</p><p>We were later in contact with an account that we blocked who claimed they were using their account to perform automated scraping of our results, which is not something our terms allow for.</p><h2 id="next-steps">Next Steps</h2><p>There’s a lot we took away from this incident, and we have immediate plans already in motion to make our system more robust to this type of abuse, as well as our communication processes around incidents.</p><p>First, regretfully we were not very prompt in updating our status page.
We owe it to our customers to be quick and transparent about any issues going on that might affect access to the product that they pay for.
To address this, we are moving to a status page platform to one that will more easily allow us expose some of our automated internal monitoring to users.
This way users have an idea of the platform’s health in real-time, even if our small team of engineers has their hands full to immediately post an update (which was not a very fast process to begin with, even if we were on top of it).
We should have this available by next week.</p><p>Secondly, we have directly mitigated the queries causing issues under load.
With this issue in mind, we are also running load tests to learn about any other similar deficiencies that may still exist, and what to avoid in the future.
We are also installing some additional monitoring to more quickly point us to the right place in our infra, and hopefully not waste as much time chasing a false-flag as we did this time.</p><p>Lastly, we are performing a re-upping of our systems set up to detect this kind of abuse of our terms, which were clearly too lax.
Besides any potential performance impact, this vector also directly costs us money as we pay for each search.
To protect our finances, and all of our subscribers continued access to unlimited (organic) searches, we need to set some automated limits to help us enforce this.
From analyzing our user’s usage, we have picked some limits that no good-faith user of Kagi should reasonably hit.</p><p>These new limits should already be in place by the time of this post, and we will monitor their impact and continue to tune them as needed.
If you believe you find yourself wrongly unable to access Kagi, please reach out to <a href="mailto:support@kagi.com">support@kagi.com</a>.</p><p>Thank you so much for bearing with us through this incident!
Please look forward to a more robust service as we implement these things, and as usual, more features &amp; improvements are on their way.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
							

						<p>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</p>
					</div><div lang="en" dir="ltr" id="mw-content-text"><p>The number <b>6174</b> is known as <b>Kaprekar's constant</b><sup id="cite_ref-1"><a href="#cite_note-1">[1]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Kaprekar1955_2-0"><a href="#cite_note-Kaprekar1955-2">[2]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Kaprekar1980_3-0"><a href="#cite_note-Kaprekar1980-3">[3]</a></sup> after the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India" title="India">Indian</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematician" title="Mathematician">mathematician</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D._R._Kaprekar" title="D. R. Kaprekar">D. R. Kaprekar</a>. This number is renowned for the following rule:
</p>
<ol><li>Take any four-digit number, using at least two different digits (leading zeros are allowed).</li>
<li>Arrange the digits in descending and then in ascending order to get two four-digit numbers, adding leading zeros if necessary.</li>
<li>Subtract the smaller number from the bigger number.</li>
<li>Go back to step 2 and repeat.</li></ol>
<p>The above process, known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaprekar%27s_routine" title="Kaprekar's routine">Kaprekar's routine</a>, will always reach its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed_point_(mathematics)" title="Fixed point (mathematics)">fixed point</a>, 6174, in at most 7 iterations.<sup id="cite_ref-mathworld_4-0"><a href="#cite_note-mathworld-4">[4]</a></sup> Once 6174 is reached, the process will continue yielding 7641 – 1467 = 6174. For example, choose 1459:
</p>
<div>
<ul><li>9541 – 1459 = 8082</li>
<li>8820 – 0288 = 8532</li>
<li>8532 – 2358 = 6174</li>
<li>7641 – 1467 = <b>6174</b></li></ul>
</div><p>
The only four-digit numbers for which Kaprekar's routine does not reach 6174 are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repdigit" title="Repdigit">repdigits</a> such as 1111, which give the result <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/0_(number)" title="0 (number)">0000</a> after a single iteration. All other four-digit numbers eventually reach 6174 if leading zeros are used to keep the number of digits at 4. For numbers with three identical numbers and a fourth number that is one number higher or lower (such as 2111), it is essential to treat 3-digit numbers with a leading zero; for example: 2111 – 1112 = 0999; 9990 – 999 = 8991; 9981 – 1899 = 8082; 8820 – 288 = 8532; 8532 – 2358 = 6174.<sup id="cite_ref-5"><a href="#cite_note-5">[5]</a></sup></p><table><tbody><tr><th colspan="2"><table><tbody><tr>

<p>There can be analogous fixed points for digit lengths other than four; for instance, if we use 3-digit numbers, then most sequences (i.e., other than repdigits such as 111) will terminate in the value <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/495_(number)" title="495 (number)">495</a> in at most 6 iterations. Sometimes these numbers (495, 6174, and their counterparts in other digit lengths or in bases other than 10) are called "Kaprekar constants".

<p>Great news! You've built a cool <a href="https://goo.gle/made-with-tfjs">Web AI application</a> 
that runs machine learning models directly on a user's device. It runs entirely
on the client-side web browser, without relying on the cloud. This on-device
design enhances user privacy, boosts performance, and reduces costs
significantly.</p>

<p>However, there's a hurdle. Your
<a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/js">TensorFlow.js</a> model can operate on
both CPUs (WebAssembly) and more powerful GPUs (through
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/WebGL_API">WebGL</a> and
<a href="https://developer.chrome.com/blog/webgpu-release">WebGPU</a>). The question is:
<strong>how can you consistently automate browser testing with the selected hardware?</strong></p>

<p>Maintaining consistency is crucial for comparing machine learning model
performance over time as you iterate and improve them, prior to deployment for
real-world users to use on their device.</p>

<p>Setting up a consistent testing environment with GPUs can be harder than
expected. In this blog post, we'll share the problems we faced and how we solved
them, so you can improve your application's performance.</p>

<p>This isn't just for Web AI developers! If you're working on web gaming or
graphics, this post is valuable for you, too.</p>

<h2 id="what's-automation" data-text="What's in our automation toolbox" tabindex="-1">What's in our automation toolbox</h2>

<p>Here is what we are using:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Environment</strong>: A Linux-based Google Colab
<a href="https://colab.google/notebooks/">notebook</a> connected to an NVIDIA
T4 or V100 GPU. You can use other cloud platforms, such as Google Cloud
(GCP), if preferred.</li>
<li><strong>Browser</strong>: Chrome supports <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/web-platform/webgpu">WebGPU</a>,
a powerful <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/blog/from-webgl-to-webgpu">successor to WebGL</a>, that
brings the advancements of modern GPU APIs to the web.</li>
<li><strong>Automation</strong>: <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/puppeteer">Puppeteer</a> is a Node.js library that lets
you control browsers programmatically with JavaScript. With Puppeteer, we can
automate Chrome in headless mode, which means the browser runs without a
visible interface, on a server. We are using the improved
<a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/chromium/new-headless">new headless mode</a>, not the
<a href="https://developer.chrome.com/blog/headless-chrome">legacy</a> form.</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="verify-environment" data-text="Verify the environment" tabindex="-1">Verify the environment</h2>

<p>The best way to check whether hardware acceleration is turned on in Chrome is to
type <code translate="no" dir="ltr">chrome://gpu</code> into the address bar. You can
programmatically <a href="https://github.com/jasonmayes/headless-chrome-nvidia-t4-gpu-support/blob/main/examples/puppeteer/jPuppet.js">perform the equivalent with Puppeteer</a> 
with <code translate="no" dir="ltr">console.log</code> or save the full report as PDF to check manually:</p>
<pre translate="no" dir="ltr"><code translate="no" dir="ltr">/* Incomplete example.js */
import puppeteer from 'puppeteer';

// Configure launch parameters: Expands later
const browser = await puppeteer.launch({
  headless: 'new',
  args:  ['--no-sandbox']
});

const page = await browser.newPage();
await page.goto('chrome://gpu');

// Verify: log the WebGPU status or save the GPU report as PDF
const txt = await page.waitForSelector('text/WebGPU');
const status = await txt.evaluate(g =&gt; g.parentElement.textContent);
console.log(status);
await page.pdf({ path: './gpu.pdf' });

await browser.close();
</code></pre>
<p>Open <code translate="no" dir="ltr">chrome://gpu</code> and you should have the following results:</p>

<table>
  <tbody><tr>
    <th colspan="2">Graphics feature status</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>OpenGL:</td>
    <td><span>Disabled</span></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Vulkan:</td>
    <td><span>Disabled</span></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>WebGL:</td>
    <td><span>Software only, hardware acceleration unavailable.</span></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>WebGL2:</td>

  <tr>
    <td colspan="2">
      <p><b>Problems detected.</b><br>WebGPU has been disabled via blocklist or the command line.</p>
    </td>
  </tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>Not a great start. It's fairly clear that hardware detection was failing.
<strong>WebGL, WebGL2, and WebGPU are essentially disabled or software only</strong>. We
aren't alone in this problem - there are numerous discussions online of people
in a similar situation, including on the official Chrome support channels
(<a href="https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=1459930">1</a>),
(<a href="https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=765284">2</a>).</p>

<h2 id="enable-webgpu" data-text="Enable WebGPU and WebGL support" tabindex="-1">Enable WebGPU and WebGL support</h2>

<p>By default, Headless Chrome
<a href="https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=1416283">disables GPU</a>.
To enable it on Linux, apply all of the following flags when launching Headless
Chrome:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong><code translate="no" dir="ltr">--no-sandbox</code></strong> flag disables <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/puppeteer/troubleshooting#set_up_a_chrome_linux_sandbox">Chrome's security sandbox</a>, which isolates the
browser process from the rest of the system. Running Chrome as root without
this sandbox is not supported.</li>
<li><strong><code translate="no" dir="ltr">--headless=new</code></strong> flag runs Chrome with the new and improved
<a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/chromium/new-headless">headless mode</a>, without any visible UI.</li>
<li><strong><code translate="no" dir="ltr">--use-angle=vulkan</code></strong> flag tells Chrome to use the
<a href="https://chromium.googlesource.com/angle/angle/+/HEAD/src/libANGLE/renderer/vulkan/README.md">Vulkan backend</a> 
for <a href="https://chromium.googlesource.com/angle/angle/">ANGLE</a>, which
translates OpenGL ES 2/3 calls to Vulkan API calls.</li>
<li><strong><code translate="no" dir="ltr">--enable-features=Vulkan</code></strong> flag enables Vulkan graphics backend for
compositing and rasterization in Chrome.</li>
<li><strong><code translate="no" dir="ltr">--disable-vulkan-surface</code></strong> flag disables the <code translate="no" dir="ltr">VK_KHR_surface</code> vulkan
instance extension. Instead of using a swapchain,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit_blit">Bit blit</a> is used for the
present render result on screen.</li>
<li><strong><code translate="no" dir="ltr">--enable-unsafe-webgpu</code></strong> flag enables the experimental WebGPU API in
Chrome on Linux and disables the adapters blocklist.</li>
</ul>

<p>Now we combine all the changes we have made so far. Here is the complete script.</p>
<pre translate="no" dir="ltr"><code translate="no" dir="ltr">/* Complete example.js */
import puppeteer from 'puppeteer';

// Configure launch parameters
const browser = await puppeteer.launch({
  headless: 'new',
  args: [
    '--no-sandbox',
    '--headless=new',
    '--use-angle=vulkan',
    '--enable-features=Vulkan',
    '--disable-vulkan-surface',
    '--enable-unsafe-webgpu',
  ]
});

const page = await browser.newPage();
await page.goto('chrome://gpu');

// Verify: log the WebGPU status or save the GPU report as PDF
const txt = await page.waitForSelector('text/WebGPU');
const status = await txt.evaluate(g =&gt; g.parentElement.textContent);
console.log(status);
await page.pdf({path: './gpu.pdf'});

await browser.close();
</code></pre>
<p>Run the script again. No WebGPU problems are detected and the value changes from
disabled to software only.</p>

<table>
  <tbody><tr>
    <th colspan="2">Graphics feature status</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>OpenGL:</td>
    <td><span>Disabled</span></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Vulkan:</td>
    <td><span>Disabled</span></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>WebGL:</td>
    <td><span>Software only, hardware acceleration unavailable.</span></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>WebGL2:</td>
    <td><span>Software only, hardware acceleration unavailable.</span></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>WebGPU:</td>
    <td><span>Software only, hardware acceleration unavailable.</span></td>
  </tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>However, hardware acceleration is still unavailable, the NVIDIA T4 GPU isn't
detected.</p>

<h2 id="install-drivers" data-text="Install the correct GPU drivers" tabindex="-1">Install the correct GPU drivers</h2>

<p>We investigated more closely the output of <code translate="no" dir="ltr">chrome://gpu</code>, with some GPU experts
on the Chrome team. We found issues with the <a href="https://github.com/googlecolab/colabtools/issues/3556#issuecomment-1499397023">default drivers installed on the
Linux Colab</a> 
instance, causing issues with Vulkan, leading to Chrome unable to detect the
NVIDIA T4 GPU at the <code translate="no" dir="ltr">GL_RENDERER</code> level as shown in the following output. This
causes problems with Headless Chrome.</p>

<table>
  <caption>The default output doesn't detect NVIDIA T4 GPU.</caption>
  <tbody><tr>
    <th colspan="2">Driver information</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>GL_RENDERER</td>
    <td>ANGLE (Google, Vulkan 1.3.0 (SwiftShader Device (Subzero) (0x0000C0DE)), SwiftShader driver-5.0.0)</td>
  </tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>Installing the correct drivers that were compatible therefore fixes the issue.</p>

<table>
  <caption>Updated output after drivers are installed.</caption>
  <tbody><tr>
    <th colspan="2">Driver information</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>GL_RENDERER</td>
    <td>ANGLE (NVIDIA Corporation, Tesla T4/PCIe/SSE2, OpenGL ES 3.2 NVIDIA 525.105.17)</td>
  </tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>To install the correct drivers, run the following commands during setup. The
last two lines help you to log the outputs of what NVIDIA drivers detects along
with <code translate="no" dir="ltr">vulkaninfo</code>.</p>

<pre translate="no" dir="ltr"><code translate="no" dir="ltr">apt-get install -y vulkan-tools libnvidia-gl-525
</code>
<code translate="no" dir="ltr">// Verify the NVIDIA drivers detects along with vulkaninfo</code>
<code translate="no" dir="ltr">nvidia-smi</code>
<code translate="no" dir="ltr">vulkaninfo --summary</code>
</pre>

<p>Now run the script again and we get the following result. 🎉</p>

<table>
  <tbody><tr>
    <th colspan="2">Graphics feature status</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>OpenGL:</td>
    <td><span>Enabled</span></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Vulkan:</td>
    <td><span>Enabled</span></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>WebGL:</td>
    <td><span>Hardware accelerated but at reduced performance.</span></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>WebGL2:</td>
    <td><span>Hardware accelerated but at reduced performance.</span></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>WebGPU:</td>
    <td><span>Hardware accelerated but at reduced performance.</span></td>
  </tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>By using the correct drivers and flags when running Chrome, we now have WebGPU
and WebGL support using the shiny, new headless mode.</p>

<h2 id="investigation" data-text="Behind the scenes: Our team's investigation" tabindex="-1">Behind the scenes: Our team's investigation</h2>

<p>After much research, we didn't find working methods for the environment we
needed to execute in Google Colab, although there were some
<a href="https://mirzabilal.com/how-to-enable-hardware-acceleration-on-chrome-chromium-puppeteer-on-aws-in-headless-mode">hopeful posts</a> 
that worked in other environments, which was promising. Ultimately, we weren't
able to replicate their success in the Colab NVIDIA T4 environment, as we had 2
key issues:</p>

<ol>
<li>Some combinations of flags allow detection of the GPU, but don't allow you to
actually use the GPU.</li>
<li>Examples of working solutions by third parties used the old Chrome headless
version, which at some point will be deprecated in favor of the
<a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/chromium/new-headless">new version</a>. We needed a solution
that worked with the new Headless Chrome to be better future proofed.</li>
</ol>

<p>We confirmed the under utilization of the GPU by running an
<a href="https://tensorflowjs-fashion-mnist-classifier.glitch.me/">example TensorFlow.js web page for image recognition</a>,
whereby we trained a model to recognize clothing samples (sort of like a "hello
world" of machine learning).</p>

<p>On a regular machine, 50 training cycles (known as epochs) should run in less
than 1 second each. Calling Headless Chrome in its default state, we could log
the JavaScript console output to the Node.js server-side command line to see how
fast these training cycles were actually taking.</p>

<p>As expected, each training epoch took much longer than expected (several
seconds), which suggests Chrome has fallen back to plain old JS CPU execution
instead of utilizing the GPU:</p>

  <figcaption><b>Figure 1</b>: Real-time capture showing how long each training epoch took to execute (seconds).</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>After fixing the drivers and using the right combination of flags for Headless
Chrome, rerunning the TensorFlow.js training example results in much faster
training epochs.</p>

<h2 id="summary" data-text="Summary" tabindex="-1">Summary</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7hOoCY6uGo">Web AI has grown exponentially</a> 
since its creation in 2017. With browser technologies such as WebGPU, WebGL, and
<a href="https://webassembly.org/">WebAssembly</a>, a machine learning model's
mathematical operations can be further accelerated on the client side.</p>

<p>As of 2023 TensorFlow.js and MediaPipe Web crossed over 1 billion downloads of
models and libraries—a historic milestone and a sign of how web
developers and engineers are shifting to embrace <a href="https://goo.gle/made-with-tfjs">AI in their next generation
web apps to make some truly incredible solutions</a>.</p>

<p>With great success in usage comes great responsibility. At this level of usage
in production systems, the need arises for testing client-side, browser-based AI
models in a true browser environment, while also being scalable, automatable,
and within a known standardized hardware setup.</p>



<p>By harnessing the combined power of the new Headless Chrome and Puppeteer, you
can confidently test such workloads in a standardized and replicable
environment, ensuring consistent and reliable results.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section itemprop="text">
        
        <p>I’ve spent quite a lot of time messing with x86_64 page tables, understanding address translation is not easy and when I started learning about it I felt like a lot of the material out there on how it works was hard for me to wrap my head around. So in this blog post I am going to attempt to provide a kind of “what I wish I had when learning about paging”.</p>

<p>Quick note, I’ll only be discussing paging in the context of PML4 (Page Map Level 4) since it’s currently the dominant x86_64 paging scheme and probably will be for a while still.</p>

<h2 id="environment">environment</h2>

<p>Its not necessary, but I recommend that you have a Linux kernel debugging setup with QEMU + gdb prepared to follow along with. If you’ve never done this, maybe give this repo a shot: <a href="https://github.com/deepseagirl/easylkb">easylkb</a> (I’ve never used it, but I’ve heard good things) or if you want to avoid having to setup the environment yourself, the practice mode on any of the Kernel Security challenges on <a href="https://pwn.college/">pwn.college</a> would also work (<code>vm connect</code> and <code>vm debug</code> are the commands to know).</p>

<p>I suggest this because I think running the same commands I am on your own and being able to perform a page walk based on what you can see in gdb is a good test of understanding.</p>

<h2 id="wtf-is-a-page">wtf is a page</h2>

<p>On x86_64 a page is a 0x1000 byte slice of memory which is 0x1000 byte aligned.</p>

<p>This is the reason why if you ever look at /proc/&lt;pid&gt;/maps you see that all the address ranges will start and end with an address ending with 0x000 because the minimum size of a memory mapping on x86_64 is page size (0x1000 bytes) and pages are required to be ‘page aligned’ (the last 12 bits must be zero).</p>

<p>A ‘Virtual Page’ will be resolved to a single ‘Physical Page’ (aka ‘Page Frame’) by your MMU though many Virtual Pages may refer to the same Physical Page.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-in-a-virtual-address">what is in a virtual address</h2>

<p>PML4, as one might guess, has four level of paging structures, these paging structures are called ‘Page Tables’. A page table is a page-sized memory region which contains 512 8-byte page table entries. Each entry of a page table will refer to either the next level page table or to the final physical address a virtual address resolves to.</p>

<p>The entry from a page table that is used for address translation is based on the virtual address of the memory access. With 512 entries per level, that means 9-bits of the virtual address are used at every level to index into the corresponding page table.</p>

<p>Say we have an address like this:</p>

<p><code>0x7ffe1c9c9000</code></p>

<p>The last 12 bits of this address represent the offset within the physical page:</p>

<p><code>0x7ffe1c9c9000 &amp; 0xfff = 0x0</code></p>

<p>This means that once we determine the physical address of the page this virtual address resolves to, we will add zero to the result to get the final physical address.</p>

<p>After the last 12 bits, which is again just the offset within the final page, a virtual address is comprised of indicies into the page tables. As mentioned each level of paging uses 9 bits of the virtual address, so the lowest level of the paging structures, a Page Table, is indexed by the next 9 bits of the address (by bit masking with <code>&amp; 0x1ff</code> on the shifted value). For the following levels we just need to shift right by another nine bits each time and again mask off the lower nine bits as our index. Doing this for the address above gives us these indicies:</p>

<div><pre><code>Level 1, Page Table (PT):
Index = (0x7ffe1c9c9000 &gt;&gt; 12) &amp; 0x1ff = 0x1c9

Level 2, Page Middle Directory (PMD):
Index = (0x7ffe1c9c9000 &gt;&gt; 21) &amp; 0x1ff = 0x0e4

Level 3, Page Upper Directory (PUD):
Index = (0x7ffe1c9c9000 &gt;&gt; 30) &amp; 0x1ff = 0x1f8

Level 4, Page Global Directory (PGD):
Index = (0x7ffe1c9c9000 &gt;&gt; 39) &amp; 0x1ff = 0x0ff
</code></pre></div>

<h2 id="all-your-base">all your base</h2>

<p>Now that we know how to index into page tables and vaguely what they contain, where actually are they???</p>

<p>Well each thread of your CPU has a page table base register called <code>cr3</code>.</p>

<p><code>cr3</code> holds the physical address of the highest level of the paging structure, aka the Page Global Directory (PGD).</p>

<p>From gdb, when debugging the kernel, you can read the contents of <code>cr3</code> like this:</p>

<div><pre><code>gef➤  p/x $cr3
$1 = 0x10d664000
</code></pre></div>

<p>The <code>cr3</code> register can hold some additional information besides just the PGD address depending on what processor features are in use, so a more general way of getting the physical address of the PGD from the <code>cr3</code> register is to mask off the lower 12 bits of its contents like so:</p>

<div><pre><code>gef➤  p/x $cr3 &amp; ~0xfff
$2 = 0x10d664000
</code></pre></div>

<h2 id="page-table-entries">page table entries</h2>

<p>Lets look at what is at that physical address we got from <code>cr3</code> in gdb. The <code>monitor xp/...</code> command that is exposed to gdb by the QEMU Monitor lets us print out the physical memory of the vm and doing <code>monitor xp/512gx ...</code> will print the entire contents, all 512 entries, of the PGD referred to by <code>cr3</code>:</p>

<div><pre><code>gef➤  monitor xp/512gx 0x10d664000

<p>This produces a lot of output and most of it is zero, so I’m only including the tail of the output here.</p>

<p>This output probably doesn’t mean much to you yet, but we can observe some patterns in the data, lots of the 8-byte entries end in <code>0x67</code>, for example.</p>

<h2 id="decoding-a-pgd-entry">decoding a PGD entry</h2>

<p>From the PGD output above, lets take the PGD entry at <code>0x000000010d664f50</code> with value <code>0x0000000123fca067</code> as an example to see how to decode an entry.</p>

<p>and lets do this with the binary representation of that entry’s value:</p>

<div><pre><code>gef➤  p/t 0x0000000123fca067

</code></pre></div>

<p>and here’s a key for what each of those label mean:</p>

<ul>
  <li>NX (Not Executable) – if this bit is set, no memory mapping that is a descendant of this PGD entry will be executable.</li>
  <li>Reserved – these values must be zero.</li>
  <li>PUD Physical Address – the physical address of the PUD associated with this PGD entry.</li>
  <li>Accessed –  If any pages referred to by this entry or its descendants, this bit will be set by the MMU, and can be cleared by the OS.</li>
  <li>Page Cache Disabled (PCD) – pages descendant of this PGD entry should not enter the CPU’s cache hierarchy, sometimes also called the ‘Uncacheable’ (UC) bit.</li>
  <li>Page Write Through (WT) – writes to pages descendant of this PGD entry should immediately write to RAM rather than buffering writes to CPU cache before eventually updating RAM.</li>
  <li>User/Supervisor – if this bit is unset, pages descendant of this PGD cannot be accessed unless in supervisor mode.</li>
  <li>Read/Write – if this bit is unset, pages descendant of this PGD cannot be written to.</li>
  <li>Present – if this bit is unset then the processor will not use this entry for address translation and none of the other bits will apply.</li>
</ul>

<p>The bits that we really care about here are the the Present bit, the ones representing the physical address of the next level of the paging structures, the PUD Physical Address bits, and the permission bits: NX, User/Supervisor, and Read/Write.</p>

<ul>
  <li>The Present bit is super important because without it set the rest of the entry is ignored.</li>
  <li>The PUD Physical Address lets us continue page walking by telling us where the physical address of the next level of the paging structures is at.</li>
  <li>The Permission bits all apply to pages which are descendants of the PGD entry and determine how those pages are able to be accesssed.</li>
</ul>

<p>The remaining bits are not as important for our purposes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The Accessed bit is set if the entry was used in translating a memory access, its not important for page walking.</li>
  <li>Page Cache Disabled and Page Write Through are not used for normal memory mappings and do not affect page translation or permissions so lets ignore them.</li>
</ul>

<p>So decoding this entry, we learn:</p>

<p>The PUD is Present:</p>
<div><pre><code>gef➤  p/x 0x0000000123fca067 &amp; 0b0001
$18 = 0x1
</code></pre></div>
<p>The mappings in the PUD and below may be able to be Writable:</p>
<div><pre><code>gef➤  p/x 0x0000000123fca067 &amp; 0b0010
$19 = 0x2
</code></pre></div>
<p>The mappings in the PUD and below may be able to be User accessible:</p>
<div><pre><code>gef➤  p/x 0x0000000123fca067 &amp; 0b0100
$20 = 0x4
</code></pre></div>
<p>The PUD’s physical address ( bits (51:12] ) is <code>0x123fca000</code>:</p>
<div><pre><code>gef➤  p/x 0x0000000123fca067 &amp; ~((1ull&lt;&lt;12)-1) &amp; ((1ull&lt;&lt;51)-1)
$21 = 0x123fca000
</code></pre></div>
<p>The mappings in the PUD and below may be able to be Executable:</p>
<div><pre><code>gef➤  p/x 0x0000000123fca067 &amp; (1ull&lt;&lt;63)
$22 = 0x0
</code></pre></div>

<p>Now that we’ve seen how to decode a PGD entry, decoding the rest of the levels aren’t so much different, at least in the common case.</p>

<p>For all of these diagrams ‘X’ means the bit can be either zero or one, otherwise, if a bit is set to a specific value then that value is either required by the architecture or by the specific encoding shown by the diagram.</p>

<p>As you can see the diagram above for the PUD is very similar to the one for the PGD, the only difference is the introduction of the ‘Page Size’ bit. The Page Size bit being set changes how we need to interpret a PUD entry quite a lot. For this diagram we are assuming it is unset, which is the most common case.</p>

<p>At the Page Table entry things get more interesting, there are some new fields/attributes that weren’t there in the previous levels.</p>

<p>Those new fields/attributes are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Memory Protection Key (MPK or PK): This is an x86_64 extension that allows assigning a 4-bit keys to pages which can be used to configure memory permissions for all pages with that key.</li>
  <li>Global: This has to do with how the TLB (Translation Lookaside Buffer, the MMU’s cache for virtual to physical address translations) caches the translation for th page, this bit being set means the page will not be flushed from the TLB on context switch, this is commonly enabled on Kernel pages to reduce TLB misses.</li>
  <li>Page Attribute Table (PAT): If set, the MMU should consult the Page Attribute Table MSR when determining whether the ‘Memory Type’ of the page, e.g. whether this page is ‘Uncacheable’, ‘Write Through’, or one of a few other memory types.</li>
  <li>Dirty: This bit is similar to the accessed bit, it gets set by the MMU if this page was written to and must be reset by the OS.</li>
</ul>

<p>None of these actually affect the address translation itself, but the configuration of the Memory Protection Key can mean that the expected memory access permissions for the page referred to by this entry may be stricter than what is encoded by the entry itself.</p>

<p>Unlike the previous levels, since this is the last level, the entry holds the final physical address of the page associated with the virtual address we are translating. Once you apply a bit-mask to get the physical address bytes and add the last 12 bits of the original virtual address (the offset within the page), you have your physical address!</p>

<p>Hopefully, this doesn’t seem so bad, the general case of page walking is just a few steps:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Convert the virtual address to indicies and a page offset by shifting the address and applying bitmasks</li>
  <li>Read <code>cr3</code> to get the physical address of the PGD</li>
  <li>For each level until the last:
    <ul>
      <li>Use the indicies calculated from the virtual address to know what entry from the page table to use</li>
      <li>Apply a bitmask to the entry to get the physical address of the next level</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>On the final level, again find the entry corresponding with the index from the virtual address</li>
  <li>Apply a bitmask to get the physical address of the page associated with the virtual address</li>
  <li>Add offset within the page from the virtual address to the page’s physical address</li>
  <li>Done!</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="hugeify">hugeify</h2>

<p>As mentioned, the previous diagrams for the PUD and PMD are for the common case, when the Page Size bit is not set.</p>

<p>So, what about when it is set?</p>

<p>When it is set that is effectively telling the MMU, pack it up, we’re done here, don’t keep page walking, the current entry holds the physical address of the page we are looking for.</p>

<p>But there is a bit more to it than that, the physical address of the page in entries where the Page Size bit is set isn’t for a normal 4KB (0x1000 byte) page, it is a ‘Huge Page’ which comes in two variants: 1GB Huge Pages and 2MB Huge Pages.</p>

<p>When a PUD entry has the Page Size bit set then it refers to a 1GB Huge Page, and when a PMD has the Page Size bit set it refers to a 2MB Huge Page.</p>

<p>But where do the 1GB and 2MB numbers come from?</p>

<p>Each page table level holds up to 512 entries, that means a PT can refer to at most 512 pages and <code>512 * 4KB = 2MB</code>. So a Huge Page at the PMD level effectively means that the entry refers to a page that is the same size as a full PT.</p>

<p>Extending this to the PUD level, we just multiply by 512 again to get the size of a full PMD that has full PTs: <code>512 * 512 * 4KB = 1GB</code>.</p>

<p>When the page size bit is set notice that the PUD entry looks more like a PT entry than a normal PUD entry, which makes sense because it is also referring to a page rather than a page table.</p>

<p>There are some distinctions from a PT entry though:</p>
<ol>
  <li>The Page Size bit is where the Page Attribute Table (PAT) bit is at on a PT, so the PAT bit is relocated to bit 12.</li>
  <li>The physical address of a 1GB Huge Page is required to have 1GB alignment in physical memory, this is why the new reserved bits exist and why bit 12 is able to be repurposed as the PAT bit.</li>
</ol>

<p>Overall, not too much new here, the only other differences when dealing with huge pages really is that a different bitmask needs to be applied to the address to get the bits for the physical address of the page, also the 1GB alignment means when calculating the physical address of a virtual address within the page we need to use a mask based on 1GB alignment instead of 4KB alignment.</p>

</code></pre></div>

<p>This is very similar to the PUD entry with the Page Size bit set, the only thing that has changed is that since the alignment is smaller for the 2MB pages at this level, there are less reserved bits set.</p>

<p>The 2MB alignment means the offset within the huge page should be calculated using a mask based on 2MB alignment.</p>

<h2 id="going-for-a-walk">going for a walk</h2>

<p>So the last section was a lot of diagrams, in this section lets look at how to actually do a page walk manually in gdb.</p>

<h3 id="preparation">preparation</h3>

<p>With a booted up vm and gdb attached I first will pick an address to do a page walk on, as an example I’ll use the current stack pointer while running in the kernel:</p>

<div><pre><code>gef➤  p/x $rsp
$42 = 0xffffffff88c07da8
</code></pre></div>

<p>Now we have the address we are going to walk, lets also get the physical address of the PGD from <code>cr3</code>:</p>

<div><pre><code>gef➤  p/x $cr3 &amp; ~0xfff
$43 = 0x10d664000
</code></pre></div>

<p>I’ll use this little python function to extract the page table offsets from the virtual address:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>get_virt_indicies</span><span>(</span><span>addr</span><span>):</span>
    <span>pageshift</span> <span>=</span> <span>12</span>
    <span>addr</span> <span>=</span> <span>addr</span> <span>&gt;&gt;</span> <span>pageshift</span>
    <span>pt</span><span>,</span> <span>pmd</span><span>,</span> <span>pud</span><span>,</span> <span>pgd</span> <span>=</span> <span>(((</span><span>addr</span> <span>&gt;&gt;</span> <span>(</span><span>i</span><span>*</span><span>9</span><span>))</span> <span>&amp;</span> <span>0x1ff</span><span>)</span> <span>for</span> <span>i</span> <span>in</span> <span>range</span><span>(</span><span>4</span><span>))</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>pgd</span><span>,</span> <span>pud</span><span>,</span> <span>pmd</span><span>,</span> <span>pt</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>which outputs this:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>In</span> <span>[</span><span>2</span><span>]:</span> <span>get_virt_indicies</span><span>(</span><span>0xffffffff88c07da8</span><span>)</span>
<span>Out</span><span>[</span><span>2</span><span>]:</span> <span>(</span><span>511</span><span>,</span> <span>510</span><span>,</span> <span>70</span><span>,</span> <span>7</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div>

<h3 id="pgd-1">PGD</h3>

<p>The index we got for the PGD based on the virtual address was 511, multiplying 511 by 8 will let us get the byte offset into the PGD that the PGD entry for our virtual address starts at:</p>

<div><pre><code>gef➤  p/x 511*8
$44 = 0xff8
</code></pre></div>

<p>adding that offset to the PGD’s physical address gets us the physical address of the PGD entry:</p>

<div><pre><code>gef➤  p/x 0x10d664000+0xff8
$45 = 0x10d664ff8
</code></pre></div>

<p>and reading the physical memory at that address gets us the PGD entry itself:</p>
<div><pre><code>gef➤  monitor xp/gx 0x10d664ff8
000000010d664ff8: 0x0000000008c33067
</code></pre></div>

<p>Looks like the entry has the last three bits (present, user, and writeable) set, and the top bit (NX) is unset, meaning there aren’t any restrictions so far on the permissions of the pages associated with this virtual address.</p>

<p>Masking the bits [12, 51) gives us the physical address of the PUD:</p>

<div><pre><code>gef➤  p/x 0x0000000008c33067 &amp; ~((1&lt;&lt;12)-1) &amp; ((1&lt;&lt;51) - 1)
$46 = 0x8c33000
</code></pre></div>

<h3 id="pud-1">PUD</h3>

<p>The index we got for the PUD based on the virtual address was 510, multiplying 510 by 8 will let us get the byte offset into the PUD that the PUD entry for our virtual address starts at:</p>

<div><pre><code>gef➤  p/x 510*8
$47 = 0xff0
</code></pre></div>

<p>adding that offset to the PUD’s physical address gets us the physical address of the PUD entry:</p>

<div><pre><code>gef➤  p/x 0x8c33000+0xff0
$48 = 0x8c33ff0
</code></pre></div>

<p>and reading the physical memory at that address gets us the PUD entry itself:</p>
<div><pre><code>gef➤  monitor xp/gx 0x8c33ff0
0000000008c33ff0: 0x0000000008c34063
</code></pre></div>

<p>At this level we need to start paying attention to the Size Bit (bit 7), because if it is a 1GB page we would stop our page walk here.</p>

<div><pre><code>gef➤  p/x 0x0000000008c34063 &amp; (1&lt;&lt;7)
$49 = 0x0
</code></pre></div>

<p>Seems it is unset on this entry so we will continue page walking.</p>

<p>Notice also that the PUD entry ends in 0x3 and not 0x7 like the previous level, the bottom two bits (present, writeable) are still set but the third bit, the user bit is now unset. That means that usermode accesses to pages belonging to this PUD entry will result in a page fault due to the failed permission check on the access.</p>

<p>The NX bit is still unset, so pages belonging to this PUD can still be executable.</p>

<p>Masking the bits [12, 51) gives us the physical address of the PMD:</p>

<div><pre><code>gef➤  p/x 0x0000000008c34063 &amp; ~((1ull&lt;&lt;12)-1) &amp; ((1ull&lt;&lt;51)-1)
$50 = 0x8c34000
</code></pre></div>

<h3 id="pmd-1">PMD</h3>

<p>The index we got for the PMD based on the virtual address was 70, multiplying 70 by 8 will let us get the byte offset into the PMD that the PMD entry for our virtual address starts at:</p>

<div><pre><code>gef➤  p/x 70*8
$51 = 0x230
</code></pre></div>

<p>adding that offset to the PMD’s physical address gets us the physical address of the PMD entry:</p>

<div><pre><code>gef➤  p/x 0x8c34000+0x230
$52 = 0x8c34230
</code></pre></div>

<p>and reading the physical memory at that address gets us the PMD entry itself:</p>
<div><pre><code>gef➤  monitor xp/gx 0x8c34230
0000000008c34230: 0x8000000008c001e3
</code></pre></div>

<p>Again, at this level we need paying attention to the Size Bit, because if it is a 2MB page we will stop our page walk here.</p>

<div><pre><code>gef➤  p/x 0x8000000008c001e3 &amp; (1&lt;&lt;7)
$53 = 0x80
</code></pre></div>

<p>Looks like our virtual address refers to a 2MB Huge Page! so the physical address in this PMD entry is the physical address of that Huge Page.</p>

<p>Also, looking at the permission bits, looks like the page is still present and writeable and the user bit is still unset, so this page is only accessible from supervisor mode (ring-0).</p>

<p>Unlike the previous levels, the top bit, the NX bit, is set:</p>

<div><pre><code>gef➤  p/x 0x8000000008c001e3 &amp; (1ull&lt;&lt;63)
$54 = 0x8000000000000000
</code></pre></div>

<p>So this Huge Page is not executable memory.</p>

<p>Applying a bitmask on bits [21:51) gets us the physical address of the huge page:</p>

<div><pre><code>gef➤  p/x 0x8000000008c001e3 &amp; ~((1ull&lt;&lt;21)-1) &amp; ((1ull&lt;&lt;51)-1)
$56 = 0x8c00000
</code></pre></div>

<p>Now we need to apply a mask to the virtual address based on 2MB page alignment to get the offset into the Huge Page.</p>

<p>2MB is equivalent to <code>1&lt;&lt;21</code> so applying a bitmask of <code>(1ull&lt;&lt;21)-1</code> will get us the offset:</p>

<div><pre><code>gef➤  p/x 0xffffffff88c07da8 &amp; ((1ull&lt;&lt;21)-1)
$57 = 0x7da8
</code></pre></div>

<p>Now adding this offset to the base address of the 2MB Huge Page will get us the physical address associated with the virtual address we started with:</p>

<div><pre><code>gef➤  p/x 0x8c00000 + 0x7da8
$58 = 0x8c07da8
</code></pre></div>

<p>Looks like the Virtual Address: <code>0xffffffff88c07da8</code> has a Physical Address of: <code>0x8c07da8</code>!</p>

<h3 id="checking-ourselves">checking ourselves</h3>

<p>There are a few ways to test that we page walked correctly, an easy check is to just dump the memory at the virtual and physical address and compare them, if they look the same we were probably right:</p>

<p>Physical:</p>
<div><pre><code>gef➤  monitor xp/10gx 0x8c07da8
0000000008c07da8: 0xffffffff810effb6 0xffffffff88c07dc0
0000000008c07db8: 0xffffffff810f3685 0xffffffff88c07de0
0000000008c07dc8: 0xffffffff8737dce3 0xffffffff88c3ea80
0000000008c07dd8: 0xdffffc0000000000 0xffffffff88c07e98
0000000008c07de8: 0xffffffff8138ab1e 0x0000000000000000
</code></pre></div>

<p>Virtual:</p>
<div><pre><code>gef➤  x/10gx 0xffffffff88c07da8
0xffffffff88c07da8:	0xffffffff810effb6	0xffffffff88c07dc0
0xffffffff88c07db8:	0xffffffff810f3685	0xffffffff88c07de0
0xffffffff88c07dc8:	0xffffffff8737dce3	0xffffffff88c3ea80
0xffffffff88c07dd8:	0xdffffc0000000000	0xffffffff88c07e98
0xffffffff88c07de8:	0xffffffff8138ab1e	0x0000000000000000
</code></pre></div>

<p>Looks good to me!</p>

<p>Another way to check is using the <code>monitor gva2gpa</code> (guest virtual address to guest physical address) command exposed to gdb by the QEMU Monitor:</p>

<div><pre><code>gef➤  monitor gva2gpa 0xffffffff88c07da8
gpa: 0x8c07da8
</code></pre></div>

<p>Assuming QEMU is doing address translation correctly (probably a fair assumption), then looks like we have double confirmation that our page walk was successful!</p>

<h2 id="wrapping-up">wrapping up</h2>

<p>Hopefully by the end of this you have a pretty solid understanding of how paging works on x86_64 systems. I wanted to pack a lot of information into the post so it took some thought to figure out how to organize all of it and I’m still not sure if this was a great way to go about it.</p>

<p>Anyways, I think paging is pretty neat and I think its one of those things where once you get it you’ve got it, but getting to that point can take some time and some screwing around in gdb.</p>

<p>I’d also like to mention that the inspiration for the diagrams of the various page table entries I made for this post came from the documentation of the <a href="https://github.com/jart/blink/">blink</a> project: <a href="https://github.com/jart/blink/blob/46d82a0ced97c0df1fc645c5d81a88f0d142fbfd/blink/machine.h#L61">blink/machine.h</a>.</p>

<p>Thanks for reading!</p>

<p>TinyML or Tiny Machine Learning refers to the <strong>use of Machine Learning in microcontrollers</strong>. In systems that unlike those used in traditional ML have few resources, are systems that have little CPU, little RAM and extremely low power consumption in the order of magnitude of milliwatts or microwatts.</p>



<p>Its official website is the <a href="https://www.tinyml.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">TinyML Foundation</a>.</p>



<p>What is done is to reduce large models for use with equipment with very few resources and microcontrollers. The preferred field of the Makers.</p>




<p>I have started a series of 3 courses offered by Harvard for free</p>



<ol>
<li><em><a href="https://www.edx.org/learn/machine-learning/harvard-university-fundamentals-of-tinyml" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fundamentals of TinyML</a></em> (What do I build, what for and what are the problems)</li>



<li><em>Applications of TinyML</em> (data-driven, bias, etc) </li>



<li><em>Deploying TinyML</em> (where do we put our models, security and privacy)</li>
</ol>



<p>The following notes are from the first Fundamentals of TinyML where they explain what it is, when it is applied, the different techniques that are used, etc, etc.</p>



<p>Embedded systems using microcontrollers cannot work with the large models, as they have memories up to 256kB. Here are some examples of operating systems that can be used with microcontrollers</p>



<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.freertos.org/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">FreeRTOS</a></li>



<li><a href="https://os.mbed.com/mbed-os/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mbed OS</a></li>
</ul>



<p><a href="https://www.ikkaro.net/machine-learning/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Machine Learning</a> consists of algorithms that search for patterns in data.</p>



<p>With TinyML, techniques are used to compress these algorithms so that they remain effective in finding patterns in data.</p>



<p>There are 5 quintillion bytes of data produced daily by IoT and only less than 1% is analyzed.</p>



<h2><span id="Algorithm_compression_techniques">Algorithm compression techniques</span></h2>



<p>Some algorithm compression techniques are:</p>



<h3><span id="Pruning">Pruning</span></h3>



<p><strong>Pruning Synapsis:</strong> We remove network connections from the model. Sometimes it can decrease the accuracy.</p>



<p><strong>Pruning Neurons:</strong> We can also eliminate entire neurons from our model which reduces the computational demand of the network.</p>



<h3><span id="Quantization">Quantization</span></h3>



<p>It consists of discretizing the values within a small range. For example if we discretize a float within the range -128 to 127 we only have to traverse 256 values. Going from a float point value that is stored in 4 bytes to an integer value that is stored in 1 byte implies a x4 reduction in size.</p>



<p>Quantization is going to be critical in TinyML due to the limited resources available.</p>



<h3><span id="Knowledge_distillation">Knowledge distillation</span></h3>



<p>Apply our knowledge and know how to make the model small.</p>



<h2><span id="Tools">Tools</span></h2>



<p>We use Tensor Flow Lite. While tensorFlow is focused on ML Researcher, Tensor Flow Lite is for Application Developer.</p>



<h2><span id="Uses_of_TinyML">Uses of TinyML</span></h2>



<p>Although they are not cited, of course being on this website we can find <strong>uses of TinyML dedicated to the DIY, Maker and Hacker world</strong>.</p>



<h3><span id="Uses_of_TinyML_in_Industry">Uses of TinyML in Industry</span></h3>



<p>In Industry, in maintenance, to warn us when there are vibrations that indicate that there will be breakage, etc, etc. increases efficiency and reduces costs. The negative points are the accuracy that can give us false alarms. In case of false alarm whose responsibility is the operator or the system.</p>



<h3><span id="TinyML_in_the_environment">TinyML in the environment</span></h3>



<p>Instead of collecting data that then has to be processed, with TinyML we have real-time answers about changes in the environment, for example in the life of wild animals.</p>



<h3><span id="TinyML_for_humans">TinyML for humans</span></h3>



<p>Helps people with disabilities to perform more tasks without having to use their hands. Improving the UI and UX of applications to make them easier to use.</p>

<ul>
<li>Will it work well across all population groups? </li>

Those are some very big impacts. Now, let’s add in the nuance.</span></p><p><span>First, it is important to know that this effort was multidisciplinary, involving multiple types of experiments and hundreds of interviews, conducted by a great team, including the Harvard social scientists </span><a href="https://www.fabriziodellacqua.com/" rel="">Fabrizio Dell’Acqua</a><span>, </span><a href="https://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/profile.aspx?facId=772797" rel="">Edward McFowland III</a><span>, and </span><a href="https://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/profile.aspx?facId=240491" rel="">Karim Lakhani</a><span>; </span><a href="https://www.hilalifshitz.com/" rel="">Hila Lifshitz-Assaf</a><span> from Warwick Business School and</span><a href="https://mitsloan.mit.edu/faculty/directory/kate-kellogg" rel=""> Katherine Kellogg </a><span>of MIT (plus myself). </span><a href="https://bcghendersoninstitute.com/contributors/saran-rajendran/" rel="">Saran Rajendran</a><span>, </span><a href="https://bcghendersoninstitute.com/contributors/lisa-krayer/" rel="">Lisa Krayer</a><span>, and </span><a href="https://www.bcg.com/about/people/experts/francois-candelon" rel="">François Candelon</a><span> ran the experiment on the BCG side, using a full 7% of its consulting force (758 consultants). They all did a lot of very careful work that goes far, far beyond the post. So, please </span><a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4573321" rel="">look at the paper to make sure you get all the details</a><span> - especially if you have questions about numbers or methods. I need to simplify a lot to fit 58 pages of findings into a post, and any mistakes are mine, not my co-authors. Also, while we pre-registered these experiments, this is still a new working paper, so there might be errors or mistakes, and the paper is not yet peer-reviewed. With that in mind, let’s get to the details…</span></p><p>AI is weird. No one actually knows the full range of capabilities of the most advanced Large Language Models, like GPT-4. No one really knows the best ways to use them, or the conditions under which they fail. There is no instruction manual. On some tasks AI is immensely powerful, and on others it fails completely or subtly. And, unless you use AI a lot, you won’t know which is which.</p><p><span>The result is what we call the “Jagged Frontier” of AI. Imagine a fortress wall, with some towers and battlements jutting out into the countryside, while others fold back towards the center of the castle. That wall is the capability of AI, and the further from the center, the harder the task. Everything inside the wall can be done by the AI, everything outside is hard for the AI to do. The problem is that the wall is invisible, so some tasks that might logically seem to be the same distance away from the center, and therefore equally difficult – say, writing a sonnet and an exactly 50 word poem – are actually on different sides of the wall. The AI is great at the sonnet, but, because of how it conceptualizes the world in tokens, rather than words, it consistently produces poems of more or less than 50 words.&nbsp; Similarly, some unexpected tasks (</span><a href="https://www.oneusefulthing.org/p/automating-creativity" rel="">like idea generation</a><span>) are easy for AIs while other tasks that seem to be easy for machines to do (like basic math) are challenges for LLMs.</span></p><p>I asked the ChatGPT with Code Interpreter to visualize this for you:</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F237aac17-b0ac-4174-9c0b-6b3e5e9ba0be_1551x1580.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F237aac17-b0ac-4174-9c0b-6b3e5e9ba0be_1551x1580.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F237aac17-b0ac-4174-9c0b-6b3e5e9ba0be_1551x1580.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F237aac17-b0ac-4174-9c0b-6b3e5e9ba0be_1551x1580.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F237aac17-b0ac-4174-9c0b-6b3e5e9ba0be_1551x1580.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F237aac17-b0ac-4174-9c0b-6b3e5e9ba0be_1551x1580.png" width="330" height="336.1195054945055" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/237aac17-b0ac-4174-9c0b-6b3e5e9ba0be_1551x1580.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1483,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:330,&quot;bytes&quot;:93754,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;Hey GPT, I want you to create an image to illustrate our new paper on the effects of AI and work.

We gave those who were allowed to use AI access to GPT-4, the same model everyone in 169 countries can access for free with Bing, or by paying $20 a month to OpenAI. No special fine-tuning or prompting, just GPT-4 through the API.</p><p>We then did a lot of pre-testing and surveying to establish baselines, and asked consultants to do a wide variety of work for a fictional shoe company, work that the BCG team had selected to accurately represent what consultants do. There were creative tasks (“Propose at least 10 ideas for a new shoe targeting an underserved market or sport.”), analytical tasks (“Segment the footwear industry market based on users.”), writing and marketing tasks (“Draft a press release marketing copy for your product.”), and persuasiveness tasks (“Pen an inspirational memo to employees detailing why your product would outshine competitors.”). We even checked with a shoe company executive to ensure that this work was realistic - they were. And, knowing AI, these are tasks that we might expect to be inside the frontier.</p><p>In line with our theories, and as we have discussed, we found that the consultants with AI access did significantly better, whether we briefly introduced them to AI first (the “overview” group in the diagram) or did not. This was true for every measurement, whether the time it took to complete tasks, the number of tasks completed overall (we gave them an overall time limit) or the quality of the outputs. We rated that quality using both human and AI graders, who agreed with each other (itself an interesting finding).</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0ffa6d74-dc5d-45fc-9fe0-b1511556716a_1028x814.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0ffa6d74-dc5d-45fc-9fe0-b1511556716a_1028x814.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0ffa6d74-dc5d-45fc-9fe0-b1511556716a_1028x814.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0ffa6d74-dc5d-45fc-9fe0-b1511556716a_1028x814.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0ffa6d74-dc5d-45fc-9fe0-b1511556716a_1028x814.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0ffa6d74-dc5d-45fc-9fe0-b1511556716a_1028x814.png" width="582" height="460.84435797665367" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/0ffa6d74-dc5d-45fc-9fe0-b1511556716a_1028x814.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:814,&quot;width&quot;:1028,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:582,&quot;bytes&quot;:436765,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0ffa6d74-dc5d-45fc-9fe0-b1511556716a_1028x814.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0ffa6d74-dc5d-45fc-9fe0-b1511556716a_1028x814.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0ffa6d74-dc5d-45fc-9fe0-b1511556716a_1028x814.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0ffa6d74-dc5d-45fc-9fe0-b1511556716a_1028x814.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>We also found something else interesting, an effect that is increasingly apparent in other studies of AI: it works as a skill leveler. The consultants who scored the worst when we assessed them at the start of the experiment had the biggest jump in their performance, 43%, when they got to use AI. The top consultants still got a boost, but less of one. Looking at these results, I do not think enough people are considering what it means when a technology raises all workers to the top tiers of performance. It may be like how it used to matter whether miners were good or bad at digging through rock… until the steam shovel was invented and now differences in digging ability do not matter anymore. AI is not quite at that level of change, but skill levelling is going to have a big impact.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F970b3354-1bac-4146-a92f-57f65440f872_1228x610.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F970b3354-1bac-4146-a92f-57f65440f872_1228x610.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F970b3354-1bac-4146-a92f-57f65440f872_1228x610.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F970b3354-1bac-4146-a92f-57f65440f872_1228x610.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F970b3354-1bac-4146-a92f-57f65440f872_1228x610.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F970b3354-1bac-4146-a92f-57f65440f872_1228x610.png" width="1228" height="610" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/970b3354-1bac-4146-a92f-57f65440f872_1228x610.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:610,&quot;width&quot;:1228,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:97820,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F970b3354-1bac-4146-a92f-57f65440f872_1228x610.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F970b3354-1bac-4146-a92f-57f65440f872_1228x610.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F970b3354-1bac-4146-a92f-57f65440f872_1228x610.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F970b3354-1bac-4146-a92f-57f65440f872_1228x610.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>But there is more to the story. BCG designed one more task, this one carefully selected to ensure that the AI couldn’t come to a correct answer. This wasn’t easy. As we say in the paper “since AI proved surprisingly capable, it was difficult to design a task in this experiment outside the AI’s frontier where humans with high human capital doing their job would consistently outperform AI.” But we identified a task that used the blind spots of AI to ensure it would give a wrong, but convincing, answer to a problem that humans would be able to solve. Indeed, human consultants got the problem right 84% of the time without AI help, but when consultants used the AI, they did worse – only getting it right 60-70% of the time.

In an experiment, he found that recruiters who used high-quality AI became lazy, careless, and less skilled in their own judgment. They missed out on some brilliant applicants and made worse decisions than recruiters who used low-quality AI or no AI at all. When the AI is very good, humans have no reason to work hard and pay attention. They let the AI take over, instead of using it as a tool. He called this “falling asleep at the wheel”, and it can hurt human learning, skill development, and productivity.</span></p><p>In our experiment, we also found that the consultants fell asleep at the wheel – those using AI actually had less accurate answers than those who were not allowed to use AI (but they still did a better job writing up the results than consultants who did not use AI). The authoritativeness of AI can be deceptive if you don’t know where the frontier lies.</p><p>But a lot of consultants did get both inside and outside the frontier tasks right, gaining the benefits of AI without the disadvantages. The key seemed to be following one of two approaches: becoming a Centaur or becoming a Cyborg. Fortunately, this does not involve any actual grafting of electronic gizmos to your body or getting cursed to turn into the half-human/half-horse of Greek myth. They are rather two approaches to navigating the jagged frontier of AI that integrates the work of person and machine.</p><p>Centaur work has a clear line between person and machine, like the clear line between the human torso and horse body of the mythical centaur. &nbsp;Centaurs have a strategic division of labor, switching between AI and human tasks, allocating responsibilities based on the strengths and capabilities of each entity. When I am doing an analysis with the help of AI, I often approach it as a Centaur. I will decide on what statistical techniques to do, but then let the AI handle producing graphs. In our study at BCG, centaurs would do the work they were strongest at themselves, and then hand off tasks inside the jagged frontier to the AI.</p><p><span>On the other hand, Cyborgs blend machine and person, integrating the two deeply. Cyborgs don't just delegate tasks; they intertwine their efforts with AI, moving back and forth over the jagged frontier. Bits of tasks get handed to the AI, such as initiating a sentence for the AI to complete, so that Cyborgs find themselves working in tandem with the AI. </span><a href="https://www.oneusefulthing.org/p/embracing-weirdness-what-it-means" rel="">This is how I suggest approaching using AI for writing</a><span>, for example. It is also how I generated two of the illustrations in the paper (the Jagged Frontier image and the 54 line graph, both of which were built by ChatGPT, with my initial direction and guidance)</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd38f8137-74ed-4772-b1e3-580a1c18f170_1955x768.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd38f8137-74ed-4772-b1e3-580a1c18f170_1955x768.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd38f8137-74ed-4772-b1e3-580a1c18f170_1955x768.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd38f8137-74ed-4772-b1e3-580a1c18f170_1955x768.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd38f8137-74ed-4772-b1e3-580a1c18f170_1955x768.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd38f8137-74ed-4772-b1e3-580a1c18f170_1955x768.png" width="1456" height="572" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/d38f8137-74ed-4772-b1e3-580a1c18f170_1955x768.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:572,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:342709,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd38f8137-74ed-4772-b1e3-580a1c18f170_1955x768.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd38f8137-74ed-4772-b1e3-580a1c18f170_1955x768.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd38f8137-74ed-4772-b1e3-580a1c18f170_1955x768.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd38f8137-74ed-4772-b1e3-580a1c18f170_1955x768.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p><span>Our paper, along with a stream of excellent </span><a href="https://www.oneusefulthing.org/p/secret-cyborgs-the-present-disruption" rel="">work </a><span>by other scholars, suggests that, regardless of the philosophic and technical debates over the nature and future of AI, it is already a powerful disrupter to how we actually work. And this is not a hyped new technology that will change the world in five years, or that requires a lot of investment and the resources of huge companies - it is here, NOW. The tools the elite consultants used to supercharge their work are the exact same as the ones available to everyone reading this post. And the tools the consultants used will soon be much worse than what is available to you. Because the technological frontier is not just jagged, it is expanding. I am very confident that in the next year, at least two companies will release models more powerful than GPT-4. The Jagged Frontier advances, and we have to be ready for that.</span></p><p>Even aside from any anxiety that statement might cause, it is also worth noting the other downsides of AI. People really can go on autopilot when using AI, falling asleep at the wheel and failing to notice AI mistakes. And, like other research, we also found that AI outputs, while of higher quality than that of humans, were also a bit homogenous and same-y in aggregate. Which is why Cyborgs and Centaurs are important - they allow humans to work with AI to produce more varied, more correct, and better results than either humans or AI can do alone. And becoming one is not hard. Just use AI enough for work tasks and you will start to see the shape of the jagged frontier, and start to understand where AI is scarily good... and where it falls short.</p><p>In my mind, the question is no longer about whether AI is going to reshape work, but what we want that to mean. We get to make choices about how we want to use AI help to make work more productive, interesting, and meaningful. But we have to make those choices soon, so that we can begin to actively use AI in ethical and valuable ways, as Cyborgs and Centaurs, rather than merely reacting to technological change. Meanwhile, the Jagged Frontier advances.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4573321" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F855e050e-a17e-41d4-9121-27cf464ab670_1042x1238.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F855e050e-a17e-41d4-9121-27cf464ab670_1042x1238.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F855e050e-a17e-41d4-9121-27cf464ab670_1042x1238.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F855e050e-a17e-41d4-9121-27cf464ab670_1042x1238.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F855e050e-a17e-41d4-9121-27cf464ab670_1042x1238.png" width="328" height="389.6967370441459" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/855e050e-a17e-41d4-9121-27cf464ab670_1042x1238.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1238,&quot;width&quot;:1042,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:328,&quot;bytes&quot;:462487,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:&quot;https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4573321&quot;,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F855e050e-a17e-41d4-9121-27cf464ab670_1042x1238.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F855e050e-a17e-41d4-9121-27cf464ab670_1042x1238.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F855e050e-a17e-41d4-9121-27cf464ab670_1042x1238.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F855e050e-a17e-41d4-9121-27cf464ab670_1042x1238.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.oneusefulthing.org/p/centaurs-and-cyborgs-on-the-jagged?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a href="https://www.oneusefulthing.org/p/centaurs-and-cyborgs-on-the-jagged?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share" rel=""><span>Share</span></a></p></div></article></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Mission Sending Files from Earth to a Satellite to Demonstrate How IPFS Can Improve Communications Across Long Distances</em></p><p>Filecoin Foundation (FF) successfully completed a first-of-its-kind mission deploying the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) in space. The recent demonstration involved sending files from Earth to orbit and back using an implementation of the IPFS protocol designed for space communications.</p><p>This mission, conducted with Lockheed Martin-developed software, demonstrated how IPFS – a decentralized content distribution system – can bring the benefits of decentralized technologies to space to enable better communications across long distances and resilience in challenging environments.</p><p>As part of the demonstration, <a href="https://github.com/ipfs/papers/raw/master/ipfs-cap2pfs/ipfs-p2p-file-system.pdf">the IPFS white paper</a> and an image of FF’s mascot (Biscuit, the “FileCorgi”) were transmitted to an orbiting LM LINUSS ™CubeSat and back using a purpose-built IPFS implementation that ran atop <a href="https://www.lockheedmartin.com/content/lockheed-martin/en-us/news/features/2024/smartsat-equipped-satellite-uploads-new-mission-on-orbit.html">Lockheed Martin’s SmartSat technology</a>, a software platform that makes it easier to dynamically add and quickly change missions in orbit through simple app uploads.</p><p>This successful demonstration follows nearly three years of collaboration. FF and Lockheed Martin Space initially <a href="https://fil.org/blog/filecoin-foundation-and-lockheed-martin-bring-decentralized-storage-to-space/">announced the collaboration</a> in Davos in May 2022, and <a href="https://fil.org/blog/ff-x-lockheed-martin-mission-announcement/">announced details of the mission</a> in Davos in January 2023.</p><p>“IPFS is called the ‘interplanetary’ file system because, from the beginning, IPFS was envisioned as a technology that could enable networking in space,” said Marta Belcher, president and chair of FF. “We could not be more thrilled to make that vision a reality, thanks to the amazing team at Lockheed Martin Space.”</p><p>This mission demonstrates several key benefits of using IPFS for communications and networking in space:</p><p><em>Faster Communications</em> – Today’s centralized Internet model doesn’t work in space. In a centralized Internet model, data is retrieved from a particular server in a particular place. On Earth, the delay of retrieving that data may not be noticeable. But if you’re on the moon, there will be a multi-second delay each time you retrieve data from Earth. With IPFS, data doesn’t need to go back and forth from Earth with every click. That’s because, with IPFS, data is identified by what it is rather than where it is. Each piece of content has a unique “content ID.” When you look for a piece of content, that content is retrieved from wherever is closest, rather than being retrieved from a particular server in a particular place. That means if someone nearby already has that data, it only has to travel a short distance and can get to you quickly instead of traveling back and forth from Earth with every click.</p><p><em>Data Verification</em> – With IPFS, each piece of content has a unique identifier called a “content ID.” If a piece of content is altered, its content ID will be different as a result. That means that, by using IPFS, you can cryptographically verify that data has not been modified. This is also useful for authenticating data from space. For example, if a satellite takes photographs and then transmits them to the ground using IPFS, it is possible to cryptographically prove that those images were not tampered with, and are, in fact, the original images taken by the satellite.</p><p><em>Data Resilience</em> – One challenge with storing data in space is that the data can easily be corrupted by radiation, or the storage hardware can be damaged by debris. In a centralized Internet model, data is stored in a particular location on a particular piece of hardware, and when you are trying to retrieve that data, there is only one place you can retrieve it from. To put it another way: imagine that you recommend a book to a friend, but you don’t tell your friend the name of the book – instead, you tell your friend that the book is in the New York Public Library, on the third floor, on the second shelf from the left, five books over. That’s how today’s centralized Internet model works – you’re looking for content in a particular location on a particular server. But it makes much more sense to tell your friend the name of the book, and let them find it wherever is closest and most convenient. That’s how IPFS works. With IPFS, you can store many copies of the data in many different locations. When you retrieve data using IPFS, you are looking for a particular content ID rather than looking for data at a particular location. That content will be retrieved from wherever is closest – so if there are many copies of the data, it doesn’t matter if some of those copies have been lost or corrupted (as is often the case when data is being stored in space).</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="main">
<article><header><time datetime="2024-01-16 12:27:07">
	16 ene 2024 / <a href="https://jcarlosroldan.com/code/">code</a>, <a href="https://jcarlosroldan.com/think/">think</a></time></header><p>It's no secret that authenticating into services is an unresolved topic. With time, we have managed to make them more secure, but that was at the expense of user experience. The new generation of mail codes and authenticator apps has moved us from the ease of one-click browser autocomplete to complex ordeals involving multiple steps and sometimes multiple devices.</p>
<p>Last month, I was logging into Notion after it automatically logged me out, and I couldn't help but think "It feels like I'm logging in here every second week; maybe I'm doing something wrong." After a long examination of the settings, I decided to open a ticket asking if the session length was indeed that short. The response from Notion's team was prompt and specific, a great example of customer service. However, the content of the answer was less pleasing.</p>
<p><img src="https://jcarlosroldan.com/static/172.png" alt="Notion response"></p>
<p>Notion is not alone in this; many other services enforce similarly short sessions and uncomfortable methods. This has me pondering the evolution of our authentication methods, from their ancient beginnings to modern complexities. Let's take a look at the history of authentication methods and rate them on two scales: user experience and security.</p>
<p>The first recorded password in western history is the book of Judges. Within the text, Gileadite soldiers used the word "shibboleth" to detect their enemies, the Ephraimites. The Ephraimites spoke in a different dialect so that they would say "sibboleth" instead. <strong>Experience ★★★★★:</strong> you just had to say a word. <strong>Security ☆☆☆☆☆:</strong> there's a single word to authenticate multiple users and it can be cracked by learning how to spell it.</p>
<p>Ancient Romans also relied on passwords in a similar manner called them "watchwords". Every night, roman military guards would pass around a wooden tablet with the watchword inscribed and every military man would pass the tablet around until every encampment marked their initials. During night patrols, soldiers would whisper the watchword to identify allies. <strong>Experience ★★★☆☆:</strong> you just had to say a word but you have to memorize it every day. <strong>Security ★☆☆☆☆:</strong> it changes every day, but it's still a single word, and without a "forgot password" button, a wrong answer would mean a spear in the gut.</p>
<p>Fast forward to the '20s, alcohol became illegal in the US, and speakeasies (illegal drinking establishments) were born. To enter the speakeasy, people had to quietly whisper a code word to keep law enforcement from finding out. Code words were ridiculous, to say the least: coffin varnish, monkey rum, panther sweat, and tarantula juice, to name a few. <strong>Experience ★★★★☆:</strong> you just had to say a word, and they were made to be memorable. <strong>Security ★☆☆☆☆:</strong> it's a single word, and it's not even a secret, but at least you don't get stabbed for getting it wrong.</p>
<p>The first recorded usage of a password in the digital age is attributed to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fernando_J._Corbat%C3%B3">Dr. Fernando Corbató</a>. In the 60's, monolithic machines could only work on one problem at a time, which meant that the queue of jobs waiting to be processed was huge and a lot of processing time was lost. He developed an operating system called the Compatible Time-Sharing System (CTSS) that broke large processing tasks into smaller components and gave small slices of time to each task. Since multiple users were sharing one computer, files had to be assigned to individual researchers and available only to them, so he gave every user a unique name and password to access their files stored in the database. However, these passwords were stored in a plaintext file in the computer and there were a few cases of accidental and intentional password leaks. <strong>Experience ★★★☆☆:</strong> you have to remember a user and password. <strong>Security ★★☆☆☆:</strong> it's one per user, but they're stored in plaintext.</p>
<p>To prevent the problem of plaintext passwords, <a href="https://jcarlosroldan.com/files/MorrisThompson79-password-hashing.pdf">Robert Morris and Ken Thompson</a> developed a simulation of a World War 2 crypto machine that scrambled the password before storing it into the system. This way, the system could ask for the password, scramble it, and compare it to the scrambled password stored in the system, a process called one-way hashing. This simulation was included in 6th Edition Unix in 1974, and got several improvements up to our days, but the basic idea remains the same. <strong>Experience ★★★☆☆:</strong> you have to remember a user and password. <strong>Security ★★★☆☆:</strong> it's no longer plaintext, but stealing it would still give you access to the system.</p>
<p><img src="https://jcarlosroldan.com/static/173.png" alt="A Hagelin rotor crypto machine"></p>
<p>Over time, many different problems arised from the fact that people use the same password for multiple services, so the industry started to push for unique passwords for each service. This was a problem for users, since they had to remember a lot of passwords, and password managers were borned. The first password manager was developed by <a href="https://www.schneier.com/">Bruce Schneier</a> in 1997, and currently every major browser comes with a built-in one, often with an option to generate strong passwords and store them for you. <strong>Experience ★★★★☆:</strong> you have to remember a master password, but the browser remembers the rest. <strong>Security ★★★★☆:</strong> it's no longer plaintext, but the master password is the weakest link in the chain.</p>
<p>Phishing attacks and data breaches have made passwords a liability, so the industry has been pushing for multiple-factor authentication (MFA) for a while now. 2FA is a method of authentication that requires two different factors to verify your identity. The first factor is usually something you know, like a password, and the second factor is something you have, like a phone. This way, even if someone steals your password, they still need your phone to log in. There is a myriad of ways to implement 2FA, but the most common ones are SMS codes, authenticator apps, and mail codes. It is often used in conjunction with very short session lengths. <strong>Experience ☆☆☆☆☆:</strong> you have to remember something, have a phone or mail app, and it requires multiple steps. <strong>Security ★★★★☆:</strong> it's no longer a single factor, but it's still vulnerable to phishing attacks.</p>
<p>I, like most people, hate passwords and all means of authentication bureaucracy. And it looks like we're now at the lowest point in history in terms of UX. There is still hope with the rise of Single Sign-On (SSO) and biometrics. And certainly <a href="https://safety.google/authentication/passkey/">passkeys</a>, which are getting a lot of traction lately, are a step in the right direction.

Child custody is one of them.<p>I think with legal docs generally, you have to decide what the stakes are and act accordingly. In general, keep in mind that most lawyers won't take a case unless there's someone with deep pockets to sue. So for that $20k loan you give to a friend, a boilerplate template is fine; if they don't want to pay you back, a lawsuit is gonna cost you more than the loan anyway. You've got a new startup for website monitoring with 20 customers? Worry about growing your userbase, not the remote chance that you get sued and something in the boilerplate docs you used wasn't worded properly (of course, once you raise significant money or have significant revenue, those legal docs become much more important, and also this doesn't apply if you are working on something with significant risk, such as a medical device).</p><p>But child custody isn't one of those things. It is high stakes, the chances that your counterparty will sue you are very high, and a bad outcome might be one of the worst things that can happen to you. Personally, the possibility of losing custody of my children would be much more worrying to me than any financial lawsuit.

          - Insurance requirements from your insurer or your clients insurer
          - Clauses not there that should be there
          - Clauses there that are not good enough
          - Clauses there that should not be there
</code></pre>
Free/cheap docs are all fun and games until the shit hits the fan and you need to rely on them.  Its at that point you'll find yourself wishing you ponied up for a lawyer. Trust me, been there, done that, got the postcard, never again.<p>Paying a lawyer to help you with legal documents is a necessary business expense.  Just like paying taxes, either you pay upfront or you pay the penalty later.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://nashby.github.io/2024/01/15/ruby-3-on-rails-1/">https://nashby.github.io/2024/01/15/ruby-3-on-rails-1/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39012235">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  
  <p><span>15 Jan 2024</span></p><p><code>Rails 8.0</code> has recently branched out on Github, and I found myself curious about the feasibility of running <code>Rails 1.0</code> on the latest Ruby version. While I was pretty sure it wouldn’t work right off the bat, I wondered: how many modifications would be necessary to at least reach the iconic “Welcome aboard! You’re riding the Rails!” screen?</p>

<p>So, let’s dive in. My starting point was this Gemfile:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>source</span> <span>"https://rubygems.org"</span>
<span>gem</span> <span>"rails"</span><span>,</span> <span>"1.0.0"</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Since I knew that it would be required to make some changes to Rails gems I install it with <code>bundle install --local</code>. This would allow for easier modifications later on. My first attempt was running <code>bundle exec rails --help</code>:</p>

<div><pre><code>/activesupport-1.2.5/lib/active_support/inflector.rb:157: syntax error, unexpected ':', expecting `then' or ',' or ';' or '\n' (SyntaxError)
        when 1: "#{number}st"
              ^
</code></pre></div>

<p>Indeed, older Ruby versions allowed the use of a colon in place of <code>then</code> in case/when expressions. This syntax is no longer supported, so I updated it across the codebase to match the current Ruby syntax.</p>

<p>Ok let’s try again with <code>bundle exec rails --help</code>:</p>

<div><pre><code>cannot load such file -- parsedate (LoadError)
</code></pre></div>

<p>Oh yeah, <code>parsedate</code> lib that was shipped with <code>Ruby 1.8</code> is not longer there. It was used to parse date strings, like so:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>ParseDate</span><span>.</span><span>parsedate</span> <span>"Tuesday, July 5th, 2007, 18:35:20 UTC"</span>
<span># =&gt; [2007, 7, 5, 18, 35, 20, "UTC", 2]</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Not sure why it was returning an array but ok. Now I can replace it with <code>DateTime.parse</code> that returns <code>DateTime</code> object. So I’ve fixed that and tried to run it again. Ugh, another error:</p>

<div><pre><code>rails-1.0.0/lib/rails_generator/options.rb:124: syntax error, unexpected '[', expecting '|' (SyntaxError)
...make any changes.') { |options[:pretend]| }
</code></pre></div>

<p>That’s some weird syntax. Turns out you could assign something to a hash right inside the block variable thing:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>opt</span><span>.</span><span>on</span><span>(</span><span>'-p'</span><span>,</span> <span>'--pretend'</span><span>,</span> <span>'Run but do not make any changes.'</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span> <span>|</span><span>options</span><span>[</span><span>:pretend</span><span>]</span><span>|</span> <span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>meaning that whatever you pass as <code>-p</code> option will end up being assigned to <code>options[:pretend]</code>. Basically it equals to</p>

<div><pre><code><span>opt</span><span>.</span><span>on</span><span>(</span><span>'-p'</span><span>,</span> <span>'--pretend'</span><span>,</span> <span>'Run but do not make any changes.'</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span> <span>|</span><span>o</span><span>|</span> <span>options</span><span>[</span><span>:pretend</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>o</span> <span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Alrighty then. Rerun <code>bundle exec rails --help</code>:</p>

<div><pre><code>no implicit conversion of Enumerator into Array
</code></pre></div>

<p>And it’s without any stacktrace. Great. Looks like something catches all the errors and just prints them. After
some investigation I’ve found this code:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>cache</span>
  <span>@cache</span> <span>||=</span> <span>sources</span><span>.</span><span>inject</span><span>([])</span> <span>{</span> <span>|</span><span>cache</span><span>,</span> <span>source</span><span>|</span> <span>cache</span> <span>+</span> <span>source</span><span>.</span><span>map</span> <span>}</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>In Ruby 1.8 <code>[].map</code> would return an array but now it returns <code>Enumerator</code> object and you can concat an <code>Array</code> with
<code>Enumerator</code> hence the error:</p>

<div><pre><code>irb(main):001&gt; [] + [].map
(irb):1:in `+': no implicit conversion of Enumerator into Array (TypeError)
</code></pre></div>

<p>It’s an easy fix though. Let’s just call <code>.to_a</code> on the <code>source</code>:</p>

<div><pre><code>def cache
  @cache ||= sources.inject([]) { |cache, source| cache + source.to_a }
end
</code></pre></div>

<p>Are we getting there?</p>

<div><pre><code>bundle exec rails --help

`load': cannot load such file -- config.rb (LoadError)
</code></pre></div>

<p>The code in question is</p>

<div><pre><code><span>require</span> <span>'rbconfig'</span>

<span>DEFAULT_SHEBANG</span> <span>=</span> <span>File</span><span>.</span><span>join</span><span>(</span><span>Config</span><span>::</span><span>CONFIG</span><span>[</span><span>'bindir'</span><span>],</span>
                            <span>Config</span><span>::</span><span>CONFIG</span><span>[</span><span>'ruby_install_name'</span><span>])</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Makes sense, in old Ruby <code>RbConfig</code> could be referenced with <code>Config</code> constant and now it’s only <code>RbConfig</code>. Fixed. Does it work now?</p>

<div><pre><code>bundle exec rails --help

Usage: /vendor/bundle/ruby/3.3.0/bin/rails /path/to/your/app [options]
</code></pre></div>

<p>Great Scott! It works! Let’s try to generate a new app:</p>

<div><pre><code>bundle exec rails blog

undefined method `exists?' for class File
</code></pre></div>

<p>Dammit, <code>File.exists?</code>/<code>FileTest.exists?</code> were removed in Ruby 1.9. Let’s replace it with <code>File.exist?</code>/<code>FileTest.exist?</code> and try again:</p>

<div><pre><code>bundle exec rails blog
      create
      create  app/controllers
      create  app/helpers
      create  app/models
      create  app/views/layouts
      create  config/environments
      create  components
      create  db
      create  doc
      create  lib
      create  lib/tasks
      create  log
      create  public/images
      create  public/javascripts
      create  public/stylesheets
      create  script/performance
      create  script/process
      create  test/fixtures
      create  test/functional
      create  test/mocks/development
      create  test/mocks/test
      create  test/unit
      create  vendor
      create  vendor/plugins
      create  Rakefile
      create  README
      create  app/controllers/application.rb
Cannot create Binding object for non-Ruby caller
</code></pre></div>

<p>Success! Is it though? It has generated an app but all the files are empty. And if you have a sharp eye you’ll have noticed this error:</p>

<div><pre><code>Cannot create Binding object for non-Ruby caller
</code></pre></div>

<p>Again, no stacktracks, just some plain error. It took me some time to locate that line of code that was failing with such error but here it is:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>file</span><span>(</span><span>relative_source</span><span>,</span> <span>relative_destination</span><span>,</span> <span>template_options</span><span>)</span> <span>do</span> <span>|</span><span>file</span><span>|</span>
  <span># Evaluate any assignments in a temporary, throwaway binding.</span>
  <span>vars</span> <span>=</span> <span>template_options</span><span>[</span><span>:assigns</span><span>]</span> <span>||</span> <span>{}</span>
  <span>b</span> <span>=</span> <span>binding</span>
  <span>vars</span><span>.</span><span>each</span> <span>{</span> <span>|</span><span>k</span><span>,</span><span>v</span><span>|</span> <span>eval</span> <span>"</span><span>#{</span><span>k</span><span>}</span><span> = vars[:</span><span>#{</span><span>k</span><span>}</span><span>] || vars['</span><span>#{</span><span>k</span><span>}</span><span>']"</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span> <span>}</span>

  <span>...</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Believe me, I really tried to figure you what this error was about given that it’s obviously a Ruby caller but luck wasn’t there for me. Then I tried to replace <code>binding</code> with <code>Kernel.binding</code>
and it worked… If you know what’s going on here please let me know! Maybe Rails were redefining <code>binding</code> somewhere?</p>

<p>Alright, let’s proceed:</p>

<div><pre><code>bundle exec rails blog
      create
      create  app/controllers
      create  app/helpers
      create  app/models
      ...
</code></pre></div>

<p>Finally! The app is generated, files are not empty. We’re close, I can smell it! Let’s try to start it:</p>

<div><pre><code> bundle exec ruby script/server -p 3001

`require': cannot load such file -- script/../config/boot (LoadError)
</code></pre></div>

<p>Sure, just some random load error. Turns out in Ruby 1.8 you could require a file with relative to current file path and now you can’t:</p>

<div><pre><code><span># In Ruby 1.8</span>
<span>require</span> <span>File</span><span>.</span><span>dirname</span><span>(</span><span>__FILE__</span><span>)</span> <span>+</span> <span>'/../config/boot'</span>

<span># In Ruby 1.9+</span>
<span>require_relative</span> <span>'../config/boot'</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>With this one fixed we can try it one more time:</p>

<div><pre><code>bundle exec ruby script/server -p 3001

=&gt; Booting WEBrick...

activerecord-1.13.2/lib/active_record/base.rb:708: circular argument reference - table_name (SyntaxError)
</code></pre></div>

<p>Ok this one should be trivial. The code in question:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>class_name</span><span>(</span><span>table_name</span> <span>=</span> <span>table_name</span><span>)</span>
  <span>...</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>I’m a bit surprised that this was working in Ruby 1.8. The error is pretty self-explanatory so I just renamed default argument value and continued with my life:</p>

<div><pre><code>bundle exec ruby script/server -p 3001

=&gt; Booting WEBrick...

`load': cannot load such file -- big_decimal.rb (LoadError)
Did you mean?  bigdecimal
</code></pre></div>

<p>Right, <code>bigdecimal</code> is not required by default now. I’ll spare you some time and say that there was the same issue
with <code>rexml</code> and <code>net-smtp</code> gems (<code>net-smtp</code> is not even part of Ruby anymore and I had to add it to the <code>Gemfile</code>). So I fixed it and tried again:</p>

<div><pre><code>bundle exec ruby script/server -p 3001

=&gt; Booting WEBrick...
actionmailer-1.1.5/lib/action_mailer/quoting.rb:22: invalid multibyte escape: /[\000-\011\013\014\016-\037\177-\377]/ (SyntaxError)
</code></pre></div>

<p>Oh yeah, Ruby 1.9 did a lot of changes to string encoding (you can read more on this <a href="http://graysoftinc.com/character-encodings/ruby-19s-string">here</a>) and now using raw bytes doesn’t work anymore. So I believe we can convert it to <code>/[\x00-\x11\x13\x14\x16-\x1F\x7F-\xFF]/n</code> and it’s going to work? Well, at least the issue was fixed (yeah, yeah who cares if we’ve just introduced some vulnerability? I don’t):</p>

<div><pre><code>bundle exec ruby script/server -p 3001

=&gt; Booting WEBrick...
`require': cannot load such file -- soap/rpc/driver (LoadError)
</code></pre></div>

<p>Oh ffs. It comes from <code>action_web_service</code> (god knows what was that back in the days) and lucky us we can remove this Rails component
from our stack with this config:</p>

<div><pre><code># Skip frameworks you're not going to use
config.frameworks -= [ :action_web_service ]
</code></pre></div>

<p><img src="https://github.com/nashby/nashby.github.io/assets/200500/1b81569a-5265-4e37-8d33-596c1c130f4b" alt="image"></p>

<div><pre><code>bundle exec ruby script/server -p 3001

`require': cannot load such file -- soap/rpc/driver (LoadError)

rails-1.0.0/lib/rails_info.rb:8: syntax error, unexpected ')' (SyntaxError)
        map {|(name, )| name}
</code></pre></div>

<p>Cool cool, you could do <code>.map { |(param1, )| param1 }</code> in Ruby 1.8 to ommit the second block param. You can actually do it in Ruby 3.3 but you don’t need this extra comma:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>{</span><span>a: </span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>b: </span><span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>c: </span><span>3</span><span>}.</span><span>map</span> <span>{</span> <span>|</span><span>a</span><span>,</span> <span>|</span> <span>a</span> <span>}</span> <span># =&gt; [:a, :b, :c]</span>
<span># or</span>
<span>{</span><span>a: </span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>b: </span><span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>c: </span><span>3</span><span>}.</span><span>map</span> <span>{</span> <span>|</span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>)</span><span>|</span> <span>a</span> <span>}</span> <span># =&gt; [:a, :b, :c]</span>
<span># without</span>
<span>{</span><span>a: </span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>b: </span><span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>c: </span><span>3</span><span>}.</span><span>map</span> <span>{</span> <span>|</span><span>a</span><span>|</span> <span>a</span> <span>}</span> <span># =&gt;[[:a, 1], [:b, 2], [:c, 3]]</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>And one more time…</p>

<div><pre><code>bundle exec ruby script/server -p 3001

=&gt; Booting WEBrick...

</code></pre></div>

<p>Oh my God, we did it!</p>

<p><img src="https://github.com/nashby/nashby.github.io/assets/200500/3710f177-d1ad-47df-9d0c-b80670bf427e" alt="Screenshot 2024-01-15 at 21 24 54"></p>

<p>If for some reason you want to check the code here it is: https://github.com/nashby/rails-from-the-past</p>

<p>I’m pretty sure there are way more issues to fix to make it work properly but I’m not going to do it.
I’m just happy enough that I’ve got to the point where I can see this greeting screen! Fin.</p>

<p>And may Ruby be with you!</p>

<p>I originally wrote this blog post in 2019 (or maybe 2018 - my timestamps say that it was written before 1 May 2019). Recently I decided to revisit my old blog and found that <code>std::clamp</code> still generates less efficient assembly than <code>std::min(max, std::max(min, v))</code> even on the latest versions of GCC (13.2) and Clang (17.0.1).</p>
<p>Here’s my old blog post:</p>

<li><a href="#using-stdclamp">Using std::clamp</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s say you want to clamp a value v between 2 values, min and max. If v is greater than max, return max. If v is smaller than min, return min. Otherwise return v.</p>
<h2 id="ternary">Ternary</h2>
<p>Implementing it directly as per the description:</p>
<pre><code><span>double</span> <span>clamp</span><span>(</span><span>double</span> v<span>,</span> <span>double</span> min<span>,</span> <span>double</span> max<span>)</span><span>{</span>
    <span>return</span> v <span>&lt;</span> min<span>?</span> min <span>:</span> v <span>&gt;</span> max<span>?</span> max <span>:</span> v<span>;</span>
<span>}</span>

<p>Identical output. Much better than before. Can we do better?</p>

<p>This is the idiomatic way to do clamp in C++ (and most other languages):</p>
<pre><code><span>#<span>include</span> <span>&lt;algorithm&gt;</span></span>
<span>double</span> <span>clamp</span><span>(</span><span>double</span> v<span>,</span> <span>double</span> min<span>,</span> <span>double</span> max<span>)</span><span>{</span>
    <span>return</span> std<span>::</span><span>min</span><span>(</span>max<span>,</span> std<span>::</span><span>max</span><span>(</span>min<span>,</span> v<span>)</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre>
<p>gcc 8.2:</p>
<pre><code>clamp(double, double, double):
        maxsd   xmm0, xmm1
        minsd   xmm0, xmm2
        ret
</code></pre>
<p>clang 7.0:</p>
<pre><code>clamp(double, double, double):                            # @clamp(double, double, double)
        maxsd   xmm0, xmm1
        minsd   xmm0, xmm2
        ret
</code></pre>
<p>Also seems to generate the best code.</p>

<p>Not very efficient.</p>
<p>EDIT: It’s been almost 5 years since I originally wrote this article, so I decided to try again using the latest versions of GCC and Clang:</p>
<p>gcc 13.2:</p>
<pre><code>clamp(double, double, double):
        maxsd   xmm1, xmm0
        minsd   xmm2, xmm1
        movapd  xmm0, xmm2
        ret
</code></pre>
<p>clang 17.0.1:</p>
<pre><code>clamp(double, double, double):                            # @clamp(double, double, double)
        maxsd   xmm1, xmm0
        minsd   xmm2, xmm1
        movapd  xmm0, xmm2
        ret
</code></pre>
<p>Still not the most efficient - it uses one more instruction than the <code>std::min(max, std::max(min, v))</code> implementation.</p>
<p>But how does the fastest implementation work you ask? Going through the code line by line:</p>
<pre><code>clamp(double, double, double):
        maxsd   xmm0, xmm1
        minsd   xmm0, xmm2
        ret
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>maxsd xmm0, xmm1</code> puts the max value of xmm0 and xmm1 into xmm0.</p>
<p>The <code>minsd xmm0, xmm2</code> puts the min value of xmm0 and xmm2 into xmm0.</p>
<p>Thus, after the first line, xmm0 contains the max of the lower bound and the value.</p>
<p>And after the second line, xmm0 contains the min of the upper bound and the previous result.</p>
<p>But let’s step through with gdb to confirm.</p>
<p>Source code:</p>
<pre><code><span>#<span>include</span> <span>&lt;algorithm&gt;</span></span>

<p>Pretty cool.</p>
<p>Anyway, I found it surprising that <code>std::clamp</code> still generates less efficient assembly than <code>std::min(max, std::max(min, v))</code> even on the latest versions of GCC (13.2) and Clang (17.0.1).</p>

      After a piece of software incorrectly showed that money had gone missing, a trusted, centuries-old British government corporation used its financial and legal might to convict and bankrupt hundreds of people who ran its branches. Some family members say their loved-ones were left so distressed they took their own lives.

      This could be the plot of a dystopian novel, but it describes the real-life ordeal that scores of the so-called sub-postmasters of the UK Post Office went through between 1999 and 2015. The government —&nbsp;which owns the Post Office — has described the scandal as one of the greatest miscarriages of justice in British history.

      Over two decades, livelihoods and reputations were destroyed, families shattered, and savings lost. Out of thousands of affected sub-postmasters who ran small businesses in communities across Britain, 700 were convicted of criminal offences. Some spent time in prison.

      Jo Hamilton was running a post office in a small village in southern England in 2003 when her Horizon computer started to show a shortfall of £2,000 ($2,500). When she ran the numbers again, she told CNN, that amount “doubled in front of (her) eyes.”

The British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak says the government will introduce a new law to &quot;swiftly exonerate and compensate victims&quot; of wrongful prosecution of Post Office workers over a 16-year period starting just before the new millennium. Between 1999 and 2015, more than 700 Post Office branch managers received criminal convictions, and some were sent to prison, when the faulty Horizon IT system made it appear that money was missing from their sites. To date, 93 of these convictions have been overturned, leaving many others still fighting their convictions or to receive compensation. A recent television docudrama has thrust the issue back in the spotlight.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://1a3orn.com/sub/machine-learning-bans.html">https://1a3orn.com/sub/machine-learning-bans.html</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39009779">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I've seen a few conversations where someone says something like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I've been using an open-source LLM lately -- I'm a huge fan of not depending on OpenAI, Anthropic, or Google. But I'm really sad that the AI safety groups are trying to ban the kind of open-source LLM that I'm using.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Someone then responds:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What! Almost no one <em>actually</em> wants to ban open source AI of the kind that you're using! That's just a recklessly-spread myth! AI Safety orgs just want to ban a tiny handful of future models -- no one has tried to pass laws that would have banned current open-sourced models!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This second claim is false.</p>
<p>Many AI "safety" organizations or people have in the past advocated bans that would have criminalized the open-sourcing of models <em>currently extant</em> as of now, January 2024. Even more organizations have pushed for bans that would cap open source AI capabilities at more or less exactly their current limits.</p>
<p>(I use open-sourcing broadly to refer to making weights generally available, not always to specific open-source compliant licensing.)</p>
<p>At least a handful of the organizations that have pushed for such bans are well-funded and becoming increasingly well-connected to policy makers.</p>
<p>Note that I think it's <em>entirely understandable</em> that someone would not realize such bans have been the goal of some AI safety orgs!</p>
<p>For comprehensible reasons -- i.e., how many people judge such policies to be a horrible idea, including many people interested in AI safety -- such AI safety organizations have often directed the documents explaining their proposed policies to bureaucrats, legislative staffers, and so on, and not been proactive in communicating their goals to the public.</p>
<p>Note also that <strong>not all</strong> AI safety organizations or AI-safety concerned people are trying to do this -- although, to be honest, a disturbing number are.</p>
<p>At least a handful of people in some organizations believe -- as do I -- that open source has been increasingly <a href="https://www.beren.io/2023-11-05-Open-source-AI-has-been-vital-for-alignment/">vital for AI safety work</a>. Given how <em>past</em> ban proposals would have been harmful, I think many future such proposals are therefore likely to be harmful as well, especially given that the arguments for them look pretty much identical.</p>
<p>Anyhow, a partial list:</p>
<h2><strong>1: Center for AI Safety</strong></h2>
<p>The Center for AI Safety is a well-funded (i.e., with &gt; <a href="https://www.openphilanthropy.org/grants/?organization-name=center-for-ai-safety">9 million USD</a>) 501c3 that focuses mostly on AI safety research and on outreach. You've probably heard of them because they gathered signatures for their <a href="https://www.safe.ai/statement-on-ai-risk">sentence</a> about AI safety.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, they are also involved in policy. In response to the National Telecommunications and Information Administration's (NTIA) request for comment they <a href="https://www.regulations.gov/comment/NTIA-2023-0005-1416">sent</a> proposed regulatory rules to them.</p>
<p>These rules propose defining "powerful AI systems" as any systems that meet or exceed certain measures for any of the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Computational resources used to train the system</strong> (e.g., 10^23 floating-point operations or “training FLOP”; this is approximately the amount of FLOP required to train GPT-3. Note that this threshold would be updated over time in order to account for algorithmic improvements.) [Note from 1a3orn; this means updated downwards]</p>
<p><strong>Large parameter count</strong> (e.g., 80B parameters)</p>
<p><strong>Benchmark performance</strong> (e.g., &gt; 70% performance on the Multi-task Language Understanding benchmark (MMLU))</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Systems meeting any of these requirements, according to the proposal, are subject to a number of requirements that would effectively ban open-sourcing them.</p>
<p>Llama 2 was trained with &gt; 10^23 FLOPs, and thus would have been banned beneath this rule. Fine-tunes of Llama 2 also obtain <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/159l9ll/llama270bguanacoqlora_becomes_the_first_model_on/">greater than 70%</a>on the MMLU and thus <em>also</em> would have been banned beneath this rule.</p>
<p>Note that -- despite how this would have prevented the release of Llama 2, and thus thousands of fine-tunes, and enormous quantities of <a href="https://www.beren.io/2023-11-05-Open-source-AI-has-been-vital-for-alignment/">safety research</a> -- the document boasts that its proposals "only regulate a small fraction of the overall AI development ecosystem."</p>
<h2><strong>2: Center for AI Policy</strong></h2>
<p>The Center for AI Policy -- different from the Center for AI Safety! -- is a DC-based lobbying organization. The announcement they <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/unwRBRQivd2LYRfuP/introducing-the-center-for-ai-policy-and-we-re-hiring">made</a> about their existence made some waves -- because the rules that they initially proposed would have required the <em>already-released</em> Llama-2 to be regulated by a new agency.</p>
<p>However, in a recent interview they <a href="https://www.thebayesianconspiracy.com/2023/12/202-the-center-for-ai-policy-talks-government-regulation/">say</a> that they're "trying to use the lightest touch we can -- we're trying to use a scalpel." Does this mean that they have changed their views?</p>
<p>Well, they haven't made any legislation they're proposing visible yet. But in the same interview they say that models trained with more than 3x10^24 FLOPs or getting &gt; 85 on the MMLU would be in their "high risk" category, which according to the interview explicitly means they would be banned from being open sourced.</p>
<p>This would have outlawed the <a href="https://huggingface.co/blog/falcon-180b">Falcon 180b</a> by its FLOP measure, although -- to be fair -- the Falcon 180b was open-sourced by an organization in the United Arab Emirates, so it's not certain that it would matter.</p>
<p>As far as the MMLU measure, no open source model at this level has <em>yet</em> been released, but GPT-4 scores ~90% on the MMLU. Thus, this amounts to a law attempting to permanently crimp open source models beneath GPT-4 levels, an event I otherwise think is reasonably likely in 2024.</p>
<p>(I do not understand why AI safety orgs think that MMLU scores are a good way to measure danger.)</p>
<h2><strong>3: Palisade Research</strong></h2>
<p>This non-profit, headed by Jeffrey Ladish, has as its stated goal to "create concrete demonstrations of dangerous capabilities to advise policy makers and the public on AI risks." That is, they try to make LLMs do dangerous or scary things so politicians will do particular things for them.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, Ladish himself literally <a href="https://twitter.com/JeffLadish/status/1654319741501333504">called for government to stop the release of Llama 2, saying "we can prevent the release of a LLaMA 2! We need government action on this asap."</a></p>
<p>(He also said that he thought it would potentially cause millions of dollars of damage, and was <a href="https://twitter.com/JeffLadish/status/1666653302355009537">more likely</a> to cause <strong>more</strong> than a billion dollars of damage than to cause less than a million.)</p>
<h2><strong>4. The Future Society</strong></h2>
<p><a href="https://thefuturesociety.org/">The Future Society</a> is a think tank whose <a href="https://thefuturesociety.org/about-us/">goal</a> is to "align artificial intelligence through better governance." They boast 60 partners such as UNESCO and the Future of Life Institute, and claim to have spoke to over 8,000 "senior decision makers" and taught 4,000 students. They aim to provide guidance to both the EU and the US.</p>
<p>In one of their premier policy documents, <a href="https://thefuturesociety.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/heavy-is-the-head-that-wears-the-crown.pdf">"Heavy is the head that wears the crown"</a>, they define "Type 2" General Purpose AI (GPAI) as a kind trained with &gt; 10^23 FLOPs (but less than 10^26) or scoring &gt; 68% (but less than 88%) on the MMLU. Llama-2, again, falls into this category on both counts.</p>
<p>The document mandates that anyone creating a Type 2 GPAI must -- well, must do many things -- but must provide for "Absolute Trustworthiness," which seems to mean that the model must be incapable of doing anything bad whatsoever, and more to the point means that the provider of the model must be able to "retract already deployed models (roll-back &amp; shutdowns)." Open source models would be unable to meet this requirement, obviously.</p>
<p>Similarly, they say that providers would be "required to <strong>continuously monitor the model’s capabilities and behaviour</strong>, detecting any anomalies and escalating cases of concern to relevant decision makers," which is again impossible to do with an open source model.</p>
<p>Note that in accord with their policy recommendations, this group specifically calls out Meta's actions, dubbing the open-sourcing of Llama a "particularly egregious case of misuse." They also seem to believe that Apache licensing is unacceptable, explicitly calling the "no guarantee of fitness of purpose" clause in such a license "abusive."</p>
<p>Don't worry, though! The Future Society says that they <a href="https://thefuturesociety.org/about-us/">believe</a> that "legitimate and sustainable governance requires bringing to the table many different perspectives."</p>
<p>(My guess is that this is one of the major teams responsible trying to get the EU's rules to ban open source AI, but the institutional process by which the EU works is completely opaque to me and so I am only left guessing.)</p>
<hr>
<p>Note that the above is just a partial list of organizations or people who have made their policies or goals extremely explicit.</p>
<p>There are other organizations or people out there whose policies are less legible, but ultimately are equally opposed to open sourcing. Consider, for instance, <a href="https://www.safer-ai.org/">SaferAI</a> , whose CEO says he's fine <a href="https://x.com/Simeon_Cps/status/1710062142559285560?s=20">"with developing and deploying open source up to somewhere around Llama-1"</a>; or the <a href="https://pauseai.info/proposal">PauseAI</a> people, who think we should need approvals for training runs <a href="https://pauseai.info/proposal">"above a certain size (e.g. 1 billion parameters)"</a> and who accused <a href="https://metaprotest.org/">Meta of reckless irresponsibility</a> for releasing Llama-2.</p>
<p>Or there is the extremely questionable <a href="https://www.stop.ai/proposals">StopAI</a> group advised by Conjecture, which wishes to eliminate not merely all open source but all AI trained with &gt; 10^23 FLOPs.</p>
<p>Or there are surprisingly numerous people who want to completely change liability law, so that you cannot open-source a model without becoming liable for damage that it causes.</p>
<p>These and similar statements from them either outright imply or would be <em>hard to separate</em> from policies that would have effectively banned currently-extant open-source.</p>
<p>So, again -- it's <strong>just false</strong> to say that if AI safety groups haven't tried to ban models that already exist. They <em>already</em> would have banned models that are actively being used, if they had had their way in the past. They would have substantially contributed to a corporate monopoly on LLMs.</p>
<p>If you are like me, and think the proposed policies mentioned above are pretty bad -- the stupidity of a law in no way prevents it from being passed! The above groups have not dissolved in the last 6 months. They still hope to pass something like these measures. They are still operating on the same questionable epistemology.</p>
<p>The open-source AI movement is in general is <em>far behind</em> these groups and needs to get its legislative act together if the better organized "anti-open source" movement is not to obliterate it.</p>
<p>And I think it is better to call it the "anti-open source" movement than the AI safety movement.</p>
<p>The "environmentalist" movement helped get nuclear power plants effectively banned, thereby crippling a safe and low-carbon source of energy, causing immense harm to the environment and to humanity by doing so. They thought they were helping the environment. They were not.</p>
<p>I think that some sectors of the "AI safety" movement are likely on their way to doing a similar thing, by preventing human use of, and research into, an easily-steerable and deeply non-rebellious form of intelligence.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="main"><p>I always liked <a href="https://3.14.by/en/read/toshiba-libretto-50ct">small laptops</a> and phones - but for some reason they fell out of favor of manufacturers ("bigger is more better"). Now if one wanted to get tiny laptop - one of the few opportunities would have been to fight for old Sony UMPC's on ebay which are somewhat expensive even today. Recently Raspberry Pi/CM4-based tiny laptops started to appear - especially <a href="https://www.clockworkpi.com/home-devterm">clockwork</a> products are neat, but they are not foldable like a laptop. When in summer of 2023 Sipeed announced <a href="https://sipeed.com/licheepi4a">Lichee Console 4A</a> based on RISC-V SoC - I preordered it immediately and in early January I finally received it. Results of my testing, currently uncovered issues are below.<br><img src="https://s.14.by/lv0.jpg"></p><h2>Brief specs and internals</h2><p>
First of all, Lichee Console is tiny, 185 x 140 x 19 mm, 656g. Build is solid and high-quality, using mostly aluminum.  Keyboard has typical laptop key travel and to my feel comparable to Lenovo's but it is of course quite a bit smaller. I cannot type on it blindly (yet), but it is possible. The only inconvenient part of keyboard (in context of Linux) is compressed keys [,][.][/], which are often used in console. Trackpoint mouse is ok for someone who had it all these years on Lenovo laptops. </p><p>Lichee Console 4A runs on T-Head (Alibaba) TH1520 quad-core RISC-V SoC (4x <a href="https://img.102.alibaba.com/1627958419409/49652c9412c41cb6f39b36fed1244e6e.pdf">C910</a> cores). While TH1520 can clock up to 2.0/2.5Ghz, in Lichee Console it is tamed down to 1.5Ghz max, likely to help with thermal dissipation. Maximum configuration is quite serious for such tiny thing: maximum of 16Gb DDR4 RAM (I got this version) and maximum of 128Gb eMMC. There is a slot for 42mm SATA M.2 SSD, but it connected via ASM1153 USB3.0-&gt;SATA adapter. More on that later. </p><p>I would prefer working on M.2 SSD as you can keep the data if something else fails (eMMC is soldered on the board and will be expensive to recover). 42mm SATA SSD's are not very popular, and the best I was able to find was Transcend MTS400 256Gb (it is still in transit). There are many such SSD's from Chinese brands though. </p><p>Display has resolution of 1280x800 and looks to be IPS. No color shift at high angles. There is a webcam on the left side of the monitor - it is average quality full HD 30p (requires good lighting), landscape orientation. It is possible to connect external display via mini-HDMI (cable included). It worked fine on FullHD monitor, but unstable/non-working on 4k. </p><p>Battery is 2S 3000mAh. Charging can be done through USB-C (maximum 5V 2.2A, does not trigger 9/12V) or via 12V jack (which I personally will not use). 12V power brick came with Chinese/US plug, so if you want to use it - you will need an adapter. Jack external diameter is 3.45mm (central positive), if you would want to find a 12V PD trigger adapter for it (something <a href="https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005006065089042.html">like this</a> but double check voltage). More on battery life below.</p><p>On the software side - Debian 12 with Xfce is preinstalled, built for 64-bit RISC-V. WiFi or Ethernet connection was straightforward, and Chrome-based browser was able to play YouTube video with no issues. apt update fetches packages from Chinese server. </p><p>Unboxing video below (no comments):</p><iframe width="1000" height="592" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/w8xCDL67qUU" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
<p><b>Build quality</b>:<br>
There was only 1 build quality issue on my sample: apparently aluminum bottom part of case was squeezing keyboard, or something was pressing and bending keyboard outwards slightly (~1mm), which was catching screen bottom when opening and making unhealthy snapping sound. After reassembly &amp; pressing on keyboard in the middle - the issue was resolved. </p><p>Disassembly/assembly is relatively complicated due to tight fit of aluminum bottom cover, and I do not recommend to disassemble the unit unless absolutely necessary.</p><p>I do not like metal clips holding lithium battery in place. After enough vibration and abuse, some swelling on the battery it is not unthinkable that they might bite into the battery and destroy the unit. Even if 0.1% of units will burn down due to this potential issue - this will be very sad. Plastic bracket for the battery or glue in place (unliked by many and hard to service) are well tested by the industry and safe. What makes it hard to do well is flex cables under the battery. On my unit I added kapton tape under and over the metal bracket to ensure it does not wiggle over the battery and has a harder time biting into the battery.<br><img src="https://s.14.by/lv1.jpg"></p><p>Unlike most laptops, Lichee Console uses 2 PCB's in addition to SOC module, and this will bite us later. IO board has microsd card slot, USB and analog audio. <br><img src="https://s.14.by/lv2.jpg"></p><p>SoC module is removable. Heat is transferred via silicon pad to a heatpipe glued to aluminum back cover. <br><img src="https://s.14.by/lv3.jpg"></p><h2>Benchmarks &amp; tests</h2>
<p><b>CPU &amp; Power</b></p><table><tbody><tr><td></td><td>TH1520 @1.5Ghz</td><td>Raspberry Pi 4</td><td>Raspberry Pi 5</td></tr>
<tr><td>idle power</td><td>7.68 / 6W (with/without screen)</td><td>1.93W</td><td>2.42W</td></tr>
<tr><td>CoreMark 1 core</td><td>6900</td><td>7938</td><td>17725</td></tr>
<tr><td>Power 1 core</td><td>8.376W (with screen)</td><td>2.70W</td><td>4.47W</td></tr>
<tr><td>CoreMark 4 cores</td><td>25689</td><td>31532</td><td>69860</td></tr>
<tr><td>Power 4 cores</td><td>9.408W (with screen)</td><td>4.85W</td><td>7.35W</td></tr></tbody></table><p>
Here performance is slightly behind Raspberry Pi 4 due to clock speed being reduced from 2.0 to 1.5Ghz. Personally I find performance of Raspberry Pi 4 perfectly acceptable for console work, and I am satisfied with performance of TH1520 for my use. I have included Raspberry Pi 5 for comparison as it's already 2024, and later this year we'll (hopefully) see competing products using CM5. </p><p>What I don't like though is high static power consumption of Lichee Console. At idle system goes down to 300Mhz, and even with 3 cores manually parked - it still consumes ~6W (without screen). This static power consumption makes Lichee Console quite warm even at idle. Also, this gives us just ~2.5 hours of battery life without any heavy load. As USB charging is limited to 5V/2.2A - Lichee Console will charge extremely slowly when powered on (~3 hours to full charge when switched off and ~10 hours when switched on). Surely, 12V 3.45mm barrel charging is much faster. </p><p>Dynamic power consumption of C910 cores are rated at 200µW/MHz/core, which gives us 300mW dynamic power consumption for 1 core at 1.5Ghz, and 1.2W for 4 core load. Measurements confirm these numbers, so the only issue is high static power consumption. On ratio performance / dynamic power it is perfectly competitive to Raspberry Pi 4, it is only static part that hurts it. </p><p>To investigate high static power consumption I made thermal photo at idle:<br><img src="https://s.14.by/lv4.jpg"></p><p>Here we see that approximately half of power is dissipated by Via VL817 - USB 3.0 hub IC located right under SoC module. Less but still significant power is dissipated by ASM1153 USB-&gt;SATA adapter, despite no SATA drives connected. This is quite disappointing. If no software fix would be found to disable unused interfaces, I am personally considering de-soldering these IC's or disconnecting them from power. 5-6 vs 2.8 hours of battery life is more important for my use. </p><p>This high idle power consumption is probably why cooling fan is always on (thankfully it is quiet), even when I put Lichee Console inside the fridge :-)</p><p><b>WiFi &amp; Ethernet</b>
WiFi module is connected via SDIO. Practical speed via iperf3 is 122/115 Mbit/sec. "Not great, not terrible" - but good enough for regular use.<br>Wired Ethernet does 925/925 Mbit/sec without jumbo packets which is nearly as good as it gets. SoC has 2 Ethernet ports, only 1 is accessible on Lichee Console.</p><p><b>Disk performance</b><br>
<b>eMMC</b><br>
Random 4k: Writes 8102 IOPS, 31.6MiB/s. Reads 2502 IOPS, 9.77MiB/s<br>
Random 1Mb: Writes 202mb/s, Reads 130mb/s</p><p>Random access is slower than modern fast microsd cards, but sequential is acceptable (for eMMC).</p><p><b>MicroSD</b>:<br>
Testing fast MicroSD cards (Samsung Pro Ultimate, Sandisk Extreme Pro) which can negotiate fastest possible speed (up to 200Mb/s) - uncovered that they are <b>unstable</b> and operations fail with io errors. This is likely caused by extremely long signal path : from SoC, then to flex connector, then folded flex cable, then path across IO board. Old/slow MicroSD cards work reliably but at snail speed. Hopefully maximum interface speed for MicroSD can be reduced in software without affecting eMMC speed. </p><p><b>Currently missing/broken features (mostly software)</b>:<br>1) Bluetooth was failing to pair devices out of the box using GUI tools. <br>2) No sleep function. You have to switch off / boot up every time you open Lichee Console.<br>3) Not sure if there is sensor detecting closed screen. Right now when closed it just continues working with the screen on. <br>4) Adjustment of screen brightness does not work (it is always at max brightness, or off).<br>5) Suboptimal power management leading to high static power consumption: Is it possible to disable VL817/ASM1153? Is SoC supply voltage scaling correctly at idle?</p><p>I will update the article here as software is improved. </p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>
My overall experience with Lichee Console is positive and I like it. It should be noted that at the moment it is more of a product for tinkering and not something that you can immediately use as-is for work with no changes. Substantial improvement will be required on software to fully utilize hardware capabilities (but this often happens with Linux on mobile platforms). Hardware has some flaws, they are unpleasant but not fatal (microsd stability at high speed, high idle power consumption). I am concerned about battery safety, and hopefully this is something that Sipeed can improve. </p><p>12nm TH1520 SoC offer competetive dynamic power consumption and sufficient performance, but lacks in IO (for desktop) which forced Sipeed to add additional interface ICs which happened to consume too much static power. </p><p>I hope that current rapid pace of RISC-V infrastructure development will continue and in the nearest years we'll see more RISC-V SoC's, this time with at least few lines of PCI-E - and we'll get even more exciting Linux-capable RISC-V devices.

Looking forwared to test it.</p><p>PS.
