				<h3>from the <i>found-the-campus-free-speech-crisis</i> dept</h3>
				


				<p>For years, we’ve been hearing breathless warnings about a “campus free speech crisis” from self-proclaimed free speech warriors. Their evidence? College students doing what college students have done for generations: protesting speakers they disagree with, challenging institutional policies, and yes, sometimes attempting to create heckler’s vetoes.</p>
<p>This kind of campus activism — while occasionally messy and uncomfortable — has been a feature of American higher education since the 1960s. It’s how young people learn to engage with ideas and exercise their own speech rights. Sometimes that activism is silly and sometimes it’s righteous. Often it’s somewhere in between, but it’s kind of a part of being a college student, and learning what you believe in.</p>
<p>But now we face an <em>actual</em> free speech crisis on campus that goes beyond just speech. It’s an attack on personal freedoms, due process, and liberty. The federal government isn’t just pressuring universities over speech — it’s <strong>literally disappearing students for their political expression</strong>. If you support actual free speech, now is the time to speak up.</p>
<p>The latest example of this authoritarian overreach is particularly chilling: Rumeysa Ozturk, a Turkish PhD student at Tufts who was here legally on a student visa, <a href="https://www.wgbh.org/news/local/2025-03-26/tufts-international-graduate-student-taken-into-ice-custody">was abducted by masked agents</a> in broad daylight. She was disappeared without due process or explanation — only later did we learn she had been renditioned to a detention center in Louisiana.</p>
<p>The video of her kidnapping (because that’s what it was) is terrifying enough:</p>
<p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/YGDVKBdq3Gw?si=GwMrd-S7oC94zfDS" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>If you listen, you hear her quite understandably surprised reaction with a scream, and then she asks to call the police, only to be told “we’re the police.” None of them are in uniforms. Most of them are masked.</p>
<p>Her supposed crime? A year ago, she co-authored an op-ed in The Tufts Daily <a href="https://www.tuftsdaily.com/article/2024/03/4ftk27sm6jkj">criticizing her university administration’s stance</a> on the Israel-Palestine conflict. Not advocating violence. Not supporting terrorism. Not even criticizing the U.S. government. Just exercising core First Amendment rights by publishing criticism of her own university’s policies in a student newspaper.</p>
<p>The government has attempted to justify similar renditions (and there is a growing list of victims) by falsely painting targets as “terrorist supporters” — a dangerous conflation of political speech supporting Palestinian rights with support for terrorism. But even those cases typically involved people involved in public protests, which are themselves constitutionally protected activities. This case goes even further: disappearing someone over an innocuous piece of student journalism published a year ago.</p>
<p>Everyone should be alarmed. <em>Everyone</em> should be demanding that she (and others) be released and that ICE and DHS stop this horrifying and unconscionable practice. <em>Everyone</em> should be demanding that Trump and Marco Rubio and Kristi Noem stop this Gestapo bullshit.</p>
<p>Even if — <em>especially</em> if — you disagree with her views on Israel and Palestine. This isn’t about that. This is about the very concept of freedom. The rights everyone — even visitors — are supposed to have in this country. The right to speak your mind, even if (especially if!) it is opposed to those in power. The right to walk down a street without being kidnapped. The right to due process.</p>
<p>If the government genuinely believed Ozturk had violated immigration law or her visa terms (she hadn’t), there are established legal procedures to address such issues. Instead, they chose to send masked goons to disappear her without warning or due process — a chilling message to every other international student that their supposed right to express political opinions comes with the risk of rendition.</p>
<p>And, of course, the implied threat is that this won’t stop at international students.</p>
<p>But the Trump administration believes not in fundamental rights. It only believes in the cowardly authoritarian displays of theatrical power. Because they are weak and insecure. They are so frightened by a random college student op-ed or a protest, they are taking to disappearing people with no due process for their speech.</p>
<p>This won’t stop unless everyone speaks up and demands that the government respect the rights of everyone. These are bullying and intimidation tactics of weak insecure bullies, who know they cannot win in the marketplace of ideas. They are scared and pathetic, knowing that their beliefs are bad, and that the public doesn’t support them. Thus, their only response is an impotent rage, an attempt to replace respect and fair treatment with authoritarian tactics in hopes of intimidating people into silence and capitulation.</p>
<p>These are scary times, but people need to stop cowering. They need to speak up. They need to show up. They need to say that this is not the America any of us were taught to believe in. This is not the America of freedom and rights.</p>
<p>This is a desecration of the high (and often unmet) ideals of what America is supposed to be striving for. This is spitting on the fundamental concepts of the American project.</p>
<p>And where are all those self-proclaimed defenders of campus free speech now? The same voices who treated student protesters as an existential threat to academic freedom are conspicuously silent as government agents literally kidnap students for their political expression. Their silence exposes their previous concerns as purely performative.</p>
<p>This isn’t just about free speech anymore — it’s about whether we’ll allow the government to normalize disappearing people for their political views. Everyone who claims to care about constitutional rights and academic freedom needs to speak up now. Because those who remain silent in the face of such clear authoritarian overreach are complicit.</p>

<h3>Raph Levien, March 29, 2025</h3>
<p>Seven years ago I wrote a blog post <a href="https://raphlinus.github.io/rust/simd/2018/10/19/fearless-simd.html">Towards fearless SIMD</a>, outlining a vision for Rust as a compelling language for writing fast SIMD programs.
Where are we now?</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the present-day experience of writing SIMD in Rust is still pretty rough, though there has been progress, and there are promising efforts underway.
As in the previous post, this post will outline a possible vision.</p>
<p>Up to now, Linebender projects have not used SIMD, but that is changing.
As we work on CPU/GPU hybrid rendering techniques, it's clear that we need SIMD to get maximal performance of the CPU side.
We also see opportunities in faster color conversion and accelerated 2D geometry primitives.</p>
<p>This blog post is also a companion to a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0WcCUKxk50">podcast</a> I recorded recently with André Popovitch.
That podcast is a good introduction to SIMD concepts, while this blog post focuses more on future directions.</p>
<h2 id="a-simple-example">A simple example</h2>
<p>As a running example, we'll compute a <a href="https://raphlinus.github.io/audio/2018/09/05/sigmoid.html">sigmoid</a> function for a vector of 4 values.
The scalar version is as follows:</p>
<pre data-lang="rust"><code data-lang="rust"><span>fn </span><span>sigmoid</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>: [</span><span>f32</span><span>; 4]) -&gt; [</span><span>f32</span><span>; </span><span>4</span><span>] {
</span><span>    x.</span><span>map</span><span>(|</span><span>y</span><span>| y / (</span><span>1.0 </span><span>+ y * y).</span><span>sqrt</span><span>())
</span><span>}
</span></code></pre>
<p>This particular simple code autovectorizes nicely (<a href="https://rust.godbolt.org/z/TfThE5r33">Godbolt link</a>), but more complex examples often fail to autovectorize, often because of subtle differences in floating point semantics.
(Editorial note: a previous version of this post didn't autovectorize (<a href="https://rust.godbolt.org/z/GoTEK3KT3">Godbolt</a>) because optimization level was set at <code>-O</code>, which is less aggressive than <code>-C opt-level=3</code>, the latter of which is the default for release builds)</p>
<h2 id="safety">Safety</h2>
<p>One of the biggest problems with writing SIMD in Rust is that all exposed SIMD intrinsics are marked as <code>unsafe</code>, even in cases where they can be used safely.
The reason is that support for SIMD features varies widely, and executing a SIMD instruction on a CPU that does not support it is undefined behavior – the chip can crash, ignore the instruction, or do something unexpected.
To be used safely, there must be some other mechanism to establish that the CPU does support the feature.</p>
<p>Here's the running example in hand-written intrinsic code, showing the need to write <code>unsafe</code> to access SIMD intrinsics at all:</p>
<pre data-lang="rust"><code data-lang="rust"><span>#[</span><span>cfg</span><span>(target_arch = "</span><span>aarch64</span><span>")]
</span><span>fn </span><span>sigmoid_neon</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>: [</span><span>f32</span><span>; 4]) -&gt; [</span><span>f32</span><span>; </span><span>4</span><span>] {
</span><span>    </span><span>use </span><span>core::arch::aarch64::*;
</span><span>    </span><span>unsafe </span><span>{
</span><span>        </span><span>let</span><span> x_simd = core::mem::transmute(x);
</span><span>        </span><span>let</span><span> x_squared = </span><span>vmulq_f32</span><span>(x_simd, x_simd);
</span><span>        </span><span>let</span><span> ones = </span><span>vdupq_n_f32</span><span>(</span><span>1.0</span><span>);
</span><span>        </span><span>let</span><span> sum = </span><span>vaddq_f32</span><span>(ones, x_squared);
</span><span>        </span><span>let</span><span> sqrt = </span><span>vsqrtq_f32</span><span>(sum);
</span><span>        </span><span>let</span><span> ratio = </span><span>vdivq_f32</span><span>(x_simd, sqrt);
</span><span>        core::mem::transmute(ratio)
</span><span>    }
</span><span>}
</span><span>
</span><span>#[</span><span>cfg</span><span>(target_arch = "</span><span>x86_64</span><span>")]
</span><span>fn </span><span>sigmoid_sse2</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>: [</span><span>f32</span><span>; 4]) -&gt; [</span><span>f32</span><span>; </span><span>4</span><span>] {
</span><span>    </span><span>use </span><span>core::arch::x86_64::*;
</span><span>    </span><span>unsafe </span><span>{
</span><span>        </span><span>let</span><span> x_simd = core::mem::transmute(x);
</span><span>        </span><span>let</span><span> x_squared = </span><span>_mm_mul_ps</span><span>(x_simd, x_simd);
</span><span>        </span><span>let</span><span> ones = </span><span>_mm_set1_ps</span><span>(</span><span>1.0</span><span>);
</span><span>        </span><span>let</span><span> sum = </span><span>_mm_add_ps</span><span>(ones, x_squared);
</span><span>        </span><span>let</span><span> sqrt = </span><span>_mm_sqrt_ps</span><span>(sum);
</span><span>        </span><span>let</span><span> ratio = </span><span>_mm_div_ps</span><span>(x_simd, sqrt);
</span><span>        core::mem::transmute(ratio)
</span><span>    }
</span><span>}
</span></code></pre>
<p>This is quite a simplified example.
For one, the SIMD width is fixed at 4 lanes (128 bits).
Most likely, in practice you'd iterate over a larger slice, taking chunks equal to the natural SIMD width.</p>
<h2 id="multiversioning">Multiversioning</h2>
<p>A central problem important for SIMD is multiversioning and runtime dispatch.
In some cases, you know the exact CPU target, for example when compiling a binary you'll run only on your machine (in which case <code>target-cpu=native</code> is appropriate).
But when distributing software more widely, there may be a range of capabilities.
For highest performance, it's necessary to compile multiple versions of the code, and do runtime detection to dispatch to the best SIMD code the hardware can run.
This problem was expressed in the original fearless SIMD blog post, and there hasn't been significant advance at the Rust language level since then.</p>
<p>In the C++ world, the <a href="https://github.com/google/highway">Highway</a> library provides excellent SIMD support for a very wide range of targets, and also solves the multiversioning problem.
Among other uses are the codecs for the JPEG-XL image format.
Such codecs are an ideal use case for SIMD programming in general, and shipping them in a browser requires a good solution to multiversioning.
Highway has a really good explanation of <a href="https://github.com/kfjahnke/zimt/blob/multi_isa/examples/multi_isa_example/multi_simd_isa.md">their approach to multiversioning</a>.
It will be useful to study it carefully to see how they've solved various problems.
And a concise way of saying what I'd like to see is "Highway for Rust."</p>
<p>One possible approach is a crate called <a href="https://docs.rs/multiversion/latest/multiversion/">multiversion</a>, which uses macros to replicate the code for multiple versions.
A more recent macro-based approach is <a href="https://github.com/a4lg/rust-target-feature-dispatch">rust-target-feature-dispatch</a>.
It is generally a similar approach to multiversion, and the specific differences are set out in that crate's <a href="https://github.com/a4lg/rust-target-feature-dispatch/blob/main/src/README.md">README</a>.</p>
<p>Another approach, as I believe first advocated in my 2018 blog post, is to write functions polymorphic on a zero-sized type representing the SIMD capabilities, then rely on monomorphization to create the various versions.
One motivation for this approach is to encode safety in Rust's type system.
Having the zero-sized token is proof of the underlying CPU having a certain level of SIMD capability, so calling those intrinsics is safe.
A major library that uses this approach is <a href="https://docs.rs/pulp/latest/pulp/">pulp</a>, which also powers the <a href="https://docs.rs/faer/latest/faer/">faer</a> linear algebra library.</p>
<p>I started putting together a pulp version of the running example, but ran into the immediate problem that it lacks a <code>sqrt</code> intrinsic (this would be easy enough to add, however).
It also works a bit differently, in that it only supports vectors of the natural width, not ones of a fixed width.
For general linear algebra, that's fine, but for some other applications it adds friction, for example colors with alpha are naturally chunks of 4 scalars.
To see an example of pulp code, as well as some discussion, see this <a href="https://xi.zulipchat.com/#narrow/channel/255911-rust/topic/Rust.20SIMD.20thoughts/near/489370476">Zulip thread</a>.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://github.com/raphlinus/fearless_simd/pull/2">fearless_simd#2</a> I propose a prototype of reasonably-ergonomic SIMD multiversioning.
Like the original fearless_simd prototype, vector data types are polymorphic on SIMD level.
The new prototype goes beyond that in several important ways.
For one, arithmetic traits in std::ops are implemented for vector types, so it's possible to add two vectors together, multiply vectors by scalars, etc.</p>
<p>Here's what the running example looks like in that prototype:</p>
<pre data-lang="rust"><code data-lang="rust"><span>#[</span><span>inline</span><span>(always)]
</span><span>fn </span><span>sigmoid_impl</span><span>&lt;S: Simd&gt;(</span><span>simd</span><span>: S, </span><span>x</span><span>: [</span><span>f32</span><span>; 4]) -&gt; [</span><span>f32</span><span>; </span><span>4</span><span>] {
</span><span>    </span><span>let</span><span> x_simd: f32x4&lt;S&gt; = x.</span><span>simd_into</span><span>(simd);
</span><span>    (x_simd / (</span><span>1.0 </span><span>+ x_simd * x_simd).</span><span>sqrt</span><span>()).</span><span>into</span><span>()
</span><span>}
</span><span>
</span><span>simd_dispatch!(</span><span>sigmoid</span><span>(level, rgba: [</span><span>f32</span><span>; </span><span>4</span><span>]) -&gt; [</span><span>f32</span><span>; </span><span>4</span><span>] = sigmoid_impl);
</span></code></pre>
<p>An advantage of the fearless_simd#2 prototype over pulp is a feature for downcasting based on SIMD level, so it's possible to write different code optimized for different chips.
See the <a href="https://github.com/raphlinus/fearless_simd/pull/2/files#diff-be8aece917a9235076ff8ec42749b1f1a803d2a3cbc2ccdd5425b405c74f7436">srgb example</a> in that pull request for more detail.
Though there are clear advantages, at this point I'm not sure whether this is the direction to go.
It would be a lot of work to build out all the needed types and operations, with potentially a large amount of repetitive boilerplate code in the library, which in turn may cause issues with compile time.
Another possible direction is a smarter, compiler-like proc macro which synthesizes the SIMD intrinsics as needed based on the types and operations in the source program.</p>
<p>One additional consideration for Rust is that the implementation of runtime feature detection is <a href="https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/better-codegen-for-cpu-feature-detection/22083">slower than it should be</a>.
Thus, feature detection and dispatch shouldn't be done at every function call.
A good working solution is to do feature detection once, at the start of the program, then pass that token down through function calls.
It's workable but definitely an ergonomic paper cut.</p>
<h2 id="fp16-and-avx-512">FP16 and AVX-512</h2>
<p>A general trend in parallel computation, really fueled by AI workloads, is smaller scalars with higher throughputs.
While not yet common on x86_64, the FP16 extension is supported on all Apple Silicon desktop CPUs and most recent high-ish end ARM-based phones.
Since Neon is only 128 bits wide, having 8 lanes is welcome.
I find the f16 format to be especially useful for pixel values, as it can encode color values with more than enough precision to avoid visual artifacts (8 bits is not quite enough, though it is good enough for some applications, as long as you're not trying to do HDR).</p>
<p>Native Rust support for the <code>f16</code> type has not yet landed (tracked in <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/125440">rust#125440</a>), which makes use of this scalar size harder.
However, there is some support in the <a href="https://docs.rs/half/latest/half/">half</a> library, and also the <a href="https://github.com/raphlinus/fearless_simd/pull/2">fearless_simd#2</a> prototype exports a number of FP16 Neon instructions through inline assembly.
When true f16 support lands, it will be possible to switch over to intrinsics, which will have better optimization and ergonomics (for example, the same method will splat constants converted to <code>f16</code> at compile time and <code>f32</code> variables to be converted at runtime).</p>
<p>AVX-512 is a somewhat controversial SIMD capability.
It first appeared in the ill-fated Larrabee project, which shipped in limited numbers as the Xeon Phi starting in 2010, and has since appeared in scattered Intel CPUs, but with compromises.
In particular, sprinkling even a small amount of AVX-512 code into a program could result in downclocking, reducing performance for all workloads (see <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/56852812/simd-instructions-lowering-cpu-frequency#comment100256395_56852812">Stack Overflow thread on throttling</a> for more details).
These days, the most likely way to get a CPU with AVX-512 is an AMD Zen 4 or Zen 5; it is on their strength that AVX-512 makes up about 16% of computers in the Steam hardware survey.</p>
<p>The increased width is not the main reason to be enthusiastic about AVX-512.
Indeed, on Zen 4 and most Zen 5 chips, the datapath is 256 bits so full 512 bit instructions are "double pumped." The most exciting aspect is predication based on masks, a common implementation technique on GPUs.
In particular, memory load and store operations are safe when the mask bit is zero, which is especially helpful for using SIMD efficiently on strings.
Without predication, a common technique is to write two loops, the first handling only even multiples of the SIMD width, and a second, usually written as scalars, to handle the odd-size "tail".
There are lots of problems with this - code bloat, worse branch prediction, inability to exploit SIMD for chunks slightly less than the natural SIMD width (which gets worse as SIMD grows wider), and risks that the two loops don't have exactly the same behavior.</p>
<p>Going forward, Intel has proposed AVX10, and will hopefully ship AVX 10.2 chips in the next few years.
This extension has pretty much all of the features of AVX-512, with some cleanups and new features (until recently, AVX10 was defined has having a 256 bit base width and optionally 512, but 512 is now the baseline).
In addition, AVX10.2 will include 16-bit floats (currently available only in the Sapphire Rapids high-end server and workstation chips).</p>
<h2 id="about-std-simd">About std::simd</h2>
<p>The "portable SIMD" work has been going on for many years and currently has a home as the nightly <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/simd/index.html">std::simd</a>.
While I think it will be very useful in many applications, I am not personally very excited about it for my applications.
For one, because it emphasizes portability, it encourages a "lowest common denominator" approach, while I believe that for certain use cases it will be important to tune algorithms to best use the specific quirks of the different SIMD implementations.
For two, std::simd does not itself solve the multiversion problem.
From my perspective, it's probably best to consider it as a souped-up version of autovectorization.</p>
<h2 id="language-evolution">Language evolution</h2>
<p>Rust's out of the box support for SIMD is still quite rough, especially the need to use <code>unsafe</code> extensively.
While some of the gap can be filled with libraries, arguably it should be a goal of the language itself to support safe SIMD code.
There is progress in this direction.</p>
<p>First, the original version of <code>target_feature</code> requires <code>unsafe</code> to call into <em>any</em> function annotated with <code>#[target_feature]</code>.
A proposal to relax that so that functions already under a target_feature gate can call safely call into another function with the same gate is called "<a href="https://rust-lang.github.io/rfcs/2396-target-feature-1.1.html">target_feature 1.1</a>" and is scheduled to ship in 1.86.
Closely related, once inside the suitable target_feature gate, the majority of SIMD intrinsics (broadly, those that don't do memory access through pointers) should be considered safe by the compiler, and that feature (safe intrinsics in core::arch) is also in flight.</p>
<p>There's more that can be done to help the Rust compiler recognize when SIMD use is safe, in particular to allow target_features when a concrete witness to the SIMD level is passed in as a function argument.
The "struct target_features" proposal (<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/3525">RFC 3525</a>) enables target_feature in such cases, and is one of the proposals considered in the proposed Rust project goal <a href="https://rust-lang.github.io/rust-project-goals/2025h1/simd-multiversioning.html">Nightly support for ergonomic SIMD multiversioning</a>.</p>
<p>In general, improving Rust SIMD support will require both libraries and support in the Rust language.
Different approaches at the library level may indicate different language features to best support them.</p>
<h2 id="looking-forward">Looking forward</h2>
<p>My main goal in putting these prototypes forward, as well as writing these blog posts, is to spark conversation on how best to support SIMD programming in Rust.
If done well, it is a great opportunity for the language, and fits in with its focus on performance and portability.</p>
<p>As we build out the <a href="https://xi.zulipchat.com/#narrow/channel/197075-vello/topic/Potato.20-.20a.20paper.20design.20for.20a.20CPU.2FGPU.20hybrid.20renderer">Vello hybrid CPU/GPU renderer</a>, performance of the CPU components will rely heavily on SIMD, so we need to invest in writing a lot of SIMD code.
The most conservative approach would be hand-writing unsafe intrinsics-based code for all targets, but that's a lot of work and the use of unsafe is unappealing.
I'd love for the Rust ecosystem can come together and build good infrastructure, competitive with Highway.
For now, I think it's time to carefully consider the design space and try to come to consensus on what that should look like.</p>

<div>
<p>TLDR</p>
<p>You can add uv into the shebang line for a Python script to make it a self-contained executable.</p>
</div>
<p>I am working on a Go project to better learn the language. It's a simple API backed by a postgres database.</p>
<p>When I need to test out an endpoint, I prefer to use the <a href="https://www.python-httpx.org/">httpx</a> python package inside an
<a href="https://ipython.org/">ipython</a> REPL over making curl requests. It's nice to be able to introspect responses and easily
package payloads with dicts instead of writing out JSON.</p>
<p>Anyway, I decided to write a script to upsert some user data so that I can beat on my <code>/users</code> endpoint.</p>

<p>My <code>jam_users.py</code> script looks like this:</p>

</span></code></pre></div>
<p>This is really straight-forward. It will clear out any existing users and then insert these test users. Right after
that, I get dropped into an <code>ipython</code> repl to do what I need for testing. All I have to do is run:</p>

<p>However, if I want to run the script as-is, I will need to choose one of these approaches:</p>
<ul>
<li>Install the dependencies <code>httpx</code>, <code>IPython</code>, and <code>loguru</code> globally in my system python</li>
<li>Create a virtual environment, activate it, install deps, and run my script while the venv is activated</li>
</ul>
<p>These are both not great options in my opinion. These approaches also rely on having a system python installed that is
compatible with these packages. This isn't as big of a problem, but something to consider anyway.</p>
<p>I've been using <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/uv">uv</a> a lot lately, and I'm becoming quite enamoured with its usefulness
as a package manager, efficiency as a pip replacement, and abilities for isolated python executables. One thing that I
haven't used much yet are the special <code># /// script</code> tags in a python script.</p>
<p>When I first read about this functionality, I was pretty skeptical. I'm not particularly keen on embedding syntax into
comments. However, this seemed like the perfect application. So, updated my script to include the deps in the script
header like so:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span id="__span-2-1"><a id="__codelineno-2-1" name="__codelineno-2-1" href="#__codelineno-2-1"></a><span># /// script</span>
</span><span id="__span-2-2"><a id="__codelineno-2-2" name="__codelineno-2-2" href="#__codelineno-2-2"></a><span># dependencies = ["ipython", "httpx", "loguru"]</span>
</span><span id="__span-2-3"><a id="__codelineno-2-3" name="__codelineno-2-3" href="#__codelineno-2-3"></a><span># ///</span>
</span><span id="__span-2-4"><a id="__codelineno-2-4" name="__codelineno-2-4" href="#__codelineno-2-4"></a><span>import</span><span> </span><span>httpx</span>
</span><span id="__span-2-5"><a id="__codelineno-2-5" name="__codelineno-2-5" href="#__codelineno-2-5"></a><span>import</span><span> </span><span>IPython</span>
</span><span id="__span-2-6"><a id="__codelineno-2-6" name="__codelineno-2-6" href="#__codelineno-2-6"></a><span>from</span><span> </span><span>loguru</span><span> </span><span>import</span> <span>logger</span>
</span><span id="__span-2-7"><a id="__codelineno-2-7" name="__codelineno-2-7" href="#__codelineno-2-7"></a>
</span><span id="__span-2-8"><a id="__codelineno-2-8" name="__codelineno-2-8" href="#__codelineno-2-8"></a><span>...</span>
</span></code></pre></div>
<p>With this added, now I can run the script really easily with <code>uv</code>:</p>

<p>Great! Now, <code>uv</code> will create an isolated virtual environment for the script, download the dependencies and install them,
and then run my script in the context of that venv! I don't have to manage the virtual environment myself nor worry
about cluttering my system python with packages that I will invariably forget to remove later.</p>
<p>One nice thing about a regular Python script, though, is that you can make it executable with a shebang line:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span id="__span-4-1"><a id="__codelineno-4-1" name="__codelineno-4-1" href="#__codelineno-4-1"></a><span>#!/usr/bin/env python</span>
</span><span id="__span-4-2"><a id="__codelineno-4-2" name="__codelineno-4-2" href="#__codelineno-4-2"></a><span>...</span>
</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Now, if I make the script executable (<code>chmod +x jam_users.py</code>), I can invoke it directly as an executable script!
However, this won't take advantage of the <code>uv</code> script header because Python itself will just ignore the comment.</p>
<p>So, I did some digging and found out that you can actually embed the invocation of the uv command right in the shebang
line like so:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span id="__span-5-1"><a id="__codelineno-5-1" name="__codelineno-5-1" href="#__codelineno-5-1"></a><span>#!/usr/bin/env -S uv run --script</span>
</span><span id="__span-5-2"><a id="__codelineno-5-2" name="__codelineno-5-2" href="#__codelineno-5-2"></a><span># /// script</span>
</span><span id="__span-5-3"><a id="__codelineno-5-3" name="__codelineno-5-3" href="#__codelineno-5-3"></a><span># dependencies = ["ipython", "httpx", "loguru"]</span>
</span><span id="__span-5-4"><a id="__codelineno-5-4" name="__codelineno-5-4" href="#__codelineno-5-4"></a><span># ///</span>
</span><span id="__span-5-5"><a id="__codelineno-5-5" name="__codelineno-5-5" href="#__codelineno-5-5"></a><span>import</span><span> </span><span>httpx</span>
</span><span id="__span-5-6"><a id="__codelineno-5-6" name="__codelineno-5-6" href="#__codelineno-5-6"></a><span>import</span><span> </span><span>IPython</span>

<p>This works because the <code>-S</code> flag tells the system to split everything after it into separate arguments before passing it
to the system's <code>env</code>.</p>
<p>Now (after <code>chmod +x jam_users.py</code>, of course), I can execute my script directly:</p>

<p>That's it! What's even better is that I can run this script on any (Unix) system that has <code>uv</code> installed without needing
to do ANY dependency or virtual environment management.</p>
<p>Now, this script itself is really trivial and not much more than a toy example. However, in my past I have written
rather complex scripts that I needed to hand off to other users to run. Of course, this always came with a long
explanation of how to <em>prepare</em> their system just to run the script. This approach solves that problem instantly and
painlessly (as long as they have <code>uv</code> installed).</p>
<p>Take it for a spin, and let me know your thoughts.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading!</p>

        <h2>Convert Linux to Windows</h2>
        <span>2025-03-29</span>
		<p>
		Thesis: We should create a distro of Linux that runs Windows binaries by default via Wine.
		</p>
		<h3>The Linux Environment is Unstable</h3>
		<p>
		I can pull down a 20 year old exe and still run it today on Windows.
		Try doing the same with a Linux binary that's just a year old.
		There's no guarantee that it will be able to run based off some update that has happened. 
		There's also no guarantee that a binary produced today on Linux will even work on the various distributions of Linux today due to the same installed library version problem. 
		</p>
		<p>
		While the Linux syscalls themselves are very stable and reliable, the c library on top of them <a href="https://jangafx.com/insights/Linux-binary-compatibility">is not</a>.
		Practically all of userland is based on libc, and therefore by proxy Linux itself has a binary compatibility problem.
		</p>

		<h3>Binary Distribution is a Problem</h3>
		<p>
		Because of the problems listed above (and more), there is no good way to distribute binaries for Linux. 
		There are four (yes four!) major ways to distribute binaries, and they all have problems:
		</p><ol>
			<li>The raw binary. If this worked, we wouldn't need the other solutions.</li>
			<li>AppImage. Completely self-contained artifact that bundles all dependencies in with the binary.</li>
			<li>Flatpak. A package manager that provides a sandbox for each application.</li>
			<li>Snaps. Yet another package manager that runs applications in a sandbox.</li>
		</ol>
		
		<p>
		There are even more ways of distributing binaries, but these are the major ones. 
		What's crazy is that all four methods can be used at once on a system, each with their own methods of installing, updating, and deleting applications.
		I won't go into the pros and cons of each method here, but there are arguments about each.
		</p>
		<p>
		A major downside for all these methods is that application preservation is essentially non-existant for all of them. 
		Can a person archive an application for 20 years, pull it from the dustbin, and execute it with no other effort?
		Maybe for AppImage? Who knows? 
		It's a definite "no" for the other three methods.
		</p>

		<h3>Win32 is the Answer</h3>
		<p>
		A few years ago, Arek Hiler wrote a blog post, <a href="https://blog.hiler.eu/win32-the-only-stable-abi/">Win32 Is The Only Stable ABI On Linux</a>.
		He is absolutely right, and I believe this insight holds the answer to Linux's compatibility problem. 
		This is actually made possible by a genius decision for the design of Win32.
		</p>
		<p>
		In Linux, you can make system calls directly. 
		Just fill up some registers and make a syscall interrupt.
		</p>
		<p>
		In Windows, you do not make system calls directly. 
		Instead, you dynamically link to libraries that make the system calls for you. 
		This allows Microsoft to do all sorts of shenanigans at the kernal level while providing a stable API to userspace.
		This little stroke of genius allows us to have both Linux and Windows on the same machine at the same time. 
		</p>
		<p>
		If you think about it, there are only two major differences between a Windows app and a Linux app. 
		One, they use different executable formats.
		Two, Windows uses dynamic libraries to make system calls.
		Just use a PE format instead of ELF, load a couple libraries, and you essentially have a Windows application!
		We also already have a simple way to run Windows applications, Wine.
		</p>
		<p>
		Wine is a miraculous project.
		It provides amazing compatibility with Windows applications going all the way back to the 32-bit Windows 95 era. 
		It even implements DirectX!
		The difference between what Windows supports and Wine supports is approaching zero over time (especially if you stick to Win32).
		Wine is the magic we can use to fix our problem.
		</p>

		<h3>A New Distro</h3>
		<p>
		Imagine we made a new Linux distro. 
		This distro would provide a desktop environment that looks close enough to Windows that a Windows user could use it without training. 
		You could install and run Windows applications exactly as you do on Windows; no extra work needed.
		How would this work?
		</p>
		<p>
		The distro would come with Wine pre-installed, and there would be some small patches to the Linux kernel.
		A small modification to the "exec" family of system calls to dispatch on executble type would allow any Linux application to fork an exec a Windows application with no effort. 
		</p>
		<p>
		A wine prefix could be setup for each user, and the desktop environment would work off of that prefix, presenting a Windows-like file system to the user, and to user applications. 
		Linux as we know it would still be available, but hidden for the normal GUI desktop user. 
		</p>

		<h3>True Multiplatform</h3>
		Wine works on Linux, FreeBSD, ReactOS, macOS, Android, and Haiku. 
		If we published all our applications as Windows/Win32 apps we could achive multiplatform compatibility without any extra effort.

		<h3>The Looming Future</h3>
		<p>
		The two major commercial operating systems, MacOS and Windows, are heading in the same direction. 
		These OSs are becoming more locked down, violating privacy, and removing control user's have over their own computing environment. 
		Both OSs are arguably building in outright spyware into their operating systems. 
		Windows is going to take <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/retrace-your-steps-with-recall-aa03f8a0-a78b-4b3e-b0a1-2eb8ac48701c">screenshots</a> of your screen every few seconds and have an AI analyze it.
		MacOS has a feature called <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/102445">Gatekeeper</a>, which limits what software you can run on your Mac to only those applications that Apple approves.
		Both Apple and Microsoft are in the process of adding the ability to scan your computer for "illegal" files and report you to the authorities. 
		</p>
		<p>
		These features are done in the name of convenience and "child safety", but the net effect is that billions of users lose their agency and control over their own computers. 
		What happens when you no longer have any control over your computer? 
		What happens when your operating system is a subscription?
		What happens when you do something these companies don't like and you are banned from using any computer?
		</p>
		<p>
		Microsoft is already <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/03/new-windows-11-build-makes-mandatory-microsoft-account-sign-in-even-more-mandatory/">removing the ability</a> to run Windows without an online account.
		If you lose your account, even for a mistake, you lose the ability to run a computer. 
		</p>
		<p>
		<em><strong>NOTE:</strong> I am not against Apple or Microsoft. They have amazing engineers! I don't think they're being malicious. Rather, I think the incentives for these companies are improperly aligned. Economic and governmental forces are guiding them down this path. They could absolutely change tack and try to empower users, but I think we shouldn't assume that will happen naturally.</em>
		</p>
		<p>
		This is why I think we need a "Windows" distro of Linux.
		Not only does it solve our binary compatibility problem, it also provides an onramp to Windows users who will be forced to "upgrade" to Windows 11 in October of this year.
		Wouldn't it be great to have a painless way to switch Linux?
		</p>

		<p>
		Just a thought.
		</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div dir="auto"><p>Until a few years ago, any app you installed on an Android device could see all other apps on your phone without your permission. </p><p><span>Since 2022, with Android 11, Google removed this access from app developers. Under their new package visibility policy, apps </span><em>should</em><span> only see other installed apps if it’s essential to their core functionality. Developers must also explicitly declare these apps in the AndroidManifest.xml file - a required configuration file for all Android apps.</span></p><p><span>For extremely specific use cases such as file managers, browsers or antivirus apps, Google grants an exception by allowing </span><code>QUERY_ALL_PACKAGES</code><span> permission, which provides full visibility into installed apps. </span></p><p>I don’t use Android as my primary phone, but I have a spare one and I was really curious to find out which apps from Indian companies had checks to see what other apps I had installed.</p><p>So I downloaded a few dozen Indian apps I could think of on top of my head and started reading their manifest files. Surely they will be respectful of my privacy and will only query apps essential to their app's core functionality? 🙃</p><p>It's worth acknowledging that there are some legitimate reasons for an app to check which other apps are installed on your phone. For example, an app might check which UPI apps are installed to show relevant payment options. Most of the manifest files I examined included checks for these apps. Some also looked for app cloning or multi-account apps, likely for security and fraud detection. All acceptable use cases.</p><p>But a few Indian companies went above and beyond with these checks. Let’s start with Swiggy. It has a staggering 154 package names listed in its manifest file, allowing it to query those apps on my phone.

I hope someone reading this can do a thorough analysis. It's probably because of the bubble I live in, but I hadn’t even heard of most of these apps. Even though most of them have tens of millions of downloads.</span></p><p><span>Beyond the usual categories, I see there are checks for apps like Tamil Calendar, Odia Calendar, Qibla Direction Finder, mandir apps, astrology apps. They know what they’re doing.</span></p></div><p>There is "Jodii for Diploma, +2,10 below", a matrimony app for those who haven’t graduated high school. It has 10M+ downloads.</p><p>Then there is also "गाय भैंस खरीदें बेचें Animall" (cow buy/sell marketplace?) which also has more than 10M downloads.</p><p>This list of apps is a window into how a large part of India uses their phones - their daily lives, habits, and priorities. </p><p><span>Another leading personal loan app, Moneyview, with over 50 million downloads, has included checks for a staggering </span><strong>944</strong><span> apps in its manifest file - the highest among all the apps I examined. I am not including it in this post, you can read the </span><a href="https://github.com/pea1bee/android-manifest-files/blob/main/Moneyview-AndroidManifest.xml" rel="">full list here</a><span>. </span></p><p><span>I'm surprised KreditBee and Moneyview apps passed the Play Store's review. Play Store policy </span><a href="https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/10158779#zippy=%2Cexceptions" rel="">explicitly restricts</a><span> personal loan apps from using the </span><code>QUERY_ALL_PACKAGES</code><span> permission.  But these apps are bypassing this restriction by individually listing every app they want to detect in their manifest file instead.</span></p><p><span>I found only one manifest file which had the high-risk and sensitive </span><code>QUERY_ALL_PACKAGES</code><span> permission - it was Cred’s. Play Store grants a "temporary exception" to include this permission if apps have “a verifiable core purpose facilitating financial-transactions involving financially regulated instruments”.  </span></p><p>But none of the other apps in the same segment as Cred I analyzed like PhonePe or PayTM had this permission in their manifest files. In fact, Cred offers personal loans too which as per Play Store’s Personal loans policy, is not eligible for this exception. Not sure how Cred is still allowed to keep this permission, which lets it see all the apps on your phone without any disclosures.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4cfbfc7d-5585-454d-8f07-d428f03b15b9_634x358.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4cfbfc7d-5585-454d-8f07-d428f03b15b9_634x358.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4cfbfc7d-5585-454d-8f07-d428f03b15b9_634x358.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4cfbfc7d-5585-454d-8f07-d428f03b15b9_634x358.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4cfbfc7d-5585-454d-8f07-d428f03b15b9_634x358.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4cfbfc7d-5585-454d-8f07-d428f03b15b9_634x358.png" width="634" height="358" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/4cfbfc7d-5585-454d-8f07-d428f03b15b9_634x358.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:358,&quot;width&quot;:634,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:75001,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://peabee.substack.com/i/159986160?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4cfbfc7d-5585-454d-8f07-d428f03b15b9_634x358.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4cfbfc7d-5585-454d-8f07-d428f03b15b9_634x358.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4cfbfc7d-5585-454d-8f07-d428f03b15b9_634x358.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4cfbfc7d-5585-454d-8f07-d428f03b15b9_634x358.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4cfbfc7d-5585-454d-8f07-d428f03b15b9_634x358.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>I read the manifest files of around 50 popular apps from Indian companies. Apart from Swiggy, Zepto, Cred, and a couple of personal loan apps, most had fairly reasonable and respectful app query lists. </p><p>Guess I expected worse. Maybe I am too cynical about these apps - could they actually be the good guys? 🙃</p><p>As I was about to conclude this exercise, I noticed a couple of interesting lines when I was skimming through the manifest file of one of the apps:</p><pre><code>&lt;queries&gt;
  [...]
  &lt;intent&gt;
    &lt;action android:name="android.intent.action.MAIN" /&gt;
  &lt;/intent&gt;
  [...]
&lt;/queries&gt;</code></pre><p>I am no expert in Android development, but from what I understand, the "ACTION_MAIN" filter in the configuration above allows visibility to all installed apps that, simply put, have a screen.</p><p><span>Since most installed apps run in the foreground and have a user interface, this filter grants developers access to see all the apps on your phone - without needing the </span><code>QUERY_ALL_PACKAGES</code><span> permission!</span></p><p>To be sure, I vibe co -- I can't say it without wincing -- I vibe coded a basic android app and added the same "ACTION_MAIN" filter in my manifest file. And when I queried for installed packages, just as expected, this little hack returned a list of all the apps on my phone!!!</p><p>This seems like a massive privacy loophole in Android. Surely Play Store would reject apps that use this hack as this is a blatant violation of their store's user data policy? </p><p>Out of 47 Indian apps I randomly analyzed, 31 of them used the "ACTION_MAIN" filter - giving them access to see all the apps on your phone without any disclosure. That's 2 out of 3 apps.</p><p>Apps using this hack: </p><blockquote><p><em>Astrotalk, Axis Mobile, Bajaj Finserv, BookMyShow, Cars24, Cure.fit, Fibe, Groww, Housing, Instamart, Ixigo, JioHotstar, KreditBee, KukuTV, LazyPay, Ludo King, Meesho, MoneyTap, Moneyview, Navi, NoBroker, Nykaa, Ola, PhonePe, PhysicsWallah, Slice, Spinny, Swiggy, Swiggy Delivery, Tata Neu, and Zomato.</em></p></blockquote><p>Apps that don't use this hack: </p><blockquote><p><em>Airtel Thanks, Blinkit, Byju’s, MyGate, Dream11, Flipkart, HDFC Mobile, Healthify, INDmoney, MyJio, Paytm, PaisaBazaar, ShareChat, Unacademy, Vedantu, Zepto</em></p></blockquote><p>Even fucking Ludo King has this in its manifest file. So most Indian companies can actually see all the apps on your phone - they're just sneakier about it than the likes of Swiggy and Zepto. So much for being the good guys.</p><div><p><span>In fact, Swiggy has got this filter config too, yet it still chooses to explicitly lists the apps it queries when it could just as easily do this discreetly behind closed doors like others. But I’m not complaining. This oversight from them gives a glimpse into Swiggy’s data collection practices. If Google had enforced this policy properly, we might have had similar visibility into other companies as well.</span></p><p><span>All the manifest files I read are in </span><a href="https://github.com/pea1bee/android-manifest-files" rel="">my Github</a><span>. The majority were downloaded on March 18 or 19.</span></p></div><p><span>This hack isn’t exclusively used by apps from Indian companies. I checked the manifest files of some other popular apps. </span><em>Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, Subway Surfers, and Truecaller</em><span> all have this config. Meanwhile, </span><em>Amazon, Spotify, X, Discord, and WhatsApp</em><span> didn’t. I didn’t investigate further beyond these.</span></p><p>This makes me wonder, what was the whole purpose of Google's package visibility policy? It was supposed to protect users, yet most apps seem to have found ways around it anyway.</p><p><span>And installed app data is very sensitive and personal. In 2022, </span><a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/data-marketplace-selling-clue-period-tracking-data/" rel="">Vice reported</a><span> that a data marketplace called Narrative was selling data on users who had downloaded period-tracking apps right after news emerged that Roe v. Wade (which had federally protected abortion rights in the U.S.) could be overturned. This is frightening to even think about. </span></p><p>Installed apps data is one data point. The extensive set of permissions each and every one of these apps have included in their manifest files, often far beyond what’s necessary is another can of worm for someone else to open. </p><p><span>I’ll conclude this post with a tiny example from Zepto. They ask for </span><code>READ_SMS</code><span> permission. You can deny it, but it’s mandatory if you sign up for Zepto Postpaid. </span></p><p>When you grant the permission, this is the list of sender IDs they check for in your inbox:</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd062bfa0-bcea-41e9-b754-24f85d5c4ca5_588x184.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd062bfa0-bcea-41e9-b754-24f85d5c4ca5_588x184.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd062bfa0-bcea-41e9-b754-24f85d5c4ca5_588x184.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd062bfa0-bcea-41e9-b754-24f85d5c4ca5_588x184.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd062bfa0-bcea-41e9-b754-24f85d5c4ca5_588x184.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd062bfa0-bcea-41e9-b754-24f85d5c4ca5_588x184.png" width="588" height="184" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/d062bfa0-bcea-41e9-b754-24f85d5c4ca5_588x184.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:184,&quot;width&quot;:588,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:52980,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://peabee.substack.com/i/159986160?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd062bfa0-bcea-41e9-b754-24f85d5c4ca5_588x184.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd062bfa0-bcea-41e9-b754-24f85d5c4ca5_588x184.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd062bfa0-bcea-41e9-b754-24f85d5c4ca5_588x184.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd062bfa0-bcea-41e9-b754-24f85d5c4ca5_588x184.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd062bfa0-bcea-41e9-b754-24f85d5c4ca5_588x184.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>Most of them are TRAI sender IDs of banks.

            Apple has been getting hammered in tech and <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/apple-ai-siri-development-behind-9ea65ee8" target="_blank">financial media</a> for its uncharacteristically messy foray into artificial intelligence. After <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/10/business/apple-iphone-ai-nightcap/index.html">a June event</a> heralding a new AI-powered Siri, the company has delayed its release indefinitely. The AI features Apple has rolled out, including text message summaries, are <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/12/24289939/apple-intelligence-ai-notification-summaries-awkward-funny-bad" target="_blank">comically unhelpful.</a>

            Apple, like every other big player in tech, is scrambling to find ways to inject AI into its products. Why? <em>Well, it’s the</em> <em>future!</em> What problems is it solving? <em>Well, so far that’s not clear! </em>Are customers demanding it? <em>LOL, no. </em>In fact, last year the backlash against one of Apple’s early ads for its AI <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/05/10/business/ai-dystopia-silicon-valley-nightcap/index.html">was so hostile</a> the company had to pull the commercial.

            The real reason companies are doing this is because <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/02/tech/wall-street-asks-big-tech-will-ai-ever-make-money/index.html">Wall Street wants them</a> to.

            In a rush to please shareholders, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/19/tech/apple-iphone-siri-delay/index.html">Apple made a rare stumble</a>. The company is owning its error, it seems, and has said the delayed features would roll out “in the coming year.”

            There’s a popular adage in policy circles: “The party can never fail, it can only be failed.” It is meant as a critique of the ideological gatekeepers who may, for example, blame voters for their party’s failings rather than the party itself.

            Tech columnists such as the New York Times’ Kevin Roose have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/14/podcasts/hardfork-siri-starlink.html" target="_blank">suggested recently</a> that Apple has failed AI, rather than the other way around.

            “Apple is not meeting the moment in AI,” Roose said on his podcast, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/14/podcasts/hardfork-siri-starlink.html" target="_blank">Hard Fork</a>, earlier this month. “I just think that when you’re building products with generative AI built into it, you do just need to be more comfortable with error, with mistakes, with things that are a little rough around the edges.”

            Roose is right that Apple is, to put it mildly, a fastidious creator of consumer products. It is, after all, the $3-trillion empire built by the notoriously detail-obsessed Steve Jobs.

            The Apple brand is perhaps the most meticulously controlled corporate identity on the planet. Its “walled garden” of iOS — despised by developers and fair game for accusations of monopolistic behavior, to be sure — is also part of the reason one billion people have learned to trust Apple with their sensitive personal data.

            And not only do we trust Apple to keep our data safe, we trust it to design things that are accessible out of the box.

You will almost never need a user manual filled with tiny print. Even your Boomer parents will be able to navigate FaceTime calls with minimal effort.

            Roose contends, at one point in the episode, that “there are people who use AI systems who know that they are not perfect<s>,</s>” and that those regular users understand there’s a right way and a wrong way to query a chatbot.

            This is where we, the people, are apparently failing AI.

            As Hard Fork co-host Casey Newton notes in the same episode, it’s not as if Google or Amazon has figured out some incredible use case that’s making users rush to buy a new Pixel phone or an Echo speaker.

            In other words: Large language models are fascinating science. They are an academic wonder with huge potential and some early commercial successes, such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Anthropic’s Claude. But a bot that’s 80% accurate — a figure Newton made up, but we’ll go with it — isn’t a very useful consumer product.

            Back in June, Apple floated a compelling scenario for its newfangled Siri. Imagine yourself, frazzled and running late for work, simply saying into your phone: Hey Siri, what time does my mom’s flight land? And is it at JFK or LaGuardia? In theory, Siri could scan your email and texts with your mom and give you an answer. That saves you several annoying steps of opening your email to find the flight number, copying it, then pasting it into Google to find the flight’s status.

            If it’s 100% accurate, it’s a fantastic time saver. If it is anything less than 100% accurate, it’s useless. Because even if there’s a 2% chance it’s wrong, there’s a 2% chance you’re stranding mom at the airport, and mom will be, rightly, very disappointed. Our moms deserve better!

<pre>Message-ID: &lt;53411a5a-3b7f-4993-a66e-8e93cd2efb1c@atoptool.nl&gt;
Date: Sat, 29 Mar 2025 18:39:29 +0100
From: Gerlof Langeveld &lt;gerlof.langeveld@...ptool.nl&gt;

Subject: CVE-2025-31160 Atop 2.11 heap problems

Introduction:
Atop mainly reads the system level and process level from the /proc and
/sys directories. However, certain counters might be obtained from other
optional sources, that have to be activated explicitly.

One of these sources is the 'atopgpud' daemon, which permanently gathers
metrics about the utilization of GPUs. It offers a local TCP port to which
atop can connect to retrieve GPU-related counters. These counters are
provided as strings that have to be parsed by atop.


Vulnerability:
The vulnerability is caused by the fact that atop always tries to connect
to the TCP port of 'atopgpud' during initialization. When another local
program has been started (instead of 'atopgpud') that listens to this TCP
port, atop connects to that program. Such program is able then to send
unexpected strings that may lead to parsing failures in atop. These failures
result in heap problems and segmentation faults.

Although no additional information has been received about these heap
problems, the described heap problems were reproduced with a custom
developed test program.

The vulnerability is present since the introduction of 'atopgpud'
in atop 2.4.0.


Solution:
1) Most systems will not explicitly activate the 'atopgpud' daemon.
 &nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore, the default behavior of atop is now not to connect to the TCP
 &nbsp;&nbsp; port at all. Only when atop is started with the '-k' flag it will try to
 &nbsp;&nbsp; connect to the TCP port (in case you know that 'atopgpud' is running).

2) When the '-k' flag is used, the parsing of the strings is improved to
 &nbsp;&nbsp; avoid that heap problems can occur.

3) Another optional source for atop might be 'netatop' or 'netatop-bpf'.
 &nbsp;&nbsp; Since most systems will not explicitly install/use these sources, 
the default
 &nbsp;&nbsp; behavior of atop is now not to try to find these sources. Only when 
atop is
 &nbsp;&nbsp; started with the '-K' flag it will try to find 'netatop' or 
'netatop-bpf'.

<p>Some film­mak­ers start in com­mer­cials, hon­ing their chops in antic­i­pa­tion of mak­ing per­son­al projects lat­er. A select few go in the oth­er direc­tion, real­iz­ing their dis­tinc­tive vision before field­ing offers from com­pa­nies who want a piece of that vision’s cul­tur­al cur­ren­cy. Any­one who’s seen David Lynch’s most acclaimed work&nbsp;will sus­pect, cor­rect­ly, that Lynch belongs in the lat­ter group. With 1977’s cult hit&nbsp;<em>Eraser­head</em>, he showed cin­e­ma what it means to be <a href="http://www.openculture.com/2017/11/what-makes-a-david-lynch-film-lynchian-a-video-essay.html">Lynchi­an</a>. This brought him the atten­tion of Hol­ly­wood, lead­ing to the respectable suc­cess of&nbsp;<em>The Ele­phant Man&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;the dis­as­ter that was&nbsp;<em>Dune</em>. Only in 1986, with&nbsp;<em>Blue Vel­vet</em>, could Lynch make a tru­ly, even trou­bling­ly per­son­al film that hit the zeit­geist at just the right moment.</p>
<p>Nat­u­ral­ly, Madi­son Avenue came call­ing soon there­after. “With the smash <em>Blue Vel­vet</em>, a Palme d’or at Cannes for <em>Wild at Heart</em>, and then the nation­al phe­nom­e­non of <em>Twin Peaks</em>’ first sea­son, David Lynch clear­ly estab­lished him­self as the U.S.A.‘s fore­most com­mer­cial­ly viable avant-garde-‘offbeat’ direc­tor,” wrote David Fos­ter Wal­lace in <a href="http://www.lynchnet.com/lh/lhpremiere.html">a 1997 piece on the film­mak­er</a>.</p>


<p>“For a while there it looked like he might be able to sin­gle-hand­ed­ly bro­ker a new mar­riage between art and com­merce in U.S. movies, open­ing for­mu­la-frozen Hol­ly­wood to some of the eccen­tric­i­ty and vig­or of art film.”&nbsp;<span>Lynch’s fans in tele­vi­sion adver­tis­ing must have imag­ined that he could do the same for their indus­try, and you can watch the fruits of that hunch in the </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RoCYbQBTmlY">half-hour com­pi­la­tion of Lynch-direct­ed com­mer­cials</a><span> above.</span></p>
<p>Lynch has worked for some star­tling­ly big brands, begin­ning with Calvin Klein: his <a href="http://www.openculture.com/2014/01/david-lynchs-literary-perfume-ads.html">trio of spots for the fra­grance&nbsp;Obses­sion</a> take as their basis the writ­ing of F. Scott Fitzger­ald, Ernest Hem­ing­way, and D.H. Lawrence. A few years lat­er he direct­ed a humor­ous <a href="http://www.openculture.com/2015/11/david-lynch-directs-a-mini-season-of-twin-peaks-in-the-form-of-japanese-coffee-commercials.html">mini-sea­son of <em>Twin Peaks</em> to pro­mote Geor­gia Cof­fee</a>, one of the top brands of canned cof­fee in the&nbsp;Lynch-lov­ing coun­try of&nbsp;Japan. The New York Depart­ment of San­i­ta­tion engaged Lynch’s ser­vices to imbue their anti-lit­ter­ing cam­paign with his sig­na­ture high-con­trast omi­nous­ness, a mood also sought by fash­ion-indus­try titans like Armani, Yves Saint Lau­rent, Guc­ci, and Dior. The mar­keters of hum­bler goods like Alka-Seltzer, Bar­il­la Pas­ta (a seem­ing­ly auteur-aware brand that <a href="http://www.openculture.com/2012/07/wim_wenders_sells_beer_stella_artois_pasta_barilla_and_more_beer_carling.html">has also hired Wim Wen­ders</a> and <a href="http://www.openculture.com/2012/01/fellinis_fantastic_tv_commercials.html">Felli­ni</a>), and Clear Blue Easy home preg­nan­cy tests have also gone in for a touch of the Lynchi­an.</p>
<p>Quite a few of these com­mer­cials orig­i­nal­ly aired only out­side Amer­i­ca, which may reflect the sup­pos­ed­ly more endur­ing appre­ci­a­tion of Lynch’s work that exists in Europe and Asia. But for all Lynch’s artis­tic dar­ing, the man him­self has always come off as an enthu­si­ast of unre­con­struct­ed Amer­i­can plea­sures. To this day he remains a stead­fast smok­er, and in 1998 brought that per­son­al cred­i­bil­i­ty to the Swiss cig­a­rette brand Parisi­enne. The result­ing spot fea­tures men in ties, show­ers of sparks, dead fish, back­wards talk­ing, a for­bid­ding­ly illu­mi­nat­ed shack, and apoc­a­lyp­tic flames:&nbsp;Parisi­enne, in oth­er words, must have got exact­ly what they paid for.</p>

            <span>Abstract:</span>  This course, intended for undergraduates familiar with elementary calculus and linear algebra, introduces the extension of differential calculus to functions on more general vector spaces, such as functions that take as input a matrix and return a matrix inverse or factorization, derivatives of ODE solutions, and even stochastic derivatives of random functions. It emphasizes practical computational applications, such as large-scale optimization and machine learning, where derivatives must be re-imagined in order to be propagated through complicated calculations. The class also discusses efficiency concerns leading to "adjoint" or "reverse-mode" differentiation (a.k.a. "backpropagation"), and gives a gentle introduction to modern automatic differentiation (AD) techniques.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>


<p>by <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ploum">Ploum</a> on 2025-03-28</p><h2 id="soustitre-1">I mean, come on!</h2>
<p>Amazon recently announced that, from now on, everything you say to Alexa will be sent to their server.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2025/03/15/altering-the-deal/">Pluralistic: Amazon annihilates Alexa privacy settings, turns on continuous, nonconsensual audio uploading (15 Mar 2025) (pluralistic.net)</a></li>
</ul>
<p>What surprised me the most with this announcement is how it was met with surprise and harsh reactions. People felt betrayed.</p>
<p>I mean, come on!</p>
<p>Did you really think that Amazon was not listening to you before that? Did you really buy an Alexa trusting Amazon to "protect your privacy"?</p>
<p>Recently, I came across a comment on Hacker News where the poster defended Apple as protecting privacy of its users because "They market their product as protecting our privacy".</p>
<p>I mean, once again, come on!</p>
<p>Did you really think that "marketing" is telling the truth? Are you a freshly debarked Thermian? (In case you missed it, this is a Galaxy Quest reference.)</p>
<p>The whole point of marketing is to lie, lie and lie again. </p>
<h2 id="soustitre-2">What is the purpose of that gadget?</h2>
<p>The whole point of the whole Amazon Alexa tech stack is to send information to Amazon. That’s the main goal of the thing. The fact that it is sometimes useful to you is a direct consequence of the thing sending information to Amazon. Just like Facebook linking you with friends is a consequence of you giving your information to Meta. Usefulness is only a byproduct of privacy invasion.</p>
<p>Having a fine-grained setting enabling "do not send all information to Amazon please" is, at best, wishful thinking. We had the same in the browser ("do-not-track"). It didn’t work. </p>
<p>I’ve always been convinced that the tech geeks who bought an Amazon Alexa perfectly knew what they were doing. One of my friends has a Google Echo and justify it with "Google already knows everything about our family through our phones, so I’m trading only a bit more of our privacy for convenience". I don’t agree with him but, at the very least, it’s a logical opinion.</p>
<p>We all know that what can be done with a tool will be done eventually. And you should prepare for it. On a side note, I also postulate that the reason Amazon removed that setting is because they were already gathering too much data to justify its existence in case there’s a complaint or an investigation in the future."How did you manage to get those data while your product says it will not send data?". </p>
<p>But, once again, any tech person knows that pushing a button in an interface is not a proof of anything in the underlying software. </p>
<h2 id="soustitre-3">Please stop being naive about Apple</h2>
<p>That’s also the point with Apple: Apple is such a big company that the right hand has no idea about what the left hand is doing. Some privacy people are working at Apple and doing good job. But their work is continuously diluted through the interests of quick and cheap production, marketing, release, new features, gathering data for advertising purpose. Apple is not a privacy company and has never been: it is an opportunistic company which advertise privacy when it feels it could help sell more iPhones. But deeply inside, they absolutely don’t care and they will absolutely trade the (very little) privacy they have if it means selling more.</p>
<p>Sometimes, geek naivety is embarrassingly stupid. Like "brand loyalty". Marketing lies to you. As a rule of thumb, the bigger the company, the bigger the lie. In tech, there’s no way for a big company to not lie because marketers have no real understanding of they are selling. Do you really think that people who chose to advertise "privacy" at Apple have any strong knowledge about "privacy"? That they could simply give you a definition of "privacy"?</p>
<p>I know that intelligent people go to great intellectual contortions to justify buying the latest overpriced spying shiny coloured screen with an apple logo. It looks like most humans actively look to see their freedom restricted. Seirdy calls it "the domestication of users".</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://seirdy.one/posts/2021/01/27/whatsapp-and-the-domestication-of-users/">WhatsApp and the domestication of users (seirdy.one)</a></li>
</ul>
<p>And that’s why I see Apple as a cult: most tech people cannot be reasoned about it.</p>

</ul>
<h2 id="soustitre-4">You can’t find a technical solution to a lie</h2>
<p>Bill Cole, contributor to Spamassassin, recently posted on Mastodon that the whole DNS stack to protect spammers was not working.</p>
<blockquote> spammers are more consistent at making SPF, DKIM, and DMARC correct than are legitimate senders.<br></blockquote>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://toad.social/@grumpybozo/114213600922816869">🆘Bill Cole 🇺🇦: "@jwz@mastodon.social The stats we collect for the…" (toad.social)</a></li>
</ul>
<p>It is, once again, a naive approach to spam. The whole stack was designed with the mindset "bad spammers will try to hide themselves". But was is happening in your inbox, really?</p>
<p>Most spam is not "black hat spam". It is what I call "white-collar spam": perfectly legitimate company, sending you emails from legitimate address. You slept in a hotel during a business trip? Now you will receive weekly emails about our hotel for the rest of your life. And it is the same for any shop, any outlet, anything you have done. Your inbox is filled with "white-collar" junk. And they know this perfectly well. </p>
<p>In Europe, we have a rule, the RGPD, which forbid businesses to keep your data without your express consent. I did the experiment for several months to send a legal threat to every single white-collar spam I received. Guess what: they always replied that it was a mistake, that I was now removed, that it should not have happened, that I checked the box (which was false but how could I prove it?) or even, on one occasion, that they restored a backup containing my email before I unsubscribed (I unsubscribed from that one 10 years before, which makes it very unlikely).</p>
<p>In short, they lied. All of them. All of them are spammers and they lie pretending that "they thought you were interested".</p>
<p>In one notable case, they told me that they had erased all my data while, still having the cookie on my laptop, I could see and use my account. Thirty days later, I was still connected and I figured that they simply managed to change my user id from "ploum" to "deleted_ploum" in the database. While answering me straight in the face that they had no information about me in their database.</p>
<p>Corporations are lying. You must treat every corporate word as a straight lie until proved otherwise. </p>
<h2 id="soustitre-5">But Ploum, if all marketing is a lie, why trusting Signal?</h2>
<p>If you can’t trust marketing, why do I use Signal and Protonmail?</p>
<p>First of all, Signal is open source. And, yes, I’ve read some of the source code for some feature I was interested in. I’ve also read through some very deep audit of Signal source code.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://soatok.blog/2025/02/18/reviewing-the-cryptography-used-by-signal/">Reviewing the Cryptography Used by Signal (soatok.blog)</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I’m also trusting the people behind Signal. I’m trusting people who recommend Signal. I’m trusting the way Signal is built. </p>
<p>But most importantly, Signal sole existence is to protect privacy of its users. It’s not even a corporation and, yes, this is important.</p>
<p>Yes, they could lie in their marketing. Like Telegram did (and still does AFAIK). But this would undermine their sole reason to exist.</p>
<p>I don’t say that Signal is perfect: I say I trust them to believe themselves what they announce. For now.</p>
<h2 id="soustitre-6">What about Protonmail?</h2>
<p>For the same reasons, Protonmail can, to some extent, be trusted. Technically, they can access most of the emails of their customers (because those emails arrive unencrypted to PM’s servers). But I trust Protonmail not to sell any data because if there’s any doubt that they do it, the whole business will crumble. They have a strong commercial incentive to do everything they can to protect my data. I pay them for that. It’s not a "checkbox" they could remove, it’s their whole raison d’être.</p>
<p>This is also why I pay for Kagi as my search engine: their business incentive is to provide me the best search results with less slop, less advertising. As soon as they start doing some kind of advertising, I will stop paying them and they know it. Or if Kagi starts becoming to AI centric for my taste, like they did for Lori:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://d-shoot.net/kagi.html">Why I Lost Faith in Kagi (d-shoot.net)</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I don’t blindly trust companies. Paying them is not a commitment to obey them, au contraire. Every relation with a commercial entity is, by essence, temporary. I pay for a service with strings attached. If the service degrade, if my conditions are not respected, I stop paying. If I’m not convinced they can be trusted, I stop paying them. I know I can pay and still be the product. If I have any doubt, I don’t pay. I try to find an alternative and migrate to it. Email being critical to me, I always have two accounts on two different trustable providers with an easy migrating path (which boils down to changing my DNS config).</p>
<h2 id="soustitre-7">Fighting the Androidification</h2>
<p>Cory Doctorow speaks a lot about enshitification. Where users are more and more exploited. But one key component of a good enshitification is what I call "Androidification".</p>
<p>Androidification is not about degrading the user experience. It’s about closing doors, removing special use cases, being less and less transparent. It’s about taking open source software and frog boiling it to a full closed proprietary state while killing all the competition in the process. </p>
<p>Android was, at first, an Open Source project. With each release, it became more closed, more proprietary. As I explain in my "20 years of Linux on the Desktop" essay, I believe it has always been part of the plan. Besides the Linux kernel, Google was always wary not to include any GPL or LGPL licensed library in Android.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://ploum.net/2025-03-08-linux_desktop3.html">20 years of Linux on the Desktop (part 3) (ploum.net)</a></li>
</ul>
<p>It took them 15 years but they finally achieved killing the Android Open Source Project:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-android-development-aosp-3538503/">Google will develop the Android OS fully in private, here's why (www.androidauthority.com)</a></li>
</ul>
<p>This is why I’m deeply concerned by the motivation of Canonical to switch Ubuntu’s coreutils to an MIT licensed version.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2025/03/19/ubuntu_2510_rust/">Ubuntu 25.10 plans to swap GNU coreutils for Rust (go.theregister.com)</a></li>
</ul>
<p>This is why I’m deeply concerned that Protonmail quietly removed the issue tracker from its Protonmail Bridge Github page (making the development completely opaque for what is an essential tool for technical Protonmail users).</p>
<h2 id="soustitre-8">I mean, commons!</h2>
<p>This whole naivety is also why I’m deeply concerned by very intelligent and smart tech people not understanding what "copyleft" is, why it is different from "open source" and why they should care.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://ploum.net/2023-06-19-more-rms.html">We need more of Richard Stallman, not less (ploum.net)</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Corporations are not your friend. They never were. They lie. The only possible relationship with them is an opportunistic one. And if you want to build commons that they cannot steal, you need strong copyleft.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://ploum.net/2024-07-01-opensource_sustainability.html">On Open Source and the Sustainability of the Commons (ploum.net)</a></li>
</ul>
<p>But firstly, my fellow geeks, you need to lose your candid naivety.</p>
<p>I mean, come on, let’s build the commons!</p>

Other states, including Florida and Ohio, are weighing similar legislation.<!-- --></p><p>Fluoride has been added to US drinking water since 1945 to prevent cavities.<!-- --></p><p>Utah's move to remove the mineral has been criticised by experts, who worry it will have consequences for oral health, especially for children.<!-- --></p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>The bill, signed by Cox on Thursday, prohibits communities from adding fluoride to their public water supplies.<!-- --></p><p>The law does not mention any public health concerns related to the mineral, but Republican state lawmaker Stephanie Gricius - who introduced the bill in the state legislature - has argued that there is research suggesting fluoride could have possible cognitive effects in children.<!-- --></p><p>Gricius has said that her bill would give citizens a choice whether they want to consume fluoride or not.<!-- --></p><p>This concern over fluoride was previously raised by Kennedy, the US health secretary, who said in November that "the Trump White House will advise all US water systems to remove fluoride from public water".<!-- --></p><p>He alleged the chemical found in toothpaste and regularly used by dentists "is an industrial waste associated with arthritis, bone fractures, bone cancer, IQ loss, neurodevelopmental disorders, and thyroid disease".<!-- --></p><p>Most public health experts have rejected these claims and alleged that Kennedy had cited data from studies conducted in countries with far higher levels of fluoride in their water systems than the US has. <!-- --></p><p>The American Dental Association sharply criticised Utah for its decision, saying that it shows "wanton disregard for the oral health and well-being of their constituents".<!-- --></p><p>"It is disheartening to see that a proven, public health policy, which exists for the greater good of an entire community's oral health, has been dismantled based on distorted pseudoscience," the association's president, Denver dentist Brett Kessler, said in a statement.<!-- --></p><p>Many public health groups, including the American Academy of Pediatrics and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, have long supported adding small amounts of fluoride to drinking water. <!-- --></p><p>The US Public Health Service reduced the amount of fluoride it recommended adding to water in 2015, but the federal government has encouraged states since the 1960s to add small amounts of the chemical to water to help prevent cavities and aid oral health.<!-- --></p><p>Recent court rulings have led to the reduction of fluoride in US water, and some experts have questioned the continued need for it in water systems given its wide availability in toothpaste and other dental products.<!-- --></p><p>Most of western Europe does not add fluoride to its water. In England, about one in 10 people has fluoridated drinking water, though a programme has since been introduced to fluoridate water for 1.6 million people in north-east England.<!-- --></p><p>By contrast, around 63% of the US population have fluoridated water.<!-- --></p><p>Experts who support putting fluoride in water says studies show that community water fluoridation prevents at least 25% of tooth decay in children and adults.<!-- --></p><p>"The scientific weight of sound evidence around the benefit of community water fluoridation is clear and compelling," the American Dental Association said in October of last year.<!-- --></p><p>Prof Avijit Banerjee, chair of cariology and operative dentistry at King's College London, previously told the BBC that "the potential harmful effects of fluoride cited have not been associated with the very low levels of fluoride used in water fluoridation programmes".<!-- --></p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="maincontent"><p><span>A</span>t international academic conferences recently, one sees an interesting trend. Some American participants are travelling with <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/712588/what-is-a-burner-phone-and-when-should-you-use-one/" data-link-name="in body link">“burner” phones</a> or have minimalist laptops running browsers and not much else. In other words, they are equipped with the same kind of kit that security-conscious people used to bring 15 years ago when travelling to China.</p><p>So what’s up? Well, these academics have a finger on the pulse of Trump’s America, and are concerned about what might happen when they return home. They’ve read on <a href="https://robertreich.substack.com/p/if-trump-can-disappear-them-he-can" data-link-name="in body link">Robert Reich’s Substack</a> about the French scientist who was prevented from entering the country because US Border Patrol agents had found messages from him in which he had expressed his “personal opinion” to colleagues and friends about Trump’s science policies.</p><p>Or they’ve heard about Dr <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/17/brown-university-rasha-alawieh-deported-lebanon" data-link-name="in body link">Rasha Alawieh</a>, a kidney transplant specialist and professor at Brown University who was trying to return to the US after visiting relatives in Lebanon. She was deported, reports Reich, “despite having a valid visa and a court order” blocking her removal. “Federal authorities alleged that they found ‘sympathetic photos and videos of prominent Hezbollah figures’ in her phone and that she attended the funeral for the leader of Hezbollah in February.”</p><p>And they also know about <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/mar/19/mahmoud-khalil-statement" data-link-name="in body link">Mahmoud Khalil</a>, a Columbia University graduate, whom – though he is a legal permanent resident of the US and has not been charged with a crime – the government is trying to deport because he had participated in pro-Palestinian demonstrations at Columbia.</p><p>Those pro-Gaza demonstrations so irked the Trump regime that it demanded the return of $400m of federal research funding. When Columbia sought a meeting to discuss the matter, it <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/03/14/nyregion/columbia-letter.html" data-link-name="in body link">received a letter</a> setting out the conditions that it would have to accept before the government would deign to talk. These included a stipulation that Columbia must “begin the process of placing the Middle East, South Asian, and African Studies Department under academic receivership for a minimum of five years”.</p><p>The bullying of Columbia is the canary in the coalmine which reveals the Trump-Musk junta has it in for American universities. There are two reasons for their hostility. The first is that, as elite institutions devoted to freedom of inquiry and the telling of uncomfortable truths, they are anathema to the new autocrats in Washington. The second is that some of them (the so-called Ivy League) are fabulously wealthy, being for the most part hedge funds with nice universities attached. And if there’s one thing that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag">Donald Trump</a> cannot abide, it is large pots of money that he and his ghastly tribe can smell but not touch. So if the aloof trustees of Harvard, Princeton, Yale et al think that their august institutions lie beyond his reach, perhaps they should understand that Trump looks on them much as Henry VIII looked on the rich monasteries of his heyday.</p><p>Many teachers and researchers in US universities are now fearful of what lies ahead. No line of inquiry is safe from the raging firestorm of Maga intolerance. Many of the most vulnerable areas of inquiry lie in the health sector – LGBTQ+ medicine, epidemiology, infectious diseases, immunology, and so on. But there’s also endangered research on environmental issues and the climate crisis, socioeconomic inequality, plus the humanities, social science and astrophysics.</p><p>The looming crisis in the US is beginning to remind people in Europe of the 1930s, when the UK and the US began to realise that Jewish scientists needed to be rescued from the Nazis. About 2,000 scientists and academics fled the fascist countries between 1933 and 1941, fearing for themselves or Jewish family members. Then, universities in the US and the UK made space for and welcomed a whole generation of geniuses – Albert Einstein, Enrico Fermi, Leo Szilard, Hans Bethe, Max Born, Rudolf Peierls, Francis Simon, to name just a few. Likewise, members of the Frankfurt School were rescued and installed in New York, where they became <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/sep/09/marxist-critique-capitalism-frankfurt-school-cultural-apocalypse" data-link-name="in body link">mightily critical of American capitalism</a> but at least lived to tell their particular tale. As did Thomas Mann.</p><p>Now, in a different age, there are stirrings in Europe to provide safe places for American researchers. In France, Aix-Marseille University is <a href="https://www.rfi.fr/en/france/20250315-french-university-opens-doors-to-us-scientists-fleeing-trump-s-research-cuts" data-link-name="in body link">welcoming American scientists</a> whose work has become untenable after the Trump administration’s cuts in certain academic sectors. The Free University of Brussels (VUB) is opening 12 postdoctoral positions for international researchers, which are <a href="https://www.ddw-online.com/european-universities-offer-scientific-refuge-to-us-researchers-34143-202503/" data-link-name="in body link">open to American researchers</a> working in socially relevant fields. The fellowships come with substantial funding (€2.5m) as part of the European Marie Skłodowska-Curie programme. It’s also aiming to attract American professors looking to relocate. VUB, with its Francophone sister university ULB, is providing 18 apartments for international researchers seeking temporary residence at the Brussels Institute for Advanced Studies.</p><p>This is the beginning of something hopeful. But it also raises the question of what UK institutions are doing to meet the coming challenge. The answer, at the moment, seems to be nothing much. Perhaps that’s because most of British academia still can’t get its head around the idea that the US is now an enemy, not an ally, and that the “special relationship” is yesterday’s story.</p><h2 id="what-ive-been-reading">What I’ve been reading</h2><p><strong>How I accidentally got sent Trump’s Yemen texts<br></strong>Jeffrey Goldberg’s <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2025/03/trump-administration-accidentally-texted-me-its-war-plans/682151/" data-link-name="in body link">astonishing story</a> about the White House security leak in the <em>Atlantic</em>.</p><p><strong>Philosophy and fatherhood<br></strong><a href="https://crookedtimber.org/2025/03/17/a-curious-tendency-among-western-philosophers/" data-link-name="in body link">A curious tendency among western philosophers</a> explored in an intriguing post by Doug Muir.</p><p><strong>AI has learned to reason … <br></strong>… or has it?

        <h3>Paged Out! Institute Blog</h3>

        <br>

        <h4><a href="#entry-2025-03-29">Paged Out! #6 is out!</a></h4>
        <p>Download Issue #6 on the <a href="https://pagedout.institute/?page=issues.php">Issues page</a>. As always, we have cover-art wallpapers too—this time made by the amazing <a href="https://cara.app/ninjajoart" target="_blank">Ninja Jo (Katerina Belikova)</a>!</p>

        <p>We meet yet again! Writing this blog post is the last thing I do before a new Issue is pushed out. So when I write these words all the work has been done, all the problems have been solved (or put on the "do this when we have time" TODO list), and most of our Institute is already relaxing (i.e. busy with other stuff) and eagerly awaiting the publication. It's also when all the stress related to trying to finalize the Issue goes away and the happiness related to publishing a new issue sets in. So what I'm saying, is that I feel really happy right now to be able to pass Issue #6 into your hands, and really grateful to our team for what they accomplished with this Issue.</p>

        <p>And this Issue is objectively the best Issue up to date! It's a total of 80 pages, with A LOT of absolutely amazing articles and art. Actually one of the delaying factors was that our Menu (Table of Content) script broke again and had to be fixed before pushing the Issue out. It's a good problem to have.</p>

        <p>We still don't have the print files / option to buy a printed edition for you – blame the stupid flu/cold season for this (<i>please insert some swear words you like here</i>). We're close, but I still want to order some test prints myself before we start offering these. </p>

        <p>Another thing which I personally want to develop more in Paged Out!, is sourcing articles from the following genres: technical explanations of game glitches (think: speedrunning or movement techniques), technical demoscene tricks, and technical radio/HAM/etc. If you have any solid leads or contact in these communities, please hit me up at <a href="mailto:gynvael@pagedout.institute">gynvael@pagedout.institute</a>.</p>

        <p>And now, go and enjoy Issue #6! And as usual, the <b>call for articles for Issue #7 is open!</b></p>

        <p><small><i>29 March 2025 / Gynvael</i></small></p><br>


        <!-- ----------------------- -->

        <h4><a href="#entry-2024-11-19">Paged Out! #5 is out!</a></h4>
        <p>Download Issue #5 on the <a href="https://pagedout.institute/?page=issues.php">Issues page</a>. As always, we have cover-art wallpapers too—this time made by the amazing <a href="https://www.markgrahamartist.com/" target="_blank">Mark Graham Artist</a>!</p>

        <p>You know what's the best birthday present a Paged Out! lead can get? A new issue of Paged Out!—hell yeah! And a non-beta build at that. There are countless improvements over #4, including a better menu, <i>a lot</i> of alignment fixes literally everywhere, better support for long titles, and so on. This said, if you spot any problems, please let us know—there are less of them now and, as such, they are harder to find.</p>

        <p>You'll also notice there are a few more Sponsorship Ads this time around. As you might remember, originally we had a policy of having only one ad page per ten content pages. Then the policy changed to round that number up—so for 51 pages, there would be 6 pages of ads. Even with that change, however, we were still in the red with regard to costs. And, as you might also remember, another goal of Paged Out! is to make it self-sustainable (i.e., make it pay its own bills). As such, I made the call to change the ad policy once again and remove the limit altogether. This doesn't mean PO! will be flooded with ads now—I will always try to include the minimum number of ads necessary to ensure PO! isn't in the red (or isn't so much in the red that it becomes a problem). But yes, there are a couple more ads in this issue (9 pages instead of 6 under the old policy).</p>

        <p>The next steps for us are (in somewhat random order): rebuilding previous issues with the new engine (to non-beta ones), getting print-ready PDFs in your hands (we are really close to this), and launching the ability to buy Paged Out! from print-on-demand websites (we’re pretty excited about this one, and some test issues have already been printed).</p>

        <p>And now, go and enjoy Issue #5! And as usual, the <b>call for articles for Issue #6 is open!</b> (and we have actually already received the first submission yestarday – that was fast).</p>

        <p><small><i>19 November 2024 / Gynvael</i></small></p><br>

        <!-- ----------------------- -->

        <h4><a href="#entry-2024-06-01">Paged Out! #4 is out!</a></h4>
        <p>Download Issue #4 on the <a href="https://pagedout.institute/?page=issues.php">Issues page</a>. As always, we have cover-art wallpapers too – this time made by our returning artist from Issue #1 – <a href="https://www.deviantart.com/refiend">ReFiend</a>!</p>

        <p>One thing we're supper happy with is the expansion to new topics – or rather topics we always wanted to have but never got article submissions for. So with Issue #4 we welcome the "Art" category with amazing pixel and digital art, as well as "Demoscene", which is something I was always excited about!</p>

        <p>As usual, this is a Beta1 build, meaning there are some known issues, which we'll slowly work to fix. For example, we know that some links work in some PDFs viewers, but not in other PDF viewers (e.g. KDE Okular seems to have some issues). Our DTP programmer – foxtrot_charlie – mentioned he'll write something about all the headaches of dealing with PDFs, and there are a lot of these. As you know we had a few-day slipup with publication date due to this – sorry about that! Amusingly we had to re-work the cover in the last moment to change as "May" changed into "June" ;).</p>

        <p>Enough said – go and enjoy Issue #4! And... <b>call for articles for Issue #5 is open!</b></p>

        <h4><a href="#entry-2023-12-18">Paged Out! #3 is out!</a></h4>
        <p>Download Issue #3 on the <a href="https://pagedout.institute/?page=issues.php">Issues page</a>. We have cover-art wallpapers too!</p>

        <p>Unbelievable, isn't it? After 4 years of constant delays, issues, problems, pandemics, etc, Paged Out! got successfully resurrected and is on track once again. The majority of credit for this goes to Aga, our editor-in-chief, who made sure things are happening, processes are working, people are pinged, and has done literally all language-layer reviews! Speaking of reviews, kudos to our review team for going through 50+ articles – shout out to: KrzaQ, disconnect3d, Xusheng Li, Hussein Muhaisen, Max, CVS, and honorary_bot! As Paged Out! is an experimental magazine with an abnormal DTP process, I would especially like to thank our DTP team: foxtrot_charlie (who – I'm sure – at this point thinks in LaTeX and PDF processing), tusiak_charlie, and our advisor wiechu. And last but not least, shout out to Dejan "hebi" who has done a lot of tool programming for PO! over the last years! At the same time multiple other people helped with Issue #3 or Paged Out! in general. As such I would like to thank our previous reviewers and programmers – Mateusz "j00ru" Jurczyk and kele – as well as my executive assistant Arashi Coldwind.</p>

        <p>One of the sure things I can say about Paged Out! is that we have wonderful cover artwork. The awesome pixelart in Issue #3 was done by the amazing Ricardo Juchem – checkout his <a href="https://ricardojuchem.com/">website</a> or follow him on <a href="https://twitter.com/RicardoJuchem">Twitter/X</a>. Also, note that next to the Issue there are two version of the cover-art based wallpaper done by Ricardo – time for a new desktop background perhaps? :)</p>

        <p>As you know one of the goals with Paged Out! is to make the zine financially self sufficient. This is where our <a href="https://pagedout.institute/?page=ads.php">sponsors</a> and <a href="https://pagedout.institute/?page=helpout.php">donors</a> come in! As such, special thanks to our amazing sponsors <a href="https://securitum.com/">Securitum</a>, <a href="https://canary.tools/">Thinkst Canary</a>, and <a href="https://guidedhacking.com/">Guided Hacking</a>! And a huge shout out to our donors: celephais, jask, wasp0r, gkelly, madwizard, MrEuds, H Lascelles, and others!</p>

        <p>Anyway, we'll let you enjoy Issue #3 now. Note that what we published today is – as usual – a beta build, so expect the PDF to be replaced from time to time with more and more polished versions (we have a bug list to go through). It will take a few more issues for us to polish our PDF processing enough for this to not be necessary, but we're not there yet. We'll write something more about this in a future blog post :).</p>

        <p>So, enjoy Issue #3 and let your friends know :)</p>

        <p>P.S. Call for articles for Issue #4 is already open! (and we even got some submissions already!)</p>

        <p><small><i>18 December 2023 / Gynvael</i></small></p><br>

        <!-- ----------------------- -->

        <h4><a href="#entry-2023-31-08">It's late 2023. Time to do something about Paged Out!, isn't?</a></h4>
        <p>Almost exactly three years have passed since the last update, and nearly four since the last issue being published. So, what happened? And is this blog entry a glimpse of hope for Issue #3 ever appearing? Or is this just a final entry to sum up the project and officially shut it down?</p>

        <p>Let's start with what happened, as you are owed an explanation.</p>

        <p>After two initial Issues, I (Gynvael) had the idea to make a "Review Center" app, which would make the whole review process easier and more consistent. As expected, it was months of work and the app was turning out pretty good actually. And then the pandemic started and I was affected pretty badly. Long story short, I had to put aside all projects I had (including Paged Out!), step down as the tech lead / manager at work, and focus on my health. This took a while and afterwards I had some catching up to do.</p>

        <p>Fast forward to earlier this year. I left my old job at Google to rest a bit and create my own IT security company. This unlocked some extra time, and this allowed to look in the direction of restarting Paged Out! again. And, given that I had 3 years to think about the project and how to go forward with it, do it right this time.</p>

        <p>Let me start by addressing the biggest change, i.e. <b>Paged Out! is now being managed and operated by HexArcana Cybersecurity GmbH</b> – a company fully owned by me. Note that the keywords here are "managed" and "operated by", i.e. the actual ownership of Paged Out! doesn't actually change. This also does not affect the original goal of Paged Out! being a non-profit self-sustaining magazine, nor the important role volunteers will play in its life. So, for the time being, HexArcana will handle accounting, paperwork, and provide management and publishing services for Paged Out!, which should have a positive impact on the magazine's longevity and overall success. That being said, this is only a temporary measure – eventually, in the next few years and once it achieves self-sustainability, I'll move Paged Out! to its own non-profit organization.</p>

        <p>The second biggest change stems from two simple facts, which took me a bit to realize: I can only do so many things in a day and also I should never be the single point of failure for a project. Thankfully, there's a simple solution for this.</p>

        <p>Without further ado, <b>I would like to officially welcome Aga to the Paged Out! Institute. Aga agreed to help Paged Out! as the Editor-in-Chief</b>, meaning that she'll take over a lot of project management, coordination and editorial work that I have been doing in the past. At the same time, I'm not going anywhere and I will stay with Paged Out! as the overall project lead, publisher, and lead technical editor.</p>

        <p>Continuing on the Institute side, you'll notice a lot of changes on the <a href="https://pagedout.institute/?page=about.php">team page</a> – after a 3-year downtime, this is obviously expected. As such, we would like to thank kele, j00ru, and Arashi for all their help with Paged Out! in the past, and wish them all the best in their continued endeavors! At the same time, foxtrot_charlie, tusiak_charlie, hebi, KrzaQ, and disconnect3d are staying with us in similar roles as before.</p>

        <p>So, what's going to happen next?</p>

        <p>In the next few days, Aga will start contacting folks who expressed interest in helping out with reviewing articles, as well as potential authors. And that's because the <b>call for papers for Issue #3 has been officially re-opened and Paged Out! is considered an active project again!</b></p>

        <p>We would like to thank you for your patience – this has been a long wait for Issue #3, but it will soon be over. For now, consider <a href="https://pagedout.institute/?page=cfp.php">submitting an article</a>, subscribe to us <a href="https://twitter.com/pagedout_zine?lang=en">on Twitter/X</a>, <a href="https://groups.google.com/g/pagedout-notifications">subscribe to our newsletter</a>, or join <a href="https://gynvael.coldwind.pl/discord">Gynvael's Discord</a> for updates on our progress!</p>

        <p>Let's go!</p>

        <p><small><i>31 August 2023 / Gynvael</i></small></p><br>

        <!-- ----------------------- -->

        <h4><a href="#entry-2020_08_08">No, seriously, where is Issue #3?</a></h4>
        <p>There is good news and bad news. Good news is that Issue #3 is under no danger - it will eventually be published, same as Issue #4, #5 and so on. Bad news is that we've run into delays due to stuff related to paged out, and it's had to make predictions on the exact publishing date apart from "this year" - sorry!</p>
        <p>We're basically still finishing the Review Center tool/webapp - this will make work distribution way easier for future issues, so we hope that there will be no such huge delays in the future thanks to this.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, here's a new Review Center related wallpaper by <a href="https://www.deviantart.com/refiend">ReFiend</a>:</p>

<p>Massive Twitter (X) profile data leak exposes details of 2.8 billion users; alleged insider leak surfaces with no official response from the company.</p>



<p>A data leak involving a whopping 2.87 billion <strong><a href="https://hackread.com/twitter-unpredictable-path-elon-musk/" data-type="post" data-id="118242" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Twitter (X)</a></strong> users has surfaced on the infamous Breach Forums. According to a post by a user named ThinkingOne, the leak is the result of a disgruntled X employee who allegedly stole the data during a period of <strong><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/dereksaul/2025/02/05/heres-what-happened-after-elon-musk-cut-80-of-xs-employees-as-he-eyes-reshaping-federal-workforce/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">mass layoffs</a></strong>. If true, this would be the largest social media data leak in history, but surprisingly, neither X nor the broader public appears to be aware of it.</p>



<h3 id="what-we-know-about-the-leak"><strong>What We Know About the Leak</strong></h3>



<p>The original post by ThinkingOne states that the data, around 400GB worth, was likely exfiltrated during messy layoffs at X. The poster claims that they tried contacting X through multiple methods but received no response. </p>



<p>Frustrated with the lack of acknowledgment from X and the general public, they took matters into their own hands and decided to merge the newly leaked data with another infamous <strong><a href="https://hackread.com/twitter-scraping-breach-leak-hacker-forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">breach from January 2023</a></strong>.</p>

<h3 id="the-2023-breach-recap"><strong>The 2023 Breach Recap</strong></h3>



<p>To understand the full scope of what was leaked, looking at the 2023 X data breach that affected around 209 million users is important. That breach exposed:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Email addresses</strong></li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li><strong>Display names and usernames (handles)</strong></li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li><strong>Followers count and account creation dates</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>At the time, <strong><a href="https://hackread.com/twitter-hack-attack-200m-account-leak/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">X downplayed the leak</a></strong>, stating that it consisted of publicly available data. Despite the massive exposure of email addresses, they insisted that no sensitive or private information was involved. However, security experts warned that the combination of emails and public data could enable phishing and identity theft on a large scale.</p>



<h3 id="whats-inside-the-alleged-2025-leak"><strong>What’s Inside the Alleged 2025 Leak?</strong></h3>



<p>The 2025 leak, however, is a completely different beast. Unlike the 2023 leak, it doesn’t contain email addresses, but it does hold a goldmine of profile metadata, including:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Account creation dates</strong>.</li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li><strong>User IDs and screen names</strong>.</li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li><strong>Profile descriptions and URLs</strong>.</li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li><strong>Location and time zone settings</strong>.</li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li><strong>Display names (current and from 2021).</strong></li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li><strong>Followers count from both 2021 and 2025</strong>.</li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li><strong>Tweet count and timestamps of the last tweet</strong>.</li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li><strong>Friends count, listed count, and favorites count</strong>.</li>
</ul>



<ul></ul>



<ul>
<li><strong>Source of the last tweet (such as TweetDeck or X Web App).</strong></li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li><strong>Status settings (like whether the profile is verified or protected)</strong>.</li>
</ul>



<p>The data gives a detailed snapshot of users’ profiles and activity over time, including bios, follower counts from different years, tweet history, and even the app used for the last tweet. But the one thing it doesn’t include is the most sensitive bit: email addresses.</p>

<h3 id="the-data-mashup"><strong>The Data Mashup</strong></h3>



<p>ThinkingOne, a well-known figure on Breach Forums for their skill in analyzing data leaks, decided to combine the 2025 leak with the 2023 one, producing a single 34GB CSV file (9GB compressed) containing 201 million merged entries. To be clear, the merged data only includes users that appeared in both incidents, creating a confusion of public and semi-public data.</p>



<p>This messy combination led many to believe that the 2025 leak also contained email addresses, but that’s not the case. The emails shown in the merged file are from the 2023 breach. The presence of emails in the merged dataset has given the wrong impression that the contents of the 2025 leak also include email addresses.</p>



<h3 id="why-2-8-billion-doesnt-add-up"><strong>Why 2.8 Billion Doesn’t Add Up</strong></h3>



<p>As of Jan 2025, X (formerly Twitter) had around <strong><a href="https://thesocialshepherd.com/blog/twitter-statistics#:~:text=Twitter%20Has%20335.7%20Million%20Users,what%20others%20are%20tweeting%20about." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">335.7 million users</a></strong>, so how is it possible that data from 2.8 billion users has been leaked? One possible explanation is that the dataset includes aggregated or historical data, such as bot accounts that were created and later banned, inactive or deleted accounts that still lingered in historical records, or old data that was merged with newer data, increasing the total number of records.</p>



<p>Additionally, some entries might not even represent real users but could include non-user entities like API accounts, developer bots, deleted or banned profiles that remained logged somewhere, or organization and brand accounts that aren’t tied to individual users. </p>



<p>Another possibility is that the leaked data wasn’t exclusively obtained from Twitter itself but rather scraped from multiple public sources and merged together, including archived data from older leaks or information from third-party services linked to Twitter accounts.</p>



<h3 id="who-is-thinkingone-and-how-did-they-get-the-data"><strong>Who Is ThinkingOne, and How Did They Get the Data?</strong></h3>



<p>One of the biggest mysteries is how ThinkingOne managed to obtain the 2025 leaked data in the first place. Unlike typical hackers, they are not known for breaching systems themselves but are highly regarded for analyzing and interpreting leaked datasets. Whether they received the data from another source or conducted some sophisticated data aggregation is still unclear.</p>



<p>Their theory that a disgruntled employee leaked the data during the layoffs remains unconfirmed, and there’s no concrete evidence to support it; it is only a plausible hypothesis given the timing and internal mess at X.</p>



<h3 id="why-the-silence-from-x"><strong>Why the Silence from X?</strong></h3>



<p>If the claims are true, this is not just a massive data leak in size but also a blow to user privacy. Additionally, whether this was an <strong><a href="https://hackread.com/inside-job-bithumb-crypto-exchange-hacked-again/" data-type="post" data-id="70003" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">inside job</a></strong> or not, users are left with more questions than answers: How much of their data has been <em>“taken”</em>? Who’s behind the leak? And why hasn’t X said anything about it, even after ThinkingOne tried reaching out multiple times?</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://tedium.co/2025/03/29/severance-apple-remote-editing-weirdness/">https://tedium.co/2025/03/29/severance-apple-remote-editing-weirdness/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43517301">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>When it comes to Apple’s TV ambitions, it couldn't buy better marketing than the buzz around <em>Severance</em>. (Certainly beats talking about <a href="https://tedium.co/2025/03/08/apple-amazon-businesses-unfocused/">Apple Intelligence</a>.)</p><p>It is both Apple’s most ambitious and (apologies to <em>Ted Lasso</em>) successful production, expanding the Apple brand by highlighting just how smart it is. At a time when HBO seems to want to be HBO less and less, Apple TV+ has certainly taken up the mantle and then some.</p><p>But it of course raises the question: Do they <em>make</em> Apple‘s shows on Macs? As the second season of <em>Severance</em> ended in dramatic fashion, Apple decided to answer that question, and the answer was … surprisingly confusing.</p>


<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TXNQ01Sy6Xw">In the video Apple released</a>, which highlights the Mac-driven editing process that Ben Stiller's team is using, something stood out to me: Wait, the video is super-jittery—this makes the Mac Mini look rough. What's going on?</p><p>Then, after about 10 minutes of watching, I saw it: The show’s lead editor, Geoffrey Richman, was working on a remote Mac through <a href="https://www.jumpdesktop.com/">Jump Desktop</a>, a screen sharing tool known for its high-speed “fluid remote desktop” feature. I’ve used this tool. Though I’m not really rocking a Mac these days, I’m a fan.</p><p>Here’s the exact moment it hit me, carefully cropped to avoid spoilers:</p><p><img src="https://proxy.tedium.co/nV46Sg1IWq6107qNjwnrTNwMw4s=/740x555/filters:quality(80)/uploads/Severance-Jump-Desktop.jpg" width="740" height="555" loading="lazy" alt="Severance Jump Desktop"></p><p>In other words, little of the horsepower being used in this editing process is actually coming from the Mac Mini on this guy’s desk. Instead, it’s being driven by another Mac on the other side of a speedy internet connection. Given that the Jump Desktop app window was hidden away in an earlier part of the clip, I’m not entirely sure we were supposed to see that, but there it is. Oops.</p><p>(To be fair, the promotional materials <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/03/how-the-mind-splitting-world-of-severance-comes-together-on-mac/">do not hide that this is a remote process</a>, but they do not mention the use of Jump Desktop, which seems like a missed opportunity to promote a small-scale Mac developer. C’mon Apple, do better.)</p><p>So here's a challenge about video production that is unique to the film and television mediums: There is a genuine risk of stuff getting pirated before it's ready. Beyond tethering everyone to NDAs, some of this can be avoided by having the editors work in a centralized place, avoiding networked access to the video files. After all, if an editor goes rogue, you can just take away their key card. There are even standards, <a href="https://www.cdsaonline.org/2019/02/07/cdsa-releases-first-film-and-television-production-security-guidelines">produced by the Content Delivery and Security Association</a>, on how film studios can protect their works mid-edit.</p><p>One problem: COVID-19 made the prior strategy of localizing the editors in the same place untenable.</p></div><div><p>This means that a new normal in the video production realm is the rise of “remote editing,” in which editors use remote access software to do the editing on a virtual machine or office workstation. High speed connections are necessary to make this work on both ends—meaning Starbucks is off the table—but it's more than possible. Jump Desktop is a good option for this, but <a href="https://parsec.app/">Parsec</a> is arguably an even better one.</p><p>This also has other benefits. For one thing, high-end video production is quite storage-intensive, which is why your favorite YouTuber constantly talks about their editing rigs and network-attached storage. By putting this stuff offsite, they can put all this data on a real server.</p><p>To me, though, it highlights a huge issue with Apple’s current professional offerings. They are built to work on a single machine. At least for high-end use cases, the remote workflow threatens to cut them out of the equation entirely, as cloud devices with access to nearly unlimited resources gradually outpace individual machines. In fact, there is a version of the editor he was using, Avid Media Composer, <a href="https://www.avid.com/products/avid-edit-on-demand">that is cloud-based</a> and built specifically for this very use case.</p><p>The astounding part of this editing process, which Apple wanted to highlight so much that they shot an entire film about it, is that the Macs are honestly the least important part of the workflow. If Jump Desktop made a Chromebook version of its app, the Mac on Richman’s desk wouldn't even be necessary. Not that he would want to, but he could do this on a Chromebook.</p><p>Put another way, if Stiller's team was building this for Amazon or Netflix, would that be a Mac Mini on Richman’s desk, or an HP or Lenovo box? Why even use a Mac in this editing process at all, when other companies offer access to better GPUs anyway?</p><p>See, one issue with the way Apple sells its machines at the enterprise level is that they basically have no traditional server offerings, despite that being the norm elsewhere. If you want to run a Mac in the cloud, it has to be a full machine in most cases. Worse, it can’t be split up into a bunch of virtual machines, thanks to requirements in its EULA that seem designed to protect its hardware business above all else.</p><p>At the enterprise or cloud level, where VMs are quite common, this is hugely inefficient. Often large companies will buy the most powerful servers they can and parse them out into smaller pieces. <a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/sla/docs/macOSSequoia.pdf">Apple’s end-user license agreement for MacOS Sequoia</a> specifically limits the upside of such an approach:</p><blockquote><p>Virtualization. For each copy of the Apple Software subject to a lease under this Section 3, either a Lessor or a Lessee (but not both) may install, use and run additional copies or instances of the Apple Software within virtual operating system environments in accordance with Section 2B (iii), provided that a Lessor may only virtualize a single instance or copy of the Apple Software as a provisioning tool for the purpose of providing a Lessee with access to and use of the Apple Software pursuant to this Section 3.</p></blockquote><p>Apple used to serve this market <a href="https://www.macstories.net/mac/a-history-of-the-xserve-apples-one-rack-wonder/">with a device called Xserve</a>, but it essentially gave it up about 15 years ago. Almost unwittingly, this video highlights the folly of that decision, which became more obvious thanks to COVID-19 and the rise of remote work.</p><figure><img src="https://proxy.tedium.co/8QuF9QyuoKI8huma-Aze6jLghvk=/1000x536/filters:quality(80)/uploads/Severance-Mac-Mini.jpg" width="1000" height="536" loading="lazy" alt="Severance Mac Mini"><figcaption>It’s not quite accurate to say that the Mac Mini is just for show, but it’s less necessary for making this setup work than it appears at first glance.</figcaption></figure><p>These editors aren't working on Macs, per se. They're working <em>around</em> them. Sure, there's an Apple logo in the top-left corner (two, actually), but it feels superfluous, knowing that the software isn’t directly on the machine and it just as easily be running on a Windows or Linux box a thousand miles away. There are way more efficient ways to do this, and Apple doesn't offer them. Instead it relies on cloud providers like <a href="https://www.macstadium.com/">MacStadium</a>, or localized IT teams, to work around their convoluted rules around VMs. Meanwhile, Microsoft’s emphasis on VMs, as highlighted by its <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-365/windows-365-enterprise#Solutions">Windows 365 offering</a>, tee them up for a future of scaleable remote editing.</p><p>Hence why this editor is using a remote access tool by a tiny company to help produce Apple’s most important TV show. If I were Apple, I would ask my software team why they've saddled their most significant and influential high-end users with such a weird-ass setup.</p><p>Then I would figure out how to fix it.</p></div><div><h5>Unsevered Links</h5><p><strong>Speaking of Apple,</strong> I agree with <a href="https://reviews.ofb.biz/safari/article/1300.html">this guy</a>.</p><p><strong>It’s hard to find a modern vehicle without a giant infotainment screen</strong> inside of it, but it turns out that the screens are <a href="https://gizmodo.com/are-vehicle-infotainment-screens-headed-for-the-scrap-heap-2000580600">surprisingly unpopular with drivers</a>, per <em>Gizmodo</em>.</p><p><strong>Jesse Welles made his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaNdMAGEsqk">national television debut</a> the other night,</strong> playing for Jimmy Kimmel’s audience.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://github.com/Overv/vramfs">https://github.com/Overv/vramfs</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43517234">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-hpc="true"><article itemprop="text"><p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">vramfs</h2><a id="user-content-vramfs" aria-label="Permalink: vramfs" href="#vramfs"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Unused RAM is wasted RAM, so why not put some of that VRAM in your graphics card
to work?</p>
<p dir="auto">vramfs is a utility that uses the <a href="http://fuse.sourceforge.net/" rel="nofollow">FUSE library</a>
to create a file system in VRAM. The idea is pretty much the same as a ramdisk,
except that it uses the video RAM of a discrete graphics card to store
files. It is not intented for serious use, but it does actually work fairly
well, especially since consumer GPUs with 4GB or more VRAM are now available.</p>
<p dir="auto">On the developer's system, the continuous read performance is ~2.4 GB/s and
write performance 2.0 GB/s, which is about 1/3 of what is achievable with a
ramdisk. That is already decent enough for a device not designed for large data
transfers to the host, but future development should aim to get closer to the
PCI-e bandwidth limits. See the <em>benchmarks</em> section for more info.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Requirements</h4><a id="user-content-requirements" aria-label="Permalink: Requirements" href="#requirements"></a></p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Linux with kernel 2.6+</li>
<li>FUSE development files</li>
<li>A graphics card with support for OpenCL 1.2</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto"><h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Building</h4><a id="user-content-building" aria-label="Permalink: Building" href="#building"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">First, install the OpenCL driver for your graphics card and verify that it's
recognized as an OpenCL device by running <code>clinfo</code>. Then install the <code>libfuse3-dev</code>
package or build it from source. You will also need <code>pkg-config</code> and OpenCL
development files, (<code>opencl-dev</code>, <code>opencl-clhpp-headers</code> package or equivalent),
with version 1.2 of the OpenCL headers at least.</p>
<p dir="auto">Just run <code>make</code> to build <code>vramfs</code>.</p>
<p dir="auto">If you want to debug with valgrind, you should compile with the minimal fake
OpenCL implementation to avoid filling your screen with warnings caused by the
OpenCL driver:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><strong>valgrind:</strong> <code>make DEBUG=1</code></li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto"><h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Mounting</h4><a id="user-content-mounting" aria-label="Permalink: Mounting" href="#mounting"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Mount a disk by running <code>bin/vramfs &lt;mountdir&gt; &lt;size&gt;</code>. The <code>mountdir</code> can be
any empty directory. The <code>size</code> is the disk size in bytes. For more information,
run <code>bin/vramfs</code> without arguments.</p>
<p dir="auto">The recommended maximum size of a vramdisk is 50% of your VRAM. If you go over
that, your driver or system may become unstable because it has to start
swapping. For example, webpages in Chrome will stop rendering properly.</p>
<p dir="auto">If the disk has been inactive for a while, the graphics card will likely lower
its memory clock, which means it'll take a second to get up to speed again.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Implementation</h2><a id="user-content-implementation" aria-label="Permalink: Implementation" href="#implementation"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The FUSE library is used to implement vramfs as a user space file system. This
eases development and makes working with APIs such as OpenCL straightforward.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Basic architecture</h4><a id="user-content-basic-architecture" aria-label="Permalink: Basic architecture" href="#basic-architecture"></a></p>
<p dir="auto"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://camo.githubusercontent.com/bb1717d01d96613b3c2f87f3054383424f4e3cbb00d5d2eed6ee2f19c799e213/687474703a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f653874513136382e706e67"><img src="https://camo.githubusercontent.com/bb1717d01d96613b3c2f87f3054383424f4e3cbb00d5d2eed6ee2f19c799e213/687474703a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f653874513136382e706e67" alt="Architecture overview" data-canonical-src="http://i.imgur.com/e8tQ168.png"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">When the program is started, it checks for an OpenCL capable GPU and attempts to
allocate the specified amount of memory. Once the memory has been allocated, the
root entry object is created and a global reference to it is stored.</p>
<p dir="auto">FUSE then forwards calls like <code>stat</code>, <code>readdir</code> and <code>write</code> to the file system
functions. These will then locate the entry through the root entry using the
specified path. The required operations will then be performed on the entry
object. If the entry is a file object, the operation may lead to OpenCL
<code>cvEnqueueReadBuffer</code> or <code>cvEnqueueWriteBuffer</code> calls to manipulate the data.</p>
<p dir="auto">When a file is created or opened, a <code>file_session</code> object is created to store
the reference to the file object and any other data that is persistent between
an <code>fopen</code> and <code>fclose</code> call.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">VRAM block allocation</h4><a id="user-content-vram-block-allocation" aria-label="Permalink: VRAM block allocation" href="#vram-block-allocation"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">OpenCL is used to allocate blocks of memory on the graphics card by creating
buffer objects. When a new disk is mounted, a pool of <code>disk size / block size</code>
buffers is created and initialised with zeros. That is not just a good practice,
but it's also required with some OpenCL drivers to check if the VRAM required
for the block is actually available. Unfortunately Nvidia cards don't support
OpenCL 1.2, which means the <code>cvEnqueueFillBuffer</code> call has to be simulated by
copying from a preallocated buffer filled with zeros. Somewhat interestingly, it
doesn't seem to make a difference in performance on cards that support both.</p>
<p dir="auto">Writes to blocks are generally asynchronous, whereas reads are synchronous.
Luckily, OpenCL guarantees in-order execution of commands by default, which
means reads of a block will wait for the writes to complete. OpenCL 1.1 is
completely thread safe, so no special care is required when sending commands.</p>
<p dir="auto">Block objects are managed using a <code>shared_ptr</code> so that they can automatically
reinsert themselves into the pool on deconstruction.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">File system</h4><a id="user-content-file-system" aria-label="Permalink: File system" href="#file-system"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The file system is a tree of <code>entry_t</code> objects with members for attributes like
the parent directory, mode and access time. Each type of entry has its own
subclass that derives from it: <code>file_t</code>, <code>dir_t</code> and <code>symlink_t</code>. The main file
that implements all of the FUSE callbacks has a permanent reference to the root
directory entry.</p>
<p dir="auto">The <code>file_t</code> class contains extra <code>write</code>, <code>read</code> and <code>size</code> methods and manages
the blocks to store the file data.</p>
<p dir="auto">The <code>dir_t</code> class has an extra <code>unordered_map</code> that maps names to <code>entry_t</code>
references for quick child lookup using its member function <code>find</code>.</p>
<p dir="auto">Finally, the <code>symlink_t</code> class has an extra <code>target</code> string member that stores
the pointer of the symlink.</p>
<p dir="auto">All of the entry objects are also managed using <code>shared_ptr</code> so that an object
and its data (e.g. file blocks) are automatically deallocated when they're
unlinked and no process holds a file handle to them anymore. This can also be
used to easily implement hard links later on.</p>
<p dir="auto">The classes use getter/setter functions to automatically update the access,
modification and change times at the appropriate moment. For example, calling
the <code>children</code> member function of <code>dir_t</code> changes the access time and change
time of the directory.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Thread safety</h4><a id="user-content-thread-safety" aria-label="Permalink: Thread safety" href="#thread-safety"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Unfortunately most of the operations are not thread safe, so all of the FUSE
callbacks share a mutex to ensure that only one thread is mutating the file
system at a time. The exceptions are <code>read</code> and <code>write</code>, which will temporarily
release the lock while waiting for a read or write to complete.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Benchmarks</h2><a id="user-content-benchmarks" aria-label="Permalink: Benchmarks" href="#benchmarks"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The system used for testing has the following specifications:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><strong>OS:</strong> Ubuntu 14.04.01 LTS (64 bit)</li>
<li><strong>CPU:</strong> Intel Core i5-2500K @ 4.0 Ghz</li>
<li><strong>RAM:</strong> 8GB DDR3-1600</li>
<li><strong>GPU:</strong> AMD R9 290 4GB (Sapphire Tri-X)</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Performance of continuous read, write and write+sync has been measured for
different block allocation sizes by creating a new 2GiB disk for each new size
and reading/writing a 2GiB file.</p>
<p dir="auto">The disk is created using:</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

<p><span id="hs_cos_wrapper_post_body" data-hs-cos-general-type="meta_field" data-hs-cos-type="rich_text"><p>It happened again last week. I was at an architecture review meeting when a fellow architect eagerly started another debate about *microservices*. Within minutes, eyes glazed over and we were knee-deep in an absurd discussion about something that should have been a means to an end, but had morphed into the end itself. At that moment, I realized: I’m done. I’ve finally sworn off talking to architects about microservices. Why? Because these conversations usually go nowhere productive.</p>
<!--more--><p>I’ve boiled my frustration down to three problems:</p>
<ol>
<li>No one agrees on what "microservice" means.</li>
<li>Microservices conversations are abstract, with little tie-in to real business goals</li>
<li>Adopting microservices without changing your organisation is pointless.</li>
</ol>
<h2><span>Problem One: No One Knows What a Microservice Is</span></h2>
<p>This is the most obvious problem. There’s no formal definition of what a microservice is, so when people talk about them, they often end up talking at cross purposes.</p>
<p>Here are some definitions out there:</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">A service with a low number of lines of code:
<ul>
<li aria-level="2">'They are very, very small. I mean 100 lines of code is probably a big service these days.' Fred George, Barcelona Ruby Conference</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li aria-level="1">The<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/executive-insights/content/amazon-two-pizza-team/%C2%A0" rel="noopener" target="_blank"> ‘two-pizza’</a> team
<ul>
<li aria-level="2">Technically not a definition of microservices, but often used as a rule of thumb for the prescribed size of team required for it, and implies that a microservice requires its own team.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li aria-level="1">Requires only one programmer to build and maintain:
<ul>
<li aria-level="2">'If its more than one programmer to develop &amp; design and maintain it, it’s not a microservice' Fred George, GOTO 2016</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li aria-level="1"><a href="https://www.paloaltonetworks.co.uk/cyberpedia/what-are-microservices#:~:text=Each%20service%20is%20autonomous%20and%20self%2Dcontained%20and%20runs%20a%20unique%20process" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Autonomous, self-contained and unique processes</a>
<ul>
<li aria-level="2">'Each service is autonomous and self-contained and runs a unique process.'&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li aria-level="1">A container/pod
<ul>
<li aria-level="2"><a href="https://thinkmicroservices.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">'Each microservice is packaged as a Docker container to enable deployment to a Kubernetes cluster for application orchestration.'</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li aria-level="1">A service with its own data store
<ul>
<li aria-level="2">This was my personal rule of thumb for a long time, and is also implied <a href="https://www.paloaltonetworks.co.uk/cyberpedia/what-are-microservices#:~:text=began%20adopting%20this-,architecture,-" rel="noopener">here</a><br><a href="https://www.paloaltonetworks.co.uk/cyberpedia/what-are-microservices#:~:text=began%20adopting%20this-,architecture,-"><span></span></a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li aria-level="1">‘Independently replaceable and upgradeable’
<ul>
<li aria-level="2"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2AQ9eTZ3-0" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Ian Cooper</a>, after Yourdon, Edward; Constantine, Larry <em>Structured Design</em>, 1975</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li aria-level="2"><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/tastapod_the-idea-of-microservices-having-or-wanting-activity-7304921317139464192-NOLu/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">A 'little computer' that operates on *a model of* the business concepts that are relevant to its operation.</a>&nbsp; Daniel Terhorst-North</li>
</ul>
<p>While some of these overlap significantly with one another, the differences of emphasis combined with the loose way we discuss them, we end up with the <a href="https://www.peacecorps.gov/educators-and-students/educators/resources/blind-men-and-elephant/story-blind-men-and-elephant/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">"blind men and the elephant"</a> scenario: everyone’s correctly describing something slightly differently, so no-one is ‘wrong’, but we’re certainly not aligned.</p>
<p>(I discussed this confusion about what a microservice is <a href="https://blog.container-solutions.com/reflections-on-amazon-prime-videos-monolith-move#:~:text=isn%E2%80%99t%20a%20monolith%E2%80%99.-,The%20Semantics,-At%20this%20point" rel="noopener" target="_blank">here</a> when talking about Amazon Video’s so-called microservices to monolith move.)</p>
<p>After enough of these debates, I’ve found it simpler to ban the term “microservices” altogether. If a term causes this much confusion, maybe it’s outlived its usefulness.</p>
<p>Instead of arguing about what to call our architecture, we could be talking about concrete challenges, or specific trade-offs: how to deploy new features faster, how to reduce coupling, how to scale parts of the system. In other words, microservices (whatever you decide they are) <em>are not an end in themselves, but a by-product of achieving some other goal</em>.</p>
<h3><span>Problem One (b): The Lack of Discipline in Software Terminology</span></h3>
<p>This isn’t just a microservices issue: it’s a broader problem in our industry. We throw around big words that sound impressive but mean wildly different things to different people. Consider these terms, and their histories:</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">DevOps
<ul>
<li aria-level="2">Originally a rejection of the standard separation of development and operation teams, it became perfectly normal to talk about separate and centralised ‘DevOps teams’ centred around deployment tooling</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li aria-level="1">Agile
<ul>
<li aria-level="2">Originally a rejection of software methodologies and behaviours popularly associated with waterfall software development and an embracement of dynamic and context-specific methodologies and behaviours, the term became associated with heavily bureaucratised and ritualised behaviours</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li aria-level="1">SRE
<ul>
<li aria-level="2">Originally a discipline introduced by Google to bring software engineering practices to operations, emphasising reliability, automation, and service-level objectives (SLOs), it morphed into a rebranded operations function, usually without the cultural shift towards automation and shared ownership that it originally advocated</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li aria-level="1">Observability
<ul>
<li aria-level="2">Originally a concept from control theory applied to software systems, focusing on the ability to understand internal states from external outputs, it was embraced by modern infrastructure teams to move beyond traditional monitoring. However, as vendors pushed commercial observability solutions, it became increasingly synonymous with expensive dashboards, metrics overload, and tool sprawl, often obscuring rather than clarifying system health</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Each started with a well-defined intent, but over time they’ve been stretched and contorted to mean whatever the speaker wants to advocate or criticise. With such sloppy definitions, is it any wonder our conversations go in circles?</p>
<p>(As an aside, I’d like to give props to GitOps. This term has been relatively stably used, thanks mainly to a clear original definition (now, sadly, gone from the internet along with the term’s creators, Weaveworks) that was not easily perverted for commercial purposes.)</p>
<h2><span>Problem Two: Microservices Conversations Are Abstract and Unrelated from Business Goals</span></h2>
<p>Closely related to the first problem, discussions about microservices are often detached from any tangible business goals. If you ask "What business problem are we actually solving?" you’re often met with vague responses like:</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">Microservices improve scalability. (Scalability of what? Where is the current bottleneck?)</li>
<li aria-level="1">Microservices make teams more agile. (How? Are deployments slow because of the architecture, or are they slow because of process constraints?)</li>
<li aria-level="1">Microservices allow independent deployments. (Is that actually a requirement for your team, or just a nice-to-have?)</li>
<li aria-level="1">Microservices reduce cognitive load. (For whom? Do they really, or are we just moving complexity around?)</li>
</ul>
<p>If you listen closely, many of these conversations about microservices are not actually about architecture, but about wanting to work for a different company, where technology is cutting-edge and problems are theoretically interesting, rather than legacy-ridden and constrained by real-world trade-offs.</p>
<p>The sad reality is that many teams embarking on a microservices migration would be better off staying with a well-structured monolith until their scaling needs genuinely demand a different approach. Sam Newman, author of Building Microservices, frequently warns that most organizations should not start with microservices unless they have a compelling reason.</p>
<p>Again, it would be far better to stop talking about microservices. Start talking about reducing cycle time, improving reliability, and solving concrete business bottlenecks. If breaking up a system into smaller services is the best way to achieve those outcomes, fine, but angels on a pinhead discussions among architects about microservices are not the way to get there.</p>
<h2><span>Problem Three: Microservices Without Organizational Change Is Pointless</span></h2>
<p>Another critical consequence of engineers discussing microservices in isolation from the business context is that they more often than not ignore the organisational changes required to make microservices work.</p>
<p>Microservices don’t work in a vacuum. They require teams to be structured in a way that supports them. That means:</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">Cross-functional, autonomous teams that own services end-to-end. If teams still depend on centralised bottlenecks (e.g., a single DBA team), microservices won’t deliver the promised benefits</li>
<li aria-level="1">Decentralized decision-making to avoid coordination overhead. If releases still require lengthy approval processes, the independence of services is an illusion</li>
<li aria-level="1">A mature DevOps culture with CI/CD, monitoring, and incident management practices that can handle the complexity of distributed systems</li>
</ul>
<p>If your organisation isn’t willing to make these changes, microservices will only make things worse. Adding technical complexity while keeping all the old organizational inefficiencies. In short, tech should follow business needs, not the other way around.</p>
<p>Most people that discuss microservices either don’t appreciate this, or don’t appreciate how hard this is. Changing your organisational structure is <em>far</em> harder than changing your software architecture when your business is over a trivial size. This is why small startups can ‘pivot’, and change their software architecture so quickly: their organisation structure can be changed as soon as everyone agrees on the architectural changes.</p>
<h2><span>The Next Time Someone Mentions Microservices…</span></h2>
<p>I’m well aware of the irony here: I’ve talked about how I’m not talking about microservices anymore. And with that, I'll shut up, and never speak of it again.</p>
</span>

<p dir="auto">Chess is boring. I'm boring too so I enjoy it anyways, but I can't help but think "I could design it better." Normally in chess players move sequentially in turns, but this introduces a huge latency bug that the developers of chess forgot to patch: you spend literally half the time waiting for your opponent!</p>
<p dir="auto">The obvious solution is just get rid of the concept of turns in chess altogether and let players move whenever they want. Real time strategy games like StarCraft and Age of Empires are much more fun and spectator friendly than chess, so this should be a pretty uncontroversial minor rules update that can be implemented before the next world championship. To prevent things from getting too chaotic over the board each piece has an individual cooldown, so once it's been moved it can't move for a fixed period afterwards.</p>
<p dir="auto">However there's an unfortunate roadblock to the widespread adoption of real time chess: as the <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/09/26/sport/hans-niemann-denies-sex-toys-cheating-chess-spt-intl/index.html" rel="nofollow">Niemann controversy</a> has made all too clear, chess is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNuu8KTUEwU" rel="nofollow">not immune</a> from accusations of cheating through spectator <strong>ass</strong>istance or outside <strong>anal</strong>isys tools. Trying to have players self enforce these piece cooldowns is impossible. However where the intrinsic goodness of the human psyche fails, engineering is always ready to step in. This project is a physical chess board that keeps track and displays the cooldown remaining for each piece, and even physically holds them in place so no accidental cheating can occur.</p>

<li>Power distribution: Traces on the pcbs are way undersized given there are many amps running through them, so there are large voltage drops when many pieces are on cooldown simultaneously. To solve this these traces should be much wider</li>
<li>Tolerances: The pcbs have extremely tight tolerances which makes assmbling the board extremely annoying. The edges and holes should probably have more room</li>
<li>Pin heights: The height of the pins for the banana connectors are taller than the mechanical design allows for, these are fairly easy to shorten using a dremel but probably something that should be fixed</li>
<li>Corner screws: Given the order of assembly, it's impossible to insert/fasten the 4 corner screws</li>

<p dir="auto">I love trying out different productivity techniques - some say that the quest to optimize your productivity is the ultimate procrastination method, so maybe that is what drove me to this project. I also have a habit of committing time (around a month of work outside my normal job) once a year to a project that benefits someone else. Last year, I bought a 3D printer (BambuLab X1C) and wanted to put it to good use. I have previously finished an apprenticeship as an electronics
engineer before pivoting to software engineering, so I also wanted to come back to my roots and build something physical.
My friend struggles with time management throughout the day sometimes - lots of different tasks to organize, and little focus. So I thought to myself: Why not make them a pomodoro timer? So, I set out with a few goals:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>It should be a physical device</li>
<li>It should be <em>fun</em></li>
<li>It should be intuitive to use</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">There are some cool projects out there (arguably much cooler than this, for example the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZa-Vqu-_fU" rel="nofollow">Focus Dial by Salim Benbouziyane</a>), but I wanted to build something from scratch. I also
never built something with an ePaper display and thought it might be a good fit for something that is mostly idling and doesn't require a backlight.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Why these parts?</h3><a id="user-content-why-these-parts" aria-label="Permalink: Why these parts?" href="#why-these-parts"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">This was my second dive back into building things with microcontrollers in a long time. I knew ESP32 well enough to feel comfortable diving back in, so that was the main choice here. I did some research before to see what kinds of displays would be supported.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">ePaper Display</h4><a id="user-content-epaper-display" aria-label="Permalink: ePaper Display" href="#epaper-display"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">I needed some sort of display, or at least I <em>wanted</em> some sort of display. One of the main motivations for this project was that it should be out of your way - until it is time to finish your current focus and move on. For me, this meant that I wanted a display without any backlight.</p>
<p dir="auto">The display should also be large enough that you can put the whole device somewhere on your desk and still be able to read it. After ordering and playing around with a few WaveShare ePaper displays, I settled on the 4.26" variant for multiple reasons:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Great resolution (which seems to be really hard to find for "hobbyist" displays)</li>
<li>The size felt right</li>
<li>The display supports partial refreshes (0.3s, no distracting "black and white flashes" while refreshing)</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Initially, I really wanted to use a black/white/red display and found one that I liked, but the refresh time
was a whopping 16 seconds with no support for partial refreshes which was a dealbreaker for me.</p>
<p dir="auto">The final bonus feature: it won't work at night. If your desk is not bright enough, you won't be able to read the display. This is a feature, not a bug. Too dark outside? Stop working already!</p>
<p dir="auto"><h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Rotary Encoder</h4><a id="user-content-rotary-encoder" aria-label="Permalink: Rotary Encoder" href="#rotary-encoder"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">From the start, I knew that I wanted some sort of dial as an input - it made the most sense to me. This came at the cost of some complexity when designing the menus, and you really need to make sure that you debounce the input correctly. I also added .1uF capacitors to the CLK and DT pins to help with smoothing out the signal.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">LED</h4><a id="user-content-led" aria-label="Permalink: LED" href="#led"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">In the first few iterations, there was no plan for an LED. My genius plan of having a display without backlight came at a cost: it could be <em>too</em> subtle when your current focus time ended. I experimented with a few different ideas:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>A buzzer: this would just make you jump. A truly horrible experience</li>
<li>Speakers: I don't know why, but speakers felt <em>hard</em>. So much noise and whining with the setup I tried, but I will blame this on a skill issue</li>
<li>LED: I had some WS2812 LEDs lying around and thought they might be a good fit. You can animate them with the NeoPixel library, and they are really easy to use. The additional benefit of not needing to commit many more output pins was also a big plus</li>
</ul>

<p dir="auto">The LED ended up working great, allowing me to display different states. It might be subtle, but I also added a little shroud to the case and added a diffusion layer in front of the LED to make it look nicer.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Building the Case</h3><a id="user-content-building-the-case" aria-label="Permalink: Building the Case" href="#building-the-case"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The case comes in two parts: the base and a lid. One unfortunate design choice I made is that the display frame is printed as one piece as part of the base, so the top edge tends to warp a little bit during printing. Since CAD (or product design) isn't my strongest suit, there will certainly be better choices to design this for a better final look.</p>
<p dir="auto">One thing that I wished I learned earlier is that it might not have been the best idea to put the dial in the front: because the print and electronics are so lightweight, pressing the switch on the dial will tend to just slide the whole device back. Luckily, I could solve this by adding some rubber feet and weights (the ones usually used to balance tires) to the bottom of the case. This worked out great, and I am happy with how it turned out.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Software</h3><a id="user-content-software" aria-label="Permalink: Software" href="#software"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The software is written in C++ and uses the Arduino framework. I used PlatformIO to manage the project (at least that is what seemed to be a popular choice, but I am not so sure about that anymore). This project relies heavily
on the GxEPD2 library for the display. I won't lie, the code in this repository is a bit of a mess - I had to get things done in time, which led to quite a bit of copy and pasting and not revisiting earlier parts of the code.
Some parts were generated by AI (Claude, for the most part) to help me finish the project in the deadline I set myself.</p>

<p dir="auto">Since this was a project for my friend, I also wanted to include some easter eggs and fun. You would think that adding some random facts <em>while you are supposed to be focused</em> would be a bad idea, but I think it is a fun little addition.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Using the Device</h2><a id="user-content-using-the-device" aria-label="Permalink: Using the Device" href="#using-the-device"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">When the device starts up, you can either change some settings or go into preset selection mode. From there, you can choose one of three presets:</p>
<p dir="auto"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/Rukenshia/pomodoro/blob/main/docs/select_preset.jpg"><img src="https://github.com/Rukenshia/pomodoro/raw/main/docs/select_preset.jpg" alt="preset selection"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The timer will then start and let you know once the time is up (by flashing the LED and displaying a message on the screen). You can keep working (not recommended, but necessary if you want to finish something) and then start the break.</p>
<p dir="auto"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/Rukenshia/pomodoro/blob/main/docs/timer_running.jpg"><img src="https://github.com/Rukenshia/pomodoro/raw/main/docs/timer_running.jpg" alt="timer running"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">During the pause, you can view some statistics. Every few iterations (4 by default), your pause will be longer to give you some time to recover.</p>
