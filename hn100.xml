MobileOps is a bootstrapped and profitable software company that sells SaaS ("MobileOps") to companies that own fleets of workboats or heavy construction assets. We have a vertically integrated app that serves as a one-stop shop for companies when it comes to asset maintenance, safety/compliance, crewing, dispatching, logistics, inventory, and much more.</p><p>We've just begun to release new sets of features that focus on logistics for workboat companies that tow barges in the inland rivers of the USA (imagine 100k+ barges being pushed by towboats in rivers that carve through the American heartland, and all the major complexities that comes with tracking barges w/ cargo, optimizing schedules and tows, and generating invoices based off many movements and types of events).</p><p>In addition, we've started to attract attention outside the maritime world, and we're excited about new opportunities to bring MobileOps to similar industries.</p><p>[ Role ] 
We're looking for a highly motivated individual with 5+ years of professional software engineering experience—one who takes ownership of projects, has an eye for great UI/UX, and gets quality work completed on time (understanding, at a deep level, perfection v.s. shipping). The role will require collaboration with colleagues and customers to ensure we're building the right features and providing value. If you're an individual that doesn't want to be siloed and desires to engage with customers on Zoom calls (and even occasional onsite visits with other team members) this might be a good role for you.</p><p>MobileOps is a remote-first company with team members currently located in Washington and California. Work hours are in the Pacific time zone. Full time = 40 hours a week. We offer benefits (health, vision, dental) and 401(k) matching.</p><p>[ Stack ]
MobileOps' BE is Ruby on Rails and the FE is almost 100% React components. While the frameworks are fairly standard, the problems we need to solve are quite out of the ordinary due to the nature of industry we serve, and there's a lot of challenging and unique problems to be solved outside of basic CRUD interfaces.</p><p>If you’re interested you can email: jobs@ company domain. Please paste your CV (no attachments) and provide some information about yourself and work experience. Feel free to ask questions as well.</p></div></td></tr>

  <p>Humans and other animals encounter and remember countless experiences each day; when we sleep, groups of cells in the brain known as neuronal ensembles replay these experiences to consolidate them into memories and “preplay” futures ones, which enables faster encoding of new experiences into memories later on.</p>
<p>Better understanding how these neuronal ensembles represent, or depict, these experiences would offer important insights into how memory and the mind function. But most studies to date have focused solely on animals undergoing just one or a small handful of sequential experiences — and it remains unclear how exactly the brain is able to process numerous experiences simultaneously during sleep.</p>
<p>In a new study, Yale scientists revealed a generative coding capacity in the brain’s hippocampus — an area responsible for memory and learning — which enables the brain to bundle together the representations of some 15 unrelated experiences that occurred across one full day within single sub-second events, known as frames, during sleep.</p>
<p>This computer-like capacity for parallel processing of different chains of information helps explain why humans and other animals are able to process a cascade of experiences and either keep separate or combine their meanings.</p>
<p>The findings were <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-024-01703-6">published in the journal Nature Neuroscience</a>.</p>
<p><span>“</span>The brain mechanisms we uncovered are relevant for how we form and express internally generated representations about the world, like memories, imagining, and insight,” said <a href="https://medicine.yale.edu/profile/george-dragoi/">George Dragoi</a>, an associate professor of psychiatry and of neuroscience at Yale School of Medicine and corresponding author of the study.</p>
<p>An increasing amount of neuroscience research is exploring how neuronal ensembles represent experiences in the brain, a complex process that has implications for learning and memory, cognitive mapping, and spatial navigation. The fact that most studies involve animals undergoing a single experience, however, has prevented researchers from assembling a more complete picture.</p>
<p><span>“</span>In real life we are continuously experiencing new contexts and events that all need to be encoded distinctly and remembered later without a major interference between them,” Dragoi said. “The way the brain solves this problem is not known and experiments attempting to address this topic are essentially missing.</p>
<p><span>“</span>Computational models have proposed that exposure to multiple experiences would lead to a ‘catastrophic interference’ between the brain representations of new and older experiences, causing the individual to forget the latter,” Dragoi said. “That, of course, is not how daily life works.”</p>
<p>For the new study, the researchers recorded the activity of hippocampal neurons in rats that were allowed to move freely through 15 different spatial contexts over 19 ½ hours, a time span that included periods of extended sleep, during a single day. (The periods of sleep were used to investigate “offline” activity in the animals’ brains, in terms of preplay and replay of experiences.)</p>
<p>Using innovative data analysis, they identified several coding schemes in the hippocampus that boost its network capacity and efficiency during sleep and allow the brain to process representations of several experiences without interference.</p>
<p>Specifically, they found that the brain is able to “flicker” between time-compressed representations from two or more distinct experiences within the same sleep preplay and replay events, a feature that greatly increases network capacity for parallel information processing without interference during sleep. In addition, independent experiences can be bound together into longer preplay/replay episodes representing sequential aspects of day-long experiences in the order in which they occurred compressed into replay episodes less than a second in duration.</p>
<p>The researchers also identified a kind of serial position effect in this process, whereby the first and most recent experiences had the strongest representations during the animals’ sleep, a phenomenon similar to the effect observed in human memory in which people tend to recall the first and last events in a series of events or items.</p>
<p>Other authors of the paper are Kefei Liu and Jeremie Sibille, a former associate research scientist and postdoctoral associate, respectively, in Dragoi’s lab at Yale School of Medicine.</p>

<h2 id="they-dont-make-em-like-that-any-more-the-3.5mm-headphone-jack-socket">They
don’t make ’em like that any more: the 3.5mm headphone jack socket</h2>
<p><img src="https://kevinboone.me/img/plug.png"></p>
<blockquote>
<p>“It it ain’t broke, replace it with something that is.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>About five years ago I was suddenly, unexpectedly taken ill.&nbsp;Not just
‘that’s a bit nasty’ ill, but ‘prepare for the worst’ ill.&nbsp;One thing
that kept my spirits up in hospital, in the long watches of the night,
was listening to comedy shows and audiobooks. I used my smartphone for
this, since I had it with me, and a pair of old, wired headphones that I
just had time to grab on my way to the ambulance.</p>
<p>I survived, of course, as evidenced by my continued ramblings on this
site. But it was an unpleasant experience, made just a little better by
a simple piece of technology: the 3.5mm headphone jack.</p>
<p>Now, of course, I do own wireless headphones and earbuds – I think
almost everybody does. I also own several of those irritating USB
dongles, that provide a 3.5mm port for devices that don’t have one. But
here’s the problem: I can’t use my Bluetooth earbuds while they’re
charging. And I can’t easily charge my phone whilst it’s connected to
the USB dongle. In a critical-care facility, it’s hard enough to find
one free mains socket to connect a charger to, let alone two.</p>
<p>In the debate about the benefits of wired and wireless headphones, I
doubt anybody is thinking “What if I get sick?” It certainly wasn’t
something I was thinking, either, until I actually did. Still, that
experience made me think about all the advantages of having a headphone
jack, some of which I’d thought about before, and some I hadn’t.</p>
<ul>
<li>Sound quality is better. Maybe that won’t always be the case, but it
is now. All decent headphones have an analog jack.</li>
<li>Almost any headphone or earphone will work with almost anything with
a standard jack socket. That isn’t the case for USB dongles. Maybe that
won’t always be the case, but it is now.</li>
<li>I can use the headphone jack to connect my phone or tablet to an
amplifier, should the need arise. For certain headphones, that need
<em>does</em> arise.</li>
<li>I can charge my phone whilst listening to music, which I do all
day.</li>
<li>I don’t have to carry around a stupid dongle, which I will
invariably lose.</li>
<li>Ordinary wired earbuds can be small enough to wear whilst sleeping.
I’ve never seen Bluetooth earbuds that are.</li>
</ul>
<p>The headphone jack is a “just works” kind of technology: there’s
nothing complicated about it, and its not encumbered by patents, so
anybody can make compatible equipment.</p>
<p>So, although “What if I get sick?” probably isn’t at the top of the
list of questions that will guide your buying decision, we have to
wonder what other things we lose, by replacing a well-established,
robust technology with a complicated, flaky one.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the <em>advantages</em> of doing away with the
headphone jack are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your cellphone is about ten pence cheaper.</li>
<li>Er… that’s it.</li>
</ul>
<p>What makes the loss of the headphone jack so hard to bear is that
<em>it wasn’t done for the consumer’s benefit</em>. To be sure,
manufacturers made certain claims about the alleged benefits of losing
the jack, but few of them stand up to much logical scrutiny.</p>
<p>The first manufacturer to make a point of dropping the headphone jack
(I believe) was not Apple – as is commonly believed – but Oppo, and back
in 2014. Their reason for doing so was at least a credible technical
one: they said it made their phones about half a millimetre thinner.
Maybe that was a selling point, maybe it wasn’t. But Apple couldn’t fall
back even on this claim, because people found ways to fit a 3.5mm jack
socket into the iPhones that lacked one, and even posted videos on
Youtube showing how they did it. It wasn’t easy, but it was clearly
<em>possible</em>. If Apple genuinely thought that omitting the jack
would leave more room for other features, they didn’t actually provide
any.</p>
<p>It’s notable that a number of companies mocked Apple’s decision to
drop the headphone jack, before quietly doing the same themselves:
Samsung and Google in particular. Samsung even cynically tried to
withdraw all the advertising in which they had mocked Apple. Of course,
nothing is ever really gone on the Internet, so we can continue to
marvel at Samsung’s barefaced duplicity.</p>
<p>Some manufacturers claimed that the presence of the headphone jack
made it difficult to keep their phones waterproof; but there’s a whole
range of good-quality phones from around 2019-2020 that are waterproof
to a reasonable degree, without sacrificing the jack.</p>
<p>No.&nbsp;All of these weak excuses are simply distractions from the
<em>real</em> reason Apple, Samsung, and Google dropped the headphone
jack: they all have a substantial investment in the manufacture of
wireless headphones.</p>
<p>Apple owns Beats – this was a multi-billion dollar investment, in a
company that manufactures Bluetooth headphones.</p>
<p>Samsung owns Harmon, which is know for the Harmon-Kardon and JBL
audio brands. Again, these were multi-billion dollar acquisitions for
Samsung, in companies with a strong interest in wireless audio.</p>
<p>Google owns Synaptics, Dysonics, RevX, and Tempow, all of which are
active in the development of wireless audio. Google also hired Peter Liu
from Bose, who was one of the original developers of the Bluetooth Low
Energy specification.</p>
<p>It is very much in the interest of companies like Apple, Samsung, and
Google to encourage their customers to buy into wireless Bluetooth
headphones. Or, better yet, to force them to do so, by taking away the
means to do anything else. After all, their executives have to justify
the billions of dollars they’ve spent, acquiring suppliers and
developers of wireless audio equipment.</p>
<p>The 3.5mm headphone jack has almost nothing to recommend it,
technically speaking. It was criticized by hi-fi enthusiasts almost from
its inception. The only things it has going for it are its simplicity,
and the fact that everybody uses it. Well, everybody outside the world
of mobile gadgets, anyway. This simplicity and ubiquity is a great
benefit to consumers, which is why Apple, et al., don’t want to provide
it – they have nothing to gain if consumers spend less money on their
products.</p>
<p>The loss of the headphone jack would have hurt even if there were
good technical reasons for it. As it turns out, there are none – it’s
just another cynical way for big businesses to gouge consumers. A side
effect of their strategy is that wired headphones themselves are
becoming less available, as cellphone users were until recently major
purchasers of these devices. It’s not difficult to get top-quality
headphones with a jack – they all have one; but there are fewer and
fewer mid-priced wired earbuds on the market.</p>
<p>The way to discourage companies behaving this way is for us all to
take our business elsewhere. It’s still possible to get decent
cellphones from Motorola, Asus, and Sony that retain the 3.5mm jack. I
don’t believe that anything recent from Apple, Samsung, or Google has
one, for reasons I explained earlier. Still, there are older cellphone
models from these suppliers that do have a jack, and which are still
good phones. I own the Samsung S10+, S10e, and Note 9, for example.
They’re a few years old, but they still do everything I want and
more.</p>
<p>If you’re a fan of the 3.5mm jack, it’s time to vote with your
wallet.</p>

<p dir="auto">Additionally you can use <a href="https://github.com/joncampbell123/dosbox-x/releases">DOSBox-X</a> which emulates a Voodoo 1 card. Glide functions can be found in the 3dfx-module in the documentation, Javascript support functions have a "FX" prefix, all native functions are prefixed with "fx". Detailed Glide3-API documentation can be found on the internet, e.g. on <a href="http://falconfly.3dfx.pl/reference.htm" rel="nofollow">FalconFly Central</a>. <strong>Make sure you grab the Glide3 SDK and not Glide2!</strong></p>
<p dir="auto">You can use the included DOS version of <code>TEXUS.EXE</code> to convert bitmaps to <code>3df</code> texture files that can be loaded as textures.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>!!! Attention !!!</strong>
3dfx/Glide3 support ONLY works in plain DOS, NOT in the DOS/command window of Windows 9x! Be sure to always boot into a pure DOS prompt before trying to use any of the fx-functions!
Before using 3dfx/Glide3 support you need to copy the appropriate <code>GLIDE3X.DXE</code> into the same directory as <code>DOJS.EXE</code>. You can do so by using the <code>V_XXX.BAT</code> scripts in the distribution ZIP archive.</p>

<code>make distclean</code> will clean dependencies as well. <code>make zip</code> will create the distribution ZIP and <code>make doc</code> will re-create the HTML help.</p>

<p dir="auto">DOjS comes pre-bundled with all fonts included with GRX (files ending with ".FNT"). If you want/need additional fonts you can find a very simple tool to convert TTF/BDF fonts to GRX format <a href="https://github.com/SuperIlu/GrxFntConv">here</a>. Results may vary...
A minimal version capable of converting BDF fonts to FNT is included with DOjS (<code>FONTCONV.EXE</code>).

You need to start <code>DOjS -r examples/websvr.js</code> and then set the IP address in VSCode using the command <code>DOjS: Set hostname</code>. Live coding sketches must look like below to work:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="// livedojs

<p dir="auto">Scripts, as well as resources can either be stored in the file system or in ZIP files. To load data from a zip file the format is <code>&lt;ZIP filename&gt;=&lt;ZIP entry name&gt;</code> (e.g. <code>data.zip=mypic.bmp</code>). DOjS can be started with a script, a script in a ZIP file or no parameters. If the script was loaded from a ZIP file the running script can obtain resources from the same ZIP file by using <code>ZipPrefix()</code> to obtain paths refering to that ZIP. If the script was not started from a ZIP <code>ZipPrefix()</code> just passes through the file name (thus loading the file from HDD). If no arameters are supplied DOjS will first try to load <code>&lt;name of the EXE&gt;.ZIP=MAIN.JS</code> and then <code>JSBOOT.ZIP=MAIN.JS</code>.
Examples:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><code>DOJS.EXE -r script.js</code> will start <code>script.js</code> from the HDD, <code>ZipPrefix("pic.bmp")</code> will yield <code>pic.bmp</code>.</li>
<li><code>DOJS.EXE -r data.zip=script.js</code> will start <code>script.js</code> from the ZIP file <code>data.zip</code>, <code>ZipPrefix("pic.bmp")</code> will yield <code>data.zip=pic.bmp</code>.</li>
<li><code>HURTZ.EXE</code> DOjS was renamed to <code>HURTZ.EXE</code>. It will start <code>MAIN.JS</code> from the ZIP file <code>HURTZ.ZIP</code>, <code>ZipPrefix("pic.bmp")</code> will yield <code>HURTZ.ZIP=pic.bmp</code>.</li>
<li><code>DOJS.EXE</code> The script was added to <code>JSBOOT.ZIP</code>. DOjS will start <code>MAIN.JS</code> from the ZIP file <code>JSBOOT.ZIP</code>, <code>ZipPrefix("pic.bmp")</code> will yield <code>JSBOOT.ZIP=pic.bmp</code>.</li>

  <h2>Upgrading a Toshiba NAS HDD firmware on Linux</h2>
  <p><span>28 Aug 2024</span></p><h2 id="tldr">TL;DR</h2>

<p>I reversed the firmware updater of my Toshiba HDD to be able to update it on Linux.
The following commands <strong>should</strong> work, <strong>USE AT YOUR OWN RISK</strong>:</p>

<div><pre><code>$ wget https://www.canvio.jp/en/support/download/hdd/ot_ihdd/fw/ISFw.dat
$ grep -C2 MODELNAME ISFw.dat
 # ^
 #&nbsp;|___ identify the right filename here
$ wget https://www.canvio.jp/en/support/download/hdd/ot_ihdd/fw/sk060202.ftd
# hdparm --fwdownload-mode3 sk060202.ftd /dev/sdX
</code></pre></div>

<h2 id="context">Context</h2>

<p>I bought a Toshiba HDWG480 HDD for my NAS. <code>hdparm -I /dev/XXX</code> gives the following output:</p>

<div><pre><code>ATA device, with non-removable media
        Model Number:       TOSHIBA HDWG480
        Serial Number:      3430A00RFR0H
        Firmware Revision:  0601
        Transport:          Serial, ATA8-AST, SATA 1.0a, SATA II Extensions, SATA Rev 2.5, SATA Rev 2.6, SATA Rev 3.0
Standards:

        Supported: 10 9 8 7 6 5
        Likely used: 10
[...]
</code></pre></div>

<p>As usual, I wanted to check if any firmware update is available. Toshiba’s <a href="https://www.canvio.jp/en/support/download/hdd/ot_ihdd/fw/en.htm">dedicated webpage</a> lists version <code>0602</code> as available for my model.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, as expected, there’s no firmware update process provided for Linux users, only an “Internal Storage Firmware Update Utility” is provided for Windows.</p>

<p>Update files are not provided either.</p>

<h3 id="goals">Goals</h3>

<p>So, our goals are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>understand where the updater gets its update files from</li>
  <li>reverse engineer the flashing process itself to reimplement it on Linux</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="reversing-the-windows-updater">Reversing the Windows Updater</h2>

<h3 id="intro">Intro</h3>

<p>Running the <a href="https://www.canvio.jp/en/support/download/hdd/ot_ihdd/fw/exe/InternalStorageFwUpdateUtility_1.20.0410.exe">installer</a><sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> with Wine works perfectly, resulting in the following files being installed under <code>Program Files (x86)</code>:</p>

<div><pre><code>  18312 ISFw.exe:        PE32 executable (native) Intel 80386, for MS Windows, 4 sections
2434952 TosISFw.exe:     PE32 executable (GUI) Intel 80386, for MS Windows, 5 sections
2172296 TosISFwSvc.exe:  PE32 executable (GUI) Intel 80386, for MS Windows, 5 sections
2362248 TosISFwTray.exe: PE32 executable (GUI) Intel 80386, for MS Windows, 5 sections
</code></pre></div>

<p>A quick look (filename, imports) hints at the following goals for each program:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>ISFW.exe</code> is a driver (<code>DriverEntry</code> export), probably in charge of effectively flashing the update.</li>
  <li><code>TosISFw.exe</code> is the GUI</li>
  <li><code>TosISFwSvc.exe</code> is the userland service (as the service related imports show)</li>
  <li><code>TosISFwTray.exe</code> most probably handles a tray icon</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="finding-the-update-files">Finding the update files</h3>

<p>The obvious move is too grep for URLs in the various installed binaries. Unfortunately, it leads nowhere apart from URLs related to the digital signatures. However, grepping for <code>HttpOpenRequest</code>, an API often used by Windows programs to download files, gives two results: <code>TosISFw.exe</code> and <code>TosISFwSvc.exe</code>.</p>

<p>Let’s look at <code>TosISFwSvc.exe</code> which is smaller and let’s see if we can find the URL by checking the xrefs.</p>

<p>The call is in the function at 0x00401040, and looks like this:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>v15</span> <span>=</span> <span>HttpOpenRequestW</span><span>(</span><span>v14</span><span>,</span> <span>L"GET"</span><span>,</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>v36</span><span>[(</span><span>_DWORD</span><span>)</span><span>lpBuffer</span><span>],</span> <span>0</span><span>,</span> <span>(</span><span>LPCWSTR</span><span>)</span><span>szReferrer</span><span>,</span> <span>0</span><span>,</span> <span>0x84000000</span><span>,</span> <span>0</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>the function is obviously a “download” helper, as all the API calls show. Let’s rename it <code>dlfile</code>. There are only two Xrefs to dlfile:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>if</span> <span>(</span> <span>!</span><span>RegOpenKeyExW</span><span>(</span>

</code></pre></div>

<p>The first one gives us our answer: the URL is stored in the registry. It’s actually written by the InstallShield setup.</p>

<p><a href="https://syscall.eu/blog/public/toshiba/regedit.png"><img src="https://syscall.eu/blog/public/toshiba/regedit.png" alt="disk"></a></p>

<p>The value is <code>http://www.canvio.jp/en/support/download/hdd/ot_ihdd/fw/ISFw.dat</code></p>

<h3 id="parsing-the-update-file">Parsing the update file</h3>

<p>The file is an ini file, which is trivial to read and parse:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>[VERS]</span>

<span>[...]</span>
<span>; 905CBD24
</span></code></pre></div>

<p>in my case, the drive is number 8. What’s interesting is the checksum at the end. It’s the CRC32 of the file, minus the last 10 bytes, which can be easily checked with the <code>slice</code> and <code>crc32</code> tools of my hacking Swiss army knife <a href="https://github.com/trou/rsbkb">rsbkb</a>:</p>

<div><pre><code>$ slice -- ISFw.dat 0 -10 | crc32
905cbd24
</code></pre></div>

<p>Now obviously, let’s try to download the relevant file:</p>

<div><pre><code>$ wget https://www.canvio.jp/en/support/download/hdd/ot_ihdd/fw/sk060202.ftd
Resolving www.canvio.jp (www.canvio.jp)... 23.72.248.205, 23.72.248.202

HTTP request sent, awaiting response... 200 OK
Length: 1171456 (1.1M)
[...]
</code></pre></div>

<p>Just for fun we can check if <a href="https://github.com/trou/cpu_rec_rs"><code>cpu_rec_rs</code></a> can identify any code in the binary:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>$</span><span> </span>~/tools/cpu_rec_rs/cpu_rec_rs sk060202.ftd
<span>Loading corpus from "/home/trou/tools/cpu_rec_rs/cpu_rec_corpus/*.corpus"

    File     |   Range    | Detected Architecture
-------------------------------------------------
sk060202.ftd | Whole file | ARMhf
-------------------------------------------------
</span></code></pre></div>

<p>So the firmware is probably running on an ARM SoC (it is).</p>

<h3 id="understanding-the-update-process">Understanding the update process</h3>

<p>Now, how is the file sent to the drive to actually perform the update? Recall that we have 4 binaries and we saw the <code>ISFW.exe</code> is actually a driver.</p>

<p>The <code>DriverEntry</code> function is actually extremely simple:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>NTSTATUS</span> <span>__stdcall</span> <span>DriverEntry</span><span>(</span><span>PDRIVER_OBJECT</span> <span>DriverObject</span><span>,</span> <span>PUNICODE_STRING</span> <span>RegistryPath</span><span>)</span>
<span>{</span>
  <span>int</span> <span>v2</span><span>;</span> <span>// eax</span>

  <span>readregistry</span><span>();</span>
  <span>v2</span> <span>=</span> <span>flashfirmware</span><span>();</span>
  <span>sub_1001812</span><span>(</span><span>v2</span> <span>%</span> <span>100</span> <span>==</span> <span>0</span><span>,</span> <span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>v2</span><span>);</span>

<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>I’ve already renamed <code>readregistry</code> and <code>flashfirmware</code> as the functions are easy to identify:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>char</span> <span>readregistry</span><span>()</span>

<p><code>opendrive</code> returns a handle on a given <code>PhysicalDrive</code>, which is then used by <code>getdevprop</code>’s <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winternl/nf-winternl-ntdeviceiocontrolfile"><code>NtDeviceIoControlFile</code></a>.
Using IDA’s “standard enums”, I remapped <code>0x2D1400</code> to its readable definition: <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winioctl/ni-winioctl-ioctl_storage_query_property"><code>IOCTL_STORAGE_QUERY_PROPERTY</code></a>.</p>

<p>As <code>InputBuffer</code> is set to 0 before the call, the returned data is a <code>STORAGE_DEVICE_DESCRIPTOR</code> structure, which is used by <code>verifydisk</code> to verify if the drive is connected through USB (<code>BusTypeUsb</code>) and bails out if that’s the case.</p>

<p><code>NtDeviceIoControlFile</code> is now used with <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ntddscsi/ni-ntddscsi-ioctl_ata_pass_through_direct"><code>IOCTL_ATA_PASS_THROUGH_DIRECT</code></a>, which as the name implies, sends a raw ATA command to the drive. Actually understanding the request is a bit complex as the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ntddscsi/ns-ntddscsi-_ata_pass_through_direct"><code>ATA_PASS_THROUGH_DIRECT</code></a> structure specifies both data buffers and “registers” through the <code>CurrentTaskFile</code> field.</p>

<p><code>CurrentTaskFile</code> is an array used to index 8 registers, both as input and output. Using the documentation, we can create two enums to use in IDA:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>enum</span> <span>ATA_INPUT_REGISTERS</span> <span>:</span> <span>__int32</span>

The ATA/ATAPI command set specification, found <a href="https://read.seas.harvard.edu/cs161/2024/pdf/ata-atapi-8.pdf">here</a>, describes the <code>IDENTIFY DEVICE – ECh, PIO Data-In</code> command, which returns a <em>lot</em> of data. Thankfully, Microsoft gives us the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ata/ns-ata-_identify_device_data"><code>IDENTIFY_DEVICE_DATA</code></a> structure which has everything.</p>

<p>The following code then verify we have the “right” drive by comparing the serial, model and firmware version from the returned data to the ones stored in the registry.</p>

<p>As you can see, the updater verifies an interesting field from the drive information data: <code>MaxBlocksPerDownloadMicrocodeMode03</code>. Let’s check what this means.</p>

<h3 id="sending-ata-firmware-update-commands">Sending ATA firmware update commands</h3>

<h4 id="documentation">Documentation</h4>

<p>The following excerpt from the ATA command set describes the meaning of the field:</p>

<div><pre><code>A.11.5.3.4 DM MAXIMUM TRANSFER SIZE field
If:
a) the value of the DM MAXIMUM TRANSFER SIZE field (see table A.30) is greater than zero;
b) the value of the DM MAXIMUM TRANSFER SIZE field is less than FFFFh;
c) the DOWNLOAD MICROCODE SUPPORTED bit (see A.11.5.2.20) is set to one or the DOWNLOAD MICROCODE DMA SUPPORTED bit (see A.11.5.2.6) is set to one; and
d) the DM OFFSETS DEFERRED SUPPORTED bit (see A.11.5.3.1) is set to one, or the DM OFFSETS IMMEDIATE
SUPPORTED bit (see A.11.5.3.3) is set to one, then the DM MAXIMUM TRANSFER SIZE field indicates the maximum number of 512-byte data blocks permitted by a DOWNLOAD MICROCODE command (see 7.7) or a DOWNLOAD MICROCODE DMA command (see 7.8) that specifies a subcommand of:
a) Download with offsets and save microcode for immediate and future use (i.e., 03h); or
b) Download with offsets and save microcode for future use (i.e., 0Eh).
Otherwise, no maximum is indicated (i.e., there is no maximum number of 512-byte data blocks).
The IDENTIFY DEVICE data contains a copy of the DM MAXIMUM TRANSFER SIZE field (see IDENTIFY DEVICE
data word 235 in table 45).
</code></pre></div>

<p>Of course, we want to check this <code>DOWNLOAD MICROCODE</code> command:</p>

<div><pre><code>The DOWNLOAD MICROCODE command allows the host to alter the device’s microcode. The data transferred
using the DOWNLOAD MICROCODE command and the DOWNLOAD MICROCODE DMA command is vendor
specific.
[...]
Downloading and activating microcode involves the following steps:
1) download: the host transfers updated microcode data to the device in one or more DOWNLOAD
MICROCODE commands or DOWNLOAD MICROCODE DMA commands;
2) save: after receiving the complete updated microcode data, if specified by the download microcode
mode, then the device shall save the updated microcode data to nonvolatile storage; and
3) activate: the device begins using the saved or deferred microcode data for the first time after an event
specified by the download microcode mode and the saved or deferred microcode data becomes the
active microcode data.

The BLOCK COUNT field specifies the number of 512-byte data blocks that shall be transferred. The BLOCK COUNT
field is specified in the COUNT field and the LBA field (see table 37).
</code></pre></div>

<p><code>DOWNLOAD</code> Subcommands actually define the update behavior:</p>

<p>As you can see, the <code>ATA_CMD_DOWNLOAD_MICRO</code> just follows the specification. The only weird point is the <code>Device</code> register, which is basically obsolete, but is set to <code>0xE0</code>.
Just to be sure, I checked <code>hdparm</code> source code to see the value set in the command, and indeed, they also set it to <code>0xE0</code>, so it’s probably legacy cruft:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>enum</span> <span>{</span>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>

<p>So basically, the updater does:</p>

<ul>
  <li>download the list of updates</li>
  <li>check if a drive matches, set registry values</li>
  <li>the driver takes over and:
    <ul>
      <li>checks if the drive is not connected through USB</li>
      <li>verifies it’s the actual drive specified in the registry using the <code>IDENTIFY DEVICE</code> command</li>
      <li>loops and sends the firmware update, 128 512-bytes chunks at a time, using the <code>DOWNLOAD MICROCODE</code> command</li>
      <li>verifies the drive was updated using the <code>IDENTIFY DEVICE</code> command</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

Another section of this web site talked about outside plant, which is the telephone company's term for the cabling and other equipment which connects your home telephone to their Central Office.
<p>This diagram shows an overview, and below are some pictures and descriptions of how outside plant is different for rural areas.

Around back are some air conditioners, technician's trucks, and even a small aluminum motor boat (the technicians working in this area often have to run telephone lines to islands). Also, at the right are some Jumpered Wire Interfaces (JWI), which split the high pair count cables from the Central Office (such as 1,200 pairs) to smaller cables (such as 200 pairs) for distribution to terminals and people's houses.<span size="-1" color="888888"><br> <a name="4">4</a> of 24<br></span>

Here's another Central Office. This one has a few meters of unused 1,200-pair feeder cable in front (much more attractive than plastic pink flamingos).<span size="-1" color="888888"><br> <a name="5">5</a> of 24<br></span>

The feeder cables coming out of the Central Office are all buried, but within a few meters of the building, they surface to come be run up a utility pole. Note the ancient lead-covered splice enclosure.<span size="-1" color="888888"><br> <a name="9">9</a> of 24<br></span>

</p>
Here's the top of that utility pole. These cables carry everything that this Central Office does (this is what is called a “single point of failure” – one car accident, and there's a lot of people with no phone service).
<div><p>There's another lead closure at the top-left.</p><p><span size="-1" color="888888"><br> <a name="10">10</a> of 24<br></span>

</p>
As shown in the close-up of the 1,200-pair feeder cable above, cable construction is to have twisted pairs covered by a thick plastic protective jacket. After enough sun and flexing in the wind, the cable jacket can develop leaks, which could allow water to seep in between the cable pairs. This would change the electrical characteristics of the cable, and cause many problems (such as cross-talk between telephone lines and distorted signals). Therefore paper insulated cable (these cables will all be more than 40 years old) and sometimes newer cable) are pressurized with air, typically less than 9 pounds per square inch (for comparison, automobile tires typically have a pressure of more than 30 pounds per square inch). This provides several benefits:
<ul><li>Rather than water seeping into the cable, air will leak out, and this keeps the cable dry.</li>
<li>The flow of air through the cable will dry and remove any moisture that does get into the cable.</li> 
<li>By measuring the pressure along test points in the cable, and graphing this, a technician can determine approximately where the cable jacket is bad (the pressure will be lower where the air leaks out).</li></ul>
<div><p>I'm sure you've seen the little packages of <b>dessicant</b> (which look like restaurant coffee sugar packets) of that often come (along with a warning not to eat it) with electronic and other products which have been shipped from overseas. This stuff is a chemical that likes to absorb water (from the damp ocean crossing), so the moisture won't damage the goods. Similarly, there is a need to ensure that the air used to pressurize the cable is dry, and this blue crystalline material is dessicant, and does just that. The air compressor (or “bottled gas”, where the air comes from a compressed air tank) would be in the Central Office, and feeds the black hose, so the air passes through the dessicant, and the hose continues up the utility pole to pressurize the cables father along.</p><p><span size="-1" color="888888"><br> <a name="11">11</a> of 24<br></span>

</p>
Here's a close-up of the dessicant canister. It reminds technicians to:
<ul><li>Change the desiccant when it turns pink.</li>
<li>That the maximum pressure allowed is 25 pounds per square inch (automobile tires typically have a pressure of 28 to 40 pounds per square inch).</li>
<li>And to be gentle with it.</li></ul>

Here is a new air pipe (in an urban location) from a central office, waiting to be connected through to a cable vault farther down the road.<span size="-1" color="888888"><br> <a name="13">13</a> of 24<br></span>
<p><img src="http://cityinfrastructure.com/RuralOutsidePlant/Webfiles/DSCN3436.jpg" alt="DSCN3436.jpg">
</p>
This air pipe is made by Superior Essex. Their catalogue page is <a href="http://cityinfrastructure.com/RuralOutsidePlant/Webfiles/SuperiorEssexAirPipe.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>. It shows that this type of pipe is typically installed in ducts (underground plastic conduits), the pipe has an outside diameter of 18 mm, and has a 4 mil (about the thickness of paper) aluminum tape inside the pipe (since the plastic used would otherwise allow water vapour to pass through the pipe wall (it is important to keep the air dry).<span size="-1" color="888888"><br> <a name="14">14</a> of 24<br></span>

</p>
To split a feeder cable into smaller cables (to each go in different directions) a splice enclosure is needed. Here is a really old lead one (on top), and a newer plastic (and openable) one below it.
<p>Cables with a lead splice closure are old enough that the wires are likely paper insulated (as the bundle of spliced wires is covered in a protective and insulating cloth before the lead closure is sealed with solder, plastic insulated wires can also be enclosed in lead closures, without damage when the lead is sealed with solder).
</p><p>Due to the difficulty of opening and resealing the lead closures, and the health concerns for technicians working with the lead, telephone companies are working at removing this type of closure.
</p><p>Modern buried telephone cables are generally <b>grease filled</b>: when the cable is manufactured, a gel is injected to fill the interstitial spaces between the twisted pairs, so water cannot seep in. In contrast, aerial cables are generally <b>dry</b>, and do not have this gunk.
</p><p>Attached to the lead splice cover is a pressure transducer to enable remote monitoring of the pressure in the cable.
</p><p>A web page for a typical outside plant pressure transducer made by TX Technology Corporation is <a href="http://cityinfrastructure.com/RuralOutsidePlant/Webfiles/Type100F_PressureTransducers.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>. This points out that the transducer is designed to measure pressures from 0 to 9.5 pounds per square inch, and has a corresponding output from 100 kΩ to 3,820 kΩ. More detailed information is <a href="http://cityinfrastructure.com/RuralOutsidePlant/Webfiles/TX_Technology_PressureTransducerInstallation.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>. It points out that the transducer has a water-tight screw cap (with a knurled edge for finger tightening, and a little ball-chain so it won't be lost if dropped) a which can be removed to set the zero-pressure point for the transducer, according to the altitude at which it is installed.
</p><p>The flexible cable hanging down is the electrical signal from the transducer, and is connected to a pair of wires in the lower cable so the pressure at this location can be remotely monitored at the central office. Because most central office activities (such as changing the telephone line features which subscribers receive and trouble-shooting problems) can now be done remotely, most central offices are not normally staffed. Therefore, the system (at the nearest central office) which monitors all the remote pressure transducers will usually be itself monitored remotely.
</p><div><p>When pressurized cable is spliced to dry or greased-filled cable, a <b>plug</b> must be poured into the end of the pressurized cable, so the air does not leak out.</p><p><span size="-1" color="888888"><br> <a name="15">15</a> of 24<br></span>
</p></div><p><img src="http://cityinfrastructure.com/RuralOutsidePlant/Webfiles/DSCN3036.jpg" alt="DSCN3036.jpg                          ">
</p>
Now we get to a really interesting part. As you drive along rural roads, you'll see what appear to be paint cans, each with a this cable coming out the top. If you're really bored, you may also notice that they are exactly 6,000 feet apart (that would be 1.14 miles, and 1.83 km).
<p>Just as you can walk slowly through water, but cannot easily run (since water is more viscous than air), higher-frequency electrical signals are attenuated (made quieter) more than lower-frequency signals.
</p><p>In urban areas, there are generally enough customers within a 5 km radius of Central Offices to justify building a Central Office, and in 5 km of cable, the signals are not distorted too much. In rural areas, customers are farther apart, and the cable runs to customers are longer. The capacitance of the cable (which is analogous to the greater viscosity of water) would attenuate the high-frequency signals (distorting the sound), so inductors (which counter-act the capacitance) are connected to each pair of wires.
</p><div><p>Since the capacitance is spread-out along the length of the cable, the inductance also has to be distributed along the cable. A popular scheme is called <b>H88</b>: the “H” refers to a distance of 6,000 feet between inductors, and the “88” refers to the inductance value of 88 mH (milliHenrys).</p><p><span size="-1" color="888888"><br> <a name="16">16</a> of 24<br></span>
</p></div><p><img src="http://cityinfrastructure.com/RuralOutsidePlant/Webfiles/DSCN3025.jpg" alt="DSCN3025.jpg                          ">
</p>
As you might have guessed, these therefore are not paint cans, but are the enclosures for the loading coils. If there is a 600-pair cable, then you need 600 loading coils (these look something like little spools of thread), and you need to attach each to the feeder cable.
<div><p>Here there are three old loading coils (two large, and one smaller metal enclosure mounted on the utility pole), and one newer black plastic loading coil enclosure attached (with stainless steel straps) to the cable at the left. A splice enclosure allows the cable from the loading coil enclosures to be spliced to the feeder cable</p><p><span size="-1" color="888888"><br> <a name="17">17</a> of 24<br></span>
</p></div><p><img src="http://cityinfrastructure.com/RuralOutsidePlant/Webfiles/DSCN3026.jpg" alt="DSCN3026.jpg                          ">
</p>
Here's a close-up of those big old loading coil enclosures.<span size="-1" color="888888"><br> <a name="18">18</a> of 24<br></span>
<p><img src="http://cityinfrastructure.com/RuralOutsidePlant/Webfiles/DSCN3027.jpg" alt="DSCN3027.jpg                          ">
</p>
As more cables are installed, more loading coils are needed. Here's the newest loading coil (cute, isn't it).<span size="-1" color="888888"><br> <a name="19">19</a> of 24<br></span>
<p><img src="http://cityinfrastructure.com/RuralOutsidePlant/Webfiles/DSCN3030.jpg" alt="DSCN3030.jpg                          ">
</p>
That's it for the loading coils, but on the very next utility pole (and this does generally happen, it will be on a directly adjacent utility pole, as the spacing is also 6,000 feet, likely to simplify installation), there's something else. Rather than being up high, these are generally a waist-height.<span size="-1" color="888888"><br> <a name="20">20</a> of 24<br></span>
<p><img src="http://cityinfrastructure.com/RuralOutsidePlant/Webfiles/DSCN3028%203M%20Closure.jpg" alt="DSCN3028 3M Closure.jpg               ">
</p>
So we have the feeder cables running along, and a 3M splice enclosure bringing a few of the twisted pairs in the cable down the utility pole ...<span size="-1" color="888888"><br> <a name="21">21</a> of 24<br></span>
<p><img src="http://cityinfrastructure.com/RuralOutsidePlant/Webfiles/DSCN3029.jpg" alt="DSCN3029.jpg                          ">
</p>
Down to these, which are <b>T1 repeaters</b>. Rather than the analogue signals carried by telephone lines, a T1 is a digital signal which carries data at 1,544,000 bits/s (on the exact same type of twisted pairs as the voice telephone lines). There are many advantages to T1 signals, including being able to carry 24 conversations over two twisted pairs, not gathering cumulative noise along the length of the cable run, and being able to carry (somewhat) high-speed data. But, the problem is that the signal needs to be amplified periodically – every 6,000 feet in fact. The amplifier is actually called a repeater, since it outputs a binary signal (which has only two states, on or off).<span size="-1" color="888888"><br> <a name="22">22</a> of 24<br></span>
<p><img src="http://cityinfrastructure.com/RuralOutsidePlant/Webfiles/DSCN3031.jpg" alt="DSCN3031.jpg                          ">
</p>
This is the older of the two. The feeder cable is pressurized, and so is the cable coming down to this repeater enclosure, and in fact, the repeater enclosure is pressurized as well. At the base of the white enclosure, you can see the clamp (with padlock) which provides the air-tight seal. Since there are active electronics in this enclosure, and they can't have cooling fans (since it is an air-tight enclosure), these enclosures are always white to reflect the sunlight (and some of the heat) as these bake in the summer sun.<span size="-1" color="888888"><br> <a name="23">23</a> of 24<br></span>
<p><img src="http://cityinfrastructure.com/RuralOutsidePlant/Webfiles/DSCN3035.jpg" alt="DSCN3035.jpg                          ">
</p>
Here's the newer enclosure, it is an HRE-458 HiGain Remote Therm-O-Nator Enclosure from ADC DSL Systems, Inc. Some documentation for it is <a href="http://cityinfrastructure.com/RuralOutsidePlant/Webfiles/2409_ADC_HRE-458.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>, and it can hold up to ten cards, such as this <a href="http://cityinfrastructure.com/RuralOutsidePlant/Webfiles/ADC_HiGain_HDU-409_HDSL_Extender,UserManual.pdf" target="_blank">HDSL line extender</a> which extends the range of two full-duplex 784 kbits/s DSL connections by up to 12,000' using two 24 gauge copper twisted pairs.
<div><p>The enclosure has heat sink fins on top (since heat rises, this will be where it gets the hottest). These help cool the enclosure by providing more surface area, so it can radiate more heat.</p><p><span size="-1" color="888888"><br> <a name="24">24</a> of 24<br></span>
</p></div><p><img src="http://cityinfrastructure.com/RuralOutsidePlant/Webfiles/DSCN3034.jpg" alt="DSCN3034.jpg                          ">
</p>
Here's a look at the bottom, showing the cable entry, and also a pressure relief valve to release the pressure before opening the enclosure. Another opening allows the pressure to be measures. The thinner black wire is to ground the enclosure, so goes to a metal stake driven into the ground.</div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
      <p>Hello everyone - it's been a while!</p><p>I was super busy with 
university and my mandatory internship in a software company for the 
past 6 months, so I haven't posted in a while. But that doesn't mean 
that I was inactive - I spent nearly every evening and every weekend 
working on SpaceHey. I didn't develop any new ground-breaking features, 
but instead I focused on improving the overall SpaceHey experience - 
making it smoother, more stable, easier to use and safer.</p><p>But before I get into the details, let's have a look at a huge milestone first: SpaceHey hit 1 Million registered users!! That's crazy!!<br></p><h2>1 Million users</h2><p>I
 launched SpaceHey at the end of 2020 - I had just graduated high-school,
 and the world was on Covid lockdown. I made SpaceHey, so my generation 
could experience the early days of social media - without a feed, likes 
and whatnot - but instead with colorful, customizable profiles, bulletins and forums. I didn't plan to create anything <i>big</i> - I just had some fun creating this site and improving my coding skills at the same time.</p><p>Still, three and a half years later - SpaceHey has indeed become <i>big</i>.
 One million people is an incredibly huge number of people - it's&nbsp; simply crazy! If someone would've told my 18-year-old self in 2020, I 
would've never believed them. And yet - here we are. I am so incredibly 
thankful for all the support over the past three and a half years - the 
friends I made along the way and the lessons I've learned - both in 
running a community as big as this one as well as the technical challenges that came along.</p><p>One
 million people from all over the world have used SpaceHey so far - an 
independently run platform that does not track you and does not show 
you personalized feeds nor ads. My mission is not to become another big 
social network like <i>Facebook</i> or <i>Twitter</i> (I don't think 
I'll ever call it "X") - but rather trying to be different. More 
personal, more fun to use, and more humane. And I'm proud to say that 
this mission is still very much alive - no matter if there were 500 
users or 1,000,000.<br></p><p>If you like SpaceHey and want to support the platform, you can support me <a href="https://spacehey.com/support" target="_self" rel="ugc">here</a>, and there is also a special #1 Million Merch drop available <a href="https://shop.spacehey.com/" target="_self" rel="ugc">here</a>
 to support SpaceHey. Your support - no matter if it's a donation or a 
Merch order - is what keeps SpaceHey running: thank you!!<br></p><h2>Improving SpaceHey</h2><p>I've
 stopped myself from working on any new features in the past months, but
 rather improve the existing ones and make SpaceHey overall a bit 
smoother. It wasn't easy - but I think it was worth it. You may have 
already noticed less downtime and less App crashes in the past weeks - 
and there are some more improvements coming soon.</p><p>I'm now also 
starting to work on some new features again - which is super fun - and I can't 
wait to share more with you soon (T8 👀) - so stay tuned!<br></p><h2>Keeping SpaceHey safe</h2><p>Another
 big topic I worked on in the past months is safety. As more and more 
people joined SpaceHey, the bots and spammers also increased. Spam, 
hate speech, and other kinds of harmful content has no place on SpaceHey -
 that's why a solution was needed, and eventually found.<br></p><p>The 
solution isn't actually one solution - but a combination of multiple. On
 the one hand, I've implemented more ways to prevent spam in the first 
place - and on the other hand, I've developed more ways to combat 
existing spam. I've expanded the <a href="https://spacehey.com/modapplication" target="_self" rel="ugc">volunteer moderation team</a> and improved the ways the team can discover spam, react to <a href="https://spacehey.com/report" target="_self" rel="ugc">reports</a>
 and keep track of rule violations. I am immensely thankful to the 
volunteers helping me, and I think we are on a great path to keep 
SpaceHey safe.</p><p>If you come across harmful content on SpaceHey, 
please click the "Report" icon next to it, and we'll check it. Thank you
 for doing your part!<br></p><h2>The next steps</h2><p>I am super 
thrilled to keep working on SpaceHey - there are so many awesome, 
talented and fun people here. I can't wait to keep improving the site 
and the App and keep working on some great new features in the near 
future. I am super happy to have you all here, and I hope you are 
enjoying this journey as much as I do!<br></p><h2>Thank you!</h2><p>Last but not least, a <b>huge thank you</b> to every single one of you - you are the people who make SpaceHey what it is - you make it awesome. Thank you so, so much!<br></p><p>Have an awesome day &amp; thank you for using SpaceHey!<br><i>An</i><br></p>

<p><small><em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kong%C5%8D_Gumi#/media/File:Shitenn%C5%8D-ji_main_hall_and_pagoda.png">Image from New York Pub­lic Library, via Wiki­me­dia Com­mons</a></em></small></p>
<p>If you vis­it Osa­ka, you’ll be urged to see two old build­ings in par­tic­u­lar: Osa­ka Cas­tle and Shiten­nō-ji (above), Japan’s first Bud­dhist tem­ple. In behold­ing both, you’ll behold the work of con­struc­tion firm <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kong%C5%8D_Gumi">Kongō Gumi</a> (金剛組), the old­est con­tin­u­ous­ly run com­pa­ny in the world. It was with the build­ing of Shiten­nō-ji, com­mis­sioned by Prince Shō­toku Taishi in the year 578, that brought it into exis­tence in the first place. Back then, “Japan was pre­dom­i­nant­ly Shin­to and had no <em>miyadaiku</em> (car­pen­ters trained in the art of build­ing Bud­dhist tem­ples),” <a href="https://worksthatwork.com/3/kongo-gumi">writes Irene Her­rera at <em>Works that Work</em></a><em>,</em> “so the prince hired three skilled men from Baek­je, a Bud­dhist state in what is now Korea,” among them a cer­tain Kongō Shiget­su.</p>
<p>There­after, Kongō Gumi con­tin­ued to oper­ate inde­pen­dent­ly for more than 1,400 years, run by 40 gen­er­a­tions of Kongō Shiget­su’s descen­dants. By the time Toy­oto­mi Hideyoshi had the com­pa­ny build Osa­ka Cas­tle in 1583, it had been estab­lished for near­ly a mil­len­ni­um. In the cen­turies since, “the cas­tle has been destroyed repeat­ed­ly by fire and light­ning,” Her­rera writes. “Kongō Gumi pros­pered because of these major recon­struc­tions, which pro­vid­ed them with plen­ty of work.” Through­out most of its long his­to­ry, an even stead­ier busi­ness came from their spe­cial­ty of build­ing Bud­dhist tem­ples, at least until seri­ous chal­lenges to that busi­ness mod­el arose in the twen­ti­eth cen­tu­ry.</p>

<p>“World War II brought sig­nif­i­cant changes to Japan, and the demand for tem­ple con­struc­tion waned,” <a href="https://www.toki.tokyo/blogt/2023/8/9/kong-gumi-co-ltd-the-enduring-legacy-of-japans-oldest-company">says the tourism com­pa­ny Toki</a>. “Sens­ing the shift­ing tides of the time, the com­pa­ny made a strate­gic deci­sion to piv­ot its exper­tise towards a new endeav­or: the craft­ing of coffins.” Gov­ern­men­tal per­mis­sion was arranged by the wid­ow of Kongō Haruichi, Kongō Gumi’s 37th leader, who’d tak­en his own life out of finan­cial despair inflict­ed by the Shōwa Depres­sion of the nine­teen-twen­ties. Here time at the head of the com­pa­ny illus­trates its long-held will­ing­ness to grant lead­er­ship duties not just to first sons, but to fam­i­ly mem­bers best suit­ed to do the job; for that rea­son, the his­to­ry of the Kongō clan involves many sons-in-law delib­er­ate­ly sought out for that pur­pose.</p>

</div>

<p>The com­bined forces of the decline of Bud­dhism and the pop­ping of Japan’s real-estate bub­ble in the nineties even­tu­al­ly forced Kongō Gumi to become a sub­sidiary of Taka­mat­su Con­struc­tion Group in Jan­u­ary 2006. “The cur­rent Kongō Gumi work­force has only one mem­ber of the Kongō fam­i­ly,” <a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Companies/Japan-s-oldest-company-defies-time-with-merit-based-succession">the Nikkei Asia report­ed in 2020</a>, “a daugh­ter of the 40th head of the fam­i­ly” who “now serves as the 41st head.” But its <em>miyadaiku</em> — dis­tinc­tive­ly orga­nized into eight inde­pen­dent <em>kumi</em>, or groups — con­tin­ue to do the work they always have, with ever-more-refined ver­sions of the tra­di­tion­al tools and tech­niques they’ve been using for near­ly a mil­len­ni­um and a half. Kongō Gumi con­tin­ues to receive inter­na­tion­al atten­tion for main­tain­ing its high lev­el of crafts­man­ship, but view­ers of Amer­i­can TV dra­ma in recent years will also appre­ci­ate that its hav­ing solved the prob­lem of suc­ces­sion.</p>

Swapping SD cards, messing with card readers and power supplies while working is distracting and annoying.</p><p>In order to avoid this, a number of useful tools exist:</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.nordicsemi.com/Products/Development-hardware/Power-Profiler-Kit-2" target="_blank">Nordic Power Profiler Kit II</a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/linux-automation/usbsdmux" target="_blank">USB-SD-Mux Fast</a></li><li>USB-UART converter</li></ul><p><img src="https://kittenlabs.de/blog/2024/09/01/extreme-pi-boot-optimization/featured-DSC01414.jpg" width="80%" alt="Hardware setup, Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W, USB-SD-Mux and PPK2"></p><h5 id="power-profiler-kit">Power Profiler Kit<a href="#power-profiler-kit" aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h5><p>The Power Profiler Kit II (now called PPK) can supply power to a device-under-test (DUT) and will measure it accurately over time.
You can enable/disable the DUT, see the power consumption at any point and also see the status of 8 digital inputs!
We’ll connect one of the digital inputs to a GPIO pin on the Raspberry Pi.</p><p>This way, the first action of “our application” (aka the finish line) will be to toggle the GPIO pin.
We then just have to measure the time between power-up and GPIO toggle.</p><h5 id="usb-sd-mux">USB-SD-Mux<a href="#usb-sd-mux" aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h5><p>The USB-SD-Mux is a very useful tool for hardware hackers - it’s an interposer between a microSD card and a DUT with a USB-C interface.
A computer can “steal” the microSD card from the DUT, rewrite its contents and then plug the microSD card back into the DUT, without ever having to touch the device.</p><p>This makes the workflow of testing changes <em>much</em> easier and faster by avoiding unplugging the card, plugging it into a microSD reader, flashing it, plugging the card back into the DUT, etc. It can even be used to automate the reset or power of the DUT with on-board GPIOs.</p><h5 id="usb-uart-converter">USB-UART converter<a href="#usb-uart-converter" aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h5><p>Some form of UART interface is pretty much required. These changes will break system boot, WiFi connectivity, etc. at some point and without a UART console we would be flying blind. A standard CP2102, FTDI, etc. will work well.</p><h3 id="measurement--test-setup">Measurement / Test setup<a href="#measurement--test-setup" aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h3><p>On a clean Debian 12 (bookworm) arm64 Lite image, the <code>/boot/firmware/cmdline.txt</code> file was modified to include <code>init=/init.sh</code>.
