    <p>While laid up with a minor but annoying medical issue over the last week, I've
<a href="https://www.gilesthomas.com/2025/02/mathml-fonts-on-chromium-based-browsers">blogged</a>
<a href="https://www.gilesthomas.com/2025/02/ai-debugging-is-not-always-the-solution">more</a>
<a href="https://www.gilesthomas.com/2025/02/basic-neural-network-matrix-maths-part-1">than</a>
<a href="https://www.gilesthomas.com/2025/02/basic-neural-network-matrix-maths-part-2">usual</a>.
I've also spent some time reading through the archives here, and come to the
conclusion that the best posts I've made -- at least from my perspective --
follow a similar pattern.  They're posts where I've been learning how to do something,
or how something worked, and presented what I've found as a summary, often
as a tutorial.</p>

<p>I think of these as <em>writing the post that I wished I'd found</em> when I started
learning whatever it was.</p>


    
        <p>I think these posts serve two purposes.</p>

<p>Firstly, for me, they're an excellent way to codify and solidify the knowledge.
Finding out how to do something new, and ideally doing it, is important to grow
as an engineer, but writing down what you learned makes it sink into your mind at
a gut level.  I'm a big believer that you don't really understand something
properly if you can't explain it to an intelligent and interested listener.
I still remember how the <code>epoll</code> system call works, and the
difference between edge-triggered and level-triggered events, despite it
being almost twelve years since <a href="https://www.gilesthomas.com/2013/08/writing-a-reverse-proxyloadbalancer-from-the-ground-up-in-c-part-0">I wrote about it</a>.</p>

<p>But it seems that they might also be the most useful ones for other people.  From
Google Search Console, I can see that the majority of visits to this blog
from people who aren't regular readers comes from searches for things
that I've written about in these posts.  Comparing their search terms to what I
wrote about in the posts in question, there seems to be a good match -- so hopefully
they're finding what they are looking for.</p>

<p>I've decided to make a concerted effort to post more of this kind of thing.  I
struggled a bit to think of a snappy category name for them, as "tutorials that I
wished someone else had written for me before I started trying to learn this stuff"
is a bit wordy.  I've tentatively settled on "<a href="https://www.gilesthomas.com/til-deep-dives">TIL deep dives</a>" --
they're not the quick "Today I learned" posts that I've seen on other people's
blogs (Simon Willison is the master of this and even has <a href="https://til.simonwillison.net/">a subdomain devoted to his</a>)
-- but they're a similar kind of beast, a longer form of the same kind of thing.</p>

<p>Thoughts, as always, welcome in the comments below.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>This week, the UK put the entire world at risk. I understand that may sound like alarmist hyperbole, but follow me. To understand, we have to go back to 2016, a year that I like to describe as “the year the world got collectively blackout drunk and decided to call our ex.” A lot of wild stuff happened that year – especially in the UK – so one thing that might’ve slipped under the radar was the passing of a little law called the Investigatory Powers Act. This law would later go on to be nicknamed “The Snooper’s Charter” by critics, and it allowed the UK to dramatically expand their electronic surveillance powers. How dramatically, you might ask? Two weeks ago, Apple was <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2025/02/07/apple-encryption-backdoor-uk/">ordered</a> to insert an encryption backdoor (more on that in a moment) into iCloud. And they weren’t allowed to publicly disclose it. And also even if they wanted to fight it, they’d still have to comply while the courts considered their appeal.</p>

<p>Yeah. That dramatically.</p>

<p>The thing is, Apple has made it abundantly clear in no uncertain terms that they will <a href="https://www.apple.com/privacy/government-information-requests/">refuse any request</a> by any government to knowingly insert backdoors into their software. So in light of their inability to fight this request, Apple simply decided to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/02/apple-pulls-data-protection-tool-instead-of-caving-to-uk-demand-for-a-backdoor/">remove</a> iCloud encryption entirely for UK users.</p>

<h2 id="advanced-data-protection">Advanced Data Protection</h2>

<p>Some readers may be a little confused on how all this works (also my wording wasn't 100% accurate for the sake of brevity), so let me break it down real quick. <a href="https://thenewoil.org/en/guides/prologue/encryption/">Encryption</a> is the practice of taking data and making it unreadable to unauthorized parties, much like a secret code or language. Most modern devices and internet traffic is encrypted, but in such a way that the service provider still has access. Your Gmail inbox, for example, is encrypted as it travels between your phone and Google’s servers but it’s decrypted at those two spots, meaning anyone at Google who has the proper access can access your emails. (There's a lot of valid reasons for this, but it also opens up your data to being spied on, sold, or otherwise shared and potentially abused.) Some providers, however, take it a step further and implement what's called “end-to-end encryption,” (aka “E2EE” or “zero-knowledge encryption”). This is data encrypted in such a way where it’s only ever accessible on your devices, never the provider’s. (More on all of this in the page I linked earlier in this paragraph.) While there are no doubt a handful of evil people who would abuse E2EE to better cover their harmful tracks, it also benefits ordinary, law-abiding users by giving them a huge defensive boost against data breaches, massive data collection, unchecked mass surveillance, and a myriad of other threats online.</p>

<p>This brings us to Apple’s “Advanced Data Protection” program. Released in 2022, ADP was a huge upgrade to Apple’s iCloud suite, encrypting nearly everything stored in iCloud (except emails, contacts, and calendars) using E2EE. This feature required users to manually enable it, and while I always encourage readers to explore other options by privacy-first companies, I (among many other privacy enthusiasts) still touted this as a win for giving the everyday user an easy, effective way to protect their data. <em>This</em> is the encryption that Apple removed in the UK. Certain Apple products – like iMessage, Health, Passwords, and other data – remain end-to-end encrypted as it always has been, but ADP is specifically what the UK ordered a backdoor into, and thus ADP is what was pulled.</p>

<h2 id="backdoors-salt-typhoon">Backdoors &amp; Salt Typhoon</h2>

<p>Now, quickly, let me explain what an “encryption backdoor” is since I’ve already used it several times and it’s critical to this discussion. A “backdoor” is a term used to describe any sort of loophole in the encryption (or program) that allows someone – usually the developer – to gain direct access to the program or data. Usually this is done quietly, in the background, without the consent or awareness of the end user. (This should not be confused with things like analytics, telemetry, or granting access to tech support voluntarily.)</p>

<p>For years, politicians (and others) have called for backdoors in various software – usually encrypted messengers and the like – with the promise that it will only ever be used by the “good guys.” The problem is that backdoors are very aptly named: a backdoor of a house can be a great tool, allowing residents to come and go into their back yard conveniently and freely. For example, many households will leave the backdoor unlocked as a failsafe for residents to get in or out while reducing their risk – the backdoor is behind the house, maybe behind a fence, hidden out of sight where it may be less tempting to would-be crooks than leaving the front door unlocked.</p>

<p>At least, that’s the theory, right? But we all know that it’s a feel-good gesture at best. Bad guys have no way of knowing that the front door is unlocked, and if the backdoor is unlocked all it takes is one brave criminal who’s scouting the house to hop the fence and try the door. Furthermore, even if it is locked, I’ve personally noted in the past that residential locks are criminally (no pun intended) <a href="https://youtu.be/T_sy3dLwHkc">easy</a> to pick, often taking just a few seconds to someone with even the slightest amount of practice.</p>

<p>There's a reason the term was applied to encryption. Technology is difficult for most people to understand. For those without training in code or electronic engineering, computers seem akin to magic boxes powered by fairy dust and electricity. Even for those trying to learn, it can be difficult to find a good entry point. As such, it’s easy – and tempting – to hear someone promise “a backdoor that only good guys can use” and go “I don’t understand the details but surely it must be true.” After all, deepfakes, cyberespionage, and quantum computers are real things. Surely the magic box full of YouTube and cats makes anything possible, right?</p>

<p>Except – as the tech savvy in the crowd know – no, that’s not at all how it works. A software backdoor is exactly like a physical one: it only keeps out people acting in good faith. Those determined to get in will find their way, whether that’s a vulnerability in the software/encryption itself, or by <a href="https://thenewoil.org/en/guides/less-important/habits/#phishing--clicking-links">phishing</a> a legitimate user and stealing their login credentials or any other number of ways. And that’s to say nothing about the idea of “good guys;” who are they, exactly? Insider threats are a real thing. An abusive homeowner has “legitimate” access to the house’s backdoor, just as a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/1/20893462/yahoo-engineer-hacking-accounts-stolen-nude-photos-videos-guilty-plea">rogue employee</a> would have access to the same backdoor in your encryption. People are people. Some of them are traitors, or make mistakes, or give in to temptation.</p>

<p>In fact, we have real-world proof that backdoors are indiscriminate: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_United_States_telecommunications_hack">Salt Typhoon</a>. In late 2024, it came to light that the Chinese government had hacked into at least 9 American telecoms providers (as well as dozens of other countries) using – among other techniques – a backdoor specifically designed to be used by law enforcement for court-approved wiretapping. I <em>cannot</em> impress upon you, dear reader, how big of a deal this is. Every major American cell provider – Verizon, T-Mobile, AT&amp;T, and others – had their backdoor abused by the “bad guys” which gave them access to call logs, messages, and tons of other sensitive data for people up to and including President Donald Trump, Vice President Kamala Harris, and more – using the <strong>exact same tool</strong> designed for the “good guys.” This is absolute, unarguable proof that “a backdoor only the good guys can use” is a fantasy. Politicians who promise this may as well promise unicorns and orcs while they’re at it.</p>

<h2 id="the-broader-pattern">The Broader Pattern</h2>

<p>At this point, you may be convinced that backdoors are bad and the UK was wrong for ordering Apple to implement one. But you may wonder how this threatens users worldwide as I claimed at the start of this article. After all, ADP was only removed from the UK. The answer lies in the larger context: this is a pattern.</p>

<p>I promise I’ll keep this brief, but allow me to give you a quick bit of important internet history: if you’re reading this article, there’s a possibility you've at least heard of services like ProtonMail or Tuta. These are encrypted email providers, and their services are basically built on top of an encryption scheme called “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretty_Good_Privacy">PGP</a>,” which premiered in 1991. Almost immediately, the government tried to stifle PGP, claiming that it should be classified as a weapon and therefore subject to the same regulations as weapons exports in terms of how it was distributed to foreign users. The case was taken to court, where the Supreme Court ultimately ruled that code was free speech, that subjecting code to the same regulations as weapons exports was insane, and that intentionally weakening code to try to one-up our enemies was pointless (and also insane). Thanks to this ruling, we now have a much safer digital with the proliferation of encryption technologies like TLS and AES, allowing for safe online shopping, encrypted storage, and much more. This case became one of the most prominent episodes of what was later dubbed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crypto_Wars#PC_era">The Crypto Wars</a>. (Fun fact: this case was also what put the <a href="https://www.eff.org/">Electronic Frontier Foundation</a> on the map, and their current Executive Director, Cindy Cohn, was the lead attorney in the case.)</p>

<p>The thing is, the Crypto Wars never really ended. It just comes and goes in phases. For example, during the first Trump administration, US Attorney General <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2019/08/post-snowden-tech-became-more-secure-but-is-govt-really-at-risk-of-going-dark/">William Barr</a> very outspokenly supported encryption backdoors. But don’t worry, that’s not a partisan take, because the Biden administration also indirectly supported backdoors via the 2022 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kids_Online_Safety_Act">Kids Online Safety Act</a>, which likely would’ve encouraged platforms to weaken, backdoor, or disable encryption to comply. (No word on how Biden would’ve responded to even more hostile bills like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EARN_IT_Act">EARN IT Act</a> or the <a href="https://cdt.org/insights/the-stop-csam-act-threatens-free-expression-and-privacy-rights-of-children-and-adults/">STOP CSAM Act</a>.)</p>

<p>But lest you think this is a US trend, rest assured that it’s not. The most infamous assault on your digital safety in Europe comes in the form of <a href="https://www.patrick-breyer.de/en/posts/chat-control/">Chat Control</a>, a proposal to force messengers like WhatsApp to scan all your messages for CSAM (Child Sexual Abuse Material). If that sounds familiar, that’s because Apple voluntarily proposed a similar system a few years ago, intending to scan photos on-device before being uploaded to iCloud to look for any illicit content. They ultimately decided <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/apple-icloud-photo-scan-csam-pause-backlash/">against</a> the plan after public backlash, including several proofs-of-concept showing that the system was faulty and an admission that this, too, was a slippery slope ripe for abuse. They ultimately decided there was no way to implement this program in a way that was both effective and reasonably abuse-proof, so they decided to drop it altogether. (Chat Control – and other abominations like the EARN IT Act – still rear their hideous heads from time to time. Apparently the memo is lost in transit somewhere.)</p>

<p>The UK is now spearheading the smear campaign against privacy with things like their <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2022/01/20/no_place_hide_campaign_anti_e2ee_ukgov/"></a><a href="https://blog.thenewoil.org/tag:NoPlaceToHide"><span>#</span><span>NoPlaceToHide</span></a> campaign, which aimed to paint anyone using encryption as a pedophile. (No, that’s not an exaggeration, actually.) There are still numerous bullish threats to privacy across the western world including calls to erase online anonymity to fight hate speech, vast social media surveillance programs, and more. The UK’s latest demand of Apple is not just an attack on their own citizens. It’s another step forward in a global assault against privacy, online safety, and self-sovereignty for individuals. Placed in the larger context of these ongoing proposals, regulations, and attempts to shift public narrative, this is another blow to privacy – and at least for now, an effective one.</p>

<h2 id="fighting-back">Fighting Back</h2>

<p>In light of the overwhelming evidence against backdoors – things like Salt Typhoon and <a href="https://thenewoil.org/en/guides/prologue/why/#why-care-about-security">rampant data breaches</a> – the only conclusion I can come to is that those who push for backdoors are either ignorant (uneducated on how technology works and thus misled to believe that such a thing is possible) or malicious (knowing full-well it’s not possible but prioritizing their own goals – be it national security or control – over the safety of the individuals under them). But for the UK and those who view encryption as a threat to their ends, it doesn’t matter. The end result is the same: UK user data is now accessible. This is a huge encouragement to other regimes seeking to undermine user safety in the name of whatever packaging they’ve picked this week: child safety, national security, etc.</p>

<p>There are some who speculate that Apple’s withdrawal was strategic: now they can fight the order without needing to comply while it works its way through the courts. I don’t know if that’s true (I haven’t seen any credible sources confirming it) but I would like to believe it is, not because I’m an Apple fan (I discourage my users from using Apple services even if they do decide to use an iPhone) but because I think Apple fighting back and winning would regain lost ground for the right to privacy, much as the ruling for Phil Zimmermann and PGP was ultimately a foundational win that future internet safety would go on to be built on top of. It would set a legal precedent saying “no, you can’t order backdoors (or at least you can’t do them in secret and force compliance in the meantime).” Either of those rulings would be a step forward for the safety of everyday, ordinary digital citizens everywhere. When one country – especially a global superpower – does something, it emboldens others to try following suit. Usually for the worse.</p>

<p>In the meantime, I would like to leave readers with some actionable takeaways. Even if Apple fights this case, it will take years to play out, and we have no guarantee of how it will go.</p>

<p>First things first: those who use iCloud should stop doing so. While ADP remains available in other countries, personally I’ve never been a fan of trusting all your data to a single, proprietary company. While iCloud is very convenient, I’m not entirely convinced it’s worth it. Many of Apple’s services can be safely and easily replicated in other trustworthy services, like photos, calendar, notes, and even drive storage. These are companies who put privacy and security first – not bolting it on as an afterthought the way companies like Apple have done. They're also transparent and rarely have to appease investors, meaning they are incentivized to protect you – the user – instead of selling your data to maximize shareholder profits. The New Oil offers a list of such services <a href="https://thenewoil.org/en/guides/most-important/mobile-apps/">here</a>.</p>

<p>For those things that can’t be easily replicated – like health data, reminders, and digital wallets – I would encourage users to consider what you can store on-device – or better yet, live without. While I will be the first to admit the convenience of things like Apple Wallet or enjoying the insight into the quality of my sleep, I can also confidently say that the trade off is very minimal. Studies have shown cash to be more effective in helping you stay on budget, and for most people basic sleep hygiene (like getting off screens 30 mins before bed, keeping the bedroom dark, and being consistent with your routines) will be plenty.</p>

<p>Finally, I believe that it’s always worth getting involved politically. While we can’t always rely on politicians and laws to protect us, I strongly believe that good privacy laws can act as a layer of defense (just compare the problem of “<a href="https://thenewoil.org/en/guides/moderately-important/people-search/">people search websites</a>” between America and the EU, where GDPR makes them virtually nonexistent). If you’re a UK citizen, you should absolutely find the contact information for your representatives and (politely) express your displeasure at this request and demand they drop the request and start protecting users online instead. (For those who need help making sure they’re communicating effectively, you’ll want to inform them you disprove of the UK’s “technical capability notice” issued to Apple regarding their Advanced Data Protection offering in January of this year.) If you're unsure where to even start with political action, check out the “<a href="https://thenewoil.org/en/links/#get-involved">Get Involved</a>” section of my website. Some of the organizations listed – like Big Brother Watch and Privacy International – are UK based.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Nobody in the privacy community defends crime, especially serious crimes that harm others. But we must always balance our desire to stop the <a href="https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2015/oct/06/dan-patrick/dan-patrick-says-all-crime-estimate-committed-15-p/">tiny percentage</a> of criminals against our right to freedom as citizens (I have written about this many times before, probably most notable <a href="https://blog.thenewoil.org/an-open-letter-to-congresspeople-regarding-s#we-don-t-ban-freedom-because-some-people-abuse-it">here</a>). Many of those who support privacy-hostile proposals do so in the name of protecting the children. I don’t have kids of my own, but I do have nieces and nephews that I adore and would do anything for. I can’t help but wonder what sort of world we’re leaving them where they have no freedom to explore and grow, where they’re forever haunted by their mistakes in a digital permanent record, where the only thing standing between their freedom of expression and a fear of self-exploration is policy and not real, technical safeguards that make such abuse impossible. Protecting people is admirable, and we should take all reasonable measures we can to do so. Banning encryption is neither reasonable nor protecting people. It’s actively putting them at risk. Force the UK to respect your privacy and safety by switching to services outside their reach, and let them know that you – a voter – do not support this authoritarian red herring.</p>

<!-- end common pagetop -->
<!-- end common pre2 -->
<p>2025-02-21</p>

<p><img src="https://beej.us/blog/data/mastodon-comments/images/mastodon_logo_purple.svg" alt="Websockets Logo"> Comments powered by Mastodon!</p>
<p>I hate ads. I also hate tracking and bloat. But I didn't actually hate
the latter quite enough to get rid of <a href="https://disqus.com/">Disqus</a> for
comments. It was a free, good service, and you could turn off ads for
the users (which I did).</p>
<p>But recently they sent out a mail saying they were not longer offering a
free ad-free option, and it's not worth paying for at my usage levels,
so they got the boot.</p>
<p>What to replace them with? The ultimate would be some kind of home-grown
thing, which I <em>could</em> do with the hosting I have. But it's more than I
want to take on right now.</p>
<p>So that leaves "Comments in Mastodon" as the winner. There's significant
overlap between Mastodon users and my meager collection of blog readers,
so that's not too bad.</p>
<p>The only thing that remains is either grabbing someone else's code to do
the work, or doing it myself. Doing it myself is more fun. Let's figure
it out!</p>
<p>I assumed correctly there was probably an API that would return JSON
data for public comments, and it seems like it should do so without any
login credentials.</p>
<p>First, get the JSON, then parse it down and convert it to HTML,
then embed that in the page. And style it all with CSS.</p>
<p>Oh, and make it work with my custom static site generator.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><img src="https://beej.us/blog/common/images/goat50.png" alt="Hint Goat">
Yes, this is going to be JavaScript-powered. I respect that some
people don't support JS, but since Mastodon requires it, we're going
to go with it. Also, it saves me from having a server-side component.</p>
<p>The only assurance I can give is that I don't use JS for tracking or
ads. So you should go ahead and whitelist my site. 😁</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The basic idea is that we're going to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Write a blog entry.</li>
<li>Post a link to that blog from our Mastodon account.</li>
<li>Link the blog entry back to our Mastodon post.</li>
<li>In the blog entry, show all the replies that have been made to that
Mastodon post.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Audience</h2>
<p>This assumes you know some basic JavaScript/HTML/CSS, e.g. finding DOM
elements, setting <code>innerHTML</code>, styling with CSS, using <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tags,
etc.</p>
<p>I'm going "high-level overview" here, not "complete source code".</p>
<h2>Getting the Post ID</h2>
<p>When you make the announcement post to Mastodon, you need the ID of that
post so you can refer to it from your blog page.</p>
<p>The easiest way to get this is to go to your post on Mastodon, and look
at the URL.</p>
<pre><code>https://mastodon.sdf.org/@beejjorgensen/114011021587416866
</code></pre>
<p>That number at the end is your post ID. We'll need it for later.</p>
<h2>My Site Generator</h2>
<p>I could go off on a tangent here talking about how I think everyone
should write their own static site builder. Preferably in some
POSIX-compliant shell like Bash or Zsh. Because it's super portable,
fast as hell, already installed, and maximally removes dependencies.</p>
<p>But instead, I'll just cover the basics. This site is written in
Markdown (I'm writing Markdown right now in this very sentence). And the
site builder converts that to HTML, sticks some common headers and
footers on there, and then, importantly, substitutes some text in the
result with other values.</p>
<p>But that last bit is how we're going to make a static page aware of the
Mastodon post ID we're going to be peeling comments off of.</p>
<p>For example, the post with the comments might have ID
<code>114011021587416866</code>. Somehow I need to embed that inside the HTML for
the page to be able to <code>fetch()</code> the data.</p>
<p>I do this by having a placeholder in the pre-built HTML that looks like
this:</p>
<pre><code>MASTODON_POST_ID
</code></pre>
<p>Any place that string appears in the HTML, I replace it with
<code>114011021587416866</code>. (Using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sed">sed</a>.)</p>
<p>And where do I get <code>114011021587416866</code>? It's in a file called <code>env.sh</code>
in the directory for this particular blog entry.</p>
<p>It has content in it like this, setting shell environment variables:</p>
<pre><code>MASTODON_POST_ID=114011021587416866
</code></pre>
<p>I source this into the site builder shell script before the build starts
so I can do the substitution.</p>
<p>If that environment variable isn't found, no comments section is emitted.</p>
<p>I use that ID a couple places in the code, so the site builder emits
some HTML for "view" and "reply" buttons that look like this (wrapped
for ease):</p>
<pre><code>&lt;a id="comments-view"
    href="https://mastodon.sdf.org/@beejjorgensen/114011021587416866"
    data-comments-id="114011021587416866"&gt;View Comments&lt;/a&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Note the post ID in the <code>href</code>, but I've also added it to
<code>data-comments-id</code>, which means I can get it in JavaScript like this,
thanks to the whole
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement/dataset">dataset</a>
field:</p>
<pre><code>const a_elem = document.querySelector("#comments-view");
const post_id = a_elem.dataset.commentsId;
</code></pre>
<p>However you do it, though, you somehow have to get the Mastodon post ID
into the page.</p>
<h2>What's the API?</h2>
<p>Now, on to business.</p>
<p>It's actually pretty simple to get a post and all its attached comments.
You're going to want to do this for the server you have an account on,
which in my case is <code>mastodon.sdf.org</code>. (<a href="https://sdf.org/">SDF</a> is a
venerable, classic public access Unix system.)</p>
<p>You just have to hit the API endpoint. Let's use the same post ID from
the previous section in this example. Here is the URL to get the
comments (with my example post ID):</p>
<pre><code>https://mastodon.sdf.org/api/v1/statuses/114011021587416866/context
</code></pre>
<p>That's it. You can <a href="https://mastodon.sdf.org/api/v1/statuses/114011021587416866/context">go hit it right
now</a>
in your browser and see the JSON output.</p>
<p>And there's a <em>lot</em> of it.</p>
<p>But for my bit, I only wanted a few pieces from the commenter so that I
could use them to build the comment HTML.</p>
<ol>
<li>Their display name</li>
<li>Their account name</li>
<li>Their avatar URL</li>
<li>Their profile URL</li>
<li>Their content (what they posted)</li>
<li>Their attachments (more on that later)</li>
<li>Their comment Mastodon ID (for blacklist reasons)</li>
</ol>
<p>If we look at the response we got, it has two keys: <code>ancestors</code> and
<code>descendants</code>. The descendants are what we're interested in, i.e. all
the comments made in reply to our post. And <code>descendants</code> is an array of
all those comments.</p>
<p>Let's look at those elements and find what's interesting. Say <code>d = descendants[i]</code>. Then, searching through the JSON, we have:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Field</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><code>d.account.display_name</code></td>
<td>Their display name</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>d.account.acct</code></td>
<td>Their account name</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>d.account.avatar_static</code></td>
<td>Their avatar URL</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>d.account.display_name</code></td>
<td>Their profile URL</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>d.content</code></td>
<td>Their content (what they posted)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>d.media_attachments</code></td>
<td>Their attachments (an array)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>d.id</code></td>
<td>Their comment Mastodon ID</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<blockquote>
<p><img src="https://beej.us/blog/common/images/goat50.png" alt="Hint Goat">
There's both <code>avatar</code> and <code>avatar_static</code> in the response. The former
might be animated, and the latter is not. You could do something
interesting here like switch to the animated one on mouse-over, but I
didn't bother. I just always used the <code>_static</code> option for the various
images.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So we have what we need, right there in each record.</p>
<h2>JavaScript at Last</h2>
<p>All we need to do is <code>fetch()</code> that information with our Mastodon post
ID that we baked into our static HTML. There are no credentials needed
to access public posts (so be sure to make your Mastodon post public).</p>
<p>But when should we fetch? Should we do it on page load? When the element
becomes visible? On a click?</p>
<p>If you have a high-traffic site, you might start raising the ire of your
Mastodon server admins if you repeatedly hit that URL. My site is
nowhere near those limits, so I <em>could</em> just load the comments after my
blog loads.</p>
<p>But I don't like extra overhead unless the user wants it, so instead I
hooked it up to a link. The comments will only appear on the page if the
user clicks the "View Comments" link.</p>
<p>A compromise might be to lazily load the comments when the user scrolls
down enough for them to be visible. But I just went for manual. (I drive
a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manual_transmission">stick</a>, too, BTW.)</p>
<p>In any case, we'll need a function to load the comments, and it'll look
like this:</p>
<pre><code>async load_comments(ev) {
    const post_id = MASTODON_POST_ID;

    // Change the URL to your server
    const url = `https://mastodon.sdf.org/api/v1/statuses/${post_id}/context`

    try {
        const response = await fetch(url);
        if (!response.ok) {
            throw new Error(`Response status: ${response.status}`);
        }

        const json = await response.json();

        populate_comments(json);

    } catch (error) {
        alert(`Error loading comments: ${error.message}`);
        console.error(error.message);
    }

}
</code></pre>
<p>It's an async function that uses the <code>fetch()</code> API to get the data for
my Mastodon post that corresponds to this blog entry.</p>
<p>Once it has loaded, we call <code>populate_comments()</code> with the JSON data to
actually build out the HTML. Let's talk about that next.</p>
<h2>Building the HTML</h2>
<p>This all depends on how you want your stuff to look at the end of the
day.</p>
<p>I wanted something that looked like what we have at the bottom of this
page, so I have some code that generates these. Here's what it looks
like (obviously with values substituted in where appropriate):</p>
<pre><code>&lt;div class="mast-comment"&gt;
    &lt;div class="mast-comment-header"&gt;
        &lt;div class="mast-comment-avatar"&gt;
            &lt;a href="ACCOUNT_URL"&gt;
                &lt;img src="ACCOUNT_AVATAR_URL"&gt;
            &lt;/a&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;div class="mast-comment-ident"&gt;
            &lt;div class="mast-comment-acct"&gt;
                &lt;a href="ACCOUNT_URL"&gt;
                    ACCOUNT_NAME
                &lt;/a&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;div class="mast-comment-display-name"&gt;
                &lt;a href="ACCOUNT_URL"&gt;
                    ACCOUNT_DISPLAY_NAME
                &lt;/a&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="mast-comment-content"&gt;
        COMMENT_CONTENT
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;!-- attachment HTML goes here --&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Having it in that form allowed me to add some <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_flexible_box_layout/Basic_concepts_of_flexbox">flexbox
CSS</a>
to lay out the whole thing.</p>
<p>I basically just appended a bunch of those to a string and then dumped
it into the <code>innerHTML</code> of the comments block.</p>
<p>Note that the record <code>content</code> field is already HTML-encoded so there's
no need to do that again. (And if you do, you'll lose the comment
formatting and just display a bunch of HTML tags.)</p>
<h2>Media Attachments</h2>
<p>This was interesting. Users can attach things to their posts. And then
the question becomes what to do with them. The real Mastodon client will
display previews of the attachments that you can click on to get the
whole thing.</p>
<p>I'm going simpler with my stuff. Basically I'm just going to put a link
with a text description. I don't want the comments to be too polluted
with media.</p>
<p>We can find the media attachments in the <code>media_attachments</code> field,
which, if present, is an array.</p>
<p>I just needed a few pieces of information from each <code>media_attachments</code>
entry. Let's assume that <code>a = rec.media_attachments[i]</code>, and then we
have:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Field</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><code>a.type</code></td>
<td>The attachment type</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>a.url</code></td>
<td>The attachment location</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>a.description</code></td>
<td>The attachment text description</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>The <a href="https://docs.joinmastodon.org/entities/MediaAttachment/#type">spec
says</a> the
<code>type</code> can be a few things:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Type</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><code>unknown</code></td>
<td>Unsupported or unrecognized file type</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>image</code></td>
<td>Static image</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>gifv</code></td>
<td>Looping, soundless animation</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>video</code></td>
<td>Video clip</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>audio</code></td>
<td>Audio track</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>I used the <code>type</code> to choose an emoji icon that was appropriate (🖼️ 🎦 🎶
📎), then used the <code>description</code> for the text underlying a link to the
<code>url</code>. One per line. No preview. Kept it simple.</p>
<p>So I had <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> elements that I tucked into main comment <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> where
the "attachment HTML goes here" comment was, above.</p>
<pre><code>&lt;div class="mast-comment-attachment"&gt;
    ICON_EMOJI&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="URL"&gt;DESCRIPTION&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>
<h2>Replying</h2>
<p>100% punted on this. You click the "reply" button on my page and it
takes you straight to my blog post announcement on Mastodon. If you want
to reply, you need a Mastodon account and reply from there.</p>
<p>As such, the comments on my page are "read only". They are just a view
onto the live comments that are on Mastodon.</p>
<h2>Blacklisting</h2>
<p>I wanted to be able to blacklist entire accounts (<code>@user@example.com</code>)
or individual comment IDs (the big number referencing that comment).</p>
<p>This wouldn't change what was actually on Mastodon, but it would filter
out comments I didn't want to see on my blog site.</p>
<p>Remember how I jammed the Mastodon announcement post ID into my static
HTML by putting it in the JavaScript variable <code>MASTODON_POST_ID</code>? Well,
I do a similar thing for the blacklist.</p>
<p>In my environment shell script, I include a blacklist like this:</p>
<pre><code>MASTODON_BLACKLIST=@user@example.com,123456789,345678912
</code></pre>
<p>The numbers can be either a post ID or an account ID.</p>
<p>And my processing scripts turn that into JavaScript that looks like
this:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;script&gt;MASTODON_BLACKLIST = new Set([
    "@user@example.com",
    "123456789",
    "345678912"
]);&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>And then I can pass an entire <code>descendants</code> record into this function
which will return <code>true</code> if it is blacklisted. It tests the comment
record ID, the poster account ID, and the poster account login to see if
any of them are in the blacklist. If so, no comment block is emitted for
that record.</p>
<pre><code>function blacklisted(rec)
{
    const bl = MASTODON_BLACKLIST;

    return bl.has(rec.id) ||
        bl.has(rec.account.id) ||
        bl.has(rec.account.acct);
}
</code></pre>
<h3>Getting the Comment ID</h3>
<p>If I see some offensive content, I can see who posted it because my
comments viewer shows their name. But my comments viewer does not show
their comment post ID.</p>
<p>And what if I want to block just that one post?</p>
<p>What I did was wire it up so that if I held <code>ALT</code> and clicked on the
comment, it would display the comment ID underneath the comment. (And
remove it if I clicked again.)</p>
<h3>Adding to the Blacklist</h3>
<p>If I want to block someone, I do the following.</p>
<ol>
<li>If I want to block their account, I add their account login to my
<code>MASTODON_BLACKLIST</code> environment variable. If I want to block just
that comment, I <code>ALT</code>-click on it to get the ID, and then add that ID
to the blacklist variable.</li>
<li>I rebuild the site. It's static, so I need to get the new blacklist
baked into the HTML. (I could also just rebuild this one page, but
since it takes 0.5 seconds to rebuild the entire site currently, I
just go for it.)</li>
<li>I deploy the site.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Global Blacklist</h3>
<p>Right now I'm blacklisting people and comments on a per-blog-entry
basis. But I'll probably modify my site builder to also support a global
blacklist for people I want to ban on <strong>all</strong> my blog posts.</p>
<p>Hopefully I never have to do that.</p>
<h2>Chicken and Egg</h2>
<p>I have to put the blog post online so I can link to it from the Mastodon
announcement post.</p>
<p>I have to put the Mastodon announcement post online so I can refer to it
from the blog post.</p>
<p>So there's just a moment where the comments don't show. Reviewing the
launch process:</p>
<ol>
<li>Make the blog entry live with no comments.</li>
<li>Link to it from Mastodon in the announcement post.</li>
<li>Take the announcement post ID and use it to rebuild the blog entry.</li>
<li>Re-deploy the blog entry.</li>
</ol>
<p>Of course this could all be automated through the appropriate APIs to
minimize that window, but I'm not going to bother for my low traffic.</p>
<h2>Maiden Voyage</h2>
<p>This is the first post where I'm trying this out. So feel free to reply
and I'll find out where all the breakages are. 😅</p>

During the development of <i>Civilization VII</i>, Firaxis Games reached out to Ben Barnes, chief of the Shawnee Tribe, to discuss the possibility of incorporating Shawnee history into the game. By chance, Chief Barnes is a longtime fan of strategy games, including the <i>Civilization</i> series, and these conversations eventually blossomed into an ongoing relationship of shared knowledge and resources which not only led to more accurate and meaningful in-game depictions, but also real gains in preserving Shawnee language and culture for future generations.</p><p>In 2021, the team at Firaxis began working with the Tribe to make sure the in-game <a href="https://civilization.2k.com/civ-vii/game-guide/civilizations/shawnee/"><u>Shawnee</u></a> civilization* and the visionary leader <a href="https://civilization.2k.com/civ-vii/game-guide/leaders/tecumseh/"><u>Tecumseh</u></a>*—who is included in <i>Civ VII</i>'s expansive roster of playable leaders, voiced by Shawnee actor Dillon Dean—were respectfully represented. In addition to faithfully incorporating the Shawnee language in-game, the developers researched archeological material, studied old family photographs, and consulted with cultural knowledge-keepers while carefully shaping how the Tribe was characterized.</p><p>Then, in February 2025, the next phase of our collaboration culminated in the grand opening of the George "Fife" Blanchard Yaatakciitonooteeki (Recording Studio) in Miami, Oklahoma. Paying homage to George Blanchard, a fluent Shawnee language speaker and visionary leader in his own right, the studio is fully equipped to produce audio recordings of the highest quality and support the Tribe's<a href="https://library.municode.com/tribes_and_tribal_nations/shawnee_tribe/munidocs/munidocs?nodeId=474b75806676f" target="_blank"> <u>ongoing preservation efforts</u></a>. The Shawnee Tribe is almost halfway through its "Decade of the Shawnee Language," and this new space will significantly bolster their work.</p><p>Of course, it also warmed our hearts to see Chief Ben Barnes as thrilled as we are to showcase the Shawnee in <i>Civilization VII</i>. It's been an honor to work alongside the Tribe in this fulfilling partnership, and now that the game has launched worldwide, we can't wait for more players to build something they believe in while embodying Tecumseh and leading the Shawnee in <i>Civ VII </i>for years to come!</p><p><i>*Tecumseh leader and Shawnee civilization are part of the Tecumseh and Shawnee Pack DLC. The Tecumseh and Shawnee Pack is included in the Deluxe and Founders Editions of Civilization VII. It will also be available for separate purchase starting April 15, 2025 (base game required, date subject to change).</i> </p></div><!--[--><!--]--><!----></article><!----></div></div>]]></description>

<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">What is mdq?</h2><a id="user-content-what-is-mdq" aria-label="Permalink: What is mdq?" href="#what-is-mdq"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">mdq aims to do for Markdown what jq does for JSON: provide an easy way to zero in on specific parts of a document.</p>
<p dir="auto">For example, GitHub PRs are Markdown documents, and some organizations have specific templates with checklists for all
reviewers to complete. Enforcing these often requires ugly regexes that are a pain to write and worse to debug. Instead,
you can (for example) ask mdq for all uncompleted tasks:</p>

<p dir="auto">mdq is available under the Apache 2.0 or MIT licenses, at your option. I am open to other permissive licenses, if you
have one you prefer.</p>

</li>
<li>Download binaries from <a href="https://github.com/yshavit/mdq/releases/latest">the latest release</a> (or any other release, of course).</li>
<li>You can also grab the binaries from the latest <a href="https://github.com/yshavit/mdq/actions/workflows/build-release.yml">build-release</a> workflow run. You must be logged into GitHub to do
that (this is GitHub's limitation, not mine). You'll have to <code>chmod +x</code> them before you can run them.</li>
</ol>
<details>
<summary>Security concerns</summary>
The release and latest-workflow binaries are built on GitHub's servers, so if you trust my code (and dependencies), and you trust GitHub,
you can trust the binaries. See <a href="https://github.com/yshavit/mdq/wiki/Release-binaries">https://github.com/yshavit/mdq/wiki/Release-binaries</a> for information on how to verify them.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>Hey folks,</p>
<p>The UK’s <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2023/50/contents" rel="ugc">Online Safety Act</a> is scheduled to take effect on <strong>March 16, 2025</strong>.
Lobsters can’t comply with it and needs your help to avoid having to geoblock the UK.</p>
<p>The Online Safety Act regulates most sites where users can interact with each other.
The law explicitly claims authority over all forums with <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2023/50/section/227" rel="ugc">visitors located in the UK</a>, regardless of where they are hosted or the nationality of their owners.</p>
<p>As a practical matter, Lobsters can’t comply.
The OSA is written for commercial sites far bigger than this <a href="https://lobste.rs/s/95uler/would_there_be_interest_patreon_for#c_9l58ia" rel="ugc">non-commercial, hobbyist</a> forum.
The regulator’s <a href="https://www.ofcom.org.uk/online-safety/" rel="ugc">statements</a> include many long, cross-referenced legalese documents
(an incomplete sample, because I can’t find a directory):
<a href="https://www.ofcom.org.uk/siteassets/resources/documents/online-safety/information-for-industry/illegal-harms/summary-of-each-chapter.pdf?v=387528" rel="ugc">1</a>
<a href="https://www.ofcom.org.uk/siteassets/resources/documents/online-safety/information-for-industry/roadmap/2024/ofcoms-approach-to-implementing-the-online-safety-act-2024.pdf?v=383285" rel="ugc">2</a>
<a href="https://www.ofcom.org.uk/siteassets/resources/documents/online-safety/information-for-industry/illegal-harms/risk-assessment-guidance-and-risk-profiles.pdf?v=388231" rel="ugc">3</a>
<a href="https://www.ofcom.org.uk/siteassets/resources/documents/online-safety/information-for-industry/illegal-harms/summary-of-our-decisions.pdf?v=387523" rel="ugc">4</a>
<a href="https://www.ofcom.org.uk/siteassets/resources/documents/online-safety/information-for-industry/illegal-harms/illegal-content-codes-of-practice-for-user-to-user-services.pdf?v=387711" rel="ugc">5</a>.
Sites are required to produce lengthy documentation about their features, practices, and risks - both up-front and as they moderate.
Attempting to understand which sections apply and how to comply would be a huge project.
Doing so <em>correctly</em> would require legal advice we <a href="https://lobste.rs/s/ffd4xt/lfgss_microcosm_shutting_down_16th_march#c_cdfjmr" rel="ugc">can’t afford</a>.
The cost in time and money to implement the bureaucratic processes it demands also outstrip a hobbyist forum.</p>
<p>There’s also an ideological matter, that Lobsters is not a UK entity or operated in its jurisdiction.
The OSA isn’t written to directly regulate the UK’s occupants, it exerts authority over non-UK maintainers of sites that UK occupants read.
Even if the OSA was proportionate and reasonable, complying would encourage every jurisdiction to write similarly broad laws.</p>
<p>The OSA’s civil penalties run up to $22 million USD, and it includes also criminal penalties.
While poor and despotic countries have written laws to curtail freedom of speech internationally online (usually a broadly over-enforced “no criticizing the rulers”), as a practical matter those have been vanishingly unlikely to be enforced against Western citizens.
Because the UK is wealthy, powerful, and threatening large penalties, I can’t ignore the risk that the UK attempts to enforce the law against Lobsters, perhaps to make a political point against American Big Tech as <a href="https://www.verdict.co.uk/osa-mandates-illegal-content-risk-assessments/" rel="ugc">promised by the regulator</a>.</p>
<p>So the current, bad plan is that Lobsters will <a href="https://github.com/lobsters/lobsters/commit/259b9117edb8dfff289b54a68a17af6461f8815b" rel="ugc">geoblock the UK before the law takes effect</a> on March 16.
While the inaccuracy of IP databases and availability of VPNs mean that this can’t be perfectly accurate, unambiguously blocking UK occupants as effectively as we can is the only course I see to substantially reduce the risk the OSA is enforced against the site.</p>
<p><strong>UK users, we need you to please help improve this situation.</strong>
You have the local knowledge and political representation needed to address the OSA.
I can see a couple courses of action that would sufficiently mitigate the risk:</p>
<ul>
<li>Some kind of guidance or waiver from the implementing regulator <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ofcom" rel="ugc">Ofcom</a> that this law won’t apply to Lobsters individually or as a class of non-UK, small, and/or noncommercial forums.</li>
<li>Delay or cancellation of the Parliamentary approval required for the regulator’s guidance to be adopted into legal effect, at least until something like the previous option can happen.</li>
<li>Legal advice from a UK lawyer that the law does not apply to Lobsters for some plausible reason.</li>
<li>A statement from the US <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_State" rel="ugc">Department of State</a> that it does not believe the law applies to American entities and a commitment to defend them against it.</li>
<li>Something else I haven’t thought of that would greatly reduce the risk the OSA is enforced against Lobsters.</li>
</ul>
<p>I’m reaching out to people I know who also run sites that will be affected by the OSA, in and out of the UK, to ask how they’re handling this.
I’m also reaching out to organizations that focus on online rights like the EFF and <a href="https://www.openrightsgroup.org/campaign/stop-state-censorship-of-online-speech/" rel="ugc">ORG</a>.
I’ll post update in the comments below so this story will be the best single resource to watch for news.</p>
<p>There’s more background info and thoughts in the <a href="https://lobste.rs/s/ffd4xt/lfgss_microcosm_shutting_down_16th_march" rel="ugc">story on LFGSS shutting down</a>, <a href="https://push.cx/stream/2024-12-19-uk-online-safety-act" rel="ugc">previous</a> and <a href="https://push.cx/stream/2025-01-06-hello-i-am-your-constitutent-from-chicago" rel="ugc">today’s</a> office hours streams, which include searchable transcripts.</p>
<p>There are a lot of distracting off-topic rabbit holes here like recent political events, international diplomacy, defining “free speech”, pretending to practice UK law, and many more - please do try to stay focused on the existential problem at hand.</p>
<p>Thanks for your help,</p>
<ul>
<li>Peter</li>
</ul>

																<p>Doctored: Fraud, Arrogance, and Tragedy in the Quest to Cure Alzheimer's</p>
																
									</section>

				<p>In December 2021, I fell into one of the biggest and most disturbing stories of my career. A credible whistleblower with strong credentials in dementia research tipped me to a major case of apparent misconduct in his field. He produced convincing evidence that lab studies at the heart of the dominant hypothesis for the cause of Alzheimer’s disease might have been based on bogus data. My investigative story for Science magazine in July 2022 exposed those findings and their far-reaching significance, drawing global media attention. But I didn’t suspect it would begin a yearslong, high-stakes journey into hidden, sordid corners of science and medicine.</p>
<p>Just a couple months later, two giant drug companies announced what many described as one of the most dramatic developments in the history of Alzheimer’s. For decades scientists had struggled fruitlessly to offer hope to millions of patients who suffer the gradual, debilitating decline in their ability to think and remember loved ones, or enjoy self-aware lives. Finally, a major test seemed to prove that a new medication could alter the course of the disease.</p>
<p>That drug, Leqembi, strips away from brain tissues the sticky plaques and other toxic compounds that comprise a substance called “amyloid-beta.” In so doing- said its makers, experts in their pay, and cheerleading <span>journalists—Leqembi definitively validated the “amyloid hypothesis,;” the long-debated notion that Alzheimer’s is caused by the buildup accumulation of amyloid in the brain. If true, its removal would lead to a cure. </span></p>
<p><span>Understandable excitement—hope against hope—greeted Leqembi. Alzheimer’s afflicts nearly seven million Americans, about one in every nine over the age of sixty-five, making it the fifth leading cause of death among the elderly. Up to 360,000 adults in the prime of life-including people as young as thirty-suffer from early onset Alzheimer’s. Comparable figures in the United Kingdom, Europe, and the rest of the world have made the leading cause of dementia a global scourge. And dementia totals will more than double by 2050. </span></p>
<p><span>In the United States alone, more than eleven million family members care for fathers and mothers and grandparents who have fallen prey to the cruel disease that begins by gradually stealing a person’s mastery of everyday life, then cherished memories, and finally the sense of self that makes each of us human. Alzheimer’s families face incalculable emotional costs—including lost dreams of retirement and pleasures with loving partners. For many, the disease also means financial impoverishment. Family caregivers in the United States provided a staggering $350 billion in care to Alzheimer’s patients in 2023—nearly matching the amount paid for dementia care by all other sources, including Medicare. </span></p>

		</a>
		<p><span>Unfortunately, the Leqembi “breakthrough” amounted to just this: Alzheimer’s patients lost their ability to remember, think clearly, and live normal lives only slightly less rapidly than others taking a bogus treatment. The drug offers so modest a benefit that doctors and patients might not perceive any effect whatsoever. </span></p>
<p><span>It was the latest example of the exaggeration, hype, and sheer fakery and fraud that has characterized Alzheimer’s research for decades. By then I realized that I could tell the full story of how the hunt to cure the insidious and chilling illness went awry. I had to show why billions of dollars in spending by governments, pharma companies, and philanthropies had done little for desperate patients. </span></p>
<p><span>For decades, proponents of the dominant amyloid hypothesis have sidelined, starved for resources, and even bullied rebels behind other promising notions of how to treat Alzheimer’s. If Leqembi and look-alikes with similarly lackluster results hold sway in drug development and dominate mindshare among patients and doctors, a genuine Alzheimer’s cure might become even more remote. </span></p>
<p><span>Many patients take a leap of faith in such drugs as a hedge against creeping fear. Big pharma companies, among others, bet their bottom lines on that basic instinct. Alzheimer’s research has offered endless opportunities for advancement and riches to corporate shysters and ruthlessly ambitious scientists who cut corners or engage in brazen deception. I set out to unmask decades of arrogance, greed, fabulism, and error that have emptied research coffers and littered the drug development landscape with failure after failure. </span></p>
<p><span>My reporting followed the path of a junior professor who faced great personal risks to challenge his field’s institutional powers. He uncovered hidden and fabricated data instrumental to keeping the amyloid hypothesis supreme at the expense of other possible solutions. As I dug deeper, a scientific under world of deceit and lies rose into view. I gradually saw an opportunity to help reshape how scientists, doctors, and patients understand one of the most terrible human afflictions-and add realistic hope in the process. </span></p>
<p><span>The story begins where it must, with a deeply determined patient struggling with dementia. He dared to hope that he could be one of the first people living with Alzheimer’s to find a transformative treatment.</span></p>

<p dir="auto">Since the release of <code>Gnome 43.0</code>, more and more built-in apps use <code>libadwaita</code> now, and libadwaita does not support custom themes, which means we cannot change the appearance of app using libadwaita through <code>gnome-tweaks</code> or <code>dconf-editor</code>. For users who love custom themes, it’s really sucks!</p>
<p dir="auto">Anyway if anybody who still want to custom themes we can only do this way:</p>
<p dir="auto">that is to use the <code>theme file</code> to overwrite the <code>gtk-4.0 configuration file</code>. The result is that only Fixed making all gtk4 apps use one theme and cannot be switched (even can not switch to dark mode) If you want to change a theme, you can only re-overwrite the <code>gtk-4.0 configuration file</code> with a new theme, I know this method is not perfect, But at the moment it is only possible to continue using themes for libadwaita's apps ...</p>

<p>(TL;DR:  Ultima VII: Revisited is a replacement engine for Ultima VII that presents the game in 3D and fixes various issue with the game.  Go to the <a href="https://www.u7revisited.com/downloads/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="Downloads tab">Downloads tab</a> to find out how to get it.)</p>

<p><em>Preview of coming attractions.</em></p>



<p><strong>My name is Anthony Salter and I love Ultima.</strong></p>



<p>The Ultima Series of classic RPGs was created by Richard Garriott (also known as Lord British) along with a bunch of his friends.  It represents, in my opinion, the epitome of the ingenuity, beauty and superb design of DOS games.</p>



<p>Ultima games were designed in a unique way.  Garriott would build an RPG world, filling it with merchants, monsters and dungeons…but no characters or plot.  That would only come after the world had been fully created.</p>



<p>And the worlds he created were as real as he could make them. Day/night cycles, phases of the moon, names and schedules for every character, and a complex dialogue system that required players to actually find keywords in the world to ask characters about. Many fans, myself included, consider Ultima VII to be the epitome of the series’ design, doing things that even now modern games can’t.</p>



<figure><video autoplay="" controls="" loop="" muted="" src="https://www.u7revisited.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Exult-Ultima7-Engine-2023-08-06-18-44-51-1.mp4"></video></figure>



<p><em>I just changed a baby’s diaper.  If I want, I can keep the dirty diaper and throw it at an enemy to make them run away in disgust.</em></p>



<p>So why do people have so much trouble getting into the game nowadays?  Why do reviews like this exist?</p>



<figure><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" width="1024" height="339" src="https://www.u7revisited.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/U7Review-1024x339.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.u7revisited.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/U7Review-1024x339.png 1024w, https://www.u7revisited.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/U7Review-300x99.png 300w, https://www.u7revisited.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/U7Review-768x254.png 768w, https://www.u7revisited.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/U7Review.png 1148w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption>A modern gamer tries to play Ultima VII.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Well, they exist because of this.</p>



<figure><video autoplay="" controls="" loop="" muted="" src="https://www.u7revisited.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Exult-Ultima7-Engine-2023-08-06-15-57-44.mp4"></video></figure>



<p><em>That’s not a video issue, that’s the actual frame rate of the game.</em></p>



<p>And this.</p>



<figure><video autoplay="" controls="" loop="" muted="" src="https://www.u7revisited.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Exult-Ultima7-Engine-2023-08-06-16-09-10.mp4"></video></figure>



<p><em>Your companions are bottomless pits and are incapable of feeding themselves.</em></p>



<p>And this.</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" width="640" height="400" src="https://www.u7revisited.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/u7dark-1.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.u7revisited.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/u7dark-1.png 640w, https://www.u7revisited.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/u7dark-1-300x188.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px"></figure>



<p><em>Yes, that’s right – palette effects that make the environment darker also make the user interface darker.</em></p>



<p>Now, those of us who played the game back in the day put up with all of this because we didn’t feel like we were “putting up” with anything.  Previous games had far worse issues, and Ultima VII played better and presented a more cohesive world than anything that came before.</p>



<p>But, yes, it feels clunky and dated today.  And while there’s an amazing replacement engine called Exult that helps with a lot of this, its goal is to replicate the original game as closely as possible, which means it can’t solve Ultima VII’s greatest problem – that it was simply ahead of its time.  Ultima VII is a 3D world stuck in a 2D engine.</p>



<p>Every object in the world has width, depth and height, and the world itself consists of 3072x3072x16 tile blocks.  Ultima VII was in development from 1990 to 1992 (shipping in April ’92), and even though software 3D was taking off at the time, it hadn’t been designed as a 3D game (even though it used a 3D world) and that contributed to its issues.</p>



<p>But software-rendered 3D games with isometric perspectives started coming out very soon after Ultima VII, and every time I saw one I thought, “This is what Ultima VII should have looked like.”</p>



<figure><video autoplay="" controls="" loop="" muted="" src="https://www.u7revisited.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/DOSBox-0.74-2.1-Cpu-speed_-165000-cycles-Frameskip-0-Program_-KEEPER-2023-01-25-00-28-04.mp4"></video></figure>



<p>Bullfrog Productions’ <em>Dungeon Keeper</em>.</p>



<figure><video autoplay="" controls="" loop="" muted="" src="https://www.u7revisited.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/MYTH-2023-01-25-01-02-02.mp4"></video></figure>



<p><em>Myth II: Soulblighter</em>, by Bungie (yes, that Bungie).</p>



<figure><video autoplay="" controls="" loop="" muted="" src="https://www.u7revisited.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/grandiaintro-1.mp4"></video></figure>



<p><em>Grandia</em>, by Game Arts.  Just look at that city flyby!</p>



<p>So my goal with Ultima VII: Revisited is to present the world of Britannia in a 3D engine, using a more modern (but not too modern) presentation.  I will also be smoothing off some of the rough corners, like the inventory and combat systems.  My goal is to create a new way of playing Ultima VII that will allow the gamer who posted the review above to understand exactly why Ultima VII is so amazing.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
  

  
  

  <div>
  <blockquote>
<p>The very short version: it is madness to continue transferring the running of European societies and governments to <a href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-inauguration-tech-billionaires-zuckerberg-musk-wealth-0896bfc3f50d941d62cebc3074267ecd">American clouds</a>. Not only is it a terrible idea given the kind of things the “<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/king-trump-rcna192912">King of America</a>” keeps saying, the legal sophistry used to justify such transfers, like the <a href="https://berthub.eu/tkconv/document.html?nummer=2025D07118">nonsense letter the Dutch cabinet sent last week</a>, has now been <a href="https://www.lawfaremedia.org/article/trump-s-sacking-of-pclob-members-threatens-data-privacy">invalidated</a> by Trump himself. And why are we doing this? Convenience. But it is very scary to make yourself 100% dependent on the goodwill of the American government merely because it is convenient. So let’s not.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We used to think that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_stages_of_grief">grieving went through five stages</a>: denial, protest, bargaining, depression, and acceptance. We no longer really believe in that theory, but when it comes to dealing with the US, many Europeans are however currently busily negotiating with reality.</p>
<p>Some of my more activist friends are already further along in their thinking, and clearly see that it is ridiculous to move our governments over to the American clouds at this stage. They rightly accused me of <a href="https://mastodon.nl/@bert_hubert/114015060901981839">fooling myself</a> by aiming for ‘<a href="https://berthub.eu/articles/posts/communicating-without-musk-and-trump-cloud-kootwijk/">at least not moving EVERYTHING to America</a>’, while accepting that we’d still relinquish the majority of our systems.</p>
<p>Acknowledging painful changes <a href="https://fosstodon.org/@bert_hubert/111402692560132040">is not easy</a>. In the 1930s, the Netherlands realized the world was becoming pretty dangerous, and therefore <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_1047_battlecruiser">planned to buy weapons</a> and ammunition from Germany (!). However, the ordered weaponry was not delivered on time, or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_bombing_of_Rotterdam">at least not in the way you’d want</a>.</p>
<p>“Negotiating with reality” is for example <a href="https://berthub.eu/tkconv/document.html?nummer=2025D07118">the letter three Dutch government ministers sent last week</a>. Is it wise to report every applicant to your secret service directly to Google, just to get some statistics? The answer the government sent: even if we do that, we don’t, because “<a href="https://mastodon.nl/@bert_hubert/114031686141633446">Google cannot see the IP address</a>”. This is complete nonsense of course, but it’s the kind of thing you tell yourself (or let others tell you) when you don’t want to face reality (or can’t).</p>
<center>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://berthub.eu/articles/google-ip.png"><br>
Live image of IP addresses that, according to the Dutch government, don’t go to Google, <a href="https://cookie-script.com/blog/ip-anonymization/amp">but actually do go to Google</a></p>
</center>
<p>And why are we reporting all these job applicants to America? Because it’s <em>cheaper</em>, they say. The European alternative statistical software, which is already paid for and actually running on the government job site, isn’t as user-friendly either, they say. Nonsense.</p>
<p>With all sorts of magic legal spells  like “<a href="https://www.autoriteitpersoonsgegevens.nl/en/themes/basic-gdpr/gdpr-in-practice/data-protection-impact-assessment-dpia">DPIAs</a>” and “<a href="https://highberg.com/insights/how-do-you-conduct-a-dtia">DTIAs</a>,” organizations attempt to justify transferring our data and processes to the US. <a href="https://www.privacycompany.eu/">There is a whole industry that has been aiding and abetting this process for years</a>. People also <a href="https://berthub.eu/articles/posts/servers-in-de-eu-eigen-sleutels-helpt-het/">fool themselves that special keys and “servers in the EU”</a> will get you “<a href="https://www.ncsc.nl/binaries/ncsc/documenten/publicaties/2022/augustus/16/cloud-act-memo/Cloud+Act+Memo+Final.pdf">a safe space</a>” within the American cloud. <a href="https://edri.org/our-work/promises-unkept-the-eu-us-data-privacy-framework-under-fire/">It won’t</a>.</p>
<p>All these efforts are not about whether it is <em>wise</em> to hand over control of our data to the US. It is all about if it is <em>lawful</em>.</p>
<p>But it won’t be lawful either — the legal basis for sharing personal data with American companies is dead since Donald Trump has neutered the special court <a href="https://noyb.eu/en/us-cloud-soon-illegal-trump-punches-first-hole-eu-us-data-deal">that would make such transfers legal</a>.</p>

<p>We now have the bizarre situation that anyone with any sense can see <a href="https://www.lemonde.fr/en/france/article/2025/02/19/macron-holds-second-day-of-emergency-talks-on-ukraine_6738336_7.html">that America is no longer a reliable partner</a>, and that <a href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-inauguration-tech-billionaires-zuckerberg-musk-wealth-0896bfc3f50d941d62cebc3074267ecd">the entire US business world bows to Trump’s dictatorial will</a>, but we STILL are doing <a href="https://www.utoday.nl/news/75233/waarom-mag-chatgpt-reclame-maken-bij-surf">everything we can</a> to transfer entire governments and most of our own businesses to their clouds.</p>
<p>Not only is it scary to have all your data available to US spying, it is also <a href="https://berthub.eu/articles/posts/publicspaces-digitale-autonomie-7-juni-2024/">a huge risk for your business/government continuity</a>. From now on, all our business processes can be brought to a halt <a href="https://berthub.eu/articles/posts/digitale-soevereiniteit-rijksoverheid-13-februari-2025/">with the push of a button in the US</a>. And not only will everything then stop, will we ever get our data back? <a href="https://berthub.eu/articles/ransom-cloud.jpeg">Or are we being held hostage</a>? This is not a theoretical scenario, <a href="https://berthub.eu/articles/posts/servers-in-de-eu-eigen-sleutels-helpt-het/#wat-als-er-ruzie-is">something like this has already happened</a>.</p>
<p>Here and there, some parts of at least the Dutch government are deciding <a href="https://berthub.eu/tkconv/document.html?nummer=2025D06767">not to <em>migrate EVERYTHING</em> to the US</a> (kudos to the government workers who are fighting for this!).</p>
<p>But even here, the details of Dutch policy are that our data will only ‘<a href="https://berthub.eu/tkconv/document.html?nummer=2025D06768">for now</a>’ stay on our own servers. Experts are also doubtful whether it’s actually possible with the current “partial cloud” plan to keep the data here <em>exclusively</em>.</p>
<p>And then we come to the apparent reason why <a href="https://berthub.eu/articles/posts/de-hele-overheid-naar-de-cloud-dat-is-een-politiek-besluit/">we are putting our head on Trump’s chopping block</a>: “American software is just so easy to use”.</p>
<p>Personally, I don’t know many fans of MS Teams, Office, and Outlook. We are, however, very <em>used</em> to these software products. We’ve become quite good at using them.</p>
<p>But this brings us to the unbearable conclusion that we are entrusting all our data and business processes to the new <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/king-trump-rcna192912">King of America</a>… because we can’t be bothered to <em>get used to</em> a <a href="https://www.libreoffice.org/">different word processor</a>, or make an effort to <a href="https://berthub.eu/articles/posts/open-source-by-itself-is-no-alternative-for-big-tech/">support other software</a>.</p>
<p>Written down like this, it seems pretty bizarre, and that’s because it is. It’s also not easy to realize that <a href="https://www.vpro.nl/buitenhof/lees/in-de-uitzending/2025/26-januari.html">our relationship with America is over after 80 years</a>. It took time for me as well to accept that.</p>
<p>But it really is over. Stop the nonsense of complicated and long-winded legal arguments about why it would be legal to put our citizens’ data in the US. These arguments are not only naïve—they are also no longer true. The US has dismantled the official privacy framework. <a href="https://fosstodon.org/@bert_hubert/114032472494922878">The deal is dead</a>.</p>
<p>So stop surrendering our society to America. Have the courage to use <a href="https://opendesk.eu/en/ueber/">different software</a> and services. <a href="https://opendesk.eu/en/">Even if it takes some getting used to</a>.</p>
<p>And maybe, once in a while, European governments should have the guts to actually attempt to buy something else. <a href="https://berthub.eu/articles/posts/is-europe-just-not-good-at-innovating/">Innovation doesn’t just happen without the promise of revenues</a>. Spending just 1% on alternatives would mean billions of euros.</p>
<p>That’s a very small price to pay for a society that isn’t 100% dependent on “MAGA”, Donald Trump and Elon Musk. The world is <a href="https://berthub.eu/articles/posts/cyber-security-pre-war-reality-check/">far too dangerous</a> for that.</p>

            <div>
                
                <p>There's a cute math puzzle that can be interesting to folks on very
different levels:</p>
<blockquote>
Given exactly four instances of the digit 2 and some target natural number,
use any mathematical operations to generate the target number with these 2s,
using no other digits.</blockquote>
<p>Some examples can be done by elementary school kids:</p>
<p>In middle school, kids learn about exponents, factorials, etc. which expands the
range considerably:</p>
<p>Then come the tricks; for example, the number 22 (twenty two) can be seen as
a valid use of two 2s, and so on; so we can have:</p>
<p>Getting to 7 is notoriously difficult, but if you allow even more mathematical
tools like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma_function">Gamma function</a>,
it becomes easy:</p>
<p>The more math skill people have, the more numbers they can make. See
<a href="https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1034122/get-the-numbers-from-0-30-by-using-the-number-2-four-times">this thread</a>
for some fun concoctions using integrals, repeating fractions and combinatorial
operators. One of my favorite examples involves complex numbers:</p>
<p>So the fun doesn't end even after one graduates from university! In fact, this
seems to have been a favorite pastime for mathematicians in the 1920s. Until
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Dirac">Paul Dirac</a> ruined it for everyone
by finding a general solution for every number.</p>
<p>It's all about nested square roots:</p>
<p>If the square root is applied <em>n</em> times:</p>
<p>All that's left now is some base-2 logarithms:</p>
<p>And another:</p>
<p>This leads to the general formula:</p>
<p>There's just one small wrinkle: it uses <em>three</em> instances of the digit 2, not
four. This is easy to amend, however; since , we can replace
any single digit with that and get exactly four:</p>
<p>One may claim this is cheating, but it seems to be in line with the rules of
the puzzle! Note that the entity <em>n</em> doesn't actually appear anywhere - it's
just a helper to count the number of repeated square roots. For example, another
way to express 7 is:</p>
<p>There are exactly four 2s, and this uses only reasonable, elemental math
operations to do the calculation. It's clear that <em>any</em> number can be expressed
this way; the only challenge is properly drawing all those square roots!</p>

      <p>A man who has been released from prison after 30 years for a crime he says he never committed has been readjusting to life - and getting used to just how connected people are now. </p><p>Gordon Cordeiro was jailed in 1994 over the murder of Timothy Blaisdell on the island of Maui, but due to new DNA evidence his conviction was overturned on Friday.</p>
<p>Speaking about his first impression of the outside world following his release from Maui Community Correctional Center, Mr Cordeiro, who has always maintained his innocence, said he has been trying to get used to how connected people are.</p><p>"Everybody is looking at their phones," he said, during his first Zoom interview since leaving prison.</p><p>Mr Cordeiro also commented on the new DNA evidence which led to his release, telling the Associated Press news agency: "Thank God for new DNA. Technology is awesome."</p>

<p>The first thing he did after he was freed was visit his mother's grave as he said he had constantly thought about her during his time behind bars.</p><p>Mr Cordeiro's mother, Paulette, died aged 49 in September 1994 from ALS, often called Lou Gehrig's disease. Her son was arrested the following month.</p><p>"Thanks for looking over me. Keeping me safe," Mr Cordeiro recalled saying at her grave.</p><p>In a picture provided by his sister, he can be seen kneeling graveside, with a garland of flowers he was given upon release draped over the headstone.</p>

<p>Announcing her decision to free him, Judge Kirstin Hamman ruled new evidence, including DNA test results, would likely change the outcome of another trial.</p><p>Maui County Prosecuting Attorney Andrew Martin said he plans to appeal against the decision and seek to have bail imposed on Mr Cordeiro's release.</p><p>Mr Cordeiro's first trial ended in a hung jury, with only one juror voting to convict him.</p><p>But he was later found guilty of murder, robbery and attempted murder and sentenced to life without the possibility of parole.</p>

<p>While I’m usually blogging about triathlon, today I want to discuss one of my other hobbies, scuba diving. Diving in the UK usually requires diving in a dry suit (not always, but trust me, it’s a LOT more comfortable). One of the biggest concerns that many have is about how to deal with the bladder situation. My good friend <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.facebook.com/DavidCAllen1979" target="_blank">Dave Allen</a> and I, get approached often about diving with a pee valve. Dave is a dive instructor with <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://rec2tecdiving.co.uk/" target="_blank">Rec2Tec</a> and we’ve co-authored this topic, you can head over <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://rec2tecdiving.co.uk/fluid-dynamics/" target="_blank">here</a> to see how the boys do it….</p>



<p>I’ve been scuba diving for over 25 years, mostly in wetsuits or semi-dry suits. Back in the 90s, my first introduction to a dry suit involved VERY cold water. In fact, it was an ice dive. Since then, I’ve dove in various places: cold water, dark water, deep dives…but chose locations that were a bit more tropical or avoided winter diving, using wetsuits or even a semi-dry suit. In a wetsuit, when you have to pee, the solution is easy… you just go. In a dry suit, not so much. Back in the 90’s there wasn’t a convenient solution for women using dry suits, except for holding it and dehydrating yourself in hopes you could complete a dive without peeing yourself.</p>



<p>For some years there were some solutions for men (a zip at the front of the dry suit) or even just an external catheter system. For women though, there had been a major gap in the market. It was in 2015 that I learned about the ability to install a P-valve for women. I turned my ‘never again’ approach into ‘okay, let’s try this!’</p>



<p>I just want to start off and say, I have a bladder the size of a walnut. More than that, I drink A LOT of water and I have had some surgeries on my girl parts, so I do not have a bladder made of steel (although, I envy people that do). Cold water accelerates that for me, so I have to pee even more.</p>



<p>On most recreational dives I’m okay without a pee valve (anything under and hour). I am, admittedly, usually the first person to head to the toilets (or head) when exiting the water. UK diving really requires a dry suit and in 2015, I went to the dive show and got fitted for my new dry suit and pee valve. I was soooo excited. But… I was not sure how to use it, or really anything about peeing in dry suit. I did a lot of research, had some ‘interesting’ trial and error moments, so I thought I share this with you in hopes that it helps not only educate you on how to use a p-valve, but also helps you decide which path to take.</p>



<h2><strong>Why the p-valve?</strong></h2>



<p>For those of you asking, what are my options for diving in a dry suit? Well… you can just hold it (again, if you have a bladder of steel), nappies/diapers, the p-valve, or just pee in the suit (which is gross and defeats the whole purpose of the dry suit, right?). I am personally not inclined to use a diaper, the thought of sitting in my own urine does not appeal to me. Also, they leak. Again, not appealing. I have done too many dives where I’m sprinting for the toilets post-dive (usually ripping a wrist seal), not being able to get out of my suit fast enough.</p>



<p>When I am diving in a dry suit I intake much less water than I normally would, this isn’t healthy as it can lead to DCI (decompression sickness, etc). Hydration is important when diving repetitive dives and I also have a bit of anxiety as well about having to pee on a dive. I don’t know about you, but when I have to pee, it really distracted me on my dives and getting into more technical diving, this was not ideal. I needed a solution that eased my mind and my bladder.</p>



<p>So…enter in the P-valve.</p>



<p>The P-valve (in theory) allows you to dive without a diaper, eliminates bladder discomfort by enabling a person to glue (yes, glue – we’ll come to that in a minute) an external catheter to their lady parts, hooked into a tube that exits out the dry suit leg using a one-way valve. It’s a pretty awesome invention, but it’s not quite as simple as ‘plug it in and go’.</p>



<h2><strong>Which p-valve/catheter system should I buy?</strong></h2>



<p>If you don’t have a P-valve installed in your dry suit, you can have one installed at any time by the manufacturer or a local professional. While in theory you can do it yourself, I highly recommend allowing an experienced professional to install the valve itself to avoid leaking. I personally had mine installed at the time of ordering my Hollis dry suit, they used a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://www.sitech.se/home.aspx" target="_blank">SI TECH one-way valve</a>. At the time of writing this I have an <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.othree.co.uk/" target="_blank">O3 custom dry suit</a> on order and they use <a href="https://www.othree.co.uk/apv-care-maintenance/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">their own custom valv</a>e. Regardless of the brand, get the one-way P-valve installed in your suit.</p>

<p>There are various options for external catheters for ladies on the market today. The one that I found that got the best reviews (and seemed the most logical for me) is the <a href="https://www.she-p.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">She-P system.</a> The She-P system is made from silicone and each one is made by hand and of fantastic quality.</p>



<p>At the time of purchase the She-P Classic was the one recommended. I bought the whole kit for it, which includes medical grade adhesive, removal wipes and the tubing required to attach it to the P-valve in my dry suit. You can find the classic version <a href="https://www.she-p.com/product/ready-to-pee-kit-with-she-p-classic/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.</p>



<p>I would honestly consider the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.she-p.com/product/ready-to-pee-kit-with_she-p_3-0/" target="_blank">She-P version 3.0</a>. This will be my next upgrade soon. I explain why down below.</p>



<h2><strong>Preparing for the She-P</strong></h2>



<p>This is the area that where I had the most questions (and also, where most people ask me how this whole thing works). This article can be a delicate subject (no pun intended!), so let’s talk about the configuration of the She-P itself:</p>



<div><figure><img data-attachment-id="717" data-permalink="https://peeifyouwanttogofaster.com/imagegen/" data-orig-file="https://peeifyouwanttogofaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/imagegen.jpg" data-orig-size="573,382" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="imagegen" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://peeifyouwanttogofaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/imagegen.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://peeifyouwanttogofaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/imagegen.jpg?w=573" loading="lazy" width="573" height="382" src="https://peeifyouwanttogofaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/imagegen.jpg?w=573" alt="" srcset="https://peeifyouwanttogofaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/imagegen.jpg 573w, https://peeifyouwanttogofaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/imagegen.jpg?w=150 150w, https://peeifyouwanttogofaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/imagegen.jpg?w=300 300w" sizes="(max-width: 573px) 100vw, 573px"><figcaption>She-P Classic</figcaption></figure></div>

<p>The She-P needs to adhere from the perineum to the front of you, with the tube sticking out the front. Keep this in mind when reading the below in terms of which area to prep.</p>



<p>Whether you’re using the She-P Classic or She-P 3.0 the preparation for attachment is the same.</p>



<ul><li>Remove the hair from your lady parts. I recommend shaving, waxing or laser hair removal. Shaving can cause irritation, if that is the case, look into waxing or laser. You don’t want to irritate the skin as you’re about to put some glue onto it. How much hair to remove? Think Brazilian, you need to clear the hair from the perineum to the front of your pubic bone. <em>You can attach the device with stubble, but it does not make for a pleasant removal experience, and could potentially cause a leak when in use.</em></li></ul>



<ul><li>My advice, just go bald down there ladies…. I personally went with laser hair removal years ago and that’s paying off tenfold now.</li></ul>



<ul><li>Make sure there are not any moisturizers or oil on your skin. Taking a shower on the morning when you’re going to attach the device is recommended. Use a non-oily soap to make sure the glue can adhere to your skin.</li></ul>



<p><strong>Attaching the She-P</strong></p>



<p>The first time you attach She-P I recommend that you have someone witness attaching it, it provides a great amount of humor. It wasn’t my first time, but I was still experimenting with my device, and I was with my friend Sandi, she wanted to see how I did it in person. So, in the middle of the car park at Stoney Cove, we attempted to attach the catheter in the middle of December. Not only was it cold out, but we couldn’t stop laughing. Definitely ensure your first attempt is at home and test it in the shower.</p>



<p>To ready the device to be attached, I do honestly recommend a mirror setup below you to see where you are attaching it, else you’ll end up like me, thinking you glued your butthole (true story). Since there is glue involved, I would highly recommend a pair of gloves to keep your hands from getting glue on them.</p>



<ul><li>Make sure the device itself is clean, remember where you’re attaching it to.</li></ul>



<ul><li>Get out the glue for the device. The She-P kit I purchased comes with Hollister medical spray glue or you can use Urobond. As I’m not coordinated enough to use the little brush with the Urobond, I highly recommend the Hollister spray. As you’ll be spraying the She-P, I recommend placing the catheter on something that can be discarded (paper towel, piece of paper or parchment paper), but be careful not to glue the device to anything.</li></ul>



<ul><li>Apply TWO layers of glue to the She-P. Spray the first layer of glue onto the outer flaps, avoiding the reservoir. I like to keep the glue towards the outside of the flaps, avoiding the very inner area by the reservoir (remember, this is medical grade glue, you don’t want to glue your lips together – or anything else that is down there). I’ve highlighted in red the area I aim to spray with the glue.</li></ul>



<div><figure><img data-attachment-id="723" data-permalink="https://peeifyouwanttogofaster.com/she-p_img1/" data-orig-file="https://peeifyouwanttogofaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/she-p_img1.jpg" data-orig-size="441,442" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="she-p_img1" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://peeifyouwanttogofaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/she-p_img1.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://peeifyouwanttogofaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/she-p_img1.jpg?w=441" loading="lazy" width="441" height="442" src="https://peeifyouwanttogofaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/she-p_img1.jpg?w=441" alt="" srcset="https://peeifyouwanttogofaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/she-p_img1.jpg 441w, https://peeifyouwanttogofaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/she-p_img1.jpg?w=150 150w, https://peeifyouwanttogofaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/she-p_img1.jpg?w=300 300w" sizes="(max-width: 441px) 100vw, 441px"><figcaption>Spray coverage on the She-P</figcaption></figure></div>



<ul><li>Apply your first layer of glue onto the device, allow to dry for a few minutes (this is a good time to go have a cup of coffee – because you can!). I have heard others doing the first layer the night before, just make sure you don’t knock the device, get fluff on it, or some other disaster before the morning – hence why I do mine in the morning.</li></ul>



<ul><li>After about 10 minutes I apply the second layer of glue, allowing that to dry to just where if you touch the glue at the slightest, it’s almost thick and sticky. Now, you’re ready to adhere it to you. Note: you can use one layer of glue if you’re only doing one dive, but I don’t find it adheres well enough for me.</li></ul>



<ul><li>This is the fun part… Stand over your mirror or bring a friend. Line up the reservoir under you, meaning, aligned under your urethra (if you don’t know where that is, it’s where the urine comes out), with the hose pointing forward and press on from the front over the lips, then onto the sides and pressing through to the perineum. I personally have cyclists’ thighs, so I make sure just to have my legs open a bit and ensure the catheter is glued to the sides of my undercarriage. Note: You want to avoid getting glue onto your thighs (as I have done) and get a pretty good seal.</li></ul>



<ul><li>Press the catheter onto you, don’t squat or go for a run. Press the device on and keep some pressure on it. If I let go, I find the catheter drops a bit from the weight of it…don’t do that. The weight of the tube will pull it down, hold it up so the seal doesn’t break or pull the skin (yes, it’s uncomfortable). Ensure the seal is glued on, for myself I find the area by the perineum to be the most difficult. I then don some spandex shorts over top. For me personally, this applies some pressure to the device, holds the tube up and keeps everything in place.</li></ul>



<ul><li>Once the device is in place, I HIGHLY suggest going for a test pee. The first time you do this, get in the tub or shower. Trust me. While standing, do a SLOW pee, like VERY VERY SLOW pee, remember, that little reservoir is catching the urine and going down the tube, which can be a bit of a bottleneck. If you’ve never peed standing up as a female, it’s a very novel experience. I giggled continuously, until I realized it was like a firehose and I peed everywhere. Learn to aim.</li></ul>



<ul><li>Since I’ve used the She-P a few times now, I ensure I pee as much as possible before attaching the device. I then pee before my dive in the toilets or before boarding the boat. Finding the right position to pee standing up is difficult. As mentioned, I find the point of attachment to the perineum the point of leaking for me. Others have found the front to be an issue. When I’m using a toilet with the She-P attached I find I have to face the toilet when standing, bend at the waist and allow the urine to go down the tube. Think of an awkward squat but facing forwards, pushing the hose towards the toilet bowl. I have tried standing in various positions to pee, and that is what works for me. Since you’re not using the device much on dry land this shouldn’t be your focus, but I find a test pee a good way of checking for leaks.</li></ul>



<ul><li>There are various ways to ensure the device gets some extra security in place. I personally, use a pair of tight spandex shorts. I also pull the front adapter up towards my belly button as that’s how I wear it in my suit (will explain that below). Many people have tried various ways to give the catheter extra security:<ul><li>Two thongs – one over each leg, holding the She-P in place on the inner thigh. For me, this didn’t work, it was too restrictive, but go ahead and give it a shot.</li></ul><ul><li>Rubber/latex underwear – Some women swear by this. I searched for rubber/latex underwear, which brings up some interesting results on the internet. I did acquire a pair and when trying them, they were soooo uncomfortable and shifted a bit. I’ve tossed that idea out, but again, it may work for you.</li></ul><ul><li>Nappies/Diapers/sanitary pads – Some women will still wear a nappy/diaper to catch any drippage. I have a severe aversion to this…I’d risk the leak. You can also use a good sanitary pad in your underwear, probably the better option.</li></ul><ul><li>Waterproof medical tape – put this in your kit bag. If you find a leak on your trial pee, you can add some tape over the leaking area (see, this is why you want to get rid of all of your hair).</li></ul></li></ul>



<p>I hate to say it, but this is all going to be trial and error. The best part is, you can pee while diving and avoid the discomfort. The downside is that you might not make any friends if they know you’ve accidentally peed yourself. Try this all out in the shower the first time, and maybe use the pads/diapers on the first few dives until you’re comfortable.</p>



<h2><strong>Diving with the She-P</strong></h2>



<p>Once I get the She-P catheter attached I’m ready to go diving…woohoo!</p>



<p>Above I mentioned that I wear a pair of tight shorts, I take the hose and point it up towards my belly button. The shorts hold it in place and keep everything fairly pressed against the skin. I have tried pointing the catheter in a more downwards position, but I caused a kink in the hose, which caused a little backflow, so just try out what works best for you. I find sitting down with the catheter attached is interesting… i.e., driving in a car, sitting on a bench – heck, even walking, I feel a bit like a cowboy. It’s okay, it’s normal and as the day goes on, you get more comfortable with it.</p>



<p>When I’m getting dressed to dive, I have my shorts on, then I wear (sometimes) a thermal layer that goes on as normal. On top of that I wear my under suit. I currently have a<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://fourthelement.com/product-category/drysuit-underwear/arctic/" target="_blank"> Fourth Element Arctic two-piece suit.</a> If you’ve ever seen a mens under suit when using a P-valve, they have a hole cut for their hose down the leg. I cut along the front of my under suit and had some Velcro sewn either side of the crotch. This provides an easy way to attach my She-P to my P-valve.</p>



<p>When I get into my dry suit I take the tube from my p-valve, run it up through the Velcro hole in the front of my under suit, also running that straight up the front of me to the other end of the catheter. I have the quick connector system that came with my She-P kit, I can easily plug the two ends together and voila!</p>



<p>I am routing both tubes up towards my belly button, I create an ‘S’ or ‘C’ bend, in the tubes, without actually causing a kink, I use the shorts to hold the catheter in place and the tube routes down through my under suit. You will need to find the position of the tubing that works best for you. For me, I found that when I’m diving, this is absolute best position, it also means that pesky perineum area doesn’t leak.</p>



<p>I’m all plumbed in and ready to go!</p>



<p>For my specific P-valve, I find that I have to ensure it’s closed, or it leaks. Most valves don’t do that, but mine does (hopefully my new one won’t). Also, if you keep the valve closed, you can get a reverse pressure that you’ll feel in the chamber, so open and close the valve a bit to release that pressure (especially if you feel it when diving).</p>



<p>Peeing on the actual dive takes practice. I have devised a specific hand signal that I’ve used with various dive buddies to say, ‘I need to pee’. It usually creates a laugh, a bit of mask flooding, then they awkwardly stare at you when you’re trying to pee. Again, you’re going to need to practice peeing. Personally, I cannot be swimming and peeing. I have to stop kicking. I usually hang out on a wreck and do my thing, but I usually find a deco/safety stop is the best place. I mean, what else are you going to do? Like I mentioned before, I keep my valve closed. My buddy can see me reach for the valve to open it, so I don’t even need a hand signal…yeah, it’s about as subtle as a brick to the face…so they know… I’m peeing. They usually make faces at me and cause again, more laughter.</p>



<p>No matter where you choose to pee with your P-valve, PEE SLOWLY. The urine should exit down the tube and all is good. I would highly suggest having a pee before exiting the water (again, for me it’s on a deco stop). I stay plumbed in all day, I’m usually okay between dives, but if you find yourself on a long surface interval or stuck in your dry suit. Just go stand in a quiet corner, open your valve and pee standing up. All the boys do it!</p>



<h2><strong>Removing the She-P</strong></h2>



<p>When you’re done diving for the day, un-clasp your hose from the P-valve, FLUSH OUT your P-valve asap if you can. Use a bottle with a small nose to flush out the P-valve. I use Milton with water to flush down the tube to my suit (and don’t forget to open your valve on your leg). I then rinse thoroughly with water and blow into the end of the tube with my mouth to get the liquid out.</p>



<p>I use the cap that came with the kit and close off the hose on the catheter after I’ve taken off my suit for the day. If I have to travel home or somewhere in a car, I just leave my shorts on, and the catheter is still attached. I have removed the catheter in different ways, each with varying levels of success…</p>



<ul><li>Wait until you’re near a hot shower and gently peel (be careful to not rip the catheter) it off of you.</li></ul>



<ul><li>Peel back the catheter from your body and remove from wherever you are. I tend to go with this method, but I’ve had interesting results. One time I peeled it off too fast, my skin felt raw for a couple of days, and I spent the evening with an ice pack on my raw skin. Usually, I just get residual glue.</li></ul>



<ul><li>No matter how I remove the She-P I end of up with glue on it and myself. I use the wipes to get off the excess.</li></ul>



<ul><li>Wash the She-P with warm water and soap, wash the device all over and ensure that you run the soap/water through the hose. Hang the device up to dry, I have a little hook that I hang it from (with the hose pointing down, allowing it to drip dry).</li></ul>



<ul><li>If you’re diving for multiple days in a row, clean the device after each day (and yourself). Travel with whatever cleaning fluids that work and stick to those.</li></ul>



<ul><li>I’ve never taken off my She-P during a day of diving, I leave it on all day, but I’ve heard of people taking it off between dives. I would only recommend that if your dives are fairly far apart and you’re on a liveaboard. If you can survive with it on all day, that might be the easier option (if you’re not doing any other activities for the day).</li></ul>



<h2><strong>Diving while on your period</strong></h2>



<p>While I don’t want to go too deep on this topic, it will happen. Up until that last 2 years, I had been on birth control for 20 years, so if I had a trip coming up I could just skip my period using my birth control. Since then, I’ve opted to go off birth control (that’s a whole other story) and have had to face what to do with my period, diving and the P-valve. Firstly, it all depends on your flow, if you have a heavy period, a diaper/nappy might be best. Second, it depends on what you usually use on your period to deal with the flow. I personally, gave up tampons several years ago and dive with a menstrual cup. I made the change due to several factors: reusability, better for the environment, easier to manage, better for endurance sports (and diving). The only downside is that it pushes on my bladder when diving (just a bit, but it’s noticeable).</p>



<p>I tend to keep the menstrual cup in and attach my She-P as I normally would. I can leave the menstrual cup in for over 8 hours if needed, so this method works really really well for me. If your flow is really light, you could potentially get away with nothing at all, as the reservoir would catch it, you just want to make sure that it doesn’t ‘overload the system’.</p>



<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>



<p>Diving with a She-P is awesome and a total game changer!&nbsp; I’ve tried to make this blog as comprehensive as possible to cover off my experience and others that have tried diving with a P-valve. &nbsp;As with anything, it all comes down to personal preference and a bit of trial and error.</p>



<p>Don’t let your bladder keep you from diving. There are several Facebook groups out there aimed at this, as well as Scubaboard.</p>



<p>Good luck and dive deep my friends! </p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>According to Chinese media, Sun Huajun, CTO of BYD’s battery business, stated at a forum event on solid-state batteries that the company had already produced its first solid-state cells with 20 Ah and 60 Ah on its pilot production line in 2024. The portals <em>CN EV Post </em>and <em>Car News China</em> reported on this based on a video recording of the presentation.</p><p>According to the battery business CTO, BYD expects to start “mass demonstration” of solid-state batteries around 2027. However, he did not provide any information on the number of prototype cells produced to date. And even after the demonstration applications, there are no plans to start series production in the near future: A truly large-scale introduction of solid-state batteries could possibly only take place after 2030, Sun is quoted in the reports.</p><p>Sun also does not expect the technology to be used by its competitors any earlier than this. “Looking at the industry as a whole, different players are making about the similar progress,” Huajun said. In fact, Wu Kai, Chief Scientist at CATL, stated at an event <a href="https://www.electrive.com/2024/04/29/catl-expects-to-produce-its-own-solid-state-batteries-in-small-series-by-2027/">in April 2024 </a>that battery market leader CATL plans to produce the first solid-state cells in small quantities in 2027 – similar to BYD. However, there will still be problems with producing large quantities, including in terms of costs, according to Wu.</p><p>In the technical presentation, Sun also announced that BYD is focussing on sulphide electrolytes in the development of solid-state cells – apparently driven by “cost and process stability considerations.” According to the BYD manager, the costs for solid-state cells with sulphide electrolytes could theoretically reach a comparable level to today’s NCM cells with liquid electrolyte level of scale of use. However, the quantities are still too small – especially for sulphide electrolytes: “It doesn’t really make a lot of sense to talk about cost in the absence of volume.” Other technology paths for solid-state cells are oxides and polymers. According to a report <a href="https://www.electrive.com/2024/11/07/catl-start-trial-production-of-20-ah-solid-state-cells/">from November 2024</a>, CATL is also said to have opted for sulphides.</p><p>In theory, replacing the current liquid electrolyte in a battery cell with a solid offers a number of advantages. As the flammable liquid electrolyte is no longer required, solid-state cells are generally safer. At the same time, higher energy densities and more power are possible, resulting in a longer range and shorter charging times. Although many companies and institutions have been working on the technology for years due to these advantages, battery cells with ‘real’ solid electrolyte are still very rare – as BYD’s timetable also suggests. A semi-solid, gel-like electrolyte, also known as a solid, is already being used in some cases. However, this is actually a so-called ‘semi-solid-state battery’ (SSSB), while BYD and CATL use ‘all-solid-state batteries’ (ASSB) with an actual solid electrolyte.</p><p>BYD is best known today for its blade batteries with LFP cell chemistry. These lithium iron phosphate cells are considered to be more robust and cheaper than cell chemistries based on nickel and cobalt, but generally have a lower energy density. In its report, <em>Car News China</em> quotes Sun as well as Lian Yubo, BYD’s chief scientist, chief engineer for motor vehicles and dean of the Automotive Engineering Research Institute. ““Solid-state batteries will be mainly used in high-end models, empowering each other with lithium iron phosphate batteries, and used in vehicles of different levels,” said Lian, who expects LFP cells to be used for at least another 15 to 20 years.</p><p><a href="https://cnevpost.com/2025/02/15/byd-demonstration-use-all-solid-state-batteries-2027/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">cnevpost.com</a>, <a href="https://carnewschina.com/2025/02/15/byd-will-start-mass-installation-of-all-solid-state-batteries-around-2027-company-cto-says/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">carnewschina.com</a></p></div></div>]]></description>

We don’t have philosophically satisfying insights into the universe at subatomic scales. We have quantum mechanics: a set of equations that are good at predicting the behavior of elementary particles, but that don’t line up with our intuition about the macroscopic world. We don’t know if the equations are a crude approximation of some deeper, yet-unseen reality; or if the fabric of the universe is just weird math. In fact, the harder we try to come up with intuitive analogies, the more off-base we get. For example, despite what most YouTube educators claim, there’s no straightforward explanation of what a bound electron actually does: it’s not orbiting the nucleus or spinning around its own axis in any conventional sense. Most simply, it just </span><em>exists</em><span> as a particular distribution of an electrostatic field in space.</span></p><p>In any case, the shape of orbitals is of relatively little significance to electronics; it matters in chemistry because it helps model chemical reactions and predict the properties of materials. For our purposes, it suffices to say that each atom or molecule has a certain number of electrons and that they are organized into a certain number of shells.</p><p><span>In the same vein, we don’t need to dwell on the structure of the nucleus. In brief, the nucleus is held together by a powerful but extremely short-range field known as the </span><em>residual strong force</em><span>. This force is thought to be a consequence of the make-up of protons and neutrons, each of which appears to be made out of three more exotic elementary particles known as quarks. Pay no mind: it’s enough to say that most nuclei on Earth were formed through nuclear fusion in stars and won’t undergo any change on the timescales of interest to electronics — or to terrestrial life.</span></p><p><span>A more pertinent observation is that the structure of the atom is also shaped by a weaker but far-reaching </span><em>electrostatic force. </em><span>The force acts only on certain subatomic particles; these particles are said to be charged. In this specific context, the “charge” is an intrinsic property of a given type of particles and not something they can gain or lose: a proton is always positive, an electron is always negative, and a neutron just doesn’t play along. Similar charges repel and dissimilar charges attract, so protons in the nucleus can pull in an equal number of electrons. The electrons are then captured — </span><em>bound</em><span> — by the electrostatic field extending from the nucleus. The result is a stable atom with no net charge.</span></p><p><span>Another important insight from quantum mechanics is that the parameters that describe the state of a bound electron appear to be quantized — that is to say, they only take specific values or change in discrete increments. Once again, we don’t have a satisfying explanation why. We know that these quantum numbers correspond to standing-wave solutions of a three-dimensional wave function that we pulled out of thin air. We also know that the model works better than any alternatives. But we don’t know what any of it </span><em>really</em><span> means — or if it means anything. Either way, the bottom line is that there are specific energy levels that an electron in an atom can hop across, with no option to dwell halfway between. This is why we see a progression distinct electron shells, from lowest to highest energies.</span></p><p><span>The remaining conundrum is why don’t all the electrons settle in the most energetically-favorable, innermost shell. The relevant constraint is known as the </span><em>Pauli exclusion principle</em><span>. The state of a bound electron is seemingly fully described by a handful of parameters, and the electrons must remain distinct — i.e., their quantum parameters can’t be all the same. This means that each shell has a limited seating capacity: once all the combinations of “lesser” quantum numbers are exhausted, the next electron needs to bump up the remaining variable: the principal quantum number that corresponds to the shell it occupies.</span></p><p>In most cases, the electrons that populate innermost shells do relatively little: they have low energy, are bound tightly to the nucleus, and tend to be shielded from outside influence. The story is different for higher-energy valence electrons; for example, chemistry as we know it arises from atoms exchanging or sharing these weakly-attached particles. In a covalent bond, some electrons from both participating atoms shift to a newly-formed, energetically-favorable multi-atom orbital. In ionic bonding, one or more electrons migrate from one atom to another. In the latter case, the new molecule is held together by the resulting electrostatic field.</p><p>Even without chemical bonding, it’s not difficult to temporarily dislodge some valence electrons. The most familiar example is the triboelectric effect that’s responsible for the harmless zaps of static electricity we sometimes feel around the home. The effect isn’t fully understood, but we know that depending on the shape and orientation of molecules, different surfaces exhibit variable affinity to electrons. In part because of this, when two dissimilar materials are brought together, there can be a slight imbalance in the number of electrons that randomly migrate across the boundary. If the pieces are then quickly pulled apart, some charge carriers end up getting stuck where they don’t belong.</p><p><span>It should be noted that the scale of this imbalance is minuscule: the displacement of about 10</span><sup>11</sup><span> electrons is enough to give you a good zap. This might seem like a big number, but consider that there are roughly 81,000,000,000,000 times as many</span><sup> </sup><span>electrons in a single ounce of table salt. In other words, the magnitude of the phenomenon is comparable to taking a bucket of water out of Lake Erie.</span></p><p>This brings us to solid-state insulators: in such materials, valence electrons can still be pulled off or deposited onto the surface with relative ease, but the resulting charges stay in place and can’t propagate through the bulk of the substrate. This is often because there are no suitable vacancies in the shells of nearby molecules. To move around, the electrons would need to be knocked into a higher-energy state.</p><p><span>This situation is different in metals. The atoms form a dense, homogeneous lattice with sparsely-populated orbitals that essentially merge together, extending throughout the material and no longer exhibiting clearly-quantized energy levels that are characteristic of electrons bound to a single nucleus. In this environment, valence electrons are free to skate around the lattice at will. The electrostatic interaction with protons still confines the bulk of the mobile charge carriers to the conductor, but in most other respects, the behavior of a metallic conductor can be modeled as that of a free-flowing </span><em>electron gas</em><span>.</span></p><p>The key property of conductors is that in contrast to insulators, any static charges can quickly equalize. Consider the scenario shown below, where a single electron is plucked off by an external actor and then injected back on the other side of the wire:</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2d58a6d3-188e-46f4-a4a9-c5bceff6ee2c_2179x1358.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2d58a6d3-188e-46f4-a4a9-c5bceff6ee2c_2179x1358.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2d58a6d3-188e-46f4-a4a9-c5bceff6ee2c_2179x1358.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2d58a6d3-188e-46f4-a4a9-c5bceff6ee2c_2179x1358.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2d58a6d3-188e-46f4-a4a9-c5bceff6ee2c_2179x1358.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2d58a6d3-188e-46f4-a4a9-c5bceff6ee2c_2179x1358.png" width="1456" height="907" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/2d58a6d3-188e-46f4-a4a9-c5bceff6ee2c_2179x1358.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:907,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:248647,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://lcamtuf.substack.com/i/157690720?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2d58a6d3-188e-46f4-a4a9-c5bceff6ee2c_2179x1358.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2d58a6d3-188e-46f4-a4a9-c5bceff6ee2c_2179x1358.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2d58a6d3-188e-46f4-a4a9-c5bceff6ee2c_2179x1358.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2d58a6d3-188e-46f4-a4a9-c5bceff6ee2c_2179x1358.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2d58a6d3-188e-46f4-a4a9-c5bceff6ee2c_2179x1358.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption><em>Motion of charges in a metal wire.</em></figcaption></figure></div><p>The remaining electrons promptly scamper away due to electrostatic repulsion; if the process continues, we can observe a steady drift of electrons along the length of the wire.

<p>Around twenty years ago, people would have laughed if you told them that videogames would end up at the Smithsonian, but the Half-Life team really did want to make games that were more than just throwaway toys. The rule against cinematics — which made our jobs much harder and also ended up leaving a lot of my favorite work out of the game — was a kind of ideological stake in the ground: we really did want the game and the story to be the same thing. It was far from flawless, but it was really trying to push the boundaries of a young medium.</p>
<p>— Valve artist Steve Theodore</p>
</blockquote>
<p>By 1998, the first-person shooter was nearing its pinnacle of popularity. In June of that year, <em>Computer Gaming World</em> magazine could list fourteen reasonably big-budget, high-profile FPS’s earmarked for release in the next six months alone. And yet the FPS seemed rather to be running to stand still. Almost all of the innovation taking place in the space was in the realm of technology rather than design.</p>
<p>To be sure, progress in the former realm was continuing apace. Less than five years after <a href="https://www.filfre.net/2020/05/the-shareware-scene-part-3-the-id-boys">id Software</a> had shaken the world with <a href="https://www.filfre.net/2020/06/the-shareware-scene-part-4-doom"><em>DOOM</em></a>, that game’s low-resolution 2.5D graphics and equally crude soundscapes had become positively quaint. Aided and abetted by a fast-evolving ecosystem of <a href="https://www.filfre.net/2023/05/the-next-generation-in-graphics-part-2-three-dimensions-in-hardware">3D-graphics hardware</a> from <a href="https://www.filfre.net/2023/05/the-next-generation-in-graphics-part-3-software-meets-hardware">companies like 3Dfx</a>, <a href="https://www.filfre.net/2023/04/the-next-generation-in-graphics-part-1-three-dimensions-in-software-or-quake-and-its-discontents">id’s <em>Quake</em> engine</a> had raised the bar enormously in 1996; ditto <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/405/quake-ii/"><em>Quake II</em></a> in 1997. These were the cutting-edge engines that everyone with hopes of selling a lot of shooters scrambled to license. Then, in May of 1998, with <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/649/quake-iii-arena/"><em>Quake III</em></a> not scheduled for release until late the following year, Epic MegaGames came along with their own <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/330/unreal/"><em>Unreal</em></a> engine, boasting a considerably longer bullet list of graphical effects than <em>Quake II</em>. In thus directly challenging id’s heretofore unquestioned supremacy in the space, <em>Unreal</em> ignited a 3D-graphics arms race that seemed to promise even faster progress in the immediate future.</p>
<p>Yet whether they sported the name <em>Quake</em> or <em>Unreal</em> or something else on their boxes, single-player FPS’s were still content to hew to the “shooting gallery” design template laid out by <em>DOOM</em>. You were expected to march through a ladder-style campaign consisting of a set number of discrete levels, each successive one full of more and more deadly enemies to kill than the last, perhaps with some puzzles of the lock-and-key or button-mashing stripe to add a modicum of variety. These levels were joined together by some thread of story, sometimes more elaborate and sometimes — usually — less so, but so irrelevant to what occurred inside the levels that impatient gamers could and sometimes did skip right over the intervening cutscenes or other forms of exposition in order to get right back into the action.</p>
<p>This was clearly a model with which countless gamers were completely comfortable, one which had the virtue of allowing them maximal freedom of choice: follow along with the story or ignore it, as you liked. Or, as id’s star programmer John Carmack famously said: “Story in a game is like a story in a porn movie. It’s expected to be there, but it’s not that important.”</p>
<p>But what if you could build the story right into the gameplay, such that the two became inseparable? What if you could eliminate the artificial division between exposition and action, and with it the whole conceit of a game as a mere series of levels waiting to be beaten one by one? What if you could drop players into an open-ended space where the story was taking place all around them?</p>
<p>This was the thinking that animated an upstart newcomer to the games industry that went by the name of Valve L.L.C. The game that resulted from it would prove the most dramatic conceptual advance in the FPS genre since <em>DOOM</em>, with lessons and repercussions that reached well beyond the borders of shooter country.</p>

<p>The formation of Valve was one of several outcomes of a dawning realization inside the Microsoft of the mid-1990s that computer gaming was becoming a very big business. The same realization led a highly respected Microsoft programmer named Michael Abrash to quit his cushy job in Redmond, Washington, throw his tie into the nearest trashcan, and move to Mesquite, Texas, to help John Carmack and the other scruffy id boys make <em>Quake</em>. It led another insider named Alex St. John to put together the internal team who made DirectX, a library of code that allowed game developers and players to finally say farewell to creaky old MS-DOS and join the rest of the world that was running <a href="https://www.filfre.net/2022/11/doing-windows-part-10-chicago">Windows 95</a>. It led Microsoft to buy an outfit called Ensemble Studios and their promising real-time-strategy game <a href="https://www.filfre.net/2024/03/age-of-empires-or-how-microsoft-got-in-on-games"><em>Age of Empires</em></a> as a first wedge for levering their way into the gaming market as a publisher of major note. And it led to Valve Corporation.</p>
<p>In 1996, Valve’s future co-founders Gabe Newell and Mike Harrington were both valued employees of Microsoft. Newell had been working there in project-management roles since 1983; he had played an important part in the creation of the <a href="https://www.filfre.net/2018/06/doing-windows-part-1-ms-dos-and-its-discontents">early versions of Windows</a> before moving on to Microsoft Office and other high-profile applications. Harrington was a programmer whose tenure had been shorter, but he had made significant contributions to Windows NT, Microsoft’s business- and server-oriented operating system.</p>
<p>As Newell tells the tale, he had an epiphany when he was asked to commission a study to find out just how many computers were currently running Microsoft Windows in the United States. The number of 20 million that he got back was impressive. Yet he was shocked to learn that Windows wasn’t the most popular single piece of software to be found on American personal computers; that was rather a game called <em>DOOM</em>. Newell and Harrington had long enjoyed playing games. Now, it seemed, there were huge piles of money to be earned from making them. Doing so struck them as a heck of a lot more fun than making more operating systems and business software. It was worth a shot, at any rate; both men were wealthy enough by now that they could afford to take a flier on something completely different.</p>
<p>So, on August, 24, 1996, the pair quit Microsoft to open an office for their new company Valve some five miles away in Kirkland, Washington. At the time, no one could have imagined — least of all them — what a milestone moment this would go down as in the history of gaming. “On the surface, we should have failed,” says Gabe Newell. “Realistically, both Mike and I thought we would get about a year into it, realize we’d made horrible mistakes, and go back to our friends at Microsoft and ask for our jobs back.”</p>
<p>Be that as it may, they did know what kind of game they wanted to make. Or rather Newell did; from the beginning, he was the driving creative and conceptual force, while Harrington focused more on the practical logistics of running a business and making quality software. Like so many others in the industry he was entering, Newell wanted to make a shooter. Yet he wanted his shooter to be more immersive and encompassing of its player than any of the ones that were currently out there, with a story that was embedded right into the gameplay rather than standing apart from it. Valve wasted no time in licensing id’s <em>Quake</em> engine to bring these aspirations to life, via the game that would come to be known as <em>Half-Life</em>.</p>
<p>As the id deal demonstrates, Newell and Harrington had connections and financial resources to hand that almost any other would-be game maker would have killed for; both had exited Microsoft as millionaires several times over. Yet they had no access to gaming distribution channels, meaning that they had to beat the bush for a publisher just like anyone else with a new studio. They soon found that their studio and their ambitious ideas were a harder sell than they had expected. With games becoming a bigger business every year, there were a lot of deep-pocketed folks from other fields jumping into the industry with plans to teach all of the people who were already there what they were doing wrong; such folks generally had no clue about what it took to do games right. Seasoned industry insiders had a name for these people, one that was usually thoroughly apt: “Tourists.” At first glance, the label was easy to apply to Newell and Harrington and Valve. Among those who did so was Mitch Lasky, then an executive at Activision, who would go on to become a legendary gaming venture capitalist. He got “a whiff of tourism” from Valve, he admits. He says he still has “post-traumatic stress disorder” over his decision to pass on signing them to a publishing deal — but by no means was he the only one to do so.</p>
<p>Newell and Harrington finally wound up pitching to Sierra, a publisher known primarily for point-and-click adventure games, a venerable genre that was now being sorely tested by all of the new FPS’s. In light of this, Sierra was understandably eager to find a horse of the new breed to back. The inking of a publishing deal with Valve was one of the last major decisions made by <a href="https://www.filfre.net/2011/10/ken-and-roberta">Ken Williams</a>, who had <a href="https://www.filfre.net/2011/10/on-line-systems-is-born">founded Sierra</a> in his living room back in 1980 but was now in the process of selling the business he had built from the ground up. As a man with such deep roots in adventure games, he found Valve’s focus on story both refreshing and appealing. Still, there was a lot of wrangling between the parties, mainly over the ultimate disposition of the rights to the <em>Half-Life</em> name; Williams wanted them to go to Sierra, but Newell and Harrington wanted to retain them for themselves. In the end, with no other publishers stepping up to the plate, Valve had to accept what Sierra was offering, a capitulation that would lead to a lengthy legal battle a few years down the road. For now, though, they had their publisher.</p>
<p>As for Ken Williams, who would exit the industry stage left well before <em>Half-Life</em> was finished:</p>
<blockquote><p>Now that I’m retired, people sometimes ask me what I used to do. I usually just say, “I had a game company back in the old days.” That inevitably causes them to say, “Did you make any games I might have heard of?” I answer, “<a href="https://www.filfre.net/2015/08/leisure-suit-larry-in-the-land-of-the-lounge-lizards">Leisure Suit Larry</a>.” That normally is sufficient, but if there is no glimmer of recognition I pull out the heavy artillery and say, “Half-Life.” Unless they’ve been sleeping under a rock for the last couple of decades, that always lights up their eyes.</p></blockquote>
<p>One can imagine worse codas to a business career…</p>
<p>In what could all too easily be read as another sign of naïve tourism, Newell and Harrington agreed to a crazily optimistic development timeline, promising a finished game for the Christmas of 1997, which was just one year away. To make it happen, they hired a few dozen level designers, programmers, artists, and other creative and technical types, many of whom had no prior professional experience in the games industry, all of whom recognized what an extraordinary opportunity they were being handed and were willing to work like dogs to make the most of it. The founders tapped a fertile pool of recruits in the online <em>DOOM</em> and <em>Quake</em> modding scenes, where amateurs were making names for themselves by bending those engines in all sorts of new directions. They would now do the same on a professional basis at Valve, even as the programmers modified the <em>Quake</em> engine itself to suit their needs, implementing better lighting and particle effects, and adding scripting and artificial-intelligence capabilities that the straightforward run-and-shoot gameplay in which id specialized had never demanded. Gabe Newell would estimate when all was said and done that 75 percent of the code in the engine had been written or rewritten at Valve.</p>
<p>In June of 1997, Valve took <em>Half-Life</em> to the big E3 trade show, where it competed for attention with a murderers’ row of other FPS’s, including early builds of <em>Unreal</em>, <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/322/sin/"><em>SiN</em></a>, <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/1678/john-romeros-daikatana/"><em>Daikatana</em></a>, <em>Quake II</em>, and <a href="https://www.filfre.net/2024/04/jedi-knight-plus-notes-on-an-expanded-universe"><em>Jedi Knight</em></a>. Valve didn’t even have a booth of their own at the show. Nor were they to be found inside Sierra’s; <em>Half-Life</em> was instead shown in the booth of 3Dfx. Like so many of Valve’s early moves, this one was deceptively clever, because 3Dfx was absolutely huge at the time, with as big a buzz around their hardware as id enjoyed around their software. <em>Half-Life</em> walked away from the show with the title of “Best Action Game.”</p>
<p>The validation of E3 made the unavoidable moment of reckoning that came soon after easier to stomach. I speak, of course, about the moment when Valve had to recognize that they didn’t have a ghost of a chance of finishing the game that they wanted to make within the next few months. Newell and Harrington looked at the state of the project and decided that they could probably scrape together a more or less acceptable but formulaic shooter in time for that coming Christmas. Or they could keep working and end up with something amazing for the <em>next</em> Christmas. To their eternal credit, they chose the latter course, a decision which was made possible only by their deep pockets. For Sierra, who were <a href="https://www.filfre.net/2019/07/the-mortgaging-of-sierra-online">notorious</a> for releasing <a href="https://www.filfre.net/2018/10/quest-for-glory-iii-and-iv">half-finished games</a>, certainly did not intend to pay for an extra year of development time. The co-founders would have to foot that bill themselves. Nevertheless, to hear Gabe Newell tell it today, it was a no-brainer: “Late is just for a little while. Suck is forever.”</p>
<p>The anticipation around <em>Half-Life</em> didn’t diminish in the months that followed, not even after the finished <em>Unreal</em> took the world by storm in May of 1998. Despite being based on a two-plus-year-old engine in a milieu that usually prized the technologically new and shiny above all else, Valve’s “shooter with a story” had well and truly captured the imaginations of gamers. During the summer of 1998, a demo of the game consisting of the first three chapters — including the now-iconic opening scenes, in which you ride a tram into a secret government research facility as just another scientist on the staff headed for another day on the job — leaked out of the offices of a magazine to which it had been sent. It did more to promote the game than a million dollars worth of advertising could have; the demo spread like wildfire online, raising the excitement level to an even more feverish pitch. <em>Half-Life</em> was different enough to have the frisson of novelty in the otherwise homogeneous culture of the FPS, whilst still being readily identifiable <em>as</em> an FPS. It was the perfect mix of innovation and familiarity.</p>
<p>So, it was no real surprise when the full game turned into a massive hit for Valve and Sierra after its release on November 19, 1998. The magazines fell all over themselves to praise it. <em>Computer Gaming World</em>, normally the closest thing the hype-driven journalism of gaming had to a voice of sobriety, got as high on <em>Half-Life’</em>s supply as anyone. The magazine’s long-serving associate editor Jeff Green took it upon himself to render the official verdict.</p>
<blockquote><p>Everything you’ve heard, everything you’ve hoped for — it’s all true. Half-Life, Valve Software’s highly anticipated first-person shooter, is not just one of the best games of the year. It’s one of the best games of any year, an instant classic that is miles better than any of its immediate competition, and, in its single-player form, is the best shooter since DOOM. Plus, despite the fact that it’s “just” a shooter, Half-Life provides one of the best examples ever of how to present an interactive movie — and a great, scary movie at that.</p></blockquote>
<p><em>Half-Life</em> sold its first 200,000 copies in the United States before Christmas — i.e., before glowing reviews like the one above even hit the newsstands. But this was the barest beginning to its success story. In honor of its tenth birthday in 2008, Guinness of world-records fame would formally anoint <em>Half-Life</em> as the best-selling single FPS in history, with total sales in the neighborhood of 10 million copies across all platforms and countries. For Newell and Harrington, it was one hell of a way to launch a game-development studio. For Sierra, who in truth had done very little for <em>Half-Life</em> beyond putting it in a box and shipping it out to stores, it was a tsunami of cash that seemed to come out of nowhere, the biggest game they had ever published almost by an order of magnitude. One does hope that somebody in the company’s new management took a moment to thank Ken Williams for this manna from heaven.</p>

<p><em>Half-Life</em> has come to occupy such a hallowed, well-nigh sacrosanct position in the annals of gaming that any encounter with the actual artifact today seems bound to be slightly underwhelming. Yet even when we take into account the trouble that any game would have living up to a reputation as elevated as this one’s, the truth is that there’s quite a lot here for the modern skeptical critic to find fault with — and, Lord knows, this particular critic has seldom been accused of lacking in skepticism.</p>
<p>Judged purely as a shooter, the design shows its age. It’s sometimes amazingly inspired, but more often no better than average for its time. There’s a lot of crawling through anonymous vents that serve no real purpose other than to extend the length of the game, a lot of places where you can survive only by dying first so as to learn what’s coming, a lot of spots where it’s really not clear at all what the game wants from you. And then there are an <em>awful</em> lot of jumping puzzles, shoehorned into a game engine that has way more slop in it than is ideal for such things. I must say that I had more unadulterated fun with LucasArts’s <em>Jedi Knight</em>, the last shooter I played all the way through for these histories, than I did with <em>Half-Life</em>. There the levels are constructed like thrill rides straight out of the <em>Star Wars</em> films, with a through-line that seems to just intuitively come to you; looking back, I’m still in awe of their subtle genius in this respect. <em>Half-Life</em> is not like that. You really have to work to get through it, and that’s not as appealing to me.</p>
<p>Then again, my judgment on these things should, like that of any critic, be taken with a grain of salt. Whether you judge a game good or bad or mediocre hinges to a large degree on what precisely you’re looking for from it; we’ve all read countless negative reviews reflective not so much of a bad game as one that isn’t the game that that reviewer wanted to play. Personally, I’m very much a tourist in the land of the FPS. While I understand the appeal of the genre, I don’t want to expend too many hours or too much effort on it. I want to blast through a fun and engaging environment without too much friction. Make me feel like an awesome action hero while I’m at it, and I’ll probably walk away satisfied, ready to go play something else. <em>Jedi Knight</em> on easy mode gave me that experience; <em>Half-Life</em> did not, demanding a degree of careful attention from me that I wasn’t always eager to grant it. If you’re more hardcore about this genre than I am, your judgment of the positives and negatives in these things may very well be the opposite of mine. Certainly <em>Half-Life</em> is more typical of its era than <em>Jedi Knight</em> — an era when games like this were still accepted and even expected to be harder and more time-consuming than they are today. <em>C’est la vie et vive la différence!</em></p>
<p>But of course, it wasn’t the granular tactical details of the design that made <em>Half-Life</em> stand out so much from the competition back in the day. It was rather its brilliance as a storytelling vehicle that led to its legendary reputation. And don’t worry, you definitely won’t see me quibbling that said reputation isn’t deserved. Even here, though, we do need to be sure that we understand exactly what it did and did not do that was so innovative at the time.</p>
<p>Contrary to its popular rep then and now, <em>Half-Life</em> was by no means the first “shooter with a story.” Technically speaking, even <em>DOOM</em> has a story, some prattle about a space station and a portal to Hell and a space marine who’s the only one that can stop the demon spawn. The story most certainly isn’t <em>War and Peace</em>, but it’s there.</p>
<p><em>Half-Life</em> wasn’t even the shooter at the time of its release with the inarguably best or most complicated story. LucasArts makes a strong bid for the title there. Both <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/500/star-wars-dark-forces/"><em>Dark Forces</em></a> and the aforementioned <em>Jedi Knight</em>, released in 1995 and 1997 respectively, weave fairly elaborate tales into the fabric of the existing <em>Star Wars</em> universe, drawing on its rich lore, inserting themselves into the established chronology of the original trilogy of films and the “Expanded Universe” series of <em>Star Wars</em> novels.</p>
<p>Like that of many games of this era, <em>Half-Life’</em>s story betrays the heavy influence of the television show <a href="https://www.filfre.net/2024/09/the-truth-is-out-there-part-1-the-will-to-believe"><em>The X-Files</em></a>, which enjoyed its biggest season ever just before this game was released. We have the standard nefarious government conspiracy involving extraterrestrials, set in the standard top-secret military installation somewhere in the Desert Southwest. We even have a direct equivalent to Cancer Man, <em>The X-Files’</em>s shadowy, nameless villain who is constantly lurking behind the scenes. “G-Man” does the same in <em>Half-Life</em>; voice actor Michael Shapiro even opted to give him a “lizard voice” that’s almost a dead ringer for Cancer Man’s nicotine-addled croak.</p>

<p>All told, <em>Half-Life’</em>s story is more of a collection of tropes than a serious exercise in fictional world-building. To be clear, the sketchiness is by no means an automatically bad thing, not when it’s judged in the light of the purpose the story actually needs to serve. Mark Laidlaw, the sometime science-fiction novelist who wrote the script, makes no bones about the limits to his ambitions for it. “You don’t have to write the whole story,” he says. “Because it’s a conspiracy plot, everybody knows more about it than you do. So you don’t have to answer those questions. Just keep raising questions.”</p>
<p>Once the shooting starts, plot-related things happen, but it’s all heat-of-the-moment stuff. You fight your way out of the complex after its been overrun by alien invaders coming through a trans-dimensional gate that’s been inadvertently opened, only to find that your own government is now as bent on killing you as the aliens are in the name of the disposal of evidence. Eventually, in a plot point weirdly reminiscent of <em>DOOM</em>, you have to teleport yourself onto the aliens’ world to shut down the portal they’re using to reach yours.</p>
<p>Suffice to say that, while <em>Half-Life</em> may be slightly further along the continuum toward <em>War and Peace</em> than <em>DOOM</em> is, it’s only slightly so. Countless better, richer, deeper stories were told in games before this one came along. When people talk about <em>Half-Life</em> as “the FPS with a story,” they’re really talking about something more subtle: about its way of <em>presenting</em> its story. Far from diminishing the game, this makes it more important, across genres well beyond the FPS. The best way for us to start to come to grips with what <em>Half-Life</em> did that was so extraordinary might be to look back to the way games were deploying their stories before its arrival on the scene.</p>
<p>Throughout the 1980s, story in games was largely confined to the axiomatically narrative-heavy genres of the adventure game and the CRPG. Then, in 1990, Origin Systems released <a href="https://www.filfre.net/2017/04/from-squadron-to-wingleader">Chris Roberts’s <em>Wing Commander</em></a>, a game which was as revolutionary in the context of its own time as <em>Half-Life</em> was in its. In terms of gameplay, <em>Wing Commander</em> was a “simulation” of outer-space dog-fighting, not all that far removed in spirit from the classic <a href="https://www.filfre.net/2013/12/elite"><em>Elite</em></a>. What made it stand out was what happened when you weren’t behind the controls of your space fighter. Between missions, you hung out in the officers’ lounge aboard your mother ship, collecting scuttlebutt from the bartender, even flirting with the fetching female pilot in your squadron. When you went into the briefing room to learn about your next mission, you also learned about the effect your last one had had on the unfolding war against the deadly alien Kilrathi, and were given a broader picture of the latest developments in the conflict that necessitated this latest flight into danger. The missions themselves remained shooting galleries, but the story that was woven around them gave them resonance, made you feel like you were a part of something much grander. Almost equally importantly, this “campaign” provided an easy way to structure your time in the game and chart your improving skills; beat all of the missions in the campaign and see the story to its end, and you could say that you had mastered the game as a whole.</p>
<p>People <em>loved</em> this; <em>Wing Commander</em> became by far the most popular computer-gaming franchise of the young decade prior to the smashing arrival of <em>DOOM</em> at the end of 1993. The approach it pioneered quickly spread across virtually all gaming genres. In particular, both the first-person-shooter and the real-time strategy genres — the two that would dominate over all others in the second half of the decade — adopted it as their model for the single-player experience. Even at its most rudimentary, a ladder-style campaign gave you a goal to pursue and a framework of progression to hang your hat on.</p>
<p>Yet the same approach created a weirdly rigid division between gameplay and exposition, not only on the playing side of the ledger but to a large extent on the development side as well. It wasn’t unusual for completely separate teams to be charged with making the gameplay part of a game and all of the narrative pomp and circumstance that justified it. The disconnect could sometimes verge on hilarious; in <em>Jedi Knight</em>, which went so far as to film real humans acting out a B-grade <em>Star Wars</em> movie between its levels, the protagonist has a beard in the cutscenes but is clean-shaven during the levels. By the late 1990s, the pre-rendered-3D or filmed-live-action cutscenes sometimes cost more to produce than the game itself, and almost always filled more of the space on the CD.</p>
<p>As he was setting up his team at Valve, Gabe Newell attempted to eliminate this weird bifurcation between narrative and gameplay by passing down two edicts to his employees, the only non-negotiable rules he would ever impose upon them. <em>Half-Life</em> had to have a story — not necessarily one worthy of a film or a novel, but one worthy of the name. And at the same time, it couldn’t ever, under any conditions, from the very first moment to the very last, take control out of the hands of the player. Everything that followed cascaded from these two simple rules, which many a game maker of the time would surely have seen as mutually contradictory. To state the two most obvious and celebrated results, they meant no cutscenes whatsoever and no externally imposed ladder of levels to progress through — for any sort of level break did mean taking control out of the hands of the player, no matter how briefly.</p>
<p>Adapting to such a paradigm the <em>Quake</em> engine, which had been designed with a traditional FPS campaign in mind, proved taxing but achievable. Valve set up the world of <em>Half-Life</em> as a spatial grid of “levels” that were now better described as zones; pass over a boundary from one zone into another, and the new one would be loaded in swiftly and almost transparently. Valve kept the discrete zones small so as to minimize the loading times, judging more but shorter loading breaks to be better than fewer but longer ones. The hardest part was dealing with the borderlands, so to speak; you needed to be able to look into one zone from another, and the enemies and allies around you had to stay consistent before and after a transition. But Valve managed even this through some clever technical sleight of hand — such as by creating overlapping areas that existed in both of the adjoining sets of level data — and through more of the same on the design side, such as by placing the borders whenever possible at corners in corridors and at other spots where the line of sight didn’t extend too far. The occasional brief loading message aside — and they’re <em>very</em> brief, or even effectively nonexistent, on modern hardware — <em>Half-Life</em> really does feel like it all takes place in the same contiguous space.</p>

Every detail of <em>Half-Life</em> has been analyzed at extensive, exhaustive length over the decades since its release. Such analysis has its place in fan culture, but it can be more confusing than clarifying when it comes to appreciating the game’s most important achievements. The ironic fact is that you can learn almost everything that really matters about <em>Half-Life</em> as a game design just by playing it for an hour or so, enough to get into its third chapter. Shall we do so together now?</p>

<em>Half-Life</em> hews to Gabe Newell’s guiding rules from the moment you click the “New Game” button on the main menu and the iconic tram ride into the Black Mesa Research Center begins. The opening credits play over this sequence, in which you are allowed to move around and look where you like. There are reports that many gamers back in the day didn’t actually realize that they were already in control of the protagonist — reports that they just sat there patiently waiting for the “cutscene” to finish, so ingrained was the status quo of bifurcation.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.filfre.net/2024/11/__trashed/half-life_1/" rel="attachment wp-att-6188"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/half-life_1.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="450" srcset="https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/half-life_1.jpg 640w, https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/half-life_1-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px"></a></p>
<p>The protagonist himself strikes an artful balance between being an undefined player stand-in — what <a href="https://www.filfre.net/2024/06/the-last-days-of-zork"><em>Zork: Grand Inquisitor</em></a> called an “AFGNCAAP,” or “Ageless, Faceless, Gender-Neutral, Culturally Ambiguous Adventure Person” — and a fully fleshed-out character. As another result of Newell’s guiding rules, you never see him in the game unless you look in a mirror; you only see the world through his eyes. You do, however, hear security guards and colleagues refer to him — or, if you like, to you — as “Gordon” or “Mr. Freeman.” The manual and the intertitles that appear over the opening sequence of the game explain that his full name is indeed Gordon Freeman, and that he’s a 27-year-old theoretical physicist with a PhD from MIT who has been recently hired to work at Black Mesa. The game’s loading screen and its box art show us a rather atypical FPS protagonist, someone very different from the muscle-bound, cigar-chomping Duke Nukem or the cocky budding Jedi knight Kyle Katarn: a slim, studious-looking fellow with Coke-bottle eyeglasses and a token goatee. The heart of the computer-gaming demographic being what it was in 1998, he was disarmingly easy for many of the first players of <em>Half-Life</em> to identify with, thus adding just that one more note of immersion to the symphony. Small wonder that he has remained a favorite with cosplayers for decades. In fact, cipher though he almost entirely is, Gordon Freeman has become one of the most famous videogame characters in history.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.filfre.net/2024/11/__trashed/half-life_2/" rel="attachment wp-att-6189"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/half-life_2.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="450" srcset="https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/half-life_2.jpg 800w, https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/half-life_2-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/half-life_2-768x576.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px"></a></p>
<p>The tram eventually arrives at its destination and a security guard welcomes you to the part of the complex where you work: “Morning, Mr. Freeman. Looks like you’re running late.” Passing through the double blast doors, you learn from your colleagues inside that it’s already been a rough morning: the main computer has crashed, which has thrown a wrench into an important test that was planned for today. Mind you, you don’t learn this through dialog menus, which Valve judged to qualify as taking control away from the player. You can’t speak at all, but if you approach the guards and scientists, they’ll say things to you, leaving you to imagine your own role in the conversation. Or you can stand back and listen to the conversations they have with one another.</p>
<p>You can wander around as you like in this office area. You can look in Gordon’s locker to learn a little bit more about him, buy a snack from the vending machine, even blow it up by microwaving it for too long. (“My God!” says your colleague in reaction. “What are you doing?”) All of this inculcates the sense of a lived-in workspace better than any amount of external exposition could have done, setting up a potent contrast with the havoc to come.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.filfre.net/2024/11/__trashed/half-life_3/" rel="attachment wp-att-6190"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/half-life_3.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="450" srcset="https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/half-life_3.jpg 800w, https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/half-life_3-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/half-life_3-768x576.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px"></a></p>
<p>When you get bored fooling around with lockers and microwaves, you put on your hazardous-environment suit and head down to where the day’s test is to be conducted. It isn’t made clear to you the player just what the test is meant to accomplish; it isn’t even clear that Gordon himself understands the entirety of the research project to which he’s been assigned. All that matters is that the test goes horribly wrong, creating a “resonance cascade event” that’s accompanied by a lot of scary-looking energy beams flying through the air and explosions popping off everywhere. You’ve now reached the end of the second chapter without ever touching a weapon. But that’s about to change, because you’re about to find out that hostile alien lifeforms are now swarming the place. “Get to the surface as soon as you can and let someone know we’re stranded down here!” demand your colleagues. So, you pick up the handy crowbar you find lying on the floor and set off to batter a path through the opposition.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.filfre.net/2024/11/__trashed/half-life_4/" rel="attachment wp-att-6191"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/half-life_4.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="450" srcset="https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/half-life_4.jpg 800w, https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/half-life_4-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/half-life_4-768x576.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px"></a></p>
<p>This was a drill with which 1990s shooter fans were a lot more familiar, but there are still plenty of new wrinkles. The scientists and guards who were present in the complex before all hell broke loose don’t just disappear. They’re still around, mostly cowering in the corners in the case of the former, doing their best to fight back in that of the latter. The scientists sometimes have vital information to share, while the guards will join you as full-blown allies, firing off their pop-gun pistols at your side, although they tend not to live very long. Allies were a new thing under the FPS sun in 1998, an idea that would quickly spread to other games. (Ditto the way that the guards here are almost better at shooting you in the back than they are at shooting the rampaging aliens. The full history of “allies” in the FPS genre is a fraught one…)</p>
<p><a href="https://www.filfre.net/2024/11/__trashed/half-life_5/" rel="attachment wp-att-6192"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/half-life_5.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="450" srcset="https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/half-life_5.jpg 800w, https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/half-life_5-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/half-life_5-768x576.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px"></a></p>
<p>As you battle your way up through the complex, you witness plenty of pre-scripted scenes to go along with the emergent behavior of the scientists, guards, and aliens. Ideally, you won’t consciously notice any distinction between the two. You see a scientist being transformed into a zombie by an alien “head crab” behind the window of his office; see several hapless sad sacks tumbling down an open elevator shaft; see a dying guard trying and just failing to reach a healing station. These not only add to the terror and drama, but sometimes have a teaching function. The dying guard, for example, points out to you the presence of healing stations for ensuring that you don’t come to share his fate.</p>
<p>It’s the combination of emergent and scripted behaviors, on the part of your enemies and even more on that of your friends, that makes <em>Half-Life</em> come so vividly alive. I’m tempted to use the word “realism” here, but I know that Gabe Newell would rush to correct me if I did. Realism, he would say, is boring. Realistically, a guy like Gordon Freeman — heck, even one like Duke Nukem — wouldn’t last ten minutes in a situation like this one. Call it verisimilitude instead, a sign of a game that’s absolutely determined to stay true to its fictional premise, never mind how outlandish it is. The world <em>Half-Life</em> presents really is a living one; Newell’s rule of thumb was that five seconds should never pass without something happening near the player. Likewise, the world has to react to anything the player does. “If I shoot the wall, the wall should change, you know?” Newell said. “Similarly, if I were to throw a grenade at a grunt, he should react to it, right? I mean, he should run away from it or lay down on the ground and duck for cover. If he can’t run away from it, he should yell ‘Shit!’ or ‘Fire in the hole!’ or something like that.” In <em>Half-Life</em>, he will indeed do one or all of these things.</p>
<p>The commitment to verisimilitude means that most of what you see and hear is, to use the language of film, diegetic, or internal to the world as Gordon Freeman is experiencing it. Even the onscreen HUD is the one that Gordon is seeing, being the one that’s built into his hazard suit. The exceptions to the diegetic rule are few: the musical soundtrack that plays behind your exploits; the chapter names and titles which flash on the screen from time to time; those credits that are superimposed over the tram ride at the very beginning. These exceptions notwithstanding, the game’s determination to immerse you in an almost purely diegetic sensory bubble is the reason I have to strongly differ with Jeff Green’s description of <em>Half-Life</em> as an “interactive movie.” It’s actually the polar opposite of such a stylized beast. It’s an exercise in raw immersion which seeks to eliminate any barriers between you and your lived experience rather than making you feel like you’re doing anything so passive as watching or even guiding a movie. One might go so far as to take <em>Half-Life</em> as a sign that gaming was finally growing up and learning to stand on its own two feet by 1998, no longer needing to take so many of its cues from other forms of media.</p>
<p>We’ve about reached the end of our hour in <em>Half-Life</em> now, so we can dispense with the blow-by-blow. This is not to say that we’ve seen all the game has to offer. Betwixt and between the sequences that I find somewhat tedious going are more jaw-dropping dramatic peaks: the moment when you reach the exit to the complex at long last, only to learn that the United States Army wants to terminate rather than rescue you; the moment when you discover a tram much like the one you arrived on and realize that you can drive it through the tunnels; the moment when you burst out of the complex completely and see the bright blue desert sky above. (Unfortunately, it’s partially blotted out by a big Marine helicopter that also wants to kill you).</p>

<p>In my opinion, <em>Half-Life</em> could have been an even better game if it had been about half as long, made up of only its most innovative and stirring moments — “all killer, no filler,” as they used to say in the music business. Alas, the marketplace realities of game distribution in the late 1990s militated against this. If you were going to charge a punter $40 or $50 for a boxed game, you had to make sure it lasted more than six or seven hours. If <em>Half-Life</em> was being made today, Valve might very well have made different choices.</p>
<p>Again, though, mileages will vary when it comes to these things. The one place where <em>Half-Life</em> does fall down fairly undeniably is right at the end. Your climactic journey into Xen, the world of the aliens, is so truncated by time and budget considerations as to be barely there at all, being little more than a series of (infuriating) jumping puzzles and a couple of boss fights. Tellingly, it’s here that <em>Half-Life</em> gives in at last and violates its own rules of engagement, by delivering — perish the thought! — a cutscene containing the last bits of exposition that Valve didn’t have time to shoehorn into their game proper. The folks from Valve almost universally name the trip to Xen as their biggest single regret, saying they wish they had either found a way to do it properly or just saved it for a sequel. Needless to say, I can only concur.</p>
<p>Yet the fact remains that <em>Half-Life</em> at its best is so audacious and so groundbreaking that it almost transcends such complaints. Its innovations have echoed down across decades and genres. We’ll be bearing witness to that again and again in the years to come as we continue our journey through gaming history. Longtime readers of this site will know that I’m very sparing in my use of words like “revolutionary.” But I feel no reluctance whatsoever to apply the word to this game.</p>
