<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>EU regulators have charged Microsoft with illegally bundling its Teams chat app with its Office 365 and Microsoft 365 subscriptions. It’s the first time Microsoft has been charged with antitrust violations in the EU for 15 years, following two big cases related to Windows Media Player and Internet Explorer bundling.</p><p>“The European Commission has informed Microsoft of its preliminary view that Microsoft has breached EU antitrust rules by tying its communication and collaboration product Teams to its popular productivity applications included in its suites for businesses Office 365 and Microsoft 365,” says the European Commission in a <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_24_3446">statement today</a>.</p><p>Microsoft has now been handed a statement of objections, a list of the EU’s concerns over its Teams bundling. The software giant <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/31/23853517/microsoft-teams-unbundling-europe">unbundled Teams from Office</a> in Europe last year in an attempt to address regulator concerns, and then <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/1/24117785/microsoft-teams-office-split-eu-regulation-antitrust-investigation">spun off Teams from Office 365</a> as its own separate app globally. The unbundling hasn’t been enough to prevent charges, though.</p><p>“We are concerned that Microsoft may be giving its own communication product Teams an undue advantage over competitors, by tying it to its popular productivity suites for businesses,” says Margrethe Vestager, the head of competition policy in Europe. “If confirmed, Microsoft’s conduct would be illegal under our competition rules. Microsoft now has the opportunity to reply to our concerns.”</p><p>Microsoft says it is working with the EU to find solutions. “Having unbundled Teams and taken initial interoperability steps, we appreciate the additional clarity provided today and will work to find solutions to address the Commission’s remaining concerns,” says Microsoft president Brad Smith in a statement to the <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/eb83bb45-84b3-4c58-9589-684029d23243"><em>Financial Times</em></a>.</p><p>EU lawmakers <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/7/27/23797305/microsoft-teams-eu-antitrust-investigation-office-bundling-slack">first opened</a> a Microsoft antitrust investigation into Teams bundling last year, following an anti-competitive complaint filed by Slack in July 2020. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/22/21333989/slack-microsoft-eu-competition-complaint-teams-office">Slack’s original complaint</a>&nbsp;alleged that Microsoft had “illegally tied” its Microsoft Teams product to Office and is “force installing it for millions, blocking its removal, and hiding the true cost to enterprise customers.”</p><p>If Microsoft is found guilty of antitrust violations, the firm could face a fine of up to 10 percent of the company’s annual worldwide turnover. The European Commission could also impose remedies to force Microsoft to change its software products, much like it has in the past.</p><p>In 2004 the European Commission ordered Microsoft to offer a version of Windows without Media Player bundled, which resulted in a Windows XP N version available only in EU markets. In 2009 Microsoft was also forced to implement a browser ballot box in its Windows operating system to ensure users were presented with a choice of web browsers, after years of Microsoft bunding Internet Explorer with Windows. Microsoft was then <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/3/6/4069126/eu-fines-microsoft-for-windows-7-sp1-browser-ballot">fined $730 million</a>&nbsp;in 2013 for failing to include the browser ballot in Windows 7 SP1.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Large language models such as ChaptGPT have proven to be able to produce remarkably intelligent results, but the energy and monetary costs associated with running these massive algorithms is sky high. It costs $700,000 per day in energy costs to run ChatGPT 3.5, according to recent estimates, and leaves behind a massive carbon footprint in the process.</p><p>In a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02528">new preprint paper</a>, researchers from UC Santa Cruz show that it is possible to eliminate the most computationally expensive element of running large language models, called matrix multiplication, while maintaining performance. In getting rid of matrix multiplication and running their algorithm on custom hardware, the researchers found that they could power a billion-parameter-scale language model on just 13 watts, about equal to the energy of powering a lightbulb and more than 50 times more efficient than typical hardware.&nbsp;</p><p>Even with a slimmed-down algorithm and much less energy consumption, the new, open source model achieves the same performance as state-of-the-art models like Meta’s Llama.</p><p>“We got the same performance at way less cost — all we had to do was fundamentally change how neural networks work,” said Jason Eshraghian, an assistant professor of electrical and computer engineering at the Baskin School of Engineering and the paper’s lead author. “Then we took it a step further and built custom hardware.”</p><p><strong>Understanding the cost&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Until now, all modern neural networks, the algorithms that power large language models, have used a technique called matrix multiplication. In large language models, words are represented as numbers that are then organized into matrices. Matrices are multiplied by each other to produce language, performing operations that weigh the importance of particular words or highlight relationships between words in a sentence or sentences in a paragraph. Larger scale language models have trillions of these numbers.&nbsp;</p><p>“Neural networks, in a way, are glorified matrix multiplication machines,” Eshraghian said. “The larger your matrix, the more things your neural network can learn.”&nbsp;</p><p>For the algorithms to be able to multiply matrices together, the matrices need to be stored somewhere, and then fetched when it comes time to compute. This is solved by storing the matrices on hundreds of physically-separated graphics processing units (GPUs), which are specialized circuits designed to quickly carry out computations on very large datasets, designed by the likes of hardware giant Nvidia. To multiply numbers from matrices on different GPUs, data must be moved around, a process which creates most of the neural network’s costs in terms of time and energy.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Eliminating matrix multiplication&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The researchers came up with a strategy to avoid using matrix multiplication using two main techniques. The first is a method to force all the numbers within the matrices to be ternary, meaning they can take one of three values: negative one, zero, or positive one. This allows the computation to be reduced to summing numbers rather than multiplying.&nbsp;</p><p>From a computer science perspective the two algorithms can be coded the exact same way, but the way Eshraghian’s team’s method works eliminates a ton of cost on the hardware side.&nbsp;</p><p>“From a circuit designer standpoint, you don't need the overhead of multiplication, which carries a whole heap of cost,” Eshraghian said.&nbsp;</p><p>This strategy was inspired by a paper produced by Microsoft that showed it was possible to use ternary numbers in neural networks, but did not go as far as to get rid of matrix multiplication, or open-sourcing their model to the public. To do this, the researchers adjusted the strategy of how the matrices communicate with each other.</p><p>Instead of multiplying every single number in one matrix with every single number in the other matrix, as is typical, the researchers devised a strategy to produce the same mathematical results. In this approach, the matrices are overlaid and only the most important operations are performed.&nbsp;</p><p>“It’s quite light compared to matrix multiplication,” said Rui-Jie Zhu, the paper’s first author and a graduate student in Eshraghian’s group. “We replaced the expensive operation with cheaper operations.”&nbsp;</p><p>Although they reduced the number of operations, the researchers were able to maintain the performance of the neural network by introducing time-based computation in the training of the model. This enables the network to have a “memory” of the important information it processes, enhancing performance. This technique paid off — the researchers compared their model to Meta’s state-of-the-art algorithm called Llama, and were able to achieve the same performance, even at a scale of billions of model parameters.</p><p><strong>Custom chips</strong></p><p>The researchers designed their neural network to operate on GPUs, as they have become ubiquitous in the AI industry, allowing the team’s software to be readily accessible and useful to anyone who might want to use it.</p><p>On standard GPUs, the researchers saw that their neural network achieved about 10 times less memory consumption and operated about 25 percent faster than other models. Reducing the amount of memory needed to run a powerful large language model could provide a path forward to enabling the algorithms to run at full capacity on devices with smaller memory like smartphones.</p><p>Nvidia, the dominant producer of GPUs worldwide, designs their hardware to be highly optimized to perform matrix multiplication, which has enabled them to dominate the industry and launched them to be one of the most profitable companies in the world. However, this hardware is not fully optimized for ternary operations.</p><p>To push the energy savings even further, the team collaborated with Assistant Professor Dustin Richmond and Lecturer Ethan Sifferman in the Baskin Engineering Computer Science and Engineering department to create custom hardware. Over three weeks, the team created a prototype of their hardware on a highly-customizable circuit called a field-programmable gate array (FPGA). This hardware enables them to take full advantage of all the energy-saving features they programmed into the neural network.</p><p>With this custom hardware, the model surpasses human-readable throughput, meaning it produces words faster than the rate a human reads, on just 13 watts of power. Using GPUs would require about 700 watts of power, meaning that the custom hardware achieved more than 50 times the efficiency of GPUs.&nbsp;</p><p>With further development, the researchers believe they can further optimize the technology for even more energy efficiency.</p><p>“These numbers are already really solid, but it is very easy to make them much better,” Eshraghian said. “If we’re able to do this within 13 watts, just imagine what we could do with a whole data center worth of compute power. We’ve got all these resources, but let’s use them effectively.”</p></div></div>]]></description>

<p>It has been nearly a decade since hackers dumped huge amounts of personal data from Ashley Madison, the infamous dating site which, back in 2015, catered mostly to men who wanted to cheat on their wives. Now, that story is back in the media, partly because of a recent <a href="https://www.netflix.com/gb/title/81602884">Netflix</a> documentary about it.</p>
<p>You can see me in that series, a nerdy talking head in clips from various TV news shows from 2015, because I was one of the journalists breaking the story. But neither the Netflix series nor the handful of other documentaries still in the works get at what was truly revolutionary – and chilling – about the Ashley Madison affair.</p>
<p>Generally, the media has focused on the (mainly) men whose names and desires were taken from the company’s subscriber database and shared with the world. But that isn’t a new story. People have been trying to have affairs with strangers for thousands of years. Ashley Madison was never really about that. Avid Life Media, its parent company, wasn’t in the business of sex, it was in the <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ashleymadison-cyber-idUSKCN0ZL09J/">business</a> of bots. Its site became a prototype for what social media platforms such as Facebook are becoming: places so packed with AI-generated nonsense that they feel like spam cages, or information prisons where the only messages that get through are auto-generated ads.</p>
<span></span><p>After a rebrand, Ashley Madison is now owned by Ruby Life and bills itself as a spicy dating site for married people. But back then, it marketed itself as a social networking site for men seeking affairs with women. In late 2015, a group calling itself Impact Team got angry at the site and hacked into its servers. The group grabbed a bunch of user data and code, then posted it on Reddit with the claim that 95 per cent of the people on the site were men. I was intrigued. How could all those men be having affairs, if there were virtually no women on the site?</p>
<p>With the help of two hackers and a database expert, I decided to find out. What I <a href="https://gizmodo.com/ashley-madison-code-shows-more-women-and-more-bots-1727613924">discovered</a> was a bizarre scam – though it was far more like <i>Westworld</i> than US reality show <i>Cheaters</i>. The company had systematically created an army of fake women, mostly very simple chatbots called engagers, who would flirt with men to lure them into paying for a subscription to the site. As I <a href="https://gizmodo.com/almost-none-of-the-women-in-the-ashley-madison-database-1725558944">wrote</a> in 2015, “it’s like a science fictional future where every woman on Earth is dead, and some Dilbert-like engineer has replaced them with badly-designed robots”. Back then, I repeatedly contacted Avid Life Media for comment, but it wouldn’t reply.</p>
<p>As we pored over the code, we found that, although there were a few human women on the site, more than 11 million interactions logged in the database were between human men and female bots. And the men had to pay for every single message they sent. For most of their millions of users, Ashley Madison affairs were entirely a fantasy built out of threadbare chatbot pick-up lines like “how r u?” or “whats up?”</p>
<p>There were real women behind the curtain, though. We found company emails in the data dump and discovered that Avid Life Media was also <a href="https://gizmodo.com/ashley-madison-code-shows-more-women-and-more-bots-1727613924#_ga=1.211307349.1523925811.1419643295">paying</a> a small number of workers to generate fake profiles for more than 70,000 engager bots.</p>
<p>One of these workers <a href="https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/ex-employees-lawsuit-over-wrist-injury-frivolous-dating-website-for-cheaters-says/article15380399/">sued</a> the company in 2013, arguing that she had been required to type up so many fake profiles that she permanently injured her wrists (the lawsuit was dropped in 2015). It gets weirder: we found an internal email where employees discussed a <a href="https://gizmodo.com/how-ashley-madison-hid-its-fembot-con-from-users-and-in-1728410265">tool</a> they had built called fraud-to-engager, which automatically converted fraudulent profiles from other Avid Life Media sites into Ashley Madison bot profiles. “Should tweak it and rename it,” one employee suggested.</p>
<p>At the time, I was shocked by the sheer number of fake women. I <a href="https://gizmodo.com/the-fembots-of-ashley-madison-1726670394">wrote</a>: “Instead of looking at Ashley Madison as a dating site, I think it’s more accurate to call it an anti-community—a hugely popular social site where it’s impossible to be social, because the men can’t talk to each other, most of the women are fake, and the only interaction available is with credit card payments.”</p>
<p>Nine years later, this could describe any number of social media sites that have become swamped with bots and AI-generated absurdity – and charge you for the privilege of interacting with techno-phantoms. Currently, Facebook is trying to figure out how to deal with millions of fake images generated by AI, while Google’s AI bot Overviews is telling users to <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2433133-can-google-fix-its-disastrous-new-ai-search-tool/">glue cheese to pizza</a>. The problem is, human beings are interacting with these AI images and suggestions, in some cases imagining they are engaging with real people.</p>
<p>It is like the whole world has become the Ashley Madison of 2015, and the more we want to talk to each other about it, the less likely we are to find a human to talk to.</p>

<p>One of Windows 11's more contentious changes is that, by default, both the Home and Pro editions of the operating system require users to sign in with a Microsoft account during setup. Signing in with an account does get you some benefits, at least if you're a regular user of other Microsoft products like OneDrive, GamePass, or Microsoft 365 (<a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/10/rip-to-microsoft-office-henceforth-to-be-known-as-microsoft-365/">aka Office</a>). But if you don't use those services, a lot of what a Microsoft account gets you in Windows 11 is <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/08/windows-11-has-made-the-clean-windows-install-an-oxymoron/">repeated ads and reminders</a> about signing up for those services. Using Windows with a traditional local account is still extremely possible, but it does require a small amount of know-how beyond just clicking the right buttons.</p>

<p>On the know-how front, Microsoft has taken one more minor, but nevertheless irritating, step away from allowing users to sign in with local accounts. This <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/change-from-a-local-account-to-a-microsoft-account-395203bf-9f1b-eb24-b042-5b8dae6c1d20">official Microsoft support page</a> walks users with local accounts through the process of signing in to a Microsoft account. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240612104753/https:/support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/change-from-a-local-account-to-a-microsoft-account-395203bf-9f1b-eb24-b042-5b8dae6c1d20">As recently as June 12</a>, that page also included instructions for converting a Microsoft account into a local account. But according to Tom's Hardware and the Internet Wayback Machine, those instructions <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240617103839/https:/support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/change-from-a-local-account-to-a-microsoft-account-395203bf-9f1b-eb24-b042-5b8dae6c1d20">disappeared on or around June 17</a> and haven't been seen since.</p>
<p>Despite the documentation change, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/02/what-i-do-to-clean-up-a-clean-install-of-windows-11-23h2-and-edge/">most of the workarounds</a> for creating a local account still work in both Windows 11 23H2 (the publicly available version of Windows 11 for most PCs) and 24H2 (<a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/06/windows-11-24h2-is-released-to-the-public-but-only-on-copilot-pcs-for-now/">available now on Copilot+ PCs</a>, later this fall for everyone else). The easiest way to do it on a PC you just took out of the box is to press Shift+F10 during the setup process to bring up a command prompt window, typing <code>OOBE\BYPASSNRO</code>, rebooting, and then clicking the "I don't have Internet" button when asked to connect to a Wi-Fi network.</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>Other workarounds include using the Rufus tool to create a USB installer that will automatically bypass the Microsoft account sign-in requirement, or (for Windows 11 Pro users) indicating that you want to join the PC to a corporate domain and then not actually joining it to a domain. Setting the PC up with a Microsoft account and then signing out afterward is also still an option.</p>
<p>There is one workaround that has allegedly stopped working—it used to be that trying to "sign in" with a nonexistent email account would get you a local sign-in option. But as of earlier this month, <a href="https://x.com/zacbowden/status/1797496910737252744">according to Windows Central editor Zac Bowden</a>, it looks like the Windows 11 setup screen will just ask you to try another email address instead.</p>
<p>To be fair to Microsoft, all the big tech companies want you to sign in with an account before you can use all the features of the software, but neither Apple nor Google goes as far as to <em>mandate</em> account sign-in to access basic functionality. Macs, iPhones, and iPads will all let you complete the setup process without signing in, though you do have to know which buttons to click. Google will allow you to use Chromebooks in guest mode, and Android phones and tablets are still usable without signing in (though this does make it more difficult to find and install apps). Microsoft's pushiness remains unique; there's definitely a difference between a company that would&nbsp;<em>really</em> prefer that you sign in and one that forces you to.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
        
        <p>So I was at the <a href="https://www.localfirstconf.com/" target="_blank">Local-First Conf</a> the other day, listening to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMq0vncHJvU" target="_blank">Martin Kleppmann</a>, and this slide caught my attention:</p>
        <figure>
<img src="https://tonsky.me/blog/crdt-filesync/talk.webp?t=1719240073" width="720" height="405">        </figure>
        <p>Specifically, this part:</p>
        <figure>
<img src="https://tonsky.me/blog/crdt-filesync/talk2.webp?t=1719240073" width="720" height="550">        </figure>
        <p>But first, some context.</p>
        <h2 id="what-is-local-first">What is local-first?</h2>
        <p>For the long version, go to Ink &amp; Switch, who coined the term: <a href="https://www.inkandswitch.com/local-first/" target="_blank">www.inkandswitch.com/local-first/</a></p>
        <p>Here’s my short version:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>It’s software.</li>
          <li>That prefers keeping your data local.</li>
          <li>But it still goes to the internet occasionally to sync with other users, fetch data, back up, etc.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If it doesn’t go to the internet at all, it’s just local software.</p>
        <p>If it doesn’t work offline with data it already has, then it’s just normal cloud software. You all know the type — sorry, Dave, I can’t play the song I just downloaded because your internet disappeared for one second...</p>
        <p>But somewhere in the middle — local-first. We love it because it’s good for the end user, you and me, not for the corporations that produce it.</p>
        <h2 id="whats-the-problem-with-local-first">What’s the problem with local-first?</h2>
        <p>The goal of local-first software is to get control back into the hands of the user, right? You own the data (literally, it’s on your device), yada-yada-yada. That part works great.</p>
        <p>However, local-first software still has this online component. For example, personal local-first software still needs to sync between your own devices. And syncing doesn’t work without a server...</p>
        <p>So here we have a problem: somebody writes local-first software. Everybody who bought it can use it until the heat death of the universe. They <em>own</em> it.</p>
        <p>But if the company goes out of business, syncing will stop working. And companies go out of business all the time.</p>
        <figure>
<img src="https://tonsky.me/blog/crdt-filesync/bonto.webp?t=1719240073" width="720" height="375">        </figure>
        <p>What do we do?</p>
        <h2 id="cue-dropbox">Cue Dropbox</h2>
        <p>The solution is to use something widely available that will probably outlive our company. We need something popular, accessible to everyone,  has multiple implementations, and can serve as a sync server.</p>
        <p>And what’s the most common end-user application of cloud sync?</p>
        <p>Dropbox! Well, not necessarily Dropbox, but any cloud-based file-syncing solution. iCloud Drive, OneDrive, Google Drive, <a href="https://tonsky.me/blog/syncthing/">Syncthing</a>, etc.</p>
        <p>It’s perfect — many people already have it. There are multiple implementations, so if Microsoft or Apple go out of business, people can always switch to alternatives. File syncing is a commodity.</p>
        <p>But file syncing is a “dumb” protocol. You can’t “hook” into sync events, or update notifications, or conflict resolution. There isn’t much API; you just save files and they get synced. In case of conflict, best case, you get two files. Worst — you get only one :)</p>
        <p>This simplicity has an upside and a downside. The upside is: if you can work with that, it would work everywhere. That’s the interoperability part from Martin’s talk.</p>
        <p>The downside is: you can’t do much with it, and it probably won’t be optimal. But will it be enough?</p>
        <h2 id="version-1-super-naive">Version 1: Super-naive</h2>
        <p>Let’s just save our state in a file and let Dropbox sync it (in my case, I’m using Syncthing, but it’s the same idea. From now on, I’ll use “Dropbox” as a common noun).</p>
        <p>Simple:</p>
        <figure>
<img src="https://tonsky.me/blog/crdt-filesync/naive.webp?t=1719240073" width="685" height="280">        </figure>
        <p>But what happens if you change the state on two machines? Well, you get a conflict file:</p>
        <figure>
<img src="https://tonsky.me/blog/crdt-filesync/naive_conflict.webp?t=1719240073" width="685" height="280">        </figure>
        <p>Normally, it would’ve been a problem. But it’s not if you are using CRDT!</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>CRDT is a collection of data types that all share a very nice property: they can always be merged. It’s not always the perfect merge, and not everything can be made into a CRDT, but IF you can put your data into a CRDT, you can be sure: all merges will go without conflicts.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>With CRDT, we can solve conflicts by opening both files, merging states, and saving back to <code>state.xml</code>. Simple!</p>
        <p>Even in this form, Dropbox as a common sync layer works! There are some downsides, though:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>conflicting file names are different between providers,</li>
          <li>some providers might not handle conflicts at all,</li>
          <li>it needs state-based CRDT.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 id="version-2-a-file-per-client">Version 2: A file per client</h2>
        <p>The only way to avoid conflicts is to always edit locally. So let’s give each client its own file!</p>
        <figure>
<img src="https://tonsky.me/blog/crdt-filesync/file_per_client.webp?t=1719240073" width="685" height="280">        </figure>
        <p>Now we just watch when files from other clients get changed and merge them with our own.</p>
        <p>And because each file is only edited on one machine, Dropbox will not report any conflicts. Any conflicts inside the data will be resolved by us via CRDT magic.</p>
        <h2 id="version-3-operations-based">Version 3: Operations-based</h2>
        <p>What if your CRDT is operation-based? Meaning, it’s easier to send operations around, not the whole state?</p>
        <p>You can always write operations into a separate append-only file. Again, each client only writes to its own, so no conflicts on the Dropbox level:</p>
        <figure>
<img src="https://tonsky.me/blog/crdt-filesync/ops.webp?t=1719240073" width="685" height="280">        </figure>
        <p>Now, the operations log can grow quite long, and we can’t count on Dropbox to reliably and efficiently sync only parts of the file that were updated.</p>
        <p>In that case, we split operations into chunks. Less work for Dropbox to sync and less for us to catch up:</p>
        <figure>
<img src="https://tonsky.me/blog/crdt-filesync/ops_batches.webp?t=1719240073" width="685" height="280">        </figure>
        <p>You can, of course, save the position in the file to only apply operations you haven’t seen. Basic stuff.</p>
        <p>Theoretically, you should be able to do operational transformations this way, too.</p>
        <h2 id="demo">Demo</h2>
        <p>A very simple proof-of-concept demo is at <a href="https://github.com/tonsky/crdt-filesync" target="_blank">github.com/tonsky/crdt-filesync</a>.</p>
        <p>Here’s a video of it in action:</p>
        <figure>
          <video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" preload="auto" playsinline="" controls="" width="720" height="721">
            <source src="https://tonsky.me/blog/crdt-filesync/demo.mp4?t=1719240073" type="video/mp4">
          </video>
        </figure>
        <p>Under the hood, it uses Automerge for merging text edits. So it’s a proper CRDT, not just two files merging text diffs.</p>
        <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
        <p>If you set out to build a local-first application that users have complete control and ownership over, you need something to solve data sync.</p>
        <p>Dropbox and other file-sync services, while very basic, offer enough to implement it in a simple but working way.</p>
        <p>Sure, it won’t be as real-time as a custom solution, but it’s still better for casual syncs. Think Apple Photos: only your own photos, not real-time, but you know they will be everywhere by the end of the day. And that’s good enough!</p>
        <p>Imagine if Obsidian Sync was just “put your files in the folder” and it would give you conflict-free sync? For free? Forever? Just bring your own cloud?</p>
        <p>I’d say it sounds pretty good.</p>

</figure><p>Technology giants such as Meta and Microsoft are describing their artificial intelligence (AI) models as ‘open source’ while failing to disclose important information about the underlying technology, say researchers who analysed a host of popular chatbot models.</p><p>The definition of open source when it comes to AI models is not yet agreed, but advocates say that ’full’ openness boosts science, and is crucial for <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05707-8" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05707-8" data-track-category="body text link">efforts to make AI accountable</a>. What counts as open source is likely to take on increased importance when the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-00497-8" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-00497-8" data-track-category="body text link">European Union’s Artificial Intelligence Act</a> comes into force. The legislation will apply less strict regulations to models that are classed as open.</p><p>Some big firms are reaping the benefits of claiming to have open-source models, while trying “to get away with disclosing as little as possible”, says Mark Dingemanse, a language scientist at Radboud University in Nijmegen, the Netherlands. This practice is known as open-washing.</p><p>“To our surprise, it was the small players, with relatively few resources, that go the extra mile,” says Dingemanse, who together with his colleague Andreas Liesenfeld, a computational linguist, created a league table that identifies the most and least open models (see table). They published their findings on 5 June in the conference proceedings of the 2024 ACM Conference on Fairness, Accountability and Transparency<sup><a href="#ref-CR1" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">1</a></sup>.</p><p>The study cuts through “a lot of the hype and fluff around the current open-sourcing debate”, says Abeba Birhane, a cognitive scientist at Trinity College Dublin and adviser on AI accountability to Mozilla Foundation, a non-profit organization based in Mountain View, California.</p><h2>Defining openness</h2><p>The term ’open source’ comes from software, where it means access to source code and no limits on a program’s use or distribution. But given the complexity of large AI models and the huge volumes of data involved, making them open source is far from straightforward, and experts are still <a href="https://opensource.org/deepdive/drafts" data-track="click" data-label="https://opensource.org/deepdive/drafts" data-track-category="body text link">working to define open-source AI</a>. Revealing all facets of a model is not always desirable for companies, because it can expose them to commercial or legal risks, says Dingemanse. Others argue that releasing models completely freely risks misuse.</p><article data-label="Related">

 </article><p>But being labelled as open source can also bring big benefits. Developers can already reap public-relations rewards from presenting themselves as rigorous and transparent. And soon there will be legal implications. The EU’s AI Act, which passed this year, will exempt open-source general-purpose models, up to a certain size, from extensive transparency requirements, and commit them to lesser and as-yet-undefined obligations. “It’s fair to say the term open source will take on unprecedented legal weight in the countries governed by the EU AI Act,” says Dingemanse.</p><p>In their study, Dingemanse and Liesenfeld assessed 40 large language models — systems that learn to generate text by making associations between words and phrases in large volumes of data. All these models claim to be ‘open source’ or ‘open’. The pair made an openness league table by assessing models on 14 parameters, including the availability of code and training data, what documentation is published and how easy the model is to access. For each parameter, they judged whether the models were open, partially open or closed.</p><p>This sliding-scale approach to analysing openness is a useful and practical one, says Amanda Brock, chief executive officer of OpenUK, a London-based not-for-profit company that focuses on open technology.</p><p>The researchers found that many models that claim to be open or open source — including Llama from Meta and Google DeepMind’s Gemma — are, in fact, just ‘open weight’. This means that outside researchers can access and use the trained models, but cannot inspect or customize them. Nor can they fully understand how they were fine-tuned for specific tasks; for example, using human feedback. “You don’t give a lot away … then you get to claim openness credits,” says Dingemanse.</p><article data-label="Related">

 </article><p>Particularly worrying, say the authors, is the lack of openness about what data the models are trained on. Around half of the models that they analysed do not provide any details about data sets beyond generic descriptors, they say.</p><p>A Google spokesperson says that the company is “precise about the language” it uses to describe models, choosing to label its Gemma LLM as open rather than open source. “Existing open-source concepts can’t always be directly applied to AI systems,” they added. Microsoft tries to be “as precise as possible about what is available and to what extent”, a spokesperson says. “We choose to make artifacts like models, code, tools, and datasets publicly available because the developer and research communities have an important role to play in the advancement of AI technology.” Meta did not respond to a request for comment from <i>Nature</i>.</p><p>Models made by smaller firms and research groups tended to be more open than those of their big-tech counterparts, the analysis found. The authors highlight BLOOM, built by an international, largely academic collaboration, as an <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-01705-z" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-01705-z" data-track-category="body text link">example of truly open-source AI</a>.</p><h2>Peer review ‘out of fashion’</h2><p>Scientific papers detailing the models are extremely rare, the pair found. Peer review seems to have “almost completely fallen out of fashion”, being replaced by blog posts with cherry-picked examples, or corporate preprints that are low on detail. Companies “might release a nice, flashy looking paper on their website, which all looks very technical. But if you pore over it, there is no specification whatsoever of what data went into that system”, says Dingemanse.</p><p>It is not yet clear how many of these models will fit the EU’s definition of open source. Under the act, this would refer to models that are released under a “free and open” licence that, for example, allows users to modify a model but says nothing about access to training data. Refining this definition will probably form “a single pressure point that will be targeted by corporate lobbies and big companies”, the paper says.</p><article data-label="Related">

 </article><p>And openness matters for science, says Dingemanse, because it is essential for reproducibility. “If you can’t reproduce it, it’s a hard sell to call it science,” he says. The only way for researchers to innovate is by tinkering with models, and to do this they need enough information to build their own versions. Not only that, but <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-00530-0" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-00530-0" data-track-category="body text link">models must be open to scrutiny</a>. “If we cannot look inside to know how the sausage is made, we also don’t know whether to be impressed by it,” Dingemanse says.

And without data accountability, no one knows whether <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05707-8" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05707-8" data-track-category="body text link">inappropriate or copyrighted data</a> has been used, he adds.</p><p>Liesenfeld says that the pair hope to help fellow scientists to avoid “falling into the same traps we fell into”, when looking for models to use in teaching and research.</p>

    </div><p>A biofriendly new material made from barley starch blended with fiber from sugarbeet waste—a strong material that turns into compost should it end up in nature—has been created at the University of Copenhagen. In the long term, the researchers hope that their invention can help put the brakes on plastic pollution while reducing the climate footprint of plastic production.</p>


										      
																																	<p>Enormous islands of plastic float in our oceans and microscopic particles of it are in our bodies. The durability, malleability and low cost of plastics has made them ubiquitous, from packaging to clothing to aircraft parts. But plastics have a downside. Plastics contaminate nature, are tough to recycle and their production emits more CO<sub>2</sub> than all air traffic combined.</p>
<p>Now, researchers at the University of Copenhagen's Department of Plant and Environmental Sciences have invented a new material made from modified starch that can completely decompose in nature—and do so within only two months. The material is made using natural plant material from crops and could be used for food packaging, among many other things.</p>
<p>"We have an enormous problem with our plastic waste that recycling seems incapable of solving. Therefore, we've developed a new type of bioplastic that is stronger and can better withstand water than current bioplastics. At the same time, our material is 100% biodegradable and can be converted into compost by microorganisms if it ends up somewhere other than a bin," says Professor Andreas Blennow of the Department of Plant and Environmental Sciences.</p>
<p>Only about 9% of plastic is recycled globally, with the rest being either incinerated or winding up in nature or dumped into enormous plastic landfills.</p>
<p>Bioplastics already exist, but the name is misleading says Blennow. While today's bioplastics are made of bio-derived materials, only a limited part of them is actually degradable, and only under special conditions in industrial composting plants.</p>
<p>"I don't find the name suitable because the most common types of bioplastics don't break down that easily if tossed into nature. The process can take many years and some of it continues to pollute as microplastic. Specialized facilities are needed to break down bioplastics. And even then, a very limited part of them can be recycled, with the rest ending up as waste," says the researcher.</p>

																																						
																																			<h2>Starch from barley and sugar industry waste</h2>
<p>The new material is a so-called biocomposite and composed of several different substances that decompose naturally. Its main ingredients, amylose and cellulose, are common across the plant kingdom. Amylose is extracted from many crops including corn, potatoes, wheat and barley.</p>
<p>Together with researchers from Aarhus University, the research team founded a spinoff company in which they developed a barley variety that produces pure amylose in its kernels. This new variety is important because pure amylose is far less likely to turn into a paste when it interacts with water compared to regular starch.</p>
<p>Cellulose is a carbohydrate found in all plants and we know it from cotton and linen fibers, as well as from wood and paper products. The cellulose used by the researchers is a so-called nanocellulose made from local sugar industry waste. And these nanocellulose fibers, which are one thousand times smaller than the fibers of linen and cotton, are what contribute to the material's mechanical strength.</p>
<p>"Amylose and cellulose form long, strong molecular chains. Combining them has allowed us to create a durable, flexible material that has the potential to be used for shopping bags and the packaging of goods that we now wrap in plastic," says Blennow.</p>
<p>The new biomaterial is produced by either dissolving the raw materials in water and mixing them together or by heating them under pressure. By doing so, small "pellets" or chips are created that can then be processed and compressed into a desired form.</p>
<p>Thus far, the researchers have only produced prototypes in the laboratory. But according to Blennow, getting production started in Denmark and many other places in the world would be relatively easy.</p>
<p>"The entire production chain of amylose-rich starch already exists. Indeed, millions of tons of pure potato and corn starch are produced every year and used by the food industry and elsewhere. Therefore, easy access to the majority of our ingredients is guaranteed for the large-scale production of this material," he says.</p>

																																			<h2>Could reduce plastic problem</h2>
<p>Blennow and his fellow researchers are now processing a <a href="https://phys.org/tags/patent+application/" rel="tag">patent application</a> that, once it has been approved, could pave the way for production of the new biocomposite material. Because, despite the huge sums of money being devoted to sorting and recycling our plastic, the researcher does not believe that it will really be a success. Doing so should be seen as a transitional technology until we bid fossil-based plastics a final farewell.</p>
<p>"Recycling plastic efficiently is anything but straightforward. Different things in plastics must be separated from each other and there are major differences between plastic types, meaning that the process must be done in a safe way so that no contaminants end up in the <a href="https://phys.org/tags/recycled+plastic/" rel="tag">recycled plastic</a>.</p>
<p>"At the same time, countries and consumers must sort their plastic. This is a massive task that I don't see us succeeding at. Instead, we should rethink things in terms of utilizing new materials that perform like plastic, but don't pollute the planet," says Blennow.</p>
<p>The researcher is already collaborating with two Danish packaging companies to develop prototypes for food packaging, among other things. He envisions many other uses for the material as well, such as for the interior trims of cars by the automotive industry. Though it is difficult to say when this biofriendly barley-based plastic will reach the shelves, the researcher predicts that the <a href="https://phys.org/tags/new+material/" rel="tag">new material</a> may become a reality in the foreseeable future.</p>
<p>"It's quite close to the point where we can really start producing prototypes in collaboration with our research team and companies. I think it's realistic that different prototypes in soft and hard packaging, such as trays, bottles and bags, will be developed within one to five years," concludes Blennow.</p>

    </div><p>Titan, Saturn's largest moon, is the only other planetary body in the solar system that currently hosts active rivers, lakes, and seas. These otherworldly river systems are thought to be filled with liquid methane and ethane that flows into wide lakes and seas, some as large as the Great Lakes on Earth.</p>


										      
																																	
<p>The existence of Titan's large seas and smaller lakes was confirmed in 2007, with images taken by NASA's Cassini spacecraft. Since then, scientists have pored over those and other images for clues to the moon's mysterious liquid environment.</p>
<p>Now, MIT geologists have studied Titan's shorelines and shown through simulations that the moon's large seas have likely been shaped by <a href="https://phys.org/tags/waves/" rel="tag">waves</a>. Until now, scientists have found indirect and conflicting signs of wave activity, based on remote images of Titan's surface.</p>
<p>The MIT team took a different approach to investigate the presence of waves on Titan, by first modeling the ways in which a lake can erode on Earth. They then applied their modeling to Titan's seas to determine what form of erosion could have produced the shorelines in Cassini's images. Waves, they found, were the most likely explanation.</p>
<p>The researchers emphasize that their results are not definitive; to confirm that there are waves on Titan will require direct observations of wave activity on the moon's surface.</p>
<p>"We can say, based on our results, that if the coastlines of Titan's seas have eroded, waves are the most likely culprit," says Taylor Perron, the Cecil and Ida Green Professor of Earth, Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences at MIT.</p>
<p>"If we could stand at the edge of one of Titan's seas, we might see waves of liquid methane and ethane lapping on the shore and crashing on the coasts during storms. And they would be capable of eroding the material that the coast is made of."</p>
<p>Perron and his colleagues, including first author Rose Palermo, a former MIT-WHOI Joint Program graduate student and a research geologist at the U.S. Geological Survey, <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adn4192" target="_blank">published</a> their study in <i>Science Advances</i>. Their co-authors include MIT research scientist Jason Soderblom, former MIT postdoc Sam Birch, now an assistant professor at Brown University, Andrew Ashton at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, and Alexander Hayes of Cornell University.</p>

																																						
																																			<h2>'Taking a different tack'</h2>
<p>The presence of waves on Titan has been a somewhat controversial topic ever since Cassini spotted bodies of liquid on the moon's surface.</p>
<p>"Some people who tried to see evidence for waves didn't see any, and said, "These seas are mirror-smooth," Palermo says. "Others said they did see some roughness on the liquid surface but weren't sure if waves caused it."</p>
<p>Knowing whether Titan's seas host wave activity could give scientists information about the moon's climate, such as the strength of the winds that could whip up such waves. Wave information could also help scientists predict how the shape of Titan's seas might evolve over time.</p>
<p>Rather than look for direct signs of wave-like features in images of Titan, Perron says the team had to "take a different tack, and see, just by looking at the shape of the shoreline, if we could tell what's been eroding the coasts."</p>
<p>Titan's seas are thought to have formed as rising levels of liquid flooded a landscape crisscrossed by river valleys. The researchers zeroed in on three scenarios for what could have happened next: no <a href="https://phys.org/tags/coastal+erosion/" rel="tag">coastal erosion</a>; erosion driven by waves; and "uniform erosion," driven either by "dissolution," in which liquid passively dissolves a coast's material, or a mechanism in which the coast gradually sloughs off under its own weight.</p>
<p>The researchers simulated how various shoreline shapes would evolve under each of the three scenarios. To simulate wave-driven erosion, they took into account a variable known as "fetch," which describes the physical distance from one point on a shoreline to the opposite side of a lake or sea.</p>

																																			<p>"Wave erosion is driven by the height and angle of the wave," Palermo explains. "We used fetch to approximate wave height because the bigger the fetch, the longer the distance over which wind can blow and waves can grow."</p>
<p>To test how shoreline shapes would differ between the three scenarios, the researchers started with a simulated sea with flooded river valleys around its edges. For wave-driven erosion, they calculated the fetch distance from every single point along the shoreline to every other point, and converted these distances to wave heights.</p>
<p>Then, they ran their simulation to see how waves would erode the starting shoreline over time. They compared this to how the same shoreline would evolve under erosion driven by uniform erosion. The team repeated this comparative modeling for hundreds of different starting shoreline shapes.</p>
<p>They found that the end shapes were very different depending on the underlying mechanism. Most notably, uniform erosion produced inflated shorelines that widened evenly all around, even in the flooded river valleys, whereas wave erosion mainly smoothed the parts of the shorelines exposed to long fetch distances, leaving the flooded valleys narrow and rough.</p>
<p>"We had the same starting shorelines, and we saw that you get a really different final shape under uniform erosion versus wave erosion," Perron says. "They all kind of look like the flying spaghetti monster because of the flooded <a href="https://phys.org/tags/river+valleys/" rel="tag">river valleys</a>, but the two types of erosion produce very different endpoints."</p>
<p>The team checked their results by comparing their simulations to actual lakes on Earth. They found the same difference in shape between Earth lakes known to have been eroded by waves and lakes affected by uniform erosion, such as dissolving limestone.</p>

																																						
																																			<h2>A shore's shape</h2>
<p>Their modeling revealed clear, characteristic <a href="https://phys.org/tags/shoreline/" rel="tag">shoreline</a> shapes, depending on the mechanism by which they evolved. The team then wondered: Where would Titan's shorelines fit, within these characteristic shapes?</p>
<p>In particular, they focused on four of Titan's largest, most well-mapped seas: Kraken Mare, which is comparable in size to the Caspian Sea; Ligeia Mare, which is larger than Lake Superior; Punga Mare, which is longer than Lake Victoria; and Ontario Lacus, which is about 20 percent the size of its terrestrial namesake.</p>
<p>The team mapped the shorelines of each Titan sea using Cassini's radar images, and then applied their modeling to each of the sea's shorelines to see which erosion mechanism best explained their shape. They found that all four seas fit solidly in the wave-driven erosion model, meaning that waves produced shorelines that most closely resembled Titan's four seas.</p>
<p>"We found that if the coastlines have eroded, their shapes are more consistent with erosion by waves than by uniform erosion or no erosion at all," Perron says.</p>
<p>The researchers are working to determine how strong Titan's winds must be in order to stir up waves that could repeatedly chip away at the coasts. They also hope to decipher, from the <a href="https://phys.org/tags/shape/" rel="tag">shape</a> of Titan's shorelines, from which directions the wind is predominantly blowing.</p>
<p>"Titan presents this case of a completely untouched system," Palermo says. "It could help us learn more fundamental things about how coasts erode without the influence of people, and maybe that can help us better manage our coastlines on Earth in the future."</p>

<p dir="auto">Twonkie is a USB-PD sniffer/injector/sink based on a Google project called Twinkie, re-engineered to be made in one-off quantities by mere mortals.</p>
<p dir="auto">Twinkie is a great and pretty low-cost solution, and it's open-source so anyone could make their own, but unfortunately the Twinkie design uses a six-layer PCB and all BGA/wafer-scale parts - both of which are usually unavailable to the humble hobbyist.</p>
<p dir="auto">So I designed the Twonkie, a slightly wonky sibling of Twinkie. It uses a four-layer PCB that can be manufactured cheaply by lots of services like OSHPark, and it makes a point to use only leaded parts for easier soldering (though the main microcontroller can optionally be QFN too via a dual footprint). The most difficult parts are likely the passives which are all 0402, and the USB-C connectors which are used in an unconventional way by misusing 90° upright connectors as 1.6mm straddle mounts (living up to the concept of being wonky).</p>

<li>The USB-C connectors are attached in a hair-raising straddle mount configuration. The way they're soldered to the PCB makes them rock solid though, maybe even more solid than the original Twinkie, and they transfer TB3 20Gbit/s lanes just fine.</li>

<p dir="auto">The 2.0 version uses a different voltage/current monitor chip compared to Twonkie v1.0, the <a href="https://github.com/dojoe/Twonkie/blob/master/ref/ina237.pdf">INA237</a>, which supports higher bus voltages and therefore makes the Twonkie hardware ready for Extended Power Range (EPR). The INA260 used by Twonkie v1.0 (and the INA231 used by Twinkie) will take damage if subjected to the up to 48V specified by EPR.</p>

<p dir="auto">I'm glad you asked! Get the board made via the OSH Park link above, or supply the v2.0 Gerbers in this repository to a PCB fab of your choice, get the parts from Digikey or Mouser or what have you, and follow the <a href="https://github.com/dojoe/Twonkie/blob/master/hw/README.md">Assembly instructions</a> to build the device. I recommend ordering a few extra parts: Get one more of each Type-C connector since you're going to modify them in ways that might end up with a broken connector, and generously round up the number of 0402 passives since you're going to drop some of them and you will <em>never</em> find them again :)</p>
<p dir="auto">For the firmware, there are <a href="https://github.com/dojoe/Twonkie/blob/master/fw/README.md">Instructions for building and flashing</a> in the <a href="https://github.com/dojoe/Twonkie/blob/master/fw">fw</a> directory.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">None of the parts are available 😭 What do I do?</h2><a id="user-content-none-of-the-parts-are-available--what-do-i-do" aria-label="Permalink: None of the parts are available 😭 What do I do?" href="#none-of-the-parts-are-available--what-do-i-do"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Here are some ideas about replacements for some parts that are most likely to be unavailable. None of these have been tested so you're on your own!</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><strong>INA237:</strong> The INA237 is part of a device family and has two siblings with higher specs that TI claims are drop-in replacements: INA228 and INA238.</li>
<li><strong>STM32F072CB:</strong> For one, the Twonkie has a dual footprint that will fit both the TQFP and QFN variants, i.e. the STM32F072CBT and STM32F072CBU. And if you are willing to sacrifice the PD sink functionaliy and only need the sniffer functionality you could also try the variants with 64k flash instead of 128k (STM32F072C8*) and only flash the first half of the firmware binary. Other device families than the F072 would require extensive firmware changes so I can't recommend that.</li>
<li><strong>USB-C plug / receptacle:</strong> These might be a little trickier. Basically you need one that's meant for being mounted standing up on a board, has all USB-C pins wired out to L shaped pins and doesn't have any metal mounting prongs protruding into the board plane (or if it has you'll have to cut them off).</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">I am a noob trying to solder and replicate the Twonkie. Got any beginner tips?</h2><a id="user-content-i-am-a-noob-trying-to-solder-and-replicate-the-twonkie-got-any-beginner-tips" aria-label="Permalink: I am a noob trying to solder and replicate the Twonkie. Got any beginner tips?" href="#i-am-a-noob-trying-to-solder-and-replicate-the-twonkie-got-any-beginner-tips"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The KiCad schematic file contains the vendor part numbers and DigiKey order numbers for each part designator, and I exported the full list into a .csv file too - those are commonly called "Bill of materials" or BOM for short, and <a href="https://github.com/dojoe/Twonkie/blob/master/hw/v2.0/twonkie.bom.csv">this is the one for Twonkie 2.0</a>. You should be able to punch those part numbers into a parts supplier of your choice (I usually use <a href="https://digikey.com/" rel="nofollow">DigiKey</a> but there are plenty others) to find the parts you need. If they have parts in stock they'll happily sell you small quantities, though at an increased price. Take care to order more of most parts than you need - especially the tiny passives (resistors, capacitors...) are easy to lose during assembly.</p>
<p dir="auto">As for reading the schematic, it probably helps to have some familiarity with <a href="https://www.usb.org/document-library/usb-power-delivery" rel="nofollow">USB-PD</a> and the <a href="https://www.chromium.org/chromium-os/twinkie" rel="nofollow">original project description</a>, and then read up on the <a href="https://github.com/dojoe/Twonkie/blob/master/ref">device datasheets</a> to understand which part does what.</p>
<p dir="auto">Having said all that, please be warned that the Twonkie is not exactly a noob project - unless you're already familiar with hand-soldering fine pitch SMT parts you may be in for a frustrating experience. Don't let that keep you from trying, but you should know what you're signing up for :)</p>

<p>Microsoft’s team of hardware wizards have spent the last couple of years practicing their Reparo spell and it’s really starting to show. And we’ve noticed, it’s hard not to. It wasn’t that long ago that the Surface team surprised us with a tablet that went from <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Teardown/Microsoft+Surface+Pro+Teardown/12842">1/10 in 2013</a> to<a href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/68671/does-the-surface-pro-9-mark-a-turning-point-for-repairability-at-microsoft"> a stunning 7/10</a> in 2022. Needless to say, the new CoPilot+ devices definitely warranted a check in to see how repair was fairing over at Microsoft.</p>



<p>We weren’t disappointed.</p>



<figure><p>

</p></figure>



<p>This time around we decided to take a look at both Surface Pro and Surface Laptop devices. The first time we tore down a Surface Laptop it received an <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Teardown/Microsoft+Surface+Laptop+Teardown/92915">abysmal 0/10</a>. Some claimed the score was too harsh, our Teardown Engineers thought it wasn’t harsh enough.</p>

<h2>Surface Laptop 7</h2>



<p>The Surface Laptop 7 is an astonishingly repair friendly device, almost the antithesis of the original Surface Laptop. It’s no Framework 13, but it clearly draws inspiration from it.</p>



<p>One of the first things you’ll see when removing the magnetically secured bottom plate is a QR code taking you to the service manuals on Microsoft’s website. The manuals were made available the very day the device was released, something we rarely see in any product category.</p>



<p>The next things you’ll notice are tiny symbols (Microsoft calls them Wayfinders) indicating which component is being secured by the type and quantity of screws. You could easily disassemble this device without using the manual thanks to these Wayfinders.</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" width="3585" height="2390" src="https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2024/06/21164657/wayfinders.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2024/06/21164657/wayfinders.jpg 3585w, https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2024/06/21164657/wayfinders-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2024/06/21164657/wayfinders-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2024/06/21164657/wayfinders-1350x900.jpg 1350w, https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2024/06/21164657/wayfinders-300x200.jpg 300w, https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2024/06/21164657/wayfinders-600x400.jpg 600w, https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2024/06/21164657/wayfinders-1200x800.jpg 1200w, https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2024/06/21164657/wayfinders-768x512.jpg 768w, https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2024/06/21164657/wayfinders-324x216.jpg 324w, https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2024/06/21164657/wayfinders-450x300.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 3585px) 100vw, 3585px"><figcaption>The battery is secured by eight 5IP Torx screws.</figcaption></figure>



<p>A special mention should be made of how most components are accessible without the need to remove additional layers. Need to replace the battery? No problem, it’s just a few screws and a bracket. What if you need to clean the fan? Easy. Just peel back the Surflink cable and undo three screws.</p>



<p>This might seem small to some but it shouldn’t be taken for granted. Take the MSI GS65, a laptop that had its fair share of fan failures. You have to remove <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Guide/MSI+GS65+Stealth+Thin+8RE+Fan++Assembly++Replacement/130584">the entire motherboard and thermal management system</a> just to replace a wonky fan!</p>



<h2>Surface Pro 11</h2>



<p>Thankfully the Surface Pro 11 also contained many of the same repairability improvements. A tablet PC will inherently be more difficult to repair when compared to a laptop, purely because the screen removal process can feel a bit hairy.</p>



<p>But if we consider it as its own distinct category of device—comparing it relative to other tablet-like devices and not laptops, which we do in our scoring process—the Surface Pro holds up well for repairability.</p>



<p>As with past generation Surface Pro’s, we have access to the M.2 drive via a small magnetic cover underneath the kickstand. Access to anything else requires some disassembly. With the screen off, we find QR codes and Wayfinder markers to aid in the disassembly process.</p>



<p>There are more layers of components, which is to be expected when you have half the space to work with. The Surflink cable and the thermal management system need to be removed before we can remove the battery. But all in all, the process isn’t too onerous, especially with manuals to hand.</p>

Not a drop of glue in sight.</figcaption></figure>



<p>A note on that Surflink cable, the two screws holding the port in place are non-magnetic. It’s such a small detail but it will be appreciated by anyone who’s ever had to reassemble a magnetic component while dealing with the frustration of having to hold a screw in place with tweezers to prevent it from flying towards the magnet right next to it.</p>



<p>Overall, we were extremely pleased with Microsoft’s continued commitment to repairability. The Surface line of devices have performed such a stunning and swift U-turn from unrepairable to very repairable that we can’t help but be impressed, even if they don’t score a perfect 10/10.</p>

<p>Speaking of which, after careful consideration and much lively debating, we decided to award both the Surface Laptop 7 and Surface Pro 11 an 8/10 for repairability in their respective device categories. </p>



<p>Microsoft’s journey from the unrepairable Surface Laptop to the highly repairable devices on our teardown table should drive home the importance of designing for repair. The ability to create a repairable Surface was always there but the impetus to design for repairable was missing. I’ll take that as a sign that Right to Repair advocacy and legislation has begun to bear fruit.&nbsp;</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>Jarun Laws lived in his car in a restaurant parking lot near downtown Denver. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/denver-guaranteed-basic-income-gbi-ubi-housing-security-homeless-rent-2024-2" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">He worked there as a cook</a><strong> </strong>until 2020, and had only $400 a month left after paying bills and child support. That was barely enough to cover his car payments and child support — and not even close to what he would need for rent.</p><p>The 51-year-old<strong> </strong>occasionally spent part of his paycheck on weekend stays at a cheap hotel, where he could spend time with his children. He struggled to afford food, clothes, and medicine — and he had been experiencing homelessness for nearly a decade.</p><div><p>That changed when Laws enrolled in <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/ubi-cash-payments-reduced-homelessness-increased-employment-denver-2023-10" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">The Denver Basic Income Project</a>. The pilot program allowed Laws to secure a temporary apartment with furniture, spend more time with his children, and find a better-paying job.</p><p>"I had questioned myself: if I was going to be a good father to my children because I was suffering," Laws previously told Business Insider. "When I got accepted, it changed my life."</p><p>Denver's basic income pilot — which first started payments in fall 2022 — focused on over 800 Coloradans experiencing homelessness, including people living in cars, temporary shelters, the outdoors, or other non-fixed living situations. Participants like Laws were given direct cash payments, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/which-states-cities-have-guaranteed-basic-income-programs-low-income-2024-4" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">no strings attached</a>, and could spend the money on whatever they needed.</p><p>Denver released the project's one-year report on<strong> </strong>June 18, showing that 45% of participants secured their own house or apartment after receiving basic income for 10 months. They also experienced fewer emergency room visits, nights spent in a hospital or a temporary shelter, and jail stays. The report estimates that this reduction in public service use saved the city $589,214.</p><p>Denver's program initially lasted one year and was <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/denver-basic-income-project-ubi-extended-homelessness-poverty-2024-1" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">extended in January for another six months</a>. Participants were sorted into random groups: one received $1,000 a month for a year; another got $6,500 upfront, followed by $500 a month; and a third got $50 a month as a control group.</p><p>The city of Denver, the Colorado Trust, and an anonymous foundation funded the project and has already provided more than $9.4 million to participants.</p><p>Basic income programs like Denver's have become <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/basic-income-gbi-ubi-low-income-americans-afford-housing-food-2024-5" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">a popular strategy to reduce poverty</a> in US cities. Compared to traditional social services like <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/buying-groceries-snap-food-stamps-cant-afford-essentials-credit-card-2024-6" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">SNAP</a> or Medicaid, basic income allows participants to spend the money where they need it most.</p><p>"What is fundamentally different about our approach is the way that we start from a place of trust," Mark Donovan, the project founder and executive director, said at a Tuesday press conference.</p><h2 id="1b74210a-b49a-428b-aa18-dbe9189f9abd" data-toc-id="1b74210a-b49a-428b-aa18-dbe9189f9abd"><strong>Denver's basic income project helped participants secure housing and jobs</strong></h2><p>Denver's report found that basic income primarily helped participants pay for immediate expenses — like transportation, hygiene, clothes, and groceries. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/chicago-basic-income-helped-mother-rent-an-apartment-ubi-gbi2024-5?mrfhud=true" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">Affording recurring bills like rent</a>, healthcare, or debt payments was also a top priority for most families. Participants in each payment group reported increased financial stability and reduced reliance on emergency financial assistance programs.</p><p>Basic income puts low-income families on "an equal playing field," Nick Pacheco, participant engagement coordinator, said at a press conference. He said the cash payments also help participants get the training and resources they need to establish careers.</p><p>Individuals who received the lump sum or $1,000 a month payments were more likely to find a stable, full-time job than before they received basic income.</p><p>"It's freedom," Pacheco said. "It's freedom from poverty and not being able to reach your goals."</p><p>Participating households also experienced improved mental health and could spend more time with family and friends.

She lived in public housing with her kids, all of whom have intellectual disabilities, though they were displaced shortly after.</p><p>She received monthly Social Security payments, just enough to care for her kids. While staying with a friend, she learned about the pilot program.</p><p>Rodriguez used the payments to fix her truck, transport her kids to school and work, buy new clothing, and secure a lifelong public housing voucher. She also used some of the money to pay $400 for rent, $500 on gas, $100 on hygiene, and $100 on her credit card bill. In addition to returning to school to get her GED, she brought her credit score into the 700s.</p><p>"The program gave me more time to focus on their education and their mental health," Rodriguez said, referring to her children, and added that the program's extension was another lifeline. "I had the space to get them tested and get them diagnosed and connected with the support they need."</p><p>Similarly, Dia Broncucia, 53, and Justin Searls, 45, could also afford essentials like an apartment, a new car, and mental health resources through basic income.

<p>17th June 2024</p>

<p>I gave a talk about accessing Large Language Models from the command-line last week as part of the <a href="https://maven.com/parlance-labs/fine-tuning">Mastering LLMs: A Conference For Developers &amp; Data Scientists</a> six week long online conference. The talk focused on my <a href="https://llm.datasette.io/">LLM</a> Python command-line utility and ways you can use it (and <a href="https://llm.datasette.io/en/stable/plugins/index.html">its plugins</a>) to explore LLMs and use them for useful tasks.</p>

<p>The talk was recorded and is available <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUXQNi6jQ30">on YouTube</a>. Here I’ve turned it into an <a href="https://simonwillison.net/tags/annotatedtalks/">annotated presentation</a>, with detailed notes and screenshots (there were no slides) to accompany the video.</p>

  <p><a href="https://llm.datasette.io/">LLM</a> is a tool I started building last year to help run LLM prompts directly from a command-line terminal. Instructions for installing it <a href="https://llm.datasette.io/en/stable/setup.html">are here</a>—you can use <code>pipx install llm</code> or <code>pip install llm</code> or <code>brew install llm</code>.</p>

  <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Jun/17/cli-language-models/#frame_000003.jpg">#</a></p><p>Once installed you can use it with OpenAI models by running <code>llm keys set openai</code> and pasting in your OpenAI key—or <a href="https://llm.datasette.io/en/stable/plugins/directory.html#plugin-directory">install plugins</a> to use models by other providers, including models you can run locally.</p>

  <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Jun/17/cli-language-models/#frame_000259.jpg">#</a></p><p>Basic usage is very simple: once you’ve configured your OpenAI key, you can run prompts against their models like this:</p>
<pre><code>llm 'five great names for a pet pelican'
</code></pre>
<p>The output will stream to your terminal, or you can redirect it to a file like this:</p>
<pre><code>llm 'five great names for a pet pelican' &gt; pelicans.txt

Certainly! Here's why each name suits a pet walrus: 1. **Whiskers** - **Justification:** Walruses have distinctive, prominent whiskers (vibrissae) that the y use to detect food on the ocean floor. This name highlights one of their most characteristic features. 2. **Tusk** - **Justification:** Walruses are known for their long, formidable tusks, which they use for various purposes"></a>
  <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Jun/17/cli-language-models/#frame_000341.jpg">#</a></p><p>You can use the <code>-c</code> (for continue) option to send follow-up prompts as part of the same ongoing conversation:</p>

<p>I really like these models. Claude 3 Opus is about equivalent to GPT-4o in terms of quality. Claude 3 Haiku is both cheaper and better than GPT-3.5, and can handle 100,000 input tokens including images.</p>

One of my favourite is with the <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm-gpt4all">llm-gpt4all</a> plugin, which builds on top of the excellent <a href="https://gpt4all.io/index.html">GPT4All</a> Python library by Nomic AI.</p>

It also evokes images of a playful and adventuro us bird that loves to explore the world around her. 2. &quot;Captain Jack&quot; - For any seafaring seagull who loves adventure and exploration, this name is perfect. Captain Jack suggests a sense of independence and leadership, which could be fitt ing for a bird who enjoys flying high and exploring new places. 3. &quot;Scarlett&quot; - This name is bold and eye-catching, much like the vibrant feathers of a seagull. Scarlett also has a fiery energy that could reflect the spirit of your adventurous pet. 4. &quot;Nautica&quot; - Nautica means &quot;sailor&quot; in Latin, making it an excellent choice for a seagull  Activity Monitor is also visible, showing a Python process using 350MB of RAM."></a>
  <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Jun/17/cli-language-models/#frame_001450.jpg">#</a></p><p>To install that plugin:</p>
<pre><code>llm install llm-gpt4all
</code></pre>
<p>Then <code>llm models</code> to list the new models. Each model will be downloaded the first time you try running a prompt through it.</p>
<p>I used this to run Mistral-7B Instruct—an extremely high quality small (~4GB) model:</p>
<pre><code>llm -m mistral-7b-instruct-v0 'five great names for a pet seagull, with explanations'
</code></pre>
<p>You can run Activity Monitory to see the resources the model is using.</p>

<p>Instead, you can use the <code>llm chat</code> command which keeps the model in memory across multiple prompts:</p>
<pre><code>llm chat -m mistral-7b-instruct-v0
</code></pre>
<p>Another option is to run <a href="https://ollama.com/">Ollama</a>, which runs its own local server hosting models. The <a href="https://github.com/taketwo/llm-ollama">llm-ollama</a> plugin can then be used to run prompts through Ollama from LLM.</p>

The <code>--store</code> link means it will store a copy of the text in the database as well—without that it would just store identifiers and we would need to use those to look up the text later on when running queries.</p>

<p>I wrote a bit about this a few years ago in <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2022/Nov/26/productivity/">Coping strategies for the serial project hoarder</a>—how I use extensive documentation and unit tests to allow me to work on way more projects at once by ensuring I don’t have to remember the details of any of them.</p>
<p>My other trick is that I tend to pick projects that fit my unique combination of previous experiences. I built LLM because I already had experience with LLM APIs, Python CLI tools (using <a href="https://click.palletsprojects.com/">Click</a>) and plugin systems (using <a href="https://pluggy.readthedocs.io/">Pluggy</a>). As a result I happened to be one of the best positioned people in the world to build a plugin-based CLI tool for working with LLMs!</p>

<p>Here’s how I turned the YouTube video of this talk into an annotated presentation:</p>
<ol>
<li>I downloaded a <code>.mp4</code> version of the talk from YouTube using <a href="https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp">yt-dlp</a>.</li>
<li>I ran that through <a href="https://goodsnooze.gumroad.com/l/macwhisper">MacWhisper</a> to create my own transcript for copying extracts from into my write-up—although this time I didn’t end up using any of the transcript text.</li>
<li>I played the video (at 2x speed) in QuickTime Player and used the <code>capture.sh</code> script <a href="https://til.simonwillison.net/macos/quicktime-capture-script">described here</a> to grab screenshots of the individual interesting frames that I wanted to use for my post.</li>
<li>I loaded those screenshots into <a href="https://til.simonwillison.net/tools/annotated-presentations">my annotated presentation tool</a> (which I <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2023/Aug/6/annotated-presentations/">described in this post</a>) and used that to run OCR against them for alt text and to add commentary to accompany each screenshot.</li>
<li>I assembled the result into this finished blog entry, adding intro text and the YouTube embed as HTML.</li>

    <p>April 14, 2024</p>
        <p>
            iDOS 3 waiting for review (rejected)    </p>
        <article>
  <p>Earlier quite a few iDOS users and supporters reached out to me to let me know about the recent AppStore policy change (Thanks, EU).
    In light of this, I decided to resubmit iDOS.    

    However, it looks like Apple has blacklisted iDOS 2, preventing me from even requesting
    a review under that title, and I had to submit under a brand new title "iDOS 3".


  </p>
  
  <p>    Here's where things got interesting.
    Initially they rejected the submission because it was same as iDOS 2, but after I explained to them that I can not continue under iDOS2,
then they rejected again as "Design spam" on the basis that there has been many submissions lately with the exact same design.
    </p>
      <p>I don't actually care much about the copycats, but just can't understand why it's difficult for Apple to check my account history and tell which is the original. It's a little bit insulting that I had to tell the story to them time and time again and yet the issue is unresolved after 1 week.
      </p>
        <p>For the people that are waiting, I am hopeful that we will sort it out eventually. And if everything indeed goes well, there will be updates coming to justify this version bump.
        </p>

	<p> <em>Update 2024-05-08</em>: "Your app is in review but is requiring additional time." Makes me wonder if the reviewer is trying to play a game through.
	</p><p id="nope"> <em>Update 2024-06-15</em>: Got a call from Apple after 2 months. They have decided that iDOS is not a retro game console, so the new rule is not applicable. They suggested I make changes and resubmit for review, but when I asked what changes I should make to be compliant, they had no idea, nor when I asked what a retro game console is. It's still the same old unreasonable answer along the line of "we know it when we see it".

A hearing on the issue of Assange's free speech rights had been <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/wikileaks-assange-extradition-appeal-heard-month-rcna156499" target="_blank">scheduled</a> for July 9-10.</p><p>Assange's WikiLeaks also <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/wikileaks-julian-assange-no-proof-hacked-dnc-emails-came-russia-n616541" target="_blank">published</a> hacked emails from the Democratic National Committee that upended the 2016 presidential race.

At a joint news conference with then-President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin days later, Trump contradicted the indictment and the intelligence community, saying that Putin was "<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/trump-putin-questions-abound-ahead-helsinki-meeting-n891606" target="_blank">extremely strong and powerful in his denial</a>" that Russians interfered in the 2016 election to help him win.</p><p>Manning was sentenced to 35 years in a military prison, but <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/president-obama-commutes-chelsea-manning-s-sentence-n708046" target="_blank">her sentence was commuted by Obama</a> in the final days of his presidency in 2017.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>
	More than two decades’ worth of content published on MTVNews.com is no longer available after MTV appears to have fully pulled down the site and its related content. Content on its sister site, CMT.com, seems to have met a similiar fate. </p>



<p>
	In 2023, <a href="https://variety.com/2023/tv/news/mtv-news-shuts-down-paramount-layoffs-showtime-networks-1235607638/">MTV News was shuttered amid the financial woes</a> of parent company <a href="https://variety.com/t/paramount-global/" id="auto-tag_paramount-global" data-tag="paramount-global">Paramount Global</a>. As of Monday, trying to access <a href="https://variety.com/t/mtv-news/" id="auto-tag_mtv-news" data-tag="mtv-news">MTV News</a> articles on mtvnews.com or mtv.com/news resulted in visitors being redirected to the main MTV website.</p>



<p>
	The now-unavailable content includes decades of music journalism comprising thousands of articles and interviews with countless major artists, dating back to the site’s launch in 1996. Perhaps the most significant loss is MTV News’ vast hip-hop-related archives, particularly its weekly “Mixtape Monday” column, which ran for nearly a decade in the 2000s and 2010s and featured interviews, reviews and more with many artists, producers and others early in their careers.  

	</p>






<p>
	Former MTV News staffers posted on social media about the website shutdown and the scrubbing of the archives. “So, mtvnews.com no longer exists. Eight years of my life are gone without a trace,” Patrick Hosken, former music editor for MTV News, <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href="https://x.com/patrickhosken/status/1805327863882956850" target="_blank">wrote</a> on X. “All because it didn’t fit some executives’ bottom lines. Infuriating is too small a word.”

<p>
	“sickening (derogatory) to see the entire @mtvnews archive wiped from the internet,” Crystal Bell, culture editor at Mashable and one-time entertainment director&nbsp;of MTV News, <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href="https://x.com/crystalbell/status/1805338895401599275" target="_blank">posted</a> on X. “decades of music history gone…including some very early k-pop stories.”</p>



<p>
	“This is disgraceful. They’ve completely wiped the MTV News archive,” longtime Rolling Stone senior writer Brian Hiatt <a href="https://x.com/hiattb/status/1805336821569896551" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">commented</a>. “Decades of pop culture history research material gone, and why?”</p>



<p>
	Last week, Paramount Global’s CMT website similarly pulled its repository of country-music journalism dating back several decades.</p>



<p>
	Reps for MTV did not respond to requests for comment Monday.</p>



<p>
	Some observers noted that MTV News articles may be available through internet archiving services like the <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href="https://wayback-api.archive.org/" target="_blank">Wayback Machine</a>, but according to Hiatt older MTV News articles do not show up via Wayback Machine.</p>



<p>
	In May 2023, Paramount Global shut down MTV News — which had already been severely downsized by layoffs in recent years — coming amid a <a href="https://variety.com/2023/tv/news/mtv-news-shuts-down-paramount-layoffs-showtime-networks-1235607638/">25% reduction in workforce</a> across the Showtime/MTV Entertainment Studios and Paramount Media Networks groups in the U.S. The group is headed by president-CEO Chris McCarthy, who in late April was named one of <a href="https://variety.com/2024/biz/news/paramount-ceos-skydance-deal-end-standalone-strategic-plan-1236035440/">the three co-CEOs running Paramount Global’s “Office of the CEO.”</a>

	</p>




<p>
	MTV News began in the late ’80s with “The Week in Rock,” a show hosted by Kurt Loder, who was the first MTV News correspondent.</p>

<p>Bill Atkinson worked mostly at home, but whenever he made significant progress he rushed in to Apple to show it off to anyone who would appreciate it.   This time, he visited the Macintosh offices at Texaco Towers to show off his brand new oval routines, which were implemented using a really clever algorithm.</p><p>

	Bill had added new code to QuickDraw (which was still called LisaGraf at this point) to draw circles and ovals very quickly.  That was a bit hard to do on the Macintosh, since the math for circles usually involved taking square roots, and the 68000 processor in the Lisa and Macintosh didn't support floating point operations.  But Bill had come up with a clever way to do the circle calculation that only used addition and subtraction, not even multiplication or division, which the 68000 could do, but was kind of slow at.</p><p>

	Bill's technique used the fact the sum of a sequence of odd numbers is always the next perfect square (For example, 1 + 3 = 4, 1 + 3 + 5 = 9, 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 = 16, etc).  So he could figure out when to bump the dependent coordinate value by iterating in a loop until a threshold was exceeded.  This allowed QuickDraw to draw ovals very quickly.</p><p>

	Bill fired up his demo and it quickly filled the Lisa screen with randomly-sized ovals, faster than you thought was possible.  But something was bothering Steve Jobs.  "Well, circles and ovals are good, but how about drawing rectangles with rounded corners?  Can we do that now, too?"</p><p>

	"No, there's no way to do that.  In fact it would be really hard to do, and I don't think we really need it".  I think Bill was a little miffed that Steve wasn't raving over the fast ovals and still wanted more.</p><p>

	Steve suddenly got more intense.  "Rectangles with rounded corners are everywhere! Just look around this room!". And sure enough, there were lots of them, like the whiteboard and some of the desks and tables.  Then he pointed out the window.  "And look outside, there's even more, practically everywhere you look!".  He even persuaded Bill to take a quick walk around the block with him, pointing out every rectangle with rounded corners that he could find.</p><p>

        When Steve and Bill passed a no-parking sign with rounded corners, it did the trick.  "OK, I give up", Bill pleaded.  "I'll see if it's as hard as I thought."  He went back home to work on it.</p><p>

        Bill returned to Texaco Towers the following afternoon, with a big smile on his face.  His demo was now drawing rectangles with beautifully rounded corners blisteringly fast, almost at the speed of plain rectangles.  When he added the code to LisaGraf, he named the new primitive "RoundRects".   Over the next few months, roundrects worked their way into various parts of the user interface, and soon became indispensable.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
                                                                        <p><img alt="The Microsoft OneDrive Logo" src="https://cdn.neowin.com/news/images/uploaded/2022/03/1648728320_onedrive_logo_story.jpg"></p>

<p>Microsoft has made OneDrive slightly more annoying for Windows 11 users. Quietly and without any announcement, the company changed Windows 11's initial setup so that it could turn on the automatic folder backup without asking for it.</p>

<p>Now, those setting up a new Windows computer <a href="https://www.neowin.net/news/microsoft-apparently-hates-it-when-you-switch-from-microsoft-account-to-local-account/">the way Microsoft wants them to</a> (in other words, connected to the internet and signed into a Microsoft account) will get to their desktops with OneDrive already syncing stuff from folders like Desktop Pictures, Documents, Music, and Videos. Depending on how much is stored there, you might end up with a desktop and other folders filled to the brim with shortcuts to various stuff right after finishing a clean Windows installation.</p>

<p><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/back-up-your-folders-with-onedrive-d61a7930-a6fb-4b95-b28a-6552e77c3057">Automatic folder backup in OneDrive</a> is a very useful feature when used properly and when the user deliberately enables it. However, Microsoft decided that sending a few notification prompts to enable folder backup was not enough, so it just turned the feature on without asking anybody or even letting users know about it, resulting in a flood of Reddit posts about users complaining about what the hell are those green checkmarks next to files and shortcuts on their desktops.</p>

                            <!-- PLACE THIS SECTION INSIDE OF YOUR BODY WHERE YOU WANT THE VIDEO PLAYER TO RENDER -->
            <p>If you do not want your computer to back up everything on your desktop or other folders, here is how to turn the feature off (you can also set up Windows 11 in offline mode):</p>

<ol>
<li>Right-click the OneDrive icon in the tray area, click the settings icon and then press Settings.</li>
	<li>Go to the "Sync and Backup" tab and click "Manage backup."</li>
	<li>Turn off all the folders you do not want to back up in OneDrive and confirm the changes.</li>
	<li>If you have an older OneDrive version with the classic tabbed interface, go to the Backup tab and click Manage Backup &gt; Stop backup &gt; Stop backup.</li>
</ol>
<p>Microsoft is no stranger to shady tricks with its software and operating system. Several months ago, we noticed that <a href="https://www.neowin.net/news/microsoft-wont-let-you-close-onedrive-in-windows-without-you-explaining-it-first/">OneDrive would not let you close it</a> without you explaining the reason first (<a href="https://www.neowin.net/news/microsoft-backtracks-no-longer-asks-to-explain-closing-onedrive-on-windows-10-and-11/">Microsoft later reverted that stupid change</a>). A similar thing <a href="https://www.neowin.net/news/microsoft-now-wants-you-to-take-a-poll-before-installing-google-chrome/">was also spotted in the Edge browser</a>, with Microsoft asking users why they downloaded Chrome.</p>

<p>As a reminder, you can always just uninstall OneDrive and call it a day.</p>
                        
                        
                                                                    </div></div>]]></description>

<p><span>During Flannery O’Connor’s</span> childhood, the future author had a creative way of weeding out any unsatisfactory playmates who had been chosen by her mother as respectable society. O’Connor would read <em>Grimms’ Fairy Tales</em> aloud to her guests. Some were too frightened by the stories to ever return to the O’Connor house in Savannah (which suited their hostess just fine). Any girl who loved the fairy tales passed young O’Connor’s&nbsp;test. A kindred spirit had been found.</p>
<p>Classic fairy tales aren’t for the faint of heart. It’s not hard to see their influence on O’Connor’s disturbing and shocking southern gothic fiction that includes such horrors as serial killers waiting by the side of rural roads, ready to murder selfish grandmothers. The stories compiled by Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm include their fair share of violence and twisted crimes: men who chop young women up into pieces, a father who lusts after his own daughter, and many, many characters who make deals with the devil himself. Today children are often only familiar with sanitized versions of the Grimm Brothers’ stories.</p>

<p>Hans Christian Andersen’s classic fairy tales have also been adjusted over the years for a more sensitive audience. When I found his version of “The Little Mermaid”<em> </em>at the library as a young girl, I was surprised but fascinated by the stark differences from the Disney film. The prince in Andersen’s<em> </em>“The Little Mermaid” marries someone else. And the mermaid’s bargain with the sea-witch results in a desperate choice: die when the sun rises after his wedding night or murder her beloved in his bridal chamber. While there are moments of suspense and danger in Disney’s <em>The Little Mermaid</em>, it’s hard to imagine bubbly Ariel with her bouncing red bangs and a knife in hand, trying to decide whether to fatally stab lovable himbo Prince Eric. Such a dark scene, although not uncommon in the realm of classic fairy tales, would have been considered too distressing for young viewers. In an effort to make the story more palatable, Disney’s <em>Cinderella </em>does not include the details of Cinderella’s stepsisters chopping off their heels and toes to fit their bloody, mutilated feet into the glass slipper in greedy pursuit of the throne or getting their eyes pecked out by birds in a final stroke of justice, as the Grimms’ version describes. But is this Disneyfication of these tales a good or a bad thing?</p>
<p>Fairy tales are stories that are told to children and set in a world of magic. As twentieth-century educator <a href="https://www.plough.com/en/authors/a/annemarie-waechter-arnold">Annemarie Wächter</a>&nbsp;put it, “Children and fairy tales are inseparable – one cannot be imagined without the other.” Fairy tales are beloved by children partly because they are tales of <em>action</em>. Rather than revolving around the inner thoughts and motivations of nuanced characters, they are concerned with <em>what happens next</em>, what the characters (often archetypes) <em>do</em>. They are more than mere fables with a snappy moral (think Aesop) because their meaning transcends clearcut lessons. Instead, they are full of mystery. There is room inside these tales for the child to explore fairyland: a strange and dangerous world in which she can practice overcoming her fears by journeying alongside the hero. And at the end of the tale, everything is set right. As Wächter puts it, “Fairy tales can often be brutal and cruel – people and animals die – and yet, despite everything, the positive powers always win. There can be no other ending.”</p>
<p>Fairy tales take both evil and goodness quite seriously. In other words, they are truthful. As Madeleine L’Engle claimed, “The world of fairy tale, fantasy, myth, is inimical to the secular world, and in total opposition to it, for it is interested not in limited laboratory proofs, but in truth.” And in their embrace of truth, fairy tales wrestle with darkness and end in triumph. But are we willing to tell children the truth by reading them fairy tales, as Flannery O’Connor did to her playmates? It seems that these days we are more comfortable if we alter them either by&nbsp; softening the darkness in the story or, as we see in much young adult literature, rejecting the possibility of happily ever after.</p>
<p><span>Disney’s <em>Cinderella </em>does not include the details of Cinderella’s stepsisters chopping off their heels and toes to fit their bloody, mutilated feet into the glass slipper in greedy pursuit of the throne or getting their eyes pecked out by birds in a final stroke of justice, as the Grimms’ version describes. But is this Disneyfication of these tales a good or a bad thing?</span></p>
<p>While protecting the innocence of children by sheltering them from overly gruesome material is something all good parents seek to do, have we swung so far in our attempt to protect children that we don’t tell stories that help them process dark things? While we haven’t always been so leery of the violence in fairy tales, in this strange age we subject our children to drills at their schools to prepare them for active shooters in the classroom but consider them too fragile to be told stories that take evil and death seriously. Is this sheltering from the classic grit of fairy tales benefiting them, or are these just the sort of stories they need to be able to endure the violence that hangs like a shadow over our world?</p>
<p>The fairy tale acknowledges that parents do not always love and care for their children as they ought, that loved ones die and leave us alone and grieving, that evil is real and often powerful, and that violence and sin are present in our world. All these truths make grownups uncomfortable; we are eager to smooth over a child’s fears with comforting falsehoods. “Don’t worry, nothing is going to happen to me,” a mother might say when her child is distraught at the thought of her mortality. But the child knows that sometimes mothers die and his mother is no different. Children are wise enough to be afraid of death, loss, and danger – after all, these are frightening things. The question is whether we allow them to wrestle well with these fears or not. British writer G. K. Chesterton famously wrote, “The baby has known the dragon intimately ever since he had an imagination. What the fairy tale provides for him is a Saint George to kill the dragon.” If we spend our efforts trying to convince a child that the dragons of life can’t hurt him, we not only fail to tell the truth, we fail to show him that dragons do not have the last word. And the child longs to be equipped to face the monsters he fears, whether dragons or death.</p>
<p><span>While classic fairy tales</span> are maligned by some for being too realistic and unsettling in acknowledging the reality of evil, they are also criticized for being too<em> un</em>realistic for their final hopeful resolutions. “I won’t read my daughter fairy tales!” I’ve been told by concerned parents. “She might think Prince Charming is coming to save her and she’ll only be disappointed when she wakes up to the <em>real world</em>.” These critics are willing to leave the dragon in the story but want to remove Saint&nbsp;George. The endings of classic fairy tales are considered too rosy for a child’s consumption. Perhaps robbing young children of the world of fairyland where they can face the monsters they fear results in an inevitable overcorrection, as the explosion of dystopian YA fiction might suggest. Many such books see the world through a lens of despair, defeat, and mistrust, overrun with dragons with no Saint&nbsp;George in sight. A belief that despair is the only realistic response to the nature of the world leads to narratives like <em>Game of Thrones,</em> which presents a universe where there is neither good nor evil, just the unquenchable thirst for power that motivates every soul.</p>
<p>Even in stories for younger kids – A Series of Unfortunate Events, for example – we see the fairy tale turned on its head. In this series the orphaned Baudelaire children are never given the happily ever after they deserve. In <em>Grimms’ Fairy Tales</em> the heroes or heroines sometimes encounter helpers along the way, or they might meet manipulators or liars. In this they are realistic. And there is the understanding that the world is not merely dark; both good and evil people inhabit it, but there are some worth trusting. But the Baudelaires can trust no one. The adults they encounter are either too weak to help them or are secretly trying to harm them. Another trend of subverted fairy tale is the apologia for a villain, such as Disney’s <em>Maleficent, </em>in which the evil sorceress becomes the sympathetic victim. In these stories both evil <em>and</em> goodness are removed from the tale. The villain’s evil is explained away, the hero’s goodness revealed to be a farce. And yet, while these kinds of stories are undeniably popular, it is notable that the series that has recently captured the imagination of children (and even adults) most deeply is a modern fairy tale that includes both wrestling with evil and death and a happily ever after: J. K. Rowling’s Harry Potter<em>, </em>a story, like <em>Grimms’ Fairy Tales</em>, with an indisputably Christian framework.</p>
<p><span>Every human being</span> understands the world and his place in it through narratives. God wires us to be formed by story; Jesus himself tells parables to teach his disciples. It is of the highest importance that we consider what stories we are telling our young people. What character do they think they are in the story of their lives? And what kind of world is their story set in? Is it a world in which greed and power will be ultimately triumphant? Is it a world in which love and goodness hold any sway? Could the dread that seems to plague our young people be not merely a reaction to the brokenness of our world but our failure to communicate that the universe will ultimately be set right as both fairy tales and the gospel promise? After all, as the theologian Vigen Guroian beautifully puts it in his fantastic book <em><a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://bookshop.org/a/78/9780195384314" target="_blank">Tending the Heart of Virtue</a></em>, “Fairy tales lead us toward a belief in something that, if it were not also so veiled in a mystery, common sense alone would affirm: if there is a story, there must surely be a storyteller.” And in this lies our deepest hope.</p>
<p><spa>The fairy tale acknowledges that parents do not always love and care for their children as they ought, that loved ones die and leave us alone and grieving, that evil is real and often powerful, and that violence and sin are present in our world. All these truths make grownups uncomfortable; we are eager to smooth over a child’s fears with comforting falsehoods.</spa></p>
<p>To combat both the anxiety that comes to children robbed of the space to confront evil and the despair that holds that the last chapter of humanity’s tale is final defeat, we have to offer truer stories. Early in life, children need to be steeped in fairy tales that don’t gloss over the dark and ugly parts of the world. Children are wise; they reject the false advertising of cheap positive thinking for the real prize of hard-won hope. For a message of hope to be received, it must be hope that shines in darkness, hope that breaks the witch’s spell. “It is the mark of a good fairy-story,” J. R. R. Tolkien writes in his essay “On Fairy-Stories,” “that however wild its events, however fantastic or terrible the adventures, it can give to child or man that hears it, when the ‘turn’ comes, a catch of the breath, a beat and lifting of the heart, near to (or indeed accompanied by) tears.” But to tell such stories, we have to believe they are true. If we grown-ups don’t believe there is, as Tolkien calls it, “joy beyond the walls of the world,” then our children will not believe us when we share fairy tales that end with hope. And if we offer narratives of a world without hope, our stories are no better than the sanitized tales that refuse to acknowledge mortality and evil. They are simply a different way of failing to tell the whole truth.</p>
<p>But happily ever afters may be difficult to envision without an eternal perspective. At the end of Andersen’s story, the little mermaid loses her life and her body disintegrates into sea foam on the surface of the waves. But her sacrifice for her beloved is rewarded by the chance to gain a human soul and therefore to experience eternal life. This ending is only hopeful accompanied by a belief in an afterlife, just as Flannery O’Connor’s “A Good Man Is Hard to Find” only ends “happily” with a salvific outpouring of grace if we see eternal hope for the murdered grandmother. Perhaps it’s the loss of this eternal perspective that prevents us from seeing beyond darkness to hope.</p>
<p>“Deprive children of stories,” warns philosopher Alasdair MacIntyre, “and you leave them unscripted, anxious stutterers in their actions as in their words.” Like Hansel and Gretel leaving their little white pebbles along their path into the dark forest, the next generation needs us to provide them with touchstones that can keep them from getting lost on their journey and help them find their way back home. These pathfinders are the stories they’re told, stories that light up the dark, that reveal the existence of dragons hiding in the caves of life, and remind us that Saint George will be ultimately triumphant, even when it seems all hope is lost.</p>

<ul dir="auto">
<li>Flatten all <code>use</code> statements</li>
<li>Run <code>cargo +stable clippy</code> and ensure that all lints and suggestions have been addressed before committing</li>
<li>Run <code>cargo +nightly fmt --all</code> to ensure consistent formatting before committing</li>
<li>Use <code>git cz</code> with
the <a href="https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli#conventional-commit-messages-as-a-global-utility">Commitizen CLI</a> to prepare
commit messages</li>
<li>Provide <strong>at least</strong> one short sentence or paragraph in your commit message body to describe your thought process for the

<p dir="auto">It is very difficult to review pull requests which touch multiple unrelated features and parts of the codebase.</p>
<p dir="auto">Please do not submit pull requests like this; you will be asked to separate them into smaller PRs that deal only with
one feature or bug fix at a time.</p>
<p dir="auto">If you are working on multiple features and bug fixes, I suggest that you cut a branch called <code>local-trunk</code>
from <code>master</code> which you keep up to date, and rebase the various independent branches you are working on onto that branch
if you want to test them together or create a build with everything integrated.</p>

<p dir="auto"><code>komorebi</code> is a mature codebase with an internal consistency and structure that has developed organically over close to
half a decade.</p>
<p dir="auto">There are <a href="https://youtube.com/@LGUG2Z" rel="nofollow">countless hours of live coding videos</a> demonstrating work on this project and
showing new contributors how to do everything from basic tasks like implementing new <code>komorebic</code> commands to
distinguishing monitors by manufacturer hardware identifiers and video card ports.</p>
<p dir="auto">Refactors to the structure of the codebase are not taken lightly and require prior discussion and approval.</p>
<p dir="auto">Please do not start refactoring the codebase with the expectation of having your changes integrated until you receive an
explicit approval or a request to do so.</p>
<p dir="auto">Similarly, when implementing features and bug fixes, please stick to the structure of the codebase as much as possible
and do not take this as an opportunity to do some "refactoring along the way".</p>
<p dir="auto">It is extremely difficult to review PRs for features and bug fixes if they are lost in sweeping changes to the structure
of the codebase.</p>

<p dir="auto">No user should ever find that their configuration file has stopped working after upgrading to a new version
of <code>komorebi</code>.</p>
<p dir="auto">More often than not there are ways to reformulate changes that may initially seem like they require breaking user-facing

at <a href="https://github.com/LGUG2Z/komorebi/commit/e7d928a065eb63bb4ea1fb864c69c1cae8cc763b">this commit</a> which added the
ability for users to specify colours in <code>komorebi.json</code> in Hex format alongside RGB.</p>
<p dir="auto">There is also a process in place for graceful, non-breaking, deprecation of configuration options that are no longer
required.</p>

<p dir="auto">Logs from <code>komorebi</code> will be appended to <code>%LOCALAPPDATA%/komorebi/komorebi.log</code>; this file is never rotated or overwritten, so it will keep
growing until it is deleted by the user.</p>
<p dir="auto">Whenever running the <code>komorebic stop</code> command or sending a Ctrl-C signal to <code>komorebi</code> directly, the <code>komorebi</code> process
ensures that all hidden windows are restored before termination.</p>
<p dir="auto">If however, you ever end up with windows that are hidden and cannot be restored, a list of window handles known
to <code>komorebi</code> are stored and continuously updated in <code>%LOCALAPPDATA%/komorebi//komorebi.hwnd.json</code>.</p>

<p dir="auto">If <code>komorebi</code> ever stops responding, it is most likely either due to either a panic or a deadlock. In the case of a
panic, this will be reported in the log. In the case of a deadlock, there will not be any errors in the log, but the
process and the log will appear frozen.</p>
<p dir="auto">If you believe you have encountered a deadlock, you can compile <code>komorebi</code> with <code>--features deadlock_detection</code> and try
reproducing the deadlock again. This will check for deadlocks every 5 seconds in the background, and if a deadlock is
found, information about it will appear in the log which can be shared when opening an issue.</p>

<p dir="auto">The current state of the window manager can be queried using the <code>komorebic state</code> command, which returns a JSON

<p dir="auto">UDS are also the only mode of communication between <code>komorebi</code> and <code>komorebic</code>.</p>
<p dir="auto">First, your application must create a socket in <code>$ENV:LocalAppData\komorebi</code>. Once the socket has been created, run the

I learned that it was written by someone named Bette Santini. It has a two and a half star rating, is 33 pages long and was published on May 7, 2024. For just $2.99, it could be mine. The brief bio read: A little girl with blue eyes and blonde hair leads her friends on a healthy eating mission, culminating in the creation of a neighborhood farmer’s market.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Okay. Sort of </span><em>Triumph of the Will: Bedtime Story for Kids and Adults</em><span>.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>What else could this sick and twisted mind have cooked up? I wanted more. I clicked on Bette’s author page; this was the only title listed. Through the penumbral fog of half-sleep, squinting one-eyed at my phone, I googled, “a girls.quest for healthy watinf bette santinir.” Even the politely auto-corrected version yielded no meaningful results: An obituary for a Betty L. Santini. A vintage Santini cycling jacket on eBay. An Amazon link to the book, </span><em>The Prince of Tides</em><span>. Not only would it seem that Bette Santini does not exist, but there is no possible way to purchase or even locate </span><em>A Girl’s Quest for Healthy Eating</em><span>, outside the Kindle app.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>And then things got spooky. When I opened my Kindle again, there, illuminated by the inoffensive whitish glow of my device, was an ad for </span><em>A Girl’s Quest for Healthy Eating</em><span>. Only, it was vaguely distorted. Like a spot-the-difference </span><em>Highlights</em><span> game, here was the same book with minor discrepancies. This cover featured several little girls, presumably all on healthy eating quests of their own. The page count was slightly different. And most distressing of all, the author's name: Bette Santini</span><em>r</em><span>. In other words, Santini plus R. Where had I seen this name before? Oh right: from one minute ago when I misspelled Santini, Santinir.&nbsp;</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0febaa32-bf23-407b-99a2-2f6f98a9f5b5_990x1308.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0febaa32-bf23-407b-99a2-2f6f98a9f5b5_990x1308.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0febaa32-bf23-407b-99a2-2f6f98a9f5b5_990x1308.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0febaa32-bf23-407b-99a2-2f6f98a9f5b5_990x1308.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0febaa32-bf23-407b-99a2-2f6f98a9f5b5_990x1308.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0febaa32-bf23-407b-99a2-2f6f98a9f5b5_990x1308.png" width="486" height="642.1090909090909" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/0febaa32-bf23-407b-99a2-2f6f98a9f5b5_990x1308.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1308,&quot;width&quot;:990,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:486,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0febaa32-bf23-407b-99a2-2f6f98a9f5b5_990x1308.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0febaa32-bf23-407b-99a2-2f6f98a9f5b5_990x1308.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0febaa32-bf23-407b-99a2-2f6f98a9f5b5_990x1308.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0febaa32-bf23-407b-99a2-2f6f98a9f5b5_990x1308.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p><span>So.

Such as helping Ethan, some random dumbass at school who is struggling with his grades. By having access to his thoughts, Olivia is able to identify what exactly he’s struggling with, which “made tutoring sessions more productive.” The next day, the robot Lynnell Gorshteyny has forgotten that the main character is named Olivia. “Next, they helped their classmate, Olivia, who was dealing with a fallout with her best friend. Olivia could perceive both sides of the argument.”&nbsp;</p><p>Whatever. You get the point. The book goes on and on, reminding us over and over of the power of empathy: that we must empathize with each other, that we must be empathetic towards each other, and how “most importantly, Olivia is an empath now.” In fact, the word empathy is mentioned 10 times in 35 pages. Every time I thought I had reached the book’s natural conclusion – “Her powers were gone, but she was also glad for the silence.” Big sigh. We’ve done it. – I would turn the page only to learn once again that “Olivia’s journey as a mind reader taught her valuable lessons.”&nbsp;</p><p>But what about the valuable lessons I’ve learned? Well, as of this morning, I’ve started receiving ads for a different genre of AI reads.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
	
	<article>
		<p>When we look at the general security posture of Let’s Encrypt, one of the things that worries us most is how much of the operating system and network infrastructure is written in unsafe languages like C and C++. The <a href="https://github.com/letsencrypt/boulder">CA software</a> itself is written in memory safe Golang, but from our server operating systems to our network equipment, lack of memory safety routinely leads to vulnerabilities that need patching.</p>
<p>Partially for the sake of Let’s Encrypt, and partially for the sake of the wider Internet, we started a new project called <a href="https://www.memorysafety.org/">Prossimo</a> in 2020. Prossimo’s goal is to make some of the most critical software infrastructure for the Internet memory safe. Since then we’ve invested in a range of software components including the <a href="https://github.com/rustls/rustls/">Rustls TLS library</a>, <a href="https://github.com/hickory-dns/hickory-dns">Hickory DNS</a>, <a href="https://github.com/memorysafety/river">River reverse proxy</a>, <a href="https://github.com/memorysafety/sudo-rs">sudo-rs</a>, <a href="https://rust-for-linux.com/">Rust support for the Linux kernel</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/pendulum-project/ntpd-rs">ntpd-rs</a>.</p>
<p>Let’s Encrypt has now taken a step that was a long time in the making: we’ve deployed <a href="https://github.com/pendulum-project/ntpd-rs">ntpd-rs</a>, the first piece of memory safe software from Prossimo that has made it into the Let’s Encrypt infrastructure.</p>
<p>Most operating systems use the Network Time Protocol (NTP) to accurately determine what time it is. Keeping track of time is a critical task for an operating system, and since it involves interacting with the Internet it’s important to make sure NTP implementations are secure.</p>
<p>In April of 2022, Prossimo started work on a memory safe and generally more secure <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_Time_Protocol">NTP</a> implementation called <a href="https://github.com/pendulum-project/ntpd-rs">ntpd-rs</a>. Since then, the implementation has matured and is now maintained by <a href="https://github.com/pendulum-project">Project Pendulum</a>. In April of 2024 ntpd-rs was deployed to the Let’s Encrypt staging environment, and as of now it’s in production.</p>
<p>Over the next few years we plan to continue replacing C or C++ software with memory safe alternatives in the Let’s Encrypt infrastructure: OpenSSL and its derivatives with <a href="https://www.memorysafety.org/initiative/rustls/">Rustls</a>, our DNS software with <a href="https://www.memorysafety.org/initiative/dns/">Hickory</a>, Nginx with <a href="https://www.memorysafety.org/initiative/reverse-proxy/">River</a>, and sudo with <a href="https://www.memorysafety.org/initiative/sudo-su/">sudo-rs</a>. Memory safety is just part of the overall security equation, but <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/oncd/briefing-room/2024/02/26/press-release-technical-report/">it’s an important part</a> and we’re glad to be able to make these improvements.</p>
<p>We depend on contributions from our community of users and supporters in order to provide our services. If your company or organization would like to <a href="https://www.abetterinternet.org/sponsor/">sponsor</a> Let’s Encrypt please email us at <a href="mailto:sponsor@letsencrypt.org">sponsor@letsencrypt.org</a>. We ask that you make an <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/donate/">individual contribution</a> if it is within your means.</p>
