            <p><span>As the COVID-19 pandemic was getting underway in early 2020, doctors in Wuhan, China, began to report that many patients hospitalized with the disease had cardiac injuries. Heart attacks were frequent, especially in patients with underlying risk factors, and there were numerous cases of myocarditis, which occurs when the heart’s muscle layers become inflamed. Roughly a quarter of patients with severe COVID-19 had elevated blood levels of troponin, a protein marker for cardiac damage.</span></p><p><span>This evidence altered how COVID-19 was viewed; previously considered primarily a form of pneumonia, it now took on a coronary dimension. “We began to understand that it’s also a cardiovascular disease,” says Peter Libby, the Mallinckrodt Professor of Medicine at HMS and a cardiologist at Brigham and Women’s Hospital.</span></p><p><span>H</span><span>ospitalizations and deaths from COVID-19 have since fallen off, the result of widespread vaccinations and the population’s growing immunity against severe disease. But SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus that causes COVID-19, is still with us, along with the risk it poses to heart health, especially in people with blocked arteries, hypertension, diabetes, and other predisposing factors. Millions of people who recover from COVID-19 have gone on to develop lingering cardiovascular symptoms, including abnormal heartbeats, dizziness, and </span><span>s</span><span>hortness of breath.</span> &nbsp;</p><p><span>The number of COVID-19 cases is once again spiking — and the coronavirus continues to evolve. The latest omicron variant, BA.2.86, has more than thirty mutations that could allow it to evade the immune system’s defenses. Given the ongoing threat, research into COVID-19’s cardiovascular effects “remains vitally important,” says Anne-Marie Anagnostopoulos, a cardiologist and an HMS instructor in medicine at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. “We need a greater understanding of the associated pathophysiology to develop better treatments.”</span></p><h3><span><strong>Heart ills resulting from COVID</strong></span></h3><p><span>In most people — especially those who’ve been vaccinated — COVID-19 produces flu-like symptoms that typically resolve within a few days or weeks. But other people progress to a second, and more dangerous, phase of the disease, as pro-inflammatory proteins called cytokines proliferate in the blood. During this so-called cytokine storm, the immune system becomes hyperactive, “causing a different set of problems,” says Dara Lee Lewis, MD ’92, an HMS instructor in medicine at Brigham and Women’s and director of noninvasive testing and co-director of the Women’s Cardiology Program at the Lown Cardiology Group in Boston. “Patients can develop weakened heart muscles, low oxygen levels, blood clots, fluid in the lungs — problems that may require hospitalization.”</span></p><blockquote><p><span>We need a greater understanding of the associated pathophysiology to develop better treatments.</span></p></blockquote><p><span>More importantly, pre-existing cardiac risk factors, such as coronary artery disease and obesity — which can predispose patients to metabolic inflammation — raise the likelihood for poor outcomes. People with vulnerable hearts, Lee Lewis explains, are more likely to succumb to COVID-19 complications than others who do not have these risk factors. In a worst-case scenario, patients could experience a type 1 myocardial infarction, which is a heart attack caused when a blood clot blocks flow in the arteries.</span></p><p><span>But COVID-19 patients are also unusually prone to a different type of heart attack called a type 2 myocardial infarction. In these cases, the problem isn’t a blockage in the arteries, but rather a mismatch between oxygen supply and oxygen demand. Fever and inflammation accelerate heart rate and increase metabolic demands on many organs, including the heart. If infected lungs are incapable of effectively exchanging oxygen and carbon dioxide, then stressed hearts might suffer damage due to insufficient oxygen.</span></p><p><span>Lee Lewis says that early in the pandemic, myocarditis was also a major concern, especially for student athletes. “These kids didn’t need to just go back to work and life,” she says. “They needed to get back to competitive play.” Some students she cared for who had been sick with COVID-19 showed up with chest pain, racing hearts, shortness of breath, and evidence of myocarditis on magnetic resonance imaging.</span></p><figure role="group"><div>

<figcaption>Dara Lee Lewis</figcaption></figure><p><span>Studies from around the world were reporting that up to one-third of patients who had recovered from COVID-19 also showed evidence of asymptomatic myocarditis on imaging studies. This was troubling, since post-viral myocarditis is a known cause of sudden cardiac death in athletes. “We worried that many of our student athletes would be unable to return to competitive play,” Lee Lewis says. Fortunately, the asymptomatic cases turned out to be uneventful, and the affected students made full recoveries. “Asymptomatic myocarditis wasn’t as big an issue as we initially feared it would be,” Lee Lewis adds. “So, we stopped doing MRIs on everyone who walked in the door.”</span></p><h3><span><strong>A push to understand SARS-CoV-2</strong></span></h3><p><span>That COVID-19 could be so closely associated with heart health wasn’t entirely unexpected. Scientists already knew that other types of infections, such as flu and bacterial sepsis, can amplify cardiac risk factors. It’s not uncommon for older people to have inactive plaques in coronary arteries. The plaques can be destabilized by a localized inflammatory response to remote infections. COVID-19 put a spotlight on these connections and led to greater awareness of the interplay between infections and cardiac disease.</span></p><p><span>But as an unknown virus, SARS-CoV-2 raised many new questions. One example — whether the virus infects myocytes, the cells responsible for heart contractions — “was initially a big issue,” Libby says.</span></p><p><span>Research has since shown that myocytes for the most part escape infection. Instead, SARS-CoV-2 damages the heart indirectly by unleashing inflammatory reactions that affect cardiovascular functioning. Upon invading the body, SARS-CoV-2 latches onto cells studded with receptors that are susceptible to the coronavirus spike protein. The spike protein is key to the virus’s infectivity. Once the spike protein is docked to cell-based receptors, it acts to allow SARS-CoV-2 to enter a cell.</span></p><p><span>Respiratory epithelial cells are considered to be key targets of infection, as are pericytes, which are cells that wrap around capillaries. When infected by the virus, these cells release cytokines that, in turn, act on other cell types that collectively form the interior lining of all blood vessels in the body. This lining, known as the vascular endothelium, “can be thought of as an organ in and of itself,” Lee Lewis says. “The endothelium has a huge job in preventing inappropriate blood clots and allowing blood vessels to constrict and dilate when they normally should.”</span></p><p><span>Normally, the endothelium keeps blood flowing in a liquid state. But when cytokines activate endothelial cells, the cells transition to a defensive posture: they mobilize macrophages and other immune cells and release molecules that promote blood clotting.</span></p><p><span>“Cytokines speak to cells throughout the body,” explains Jeremy Luban, a professor at UMass Chan Medical School who also serves on the executive committee of the Massachusetts Consortium on Pathogen Readiness, an HMS-led multi-institutional effort to slow the spread of COVID-19 and prepare for future pandemics. “And among the cells that may be listening are endothelial cells, which constantly have to monitor for coagulation and tissue damage states and induce actions like clotting to stop bleeding and other measures to prevent harm to tissues.”</span></p><p><span>But blood clots can be lethal. They can, for instance, obstruct arteries feeding the brain. During the pandemic’s early months, arterial blockages were implicated in strokes in numerous patients, even in young people without predisposing risk factors. Autopsies of patients who died from COVID-19 revealed clots throughout the body and evidence of multiple organ failure. Up to one-third of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 were shown to have myocardial injuries that Libby attributes to microvascular clots and endothelial dysfunction, among other conditions.</span></p><h3><span><strong>POTS and viral infection</strong></span></h3><p><span>Microvascular damage has also been implicated in the long-term symptoms that now constitute a growing focus of COVID-19 research. “Even five months after the acute phase of the illness, we can detect these disturbances,” Libby says. He adds that answers to the mystery of what causes long COVID may be found in microvascular dysfunction.</span></p><p><span>Bruce Levy, the Parker B. Francis Professor of Medicine at HMS and a co-founder of Brigham and Women’s COVID Recovery Center, agrees. The fact that microvessels are present throughout the body, Levy says, might explain why long COVID has been associated with more than 200 symptoms affecting nearly every organ. Brain fog and the confusion and forgetfulness that attends it, for instance, might result from inflammation’s effects on blood vessels in the central nervous system, while long-term cardiovascular symptoms might arise from inflammation in the small vessels leading to and surrounding the heart.</span></p><p><span>A paper that appeared in August 2023 in </span><em><span>Nature Medicine </span></em><span>reported an extensive analysis of health care data collected by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs during a two-year follow-up of veterans who survived the first thirty days of a SARS-CoV-2 infection and data from a control cohort that had not shown evidence of infection. The study looked at risk of death, hospitalization, and pulmonary and nonpulmonary sequelae. Its findings showed that cardiovascular problems sometimes linger even in people who were never hospitalized for COVID-19. Levy, however, points out that severe initial disease is still the best predictor of long-term symptoms.</span></p><blockquote><p><span>POTS is something that we need to be on the lookout for. Many people suffer with it for weeks or months before getting a diagnosis.</span></p></blockquote><p><span>Among the more common lingering problems — affecting up to one-third of all patients with long COVID — is postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS), which causes the heart to beat abnormally fast. POTS can be diagnosed if a patient’s standing heart rate test measures a sustained increase of at least 30 beats per minute that persists for ten minutes or more after a patient stands. In many patients with POTS, standing heart rates exceed 120 beats per minute. People who have the condition often feel dizzy, fatigue easily, have trouble exercising, and are prone to fainting.</span></p><p><span>“POTS is something that we as cardiologists, friends, and neighbors need to be on the lookout for,” Lee Lewis says. “Many people suffer with it for weeks or months before getting a diagnosis.” POTS affects up to three million people in the United States, most of them women between the ages of 15 and 50, and often begins after pregnancy, trauma, or a major surgery. A family history of POTS also boosts the risk. But, according to Lee Lewis, POTS cases associated with COVID-19 can affect men or women. At this time clinicians are unsure what the prognosis will be for these patients.</span></p><p><span>How does virally triggered POTS develop in the first place? Mounting evidence points to inflammatory effects on nerves that control blood flow and heart rate. Apart from acting directly on the endothelium, inflammation targets small nerve fibers that dictate when blood vessels should dilate or constrict. Impulses sent through the sympathetic nervous system, for instance, normally tell blood vessels to constrict and the heart rate to increase during standing in order to maintain adequate blood pressure to the brain. However, in people with POTS, the blood vessels may not constrict appropriately. Instead, the heart rate must rise even more than normal to compensate for the “lazy” blood vessels, says Lee Lewis. Conversely, the parasympathetic nervous system kicks in when the body rests, instructing blood vessels to dilate and instructing the heart to beat more slowly so the blood pressure goes down.</span></p><p><span>When people stand, blood moves to the lower extremities. To counter this drop, the brain triggers the release of a burst of norepinephrine, which signals the sympathetic nervous system to cause vessels to constrict and the heart to beat faster, moving the blood back to the brain and torso. In someone with POTS, that normal response “gets thrown out of whack,” Lee Lewis says. The vessels don’t constrict and blood stays pooled in the legs, yet the heart rate speeds up and stays elevated.</span></p><p><span>Lee Lewis often works with Peter Novak, an associate professor of neurology at Brigham and Women’s and a specialist in long COVID. He describes POTS as one of many dysautonomias resulting from imbalances in the autonomic nervous system, which includes the sympathetic and parasympathetic systems. The autonomic nervous system controls involuntary physiological processes; not just heart rate and blood pressure, but also breathing, digestion, and sexual arousal. Novak estimates that 60 to 80 percent of patients with long COVID have symptoms of autonomic dysfunction, with POTS being the most common.</span></p><h3><span><strong>Treatments for long COVID</strong></span></h3><p><span>Levy describes long COVID as a post-pandemic pandemic. “Something like sixty-five million people worldwide have been affected,” he says, adding that long COVID profoundly affects people’s ability to work, go to school, or both. The COVID Recovery Center at Brigham and Women’s currently sees up to 150 patients each month and has a waiting list of four to six weeks. About 10 percent of the roughly four thousand patients seen so far were evaluated for cardiovascular problems.</span></p><p><span>But that’s probably an underestimate, Levy says, since patients with POTS and other cardiovascular symptoms are likely to be referred directly to cardiology and not the recovery center for initial evaluation and treatment.</span></p><p><span>According to Anagnostopoulos, therapeutic strategies for patients with long COVID and a POTS-like syndrome or exercise intolerance and tachycardia emphasize light exercise and structured endurance training. The goal is to ward off a “deconditioning spiral” that might cause the original problem to worsen. Similar to POTS, if patients remain sedentary for too long, Anagnostopoulos says, they could develop cardiac atrophy; decreased stroke volume, meaning that the heart doesn’t pump enough blood out of the left ventricle during contraction; or compensatory tachycardia, characterized by resting heart rates that exceed 100 beats per minute.</span></p><figure role="group"><div>

<figcaption>Anne-Marie Anagnostopoulos</figcaption></figure><p><span>“It’s important to acknowledge that these patients are suffering,” Anagnostopoulos says. “Many of them are young and unaccustomed to being sick or held back in any way from what they want to do. They often feel they haven’t been taken seriously. And what they want to know is that the doctor sitting with them is developing a plan for improvement.” Anagnostopoulos points to a 2022 report on long COVID in adults by the American College of Cardiology, which cautions against starting treatment for tachycardia or POTS with upright exercise such as power walking or jogging. According to the report, these activities might “worsen fatigue, resulting in post-exertional malaise.” The report’s authors recommend instead a preliminary strategy of recumbent and semi-recumbent exercises, such as stationary biking and rowing, with increasing intensity as a patient regains functional capacity.</span></p><p><span>Researchers are also making headway on how best to approach cardiovascular threats in acutely ill patients with COVID-19. Given a high prevalence of clotting disorders, it might be assumed that anticoagulants and antiplatelet treatments would improve outcomes. But some clinicians caution that bleeding risks from those drugs may outweigh their potential benefits. Advances are also being made in the use of anticytokines, such as glucocorticoids and monoclonal antibodies, to counter systemic inflammation.</span></p><p><span>Libby emphasizes that future trials investigating COVID-19’s cardiovascular effects need to be better coordinated. An initial rush to respond to the pandemic produced a flood of observational and non-randomized studies in this area, he says, which spread more confusion than illumination.</span></p><p><span>Although the pandemic seems to be receding, Luban cautions against complacency. Cardiovascular disease remains a leading killer and, after declining for years, deaths from heart attack and stroke rose again as SARS-CoV-2 spread worldwide. Fortunately, the virus has not yet evolved to a more virulent form, he says, adding that “it’s heartening that vaccine protection against hospitalization and severe disease seems to be hanging in there. But who knows what will happen? This virus has surprised us every step of the way.”</span></p><p><em><span>Charles Schmidt is a writer based in Maine.</span></em></p><p><em><span>Images: Dung Hong (collage); John Soares (Lee Lewis, Anagnostopoulos)</span></em><br>&nbsp;</p>

The data show encouraging signs of clinical activity and an increased persistence of cancer-specific CAR-T cells when combined with CARVac. At the ESMO Congress 2023 in Madrid, Prof. John Haanen, M.D., Ph.D., Netherlands Cancer Institute (NKI), Amsterdam, Netherlands presented the data in an oral late-breaking data session which confirms the positive interim data presented at this year’s American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting in Chicago, USA.</p>                            <p>“Our goal is to unlock the potential of CAR-T for solid tumors and to help improve the outcomes for a broad range of hard-to-treat tumors,” said <b>Prof. Özlem Türeci, M.D., Co-Founder and Chief Medical Officer at BioNTech</b>. “BNT211 aims to address two of the key limitations of CAR-T cell approaches in solid tumors, namely the lack of suitable cancer-specific cell surface targets and the limited persistence of CAR-T cells. To address this challenge, we have designed a CLDN6-specific autologous CAR-T cell therapy that we combine with our mRNA-based vaccine CARVac.”</p>                            <p>The data update included 44 patients who received CLDN6 CAR-T cells at four dose levels alone or in combination with CARVac. Patients with germ cell tumors (n=16), ovarian cancer (n=17) and other solid tumor types (n=11) were treated. In course of the dose escalation, a dose-dependent increase in adverse events was observed, with cytokine release syndromes occurring in 23 of 44 safety evaluable patients. In most cases, these were of grade 1 and 2, with one patient with a grade 3 and one with a grade 4 event. Neurotoxicity was mild and self-limiting in two patients. Of the total 44 patients, 38 were efficacy evaluable. The overall response rate (“ORR”) for these 38 patients was 45% and the disease control rate (“DCR”) 74%. Further, 27 patients were treated with CLDN6 CAR-T cells at dose level 2 (1x10<sup>8</sup> CAR-T cells) with or without CARVac. At this dose level, 13 patients showed partial responses resulting in an ORR of 59% and a DCR of 95%. Additionally, in the same cohort, patients who received CARVac showed a prolonged persistence of CAR-T cells. </p>                            <p>These results further underline the potential of BioNTech’s BNT211 program. One objective of the ongoing Phase 1/2 trial is to determine the recommended dose for the initiation of a potential pivotal Phase 2 trial in patients with germ cell tumors which is expected to be initiated in 2024. </p>                                         <p><b>About BNT211</b><br>To harness the power of cell therapies for solid cancers, BioNTech has combined their CAR-T and FixVac platform technologies to develop a tumor-specific CAR-T cell therapy which is enhanced by a <b><u>C</u></b>AR-T Cell <b><u>A</u></b>mplifying <b><u>R</u></b>NA <b><u>Vac</u></b>cine (CARVac) that is based on BioNTech’s mRNA-lipoplex technology and encodes for the CAR-T target antigen. The mRNA vaccine is designed to boost CAR-T persistence and functionality. BNT211 is a CAR-T cell therapy directed against the novel oncofetal antigen Claudin-6 (CLDN6), a target expressed on multiple solid tumors such as ovarian cancer, sarcoma, testicular cancer, endometrial cancer and gastric cancer. The program is currently being evaluated in a first-in-human Phase 1/2 trial as a monotherapy and in combination with a CLDN6-encoding CARVac in patients with CLDN6-positive relapsed or refractory advanced solid tumors.</p>                                         <p><b>About BioNTech</b><br>Biopharmaceutical New Technologies (BioNTech) is a next generation immunotherapy company pioneering novel therapies for cancer and other serious diseases.

        <p><em>Translations: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/itelma/blog/550620/" target="_blank">Russian</a></em></p>
        <p>In <a href="https://tonsky.me/blog/disenchantment/">Software Disenchantment</a> we’ve seen how software has degraded in the past two decades. Recently Jonathan Blow gave a talk where he explained why it might be happening:</p>
        <figure>
          <iframe width="635" height="358" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/pW-SOdj4Kkk" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
        </figure>
        <p>The talk is very, very good, but since I already know you won’t find time to watch it here’s my interpretation.</p>
        <p>The software crisis is systemic and generational. Say, the first generation works on thing X. After X is done and becomes popular, time passes and the next generation of programmers comes and works on Y, based on X. They do not need to know, exactly, how X is built, why it was built that way, or how to write an alternative X from scratch. They are not lesser people or lazier, they just have no real need to write X<sub>2</sub> since X already exists and allows them to solve more pressing tasks.</p>
        <p>The biggest a-ha moment of the talk was that if you are working on Y and Y is based on X, that does not imply automatically that you would know X also. Even if the people who build X are still around, knowledge does not spread automatically and, without actual necessity, it will go away with the people who originally possessed it.</p>
        <p>This is counter-intuitive: most people would think that if we’ve built, for example, a space ship or a complex airplane in the past, we could build it again at any time. But no, if we weren’t building a particular plane uninterruptedly, then after just 50 years it is already easier to develop a new one from scratch rather than trying to revive old processes and documentation. <em>Knowledge does not automatically transfer to the next generation.</em></p>
        <p>In programming, we are developing abstractions at an alarming rate. When enough of those are stacked, it becomes impossible to figure out or control what’s going on down the stack. This is where my contribution begins: I believe I have found some pretty vivid examples of how the ladder of abstractions has started to fall and nobody can do anything about it now because we all are used to work only at the very tip of it.</p>
        <p>Enter macOS Catalina. Every year Apple releases a new operating system and every year it needs a flagship feature to promote it. This year it was a long-overdue standalone Music app. Well, what could be simpler, right? List of files, categories, filters, smart lists. All that has been around in iTunes at least since 2001. But even if it wasn’t, how hard is it to build a decent music player? Many companies order of magnitude smaller than Apple have done it successfully in the past.</p>
        <p>And yet, it didn’t go smoothly. Guys at <a href="https://annoying.technology/" target="_blank">Annoying.Technology</a> have some great examples.</p>
        <p>Clicking one thing <a href="https://annoying.technology/posts/04769fafdac16826/" target="_blank">shows another</a>:</p>
        <figure>

          </video>
        </figure>
        <p>The Music.app header <a href="https://annoying.technology/posts/802dfae3517d4419/" target="_blank">is rendering wrong</a>:</p>
        <figure>
<img src="https://tonsky.me/blog/good-times-weak-men/musicappcatalina.png?t=1697909369" width="311" height="149">        </figure>
        <p>The problem is not limited to just Music. In Podcasts, some items are highlighted on selection, while others <a href="https://annoying.technology/posts/da8e5b3f56d9f767/" target="_blank">are not</a>:</p>
        <figure>

            <source src="https://tonsky.me/blog/good-times-weak-men/sidebarclickable.mp4?t=1697909370" type="video/mp4">
          </video>
        </figure>
        <p>As Philipp correctly mentioned,</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>It’s not some odd, third-party utility that somehow looks a bit funky on an obscure version of macOS. It’s the flagship rewrite of the new Music.app shipping with Catalina.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>I think this is a great example because all the possible explanations you might have for this if it was some other app, any other app, do not apply here.</p>
        <p>Lack of attention? Well, they CHOSE to make Music app. They CHOSE to make it a flagship product of Catalina. So there must’ve been thousands of eyes looking and checking. Didn’t help.</p>
        <p>Lack of resources? This is Apple, a company that could’ve hired anyone in the world. There are probably more people working on Music player than on the entire Spotify business. Didn’t help.</p>
        <p>They simply do not care? Well, again, Apple has been known for its attention to detail in the past and it has served them well. I doubt they intentionally completely changed company priorities just in this case. It’s only logical to assume they did care, but it didn’t help.</p>
        <p>This is just too far-fetching for a single bug? Well, the bugs are multiple and they contaminate all Catalina apps.</p>
        <p>A bug is too obscure? Well, What could be more evident than clicking on one thing and not have it selected?</p>
        <p>Lack of expertise? They’ve been building music players for 18 years now!</p>
        <p>Is the problem too complex? Is the scope too big? Actually, no. Music app is less powerful and more limiting than iTunes. That’s expected, of course, since iTunes had its time to develop, but still. This is a freaking music player. It’s not rocket science!</p>
        <p>Yes, these particular bugs are pretty minor and probably do not affect business in the short run, only Apple’s reputation. Still, <em>it is a big deal.</em> Imagine how tall, opaque and unstable that ladder of abstractions is that it’s even possible to fail such a simple thing as selecting an item in a list??? It is a freaking list and if you click it, it should select a thing that you just clicked. How hard of a task do you think that is? Why it has worked flawlessly since the first iPod with a monochrome screen and quarter of computing power of modern watch, but can’t be done in a flagship product of the most advanced operating system in the world?</p>
        <p>Because advanced means complex. So complex that no one could reasonably understand it or have control over it, even if they wanted. Apple DID want it. But even they couldn’t. Even with all the resources in the world.</p>
        <p>At this point, you might think I’m just picking on Apple or Catalina. God knows what went wrong there. Maybe they did change priorities and re-hired all the programmers. But no. This problem is universal.</p>
        <p>Amazon can’t <a href="https://twitter.com/nikitonsky/status/1206562961688596483" target="_blank">make a screen with two checkboxes</a>:</p>
        <figure>
          <video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" preload="auto" playsinline="" controls="" width="309" height="550">
            <source src="https://tonsky.me/blog/good-times-weak-men/amazon@2x.mp4?t=1697909369" type="video/mp4">
          </video>
        </figure>
        <p>I mean, yeah, Amazon was never known for producing quality software. Yet, I insist, the task is SO trivial, it’s so impossible to fail that it only demonstrates how bad people understand or control their tool.</p>
        <p>Twitter newly rebuilt UI <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkxBzJ8lYAY" target="_blank">takes 7× longer to load first tweet</a>, giving you essentially the same stuff but much later and with much more effort:</p>
        <figure>
          <video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" preload="auto" playsinline="" controls="" width="686" height="562">
            <source src="https://tonsky.me/blog/good-times-weak-men/twitter.mp4?t=1697909370" type="video/mp4">
          </video>
        </figure>
        <p>I don’t have numbers, but I’ve heard Gmail rewrite also made it much slower with no apparent new functions. It’s still pretty drastic if you put GMail next to Fastmail, or Twitter next to Tweetdeck, both of which didn’t get any full rewrites in the last decade, so you can see how fast even Web UI could be if we weren’t constantly climbing up the abstraction ladder.</p>
        <p>Docker and Electron are the most hyped new technologies of the last five years. Both are not about improving things, figuring out complexity or reducing it. Both are just compromised attempts to hide accumulated complexity from developers because it became impossible to deal with.</p>
        <p>And that’s sad.</p>

<p>What follows is, unspun and unvarnished, my account of my interview under Schedule 7 of the Terrorism Act as given to my lawyers:</p>
<p>I arrived from Keflavik airport, Iceland to Glasgow airport at about 10am on Monday 16 October. After passport control I was stopped by three police officers, two male and one female, who asked me to accompany them to a detention room.</p>
<p>They seated me in the room and told me:</p>
<p>I was detained under Section 7 of the Terrorism Act</p>
<p>I was not arrested but detained, and therefore had no right to a lawyer.</p>
<p>I had no right to remain silent. I had to give full and accurate information in response to questions. It was a criminal offence to withhold any relevant information.</p>
<p>I had to give up any passwords to my devices. It was a criminal offence not to do this.</p>
<p>They searched my baggage and my coat, going through my documents and taking my phone and laptop. They did not look at one document from Julian Assange’s lawyers that I told them was privileged.</p>
<p>They asked me about boarding cards for Brussels and Dublin they found and what I had been doing there. I replied I was at a debate at Trinity College in Dublin, while in Brussels I had attended a human rights meeting focused on the case of Julian Assange.</p>
<p>They asked me to identify the individuals from some visiting cards I had from the Brussels meeting (one was a German MP).</p>
<p>They asked me the purpose of my visit to Iceland. I told them that I was attending a coordinating meeting of the campaign to free Julian Assange. I said I had also attended a pro-Palestinian rally outside the Icelandic parliament, but that had not been a prior intention.</p>
<p>They asked how I earnt my living. I said from two sources: voluntary subscriptions to my blog, and my civil service pension.</p>
<p>They asked what organisations I am a member of. I said the Alba party. I said I worked with Wikileaks and the Don’t Extradite Assange campaign, but was not formally a “member” of either. I was a life member of the FDA union. No other organisations.</p>
<p>They asked if I received any money from Wikileaks, from Don’t Extradite Assange or from the Assange family (separate questions). I replied no, except occasional travel expenses from Don’t Extradite Assange. In December I had done a tour of Germany and received a fee from the Wau Holland Foundation, a German free speech charity.</p>
<p>They asked what other campaigns I had been involved in. I said many, from the Anti-Nazi League and Anti-Apartheid movement on. I had campaigned for Guantanamo inmates alongside Caged Prisoners.</p>
<p>They asked why I had attended the pro-Palestine demo in Iceland. I said one of the speakers had invited me, Ögmundur Jónasson. He was a former Icelandic Interior Minister. I said I did not know what the speeches said as they were all in Icelandic.</p>
<p>They asked whether I intended to attend any pro-Palestinian rallies in the UK. I said I had no plans but probably would.</p>
<p>They asked how I judged whether to speak alongside others on the same platform. I replied I depended on organisers I trusted, like the Palestine Solidarity Committee or Stop the War. It was impossible to know who everyone was at a big rally.</p>
<p>They asked if anyone else posted to my twitter or blog. I replied no, it was all me.</p>
<p>They asked how considered my tweets were. I replied that those which were links to my blog posts were my considered writing. Others were more ephemeral, and like everyone else I sometimes made mistakes and sometimes apologised. They asked if I deleted tweets and I said very seldom.</p>
<p>I volunteered that I thought I understood the tweet that worried them and agreed it could have been more nuanced. This was the limitation of twitter. It was intended to refer only to the current situation within Gaza and the Palestinian people’s right of self-defence from genocide.</p>
<p>That was more or less it. The interview was kept to exactly an hour and at one point one said to another “18 minutes left”. They did not tell me why. At one point they did mention protected journalistic material on my laptop but I was too dazed to take advantage of this and specify anything.</p>
<p>They took my bank account details and copies of all my bank cards.</p>
<p>ENDS</p>
<p>This is an enormous abuse of human rights. The abuse of process in refusing both a lawyer and the right to remain silent, the inquiry into perfectly legal campaigning which is in no way terrorism-associated, the political questioning, the financial snooping and the seizure of material related to my private life, were all based on an utterly fake claim that I am associated with terrorism.</p>
<p>I have to date not been arrested and not charged. Contempt of court is therefore not in play and you are free to comment on the case (although in the current atmosphere any kind of free thought is liable to vicious state action). I am safe and currently in Dublin. I intend next to travel to Switzerland to take this up with the United Nations.</p>
<p>My legal team have already made a submission against this outrage to the United Nations Human Rights Committee and are looking at the possibility of judicial review in the UK. We also have to prepare the defence against possible terrorism charges, ludicrous as that sounds. </p>
<p>I am afraid this all costs money. I am grateful for the unfailing generosity of people in what seems a continual history of persecution.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h4>Discover more from More Than Moore</h4><p>The latest in semiconductors: silicon, AI, processors, market trends.</p><p>Over 3,000 subscribers</p> </div><div dir="auto"><p>A quick one for you. I have received reports, now from multiple sources, that the major torch bearer of the RISC-V platform, a company known as SiFive and formed from the original architects of the RISC-V instruction set, has gone through some major changes.</p><p data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://morethanmoore.substack.com/p/the-risk-of-risc-v-whats-going-on?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a href="https://morethanmoore.substack.com/p/the-risk-of-risc-v-whats-going-on?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share" rel=""><span>Share</span></a></p><p>RISC-V is well known as the royalty free alternative to other core architectures on the market. The idea is that anyone can pick up the architecture, build their own core out of it, add their own custom features to it, then build it without any royalty payments. The problem is that building a core, or building an SoC, isn't that simple. Lots of techniques go into designing a core, and simply having an architecture isn't the end-point, it's merely the start. That's why RISC-V has seen a lot of adoption for people who want to design cores on paper, but then it has taken time to come into silicon. Even beyond that, if you want a chip that is either high performance, or high efficiency, or both, then you still need a team of dedicated core and SoC designers to go make that happen.</p><p><span>RISC-V has seen major pickup in the low-end core space, particularly replacing microcontrollers. Companies like Western Digital have been very public about their RISC-V cores replacing microcontrollers and other functions in their storage devices. Other companies like NVIDIA, Google, and recently Qualcomm, have staked their RISC-V intentions, and since the bust-up between Arm and China, RISC-V is taking a footing over there as well. Some companies are looking at high performance RISC-V cores, such as Tenstorrent (you can watch my video of their 128-core chiplet </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spipSjgKXu0" rel="">here</a><span>) and Ventana Micro. A lot of the companies involved in RISC-V are part of the RISC-V International consortium which essentially manages the ecosystem, with a lot of companies upstreaming key parts of the architecture and microarchitecture for performance, security, and other aspects. A level playing field for foundational support, such as an equivalent to ARM's SBSA L3 that ensures all servers meet specific minimum requirements, is also the target of RISC-V International.</span></p><p>There are also a number of companies in the Core IP business for RISC-V cores. SiFive has been the biggest for a while - it has achieved $365m in venture capital to date up to Series F, as well as sold off part of its assets for $220m in the last 12 months or so. Things have been riding high - it has a portfolio of cores that companies can license for their RISC-V designs, from microcontrollers to scalar cores to vector cores. It still follows the Arm model of licensing a core, but maintains the open-ness and customization that RISC-V offers.</p><p>So what is this news today? Through multiple sources, SiFive has instigated a large number of layoffs. Numbers vary, from 100 to 300+, but multiple sources confirm that most of the engineering team, especially the physical design engineers, sales, and product team. The management team have also been fired from what I've been told, leaving the founders and CEO Patrick Little at the helm. That's a heck of a shake up.</p><p>But that's not all. The product portfolio is also being gutted. SiFive's business always had two elements - predesigned cores you can pick up, most of which have already been silicon proved, and SiFive even announced two new cores literally only a week ago. The other half of the business is custom cores - where clients would approach the team with specific requirements and then SiFive would actually go and design it, to be installed into a full SoC. My contacts are telling me (although not to the same level of certainty as the layoffs) that the pre-designed core portfolio is no more. SiFive from now on it seems will only be working on custom cores.</p><p>I approached SiFive's PR agency to get details. They provided me with an official statement:</p><blockquote><p>“As we adjust to the rapidly changing semiconductor end markets, SiFive is realigning across all of our teams and geographies to better take advantage of the opportunities ahead, reduce operational complexities and increase our ability to respond quickly to customer product requirements. Unfortunately, as a result some positions were eliminated last week. The employees are being offered severance and outplacement assistance. SiFive continues to be excited about the momentum and long-term outlook for our business and RISC-V.”</p></blockquote><p>That statement confirms stuff is going on, but also doesn't say much. It confirms there are layoffs for sure, but then also says 'reduce operational complexity', which often means cutting the product portfolio. 'Responding quickly' means smaller teams more often than not, and 'realigning across geographies' may suggest pulling out of certain markets (i.e., sales). Perhaps a formal announcement will be made in due course.</p><p>This is a bit of a stab into the belly of RISC-V, given the prominence with which SiFive has taken to the industry in promoting RISC-V technology. It sounds like SiFive will stick around, however I wonder how long the founders will stay there if the only business being done is custom cores. Perhaps SiFive's big business was custom cores, and this is not much of a change, but given the numbers for layoffs I'm hearing, it sounds like there will be fewer contributions to the RISC-V standards from SiFive from now on. There's also the question of what this means for investors, what questions they'll be asking, and what answers they'll be getting.</p><p>More on this story as it develops. There's also a video version for those interested:</p><div id="youtube2-l0DUHZ1e48U" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;l0DUHZ1e48U&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:null,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}" data-component-name="Youtube2ToDOM"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/l0DUHZ1e48U?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="728" height="409"></iframe></p></div><h5><span>More Than Moore, as with other research and analyst firms, provides or has provided paid research, analysis, advising, or consulting to many high-tech companies in the industry, which may include advertising on the </span><a href="http://www.more-moore.com/" rel="">More Than Moore</a><span> newsletter or </span><a href="http://www.techtechpotato.com/" rel="">TechTechPotato</a><span> YouTube channel and related social media.

<p dir="auto">Revert makes it incredibly easy to build integrations with any third party API such as</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Go-to-market tools like CRMs (Salesforce, Hubspot).</li>
<li>Communication tools (Slack, MS Teams)</li>
<li>Ticketing tools like (Jira, Asana)</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">We believe an <strong>open source unified API</strong> enables us to cover the long tail of third party APIs while empowering engineers to customise the integration code we offer out of the box. This way engineers can use us over building everything from scratch.</p>

    <a href="#Unified-Versus-Split-Diff"><span>Unified Versus Split Diff</span> <time datetime="2023-10-23">Oct 23, 2023</time></a>
    </h2>
<p><span>Which is better for code reviews, a unified diff or a split diff?</span></p>
<p><span>A split diff looks like this for me:</span></p>

<figure>

<img alt="" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1711539/277481233-026508cf-47ed-4897-934a-fee18b708553.png">
</figure>
<p><span>And this is a unified one:</span></p>

<figure>

<img alt="" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1711539/277481510-12ee62af-0305-412b-9f37-57a37744751b.png">
</figure>
<p><span>If the changes are simple and small, both views are good. But for larger, more complex changes</span>
<span>neither works for me.</span></p>
<p><span>For a large change, I don</span>’<span>t want to do a </span>“<span>diff review</span>”<span>, I want to do a proper code review of a</span>
<span>codebase at a particular instant in time, paying specific attention to the recently changed areas,</span>
<span>but mostly just doing general review, as if I am writing the code. I need to run tests, use goto</span>
<span>definition and other editor navigation features, apply local changes to check if some things could</span>
<span>have been written differently, look at the wider context to notice things that </span><em><span>should</span></em><span> have been</span>
<span>changed, and in general notice anything that might be not quite right with the codebase,</span>
<span>irrespective of the historical path to the current state of the code.</span></p>
<p><span>So, for me, the ideal diff view would look rather like this:</span></p>

<figure>

<img alt="" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1711539/277485436-5e9ff9d5-325b-4e2c-8285-4acb6a8c088b.png">
</figure>
<p><span>On the left, the current state of the code (which is also the on-disk state), with changes subtly</span>
<span>highlighted in the margins. On the right, the unified diff for the portion of the codebase currently</span>
<span>visible on the left.</span></p>
<p><span>Sadly, this format of review isn</span>’<span>t well supported by the tools </span>—<span> everyone seems to be happy</span>
<span>reviewing diffs, rather than the actual code?</span></p>
<p><span>I have a low-tech and pretty inefficient workflow for this style of review. A </span><a href="https://github.com/matklad/config/blob/master/xtool/src/gpr.rs"><code>gpr</code>
<span>script</span></a><span> for checking out a pull</span>
<span>request locally:</span></p>

<figure>


<pre><code><span><span>$</span> gpr 1234 --review</span></code></pre>

</figure>
<p><span>Internally, it does roughly</span></p>

<figure>


<pre><code><span><span>$</span> git fetch unstream refs/pull/1234/head</span>
<span><span>$</span> git switch --detach FETCH_HEAD</span>
<span><span>$</span> git reset $(git merge-base HEAD main)</span></code></pre>

</figure>
<p><span>The last line is the key </span>—<span> it erases all the commits from the pull request, but keeps all of the</span>
<span>changes. This lets me abuse my workflow for staging&amp;committing to do a code review </span>—
<a href="https://github.com/kahole/edamagit"><span>edamagit</span></a><span> shows the list of changed files, I get </span>“<span>go to</span>
<span>next/previous change</span>”<span> shortcuts in the editor, I can even use the staging area to mark hunks I have</span>
<span>reviewed.</span></p>
<p><span>The only thing I </span><em><span>don</span>’<span>t</span></em><span> get is automatic synchronization between magit status buffer, and the file</span>
<span>that</span>’<span>s currently open in the editor. That is, to view the current file and the diff on the side, I</span>
<span>have to manually open the diff and scroll it to the point I am currently looking at.</span></p>
<p><span>I wish it was easier to get this close to the code without building custom ad-hoc tools!</span></p>

								<p>Voyager 2 is over 12 billion miles from Earth, making its way through interstellar space. Along its almost 50-year journey, the probe has seen more of the universe than we ever will. Now, NASA has completed a critical software update for <a href="https://bgr.com/tag/voyager-2/">Voyager 2</a> that will help keep it running even longer.</p><div>	<h4>Tech. Entertainment. Science. Your inbox.</h4>	<p>Sign up for the most interesting tech &amp; entertainment news out there.</p>		<p>By signing up, I agree to the <a rel="noopener" href="https://pmc.com/terms-of-use/" target="_blank">Terms of Use</a> and have reviewed the <a rel="noopener" href="https://pmc.com/privacy-policy/" target="_blank">Privacy Notice.</a></p>	</div>
<p>The update, which took almost 18 hours to complete, was transmitted to help Voyager 2 avoid the same problem that its sibling, <a href="https://bgr.com/tag/voyager-1/">Voyager 1</a>, experienced last year. Back in 2022, NASA reported issues with <a href="https://bgr.com/science/a-bizarre-mystery-surrounding-nasa-voyager-1-probe-is-being-investigated/">readings from Voyager 1’s AACS</a>, which stands for attitude articular and control system. The telemetry data that NASA was getting didn’t make sense, and NASA was concerned it had lost the probe forever.</p>


<p>Thankfully, the issue doesn’t seem to have caused any lasting issues with Voyager 1, but NASA wants to avoid the same thing happening with Voyager 2, so it just sent out this huge software update. The patch is essentially an insurance policy that NASA hopes will project the probe for future interstellar space exploration.</p>

<p>Because the space probe is so far away, the data it sends back is exceptionally unique and important. And, since it took so long to send the update, NASA scientists are carrying out a readout of the AACS memory to ensure that it is in the right place for the update. If there aren’t any issues, it will trigger the Voyager 2 update on October 28.</p>
<p>Considering <a href="https://bgr.com/science/voyager-2-signal-reestablished-after-nasa-shouted-into-the-cosmos/">NASA lost contact with Voyager 2</a> briefly earlier this year, the test has many people on the edge of their seats, waiting to see where things go.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/nasas-voyager-team-focuses-on-software-patch-thrusters">NASA plans</a> to use Voyager 2 as a testbed for the update. If all goes according to plan, it will also send the patch to Voyager 1, which is currently more than 15 billion miles away from Earth, thus making its data even more valuable than that of Voyager 2. </p>
<p>The space agency says it is also allowing both probes to turn more before reorienting them in an attempt to slow the build-up of propellant residue in the fuel lines. Either way, both probes will hopefully get the update, allowing them to run for several more years before NASA has to worry about either of them giving out.</p>

<!-- cache hit 1090:single/related:4f6936a0faae1fbdbb0ed14e7e27b054 --><!-- empty -->
<p>1Password, a password manager used by millions of people and more than 100,000 businesses, said it detected suspicious activity on a company account provided by Okta, the identity and authentication service that disclosed a breach on Friday.</p>
<p>“On September 29, we detected suspicious activity on our Okta instance that we use to manage our employee-facing apps,” 1Password CTO Pedro Canahuati wrote in an email. “We immediately terminated the activity, investigated, and found no compromise of user data or other sensitive systems, either employee-facing or user-facing.”</p>
<p>Since then, Canahuati said, his company had been working with Okta to determine the means that the unknown attacker used to access the account. On Friday, investigators confirmed it resulted from a breach Okta reported hitting its customer support management system.</p>
<p>Okta said then that a threat actor <a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2023/10/okta-says-hackers-breached-its-support-system-and-viewed-customer-files/">gained unauthorized access</a> to its customer support case management system and, from there, viewed files uploaded by some Okta customers. The files the threat actor obtained in the Okta compromise comprised HTTP archive, or HAR, files, which Okta support personnel use to replicate customer browser activity during troubleshooting sessions. Among the sensitive information they store are authentication cookies and session tokens, which malicious actors can use to impersonate valid users.
</p><p>Security firm BeyondTrust said it discovered the intrusion after an attacker used valid authentication cookies in an attempt to access its Okta account. The attacker could perform “a few confined actions,” but ultimately, BeyondTrust access policy controls stopped the activity and blocked all access to the account. 1Password now becomes the second known Okta customer to be targeted in a follow-on attack.</p>
<p>Monday’s statement from 1Password provided no further details about the incident, and representatives didn’t respond to questions. A report dated October 18 and shared on an internal 1Password Notion workspace said the threat actor obtained a HAR file a company IT employee had created when recently engaging with Okta support. The file contained a record of all traffic between the 1Password employee’s browser and Okta servers, including session cookies.</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>1Password representatives didn’t respond to a request to confirm the document's authenticity, which was provided in both text and screenshots by an anonymous 1Password employee.</p>
<p>According to the report, the attacker also accessed 1Password’s Okta tenant. Okta customers use these tenants to manage the system access and system privileges assigned to various employees, partners, or customers. The threat actor also managed to view group assignments in 1Password’s Okta tenant and perform other actions, none of which resulted in entries in event logs. While logged in, the threat actor updated what’s known as an IDP (identity provider), used to authenticate to a production environment provided by Google.</p>
<p>1Password’s IT team learned of the access on September 29 when team members received an unexpected email suggesting one of them had requested a list of 1Password users with admin rights to the Okta tenant. Team members recognized no authorized employee had made the request and alerted the company’s security response team. Since the incident came to light, 1Password has also changed the configuration settings for its Okta tenant, including denying logins from non-Okta identity providers.</p>
<p>A summary of the actions the attacker took are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Attempted to access the IT employee’s Okta dashboard but was blocked</li>
<li>Updated an existing IDP tied to 1Password’s production Google environment</li>
<li>Activated the IDP</li>
<li>Requested a report of administrative users</li>
</ul>
<p>On October 2, three days following the event, the attackers logged back into 1Password’s Okta tenant and tried to use the Google IDP they had previously enabled. The actor was unsuccessful because the IDP had been removed. Both the earlier and subsequent accesses came from a server provided by cloud host LeaseWeb in the US and used a version of Chrome on a Windows machine.</p>
<p>The Okta breach is one of a series of attacks in recent years on large companies that provide software or services to large numbers of customers. After gaining entry to the provider, attackers use their position in follow-on attacks targeting the customers. It is likely that more Okta customers will be identified in the weeks to come.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div fs-codehighlight-element="code" fs-toc-element="contents" fs-toc-offsettop="6rem" fs-toc-hideurlhash="true" fs-codehighlight-theme="base16/phd"><h2>What is Generative AI?</h2><figure><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/62e939ff79009c74307c8d3e/646b2da25475be2a2a5f6aac_d7a7a360.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>Example of background AI generated images</figcaption></figure><p>Generative AI refers to a type of artificial intelligence that is capable of generating new content that has not been explicitly programmed into the system. This is achieved by using machine learning algorithms to analyze and learn from large datasets, and then using that knowledge to create new content such as images, music, text, or even video.</p><p>Generative AI models are typically based on neural networks that use probabilistic methods to generate content that is similar to the training data, but not identical. For example, a generative AI model trained on a dataset of bird images might be able to generate new images of birds that have never been seen before.</p><h2>Why is Generative AI Useful?</h2><p>Generative AI has the potential to automate and streamline many tasks and processes, improve the quality and diversity of content, and provide new insights and predictions that can help individuals and organizations make better decisions. Specifically, it can be used in a variety of ways, such as:</p><ol role="list"><li><strong>Content Creation</strong>: Generative AI can be used to create new and original content, such as images, music, and text, that can be used in various industries, such as advertising, marketing, and entertainment.</li><li><strong>Data Augmentation</strong>: Generative AI can be used to create new data samples that are similar to existing data, which can be used to train machine learning models and improve their performance.</li><li><strong>Simulation</strong>: Generative AI can be used to create simulated environments and scenarios that can be used to test and evaluate new technologies, such as autonomous vehicles and robots.</li><li><strong>Personalization</strong>: Generative AI can be used to create personalized content, such as product recommendations and news articles, based on individual user preferences and behaviour.</li><li><strong>Predictive Analysis</strong>: Generative AI can be used to generate predictions and insights based on large datasets, such as predicting stock prices or identifying potential health risks.</li></ol><h2>What Images Can You Expect to Generate?</h2><p>Generative AI models excel at generating varying images in which there is a prominent object in the foreground and contextualized background. In these conditions, the models are capable of seamlessly replacing objects or backgrounds, changing graphic styles, or creating similar variations on images. This can allow users to easily create high quality art, create production quality product advertisement photos, or even augment and populate computer vision datasets by replacing backgrounds or foreground objects to cover edge cases.</p><h2>What are Some Generative AI Methods?</h2><p>There are many methods to generate data, ranging from more traditional cut-and-paste methods to from-scratch generation using state-of-the-art probabilistic models.</p><h4>Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)</h4><p>Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are a type of generative AI technique that uses a system of two neural networks to generate new content. The first network, called the generator, creates new samples, such as images or text, from a random noise signal. The second network, called the discriminator, evaluates whether the generated samples are similar enough to the training data.</p><figure><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/62e939ff79009c74307c8d3e/646b302a33d628c34a69a920_7de59d54.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>GAN architecture diagram (<a href="https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/gan/gan_structure" target="_blank">source</a>).</figcaption></figure><p>The generator and discriminator are trained together in a process known as adversarial training. The generator tries to create samples that can fool the discriminator into thinking they are real, while the discriminator tries to correctly classify the generated samples as fake. The result of this process is a generator network that is able to create new samples that are similar to the training data.</p><p>Despite their impressive results, GANs can be challenging to train and can suffer from issues such as mode collapse, where the generator produces a limited set of outputs rather than diverse and unique samples.</p><h4>Stable Diffusion</h4><figure><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/62e939ff79009c74307c8d3e/646b305d23fd983a2c83ee95_4170454c.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>Stable Diffusion model architecture diagram (<a href="https://scholar.harvard.edu/binxuw/classes/machine-learning-scratch/materials/stable-diffusion-scratch">source</a>).</figcaption></figure><p>Stable Diffusion is a variant of the diffusion process, which is a probabilistic model used in statistical physics to describe the behaviour of particles in a fluid. In the context of generative AI, <a href="https://stability.ai/blog/stable-diffusion-public-release" target="_blank">Stable Diffusion</a> refers to a method that gradually generates an image from a noise signal. The noise signal is passed through a sequence of increasingly complex convolutional neural networks (CNNs), with each network generating a slightly more refined version of the image. This process continues until the final output is generated, which is a high-quality image that is similar to the original training data.</p><p>The Stable Diffusion technique is designed to address some of the limitations of other generative AI techniques, such as generative adversarial networks (GANs), which can be unstable and difficult to train. Stable Diffusion is more stable and can produce high-quality, diverse, and realistic images that are suitable for a wide range of applications.</p><h2>Generating Product Images with Generative AI</h2><p>In this example, we will look at how we can combine certain methods together with traditional Computer Vision algorithms to generate more pristine images. The task for this example will be background augmentation for single objects, which can be used for a variety of applications such as object identification and product placement.</p><p>The three key ingredients for convincing and sufficiently varied images are:</p><ol role="list"><li><strong>Object Transform and Color Augmentations</strong>: creates more variation of the object to widen the variety of environments and scenarios it can be placed in.</li><li><strong>Background In-Painting</strong>: creates environmental variation in the background.</li><li><strong>Object In-Painting</strong>: fills in the background completely for a smoother transition between foreground and background.</li></ol><figure><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/62e939ff79009c74307c8d3e/646b30ca6c21bdbdd8611f1f_e34a2ec3.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>(a) Input image of a bottle of turmeric and ginger gummies (<a href="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0542/8677/8559/products/Tumeric-and-Ginger-Gummy-Vitamin_a_1200x1200.jpg?v=1621213802" target="_blank">source</a>), and (b) binary mask of the bottle. The object is filled with black pixels which are preserved during the in-painting process, while the remaining parts of the image with white pixels will be regenerated by Stable Diffusion.</figcaption></figure><p>All experiments below are run on a NVIDIA RTX 3080. If you wish to replicate the results or perform your own testing, it is recommended to use a GPU with at least 12GB of VRAM.</p><h4>Stable Diffusion In-Painting</h4><p>The original intent of Stable Diffusion was to generate new images from pure noise. However, one modification that has been gaining attention is the process of in-painting. It is traditionally a computer vision technique used to fill in or restore missing or damaged parts of an image. It involves automatically filling in the missing regions of an image with plausible content, such that the filled-in areas appear visually coherent and seamless with the surrounding areas. By masking certain areas of an image, we can direct Stable Diffusion to modify only the masked areas by iteratively re-noising and then denoising them based on a textual prompt.</p><p>We first need to obtain a segmentation mask of the object, which we can annotate on Datature’s Nexus to obtain a segmentation polygon. We then convert the polygon into a binary mask, where black pixels are preserved and white pixels will be in-painted.</p><div><pre><code>def annotation_to_mask(image, annotation):
   """Converts annotation to binary mask and saves it to disk.


   Args:
       image (np.array): Image to be masked.
       annotation (list):
           Annotation coordinates in the form of [x1, y1, x2, y2, ...].
   """
   annotation = np.array([(int(x), int(y))
                          for x, y in zip(*[iter(annotation)] * 2)])
   mask = np.ones(image.shape[:2], np.float32) * 255
   cv2.fillPoly(mask, [annotation], color=(0, 0, 0))
   cv2.imwrite(f"./mask/{IMAGE_NAME}", mask)</code></pre></div><p>We can then set up the Stable Diffusion pipeline by loading the image, mask, and set various parameters that are listed in the full code. To learn more on how the experimental parameters affect image generation, check out this <a href="https://blog.openart.ai/2023/02/13/the-most-complete-guide-to-stable-diffusion-parameters/" target="_blank">handy guide</a>. The prompt we will be using is “<em>on a table with turmeric and ginger</em>”.</p><div><pre><code># Load Stable Diffusion v2.1 checkpoint

However, there are a few imperfections, most notably that the borders between the object and the background are not pristine. The denoising process can sometimes warp the object which might not be ideal.</p><p>A less noticeable imperfection can be seen in the bottom row of text, which becomes gibberish. Though Stable Diffusion is known to be decent in generating text, especially in StabilityAI’s <a href="https://stability.ai/stablediffusion">latest XL model</a>, the text generation is typically guided by the prompt. In this case where there is existing text, it is not able to accurately reconstruct the text as this semantic information is not retained during the re-noising process. While larger text can be accurately reconstructed to a large degree, smaller text will suffer from being completely unintelligible. This is an issue that increasing the number of inference (denoising) steps to improve image quality and detail cannot solve.</p><h4>Two-Stage Background In-Painting</h4><p>To workaround this issue, we can perform object in-painting as a second stage to generate a pristine background. We then overlay the object (segmented from the original image using the binary mask) on top of the pristine background.</p><div><pre><code>
# Invert the binary mask so that object is in-painted

This seems to be a potential solution that can be used for image augmentation. However, we note that the object is still static. Its dimensions, location, and orientation are unchanged. This limits the amount of variation in the resulting generated dataset, and also limits Stable Diffusion in its generative power.</p><p>A solution to this is to perform traditional augmentations to the original image before it is fed into the Stable Diffusion pipeline. A popular library to do this is <a href="https://albumentations.ai/" target="_blank">Albumentations</a>, which efficiently implements a rich variety of image transform operations that are optimized for performance. It is widely used both in industry and in deep learning research.</p><div><pre><code>
TRANSFORM = A.ReplayCompose([
   A.ShiftScaleRotate(shift_limit=0.3,
                      scale_limit=[-0.4, -0.3],
                      rotate_limit=10,

                      value=[255, 255, 255],
                      mask_value=[255, 255, 255])
])

</code></pre></div><p>A sample transformation is shown by shifting, scaling, and rotating the object with varying parameters. When the transformed image is fed into the Stable Diffusion pipeline, we obtain the following images:</p><figure><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/62e939ff79009c74307c8d3e/646b35988a08e9c914fc737d_fda0e507.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>Output images after transformations and in-painting.</figcaption></figure><p>Further testing with other input images yields the following results:</p><figure><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/62e939ff79009c74307c8d3e/646b35988a08e9c914fc73f4_e6b5802e.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>(a) Input image of a pink luggage (<a href="https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gh-072522-away-luggage-1658760915.png?crop=0.651xw:1.00xh;0.175xw,0&amp;resize=1200:*">source</a>), and (b) binary mask of the pink luggage.</figcaption></figure><figure><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/62e939ff79009c74307c8d3e/646b3599a725242fc8b4f2f9_345d9441.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>Output images with prompt: “<em>luggage on the sidewalk</em>”.</figcaption></figure><figure><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/62e939ff79009c74307c8d3e/646b35992bb254ea3ad44b68_87c9a5e9.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>Output images with prompt: “<em>luggage in a train station</em>”.</figcaption></figure><p>The benefit of using transformation augmentations is that segmentation masks already exist for the objects, as the same transformations can be easily applied to the original mask.</p><h4>Colour Augmentation with InstructPix2Pix</h4><p>To create even more variation, we can utilize InstructPix2Pix to modify other aspects of the object. InstructPix2Pix is a conditional diffusion method for editing images from human instructions that combines the powers of Stable Diffusion and GPT-3. It is currently not robust enough to make drastic modifications to images without losing semantic information, hence our example will simply be to modify the colour of an object.</p><div><pre><code>

As pointed out by a fellow HackerNews reader, we clearly forgot to include our code snippet for ControlNet in the article.</blockquote><p>ControlNet can be similarly utilized If you wish to have some control over what is being generated, or perform some style transfers to your objects and backgrounds. Any input images can first be preprocessed to generate a Canny edge map, which is then fed into the ControlNet pipeline for directed generation. Further preprocessing may be needed depending on your input image and the level of detail desired for the image generation to be visually realistic.</p><div><pre><code>
from diffusers import ControlNetModel, StableDiffusionControlNetPipeline

# ... image loading code ...
image = ...

# Preprocess image to a Canny edge mask
# Modify these values to change the edge detection depending on your image
low_threshold = 100
high_threshold = 200

image = cv2.Canny(image, low_threshold, high_threshold)
image = image[:, :, None]
image = np.concatenate([image, image, image], axis=2)
canny_image = Image.fromarray(image)

# Load ControlNet and SD1.5 model
controlnet = ControlNetModel.from_pretrained("lllyasviel/sd-controlnet-canny", torch_dtype=torch.float16)

There is no universal solution that can reliably work on custom datasets and there is insufficient fine-grained control over how images can be specifically augmented.</p><p>The generation is also not fully automatic since there is a lot of prompt engineering and cherry picking involved, which requires a lot of user intervention and a deeper understanding of the nature of the dataset. Due to the compute power and time necessary to generate these images, it would be impractical to scale up to large dataset generation without investing heavily in dedicated hardware.</p><div>

<p>Note</p>
<p>This is a work in progress, based on my talk at Identiverse 2023. It’s intended
to be a starting point for discussion, not a complete or unambiguous spec.
Please get in touch if you have questions, comments, or suggestions; I’ll

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction<a href="#introduction" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>WebSession is a proposed replacement for cookies when establishing and
maintaining user sessions in a Web browser. Its goals are to be more secure,
offer more user control, and protect privacy better than cookies, while
remaining fast and easy to implement.</p>
<p>WebSession is separate from authentication protocols like usernames and
passwords, <a href="https://webauthn.guide/">WebAuthn</a>, and <a href="https://openid.net/connect/">OpenID Connect</a>. Those <em>prove</em> who you are;
WebSession is a way for the server to <em>remember</em> who you are across multiple
HTTP requests. WebSession also allows for existing unauthenticated use cases
supported by cookies, where you may not have a user account (or want to log
in), but still need to maintain state across requests. Examples include
anonymous shopping carts and ‘guest’ checkout, personalization without creating
a user account, A/B testing, analytics, and more.</p>
<h2 id="whats-wrong-with-cookies">What’s wrong with cookies?<a href="#whats-wrong-with-cookies" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<h3 id="security">Security<a href="#security" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>Currently when you log into a website, the server generates a unique session
ID and stores it in your browser as a <strong>cookie</strong>. On every subsequent request,
your browser sends this cookie to the server to prove that it’s you making the
request. This cookie, whether a <a href="https://jwt.io/">JWT</a> or opaque session identifier, is called
a <strong>bearer token</strong>, because it grants the holder the right to skip a full
authentication ceremony on every request, and no additional ‘proof’ is required
other than knowledge of the token.</p>
<p>If someone steals this cookie, they can impersonate you. Stolen cookie attacks
have happened in the past <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/7kvkqb/how-ea-games-was-hacked-slack">with disastrous effect</a>, and there
is <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/operation-cookie-monster-international-police-action-seizes-dark-web-market-2023-04-05/">a thriving trade in stolen cookies on the dark web</a>.</p>
<p>Cookies have a large surface area of attack, and little room for error. Secure
use of cookies for tracking a browser session includes, but is not limited to:</p>

<li>Setting the <code>Secure</code> flag so they are only sent over secure connections;</li>
<li>Setting the <code>SameSite</code> flag to prevent <abbr title="Cross-Site Request

<li>Setting a reasonable expiry, and enforcing it on the server;</li>
<li>Correctly scoping the domain and path so that only the endpoints that are

<li>Ensuring your server does not have any application code that may

<li>Ensuring cookies are not inadvertently logged or stored unsafely.</li>
</ul>
<p>Even with all of these, a compromised client, an unsecured application log, or
an eavesdropper on the connection after TLS termination could result in a
cookie being stolen. It is difficult to distinguish an attacker using a stolen
cookie from the legitimate user to whom it was originally issued.</p>
<h3 id="privacy-user-control-and-user-experience">Privacy, User Control, and User Experience<a href="#privacy-user-control-and-user-experience" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>Cookies were invented in 1994, and started out as a generic
mechanism for persistent key-value state which were quickly
adopted to provide authentication too. However as an ad hoc K/V
store, there is nothing reliably distinguishing ‘essential’
(i.e. authentication) cookies from analytics, tracking,
advertising, or preference cookies. As a result of increasingly
strict privacy laws across the world, users are now beset with
<a href="https://cookieinformation.com/cookie-banner/">cookie banners</a> across the Web, with no standard way to
either consent to or reject non-essential cookies.</p>
<p>We need a protocol that is dedicated to session maintenance, that gives control
back to the user either through prior browser configuration or a
consent-on-first-visit model. Browsers could use system-native, accessible UIs
that don’t interrupt content loading or page layout.</p>
<p>It’s also very common that a website wants credentials to be cleared when the
user is inactive for a certain amount of time. This is important for sensitive
applications such as banking and healthcare. Currently there’s no way to
enforce that a cookie is cleared on device lock or user inactivity,
<em>especially</em> because security requires that such cookies not be visible to
JavaScript. A native session management solution should be able to request that
the browser clear a session in the case of device lock, the user navigating
away, etc.</p>
<h2 id="how-would-websession-solve-these-problems">How would WebSession solve these problems?<a href="#how-would-websession-solve-these-problems" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<h3 id="security_1">Security<a href="#security_1" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>WebSession does not rely on bearer tokens. Instead, the browser and server
agree on a shared secret at the beginning of the session, using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffie%E2%80%93Hellman_key_exchange">Diffie-Hellman
key exchange (DHKE)</a>. This secret is never sent over the network, and it
cannot be computed by an eavesdropper, even with full observation of requests
and responses, thanks to the security guarantees of DHKE.</p>
<p>For every request, the browser generates a unique string (aka a ‘nonce’), which
it <em>signs</em> with the shared secret. The nonce and signature are sent with the
request, and the server can then verify that signature, while also checking to
make sure that nonce has not been used before.</p>
<p>WebSession does not treat security as optional, so there are no flags like
<code>Secure</code>, <code>SameSite</code>, or <code>HttpOnly</code> to forget. An endpoint that inadvertently
reflects headers would be useless if the server is tracking nonces properly. A
server-side expiry mechanism is still needed, and domain/path scoping may be
necessary. Even so, if a ‘bad’ endpoint receives a valid WebSession header, it
is limited to forging a single request, rather than having a reusable session
cookie that may allow an unbounded number of impersonated requests.</p>
<h3 id="privacy">Privacy<a href="#privacy" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>WebSession tokens are opaque identifiers, unlinkable back to real-world user
identities. Without extra work, they only identify the browser instance
between requests, not the user.</p>
<p>Because WebSession is dedicated to session maintenance and nothing else, a
client could theoretically reject <em>all</em> cookies on any supporting site, ideally
skipping the jarring cookie banner experience.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the browser-native integration could include things like a request
to clear a session on inactivity, device lock, navigation away from the page,
etc. This is best done via a browser-integrated, purposeful protocol for
session management rather than ad hoc JavaScript on every site.</p>
<h2 id="what-else-could-websession-provide">What else could WebSession provide?<a href="#what-else-could-websession-provide" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>Typically a browser session is identified with a particular human user, and one
of the most exciting new standards on the web today is <a href="https://webauthn.guide/">WebAuthn</a>, which
allows for cryptographically secure user verification. In theory, WebSession
could be extended with options asking the client to use the WebSession derived
secret as the challenge for a WebAuthn assertion. This would provide strong
proof to the server that the session has been established by the authenticated
user, thwarting even active MITM attacks.</p>
<h2 id="protocol-description">Protocol Description<a href="#protocol-description" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<h3 id="initial-request">Initial Request<a href="#initial-request" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>The browser makes a standard GET request to the website. In this case we’ll
assume the URL is <code>https://example.com/</code>.</p>
<h3 id="server-challenge">Server Challenge<a href="#server-challenge" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>The server generates and stores an ephemeral keypair for DHKE, hereby referred
to as <code>Spub</code> and <code>Spriv</code>. This will most likely be a point on the NIST P-256 or
X25519 elliptic curves.</p>
<p>The server then responds to the initial request with a <code>WWW-Authenticate</code>
header with the auth scheme <code>WebSession</code>, followed by a <strong>challenge</strong> as
unpadded <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4648#section-5">base64url</a>-encoded <a href="https://cbor.io/">CBOR</a>. These parameters include:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>alg</code>: an indication of the DHKE algorithm and other parameters.
  For example:</li>
<li><code>P256</code>, <code>P384</code>, <code>P521</code> etc.: ECDH over the corresponding NIST prime curves;</li>
<li><code>X25519</code>, <code>X448</code>: ECDH over Curve25519 and Curve448.
  At a minimum, implementations should support <code>P256</code> and <code>X25519</code>, since these
  are compact, widely available, and provide 128 bits of security.</li>
<li><code>exp</code>: the session expiry, as a UNIX timestamp (seconds since the epoch in
  UTC);</li>
<li><code>h</code>: which hashing algorithm to use for signatures. Must be one of <code>SHA-256</code>,
  <code>SHA-384</code>, or <code>SHA-512</code>.</li>
<li><code>s</code>: the encoding of <code>Spub</code>, specific to <code>alg</code>. Weierstrass curves like
  the NIST prime curves should use the compressed point format; Curve25519 and
  Curve448 points are usually only expressed in compressed form anyway. Since
  we’re using CBOR, these can be included in the object as a raw byte string.</li>
<li>Any as-yet undefined options.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="example">Example<a href="#example" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h4>

<p>Would result in this HTTP response:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code>200 OK

</code></pre></div>
<h3 id="client-response">Client Response<a href="#client-response" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>At this point the browser can decide whether to initiate a session or not,
either based on interactive user feedback, previous behavior, or prior
configuration. If no session is desired, the client simply doesn’t respond to
the challenge, and continues making requests as usual. The rest of this
document assumes a session is desired.</p>
<ul>
<li>The client generates its own keypair, scoped to the origin (hereafter <code>Cpub</code>
  and <code>Cpriv</code>);</li>
<li>It derives a shared secret, using DH between <code>Spub</code> and <code>Cpriv</code>, and then
  applying <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HKDF">HKDF</a> on the resulting bytes (with the hashing algorithm <code>h</code>
  requested by the server earlier);</li>
<li>It chooses a 32-byte secure random nonce;</li>
<li>It builds a token <strong>body</strong> as a CBOR object containing:</li>
<li><code>s</code>: the server public key;</li>
<li><code>c</code>: the client public key;</li>
<li><code>o</code>: the origin;</li>
<li><code>n</code>: the nonce.</li>
<li>It produces a <strong>signature</strong> by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMAC">HMAC</a>ing the token body using the shared secret
  as the key;</li>
<li>Finally, it constructs an ASCII token by unpadded base64url-encoding the
  signature and body and then concatenating them with a ‘.’ character.</li>
</ul>
<p>In Python pseudocode:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>c_pub</span><span>,</span> <span>c_priv</span> <span>=</span> <span>gen_keypair</span><span>()</span>

</code></pre></div>
<p>This token is then included in the next client request in the <code>Authorization</code>
header, with an auth scheme of <code>WebSession</code>. For example:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code>GET / HTTP/1.1

</code></pre></div>
<h3 id="server-validation">Server Validation<a href="#server-validation" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>The server validates an incoming request by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Splitting the token signature and body at the ‘.’ character and base64url-decoding them;</li>
<li>CBOR-parsing the body to extract <code>Cpub</code>, <code>Spub</code>, <code>origin</code> and <code>nonce</code>;</li>
<li>Looking up the corresponding <code>Spriv</code> for the session;</li>
<li>Deriving the same shared secret, using <code>Cpub</code> and <code>Spriv</code> and HKDF;</li>
<li>The shared secret may be cached for subsequent requests against the same
    <code>Spub</code> and <code>Spriv</code>; if it is not cached, the server MUST validate that the
    included <code>Cpub</code> does not change across requests.</li>
<li>Validating that the nonce has not been used already for this session.
  <strong>Important:</strong> at this point, the nonce should be added to the ‘seen’ set,
  because nonces should be invalidated whether the signature validation passes
  or fails. Failure to do so can allow attackers to brute-force a valid
  signature for a single nonce.</li>
<li>(Recommended) validating the origin is as expected;</li>
<li>Computing the HMAC over the provided token body and checking the signature.
  <strong>Note</strong>: it’s important to use a constant-time comparison function for the
  signature checking. Many crypto libraries have a ‘verify’ function which will
  do this, rather than computing the signature as a string and checking for
  equality.</li>

		<p>One of the most distinctive features of Apple silicon chips is that they have two types of CPU core, E (Efficiency) cores that are energy efficient but slower than the P (Performance) cores, which normally run much of the code in the apps we use. Apps don’t decide directly which cores they will be run on, that’s a privilege of macOS, but they register their interest by setting a Quality of Service, or QoS, which is then taken into account when they’re scheduled to run. With the introduction of <a href="https://eclecticlight.co/2023/10/18/how-game-mode-manages-cpu-and-gpu/">Game Mode</a> in Sonoma, CPU scheduling can now work differently, with E cores being reserved for the use of games. This article looks at another atypical situation, when running a macOS virtual machine (VM) assigned a set number of virtual cores. How does macOS Sonoma handle that?</p>
<h4>CPU cores</h4>
<p>M-series chips contain different types and numbers of CPU cores, depending on the model:</p>
<ul>
<li>Base models contain 4 E and 4 P cores; for the M1, those are Icestorm and Firestorm respectively, while the M2 has Blizzard and Avalanche. These are configured in two clusters, one containing the E cores, the other the P cores. Within each cluster, all cores are run at the same frequency, and they share L2 cache.</li>
<li>Pro and Max models contain 2-4 E and 6-8 P cores, in one E cluster and two P clusters, again running at a common frequency within the cluster, and sharing L2 cache.</li>
<li>Ultra models contain 4 (M1) or 8 (M2) E and 16 P cores, their clusters having common frequencies and L2 caches.</li>
</ul>
<p>In broad terms, allocation of executable threads to different cores depends on:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>QoS</strong> assigned to each thread. Those given low values for background and maintenance tasks, including Time Machine backups and Spotlight indexing, are run on E cores, and have no external control to allow their rescheduling to P cores. Those with higher QoS can be run on either P or E cores, and external controls can restrict them to E cores alone, although they’ll normally be run on P cores when they’re available.</li>
<li><strong>Clustering</strong>. Because all cores in a cluster run at the same frequency, it’s more efficient to recruit additional cores in the same cluster, as they’ll already be running at a higher frequency, rather than a core in a different cluster, whose frequency may then need to be increased. Clusters are normally recruited in sequence too: in Macs with two P clusters, threads are normally run on the first of those (P0), and only when additional cores are required is the second (P1) recruited. Running with a light load, P0 is therefore likely to be more active than other P clusters, which may spend long periods idling.</li>
<li><strong>Order</strong> within a cluster. Although applied more loosely than other principles, there is an observed tendency to recruit cores in order within a cluster. Where the P0 cluster contains cores P2, P3, P4 and P5, threads tend to be loaded onto P2 first, and P5 last. However, running threads are often relocated within a cluster, following which P2 may be left idle, while P5 bears the brunt.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thread scheduling and dispatch contains many more subtleties, but those influences normally dominate what you see in practice.</p>
<h4>Virtual CPU cores</h4>
<p>Under macOS lightweight virtualisation, virtual machines (VMs) are allocated a number of virtual CPU cores, all of which are the same type, equivalent to a P core. There is thus no option to allocate threads running in the VM to E cores on the host. This is illustrated in the following examples shown in Activity Monitor’s CPU History window.</p>

<p>Two different loads were applied to the M1 Max shown here: the two long peaks seen on the E cores were floating-point threads at a QoS of 9 for a background task, while the shorter peaks on four P cores were the same threads at a QoS of 33 for priority user tasks.</p>

<p>When the same sequence was run on a VM with 4 virtual CPU cores, the QoS made no difference to the performance or core allocation seen in the VM.</p>

<p>On the host, both thread loads were run similarly on the first cluster of P cores. This might suggest that the host simply hands over the cluster of P cores to be scheduled and dispatched by the VM. If you rely on what you’re shown in Activity Monitor, you could be tempted to reach that conclusion.</p>
<h4>Methods</h4>
<p>To assess core allocation for VMs, I used a Mac Studio M1 Max running Sonoma 14.0. A Sonoma 14.0 VM was built using Viable, and run during tests using that virtualisation app. Test loads were applied from the VM using my app AsmAttic, each thread running 5 x 10^8 tight loops of purposeless assembly code performing floating point arithmetic using registers alone. I detailed <a href="https://eclecticlight.co/2021/11/26/how-can-you-compare-the-performance-of-m1-chips-2-core-allocation/">this here</a>. Each thread typically takes about 3.2 seconds to complete, and serves here as an in-core load, not a benchmark. During each of those runs, <code>powermetrics</code> was run on the host to log <code>cpu_power</code> measurements over 0.1 second sampling periods. Frequency and active residency for all the cores was then extracted and analysed using DataGraph. Test runs included the same VM configured with 3 and 4 virtual cores, and with 1-6 threads, all at a QoS of 33.</p>
<h4>Single threads</h4>

<p>Running a single thread on three or four virtual cores resulted in the expected rapid change in P0 cluster frequency (above), and in active residency (percentage of available processor cycles that aren’t idle), shown below. As this gives total active residency for the whole cluster of four cores, its maximum is 400%. Although there are small peaks above the expected 100% for a single thread, those were probably threads from other processes.</p>

<h4>Multiple threads</h4>
<p>As the number of threads run on the VM increases, so the number of cores running them rises to the limit imposed by the number of virtual cores. Looking first at the effect on host clusters, these might imply that VM threads are confined to the single P cluster, P0.</p>

<p>This chart shows cluster frequencies for the three clusters in the M1 Max. The test load was applied just after 1 second, and was completed at about 4 seconds, matching the reported elapsed time of about 3.2 seconds. P0 frequency (solid line) rose rapidly to just over 3,000 MHz, and was sustained at that until completion. The other P cluster (P1) was run much of that time at its idle of 600 MHz, with short peaks up to 2,500 MHz. The E cluster was run throughout at about 1,000 MHz, with fewer and smaller peaks.</p>

<p>Here, to enable easier comparison, cluster active residency is shown with a scale maximum of 100% for each of the three clusters. The effect of the load on P0 active residency (solid line) dominates much as it did for frequency, but there are also many smaller and briefer peaks. To unravel what those represent, you need to analyse individual core responses.</p>
<h4>Individual P cores</h4>
<p>A simple starting point is analysing the active residency in P0 by individual core, for a single thread test.</p>

<p>This bar chart shows just the test period, here as sample number rather than time (each sample representing approximately 0.1 second). Active residency for the first core, P2, is shown in red, P3 in orange, P4 in blue, and P5 in purple. The bulk of the test thread was run on P2 to begin with, swapped over to P4, then brought back to P2 to complete. There are, though, significant contributions made by P3 as well.</p>
<p>Extending this analysis to other thread numbers, and 4 virtual cores, demonstrated that all cores in the P0 were used to run the test threads, which were moved around not infrequently during each test run.</p>

<p>It’s only when you look at active residency across all P cores that the picture becomes clear: when the second P cluster is active, it appears to be handling some of the test load. This shows active residency for all eight P cores, when running 4 threads on 4 virtual cores. To maintain the 400% required to complete the threads on time, there are several sample periods in which P6 and P7 take significant load, for example in samples 12 and 27, about 1 and 2.5 seconds into the test.</p>
<p>Core allocation of threads being run on virtual cores thus appears to follow the same general rules as host threads running at high QoS, and shows no particular affinity for clusters or cores. Thus virtualisation isn’t a different mode, as far as core allocation is concerned.</p>
<h4>Conclusions</h4>
<ul>
<li>Threads from VM virtual cores are invariably run at high QoS, and are scheduled and dispatched by the host macOS in accordance with its normal rules. Virtualisation doesn’t bring any special core allocation or CPU performance mode.</li>
<li>Those threads are mobile across cores as with any other thread.</li>
<li>There’s no evidence that macOS makes any attempt to allocate virtual cores to physical cores.</li>
<li>Software in a VM has no means of designating that any of its threads should be run at lower QoS, or on host E cores. VMs thus lack energy efficiency and background performance advantages of macOS running on an Apple silicon host.</li>
</ul>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-id="page-content" data-og-area="article-blocks" id="incArticle"><p>Modern cars are indeed very smart, though no car is perfect. One enterprising developer decided to make his <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/category/mazda-news" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mazda</a> a little smarter through code and share his work with others like him online. Unfortunately, the automaker took issue with his improvements, and hit the project with a Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) claim, forcing it to be taken down.</p><p>Developer Brandon Rothweiler authored Mazda-specific integrations for Home Assistant, an open-source platform that can be used to run and establish interoperability between a variety of connected devices. Rothweiler's code plugged into Mazda's Application Programming Interface or API, allowing owners to create and share a number of seemingly inoffensive, convenience-minded functions, like checking and alerting fuel levels before a daily commute, or <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/news/why-the-iphone-15-pros-action-button-doubles-as-the-perfect-car-key-fob" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">remotely unlocking and firing up the car</a> when outside temperature drops below a certain threshold, as <em><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/10/mazdas-dmca-takedown-kills-a-hobbyists-smart-car-api-tool/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ars Technica</a></em> summed up in its coverage.</p><p>Mazda caught wind, however, and served Home Assistant, GitHub (where the software was hosted), and Rothweiler cease and desist orders, citing a number of infringements. The automaker argued that Rothweiler's work contained code that violated its copyrights; used its "proprietary API information" to create more code; and that the integrations provided functionality identical to what currently exists in Mazda's own mobile apps. <em>The Drive</em> reached out to Mazda to clarify its position on these claims, and will update this story should we learn anything.</p><figure data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="1" data-og-block-type="core/image"><span data-rawhtml="1">Interior of the Mazda CX-90 SUV. <em>Mazda</em></span></figure><p>Rothweiler promptly pulled his work and told <em>Ars </em>that he was ultimately left with little choice. "My options were to either comply or open myself up to potential legal risk," the developer told the publication. "Even if I believe that what I'm doing is morally correct and legally protected, legal processes still have a financial cost. I can't afford to take on that financial risk for something that I do in my spare time to help others."</p><p>Responses to <a href="https://www.home-assistant.io/blog/2023/10/13/removal-of-mazda-connected-services-integration/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Home Assistant's own takedown announcement</a>, as well as posts on a <a href="https://www.cx70forum.com/threads/mazda-has-forced-home-assistant-to-remove-their-extremely-useful-mazda-integration.337/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mazda SUV forum</a>, make the owner community's frustration clear. One such user dismayed at the news wrote that the features he had been using for his <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/news/44641/2023-mazda-cx-60-new-rwd-based-hybrid-suv-platform-debuts-with-323-hp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CX-60</a> "make Home Assistant more useful, save money, and make me happier about my Mazda ownership."</p><p>It's unclear what legal basis Mazda has to order a DMCA takedown, as <a href="https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/101849#issuecomment-1758780625" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">one GitHub user highlighted</a> that they weren't able to locate any copyrighted code in Rothweiler's work, and the <a href="https://www.eff.org/issues/coders/reverse-engineering-faq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Electronic Frontier Foundation</a> believes that reverse engineering for the purposes of interoperability can qualify as fair use.</p><p>Regardless, maximizing the convenience of connected cars in a manner that doesn't sacrifice the safety or security of those vehicles, or steal software that legally belongs to an automaker is an undeniable facet of car modification in the modern age. In fact, many manufacturers appear to be OK with especially resourceful owners optimizing their cars in this way. Home Assistant's integration library <a href="https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/#car" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">features at least six automakers</a>, including BMW and Volvo, while <a href="https://interestingengineering.com/transportation/tesla-finally-supports-third-party-apps-with-official-api" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tesla recently published details</a> of its new, official, open API for third-party developers to employ.</p><p>Carmakers can pretend all they like that <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/news/all-these-promised-ev-swaps-need-high-voltage-inverters-automakers-step-up" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">electrification</a> and ever-more connected vehicles will offer the same degree of room for personalization and independence as cars always have, but until they start backing that up with real action and back down from <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/news/feds-ok-massachusetts-right-to-repair-law-so-the-state-can-finally-enforce-it" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">their litigious ways</a>, it'll all be insincere.</p></section></div>]]></description>

<p>In a shocking turn of events, several smartphone manufacturers, including industry giant Samsung, have taken a drastic step that has left customers outraged. These companies have remotely disabled phones purchased through gray markets, effectively holding the users’ data hostage until they buy new phones from official retailers. This unethical practice has raised questions about consumer rights, the role of governments, and the level of control that manufacturers can exert over devices.</p>







<p><strong>Gray Market Phones in Mexico</strong></p>



<p>Many people in countries like Mexico often purchase gray market phones due to economic constraints. These devices are not stolen but are originally intended for other regions. They work perfectly well in their new homes, providing cost-effective alternatives to official store purchases.</p>



<p>However, users of these gray market phones in Mexico started receiving alarming messages on their devices. These messages warned them that their devices would be disabled for not complying with Mexican regulations, and they were urged to buy approved devices. Such messages appeared on phones from various manufacturers, but Samsung was the most aggressive in its approach.</p>











<p><strong>Samsung’s Heavy-Handed Approach</strong></p>



<p>Samsung’s actions were particularly egregious. Not only did they send messages regarding non-compliance with Mexican regulations, but they also remotely disabled users’ phones, rendering them virtually useless. This move was far from the expected outcome – if a device truly posed safety risks, it should have been switched off completely. Instead, Samsung allowed the devices to turn on but denied users access to their data and applications.</p>











<p><strong>Battery Voltage and Charging Safety Claims</strong></p>



<p>To justify their actions, Samsung cited battery voltage and charging safety as the reasons for disabling these devices. They claimed that these devices were approved for correct charging and safe use within Mexico, which was far from the truth. In reality, Samsung uses the same battery voltage in all regions, and they even stopped including chargers in the box, further undermining their own argument.</p>











<p><strong>Environmental Concerns and Manufacturer Greed</strong></p>



<p>Samsung’s dubious explanation is an attempt to greenwash their actions by framing them as environmentally conscious decisions. The reality, however, is that they are using these claims to extract more money from consumers. This is not about safety or the environment; it’s about profit.</p>











<p><strong>Government Response and Consumer Backlash</strong></p>



<p>The Mexican government swiftly responded to these unethical actions, siding with consumers’ rights. On October 19, the Federal Consumer Protection Agency (PROFECO) and the Federal Institute of Telecommunications (IFT) issued a suspension against manufacturers who had disabled these mobile devices, as they had violated consumer rights by blocking imported phones. Motorola and Samsung, the main culprits, had to cease their actions immediately and issued statements agreeing to cooperate with the Mexican government to find a solution.</p>











<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>



<p>This incident serves as a wake-up call for consumers and highlights the importance of protecting our digital rights. Manufacturers should not have the power to remotely disable devices that consumers have legitimately purchased. It’s a gross violation of trust, privacy, and consumer rights.</p>



<p>While some companies like Xiaomi opted for a more user-friendly approach by sending messages but not disabling devices, others like Samsung resorted to extreme measures, leaving users stranded with locked devices. This raises important questions about who controls the devices we own and how they can be used against us.</p>



<p>As consumers, it’s essential to remain vigilant, advocate for our rights, and support government agencies that stand up against unethical practices. In this case, the Mexican government’s swift response demonstrated the power of collective action in safeguarding consumer rights. Samsung and other manufacturers must be held accountable for their actions, and consumers should be cautious when dealing with companies that prioritize profit over ethical conduct.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>The index is a good predictor of whether a company will raise a round, says Konstantin Vinogradov, a general partner at Runa. Around a third of all the companies listed in the index since its <a data-offer-url="https://runacap.com/ross-index/" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://runacap.com/ross-index/&quot;}" href="https://runacap.com/ross-index/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">launch in 2020</a> have raised subsequent rounds within the next 12 months, he says.</p><p>Over time, metrics can invalidate themselves, says Stuart Geiger, an assistant professor at UC San Diego. He says two “laws” attributed to social scientists sum up why: The more a metric is used in decisionmaking, the more it will be manipulated (<a data-offer-url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campbell%27s_law" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campbell%27s_law&quot;}" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campbell%27s_law" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Campbell’s law</a>), and a metric that becomes a target ceases to be useful (<a data-offer-url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodhart%27s_law" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodhart%27s_law&quot;}" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodhart%27s_law" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Goodhart’s law</a>).</p><p>The line between smart strategy and cheating can be blurry. “If a company becomes number one on Product Hunt, they put it on their website, then maybe it will increase their conversion rate for customers,” says Vinogradov. “Is it just winning the game? Or is it a business-driven, reasonable strategy?”</p><p>Kevin Zhang, a former venture investor now building his own startup, says GitHub stars have seemed to become a target for entrepreneurs looking to impress. “I started noticing that founders were putting more star growth on their decks,” he says. “That always gives you a little bit of suspicion right? Oh, maybe it’s a little bit gamed.”</p><p>But Zhang and other investors say that while gaming a metric like stars might help a startup get a first meeting with VCs, it’s unlikely to get them a second. Investor perspectives on GitHub metrics have changed in recent years as a result of gamification and an increased understanding of the open source market, Zhang says. Good GitHub engagement is one promising signal, but it's not a bulletproof sign of success, Zhang, Vinogradov, and Aiyagari all say, with information on the founding team, market, and many other data points all considered before making an investment.</p><p>Cryptocurrency Preferred</p><p><a data-offer-url="https://baddhi.shop/shop/" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://baddhi.shop/shop/&quot;}" href="https://baddhi.shop/shop/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Baddhi Shop</a>, an online store offering inauthentic metrics, rolled out its GitHub services earlier this year. It also sells Product Hunt upvotes, as well as upvotes, followers, and views on Kaggle. When WIRED sent messages to the LinkedIn account of the site’s founder, Naga Durgarao Baddhi, responses came back claiming the business was aboveboard.</p><p>When an order comes in for GitHub stars or another metric, a team of 11 get clicking, “from different cloud devices,” Baddhi said, adding that this wasn’t spam because the shop respects each website's terms of service. GitHub is not the most popular metric-cheating offering, Baddhi added. Discord, a chat room service popular with crypto projects, gets daily purchases, and metrics for 10 other services are also popular, Baddhi says. Kellyn Slone, a spokesperson for Discord, says creating or selling fake accounts violates its terms of service, and it takes action in response, including removing users from the service.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="storywrap-423673">


<h3>from the <i>not-cool</i> dept</h3>

<p>It’s pretty much the way of the world: beyond the basic <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.techdirt.com/tag/enshittification/" target="_blank">enshittification</a> story that has been so well told over the past year or so about how companies get worse and worse as they get more and more powerful, there’s also the well known concept of successful innovative companies “pulling up the ladder” behind them, using the regulatory process to make it impossible for other companies to follow their own path to success. We’ve talked about this in the sense of <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.techdirt.com/2011/02/03/entrepreneurs-who-create-value-vs-entrepreneurs-who-lock-up-value/" target="_blank"><em>political entrepreneurship</em></a>, which is when the main entrepreneurial effort is not to innovate in newer and better products for customers, but rather using the political system for personal gain and to prevent competitors from havng the same opportunities.</p>
<p>It happens all too frequently. And it’s been happening lately with the big internet companies, which relied on the open internet to become successful, but under massive pressure from regulators (and the media), keep shooting the open internet in the back, each time they can present themselves as “supportive” of some dumb regulatory regime. Facebook did it six years ago by <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.techdirt.com/2017/11/08/will-sheryl-sandberg-facebook-help-small-websites-threatened-sesta/" target="_blank">supporting FOSTA wholeheartedly</a>, which was the key tide shift that made the law viable in Congress.</p>
<p>And, now, it appears that Google is going down that same path. There have been hints here and there, such as when it mostly <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.techdirt.com/2017/04/14/dont-wait-google-netflix-facebooks-help-if-you-want-to-save-net-neutrality/" target="_blank">gave up the fight</a> on net neutrality six years ago. However, Google had still appeared to be active in various fights to protect an open internet. </p>
<p>But, last week, Google took a big step towards pulling up the open internet ladder behind it, which got almost no coverage (and what coverage it got was misleading). And, for the life of me, I don’t understand why it chose to do this now. It’s one of the dumbest policy moves I’ve seen Google make in ages, and seems like a complete unforced error.</p>
<p>Last Monday, Google announced “<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/public-policy/google-legislation-framework-children-teens-safety/" target="_blank">a policy framework to protect children and teens online</a>,” which was echoed by subsidiary YouTube, which posted basically the same thing, talking about it’s “<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://blog.youtube/inside-youtube/youtubes-principled-approach-children-teenagers/" target="_blank">principled approach for children and teenagers</a>.” Both of these pushed not just a “principled approach” for companies to take, but <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/publicpolicy.google/en//resources/youth-legislative-framework.pdf" target="_blank">a legislative model</a> (and I hear that they’re out pushing “model bills” across legislatures as well).</p>
<p>The “legislative” model is, effectively, California’s Age Appropriate Design Code. Yes, the very law that was<a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.techdirt.com/2023/09/19/court-says-californias-age-appropriate-design-code-is-unconstitutional-just-as-we-warned/"> just declared unconstitutional</a> just a few weeks before Google basically threw its weight behind the approach. What’s funny is that many, many people have (incorrectly) believed that Google was some sort of legal mastermind behind the NetChoice lawsuits challenging California’s law and other similar laws, when the reality appears to be that Google knows full well that it can handle the requirements of the law, but smaller competitors cannot. Google likes the law. It wants more of them, apparently.</p>
<p>The model includes “age assurance” (which is effectively age verification, though everyone pretends it’s not), greater parental surveillance, and the compliance nightmare of “impact assessments” (we <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.techdirt.com/2022/08/24/dear-california-law-makers-how-the-hell-can-i-comply-with-your-new-age-appropriate-design-code/" target="_blank">talked about this nonsense</a> in relation to the California law). <strong>Again, for many companies this is a good idea</strong>. But just because something is a good idea for companies to do <em>does not mean</em> that it should be mandated by law.</p>
<p>But that’s exactly what Google is pushing for here, even as a law that more or less mimics its framework was just found to be unconstitutional. While cynical people will say that maybe Google is supporting these policies hoping that they will continue to be found unconstitutional, I see little evidence to support that. Instead, it really sounds like Google is fully onboard with these kinds of duty of care regulations that will harm smaller competitors, but which Google can handle just fine.</p>
<p>It’s pulling up the ladder behind it.</p>
<p>And yet, the press coverage of this focused on the fact that this was being presented as an “alternative” to a full on ban for kids under 18 to be on social media. The Verge <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/16/23919221/google-youtube-child-safety-age-verification-laws-privacy" target="_blank">framed this </a>as “Google asks Congress not to ban teens from social media,” leaving out that it was Google asking Congress to basically make it impossible for any site other than the largest, richest companies to be able to allow teens on social media. Same thing with TechCrunch, which framed it as Google <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/10/16/google-lobbies-against-legally-mandated-age-verification-for-minors/" target="_blank">lobbying against age verification</a>.</p>
<p>But… it’s not? It’s basically lobbying for age verification, just in the guise of “age assurance,” which is effectively “age verification, but if you’re a smaller company you can get it wrong some undefined amount of time, until someone sues you.” I mean, what’s here is not “lobbying against age verification,” it’s basically saying “here’s how to require age verification.”</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>A good understanding of user age can help online services offer age-appropriate experiences. That said, any method to determine the age of users across services comes with tradeoffs, such as intruding on privacy interests, requiring more data collection and use, or restricting adult users’ access to important information and services. Where required, age assurance – which can range from declaration to inference and verification – should be risk-based, preserving users’ access to information and services, and respecting their privacy. Where legislation mandates age assurance, it should do so through a workable, interoperable standard that preserves the potential for anonymous or pseudonymous experiences. It should avoid requiring collection or processing of additional personal information, treating all users like children, or impinging on the ability of adults to access information. More data-intrusive methods (such as verification with “hard identifiers” like government IDs) should be limited to high-risk services (e.g., alcohol, gambling, or pornography) or age correction. Moreover, age assurance requirements should permit online services to explore and adapt to improved technological approaches. In particular, requirements should enable new, privacy-protective ways to ensure users are at least the required age before engaging in certain activities. Finally, because age assurance technologies are novel, imperfect, and evolving, requirements should provide reasonable protection from liability for good-faith efforts to develop and implement improved solutions in this space.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Much like Facebook caving on FOSTA, this is Google caving on age verification and other “duty of care” approaches to regulating the way kids have access to the internet. It’s pulling up the ladder behind itself, knowing that it was able to grow without having to take these steps, and making sure that none of the up-and-coming challenges to Google’s position will have the same freedom to do so.</p>
<p>And, for what? So that Google can go to regulators and say “look, we’re not against regulations, here’s our framework”? But Google has smart policy people. They have to know how this plays out in reality. Just as with FOSTA, it completely backfired on Facebook (and the open internet). This approach will do the same.</p>
<p>Not only will these laws inevitably be used against the companies themselves, they’ll also be weaponized and modified by policymakers who will make them even worse and even more dangerous, all while pointing to Google’s “blessing” of this approach as an endorsement.</p>
<p>For years, Google had been somewhat unique in continuing to fight for the open internet long after many other companies were switching over to ladder pulling. There were hints that Google was going down this path in the past, but with this policy framework, the company has now made it clear that it has no intention of being a friend to the open internet any more.</p>

Theora's low (and now often incorrect) usage no longer justifies support for most users.

Notes:
- Zero day attacks against media codecs have spiked.
- Usage has fallen below measurable levels in UKM.
- The sites we manually inspected before levels dropped off were incorrectly preferring Theora over more modern codecs like VP9.
- It's never been supported by Safari or Chrome on Android.
- An ogv.js polyfill exists for the sites that still need Theora support.
- We are not removing support for ogg containers.

Our plan is to begin escalating experiments turning down Theora support in M120. During this time users can reactivate Theora support via chrome://flags/#theora-video-codec if needed.

The tentative timeline for this is (assuming everything goes smoothly):
- ~Oct 23, 2023: begin 50/50 canary dev experiments.
- ~Nov 1-6, 2023: begin 50/50 beta experiments.
- ~Dec 6, 2023: begin 1% stable experiments.
- ~Jan 8, 2024: begin 50% stable experiments.
- ~Jan 16th, 2024: launch at 100%.
- ~Feb 2024: remove code and chrome://flag in M123.
- ~Mar 2024: Chrome 123 will roll to stable.</p><h4>Blink component</h4><p><a href="https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/list?q=component:Internals%3EMedia%3ECodecs" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en-US&amp;q=https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/list?q%3Dcomponent:Internals%253EMedia%253ECodecs&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1698220805824000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3k0M7DYiTnjo0Pq3MO-yBO">Internals&gt;Media&gt;Codecs</a><span></span></p><h4>Search tags</h4><p><a href="https://chromestatus.com/features#tags:theora" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en-US&amp;q=https://chromestatus.com/features%23tags:theora&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1698220805824000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3AoLWgJu8RZ7v4ebtq-bwL">theora</a><span>,&nbsp;</span><a href="https://chromestatus.com/features#tags:vp3" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en-US&amp;q=https://chromestatus.com/features%23tags:vp3&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1698220805824000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0V0kpfFI4GsOcpd72BpsAB">vp3</a><span>,&nbsp;</span><a href="https://chromestatus.com/features#tags:video" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en-US&amp;q=https://chromestatus.com/features%23tags:video&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1698220805825000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2GJqSSKExSwXaeuNaTrtxa">video</a><span></span></p><h4>TAG review</h4><p><span>None</span></p><h4>TAG review status</h4><p><span>Not applicable</span></p><h4>Risks</h4><div><h4>Interoperability and Compatibility</h4><p>Sites which only provide a Theora video source will no longer have video playback.

<h3>TL;DR</h3>



<p><strong>Cascade</strong> is a RISC-V CPU fuzzer that generates <strong>valid</strong>, <strong>long</strong> and <strong>complex</strong> programs, and relies on a termination cascade-effect for bug detection. It detected 37 <strong>new</strong> bugs (29 new CVEs) in 5 RISC-V CPUs, which is more than all the existing fuzzers, combined. You can read a paper we wrote on Cascade <a href="https://comsec.ethz.ch/wp-content/files/cascade_sec24.pdf">here</a> and try it out <a href="https://github.com/comsec-group/cascade-artifacts">here</a>. Below is a video demo of it finding a bug in CVA6:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Cascade finding a bug in the CVA6 RISC-V CPU" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rz4M7uY_1NM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<h2>Motivation</h2>



<p>Fuzzing CPUs is akin to generating interesting programs, and observing expressions of buggy behaviors. An effective CPU fuzzing campaign must have some fundamental properties.</p>



<ul>
<li>Programs must be long to increase fuzzing throughput.</li>



<li>Programs must be complex to increase the probability of triggering a bug.</li>



<li>The fuzzer must reliably and efficiently detect bugs, once triggered.</li>
</ul>



<h2>Pitfalls of existing fuzzers</h2>



<p>Existing CPU fuzzers do not comply with these fundamental properties. Fuzzers may have the following shortcomings:</p>



<ul>
<li>Programs are short by design with trivial control flows.</li>



<li>The executed portion of the programs are short because the control flow is poorly managed.</li>



<li>Most instructions are not randomized and correspond to initialization and finalization.</li>



<li>Only a small part of the ISA is covered.</li>



<li>The CPU state is checked at instruction granularity, significantly impacting the fuzzing performance.</li>



<li>Bugs have a high chance of being shadowed because their expression is eventually overwritten in the control flow.</li>
</ul>



<p>Ultimately, a fuzzer with such pitfalls will suffer from critical weaknesses which will likely make fuzzing campaigns ineffective or inefficient.</p>







<p>Cascade is a RISC-V CPU fuzzer that generates valid, long and complex programs, and relies on a cascade-effect termination for bug detection. Fuzzing proceeds as follows:</p>



<ul>
<li>Intermediate program construction: First, Cascade builds an intermediate program with complex data and control flows, the latter being independent of the former.</li>



<li>Ultimate program construction: Cascade simulates the program using a golden model of the ISA to collect feedback about the behavior of the data flow. From this feedback, it entangles the data flow into the control flow to build the ultimate version of the program.</li>



<li>Ultimate program execution: Cascade executes the program on the CPU under test. Non-terminations indicate that a bug has been triggered by a program.</li>
</ul>



<p>Below you can see a design diagram of Cascade:</p>

<h2>Bug detection</h2>



<p>A common but unsatisfying way of detecting whether a bug has been triggered is to compare, instruction by instruction, whether the CPU state matches with the golden model state. This method is difficult to implement and expensive in terms of performance.</p>



<p>In Cascade-generated programs, due to the entanglement of data and control flow, a bug in the data flow will have a very high chance of altering the control flow, causing non-termination.</p>



<h2>Asynchronous ISA pre-simulation</h2>



<p>To transform an intermediate program into an ultimate program, i.e., to entangle the data flow into the control flow, Cascade uses the feedback from spike, a golden model of the RISC-V ISA to determine some <em>dependent</em> register values generated by critical points in the program. Knowing these values allows correcting them at a later point of the program to achieve the same control-flow and exceptional behavior as in the intermediate program, while entangling the data flow into the control flow. While there may be many dependent values and control-flow changes in a program, we show that a single careful execution of the ISA golden model suffices to entangle the data flow into the control flow at all points of the program.</p>



<h2>Reduction of buggy programs</h2>



<p>Cascade found tens of new bugs, but the programs that trigger them are long and complex. Cascade features a new mechanism that reduces bug-triggering programs into very few instructions, while preserving the bug-preserving behavior. Here is the Cascade’s bug reduction mechanism in action:</p>

</p></figure>



<h2>Discovered vulnerabilities</h2>



<p>Cascade found 37 new bugs (29 new CVEs) in 5 RISC-V CPUs. We reported them to their respective maintainers and fixed some of them ourselves. The discovered bugs have many security implications, ranging from information leakage to denial of service from user mode by a specific operation executed under speculation. Please look at the <a href="https://comsec.ethz.ch/wp-content/files/cascade_sec24.pdf">paper</a> if you want to know more about the bugs. The figure below summarizes the security impact of these bugs:</p>

<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>



<p><strong>Cascade found many bugs. Is RISC-V insecure?<br></strong>Given today’s highly manual RTL design flows, the appearance of bugs is very likely, regardless of the ISA. Note that more than 1000 errata were released in Intel Core and AMD CPUs in recent years (see <a href="https://comsec.ethz.ch/research/hardware-design-security/rememberr/">RemembERR</a>). Hence, from Cascade’s findings, there is no reason to consider RISC-V to be inherently less secure than other ISAs.</p>



<p><strong>I am a consumer, should I worry that Cascade finds bugs in my CPU?</strong><br>At the time of this writing, RISC-V CPUs in commodity computers are rather uncommon. Hence, Cascade will hopefully find the bugs before a CPU is mass-produced.</p>



<p><strong>Is Cascade only for RISC-V?</strong><br>Yes. While some ideas like AIPS can be ported to other mainstream ISAs, Cascade is at the moment implemented only for RISC-V.</p>



<p><strong>Can I use Cascade in CI/CD?</strong><br>Yes! On a reasonable server, Cascade finds many bugs in a matter of seconds, hence it is perfectly suited for quick checks as well as long runs.</p>



<p><strong>After fixing all the reported bugs, my CPU is now validated by Cascade. Is my CPU now perfectly safe and functional?</strong><br>No, Cascade does not offer formal guarantees. You may want to turn to formal methods for such guarantees, but they require more expertise and effort.</p>



<p><strong>What RISC-V extensions are currently being fuzzed by Cascade?<br></strong>Cascade fuzzes rv[32-64]imfd, including exceptions, MSU privilege transitions and many CSR interactions. We plan to add new fuzzing features such as memory virtualization and compressed instructions in the future. Feel free to contribute?</p>



<p><strong>How can I contribute to Cascade?</strong><br>Just open a pull request on <a href="https://github.com/comsec-group/cascade-artifacts">github</a> and we will have a look.</p>

  <p>By <a href="https://github.com/ocdtrekkie">Jacob Weisz</a>
    
    - 23 Oct 2023
  </p><p>Over the last couple of months, we have had a lot of people asking for an update on
the project. We’ve had to take a bit of time for self-care before putting together
our plans going forward, culminating in this update.</p>

<p><em>Note: Astute observers may notice this blog is on a new domain, sandstorm.org,
along with subtle changes to this version of the website. We will discuss why and
how this will impact our plans next week.</em></p>

<h2 id="remembering-ian-denhardt">Remembering Ian Denhardt</h2>

<p>As people closely following the project may already be aware, about three months
ago one of our core project contributors, <a href="https://github.com/zenhack">Ian Denhardt</a>, sadly and unexpectedly
passed away. It is impossible to overstate the significance of Ian’s contributions
to this project, from maintaining and fixing bugs in Sandstorm itself, to packaging,
re-packaging, and building a number of apps and tools, to starting a next-generation
platform for Sandstorm (more on this below). Ian has ultimately been the <em>primary</em>
contributor to our ecosystem as a whole for the past three years.</p>

<p>Ian was an incredibly gifted developer whose projects spanned from calendaring apps
and backup tools to operating system kernels and programming languages. But far more
than that, Ian was an incredibly humble and kind mentor and friend. Countless times
he helped me with problems that came down to something close to “How do I navigate a
Linux machine” without a hint of irritation. Steve Pomeroy <a href="https://staticfree.info/ian/">shared a story</a> about
Ian recently that exemplified the sort of thought and <em>care</em> that he put into
everything that he did.</p>

<p>We intend to honor Ian’s memory and vision by carrying forward his work and ensuring
that we continue to make self-hosting viable for everyone.</p>

<h2 id="introducing-tempest">Introducing Tempest</h2>

<p>Since late last year, Ian had been working heavily on an experimental alternative
software to run Sandstorm apps that we refer to as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230728221625/https://zenhack.net/2023/01/06/introducing-tempest.html">Tempest</a>. Tempest is a modern
take on the Sandstorm platform, supporting existing apps but dropping various
long-disused compatibility shims and embracing modern technologies and expectations.
It is written in Go, which is significantly more accessible to volunteer development
than Meteor and C++. Another key feature is the use of WASM to allow the client side
of the platform to also be written in Go and run Cap’n Proto directly in the browser.</p>

<p>Whereas Sandstorm was built with organization or SaaS provider scale as a focus,
Tempest development was planned with individual or small community use at the
forefront. One of the major goals Ian had intended to strive for with Tempest was the
ability to communicate with decentralized communication networks like ActivityPub and
Matrix, which has proven challenging for Sandstorm thus far.</p>

<p>As of this post, Tempest can run many Sandstorm apps and can import grains directly
from a Sandstorm install. However, it is still far from being a production-usable
application, and a lot of important API features for apps like external network access
and web publishing are not implemented.</p>

<p>Multiple community members have stepped forward in the past two months to let us know
that they would like to continue development of Tempest including Troy Farrell and Dan
Krol. We plan to bring the <a href="https://github.com/troyjfarrell/tempest">current work</a> on the project under the Sandstorm
organization to coordinate that effort. If you are interested in contributing, please
reach out on the project repository or the Sandstorm <a href="https://groups.google.com/g/sandstorm-dev">mailing list</a>.</p>

<h2 id="current-challenges-with-sandstorm">Current Challenges with Sandstorm</h2>

<p>While Tempest has been exciting as a potential leap forward, everyone using Sandstorm
today is still using “Sandstorm classic”. Sandstorm development has moved more slowly,
but it has not stood still. Several security improvements have been added in the past
couple of years, including improved sandboxing both on the server and client side and
a number of small but impactful UI improvements. Last month, Sandstorm’s 308th release
included Ian’s final contribution as well as additional localization work that Troy
contributed.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, as we hope to continue to support Sandstorm long-term, we’ve had an
increasingly challenging problem with the legacy MongoDB database underneath, as Meteor
has dropped support for the version we use. Ensuring a seamless migration on end-user
servers has proven to be a challenging problem. Dependency upgrades are not fun and
this has become a fairly unpleasant project to undertake for unpaid open source
contributors.</p>

<h2 id="moving-forward">Moving Forward</h2>

<p>Over the past few weeks, we have spoken to a number of potential outside parties about
taking on this project and building a migration so that we can update the databases of
existing Sandstorm servers and allow us to continue moving forward. We believe this is
the best way to ensure that Sandstorm servers continue to be the safest way to
self-host. The cost estimates we’ve discussed for the current Sandstorm aren’t
unreasonable, but they are significant.</p>

<p>We are looking to raise the funding for this project through our <a href="https://opencollective.com/sandstormcommunity">OpenCollective</a>.
If you are using Sandstorm, especially at an organization level, and can help ensure
that we are able to provide long-term support, please donate to the project. If you
believe that you or your organization may be willing to fund this effort in large part
or its entirety and would like additional details about the amount we would need to fund
this, please <a href="https://sandstorm.org/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#1d74737f72655d777c7e727f6a78746e67337e7270">contact me directly</a>.</p>

<p>Sandstorm is approaching it’s tenth birthday, and there’s still nothing else like it.
Capability-based security and a tireless focus on abstracting away complexity from the
user continue to make it the only platform which holds hope of letting <em>everyone</em>, not
just developers and IT professionals, self-host. Thank you for your continuing interest
and support.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div dir="auto"><p><span>Aviation is a poster child for economic stagnation. Yes, airline travel has gotten cheaper and safer—great. But every other aspect of aviation has struggled or even regressed. As I’ve </span><a href="https://www.elidourado.com/p/50-years-supersonic-ban" rel="">noted many times</a><span>, we </span><em>had</em><span> supersonic travel across the Atlantic from 1976 to 2003. Today, not even the world’s richest travelers can fly that fast.</span></p><p><span>Another part of aviation that has suffered over the last half-century is general aviation, particularly its low-end segment, personal aviation, in which people fly themselves to their destinations instead of hiring a private pilot to do it. Aviation is simply not practical personal transportation today. Where, one might ask, </span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Where-Flying-Car-Storrs-Hall/dp/1953953182/" rel="">is my flying car</a><span>?</span></p><p><span>Lately I have become obsessed with the Federal Aviation Administration’s new </span><a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2023/07/24/2023-14425/modernization-of-special-airworthiness-certification" rel="">MOSAIC rulemaking</a><span> on light-sport aircraft. The agency’s proposed rule is smart, counterintuitive, and potentially transformative. If not literal flying cars, it could make personal aviation in general much more viable. It’s an action that deserves both applause and careful study.</span></p><p><span>FAA is primarily a safety regulator. In 1996, in order to address perceived conflicts of interest after a handful of airliner crashes, Congress </span><a href="https://www.congress.gov/104/plaws/publ264/PLAW-104publ264.pdf#page=43" rel="">removed</a><span> the agency’s authorization to promote the development of civil aviation, saying that safety was the highest priority. FAA takes its safety mandate very seriously. Importantly, consistent with Congressional direction, it doesn’t apply the same safety standards to all activities, but instead </span><a href="https://downloads.regulations.gov/FAA-2015-1621-0018/attachment_1.pdf" rel="">explicitly adopts</a><span> a “safety continuum,” which is worth reviewing before we get to the content of the MOSAIC rule.</span></p><p>The safest form of aviation is on type-certified Part 25 airliners flying on Part 121 airlines by highly trained, licensed commercial airline pilots. The explicit safety target that FAA and other regulators have settled on is that catastrophic events should be “extremely improbable,” meaning one per billion flight-hours. The regulation of this kind of aviation is nothing short of maniacal. Consequently, it can cost billions of dollars to develop a Part 25 airliner through type certification.</p><p><span>Next along the safety continuum come type-certified Part 23 aircraft. These include most general aviation aircraft, and they can be up to 19,000 pounds of maximum takeoff weight and include seating for up to 19 passengers, although many of them are small four-seaters. To fly a Part 23 aircraft, you must have a private or recreational pilot’s license. In 2017, FAA modernized the Part 23 rules to be less prescriptive, allowing the use of consensus standards (most commonly, </span><a href="https://www.astm.org/" rel="">ASTM</a><span>’s).</span></p><p>The third spot on the continuum are light-sport aircraft (LSAs). This was a category FAA created in 2004 to fill a spot on the safety continuum between Part 23 aircraft and experimental amateur-built aircraft. No type certification is required, but the aircraft must still be built according to consensus standards. Under today’s rules, LSAs are subject to a number of restrictions to limit the size of the category: maximum speed is 120 knots, maximum weight is 1,320 pounds, the aircraft can only have 2 seats, and it can be powered only by one engine, which must be reciprocating. If you only want to fly LSAs, you don’t need a full private pilot’s license. FAA created a sport pilot certificate that can qualify you to fly an LSA with half the flight training.</p><p>Next along the safety continuum come experimental aircraft. This is America. You can build any aircraft you like, and if you can build it, you can fly it, subject to rules designed to limit the risk to the rest of the airspace and people on the ground. You can also buy a kit aircraft from a manufacturer and build it yourself. These aircraft are not only not type certified, they are not necessarily built according to any particular standards. You must be at least a private pilot to fly an experimental aircraft.</p><p>Rounding out the unsafe end of the safety continuum come ultralights. It turns out that FAA is perfectly willing to let you kill yourself in a flying vehicle as long as that vehicle weighs less than 254 pounds and can’t exceed 55 knots, and you do it in the daytime and in an unpopulated area. You need zero pilot training, the aircraft doesn’t have to be registered, and it doesn’t have to be built according to any particular standards.</p><p><span>The safety continuum makes sense. US airlines carry hundreds of millions of paying passengers per year. Those passengers have high safety expectations, particularly because some of them feel out of control on an airliner in a way that they don’t in a car they’re driving or riding in.</span></p><p><span> The airline business doesn’t work without a high safety bar. Furthermore, flying big vehicles poses a bigger risk to people on the ground, who are more likely to be harmed by a crash. It is worth reducing that externality through policy measures to ensure safety.</span></p><p>At the other end of the safety continuum, there are some pretty big benefits to allowing experimentation. The system of permissionless innovation under which the Wright brothers worked is directly responsible for us having aviation at all. We made rapid progress in the early days of aviation by sacrificing a lot of test pilots. Even today, new aviation technology often starts out in the experimental and light-sport world and works its way up to airliners over time as safety regulators figure out how to certify it as safe. Composite materials are one example—they were used in experimental aircraft for decades before the 787 became the first majority-composite airliner.</p><p>Another benefit of the safety continuum is that it provides an onramp for aviation engineering. Let’s say you were starting a company to build airliners. You could have trouble finding engineers with Part 25 experience—you might have to hire them away from Boeing or Airbus. But fortunately, it’s relatively easy to find engineers who have built experimental or Part 23 aircraft before. The Part 25 rules are more strict, but the basic principles of aviation engineering are the same no matter the size of the plane. If the lower end of the continuum were not there, Part 25 development would suffer.</p><p><span>For contrast, consider nuclear regulation. Although NRC is currently </span><a href="https://www.nrc.gov/reactors/new-reactors/advanced/rulemaking-and-guidance/part-53.html" rel="">doing a supposedly risk-informed rulemaking</a><span> for advanced reactors, it doesn’t really operate according to a safety continuum. Texas A&amp;M has an </span><a href="https://engineering.tamu.edu/nuclear/research/facilities/agn-201m-nuclear-reactor-laboratory.html" rel="">on-campus reactor</a><span> that produces </span><em>5 watts</em><span> of thermal energy—similar to a </span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=chemical+hand+warmers" rel="">chemical hand-warmer</a><span>—and that reactor is nevertheless licensed as a utilization facility under the same framework used for all research and energy-producing reactors. This heavy regulation means that few new reactors are being built, which in turn means that if you are starting a new nuclear company, you’re going to have mostly engineers who have never built a nuclear reactor of any kind before. This lack of space for experimentation, as I </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hata-Z6G8lE" rel="">discussed</a><span> with Last Energy CEO Bret Kugelmass recently, is one reason for stagnation in the nuclear industry.</span></p><p>There are two ways—one relatively obvious, one counterintuitive—that less stringent safety rules along the safety continuum can make us more safe over time.</p><p>Let’s start with the obvious one. If the compliance costs of safety regulation get too high, it will shut down iteration and innovation in the industry. These innovations include safety enhancements. After all, pilots and passengers generally want, other things equal, to be safe, so an unfettered free market will deliver cost-effective safety-improving innovations over time. It’s possible by some lights that the market will not produce the optimal amount of safety at all relevant margins, and so regulation persists. Yet everyone should recognize that there is such a thing as overregulation.</p><p><span>FAA </span><em>does</em><span> recognize this. The graphic below comes from a </span><a href="https://downloads.regulations.gov/FAA-2015-1621-0018/attachment_1.pdf" rel="">document</a><span> in which they explain the safety continuum doctrine. “If certifcation [sic] requirements and oversight are overly stringent,” they write, “safety can be jeopardized because the burden of certification will prevent the adoption of safety enhancing technologies.” It’s hard to get more clear than that.</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7ff7cdf8-e8c9-4822-8b1e-aabb0947934a_988x653.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7ff7cdf8-e8c9-4822-8b1e-aabb0947934a_988x653.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7ff7cdf8-e8c9-4822-8b1e-aabb0947934a_988x653.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7ff7cdf8-e8c9-4822-8b1e-aabb0947934a_988x653.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7ff7cdf8-e8c9-4822-8b1e-aabb0947934a_988x653.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7ff7cdf8-e8c9-4822-8b1e-aabb0947934a_988x653.png" width="988" height="653" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/7ff7cdf8-e8c9-4822-8b1e-aabb0947934a_988x653.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:653,&quot;width&quot;:988,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7ff7cdf8-e8c9-4822-8b1e-aabb0947934a_988x653.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7ff7cdf8-e8c9-4822-8b1e-aabb0947934a_988x653.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7ff7cdf8-e8c9-4822-8b1e-aabb0947934a_988x653.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7ff7cdf8-e8c9-4822-8b1e-aabb0947934a_988x653.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>There is second way that less rigorous safety standards can improve safety, one that is more paradoxical or at least counterintuitive. FAA can adjust the boundaries of the different points on the safety continuum. If through deregulation it can increase the attractiveness of being in a safer part of the continuum, it can increase overall system safety while in a static sense only decreasing safety standards.</p><p><span>Amazingly, FAA </span><a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/d/2023-14425/p-83" rel="">explicitly recognizes this</a><span> too, and is now through the MOSAIC rulemaking expanding the light-sport category in a deregulatory manner to induce pilots to upgrade their spot on the safety continuum from experimental to light-sport.</span></p><blockquote><p>Since the 2004 rule, light-sport category aircraft have shown a lower accident rate than experimental amateur-built airplanes. The FAA considers that the successful safety record of light-sport category aircraft validates certification requirements established in the 2004 final rule and provides support for expanding the scope of certification for light-sport category aircraft and operations. As a result, the FAA identified this proposed rule as an opportunity to expand the 2004 final rule to include a wider variety of aircraft, increase performance, and increase operating privileges to extend these safety benefits to more aircraft. The FAA intends for these expansions to increase safety by encouraging aircraft owners, who may be deciding between an experimental aircraft or a light-sport category aircraft, to choose aircraft higher on the safety continuum and, therefore, meet higher aircraft certification requirements.</p></blockquote><p>The data they are referring to are below. The y-axis measures the number of fatal accidents per 100,000 flight-hours. TC/Personal refers to Part 23 (type certified) aircraft used for non-commercial personal purposes. EAB is experimental amateur-built, and SLSA stands for special light-sport aircraft. These kinds of aircraft are all used by similar people and for similar purposes. The SLSA data is more volatile because of a low number of flight-hours compared to the other categories, but in most years, experimental aircraft are about twice as deadly as light-sport aircraft.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc1c5ee86-7852-42f2-82d2-ff580ee34854_789x553.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc1c5ee86-7852-42f2-82d2-ff580ee34854_789x553.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc1c5ee86-7852-42f2-82d2-ff580ee34854_789x553.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc1c5ee86-7852-42f2-82d2-ff580ee34854_789x553.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc1c5ee86-7852-42f2-82d2-ff580ee34854_789x553.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc1c5ee86-7852-42f2-82d2-ff580ee34854_789x553.png" width="789" height="553" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/c1c5ee86-7852-42f2-82d2-ff580ee34854_789x553.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:553,&quot;width&quot;:789,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc1c5ee86-7852-42f2-82d2-ff580ee34854_789x553.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc1c5ee86-7852-42f2-82d2-ff580ee34854_789x553.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc1c5ee86-7852-42f2-82d2-ff580ee34854_789x553.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc1c5ee86-7852-42f2-82d2-ff580ee34854_789x553.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>There are about 6 times as many EAB flight-hours as SLSA flight-hours, so if we move a large chunk of the EAB activity to SLSA, it could result in a net reduction in aviation fatalities, holding total flight-hours constant. To induce people to upgrade their spot on the safety continuum from experimental to light-sport, FAA needs to make the light-sport category more attractive, and boy are they delivering on that.</p><p><span>Modernization of Special Airworthiness Certification (MOSAIC) is the name of the </span><a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2023/07/24/2023-14425/modernization-of-special-airworthiness-certification" rel="">new rulemaking</a><span> initiative from FAA to expand the definition of light-sport aircraft. As discussed above, the explicit goal here is to make the new category so attractive that many recreational pilots switch from more dangerous experimental amateur-built aircraft to light-sport aircraft that are designed according to consensus standards. The changes are sweeping. Let’s walk through the relevant sections of the NPRM to see how FAA is expanding the category.</span></p><p><span>Under current rules, light-sport aircraft explicitly exclude helicopters and powered-lift aircraft (e.g., tilt-rotors and eVTOL aircraft). MOSAIC </span><a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2023/07/24/2023-14425/modernization-of-special-airworthiness-certification#h-41" rel="">proposes</a><span> to allow </span><em>any</em><span> kind of aircraft to be considered a light-sport aircraft if it meets the other criteria. This means we could see helicopters and eVTOLs come to market under light-sport rules—designed under consensus standards and not type certified.</span></p><p>It doesn’t mean that sport pilots would be allowed to fly all of these new light-sport aircraft. MOSAIC is decoupling the definition of light-sport aircraft from sport pilot privileges (that is, sport pilots cannot necessarily fly all light-sport aircraft by default). By doing this decoupling, FAA can be aggressive in deregulating the vehicles (not requiring them to be type certified) while being more cautious about expanding the privileges of pilots. Sport pilots can expand their privileges through additional ratings, although a rating does not necessarily exist for every aircraft considered an LSA.</p><p>To fly light-sport helicopters, sport pilots would have to get a helicopter rating, which they could only get for a helicopter that has simplified flight controls, about which more below. No rating would initially exist for light-sport powered-lift aircraft. FAA says this area is rapidly developing, and it expects that future rulemakings could expand privileges to cover these aircraft. This means that a two-seat eVTOL aircraft could come to market as an LSA, but you’d still need to have a private pilot’s license to fly one initially.</p><p><span>MOSAIC would allow light-sport aircraft to not be so light. Current rules limit LSAs’ maximum takeoff weight to 1,320 pounds, except for seaplanes, which get to be up to 1,430 pounds. Under the new rule, FAA is </span><a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2023/07/24/2023-14425/modernization-of-special-airworthiness-certification#h-42" rel="">scrapping</a><span> the weight requirement entirely. The agency notes that other requirements like maximum stall speed implicitly limit the weight of aircraft, so perhaps LSAs will top out at around 3,000 pounds.</span></p><p>From a safety perspective, they also argue that a weight limit is counterproductive. It discourages a more robust airframe design. It results in more jostling during turbulence, which could increase pilot workload. And it could preclude the installation of additional safety equipment like ballistic recovery systems. Under MOSAIC, then, LSAs will be able to about double in size and be safer as a consequence.</p><p><span>Another </span><a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2023/07/24/2023-14425/modernization-of-special-airworthiness-certification#h-43" rel="">big change</a><span> is to maximum cruise speed. Current light-sport rules limit LSAs to 120 knots. The MOSAIC NPRM notes that even </span><em>student</em><span> pilots, who are less experienced than sport pilots, are allowed to go faster than that. Furthermore, there is no evidence that there is a safety benefit from such a low speed limitation. “FAA has not noted any definitive data that links cruise speed as a contributing factor in accidents involving light-sport category aircraft.” Consequently, FAA is </span><em>more than doubling</em><span> the LSA speed limit to 250 knots.</span></p><p><span>Relatedly, current LSA rules require aircraft to have fixed landing gear. With the speed limit more than doubling, that no longer makes sense as it would wildly increase drag at cruising speeds. Under MOSAIC, FAA </span><a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2023/07/24/2023-14425/modernization-of-special-airworthiness-certification#h-49" rel="">will allow</a><span> LSAs to have retractable landing gear. It doesn’t link that change to higher speeds, but I think it’s only logical that if you are allowing 250 knots you have to allow retractable gear. Sport pilots would require an additional rating to operate retractable landing gear, since it’s important to remember to extend the landing gear before you land.</span></p><p><span>The other speed limit that is relevant is the clean stall speed. Under today’s rules, LSAs must have a stall speed of no more than 45 knots. MOSAIC </span><a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2023/07/24/2023-14425/modernization-of-special-airworthiness-certification#h-44" rel="">proposes to raise</a><span> this limit to 54 knots for airplanes only. Stall speed is relevant because it affects the speed at which an aircraft comes in for a landing. Since kinetic energy increases with velocity squared, this is a parameter that affects the amount of energy involved in a landing accident. FAA says that since the creation of LSAs in 2004, there have been 501 landing accidents involving an LSA, and only 7 of them were fatal. Consequently, there is room to go up from 45 knots.</span></p><p><span>While an increase to 54 knots is welcome, this is one of the few parameters in the MOSAIC rule that could generate some objection from stakeholders, who will want it to be higher still. If it were increased to the low 60s knots, the category could include planes like the forthcoming </span><a href="https://www.pipistrel-aircraft.com/products/panthera/" rel="">Pipistrel Panthera</a><span>.</span></p><p><span>Another instance of decoupling of sport pilot privileges and aircraft specifications is passenger capacity. Today’s light-sport rules limit everything to two seats (the pilot plus one passenger). MOSAIC </span><a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2023/07/24/2023-14425/modernization-of-special-airworthiness-certification#h-45" rel="">would allow</a><span> airplanes (but not other kinds of LSAs) to be manufactured with up to four seats. Sport pilots would still be limited to transporting one passenger. This is consistent with FAA taking aim at four-seat experimental airplanes flown by non-sport private pilots, trying to make it attractive for private pilots to “upgrade” their spot on the safety continuum to a standards-based aircraft. Undoubtedly, a lot of sport pilots will comment on this change, asking to be allowed to also carry additional passengers rather than flying with empty seats.</span></p><p><span>Under today’s light-sport rules, LSAs are limited to a single reciprocating (piston) engine. What this has meant in practice is that turboprops are not allowed. MOSAIC </span><a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2023/07/24/2023-14425/modernization-of-special-airworthiness-certification#h-46" rel="">eliminates this limitation</a><span>, prescribing no limit on the number or type of powerplant on the aircraft. FAA justifies this elimination by noting that modern turbines are simpler to operate than piston engines because of fancier firmware on the turbines.</span></p><p><span>While a turboprop LSA sounds awesome (a mini </span><a href="https://www.pilatus-aircraft.com/en/fly/pc-12" rel="">PC-12</a><span>, anyone?), this change allows far more than turboprops. A big movement in the eVTOL space is distributed electric propulsion. While batteries aren’t good enough to yield good range yet, there are a lot of advantages to electric motors—simplicity, fast spin-up, reliability. Distributed propulsion also yields redundancy and noise reduction.</span></p><p>Without a limitation on propulsion technology, there is no rule stopping a manufacturer from using a turbogenerator and using it to power a slew of electric motors. It’s up to the market to figure out whether something like this would be practical, but FAA rules won’t stand in the way.</p><p><span>This is the part where my jaw hit the floor. MOSAIC </span><a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2023/07/24/2023-14425/modernization-of-special-airworthiness-certification#h-70" rel="">makes specific provision</a><span> for “simplified flight controls.” In today’s airplanes, pilots have direct control of flight surfaces and available power. Imagine if instead of moving flaps and rudders you could just tell the airplane to turn left. You could fly it like in an arcade game. The aircraft would be responsible for keeping itself in a safe flight envelope, and it would take suggestions from the pilot as to what to do.</span></p><p>FAA is non-prescriptive about what simplified flight controls could look like. The requirements if manufacturers want to opt into simplified flight controls are that:</p><ol><li><p>The pilot cannot directly control flight surfaces or engine power.</p></li><li><p>The aircraft is designed to prevent loss of control regardless of pilot input.</p></li><li><p>The pilot has a means to discontinue the flight safely and quickly (triggering an emergency landing, return to starting point, course change, or a holding pattern).</p></li></ol><p>These flight controls could range from arcade-style controls to full self-piloting. Because these simplified controls would vary from model to model, FAA is proposing a model-specific endorsement for pilots who wish to fly any aircraft with simplified flight controls.</p><p>After World War II, expectations for general aviation were sky high. The war had driven significant advancements in aeronautics, navigation, and communication technologies. There were a large number of military surplus planes and a lot of trained pilots returning from the war. For someone alive in 1945, who had perhaps witnessed the social transformation wrought by the automobile, it would seem only natural that general aviation would be the next step in personal transportation.</p><p>Of course, it didn’t play out that way. The government significantly tightened certification requirements for general aviation in 1945 and 1965. With the market flooded with cheap, surplus military aircraft, it was hard for manufacturers to make money investing in new, more advanced models. And, of course, piloting an airplane using conventional flight controls is not as simple as driving a car, requiring significantly more skill, with lapses in attention more catastrophic.</p><p>If general aviation is to make a comeback, something like the MOSAIC rule is a prerequisite. By making a category of aircraft that doesn’t require type certification, is actually useful for transportation (250 knots and 4 seats), and can be flown with less skill via simplified flight controls, FAA is opening the door to a bigger market and vastly more innovation.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0fc98480-3455-4e26-a688-215c846df9a5_889x500.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0fc98480-3455-4e26-a688-215c846df9a5_889x500.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0fc98480-3455-4e26-a688-215c846df9a5_889x500.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0fc98480-3455-4e26-a688-215c846df9a5_889x500.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0fc98480-3455-4e26-a688-215c846df9a5_889x500.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0fc98480-3455-4e26-a688-215c846df9a5_889x500.png" width="889" height="500" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/0fc98480-3455-4e26-a688-215c846df9a5_889x500.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:500,&quot;width&quot;:889,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0fc98480-3455-4e26-a688-215c846df9a5_889x500.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0fc98480-3455-4e26-a688-215c846df9a5_889x500.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0fc98480-3455-4e26-a688-215c846df9a5_889x500.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0fc98480-3455-4e26-a688-215c846df9a5_889x500.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>Without the need for type certification, manufacturers can iterate on their designs more rapidly without going through the costly supplemental type certification process. They can include cheaper uncertified avionics. They can do over-the-air software updates.</p><p>Meanwhile, simplified flight controls and making LSAs actually useful could greatly increase demand for these aircraft as transportation. That increased demand feeds directly into manufacturing investment and the pace of iteration. The more progress there is in making these small planes really great, the more the demand for them will increase, creating a flywheel effect.</p><p>If we can get LSAs into mass manufacturing, production costs of the airframe could go down further. Mass manufactured items tend toward the cost of inputs. Aviation manufacturing entails more burdensome supply chain integrity requirements than other industries, so LSAs will likely never get as cheap as a Toyota Camry despite having similar mass, but it could be a smaller multiple of the cost.</p><p>In the near term, I’d love to see a MOSAIC aircraft that had the following:</p><ul><li><p>4 seats</p></li><li><p>200+ knot cruise speed</p></li><li><p>Distributed electric propulsion (maybe vectorable) powered by a turbogenerator and small battery for buffer and reserves</p></li><li><p>1000 nmi range</p></li><li><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STOL" rel="">STOL</a><span> capability to maximize versatility. DEP helps with this, and you have to have low stall speed anyway</span></p></li><li><p>Ultra-simplified controls including autopilot and autoland</p></li><li><p>Starlink on board for passenger connectivity, over-the-air avionics updates, and maintenance monitoring</p></li><li><p><span>Weight-saving and performance-improving technologies like </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avionics_Full-Duplex_Switched_Ethernet" rel="">ethernet-based addressing of actuators</a><span> instead of more traditional fly-by-wire</span></p></li><li><p>Active turbulence reduction</p></li><li><p>A ballistic recovery system</p></li></ul><p>This is the kind of aircraft that could draw people into flying, kicking off the flywheel of innovation and making personal aviation relevant again.</p><p>One reason I wrote this post is because I wanted to publicly praise FAA for such an innovative and thoughtful action. FAA’s longstanding safety continuum philosophy makes eminent sense, and with MOSAIC they are applying it with rigor and insight. This rulemaking will indeed, over time, make general aviation safer, both by increasing safety innovation and by inducing experimental pilots to upgrade their spot on the safety continuum. This is the public sector operating at its finest.</p><p>Although I have nothing but applause for the civil servants behind the MOSAIC rule, the policy change also makes a darker point about the history of general aviation in the United States. There’s nothing magical about the current moment that makes it the right time to expand the class of aircraft that don’t need to be certified. If it is the right policy now, and it is, then it was likely the right policy decades ago. If we had never introduced type certification into four-seat aircraft, we could be in much better shape today. Our present stagnation in general aviation is a direct result of 70 years of the wrong policy choices being made by FAA and its predecessors. There are many other areas, both within aviation and in the economy overall, where we are similarly making the wrong policy choices. If we want both safety and prosperity, we need to root them out.</p><p>The comment period for the MOSAIC rulemaking closes on January 22, 2024. It will take several months after comments close for the rule to be finalized and take effect. When it does, we’re going to have to throw a big party.</p></div></article></div></div>]]></description>

				<p>Helllloooo so it’s been a minute! And… for good reason.</p>
<p>I have a workflow that somewhat works well for me in which I write my blog posts in <a href="https://obsidian.md/">Obsidian</a> (with a template that helps me add tags and a description and stuff), and then when I want to post them, I copy and paste the post into the repository here, and then if I have images, I add the images to the repo, and then check all of the paths for it, and then ship it.</p>
<p>It works well, BUT there’s just enough overhead that sometimes I don’t write a post because there’s a few too many steps. I have a few partially-written posts that I haven’t published yet, because I keep thinking about the things getting in my way post-writing. I thought it would be nice to have a web interface for easily publishing blog posts here!</p>
<p>I wasn’t sure what CMS I’d use, because so many of them require quite a bit of setup, or they have more of a GUI interface rather than a markdown-oriented one. But, then I saw <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2023/09/smashing-magazine-tinacms-manage-editorial-workflow/">this blog post about how Smashing Magazine uses TinaCMS</a> and it looked like the perfect solution for me! I love the idea of being able to have everything be Git-based, markdown-based, and very lightweight. I was able to configure <a href="https://tina.io/">Tina</a> pretty quickly (I <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/cassidoo">streamed</a> it and luckily a core team member was in the chat and able to help me a bit when I was misunderstanding things) and it didn’t mess up my existing codebase in any way!</p>
<p>A few weeks ago I spoke at <a href="https://cfe.dev/events/codeword-conf-2023/">CodeWord Conf</a>, and something that Chris Coyier said in his segment stuck with me when he talked about his consistency: the fact that he can just type into a CMS and hit send, with minimal things getting in his way, has kept him more consistent in his writing. I do prefer Markdown and my usual local-first workflow, but the fact that I could spit out a blog quickly without any sort of copying and pasting or editing is something I’m excited to try.</p>
<p>This is the first post I’ve written and published with TinaCMS, and we’ll see how I like it over time!</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="storywrap-423274">


<h3>from the <i>do-not-pass-go,-do-not-collect-$200</i> dept</h3>

<p>Cleveland has spent years being dubbed the “<a href="https://www.cleveland.com/news/2020/09/cleveland-ranks-as-worst-connected-large-city-for-internet-in-2019.html" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.cleveland.com/news/2020/09/cleveland-ranks-as-worst-connected-large-city-for-internet-in-2019.html">worst connected city in the U.S.</a>” thanks to expensive, patchy, and slow broadband. Why Cleveland broadband sucks so badly isn’t really a mystery: consolidated monopoly/duopoly power has resulted in a broken market where local giants like AT&amp;T and Charter don’t have to compete on price, speeds, availability, customer service, or much of anything else. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2017/05/05/att-takes-heat-avoiding-broadband-upgrades-poor-areas/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.techdirt.com/2017/05/05/att-takes-heat-avoiding-broadband-upgrades-poor-areas/">Data also shows</a> that despite billions in tax breaks, regulatory favors, and subsidies, companies like AT&amp;T have long refused to upgrade low-income and minority Cleveland neighborhoods to fiber. These companies not only engage in this deployment “redlining,” but data also makes it clear they often charge these low income and minority neighborhoods <a href="https://www.cnet.com/home/internet/features/the-broadband-gaps-dirty-secret-redlining-still-exists-in-digital-form/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.cnet.com/home/internet/features/the-broadband-gaps-dirty-secret-redlining-still-exists-in-digital-form/">more money for the same or slower broadband</a>. </p>
<p>Last week I spent some time <a href="https://communitynets.org/content/clevelands-two-pronged-attack-make-worse-connected-city-label-relic-past" data-type="link" data-id="https://communitynets.org/content/clevelands-two-pronged-attack-make-worse-connected-city-label-relic-past">talking to Cleveland city leaders and local activists</a> about their plan to do something about it. On one hand, they’ve doled out $20 million in COVID relief broadband funding to local non-profit DigitalC to deliver fixed wireless broadband at speeds of 100 Mbps for as little as $18. </p>
<p>On the other hand, they’ve convinced a company named SiFi Networks to build a $500 million open access fiber network at no cost to taxpayers. SiFi Networks will benefit from a tight relationship with the city, while making its money from leasing access to the network to ISPs. </p>
<p>We’ve noted (see our <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2022/07/18/just-a-click-away-how-to-improve-broadband-competition/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.techdirt.com/2022/07/18/just-a-click-away-how-to-improve-broadband-competition/">Copia report on broadband competition</a>) that such open access networks routinely lower the cost for ISP market entry, boost competition, and generally result in lower prices. Monopolies like AT&amp;T, of course, have long opposed the idea, even if they would technically benefit from lower access costs, because it chips away at their consolidated monopoly power. </p>
<p>Local activists like DigitalC CEO Joshua Edmonds tell me they hope the project teaches U.S. towns and cities that there are alternatives to being feckless supplicants to regional telecom mono/duopolies:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“This is a major victory, and I hope that people don’t look at it as just a major victory for Cleveland. Every city where there’s a prevalent digital divide, where there’s political will and ability to execute, people should be paying close attention to what happens in Cleveland, paying close attention to how DigitalC was able to fight and navigate with our coalition of stakeholders.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>We’ll see what the finished network looks like. And now that Cleveland is challenging monopoly power, it will be interesting to see if local monopolies focus on challenging Cleveland. Big ISPs like AT&amp;T and Charter want to have their cake and eat it too; they don’t want to uniformly upgrade their broadband networks to next-gen speeds, but they genuinely don’t want others to do so either. </p>
<p>It’s a lot easier and cheaper to throw a bunch of campaign contributions at corrupt policymakers (<a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2021/02/19/new-bill-tries-to-ban-community-broadband-during-pandemic/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.techdirt.com/2021/02/19/new-bill-tries-to-ban-community-broadband-during-pandemic/">remember with the GOP wanted to ban all community broadband networks country-wide during the peak of the pandemic?</a> or how the telecom and GOP worked in concert to pass laws in 20 states effectively <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2021/04/15/washington-state-votes-to-kill-law-that-restricted-community-broadband/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.techdirt.com/2021/04/15/washington-state-votes-to-kill-law-that-restricted-community-broadband/">banning towns and cities from making these choices for themselves</a>?).</p>
<p>Community-owned broadband networks aren’t a magical panacea. Such efforts are like any other business plan, and require competency in design and implementation. But the community-owned and operated networks in more than 1,000 U.S. cities can (and routinely do) prompt a very broken and federal government-coddled status quo to actually try for once, much to its chagrin. </p>
