We’re a <i>remote-first</i> team of 35 people across North America. We’re growing and very profitable, and we have customers that love our product. We’re currently in the goldilocks zone of having product market fit with real revenue but also a really flat hierarchy where you can ship fast.</p><p>We want to accelerate product delivery (there’s so much to build!) so we’re looking to bring on high agency and experienced frontend engineers to work on high impact product features / frontend infrastructure. We’re building a small, focused, high performing frontend engineering team that works directly with the CEO leading the product. To help build this great team, we offer incredibly competitive compensation (based on Bay Area bands) and some interesting benefits(<a href="https://www.streak.com/careers#benefits" rel="nofollow">https://www.streak.com/careers#benefits</a>). We want you to do the best work of your career here, so you should expect high autonomy and ownership.</p><p>Lastly, we believe the traditional interview process isn’t well correlated with an engineers’ ability to ship product. Instead, our interview process mimics what it’s actually like to work here. It’s highly asynchronous, favors writing and involves building something useful. We think this will give you a really good insight into our team and company and of course lets us assess if you’ll thrive here.

We are hiring for several roles, but the one I will highlight is what we call the Platforms Engineer. Some companies call this Site Reliability Engineering or Devops.</p><p>The main thing we do is take upstream software, build it, run it on our infrastructure, and then monitor it and optimize that setup. Some things that make this interesting are:</p><p>* Building automation that enables us to do this for many networks (50+ currently).
 * Doing this with high uptime, building automation for failover, etc.
 * Working with software that is on the one hand cutting-edge and doing interesting things (consensus algorithms, distributed systems, cryptography), but on the other hand that means it’s immature and often not easy to operate and monitor. Often we have to build custom tools, and dive into the source code of the project. We contribute patches upstream when it makes sense.
 * Some of these projects are exercising the limits of what a machine can do, we have to do some low-level investigation that requires understanding of what the Linux kernel and network hardware are doing to properly identify what’s going on.</p><p>We do have a small cloud footprint but run primarily on bare metal. We are looking for people who can not just configure services offered by the public clouds, but who deeply understand what lies below; people who could build their own cloud. (That sounds a bit pretentious and it’s not exactly what we do, but it does involve many of the same aspects.)

It is important to note, however, that, since we are working in the Flemish educational market, we do expect you to speak Dutch or are in the process of learning Dutch.

If you have any strong desires, we’d love to hear them as well. We really are invested in finding the right fit and making sure you enjoy working for our company for a long while!</p><p>*  Interested? *</p><p>Email us at info@brightbook.be

As with any startup, product requirements and direction can change. And we strive to always provide clarity around “what did we learn” + “how that changes our thinking”. We feel the added transparency and sense of ownership results in keeping us closer to our customers and delivers a better end product.</p><p>----</p><p>Ideal requirements</p><pre><code>  * A love for Ruby on Rails

In the US, we spend an average of over $12,500 per person each year on healthcare -- that’s almost twice what other developed countries spend. Healthcare in the US costs a staggering $4 trillion dollars per year, almost 1/5 of our Nation’s entire economy. Yet with all this resource, our healthcare outcomes are poorer than other countries, people still can’t afford their healthcare, and our healthcare providers are burnt out.<p>Moreover, our healthcare is systemically unequal. People of color, lower income, and LGBTQ+ have demonstrably worse healthcare outcomes, a disparity grimly highlighted by the pandemic we’re living through now where people of color are three-times more likely to die from COVID-19.</p><p>How can this be, and how can we change it?</p><p>Nuna is tackling one of the most hardest problems in healthcare underlying the negative outcomes and disparities we see: how healthcare gets paid.</p><p>Today, hospitals only get paid when they do more-- more visits, more tests, more meds, more surgeries. Hopefully this helps patients get better, but regardless, the system gets paid. In fact, doing more is the only way to stay afloat.</p><p>But -- is this really the right set of incentives? Shouldn’t everyone get rewarded not just by doing more, but by when patients actually get better? Shouldn’t everyone have access to affordable, high quality care, and shouldn’t hospitals be rewarded when they deliver this care? And shouldn’t insurance companies get rewarded when they help ALL their patients get better?</p><p>Absolutely, yes. This concept is called Value-Based Care. In fact, healthcare as a whole has been trying to move in this direction for years, but making it all reality is deeply complex -- it is after all our healthcare. Nuna’s technology platform, our software apps, our vision, and our exceptionally talented team are collectively accelerating the healthcare system’s ability to make value-based care available to everyone.</p><p>In 2022, Nuna will power over $70B of healthcare payments for over 6.5M patients. We also leverage our data science and platform to direct patients to the best, culturally-matched, and accessible care providers for them. Additionally, we make it transparent and easy for both hospitals and insurers to see how they are performing in value-based care by spotlighting the patients or areas where they need to pay extra attention so that they can provide good care to all their patients and get rewarded.</p><p>Nuna is unique - we have brought together an exceptional team of over 200 people. We are the industry’s best in healthcare data, analytics, engineering, clinicians, and value based healthcare experts. We have joined forces to create a more equitable health system for everyone.</p><p>Our dreams and ambitions to change healthcare as we know it are big. If yours are too, we want to work with you.</p><p>Open positions include:</p><p>* Senior Data Scientist, Algorithm Development</p><p>* Sr Backend Software Engineer, Rewards</p><p>* Senior Data Scientist, LLM</p><p>* Senior Software Engineer, AI/ML Productionization Engineer (LLM/RAG)</p><p>* Senior Flutter Mobile Software Engineer, Rewards</p><p>Jobs Board: <a href="https://bit.ly/nuna-job-board" rel="nofollow">https://bit.ly/nuna-job-board</a></p><p>Frontend: React, Typescript, Flutter (Android and iOS)</p><p>Backend: Django, Python, Kotlin, Scala</p><p>Cloud: AWS</p><p>Questions?

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-testid="lanl-section"><p>A research team using the ChemCam instrument onboard NASA’s Curiosity rover discovered higher-than-usual amounts of manganese in lakebed rocks within Gale Crater on Mars, which indicates that the sediments were formed in a river, delta, or near the shoreline of an ancient lake. The results were published today in <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2023JE007923" target="_self">Journal of Geophysical Research: Planets</a>.</p>
<p>“It is difficult for manganese oxide to form on the surface of Mars, so we didn’t expect to find it in such high concentrations in a shoreline deposit,” said Patrick Gasda, of Los Alamos National Laboratory’s Space Science and Applications group and lead author on the study. “On Earth, these types of deposits happen all the time because of the high oxygen in our atmosphere produced by photosynthetic life, and from microbes that help catalyze those manganese oxidation reactions.</p>
<p>“On Mars, we don’t have evidence for life, and the mechanism to produce oxygen in Mars’s ancient atmosphere is unclear, so how the manganese oxide was formed and concentrated here is really puzzling. These findings point to larger processes occurring in the Martian atmosphere or surface water and shows that more work needs to be done to understand oxidation on Mars,” Gasda added.</p>
<p>ChemCam, which was developed at Los Alamos and CNES (the French space agency), uses a laser to form a plasma on the surface of a rock, and collects that light in order to quantify elemental composition in rocks.</p>
<p>The sedimentary rocks explored by the rover are a mix of sands, silts, and muds. The sandy rocks are more porous, and groundwater can more easily pass through sands compared to the muds that make up most of the lakebed rocks in the Gale Crater. The research team looked at how manganese could have been enriched in these sands—for example, by percolation of groundwater through the sands on the shore of a lake or mouth of a delta—and what oxidant could be responsible for the precipitation of manganese in the rocks.</p>
<p>On Earth, manganese becomes enriched because of oxygen in the atmosphere, and this process is often sped up by the presence of microbes. Microbes on Earth can use the many oxidation states of manganese as energy for metabolism; if life was present on ancient Mars, the increased amounts of manganese in these rocks along the lake shore would have been a helpful energy source for life.</p>
<p>“The Gale lake environment, as revealed by these ancient rocks, gives us a window into a habitable environment that looks surprisingly similar to places on Earth today,” said Nina Lanza, principal investigator for the ChemCam instrument. “Manganese minerals are common in the shallow, oxic waters found on lake shores on Earth, and it's remarkable to find such recognizable features on ancient Mars.”</p>

    </div><p>For decades, concerns about automobile pollution have focused on what comes out of the tailpipe. Now, researchers and regulators say, we need to pay more attention to toxic emissions from tires as vehicles roll down the road.</p>


										      
																																	
<p>At the top of the list of worries is a chemical called 6PPD, which is added to rubber tires to help them last longer. When tires wear on pavement, 6PPD is released. It reacts with ozone to become a different chemical, 6PPD-q, which can be extremely toxic—so much so that it has been linked to repeated fish kills in Washington state.</p>
<p>The trouble with tires doesn't stop there. Tires are made primarily of <a href="https://phys.org/tags/natural+rubber/" rel="tag">natural rubber</a> and <a href="https://phys.org/tags/synthetic+rubber/" rel="tag">synthetic rubber</a>, but they contain hundreds of other ingredients, often including steel and <a href="https://phys.org/tags/heavy+metals/" rel="tag">heavy metals</a> such as copper, lead, cadmium, and zinc.</p>
<p>As car tires wear, the rubber disappears in particles, both bits that can be seen with the naked eye and microparticles. Testing by a British company, Emissions Analytics, found that a car's tires emit 1 trillion <a href="https://phys.org/tags/ultrafine+particles/" rel="tag">ultrafine particles</a> per kilometer driven—from 5 to 9 pounds of rubber per internal combustion car per year.</p>
<p>And what's in those particles is a mystery, because tire ingredients are proprietary.</p>
<p>"You've got a chemical cocktail in these tires that no one really understands and is kept highly confidential by the tire manufacturers," said Nick Molden, CEO of Emissions Analytics. "We struggle to think of another consumer product that is so prevalent in the world and used by virtually everyone, where there is so little known of what is in them."</p>

																																						
																																			<p>Regulators have only begun to address the toxic tire problem, though there has been some action on 6PPD.</p>
<p>The chemical was identified by a team of researchers, led by scientists at Washington State University and the University of Washington, who were trying to determine why coho salmon returning to Seattle-area creeks to spawn were dying in large numbers.</p>
<p>Working for the Washington Stormwater Center, the scientists tested some 2,000 substances to determine which one was causing the die-offs, and in 2020 they announced they'd found the culprit: 6PPD.</p>
<p>The Yurok Tribe in Northern California, along with two other West Coast Native American tribes, have petitioned the Environmental Protection Agency to prohibit the chemical. The EPA said it is considering new rules governing the chemical. "We could not sit idle while 6PPD kills the fish that sustain us," said Joseph L. James, chairman of the Yurok Tribe, in a statement. "This lethal toxin has no place in any salmon-bearing watershed."</p>
<p>California has begun taking steps to regulate the chemical, last year classifying tires containing it as a "priority product," which requires manufacturers to search for and test substitutes.</p>
<p>"6PPD plays a crucial role in the safety of tires on California's roads and, currently, there are no widely available safer alternatives," said Karl Palmer, a deputy director at the state's Department of Toxic Substances Control.</p>
<p>"For this reason, our framework is ideally suited for identifying alternatives to 6PPD that ensure the continued safety of tires on California's roads while protecting California's fish populations and the communities that rely on them."</p>

																																			<p>The U.S. Tire Manufacturers Association says it has mobilized a consortium of 16 tire manufacturers to carry out an analysis of alternatives. Anne Forristall Luke, USTMA president and CEO, said it "will yield the most effective and exhaustive review possible of whether a safer alternative to 6PPD in tires currently exists."</p>
<p>Molden, however, said there is a catch. "If they don't investigate, they aren't allowed to sell in the state of California," he said. "If they investigate and don't find an alternative, they can go on selling. They don't have to find a substitute. And today there is no alternative to 6PPD."</p>
<p>California is also studying a request by the California Stormwater Quality Association to classify tires containing zinc, a heavy metal, as a priority product, requiring manufacturers to search for an alternative. Zinc is used in the vulcanization process to increase the strength of the rubber.</p>
<p>When it comes to tire particles, though, there hasn't been any action, even as the problem worsens with the proliferation of electric cars. Because of their quicker acceleration and greater torque, electric vehicles wear out tires faster and emit an estimated 20% more tire particles than the average gas-powered car.</p>
<p>A recent study in Southern California found tire and brake emissions in Anaheim accounted for 30% of PM<sub>2.5</sub>, a small-particulate air pollutant, while exhaust emissions accounted for 19%. Tests by Emissions Analytics have found that tires produce up to 2,000 times as much particle pollution by mass as tailpipes.</p>

																																						
																																			<p>These particles end up in water and air and are often ingested. Ultrafine particles, even smaller than PM<sub>2.5</sub>, are also emitted by tires and can be inhaled and travel directly to the brain. New research suggests tire microparticles should be classified as a pollutant of "high concern."</p>
<p>In a report issued last year, researchers at Imperial College London said the particles could affect the heart, lungs, and reproductive organs and cause cancer.</p>
<p>People who live or work along roadways, often low-income, are exposed to more of the toxic substances.</p>
<p>Tires are also a major source of microplastics. More than three-quarters of microplastics entering the ocean come from the synthetic rubber in tires, according to a report from the Pew Charitable Trusts and the British company Systemiq.</p>
<p>And there are still a great many unknowns in tire emissions, which can be especially complex to analyze because heat and pressure can transform tire ingredients into other compounds.</p>
<p>One outstanding research question is whether 6PPD-q affects people, and what health problems, if any, it could cause. A <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.estlett.2c00821" target="_blank">study</a> published in <i>Environmental Science &amp; Technology Letters</i> found high levels of the chemical in urine samples from a region of South China, with levels highest in pregnant women.</p>
<p>The discovery of 6PPD-q, Molden said, has sparked fresh interest in the health and environmental impacts of tires, and he expects an abundance of new research in the coming years. "The jigsaw pieces are coming together," he said. "But it's a thousand-piece jigsaw, not a 200-piece jigsaw."</p>

			<p><em>Washington, D.C.</em> – Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., and Sen. Edward Markey, D-Mass., requested the Federal Trade Commission investigate major automakers for breaking a pledge to protect their customers’ location data, in a letter to Chair Lina Khan sent today. The automakers had deceptively pledged that they would insist on warrants or other court orders before turning over location data from their customers’ connected automobiles to law enforcement agencies.</p>
<p>The letter comes in response to an inquiry by Sen. Wyden’s office, which asked the association representing automakers how their members respond to law enforcement requests for location information collected from internet-connected cars and trucks. He found that only five — GM, Ford, Honda, Stellantis and Tesla — require a warrant to provide location data to law-enforcement. And only Tesla notifies auto owners about government demands.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>“Automakers have not only kept consumers in the dark regarding their actual practices, but multiple companies misled consumers for over a decade by failing to honor the industry’s own voluntary privacy principles. To that end, we urge the FTC to investigate these auto manufacturers’ deceptive claims as well as their harmful data retention practices,” </strong>Wyden and Markey wrote.</p>
<p>Toyota, Nissan, Subaru, Volkswagen, BMW, Mazda, Mercedes-Benz and Kia all confirmed that they will disclose location data to U.S. government agencies in response to subpoenas, which do not require a judge’s approval. Volkswagen indicated that it will require a warrant for more than seven days of location data, but will disclose six days or less in response to a subpoena. Volvo, which is owned by Geely, a Chinese company, did not respond to the request. These responses directly contradict <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160422020327/http:/www.globalautomakers.org/system/files/document/attachments/Global%27s%20and%20the%20Alliance%27s%20FTC%20Letter%20Committment%20and%20Privacy%20Principles%20%282%29.pdf">a public pledge by the auto industry</a>, that the companies signed onto, committing to require that “requests or demand from governmental entities for geolocation information, must be in the form of a warrant or court order,” except in emergency situations or with the owner’s consent.</p>
<p>Wyden and Markey warned that failing to protect Americans’ privacy could have dangerous consequences, particularly in the wake of the Supreme Court’s <em>Dobbs </em>decision, which allows states to criminalize abortion and places other reproductive health choices at risk of criminalization. Vehicle location data can reveal intimate details of a person’s life, including for those who seek care across state lines, attend protests, visit mental or behavioral health professionals or seek treatment for substance use disorder.&nbsp;</p>

            <span>Abstract:</span>Large language models such as GPT and Llama are trained with a next-token prediction loss. In this work, we suggest that training language models to predict multiple future tokens at once results in higher sample efficiency. More specifically, at each position in the training corpus, we ask the model to predict the following n tokens using n independent output heads, operating on top of a shared model trunk. Considering multi-token prediction as an auxiliary training task, we measure improved downstream capabilities with no overhead in training time for both code and natural language models. The method is increasingly useful for larger model sizes, and keeps its appeal when training for multiple epochs. Gains are especially pronounced on generative benchmarks like coding, where our models consistently outperform strong baselines by several percentage points. Our 13B parameter models solves 12 % more problems on HumanEval and 17 % more on MBPP than comparable next-token models. Experiments on small algorithmic tasks demonstrate that multi-token prediction is favorable for the development of induction heads and algorithmic reasoning capabilities. As an additional benefit, models trained with 4-token prediction are up to 3 times faster at inference, even with large batch sizes.

<p dir="auto">Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) are promising alternatives of Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs). KANs have strong mathematical foundations just like MLPs: MLPs are based on the universal approximation theorem, while KANs are based on Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem. KANs and MLPs are dual: KANs have activation functions on edges, while MLPs have activation functions on nodes. This simple change makes KANs better (sometimes much better!) than MLPs in terms of both model <strong>accuracy</strong> and <strong>interpretability</strong>. A quick intro of KANs <a href="https://kindxiaoming.github.io/pykan/intro.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>

There are thousands of small models which is why we use CPUs rather than GPUs. Admittedly, our problem scales are smaller than typical machine learning tasks, but are typical for science-related tasks. In case the scale of your task is large, it is advisable to use GPUs.</p>

<p>For the first time, the Drug Enforcement Administration has called for ‘botanical cannabis’ to be reclassified under federal law.</p>



<p>The DEA’s decision, which the Associated Press <a href="https://apnews.com/article/marijuana-biden-dea-criminal-justice-pot-f833a8dae6ceb31a8658a5d65832a3b8" data-type="link" data-id="https://apnews.com/article/marijuana-biden-dea-criminal-justice-pot-f833a8dae6ceb31a8658a5d65832a3b8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">is reporting today</a>, to move cannabis from Schedule I to Schedule III of the US Controlled Substances Act comes eight months after the US Department of Health and Human Services initially<a href="https://norml.org/blog/2023/08/30/report-leaked-hhs-letter-calls-upon-dea-to-reschedule-cannabis/"> advocated</a> for the change,<a href="https://norml.org/blog/2024/01/12/hhs-releases-unredacted-letter-confirming-agencys-recommendation-to-dea-to-reclassify-marijuana-to-schedule-iii/"> finding</a>, “The vast majority of individuals who use marijuana are doing so in a manner that does not lead to dangerous outcomes to themselves or others.” The Biden Administration<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/10/06/statement-from-president-biden-on-marijuana-reform/"> initiated</a> federal agencies to review the issue in October 2022 – marking the the first time a President has ever made such a request.</p>



<p>By definition, <a href="https://www.dea.gov/drug-information/drug-scheduling#" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Schedule I substances</a> are criminally prohibited by federal law because they possess a “high potential for abuse“ and have “no currently accepted medical use in the United States.” Cannabis has remained classified as a Schedule I controlled substance since 1970.</p>



<p>The DEA’s determination must be reviewed by the White House Office of Management and Budget, according to AP.</p>



<p>Commenting on the forthcoming decision, NORML Deputy Director Paul Armentano said, “It is significant for these federal agencies, and the DEA and FDA in particular, to acknowledge publicly for the first time what many patients and advocates have known for decades: that cannabis is a safe and effective therapeutic agent for tens of millions of Americans.”</p>



<p>Armentano cautioned, however, that reclassifying cannabis as a Schedule III substance would not immediately address the growing chasm between federal law and the laws of most states that currently regulate cannabis for either <a href="https://norml.org/laws/medical-laws/">medical</a> or <a href="https://norml.org/laws/legalization/">adult use</a>.</p>



<p>“The goal of any federal cannabis policy reform ought to be to address the existing, untenable divide between federal marijuana policy and the cannabis laws of the majority of US states,” he said. “Rescheduling the cannabis plant to Schedule III fails to adequately address this conflict, as existing state legalization laws — both adult use and medical — will continue to be in conflict with federal regulations, thereby perpetuating the existing divide between state and federal marijuana policies.”</p>



<p>Historically, Schedule III substances have received explicit market approval by the FDA; they are only legal to possess when obtained in licensed pharmacies under a physician’s prescription.</p>



<p>“Just as it is intellectually dishonest and impractical to categorize cannabis in the same placement as heroin, it is equally disingenuous and unfeasible to treat cannabis in the same manner as anabolic steroids and ketamine,” Armentano said. “The <a href="https://norml.org/marijuana/library/surveys-polls/">majority</a> of Americans believe that cannabis ought to be legal and <a href="https://norml.org/news/2023/08/24/gallup-americans-perceive-cannabis-to-be-less-harmful-than-either-alcohol-or-cigarettes/">that its health risks are less significant</a> than those associated with federally descheduled substances like alcohol and tobacco. In fact, HHS<a href="https://thehill.com/opinion/healthcare/4442054-is-the-government-finally-abandoning-its-flat-earth-marijuana-policies/"> reached a similar conclusion</a> regarding cannabis’ safety profile in its own analysis.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Like those latter substances, NORML<a href="https://norml.org/blog/2023/06/23/norml-op-ed-cannabis-must-be-removed-from-the-controlled-substances-act-to-resolve-state-federal-conflicts/"> has long argued</a> that the cannabis plant should be removed from the Controlled Substances Act altogether, thereby providing state governments — rather than the federal government — the ability to regulate marijuana in the manner they see fit without violating federal law, and allowing the federal government to provide standards and guidelines for regulated cannabis markets.”</p>



<p>This is the<a href="https://norml.org/marijuana/fact-sheets/a-brief-history-of-cannabis-rescheduling-petitions-in-the-united-states/"> fifth time</a> that a cannabis rescheduling petition has been decided by the DEA. The agency<a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/08/12/2016-17954/denial-of-petition-to-initiate-proceedings-to-reschedule-marijuana" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> rejected</a> a similar petition in 2016.</p>



<p>The DEA’s rescheduling decision, once formalized, does not take immediate effect. The agency must first accept public comments, during which time interested parties<a href="https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/the-dea-s-scheduling-of-marijuana-what-7331364/"> </a>can formally <a href="https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/the-dea-s-scheduling-of-marijuana-what-7331364/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">request administrative hearings</a> to further debate the issue. Only following public comments and a possible judicial review will the agency issue its final determination. Changes in marijuana’s federal status will then take effect 30 days following publication of the DEA’s final rule in the Federal Register.</p>



<p>The DEA’s decision notwithstanding, Armentano speculated that federal agencies may ultimately request Congress to create new regulatory pathways for cannabis products, particularly for those marketed for adult use. The FDA made a <a href="https://norml.org/news/2023/02/02/fda-punts-on-establishing-rules-for-regulating-hemp-derived-cbd-products/">similar request</a> in 2023 with respect to hemp-derived CBD products, which they determined did not fit within any existing regulatory frameworks.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
		<p>A few days ago, I made this relatively-popular post on my Fediverse account, which had a picture of a Windows installer offering to install Alpine Linux:</p>

<p>And a day or two after that, I posted a YouTube video showing the entire install process from start to finish:</p>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mJwueWvZRG8?si=ykHkDfNNBdYmpSzm" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
<p>Countless<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> people have suggested that I should write a blog post about how I did this, so here we go.</p>
<h3>Step 1: Install Linux on an NTFS partition</h3>
<p>This is actually pretty easy these days! You want to pick a Linux distribution that will let you mount partitions by hand and then uncritically install to those mountpoints without questioning your decisions. Two Linux distributions that I’m aware of that will let you do this are Arch Linux and Alpine Linux.</p>
<h4>The partition scheme</h4>
<p>This is approximately what the partitioning scheme looks like:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>We are using UEFI/GPT. Presumably you could make this work with legacy boot/MBR, but that would require you to somehow install the grub boot sector from Windows. I don’t know how to do that.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The first partition is an EFI partition, about 100MB in size. Your Linux distributions may want you to create bigger partitions, but the Windows installer will only create a 100MB partition so you’re stuck with this size anyway. This is formatted as FAT32, and mounted at <code>/boot</code> the usual way.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The second partition is a 16MB partition that we don’t need to use, but need to correctly offset the partition numbers, since the Windows installer will create a 16MB partition between the EFI partition and the system partition for some reason.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The third partition is your root filesystem, filling up the rest of the disk. This is formatted as NTFS, mounted at <code>/</code> using the <code>ntfs3</code> partition type and the <code>acl</code> and <code>windows_names</code> mount options. The <code>acl</code> flag enables the driver to use POSIX ACLs (think: file permissions), and the <code>windows_names</code> flag prevents the creation of files that would not work on a Windows computer (say, anything that contains a <code>:</code> or is named <code>con</code>).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h4>Making the partitions and installing</h4>
<p>Using the <a href="https://docs.alpinelinux.org/user-handbook/0.1a/Installing/manual.html">Alpine semi-automatic installation guide</a> as a reference, you might create your partitions like so:</p>
<pre><code>// ntfs-3g-progs is required for mkfs.ntfs, which does not ship on 
// the alpine live iso for some reason
# apk add ntfs-3g-progs parted
# alias p="parted -sa optimal /dev/sda"
# p mklabel gpt
# p mkpart p 0M 100M
# p mkpart p 100M 116M
# p mkpart p 116M 100%
# p set 1 esp
// required so Windows will detect this as a valid NTFS partition
// later
# p set 3 msftdata
# mkfs.vfat -F32 /dev/sda1
# mkfs.ntfs -Q /dev/sda3
# mount -t ntfs3 -o acl,windows_names /dev/sda3 /mnt
# mkdir /mnt/boot
# mount /dev/sda1 /mnt/boot
</code></pre>
<p>After that, you simply proceed with the installation as normal. At this point, if you’re using Arch Linux, your <code>pacstrap</code> command will fail, because <code>pacman</code> expects to be able to create files with <code>:</code>s in the name, and as we discussed, that’s illegal. So, uh, try not to use a Linux distro that relies on the ability to do that. The rest of this guide will assume you’re installing Alpine.</p>
<h4>Getting the system to boot</h4>
<p>While Alpine correctly adds <code>rootfstype=ntfs3</code> to your kernel cmdline, for some reason, as of writing, the initramfs it generates does not include the <code>ntfs3</code> kernel module. Also, the Alpine installer will generate an <code>fstab</code> that uses UUIDs to identify partitions. Since we’ll be relying on the partitions created by the Windows installer, which will have fresh UUIDs, we need to change the <code>fstab</code> to use the ol' unreliable drive names instead.</p>
<p>So after you’re done installing, open <code>/mnt/etc/fstab</code> and change the first column of the EFI partition to say <code>/dev/sda1</code>, and the first column of the root partition to say <code>/dev/sda3</code>.</p>
<p>Next, we need to add <code>ntfs3</code> to the initramfs. For that, install the <code>mkinitfs</code> package on the live environment, create a file <code>/mnt/etc/mkinitfs/features.d/ntfs3.modules</code> that contains the text <code>kernel/fs/ntfs3</code>, and make sure that <code>/mnt/etc/mkinitfs/mkinitfs.conf</code>’s <code>features</code> line contains the <code>ntfs3</code> feature.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Side note: At the time of writing, you need to open <code>/sbin/mkinitfs</code> in a text editor and prefix the <code>sysconfdir</code> variable at the top of the file with <code>/mnt</code>, since <code>mkinitfs</code>’s <code>-b</code> flag doesn’t apply to that variable for some reason. <a href="https://gitlab.alpinelinux.org/alpine/mkinitfs/-/issues/60">I’ve filed a bug report for this</a> so hopefully that can be fixed and we can all start installing Alpine Linux to NTFS partitions as <del>God</del> Gates intended.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After that, running <code>mkinitfs -b /mnt -f /mnt/etc/fstab 6.6.28-0-lts</code> should regenerate your initramfs in a way that works with our shenanigans. Replace the kernel version string with whatever’s there in <code>/mnt/lib/modules</code>.</p>
<p>Finally, we need to tell grub to stop using UUIDs as well. Open <code>/mnt/boot/grub/grub.cfg</code>, find the Alpine Linux menu entry, replace the line <code>search ... --set root &lt;UUID of the EFI partition&gt;</code> with <code>set root='hd0,gpt1'</code> (that line may already exist, so let it be if so), and change the <code>linux ... root=UUID=&lt;UUID of root partition&gt; ...</code> line to say <code>root=/dev/sda3</code> instead.</p>
<p>There’s probably a better way to do this by changing <code>/mnt/etc/default/grub</code> and regenerating the config using <code>grub-mkconfig</code> but I don’t understand how that works and so this is what I did.</p>
<h4>Behold the monster</h4>
<p>Now, unmount <code>/mnt/boot</code> and <code>/mnt</code>, and you should be ready to reboot into your new Alpine installation! Unmounting is very important since if the dirty bit is set on an NTFS partition (which it is while it is mounted), <code>ntfs3</code> will refuse to mount it read-write until you run <code>chkdsk</code> on it from a Windows system or <code>ntfsfix</code> on it from a Linux system with <code>ntfs-3g-progs</code>. You do not want your root partition to be mounted read-only, it makes life hard.</p>
<p>After verifying that it does boot, we can move on to the hard part.</p>
<h3>Step 2: Stuff Linux into a WIM file</h3>
<p>This section (and transitively, the rest of this article) was motivated by the following exchange on Discord about the Windows installer:</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://prose.nsood.in/img/linux-from-windows-installer/discord-exchange.png" alt="A screenshot of a Discord conversation. chompxchg asks if you could shove a Linux distro into a WIM. Luna laughs. tendstofortytwo wonders if the USB boot stage of the installer does anything other than extracting the WIM, and if you could install Linux on an NTFS partition. chompxchg points out that at the very least the WIM could contain a Linux squashfs, and that nothing since the 2000s has used the Rock Ridge extensions. Luna notes that the Windows installer UI basically just runs DISM to extract the WIM file and bcdboot to make the partition bootable, on top of the actual disk partitioning.">
</figure>
<p>For context, a WIM (Windows Image) file is a compressed storage format used by Microsoft in the Windows installer. Think of it as a fancy ZIP file that the installer extracts onto your hard drive. A single WIM file can contain multiple images, and the Windows installer can pick which image it wants to install, either based on your product key, or what edition you choose during setup.</p>
<p>Our goal, then, is to add an image to the Windows installer’s WIM file (<code>sources\install.wim</code> in your Windows ISO/USB) whose contents are our Linux installation.</p>
<h4>Laying out the plan</h4>
<p>Creating a WIM file with our Linux installation is easy — Microsoft themselves provide tools for you to create your own WIM files, using a tool called DISM<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> (Deployment Image Service and Management tool). I’ve been using a convenient GUI frontend for DISM called <a href="https://www.autoitconsulting.com/site/software/gimagex/">GImageX</a>, but if you’re a Microsoft purist you could just use DISM directly for the same effect.</p>
<p>The hard part is making Linux bootable. <code>bcdboot</code> does not know what a Linux is. It only knows how to make Windows bootable. I thought of solving this problem by replacing <code>bcdboot</code> in the Windows setup with something that installs GRUB, but that felt against the spirit of the whole thing and also kinda hard. Instead, I came up with the following strategy:</p>
<ol>
<li>Install a copy of the Windows Preinstallation Environment (WinPE) on the same rootfs as Linux, putting them both in the same WIM image</li>
<li>Have the Windows installer make WinPE bootable and the computer reboot into WinPE after the first phase of Windows setup</li>
<li>Have WinPE make the necessary adjustments to make Linux bootable, and reboot into Linux</li>
</ol>
<h4>Meet the Windows Preinstallation Environment</h4>
<p>WinPE is made freely available by Microsoft as part of the Windows Assessment and Deployment Kit, and <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/manufacture/desktop/winpe-intro?view=windows-11">Microsoft even provides instructions</a> on how to download WinPE, customize it for your purposes, and use it in your custom applications. The only thing they disallow you from doing is using it as a general-purpose OS, but that’s fine, since we’re not doing that.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Side note: You will need to use Windows to follow the steps below, since the Windows ADK is not available for other platforms. You may have luck with obtaining a copy of WinPE through some other means and using <code>wimlib-imagex</code> to capture and apply your WIM files from within Linux, but I found that that tool would happily generate files from partitions that cause Windows to choke — which are useless since we’ll be using them in the Windows setup or in WinPE, both of which would also choke on them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After installing the Windows ADK and the WinPE addons, open the Deployment and Imaging Tools Environment from the Start menu as an administrator, and run the following command to get a working copy of WinPE.</p>
<pre><code>&gt; copype amd64 c:\pe_amd64
</code></pre>
<p>This will dump a copy of a WIM file containing Windows PE in <code>C:\pe_amd64\media\sources\boot.wim</code>. Apply this image to the drive containing your Linux rootfs, either using the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/manufacture/desktop/dism-image-management-command-line-options-s14?view=windows-11#apply-image"><code>Dism /Apply-Image</code></a> command or using the Apply tab in GImageX. The Linux rootfs drive is <code>E:\</code> in this screenshot:</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://prose.nsood.in/img/linux-from-windows-installer/gimagex-apply-winpe.png" alt="GImageX open at the Apply tab, with the source pointing to the WinPE boot.wim and the destination as the E: drive">
</figure>
<p>Now that we have WinPE, we can make it do our bidding.</p>
<h4>Making Linux bootable</h4>
<p>The great thing about UEFI boot is that there doesn’t need to be any magic bootcode in the first 512 bytes of the hard drive. You <em>can</em> inject magic UEFI boot entries into the firmware (Windows will inject one called “Windows Boot Manager”, and grub will inject one with whatever name you pass in the <code>--bootloader-id</code> flag while running <code>grub-install</code>), but you don’t have to. If you boot from a hard drive directly, without the help of any magic boot entry, the UEFI will simply read <code>efi\boot\bootx64.efi</code> from the EFI partition in that drive and run it.</p>
<p><code>bcdboot</code> will put a file there that will load Windows, in addition to creating the UEFI entry. And if you specify <code>--removable</code> while running <code>grub-install</code>, grub will also put a file there that will load grub and read <code>grub/grub.cfg</code> from the EFI partition. Conveniently, Alpine specifies <code>--removable</code>, so no magic UEFI entries to worry about creating.</p>
<p>Recall that when we installed Linux, we made <code>/boot</code> our EFI partition. So all we need to do to make Linux bootable from WinPE is to drop into the EFI partition the files that Alpine put in <code>/boot</code>. It’ll drop the <code>efi\boot\bootx64.efi</code> in place, and that will make it so that booting from the hard drive will boot grub, which will load Alpine.</p>
<p>To do this, first, we need to save a copy of the Linux EFI partition. In Windows, run the <code>diskpart</code> command<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>, and run the following commands in the <code>diskpart</code> prompt:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; list disk
// note N, the disk number of your Linux drive
&gt; select disk N
&gt; select partition 1
&gt; assign letter=S
</code></pre>
<p>This will make the Linux EFI partition available as <code>S:\</code> on Windows. Once that’s done, you can use the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/manufacture/desktop/dism-image-management-command-line-options-s14?view=windows-11#capture-image"><code>Dism /Capture-Image</code></a> command or the “Capture” tab in GImageX to capture the <code>S:\</code> drive as <code>efi.wim</code> on your Linux rootfs.</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://prose.nsood.in/img/linux-from-windows-installer/gimagex-capture-efi.png" alt="GImageX open at the Capture tab, with the source pointing to the S: drive and the destination as efi.wim in the E: drive">
<figcaption>The Name and Description fields are not important, for now.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Now that we have the contents of the EFI partition, we just need to get WinPE to apply them. Conveniently, the default build of WinPE simply executes <code>\Windows\System32\startnet.cmd</code> on startup, so we can make that file do what we want.</p>
<p>Open <code>E:\Windows\System32\startnet.cmd</code> in Notepad as administrator. It should already have a line that says <code>wpeinit</code> in it — as the name suggests, that initializes a WinPE environment. I have no idea if it’s necessary, but it doesn’t hurt so I just left it in there. Add the following lines:</p>
<pre><code>diskpart /s mount-efi.txt
dism /Apply-Image /ImageFile:"C:\efi.wim" /Index:1 /ApplyDir:S:\
bcdedit /delete {bootmgr} /f
exit
</code></pre>
<p>The second line should be fairly self-explanatory — we’re applying the EFI image we captured to the <code>S:\</code> drive, which presumably is where our EFI partition is. The first line is what we use to put it there. By default, EFI partitions are not assigned a drive letter, but as we did above, you can use <code>diskpart</code> to give them one. The <code>/s</code> flag allows you to give a script to execute to <code>diskpart</code> rather than it reading commands from the terminal. Create a file called <code>mount-efi.txt</code> in the <code>System32</code> folder, and give it the following contents to mount the EFI partition:</p>
<pre><code>select disk 0
select partition 1
assign letter=S
exit
</code></pre>
<p>The third line we added in <code>startnet.cmd</code> deletes the magic UEFI boot entry that the Windows installer creates to boot Windows. This entry has a higher precedence than booting directly from the hard drive, so we want to delete it to boot into grub like we want.</p>
<p>And that should be it! Now, booting into our Linux rootfs will start a copy of WinPE, which will render itself unbootable and make Linux bootable in its stead, then reboot.</p>
<h4>One more thing</h4>
<p>This took me three days of headbanging, trial and error, giving up, retrying, and more, to figure out. You could capture the Linux rootfs into a WIM file at this point, and put it into a Windows ISO and boot from it. The installer will appear to run successfully, until the installer asks you for a product key and you say you don’t have one. Then you’ll see this screen:</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://prose.nsood.in/img/linux-from-windows-installer/windows-setup-eula-error.png" alt="The Windows installer, running in a virtual machine titled, 'Can a Windows ISO and a Linux Installation Really'. It's displaying an error message: 'Windows cannot find the Microsoft Software License terms. Make sure the installation sources are valid and restart the installation.'">
<figcaption>Typical Microsoft behavior.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>It turns out that the Windows installer will read the EULA out from within the WIM file, and from within the specific image you chose. It will look for this EULA in <code>\Windows\System32\[Locale]\Licenses\[Channel]\[Edition]\license.rtf</code>. The locale is the language and country code, like <code>en-US</code>, the channel is one of <code>_Default</code>, <code>OEM</code>, or <code>Volume</code>, and the <code>Edition</code> is set for the image by the software that captured your WIM file. I <em>thought</em> that this corresponded to the SKU dropdown in GImageX, but that seems to not be the case, it seems to instead be auto-detected by DISM. The channel for WinPE is, well, <code>WindowsPE</code>.</p>
<p>So download a copy of the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0.rtf">GNU General Public License v2.0 in RTF format</a>, open it in WordPad to set the font to Segoe UI so that it renders properly, and then save it as <code>E:\Windows\System32\en-US\Licenses\WindowsPE\_Default\license.rtf</code>, where <code>E:</code> is your Linux rootfs. You may also have to populate the <code>OEM</code> and <code>Volume</code> directories — I’m not sure which one the installer read, since I populated all three in my testing.</p>
<h4>The capture</h4>
<p>Now, we can use <code>Dism /Capture-Image</code> or GImageX’s Capture tab to capture the Linux rootfs into your Windows setup. Copy the contents of a Windows ISO into a convenient folder (I used <code>C:\win10</code> since I was using a Windows 10 ISO), and capture your Linux rootfs drive into the <code>sources\install.wim</code> in that folder. Use the “append” mode if you want to keep the existing Windows images in the WIM file, or “create” mode if you want to overwrite the file entirely and only be able to install Linux.</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://prose.nsood.in/img/linux-from-windows-installer/gimagex-capture-efi.png" alt="GImageX open at the Capture tab, with the source pointing to the E: drive and the destination as install.wim in the Windows installer directory. The name and description fields are all set to 'Alpine Linux'.">
<figcaption>This is where the Name and Description fields become important.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>And that’s it! The Windows installer in that directory will now be able to install Alpine Linux. Or rather, it will be able to install a copy of Windows PE that incidentally has an entire installation of Alpine Linux embedded in it, and whose only job is to make that copy of Alpine Linux bootable. Same thing.</p>
<p>You can turn this folder into a bootable ISO using the <code>oscdimg.exe</code> command provided in the Windows ADK. Instructions for doing that are in <a href="https://www.elevenforum.com/t/create-custom-windows-11-iso-file.443/">this wonderful ElevenForum post</a>. I’m so glad I found that post, because I have no idea how anyone would be expected to figure out those magic value in that command. In case the forum post goes down, there’s an archive of that URL in the Wayback Machine.</p>
<h3>Step 3: Profit?</h3>
<p>At this point, you should be able to boot the ISO and install Alpine Linux using the Windows installer onto a blank hard drive. Note that I do not recommend using this installer for anything important, for various reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>The installer is <em>incredibly</em> fragile. I basically hardcoded the disk and partition layouts into the Linux installation, as well as the <code>diskpart</code> commands that WinPE runs. This will only work for installing to the first hard drive in a computer when it is completely blank before the Windows installer touches it. And if the installer changes the partition layout it creates on a blank hard drive, it’s over. For the record, the installer I used was the Windows 10 22H2 ISO from the Microsoft website.</li>
<li>The WIM capture does not preserve UNIX file permissions, so while the installed copy of Linux boots, you will need to fix permissions for the entire installation afterwards somehow.</li>
<li>The grub changes are very hacky and I don’t know if they’ll survive an update.</li>
<li>Using NTFS for your Linux rootfs is honestly just a really bad time. As I mentioned before, if the dirty bit is set that will make your entire rootfs read-only, making normal use of the computer impossible until you boot from a live CD to clear it. Also, while the base Alpine install works, there’s no guarantee that any software you install won’t expect to be able to create files with names prohibited by Windows.</li>
<li>You literally already installed Alpine the normal way as a sub-procedure of this. Just do that. Please.</li>
</ul>
<p>But you have to admit, it’s quite funny.</p>
<p>Please redirect any hate mail to <code>"spam\x40tends\x2eto"</code>. :)</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/30/24145680/google-workers-fired-project-nimbus-protest-nlrb-complaint">https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/30/24145680/google-workers-fired-project-nimbus-protest-nlrb-complaint</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40217643">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A software engineer who was fired from Google in connection to internal protests at the company’s offices says the company retaliated against him for merely watching the demonstration against an Israeli defense contract.</p><p>The former employee, who asked to remain anonymous, said he went to the lounge on the 10th floor of Google’s New York City office around lunchtime to check out the protest.</p><p>“When I got there, there were probably 20-ish people sitting on the floor. I didn’t talk to any of them, I talked to folks who were standing up, passing out flyers, doing other roles,” he said, adding that the protesters were wearing matching T-shirts. </p><p>The worker then went back to his desk before returning to the protest around 5PM. “I chatted with them for maybe four minutes, like, ‘Oh my gosh, you’re still sitting here! How’s it going?’” he said. Then, he finished the workday from a nearby couch. The worker says he returned to Google the following day without incident. That night, while at dinner, he got an email from Google saying he had been terminated.</p><p>“I think it’s all part of this bigger context of Google cracking down on workers having a voice,” said the former employee, who worked at Google for almost three years and was part of the Alphabet Workers Union leadership. (The Alphabet Workers Union is <a href="https://collectiveaction.tech/2021/the-abcs-of-googles-new-union/">a non-contract union</a>, meaning it hasn’t been recognized by the NLRB.)</p><p>Google initially put nine employees on administrative leave for occupying its offices in New York City and Sunnyvale, California, in protest of Project Nimbus, a $1.2 billion cloud computing contract with the Israeli government. Those workers <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/17/24133056/google-protests-project-nimbus-no-tech-for-apartheid">were also arrested</a>. The company then <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/17/24133700/google-fires-28-employees-protest-israel-cloud-contract">fired 28 employees in connection with the protests</a>. In an internal memo to staff, Chris Rackow, Google’s head of global security, said the company would take further action if needed.&nbsp;</p><p>“The overwhelming majority of our employees do the right thing,” Rackow’s statement read. “If you’re one of the few who are tempted to think we’re going to overlook conduct that violates our policies, think again. The company takes this extremely seriously, and we will continue to apply our longstanding policies to take action against disruptive behavior — up to and including termination.”</p><p>Less than a week later, Google fired more than 20 other employees, some of whom said they hadn’t participated in the protests at all.</p><p>In a statement to <em>The Verge</em>, Google spokesperson Bailey Tomson said the company investigated the “physical disruption inside our buildings on April 16, looking at additional details provided by coworkers who were physically disrupted” to determine which workers had been involved.”</p><p>But the software engineer who was fired says he was never contacted by HR or asked whether he had actually been involved in the protests. “They didn’t even reach out to me,” he said. “This was a total shock; I had no hint that this was coming.”</p><div><p>The software engineer who was fired says he was never contacted by HR or asked whether he had actually been involved in the protests</p></div><p>The worker said that while he was watching the protest, a security guard approached him and others in the lounge and asked to see their Google badges to make sure there were no outside participants. “It didn’t even occur to me that I shouldn’t show him my badge. He’s the security guard in the place that I work, and I was doing nothing wrong,” the worker said.</p><p>More than 50 workers who were fired by Google in connection with protests over the company’s ties to the Israeli government <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/24628681-google-charge?responsive=1&amp;title=1">filed a complaint</a> with the National Labor Relations Board on Monday. The workers have alleged unlawful retaliation and are asking for their jobs back, according to an emailed statement from No Tech For Apartheid, the group that organized the protests. </p><p>Google “retaliated against approximately 50 employees and interfered with their Section 7 rights by terminating and/or placing them on administrative leave in response to their protected concerted activity, namely, participation (or perceived participation) in a peaceful, non-disruptive protest that was directly and explicitly connected to their terms and conditions of work,” the complaint reads.</p><p>Jane Chung, a spokesperson for No Tech For Apartheid, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/22/24137464/google-has-fired-another-20-employees-since-the-internal-protest-over-the-companys-israeli-defense-c">previously told <em>The Verge</em></a> that the firings included “non-participating bystanders.” Google disputes this. Tomson, the Google spokesperson, told <em>The Verge</em> that all of the workers who were fired were “personally and definitively involved in disruptive activity inside our buildings.”</p><p>This is a marked departure from the way Google has handled employee dissent in the past. In 2018, more than 600 Google workers <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/30/18118691/google-dragonfly-employee-activism-listserv-union-strike">signed an open letter</a> opposing Project Dragonfly, an effort to build a search engine for China. As <em>The Verge</em> reported at the time, the petition began with an internally shared Google Doc, and all subsequent steps were also organized using Google products. Employees also <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/1/17418406/google-maven-drone-imagery-ai-contract-expire">urged Google to drop Project Maven</a>, its contract with the US Department of Defense. That same year, over 20,000 Google employees <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/2/18057716/google-walkout-20-thousand-employees-ceo-sundar-pichai-meeting">staged a walkout</a> in protest of the company’s handling of sexual harassment allegations against executives. </p><div><p>Meredith Whittaker, a program manager at Google who helped organize the 2018 walkout, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/16/20695964/google-protest-leader-meredith-whittaker-leaves-company">left the company in 2019</a> of her own volition. In 2019, workers also <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/30/18524374/google-employee-sit-in-may-1-protest">held a sit-in protesting alleged retaliation</a> against their colleagues who had spoken out.</p></div><p>“There’s been a total change in the way Google responds to employees trying to have a voice in their workplace,” the fired software engineer said. “It’s night and day from the Google of even five, 10 years ago.”</p></div></div>]]></description>

<ul>
<li>The Rabbit R1 is an AI-powered, handheld gadget that seems to run Android under the hood.</li>
<li>Many reviewers have criticized the utility of AI gadgets like the Rabbit R1, noting that they do little to supplant the smartphone and should just be an app instead.</li>
<li>In fact, the R1’s entire UI seems to be handled by a single Android app.</li>
</ul>
</div><p><strong>Update: May 1, 2024 (1:01 AM ET): </strong>Rabbit has reached out to <em>Android Authority</em> with a statement from its founder and CEO, Jesse Lyu. The statement argues that the R1’s interface is not an app. The company explains that the LLM it uses runs on the cloud, which is something we never questioned. We’ll be following up with another article diving deeper into the subject soon. Until then, you can read Rabbit’s complete statement below.</p><div><p>“rabbit r1 is not an Android app. We are aware there are some unofficial rabbit OS app/website emulators out there. We understand the passion that people have to get a taste of our AI and LAM instead of waiting for their r1 to arrive. That being said, to clear any misunderstanding and set the record straight, rabbit OS and LAM run on the cloud with very bespoke AOSP and lower level firmware modifications, therefore a local bootleg APK without the proper OS and Cloud endpoints won’t be able to access our service. rabbit OS is customized for r1 and we do not support third-party clients. Using a bootlegged APK or webclient carries significant risks; malicious actors are known to publish bootlegged apps that steal your data. For this reason, we recommend that users avoid these bootlegged rabbit OS apps.”</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Original article: April 30, 2024 (5:07 PM ET):</strong> When startups like Humane and Rabbit first unveiled their AI-powered gadgets a couple of months ago, early backers were hopeful that these AI companions would usher in a new era of wearable AI. Unfortunately for them, both products launched half-baked, leaving tech reviewers with no choice but to harshly criticize them.</p></div><p>The <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/rabbit-r1-hands-on-3436926/">Rabbit R1</a>, for example, does almost nothing that your <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/best-android-phones-568001/">Android phone</a> can’t do. In our hands-on, we noted that the gadget lets you do things like talk to a large language model (LLM) to get answers to questions, take a photo of an object to get info about it, play music from Spotify, hail a ride from Uber, or order food from Doordash, but that’s basically it. If everything an AI gadget like the Rabbit R1 can do can be replicated by an Android app, then why aren’t these companies simply releasing an app instead of hardware that costs hundreds of dollars, requires a separate mobile data plan to be useful, and has terrible battery life? It turns out that’s exactly what Rabbit has done…sort of.</p><p>See, it turns out that the Rabbit R1 seems to run Android under the hood and the entire interface users interact with is powered by a single Android app. A tipster shared the Rabbit R1’s launcher APK with us, and with a bit of tinkering, we managed to install it on an Android phone, specifically a Pixel 6a.</p><p>Once installed, we were able to set up our Android phone as if it were a Rabbit R1. The volume up key on our phone corresponds to the Rabbit R1’s hardware key, allowing us to proceed through the setup wizard, create a “rabbithole” account, and start talking to the AI assistant. Since the Rabbit R1 has a significantly smaller and lower resolution display than the Pixel 6a, the home screen interface only took up a tiny portion of the phone’s display. Still, we were able to fire off a question to the AI assistant as if we were using actual Rabbit R1 hardware, as you can see in the video embedded below.</p><p>We didn’t bother testing out any other functionality, such as Spotify integration, Vision, etc., but we wouldn’t be surprised if some of them didn’t work. After all, the Rabbit R1’s launcher app is intended to be preinstalled in the firmware and be granted several privileged, system-level permissions — only some of which we were able to grant — so some of the functions would likely fail if we tried. Still, the fact that this app works at all on my phone is hilarious and is a testament to the fact that, at their core, a lot of these niche hardware products run on a modified version of <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/aosp-explained-1093505/">AOSP</a>.</p><p><strong>Got a tip?

<section>
    <p>Music notation should be as accessible and as fluid as text is, on the
    web; that it is not, yet, is something of an afront to my sensibilities.
    Let us fix this pressing problem.</p>

    <h2>The Scribe prototype</h2>

    <figure>
        <img src="https://cruncher.ch/static/blog/printing-music/images/scribe-020-dolphin-dance.png">
        <figcaption>SVG rendered by Scribe 0.2</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>Some years ago I prototyped a music renderer I called Scribe that outputs
    SVG from JSON. The original goal was to produce a responsive music renderer.
    It was a good demo, but to progress I was going to have to write a complex
    multi-pass layout engine, and, well, other things got in the way.</p>

    <p>Shortly after making that I was busy adopting Grid into our projects at
    Cruncher when something about it struck me as familiar, and I wondered if
    it might not be an answer to some of the layout problems I had been tackling
    in Scribe.</p>

    <h2>The class <code>.stave</code></h2>

    <p>The musical staff is grid-like. Pitch is plotted up the vertical axis and
    time runs left to right along the horizontal axis. I am going to define
    these two axes in two seperate classes. The vertical axis, defining grid rows,
    will be called <code>.stave</code>. We'll get to the time axis in a bit.</p>

    <p>A <code>.stave</code> has fixed-size grid rows named with standard pitch
    names, and a background image that draws the staff. So for a treble clef
    stave the row map might look like this:</p>

    <pre><code>
    .stave {
        display: grid;
        row-gap: 0;
        grid-template-rows:
            [A5] 0.25em [G5] 0.25em [F5] 0.25em [E5] 0.25em
            [D5] 0.25em [C5] 0.25em [B4] 0.25em [A4] 0.25em
            [G4] 0.25em [F4] 0.25em [E4] 0.25em [D4] 0.25em
            [C4] 0.25em ;

        background-image:    url('/path/to/stave.svg');
        background-repeat:   no-repeat;
        background-size:     100% 2.25em;
        background-position: 0 50%;
    }
    </code></pre>

    <p>Which, applied to a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> gives us:</p>

    

    <p>Ok. Not much to see, but on inspecting it we do see that each line and
    each space on the stave now has its own pitch-named grid line to identify each row:</p>

    <img height="520" src="https://cruncher.ch/static/blog/printing-music/images/template-rows.png" alt="Named grid rows">

    <h3>Placing pitches up the stave</h3>

    <p>Any given row on a stave may contain any of several pitches. The
    pitches <strong>G♭</strong>, <strong>G</strong> and <strong>G♯</strong> must
    all sit on the <strong>G</strong> stave line, for example.</p>

    <p>To place DOM elements that represent those pitches in their correct rows I
    am going to put pitch names in <code>data-pitch</code> attributes and use CSS
    to map <code>data-pitch</code> values to stave rows.</p>

    <pre><code>
    .stave &gt; [data-pitch^="G"][data-pitch$="4"] { grid-row-start: G4; }
    </code></pre>

    <p>This rule captures pitches that start with <code>'G'</code> and end with
    <code>'4'</code>, so it assigns pitches <code>'G♭4'</code>, <code>'G4'</code>
    and <code>'G♯4'</code> (and double flat <code>'G𝄫4'</code> and  double sharp
    <code>'G𝄪4'</code>) to the <code>G4</code> row. That does need to be done for
    every stave row:</p>

    </aside-->

    <pre><code>
    .stave &gt; [data-pitch^="A"][data-pitch$="5"] { grid-row-start: A5; }
    .stave &gt; [data-pitch^="G"][data-pitch$="5"] { grid-row-start: G5; }
    .stave &gt; [data-pitch^="F"][data-pitch$="5"] { grid-row-start: F5; }
    .stave &gt; [data-pitch^="E"][data-pitch$="5"] { grid-row-start: E5; }
    .stave &gt; [data-pitch^="D"][data-pitch$="5"] { grid-row-start: D5; }

    ...

    .stave &gt; [data-pitch^="D"][data-pitch$="4"] { grid-row-start: D4; }
    .stave &gt; [data-pitch^="C"][data-pitch$="4"] { grid-row-start: C4; }
    </code><!--style>
    .stave > [data-pitch^="A"][data-pitch$="5"] { grid-row-start: A5; }
    .stave > [data-pitch^="G"][data-pitch$="5"] { grid-row-start: G5; }
    .stave > [data-pitch^="F"][data-pitch$="5"] { grid-row-start: F5; }
    .stave > [data-pitch^="E"][data-pitch$="5"] { grid-row-start: E5; }
    .stave > [data-pitch^="D"][data-pitch$="5"] { grid-row-start: D5; }
    .stave > [data-pitch^="C"][data-pitch$="5"] { grid-row-start: C5; }
    .stave > [data-pitch^="B"][data-pitch$="4"] { grid-row-start: B4; }
    .stave > [data-pitch^="A"][data-pitch$="4"] { grid-row-start: A4; }
    .stave > [data-pitch^="G"][data-pitch$="4"] { grid-row-start: G4; }
    .stave > [data-pitch^="F"][data-pitch$="4"] { grid-row-start: F4; }
    .stave > [data-pitch^="E"][data-pitch$="4"] { grid-row-start: E4; }
    .stave > [data-pitch^="D"][data-pitch$="4"] { grid-row-start: D4; }
    .stave > [data-pitch^="C"][data-pitch$="4"] { grid-row-start: C4; }
    </style--></pre>

    <p>That should give us enough to begin placing symbols on a stave! I have a
    bunch of SVG symbols that were prepared for the Scribe prototype, so let's
    try placing a couple on a stave:</p>

    <pre><code>
    &lt;div class="stave"&gt;
        &lt;svg data-pitch="G4" class="head"&gt;
            &lt;use href="#head[2]"&gt;&lt;/use&gt;
        &lt;/svg&gt;
        &lt;svg data-pitch="E5" class="head"&gt;
            &lt;use href="#head[2]"&gt;&lt;/use&gt;
        &lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    </code></pre>

    

    <p>That looks promising. Next, time.</p>

    <h2>The class <code>.bar</code> and its beats</h2>

    <p>Rhythm is perhaps a little trickier to handle. There is not one
    immediately obvious smallest rhythmic division to adopt that will support all kinds
    of rhythms. A judgement call must be made about what minimum note lengths
    and what cross-rhythms to support inside a grid.</p>

    <p>A 24-column-per-beat approach supports beat divisions to evenly lay out
    eighth notes (12 columns), sixteenth notes (6 columns) 32nd notes (3 columns)
    as well as triplet values of those notes. It's a good starting point.</p>

    <!--aside class="4x right right-2 text-10">
        <p>There may be a case for opting for higher
        resolutions, but I don't know yet how an HTML document will behave when it
        has hundreds of bars of grids in it – potentially hundreds of thousands of
        cells.</p>
    </aside-->

    <p>Here is a 4 beat bar defined as 4 × 24 = 96 grid columns, plus a column at
    the beginning and one at the end:</p>

    <pre><code>
    .bar {
        column-gap: 0.03125em;
        grid-template-columns:
            [bar-begin]
            max-content
            repeat(96, minmax(max-content, auto))
            max-content
            [bar-end];
    }
    </code><!--style>
    .bar {
        padding-left: 0.5em;
        padding-right: 0.5em;
        column-gap: 0.03125em;
        grid-template-columns:
            [bar-begin]
            max-content
            repeat(96, minmax(max-content, auto))
            max-content
            [bar-end];
    }

    .bar::before,
    .bar::after {
        grid-row: B4;
        align-self: center;
        height: 2em;
    }

    .flex > .bar {
        flex: 1 1;
        /* Make bar lines overlap */
        margin-left: calc(-1 * var(--bar-line-size, 1px));
        margin-right: 0;
    }
    </style--></pre>

    <p>Add a couple of bar lines as <code>::before</code> and <code>::after</code>
    content, and put a clef symbol in there centred on the stave with <code>data-pitch="B4"</code>,
    and we get:</p>

    <pre><code>
    &lt;div class="stave bar"&gt;
        &lt;svg data-pitch="B4" class="treble-clef"&gt;
            &lt;use href="#treble-clef"&gt;&lt;/use&gt;
        &lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    </code></pre>

    

    <p>Inspect that and we see that the clef has dropped into the first column,
    and there are 96 zero-width columns, 24 per beat, each seperated by a small <code>column-gap</code>:</p>

    <img height="516" src="https://cruncher.ch/static/blog/printing-music/images/template-columns.png" alt="Named grid rows">

    <h3>Placing symbols at beats</h3>

    <p>This time I am going to use <code>data-beat</code> attributes to assign
    elements a beat, and CSS rules to map beats to grid columns. The CSS map

    <p>The attribute <code>^=</code> starts-with selector
    makes the rule error-tolerant. At some point, inevitably, unrounded or
    floating point numbers will be rendered into <span><code>data-beat</code>.</span>
    Two of their decimal places is enough to identify a <span>1/24th-of-a-beat</span>
    grid column.</p>

    <p>Put that together with our <code>stave</code> class and we are able to position symbols
    by beat and pitch by setting <code>data-beat</code> to a beat between
    <code>1</code> and <code>5</code>, and <code>data-pitch</code> to a note name. As we do,
    the beat columns containing those symbols grow to accommodate them:</p>

    <pre><code>
    &lt;div class="stave bar"&gt;
        &lt;svg class="clef" data-pitch="B4"&gt;…&lt;/svg&gt;
        &lt;svg class="flat" data-beat="1" data-pitch="Bb4"&gt;…&lt;/svg&gt;
        &lt;svg class="head" data-beat="1" data-pitch="Bb4"&gt;…&lt;/svg&gt;
        &lt;svg class="head" data-beat="2" data-pitch="D4"&gt;…&lt;/svg&gt;
        &lt;svg class="head" data-beat="3" data-pitch="G5"&gt;…&lt;/svg&gt;
        &lt;svg class="rest" data-beat="4" data-pitch="B4"&gt;…&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    </code></pre>

    

    <p>Ooo. Stems?</p>

    

    <p>Yup. Tails?</p>

    

    <p>Yup. The tail spacing can be improved (which should be achievable with margins) – but the positioning works.</p>

    <h2>Fluid and responsive notation</h2>

    <p>Stick a whole bunch of bars like these together in a flexbox container
    that wraps and we start to see responsive music:</p>

    <pre><code>
    &lt;figure class="flex"&gt;
        &lt;div class="treble-stave stave bar"&gt;…&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;div class="treble-stave stave bar"&gt;…&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;div class="treble-stave stave bar"&gt;…&lt;/div&gt;
        …
    &lt;/figure&gt;
    </code></pre>





    





    <p>There are clearly a bunch of things missing from this, but this is a
    great base to start from. It already wraps more gracefully than I have yet
    seen an online music renderer&nbsp;do.</p>


    <h2>The space between the&nbsp;notes</h2>

    <p>Ignoring these beams for a moment, notice that note heads that occur closer
    in time to one another are rendered slightly closer together:</p>

    

    <p>It's a subtle, deliberate effect created by the small <code>column-gap</code>,
    which serves as a sort of time 'ether' into which symbol elements slot. Columns
    themselves are zero width unless there is a note head in them, but there are
    more column-gaps – 24 per beat – between events that are further apart in
    beats, and so more distance.</p>

    <p>Constant spacing can be controlled by adjusting margins on the symbols.
    To get a more constant spacing here we would reduce the <code>column-gap</code>
    while increasing the margin of note heads:</p>

    

    <p>But ugh, that looks bad, because the head spacings give the reader no clue
    as to how rapid the rhythm is. The point is, CSS is giving us some nice control
    over the metrics. And the aim now is to tweak those metrics for readability.</p>

    <h3>Clefs and time signatures</h3>

    <!--p>I like this system for printing music.  Individual symbol margins,
    stroke thicknesses, and even stave maps, can all be restyled in&nbsp;CSS.</p-->

    <p>You may be wondering why I employed seperate classes for vertical and
    horizontal spacing, why not just one? Seperating the axes means that
    one can be swapped out without the other. Take the melody:</p>

    <scribe-music type="sequence" clef="treble" meter="4/4">
    0.5 B3  0.2 1.5
    2   D4  0.2 1
    3   F#4 0.2 1
    4   E4  0.2 1
    5   D4  0.2 1
    6   B3  0.2 0.5
    6.5 G3  0.2 0.5
    <!--9   A3  0.2 1
    10  C4  0.2 1
    11  G4  0.2 1
    12  F#4 0.2 1
    13  C#4 0.2 2-->
    </scribe-music>

    <p>To display this same melody on a bass clef, the <code>stave</code> class can be
    swapped out for a <code>bass-stave</code> class that maps the same <code>data-pitch</code>
    attributes to bass stave lines:</p>

    <pre><code>
    &lt;div class="bass-stave bar"&gt;...&lt;/div&gt;
    </code></pre>

    <scribe-music type="sequence" clef="bass" meter="4/4">
    0.5 B3  0.2 1.5
    2   D4  0.2 1
    3   F#4 0.2 1
    4   E4  0.2 1
    5   D4  0.2 1
    6   B3  0.2 0.5
    6.5 G3  0.2 0.5
    <!--9   A3  0.2 1
    10  C4  0.2 1
    11  G4  0.2 1
    12  F#4 0.2 1
    13  C#4 0.2 2-->
    </scribe-music>

    <p>Or, with CSS that mapped <code>data-duration="5"</code> to 120
    <code>grid-template-columns</code> on <code>.bar</code>, the same stave
    could be given a time signature of 5/4:</p>

    <pre><code>
    &lt;div class="bass-stave bar" data-duration="5"&gt;...&lt;/div&gt;
    </code></pre>

    <scribe-music type="sequence" clef="bass" meter="5/4">
    0.5 B3  0.2 1.5
    2   D4  0.2 1
    3   F#4 0.2 1
    4   E4  0.2 1
    5   D4  0.2 1
    6   B3  0.2 0.5
    6.5 G3  0.2 0.5
    <!--9   A3  0.2 1
    10  C4  0.2 1
    11  G4  0.2 1
    12  F#4 0.2 1
    13  C#4 0.2 2-->
    </scribe-music>

    <p>Clearly I am glossing over a few details. Not everything is as simple as
    a class change, and a few stems and ledger lines need repositioned.</p>

    <p>Here's a stave class that remaps pitches entirely. General MIDI
    places drum and percussion voices on a bunch of notes in the bottom octaves
    of a keyboard, but those notes are not related to where drums are printed
    on a stave. In CSS a <code>drums-stave</code> class can be defined that maps
    those pitches to their correct rows:</p>

    <pre><code>
    &lt;div class="drums-stave bar" data-duration="4"&gt;...&lt;/div&gt;
    </code></pre>

    

    <pre><code>
    &lt;div class="percussion-stave bar" data-duration="4"&gt;...&lt;/div&gt;
    </code></pre>

    

    <p>That's some very readable drum notation. I'm pretty pleased with that.</p>

    <h3>Chords and lyrics</h3>

    <p>CSS Grid allows us to align other symbols inside the notation grid too.
    Chords and lyrics, dynamics and so on can be lined up with, and span, timed
    events:</p>

    <div>
        <div data-duration="4">

    <h3>But what about those beams?</h3>

    <p>Beams, chords and some of the longer rests are made to span columns by
    mapping their <code>data-duration</code> attributes to <code>grid-column-end</code>
    span values:</p>

    <pre><code>
    .stave &gt; [data-duration="0.25"] { grid-column-end: span 6; }
    .stave &gt; [data-duration="0.5"]  { grid-column-end: span 12; }
    .stave &gt; [data-duration="0.75"] { grid-column-end: span 18; }
    .stave &gt; [data-duration="1"]    { grid-column-end: span 24; }
    .stave &gt; [data-duration="1.25"] { grid-column-end: span 30; }
    ...
    </code></pre>

    <p>Simple as, bru.</p>

    <h3>Sizing</h3>

    <p>Lastly, the whole system is sized in <code>em</code>, so to scale it we
    simply change the <code>font-size</code>:</p>

    <scribe-music type="sequence" clef="treble">
        0   meter 2 1
        0   E4    1 0.5
        1   B4    1 0.5
        2   Bb4   1 2
    </scribe-music>

    <h3>Limits of Flex and Grid</h3>
    <p>Is it the perfect system? Honestly, I'm quietly gobsmacked that it works
    so well, but if we are looking for caveats… <strong>1.</strong> CSS cannot
    automatically position a new clef/key signature at the beginning of each
    wrapped line, or <strong>2.</strong> tie a head to a new head on a new line.
    And <strong>3.</strong>, angled beams are a whole story onto themselves;
    1/16th and 1/32nd note beams are hard to align because we cannot know precisely
    where their stems are until after the Grid has laid them out:</p>

    

    <p>So it's going to need a bit of tidy-up JavaScript to finish
    the job completely, but CSS shoulders the bulk of the layout work here, and
    that means far less layout work to do in JavaScript.</p>

        <h2><code>&lt;scribe-music&gt;</code></h2>
        <p>A custom element for rendering music</p>
    </header>

    

    <p>I have written an interpreter around this new CSS system and wrapped that up
    in the element <code>&lt;scribe-music&gt;</code>. It's nowhere near production-ready,
    but as it is already capable of rendering a <a href="https://stephen.band/scribe/dolphin-dance.html">responsive lead sheet</a>
    and notating drums I think it's interesting and useful.</p>

    <h3>Whazzitdo?</h3>

    <p>The <code>&lt;scribe-music&gt;</code> element renders music notation
    from data found in it's content:</p>

    <pre><code>
        &lt;scribe-music type="sequence"&gt;
            0 chord D maj 4
            0 F#5 0.2 4
            0 A4  0.2 4
            0 D4  0.2 4
        &lt;/scribe-music&gt;
    </code></pre>

    <scribe-music type="sequence" clef="treble">
        0 chord Dmaj 4
        0 F#5 0.2 4
        0 A4  0.2 4
        0 D4  0.2 4
    </scribe-music>

    <p>Or from a file fetched by its <code>src</code> attribute, such as this JSON:</p>

    <pre><code>
        &lt;scribe-music
            clef="drums"
            type="application/json"
            src="/static/blog/printing-music/data/caravan.json"&gt;
        &lt;/scribe-music&gt;
    </code></pre>

    <scribe-music type="application/json" clef="drums" src="/static/blog/printing-music/data/caravan.json"></scribe-music>

    <p>Or from a JS object set on the element's <code>.data</code> property.</p>
    <p>There's some basic documentation about all that in the <a href="https://github.com/stephband/scribe/">README</a>.</p>

    <h3>Try it out</h3>
    <p>You can try the current development build by importing these files in a web page:</p>
    <pre><code>
        &lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="https://stephen.band/scribe/scribe-music/module.css" /&gt;
        &lt;script type="module" src="https://stephen.band/scribe/scribe-music/module.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
    </code></pre>

    <p>As I said, it's in development. Asides from some immediate improvements I
    can make to Scribe 0.3, like tuning the autospeller, fixing the 1/16th-note
    beams and detecting and displaying tuplets, some longer-term features I would
    like to investigate are:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Support for <a href="https://www.smufl.org/fonts/">SMuFL fonts</a></strong> –
        changing the font used for notation symbols. So far I have not been able to display their
        extended character sets reliably cross-browser.</li>
        <li><strong>Support for nested sequences</strong> – enabling multi-part tunes.</li>
        <li><strong>Split-stave rendering</strong> – placing multiple parts on one stave. The mechanics for this are already half in place – the drums stave and piano stave currently auto-split by pitch.</li>
        <li><strong>Multi-stave rendering</strong> – placing multiple parts on multiple, aligned, staves.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>I leave you with a transposable lead sheet for Dolphin Dance, rendered by <code>&lt;scribe-music&gt;</code>:</p>

This paper tackles the challenge of high-quality, real-time rendering of large-scale scenes with millions of square meters. The recently proposed 3DGS has demonstrated exceptional rendering quality and speed, but it typically requires a large amount of Gaussian primitives to model complex 3D scenes in high fidelity. When users need to holistically view such scenes, the 3DGS model falls short in rendering excessive Gaussians in real time. To solve this issue, we propose a novel representation named Level of Gaussians (LoG) for efficiently rendering 3D scenes, inspired by the classical idea of levels of detail (LOD) in rendering: fine details are essential for close views but become redundant for distant views. We implement LoG as a tree structure storing Gaussians and devise a progressive training strategy to reconstruct it from images in an end-to-end manner, which also provides effective regularization and helps overcome the local minima. In the rendering phase, the optimal level of Gaussians is adaptively selected based on the viewer's distance and angle. Experiments show that our approach enables real-time and high-quality rendering of areas spanning millions of square meters, representing a significant advancement in rendering large-scale scenes.

          <h3>Method</h3>

          <p><img src="https://zju3dv.github.io/LoG_webpage/img/pipeline.jpg" width="100%"></p><p>
            (a) Our method models a 3D scene with levels of Gaussian primitives and stores them in a tree structure. For instance, the large green primitive within the blue frame at Level 0 is further represented by four smaller primitives within the blue frame at Level 1. 
            (b) Each node in this tree can be represented in greater detail by its several child nodes, thereby offering varying degrees of detail in representing the scene. 
            (c) During rendering, we traverse this tree to select the appropriate primitives that precisely represent the scene under the viewpoint. Specifically, we expand the tree until either the nodes have no child nodes or the diameter of each node is less than 1 pixel in image space. 
            This strategy avoids the need to use thousands of primitives to render a distant building, which typically occupies only a few pixels in an image, thereby significantly accelerating the rendering process.
