<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div dir="auto"><p><em><span>Welcome to BIG, a newsletter on the politics of monopoly power. If you’d like to sign up to receive issues over email, you can do so </span><a href="https://mattstoller.substack.com/subscribe" rel="">here</a><span>.</span></em></p><p><span>In 1879, anti-monopolist Henry George published </span><em>Progress and Poverty, </em><span>one of the most important books on the politics of industrialization</span><em>. </em><span>At the time, unparalleled technological progress through the deployment of railroads and telegraphs had generated massive wealth. But instead of broadly shared prosperity, Americans saw deep poverty in the midst of all the bounty. George asked why. In the tradition of Anglo-American land reformers, he concluded that the root cause of radical inequality was neither labor nor capital, but land. </span></p><p>George’s argument went as follows. While mankind could pool its labor and efforts to create a surfeit of new consumer goods, the amount of land - an input into everything - was fixed. Moreover, the value of land had no relationship to work. Simply owning a lot around which a city grew up meant you’d get rich, where if your lot remained in a sparsely populated area, you wouldn’t. Conversely, if you ran a business or a factory to help build that city, or lived in a rented apartment, your income would be increasingly sucked up by the landowner profiting from the value you created by operating or living there. It was the social community that generated the wealth of the landowner, not the landowner itself.</p><p>The result, George argued, was an entire rentier class of landowners, men who did nothing but grow fat on the backs of both capital and labor. The solution was to tax land, because such a tax, unlike taxes on incomes or tariffs, couldn’t be avoided. The book was a runaway bestseller, not just in America, but worldwide. Woodrow Wilson’s cabinet had many Georgeists, and the National Park system, among other American institutions, was shaped in part by it, as was in some ways the mid-20th century libertarian movement. The profession of economics formed in opposition to George’s popularity. There are still Georgeists today.</p><p><span>And indeed, George has a lot to teach us about one of the key drivers of inflation for the middle class - housing. While inflation isn’t as high as it was in 2022, prices are still the number one concern for voters. And it’s not hard to see why. Yesterday, the Bureau of Labor Statistics came out with </span><a href="https://www.bls.gov/news.release/cpi.nr0.htm" rel="">inflation</a><span> statistics, showing that though price aren’t going up as fast, costs are still rising, especially in a category of something everyone needs. “The index for shelter rose 0.4 percent in July,” wrote the Bureau of Labor Statistics, “accounting for nearly 90 percent of the monthly increase in the all items index.” That’s… a lot.</span></p><p><span>Prices for housing are already at a record high, because of a pervasive long-term structural housing shortage in America. Since 2022, interest rates have increased, so homeowners with a locked in low mortgage rate don’t want to sell their homes and move, the result being fewer existing homes on the market. One would think that the response would simply be to build more housing, especially on the cheap end. And yet, that’s not happening.

One reason, posited by a noisy group who self-identify as “YIMBY’s,” which stands for “yes in my backyard,” argue there are too many local rules limiting development put forward by annoying people that want to maintain the local character and high housing values of their neighborhood by keeping others out. And yet, just pointing at over-regulation in and of itself isn’t a satisfying explanation. After all, the collapse in housing starts really began in 2007, and it hasn’t rebounded. Something is wrong with the market, as price signals aren’t working.</p><p><span>To understand what is going on, the low output of housing production in the face of high demand, let’s start with a slide in the </span><a href="https://investor.drhorton.com/~/media/Files/D/D-R-Horton-IR/reports-and-presentations/presentations/q3-2024-investor-presentation.pdf" rel="">most recent investor presentation</a><span> from the number one homebuilder in America, D.R.

Horton sold a record number of homes, it </span><a href="https://www.annualreports.com/HostedData/AnnualReportArchive/d/NYSE_DHI_2005.pdf" rel="">made</a><span> $1.47 billion. In 2023, when it built roughly half as many, its </span><a href="https://investor.drhorton.com/~/media/Files/D/D-R-Horton-IR/press-release/q4-2023-press-release.pdf" rel="">profit</a><span> was a little over three times as high, or $4.7 billion. And this dynamic isn’t because it focused on the high end, its overall market share was twice as high in 2023!</span></p><p><span>D.R. Horton isn’t some anomaly, it’s the market leader, along with Lennar, PulteGroup, Toll Brothers, and NVR, who round out the top five. In fact, these firms have gained so much pricing power and margin that Warren Buffett, who prefers purchasing firms with what he calls a competitive “moat,” aka market power, </span><a href="https://www.ft.com/content/ad109048-15d2-4f5d-b2b5-8d4335ffb809" rel="">recently bought</a><span> stakes in D.R. Horton, Lennar, and NVR.</span></p><p><span>The story here, in other words, is consolidation. In 1994, the ten largest builders </span><a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/BL-REB-33923" rel="">had</a><span> just 10% of the national market. By 2018, the top ten builders had a little less than a third. Partly this consolidation is due to a credit crunch. During the financial crisis from 2007-2012, 55% of residential developers disappeared. There were also post-crisis mergers, like </span><a href="https://www.pultegroupinc.com/investor-relations/press-releases/press-release-details/2009/Pulte-and-Centex-to-Merge-Creating-Americas-Largest-Homebuilding-Company/default.aspx" rel="">Pulte Homes and Centex</a><span>, </span><a href="https://investors.lennar.com/press-releases/2017/10-30-2017-100017044" rel="">Lennar and CalAtlantic</a><span>, </span><a href="https://investor.weyerhaeuser.com/2013-11-04-Weyerhaeuser-To-Combine-Its-Homebuilding-And-Real-Estate-Development-Business-WRECO-With-Tri-Pointe-Homes" rel="">Tri Pointe and Weyerhauser</a><span>, and so forth, but many of the acquisitions these days are smaller roll-ups, like D.R. Horton </span><a href="https://investor.drhorton.com/news-and-events/press-releases/2022/12-15-2022-211524312" rel="">buying</a><span> an Arkansas specialty builder Riggins Custom Homes, Gulf Coast builder </span><a href="https://investor.drhorton.com/news-and-events/press-releases/2023/07-05-2023-130058264" rel="">Truland Homes</a><span>, or </span><a href="https://investor.drhorton.com/news-and-events/press-releases/2017/06-29-2017-134504859" rel="">lot developer Forestar Group</a><span>, or Lennar </span><a href="https://investors.lennar.com/press-releases/2017/02-10-2017-144502031" rel="">acquiring</a><span> developer WCI Communities. Analysts are projecting 2024 to be another strong year for M&amp;A. </span></p><p><span>Of course, such numbers understate consolidation; national shares matter very little, since housing is local, and concentration is higher when you get to local levels. In Miami-Fort Lauderdale, </span><a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/HW_Assets/Marketing/BD/0324_BD_LocalLeader_Download_ONLINE.pdf" rel="">for instance</a><span>, Lennar has 47% of the market for new homes, in Los Angeles, D.R. Horton has about a third. As economist Luis Quintero </span><a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3303984" rel="">noted</a><span> in a paper, 60% of local markets are now “highly concentrated,” a new phenomenon. In 25 of the top 82 markets, one builder </span><a href="https://jbrec.com/insights/new-antitrust-regulations-impact-home-builder-mergers-and-acquisitions/" rel="">controls</a><span> at least 25% of the market. That’s </span><a href="https://www.futurity.org/buying-a-house-real-estate-2973222-2/" rel="">60% of the housing</a><span> markets in “Virginia, Maryland, Delaware, New Jersey, New York, and western Pennsylvania.”</span></p><p>D.R.

And more importantly, why hasn’t the number of builders bounced back? If margins are up, why aren’t there new entrants coming in to take profit and share? To answer this question I started by reading a bunch of investor documents from the big homebuilders. And I realized that to call these businesses “homebuilders” is misleading. It’s striking how little of their business has to do with, well, building. For instance, here’s D.R. Horton </span><a href="https://investor.drhorton.com/~/media/Files/D/D-R-Horton-IR/reports-and-presentations/reports/2023-dhi-annual-report.pdf" rel="">in 2023</a><span>: “Substantially all of our land development and home construction work is performed by subcontractors.” Here’s Lennar </span><a href="https://investors.lennar.com/~/media/Files/L/Lennar-IR-V3/documents/annual-reports/2023-annual-report.pdf" rel="">in 2023</a><span>: “We use independent subcontractors for most aspects of land development and home construction.” I suspect most of the other big guys would say something similar. These aren’t builders, they are financiers that borrow cheaper than real developers and use that cheap credit to speculate in land, hiring contractors to do the work. They are, in other words, </span><em>middlemen.</em></p><p>These are large financial institutions that own a bunch of land which appreciates in value, and then build on it and sell homes. It can be quite risky, since they have to hold land on their books and that land can go down in value. But for the last fifteen years or so, it’s been a bull market.  </p><p><span>A centralized industrial structure for building is a new phenomenon in America. Homebuilding used to be decentralized, with hundreds of thousands of contractors. And to some extent, it still is. You can hire a contractor to build a house. However, smaller developers increasingly struggle, as going to a bank to borrow and start or grow a development is difficult. So is access to land. And that means that over the past three decades, the center of the industry, the construction of the starter home that millions of people need, has been centralized in the hands of a small number of players. As the Wall Street Journal </span><a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/fewer-home-builders-means-happier-home-builders-1494870894" rel="">reported</a><span> in 2017. “By the Commerce Department’s count,” wrote Justin Lahart, “there were about 368,000 construction firms operating in the U.S. as of 2014 (the last year with available data). That compares with about 530,000 in 2005, and is the lowest number on record going back to 1977.”</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F514700d1-df77-47cd-89e4-eb031bc49d98_763x388.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F514700d1-df77-47cd-89e4-eb031bc49d98_763x388.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F514700d1-df77-47cd-89e4-eb031bc49d98_763x388.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F514700d1-df77-47cd-89e4-eb031bc49d98_763x388.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F514700d1-df77-47cd-89e4-eb031bc49d98_763x388.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F514700d1-df77-47cd-89e4-eb031bc49d98_763x388.png" width="763" height="388" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/514700d1-df77-47cd-89e4-eb031bc49d98_763x388.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:388,&quot;width&quot;:763,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:56659,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" title="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F514700d1-df77-47cd-89e4-eb031bc49d98_763x388.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F514700d1-df77-47cd-89e4-eb031bc49d98_763x388.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F514700d1-df77-47cd-89e4-eb031bc49d98_763x388.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F514700d1-df77-47cd-89e4-eb031bc49d98_763x388.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p><span>The big homebuilders are clear about their advantages, which have nothing to do with operational efficiency. Here’s </span><a href="https://investor.drhorton.com/~/media/Files/D/D-R-Horton-IR/reports-and-presentations/reports/2023-dhi-annual-report.pdf" rel="">D.R. Horton</a><span>:</span></p><blockquote><p><span>“We believe that our national, regional and local scale of operations provides us with benefits that may not be available to the same degree to some other smaller homebuilders, such as </span><strong>greater access to and lower cost of capital due to our balance sheet strength and our lending and capital markets relationships</strong><span> and </span><strong>volume discounts and rebates from national, regional and local materials suppliers and lower labor rates from certain subcontractors</strong><span>.”</span></p></blockquote><p><span>Capital, construction supplies, and labor are all cheaper for the big guys. Neat trick. And then there’s land. “New builders also have to secure land to build on,” reported the WSJ, “which is difficult in areas where large builders have already secured the most attractive lots.” Large builders with access to capital can </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2019/10/17/economists-identify-an-unseen-force-holding-back-affordable-housing/" rel="">hold</a><span> land for long periods of time, especially in a period like the post-financial crisis era when the Fed held interest rates quite low. In May of this year, the CEO of Toll Brothers </span><a href="https://investors.tollbrothers.com/~/media/Files/T/TollBrothers-IR/documents/events/transcripts/2024/tol%20-%20transcript%20q2%202024.pdf" rel="">described</a><span> this dynamic to investors, discussing how their advantage in capital leads smaller players to sell out their land holdings.</span></p><blockquote><p>So, what we're actually seeing more from the smaller builders who are facing some capital crunch is land deals that they have tied up, they've processed approvals on, they thought about building homes on, they're having a hard time finding the regional banks to finance them. And while they can't make a full profit they would have made had they built homes, they can make a fair profit by flipping the land to us. And so, we're seeing quite a few deals like that out of the smaller, more local and regional builders.</p></blockquote><p><span>In other words, these middlemen are really all about financing. From 2008-2022, the Federal Reserve held interest rates at zero, which allowed those who could borrow to do so very cheaply. But of course, whether you could borrow makes all the difference in the world, as I noted when discussing </span><a href="https://www.thebignewsletter.com/p/the-cantillon-effect-why-wall-street" rel="">the Cantillon effect</a><span>. Big middlemen can borrow, whereas smaller players or new entrants cannot, so land ends up in the hands of those with strong balance sheets.</span></p><p><span>In 2022, the Fed raised rates, changing the industry. Big builders no longer want to hold billions of dollars of land on their balance sheet because financing costs have gone up. So what they’ve done is pay a financier, often private equity, to hold the land for them and take the risk of the land dropping in value, which is called a “land light” strategy. In return the financier gets a fee. Builders retain the right to buy the land back if they want it, through a “</span><a href="https://investor.forestar.com/assets/uploads/2024/08/6302024-Forestar-IR-Presentation.pdf" rel="">right of first offer</a><span>” contract.

Here’s Toll Brothers CEO Doug Yearley </span><a href="https://www.builderonline.com/land/builders-go-land-light-in-an-effort-to-improve-returns_o" rel="">a few years ago</a><span>:</span></p><blockquote><p><span>“We're doing significantly more third-party land banking where we assign a contract to a professional land banker, who then feeds us land back on an as-needed basis,” Yearley said. “And then, we're doing joint ventures with either Wall Street private equity or </span><strong>with our friends in the home building industry, the other builders.”</strong></p></blockquote><p>What exactly does that quote mean? I don’t know, but it seems kind of crazy that large homebuilders would be doing joint ventures with each other on land acquisition, when that could very easily lead to holding supply off the market and preventing smaller developers from competing to build cheaper homes. </p><p><span>More broadly, the story here is the differentiation of homebuilding into two different groups. The first are the financial middlemen who contract everything out and control the industry, buying cheap and hoarding land. The second are actual developers who want to build, but are boxed out because they can’t borrow money. I suspect that in this dynamic we might find an incentive for local overregulation. I don’t know much about the political strategy of the homebuilders, but it would be weird if they didn’t use such a competitive weapon. And we do see some elements of that, such as when D.R. Horton and its private equity partner Brookfield were </span><a href="https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/arizona-investigations/2020/11/05/d-r-horton-makes-top-bid-controversial-arizona-state-land-auction-east-valley/6167481002/" rel="">able to get valuable</a><span> underpriced land in Arizona because of their financing advantages.</span></p><p><span>Regardless, </span><a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3303984" rel="">the net effect</a><span> of consolidation of homebuilders is significant, estimated at keeping 150,000 new homes from being built every year, which is roughly $100 billion of construction. So what’s the solution?</span></p><p>Well, in this case, the answer is likely a combination of policy interventions. The most important is to equalize credit access for smaller and local developers. We should foster the creation of more local banks, or offer local subsidies or preferential treatment of local developers in buying public land. Another big part of this dynamic is a lack of knowledge. Policymakers and smaller developers need more information about who holds local land lots and who are the big builders, especially at a municipal or regional level. </p><p>There aren’t great sources of data for who holds undeveloped parcels off the market. Another is to impose land limitations to prevent land hoarding, or tax the land of lot developers so they don’t hold land off the market. Finally, the Federal Trade Commission and Antitrust Division have a loophole in their merger disclosure form, which is called the Hart Scott Rodino form, which allows big firms to avoid telling the Federal government when they make acquisitions of real estate. That’s a problem, considering the likelihood of consolidation.</p><p><span>Regardless, it’s important to move the discussion about housing away from the focus on local regulations, as this dynamic is clearly a national problem involving a market structure where price signals are not bringing in more supply, but are bringing higher margins to a small group of players. In some ways, the land monopoly is the very first monopoly America ever addressed, through the equal parsing out of land lots through the Northwest Ordinance in 1787. In the 1850s, Frederick Douglass </span><a href="https://jacobin.com/2020/02/frederick-douglass-accumulation-wealth-land-reformer#:~:text=We%20want%20no%20poor.,of%20their%20heaven%20descended%20right." rel="">ascribed</a><span> the cause of slavery as consolidation of “land monopoly” and called for “land limitation” in response. Many states today still have land limits on the books, though these are </span><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/bill-gates-north-dakota-farmland-purchase-derailed-depression-law-2022-7" rel="">often ignored</a><span>. Henry George, in other words, was just representing an American tradition. And it’s one we should take seriously.</span></p><p><span>Thanks for reading.

<p>
	Artists suing generative artificial intelligence art generators have cleared a major hurdle in a first-of-its-kind lawsuit over the uncompensated and unauthorized use of billions of images downloaded from the internet to train AI systems, with a federal judge allowing key claims to move forward.</p>



<p>
	U.S. District Judge William Orrick on Monday advanced all copyright infringement and trademark claims in a pivotal win for artists. He found that Stable Diffusion, Stability’s AI tool that can create hyperrealistic images in response to a prompt of just a few words, may have been “built to a significant extent on copyrighted works” and created with the intent to “facilitate” infringement. The order could entangle in the litigation any AI company that incorporated the model into its products.

	</p>






<p>
	Claims against the companies for breach of contract and unjust enrichment, plus violations of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act for removal of information identifying intellectual property, were dismissed. The case will move forward to discovery, where the artists could uncover information related to the way in which the AI firms harvested copyrighted materials that were then used to train large language models.

</p>



<p>
	Karla Ortiz, who <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/ai-art-generators-copyright-lawsuits-1235302611/">brought the lawsuit</a>, has worked on projects like <em>Black Panther</em>, <em>Avengers: Infinity War</em> and <em>Thor: Ragnarok</em> and is credited with coming up with the main character design for Doctor Strange. Amid the rise of AI tools in the production pipeline, concept artists like Ortiz are <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/ai-scraping-stealing-copyright-law-1235571501/">taking stock</a> of further displacement down the road if the tech advances and courts side with AI firms on certain intellectual property questions posed by the tools.</p>



<p>
	Widespread adoption of AI in the movie­making process will depend largely on how courts rule on novel legal issues raised by the tech. Among the few considerations holding back further deployment of the tech is the specter of a court ruling that the use of copyrighted materials to train AI systems constitutes copyright infringement. Another factor is that AI-generated works are not eligible for copyright protection.</p>



<p>
	The lawsuit, filed last year, revolves around the LAION data set, which was built using 5 billion images that were allegedly scraped from the internet and utilized by Stability and Runway to create Stable Diffusion. It implicated Midjourney, which trained its AI system using the model, as well as DeviantArt for using the model in DreamUp, an image generation tool.

	</p>




<p>
	On dismissal, Stability and Runway challenged the artists’ arguments that it induced copyright infringement and that the Stable Diffusion models are themselves infringing works. Under this theory, they induced infringement by distributing the models when any third-party uses the models provided by the company, exposing it to potentially massive damages.</p>



<p>
	Siding with artists, Orrick concluded that they sufficiently alleged that Stable Diffusion is built off of copyrighted material and that the “way the product operates necessarily invokes copies or protected elements of those works.” In a finding that could spell trouble for AI companies that used the model, he said that Stability and Runway could’ve promoted copyright infringement and that Stable Diffusion was “created to facilitate that infringement by design.”</p>



<p>
	When it <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/artists-copyright-infringement-case-ai-art-generators-1235632929/">dismissed</a> infringement claims last year, the court found that the theory of the case was “unclear” as to whether there are copies of training images stored in Stable Diffusion that are then utilized by DeviantArt and Midjourney. It pointed to the defense’s arguments that it’s impossible for billions of images “to be compressed into an active program,” like Stable Diffusion.</p>



<p>
	Following the dismissal, the artists amended one of the prongs of their lawsuit to claim that Midjourney separately trained its product on the LAION data set and that it incorporates Stable Diffusion into its own product.</p>



<p>
	In another loss for the AI companies, the court rebuffed arguments that the lawsuit must identify specific, individual works that each of the artists who filed the complaint alleges were used for training.&nbsp;

	</p>




<p>
	“Given the unique facts of this case — including the size of the LAION datasets and the nature of defendants’ products, including the added allegations disputing the transparency of the ‘open source’ software at the heart of Stable Diffusion — that level of detail is not required for plaintiffs to state their claims,” the order stated.</p>



<p>
	In a May hearing, DeviantArt warned that several other companies will be sued if the artists’ infringement claims against firms that simply utilized Stable Diffusion and had no part in creating it survives dismissal.</p>



<p>
	“The havoc that would be wreaked by allowing this to proceed against DeviantArt is hard to state,” said Andy Gass, a lawyer for the company. “Here, we really have an innumerable number of parties no differently situated than [us] that would be subject to a claim.”</p>



<p>
	Gass added that DeviantArt “didn’t develop any gen AI models” and that “all [it’s] alleged to have done is take StabilityAI’s Stable Diffusion model, download it, upload it and offer a version DreamUp to users.”</p>



<p>
	The court also stressed that Midjourney produced images similar to artists’ works when their names were used as prompts. This, along with claims that the company published images that incorporate plaintiffs’ names on its site showcasing the capability of its tool, served as the basis for allowing trademark claims to move forward. It said that whether a consumer would be misled by Stability’s actions into believing that artists endorsed its product can be tested at a later stage of the case.

	</p>




<p>
	In a thread on Discord, the platform where Midjourney operates, chief executive David Holz posted the names of roughly 4,700 artists he said that its AI tool can replicate. This followed Stability chief executive Prem Akkaraju saying that the company downloaded from the internet troves of images and compressed them in a way that can “re-create” any of those images.</p>



<p>
	In discovery, lawyers for the artists are expected to pursue information related to how Stability and Runway built Stable Diffusion and the LAION data set. They represent Sarah Andersen, Kelly McKernan and Ortiz, among several others.</p>

<p dir="auto">Using a combination of audio STFT, MFCC, and chroma features, with a Transformer model for timbre feature
modeling and high-level abstraction, this approach can maximize the avoidance of overfitting and underfitting
problems compared to using a single feature, and has better generalization capabilities. With a small amount of
data and minimal training, it can achieve better results.</p>

<p dir="auto">The model begins by processing the audio signal through a <code>U-Net</code>, which isolates the vocal track.
The vocal track is then simultaneously fed into <code>PitchNet</code> and <code>HuBERT</code> (Wav2Vec2). <code>PitchNet</code> is
responsible for extracting pitch features, while <code>HuBERT</code> captures detailed features of the vocals.</p>
<p dir="auto">The core of the model is <code>CombineNet</code>, which receives features from the <code>Features</code> module. This
module consists of three spectrograms: STFT, MFCC, and Chroma, each extracting different aspects
of the audio. These features are enhanced by the TimbreBlock before being passed to the Encoder.
During this process, noise is introduced via STFT transformation and combined with the features
before entering the Encoder for processing. The processed features are then passed to the Decoder,
where they are combined with the previous features to generate the final audio output.</p>
<p dir="auto"><code>CombineNet</code> is based on an encoder-decoder architecture and is trained to generate a mask that
is used to extract and replace the timbre, ultimately producing the final output audio.</p>
<p dir="auto">The entire AI-powered process is implemented in <code>run.py</code>, while the various network structure
models can be referenced in the <code>models</code> folder.</p>

<h2>Apple vs the "free market" (<a href="https://pluralistic.net/2024/08/15/private-law/#thirty-percent-vig">permalink</a>)</h2>
<p>Every artist, performer and creator on Patreon is about to get screwed out of 30% of their gross revenue, which will be diverted to Apple, the most valuable company on the planet. Apple contributes nothing to their work, but it will get to steal a third of their wages:</p>
<p><a href="https://news.patreon.com/articles/understanding-apple-requirements-for-patreon">https://news.patreon.com/articles/understanding-apple-requirements-for-patreon</a></p>
<p>How is this possible? Enshittification:</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2024/01/30/go-nuts-meine-kerle/#ich-bin-ein-bratapfel">https://pluralistic.net/2024/01/30/go-nuts-meine-kerle/#ich-bin-ein-bratapfel</a></p>
<p>Enshittification starts with companies being good to their end users. In this case, Apple made a high quality product – the Iphone and Ipad – and carefully tended to its App Store. That lured in a lot of customers, many of whom made owning an Apple device part of their very identity, as though buying a popular brand of consumer electronics made them part of an oppressed religious minority:</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2024/01/12/youre-holding-it-wrong/#if-dishwashers-were-iphones">https://pluralistic.net/2024/01/12/youre-holding-it-wrong/#if-dishwashers-were-iphones</a></p>
<p>At the same time, Apple was locking those users in, selling them media that they couldn't play on non-Apple devices and tying their use of a mobile phone to their email, two-factor authentication, family photos, working files and consumer credit. Apple also avidly participated in the expansion of "IP law," which is to say, "laws that let Apple control the conduct of its customers, critics and competitors":</p>
<p><a href="https://locusmag.com/2020/09/cory-doctorow-ip/">https://locusmag.com/2020/09/cory-doctorow-ip/</a></p>
<p>In particular, Apple fought for a bizarre and expansive understanding of Section 1201 of the 1998 Digital Millennium Copyright Act. That's a law that makes it a felony to help someone jailbreak a device, even if this doesn't lead to a single instance of copyright infringement. Once removing a digital lock becomes a crime, then Apple can make <em>anything</em> into a crime – if Apple designs your device so that doing something you desire requires disabling a lock, and then doing that thing becomes illegal.</p>
<p>For example, Apple designs its phones so that they won't accept new parts without a manufacturer-supplied unlock code. That means that even if you install an Apple part in your Apple phone, it won't work unless you get Apple's permission (not cheap!) to activate that part. This is called "parts pairing" and it's pure rent-seeking, and Oregon just outlawed it:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/27/24097042/right-to-repair-law-oregon-sb1596-parts-pairing-tina-kotek-signed">https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/27/24097042/right-to-repair-law-oregon-sb1596-parts-pairing-tina-kotek-signed</a></p>
<p>The reason Oregon had to ban parts-pairing is that bypassing parts-pairing is a felony under DMCA 1201, punishable by a five-year prison sentence and a $500,000 fine. That means you can't just buy a tool that some clever reverse-engineer made that fakes the parts-pairing code – not because this is technically impossible, but because it is very, very illegal.</p>
<p>DMCA 1201 gives Apple broad latitude to control how you can use your $1,000 phone. DMCA 1201 is why you can't just grab a little $0.99 dongle in the Walmart checkout line that jailbreaks your phone and lets you install a different app store. It's not against the law for an app author to sell you an app without Apple's blessing. It's not illegal for you to run an app you buy on your phone without Apple's blessing. But the <em>technical step</em> needed to let you run software you buy on a gadget you own is a felony, so all those activities become <em>de facto</em> felonies.</p>
<p>Jay Freeman calls this "felony contempt of business model" – but you could also call it "private law." In passing DMCA 1201, Congress said to companies like Apple, "Just add a digital lock to anything you make, and then you can create felonies out of thin air, which the US courts will prosecute on your behalf."</p>
<p>This is the Bizarro-world version of "Chevron deference," the idea that expert agencies, deputized by Congress to fairly and neutrally enforce the law, should have latitude to interpret Congressional intent. So, for example, even if Congress never <em>specifically</em> banned putting rat poison in kids' breakfast cereal, the FDA should still be allowed to make a "no strychnine in the Fruity Pebbles" rule. This is a common-sense proposition, but back in July, the Supreme Court killed it:</p>
<p><a href="https://prospect.org/justice/supreme-court-stages-coup-against-government-regulation/">https://prospect.org/justice/supreme-court-stages-coup-against-government-regulation/</a></p>
<p>So <em>regulators</em> are no longer allowed to regulate, but, thanks to DMCA 1201, corporations can just make up rules out of thin air and give them the force of both criminal and civil statute. The government can't govern, but corporations can.</p>
<p>The fact that it's a felony to get your Iphone apps from anyone except Apple means that whatever policies Apple makes for the app store have the force of law. Apple's pristine execution of stage one of enshittification – luring in users, then locking those users in – mean that businesses can't survive without reaching Apple customers, and they can't reach Apple customers without abiding by the app store's rules.</p>
<p>Remember when Tumblr banned pornography? It was a bizarre shitshow, especially given how important non-heteronormative, non-vanilla porn had been to Tumblr. To many Tumblr users, this looked like a rehash of the old pattern: get big by courting adult performers and sex workers, then kick the people who built your platform to the curb once you've attained scale.</p>
<p>There's a lot of truth to that: under Yahoo and Verizon's ownership, Tumblr clearly didn't give a damn about its users, <em>especially</em> the sex workers (and that went double for the world of queer sex). But even after Tumblr was bought by WordPress, and even after WordPress did its best to restore <em>some</em> adult content to the platform, Tumblr still remains heavily moderated and heavily censored. Why? Because Apple kept kicking Tumblr out of the App Store on the basis that it contained sexual material, and without Apple users, Tumblr was dead in the water:</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2022/09/29/go-nuts-show-nuts/#chokepoints">https://pluralistic.net/2022/09/29/go-nuts-show-nuts/#chokepoints</a></p>
<p>This is Apple's "private law" – Apple is using its "IP" (DMCA 1201, which lets it prevent its customers from choosing rival app stores) to reach beyond the walls of its own offices and into the offices of Tumblr, dictating Tumblr's standards for sexually explicit material. Apple claims this is merely a matter of "editorial standards," no different from a bookstore deciding not to shelve pornography. The difference is that in this case, Apple can block you from patronizing another bookstore, by forcing you to forfeit the $1,000 you spent on your device and potentially many thousands more in media and data and other switching costs.</p>
<p>But that's not the end of Apple's ability to regulate the market. Apple doesn't enforce its ban on adult content equally. If Tumblr allows adult content, it gets kicked out of the app store. But Apple chooses not to enforce its sexual material ban against Reddit or Twitter, where the policy is "go nuts, show nuts." Apple's choosing the winners and the losers here, creating the "market distortion" that conservatives warn us against.</p>
<p>Which brings me back to Patreon. Apple's content-based rules are mere ornaments on Apple's core market-structuring activity. The main event is Apple's 30% App Store Tax. Apple skims a 30% vig off the price of the apps you buy, <em>and</em> everything you buy in them:</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2024/03/22/reality-distortion-field/#three-trillion-here-three-trillion-there-pretty-soon-youre-talking-real-money">https://pluralistic.net/2024/03/22/reality-distortion-field/#three-trillion-here-three-trillion-there-pretty-soon-youre-talking-real-money</a></p>
<p>This is a <em>shocking</em> payment processing fee. For comparison, the highly concentrated credit-card sector charges 2-5% to process a payment – a tenth of Apple's charge. What's more, that 2-5% credit card fee is considered to be <em>extremely high</em> (it's gone up 40% since covid started). Apple backstops this payment rule with more content-based rules: app vendors may not send customers to the web to complete their payments through a regular website with a 2-5% fee. Users have to figure this out for themselves.</p>
<p>Again, Apple picks winners and losers in this market. Not every app has to pay this fee – for example, Uber is exempted from it. But smaller ridehailing apps – say, one created by a driver co-op – gets soaked for the full amount, meaning that it can't possibly compete against Uber. Apple is effectively crowning Uber the perpetual overlord of ride-hailing apps.</p>
<p>Apple also uses this market regulating power to scoop up parts of the market for itself. Apple directly competes with many of its vendors, selling books, music, videos, audiobooks and other digital media, as well as email, mass storage, photo storage, etc. Apple's rivals have to kick a 30% vig up to the Apple Crime Family, but Apple exempts itself from those fees. Again, Apple is picking the winner in the market – itself.</p>
<p>It's not just businesses that compete with Apple that get wiped out by Apple's position as de facto supreme planner of the economy. Many businesses simply can't exist in a world in which 30% of their revenue is creamed off by another business. For that matter, <em>Apple</em> couldn't survive under that regime. As Slashdot's theodp writes, Apple netted $97b on revenues of $383b last year. If Apple had to pay a 30% app store tax on that gross revenue, it would be down $115b, for a net <em>loss</em> of $18b:</p>
<p><a href="https://apple.slashdot.org/story/24/08/13/1439258/ask-slashdot-could-apple-survive-if-it-had-to-pay-a-30-apple-tax?sbsrc=md">https://apple.slashdot.org/story/24/08/13/1439258/ask-slashdot-could-apple-survive-if-it-had-to-pay-a-30-apple-tax?sbsrc=md</a></p>
<p>Here we have Apple as the fully unfurled regulator of the digital economy. Apple decides what kinds of businesses are prohibited, based on three criteria:</p>
<p>I. Does Apple want to compete with them?</p>
<p>II. Do they carry sexually explicit material <em>without</em> being Twitter or Reddit?</p>
<p>III. Are they an otherwise viable business that doesn't have an extra 30% margin they can afford to give away to Apple?</p>
<p>Apple doesn't oppose regulation; Apple <em>loves</em> regulation, so long as they're the ones doing the regulating. They want to be able to shape and define the digital market, backed by the power of the state, but <em>without</em> any <em>input</em> from the state. In modern corporate orthodoxy, the state is an enforcer for corporate will.</p>
<p>That's the animating force behind "binding arbitration" waivers, the now-ubiquitous contract terms that require you to give up your right to sue no matter what the other party does to you. These waivers are in your phone contract, your employment contract, your travel tickets, your concert tickets, your doctor's office forms, and the terms for most services:</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2022/06/12/hot-coffee/#mcgeico">https://pluralistic.net/2022/06/12/hot-coffee/#mcgeico</a></p>
<p>By forcing you to click "OK" to a binding arbitration waiver, corporations transform the courts from entities that interpret and enforce the law to entities that force the public to surrender every right and protection Congress ever gave them, in favor of the unilateral decisions of a corporate arbitrator paid by the company that wronged them.</p>
<p>This is more private law – the state existing as an enforcer for the whims and fiat of corporate strategists. It's a terribly neat illustration of Wilhoit's law, "Conservatism consists of exactly one proposition, to wit: There must be in-groups whom the law protects but does not bind, alongside out-groups whom the law binds but does not protect":</p>
<p><a href="https://crookedtimber.org/2018/03/21/liberals-against-progressives/#comment-729288">https://crookedtimber.org/2018/03/21/liberals-against-progressives/#comment-729288</a></p>
<p>Just like the digital locks lurking in your Iphone, you are subject to thousands of unseen and unsuspected binding arbitration waivers buried deep in fine print you have never read. You will only discover the existence of these waivers when you are horribly wronged, whereupon the company that hurt you will produce the waiver and force you to surrender your legal right to redress.</p>
<p>The latest example of this is the viral story of a lawsuit brought against Disney by the widower of a doctor who died at Walt Disney World after being fed a meal containing allergens that she had been assured would not be present in her food:</p>
<p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/08/disney-fighting-restaurant-death-suit-with-disney-terms-absurd-lawyer-says/">https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/08/disney-fighting-restaurant-death-suit-with-disney-terms-absurd-lawyer-says/</a></p>
<p>Disney has filed a motion seeking to have the widower's case dismissed because he signed up for a free trial of the Disney+ streaming service, and in so doing, "agreed" to permanently give up his right to sue Disney for <em>anything</em>:</p>
<p><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/2024-05-31-Defendant-Walt-Disney-Parks-and-Resorts-Motion-to-Compel-Arbitration-and-Stay-Case.pdf">https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/2024-05-31-Defendant-Walt-Disney-Parks-and-Resorts-Motion-to-Compel-Arbitration-and-Stay-Case.pdf</a></p>
<p>This is every bit as much market-structuring conduct as Apple's insistence that only Patreon performers who have an extra 30% in their monthly payments can go on making art. Liability rules – like a rule that makes corporations liable if they kill you by feeding you allergens they've promised not to feed you – are a key part of how we structure markets. By allowing customers who've been wronged, cheated or harmed to seek financial compensation in civil court, Congress created a system of incentives designed to shape the conduct of firms (the alternative is the prohibitively expensive prospect of having on-site round-the-clock inspectors, a measure reserved for a few sensitive industries like meat-packing plants, and, in a wildly imperfect fashion, Boeing).</p>
<p>When a company unilaterally removes your ability to access the courts – while preserving its own right to have the courts force you to seek justice from its arbitrators – they incinerate every regulation, every law, and replace it with "whatever we feel like." The law protects them, it binds you.</p>
<p>We live in the felony contempt of business model dystopia, where multinational corporations decide which laws apply and when; and where they get to decide who can be in business, and what kind of business they can do.</p>

<h3>Galois Theory</h3>

<h4>Posted by Tom Leinster</h4>

<p><a href="http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/~distler/blog/mathml.html" onclick="window.open(this.href, 'MathML', 'width=310,height=150,scrollbars=no,resizable=yes,status=no'); return false;" onkeypress="if(window.event.keyCode == 13){window.open(this.href, 'MathML', 'width=310,height=150,scrollbars=no,resizable=yes,status=no'); return false;}"><img src="https://golem.ph.utexas.edu/~distler/blog/images/MathML.png" alt="MathML-enabled post (click for more details)." title="MathML-enabled post (click for details)."></a></p>

<p>I’ve just <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07499">arXived</a> my notes for
Edinburgh’s undergraduate Galois theory course, which I taught from 2021 to
2023.</p>

<p>I first shared the notes on my website some time ago. But it took me a
while to arXiv them, because I wanted to simultaneously make public most
of the other course materials. I now have, which means <a href="https://www.maths.ed.ac.uk/~tl/galois">the following are
now available to all</a>:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Notes forming a complete, self-contained account of the part of Galois
theory that we covered.</p></li>
<li><p>About 40 short explanatory videos.</p></li>
<li><p>A large collection of problems.</p></li>
<li><p>Nearly 500 multiple choice questions.</p></li>
</ul>


<div id="more">
<p><a href="http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/~distler/blog/mathml.html" onclick="window.open(this.href, 'MathML', 'width=310,height=150,scrollbars=no,resizable=yes,status=no'); return false;" onkeypress="if(window.event.keyCode == 13){window.open(this.href, 'MathML', 'width=310,height=150,scrollbars=no,resizable=yes,status=no'); return false;}"><img src="https://golem.ph.utexas.edu/~distler/blog/images/MathML.png" alt="MathML-enabled post (click for more details)." title="MathML-enabled post (click for details)."></a></p>

<p>I’m a little bemused by the popularity of the Galois theory notes. I’ve
made quite a few sets of course notes public before, e.g.:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.maths.ed.ac.uk/~tl/fa/fa_notes.pdf">Fourier analysis</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.maths.ed.ac.uk/~tl/topology/topology_notes.pdf">General topology</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.maths.ed.ac.uk/~tl/aa/aa.pdf">Linear algebra</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.maths.ed.ac.uk/~tl/bct">Category theory</a></li>
</ul>

<p>But the Galois theory notes seem to have caught on in a way that none of
the others have (except category theory — but that one, I made into a
book). </p>

<p>It’s true that I probably took a bit of extra care on them: I first taught
the course during full Covid lockdown, and I felt the students would
need more guidance than usual, given that they were deprived of all
opportunities for face-to-face interaction. But I wonder whether the real
reason is that the Galois theory notes simply <em>look</em> nicer, with colour and
little icons and so on. </p>

<p>In any case, I hope the <a href="https://www.maths.ed.ac.uk/~tl/galois">notes, videos and
questions</a> bring people joy.</p>

After years of legal proceedings, New Zealand Justice Minister Paul Goldsmith has approved Kim Dotcom's extradition to the United States. The Megaaupload founder faces criminal copyright infringement, racketeering, and money laundering charges, which in theory could lead to decades in prison. Dotcom says he has a plan and doesn't intend to leave the country.

<p>While time moved on, the New Zealand-based ‘Internet personality’ was still waiting to hear whether he would be extradited to the United States where a criminal prosecution is pending.</p>
<p>With the stakes this high, no legal resources are being spared. Many <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/nz-government-lawyers-spent-40500-hours-battling-kim-dotcom-and-megaupload-210216/">millions of dollars</a> have been poured into this legal battle since 2012, and the end is still nowhere in sight.</p>
<p>In 2020, the Supreme Court of New Zealand <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/kim-dotcom-can-be-extradited-to-the-united-states-subject-to-judicial-review-201104/">ruled</a> that Kim Dotcom and his colleagues could indeed be extradited to the United States. However, this still wasn’t set in stone, as judicial reviews and appeals were still pending. </p>
<p>Megaupload defendants van der Kolk and Ortmann eventually opted for a deal. The pair pled guilty but were allowed to serve their respective <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/former-megaupload-executives-sentenced-to-2-5-years-in-prison-230615/">30 and 31-month prison sentences</a> in New Zealand. Dotcom, meanwhile, vowed to <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/megaupload-pair-sign-deal-to-avoid-extradition-dotcom-vows-to-fight-on-220510/">‘fight on’</a>. </p>
<p>“I’m now the last man standing in this fight and I will continue to fight because unlike my co-defendants I won’t accept the injustice we have been subjected to,” Dotcom said two years ago.</p>
<h2>Justice Minister Signs Dotcom Extradition</h2>
<p>In recent years, Dotcom hasn’t shied away from the public eye, often sharing controversial takes on political and societal events. In the background, however, potential extradition loomed, before reaching its conclusion earlier today.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.stuff.co.nz/politics/350380271/justice-minister-signs-kim-doctoms-extradition-order">Stuff</a>, New Zealand Justice Minister Paul Goldsmith informed Kim Dotcom that he will be deported to the United States to stand trial. </p>
<p>“I have received extensive advice from the Ministry of Justice on this matter,” Goldsmith said. “I considered all of the information carefully, and have decided that Mr Dotcom should be surrendered to the US to face trial.”</p>
<p>“As is common practice, I have allowed Mr Dotcom a short period of time to consider and take advice on my decision. I will not, therefore, be commenting further at this stage,” the Justice Minister added.</p>
<p>Dotcom has always denied the charges and has left no stone unturned in support of his defense. This means that the latest extradition decision will be challenged as well.</p>
<h2>‘I Have a Plan’</h2>
<p>The Ministry of Justice confirmed the extradition order earlier today. Dotcom revealed the decision on social media earlier in the week, describing New Zealand as an “obedient U.S. colony”. </p>
<p>“[T]he obedient US colony in the South Pacific just decided to extradite me for what users uploaded to Megaupload, unsolicited, and what copyright holders were able to remove with direct delete access instantly and without question. But who cares? That’s justice these days,” he wrote on Tuesday. </p>
<p>Today, Dotcom <a href="https://x.com/KimDotcom/">followed up</a>, stating that he has “a plan,” “loves New Zealand,” and doesn’t intend to leave the country. </p>
<center><em>A Plan…</em></center><br><center><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://torrentfreak.com/images/dotcom-plan.jpg" alt="dotcom plan" width="600" height="342" srcset="https://torrentfreak.com/images/dotcom-plan.jpg 972w, https://torrentfreak.com/images/dotcom-plan-300x171.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px"></center>
<p>The nature of Dotcom’s plan is unknown but if the past twelve years are any indication, he won’t let any adverse decision pass without a fight. </p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p><span>Comment</span> After more than 15 years of insisting that "competition is only a click away," Google's antitrust mantra is no longer keeping the regulators at bay.</p>
<p>Back in 2013, Google escaped unscathed from a US Federal Trade Commission probe when the watchdog agency <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/04/technology/google-agrees-to-changes-in-search-ending-us-antitrust-inquiry.html">closed</a> its investigation without bringing charges. Its other run-ins with competition cops around the world have been similarly inconsequential. There have been fines, but they've been immaterial.</p>
<p>In the past eight months, however, Google has lost two major US competition lawsuits: One brought by <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/12/12/epic_v_google_epic_wins/">Epic Games</a> over Google's grip on the Android ecosystem, the other brought by the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/08/05/google_default_search_deals_violate/">Department of Justice</a> over the Big G's market-dominating search advertising business.</p>

    

<p>In the Epic Games case this week, the FTC – emboldened under boss Lina Khan – <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/08/13/ftc_google_android_monopoly/">urged the judge</a> to consider an appropriate remedy and ignore Google's fretting about the potential cost of compliance.</p>

        


        

<p>And in the DoJ's search advertising case, the focus has also turned to possible remedies, now that Google has been declared an unlawful monopolist.</p>
<p>The Chocolate Factory has <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/transactional/google-asks-judge-overturn-epic-games-antitrust-verdict-2024-02-02/">appealed</a> the Epic verdict and also plans to challenge the DoJ's victory.</p>

        

<p>However, given the EU's <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_23_3207">preliminary findings</a> in 2023 that Google violated antitrust laws with its advertising practices, and a separate trial this September over Justice Department <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-sues-google-monopolizing-digital-advertising-technologies">allegations</a> about Google's ad tech operations, it's looking increasingly unlikely the search giant will survive in its current form or with its current arrangements.</p>
<p>Reports <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/13/technology/google-monopoly-antitrust-justice-department.html">suggest</a> American prosecutors working on the search advertising case have been discussing remedies including a corporate breakup, to present at a September 6 hearing. These measures include possibly slicing off Chrome and Android from Google into separate entities; forcing the internet giant to ditch its exclusive deals that make it the default search engine on devices and in browsers; and/or making it share data with rivals.</p>
<p>Jason Kint, CEO for trade group Digital Content Next, told <em>The Register</em> that with regard to the DoJ's search advertising case, "Forced divestiture of Chrome and Android I think are both on the table for sure."</p>

        

<p>"What the judge made clear was that they [Google] have an overwhelming monopoly in search," said Kint. "And they've abused it."</p>
<p>If the pending separate ad tech trial – which covers the backend auction part of Google's ad business – goes the same way as the search one, Google's DoubleClick business, or a related piece of ad auction infrastructure, could be on the chopping block.</p>
<p>One of the central issues in the DoJ's search ads case is the payments Google makes to Apple and Mozilla to be the default search engine in Safari and Firefox. If those go away, there will be blood – not just for Google but also for Apple and Mozilla.</p>
<p>Apple would have to find other revenue to replace roughly $20 billion in annual payments from Google. That might encourage the iBiz to compete with Google – by building its own search engine, or acquiring one. Mozilla, already <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/06/18/mozilla_buys_anonym_betting_privacy/">showing interest</a> in the ad business, might be pushed further in that direction – an outcome unlikely to appeal to the anti-commercial portion of its constituency.</p>
<p>A fitting though unlikely outcome would be for Google to be forced to turn Chrome and the open source Chromium project over to Mozilla. That would probably involve the creation of an independent non-profit foundation that didn't reduce browser diversity – so Chrome and Firefox could continue to lead independent lives.</p>

</ul>
<p>Chrome could also be operated as a for-profit business, but revenue generation might be an issue – netizens expect browsers to be free, so we'd be back to default search deals and selling information to advertisers.</p>
<p>The possibility of forcing the divestiture of Android is also intriguing – but it's unclear how Android development and app distribution would work if starved of Google's monopoly money.</p>
<p>It's worth asking whether any of Google's peers – Amazon, Apple, Meta, or Microsoft – could turn Android or Chrome into a business that better served the public. The answer is almost certainly not. After all, each of these giants also faces ongoing antitrust scrutiny. And each of them would probably look for ways to make Chrome or Android more extractive.</p>

<p>There's a real risk that a poorly targeted remedy would just allow some other data predator to thrive, or would degrade the overall ecosystem – as happened when wolves were <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.yellowstonepark.com/things-to-do/wildlife/wolf-reintroduction-changes-ecosystem/">removed</a> from Yellowstone. Imagine a Meta operating Google Play, and what the privacy disclosures would look like then.</p>
<p>The problem is that software platforms need regulation tuned to their specific abuses. Operating a software (or e-commerce) platform is similar to operating a shopping mall, except that platform landlords can impose arbitrary terms on tenants that would never fly in the physical world. In the tech industry, a platform is simply a vehicle for unfair competition – see the FTC <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2023/09/ftc-sues-amazon-illegally-maintaining-monopoly-power">allegations against Amazon</a>.</p>
<p>Say someone opens a shop selling maps and it proves popular. As the platform landlord, you may decide you too want to run a map shop. It would be a petty thing to do to a shop owner whose efforts and presence add value to your mall, but there's no law against it.</p>
<div><p><img src="https://regmedia.co.uk/2024/08/06/shutterstock_ublock_origin_reaper.jpg?x=174&amp;amp;y=115&amp;amp;crop=1" width="174" height="115" alt="Grim reaper by the uBlock Origin logo"></p><h2 title="Will you see the Lite?">Chrome Web Store warns end is nigh for uBlock Origin</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/08/06/chrome_web_store_warns_end/"><span>JUST FYI</span></a></p></div>
<p>And if your tenant's shop is doing better, you can rearrange the mall layout to make that shop harder to find while you move your own shop to the entryway where everyone will see it. Or you may decide to impose some arbitrary contractual rule that gives you an advantage. Perhaps you'll implement private APIs that make your maps function better while not allowing your tenant to use those APIs. Maybe you'll choose to charge a commission that makes it hard for the tenant to be profitable.</p>
<p>Such self-preferencing is common on software platforms, when it would cause an outcry or a lawsuit in an actual mall.</p>
<p>Forcing Google to divest Chrome or Android may help – but whatever remedy is imposed, it needs to also address self-preferencing, just as Europe's Digital Markets Act has done for designated gatekeepers. Platform owners should be forbidden from favoring their own services and competing unfairly with platform tenants. ®</p>

<p>Jason Snell, writing at Six Colors:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The App Store is littered with Markdown text editors, but not all
Markdown implementations are created equal. I expect my Markdown
editor to show me every single keystroke I enter, which means any
attempt to hide hyperlinks will be met with immediate rejection.
(Sorry, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ulysses/id1225571038">Ulysses</a> and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/craft-docs-and-notes-editor/id1487937127">Craft</a>.) I do appreciate syntax coloring
and styling where appropriate — so that bolded text is bolded,
and headings are prominent… so long as the app doesn’t swallow the
markup that makes them so.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Maybe I don’t know much about Markdown, but my understanding is that the whole point of it is to provide a syntax where the most common HTML tags for prose can be replaced by simple punctuation characters that are <em>meant</em> to be visible to the writer. I want to see the characters so I know I’ll get exactly the HTML output I think I’m going to get, but those punctuation characters shouldn’t distract from the readability of the prose. I created Markdown to use in <a href="https://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/">BBEdit</a> without any syntax coloring at all, and to this day, I do most of my Markdown editing in <a href="https://redsweater.com/marsedit/">MarsEdit</a>, which doesn’t color or style Markdown syntax at all. (It should though! Markdown is even better with some syntax coloring and styling.)</p>

<p>I have no idea why there are now apps that use Markdown as their back end storage format but only show styled text without the Markdown source code visible. <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/03/05/hey-world-goes-live">Hey World</a>, for example, gets this right: they just do simple WYSIWYG editing where bold is bold, italic is italic, and links look like links and the linked URL is edited in a popup. If you want WYSIWYG, do WYSIWYG. If you want Markdown, show the Markdown. Trust me, it’s meant to be shown.</p>

<p dir="auto">Off-grid, resilient mesh communication with strong encryption, forward secrecy and extreme privacy.</p>
<p dir="auto"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/markqvist/NomadNet/raw/master/docs/screenshots/1.png"><img src="https://github.com/markqvist/NomadNet/raw/master/docs/screenshots/1.png" alt="Screenshot"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Nomad Network allows you to build private and resilient communications platforms that are in complete control and ownership of the people that use them. No signups, no agreements, no handover of any data, no permissions and gatekeepers.</p>
<p dir="auto">Nomad Network is build on <a href="https://github.com/markqvist/LXMF">LXMF</a> and <a href="https://github.com/markqvist/Reticulum">Reticulum</a>, which together provides the cryptographic mesh functionality and peer-to-peer message routing that Nomad Network relies on. This foundation also makes it possible to use the program over a very wide variety of communication mediums, from packet radio to fiber optics.</p>
<p dir="auto">Nomad Network does not need any connections to the public internet to work. In fact, it doesn't even need an IP or Ethernet network. You can use it entirely over packet radio, LoRa or even serial lines. But if you wish, you can bridge islanded networks over the Internet or private ethernet networks, or you can build networks running completely over the Internet. The choice is yours. Since Nomad Network uses Reticulum, it is efficient enough to run even over <em>extremely</em> low-bandwidth medium, and has been succesfully used over 300bps radio links.</p>
<p dir="auto">If you'd rather want to use an LXMF client with a graphical user interface, you may want to take a look at <a href="https://github.com/markqvist/sideband">Sideband</a>, which is available for Linux, Android and macOS.</p>

<p dir="auto">The easiest way to install Nomad Network is via pip:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="# Install Nomad Network and dependencies
pip install nomadnet

# Run the client
nomadnet

# Or alternatively run as a daemon, with no user interface
nomadnet --daemon

<span><span>#</span> List options</span>
nomadnet --help</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">If you are using an operating system that blocks normal user package installation via <code>pip</code>, you can return <code>pip</code> to normal behaviour by editing the <code>~/.config/pip/pip.conf</code> file, and adding the following directive in the <code>[global]</code> section:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="[global]
break-system-packages = true"><pre lang="text"><code>[global]

<p dir="auto"><strong>Please Note</strong>: If this is the very first time you use pip to install a program on your system, you might need to reboot your system for the program to become available. If you get a "command not found" error or similar when running the program, reboot your system and try again.</p>
<p dir="auto">The first time the program is running, you will be presented with the <strong>Guide section</strong>, which contains all the information you need to start using Nomad Network.</p>
<p dir="auto">To use Nomad Network on packet radio or LoRa, you will need to configure your Reticulum installation to use any relevant packet radio TNCs or LoRa devices on your system. See the <a href="https://markqvist.github.io/Reticulum/manual/interfaces.html" rel="nofollow">Reticulum documentation</a> for info. For a general introduction on how to set up such a system, take a look at <a href="https://unsigned.io/private-messaging-over-lora/" rel="nofollow">this post</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto">If you want to try Nomad Network without building your own physical network, you can connect to the <a href="https://github.com/markqvist/Reticulum#public-testnet">Unsigned.io RNS Testnet</a> over the Internet, where there is already some Nomad Network and LXMF activity. If you connect to the testnet, you can leave nomadnet running for a while and wait for it to receive announces from other nodes on the network that host pages or services, or you can try connecting directly to some nodes listed here:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><code>abb3ebcd03cb2388a838e70c001291f9</code> Dublin Hub Testnet Node</li>
<li><code>ea6a715f814bdc37e56f80c34da6ad51</code> Frankfurt Hub Testnet Node</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">To browse pages on a node that is not currently known, open the URL dialog in the <code>Network</code> section of the program by pressing <code>Ctrl+U</code>, paste or enter the address and select <code>Go</code> or press enter. Nomadnet will attempt to discover and connect to the requested node.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Install on Android</h3><a id="user-content-install-on-android" aria-label="Permalink: Install on Android" href="#install-on-android"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">You can install Nomad Network on Android using Termux, but there's a few more commands involved than the above one-liner. The process is documented in the <a href="https://markqvist.github.io/Reticulum/manual/gettingstartedfast.html#reticulum-on-android" rel="nofollow">Android Installation</a> section of the Reticulum Manual. Once the Reticulum has been installed according to the linked documentation, Nomad Network can be installed as usual with pip.</p>

  <section id="introduction">
    <p>
      Efficient and accurate filtering of polygonal shapes can be achieved with closed-form solutions based on Green's
      theorem with piecewise-polynomial filters (e.g. box/bilinear/bicubic).

    <p>
      Instead of relying on pixel-approximations or super-sampling to achieve filtering effects, it is possible to
      directly compute the exact filtered coverage, by:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Breaking the polygon up into smaller (usually-pixel-sized) clipped polygons</li>
      <li>Evaluating the filter integral directly for each clipped polygon</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Furthermore, this can be done on the GPU, and is demonstrated in WebGPU in this article (if it is enabled).
    </p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>
      Rasterization is the process of converting vector graphics into pixel data. When rendering a polygon, the rasterizer
      needs to determine how much the polygon <em>covers</em> each pixel, so that it can determine the polygon's contribution
      to the pixel.
    </p>

    <p>
      A fast approach, given many polygons, is to see how much of each polygon is contained within the box of each pixel.
      However, when polygons overlap, this approach can lead to over-coverage, and can result in incorrect blending
      known as <a href="https://phetsims.github.io/alpenglow/#overview-conflation">conflation artifacts</a>. To avoid this,
      it is ideal to compute exact (non-overlapping) coverage, but it can also be approximated by super-sampling.

    <p>
      <em>Filtering</em> is a key component of anti-aliasing, which is used to reduce the visual artifacts that occur when rendering
      high-frequency content at a lower resolution.
    </p>

    <p>
      Browsers' built-in anti-aliasing for SVG and Canvas shapes, particularly when animated, usually does not include
      a significant amount of filtering. When displaying certain shapes, this results in aliasing artifacts that can be
      distracting or even misleading.

    <h2>Filters</h2>

    <p>
      While <a href="http://alvyray.com/Memos/CG/Microsoft/6_pixel.pdf">a pixel is not a little square</a>, a simple way
      to get a coverage value is to use the area of the polygon that covers the pixel. This is equivalent to applying a
      <em>box filter</em> to the polygon, which is the simplest form of filtering.

      While the box filter results in a sharp result, it can result in
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spatial_anti-aliasing#Examples">spatial aliasing artifacts</a>.
      These can be reduced by using other filters. Instead of taking the area of the polygon that covers a square around
      the center of the pixel, others will evaluate a different weighted function over the polygon.

      These piecewise-polynomial filters are equivalent to taking the integral of the piecewise-polynomial function
      <em>within</em> the polygon, where the filter function is centered at where a sample is being taken. The box
      filter is equivalent to taking the integral of an indicator function that is 1 within the square, and 0 outside.

    <h2>Green's Theorem and Polygons</h2>

    <p>
      We will dive into the math behind how we can evaluate the integral of a filter over a polygon using Green's Theorem.
      For more related results, see <a href="https://phetsims.github.io/alpenglow/#antialiasing-integrals">Alpenglow's integrals for anti-aliasing</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Overall:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>To evaluate an integral (i.e. a filter) over a shape, we can instead evaluate an integral over the boundary.</li>
      <li>For polygons, this means we can evaluate an expression for each edge (given $x_0$, $y_0$, $x_1$, and $y_1$), and sum those up.</li>
      <li>If the integrand is a polynomial, we get a closed-form solution that can be evaluated directly.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green%27s_theorem">Green's Theorem</a>, we can convert a double
      integral over a region into a line integral over the (closed, oriented counter-clockwise) boundary of the region:
    </p>

    <p>
      $$
      \oint_P\left(L\,\frac{dx}{dt}+M\,\frac{dy}{dt}\right)dt=\iint_P \left( \frac{\partial M}{\partial x}-\frac{\partial L}{\partial y} \right)\,dx\,dy
      $$
    </p>

    <p>
      for curves parameterized on $t$.
    </p>

    <p>
      For polygons, this means that if we can evaluate a line integral over each line segment (between $(x_i,y_i)$ and
      $(x_{i+1},y_{i+1})$, finishing with $(x_i,y_i)$ to $(x_0,y_0)$), we can sum up each edge's contribution to
      evaluate the double integral for the region inside the polygon. Each line segment is parameterized curve:
    </p>

    <p>
      $$
      x=x(t)=(1-t)x_i+(t)x_{i+1}=x_i+t(x_{i+1}-x_i)
      $$

      $$
      y=y(t)=(1-t)y_i+(t)y_{i+1}=y_i+t(y_{i+1}-y_i)
      $$

      for $0 \le t \le 1$, with the derivatives:

      $$
      \frac{dx}{dt}=x_{i+1}-x_i
      $$

      $$
      \frac{dy}{dt}=y_{i+1}-y_i
      $$

      Note:
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        If we reverse an edge (swap its endpoints), it will swap the sign of the contribution to the integral (a polygon
        can make a degenerate turn and double-back precisely, with no contribution to area). Thus for terms, swapping $i$
        and $i+1$ will swap the sign of the contribution. This means that polygons with holes can be evaluated by
        visiting the holes with the opposite orientation (clockwise).
      </li>
      <li>
        This is evaluated on closed polygons, so any terms that only depend on one endpoint will cancel out (e.g.
        $x_i^2y_i$ and $-x_{i+1}^2y_{i+1}$ will have their contributions cancel out, since both of those will be
        evaluated for every point in the polygon). It is useful to adjust the coefficients to these terms, since they
        can allow us to factor the expressions into simpler forms (e.g. the Shoelace formula below).
      </li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      We can pick $L$ and $M$ below:

      $$
      L=(n-1)\int f\,dy
      $$

      $$
      M=(n)\int f\,dx
      $$

      so that

      $$
      \iint_P \left( \frac{\partial M}{\partial x}-\frac{\partial L}{\partial y} \right)\,dx\,dy=
      \iint_P \left( (n)f - (n-1)f \right)\,dx\,dy=
      \iint_P f\,dx\,dy
      $$

      for any antiderivatives and real $n$, since the double integral will then be integrating our function $f$. It turns
      out, evaluating Green's Theorem over line segments for polynomial terms for any linear blend (any $n$) of $L$ and
      $M$ will differ only in the "canceled out" terms, so each edge's contribution will be the same.

    <h2>Integrating Polynomials over Polygons</h2>

    <p>
      If we zero out all of the canceled terms, it turns out that we can evaluate the integral of any polynomial term $x^my^n$ over a polygon $P$ by summing up the contributions of each edge:
    </p>
    <p>
      $$
      \iint_Px^my^n\,dx\,dy=\frac{m!n!}{(m+n+2)!}\sum_{i}\left[ (x_iy_{i+1}-x_{i+1}y_i) \sum_{p=0}^m\sum_{q=0}^n \binom{p+q}{q}\binom{m+n-p-q}{n-q}x_i^{m-p}x_{i+1}^py_i^{n-q}y_{i+1}^q \right]
      \tag{1}
      $$
    </p>
    <p>
      This was first discovered by <a href="https://repository.tudelft.nl/islandora/object/uuid%3A963296a1-8940-4439-9404-eca1bd2f8638">Soerjadi in 1968</a>.
      The contributions of each term can be summed up individually to integrate arbitrary polynomials.
    </p>

    <p>
      e.g. for $x^4y^2$ in matrix form:
    </p>
    <p>
      $$
      \iint_Px^4y^2\,dx\,dy=
      \frac{1}{840}
      \sum_{i}
      \left(
      (x_iy_{i+1}-x_{i+1}y_i)
      \begin{bmatrix}
      x_i^4 &amp; x_i^3x_{i+1} &amp; x_i^2x_{i+1}^2 &amp; x_ix_{i+1}^3 &amp; x_{i+1}^4
      \end{bmatrix}
      \begin{bmatrix}
      15 &amp; 5 &amp; 1\\
      10 &amp; 8 &amp; 3\\
      6 &amp; 9 &amp; 6\\
      3 &amp; 8 &amp; 10\\
      1 &amp; 5 &amp; 15

      \begin{bmatrix}
      y_i^2\\
      y_iy_{i+1}\\
      y_{i+1}^2
      \end{bmatrix}
      \right)
      $$
    </p>

    <p>
      Any polynomial-based (windowed or not) filter can be evaluated over a polygon with this approach. It may be
      feasible to approximate Gaussian/Sinc filters with polynomials, or find iterative approaches to converge to the
      integral.
    </p>

  <section id="integrals-for-filters">
    <h2>Integrals for Filters</h2>

    <h3>Box Filter (Area)</h3>

    <p>
      As seen above, the box filter is equivalent to a step function that is 1 within the box and 0 outside. When a polygon
      has been clipped, this is equivalent to evaluating the integral of $1$ inside the polygon (i.e. computing its area).
    </p>

    <figure>
      <img src="https://jonathanolson.net/img/box-filter.png" alt="Box filter">
    </figure>

    <p>
      For $x^0y^0=1$, with adding some canceling terms to better factor, we will obtain the
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoelace_formula">Shoelace formula</a> for finding the area of a polygon:

      $$
      area_P=\iint_P1\,dx\,dy=
      \frac{1}{2}
      \sum_{i}
      (x_i+x_{i+1})(y_{i+1}-y_i)
      $$
    </p>

    <p>
      This formula will be evaluated (with the appropriate order and orientation) for every edge
      ($x_i$, $y_i$, $x_{i+1}$, $y_{i+1}$) along a polygon. The sum will be the area of the polygon.
    </p>

    <h3>Bilinear Filter</h3>

    <p>
      The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilinear_interpolation">bilinear filter</a> is equivalent to integrating
      the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangular_function">tent function</a> over the polygon. As seen above,
      this is broken into 4 quadrants, each of which is a polynomial function.
    </p>

    <figure>
      <img src="https://jonathanolson.net/img/bilinear-filter.png" alt="Bilinear filter">
    </figure>

    <p>
      Without loss of generality, we can focus on computing the integral solely in the $0\le x\le1,0\le y\le1$ quadrant.
      The integrand is thus:
    </p>

    <p>
      $$
      (1-x)(1-y)=xy-x-y+1
      $$
    </p>

    <p>
      This is a weighted sum of the terms $x^1y^1$, $x^1y^0$, $x^0y^1$, and $x^0y^0$. We can sum up the weighted contribution
      of the corresponding terms from $\tag{1}$, resulting in the following evaluated line integral:
    </p>

    <p>
      $$
      \frac{1}{24}\sum_{i}(x_iy_{i+1}-x_{i+1}y_i)(12-4( x_i+y_i+x_{i+1}+y_{i+1})+2(x_iy_i+x_{i+1}y_{i+1})+
      x_iy_{i+1}+x_{i+1}y_i)
      $$
    </p>

    <p>
      This formula will be evaluated (with the appropriate order and orientation) for every edge
      ($x_i$, $y_i$, $x_{i+1}$, $y_{i+1}$) along a polygon (clipped to the unit square). The sum will be the
      integral of this quadrant of bilinear filter over the polygon (with the filter centered at the origin).
      Coordinate transformations can be used to evaluate the other quadrants (applying the absolute value to inputs).
    </p>

    <p>
      Note that the polygon needs to be clipped so that it is fully contained within the unit square.
    </p>

    <h3>Mitchell-Netravali Filter</h3>

    <p>
      The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitchell%E2%80%93Netravali_filters">Mitchell-Netravali filter family</a>,
      commonly referred to as "bicubic", is a piecewise-polynomial filter that that has a larger support, and includes
      negative lobes to reduce artifacts. It has 16 different polynomial pieces, which will require the integral evaluation
      of 3 different pieces.
    </p>

    <figure>
      <img src="https://jonathanolson.net/img/mitchell-netravali-filter.png" alt="Mitchell-Netravali (bicubic) filter">
    </figure>

    <p>
      We choose to use the "Mitchell-Netravali" filter (specifically with constants $B=1/3$ and $C=1/3$). It is separable
      and symmetric, so the integral is equal to $f(x)f(y)$, combining 1-dimensional kernels. The two polynomial chunks we
      get (assuming a $t &gt; 0$) are:
    </p>

    <p>
      $$
      f_0(t)=\frac{1}{6}\left(7y^3-12t^2+\frac{16}{3}\right)
      $$
    </p>

    <p>
      for $0\le t\le1$, and:
    </p>

    <p>
      $$
      f_1(t)=\frac{1}{6}\left(-\frac{7}{3}y^3+12t^2-20t+\frac{32}{3}\right)
      $$
    </p>

    <p>
      for $1\le t\le2$.
    </p>

    <p>
      Taking into account symmetry, this gives us three different polynomial chunks we will need to evaluate:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>$f_0(x)f_0(y)$</li>
      <li>$f_0(x)f_1(y)$</li>
      <li>$f_1(x)f_1(y)$</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Since the others can be obtained by reversing signs and/or reflection with swapping x/y input.
    </p>

    <p>
      All three of these can be evaluated using the formula $\tag{1}$, since they are simply polynomials in $x$ and $y$.
      Notably:
    </p>

    <p>
      $$
      f_0(x)f_0(y)=

      $$
    </p>

    <p>
      $$
      f_1(x)f_1(y)=
      \begin{bmatrix}1 &amp; x &amp; x^2 &amp; x^3\end{bmatrix}

      $$

    <p>
      Long story short, evaluating $\tag{1}$ for these, we get some reasonably long expressions that can be evaluated directly.

      Common terms can be factored out, speeding this up somewhat, but it is still less efficient than the bilinear case.

    <h2>Blurring</h2>

    <p>
      While the typical filter size is small (and may slightly blur the edges of a polygon), it is possible to dramatically
      expand the size of the filter (computed for each pixel) to intentionally blur the polygon. Generally when this
      is done, each of the clipped piecewise-polynomial sections will NOT overlap with those of other pixels, so it takes
      a bit more computation and clipping to evaluate the integral.

      Note that large blur radii are not too much more expensive than small ones, it depends on the geometry of the

      is slowed down by the GC-hungry CPU procedure that computes occlusion.

      (on the GPU, using the edge-clipped form noted in Alpenglow documentation).
    </p>

    <p>
      On the GPU, this has been done so far by clipping things into approximately 256x256 tiles, and then further into
      approximately 16x16 sub-tiles, at which the final clipping can be done during the rasterization. There are multiple
      approaches (using WebGPU compute shaders) to doing this efficiently, it is something I'm working on!
    </p>

    <p>
      The clipped regions need to be expanded by the radius of the filter's support. For example, the bilinear filter
      will need to be expanded by 1 pixel in each direction, and the bicubic filter will need to be expanded by 2 pixels
      (from the pixel centers).
    </p>

    <p>
      It turns out that for normal filter sizes, the clipped regions for different pixels will overlap
      (e.g. for bilinear, pixel 0,0 and 1,1, one of the quadrants will be shared). Thus on the GPU, a workgroup can
      compute a 16x16 grid of clipped polygons, evaluate all of the 4 potential integrals, and for speed can evaluate
      the color of that region. Then those integrals can be used to blend the results into a 15x15 section of pixels.
    </p>

    <p>
      This method is the most effective when the occlusion problem has already been solved (e.g. with
      a computation-area geometry approach like <a href="https://phetsims.github.io/alpenglow/">Alpenglow</a>).
      With that type of approach, the clipped regions will not overlap, and the integrals can be evaluated directly.
