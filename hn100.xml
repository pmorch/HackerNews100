<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
            <p>Ask most venture-backed founders why they get 10x more equity than employee #1, 100x more equity than employee #5, and 1000x more equity than employee #15, and you'll get the same answer: "I'M TAKING SO MUCH RISK, IT'S SO HARD TO START A COMPANY, I MADE A BIG MOVE!!!" And then you'll ask, "but why are you yelling?”</p><p>The narrative of the founder's risk is a cornerstone of Silicon Valley's mythology. Founders are celebrated for leaving stable jobs and pouring their lives into an “uncertain” and “high-risk” venture. This mythos justifies the enormous equity stakes founders hold compared to early employees who take very similar risks by joining an unproven startup.</p><p>However, there's a lesser-known aspect of the startup ecosystem that significantly shifts the risk landscape: <strong>founder liquidity</strong>.</p><h3 id="my-experience-in-early-stage-startups">My Experience in Early Stage Startups</h3><p>Being a software engineer who has a strong preference for creativity, problem-solving, and autonomy I realized during college that very big and slow companies were not for me. I joined a startup straight out of college as employee number 8 and immediately knew I made the right choice. My skills were improving week over week, I was responsible for shipping important features and was given a lot of responsibility right out of the gate.</p><p>I eventually got pretty good at choosing strong founders to join and building great products from zero to one which in turn spawned a cycle of joining a team early, finding success, the company gets too big, and then I leave to do it again elsewhere. I have been an early or first engineer at five different companies and have had three liquidity events in a 9-year career.</p><h3 id="the-reality-of-founder-risk-liquidity">The Reality of Founder Risk &amp; Liquidity</h3><p><strong>Founder liquidity</strong> refers to the practice where founders sell a portion of their shares during a new funding round. This allows them to "take chips off the table," securing personal financial stability while continuing to build the company with a fresh influx of venture capital. This practice is often kept under wraps, discussed in closed boardrooms, and only briefly mentioned in investor updates. You would really only know this happened if you were a founder, investor, or had direct access to the cap table.</p><p>Why is it a secret that founders get liquidity in many venture rounds? Because it undermines the narrative of the founder who is "all-in." The story of the founder who mortgaged their house and lived on ramen noodles for years is compelling. It garners admiration and sympathy, attracting top talent willing to work for lower salaries in exchange for a piece of the pie. If it were widely known that founders could de-risk their financial position while their employees remained all-in, it might change how startups are perceived and valued.</p><p>This is a graph of cash compensation over time modeled off of a real scenario that happened over 4 years. This level of founder liquidity is fairly common.</p><figure><img src="https://www.stefantheard.com/content/images/2024/06/founder-liquidity-chart-1.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1056" height="547" srcset="https://www.stefantheard.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/06/founder-liquidity-chart-1.png 600w, https://www.stefantheard.com/content/images/size/w1000/2024/06/founder-liquidity-chart-1.png 1000w, https://www.stefantheard.com/content/images/2024/06/founder-liquidity-chart-1.png 1056w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>The founder in this scenario was offered $400,000 of liquidity at Series A and $750,000 at Series B and encouraged to do so by their board of investors to de-risk their own life. Liquidity was not offered to any employees and the fact that this happened at all was only revealed to people on the cap table.</p><p>Another more well-known and extreme example was in the case of Adam Neumann the founder of WeWork - Neumann was able to cash out over 2B in secondary meanwhile not a single WeWork employee was able to capitalize on their equity stakes. They were told internally how much their shares were worth at each raise, and the hype surrounding each raise continued as WeWork sky-rocketed in valuation. Neumann was smart to de-risk his position by selling as much secondary as possible during the ascent but only attempted to structure a tender offer for non-founding employees in 2019 <strong><em>nine years</em></strong> after WeWork was created. That tender offer with SoftBank fell through and employees were left with absolutely nothing. (<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/samanthasharf/2020/04/13/wework-employees-feel-abandoned-and-angry-as-softbank-ditches-its-3-billion-buyout-offer?ref=stefantheard.com">source</a>)</p><p>The part about these stories that feels unfair is not that the founders are getting liquidity - it's that they are the <em>only ones</em> getting liquidity. There are other stories like <a href="https://techfundingnews.com/unravelling-virtual-dreams-the-rise-and-fall-of-hopin/?ref=stefantheard.com" rel="noreferrer">Hopin</a> where the founder takes tens or hundreds of millions in secondary just to later sell the company for less than the <a href="https://www.holloway.com/g/venture-capital/sections/liquidation-preference?ref=stefantheard.com" rel="noreferrer">liquidation preference</a> stack and leave the employees with a grand total of zero dollars for their equity.</p><h3 id="right-sizing-perception">Right-Sizing Perception</h3><p>There are a lot of odd perceptions surrounding founder liquidity:</p><ol><li>Investors and founders both tend to think that if employees knew founders were getting liquidity that that would negatively impact employee morale (<strong>it wouldn’t</strong>)</li><li>Founders often feel guilty that they are getting liquidity (<strong>they shouldn’t</strong>)</li><li>Investors think that the liquidity could taint the perception of future investors negatively (<strong>it doesn’t</strong>)</li><li>Investors, founders, and employees all believe that founders are taking more risk than early employees (<strong>this isn’t true once founders have exclusive access to liquidity</strong>)</li></ol><p>When I found out that my founders got access to liquidity during our series A my first thought was “That is awesome, they deserve it” my second thought was “I wonder why employees didn’t get access to any liquidity?” and then my third thought was “Is this a secret? It seems like a secret. That’s weird”. I was the only employee who knew about it because I had incidental access to the cap table.</p><p>Once I found out I was curious if I was reading it correctly so I immediately went to one of the founders and asked “Did you get a bit of liquidity during the series A?”. His reaction went from surprise to confusion and then he said “Yeah I did, a little bit”. I said “Wow that is awesome, congrats! It has to be nice to be able to backfill some salary after grinding for a couple of years” and he said, “Yeah, definitely.”. I could sense relief after chatting about it with him, almost like he felt better knowing that I knew about it. I never felt negative, had low morale, or anything of the sort, I trusted in my founding team and I was happy for them. If it were the case that I was lied to about it, then I would be upset and have low morale but that would be a result of being lied to - not liquidity access.</p><h3 id="balancing-the-scales">Balancing the Scales</h3><p>As of 4 months ago I left a very successful stealth startup (which grew to 40M in ARR in two years) to become a founder and that is when it clicked - I expected to feel stressed, pressured, and the weight of all of the risk I was taking. What actually happened is that I realized I could have been a founder 6 years ago and I would have been taking a similar amount of risk as I did then as the first employee at <a href="http://tackle.io/?ref=stefantheard.com">tackle.io</a>.</p><p>My intention now, as a founder, is to balance the risk for early employees by being transparent, more generous with equity, and only taking liquidity if I can also offer it to employees as well.</p><ul><li>Our employee option pool is 20% which is double the average</li><li>We have a 3-month equity cliff which is 9 months sooner than the average.</li><li>We allow employees to exercise options up to 10 years after they leave instead of 90 days.</li><li>Our equity packages vest over 3 years instead of the industry standard 4-year period.</li></ul><p>These changes are great, but nowhere near enough. In my view, every internal announcement of a new round at venture-backed companies should be accompanied by education and transparency around liquidity. Without transparency, none of the misperceptions have a chance of going away. The net result is that employees have a fundamentally misguided idea of the risk landscape as it shifts beneath their feet. </p><div><p>If you work at a venture-backed company the next time a round is announced ask if the founders took any liquidity. Do it anonymously if you have to. This question should become so common that founders and investors become transparent by default. If they say no, great - no change to risk profiles. If they say yes - great, employees are operating with the same information as the founders and investors. This levels the playing field and allows employees to assess if they are still in a lower risk bucket than the founders, or if they are now taking significantly more risk than the founders.</p><p>If employees realize they are taking more risk than the founders, maybe they'll ask for more compensation, maybe they'll congratulate the founders and move on with their day, maybe they'll start yelling: "I'M TAKING SO MUCH RISK, IT'S SO HARD TO BUILD A COMPANY, I DON'T EVEN HAVE ACCESS TO LIQUIDITY!!!". And maybe they're right.</p></div><p><em>(special thanks to anu, jessica, erika, laura, derek, and minh for reading drafts and giving  feedback on this)</em></p>

<p>When T-Mobile <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/05/t-mobile-imposes-5-monthly-price-hike-on-customers-using-older-plans/">announced price hikes</a> of up to $5 per line on older smartphone plans last month, many customers were shocked because of T-Mobile's years-old promise that their price would never rise as long as they stuck with the same plan.</p>
<p>"New rule: Only YOU should have the power to change what you pay," T-Mobile said in a <a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/news/press/un-carrier-next">January 2017 announcement</a> of its "Un-contract" promise for T-Mobile One plans. "Now, T-Mobile One customers keep their price until THEY decide to change it. T-Mobile will never change the price you pay for your T-Mobile One plan."</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the promise wasn't as simple as T-Mobile claimed it to be in that press release. T-Mobile also published an FAQ that answered the question, "What happens if you do raise the price of my T-Mobile One service?" It explained that the only guarantee is T-Mobile will pay your final month's bill if the price goes up and you decide to cancel.</p>
<p>The FAQ stated, "The Un-contract is our commitment that only you can change what you pay and we mean it! To show just how serious we are we have committed to pay your final month's recurring service charges if we were to raise prices and you choose to leave. Just let us know within 60 days."</p>
<p>The FAQ link now just redirects to the T-Mobile home page but the Internet Archive has a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180124073308/https://www.t-mobile.com/offers/tmo_one_faqs#uncontractpromise">capture</a> of the FAQ from January 2018. While we couldn't find an earlier capture of the page, a <a href="https://forums.androidcentral.com/threads/t-mobile-un-carrier-next.760027/#post-5636154">discussion</a> on an Android Central forum shows that the text mentioned above was noticed by some customers in January 2017.</p>
<p>The Un-contract was also previously <a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/news/press/uncontract-carrier-freedom">applied to T-Mobile Simple Choice plans</a> starting in March 2015. The 2015 announcement said the Un-contract would be enabled automatically with "no crazy strings, no hoops to jump through, no hidden fees, no BS."</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>The recent price increases <a href="https://tmo.report/2024/05/confirmed-t-mobile-is-raising-prices-on-some-legacy-plans/">reportedly</a> affect Simple Choice plans as well as other packages, but we haven't been able to find any language from 2015 that acknowledges an exception that lets T-Mobile raise prices on Simple Choice. We asked T-Mobile several questions today and will update this article if it provides more information.</p>
<h2>T-Mobile disputes complaint to FCC</h2>
<p>T-Mobile is pointing to the above caveat to defend itself against at least one complaint filed to the Federal Communications Commission after the recent price hike. Yesterday, a Reddit user and T-Mobile subscriber <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/tmobile/comments/1dd1x5t/did_anyone_else_get_the_following_letter_from/">posted a letter</a> in which T-Mobile asked the FCC to close the complaint filed by the user.</p>
<p>T-Mobile's response to the FCC and the user who complained said:</p>
<blockquote><p>Regarding these changes, we are aware some customers have inquired about T-Mobile's <em>Un-contract</em> and <em>Price Lock</em>. With <em>Un-contract</em>, T-Mobile committed to its customers that if we were to increase prices and customers chose to leave as a result, T-Mobile would pay the customers' final month's recurring service charge, as long as we are notified within 60 days. Consistent with this commitment, customers who activated on an eligible rate plan between January 5, 2017 and April 27, 2022, can request to have their final month's qualifying service charge reimbursed if their rate plan increases and they choose to cancel service. Customers simply need to request reimbursement within 60 days of the price increase.</p></blockquote>
<p>The T-Mobile response goes on to describe the more recent "Price Lock" guarantee that was offered starting in April 2022 and discontinued in January 2024. The T-Mobile response said that customer lines covered by Price Lock are exempt from the recent price increases:</p>
<blockquote><p>As for customers with concerns about T-Mobile's <em>Price Lock</em> guarantee, it is important to note that customers with <em>Price Lock</em> are not impacted by the change. On April 28, 2022, T-Mobile began offering <em>Price Lock</em> on new account activations on qualifying rate plans. For customers who activated on a qualifying plan between April 28, 2022 and January 17, 2024, <em>Price Lock</em> guarantees that accounts activated with a qualifying rate plan, within the enrollment period, would not be subject to a price increase, so long as the account remained in good standing and the customer remained on the qualifying rate plan.</p></blockquote>
<p>T-Mobile's response to the complaint also said that customers who switch plans lose their Price Lock guarantee.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
  <p>In 1993, id Software released the first-person shooter <em>Doom</em>, which quickly
became a phenomenon. The game is now considered one of the most influential
games of all time.</p>

<p>A decade after <em>Doom</em>’s release, in 2003, journalist David Kushner published a
book about id Software called <em>Masters of Doom</em>, which has since become the
canonical account of <em>Doom</em>’s creation. I read <em>Masters of Doom</em> a few years
ago and don’t remember much of it now, but there was one story in the book
about lead programmer John Carmack that has stuck with me. This is a loose
gloss of the story (see below for the full details), but essentially, early in
the development of <em>Doom</em>, Carmack realized that the 3D renderer he had written
for the game slowed to a crawl when trying to render certain levels. This was
unacceptable, because <em>Doom</em> was supposed to be action-packed and frenetic. So
Carmack, realizing the problem with his renderer was fundamental enough that he
would need to find a better rendering algorithm, started reading research
papers. He eventually implemented a technique called “binary space
partitioning,” never before used in a video game, that dramatically sped up the
<em>Doom</em> engine.
<!--more--></p>

<p>That story about Carmack applying cutting-edge academic research to video games
has always impressed me. It is my explanation for why Carmack has become such a
legendary figure. He deserves to be known as the archetypal genius video game
programmer for all sorts of reasons, but this episode with the academic papers
and the binary space partitioning is the justification I think of first.</p>

<p>Obviously, the story is impressive because “binary space partitioning” sounds
like it would be a difficult thing to just read about and implement yourself.
I’ve long assumed that what Carmack did was a clever intellectual leap, but
because I’ve never understood what binary space partitioning is or how novel a
technique it was when Carmack decided to use it, I’ve never known for sure. On
a spectrum from Homer Simpson to Albert Einstein, how much of a genius-level
move was it really for Carmack to add binary space partitioning to <em>Doom</em>?</p>

<p>I’ve also wondered where binary space partitioning first came from and how the
idea found its way to Carmack. So this post is about John Carmack and <em>Doom</em>,
but it is also about the history of a data structure: the binary space
partitioning tree (or BSP tree). It turns out that the BSP tree, rather
interestingly, and like so many things in computer science, has its origins in
research conducted for the military.</p>

<p>That’s right: E1M1, the first level of <em>Doom</em>, was brought to you by the
US Air Force.</p>

<h2 id="the-vsd-problem">The VSD Problem</h2>
<p>The BSP tree is a solution to one of the thorniest problems in computer
graphics. In order to render a three-dimensional scene, a renderer has to
figure out, given a particular viewpoint, what can be seen and what cannot be
seen. This is not especially challenging if you have lots of time, but a
respectable real-time game engine needs to figure out what can be seen and what
cannot be seen at least 30 times a second.</p>

<p>This problem is sometimes called the problem of visible surface determination.
Michael Abrash, a programmer who worked with Carmack on <em>Quake</em> (id Software’s
follow-up to <em>Doom</em>), wrote about the VSD problem in his famous <em>Graphics
Programming Black Book</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I want to talk about what is, in my opinion, the toughest 3-D problem of all:
visible surface determination (drawing the proper surface at each pixel), and
its close relative, culling (discarding non-visible polygons as quickly as
possible, a way of accelerating visible surface determination). In the
interests of brevity, I’ll use the abbreviation VSD to mean both visible
surface determination and culling from now on.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Why do I think VSD is the toughest 3-D challenge? Although rasterization
issues such as texture mapping are fascinating and important, they are tasks
of relatively finite scope, and are being moved into hardware as 3-D
accelerators appear; also, they only scale with increases in screen
resolution, which are relatively modest.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>In contrast, VSD is an open-ended problem, and there are dozens of approaches
currently in use. Even more significantly, the performance of VSD, done in an
unsophisticated fashion, scales directly with scene complexity, which tends
to increase as a square or cube function, so this very rapidly becomes the
limiting factor in rendering realistic worlds.<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Abrash was writing about the difficulty of the VSD problem in the late ’90s,
years after <em>Doom</em> had proved that regular people wanted to be able to play
graphically intensive games on their home computers. In the early ’90s, when id
Software first began publishing games, the games had to be programmed to run
efficiently on computers not designed to run them, computers meant for word
processing, spreadsheet applications, and little else. To make this work,
especially for the few 3D games that id Software published before <em>Doom</em>, id
Software had to be creative. In these games, the design of all the levels was
constrained in such a way that the VSD problem was easier to solve.</p>

<p>For example, in <em>Wolfenstein 3D</em>, the game id Software released just prior to
<em>Doom</em>, every level is made from walls that are axis-aligned. In other words,
in the Wolfenstein universe, you can have north-south walls or west-east walls,
but nothing else. Walls can also only be placed at fixed intervals on a
grid—all hallways are either one grid square wide, or two grid squares wide,
etc., but never 2.5 grid squares wide. Though this meant that the id Software
team could only design levels that all looked somewhat the same, it made
Carmack’s job of writing a renderer for <em>Wolfenstein</em> much simpler.</p>

<p>The <em>Wolfenstein</em> renderer solved the VSD problem by “marching” rays into the
virtual world from the screen. Usually a renderer that uses rays is a
“raycasting” renderer—these renderers are often slow, because solving the VSD
problem in a raycaster involves finding the first intersection between a ray
and something in your world, which in the general case requires lots of number
crunching. But in <em>Wolfenstein</em>, because all the walls are aligned with the
grid, the only location a ray can possibly intersect a wall is at the grid
lines. So all the renderer needs to do is check each of those intersection
points. If the renderer starts by checking the intersection point nearest to
the player’s viewpoint, then checks the next nearest, and so on, and stops when
it encounters the first wall, the VSD problem has been solved in an almost
trivial way. A ray is just marched forward from each pixel until it hits
something, which works because the marching is so cheap in terms of CPU cycles.
And actually, since all walls are the same height, it is only necessary to
march a single ray for every <em>column</em> of pixels.</p>

<p>This rendering shortcut made <em>Wolfenstein</em> fast enough to run on underpowered
home PCs in the era before dedicated graphics cards. But this approach would
not work for <em>Doom</em>, since the id team had decided that their new game would
feature novel things like diagonal walls, stairs, and ceilings of different
heights. Ray marching was no longer viable, so Carmack wrote a different kind
of renderer. Whereas the <em>Wolfenstein</em> renderer, with its ray for every column
of pixels, is an “image-first” renderer, the <em>Doom</em> renderer is an
“object-first” renderer. This means that rather than iterating through the
pixels on screen and figuring out what color they should be, the <em>Doom</em>
renderer iterates through the objects in a scene and projects each onto the
screen in turn.</p>

<p>In an object-first renderer, one easy way to solve the VSD problem is to use a
z-buffer. Each time you project an object onto the screen, for each pixel you
want to draw to, you do a check. If the part of the object you want to draw is
closer to the player than what was already drawn to the pixel, then you can
overwrite what is there. Otherwise you have to leave the pixel as is. This
approach is simple, but a z-buffer requires a lot of memory, and the renderer
may still expend a lot of CPU cycles projecting level geometry that is never
going to be seen by the player.</p>

<p>In the early 1990s, there was an additional drawback to the z-buffer approach:
On IBM-compatible PCs, which used a video adapter system called VGA,
writing to the output frame buffer was an expensive operation. So time
spent drawing pixels that would only get overwritten later tanked the
performance of your renderer.</p>

<p>Since writing to the frame buffer was so expensive, the ideal renderer was
one that started by drawing the objects closest to the player, then the objects
just beyond those objects, and so on, until every pixel on screen had been
written to. At that point the renderer would know to stop, saving all the time
it might have spent considering far-away objects that the player cannot see.
But ordering the objects in a scene this way, from closest to farthest, is
tantamount to solving the VSD problem. Once again, the question is: What can be
seen by the player?</p>

<p>Initially, Carmack tried to solve this problem by relying on the layout of
<em>Doom</em>’s levels. His renderer started by drawing the walls of the room
currently occupied by the player, then flooded out into neighboring rooms to
draw the walls in those rooms that could be seen from the current room.
Provided that every room was convex, this solved the VSD issue. Rooms that were
not convex could be split into convex “sectors.” You can see how this rendering
technique might have looked if run at extra-slow speed <a href="https://youtu.be/HQYsFshbkYw?t=822">in this
video</a>, where YouTuber Bisqwit demonstrates
a renderer of his own that works according to the same general algorithm. This
algorithm was successfully used in Duke Nukem 3D, released three years after
<em>Doom</em>, when CPUs were more powerful. But, in 1993, running on the hardware
then available, the <em>Doom</em> renderer that used this algorithm struggled with
complicated levels—particularly when sectors were nested inside of each other,
which was the only way to create something like a circular pit of stairs. A
circular pit of stairs led to lots of repeated recursive descents into a sector
that had already been drawn, strangling the game engine’s speed.</p>

<p>Around the time that the id team realized that the <em>Doom</em> game engine might be
too slow, id Software was asked to port <em>Wolfenstein 3D</em> to the Super Nintendo.
The Super Nintendo was even less powerful than the IBM-compatible PCs of the
day, and it turned out that the ray-marching <em>Wolfenstein</em> renderer, simple as
it was, didn’t run fast enough on the Super Nintendo hardware. So Carmack began
looking for a better algorithm. It was actually for the Super Nintendo
port of <em>Wolfenstein</em> that Carmack first researched and implemented binary
space partitioning. In <em>Wolfenstein</em>, this was relatively straightforward
because all the walls were axis-aligned; in <em>Doom</em>, it would be more complex.
But Carmack realized that BSP trees would solve <em>Doom</em>’s speed problems too.</p>


<p>Binary space partitioning makes the VSD problem easier to solve by splitting a
3D scene into parts ahead of time. For now, you just need to grasp why
splitting a scene is useful: If you draw a line (really a plane in 3D) across
your scene, and you know which side of the line the player or camera viewpoint
is on, then you also know that nothing on the other side of the line can
obstruct something on the viewpoint’s side of the line. If you repeat this
process many times, you end up with a 3D scene split into many sections, which
wouldn’t be an improvement on the original scene except now you know more about
how different parts of the scene can obstruct each other.</p>

<p>The first people to write about dividing a 3D scene like this were researchers
trying to establish for the US Air Force whether computer graphics were
sufficiently advanced to use in flight simulators. They released their
findings in a 1969 report called “Study for Applying Computer-Generated Images
to Visual Simulation.” The report concluded that computer graphics could be
used to train pilots, but also warned that the implementation would be
complicated by the VSD problem:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>One of the most significant problems that must be faced in the real-time
computation of images is the priority, or hidden-line, problem. In our
everyday visual perception of our surroundings, it is a problem that nature
solves with trivial ease; a point of an opaque object obscures all other
points that lie along the same line of sight and are more distant. In the
computer, the task is formidable. The computations required to resolve
priority in the general case grow exponentially with the complexity of the
environment, and soon they surpass the computing load associated with finding
the perspective images of the objects.<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>One solution these researchers mention, which according to them was earlier
used in a project for NASA, is based on creating what I am going to call an
“occlusion matrix.” The researchers point out that a plane dividing a scene
in two can be used to resolve “any priority conflict” between objects on
opposite sides of the plane. In general you might have to add these planes
explicitly to your scene, but with certain kinds of geometry you can just rely
on the faces of the objects you already have. They give the example in the
figure below, where \(p_1\), \(p_2\), and \(p_3\) are the separating planes. If
the camera viewpoint is on the forward or “true” side of one of these planes,
then \(p_i\) evaluates to 1. The matrix shows the relationships between the
three objects based on the three dividing planes and the location of the camera
viewpoint—if object \(a_i\) obscures object \(a_j\), then entry \(a_{ij}\) in
the matrix will be a 1.</p>

<p><img src="https://twobithistory.org/images/matrix_figure.png" alt=""></p>

<p>The researchers propose that this matrix could be implemented in hardware and
re-evaluated every frame. Basically the matrix would act as a big switch or a
kind of pre-built z-buffer. When drawing a given object, no video would be
output for the parts of the object when a 1 exists in the object’s column and
the corresponding row object is also being drawn.</p>

<p>The major drawback with this matrix approach is that to represent a scene with
\(n\) objects you need a matrix of size \(n^2\). So the researchers go on to
explore whether it would be feasible to represent the occlusion matrix as a
“priority list” instead, which would only be of size \(n\) and would establish
an order in which objects should be drawn. They immediately note that for
certain scenes like the one in the figure above no ordering can be made (since
there is an occlusion cycle), so they spend a lot of time laying out the
mathematical distinction between “proper” and “improper” scenes. Eventually
they conclude that, at least for “proper” scenes—and it should be easy enough
for a scene designer to avoid “improper” cases—a priority list could be
generated. But they leave the list generation as an exercise for the reader. It
seems the primary contribution of this 1969 study was to point out that it
should be possible to use partitioning planes to order objects in a scene for
rendering, at least <em>in theory</em>.</p>

<p>It was not until 1980 that a paper, titled “On Visible Surface Generation by A
Priori Tree Structures,” demonstrated a concrete algorithm to accomplish this.
The 1980 paper, written by Henry Fuchs, Zvi Kedem, and Bruce Naylor, introduced
the BSP tree. The authors say that their novel data structure is “an
alternative solution to an approach first utilized a decade ago but due to a
few difficulties, not widely exploited”—here referring to the approach taken in
the 1969 Air Force study.<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup> A BSP tree, once constructed, can easily be used
to provide a priority ordering for objects in the scene.</p>

<p>Fuchs, Kedem, and Naylor give a pretty readable explanation of how a BSP tree
works, but let me see if I can provide a less formal but more concise one.</p>

<p>You begin by picking one polygon in your scene and making the plane in which
the polygon lies your partitioning plane. That one polygon also ends up as the
root node in your tree. The remaining polygons in your scene will be on one
side or the other of your root partitioning plane. The polygons on the
“forward” side or in the “forward” half-space of your plane end up in the
left subtree of your root node, while the polygons on the “back” side or in the
“back” half-space of your plane end up in the right subtree. You then repeat
this process recursively, picking a polygon from your left and right subtrees
to be the new partitioning planes for their respective half-spaces, which
generates further half-spaces and further sub-trees. You stop when you run out
of polygons.</p>

<p>Say you want to render the geometry in your scene from back-to-front. (This is
known as the “painter’s algorithm,” since it means that polygons further from
the camera will get drawn over by polygons closer to the camera, producing a
correct rendering.) To achieve this, all you have to do is an in-order
traversal of the BSP tree, where the decision to render the left or right
subtree of any node first is determined by whether the camera viewpoint is in
either the forward or back half-space relative to the partitioning plane
associated with the node. So at each node in the tree, you render all the
polygons on the “far” side of the plane first, then the polygon in the
partitioning plane, then all the polygons on the “near” side of the plane—”far”
and “near” being relative to the camera viewpoint. This solves the VSD problem
because, as we learned several paragraphs back, the polygons on the far side of
the partitioning plane cannot obstruct anything on the near side.</p>

<p>The following diagram shows the construction and traversal of a BSP tree
representing a simple 2D scene. In 2D, the partitioning planes are instead
partitioning lines, but the basic idea is the same in a more complicated 3D
scene.</p>

<p><img src="https://twobithistory.org/images/bsp.svg" alt="">
<em>Step One: The root partitioning line along wall D splits the remaining
geometry into two sets.</em></p>

<p><img src="https://twobithistory.org/images/bsp1.svg" alt="">
<em>Step Two: The half-spaces on either side of D are split again. Wall C is the
only wall in its half-space so no split is needed. Wall B forms the new
partitioning line in its half-space. Wall A must be split into two walls since
it crosses the partitioning line.</em></p>

<p><img src="https://twobithistory.org/images/bsp2.svg" alt="">
<em>A back-to-front ordering of the walls relative to the viewpoint in the
top-right corner, useful for implementing the painter’s algorithm. This is just
an in-order traversal of the tree.</em></p>

<p>The really neat thing about a BSP tree, which Fuchs, Kedem, and Naylor stress
several times, is that it only has to be constructed once. This is somewhat
surprising, but the same BSP tree can be used to render a scene no matter where
the camera viewpoint is. The BSP tree remains valid as long as the polygons in
the scene don’t move. This is why the BSP tree is so useful for real-time
rendering—all the hard work that goes into constructing the tree can be done
beforehand rather than during rendering.</p>

<p>One issue that Fuchs, Kedem, and Naylor say needs further exploration is the
question of what makes a “good” BSP tree. The quality of your BSP tree will
depend on which polygons you decide to use to establish your partitioning
planes. I skipped over this earlier, but if you partition using a plane that
intersects other polygons, then in order for the BSP algorithm to work, you
have to split the intersected polygons in two, so that one part can go in one
half-space and the other part in the other half-space. If this happens a lot,
then building a BSP tree will dramatically increase the number of polygons in
your scene.</p>

<p>Bruce Naylor, one of the authors of the 1980 paper, would later write about
this problem in his 1993 paper, “Constructing Good Partitioning Trees.”
According to John Romero, one of Carmack’s fellow id Software co-founders, this
paper was one of the papers that Carmack read when he was trying to implement
BSP trees in <em>Doom</em>.<sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4">4</a></sup></p>

<h2 id="bsp-trees-in-doom">BSP Trees in Doom</h2>
<p>Remember that, in his first draft of the <em>Doom</em> renderer, Carmack had been
trying to establish a rendering order for level geometry by “flooding” the
renderer out from the player’s current room into neighboring rooms. BSP trees
were a better way to establish this ordering because they avoided the issue
where the renderer found itself visiting the same room (or sector) multiple
times, wasting CPU cycles.</p>

<p>“Adding BSP trees to <em>Doom</em>” meant, in practice, adding a BSP tree generator to
the <em>Doom</em> level editor. When a level in <em>Doom</em> was complete, a BSP tree was
generated from the level geometry. According to Fabien Sanglard, the generation
process could take as long as eight seconds for a single level and 11 minutes
for all the levels in the original <em>Doom</em>.<sup id="fnref:5" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:5">5</a></sup> The generation process was
lengthy in part because Carmack’s BSP generation algorithm tries to search for
a “good” BSP tree using various heuristics. An eight-second delay would have
been unforgivable at runtime, but it was not long to wait when done offline,
especially considering the performance gains the BSP trees brought to the
renderer. The generated BSP tree for a single level would have then ended up as
part of the level data loaded into the game when it starts.</p>

<p>Carmack put a spin on the BSP tree algorithm outlined in the 1980 paper,
because once <em>Doom</em> is started and the BSP tree for the current level is read
into memory, the renderer uses the BSP tree to draw objects front-to-back
rather than back-to-front. In the 1980 paper, Fuchs, Kedem, and Naylor show how
a BSP tree can be used to implement the back-to-front painter’s algorithm, but
the painter’s algorithm involves a lot of over-drawing that would have been
expensive on an IBM-compatible PC. So the <em>Doom</em> renderer instead starts with
the geometry closer to the player, draws that first, then draws the geometry
farther away. This reverse ordering is easy to achieve using a BSP tree, since
you can just make the opposite traversal decision at each node in the tree. To
ensure that the farther-away geometry is not drawn over the closer geometry,
the <em>Doom</em> renderer uses a kind of implicit z-buffer that provides much of the
benefit of a z-buffer with a much smaller memory footprint. There is one array
that keeps track of occlusion in the horizontal dimension, and another two
arrays that keep track of occlusion in the vertical dimension from the top and
bottom of the screen. The <em>Doom</em> renderer can get away with not using an actual
z-buffer because <em>Doom</em> is not technically a fully 3D game. The cheaper data
structures work because certain things never appear in <em>Doom</em>: The horizontal
occlusion array works because there are no sloping walls, and the vertical
occlusion arrays work because no walls have, say, two windows, one above the
other.</p>

<p>The only other tricky issue left is how to incorporate <em>Doom</em>’s moving
characters into the static level geometry drawn with the aid of the BSP tree.
The enemies in <em>Doom</em> cannot be a part of the BSP tree because they move; the
BSP tree only works for geometry that never moves. So the <em>Doom</em> renderer draws
the static level geometry first, keeping track of the segments of the screen
that were drawn to (with yet another memory-efficient data structure). It then
draws the enemies in back-to-front order, clipping them against the segments of
the screen that occlude them. This process is not as optimal as rendering using
the BSP tree, but because there are usually fewer enemies visible than there is
level geometry in a level, speed isn’t as much of an issue here.</p>

<p>Using BSP trees in <em>Doom</em> was a major win. Obviously it is pretty neat that
Carmack was able to figure out that BSP trees were the perfect solution to his
problem. But was it a <em>genius</em>-level move?</p>

<p>In his excellent book about the <em>Doom</em> game engine, Fabien Sanglard quotes John
Romero saying that Bruce Naylor’s paper, “Constructing Good Partitioning
Trees,” was mostly about using BSP trees to cull backfaces from 3D models.<sup id="fnref:6" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:6">6</a></sup>
According to Romero, Carmack thought the algorithm could still be useful for
<em>Doom</em>, so he went ahead and implemented it. This description is quite
flattering to Carmack—it implies he saw that BSP trees could be useful for
real-time video games when other people were still using the technique to
render static scenes. There is a similarly flattering story in <em>Masters of
Doom</em>: Kushner suggests that Carmack read Naylor’s paper and asked himself,
“what if you could use a BSP to create not just one 3D image but an entire
virtual world?”<sup id="fnref:7" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:7">7</a></sup></p>

<p>This framing ignores the history of the BSP tree. When those US Air Force
researchers first realized that partitioning a scene might help speed up
rendering, they were interested in speeding up <em>real-time</em> rendering, because
they were, after all, trying to create a flight simulator. The flight simulator
example comes up again in the 1980 BSP paper. Fuchs, Kedem, and Naylor talk
about how a BSP tree would be useful in a flight simulator that pilots use to
practice landing at the same airport over and over again. Since the airport
geometry never changes, the BSP tree can be generated just once. Clearly
what they have in mind is a real-time simulation. In the introduction to their
paper, they even motivate their research by talking about how real-time
graphics systems must be able to create an image in at least 1/30th of a
second.</p>

<p>So Carmack was not the first person to think of using BSP trees in a real-time
graphics simulation. Of course, it’s one thing to anticipate that BSP trees
might be used this way and another thing to actually do it. But even in the
implementation Carmack may have had more guidance than is commonly assumed. The
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_space_partitioning">Wikipedia page about BSP
trees</a>, at least as of
this writing, suggests that Carmack consulted a 1991 paper by Chen and Gordon
as well as a 1990 textbook called <em>Computer Graphics: Principles and Practice</em>.
Though no citation is provided for this claim, it is probably true. The 1991
Chen and Gordon paper outlines a front-to-back rendering approach using BSP
trees that is basically the same approach taken by <em>Doom</em>, right down to what
I’ve called the “implicit z-buffer” data structure that prevents farther
polygons being drawn over nearer polygons. The textbook provides a great
overview of BSP trees and some pseudocode both for building a tree and for
displaying one. (I’ve been able to skim through the 1990 edition thanks to my
wonderful university library.) <em>Computer Graphics: Principles and Practice</em> is
a classic text in computer graphics, so Carmack might well have owned it.</p>

<p>Still, Carmack found himself faced with a novel problem—”How can we make a
first-person shooter run on a computer with a CPU that can’t even do
floating-point operations?”—did his research, and proved that BSP trees are a
useful data structure for real-time video games. I still think that is an
impressive feat, even if the BSP tree had first been invented a decade prior
and was pretty well theorized by the time Carmack read about it. Perhaps
the accomplishment that we should really celebrate is the <em>Doom</em> game engine as
a whole, which is a seriously nifty piece of work. I’ve mentioned it once
already, but Fabien Sanglard’s book about the <em>Doom</em> game engine (<em>Game Engine
Black Book: DOOM</em>) is an excellent overview of all the different clever
components of the game engine and how they fit together. We shouldn’t forget
that the VSD problem was just one of many problems that Carmack had to solve to
make the <em>Doom</em> engine work. That he was able, on top of everything else, to
read about and implement a complicated data structure unknown to most
programmers speaks volumes about his technical expertise and his drive to
perfect his craft.</p>

        <h2>Getting Started with the Static Linux SDK</h2>
      </header>
    
  

  <p>It’s well known that Swift can be used to build software for Apple
platforms such as macOS or iOS, but Swift is also supported on other
platforms, including Linux and Windows.</p>

<p>Building for Linux is especially interesting because, historically,
Linux programs written in Swift needed to ensure that a copy of the
Swift runtime—and all of its dependencies—was installed on the
target system.  Additionally, a program built for a particular
distribution, or even a particular major version of a particular
distribution, would not necessarily run on any other distribution or
in some cases even on a different major version of the same
distribution.</p>

<p>The Swift Static Linux SDK solves both of these problems by allowing
you to build your program as a <em>fully statically linked</em> executable,
with no external dependencies at all (not even the C library), which
means that it will run on <em>any</em> Linux distribution as the only thing
it depends on is the Linux system call interface.</p>

<p>Additionally, the Static Linux SDK can be used from any platform
supported by the Swift compiler and package manager; this means that
you can develop and test your program on macOS before building and
deploying it to a Linux-based server, whether running locally or
somewhere in the cloud.</p>



<p><em>Linking</em> is the process of taking different pieces of a computer
program and wiring up any references between those pieces.  For
<em>static</em> linking, generally speaking those pieces are <em>object files</em>,
or <em>static libraries</em> (which are really just collections of object
files).</p>

<p>For <em>dynamic</em> linking, the pieces are <em>executables</em> and <em>dynamic
libraries</em> (aka dylibs, shared objects, or DLLs).</p>

<p>There are two key differences between dynamic and static linking:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The time at which linking takes place.  Static linking happens when
you build your program; dynamic linking happens at runtime.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact that a static library (or <em>archive</em>) is really a collection
of individual object files, whereas a dynamic library is monolithic.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The latter is important because traditionally, the static linker will
include every object explicitly listed on its command line, but it
will <em>only</em> include an object from a static library if doing so lets
it resolve an unresolved symbolic reference.  If you statically link
against a library that you do not actually use, a traditional static
linker will completely discard that library and not include any code
from it in your final binary.</p>

<p>In practice, things can be more complicated—the static linker may
actually work on the basis of individual <em>sections</em> or <em>atoms</em> from
your object files, so it may in fact be able to discard individual
functions or pieces of data rather than just whole objects.</p>

<h3 id="pros-and-cons-of-static-linking">Pros and Cons of Static Linking <a title="Permalink for Pros and Cons of Static Linking section" href="#pros-and-cons-of-static-linking">
            <!--?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?--> 
          </a></h3>

<p>Pros of static linking:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>No runtime overhead.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Only include code from libraries that is actually needed.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No need for separately installed dynamic libraries.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No versioning issues at runtime.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Cons of static linking:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Programs cannot share code (higher overall memory usage).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No way to update dependencies without rebuilding program.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Larger executables (though this can be offset by not having to
install separate dynamic libraries).</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>On Linux in particular, it’s also possible to use static linking to
completely eliminate dependencies on system libraries supplied by the
distribution, resulting in executables that work on any distribution
and can be installed by simply copying.</p>



<p>Before you start, it’s important to note:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>You will need to <a href="https://www.swift.org/install/">install an Open Source toolchain from
swift.org</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You cannot use the toolchain provided with Xcode to build programs
using the SDK.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If you are using macOS, you will also need to ensure that you use
the Swift compiler from this toolchain by <a href="https://www.swift.org/install/macos/package_installer/">following the
instructions
here</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The toolchain must match the version of the Static Linux SDK that
you install.  The Static Linux SDK includes the corresponding Swift
version in its filename to help identify the correct version of the
SDK.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Once that is out of the way, actually installing the Static Linux SDK
is easy; at a prompt, enter</p>

<div><pre><code><span>$</span><span> </span>swift sdk <span>install</span> &lt;URL-or-filename-here&gt;
</code></pre></div>

<p>giving the URL or filename at which the SDK can be found.</p>

<p>For instance, assuming you have installed the
<code>swift-6.0-DEVELOPMENT-SNAPSHOT-2024-06-06-a</code> toolchain, you would
need to enter</p>

<div><pre><code><span>$</span><span> </span>swift sdk <span>install </span>https://download.swift.org/development/static-sdk/swift-DEVELOPMENT-SNAPSHOT-2024-06-06-a/swift-DEVELOPMENT-SNAPSHOT-2024-06-06-a_static-linux-0.0.1.artifactbundle.tar.gz
</code></pre></div>

<p>to install the corresponding Static Linux SDK.</p>

<p>Swift will download and install the SDK on your system.  You can get a
list of installed SDKs with</p>



<p>and it’s also possible to remove them using</p>

<div><pre><code><span>$</span><span> </span>swift sdk remove &lt;name-of-SDK&gt;
</code></pre></div>



<p>First, create a directory to hold your code:</p>



<p>Next, ask Swift to create a new program package for you:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>$</span><span> </span>swift package init <span>--type</span> executable
</code></pre></div>

<p>You can build and run this locally:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>$</span><span> </span>swift build
<span>Building for debugging...
[8/8] Applying hello
Build complete! (15.29s)
</span><span>$</span><span> </span>.build/debug/hello
<span>Hello, world!
</span></code></pre></div>

<p>But with the Static Linux SDK installed, you can also build Linux
binaries for x86-64 and ARM64 machines:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>$</span><span> </span>swift build <span>--sdk</span> x86_64-swift-linux-musl
<span>Building for debugging...
[8/8] Linking hello
Build complete! (2.04s)
</span><span>$</span><span> </span>file .build/x86_64-swift-linux-musl/debug/hello
<span>.build/x86_64-swift-linux-musl/debug/hello: ELF 64-bit LSB executable, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), statically linked, with debug_info, not stripped
</span></code></pre></div>

<div><pre><code><span>$</span><span> </span>swift build <span>--sdk</span> aarch64-swift-linux-musl
<span>Building for debugging...
[8/8] Linking hello
Build complete! (2.00s)
</span><span>$</span><span> </span>file .build/aarch64-swift-linux-musl/debug/hello
<span>.build/aarch64-swift-linux-musl/debug/hello: ELF 64-bit LSB executable, ARM aarch64, version 1 (SYSV), statically linked, with debug_info, not stripped
</span></code></pre></div>

<p>These can be copied to an appropriate Linux-based system and executed:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>$</span><span> </span>scp .build/x86_64-swift-linux-musl/debug/hello linux:~/hello
<span>$</span><span> </span>ssh linux ~/hello
<span>Hello, world!
</span></code></pre></div>



<p>Swift packages that make use of Foundation or Swift NIO should just
work.  If you try to use a package that uses the C library, however,
you may have a little work to do.  Such packages often contain files
with code like the following:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>#if os(macOS) || os(iOS)</span>
<span>import</span> <span>Darwin</span>
<span>#elseif os(Linux)</span>
<span>import</span> <span>Glibc</span>
<span>#elseif os(Windows)</span>
<span>import</span> <span>ucrt</span>
<span>#else</span>
<span>#error(Unknown platform)</span>
<span>#endif</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>The Static Linux SDK does not use Glibc; instead, it is built on top
of an alternative C library for Linux called
<a href="https://musl-libc.org/">Musl</a>.  We chose this approach for two
reasons:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Musl has excellent support for static linking.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Musl is permissively licensed, which makes it easy to distribute
executables statically linked with it.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>If you are using such a dependency, you will therefore need to adjust
it to import the <code>Musl</code> module instead of the <code>Glibc</code> module:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>#if os(macOS) || os(iOS)</span>
<span>import</span> <span>Darwin</span>
<span>#elseif canImport(Glibc)</span>
<span>import</span> <span>Glibc</span>
<span>#elseif canImport(Musl)</span>
<span>import</span> <span>Musl</span>
<span>#elseif os(Windows)</span>
<span>import</span> <span>ucrt</span>
<span>#else</span>
<span>#error(Unknown platform)</span>
<span>#endif</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Occasionally there might be a difference between the way a C library
type gets imported between Musl and Glibc; this sometimes happens if
someone has added nullability annotations, or where a pointer type is
using a forward-declared <code>struct</code> for which no actual definition is
ever provided.  Usually the problem will be obvious—a function
argument or result will be <code>Optional</code> in one case and non-<code>Optional</code>
in another, or a pointer type will be imported as <code>OpaquePointer</code>
rather than <code>UnsafePointer&lt;FOO&gt;</code>.</p>

<p>If you do find yourself needing to make these kinds of adjustments,
you can make your local copy of the package dependency editable by
doing</p>

<div><pre><code><span>$</span><span> </span>swift package edit SomePackage
</code></pre></div>

<p>and then editing the files in the <code>Packages</code> directory that appears in
your program’s source directory.  You may wish to consider raising PRs
upstream with any fixes you may have.</p>

                    <h2 scrollto-destination="137577598" id="137577598" data-legacy-id="sec1">I. Introduction</h2>
<p>What is the rate of return in an economy? It is a simple question, but hard to answer. The rate of return plays a central role in current debates on inequality, secular stagnation, risk premiums, and the decline in the natural rate of interest, to name a few. A main contribution of this article is to introduce a large new data set on the total rates of return for all major asset classes, including housing—the largest but oft-ignored component of household wealth. Our data cover most advanced economies—16 in all—starting in 1870.</p><p>Although housing wealth is on average roughly one-half of national wealth in a typical economy (<span id="jumplink-bib56"></span>Piketty 2014), data on total housing returns (price appreciation plus rents) has been lacking (<span id="jumplink-bib65"></span>Shiller 2000 provides some historical data on house prices but not on rents). In this article we build on more comprehensive work on house prices (<span id="jumplink-bib41"></span>Knoll, Schularick, and Steger 2017) and newly constructed data on rents (<span id="jumplink-bib40"></span>Knoll 2017) to enable us to track the total returns of the largest component of the national capital stock.</p><p>We further construct total returns broken down into investment income (yield) and capital gains (price changes) for four major asset classes, two of them typically seen as relatively risky—equities and housing—and two of them typically seen as relatively safe—government bonds and short-term bills. Importantly, we compute actual asset returns taken from market data and therefore construct more detailed series than returns inferred from wealth estimates in discrete benchmark years for a few countries, as in <span id="jumplink-bib56"></span>Piketty (2014).</p><p>We also follow earlier work in documenting annual equity, bond, and bill returns, but here again we have taken the project further. We recompute all these measures from original sources, improve the links across some important historical market discontinuities (e.g., market closures and other gaps associated with wars and political instability), and in a number of cases we access new and previously unused raw data sources. In all cases, we have also brought in auxiliary sources to validate our data externally, and 100+ pages of online material documents our sources and methods. Our work provides researchers with the first broad noncommercial database of historical equity, bond, and bill returns—and the only database of housing returns—with the most extensive coverage across both countries and years.<sup><span id="jumplink-fn1"></span>1</sup></p><p>This article aims to bridge the gap between two related strands of the academic literature. The first strand is rooted in finance and is concerned with long-run returns on different assets. <span id="jumplink-bib15"></span>Dimson, Marsh, and Staunton (2009) probably marked the first comprehensive attempt to document and analyze long-run returns on investment for a broad cross-section of countries. Meanwhile, <span id="jumplink-bib32"></span>Homer and Sylla (2005) pioneered a multidecade project to document the history of interest rates.</p><p>The second related strand of literature is the analysis of comparative national balance sheets over time, as in <span id="jumplink-bib27"></span>Goldsmith (1985). More recently, <span id="jumplink-bib58"></span>Piketty and Zucman (2014) have brought together data from national accounts and other sources tracking the development of national wealth over long time periods. They also calculate rates of return on capital by dividing aggregate capital income in the national accounts by the aggregate value of capital, also from national accounts.</p><p>Our work is both complementary and supplementary to theirs. It is complementary because the asset price perspective and the national accounts approach are ultimately tied together by accounting rules and identities. Using market valuations, we are able to corroborate and improve the estimates of returns on capital that matter for wealth inequality dynamics. Our long-run return data are also supplementary to the work of <span id="jumplink-bib58"></span>Piketty and Zucman (2014) in the sense that we greatly extend the number of countries for which we can calculate real rates of return back to the late nineteenth century.</p><p>The evidence we gathered can shed light on active research debates reaching from asset pricing to inequality. For example, in one contentious area of research, the accumulation of capital, the expansion of capital’s share in income, and the growth rate of the economy relative to the rate of return on capital all feature centrally in the current debate sparked by <span id="jumplink-bib56"></span>Piketty (2014) on the evolution of wealth, income, and inequality. What do the long-run patterns on the rates of return on different asset classes have to say about these possible drivers of inequality?</p><p>In many financial theories, preferences over current versus future consumption, attitudes toward risk, and covariation with consumption risk all show up in the premiums that the rates of return on risky assets carry over safe assets. Returns on different asset classes and their correlations with consumption sit at the core of the canonical consumption Euler equation that underpins textbook asset pricing theory (see, e.g., <span id="jumplink-bib49"></span>Mehra and Prescott 1985). But tensions remain between theory and data, prompting further explorations of new asset pricing paradigms, including behavioral finance. Our new data add another risky asset class to the mix, housing, and with it come new challenges.</p><p>In another strand of research triggered by the financial crisis, <span id="jumplink-bib70"></span>Summers (2014) seeks to revive the secular stagnation hypothesis first advanced in Alvin <span id="jumplink-bib30"></span>Hansen’s <span id="jumplink-bib30"></span>(1939) AEA presidential address. Demographic trends are pushing the world’s economies into uncharted territory as the relative weight of borrowers and savers is changing, and with it the possibility increases that the interest rate will fall by an insufficient amount to balance saving and investment at full employment. What is the evidence that this is the case?</p><p>Last, in a related problem within the sphere of monetary economics, <span id="jumplink-bib31"></span>Holston, Laubach, and Williams (2017) show that estimates of the natural rate of interest in several advanced economies have gradually declined over the past four decades and are now near zero. What historical precedents are there for such low real rates that could inform today’s policy makers, investors, and researchers?</p><p>The common thread running through these broad research topics is the notion that the rate of return is central to understanding long-, medium-, and short-run economic fluctuations. But which rate of return? And how do we measure it? For a given scarcity of funding supply, the risky rate is a measure of the profitability of private investment; in contrast, the safe rate plays an important role in benchmarking compensation for risk and is often tied to discussions of monetary policy settings and the notion of the natural rate. Below, we summarize our main findings.</p>                    <h3 scrollto-destination="137577611" id="137577611" data-legacy-id="sec1-1">I.A. Main Findings</h3>
<p>We present four main findings:</p>                    <h4 scrollto-destination="137577613" id="137577613" data-legacy-id="sec1-1-1">1. On Risky Returns, <em>r</em><sup><em>risky</em></sup></h4>
<p>In terms of total returns, residential real estate and equities have shown very similar and high real total gains, on average about 7% a year. Housing outperformed equities before World War II. Since World War II, equities have outperformed housing on average but had much higher volatility and higher synchronicity with the business cycle. The observation that housing returns are similar to equity returns, but much less volatile, is puzzling. Like <span id="jumplink-bib65"></span>Shiller (2000), we find that long-run capital gains on housing are relatively low, around 1% a year in real terms, and considerably lower than capital gains in the stock market. However, the rental yield component is typically considerably higher and more stable than the dividend yield of equities so that total returns are of comparable magnitude.</p><p>Before World War II, the real returns on housing and equities (and safe assets) followed remarkably similar trajectories. After World War II this was no longer the case, and across countries equities then experienced more frequent and correlated booms and busts. The low covariance of equity and housing returns reveals that there could be significant aggregate diversification gains (i.e., for a representative agent) from holding the two asset classes.</p>                    <h4 scrollto-destination="137577616" id="137577616" data-legacy-id="sec1-1-2">2. On Safe Returns, <em>r</em><sup><em>safe</em></sup></h4>
<p>We find that the real safe asset return (bonds and bills) has been very volatile over the long run, more so than one might expect, and often even more volatile than real risky returns. Each world war was (unsurprisingly) a moment of very low safe rates, well below zero. So was the 1970s stagflation. The peaks in the real safe rate took place at the start of our sample, in the interwar period, and during the mid-1980s fight against inflation. In fact, the long decline observed in the past few decades is reminiscent of the secular decline that took place from 1870 to World War I. Viewed from a long-run perspective, the past decline and current low level of the real safe rate today is not unusual. The puzzle may well be why the safe rate was so high in the mid-1980s rather than why has it declined ever since.</p><p>Safe returns have been low on average in the full sample, falling in the 1%–3% range for most countries and peacetime periods. While this combination of low returns and high volatility has offered a relatively poor risk-return trade-off to investors, the low returns have also eased the pressure on government finances, in particular allowing for a rapid debt reduction in the aftermath of World War II.</p>                    <h4 scrollto-destination="137577619" id="137577619" data-legacy-id="sec1-1-3">3. On the Risk Premium, <em>r</em><sup><em>risky</em></sup> − <em>r</em><sup><em>safe</em></sup></h4>
<p>Over the very long run, the risk premium has been volatile. Our data uncover substantial swings in the risk premium at lower frequencies that sometimes endured for decades and far exceed the amplitudes of business-cycle swings.</p><p>In most peacetime eras, this premium has been stable at about 4%–5%. But risk premiums stayed curiously and persistently high from the 1950s to the 1970s, long after the conclusion of World War II. However, there is no visible long-run trend, and mean reversion appears strong. Interestingly, the bursts of the risk premium in the wartime and interwar years were mostly a phenomenon of collapsing safe returns rather than dramatic spikes in risky returns.</p><p>In fact, the risky return has often been smoother and more stable than the safe return, averaging about 6%–8% across all eras. Recently, with safe returns low and falling, the risk premium has widened due to a parallel but smaller decline in risky returns. But these shifts keep the two rates of return close to their normal historical range. Whether due to shifts in risk aversion or to other phenomena, the fact that safe returns seem to absorb almost all of these adjustments seems like a puzzle in need of further exploration and explanation.</p>                    <h4 scrollto-destination="137577623" id="137577623" data-legacy-id="sec1-1-4">4. On Returns Minus Growth, <em>r</em><sup><em>wealth</em></sup> − <em>g</em></h4>
<p><span id="jumplink-bib56"></span>Piketty (2014) argued that if investors’ return to wealth exceeded the rate of economic growth, rentiers would accumulate wealth at a faster rate and thus worsen wealth inequality. Using a measure of portfolio returns to compute “<em>r</em> minus <em>g</em>” in Piketty’s notation, we uncover an important finding. Even calculated from more granular asset price returns data, the same fact reported in <span id="jumplink-bib56"></span>Piketty (2014) holds true for more countries, more years, and more dramatically: namely, <em>r</em> ≫ <em>g</em>.</p><p>In fact, the only exceptions to that rule happen in the years in or around wartime. In peacetime, <em>r</em> has always been much greater than <em>g</em>. In the pre-World War II period, this gap was on average 5% (excluding World War I). As of today, this gap is still quite large, about 3%–4%, though it narrowed to 2% in the 1970s before widening in the years leading up to the global financial crisis.</p><p>One puzzle that emerges from our analysis is that while <em>r</em> minus <em>g</em> fluctuates over time, it does not seem to do so systematically with the growth rate of the economy. This feature of the data poses a conundrum for the battling views of factor income, distribution, and substitution in the ongoing debate (<span id="jumplink-bib61"></span>Rognlie 2015). The fact that returns to wealth have remained fairly high and stable while aggregate wealth increased rapidly since the 1970s suggests that capital accumulation may have contributed to the decline in the labor share of income over the recent decades (<span id="jumplink-bib39"></span>Karabarbounis and Neiman 2014). In thinking about inequality and several other characteristics of modern economies, the new data on the return to capital that we present here should spur further research.</p>                    <h2 scrollto-destination="137577627" id="137577627" data-legacy-id="sec2">II. A New Historical Global Returns Database</h2>
<p>In this section, we discuss the main sources and definitions for the calculation of long-run returns. A major innovation is the inclusion of housing. Residential real estate is the main asset in most household portfolios, as we shall see, but so far very little has been known about long-run returns on housing. Our data on housing returns cover capital gains and imputed rents to owners and renters, the sum of the two being total returns.<sup><span id="jumplink-fn2"></span>2</sup> Equity return data for publicly traded equities are used, as is standard, as a proxy for aggregate business equity returns.<sup><span id="jumplink-fn3"></span>3</sup></p><p>The data include nominal and real returns on bills, bonds, equities, and residential real estate for Australia, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and the United States.

<p>The canonical risk-free rate is taken to be the yield on Treasury bills, that is, short-term, fixed-income government securities. The yield data come from the latest vintage of the long-run macrohistory database (<span id="jumplink-bib38"></span>Jordà, Schularick, and Taylor 2017).<sup><span id="jumplink-fn8"></span>8</sup> Whenever data on Treasury bill returns were unavailable, we relied on either money market rates or deposit rates of banks from <span id="jumplink-bib72"></span>Zimmermann (2017). Because short-term government debt was rarely used and issued in the earlier historical period, much of our bill rate data before the 1960s actually consist of deposit rates.<sup><span id="jumplink-fn9"></span>9</sup></p>                    <h4 scrollto-destination="137577641" id="137577641" data-legacy-id="sec2-2-2">2. Bond Returns</h4>
<p>These are conventionally the total returns on long-term government bonds. Unlike earlier cross-country studies, we focus on the bonds listed and traded on local exchanges and denominated in local currency. This focus makes bond returns more comparable with the returns of bills, equities, and housing. Moreover, this results in a larger sample of bonds, and on bonds that are more likely to be held by the representative household in the respective country. For some countries and periods we have made use of listings on major global exchanges to fill gaps where domestic markets were thin or local exchange data were not available (for example, Australian bonds listed in New York or London). Throughout the sample we target a maturity of around 10&nbsp;years. For the second half of the twentieth century, the maturity of government bonds is generally accurately defined. For the pre-World War II period we sometimes had to rely on data for perpetuals, that is, very long-term government securities (such as the British consol). Although as a convention we refer here to government bills and bonds as “safe” assets, both are naturally exposed to inflation and default risk, for example. In fact, real returns on these assets fluctuate substantially over time, as we shall see (specifically, Sections&nbsp;<span id="jumplink-sec5"></span><a href="#sec5">V</a> and <span id="jumplink-sec6"></span><a href="#sec6">VI</a>).</p>                    <h4 scrollto-destination="137577643" id="137577643" data-legacy-id="sec2-2-3">3. Equity Returns</h4>
<p>These returns come from a broad range of sources, including articles in economic and financial history journals, yearbooks of statistical offices and central banks, stock exchange listings, newspapers, and company reports. Throughout most of the sample, we aim to rely on indices weighted by market capitalization of individual stocks and a stock selection that is representative of the entire stock market. For some historical time periods in individual countries, however, we also make use of indices weighted by company book capital, by stock market transactions, or weighted equally due to limited data availability.</p>                    <h4 scrollto-destination="137577645" id="137577645" data-legacy-id="sec2-2-4">4. Housing Returns</h4>
<p>We combine the long-run house price series introduced by <span id="jumplink-bib41"></span>Knoll, Schularick, and Steger (2017) with a novel data set on rents drawn from the PhD thesis of <span id="jumplink-bib40"></span>Knoll (2017). For most countries, the rent series rely on the rent components of the cost of living of consumer price indices constructed by national statistical offices. We then combine them with information from other sources to create long-run series reaching back to the late nineteenth century. To proxy the total return on the residential housing stock, our returns include both rented housing and owner-occupied properties.<sup><span id="jumplink-fn10"></span>10</sup> Specifically, wherever possible we use house price and rental indices that include the prices of owner-occupied properties and the imputed rents on these houses. Imputed rents estimate the rent that an owner-occupied house would earn on the rental market, typically by using rents of similar houses that are rented. This means that, in principle, imputed rents are similar to market rents and are simply adjusted for the portfolio composition of owner-occupied as opposed to rented housing. Imputed rents, however, are not directly observed and hence are less precisely measured than market rents, and are typically not taxed.<sup><span id="jumplink-fn11"></span>11</sup> To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to calculate total returns to housing in the literature for as long and as comprehensive a cross section of economies as we report.</p>                    <h4 scrollto-destination="137577647" id="137577647" data-legacy-id="sec2-2-5">5. Composite Returns</h4>
<p>We compute the rate of return on safe assets, risky assets, and aggregate wealth, as weighted averages of the individual asset returns. To obtain a representative return from the investor’s perspective, we use the outstanding stocks of the respective asset in a given country as weights. To this end, we make use of new data on equity market capitalization (from <span id="jumplink-bib44"></span>Kuvshinov and Zimmermann 2018) and housing wealth for each country and period in our sample and combine them with existing estimates of public debt stocks to obtain the weights for the individual assets.

<div><p>The total annual return on any financial asset can be divided into two components: the capital gain from the change in the asset price <em>P</em>, and a yield component <em>Y</em>, that reflects the cash-flow return on an investment.

We construct estimates for total returns on housing using the rent-price approach. This approach starts from a benchmark rent-price ratio <span>|$(\frac{RI_0}{HPI_0})$|</span> estimated in a baseline year (<em>t</em> = 0). For this ratio we rely on net rental yields from the Investment Property Database (IPD).<sup><span id="jumplink-fn13"></span>13</sup> We can then construct a time series of returns by combining separate information from a country-specific house price index series <span>|$(\frac{HPI_t}{HPI_0})$|</span> and a country-specific rent index series <span>|$(\frac{RI_t}{RI_0})$|⁠</span>. For these indices, we rely on prior work on housing prices (<span id="jumplink-bib41"></span>Knoll, Schularick, and Steger 2017) and new data on rents (<span id="jumplink-bib40"></span>Knoll 2017). This method assumes that the indices cover a representative portfolio of houses. Under this assumption, there is no need to correct for changes in the housing stock, and only information about the growth rates in prices and rents is necessary.</p><div><p>Hence, a time series of the rent-price ratio can be derived from forward and back projection as </p><div><div id="equ10" content-id="equ10"><p> \begin{equation}

We verify and adjust rent-price approach estimates using a range of alternative sources. The main source for comparison is the balance sheet approach to rental yields, which calculates the rent-price ratio using national accounts data on total rental income and housing wealth. The “balance sheet” rental yield <span>|$RY^{BS}_t$|</span> is calculated as the ratio of total net rental income to total housing wealth: </p><div><div id="equ12" content-id="equ12"><p> \begin{equation}
RY^{BS}_t = \frac{\text{Net rental income}_t}{\text{Housing Wealth}_t}.
\end{equation} </p></div><p><span>(12)</span></p></div><p>This balance sheet rental yield estimate can then be added to the capital gains series to compute the total return on housing from the balance sheet perspective. We also collect additional point-in-time estimates of net rental yields from contemporary sources, such as newspaper advertisements. These measures are less sensitive to the accumulated extrapolation errors in <span id="jumplink-equ10"></span><a href="#equ10">equation&nbsp;(10)</a> but are themselves measured relatively imprecisely.<sup><span id="jumplink-fn14"></span>14</sup> Wherever the rent-price approach estimates diverge from these historical sources, we make adjustments to benchmark the rent-price ratio estimates to these alternative historical measures of the rental yield. We construct two additional housing return series—one benchmarked to all available alternative yield estimates, and another using primarily the balance sheet approach. The results of this exercise are discussed in <span id="jumplink-sec3-3"></span><a href="#sec3-3">Section&nbsp;III.C</a>.

<p>Our headline summary data appear in <span id="jumplink-tblII"></span>Table&nbsp;II and <span id="jumplink-fig2"></span>Figure&nbsp;II. The top panel of <span id="jumplink-tblII"></span>Table&nbsp;II shows the full sample (1870–2015) results, and the bottom panel shows results for the post-1950 sample. Note that here, and throughout the article, rates of return are always annualized. Units are always expressed in percent per year, for raw data and for means and standard deviations. All means are arithmetic means, except when specifically referred to as geometric means.<sup><span id="jumplink-fn15"></span>15</sup> Data are pooled and equally weighted, that is, they are raw rather than portfolio returns. We always include wars so that results are not polluted by bias from omitted disasters. We do, however, exclude hyperinflation years (but only a few) to focus on the underlying trends in returns and to avoid biases from serious measurement errors in hyperinflation years, arising from the impossible retrospective task of matching within-year timing of asset and CPI price level readings, which can create a spurious, massive under- or overstatement of returns in these episodes.<sup><span id="jumplink-fn16"></span>16</sup></p>                    <div data-id="fig2" data-content-id="fig2" swap-content-for-modal="true"><p><img src="https://oup.silverchair-cdn.com/oup/backfile/Content_public/Journal/qje/134/3/10.1093_qje_qjz012/1/m_qjz012fig2.jpeg?Expires=1721159455&amp;Signature=A-tkdsJV1rhWFkMiqcJynm3qD-qawWc-tlq3dK48l2z345Jd3OUA0lOCzmznvkinKkoOUH6MymMdifRMoI8IIAhC8JqfuLUkCa~m9O~yMiKmLWzxUs37f5GqX~7R5zr-YhsWA0HSKB47dvBGOYPtH53gn7qWwxA1QuilODRu1LKPJW8h~M54AyZSuFh6fludS7x-MMflJdoPz8xxXlQUFvAQobusGmZx9IJU7nDXAI5NQx~JAG~5KzuYitXUfSLXzQnV4dCq74wlx3fxaSfquRz1Z9fgbj6xBzhlmy2mObim-ehrMD2oOBora9NGxRGysS7irF02N5DXw-SCd4YDgA__&amp;Key-Pair-Id=APKAIE5G5CRDK6RD3PGA" alt="Global Real Rates of Return" data-path-from-xml=""></p><div><p>Figure II</p><div><p>Global Real Rates of Return</p><p>Color version available online.

Although returns on housing and equities are similar, the volatility of housing returns is substantially lower, as <span id="jumplink-tblII"></span>Table&nbsp;II shows. Returns on the two asset classes are in the same ballpark—around 7%—but the standard deviation of housing returns is substantially smaller than that of equities (10% for housing versus 22% for equities). Predictably, with thinner tails, the compounded return (using the geometric average) is vastly better for housing than for equities—6.6% for housing versus 4.7% for equities. This finding appears to contradict one of the basic tenets of modern valuation models: higher risks should come with higher rewards.</p><p>Differences in asset returns are not driven by unusual events in the early pre-World War II part of the sample. <span id="jumplink-tblII"></span>Table&nbsp;II, Panel B makes this point. Compared to the full sample results in the top panel, the same clear pattern emerges: stocks and real estate dominate in terms of returns. Moreover, average returns post–1950 are similar to those for the full sample even though the postwar subperiod excludes the devastating effects of the two world wars.

Comparison To Existing Literature</h3>
<p>Earlier work on asset returns has mainly focused on equities and the corresponding risk premium over safe assets (bills or bonds), starting with Shiller’s analysis of historical U.S. data (<span id="jumplink-bib64"></span>Shiller 1981), later extended to cover post-1920 Sweden and the United Kingdom (<span id="jumplink-bib11"></span>Campbell 1999), and other advanced economies back to 1900 (<span id="jumplink-bib15"></span>Dimson, Marsh, and Staunton 2009) or back to 1870 (<span id="jumplink-bib6"></span>Barro and Ursúa 2008). The general consensus in this literature is that equities earn a large premium over safe assets. The cross-country estimates of this premium vary between 7% in <span id="jumplink-bib6"></span>Barro and Ursúa (2008) and 6% in <span id="jumplink-bib15"></span>Dimson, Marsh, and Staunton (2009) using arithmetic means. <span id="jumplink-bib11"></span>Campbell (1999) documents a 4.7% geometric mean return premium instead.</p><p>We find a similarly high, though smaller, equity premium using our somewhat larger and more consistent historical data set. Our estimate of the risk premium stands at 5.9% using arithmetic means and 3.8% using geometric means (see <span id="jumplink-tblII"></span>Table&nbsp;II). This is lower than the estimates by <span id="jumplink-bib11"></span>Campbell (1999) and <span id="jumplink-bib6"></span>Barro and Ursúa (2008). The average risk premium is similar to that found by <span id="jumplink-bib15"></span>Dimson, Marsh, and Staunton (2009), but our returns tend to be slightly lower for the overlapping time period.<sup><span id="jumplink-fn17"></span>17</sup> Details aside, our data confirm the central finding of the literature on equity market returns: stocks earn a large premium over safe assets.</p><p>Studies on historical housing returns, starting with the seminal work of Robert Shiller (see <span id="jumplink-bib65"></span>Shiller 2000 for a summary), have largely focused on capital gains. The rental yield component has received relatively little attention and in many cases is missing entirely. Most of the literature pre-dating our work has therefore lacked the necessary data to calculate, infer, or discuss the total rates of return on housing over the long run. The few studies that take rents into account generally focus on the post-1970s U.S. sample and often on commercial real estate. Most existing evidence either places the real estate risk premium between equities and bonds or finds that it is similar to that for equities (see <span id="jumplink-bib63"></span>Ruff 2007; <span id="jumplink-bib23"></span>Francis and Ibbotson 2009; <span id="jumplink-bib33"></span>Ilmanen 2011; <span id="jumplink-bib20"></span>Favilukis, Ludvigson, and Van Nieuwerburgh 2017). Some studies have even found that over the recent period, real estate seems to outperform equities in risk-adjusted terms (<span id="jumplink-bib66"></span>Shilling 2003; <span id="jumplink-bib12"></span>Cheng, Lin, and Liu 2008).</p><p>The stylized fact from the studies on long-run housing capital appreciation is that over long horizons, house prices only grow a little faster than the consumer price index. But again, note that this is only the capital gain component in <span id="jumplink-equ1"></span><a href="#equ1">equation (1)</a>. Low levels of real capital gains to housing was shown by <span id="jumplink-bib65"></span>Shiller (2000) for the United States, and is also true, although to a lesser extent, in other countries, as documented in <span id="jumplink-bib41"></span>Knoll, Schularick, and Steger (2017). Our long-run average capital appreciation data for the United States largely come from <span id="jumplink-bib65"></span>Shiller (2000), with two exceptions. For the 1930s, we use the more representative index of <span id="jumplink-bib21"></span>Fishback and Kollmann (2015) that documents a larger fall in prices during the Great Depression. From 1975 onward, we use a Federal Housing Finance Agency index, which has a slightly broader coverage. <span data-supplement-target="sup1"></span><span><a path-from-xml="sup1" href="https://oup.silverchair-cdn.com/oup/backfile/Content_public/Journal/qje/134/3/10.1093_qje_qjz012/1/qjz012_supplemental_appendix.pdf?Expires=1721159455&amp;Signature=TzSlNdhKgqBoNIO0PrCITV0wbOIpt3YVfG~DD8WSXzDEa9ePp1ABHhyt8W1rzGcVgD1H-7H1XSGY~MyPibs7JggiC3p6GSYD2hM37L-Ejkrbbikmgmh1abAdnZycrBer1RKSqhugcR-gF5SuijD9he3smc-~TU7RhdGHrke09JT4TIPduYgM2yaCz~ZSMDSSy-EMA7V~Vo6pAPtGQRNrXz5Y7Pu7aaYh9wRrBnY067yfDTe6gaoYsKN0Yesbq2Aral1blEKnzeF2GfzaX7toBdauzszS0TJSA3d2auLB0oSByw5rz8LukDQk6gVE~g0EH6Vb2L5u85RCH9mp2994Mw__&amp;Key-Pair-Id=APKAIE5G5CRDK6RD3PGA">Online Appendix</a></span> M compares our series with Shiller’s data and finds that switching to Shiller’s index has no effect on our results for the United States.

Prior to our work on historical rental yields, this finding could not be known. Coincidentally, in our long-run data we find that most of the real equity return also comes from the dividend yield rather than from real equity capital gains, which are low, especially before the 1980s. Thus the post-1980 observation of large capital gain components in equity and housing total returns is completely unrepresentative of the normal long-run patterns in the data, another fact underappreciated before now.</p><p>Data on historical returns for all major asset classes allow us to compute the return on aggregate wealth (see <span id="jumplink-equ7"></span><a href="#equ7">equation&nbsp;(7)</a>). In turn, this return can be decomposed into various components by asset class, and into capital gains and yields, to better understand the drivers of aggregate wealth fluctuations. This connects our study to the literature on capital income and the stock of capital (or wealth) from a national accounts perspective. Even though national accounts and national balance sheet estimates have existed for some time (see <span id="jumplink-bib45"></span>Kuznets 1941; <span id="jumplink-bib27"></span>Goldsmith 1985), only recently have scholars systematized and compared these data to calculate a series of returns on national wealth.<sup><span id="jumplink-fn18"></span>18</sup></p><p><span id="jumplink-bib57"></span>Piketty, Saez, and Zucman (2018) compute balance sheet returns on aggregate wealth and for individual asset classes using post-1913 U.S. data.

Housing returns are very similar. However, equity returns are several percentage points above our estimates and those in the market-based returns literature more generally. Part of this difference reflects the fact that balance sheet returns are computed to measure income before corporate taxes, whereas our returns take the household perspective and are therefore net of corporate tax. Another explanation for the difference is likely to come from some measurement error in the national accounts data.<sup><span id="jumplink-fn19"></span>19</sup> When it comes to housing, our rental yield estimates are broadly comparable and similar to those derived using the balance sheet approach, for a broad selection of countries and historical time spans.<sup><span id="jumplink-fn20"></span>20</sup></p><p>Our data set complements the market-based return literature by increasing the coverage in terms of assets, return components, countries, and years; improving data consistency and documentation; and making the data set freely available for future research.

Accuracy of Equity Returns</h3>
<p>The literature on equity returns has highlighted two main sources of bias in the data: weighting and sample selection. Weighting biases arise when the stock portfolio weights for the index do not correspond with those of a representative investor or a representative agent in the economy. Selection biases arise when the selection of stocks does not correspond to the portfolio of the representative investor or agent. This second category also includes issues of survivorship bias and missing data bias arising from stock exchange closures and restrictions.</p><p>We consider how these biases affect our equity return estimates in this section.

Weighting Bias</h4>
<p>The best practice when weighting equity indices is to use market capitalization of individual stocks. This approach most closely mirrors the composition of a hypothetical representative investor’s portfolio. Equally-weighted indices are likely to overweight smaller firms, which tend to carry higher returns and higher volatility.</p><p>The existing evidence from historical returns on the Brussels and Paris stock exchanges suggests that using equally-weighted indices biases returns up by around 0.5 percentage points, and their standard deviation up by 2–3 percentage points (<span id="jumplink-bib47"></span>Le Bris and Hautcoeur 2010; <span id="jumplink-bib2"></span>Annaert et al. 2011). The size of the bias, however, is likely to vary across markets and time periods. For example, <span id="jumplink-bib29"></span>Grossman (2017) shows that the market-weighted portfolio of UK stocks outperformed its equally-weighted counterpart over the period 1869–1929.</p><p>To minimize this bias, we use market-capitalization-weighted indices for the vast majority of our sample (see <span data-supplement-target="sup1"></span><span><a path-from-xml="sup1" href="https://oup.silverchair-cdn.com/oup/backfile/Content_public/Journal/qje/134/3/10.1093_qje_qjz012/1/qjz012_supplemental_appendix.pdf?Expires=1721159455&amp;Signature=TzSlNdhKgqBoNIO0PrCITV0wbOIpt3YVfG~DD8WSXzDEa9ePp1ABHhyt8W1rzGcVgD1H-7H1XSGY~MyPibs7JggiC3p6GSYD2hM37L-Ejkrbbikmgmh1abAdnZycrBer1RKSqhugcR-gF5SuijD9he3smc-~TU7RhdGHrke09JT4TIPduYgM2yaCz~ZSMDSSy-EMA7V~Vo6pAPtGQRNrXz5Y7Pu7aaYh9wRrBnY067yfDTe6gaoYsKN0Yesbq2Aral1blEKnzeF2GfzaX7toBdauzszS0TJSA3d2auLB0oSByw5rz8LukDQk6gVE~g0EH6Vb2L5u85RCH9mp2994Mw__&amp;Key-Pair-Id=APKAIE5G5CRDK6RD3PGA">Online Appendix</a></span> Table&nbsp;A.29 and <span data-supplement-target="sup1"></span><span><a path-from-xml="sup1" href="https://oup.silverchair-cdn.com/oup/backfile/Content_public/Journal/qje/134/3/10.1093_qje_qjz012/1/qjz012_supplemental_appendix.pdf?Expires=1721159455&amp;Signature=TzSlNdhKgqBoNIO0PrCITV0wbOIpt3YVfG~DD8WSXzDEa9ePp1ABHhyt8W1rzGcVgD1H-7H1XSGY~MyPibs7JggiC3p6GSYD2hM37L-Ejkrbbikmgmh1abAdnZycrBer1RKSqhugcR-gF5SuijD9he3smc-~TU7RhdGHrke09JT4TIPduYgM2yaCz~ZSMDSSy-EMA7V~Vo6pAPtGQRNrXz5Y7Pu7aaYh9wRrBnY067yfDTe6gaoYsKN0Yesbq2Aral1blEKnzeF2GfzaX7toBdauzszS0TJSA3d2auLB0oSByw5rz8LukDQk6gVE~g0EH6Vb2L5u85RCH9mp2994Mw__&amp;Key-Pair-Id=APKAIE5G5CRDK6RD3PGA">Online Appendix</a></span> X). Where market capitalization weighting was not available, we have generally used alternative weights such as book capital or transaction volumes, rather than equally-weighted averages. For the few equally-weighted indices that remain in our sample, the overall impact on aggregate return estimates ought to be negligible.</p>                    <h4 scrollto-destination="137577690" id="137577690" data-legacy-id="sec3-2-2">2. Selection and Survivorship Bias</h4>
<p>Relying on an index whose selection does not mirror the representative investor’s portfolio carries two main dangers. First, a small sample may be unrepresentative of overall stock market returns. Second, a sample that is selected ad hoc, and especially ex post, is likely to focus on surviving firms, or successful firms, thus overstating investment returns. This second bias extends not only to stock prices but also to dividend payments, as some historical studies only consider dividend-paying firms.<sup><span id="jumplink-fn21"></span>21</sup> The magnitude of survivorship bias has generally been found to be around 0.5 to 1 percentage point (<span id="jumplink-bib53"></span>Nielsen and Risager 2001; <span id="jumplink-bib3"></span>Annaert, Buelens, and De Ceuster 2012), but in some time periods and markets it could be larger (see <span id="jumplink-bib47"></span>Le Bris and Hautcoeur 2010 for France).</p><p>As a first best, we always strive to use all-share indices that avoid survivor and selection biases. For some countries and time periods where no such indices were previously available, we have constructed new weighted all-share indices from original historical sources (e.g., early historical data for Norway and Spain). Where an all-share index was not available or newly constructed, we have generally relied on blue-chip stock market indices. These are based on an ex ante value-weighted sample of the largest firms on the market. It is updated each year and tends to capture the lion’s share of total market capitalization. Because the sample is selected ex ante, it avoids ex post selection and survivorship biases. Because historical equity markets have tended to be quite concentrated, blue-chip indices have been shown to be a good proxy for all-share returns (see <span id="jumplink-bib2"></span>Annaert et al. 2011). Finally, we include non-dividend-paying firms in the dividend yield calculation.</p>                    <h4 scrollto-destination="137577693" id="137577693" data-legacy-id="sec3-2-3">3. Stock Market Closures and Trading Restrictions</h4>
<p>A more subtle form of selection bias arises when the stock market is closed and no market price data are available. One way of dealing with closures is to simply exclude them from the baseline return comparisons. But this implicitly assumes that the data are “missing at random”—that is, that stock market closures are unrelated to underlying equity returns. Existing research on rare disasters and equity premiums shows that this is unlikely to be true (<span id="jumplink-bib52"></span>Nakamura et al. 2013). Stock markets tend to be closed precisely when we would expect returns to be low, such as periods of war and civil unrest. Return estimates that exclude such rare disasters from the data will thus overstate stock returns.</p><p>To guard against this bias, we include return estimates for the periods of stock market closure in our sample. Where possible, we rely on alternative data sources to fill the gap, such as listings of other exchanges and over-the-counter transactions—for example, in the case of World War I Germany we use the over-the-counter index from <span id="jumplink-bib62"></span>Ronge (2002) and for World War II France we use the newspaper index from <span id="jumplink-bib47"></span>Le Bris and Hautcoeur (2010). In cases where alternative data are not available, we interpolate the prices of securities listed before and after the exchange was closed to estimate the return (if no dividend data are available, we also assume no dividends were paid).<sup><span id="jumplink-fn22"></span>22</sup></p><p>Even though this approach only gives us a rough proxy of returns, it is certainly better than excluding these periods, which effectively assumes that the return during stock market closures is the same as when the stock markets are open. In the end, we only have one instance of stock market closure for which we are unable to estimate returns—that of the Tokyo stock exchange in 1946–1947. <span data-supplement-target="sup1"></span><span><a path-from-xml="sup1" href="https://oup.silverchair-cdn.com/oup/backfile/Content_public/Journal/qje/134/3/10.1093_qje_qjz012/1/qjz012_supplemental_appendix.pdf?Expires=1721159455&amp;Signature=TzSlNdhKgqBoNIO0PrCITV0wbOIpt3YVfG~DD8WSXzDEa9ePp1ABHhyt8W1rzGcVgD1H-7H1XSGY~MyPibs7JggiC3p6GSYD2hM37L-Ejkrbbikmgmh1abAdnZycrBer1RKSqhugcR-gF5SuijD9he3smc-~TU7RhdGHrke09JT4TIPduYgM2yaCz~ZSMDSSy-EMA7V~Vo6pAPtGQRNrXz5Y7Pu7aaYh9wRrBnY067yfDTe6gaoYsKN0Yesbq2Aral1blEKnzeF2GfzaX7toBdauzszS0TJSA3d2auLB0oSByw5rz8LukDQk6gVE~g0EH6Vb2L5u85RCH9mp2994Mw__&amp;Key-Pair-Id=APKAIE5G5CRDK6RD3PGA">Online Appendix</a></span> H further assesses the impact of return interpolation on the key moments of our data and finds that over the full sample, it is negligible.</p><p><span id="jumplink-tblIII"></span>Table&nbsp;III shows the estimated stock returns during the periods of stock exchange closure in our sample.

These measures are more likely to affect the timing of returns rather than their long-run average level and should have little impact on our headline estimates. For example, Germany experienced negative nominal and real returns despite the World War II stock price controls; and even though the policies it enacted in occupied France succeeded in generating high nominal stock returns, the real return on French stocks during 1940–44 was close to zero. Both instances were followed by sharp drops in stock prices when the controls were lifted.<sup><span id="jumplink-fn23"></span>23</sup></p>                    <h3 scrollto-destination="137577702" id="137577702" data-legacy-id="sec3-3">III.C. Accuracy of Housing Returns</h3>
<p>The biases that affect equity returns—weighting and selection—can also apply to returns on housing. There are also other biases that are specific to housing return estimates. These include costs of running a housing investment and the benchmarking of rent-price ratios to construct the historical rental yield series. We discuss these problematic issues in this section. Our focus is mainly on rental yield data, as the accuracy and robustness of the house price series has been extensively discussed in <span id="jumplink-bib41"></span>Knoll, Schularick, and Steger (2017) in their <span data-supplement-target="sup1"></span><span><a path-from-xml="sup1" href="https://oup.silverchair-cdn.com/oup/backfile/Content_public/Journal/qje/134/3/10.1093_qje_qjz012/1/qjz012_supplemental_appendix.pdf?Expires=1721159455&amp;Signature=TzSlNdhKgqBoNIO0PrCITV0wbOIpt3YVfG~DD8WSXzDEa9ePp1ABHhyt8W1rzGcVgD1H-7H1XSGY~MyPibs7JggiC3p6GSYD2hM37L-Ejkrbbikmgmh1abAdnZycrBer1RKSqhugcR-gF5SuijD9he3smc-~TU7RhdGHrke09JT4TIPduYgM2yaCz~ZSMDSSy-EMA7V~Vo6pAPtGQRNrXz5Y7Pu7aaYh9wRrBnY067yfDTe6gaoYsKN0Yesbq2Aral1blEKnzeF2GfzaX7toBdauzszS0TJSA3d2auLB0oSByw5rz8LukDQk6gVE~g0EH6Vb2L5u85RCH9mp2994Mw__&amp;Key-Pair-Id=APKAIE5G5CRDK6RD3PGA">online appendix</a></span>.</p>                    <h4 scrollto-destination="137577704" id="137577704" data-legacy-id="sec3-3-1">1. Maintenance Costs</h4>
<p>Any homeowner incurs costs for maintenance and repairs, which lower the rental yield and thus the effective return on housing. We deal with this issue by the choice of the benchmark rent-price ratios. Specifically, we anchor to the Investment Property Database (IPD), whose rental yields reflect net income—net of property management costs, ground rent, and other unrecoverable expenditure—as a percentage of the capital employed. The rental yields calculated using the rent-price approach detailed in <span id="jumplink-sec2-4"></span><a href="#sec2-4">Section&nbsp;II.D</a> are therefore net yields. To enable a like-for-like comparison, our historical benchmark yields are calculated net of estimated running costs and depreciation. Running costs are broadly defined as housing-related expenses excluding interest, taxes, and utilities—that is, maintenance costs, management, and insurance fees.</p><p>Applying the rent-price approach to net yield benchmarks assumes that running costs remain stable relative to gross rental income over time within each country. To check this, <span id="jumplink-fig3"></span>Figure&nbsp;III presents historical estimates of running costs and depreciation for Australia, France, the United Kingdom, and the United States, calculated as the sum of the corresponding housing expenditures and fixed capital consumption items in the national accounts. The left panel presents these as a proportion of total housing value and the right panel as a proportion of gross rent. Relative to housing value, costs have been stable over the past 40&nbsp;years, but were somewhat higher in the early to mid-twentieth century. This is to be expected because these costs are largely related to structures, not land, and structures constituted a greater share of housing value in the early twentieth century (<span id="jumplink-bib41"></span>Knoll, Schularick, and Steger 2017). In addition, structures themselves may have been of poorer quality in past times. When taken as a proportion of gross rent, however, as shown in the right panel of <span id="jumplink-fig3"></span>Figure&nbsp;III, housing costs have been relatively stable, or at least not higher historically than they are today. This is likely because gross yields and costs are low today, whereas historically yields and costs were higher, with the two effects more or less canceling out. This suggests that the historical rental yields that we have calculated using the rent-price approach are a good proxy for net yields.</p>                    <div data-id="fig3" data-content-id="fig3" swap-content-for-modal="true"><p><img src="https://oup.silverchair-cdn.com/oup/backfile/Content_public/Journal/qje/134/3/10.1093_qje_qjz012/1/m_qjz012fig3.jpeg?Expires=1721159456&amp;Signature=2OC-W8qbi8jIaFHvjHqrn6QqiXb0zdeKqgy70WavFwQMQlaGszOOqvJar7UuUxoIzS7KFMeLXcn-byteTE5D53qgDTy4lXpThn-lcysh-nxKVply02myNqDvBVP~02C3AUQ3HqGtnjjnpzKM1~dSLQu4T1GtBZk9LDhhHdG2VObq6UMo4Own0toJabhb9jKewzmat4SFg97SmSt3wPglRq~jpTSaO2PZrmlQ-Y4VvVCFKOWiwZc2fdRpV0p0gHRqK1IFGiTvOUFlro30v6mHuAQB75iRy-4nkJZUTP7z8lDaiOIluTnzDwN-OAQDYdYYKS0BlA07cF0g6QWkfPNOKg__&amp;Key-Pair-Id=APKAIE5G5CRDK6RD3PGA" alt="Costs of Running a Housing Investment" data-path-from-xml=""></p><div><p>Figure III</p><div><p>Costs of Running a Housing Investment</p><p>Color version available online.

Rental Yield Benchmarking</h4>
<p>To construct historical rental yield series using the rent-price approach, we start with a benchmark rent-price ratio from the IPD and extend the series back using the historical rent and house price indices (see <span id="jumplink-sec2-4"></span><a href="#sec2-4">Section&nbsp;II.D</a>).<sup><span id="jumplink-fn24"></span>24</sup> This naturally implies that the level of returns is sensitive to the choice of the benchmark ratio. Moreover, past errors in rent and house price indices can potentially accumulate over time and may cause one to substantially over- or understate historical rental yields and housing returns. If the historical capital gains are overstated, the historical rental yields will be overstated, too.</p><p>To try to avert such problems, we corroborate our rental yield estimates using a wide range of alternative historical and current-day sources. The main source of these independent comparisons comes from estimates using the balance sheet approach and national accounts data. As shown in <span id="jumplink-equ12"></span><a href="#equ12">equation&nbsp;(12)</a>, the “balance sheet” rental yield is the ratio of nationwide net rental income to total housing wealth. Net rental income is computed as gross rents paid less depreciation, maintenance, and other housing-related expenses (excluding taxes and interest), with all data taken from the national accounts. The balance sheet approach gives us a rich set of alternative rental yield estimates both for the present day and even going back in time to the beginning of our sample in a number of countries. The second source for historical comparisons comes from advertisements in contemporary newspapers and various other contemporary publications. Third, we also make use of alternative current-day benchmarks based on transaction-level market rent data, and the rental expenditure and house price data from <a href="https://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/" target="_blank">Numbeo.com</a>.<sup><span id="jumplink-fn25"></span>25</sup> For all these measures, we adjust gross yields down to obtain a proxy for net rental yields.</p><p>Historical sources offer point-in-time estimates that avoid the cumulation of errors but can nevertheless be imprecise. The balance sheet approach relies on housing wealth and rental income data, both of which are subject to potential measurement error. For housing wealth, it is inherently difficult to measure the precise value of all dwellings in the economy. Rental income is largely driven by the imputed rents of homeowners, which have to be estimated from market rents by matching the market rent to owner-occupied properties based on various property characteristics. This procedure can suffer from errors in the survey data on property characteristics and market rents, and the matching algorithm.<sup><span id="jumplink-fn26"></span>26</sup> Newspaper advertisements are tied to a specific location and are often biased toward cities. And transaction-level or survey data sometimes only cover the rental sector, rather than both renters and homeowners.</p><p>Given the potential measurement error in all the series, our final rental yield series uses data from both the rent-price approach and the alternative benchmarks listed above. More precisely, we use the following method to construct our final “best-practice” rental yield series. If the rent-price approach estimates are close to alternative measures, we keep the rent-price approach data. This is the case for most historical periods in our sample. If there is a persistent level difference between the rent-price approach and alternative estimates, we adjust the benchmark yield to better match the historical and current data across the range of sources. This is the case for Australia and Belgium. If the levels are close for recent data but diverge historically, we adjust the historical estimates to match the alternative benchmarks. For most countries, such adjustments are small or only apply to a short time span, but for Finland and Spain they are more substantial. <span data-supplement-target="sup1"></span><span><a path-from-xml="sup1" href="https://oup.silverchair-cdn.com/oup/backfile/Content_public/Journal/qje/134/3/10.1093_qje_qjz012/1/qjz012_supplemental_appendix.pdf?Expires=1721159456&amp;Signature=xkGB0UpEE74IGGPQq9OnEsVMktkyYpvUSklfgB6Rm9NZmDt7OgPPDUztXPIGA3yM4U5JT3EMJlwDGTggcH7q2QxylHCKJYVd-q3q0HyhNo8UKMRdfbQB1O-AAVwclcI8CPM7UeS2sNOXY1VO3EYiVyFeOrrGvDQOLyYiQ0Q6Mhbw9J4T3bksCbb0-NdzrowsM7VJiSfTQ1Oby~i9lM9zix2HlzH5Zq3D-E7u66Lo2buQAco8lvzYdDGpB5iMpia39cZi6lS-be~4qdy5R-Sakr--~EdtrSz1MVexzS8AhCvf5vJ5IwRtkWqnD0SKrxdbzYi2WF3TzXXdVU53BSFuow__&amp;Key-Pair-Id=APKAIE5G5CRDK6RD3PGA">Online Appendix</a></span> U details the alternative sources and rental yield construction, including any such adjustments, for each country.</p><p>How large is the room for error in our final housing return series?

Geographic Coverage and Selection Biases</h4>
<p>Our data aim to approximate the return on a representative agent’s housing portfolio. Selection bias means that the selection of properties in our data set does not mirror the balance sheet of the representative agent. The main reason for this bias is selective geographical coverage. Housing returns can vary a lot by location, and our data are based on a sample of housing transactions.</p><p>To make our samples as representative as possible, we strive to attain a broad geographic coverage for both house price and rental data. <span id="jumplink-bib41"></span>Knoll, Schularick, and Steger (2017) discuss the potential location biases in house price data but find that the house price trends in their, and hence our, data set should be representative of country-level trends. When it comes to rents, the benchmark IPD yields are based on portfolios of institutional investors, which are slightly biased toward cities. This would lead to lower yields than the national average. On the other hand, investors may select higher-yielding properties within any given city. Comparisons with aggregate balance sheet approach data and alternative estimates indicate that, on average, IPD yields tend to be representative at country level. Furthermore, IPD yields are capitalization weighted, which again better captures the yield on a representative portfolio. Finally, we aim for national coverage with the historical rental indices used for extrapolation and historical balance sheet benchmarks.</p><p>Despite this, our house price and rental data are likely somewhat biased toward cities and urban areas, especially for historical periods—simply because urban housing data are more widely available and researched. Even though this would affect the level of capital gain and yield, it should have little influence on total returns, since cities tend to have higher capital gains but lower rental yields.<sup><span id="jumplink-fn33"></span>33</sup> In addition, <span id="jumplink-bib41"></span>Knoll, Schularick, and Steger (2017) show that the rural-urban divide has a relatively small impact on capital gains. Relatedly, we can establish some bounds on how much our rental yields can vary with the choice of location. In 2013, <a href="https://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/" target="_blank">Numbeo.com</a> data suggest that price-rent ratios in and out of city centers differ by less than three times annual rent. The rental yield is the inverse of these price-rent ratios. This motivates us to construct a lower-bound rent-price ratio as <span>|$RP_{low}=\frac{1}{\frac{1}{RP_{actual}}+3}$|</span> and an upper-bound rent-price ratio as <span>|$RP_{high}=\frac{1}{\frac{1}{RP_{actual}}-3}$|</span> for each country in 2013 to estimate upper and lower bounds of our housing returns depending on the choice of location. Given the currently high price-rent ratios, these adjustments have a relatively small impact on our data. <span id="jumplink-fig5"></span>Figure&nbsp;V shows that increasing or reducing the price-rent ratio by three changes annual return estimates by about ±1 percentage point a year relative to our preferred baseline.</p>                    <div data-id="fig5" data-content-id="fig5" swap-content-for-modal="true"><p><img src="https://oup.silverchair-cdn.com/oup/backfile/Content_public/Journal/qje/134/3/10.1093_qje_qjz012/1/m_qjz012fig5.jpeg?Expires=1721159456&amp;Signature=USEZiaKFFSidl0pCycPu~x7vhK2fR7XR-xWB8CGe49tbTLKnjxfINdHBo5uMRb6jNFliFmB2-Nkflp1q-UVcerXsIOLaNPLP1XJppzRJydYsv9GuWMJqGrtW2pW5~woS1ZpC7FaR~hBf6IrWUMDI6Gx8somgovgkLwBot31xWAfSyCerL9~045wLoU2H3l~Er~5ziDo5xfHUEZXKaNvSGdK4Pmks9aPus4eHlhfhH3xx0G3lL0g011iEGINPIMNlZ1SqKuvnzhiDxn78qxKlhODEJvHjEiA-5inViYYiduJ2baPu7i9R7TtOV4n9JexRUoWCfqYYv8yaG4HxlA6sUQ__&amp;Key-Pair-Id=APKAIE5G5CRDK6RD3PGA" alt="Sensitivity of Housing Returns to a Rent-Price Location Correction" data-path-from-xml=""></p><div><p>Figure V</p><div><p>Sensitivity of Housing Returns to a Rent-Price Location Correction</p><p>Bars show the arithmetic- and geometric-average housing returns for selected subperiods.

The standard deviation of ZIP code–level housing returns is roughly one-third higher than that in the national data. If investors owned one undiversified house whose price tracks the neighborhood index, the risk and return characteristics of this portfolio would be somewhat closer to those of the aggregate equity index, although the gap would still be large.</p><p>Of course, it is much more difficult to invest in a diversified housing portfolio than a well diversified equity portfolio. That being said, <span id="jumplink-bib7"></span>Benhabib and Bisin (2016) show that most equity is also held in an undiversified manner. The data regarding returns on individual housing and private equity returns are, however, very sparse at this point in time. To understand exactly how these risk-return characteristics play out at a disaggregated level, a more detailed study of individual portfolios and returns is necessary. This would be a worthy goal of future research.</p><p>Another selection bias comes about from the fact that rent data largely come from the rental market, whereas the majority of housing stock is held by owner-occupiers. To guard against this, we rely on rental indices that, whenever possible, account for the growth of imputed rents. We also benchmark our series to the balance sheet yield data constructed to cover the total housing stock. Still, imputed rents are measured with error and may not reflect the cost that the homeowner would pay on the rental market. If owning is relatively cheaper than renting—for example, due to tax exemptions or long-run house price appreciation—homeowners would purchase larger or better houses than they would rent, and imputed rents would overstate the value of housing services accruing to homeowners. On the other hand, buying a house is subject to credit constraints, which means that renters can afford better houses than homeowners, all else equal. In this case, imputed rents would understate the flow value of housing services. Overall, the direction of any potential bias is unclear and leaves much scope for future work.</p><p>Finally, the portfolio selection in the price and rent series is subject to survivorship bias. In general, our price and rental yield estimates aim to capture transaction or appraisal values, and rental costs on a broad and impartially selected portfolio of properties. Some survivorship bias may enter the series for the following reasons. First, indices that rely on an ex post selection of cities may inadvertently choose the more “successful” cities over the less successful ones. Second, houses that decline in value are likely to lose liquidity and be sold less frequently, hence carrying a lower weight in the index. Third, chain-linking historical house price and rent indices to compute annual returns will generally ignore the impact of large destructions of the housing stock, particularly those occurring during wartime.</p><p>Several factors suggest that the impact of survivorship bias on housing returns should be limited. First, <span id="jumplink-fig5"></span>Figure&nbsp;V and <span id="jumplink-bib41"></span>Knoll, Schularick, and Steger (2017) show that any location-specific bias in our estimates is likely to be small. Second, if the magnitude of survivorship bias is similar to that in equity markets (<span id="jumplink-sec3-2"></span><a href="#sec3-2">Section&nbsp;III.B</a>), the bias is also unlikely to be large. Third, the low liquidity and weight of houses with declining prices is in some ways similar to the documented negative returns on delisted equities (<span id="jumplink-bib67"></span>Shumway 1997; <span id="jumplink-bib68"></span>Shumway and Warther 1999) which, generally, cannot be incorporated into the stock return series due to the lack of data. Therefore this bias should be less of a concern when comparing housing and equity returns. Finally, similarly to the stock market closures discussed in <span id="jumplink-sec3-2"></span><a href="#sec3-2">Section&nbsp;III.B</a>, even though capital stock destruction during wars can have a substantial impact on returns in specific years, it is unlikely to profoundly affect cross-country long-run returns due to the rarity of such events.<sup><span id="jumplink-fn35"></span>35</sup> As <span id="jumplink-fig9"></span>Figure&nbsp;IX shows later, the main facts in the data are similar for countries that experienced major war destruction on their own territory versus countries that did not (e.g., Australia, Canada, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United States). <span data-supplement-target="sup1"></span><span><a path-from-xml="sup1" href="https://oup.silverchair-cdn.com/oup/backfile/Content_public/Journal/qje/134/3/10.1093_qje_qjz012/1/qjz012_supplemental_appendix.pdf?Expires=1721159456&amp;Signature=xkGB0UpEE74IGGPQq9OnEsVMktkyYpvUSklfgB6Rm9NZmDt7OgPPDUztXPIGA3yM4U5JT3EMJlwDGTggcH7q2QxylHCKJYVd-q3q0HyhNo8UKMRdfbQB1O-AAVwclcI8CPM7UeS2sNOXY1VO3EYiVyFeOrrGvDQOLyYiQ0Q6Mhbw9J4T3bksCbb0-NdzrowsM7VJiSfTQ1Oby~i9lM9zix2HlzH5Zq3D-E7u66Lo2buQAco8lvzYdDGpB5iMpia39cZi6lS-be~4qdy5R-Sakr--~EdtrSz1MVexzS8AhCvf5vJ5IwRtkWqnD0SKrxdbzYi2WF3TzXXdVU53BSFuow__&amp;Key-Pair-Id=APKAIE5G5CRDK6RD3PGA">Online Appendix</a></span> Table&nbsp;A.5 shows that housing offers a similar return relative to equity on average even after wars are excluded.</p>                    <h4 scrollto-destination="137577750" id="137577750" data-legacy-id="sec3-3-4">4. Returns on Real Estate Investment Trusts</h4>
<p>Another way to check our housing returns is to compare them to the historical returns on housing investment trusts. These trusts offer independent estimates of returns. Real estate investment trusts (REITs), are investment funds that specialize in the purchase and management of residential and commercial real estate. Many of these funds list their shares on the local stock exchange. The return on these shares should closely track total real estate returns. Differences will arise because the REIT portfolio is more geographically concentrated, its assets often contain nonresidential property, and share price fluctuations may reflect expectations of future earnings and sentiment, as well as underlying portfolio returns. Furthermore, the REIT portfolio returns should be net of taxes and transaction costs as well as housing running costs, and may thus be somewhat lower than our housing series. Still, returns on the REIT portfolio should be comparable to housing and can be used to check the general plausibility of our return series.</p><p><span id="jumplink-fig6"></span>Figure&nbsp;VI compares our historical housing returns (dashed line) with those on investments in REITs (solid line) in France and the United States, two countries for which longer-run REIT return data are available. The REIT returns series for France refers to shares of the fund La Fourmi Immobilière (see <span id="jumplink-bib69"></span>Simonnet, Gallais-Hamonno, and Arbulu 1998). The fund acquired a portfolio of 15 properties in Paris between 1900 and 1913, worth around €36 million at 2015 prices, and its shares were listed on the Paris stock exchange between 1904 and 1997. We exclude the period after 1985, when La Fourmi Immobilière was taken over by AGF. For the United States, we use the FTSE NAREIT residential total return index after 1994, and the general FTSE equity NAREIT before. REIT returns have to be unlevered to capture the returns on the REIT housing portfolio. La Fourmi Immobilière had an unlevered balance sheet structure, hence we do not adjust their returns. We assume a REIT leverage of 45% for the United States following <span id="jumplink-bib25"></span>Giacomini, Ling, and Naranjo (2015). Returns for France are presented as decadal moving averages, and for the United States as five-year moving averages, given the shorter span of the U.S. data.</p>                    <div data-id="fig6" data-content-id="fig6" swap-content-for-modal="true"><p><img src="https://oup.silverchair-cdn.com/oup/backfile/Content_public/Journal/qje/134/3/10.1093_qje_qjz012/1/m_qjz012fig6.jpeg?Expires=1721159456&amp;Signature=Nf7QbckYLxsaiSVaf~PHHArYoIPwEPoEb4dbMPkDt0kRwfLuI-4FSEBX-FEZRT30WnJjI1ARj6VbO2a4jsR743lDFL49p1EIuGO6-yD2NX8rDwLMD9GkdaPu2ZppISohC~p52iUxdaHwdwEXPPjyxGsmpqaV6RxAVge0Ep1JKkzsPB07ijTyH-Aig8zfSzJ2Wv6g2UAEpQBYAcfPz1jWmePHRA3DfUGe461bANlBDhsYRxG9G2vKeC~fvdrQVERWImTLyfg-riNrIwCTCDvbAL9YlWUkFWKNdrVNF2E8TyTJgTVwT~YDiT0adxDLaox~o1yzbQpv15y8wfTGmRrRfA__&amp;Key-Pair-Id=APKAIE5G5CRDK6RD3PGA" alt="Returns on Housing Compared to Real Estate Investment Funds" data-path-from-xml=""></p><div><p>Figure VI</p><div><p>Returns on Housing Compared to Real Estate Investment Funds</p><p>Total real return on housing, and shares of housing investment firms in France and the U.S. Moving averages.

The time trend also follows a similar pattern, especially in France. The REIT returns, however, tend to be somewhat more volatile—most likely because they reflect changes in the market’s valuations of future earnings and the current portfolio performance. The REIT returns also seem to be affected by the general ups and downs of the stock market: for example, the 1987 Black Monday crash and dot-com bust in the United States, as well as the 1930s Great Depression and 1960s stock crises in France. This suggests that the valuations of the funds’ housing portfolios may have been affected by shifts in general stock market sentiment, possibly unrelated to housing market fundamentals.</p><p>Overall, the returns on real estate investment funds serve to confirm the general housing return level in our data set. The comparison also suggests that returns in housing markets tend to be smoother than those in stock markets. The next section examines various factors that can affect the comparability of housing and equity returns more generally.</p>                    <h3 scrollto-destination="137577761" id="137577761" data-legacy-id="sec3-4">III.D. Comparability of Housing and Equity Returns</h3>
<p>Even if the fundamentals driving housing and equity returns (expected dividend/profit, and rental flows) are similar, investor returns for the two asset classes may differ for a number of reasons including taxes, transaction costs, and the financial structure of the investment claim. In this subsection we consider such comparability issues.</p>                    <h4 scrollto-destination="137577763" id="137577763" data-legacy-id="sec3-4-1">1. Transaction Costs</h4>
<p>The conventional wisdom is that while bonds and equities can be purchased with low transaction costs and at short notice, the seller of a house typically incurs significant costs. We provide a rough estimate of how transaction costs affect our return estimates for housing. We perform a simple back-of-the-envelope calculation to do this using contemporary data on average holding periods of residential real estate and average transaction costs incurred by the buyer. According to the <span id="jumplink-bib54"></span>OECD (2012), average round-trip transaction costs across 13 of the 16 countries in our sample amount to about 7.7% of the property’s value.<sup><span id="jumplink-fn36"></span>36</sup></p><p>However, these simple cost ratios need to be adjusted for the typical trading frequency of each asset. According to the American Community Survey of 2007, more than 50% of U.S. homeowners had lived in their current home for more than 10&nbsp;years. Current average holding periods are similar in, for example, the United Kingdom, Australia, and the Netherlands. Another way to estimate housing turnover is using housing sales data, which for the United States gives us an average holding period of close to 20&nbsp;years.<sup><span id="jumplink-fn37"></span>37</sup> Either way, accounting for transaction costs would thus lower the average annual return to housing by less than 100 basis points (e.g., 77 basis points a year based on a 7.7% cost incurred every 10&nbsp;years).</p><p>For equities, the cost of each individual transaction is much smaller, but the number of transactions is much higher. <span id="jumplink-bib34"></span>Jones (2002) estimates that at the New York Stock Exchange over the period 1900–2001, the average transaction cost was around 80 bps (half bid-ask spread of 30 bps plus commission rate of 50&nbsp;bps), and turnover was roughly 60% a year, resulting in the annual average equity transaction costs of 40 bps. Comparing this number to the back-of-the-envelope housing transaction cost estimates reported above, it seems that even though equity transaction costs are probably somewhat lower, the difference between two asset classes is likely to be small—and no more than 0.5 percentage points a year.</p><p>The fact that housing faces much higher costs per each transaction, however, means that the realized housing transaction costs may understate the “shadow” utility cost, which would include the suboptimal allocation choices from staying in the same house and not moving, for example. It might also reduce the volatility of housing returns, making them react more sluggishly to shocks. This means that the relatively modest short-run volatility of housing returns could mask more pronounced fluctuations at lower frequencies. <span data-supplement-target="sup1"></span><span><a path-from-xml="sup1" href="https://oup.silverchair-cdn.com/oup/backfile/Content_public/Journal/qje/134/3/10.1093_qje_qjz012/1/qjz012_supplemental_appendix.pdf?Expires=1721159456&amp;Signature=xkGB0UpEE74IGGPQq9OnEsVMktkyYpvUSklfgB6Rm9NZmDt7OgPPDUztXPIGA3yM4U5JT3EMJlwDGTggcH7q2QxylHCKJYVd-q3q0HyhNo8UKMRdfbQB1O-AAVwclcI8CPM7UeS2sNOXY1VO3EYiVyFeOrrGvDQOLyYiQ0Q6Mhbw9J4T3bksCbb0-NdzrowsM7VJiSfTQ1Oby~i9lM9zix2HlzH5Zq3D-E7u66Lo2buQAco8lvzYdDGpB5iMpia39cZi6lS-be~4qdy5R-Sakr--~EdtrSz1MVexzS8AhCvf5vJ5IwRtkWqnD0SKrxdbzYi2WF3TzXXdVU53BSFuow__&amp;Key-Pair-Id=APKAIE5G5CRDK6RD3PGA">Online Appendix</a></span> K and Table&nbsp;A.17 compare equity and housing return volatility over longer horizons of up to 20&nbsp;years. It turns out that the standard deviation of housing returns is always around one-half that of equity returns, regardless of the time horizon, which suggests that housing returns not only have lower short-run volatility but also less pronounced swings at all longer horizons.</p>                    <h4 scrollto-destination="137577768" id="137577768" data-legacy-id="sec3-4-2">2. Leverage</h4>
<p>Household-level returns on real estate and equity will be affected by the structure of the household balance sheet, and how these investments are financed. <span id="jumplink-bib37"></span>Jordà, Schularick, and Taylor (2016) show that advanced economies in the second half of the twentieth century experienced a boom in mortgage lending and borrowing. This surge in household borrowing not only reflected rising house prices, it also reflected substantially higher household debt levels relative to asset values (and relative to household incomes). The majority of households in advanced economies today hold a leveraged portfolio in their local real estate market. As with any leveraged portfolio, this significantly increases both the risk and the return associated with the investment. And today, unlike in the early twentieth century, houses can be levered much more than equities. The benchmark rent-price ratios from the IPD used to construct estimates of the return to housing refer to rent-price ratios of unleveraged real estate. Consequently, the estimates presented so far constitute only unlevered housing returns of a hypothetical long-only investor, which is symmetric to the way we (and the literature) have treated equities.</p><p>However, computing raw returns to housing and equity indices neglects the fact that an equity investment contains embedded leverage. The underlying corporations have balance sheets with both debt and equity liabilities. Thus, reconciliation is needed, and two routes can be taken. For truly comparable raw unlevered returns, equity returns could be delevered. Alternatively, for truly comparable levered returns, housing returns would have to be levered up to factor in the actual leverage (using mortgages) seen on household balance sheets. Is this a big deal in practice? We argue that it does not bias our conclusions significantly based on some elementary calculations.</p><p>Consider, for example, the second reconciliation of levering up housing returns. Let the real long-term mortgage borrowing rate be <em>r</em><sub>0</sub>, and let α be the leverage of the average house proxied by total mortgages divided by the value of the housing stock. Then we can solve for levered real housing returns <em>TR</em>′ as a function of unlevered real housing returns <em>TR</em> using the formula <span>|$\mathit{TR^{\prime }} = \frac{\mathit {TR} - \alpha r_0}{1 - \alpha }$|⁠</span>. In our data, <em>TR</em> ≃ 7.0% and α ≃ 0.2. Using a long bond return as a proxy for <em>r</em><sub>0</sub> of around 2.5% p.a., this would imply <em>TR</em>′ = 8.1%.<sup><span id="jumplink-fn38"></span>38</sup> In other words, for the representative agent the levered housing return is about 110 bps higher than the unlevered housing return (8.1% versus 7%), a small difference. Such adjustments appear to be inconsequential for the main conclusions we present here. In fact, they would bolster one of our central new claims, which is that real housing returns at least match or even exceed real equity returns in the long run when the two are compared on an equal footing.</p>                    <h4 scrollto-destination="137577772" id="137577772" data-legacy-id="sec3-4-3">3. Taxes</h4>
<p>When computing equity and housing returns we do not account for taxes. From an investor’s perspective, accounting for taxes is clearly important. Typically, equity capital gains—and, for some countries and periods, even dividend income—have been subject to a capital gains tax. When dividends are not taxed as capital gains, they tend to be taxed as income. In some countries, housing capital gains are subject to capital gains taxes, but owner-occupied houses in particular have been granted exemptions in many cases. Imputed rents of homeowners, unlike dividend income, are almost never taxed.

Temporal Aggregation and Return Averaging</h4>
<p>The way house and equity price indices are constructed is likely to influence the volatility of the return series. The house price indices used for return calculations (e.g., indices from national statistical agencies) tend to be an average of all transactions in a given year or use a sample of transactions or appraisal values throughout the year. But the equity prices used for return calculations, by the usual convention followed here, compare end-of-year prices of shares. The use of end-of-year rather than yearly average prices mechanically makes equity returns more volatile.</p><p>We can assess the magnitude of this effect by constructing an equity return index based on annual averages of daily data, to mimic how housing returns are computed, and then comparing it to a “normal” return using end-of-year index values. For this robustness exercise we use daily MSCI equity returns data for 1970–2015. <span id="jumplink-tblVI"></span>Table&nbsp;VI presents the end-of-year and yearly average real equity returns in the first two columns, and our yearly average housing returns for the same time period in the third column. Comparing the first two columns shows that yearly averaging lowers the standard deviation of returns by around one-fifth, or 5 percentage points. It also lowers the average return by around 1 percentage point, because the return series is a transformation of the raw price data, and lowering the variance reduces the mean of the return. But the standard deviation of the smoothed yearly average equity series is still almost three times that of housing over the same time period.</p>                    <div content-id="tblVI"><div id="tblVI" data-id="tblVI"><p><span id="label-89983">Table VI</span></p><p>Impact of Using End-of-Year versus Yearly Average Asset Prices</p> </div><div><table role="table" aria-labelledby="

Risky returns recovered quickly in the 1920s, before experiencing a drop in the the Great Depression, especially for equities. Strikingly, after World War II the trajectories of returns for the two risky asset classes had similar long-run means but over shorter periods diverged markedly from each other.</p><p>Equity returns have experienced many pronounced global boom-bust cycles, much more so than housing returns, with average real returns as high as +16% and as low as –4% over entire decades. Equity returns fell in World War II, boomed in the postwar reconstruction, and fell off again in the climate of general macroeconomic instability in the 1970s. Equity returns bounced back following a wave of deregulation and privatization in the 1980s. The next major event was the global financial crisis, which exacted its toll on equities and to some extent housing, as we shall see.</p><p>Housing returns, on the other hand, have remained remarkably stable over almost the entire post-World War II period. As a consequence, the correlation between equity and housing returns, depicted in the top left panel of <span id="jumplink-fig8"></span>Figure&nbsp;VIII, was highly positive before World War II, but has all but disappeared over the past five decades. The low covariance of equity and housing returns over the long run reveals potential attractive gains from diversification across these two asset classes that economists, up to now, have been unable to measure or analyze.</p><p>In terms of relative returns, we see that housing persistently outperformed equity up until World War I, even though both of these asset returns followed a broadly similar temporal pattern. In recent decades, equities have slightly outperformed housing in (arithmetic, not geometric) average but with much higher volatility and cyclicality. Furthermore, upswings in equity prices have generally not coincided with times of low growth or high inflation, when standard asset pricing theory would say high returns would have been particularly valuable.</p><p>The top right panel of <span id="jumplink-fig8"></span>Figure&nbsp;VIII examines the correlation between risky rates of return and inflation. It shows that equity comoved negatively with inflation in the 1970s, while housing provided a more robust hedge against an unusually rapid surge in consumer prices. In fact, apart from the interwar period, when the world was gripped by a broad deflationary bias, we find that equity returns have comoved negatively with inflation in almost all eras. Moreover, the big downswings in equity returns in the two world wars and the 1970s coincided with periods of generally poor economic performance.</p><p>In the past two decades, equity returns have also become highly correlated across countries, as shown by the sharp rise in the degree of cross-country comovement in the bottom left panel of <span id="jumplink-fig8"></span>Figure&nbsp;VIII, measured as the average of all country-pair correlations for a given window.<sup><span id="jumplink-fn40"></span>40</sup>A well-diversified global equity portfolio has thus become less of a hedge against country-specific risk (<span id="jumplink-bib59"></span>Quinn and Voth 2008). As is a matter of debate, this may reflect greater freedom to arbitrage and trade across equity markets globally or an increase in the global shocks to which firms, especially those in the typical equity index, are increasingly exposed. In contrast to equities, cross-country housing returns have remained relatively uncorrelated, perhaps because housing assets remain less globally tradable than equities or because they are more exposed to idiosyncratic country-level shocks.</p>                    <h3 scrollto-destination="137577793" id="137577793" data-legacy-id="sec4-2">IV.B. Country Returns</h3>
<p>Next we explore risky returns in individual countries. <span id="jumplink-tblVII"></span>Table&nbsp;VII shows returns on equities and housing by country for the full sample and for the post-1950 and post-1980 subsamples. Long-run risky asset returns for most countries are close to 6%–8% a year, a figure we think represents a robust and strong real return to risky capital. Still, the figures also show an important degree of heterogeneity among countries. Many of the countries that experienced large political shocks show lower equity returns. This is the case for Portugal and Spain, which both underwent prolonged civil strife, and France, which undertook a wave of nationalizations in the aftermath of World War II. French equity returns are also negatively affected by the fallout from the world wars and the fallout from an oil crisis in the 1960s (for more detail, see <span id="jumplink-bib47"></span>Le Bris and Hautcoeur 2010; <span id="jumplink-bib8"></span>Blancheton, Bonin, and Le Bris 2014). In contrast, real equity returns in Finland have been as high as 10% on average throughout the sample. Housing returns also show considerable heterogeneity. Returns on housing have been high on average in the Nordic countries, but low in Italy and Spain. U.S. risky asset returns fall roughly in the middle of the country-specific figures, with equity returns slightly above average and housing returns slightly below.

Housing has offered a similar return to equity in the majority of countries and time periods. In the long run, housing outperformed equities in absolute terms in six countries, and equities outperformed housing in five. Returns on the two assets were about the same in the remaining five countries. After World War II, housing was the best-performing asset class in three countries, and equities were the best-performing in nine.</p><p>However, although aggregate total returns on equities exceed those on housing for certain countries and time periods, equities do not outperform housing in simple risk-adjusted terms. <span id="jumplink-fig9"></span>Figure&nbsp;IX compares the risk and returns of housing and equities for each country.

Decomposition of Returns</h3>
<p>To further look into the underlying drivers of housing and equity returns, we decompose them into the capital gain (price) and yield (dividend or rent) components. To be consistent with the data in <span id="jumplink-sec3"></span><a href="#sec3">Section&nbsp;III</a> and <span id="jumplink-tblII"></span>Table&nbsp;II, we decompose real total return into real capital gain—that is, the price change net of inflation—and dividend or rental yield—that is, the nominal yield as proportion of the previous year’s share or house price.<sup><span id="jumplink-fn43"></span>43</sup> Yet caveats arise. In principle, it is not entirely clear whether inflation should be subtracted from the capital gain or yield component. Moreover, firms may buy back shares to generate low-tax capital gains instead of paying out higher-taxed dividends; thus, the manner of distribution of total returns may not be invariant to circumstances.</p><p><span id="jumplink-tblVIII"></span>Table&nbsp;VIII decomposes equity and housing returns into capital gains and dividends or rents, for the full cross-country sample and the period after 1950. Over the full sample, most of the real return is attributable to the yield. Dividends account for roughly 60% of real equity returns, and rents for roughly 80% of real housing returns. In terms of geometric means (<span id="jumplink-tblVIII"></span>Table&nbsp;VIII, third row), almost all of both equity and housing returns are attributable to, respectively, dividend and rental income. After 1950, capital gains become more important for both equities and housing. For equities, real capital gains account for the majority of the total return after 1950, and for housing for roughly one-third.</p>                    <div content-id="tblVIII"><div id="tblVIII" data-id="tblVIII"><p><span id="label-25864">Table VIII</span></p><p>Total Return Components for Equity and Housing</p> </div><div><table role="table" aria-labelledby="

Nevertheless, without dividends or rents, the real returns on both assets would be low, especially in geometric mean terms. This is consistent with the existing literature on real house prices: <span id="jumplink-bib65"></span>Shiller (2000) documents that house prices in the United States moved in line with inflation before the 2000s bubble, and <span id="jumplink-bib41"></span>Knoll, Schularick, and Steger (2017) show that real house prices in advanced economies were more or less flat before 1950. This is also true in our data: the pre-1950 annual real housing capital gains are just 0.5%. Post-1950 capital gains are somewhat higher at 2.5%, but still only half the magnitude of the rental yields. Adding rents to the equation radically changes the picture and brings the long-run housing total return close to 7%. Interestingly, the broad picture is similar for equities: the real equity capital gain before 1950 is, on average, just 0.4%, compared with 4.7% a year after 1950. However, the contribution of dividend and rental income means that housing and equity returns were high both before and after 1950.</p><p>Although most of the return can be attributed to dividends and rents, almost all of the volatility comes from equity and house prices, that is, the capital gains component. <span id="jumplink-tblVIII"></span>Table&nbsp;VIII, second row shows that both dividends and rents are very stable, with a standard deviation of dividend/rental yields of about 2%. Prices, on the contrary, move around much more, with a standard deviation roughly equal to that of total returns (21.4% for equities and 9.9% for housing). The higher variability of equity returns and the superior risk-adjusted performance of housing can therefore largely be attributed to the lower volatility of house prices compared to those of equities. An additional factor is that capital gains—the more volatile component—account for a relatively larger share of equity returns.</p><p>Because aggregate equity prices are subject to large and prolonged swings, a representative investor would have to hold on to his equity portfolio for longer to ensure a high real return. Aggregate housing returns, on the other hand, are more stable because swings in aggregate house prices are generally less pronounced. National aggregate housing portfolios have had comparable real returns to national aggregate equity portfolios, but with only half the volatility.</p><p><span id="jumplink-tblIX"></span>Table&nbsp;IX examines the relative importance of capital gains versus dividends/rents at the country level (figures are arithmetic means and standard deviations). Additionally we report the share of real total return accounted for by capital gains. The fact that the majority of housing returns come from yields is true across all countries. The lowest real capital gains are observed in Switzerland, and the highest in Finland, but none exceed 3% a year in the full sample. Rents are relatively more important in the United States, accounting for roughly 90% of returns, but this is not unusual: Denmark, Sweden, and Switzerland have the same share of capital gains as the United States. For equities, the picture is more mixed. Seven countries, including the United States, have a roughly 50/50 split between real capital gain and dividend yield shares. Other countries record low or negative real capital gains over the full sample, especially in geometric mean terms (see <span data-supplement-target="sup1"></span><span><a path-from-xml="sup1" href="https://oup.silverchair-cdn.com/oup/backfile/Content_public/Journal/qje/134/3/10.1093_qje_qjz012/1/qjz012_supplemental_appendix.pdf?Expires=1721159456&amp;Signature=xkGB0UpEE74IGGPQq9OnEsVMktkyYpvUSklfgB6Rm9NZmDt7OgPPDUztXPIGA3yM4U5JT3EMJlwDGTggcH7q2QxylHCKJYVd-q3q0HyhNo8UKMRdfbQB1O-AAVwclcI8CPM7UeS2sNOXY1VO3EYiVyFeOrrGvDQOLyYiQ0Q6Mhbw9J4T3bksCbb0-NdzrowsM7VJiSfTQ1Oby~i9lM9zix2HlzH5Zq3D-E7u66Lo2buQAco8lvzYdDGpB5iMpia39cZi6lS-be~4qdy5R-Sakr--~EdtrSz1MVexzS8AhCvf5vJ5IwRtkWqnD0SKrxdbzYi2WF3TzXXdVU53BSFuow__&amp;Key-Pair-Id=APKAIE5G5CRDK6RD3PGA">Online Appendix</a></span> Table&nbsp;A.22).</p>                    <div content-id="tblIX"><div id="tblIX" data-id="tblIX"><p><span id="label-61744">Table IX</span></p><p>Total Return Components for Equity and Housing by Country</p> </div><div><table role="table" aria-labelledby="

Decadal moving averages.</p></div></div></div><p>Three striking features of <span id="jumplink-fig10"></span>Figure&nbsp;X deserve comment. First, low real rates and, in fact, negative real rates have been relatively common in modern financial history. Second, for the most part, returns to long-term and short-term safe assets have tracked each other very closely—with a premium of about 1% that has widened considerably since the well-documented decline of the mid-1980s (see, e.g., <span id="jumplink-bib31"></span>Holston, Laubach, and Williams 2017). Third, a major stylized fact leaps out once we compare the safe rates of return in <span id="jumplink-fig10"></span>Figure&nbsp;X to the risky rates of return in <span id="jumplink-fig7"></span>Figure&nbsp;VII. Prior to World War II, real returns on housing, safe assets, and equities followed remarkably similar trajectories. After World War II this was no longer the case.</p><p>Safe rates are far from stable in the medium term. There is enormous time-series, as well as cross-country, variability. In fact, real safe rates appear to be as volatile as real risky rates (sometimes more volatile), a topic we return to in the next section. Considerable variation in the risk premium often comes from sharp changes in safe real returns, not from real returns on risky assets.</p><p>Two four-decade-long declines in real rates stand out: (i) from 1870 to World War I (with a subsequent further collapse during the war), and (ii) the well-documented decline that started in the mid-1980s. We could add to this list the briefer, but more dramatic decline that followed the Great Depression into World War II. Some observers have therefore interpreted the recent downward trend in safe rates as a sign of a new era of “secular stagnation” (see, e.g., <span id="jumplink-bib70"></span>Summers 2014).</p><p>However, in contrast to 1870–1913 and the 1930s, the more recent decline is characterized by a much higher term premium—a feature with few precedents in our sample.<sup><span id="jumplink-fn44"></span>44</sup> There are other periods in which real rates remained low, such as in the 1960s. They were pushed below zero, particularly for the longer-tenor bonds, during the 1970s inflation spike, although here too term premiums remained relatively tight. Returns also dipped dramatically during both world wars. This is perhaps to be expected: demand for safe assets spikes during disasters, although the dip may also reflect periods of financial repression and high inflation that usually emerge during times of conflict and often persist into peacetime. Thus, from a broad historical perspective, high rates of return on safe assets and high term premiums are more the exception than the rule.</p><p>Summing up, over more than 140&nbsp;years from the late nineteenth to the twenty-first century, real returns on safe assets have been low—on average 1% for bills and 2.5% for bonds—relative to alternative investments. Although the return volatility—measured as annual standard deviation—is lower than that of housing and equities, these assets offered little protection during high-inflation eras and during the two world wars, both periods of low consumption growth.</p><p>Again moving on to examine correlations, <span id="jumplink-fig11"></span>Figure&nbsp;XI explores additional key moments of the data. The top left panel plots the correlation between real bond and real bill returns, again using decadal rolling windows and computed as the cross-sectional average of correlations. In parallel to our discussion of the term premium, real returns on bonds and bills have been highly correlated for most of the sample up until the 1960s. From the 1970s onward, the era of fiat money and higher average inflation, this correlation has become much weaker, and near zero at times, coinciding with a widening term premium.</p>                    <div data-id="fig11" data-content-id="fig11" swap-content-for-modal="true"><p><img src="https://oup.silverchair-cdn.com/oup/backfile/Content_public/Journal/qje/134/3/10.1093_qje_qjz012/1/m_qjz012fig11.jpeg?Expires=1721159456&amp;Signature=J4GBeJikKLS2l2n8P23AZJQLMv39elva2D~BQH97tmVSvCwv7cAHRUn2jsRIdDFkyj-a1gpSh518bcdqzCqQrQ67MiDpgGhfGiAAKGDEszLDeZD4CamLBC3xoLVlVtwL9~Z9c~coArWoAZ6ILtQDsOKrFolAlnmGxVqzFL85BfsogJPkWvB-YzZmvO-ygjvDy5fqDR48fIoaMHu7MJ~ezHVGgDrTH57fHRutLRgfHWk7QgraD1kPaA03eeajXam2tLo872GXuF5Igy77Z5c5pjXfcCv7kIiA7ChDgeKTTO90WEhgRnY7~Wv9AQH6WleRWQHR6yixRzgPQalwc9UkLw__&amp;Key-Pair-Id=APKAIE5G5CRDK6RD3PGA" alt="Correlations across Safe Asset Returns" data-path-from-xml=""></p><div><p>Figure XI</p><div><p>Correlations across Safe Asset Returns</p><p>Color version available online. Rolling decadal correlations. The global correlation coefficient is the average of individual countries for the rolling window. The cross-country correlation coefficient is the average of all country pairs for a given asset class. Country coverage differs across time periods.</p></div></div></div><p>The top right panel of <span id="jumplink-fig11"></span>Figure&nbsp;XI displays the correlation between nominal safe asset returns and inflation for real bond and real bill returns. The figure shows that safe assets provided more of an inflation hedge starting in the 1970s, around the start of the era of modern central banking. However, as <span id="jumplink-fig10"></span>Figure&nbsp;X showed, bonds and bills have experienced prolonged periods of negative real returns—both during wartime inflations and in the high-inflation period of the late 1970s. Although safe asset rates usually comove positively with inflation, they do not always compensate the investor fully.</p><p>The bottom panel of <span id="jumplink-fig11"></span>Figure&nbsp;XI displays the cross-correlation of safe returns over rolling decadal windows, averaged for all country-pair combinations, to examine how much risk can be diversified with debt instruments. Cross-country real safe returns have exhibited positive comovement throughout history. The degree of comovement shows a few marked increases in World War I and in the 1930s. The effect of these major global shocks on individual countries seems to have resulted in a higher correlation of cross-country asset returns.</p><p>Turning to cross-sectional features, <span id="jumplink-tblX"></span>Table&nbsp;X shows country-specific safe asset returns for three samples: all years, post-1950, and post-1980. Here the experiences of a few countries stand out. In France, real bill returns have been negative when averaged over the full sample. In Portugal and Spain, they have been approximately zero. In Norway, the average return on bills has been negative for the post-1950 sample.

What matters for this is not the level of real return per se, but its comparison to real GDP growth, or <em>r</em><sup><em>safe</em></sup> − <em>g</em>. If the rate of return exceeds real GDP growth, <em>r</em><sup><em>safe</em></sup> &gt; <em>g</em>, reducing the debt/GDP ratio requires continuous budget surpluses. When <em>r</em><sup><em>safe</em></sup> is less than <em>g</em>, however, a reduction in debt/GDP is possible even with the government running modest deficits. Existing evidence points to <em>r</em><sup><em>safe</em></sup> &lt; <em>g</em> being the norm rather than the exception, both in recent years and broader historical data (<span id="jumplink-bib5"></span>Ball, Elmendorf, and Mankiw 1998; <span id="jumplink-bib50"></span>Mehrotra 2017).</p><p><span id="jumplink-fig12"></span>Figure&nbsp;XII plots the representative “safe rate of return” as the arithmetic average of bond and bill returns (dashed line) alongside real GDP growth (solid line), again as decadal moving averages. Starting in the late nineteenth century, safe rates were higher than GDP growth, meaning that any government wishing to reduce debt had to run persistent budget surpluses. Indeed, this was the strategy adopted by Britain to pay off the debt incurred during the Napoleonic War (<span id="jumplink-bib13"></span>Crafts 2016). The two world wars saw low real returns, but nevertheless a large debt accumulation to finance the wartime effort. The aftermath of these two wars, however, offered vastly different experiences for public finances. After World War I, safe returns were high and growth low, requiring significant budgetary efforts to repay the war debts. This was particularly difficult for many countries given the large interlocking reparations imposed by the Treaty of Versailles, and the turbulent macroeconomic environment at the time. After World War II, on the contrary, high growth and inflation helped greatly reduce the value of national debt, creating <em>r</em><sup><em>safe</em></sup> − <em>g</em> gaps as large as –10 percentage points.</p>                    <div data-id="fig12" data-content-id="fig12" swap-content-for-modal="true"><p><img src="https://oup.silverchair-cdn.com/oup/backfile/Content_public/Journal/qje/134/3/10.1093_qje_qjz012/1/m_qjz012fig12.jpeg?Expires=1721159456&amp;Signature=LZLY4Eiu2ZLZiyofpCLrtRi8piWOAAqjg5VopiEGMn-Jx8kSu8GgHuBdbCtkU609MapqDREhsXL91fWMzXc0YxWjRetAV~ftbL2g-3x2MWKSK-KusLY0lAv9Lx02y7mSFLIr2RuV48WykXRMJrP9hdIwN-xKAgivfcgOYXmEXjFyYK4fiiOa9C7Pd47B2gHDv50dgqzFlkZEXWo5r~S8edk9xaNjYGrAG2l8P5l3CYHcmzeQp~cyKGvOELUpC5WlZKtBl6L1jZk2Pfqvo9r~RF~lW~Y~HQLZtQ3pAKpXWzmbDEyMwu-Z6wfUJmrVsROJ-BDQwBxgL~h3RGRFMh~MUQ__&amp;Key-Pair-Id=APKAIE5G5CRDK6RD3PGA" alt="Trends in the Real Return on Safe Assets and GDP Growth" data-path-from-xml=""></p><div><p>Figure XII</p><div><p>Trends in the Real Return on Safe Assets and GDP Growth</p><p>Mean returns and GDP growth for 16 countries, weighted by real GDP.

On average throughout our sample, the real growth rate has been around 1 percentage point higher than the safe rate of return (3% growth versus 2% safe rate), meaning that governments could run small deficits without increasing the public debt burden.</p><p>In sum, real returns on safe assets have been quite low across the advanced countries over the past 150&nbsp;years. In fact, for some countries, these returns have often been persistently negative. Periods of unexpected inflation, in war and peace, have often diluted returns, and flights to safety may have depressed safe returns even further in the more turbulent periods of global financial history. The low return for investors has, on the flipside, implied a low financing cost for governments, which was particularly important in reducing the debts incurred during World War II.</p>                    <h2 scrollto-destination="137577827" id="137577827" data-legacy-id="sec6">VI.

The safe return is a simple unweighted average of bonds and bills.<sup><span id="jumplink-fn45"></span>45</sup> The left panel of <span id="jumplink-fig13"></span>Figure&nbsp;XIII shows the risky and safe asset returns, and the right panel depicts the risk premium, calculated as the risky minus safe difference.</p><p>As in <span id="jumplink-sec4"></span><a href="#sec4">Sections IV</a> and <span id="jumplink-sec5"></span><a href="#sec5">V</a>, the data presented here measure ex post returns and risk premiums, inclusive of capital gains. For some of the debates we touch on, however, a forward-looking expected return measure would have been preferable. Realized returns are likely to fall below ex ante return expectations during periods of large negative shocks, such as the two world wars, and rise above them in times of high capital gains, such as that between 1980 and today. Long-run data on expected returns are, however, difficult to obtain. Our focus on long-run trends, to an extent, allows us to look through some of the unexpected shocks that drive a wedge between ex ante and ex post returns. Nevertheless, the discussion in this section should be treated with a note of caution.</p><p>Both risky and safe returns were high during the nineteenth century but had been gradually declining in the run up to World War I, after which they declined sharply, as is to be expected. After the war, returns were recovering during the 1920s. From 1930 onward, the risky return stayed high and relatively stable, whereas the safe return dropped sharply and remained low until the late 1970s, before increasing and falling back again over the past three decades. These findings have implications for current debates around secular stagnation and the pricing, or mispricing, of risk.</p><p>Secular stagnation is associated with low rates of return, driven by an excess of savings or a general unwillingness to borrow and invest. These in turn reflect a variety of potential factors, including (i) lower rates of productivity growth; (ii) lower fertility and mortality rates; (iii) a decline in the relative price of investment goods; (iv) greater firm-level market power; and (v) higher income inequality (<span id="jumplink-bib60"></span>Rachel and Smith 2015; <span id="jumplink-bib17"></span>Eggertsson, Mehrotra, and Robbins 2017; <span id="jumplink-bib71"></span>Thwaites 2015).</p><p>Indeed, we can see that the safe return fell sharply during the 1930s, when <span id="jumplink-bib30"></span>Hansen (1939) originally proposed the secular stagnation hypothesis. That time also coincided with a demographic bust and was preceded by a big rise in income inequality in the run-up to the Great Depression. The safe return has been falling again since the mid-1980s, as many have noted.<sup><span id="jumplink-fn46"></span>46</sup> Understandably, this has led some observers to suggest that advanced economies are again in danger of entering secular stagnation, for example, <span id="jumplink-bib70"></span>Summers (2014) and <span id="jumplink-bib16"></span>Eggertsson and Mehrotra (2014).</p><p>The picture changes radically when we consider the trend in risky returns in addition to safe returns. Unlike safe returns, risky returns have remained high and broadly stable through the best part of the past 100&nbsp;years, and show little sign of a secular decline. Turning back to the trend for safe assets, even though the safe return has declined recently, much as it did at the start of our sample, it remains close to its historical average. These two observations call into question whether secular stagnation is quite with us. The high and stable risky return coupled with falling safe rates could also be consistent with the notion of a “safety trap” brought about by the relative shortage of safe assets (<span id="jumplink-bib10"></span>Caballero and Farhi 2017). However, with risk premiums still not far off their historical averages, the evidence for a safety trap is thus far also not clear-cut.</p><p>We turn to examine the long-run developments in the ex post risk premium, that is, the spread between safe and risky returns (right panel of <span id="jumplink-fig13"></span>Figure&nbsp;XIII). This spread was low and stable at around 5 percentage points before World War I. It rose slightly after World War I, before falling to an all-time low of near zero by around 1930. The decades following the onset of World War II saw a dramatic widening in the risk premium, with the spread reaching its historical high of around 14 percentage points in the 1950s, before falling back to around its historical average.</p><p>Interestingly, the period of high risk premiums coincided with an era of few systemic banking crises. In fact, not a single such crisis occurred in our advanced-economy sample between 1946 and 1973. By contrast, banking crises appear to have been relatively more frequent when risk premiums were low. This finding speaks to the recent literature on the mispricing of risk around financial crises.

The risky return is largely stable across time, even though it varies somewhat across countries: from just over 5% in Italy and Spain to 11% in Finland. Risk premiums were at or near their highest level in almost every country during the period 1950–1980, largely due to low returns on safe assets. The real safe rate of return was close to zero or negative for the majority of the countries in the sample, with the lowest level of –3.5% observed in Spain and Portugal, and only Belgium, Finland, and Germany experiencing robustly positive real returns. Meanwhile, risky returns were also somewhat above their long-run level in a number of countries, but the differences are relatively smaller than those for safe rates. The post-1980 period saw a recovery in safe returns across the board, with the recent downward trend not yet apparent in these longer-run period averages. Risky returns, meanwhile, were close to their historical levels in most countries, with only Japan experiencing a strong decline following the bursting of its asset price bubble in the 1990s.</p><p>We now turn to examine the correlations between risky and safe returns, which are displayed in <span id="jumplink-fig14"></span>Figure&nbsp;XIV. The top left panel of this figure shows the rolling decadal correlation between the risky and safe returns, calculated as the average of rolling correlations in individual countries in a similar fashion to the calculations in <span id="jumplink-fig8"></span>Figure&nbsp;VIII. Throughout most of the historical period under consideration, risky and safe returns had been positively correlated. In other words, safe assets have not generally provided a hedge against risk because safe returns were low when risky returns were low—in particular during both world wars—and vice versa. This positive correlation has weakened over the more recent decades and turned negative from the 1990s onward. This suggests that safe assets have acted as a better hedge for risk during both the Great Moderation and the recent Global Financial Crisis.</p>                    <div data-id="fig14" data-content-id="fig14" swap-content-for-modal="true"><p><img src="https://oup.silverchair-cdn.com/oup/backfile/Content_public/Journal/qje/134/3/10.1093_qje_qjz012/1/m_qjz012fig14.jpeg?Expires=1721159456&amp;Signature=WnmuI1UaBuQSpoo7wsfA1PBO8VEEMZnjHTpulD9CwxLIQX4DwAIfj~wC5NnsE477NtFeY5B7orJpq0MwTyfVJKYrInFfcCtmULDKq7STsR4DJMxPLiOJCqofoT8Mwsbuqi1WI0RZWUMGk4kYgRqa1CjGHZNsRjY5qiaQi2w8jUNYmihTE7fjNGA44JCWB6~lZ1UvXuNyg8w0djavX-C8eBPyXl6e0sqSjPDytSsCmPKR3QRh8ozuAMzXpPizg3LMlSDOOYeuN-9158Hn9cOPYtZs7oBkE48pBFPWa7XEHRG6nb9GmijeTEbT2tSMowrf7BC8yh2mvFimaXvGy9ih2w__&amp;Key-Pair-Id=APKAIE5G5CRDK6RD3PGA" alt="Correlations across Risky and Safe Asset Returns" data-path-from-xml=""></p><div><p>Figure XIV</p><div><p>Correlations across Risky and Safe Asset Returns</p><p>Rolling decadal correlations.

Moving to cross-country correlations depicted in the bottom two panels of <span id="jumplink-fig14"></span>Figure&nbsp;XIV, historically safe returns in different countries have been more correlated than risky returns. This has reversed over the past decades as cross-country risky returns have become substantially more correlated. This seems to be mainly driven by a remarkable rise in the cross-country correlations in risk premiums, depicted in the bottom right panel of <span id="jumplink-fig14"></span>Figure&nbsp;XIV. This increase in global risk comovement may pose new challenges to the risk-bearing capacity of the global financial system, a trend consistent with other macro indicators of risk-sharing (<span id="jumplink-bib38"></span>Jordà, Schularick, and Taylor 2017).</p>                    <h2 scrollto-destination="137577845" id="137577845" data-legacy-id="sec7">VII. <em>r</em> versus <em>g</em></h2>
<p>Our analysis provides insights into the debate on inequality. <span id="jumplink-bib56"></span>Piketty (2014) and <span id="jumplink-bib58"></span>Piketty and Zucman (2014) argue that inequality and wealth-to-income ratios in advanced economies have followed a U-shaped pattern over the past century and a half. They further hypothesize that wealth inequality may continue to rise in the future, along with a predicted decline in the rate of economic growth. The main theoretical argument for this comes about from a simple relation: <em>r</em> &gt; <em>g</em>. In their approach, a higher spread between the real rate of return on wealth, denoted <em>r</em>, and the rate of real GDP growth, <em>g</em>, tends to magnify the steady-state level of wealth inequality. <span id="jumplink-bib7"></span>Benhabib and Bisin (2016) show that in a wide class of models featuring stochastic returns to wealth, a higher gap between <em>r</em> and <em>g</em> increases the Pareto index of the steady-state wealth distribution, making it more unequal.</p><p>Of course, this is not the only channel through which rates of return can impact the wealth distribution. Rate of return differentials between asset classes can affect the wealth distribution if there are systematic differences in the portfolio composition between rich and poor households, as <span id="jumplink-bib43"></span>Kuhn, Schularick, and Steins (2017) show, or if rates of returns vary with portfolio size, as stressed by <span id="jumplink-bib56"></span>Piketty (2014). Studying administrative Swedish data, <span id="jumplink-bib4"></span>Bach, Calvet, and Sodini (2016) find that wealthy households earn higher returns on their portfolios, and <span id="jumplink-bib19"></span>Fagereng et al. (2016) use Norwegian tax data to document substantial heterogeneity in wealth returns. Rates of return on wealth are beginning to receive attention in the theoretical literature. For instance, <span id="jumplink-bib7"></span>Benhabib and Bisin (2016) point to return differences of assets as a potential channel to explain diverging trends between income and wealth inequality, and <span id="jumplink-bib24"></span>Garbinti, Goupille-Lebret, and Piketty (2017) show that asset price effects played an important role in shaping the French wealth distribution over the past 200&nbsp;years. Furthermore, wealth inequality may depend not only on the magnitude of <em>r</em> in relation to <em>g</em> but also on return volatility. Higher return volatility can increase the dispersion of wealth outcomes and make the distribution of wealth more unequal.</p><p>To bring our data to bear on these debates, we construct a measure of the world’s real return on wealth as a weighted average of real returns on bonds, equities, and housing—reflecting the typical portfolio of a private household end-investor. We then compare this measure to the rate of real GDP growth of economies over the long run. Importantly, our approach differs from <span id="jumplink-bib56"></span>Piketty (2014) in that we rely on annual returns from observed market prices and yields for each individual asset class, rather than implicit returns derived from aggregate balance sheet data at selected benchmark dates. This, we think, is more robust and provides a vital cross check for the core argument.</p><p>Similarly to the risky returns in <span id="jumplink-sec6"></span><a href="#sec6">Section&nbsp;VI</a>, we weight the individual returns by the size of the respective asset portfolio: stock market capitalization, housing wealth, and public debt (divided equally between bonds and bills).<sup><span id="jumplink-fn47"></span>47</sup><span id="jumplink-fig15"></span>Figure&nbsp;XV displays the long-run trends in the global real rate of return on wealth (dashed line) and the global real GDP growth rate (solid line) since the late nineteenth century, again using decadal moving averages of GDP-weighted data.</p>                    <div data-id="fig15" data-content-id="fig15" swap-content-for-modal="true"><p><img src="https://oup.silverchair-cdn.com/oup/backfile/Content_public/Journal/qje/134/3/10.1093_qje_qjz012/1/m_qjz012fig15.jpeg?Expires=1721159456&amp;Signature=mJQVq~xJ~kwRFv8OYRLDStQk-lt~g2HdtcNm6fS5ICfuM3v15qJvpEMPgK3bCz46yEz~kAQeL4gswNYtVKLhBRkJC1aq1XD9fLm3jYFPaiczAk133e7iwyQMLUVkJ1hiA5REIfgTwzBq~rG~EKubyTsnAklJfnwrp8x3UDE3lCZ2iR4y3q~TRQ7HPq3LkyJmcf~ewCAHh14pzDd1DNGmBZ9I3KF6CmQid6lxDoIspv8kao5OD0GoBV3f-nZh-ecCZayY5a2fV3l-n7ZrG-j6LGBd9q5F1tz-6G-cIQGu4V2Lkw0isKea1gHNtOl0zOZrubTQZPvTl2IGyPCCmso19Q__&amp;Key-Pair-Id=APKAIE5G5CRDK6RD3PGA" alt="The Real Return on Wealth and Real GDP Growth" data-path-from-xml=""></p><div><p>Figure XV</p><div><p>The Real Return on Wealth and Real GDP Growth</p><p>Mean returns and real GDP growth for 16 countries, weighted by real GDP.

Despite some variation, the positive gap between <em>r</em> and <em>g</em> is a persistent feature of the data: <em>r</em> is bigger than <em>g</em> in every country and every time period that we consider. The last few decades prior to the Global Financial Crisis saw a general widening of this gap, mirroring the aggregate pattern shown in <span id="jumplink-fig15"></span>Figure&nbsp;XV.</p>                    <div content-id="tblXII"><div id="tblXII" data-id="tblXII"><p><span id="label-17143">Table XII</span></p><p>The Return on Wealth and GDP Growth Across Countries and Time</p> </div><div><table role="table" aria-labelledby="

The high level of housing returns that we have uncovered serves to push up the level of <em>r</em>, and thus, potentially, wealth inequality. But what is the counterfactual? We need to bear in mind that housing wealth is more equally distributed than, for instance, equities (see, e.g., <span id="jumplink-bib43"></span>Kuhn, Schularick, and Steins 2017), and returns on housing are less volatile than those on shares—with both factors serving to flatten the distribution of wealth changes, making the overall impact of housing returns on wealth inequality less clear-cut and offering substantial scope for further research.</p><p><span id="jumplink-bib61"></span>Rognlie (2015) notes that recent trends in wealth and income could be influenced primarily by what has happened in housing. Real house prices have experienced a dramatic increase in the past 40&nbsp;years, coinciding with the rapid expansion of mortgage lending (<span id="jumplink-bib41"></span>Knoll, Schularick, and Steger 2017; <span id="jumplink-bib36"></span>Jordà, Schularick, and Taylor 2015, <span id="jumplink-bib37"></span>2016). This is very much evident from <span id="jumplink-tblIX"></span>Table&nbsp;IX. Measured as a ratio to GDP, rental income has been growing, as <span id="jumplink-bib61"></span>Rognlie (2015) argues. However, the rental yield has declined slightly—given the substantial increase in house prices—so that total returns on housing have remained pretty stable, as we have discussed. In this sense, recent housing trends have diverged little.</p><p>Our data allow us to more formally examine whether movements in the <em>r</em> − <em>g</em> gap are more closely related to return fluctuations or movements in the real GDP growth rate. <span data-supplement-target="sup1"></span><span><a path-from-xml="sup1" href="https://oup.silverchair-cdn.com/oup/backfile/Content_public/Journal/qje/134/3/10.1093_qje_qjz012/1/qjz012_supplemental_appendix.pdf?Expires=1721159456&amp;Signature=xkGB0UpEE74IGGPQq9OnEsVMktkyYpvUSklfgB6Rm9NZmDt7OgPPDUztXPIGA3yM4U5JT3EMJlwDGTggcH7q2QxylHCKJYVd-q3q0HyhNo8UKMRdfbQB1O-AAVwclcI8CPM7UeS2sNOXY1VO3EYiVyFeOrrGvDQOLyYiQ0Q6Mhbw9J4T3bksCbb0-NdzrowsM7VJiSfTQ1Oby~i9lM9zix2HlzH5Zq3D-E7u66Lo2buQAco8lvzYdDGpB5iMpia39cZi6lS-be~4qdy5R-Sakr--~EdtrSz1MVexzS8AhCvf5vJ5IwRtkWqnD0SKrxdbzYi2WF3TzXXdVU53BSFuow__&amp;Key-Pair-Id=APKAIE5G5CRDK6RD3PGA">Online Appendix</a></span> Q and Table&nbsp;A.26 document the correlations between <em>r</em> − <em>g</em> and <em>g</em>, and <em>r</em> − <em>g</em> and <em>r</em> across different time horizons, for the full sample and the period after 1950. Overall, the correlation between <em>r</em> − <em>g</em> and <em>g</em> is negative, and somewhat stronger at longer horizons, with the correlation coefficients ranging between –0.2 and –0.6 depending on the historical subperiod and time window. At the same time, the <em>r</em> − <em>g</em> gap is even more robustly related to changes in the return on wealth <em>r</em>, with a positive correlation between the two and a correlation coefficient of around 0.9, both over the short and long run. This suggests that both falling GDP growth and higher returns would tend to increase the <em>r</em> − <em>g</em> gap, although historically much of the changes in <em>r</em> − <em>g</em> have come about from movements in the return on wealth. During peacetime <em>r</em> has been quite stable, and so has been the <em>r</em> − <em>g</em> gap.</p><p>Since the 1970s, the stable and high levels of the rate of return on wealth have coincided with high and rising wealth-to-income ratios (see <span id="jumplink-bib58"></span>Piketty and Zucman 2014 and <span data-supplement-target="sup1"></span><span><a path-from-xml="sup1" href="https://oup.silverchair-cdn.com/oup/backfile/Content_public/Journal/qje/134/3/10.1093_qje_qjz012/1/qjz012_supplemental_appendix.pdf?Expires=1721159456&amp;Signature=xkGB0UpEE74IGGPQq9OnEsVMktkyYpvUSklfgB6Rm9NZmDt7OgPPDUztXPIGA3yM4U5JT3EMJlwDGTggcH7q2QxylHCKJYVd-q3q0HyhNo8UKMRdfbQB1O-AAVwclcI8CPM7UeS2sNOXY1VO3EYiVyFeOrrGvDQOLyYiQ0Q6Mhbw9J4T3bksCbb0-NdzrowsM7VJiSfTQ1Oby~i9lM9zix2HlzH5Zq3D-E7u66Lo2buQAco8lvzYdDGpB5iMpia39cZi6lS-be~4qdy5R-Sakr--~EdtrSz1MVexzS8AhCvf5vJ5IwRtkWqnD0SKrxdbzYi2WF3TzXXdVU53BSFuow__&amp;Key-Pair-Id=APKAIE5G5CRDK6RD3PGA">Online Appendix</a></span> Figure&nbsp;A.7). Together, these facts have meant that the capital share of GDP has increased across advanced economies (<span id="jumplink-bib39"></span>Karabarbounis and Neiman 2014).

Conclusion</h2>
<p>In this article we provide an investigation of the long history of advanced economy asset returns for all the major categories of the investable wealth portfolio. Our work brings new stylized facts to light and rigorously documents many broad patterns that have stimulated so much research in core areas of economics and finance over the past two centuries.</p><p>The returns to risky assets and risk premiums have been high and stable over the past 150&nbsp;years. Substantial diversification opportunities exist between risky asset classes, and across countries. Arguably the most surprising result of our study is that long-run returns on housing and equity look remarkably similar. Yet while returns are comparable, residential real estate is less volatile on a national level, opening up new and interesting risk premium puzzles.</p><p>Our research speaks directly to the relationship between <em>r</em>, the rate of return on wealth, and <em>g</em>, the growth rate of the economy, that figures prominently in the current debate on inequality. One robust finding in this paper is that <em>r</em> ≫ <em>g</em>: globally, and across most countries, the weighted rate of return on capital was twice as high as the growth rate in the past 150&nbsp;years.</p><p>These and other discoveries can provide a rich agenda for future research. Many issues remain to be studied, among them determining the particular fundamentals that drive the returns on each of the asset classes in typical economies. For now, we hope our introduction of this new compilation of asset return data can provide the evidentiary basis for new lines of exploration in years to come.</p>                    <h2 scrollto-destination="137577864" id="137577864" data-legacy-id="sec9">Supplementary Material</h2>

<p><strong>A $1,000,000+ competition towards open AGI progress.</strong></p>

<p>
    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2avWAHXUXXs?si=CTewe9L_Mp8XsDSo" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media;" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p>

<p>AGI progress has stalled. New ideas are needed.</p>

<h4 id="intelligence-vs-memorization">Intelligence vs Memorization</h4>

<p>Modern AI (LLMs) have shown to be great memorization engines. They are able to memorize high-dimensional patterns in their training data and apply those patterns into adjacent contexts. This is also how their apparent reasoning capability works. LLMs are not actually reasoning. Instead they memorize reasoning patterns and apply those reasoning patterns into adjacent contexts. But they cannot generate new reasoning based on novel situations.</p>

<p>More training data lets you "buy" performance on memorization based benchmarks (MMLU, GSM8K, ImageNet, GLUE, etc.) But memorization alone is not general intelligence. General intelligence is the ability to efficiently acquire new skills.</p>

<p>More scale will not enable LLMs to learn new skills. We need new architectures or algorithms that enable AI systems to learn at test time. This is how humans are able to adapt to novel situations.</p>

<p>Beyond LLMs, for many years, we've had AI systems that can beat humans at poker, chess, go, and other games. However, no AI system trained to succeed at one game can simply be retrained toward another. Instead researchers have had to re-architect and rebuild entirely new systems per game.</p>

<p>This is a failure to generalize.</p>

<p>Without this capability, AI will forever be rate-limited by the human general intelligence in the loop. We want AGI that can discover and invent alongside humans to push humanity forward.</p>

<p>Given the success and proven economic utility of LLMs over the past 4 years, the above may seem like extraodinary claims. Strong claims require strong evidence.</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="arc-agi">ARC-AGI</h3>

<p>Introduced by <a href="https://x.com/fchollet" target="_blank">François Chollet</a> in his influencial paper "<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.01547" target="_blank">On the Measure of Intelligence</a>", <a href="https://arcprize.org/arc">ARC-AGI</a> is the only AI eval which measures general intelligence: a system that can efficiently acquire new skills and solve novel, open-ended problems.</p>

<p>ARC-AGI was created in 2019 and the state-of-the-art (SOTA) high score was 20%. Today, only 34%.</p>

<p>Yet humans - even children - score 85% to 100%.</p>

<p>ARC-AGI is easy for humans and impossible for modern AI.</p>

<p>Most AI benchmarks rapidly saturate to human performance-level because they test only for memorization, which is something AI is superhuman at.</p>

<p>ARC-AGI is not saturating, in fact current pace is slowing down. It was designed to resist memorization and has proven extremely challenging for both the largest foundational transformer models as well as bespoke AI systems designed to defeat ARC-AGI.</p>

<p><img src="https://arcprize.org/media/images/ai-benchmarks.png" alt="ARC-AGI Benchmark Comparison"></p>

<p>A solution to ARC-AGI, at a minimum, opens up a completely new programming paradigm where programs can perfectly and reliably generalize from an arbitrary set of priors. We also believe a solution is on the critical path towards AGI</p>

<p><img src="https://arcprize.org/media/images/ThreeARCTasks.png" alt="3 ARC-AGI Tasks"></p>

<hr>

<h3 id="open-source-agi-progress">Open Source AGI Progress</h3>

<p>If you accept new ideas are needed, let's consider how to increase the rate of new ideas. Unfortunately, trends in AI are going the wrong way.</p>

<h4 id="closed-vs-open">Closed vs Open</h4>

<p>Starting with the GPT-4 release, frontier AGI progress has gone closed source. The <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08774" target="_blank">GPT-4 technical report</a> surprisingly contains no technical details. OpenAI said "competitive" reasons were the first reason why. Google's <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11805" target="_blank">Gemini technical report</a> also contains no technical details on the long context window frontier innovation.</p>

<p>LLMs have also shifted the majority of research attention away from new architectures and new algorithms. Over <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/article/ai-ascent-2024/" target="_blank">$20B was deployed</a> to non-general AI companies in 2023 and many frontier DeepMind researchers were restaffed to Gemini (in order to compete with OpenAI.)</p>

<p>Leading labs have strong incentives to loudly claim, "scale is all you need," and, "don't try to compete with us on frontier research," even though they all quietly believe new ideas are needed to reach AGI. Their bet is they can discover all the necessary new ideas within their labs.</p>

<h4 id="llm-history">LLM History</h4>

<p>But let's look at the history of LLMs. Specifically the transformer architecture. Transformers emerged many years downstream of machine translation research (e.g., English to Spanish.)</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>2014</strong>: Sutskever et. al. (Google) published <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.3215" target="_blank">Seq2Seq Learning</a> using RNNs and CNNs for variable length input vs output (English and Spanish words are not the same length.)</li>
  <li><strong>2016</strong>: Bahdanau et. al. (Jacobs University) popularized <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1409.0473" target="_blank">the concept of "attention"</a> so a system could consider different parts of the input to predict output (English adjectives come before nouns, Spanish after.)</li>
  <li><strong>2017</strong>: Vaswani et. al. (Google) realized <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.03762" target="_blank">"attention is all you need"</a>, dropping RNNs and CNNs, optimizing the architecture, enabling new scale</li>
  <li><strong>2018</strong>: Radford et. al. (OpenAI) <a href="https://d4mucfpksywv.cloudfront.net/better-language-models/language_models_are_unsupervised_multitask_learners.pdf" target="_blank">created GPT-2</a> built on top of the transformer architecture at frontier scale, showing emergent capabilities</li>
</ul>

<p>The story of the transformer is the story of science. Researchers in different labs and teams publish and build on top of each other's work.</p>

<p>While it is possible one lab could discover AGI alone, it is highly unlikely. The global chance of AGI discovery has decreased and will keep decreasing if we accepting this as status quo.</p>

<h4 id="progress">Progress</h4>

<p>I have spoken with many young students and would-be researchers over the past year. Many are depressed. There is a sense of dread that everything has been figured out already. But this is not true! The AI ecosystem is intentioanlly telling a partial-truth to boost their relative competitive positions to the detriment of actual progress towards AGI.</p>

<p>Worse, the inaccurate "scale is all you need" belief is now influencing the AI regulatory environment. Regulators are considering roadblocks to frontier AI research under the wrong assumption that AGI is imminent. The truth is no one knows how to build AGI.</p>

<p>We should be trying to incentivize new ideas, not slow them down. The internet and open source are the strongest innovation engines the world has ever seen.</p>

<p>By incentivizing open source we increase the rate of new ideas, increasing the chance we discover AGI, and ensure those new ideas are widely distributed to establish a more even playing field between small and large AI companies.</p>

<p>We hope ARC Prize can help counterbalance these trends.</p>

<p>As announced <a href="https://9to5google.com/2024/02/22/gpay-app-p2p/">in February</a>, “GPay” is no longer available in the US. The redesigned Google Pay was announced in 2020 to “make money simple, secure, and helpful” with plans for a “mobile-first bank account” that never came to fruition.</p>



<p>Starting on June 4, GPay — as was the name of the app on Android homescreens — automatically signed US users out. Attempting to login again explains how: “The Google Pay US app is no longer available. You can still tap to pay using the Google Wallet app.”</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" width="864" height="1920" src="https://9to5google.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2024/06/gpay-app-us.jpg?quality=82&amp;strip=all&amp;w=461" alt="" srcset="https://9to5google.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2024/06/gpay-app-us.jpg 864w, https://9to5google.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2024/06/gpay-app-us.jpg?resize=59,130 59w, https://9to5google.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2024/06/gpay-app-us.jpg?resize=315,700 315w, https://9to5google.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2024/06/gpay-app-us.jpg?resize=768,1707 768w, https://9to5google.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2024/06/gpay-app-us.jpg?resize=461,1024 461w, https://9to5google.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2024/06/gpay-app-us.jpg?resize=691,1536 691w, https://9to5google.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2024/06/gpay-app-us.jpg?resize=158,350 158w, https://9to5google.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2024/06/gpay-app-us.jpg?resize=140,311 140w, https://9to5google.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2024/06/gpay-app-us.jpg?resize=450,1000 450w, https://9to5google.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2024/06/gpay-app-us.jpg?resize=150,333 150w" sizes="(max-width: 864px) 100vw, 864px"></figure>



<p>Additionally, Google no longer offers peer-to-peer payments in the US. You can use the <a href="http://pay.google.com/">Google Pay website</a> to view and transfer your balance — money you’ve received or rewards— to a bank account after June.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The focus is now on Google Wallet and digitizing everything in your physical wallet. There’s no equivalent finance tracking functionality. Meanwhile, “Google Pay” still exists as the name for what you’re actually using when making a physical or online purchase with your phone.</p>

</ul>



<p>The main premise of the big redesign was an app centered “around your relationships with people and businesses” with message-like conversations serving as a purchase history. You could also keep track of your bank account and credit card (via Plaid) in the “Insights” tab, while a lot of deals and cash back offers were presented.</p>






<p>At the November 2022 announcement, co-branded checking and saving “Plex Accounts” were also <a href="https://9to5google.com/2020/11/18/google-pay-plex-account/">previewed</a>. Google partnered with banks and credit unions, most notably Citi. There would have been a physical card&nbsp;</p>



<p>Savings and the ability to create customizable goals was the other big tentpole. You could create specific tasks with milestones to break things up. One option would have been to “round-up transfers” on all purchases to help meet the goal.</p>

<p>Plex was supposed to launch in 2021, but Google announced <a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/10/01/google-pay-abandons-plans-for-plex-bank-accounts-w-400000-on-the-waitlist/">that October</a> how the project was canceled. This was despite a waitlist of 400,000 people. Officially, Google was shifting to “delivering digital enablement for banks and other financial services providers rather than us serving as the provider of these services.”</p>

<h2>Constituent Update&nbsp;</h2>

<p>July 21, 2023&nbsp;</p>

<p>Today, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) <a href="https://www.regulations.gov/document/FDA-2016-P-1171-0017"><u>denied a petition</u></a> requesting that the agency reconsider its denial of a <a href="https://www.regulations.gov/docket/FDA-2016-P-1171/document?sortBy=postedDate">citizen petition</a> issued on May 19, 2022. The citizen petition requested a ban on the use of eight <em>ortho</em>-phthalates<em> </em>and revocation of the prior sanctioned uses for five ortho-phthalates in food based on alleged safety concerns.</p>

<p><em>Ortho</em>-phthalates, often referred to as “phthalates,” are chemicals used in plastic products (most commonly in the specific type of plastic named polyvinyl chloride, also known as PVC or vinyl) to make the material soft and less brittle.</p>

<p>We evaluated the reconsideration petition and concluded that it does not provide a basis for modifying the FDA’s response to the original citizen petition. Our response explains that we adequately considered relevant information and views contained in the administrative record when responding to the original citizen petition. Additionally, we have considered the information submitted in the reconsideration petition and other relevant information in the administrative record. &nbsp;The FDA’s decision to deny the original petition remains unchanged.</p>

<p>We will continue to keep the food industry and the public informed of updates related to our activities on phthalates in food packaging and food contact applications. Up to date information is available on the FDA’s <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="520c05e8-8501-4ffb-b7cd-9885329219a2" href="https://www.fda.gov/food/food-additives-and-gras-ingredients-information-consumers/phthalates-food-packaging-and-food-contact-applications" title="Phthalates in Food Packaging and Food Contact Applications ">phthalates</a> website.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.infoq.com/news/2024/06/meta-llm-megalodon/">https://www.infoq.com/news/2024/06/meta-llm-megalodon/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40646820">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
								<p>Researchers from <a href="https://ai.meta.com/">Meta</a>, <a href="https://www.usc.edu/">University of Southern California</a>, <a href="https://www.cmu.edu/">Carnegie Mellon University</a>, and <a href="https://ucsd.edu/">University of California San Diego</a> recently open-sourced <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08801">MEGALODON</a>, a large language model (LLM) with an unlimited context length. MEGALODON has linear computational complexity and outperforms a similarly-sized <a href="https://www.infoq.com/news/2023/07/meta-new-ai-model/">Llama 2</a> model on a range of benchmarks.</p>

<p>MEGALODON is designed to address several shortcomings of the Transformer neural architecture underlying most LLMs. Instead of the standard multihead attention, MEGALODON uses a chunk-wise attention. The research team also introduced sequence-based parallelism during training, improving scalability for long-context training. When evaluated on standard LLM benchmarks, such as <a href="https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/winogrande">WinoGrande</a> and <a href="https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/mmlu">MMLU</a>, MEGALODON outperformed a Llama 2 model with the same amount of parameters, training data, and training compute budget. According to the researchers:&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>MEGALODON achieves impressive improvements on both training perplexity and across downstream benchmarks. Importantly, experimental results on long-context modeling demonstrate MEGALODON’s ability to model sequences of unlimited length. Additional experiments on small/medium-scale benchmarks across different data modalities illustrate the robust improvements of MEGALODON, which lead to a potential direction of future work to apply MEGALODON for large-scale multi-modality pretraining.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Although the Transformer architecture has become the standard for most Generative AI models, Transformers do have some drawbacks. In particular, their self-attention mechanism has quadratic complexity in both compute and storage, which limits the models' input context length. Several alternatives to the standard self-attention model have been developed recently, including structured state space models (SSMs) like <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00752">Mamba</a>, which scales linearly with context length. Another scheme that InfoQ recently covered is the <a href="https://www.infoq.com/news/2024/03/rwkv-llm-eagle-7b/">RWKV Project's</a> attention-free Transformer model, which has no maximum input context length.</p>

<p>MEGALODON builds on the research team's previous model, <a href="https://github.com/facebookresearch/mega">MEGA</a> (exponential moving average with gated attention), with several new features. First, while MEGA uses a "classical" exponential moving average (EMA) within its attention mechanism, MEGALODON computes a <em>complex</em>&nbsp;EMA (CEMA). Mathematically, the CEMA component makes MEGALODON equivalent to a "simplified state space model with diagonal state matrix."</p>

<p>The research team trained a seven-billion parameter model, MEGALODON-7B, using the same 2-trillion token dataset that Llama2-7B used; they also used the same training hyperparameters. The team observed that MEGALODON-7B was more computationally efficient. When the Llama model was scaled up to a 32k context length, MEGALODON-7B was "significantly" faster.</p>

<p>Besides evaluating MEGALODON-7B on standard LLM benchmarks, the researchers also tested its performance on the <a href="https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/scrolls">SCROLLS</a> long-context question-answering benchmark, and compared its results with several baseline models, including the modified Llama 2 model with a 32k context length. MEGALODON outperformed all baseline models on the NarrativeQA subtask, and on all tasks achieved results "competitive" with Llama 2.</p>

<p>In a discussion about MEGALODON on Hacker News, one user <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40054901">wondered how well the model performed on recall tasks</a>, given that other non-Transformer models tend to perform poorly. Another user replied:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>For what it's worth, RWKV's website on that matter mentions that yes it's bad on recall, but for the vast majority of tasks you can just ask the question *before* the content, and it'll handle the task just fine.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/XuezheMax/megalodon">MEGALODON code</a> is available on GitHub.</p>

<p dir="auto">Revideo is an open source framework for programmatic video editing. It is forked
from the amazing <a href="https://motioncanvas.io/" rel="nofollow">Motion Canvas</a> editor, with the goal
of turning it from a standalone application into a library that developers can
use to build entire video editing apps.</p>
<p dir="auto">Revideo lets you create video templates in Typescript and deploy an API endpoint
to render them with dynamic inputs. It also provides a React player component to
preview changes in the browser in real-time. If you want to learn more, you can
check out our <a href="https://docs.re.video/" rel="nofollow">docs</a>, our
<a href="https://github.com/redotvideo/revideo-examples">examples repository</a>, and join

<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Differences between Revideo and Motion Canvas</h2><a id="user-content-differences-between-revideo-and-motion-canvas" aria-label="Permalink: Differences between Revideo and Motion Canvas" href="#differences-between-revideo-and-motion-canvas"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Motion Canvas aims to be a
<a href="https://github.com/orgs/motion-canvas/discussions/1015">standalone editor</a> for
animations. While it happens to be distributed as an npm package, the
maintainers don't intend for it to be used as a library.</p>
<p dir="auto">We started out as users of Motion Canvas ourselves but ran into these
limitations when we wanted to build a video editing app on top of it. After
building our initial version using Motion Canvas' plugin system, we realized
that we wanted to make more fundamental changes to the codebase that would be
difficult to implement while keeping compatibility with the existing Motion
Canvas API.</p>
<p dir="auto">That's why we decided to fork the project and turn it into Revideo. We wrote a
bit more about it on our <a href="https://re.video/blog/fork" rel="nofollow">blog</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto">Concretely, some of the differences to Motion Canvas are the following ones:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><strong>Headless Rendering:</strong> Motion Canvas currently requires you to press a button
in its UI to render a video. We have exposed this functionality as a
<a href="https://docs.re.video/renderer/renderVideo/" rel="nofollow">function call</a> and are making it
possible to deploy a rendering API to services like Google Cloud Run
(<a href="https://github.com/redotvideo/revideo-examples/tree/main/google-cloud-run">example</a>,
or to use our CLI to expose a rendering endpoint from your Revideo project
(<a href="https://docs.re.video/render-endpoint" rel="nofollow">docs</a>)</li>
<li><strong>Faster Rendering:</strong> When building an app rather than creating videos for
yourself, rendering speeds are quite important. We have sped up rendering
speeds by enabling
<a href="https://github.com/redotvideo/revideo/pull/74" data-hovercard-type="pull_request" data-hovercard-url="/redotvideo/revideo/pull/74/hovercard">parallelized rendering</a> and
replacing the <code>seek()</code> operation for HTML video with our ffmpeg-based
<a href="https://github.com/redotvideo/revideo/pull/33" data-hovercard-type="pull_request" data-hovercard-url="/redotvideo/revideo/pull/33/hovercard">video frame extractor</a></li>
<li><strong>Better Audio Support:</strong> We have enabled audio export from <code>&lt;Video/&gt;</code> tags
during rendering, and have also added an <code>&lt;Audio/&gt;</code> tag that makes it easy to
synchronize audio with your animations.</li>
</ul>

<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Telemetry</h2><a id="user-content-telemetry" aria-label="Permalink: Telemetry" href="#telemetry"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">To understand how people use Revideo, we <strong>anonymously</strong> track how many videos
are rendered using the open-source tool
<a href="https://github.com/PostHog/posthog">Posthog</a>. You can find our code
implementing Posthog
<a href="https://github.com/redotvideo/revideo/tree/main/packages/telemetry">here</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto">If you want to disable telemetry, just set the following environent variable:</p>

REM is the stage in normal sleep when your brain should completely disconnect from the systems that keep you aware and vigilant, Stephan says.</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">People with subjective insomnia with this interrupted REM do not experience their sleep as restful. When wakened, they reported having had thoughts similar to those when awake—adding lettuce to their shopping list, say, or reminding themselves to call their cousin. They were less likely to have what University of Montreal neuroscientist Claudia Picard-Deland calls immersive dreams, in which you feel physically present in the dream world and are fleeing down a dark hallway, feeling the hardness of the floor or battling a dragon, sensing its hot breath.</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">In a study of normal sleepers Picard-Deland recently presented at the <a href="https://www.cogneurosociety.org/symposia/">the Cognitive Neuroscience Society’s annual meeting</a>, participants said they felt most deeply asleep during immersive dreams, which occurred in the REM stage. People with interrupted REM, as Stephan’s research shows, do not report immersive dreams. They do not feel they’ve slept deeply, and they report fatigue similar to that of people who actually sleep very little.</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">Perhaps even more important, says NIN sleep scientist Eus van Someren, interrupted REM is strongly linked to disorders such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and anxiety. If two people experience the same level of trauma, a good sleeper is probably less likely to develop PTSD than someone with disturbed sleep, he says. Those with disturbed sleep are therefore more vulnerable to developing PTSD. It’s a vicious cycle.</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">This occurs because interrupted REM interferes with the overnight dissolving of emotional distress that has accumulated throughout the daytime, which typically happens during good sleep. “Sound REM sleep is the only state during which the brain has a ‘<a href="https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/physrev.00046.2019">time-out</a>’ of noradrenaline [norepinephrine],” van Someren says. “The neurons are not firing anymore, so they don’t release noradrenaline downstream in the brain. But if you have even the slightest arousal from REM sleep..., then noradrenaline shoots up very fast.” He believes those with interrupted REM experience this arousal repeatedly and never reach the typical quiescent state that allows for the processing of troubled emotions.</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">A <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30590834/#:~:text=Conclusions%3A%20Our%20findings%20are%20the,actually%20aggravates%20physically%20perceived%20distress.">study</a> headed by van Someren’s former graduate student Rick Wassing, now at Macquarie University in Australia, demonstrates this experimentally. The researchers exposed people to a distressing emotional experience for three days in a row: they had to listen to a recording of themselves singing—often out of tune—to karaoke, which aroused shame. As measured by their physiological responses, normal sleepers felt less distress after a night’s sleep. Those with disturbed sleep felt more.</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">The percentage of people with insomnia that have interrupted REM is unknown, but these insights are suggesting new personalized treatments for insomnia, which is now understood as existing on a spectrum. Such treatments may be especially beneficial to people with insomnia who also have depression and anxiety disorders.</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">Currently, cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBTi) is the standard intervention for insomnia. People with insomnia learn to decrease their anxiety about sleeping and to employ behavioral strategies aimed at better sleep. But CBTi does not work for everyone. Those with interrupted REM, in particular, probably need different solutions.</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">One behavioral strategy used in CBTi—sleep restriction—does show promise for people with interrupted REM, however. Some sleep-restriction methods involve shortening a person’s time in bed to the average amount that they actually sleep per night. Other methods delay a person’s bedtime.” For example, If a person objectively sleeps for 5.5 hours, the experts allow the person to be in bed only for six hours. A preliminary lab <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-03564-6">study</a> in which participants delayed their regular bedtime by two hours showed that such sleep restriction can reduce the number of arousals during REM. The researchers are hoping to replicate these results in a larger study of people sleeping at home.</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">This new science also opens the way for drug interventions. The NIN group is seeking approvals to test whether a beta-blocker typically prescribed to lower blood pressure might mitigate the effects of continuous bursts of norepinephrine. The researchers are also considering testing the blood pressure drug clonidine in the hopes that it may help the brain reach a more quiescent state.</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">Until these interventions are available, says sleep researcher Geoffroy Solelhac of the Center for Investigation and Research in Sleep in Switzerland, “just understanding that their sleep is objectively different is reassuring to patients. They feel a sort of relief.” Knowing all that may even help them sleep better.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>As of June 10th, Nintendo has officially discontinued support for the Switch console’s integration with X (formerly Twitter), making it the last of the current-gen consoles to do so after <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/4/21/23692467/microsoft-disables-xbox-clip-sharing-to-twitter-from-consoles-and-pcs">Microsoft</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/6/23949343/playstation-x-sharing-options-ps5-ps4">Sony</a> disabled their own access last year.&nbsp;</p><p>The integration was removed as part of the <a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/22525/~/nintendo-switch-system-update-information">Nintendo Switch’s 18.1.0 update</a>, taking away the ability for users to link their X account with the console, or post in-game screenshots from <em>Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</em> directly to the social media platform. The removal of these features comprised the majority of the 18.1.0 update, which also includes some general stability improvements and ditches support for linking social media accounts via the Switch’s Friend Suggestions feature.</p><p>Nintendo announced these changes <a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/65057">last month</a> but didn’t explicitly state the reason for pulling support for X. Given Switch users can still share their content to Facebook, it likely has something to do with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/30/23662832/twitter-api-tiers-free-bot-novelty-accounts-basic-enterprice-monthly-price">pricing changes to the X API</a> which now <em>starts</em> at <a href="https://developer.x.com/en/products/twitter-api/enterprise/enterprise-api-interest-form#:~:text=Enterprise%20API%20pricing%20starts%20at,based%20on%20usage%20and%20needs.&amp;text=Acknowledgment%20of%20X%20Terms%20%2D%20By,to%20accept%20messages%20from%20X.">$42,000 a month</a> for enterprise customers.</p><p>Microsoft didn’t mention X’s API update when it removed the ability for Xbox consoles to share game uploads to the service last April, nor did Sony when it followed suit in November for the PS5 and PS4. Cost may not be the only factor as <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/24/23930686/slack-x-twitter-integration-retires-api-pricing">Slack said it had also pulled support</a> because the API updates impacted the functionality of its own X integration, but regardless of the reason, console gamers will now have a hard time connecting directly with the platform.&nbsp;</p><p>That’s despite the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/8/24152535/nintendo-switch-direct-sharing-to-x-twitter-ends-on-june-10th">X Gaming account saying</a> in a now-deleted post that its “partnership with Nintendo remains strong” after Nintendo announced its plans to kill Switch support.</p></div></div>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://briefer.cloud/blog/posts/self-serve-bi-myth/">https://briefer.cloud/blog/posts/self-serve-bi-myth/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40646312">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><p>Sales pitches are the only place where “self-serve dashboards" work. In the real world, it's a different story.</p>
<p>That story usually starts with an engineer or data scientist who's frustrated because they spend too much time writing queries and preparing dashboards for business people. They think that if they make BI easy enough, everyone will be able to “self-serve”, but that rarely ever happens.</p>
<p>What actually happens is that engineers and data scientists end up being the only people using the "self-serve" BI tool, which, ironically, makes it not self-serve at all.</p>
<br>
<h2>Why self-serve BI doesn't work</h2>
<p><strong>SQL is the only self-serve BI tool</strong>. Still, most "self-serve" BI vendors don't want to admit it, so they find ways to reinvent the wheel and disguise SQL as something else. Maybe that's what customers want to hear, or maybe they genuinely believe it, I'm not sure.</p>
<p>Either way, the problem with most approaches to "self-serve" BI is that they consider SQL to be the only barrier to business stakeholders querying data. That's not true.</p>
<p>Let's say you could wave a magic wand and make writing SQL queries as easy as writing an email. Do you think business stakeholders would suddenly start querying data? The answer is no.</p>
<p>Even if these people knew how to write SQL queries, they wouldn't understand the semantics of the data they're querying. They wouldn't know what the data means, where it comes from, or how it's calculated. They wouldn't know how to interpret the results, or how to validate them. In other words, writing the SQL query is actually the easy part.</p>
<p>Now, let's look at two attempts to make BI "self-serve" and see whether the hypothesis above holds.</p>
<br>
<h3>Attempt 1: The conventional "dropdowns and checkboxes" approach</h3>
<p>First, let's take a look at an example of a conventional "self-serve" BI interface which uses dropdowns and checkboxes as a way to make queries more accessible.</p>
<p><img src="https://briefer.cloud/posts/self-serve-bi/sql-by-mouse.png" alt=""></p>
<p>The first thing to notice is that this interface is just an attempt at what I call "SQL-by-mouse". I might be just an old grumpy person, but I don't see how this is any better than writing SQL. In fact, it's worse because it's slower, less reliable, more limited, and not generalizable to other tools.</p>
<p>In any case, I'll concede one thing: some non-technical people are just scared of any monospaced writing with syntax highlight, so this interface might be a good first step.</p>
<p>Anyway, let's ignore all these problems and just assume that this interface is the best thing since <a href="https://htmx.org/">htmx</a>. Let's assume that it's 100x easier to use than SQL.</p>
<p>Even if that were the case, your CFO, for example, wouldn't just go ahead and use these dropdowns and checkboxes to query data. The reason they wouldn't use it is that they don't have the context to understand the data they're querying, and they'll probably be insecure about the results, which they won't know how to validate because they don't understand how the data got there in the first place.</p>
<p>Now, I've got a question for you: if your CFO doesn't use this interface, who will? That's right, <em>you</em> will. And guess what's the first thing you'll do when you get to these dropdowns? Correct, you'll immediately look for somewhere to type in SQL. Oh, the irony.</p>
<br>
<h3>Attempt 2: The text-to-SQL approach</h3>
<p>Remember that magic wand that makes writing SQL queries as easy as writing an email? That's what text-to-SQL tools are. Nonetheless, they're not enough, just as I explained earlier.</p>
<p>Again, the problem is not the technology itself. In fact, LLMs are almost too effective at translating natural language into SQL. They will find a way to generate a query for any question you ask, even if that question doesn't make sense, which is exactly the problem.</p>
<p>On the other hand, a technical person would notice that the question doesn't make sense, and they would ask for more context. They would ask for details about the business person's hypothesis and the problem at hand. Then, they would explain what type of data is available, and work with the business person to formulate a precise and useful question.</p>
<p>Again, SQL is not the problem.</p>
<p>In any case, I do think LLMs could be the actual solution to self-serve BI, but not in its current form. For them to work, they'd need to be fed with more context, and <a href="https://allenpike.com/2024/llms-trained-on-internet">they need to get better at expressing uncertainty</a> and asking for more information.</p>
<br>
<h2>What actually works</h2>
<p>If we assume that the problem with self-serve BI is not SQL, but the context and semantics of the data, then it follows that the solution is to teach people about the data they're querying, regardless of interface.</p>
<p>The problem with this type of training is that it takes time, and most business stakeholders need answers this week, not next quarter.</p>
<p>Even in the best-case scenario, where companies train business stakeholders to understand the data they're querying, these people will need time to keep up with the changes in the database's schema, data models, and ETL processes.</p>
<p>Additionally, documenting all this knowledge generates significant overhead for the technical team, and it quickly gets out-of-date.</p>
<p>So what's the true solution to self-serve BI? The answer is simple: not to make BI self-serve for non-technical people. Instead, the solution is to make technical people support business stakeholders and help them do it more efficiently, using better tools.</p>
<p>The definition of a better tool may vary, but I have a few suggestions.</p>
<p>The first suggestion is to give LLMs to technical people, not business stakeholders. Even though text-to-SQL is not quite there in terms of understanding context and semantics, technical people <em>already</em> have context and semantics, so why not let <em>them</em> use it? That way, a single technical person can serve more business stakeholders, and do it faster.</p>
<p>The second suggestion is to give technical people more flexible tools. Instead of giving them dropdowns, or a SQL-only interface, let them play around with data using Python, R, or any other tool they're comfortable with. This way, they don't need to be passing data back and forth between different tools, and they're not limited by the capabilities of a BI tool.</p>
<p>The third and final suggestion is to make it easier for technical people to share their work. Notebooks and internal data applications are notoriously bad at that because they require others to deal with containers, dependencies, and infrastructure. It's a lot of overhead for a business stakeholder who just wants to see a chart. Instead, we need tools that have all the building blocks of a data application, but that are as easy to share as a Google Doc.</p>
<p>I'm obviously biased because I'm building <a href="https://briefer.cloud/">a data tool for technical people</a>, and it does exactly these three things. But what other choice do I have? I'd rather build tools that work than tools that don't. And, most importantly, I'd rather not pretend that the problem is something it's not.</p>

</a></p><p>The RP2040 is a microcontroller made by Raspberry Pi. Unlike their more widely known products, the
RP2040 is meant to be embedded in consumer electronics. It's cheap and available in tens of thousands
for immediate dispatch from your local Mouser.</p>
<p>I really like the RP2040 and I want you to know why.</p>

</a></p><p>Dozens of slightly different controllers. Why?</p>
<p>Unlike software, physical products cost money to manufacture. Every cent saved on a gizmo's components
is a cent in earnings, which adds up when the gizmos are manufactured by the million. This creates an incentive 
to pick a microcontroller that is only just powerful enough (to "right size" it), and usually microcontroller 
manufacturers are happy to help, offering dozens of variations of the same microcontroller.</p>
<p>Here is the Mouser stock for Raspberry Pi:</p>

</a></p><p>(This is the same microcontroller, just two different packaging options<sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup>.)</p>
<p>What?</p>
<h2 id="as-long-as-it-s-black">…as long as it's black</h2>
<p>Raspberry Pi pulled a Henry Ford and boldly went with just one microcontroller.</p>
<p>There is no choice, no right sizing, but that might be OK! An RP2040 costs ~70 cents, and not all gizmos are produced
by the million.</p>
<p>In return, Raspberry Pi ensured that everyone on the planet works with the same part. Compared to more traditional
wide lineups, there is a disproportionate number of StackExchange questions, blog posts (including this one), 
experience, Github issues, libraries, and tools for the RP2040<sup><a href="#2">2</a></sup>.</p>
<p>This is a good tradeoff for projects like <a href="https://late-mate.com/">Late Mate</a>, which are likely to save more on 
development costs than on parts<sup><a href="#3">3</a></sup>. </p>
<h2 id="down-the-stack">Down the stack</h2>
<p>This single model pragmatism is evident in the choices Raspberry Pi made for the microcontroller itself.
It is designed to be a jack-of-all-trades, trading "excellent" for "sufficient and flexible":</p>
<ul>
<li>Two decent cores. The second core is there if you need it.</li>
<li>30 GPIO pins, a very average number. </li>
<li>No on-board flash, spending the budget on more internal RAM that is much harder to wire externally.</li>
<li>An OK ADC, good USB support, and the usual peripherals (UART/SPI/I2C/PWM).</li>
</ul>
<p>Less conventionally, the RP2040 comes with a peripheral called "PIO" for Programmable Input/Output.
It's like two tiny coprocessors that can execute your IO fast, with precise timing, and without spending CPU time.
Some cool things people do with PIO:</p>
<ul>
<li>communication protocols like <a href="https://github.com/peterkrull/dshot-pio">DShot ESC</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/sekigon-gonnoc/Pico-PIO-USB">a fully featured USB stack on PIO</a>, giving RP2040 
a second USB controller</li>
<li>coupled with DMA, <a href="https://dmitry.gr/?r=06.%20Thoughts&amp;proj=09.ComplexPioMachines">display drivers</a> that
completely offload display+touch communication from the CPU</li>
</ul>
<p>The RP2040 is impossible to brick. It comes with a read-only bootloader that can either mount as a USB mass storage device
(firmware updates can just be copypasted to the "storage device"), or use 
<a href="https://github.com/raspberrypi/picotool">its own simple USB protocol</a>.</p>
<p>In the same pragmatic vein, the RP2040 doesn't engage in security theatre. Protecting the firmware from a dedicated
attacker is nearly impossible, but there are complexity and DX costs to trying, so I'm glad Raspberry Pi 
made the call.</p>
<p>I just love the deliberate design of this little square of silicon. When I work with it, I can see how 
smart people thought hard about the niche the RP2040 is in and drove the tradeoffs accordingly. As an engineer 
<sup>aspiring to be good someday</sup>, I appreciate it.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-testid="ArticlePageChunks"><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p><span>The Ocean Sciences</span> Building at the University of Washington in Seattle is a brightly modern, four-story structure, with large glass windows reflecting the bay across the street.</p><p>On the afternoon of July 7, 2016, it was being slowly locked down.</p><p>Red lights began flashing at the entrances as students and faculty filed out under overcast skies. Eventually, just a handful of people remained inside, preparing to unleash one of the most destructive forces in the natural world: the crushing weight of about 2½ miles of ocean water.</p><p>In the building’s high-pressure testing facility, a black, pill-shaped capsule hung from a hoist on the ceiling. About 3 feet long, it was a scale model of a submersible called <em>Cyclops 2</em>, developed by a local startup called <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/titan-sub-oceangate-hull-failure-loss-tragedy/">OceanGate</a>. The company’s CEO, Stockton Rush, had cofounded the company in 2009 as a sort of submarine charter service, anticipating a growing need for commercial and research trips to the ocean floor. At first, Rush acquired older, steel-hulled subs for expeditions, but in 2013 OceanGate had begun designing what the company called “a revolutionary new manned submersible.” Among the sub’s innovations were its lightweight hull, which was built from carbon fiber and could accommodate more passengers than the spherical cabins traditionally used in deep-sea diving. By 2016, Rush’s dream was to take paying customers down to the most famous shipwreck of them all: the <em>Titanic</em>, 3,800 meters below the surface of the Atlantic Ocean.</p><p>Engineers carefully lowered the <em>Cyclops 2</em> model into the testing tank nose-first, like a bomb being loaded into a silo, and then screwed on the tank’s 3,600-pound lid. Then they began pumping in water, increasing the pressure to mimic a submersible’s dive. If you’re hanging out at sea level, the weight of the atmosphere above you exerts 14.7 pounds per square inch (psi). The deeper you go, the stronger that pressure; at the <em>Titanic</em>’s depth, the pressure is about 6,500 psi. Soon, the pressure gauge on UW’s test tank read 1,000 psi, and it kept ticking up—2,000 psi, 5,000 psi. At about the 73-minute mark, as the pressure in the tank reached 6,500 psi, there was a sudden roar and the tank shuddered violently.</p><p>“I felt it in my body,” an OceanGate employee wrote in an email later that night. “The building rocked, and my ears rang for a long time.”</p><p>“Scared the shit out of everyone,” he added.</p><p>The model had imploded thousands of meters short of the safety margin OceanGate had designed for.</p><p>In the high-stakes, high-cost world of crewed <a href="https://www.wired.com/tag/submarines/">submersibles</a>, most engineering teams would have gone back to the drawing board, or at least ordered more models to test. Rush’s company didn’t do either of those things. Instead, within months, OceanGate began building a full-scale <em>Cyclops 2</em> based on the imploded model. This submersible design, later renamed <em>Titan</em>, eventually made it down to the <em>Titanic</em> in 2021. It even returned to the site for expeditions the next two years. But nearly one year ago, on June 18, 2023, <em>Titan</em> dove to the infamous wreck and imploded, instantly <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/titan-sub-debris-found/">killing all five people onboard</a>, including Rush himself.</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>The disaster captivated and horrified the world. Deep-sea experts criticized OceanGate’s choices, from <em>Titan</em>’s carbon-fiber construction to Rush’s public disdain for industry regulations, which he believed stifled innovation. Organizations that had worked with OceanGate, including the University of Washington as well as the Boeing Company, released statements denying that they contributed to <em>Titan</em>.</p><p>A trove of tens of thousands of internal OceanGate emails, documents, and photographs provided exclusively to WIRED by anonymous sources sheds new light on <em>Titan</em>’s development, from its initial design and manufacture through its first deep-sea operations. The documents, validated by interviews with two third-party suppliers and several former OceanGate employees with intimate knowledge of <em>Titan</em>, reveal never-before-reported details about the design and testing of the submersible. They show that Boeing and the University of Washington were both involved in the early stages of OceanGate’s carbon-fiber sub project, although their work did not make it into the final <em>Titan</em> design. The trove also reveals a company culture in which employees who questioned their bosses’ high-speed approach and decisions were dismissed as overly cautious or even fired. (The former employees who spoke to WIRED have asked not to be named for fear of being sued by the families of those who died aboard the vessel.) Most of all, the documents show how Rush, blinkered by his own ambition to be the Elon Musk of the deep seas, repeatedly overstated OceanGate’s progress and, on at least one occasion, outright lied about significant problems with <em>Titan</em>’s hull, which has not been previously reported.</p><p>A representative for OceanGate, which ceased all operations last summer, declined to comment on WIRED’s findings.</p><figure><p><span><p>OceanGate CEO Stockton Rush aboard the <em>Cyclops 1</em> in 2015.</p>
</span><span>Photograph: Courtesy of Mark Harris</span></p></figure><p><span>I met Stockton</span> Rush on June 24, 2015, while reporting on OceanGate for New Scientist magazine. A former flight engineer and tech investor, Rush was already styling himself a subaquatic Musk. “I wanted to be the first person on Mars until I realized there was nothing there,” Rush told me at a city center dock in Seattle. “But in the ocean, there are new life-forms, things people have never discovered.” Rush believed that Earth’s oceans, not outer space, were where humanity would find refuge from existential risks like climate change. “My goal is to move the needle,” he told me.</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>Around us, employees were prepping OceanGate’s prototype submersible, the <em>Cyclops 1</em>, for its deepest dive to date. The sub was a cylindrical, steel-hulled design rated for dives up to 500 meters. OceanGate had acquired it a few years earlier and refurbished it, adding LEDs and a PlayStation controller for easy steering, and replacing an ugly exterior cabin with a sleek white plastic fairing to protect components outside the hull. Together with the large acrylic viewport, the effect was a sort of one-eyed robot shark. Up to five people could squeeze inside—which is what Rush and I were about to do, for a test dive in Seattle’s Elliott Bay.</p><p>Ninety minutes later and 130 meters deeper, we were totally lost. First the thruster software had glitched, leaving us floating just above the seafloor. Now the sub’s compass was acting up. The shipwreck we aimed to explore, a rail ferry that had once carried Teddy Roosevelt, was nowhere to be seen. All I could spy outside the <em>Cyclops</em>’ forward dome was the occasional salmon dancing in the frigid water.</p><p>As I began to feel the chill seeping through the sub’s steel hull, Rush asked me to open my iPhone’s compass app. He wanted to compare it to the one on his phone. The headings did not match, but he rebooted the thrusters and we set off in what he was pretty sure was the right direction.</p><p>“You’re heading in exactly the wrong direction,” said a faint voice transmitted via an acoustic link from the support ship tracking us on the surface. We eventually located the sunken ship, its rotting bow emerging into the <em>Cyclops</em>’ headlight. It was an otherworldly experience, made more thrilling by the hint of danger.</p><p>Back at the dock, Rush brushed off the problems we had encountered. This is exactly why OceanGate started with the <em>Cyclops 1</em>, he said, rather than anything capable of diving deeper. “I could have built a multimillion-dollar version and all of a sudden I’ve got to figure out really stupid stuff like the magnetic compass,” he told me. “The <em>Cyclops 1</em> is getting us ready. When we do the <em>Cyclops 2</em>, then all these bugs will be out.”</p><p>The <em>Cyclops 2</em>, which Rush renamed <em>Titan</em> in 2018, was already on the drawing board. And Rush believed he had the biggest bug—how to make a vessel that could safely dive 20 times deeper than America’s nuclear subs—worked out. He would use a modern wonder material: carbon fiber.</p><p>Carbon-fiber composites are some of the strongest materials available to engineers. They are formed of thin strands of atomic carbon within plastic resins, layer upon layer, then cured carefully at high temperatures. The resulting composites can be both stronger and lighter than titanium, and it was this combination that caught Rush’s attention. A carbon-fiber <em>Titan</em> could be roughly the same size and weight as the steel <em>Cyclops</em> and yet be able to dive up to 12 times deeper. It would be much cheaper for a support vessel to carry and deploy at sea than a metal sub, and would also be more buoyant, reducing the risk of getting stranded on the ocean floor. While carbon fiber has been used in everything from cars to rockets, no one had ever dived in a deep-water carbon-fiber submersible. Rush wanted to be the first.</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>In 2013, OceanGate struck up a partnership with the University of Washington’s Applied Physics Laboratory to develop the new sub. The university has a long history of working with composites and designing its own underwater vehicles. It also already had a relationship with OceanGate, after using its subs for research; the physics lab helped write the software used by <em>Cyclops 1</em>. The university touted the arrangement in press releases at the time: “UW, Local Company Building Innovative Deep-Sea Manned Submarine,” read one headline from October 2013. The story was updated with a note in 2023 saying that “the vessel that resulted from this partnership” was the <em>Cyclops 1</em>. Emails from OceanGate leaked exclusively to WIRED indicate that UW researchers provided hundreds of detailed 3D CAD drawings of components for a carbon-fiber sub between 2013 and 2016, as part of a $5 million contract. But the relationship between the lab and OceanGate was contentious, according to emails.</p><p>UW claims that OceanGate and the lab parted ways after just $650,000 worth of work, and former OceanGate employees told WIRED that none of UW’s hardware or software work wound up in the finished sub.</p><p>OceanGate also announced that Boeing Research &amp; Technology was helping with the project. In October 2013, two engineers at Boeing, Mark Negley and William Koch, produced a detailed 70-page preliminary design containing renderings, manufacturing advice, and technical analysis. These details of Boeing’s involvement have not been reported before. “Boeing was not a partner on the <em>Titan</em> and did not design or build it,” Jessica Kowal, a spokesperson for Boeing, said in a statement. The company declined to answer on the record any other questions from WIRED. Negley and Koch, who are still employed by Boeing, did not respond to LinkedIn messages.</p><p>Even at this early stage, these engineers were warning of potential problems ahead.</p><p>Negley and Koch pointed out that although composites can be stronger than any metal, they have other challenges. Carbon fiber can get progressively weaker, sometimes in unexpected ways. The manufacturing process can introduce defects if the resin is cured too long or not long enough, if debris gets in, or if the material is laid or wound unevenly. And the more layers a structure has, the engineers wrote, the greater the risk of a defect that would weaken it. <em>Titan</em> would ultimately have 660 layers of carbon fiber. To mitigate these risks, the Boeing engineers suggested a rigorous quality assurance process during manufacture and ultrasound testing of the hull after it was made. Ultrasound scans could find defects or delaminations in the hull—places where the carbon-fiber layers had separated.</p><p>To manufacture the hull, Rush turned to a company called Spencer Composites. First, though, OceanGate needed a scaled-down model of the hull to test how it would fare against the intense pressures at the bottom of the sea. By 2015, according to a design document written by Spencer, OceanGate wanted its hull to be rated up to 6,000 meters and have a safety factor of up to 2.25—meaning that it should be stable to two and a quarter times that depth, or 13,500 meters. James Cameron’s record-setting <em>Deepsea Challenger</em> had a safety factor of 1.36. <em>Alvin</em>, the submersible that originally explored the <em>Titanic</em>, had a 1.8 or higher. (Spencer Composites did not respond to requests for comment.)</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>In June 2015, just before my trip in <em>Cyclops 1</em>, engineers placed a one-third scale model of <em>Titan</em> in an 8-foot-long testing tank at APL-UW for its first pressure test. This model was built entirely of carbon fiber, including the end domes, which ended up failing at pressures equating to around just 3,000 meters, according to a report written by Rush. OceanGate commissioned Spencer to make more domes, but these would take months to arrive. Meanwhile, the cylinder was tested again, this time with solid aluminum discs on the ends, and reached 4,100 meters without incident. But when OceanGate received the new carbon-fiber domes and tested the hull in March 2016, the new domes again imploded at 3,000 meters.</p><p>The test that “scared the shit out of everyone,” in one engineer’s words, was OceanGate’s fourth. This time, the hull (again with aluminum caps) reached the equivalent of 4,500 meters before imploding, giving it a miserly 1.18 safety factor for any dives to <em>Titanic</em> depths.</p><figure><p><span><p>Damage to the scale model after imploding in the testing tank.</p>
</span><span>Photograph: Courtesy of a former OceanGate employee</span></p></figure><p>“Over the next months we will analyze the data in detail … and then run a test with a new cylinder through at least 1,000 cycles to confirm its durability,” Rush wrote to shareholders at the time. That replacement scale model was not made, and the new tests never happened, former employees tell WIRED, in part because Rush trusted OceanGate’s computer models. Even when OceanGate decided to change the domes in the final design from carbon fiber to titanium, Rush didn’t commission models to test the interactions between the new materials; one former employee who was familiar with Rush’s decision says the CEO balked at the high price tag.</p><p>“The modeling says it’s OK. The analysis says it’s OK,” one former employee says. “We build airplanes on the same type of analysis and then we go throw people in them.”</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>But a low-pressure environment, like flying, is different from a high-pressure one. Carbon fiber is inherently stronger when holding pressure in, like what happens with an aircraft in the stratosphere, than when keeping pressure out, as happens underwater. And all cylindrical vessels resist buckling better when the air pressure is higher inside.</p><p>Submersible experts not associated with OceanGate told WIRED that they would do much more testing on a new design. “We did at least 10 scale-model pressure hulls that we tested to destruction,” says Adam Wright, an engineer who had worked on explorer Steve Fossett’s 2005 carbon-fiber sub, which was shelved after Fossett died in a plane crash. And that was for a submersible that would only be used for a single mission. OceanGate was planning to use its submersible repeatedly—up to 10,000 times, according to internal design documents.</p><p>“Carbon fiber is a very sensible material if it’s been engineered correctly and manufactured in a controlled way,” says Chase Hogoboom, president and cofounder of Composite Energy Technologies, which has successfully tested small carbon-fiber vessels to the equivalent of 6,000 meters hundreds of times. “It takes millions of dollars and many years, but it’s not rocket science. It’s just connecting the dots.”</p><p>OceanGate tested the model hull to destruction only once, and never used the titanium components that would become fixtures on the final sub. Instead, the company simply increased the thickness of the carbon-fiber hull in its design specs from 4.5 to 5 inches, and commissioned Spencer to build the real thing. (Later, OceanGate engineers found that <em>Titan</em>’s full-size hull was too thick for portable ultrasonic scanners, and a coating Spencer had applied to it would further block the signals. Rush decided that moving the entire sub to a lab for scanning would be too expensive, says a former employee who was familiar with Rush’s thinking. As a result, no scans were made—going against the advice of both Boeing and OceanGate engineers.)</p><figure><p><span><p>Key components of the <em>Titan</em> submersible</p>
</span></p></figure></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>Unlike <em>Cyclops 1</em>, with its large, 180-degree viewing dome, <em>Titan</em>’s front dome was made of solid titanium, with a smaller 23-inch viewport in the center. The viewport, made from 9-inch-thick acrylic, was an entirely new design by Tony Nissen, OceanGate’s director of engineering, and it was going to be manufactured by a company called Hydrospace Group.</p><p>Will Kohnen, Hydrospace’s CEO, told WIRED that he had originally expected Rush to thoroughly test the viewport according to rigorous standards set by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers. Under those standards, OceanGate would test at least five windows to destruction at high pressure, cycle a viewport from low to high pressure a thousand times, and subject another viewport to five times the intended pressure for 300 consecutive hours to see how much the plastic slowly shrank under pressure, says Kohnen.</p><p>“The more innovative you get, the more testing you’ve got to do,” Kohnen says. “Over a period of years, it was pretty obvious that OceanGate wasn’t going to do the testing.” The former employees who spoke to WIRED also said that OceanGate wasn’t testing the viewport to the society’s standards.</p><p>By the fall of 2017, Kohnen was getting worried. As a last-ditch effort, in November he sent Rush an email offering “a serious discount” to build a second viewport using a design that had been tested and certified to 4,000 meters. It could be swapped out for the experimental window within 24 hours, he wrote. Kohnen says that Rush told him he wasn’t interested.</p><p>Kohnen delivered OceanGate’s viewport in December. He would rate it to only 650 meters—one-sixth of the depth to the <em>Titanic</em>. He also shared an analysis, done pro bono by an independent expert, concluding that OceanGate’s design might fail after only a few 4,000-meter dives. OceanGate nevertheless installed the viewport in <em>Titan</em> later that month. Construction on the sub was almost complete, and the company was already advertising its first expedition to the <em>Titanic</em> in May.</p><p><span>It was time</span> for the engineers to hand it over to OceanGate’s operations team for testing at sea. But there was another snag. David Lochridge, who oversaw marine operations at the company and who needed to sign off on the transfer, became convinced that <em>Titan</em> was unsafe. In January 2018, Lochridge sent Rush a quality-control inspection report detailing 27 issues with the vehicle, from questionable O-ring seals on the domes and missing bolts to flammable materials and more concerns about its carbon-fiber hull. Rush fired him the next day. (Although Lochridge later made a whistleblower report to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration about <em>Titan</em>, Rush sued him for breach of contract. The settlement of that lawsuit resulted in Lochridge dropping his complaint, paying OceanGate nearly $10,000, and signing an NDA. Lochridge did not respond to WIRED.)</p><p>Will Kohnen also couldn’t forget about <em>Titan</em>, and the foreboding he had about the whole enterprise. “We have a rogue element within the submersible industry,” he remembers thinking. If something went wrong with <em>Titan</em>, it might scare people off deep-sea exploration more widely. In March 2018, he drafted a letter, signed by more than 30 crewed submersible experts, urging Rush to test the vessel with an accredited outside group. (The letter was earlier <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/20/us/oceangate-titanic-missing-submersible.html">reported</a> by the New York Times.)</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>Virtually all marine vessels are certified by organizations such as the American Bureau of Shipping, DNV, or Lloyd’s Register, which ensure that they are built using approved materials and methods and carry appropriate safety gear. It has been widely reported that Rush was dismissive of such certification, but what has not been made public until now is that OceanGate pursued certification with DNV (then known as DNV GL) in 2017—until Rush saw the price. “[DNV] informed me that this was not an easy few thousand dollar project as [it] had presented, but would cost around $50,000,” he later wrote in an email to Rob McCallum, a deep-sea explorer who had also signed Kohnen’s letter.</p><p>“<em>Titan</em> and its safety systems are way beyond anything currently in use … I have grown tired of industry players who try to use a safety argument to stop innovation and new entrants from entering their small existing market,” Rush wrote to McCallum. “Since [starting] OceanGate we have heard the baseless cries of ‘you are going to kill someone’ way too often.”</p><p>Days later, Rush received an even more pointed warning from Boeing’s Mark Negley, who had stayed in contact with the CEO after he helped with a preliminary design. Negley had recently carried out an analysis of Spencer Composites’ hull based on information Rush had shared. He did not mince words when sharing his findings, which WIRED is reporting for the first time. “We think you are at a high risk of a significant failure at or before you reach 4,000 meters. We do not think you have any safety margin,” he wrote in an email on March 30. “Be cautious and careful.”</p><p>Negley provided a graph charting the strain on the submersible against depth. It shows a skull and crossbones in the region below 4,000 meters.</p><figure><p><span><p>The chart Mark Negley shared with Stockton Rush</p>

His confidence in <em>Titan</em> was based in part on the new safety systems OceanGate had designed. “A lot of risk mitigation was supposed to ride on the real-time health monitoring,” says one former employee. The heart of that system, designed by an experienced electrical engineer and OceanGate board member named Mike Furlotti, was a suite of sensors and microchips that analyzed the hull’s acoustic emissions—the little pops made by carbon fibers as they break under compression. OceanGate’s theory was that the hull would be fairly noisy on its first few dives but would get quieter when taken to the same depths over and over, one former employee explains. If the acoustic monitoring system started getting really loud on a dive, that would be a clear indication to surface immediately. (Multiple attempts to contact Furlotti for comment were unsuccessful.)</p><p>Wright and other industry experts have been extremely critical of this setup. “I’m sure you can pick up these acoustic events fine, but you just don’t know when the end point is,” he says. “You don’t know how many pops is too many, and it could be different for every vessel.”</p><p>There was even skepticism within OceanGate itself. In September 2017, the engineer responsible for integrating Furlotti’s design into <em>Titan</em> sent an anxious email to management expressing concerns about the system’s ability to accurately track fiber breakage over time.</p><p>OceanGate hired an outside consultant named Allen Green to assess the acoustic monitoring. Green, an authority on the sounds that materials make under stress, endorsed the system in 2018. Later, though, when Green saw how Rush was describing the system to the public—the CEO claimed it could detect the sound of “micro-buckling” in the sub’s hull “way before it fails”—he wrote a concerned email to an OceanGate employee, reported here for the first time.</p><p>Rather than warning of failure, Green explained that the sounds indicated “irreversible” damage. “It is my belief, substantiated by many years of experience, that composite structures all have a finite lifetime,” wrote Green, who died in 2021. “While I do not intend to be an alarmist, I did not sleep well and arose early to send this message.”</p><p><span>Rush had pitched</span> OceanGate’s board and investors on a grand vision of what his company could be. By 2018, that included a fleet of self-driving <em>Titan</em>s that could dive to 6,000 meters, and satellite offices in Croatia, Israel, and the South Pacific. He imagined a world whose oceans were populated by OceanGate’s crewed underwater bases, which could be used for data storage or even “Plan B habitats” for billionaire preppers.</p><p>Reality was more prosaic. Like most startups, OceanGate was in constant need of funds. Rush was trying to save money wherever he could. Interns, who made up around a third of the engineering team, were paid as little as $13 an hour. (When a manager pointed out in 2016 that Washington’s minimum wage was just $9.47 an hour, Rush responded, “I agree we are high. $10 seems fair.”) Rush also downgraded the sub’s titanium components from aerospace grade 5 quality to weaker and cheaper grade 3, says one former employee.</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>According to internal documents, by 2018 the company had raised around $9 million in venture capital and another $4 million from subsidiary companies that profited off OceanGate’s research and scientific missions. But the real business opportunity would be trips to the <em>Titanic</em>.</p><p>Rush had planned six missions to visit the legendary shipwreck in the summer of 2018, each with nine people paying $105,000. With every mission bringing in nearly a million dollars in revenue but costing OceanGate only an estimated $333,000, the more visits <em>Titan</em> could make to the bottom of the North Atlantic, the better. Although the plan was for the finished sub to make more than 30 dives in shallow water before going to deeper waters, OceanGate managed just 18.</p><p>In mid-April, <em>Titan</em> was transported to Marsh Harbour in the Bahamas, where deep water could be found very close to land. But before <em>Titan</em> was even moved into the water, it was hit by lightning, damaging its electronics. Some of the damaged equipment was replaced, but the sub was without many components for weeks. Rush nevertheless insisted on attempting a shallow dive during high, rolling seas.</p><p>Choppy waves ripped fairings and foam from <em>Titan</em> as it was being towed back from the dive site, causing it to sink. “I was merely ‘spam in the can’ with no comms for 9+ hours inside the sub,” Rush wrote the next day. “I could see parts of the sub floating away on my cameras, but could not communicate to the tow team—a remarkably surreal and frustrating experience.”</p><p>Rush had to face facts: There was now no chance of OceanGate reaching the <em>Titanic</em> in 2018. Eager ticket holders (and investors) would have to wait another year.</p><p>While they were still in the Bahamas, the team did manage to lower <em>Titan</em> on a series of uncrewed dives, eventually reaching 4,000 meters. But engineers found the hull was warping more under compression than it was meant to, by perhaps as much as 37 percent. Nevertheless, Rush wanted to keep diving deeper with <em>Titan</em>, with himself at the helm. When one engineer expressed concern about performing crewed tests at this point, Nissen wrote to him, “Yesterday I told you if you don’t have the stomach for this type of engineering then OceanGate isn’t for you.”</p><p>On December 10, Rush successfully dove <em>Titan</em> to a depth of 3,939 meters—just enough to get to the <em>Titanic</em>. Nissen wrote to the engineering team: “Diving to such deep depths is extremely complicated if you want to be untethered, communicate with the surface, be location tracked with reasonable accuracy, and monitor the health of your vehicle. And, we have delivered. You all have a lot to brag about.”</p><p><em>Titan</em> reached a similar depth again in April, with a crew of four including Rush. While OceanGate touted the dive as history-making proof of its submersible’s bona fides, even Rush was getting worried about loud noises the hull was making at depth. Then on June 7, three weeks before <em>Titan</em>’s maiden voyage to the <em>Titanic</em>, an OceanGate pilot inspecting the interior with a flashlight noticed a crack in the hull. He sent Rush an email warning that the crack was “pretty serious.” A detailed internal report later showed that at least 11 square feet of carbon fiber had delaminated—meaning the bonds between layers had separated.</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>This time, Rush couldn’t ignore the data. The hull that was meant to last for 10,000 dives to the <em>Titanic</em> had made fewer than 50—and only three to 4,000 meters. It would have to be scrapped, and the <em>Titanic</em> missions would be delayed for yet another year. When Rush shared the news with <a data-offer-url="https://www.geekwire.com/2019/oceangate-puts-off-plans-dive-titanic-shipwreck-due-topside-tangle/" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.geekwire.com/2019/oceangate-puts-off-plans-dive-titanic-shipwreck-due-topside-tangle/&quot;}" href="https://www.geekwire.com/2019/oceangate-puts-off-plans-dive-titanic-shipwreck-due-topside-tangle/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">GeekWire</a> a few days later, however, he blamed the delay on legal complications with <em>Titan</em>’s support vessel.</p><p>It’s true that OceanGate ran into issues with maritime law, says one former employee: “The lie is that it was not the reason we delayed.”</p><p><span>After the crack</span> was found in <em>Titan</em>’s hull, OceanGate started searching for a new carbon-fiber contractor. By early 2020, many OceanGate engineers had been laid off or had left the company, insiders say. Tony Nissen was out, and a team that had once numbered more than 20 was reduced to just a handful. “Stockton never really wanted an engineering team, but he needed somebody to build it,” says one insider. “We were down to a skeleton team,” says another.</p><p>Rush then announced that the company had inked a partnership with NASA to “collaborate on the development, manufacturing, and testing” of a new carbon-fiber cylinder. (Covid-19 had other plans, shutting down NASA for months. Ultimately, the agency told ABC, “NASA did not conduct testing and manufacturing via its workforce or facilities.”)</p><p>The new hull would instead be made by two aerospace firms in Washington state, Electroimpact and Janicki Industries. Electroimpact laid the carbon fibers, and Janicki cured the material in its ovens, confirmed one former employee. Electroimpact did not provide a response to questions about its role, and Janicki declined to comment.</p><p>This time, OceanGate had two scale models made, which were once again tested at the University of Washington. Once again, the models imploded early, possibly due to warping of the hulls during manufacturing, says a former employee.</p><p>OceanGate scrambled to solve the issue. One idea: Rather than cure all the layers at once, they would cure the hull in stages. Electroimpact would wind about 100 layers of the hull, then ship it to Janicki to cure and settle. Then Janicki would send the hull back to Electroimpact to repeat the process. They were running out of time, so they went for it—skipping tests of the new procedure on samples and going straight to manufacturing the second hull. “The first time we did multiple cures was when we did the full hull,” says one former employee. The new hull was finished by January 2021. It passed pressure testing, similar to what was done at the University of Washington, but at a facility in Maryland that could accommodate the full-size cylinder.</p><p>OceanGate’s engineers now needed to integrate the new hull with the rest of <em>Titan</em>. But <em>Titan</em>’s two titanium domes were still attached to each end of the old hull, sitting on titanium rings glued to the carbon fiber with aerospace-grade epoxy adhesive. Commissioning new titanium interface rings and domes was ruled “an absolute no” by Rush, one former employee says, because of the extra cost and delay. The company that made the original titanium components told WIRED that it did not make new rings for Rush, and three former employees say that OceanGate did, in fact, salvage and reuse the originals.</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>But staff had difficulty working out how to separate the old hull from the interface rings without damaging even a sliver of titanium. Gaps or bumps could have weakened the join with the new hull, say the sources. On dives, the hull and the rings needed to compress under pressure in perfect harmony. “I can’t imagine a situation where you could reuse the titanium rings,” Wright, the independent engineer, says. OceanGate somehow managed it.</p><p>By February 2021, photos of the newly reconstructed <em>Titan</em> were popping up on OceanGate’s Facebook page and other social media. After the implosion in 2023, one ex-employee looked back at these and noticed an unexpected addition: The company had added metal lifting points to both interface rings, apparently to provide a new way to hoist <em>Titan</em> into and out of the water. The addition of the lifting rings, reported by WIRED for the first time, was confirmed by a former employee who saw the engineering drawings, and by another source.</p><p>Previously, OceanGate had lifted <em>Titan</em> using a sling beneath the sub to avoid putting stress on the critical joins between the rings and the carbon-fiber hull. As far back as 2017, when the original <em>Titan</em> was first shipped to OceanGate, Nissen had warned the operations team to use only the sling: “The titanium cannot take load/tension.”</p><p>“Lifting points are a very serious part of a pressure vessel design and must be considered carefully, tested, and qualified,” says Will Kohnen. “Any lifting arrangement may impose loads and stresses into the pressure vessel, and this must be mitigated by analysis and test.” It is unclear whether such analysis or tests were carried out.</p><figure><p><span><p>OceanGate originally used a sling system to lower its sub into the water, shown here.</p>
</span><span>Photograph: Courtesy of a former OceanGate employee</span></p></figure><p>The diving season was about to begin, and after three years of expensive delays, OceanGate desperately needed income from the <em>Titanic</em> missions (whose tickets now cost $125,000 per person). “We were running out of time,” says a former OceanGate employee. <em>Titan</em> had only a few relatively shallow dives in Puget Sound before the company put it on a truck and sent it all the way across Canada to Newfoundland, the port closest to the <em>Titanic</em> wreck.</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>On July 13, 2021, OceanGate’s <em>Titan</em> made its first successful dive to the <em>Titanic</em>, with Rush serving as the pilot. “We had to overcome tremendous engineering, operational, business, and finally Covid-19 challenges to get here, and I am so proud of this team and grateful for the support of our many partners,” Rush said in a <a data-offer-url="https://www.prweb.com/releases/oceangate_inc_s_carbon_fiber_and_titanium_5_crewmember_submersible_dives_3800_meters_to_the_titanic_wreck_site/prweb18066066.htm" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.prweb.com/releases/oceangate_inc_s_carbon_fiber_and_titanium_5_crewmember_submersible_dives_3800_meters_to_the_titanic_wreck_site/prweb18066066.htm&quot;}" href="https://www.prweb.com/releases/oceangate_inc_s_carbon_fiber_and_titanium_5_crewmember_submersible_dives_3800_meters_to_the_titanic_wreck_site/prweb18066066.htm" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">press release</a>.</p><p>After the 2021 expedition, OceanGate was flush with success. The company announced plans for the following year’s expedition to document the wreck “in more detail than ever before” and urging “aspiring mission specialists” to get in touch.</p><p>The successes and warm media coverage continued in 2022. OceanGate was profiled by <em>CBS Sunday Morning</em>, which accompanied one of the missions that summer. When reporter David Pogue noticed how improvised the setup on the sub was, Rush reassured him. “The pressure vessel is not MacGyver at all, because that’s where we worked with Boeing and NASA and the University of Washington. Everything else can fail, your thrusters can go, your lights can go. You’re still going to be safe.” The rest of Pogue’s mission was sort of a farce—the sub got lost, things broke—but he came back safely.</p><p>That’s not what happened the following year. In June 2023, five eager people got ready to dive back down to the <em>Titanic</em>. They were Rush; Paul-Henri Nargeolet, a deep-sea explorer; and three paying passengers: a businessman named Hamish Harding and a father-son duo, Shahzada and Suleman Dawood. On June 18, they sealed <em>Titan</em> and dove. Within two hours, the support ship had lost contact with them.</p><p>Their disappearance set off a media frenzy. People speculated how long the crew might be able survive without power or aid. A massive search-and-rescue operation spent four days combing the sea before finding debris from the sub. The US Navy later confirmed it had detected loud sounds “consistent with an implosion” shortly after contact with <em>Titan</em> ended. OceanGate ceased its commercial and exploration activities a few weeks later.</p><p>The US Coast Guard is currently leading an international investigation into the deaths.</p><p>Several former employees said they were neither shocked nor surprised at OceanGate’s deadly accident. Three had left the company on safety grounds, and two separately described <em>Titan</em> as a ticking time bomb.</p><p>One former employee remembers preparing <em>Titan</em> for multiple successful <em>Titanic</em> missions, prior to 2023. “I put my heart and soul into building that sub,” he says. “Many, many hours inside the sub, outside the sub, building and testing it. She was my baby.”</p><p>Each time <em>Titan</em> was about to dip beneath the waves, he would pat her hull lightly. “I’d say, ‘Come on back to me baby, you’ll make it, you can do it.’ And when she’d come back up to the surface, I’d say, ‘Good job. You got everyone back up safe.’”</p><p>Until one day, she didn’t.</p><p>Now the bottom of the North Atlantic is littered with more evidence of human hubris, tiny pieces of a plastic video-game controller nestling among the barnacle-encrusted gold fixtures of the <em>Titanic</em>. Both vessels were at the cutting edge of technology, both exemplars of safety in the eyes of their overconfident creators. And in both cases, their passengers paid the price.</p></div></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <p>On the morning of April 3, Taiwan was hit by a 7.4 magnitude earthquake. Seconds later, hundreds of battery-swap stations in Taiwan sensed something else: the power frequency of the electric grid took a sudden drop, a signal that some power plants had been disconnected in the disaster. The grid was now struggling to meet energy demand.&nbsp;</p>  <p>These stations, built by the Taiwanese company Gogoro for electric-powered two-wheeled vehicles like scooters, mopeds, and bikes, reacted immediately. According to numbers provided by the company, 590 Gogoro battery-swap locations (some of which have more than one swap station) stopped drawing electricity from the grid, lowering local demand by a total six megawatts—enough to power thousands of homes. It took 12 minutes for the grid to recover, and the battery-swap stations then resumed normal operation.</p> </div><div> <p>Gogoro is not the only company working on battery-swapping for electric scooters (New York City <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2024/03/20/1089960/battery-swap-ebike-fires/">recently launched a pilot program</a> to give delivery drivers the option to charge this way), but it’s certainly one of the most successful. Founded in 2011, the firm has a network of over 12,500 stations across Taiwan and boasts over 600,000 monthly subscribers who pay to swap batteries in and out when required. Each station is roughly the size of two vending machines and can hold around 30 scooter batteries.</p>  <p>Now the company is putting the battery network to another use: Gogoro has been working with Enel X, an Italian company, to incorporate the stations into <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2024/02/07/1087836/how-virtual-power-plants-are-shaping-tomorrows-energy-system/">a virtual power plant (VPP) system that helps the Taiwanese grid stay more resilient in emergencies</a> like April’s earthquake.&nbsp;</p> 
 <p>Battery-swap stations work well for VPP programs because they offer so much more flexibility than charging at home, where an electric-bike owner usually has just one or two batteries and thus must charge immediately after one runs out. With dozens of batteries in a single station as a demand buffer, Gogoro can choose when it charges them—for instance, doing so at night when there’s less power demand and it’s cheaper. In the meantime, the batteries can give power back to the grid when it is stressed—hence the comparison to power plants.</p>  <p>“What is beautiful is that the stations’ economic interest is aligned with the grid—the [battery-swap companies] have the incentive to time their charges during the low utilization period, paying the low electricity price, while feeding electricity back to the grid during peak period, enjoying a higher price,” says S. Alex Yang, a professor of management science at London Business School.&nbsp;</p> 
 <p>Gogoro is uniquely positioned to become a vital part of the VPP network because “there’s a constant load in energy, and then at the same time, we’re on standby that we can either stop taking or giving back [power] to the grid to provide stability,” Horace Luke, cofounder and CEO of Gogoro, tells <em>MIT Technology Review</em>.&nbsp;</p>  <p>Luke estimates that only 10% of Gogoro batteries are actually on the road powering scooters at any given time, so the rest, sitting on the racks waiting for customers to pick up, become a valuable resource that can be utilized by the grid.&nbsp;</p>  <p>Today, out of the 2,500 Gogoro locations, over 1,000 are part of the VPP program. Gogoro promises that the system will automatically detect emergencies and, in response, immediately lower its consumption by a certain total amount.</p>  <p>Which stations get included in the VPP depends on where they are and how much capacity they have. A smaller station right outside a metro stop—meaning high demand and low supply—probably can’t afford to stop charging during an emergency because riders could come looking for a battery soon. But a megastation with 120 batteries in a residential area is probably safe to stop charging batteries for a while.</p> </div><div><p>Plus, the entire station doesn’t go dark—Gogoro has a built-in system that decides which or how many batteries in a station stop charging. “We know exactly which batteries to spin down, which station to spin down, how much to spin down,” says Luke. “That was all calculated in real time in the back side of the server.” It can even consolidate the power left in several batteries into one, so a customer who comes in can still leave with a fully charged battery even if the whole system is operating below capacity.</p>  <p>The earthquake and its aftermath in Taiwan this year put the VPP stations to the test—but also showed the system’s strength. On April 15, 12 days after the initial earthquake, the grid in Taiwan was still recovering from the damage when another power drop happened. This time, 818 Gogoro locations reacted in five seconds, reducing power consumption by 11 megawatts for 30 minutes.</p>  <p>Numbers like 6 MW and 11 MW are “not a trivial amount of power but still substantially smaller than a centralized power plant,” says Joshua Pearce, an engineering professor at Western University in Ontario, Canada. For comparison, Taiwan lost 3,200 MW of power supply right after the April earthquake, and the gap was mostly filled by solar power, centralized battery storage, and hydropower. But the entire Taiwanese VPP network combined, <a href="https://money.udn.com/money/story/11799/7963052">which has reached a capacity of 1,350 MW</a>, can make a significant difference. “It helps the grid maintain stability during disasters. The more smart loads there are on the grid, the more resilient it is,” he says.&nbsp;</p>  <p>However, the potential of these battery-swap stations has not been fully achieved yet; the majority of the stations have not started giving energy back to the grid.&nbsp;</p> 

 <p>“The tech system is ready, but the business and economics are not ready,” Luke says. There are 10 Gogoro battery-swapping stations that can return electricity to the grid in a pilot program, but other stations haven’t received the technological update.&nbsp;</p>  <p>Upgrading stations to bi-directional charging makes economic sense only if Gogoro can profit from selling the electricity back. While the Taiwanese state-owned utility company currently allows private energy generators like solar farms to sell electricity to the grid at a premium, it hasn’t allowed battery-storage companies like Gogoro to do so.&nbsp;</p>  <p>This challenge is not unique to Taiwan. Incorporating technologies like VPP requires making fundamental changes to the grid, which won’t happen without policy support. “The technology is there, but the practices are being held back by antiquated utility business models where they provide all electric services,” says Pearce. “Fair policies are needed to allow solar energy and battery owners to participate in the electric market for the best interest of all electricity consumers.” </p></div></div>]]></description>

Jgs Font is a font family made in tribute to Joan G. Stark (aka jgs, Spunk), a
pioneer of ASCII art.

Jgs Font glyphs can be combined from one character to another, from one line to
another. Thus from single characters it is possible to draw continuous lines,
frames and patterns.

In order to change font size while keeping these effects of continuity at
pixel scale, the family is declined in three fonts.

Jgs5 for sizes multiples of 10 : 10px, 20px, 30px etc.
Jgs7 for sizes multiples of 14 : 14px, 28px, 42px etc.
Jgs9 for sizes multiples of 18: 18px, 36px, 54px etc.


Notes
-----

Jgs is still an unfinished project. Some characters are still missing
and the formal correspondences between the sizes remain to be worked.

You will find <a href="https://adelfaure.net/tools/jgs/jgs_table.html">here</a> a table of characters and comparison between fonts.

<div><p>DKBTrace (foundation of POV-Ray) creator has kickstarter for educational IDE</p></div>

<!-- NC 3 20 -->
<div><p>
David K. Buck - the creator of DKBTrace, the pioneering raytracer that was the genesis of POV-Ray - has created a <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/pigeontalk/pigeontalk-a-programming-environment-to-explore-computing">KickStarter campaign to fund creation of an open-source IDE for PigeonTalk</a> (PigeonTalk is a smalltalk implementation created by David that is aimed at being a programming environment to explore computing).
</p>

<blockquote>
"I chose Smalltalk as a language because it provides the most immersive experience I've encountered.  Smalltalk allows you to create, use, and explore software in a very hands-on way.  It's an ideal environment for learning and playing with software.
This Kickstarter project is to provide a development environment for this Smalltalk which I'm calling PigeonTalk.  The development environment would run in a web browser and would communicate with the Smalltalk engine using WebSockets.  Once this is available, PigeonTalk becomes a viable programming environment that others could use."
</blockquote>

<p>
We wish David the best in this endeavor and are hopeful the Kickstarter will meet its goal as POV-Ray itself would not exist if it were not for David's kind contribution of the DKBTrace source code.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>   <p>If you know me, you’d probably say, “Omg Chris, yet another new language???!!!“.
The truth is, this is the only way I found to keep my motivation as a software
engineer. A new language means a new way of both building and thinking. I’m
trying to stay open-minded when it comes to my craft. I’ll just get the best out
of this new experience and move on. In this article, I’m going to talk about
Gleam, how I found it, and why I’m already LOVING it.</p>
<p><img src="https://christopher.engineering/_astro/gleam-banner.CSmos0T3_Z2gg4CB.webp" alt="Pink star representing Gleam's logo, followed by the label 'Gleam'" width="1200" height="630" loading="lazy" decoding="async"></p><h2 id="how-i-heard-about-gleam">How I heard about Gleam?</h2>
<p>Gleam V1 launched on March 4th 2024. As a
<a href="https://youtu.be/0sxXyLJe2N8?si=0ExH3E5ViqdEGlMM&amp;t=12">built different engineer</a>,
I found out about it back in November 2023, when I started being seriously
interested in Elixir.</p>
<p>The thing that always kind of put me off regarding Elixir was the dynamic
typing. I’m a static typing person; it solves a LOT of common issues in my
day-to-day job and provides cool benefits like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Less runtime errors, since the compiler YELLS at you when something is wrong
about your code structure.</li>
<li>Trust in what goes to production, since it was approved by the boss (the
compiler).</li>
<li>Code with typing indications is often (not always, but still, often) clearer
and easier to understand. If the documentation is incomplete or non-existent,
you still have something to go by, and new engineers can start contributing
faster.</li>
<li>Coding by thinking about the data structure FIRST, and then, the
implementation matches my thinking process.</li>
</ul>
<p>Anyway, you get it, I a type-sexual.</p>
<p>So, one day, I was googling “Static typing elixir”, and I saw
<a href="https://gleam.run/">Gleam</a> in the results. What did I do? I just ignored the
thing and moved on.</p>
<p><strong>WHY ?</strong></p>
<p>Because I’m more mature than ever. Like look, I did my due diligence on Gleam:
adoption, use cases, versions (it was on v0.something), and I wasn’t impressed.
I thought that Gleam was super early, a cool gimmick, an experimental toy, but
it stayed somewhere in my brain, in the box where I put the stuff I might get
into, but not RIGHT NOW.</p>
<p><img src="https://christopher.engineering/_astro/things-to-learn.CBPM5iSX_ng9Ue.webp" alt="Drawing representing the things I want to keep an eye on vs the things that are requiring my immediate attention, Gleam falls into the things I want to keep an eye on category" width="2943" height="1206" loading="lazy" decoding="async"></p><h2 id="what-gleam-brings-to-the-table">What Gleam brings to the table</h2>
<p>Fast forward, it’s March 1st, 2024:
<a href="https://gleam.run/news/gleam-version-1/">Gleam is officially on V1</a>. I read the
changelog, I get the SDK to play with the language and folks… the vibes are
IMMACULATE. I’m starting to regret the time I had the occasion to be involved
super early (I know it’s dumb), but as they (idk who’s “they”) said, better late
than never.</p>
<p>I’ll go through the features I love the most and tell you what I like, and what
can be better.</p>
<h3 id="types-and-structures">Types and structures</h3>
<p>I think it’s BEAUTIFUL, like:</p>
<pre tabindex="0" data-language="gleam"><code><span><span>type</span><span> Vehicle</span><span> {</span></span>
<span><span>  Car</span><span>(</span><span>make: </span><span>String</span><span>, </span><span>brand: </span><span>String</span><span>)</span></span>
<span><span>  Skateboard</span><span>(</span><span>brand: </span><span>String</span><span>)</span></span>
<span><span>  Spaceship</span><span>(</span><span>year: </span><span>Int</span><span>)</span></span>
<span><span>}</span></span>
<span></span></code></pre>
<p>What you’re seeing here is a Gleam <code>custom type</code> or <code>Record</code>, with <code>Vehicle</code>
being the type’s name, <code>Car</code>, <code>Skateboard</code>, and <code>Spaceship</code> being the
constructors available for this type. This is basically a tagged union, or if
you prefer, some sort of enumeration, where each member gets its own set of
attributes. It’s being used like:</p>
<pre tabindex="0" data-language="gleam"><code><span><span>let</span><span> my_car </span><span>=</span><span> Car</span><span>(</span><span>"Honda"</span><span>, </span><span>"Civic"</span><span>)</span></span>
<span></span></code></pre>
<p>and it allows pretty cool structures, like this cute pattern matching:</p>
<pre tabindex="0" data-language="gleam"><code><span><span>fn</span><span> get_driving_requirements</span><span>(</span><span>vehicule: </span><span>Vehicle</span><span>) </span><span>-&gt;</span><span> String</span><span> {</span></span>
<span><span>  case</span><span> vehicule {</span></span>
<span><span>    Car</span><span>(make, brand) </span><span>-&gt;</span></span>
<span><span>      "To drive the car "</span></span>
<span><span>      &lt;&gt;</span><span> make</span></span>
<span><span>      &lt;&gt;</span><span> " "</span></span>
<span><span>      &lt;&gt;</span><span> brand</span></span>
<span><span>      &lt;&gt;</span><span> ", your need a driver licence."</span></span>
<span><span>    Skateboard</span><span>(brand) </span><span>-&gt;</span><span> "Anybody can ride a "</span><span> &lt;&gt;</span><span> brand </span><span>&lt;&gt;</span><span> " skateboard!"</span></span>
<span><span>    Spaceship</span><span>(</span><span>_</span><span>) </span><span>-&gt;</span><span> "You need to be a NASA astronaut for that!"</span></span>
<span><span>  }</span></span>
<span><span>}</span></span>
<span></span></code></pre>
<p>Let’s spend some time on the function above:</p>
<ol>
<li><code>get_driving_requirements</code> takes only one <code>Vehicle</code> type argument and returns
a <code>String</code>. Both Gleam’s compiler and LSP will let you know if any of those
conditions are not respected. Specifying what a function returns in Gleam is
optional; due to type inference, Gleam will understand it anyway.</li>
<li>In the function’s body, you can see the <code>case</code> structure. This is how you
perform pattern matching, which is essentially a switch control on steroids.
Using a <code>case</code>, you can execute code path if a specific pattern is matched
for a given variable. It’s pretty crazy how deeply you leverage this
technique. In my example, I check every possible constructor for the
<code>vehicle</code> variable. Once again, the tooling will alert you if your pattern
matching is not exhaustive (safety first!).</li>
</ol>
<p>It’s super expressive, the code is concise and elegant (to me).</p>
<h3 id="gleams-tooling">Gleam’s tooling…</h3>
<p>…is CRAZY. Like, crazy CRAZY. I spent so much time in the cursed lands of
Javascript that I forgot grass could be THIS green elsewhere. The only thing you
need to do it to install the <code>gleam</code> CLI. To do so, I used
<a href="https://asdf-vm.com/">asdf</a>, but you can do the same using any other package
manager like Homebrew. What does the <code>gleam</code> command do? Check this out:</p>

</ul>
<p>All you need to get started with Gleam is already in this CLI. You dont’t have
ANYTHING else check, there’s ZERO decision paralysis: THIS-IS-WHAT-WE-WANT.
Javascript makes you pick a tool among hundred of options, for each tool
provided in Gleam’s CLI.</p>
<p>One more thing: each language version comes bundled with its own set of tools;
to prevent tooling incompabilities.</p>
<p>Let’s reuse the previous example:</p>
<pre tabindex="0" data-language="gleam"><code><span><span>import</span><span> gleam</span><span>/</span><span>io</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>/// This is some type related to type Vehicle</span></span>

<span><span>  io.</span><span>println</span><span>(</span><span>"Hello from gl_playground!"</span><span>)</span></span>
<span><span>}</span></span>
<span></span></code></pre>
<p>When I hover my mouse <code>vehcule</code> in my function body, I’m seeing:</p>
<p><img src="https://christopher.engineering/_astro/lsp-example-1.DnMdKRE2_zvw3v.webp" alt="Screenshot showing when you hover on vehicule, your texte editor show your types and documentation thanks to the LSP." width="1694" height="450" loading="lazy" decoding="async"></p><p>LSP is capable of getting both type and documentation related to the variable.
Another exemple if, what happens when I hover on the <code>Car</code> constructor:</p>
<p><img src="https://christopher.engineering/_astro/lsp-example-2.DRJwV_aI_Z1lhYEl.webp" alt="Screenshot showing when you hover on Car, the LSP shows the custom type name and the constructor's documentation" width="1432" height="410" loading="lazy" decoding="async"></p><p>Here, the LSP shows both the parent custom type’name and the associated
documentation.</p>
<p>One last example, when I hover on <code>brand</code>, for the code block executed when
<code>Skateboard</code> is matched:</p>
<p><img src="https://christopher.engineering/_astro/lsp-example-3.DTLffvNX_Z1iSOR0.webp" alt="Screenshot showing that when your hover on brand, it shows the variable type" width="1790" height="980" loading="lazy" decoding="async"></p><p>The LSP understands that <code>brand</code> is the first attribute in <code>Skateboard</code>.</p>
<p>This is the attention to details that makes you love an ecosystem. It helps you
ship quality code, and it drives the language adoption up: this is a true
win-win situation.</p>
<h3 id="otp-implementation">OTP implementation</h3>
<p>Earlier, I told you that Gleam runs on the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BEAM_(Erlang_virtual_machine)">BEAM</a> (never
said that tbh). BEAM means Erlang, and Erlang means OTP. Please, sit down and
relax, cuz I’m about to try to tell you what OTP is about.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>OTP (Open Telecom Platform) is an architecture (and some kind of philosophy)
for building fault-tolerant and highly concurrent software. The key principle
is to divide a program into small execution units called <em>processes</em>
(unrelated to OS processes) and making those processes communicate through
message passing. Those processes can die at any time for any reason, so OTP
advise you to put them under a supervision tree, so that a supervisor (which
is also a process) can restart them. Erlang and Elixir give the developer the
abstractions needed to build on top of OTP, with the BEAM allowing you to run
MILLIONS of processes, even on a tiny server.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="https://christopher.engineering/_astro/big-brain-opt-meme.DmwjBMXb_Z1Wneqo.webp" alt="Big brain meme with 'Me when I explain OTP' as a legend" width="568" height="500" loading="lazy" decoding="async"></p><p>Dang, I really gave my everything on this one, but now you kind of know what OTP
is. That being said, Gleam also has its own OTP primitives, using an
<a href="https://github.com/gleam-lang/otp">external official package</a>. The abstraction
I used the most is the <code>actor</code> (btw, you should learn about the actor model;
this thing is CRAZY). Let me show you how this works:</p>
<pre tabindex="0" data-language="gleam"><code><span><span>import</span><span> gleam</span><span>/</span><span>io</span></span>
<span><span>import</span><span> gleam</span><span>/</span><span>int</span></span>

<span><span>import</span><span> gleam</span><span>/</span><span>otp</span><span>/</span><span>actor</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>type</span><span> AsyncTaskMessage</span><span> {</span></span>
<span><span>  Increment</span><span>(</span><span>reply_to: </span><span>Subject</span><span>(</span><span>Int</span><span>))</span></span>
<span><span>  Decrement</span><span>(</span><span>reply_to: </span><span>Subject</span><span>(</span><span>Int</span><span>))</span></span>
<span><span>}</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>fn</span><span> handle_async_task</span><span>(</span><span>message: </span><span>AsyncTaskMessage</span><span>, </span><span>state: </span><span>Int</span><span>) {</span></span>
<span><span>  case</span><span> message {</span></span>
<span><span>    Increment</span><span>(client) </span><span>-&gt;</span><span> {</span></span>
<span><span>      let</span><span> new_value </span><span>=</span><span> state </span><span>+</span><span> 1</span></span>
<span><span>      process.</span><span>send</span><span>(client, new_value)</span></span>

<span><span>    }</span></span>
<span><span>    Decrement</span><span>(client) </span><span>-&gt;</span><span> {</span></span>

<span><span>      process.</span><span>send</span><span>(client, new_value)</span></span>
<span><span>      actor.</span><span>continue</span><span>(new_value)</span></span>

<span><span>}</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>fn</span><span> start_async_task</span><span>(</span><span>state: </span><span>Int</span><span>) {</span></span>
<span><span>  actor.</span><span>start</span><span>(state, handle_async_task)</span></span>
<span><span>}</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>fn</span><span> main</span><span>() {</span></span>
<span><span>  let</span><span> assert</span><span> Ok</span><span>(actor) </span><span>=</span><span> start_async_task</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>)</span></span>
<span><span>  let</span><span> response </span><span>=</span><span> actor.</span><span>call</span><span>(actor, </span><span>fn</span><span>(subject) { </span><span>Increment</span><span>(subject) }, </span><span>10_000</span><span>)</span></span>
<span><span>  io.</span><span>println</span><span>(</span><span>"New value: "</span><span> &lt;&gt;</span><span> int.</span><span>to_string</span><span>(response))</span></span>
<span><span>}</span></span>
<span></span></code></pre>
<p>For a Gleam actor, you need a few things:</p>
<ol>
<li>A custom type for all kind of messages your actor can receive. It’s called
<code>AsyncTaskMessage</code> in this example.</li>
<li>A function which takes a message and a state (the state being whatever you’d
like) and returns a new state, or something indicating that the task should
end. This is <code>handle_async_task</code> in our example.</li>
<li>A function starting everything. In our example this is the <code>start_async</code>
function.</li>
</ol>
<p>With all of these pieces, you get a new stateful process that can live on its
own. You can send messages for it to do… stuffs, I guess. Yeah, I know the
demo is kind of lame, BUT it shows you how powerful Gleam’s type system is when
coupled with OTP. You cannot send any message to your process that isn’t
type-checked <strong>AT COMPILE TIME</strong>!</p>
<p>Something less cool, is the fact that OTP isn’t fully ported to Gleam. Few
features, like
<a href="https://medium.com/@StevenLeiva1/elixir-process-registries-a27f813d94e3">Registries</a>
are missing…</p>
<h3 id="lustre-a-curious-web-framework">Lustre, a curious web framework</h3>
<p><strong>YEAH, I KNOW</strong>, another new web framework. You have to understand, a new
language needs that kind of popular tooling. Some people (web devs) are waiting
for it. <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/lustre/4.2.4/">Lustre</a> is a Gleam web framework.
It’s been around in Gleam ecosystem for a long time and I think, is mature in
Gleam’s context.</p>
<p>I didn’t tried it yet, (it should be one of my next article), but we’re talking
about a tech with a lot of cool features:</p>
<ul>
<li>It’s isomorphic, it’s running on both backend and frontend.</li>
<li>It’s heavily inspired from <a href="https://elm-lang.org/">Elm</a>, this scary thing we
got from weed smoking Haskell geniuses (this is a compliment, huge respect for
them).</li>
<li>It’s opinionated, from an app to another, you supposed to see the same
conventions and code structure.</li>
</ul>
<p>I’ll let you check <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/lustre/4.2.4/">the documentation</a> and see
if it’s something that you’d be interrested in.</p>
<h3 id="javascript-interoperability">Javascript, interoperability</h3>
<p><img src="https://christopher.engineering/_astro/gleam-js.BZ_mi_eg_PHtwa.svg" alt="Edit show both Gleam's and Javascript logo" width="2105" height="2016" loading="lazy" decoding="async"></p><p>I JUST TOLD YOU!!! Gleam has a web framework and it’s ISOMORPHIC. How does it
run on web? It runs because Gleam can transpile to Javascript. This is an
interesting strategy. They are trying to convince the easiest crowd: Javascript
developers. Those people (me, I’m “these people”) are tired of Typescript /
Javascript nonsense. They’re looking for simplicity, robustness and Gleam has
all the tool they need for that. There’s few players in this space, like
<a href="https://reasonml.github.io/">ReasonML</a> and
<a href="https://rescript-lang.org/">ReScript</a>.</p>

<p dir="auto">The simplest, fastest repository for training/finetuning medium-sized GPTs. It is a rewrite of <a href="https://github.com/karpathy/minGPT">minGPT</a> that prioritizes teeth over education. Still under active development, but currently the file <code>train.py</code> reproduces GPT-2 (124M) on OpenWebText, running on a single 8XA100 40GB node in about 4 days of training. The code itself is plain and readable: <code>train.py</code> is a ~300-line boilerplate training loop and <code>model.py</code> a ~300-line GPT model definition, which can optionally load the GPT-2 weights from OpenAI. That's it.</p>

<p dir="auto">Because the code is so simple, it is very easy to hack to your needs, train new models from scratch, or finetune pretrained checkpoints (e.g. biggest one currently available as a starting point would be the GPT-2 1.3B model from OpenAI).</p>

<p dir="auto">If you are not a deep learning professional and you just want to feel the magic and get your feet wet, the fastest way to get started is to train a character-level GPT on the works of Shakespeare. First, we download it as a single (1MB) file and turn it from raw text into one large stream of integers:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="python data/shakespeare_char/prepare.py"><pre>python data/shakespeare_char/prepare.py</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">This creates a <code>train.bin</code> and <code>val.bin</code> in that data directory. Now it is time to train your GPT. The size of it very much depends on the computational resources of your system:</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>I have a GPU</strong>. Great, we can quickly train a baby GPT with the settings provided in the <a href="https://github.com/karpathy/nanoGPT/blob/master/config/train_shakespeare_char.py">config/train_shakespeare_char.py</a> config file:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="python train.py config/train_shakespeare_char.py"><pre>python train.py config/train_shakespeare_char.py</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">If you peek inside it, you'll see that we're training a GPT with a context size of up to 256 characters, 384 feature channels, and it is a 6-layer Transformer with 6 heads in each layer. On one A100 GPU this training run takes about 3 minutes and the best validation loss is 1.4697. Based on the configuration, the model checkpoints are being written into the <code>--out_dir</code> directory <code>out-shakespeare-char</code>. So once the training finishes we can sample from the best model by pointing the sampling script at this directory:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="python sample.py --out_dir=out-shakespeare-char"><pre>python sample.py --out_dir=out-shakespeare-char</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">This generates a few samples, for example:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="ANGELO:

<p dir="auto">lol  <code>¯\_(ツ)_/¯</code>. Not bad for a character-level model after 3 minutes of training on a GPU. Better results are quite likely obtainable by instead finetuning a pretrained GPT-2 model on this dataset (see finetuning section later).</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>I only have a macbook</strong> (or other cheap computer). No worries, we can still train a GPT but we want to dial things down a notch. I recommend getting the bleeding edge PyTorch nightly (<a href="https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/" rel="nofollow">select it here</a> when installing) as it is currently quite likely to make your code more efficient. But even without it, a simple train run could look as follows:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="python train.py config/train_shakespeare_char.py --device=cpu --compile=False --eval_iters=20 --log_interval=1 --block_size=64 --batch_size=12 --n_layer=4 --n_head=4 --n_embd=128 --max_iters=2000 --lr_decay_iters=2000 --dropout=0.0"><pre>python train.py config/train_shakespeare_char.py --device=cpu --compile=False --eval_iters=20 --log_interval=1 --block_size=64 --batch_size=12 --n_layer=4 --n_head=4 --n_embd=128 --max_iters=2000 --lr_decay_iters=2000 --dropout=0.0</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Here, since we are running on CPU instead of GPU we must set both <code>--device=cpu</code> and also turn off PyTorch 2.0 compile with <code>--compile=False</code>. Then when we evaluate we get a bit more noisy but faster estimate (<code>--eval_iters=20</code>, down from 200), our context size is only 64 characters instead of 256, and the batch size only 12 examples per iteration, not 64. We'll also use a much smaller Transformer (4 layers, 4 heads, 128 embedding size), and decrease the number of iterations to 2000 (and correspondingly usually decay the learning rate to around max_iters with <code>--lr_decay_iters</code>). Because our network is so small we also ease down on regularization (<code>--dropout=0.0</code>). This still runs in about ~3 minutes, but gets us a loss of only 1.88 and therefore also worse samples, but it's still good fun:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="python sample.py --out_dir=out-shakespeare-char --device=cpu"><pre>python sample.py --out_dir=out-shakespeare-char --device=cpu</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Generates samples like this:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="GLEORKEN VINGHARD III:

And the for mought you in Aut fries the not high shee

And the for mought you in Aut fries the not high shee
bot thou the sought bechive in that to doth groan you,

</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Not bad for ~3 minutes on a CPU, for a hint of the right character gestalt. If you're willing to wait longer, feel free to tune the hyperparameters, increase the size of the network, the context length (<code>--block_size</code>), the length of training, etc.</p>
<p dir="auto">Finally, on Apple Silicon Macbooks and with a recent PyTorch version make sure to add <code>--device=mps</code> (short for "Metal Performance Shaders"); PyTorch then uses the on-chip GPU that can <em>significantly</em> accelerate training (2-3X) and allow you to use larger networks. See <a href="https://github.com/karpathy/nanoGPT/issues/28" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/karpathy/nanoGPT/issues/28/hovercard">Issue 28</a> for more.</p>

<p dir="auto">A more serious deep learning professional may be more interested in reproducing GPT-2 results. So here we go - we first tokenize the dataset, in this case the <a href="https://openwebtext2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/" rel="nofollow">OpenWebText</a>, an open reproduction of OpenAI's (private) WebText:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="python data/openwebtext/prepare.py"><pre>python data/openwebtext/prepare.py</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">This downloads and tokenizes the <a href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/openwebtext" rel="nofollow">OpenWebText</a> dataset. It will create a <code>train.bin</code> and <code>val.bin</code> which holds the GPT2 BPE token ids in one sequence, stored as raw uint16 bytes. Then we're ready to kick off training. To reproduce GPT-2 (124M) you'll want at least an 8X A100 40GB node and run:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="torchrun --standalone --nproc_per_node=8 train.py config/train_gpt2.py"><pre>torchrun --standalone --nproc_per_node=8 train.py config/train_gpt2.py</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">This will run for about 4 days using PyTorch Distributed Data Parallel (DDP) and go down to loss of ~2.85. Now, a GPT-2 model just evaluated on OWT gets a val loss of about 3.11, but if you finetune it it will come down to ~2.85 territory (due to an apparent domain gap), making the two models ~match.</p>
<p dir="auto">If you're in a cluster environment and you are blessed with multiple GPU nodes you can make GPU go brrrr e.g. across 2 nodes like:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="# Run on the first (master) node with example IP 123.456.123.456:
torchrun --nproc_per_node=8 --nnodes=2 --node_rank=0 --master_addr=123.456.123.456 --master_port=1234 train.py
# Run on the worker node:
torchrun --nproc_per_node=8 --nnodes=2 --node_rank=1 --master_addr=123.456.123.456 --master_port=1234 train.py"><pre><span><span>#</span> Run on the first (master) node with example IP 123.456.123.456:</span>
torchrun --nproc_per_node=8 --nnodes=2 --node_rank=0 --master_addr=123.456.123.456 --master_port=1234 train.py
<span><span>#</span> Run on the worker node:</span>
torchrun --nproc_per_node=8 --nnodes=2 --node_rank=1 --master_addr=123.456.123.456 --master_port=1234 train.py</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">It is a good idea to benchmark your interconnect (e.g. iperf3). In particular, if you don't have Infiniband then also prepend <code>NCCL_IB_DISABLE=1</code> to the above launches. Your multinode training will work, but most likely <em>crawl</em>. By default checkpoints are periodically written to the <code>--out_dir</code>. We can sample from the model by simply <code>python sample.py</code>.</p>
<p dir="auto">Finally, to train on a single GPU simply run the <code>python train.py</code> script. Have a look at all of its args, the script tries to be very readable, hackable and transparent. You'll most likely want to tune a number of those variables depending on your needs.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">baselines</h2><a id="user-content-baselines" aria-label="Permalink: baselines" href="#baselines"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">OpenAI GPT-2 checkpoints allow us to get some baselines in place for openwebtext. We can get the numbers as follows:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="$ python train.py config/eval_gpt2.py
$ python train.py config/eval_gpt2_medium.py
$ python train.py config/eval_gpt2_large.py
$ python train.py config/eval_gpt2_xl.py"><pre>$ python train.py config/eval_gpt2.py
$ python train.py config/eval_gpt2_medium.py
$ python train.py config/eval_gpt2_large.py
$ python train.py config/eval_gpt2_xl.py</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">and observe the following losses on train and val:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>model</th>
<th>params</th>
<th>train loss</th>
<th>val loss</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>gpt2</td>
<td>124M</td>
<td>3.11</td>
<td>3.12</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>gpt2-medium</td>
<td>350M</td>
<td>2.85</td>
<td>2.84</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>gpt2-large</td>
<td>774M</td>

<td>2.67</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>gpt2-xl</td>
<td>1558M</td>
<td>2.56</td>
<td>2.54</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p dir="auto">However, we have to note that GPT-2 was trained on (closed, never released) WebText, while OpenWebText is just a best-effort open reproduction of this dataset. This means there is a dataset domain gap. Indeed, taking the GPT-2 (124M) checkpoint and finetuning on OWT directly for a while reaches loss down to ~2.85. This then becomes the more appropriate baseline w.r.t. reproduction.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">finetuning</h2><a id="user-content-finetuning" aria-label="Permalink: finetuning" href="#finetuning"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Finetuning is no different than training, we just make sure to initialize from a pretrained model and train with a smaller learning rate. For an example of how to finetune a GPT on new text go to <code>data/shakespeare</code> and run <code>prepare.py</code> to download the tiny shakespeare dataset and render it into a <code>train.bin</code> and <code>val.bin</code>, using the OpenAI BPE tokenizer from GPT-2. Unlike OpenWebText this will run in seconds. Finetuning can take very little time, e.g. on a single GPU just a few minutes. Run an example finetuning like:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="python train.py config/finetune_shakespeare.py"><pre>python train.py config/finetune_shakespeare.py</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">This will load the config parameter overrides in <code>config/finetune_shakespeare.py</code> (I didn't tune them much though). Basically, we initialize from a GPT2 checkpoint with <code>init_from</code> and train as normal, except shorter and with a small learning rate. If you're running out of memory try decreasing the model size (they are <code>{'gpt2', 'gpt2-medium', 'gpt2-large', 'gpt2-xl'}</code>) or possibly decreasing the <code>block_size</code> (context length). The best checkpoint (lowest validation loss) will be in the <code>out_dir</code> directory, e.g. in <code>out-shakespeare</code> by default, per the config file. You can then run the code in <code>sample.py --out_dir=out-shakespeare</code>:</p>

<p dir="auto">If you'd like to sample from a model you trained, use the <code>--out_dir</code> to point the code appropriately. You can also prompt the model with some text from a file, e.g. <code>python sample.py --start=FILE:prompt.txt</code>.</p>

<p dir="auto">For simple model benchmarking and profiling, <code>bench.py</code> might be useful. It's identical to what happens in the meat of the training loop of <code>train.py</code>, but omits much of the other complexities.</p>
<p dir="auto">Note that the code by default uses <a href="https://pytorch.org/get-started/pytorch-2.0/" rel="nofollow">PyTorch 2.0</a>. At the time of writing (Dec 29, 2022) this makes <code>torch.compile()</code> available in the nightly release. The improvement from the one line of code is noticeable, e.g. cutting down iteration time from ~250ms / iter to 135ms / iter. Nice work PyTorch team!</p>

<ul dir="auto">
<li>Investigate and add FSDP instead of DDP</li>
<li>Eval zero-shot perplexities on standard evals (e.g. LAMBADA? HELM? etc.)</li>
<li>Finetune the finetuning script, I think the hyperparams are not great</li>
<li>Schedule for linear batch size increase during training</li>
<li>Incorporate other embeddings (rotary, alibi)</li>
<li>Separate out the optim buffers from model params in checkpoints I think</li>
<li>Additional logging around network health (e.g. gradient clip events, magnitudes)</li>
<li>Few more investigations around better init etc.</li>
</ul>

<p dir="auto">Note that by default this repo uses PyTorch 2.0 (i.e. <code>torch.compile</code>). This is fairly new and experimental, and not yet available on all platforms (e.g. Windows). If you're running into related error messages try to disable this by adding <code>--compile=False</code> flag. This will slow down the code but at least it will run.</p>
