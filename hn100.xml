<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">About</h2><a id="user-content-about" aria-label="Permalink: About" href="#about"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Winamp is a multimedia player launched in 1997, iconic for its flexibility and wide compatibility with audio formats. Originally developed by Nullsoft, it gained massive popularity with still millions of users. Its development slowed down, but now, its source code was opened to the community, allowing developers to improve and modernize the playerto meet current user needs.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Usage</h2><a id="user-content-usage" aria-label="Permalink: Usage" href="#usage"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Building of the Winamp desktop client is current based around Visual Studio 2019 (VS2019) and Intel IPP libs (You need to use exactly v6.1.1.035).
There are different options of how to build Winamp:</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>Use a build_winampAll_2019.cmd script file that makes 4 versions x86/x64 (Debug and Release). In this case Visual Studio IDE not running.</li>
<li>Use a winampAll_2019.sln file to build and debug in Visual Studio IDE.</li>

<p><a href="https://9to5mac.com/guides/halide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Halide</a> may have been featured during the <a href="https://9to5mac.com/guides/iphone-16/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">iPhone 16</a> keynote, but it seems that wasn’t enough to protect it from an over-zealous App Store reviewer. <a href="https://www.lux.camera/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lux</a> co-founder Ben Sandofsky shared that the latest version of Halide was rejected from <a href="https://9to5mac.com/guides/app-store/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">App Store</a> …</p>



<p>The reason? Because it seemingly wasn’t clear why a camera app needs access to the camera in order to take photos.</p>



<p>When you run Halide, the app of course requests access to the camera. Developers are required to explain why they require access to features like this, and Lux’s explanation seems reasonably clear:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The camera will be used to take photographs</p>
</blockquote>



<p>But it appears that Apple decided that wasn’t sufficiently clear, as <a href="https://mastodon.social/@sandofsky/113181384256449181" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sandofsky explained</a> on Mastodon.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The latest Halide update was rejected because, after seven years, a random reviewer decided our permission prompt wasn’t descriptive enough.</p>



<p>I don’t know how to explain why a camera app needs camera permissions.</p>
</blockquote>



<p><em><a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/2466517/app-store-review-is-still-broken.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Macworld’s</a></em> Macolope suggested clearer, if less grammatical, text:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The camera will be used to take photographs for the app that you just downloaded to take photographs for.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Halide is <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2024/09/16/halide-gets-camera-control-support-also-available-from-lock-screen/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">one of the apps to support</a> the new <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2024/09/19/familiarize-yourself-with-the-camera-control-button-before-your-iphone-16-arrives/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Camera Control button</a> on the iPhone 16.</p>

    <h3><i>Almost</i>-Rans</h3>
    <p>
        Maybe it’s the change of weather. Fall often finds me looking backward, to the past —&nbsp;and anyway it is as 
        good excuse as any as to why I have found myself peering into old hard drives trying to recover old bits and bytes from games that 
        I wrote some thirty-five years ago or so. 
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>
        Shareware games that I released all those years ago I gathered onto a disk image and posted to GitHub as 
        <a href="https://github.com/EngineersNeedArt/SoftDorothy-SharewareProjects">Soft Dorothy Software — Early Shareware Projects</a>. 
        I wrote about the sometimes extraordinary work I needed to employ in order to recover some of these in 
        <a href="https://engineersneedart.com/blog/shareware/shareware.html">a blog post</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            The disk image is the kind you can drag to a 68K or PPC Mac emulator such as <a href="https://basilisk.cebix.net/">Basilisk II</a>, 
            <a href="https://sheepshaver.cebix.net/">Sheepshaver</a> or <a href="https://www.gryphel.com/c/minivmac/">MiniVMac</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            I followed up the shareware disk image with a disk image of <a href="https://github.com/EngineersNeedArt/SoftDorothy-CasadyGreeneProjects">Casady &amp; Greene Projects</a>. 
            Casady &amp; Greene was the name of the company that published my <b>Glider 4.0</b> game back in 1991 and so the sources and build tools 
            used to create <b>Glider 4.0</b> are on that disk image.
        </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        The thing that I enjoyed the most about this trip down memory lane was rediscovering and revisiting the <i>almost-rans</i>. 
        While the paper airplane game I released is what people might know, there were plenty of game experiments that never even 
        made it beyond the <i>Hello World</i> stage —&nbsp;for various reasons. What I rediscovered on the old hard drives were many of 
        those early experiments. In trying to recover them, get them to compile again, I was reminded that there are so many 
        indefinable things that go into making a <i>good</i> game. Some of these abandoned experiments may in fact have been gems 
        in the rough had I spent a little more time trying to facet them, polish them. Or maybe not.
    </p>

        <b>AirBikes</b> would have been a futuristic racing game —&nbsp;if it had been completed.

    </figure>
    <h3>Move Fast</h3>
    <p>
        I was really excited to also find a document that I had created in 1991 or so listing the games and “creator codes” that I 
        had used in these games. <i>Creator codes</i> were like a very crude “bundle identifier” back in the pre-OS-X era of the 
        Macintosh. They were supposed to be unique from all other application creator codes. The document is interesting to me today 
        because in it I had cataloged the projects that I had worked on up to that point.
    </p>
    <p>
        What follows is the list I created containing a creator code followed by the name and then the state of the game:
    </p>
    <figure>
		<img width="524" src="https://engineersneedart.com/blog/movefast/creator_codes.jpg" alt="List of creator codes.">
	</figure>
    <p>
        Out of twenty-seven titles, five of them I released (highlighted above). What were the other applications? Quick prototypes. And these 
        represent the projects over about an eighteen-month period. <i>(At the time I created this list I was apparently “working on” 
        three titles.)</i>
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        I guess to be precise, I did release <i>UnMask</i> —&nbsp;a utility I spent ten minutes writing. I would dismiss it from the data though.
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        I was very prolific during that time —&nbsp;staying up well past midnight coding every night. I also developed a kind of 
        “shell” for the type of sprite-based games that I was experimenting with so that the cost of a new “sketch”, a prototype 
        game, was primarily paid for in <b>MacPaint</b> —&nbsp;creating the sprites, artwork. A little code for unique input methods, 
        some game mechanics or physics would also be needed. Sounds, high scores, saved games —&nbsp;these are the things we could 
        kick down the road, implement only for the deserving games.
    </p>

            Sprites from <b>AirBikes</b>.
        </figcaption>
        </figure>
    <p>
        But I was developing a methodology of prototyping ideas quickly in order to determine (quickly) if an idea had legs —&nbsp;if 
        it stuck to the wall so to speak.
    </p>
    <h3>Prototype Things</h3>
    <p>
        Games are funny things. When I consider games that I liked, the reasons the game hooked me are often nuanced. I’m not sure 
        you can just set out and <i>make</i> a good game. Serendipity seems to plays a role. Or maybe it’s just that <i>I</i> have 
        found myself unable to just conjure up a great game the first go.
    </p>
    <p>
        Want to know if a kite-fighting game would be fun? Knock out enough of the game in a few days to where you can play with the 
        physics and control of the kite. If flying the kite is too difficult to master, probably no one is going to enjoy the game. 
        On the other hand if just flying the kite is fun, even without the combat element, you’re probably on to something.
    </p>
    <figure>
        <img width="512" src="https://engineersneedart.com/blog/movefast/K-10.png" alt="Another unfinished game, K-10.">
        <figcaption>
            Another racing game, <b>K-10</b> (Kansas highway 10) never moved beyond the prototype stage.
        </figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
        Maybe you have played the arcade game, <b>Joust</b>. Even before enemies <i>rez in</i> it was fun just hitting the flap 
        button to fly —&nbsp;sometimes having to pace your flapping, sometimes flapping frenetically to climb quickly. Quite fun.
    </p>
    <p>
        I found that a simple game where a paper airplane in a cluttered house had to make use of floor vents to get lift was kind 
        of fun as well —&nbsp;even before you realize you should be making progress through the rooms and avoiding toast or whatever.
    </p>
    <p>
        But as I say, there’s only one way to find out if what you <i>thought</i> would be fun on paper is in fact fun.
    </p>
    <h3>Abandon Them</h3>
    <p>
        Some games make it out of the starting gate but then you find there’s nowhere to go with the game. In my list at the top 
        of this post I had brutally noted <b>&lt;no point&gt;</b> for some games. Like the platformer game I began, 
        <b>Thief of Baghdad</b>, where you could ride a magic carpet and leap about. That was kind of fun, but … then what?
    </p>
    <figure>
        <img width="512" src="https://engineersneedart.com/blog/movefast/Carpet.png" alt="Unfinished game, Thief of Baghdad.">
        <figcaption>
            <b>Thief of Baghdad</b> never got off the ground.
        </figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
        Consider too that I was a solitary programmer. So some games seemed to have potential but it became clear very quickly 
        that I would need to invest a year or more to get the game to a finished state. I loved <i>Dungeons and Dragons</i> and 
        would have loved to write a sprite-based adventure game. But, man, when I consider all the sprite-work that would be 
        required for the player, wielding all the weapons they might wield, all the monsters and their moves, all the spell 
        effects, etc. Never mind coding all the spells, varied combat, etc.
    </p>
    <figure>
        <img width="512" src="https://engineersneedart.com/blog/movefast/ridaava_with_sword.png" alt="A sprite sheet from the unfinished Mobocracy.">
        <figcaption>
            Lunge, parry … cool. Now draw her fighting with a mace, and then a bow. Also she might wear a cloak.
        </figcaption>
    </figure>
    <h3>Not Really Dead</h3>
    <p>
        But this is not a case of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary_problem">The Marriage Problem</a>, you can 
        always go back and revisit a game you had previously shelved. <i>(Assuming you can still find the sources, resources, and 
        project files.)</i> I did revisit <b>Thief of Baghdad</b> eighteen or so months later (in color and renamed <b>Scheherazade</b>) 
        and it even started to get “a point”.
    </p>
    <figure>
        <img width="640" src="https://engineersneedart.com/blog/movefast/Scheherazade.jpg" alt="Unfinished game, <b>Scheherazade</b>.">
    </figure>
    <blockquote>
        Alas though, maybe you can’t go back after all —&nbsp;or perhaps <i>should</i> not. While I got further with the game in 
        its second incarnation, it never really attained that <i>indescribable something</i> and so was abandoned again.
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        Never mind that you can also <i>harvest</i> code from any of your shelved projects. I mean why rewrite the 
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisher%E2%80%93Yates_shuffle">Fisher–Yates shuffle algorithm</a> if you have it already 
        in a shelved game? Code for switching the monitor depth (on those early Macs) I moved from game to game… Polygon-point 
        collision code, a sine lookup-table for quick trig functions, a dot-product routine, cross-product routines…
    </p>
    <p>
        I never regarded these prototyping efforts as wasted ones.
    </p>
    <h3>Salaryman</h3>
    <p>
       The era of the indie Mac game developer felt to me like it was coming to a close as the 1990’s decade proceeded. In any 
       event when I was presented with a job offer to come out to California and work at Apple I eagerly took it —&nbsp;even though 
       I understood that from that point on I would not be allowed to work on non-Apple projects in my spare time.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        Not strictly true —&nbsp;to code outside of work though you did have to get written permission from management. 
        I mean it’s part of that whole <i>non-compete</i> clause —&nbsp;tech companies having been burned throughout history 
        by employees creating  start-ups that eventually take over their business. Apple was not in the <i>games business</i> 
        so perhaps I would have gotten a pass. It’s that fear that: what if I ask for permission and they say no?
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        Finding myself in a world of whiteboards and conference rooms made no difference —&nbsp;I found that I continued to take a 
        quick-prototyping approach to any project that landed on my desk (though, perhaps needless to say, the projects were no 
        longer games).
    </p>
    <p>
        Other programmers that I worked with (maybe I should call them <i>software engineers</i>) <i>designed</i> software. And they 
        made better use of the whiteboards than I did. Rather than iterate at compile-time like I was want to do, they would 
        instead carefully plan and design their software before ever typing a line of code —&nbsp;iterating I suppose on a whiteboard.

        From my approach of diving in rather than planning I began to regard myself at Apple as a “blue-collar” programmer 
        working among “white-collar” professionals (imposter syndrome maybe?). But to give myself some credit, after having 
        written code for seven years or so at this point, my instinct as to which direction to dive in with a task was at least 
        an informed one.

    <blockquote>
        There’s a guy on GitHub, his status is “I am typing on the keyboard to do the job.” Story of my life —&nbsp;I like it.
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        No doubt though, often enough, this freewheeling approach might send me into the weeds. But with the speed at which I 
        pulled the code together, I often found the bottlenecks fairly quickly —&nbsp;quick enough that I could more or less start 
        the whole project over. If you find this narrator reliable, I will say that I often would start and then restart a project 
        perhaps three times and, when all was said and done, have the project in as good a state at about the same time that my 
        white-collar cohorts would have their more carefully designed code also running.
    </p>
    <p>
        So was the whole exercise of my guerilla programming technique a wash? Maybe. But it always served <i>me</i> well 
        (or was perhaps the only way I knew to program effectively). Often though my last code <i>revision</i> was in fact to 
        simplify the code —&nbsp;generally to make it easier to follow, easier to understand, easier to maintain. <i>(The insight on 
        how at last to organize the code having come out of treating the whole thing as wildly mutable from the beginning.)</i>
    </p>
    <p>
        There were times too when a coworker might have said, “You should have used a Bloom Filter” and I was able to come back with, 
        “Yeah, already tried that but the typical data we are seeing is so small that the performance gains were negligible and added 
        unnecessary complexity to the code base so I tossed it.” Boom!
    </p>
    <p>
        <i>(Okay, maybe something like that happened only once —&nbsp;but it was awesome when it did!)</i>
    </p>
    <h3>A.B.I.</h3>
    <p>
        By the time I finally retired I had slowly come around to feeling like I had in fact been a contributing employee at Apple. 
        To be clear, it was important to me to be a contributing <i>co-worker</i> really. The engineers on the teams that I worked 
        on were the highlight of working as a salaryman (no longer coding solo in a monitor-lit corner of the bedroom all night). 
        I worked with the smartest people I have ever come to know. There were people I worked with that were an order of magnitude 
        better programmer than I will ever be. And it was important to me to feel like I was helping too in my way.
    </p>
    <p>
        I think I did rank among the <i>fastest</i> programmers. <i>(Is that a category?)</i> You wanted something prototyped to show as a 
        demo for a meeting this week, I’ll have two versions for you then (one with and without a Bloom Filter, ha ha).
    </p>
    <p>
        And this bit is for my daughters. I have always told them growing up, “A. B. I.”
    </p>
    <p>
        “‘A’ — Always. ‘B’ — Be. ‘I’ — Iterating.”
    </p>
    <p>
        “Always Be Iterating.”
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>
            I put together disk images of these <i>games-that-never-were</i> —&nbsp;projects, sources, tools —&nbsp;and posted them to GitHub. 
            The pixel art of that early Macintosh era, especially the B&amp;W era, resonates with nostalgia for a lot of people. There might 
            too be a lesson to game devs in all the times that a game has <i>not</i> launched. For me, as I stated at the outset, 
            I assembled these relics for the memories —&nbsp;or maybe to close that chapter.
        </p>
        <p>
            I have posted the disk images I have assembled to date as

            There will be a Volume 3. It’s a bit of work though to get each project in shape for “release” so I can’t promise when a  
            follow-on volume will appear.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-headline="3D-Stacked CMOS Takes Moore’s Law to New Heights"><p><strong>Perhaps the most</strong> far-reaching technological achievement over the last 50 years has been the steady <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/a-better-way-to-measure-progress-in-semiconductors" target="_self">march toward ever smaller transistors</a>, fitting them more tightly together, and reducing their power consumption. And yet, ever since the two of us started our <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/topic/careers/">careers</a> at <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/intel">Intel</a> more than 20 years ago, we’ve been hearing the alarms that the descent into the infinitesimal was about to end. Yet year after year, brilliant new innovations continue to propel the semiconductor industry further.
</p><p>
	Along this journey, we engineers had to change the transistor’s architecture as we continued to scale down area and power consumption while boosting performance. The “planar” <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/transistor">transistor</a> designs that took us through the last half of the 20th century gave way to 3D fin-shaped devices by the first half of the 2010s. Now, these too have an end date in sight, with a new gate-all-around (GAA) structure rolling into production soon. But we have to look even further ahead because our ability to scale down even this new transistor architecture, which we call RibbonFET, has its limits.
</p><hr><p>
	So where will we turn for future scaling? We will continue to look to the third dimension. We’ve created experimental devices that stack atop each other, delivering logic that is 30 to 50 percent smaller. Crucially, the top and bottom devices are of the two complementary types, NMOS and PMOS, that are the foundation of all the logic circuits of the last several decades. We believe this 3D-stacked complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS), or CFET (complementary field-effect transistor), will be the key to extending Moore’s Law into the next decade.
</p><h2>The Evolution of the Transistor </h2><p><strong>Continuous innovation is an essential underpinning of Moore’s Law</strong>, but each improvement comes with trade-offs. To understand these trade-offs and how they’re leading us inevitably toward 3D-stacked CMOS, you need a bit of background on transistor operation.
</p><p>
	Every metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor, or MOSFET, has the same set of basic parts: the gate stack, the channel region, the source, and the drain. The source and drain are chemically doped to make them both either rich in mobile electrons (
	<em>n</em>-type) or deficient in them (<em>p</em>-type). The channel region has the opposite doping to the source and drain.
</p><div id="rebelltitem19" data-id="19" data-reload-ads="false" data-is-image="False" data-href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/3d-cmos/particle-19" data-basename="particle-19" data-post-id="2657807330" data-published-at="1669929004" data-use-pagination="False"><p>In the planar version in use in advanced microprocessors up to 2011, the MOSFET’s gate stack is situated just above the channel region and is designed to project an electric field into the channel region. Applying a large enough voltage to the gate (relative to the source) creates a layer of mobile charge carriers in the channel region that allows current to flow between the source and drain.</p><p>As we scaled down the classic planar transistors, what device physicists call short-channel effects took center stage. Basically, the distance between the source and drain became so small that current would leak across the channel when it wasn’t supposed to, because the gate electrode struggled to deplete the channel of charge carriers. To address this, the industry moved to an entirely different transistor architecture called a <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/how-the-father-of-finfets-helped-save-moores-law" target="_self">FinFET</a>. It wrapped the gate around the channel on three sides to provide better electrostatic control.</p></div><p><img id="e1679" data-rm-shortcode-id="19f1ce24c1d6d33cec903b159c775a2f" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" lazy-loadable="true" src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/blocks-of-grey-silver-and-black-with-a-stripe-of-gold-dots-on-one-and-a-fin-shaped-structure-of-gold-dots-on-the-other.jpg?id=30541824&amp;width=980" data-runner-src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/blocks-of-grey-silver-and-black-with-a-stripe-of-gold-dots-on-one-and-a-fin-shaped-structure-of-gold-dots-on-the-other.jpg?id=30541824&amp;width=980" width="1300" height="1300" alt="Blocks of grey, silver, and black with a stripe of gold dots on one and a fin-shaped structure of gold dots on the other."></p><div id="rebelltitem4" data-id="4" data-reload-ads="false" data-is-image="False" data-href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/3d-cmos/particle-4" data-basename="particle-4" data-post-id="2657807330" data-published-at="1669927851" data-use-pagination="False"><p><a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/intels-new-transistors-enter-the-third-dimension" target="_self">Intel introduced its FinFETs</a> in 2011, at the 22-nanometer node, with the third-generation Core processor, and the device architecture has been the workhorse of Moore’s Law ever since. With FinFETs, we could operate at a lower voltage and still have less leakage, reducing power consumption by some 50 percent at the same performance level as the previous-generation planar architecture. FinFETs also switched faster, boosting performance by 37 percent. And because conduction occurs on both vertical sides of the “fin,” the device can drive more current through a given area of silicon than can a planar device, which only conducts along one surface.</p><p>However, we did lose something in moving to FinFETs. In planar devices, the width of a transistor was defined by lithography, and therefore it is a highly flexible parameter. But in FinFETs, the transistor width comes in the form of discrete increments—adding one fin at a time–a characteristic often referred to as fin quantization. As flexible as the FinFET may be, fin quantization remains a significant design constraint. The design rules around it and the desire to add more fins to boost performance increase the overall area of logic cells and complicate the stack of interconnects that turn individual transistors into complete logic circuits. It also increases the transistor’s capacitance, thereby sapping some of its switching speed. So, while the FinFET has served us well as the industry’s workhorse, a new, more refined approach is needed. And it’s that approach that led us to the 3D transistors we’re introducing soon.</p></div><div id="rebelltitem6" data-id="6" data-reload-ads="false" data-is-image="False" data-href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/3d-cmos/particle-6" data-basename="particle-6" data-post-id="2657807330" data-published-at="1669927940" data-use-pagination="False"><p>This advance, the RibbonFET, is our first new transistor architecture since the FinFET’s debut 11 years ago. In it, the gate fully surrounds the channel, providing even tighter control of charge carriers within channels that are now formed by nanometer-scale ribbons of silicon. With these nanoribbons (also called <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/the-nanosheet-transistor-is-the-next-and-maybe-last-step-in-moores-law" target="_self">nanosheets)</a>, we can again vary the width of a transistor as needed using lithography.</p><p>With the quantization constraint removed, we can produce the appropriately sized width for the application. That lets us balance power, performance, and cost. What’s more, with the ribbons stacked and operating in parallel, the device can drive more current, boosting performance without increasing the area of the device.<br></p><p>We see RibbonFETs as the best option for higher performance at reasonable power, and we will be introducing them in 2024 along with other innovations, such as PowerVia, our version of <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/next-gen-chips-will-be-powered-from-below" target="_self">backside power delivery</a>, with the <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/intel">Intel</a> 20A fabrication process.</p></div><div id="rebelltitem7" data-id="7" data-reload-ads="false" data-is-image="False" data-href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/3d-cmos/particle-7" data-basename="particle-7" data-post-id="2657807330" data-published-at="1669928096" data-use-pagination="False"><h2>Stacked CMOS</h2><p>One commonality of planar, FinFET, and RibbonFET transistors is that they all use CMOS technology, which, as mentioned, consists of <em>n</em>-type (NMOS) and <em>p</em>-type (PMOS) transistors. CMOS logic became mainstream in the 1980s because it draws significantly less current than do the alternative technologies, notably NMOS-only circuits. Less current also led to greater operating frequencies and higher transistor densities.</p><p>To date, all CMOS technologies place the standard NMOS and PMOS transistor pair side by side. But in a <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8993462/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">keynote</a> at the <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/conhome/8971803/proceeding" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">IEEE International Electron Devices Meeting (IEDM) in 2019</a>, we introduced the concept of a 3D-stacked transistor that places the NMOS transistor on top of the PMOS transistor. The following year, at IEDM 2020, we presented <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9372066" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the design for the first logic circuit using this 3D technique</a>, an inverter. Combined with appropriate interconnects, the 3D-stacked CMOS approach effectively cuts the inverter footprint in half, doubling the area density and further pushing the limits of Moore’s Law.</p></div><div id="rebelltitem9" data-id="9" data-reload-ads="false" data-is-image="False" data-href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/3d-cmos/particle-9" data-basename="particle-9" data-post-id="2657807330" data-published-at="1669928096" data-use-pagination="False"><p>Taking advantage of the potential benefits of 3D stacking means solving a number of process integration challenges, some of which will stretch the limits of CMOS fabrication.</p><p>We built the 3D-stacked CMOS inverter using what is known as a self-aligned process, in which both transistors are constructed in one manufacturing step. This means constructing both <em>n</em>-type and <em>p</em>-type sources and drains by epitaxy—crystal deposition—and adding different metal gates for the two transistors. By combining the source-drain and dual-metal-gate processes, we are able to create different conductive types of silicon nanoribbons (<em>p</em>-type and <em>n</em>-type) to make up the stacked CMOS transistor pairs. It also allows us to adjust the device’s threshold voltage—the voltage at which a transistor begins to switch—separately for the top and bottom nanoribbons.</p></div><p><img id="be20b" data-rm-shortcode-id="6b57a2642594eb748f7a1356e29d79ac" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" lazy-loadable="true" src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/three-pairs-of-two-grey-rectangles-float-above-three-more-pairs-of-grey-rectangles-in-a-black-and-white-micrograph.png?id=30542655&amp;width=980" data-runner-src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/three-pairs-of-two-grey-rectangles-float-above-three-more-pairs-of-grey-rectangles-in-a-black-and-white-micrograph.png?id=30542655&amp;width=980" width="1498" height="1060" alt="Three pairs of two grey rectangles float above three more pairs of grey rectangles in a black-and-white micrograph."><small><p>In CMOS logic, NMOS and PMOS devices usually sit side by side on chips. An early prototype has NMOS devices stacked on top of PMOS devices, compressing circuit sizes.</p></small><small><p>Intel</p></small></p><p>How do we do all that? The self-aligned 3D CMOS fabrication begins with a silicon wafer. On this wafer, we deposit repeating layers of silicon and silicon germanium, a structure called a superlattice. We then use lithographic patterning to cut away parts of the superlattice and leave a finlike structure. The superlattice crystal provides a strong support structure for what comes later.</p><p>Next, we deposit a block of “dummy” polycrystalline silicon atop the part of the superlattice where the device gates will go, protecting them from the next step in the procedure. That step, called the vertically stacked dual source/drain process, grows phosphorous-doped silicon on both ends of the top nanoribbons (the future NMOS device) while also selectively growing boron-doped silicon germanium on the bottom nanoribbons (the future PMOS device). After this, we deposit dielectric around the sources and drains to electrically isolate them from one another. The latter step requires that we then polish the wafer down to perfect flatness.</p><p>Finally, we construct the gate. First, we remove that dummy gate we’d put in place earlier, exposing the silicon nanoribbons. We next etch away only the silicon germanium, releasing a stack of parallel silicon nanoribbons, which will be the channel regions of the transistors. We then coat the nanoribbons on all sides with a vanishingly thin layer of an insulator that has a high dielectric constant. The nanoribbon channels are so small and positioned in such a way that we can’t effectively dope them chemically as we would with a planar transistor. Instead, we use a property of the metal gates called the work function to impart the same effect. We surround the bottom nanoribbons with one metal to make a <em>p</em>-doped channel and the top ones with another to form an <em>n</em>-doped channel. Thus, the gate stacks are finished off and the two transistors are complete.</p><div id="rebelltitem14" data-id="14" data-reload-ads="false" data-is-image="False" data-href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/3d-cmos/particle-14" data-basename="particle-14" data-post-id="2657807330" data-published-at="1669928471" data-use-pagination="False"><p>The process might seem complex, but it’s better than the alternative—a technology called sequential 3D-stacked CMOS. With that method, the NMOS devices and the PMOS devices are built on separate wafers, the two are bonded, and the PMOS layer is transferred to the NMOS wafer. In comparison, the self-aligned 3D process takes fewer manufacturing steps and keeps a tighter rein on manufacturing cost, something we demonstrated in research and reported at IEDM 2019.<br></p><p>Importantly, the self-aligned method also circumvents the problem of misalignment that can occur when bonding two wafers. Still, sequential 3D stacking is being explored to facilitate integration of silicon with nonsilicon channel materials, such as germanium and III-V semiconductor materials. These approaches and materials may become relevant as we look to tightly integrate optoelectronics and other functions on a single chip.</p></div><div id="rebelltitem17" data-id="17" data-reload-ads="false" data-is-image="False" data-href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/3d-cmos/particle-17" data-basename="particle-17" data-post-id="2657807330" data-published-at="1669928814" data-use-pagination="False"><p>The new self-aligned CMOS process, and the 3D-stacked CMOS it creates, work well and appear to have substantial room for further miniaturization. At this early stage, that’s highly encouraging. Devices having a gate length of 75 nm demonstrated both the low leakage that comes with excellent device scalability and a high on-state current. Another promising sign: We’ve made wafers where the smallest distance between two sets of stacked devices is only <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9720633" target="_blank">55 nm</a>. While the device performance results we achieved are not records in and of themselves, they do compare well with individual nonstacked control devices built on the same wafer with the same processing.</p><p>In parallel with the process integration and experimental work, we have many ongoing theoretical, simulation, and design studies underway looking to provide insight into how best to use 3D CMOS. Through these, we’ve found some of the key considerations in the design of our transistors. Notably, we now know that we need to optimize the vertical spacing between the NMOS and PMOS—if it’s too short it will increase parasitic capacitance, and if it’s too long it will increase the resistance of the interconnects between the two devices. Either extreme results in slower circuits that consume more power.</p><p>Many design studies, such as one by <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9720577/" target="_blank">TEL Research Center America presented at IEDM 2021</a>, focus on providing all the necessary interconnects in the 3D CMOS’s limited space and doing so without significantly increasing the area of the logic cells they make up. The TEL research showed that there are many opportunities for innovation in finding the best interconnect options. That research also highlights that 3D-stacked CMOS will need to have interconnects both above and below the devices. This scheme, called <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/next-gen-chips-will-be-powered-from-below" target="_self">buried power rails</a>, takes the interconnects that provide power to logic cells but don’t carry data and removes them to the silicon below the transistors. Intel’s PowerVIA technology, which does just that and is scheduled for introduction in 2024, will therefore play a key role in making 3D-stacked CMOS a commercial reality.</p><h2>The Future of Moore’s Law</h2><p>With RibbonFETs and 3D CMOS, we have a clear path to extend Moore’s Law beyond 2024. In a <a href="https://large.stanford.edu/courses/2012/ph250/lee1/docs/Excepts_A_Conversation_with_Gordon_Moore.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">2005 interview</a> in which he was asked to reflect on what became his law, <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/gordon-moore">Gordon Moore</a> admitted to being “periodically amazed at how we’re able to make progress. Several times along the way, I thought we reached the end of the line, things taper off, and our creative engineers come up with ways around them.”</p><p>With the move to FinFETs, the ensuing optimizations, and now the development of RibbonFETs and eventually 3D-stacked CMOS, supported by the myriad packaging enhancements around them, we’d like to think Mr. Moore will be amazed yet again.</p></div></div></div>]]></description>

I built a rugged, durable collapsable duck blind on an 18 foot Lund Alaskan. Excellent product. I found out about this product on the Facebook page DIY duck boat and blind builders page. I highly recommend this product to anyone that wants to build something DIY but with a bit more of a professional finish.</p> <p>

I've worked for an electrical contractor and I've built countless solutions to crazy problems using EMT conduit, usually by welding which is difficult and dangerous because of the zinc galvanize. I no longer have access to a welder so I began to search "conduit fittings" which led me to Maker Pipe which is the coolest concept ever!</p> <p>

<p><span>Anime – what started as a niche genre of manga and animation has become a multi-billion dollar </span><a href="https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/anime-market" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>industry</span></a><span> in its own right, with chart-topping games like </span><a href="https://www.pocketgamer.biz/pokmon-go-catches-nearly-8-billion-in-eight-years/#:~:text=Niantic's%20Pok%C3%A9mon%20Go%20has,launched%2C%20according%20to%20AppMagic%20estimates." target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Pok</span><span>é</span><span>mon Go</span></a><span> and </span><a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1208573/genshin-impact-player-spending-app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Genshin Impact</span></a><span> grossing billions and </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demon_Slayer:_Kimetsu_no_Yaiba_%E2%80%93_The_Movie:_Mugen_Train" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>movies</span></a><span> like Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba becoming one of the highest grossing films of the year.

We estimate the total </span><b>market size of anime to be north of $50B</b><span>, once accounting for anime, comics, and games (</span><a href="https://www.data.ai/en/go/the-state-of-anime-gaming-2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>data</span></a><span>.ai, </span><a href="https://www.precedenceresearch.com/anime-market" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Precedence Research</span></a><span>).&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Yet, </span><b>we believe that anime is just getting started – today, new technologies and business models are accelerating a once niche industry to even greater heights</b><span>. Anime is where the future of creation and play is happening, whether with innovative games on our phones, user-created fanfictions and games, roleplaying as the characters themselves, or interactions with AI-versions of these fictional beings. We believe that anime will become one of the dominant formats through which we consume and engage with content.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>The usual lifecycle of an anime fan looks something like this: they are introduced to the format with great IP – the Attack on Titan anime or the One Piece live action show or one of the miHoYo games. They then deepen their fandom through new forms of social and creative engagement (UGC, VTubing, community formation, cosplay, etc.). </span><b>What we’re most excited about is how anime engagement has evolved from passive to interactive over the last few years. </b><span>This has happened along a few different axes:&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li><b>AI companions</b><span>, an evolution of classic visual novels, are the most popular for anime characters and IP. They are quickly becoming one of the dominant forms of roleplay.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><b>UGC platforms</b><span> (user-generated content) such as Roblox allow anime fans to create their own renditions of popular anime games much more easily than ever before. Fans can express their creativity with play that they define themselves.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><b>Anime studios</b><span> are adopting new AI technologies to create content faster and more cost effectively, but they are also iterating on new core loops with AI-native character interactions.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><b>VTubing</b><span> has transformed the way millions of anime fans interact with their favorite characters in new social and parasocial relationships by allowing any fan to roleplay as the characters themselves.&nbsp;</span></li>

<h2><span>A Quick History of Anime</span></h2>
<p><span>Anime is a genre of animation that originated from Japan and is known for its distinctive art style: bright colorful graphics, strong outlines, large, exaggerated eyes and features, and brightly colored hair. It originated in the early 1900s with visual strips, but really started becoming more popular in the 60s and 70s with shows like </span><i><span>Astro Boy, Lupin III, Akira, Mobile Suit Gundam, </span></i><span>and of course, Hayao Miyazaki’s works at Studio Ghibli. Anime entered the mainstream in the 2000s with popular shounen anime like Naruto, One Piece, and now Attack on Titan. You might see football players referencing the Attack on Titan </span><a href="https://twitter.com/chargers/status/1367264349581148170" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>salute</span></a><span> as a celebration, or pop culture memes all around the internet.</span></p>
<p><span>Nowadays anime is more popular than ever: </span><a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/digital/sony-crunchyroll-specialty-streamer-asian-content-1235352518/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Crunchyroll</span></a><span> estimated that viewership doubled between 2020-2022 alone to over 300M fans worldwide. </span><a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/japan-content-boom-1235753598/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Netflix</span></a><span> reported in 2022 that over half of its subscribers worldwide watched some anime content on its platform. The top 4 </span><a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1327143/discord-top-gaming-servers-worldwide-by-number-of-members/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Discord servers</span></a><span> worldwide are all anime-related. Anime is also a medium that caters to many different audience types, from mature </span><i><span>seinen </span></i><span>anime like </span><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0434706/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Monster</span></a><span> to classic action </span><i><span>shounen </span></i><span>like </span><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9335498/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0_tt_8_nm_0_q_demon%2520slayer" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Demon Slayer</span></a><span> or </span><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0409591/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0_tt_8_nm_0_q_naruto" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Naruto</span></a><span>, from female-oriented </span><i><span>shoujo </span></i><span>like </span><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0816397/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0_tt_8_nm_0_q_ouran%2520" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Ouran High School Club</span></a><span> to contemplative slice of life stories like </span><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0807832/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0_tt_6_nm_2_q_mushi" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Mushi-shi</span></a><span>. Because of this broad appeal, there’s a huge community of diverse fans that have engaged with the medium over many years and developed strong affinity toward IP and characters. This affinity has led to one of the most popular use cases of AI recently –&nbsp; AI waifus and husbandos.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><span>The Rise of AI Waifus / Husbandos</span></h2>
<p><span>First, to explain popular slang – what is a </span><a href="https://www.cbr.com/anime-waifu-popularity-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>waifu</span></a><span> or husbando? Waifus / husbandos are fictionalized girls and guys who viewers feel some level of emotional or romantic attachment to. This isn’t as rare of an occurrence as one might think; </span><a href="https://www.polygon.com/c/2024/1/22/24034466/anime-viewer-survey-research" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Polygon</span></a><span> reported that 44% of surveyed anime viewers reported developing a crush on an anime character. “The other 56% are lying,” the report jokes. After all, anime fans tend to express their fandom deeply through merch, fanart, conventions, cosplay, and other means (66% make some form of fan art according to </span><a href="https://view-su2.highspot.com/viewer/64d51fda505755b87e89cb58#_ga=2.94274269.1720429966.1709007503-1299405015.1706207646" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>fandom</span></a><span>). So it’s not surprising that they would also develop a deep attachment to the characters. Anime Expo in LA for instance, routinely attracts hundreds of thousands of fans each year, the a16z team included.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>Waifu / husbando culture derives from visual novels, and AI companions are the logical extension of these animated storybook games. Originally, </span><a href="https://medium.com/mammon-machine-zeal/a-brief-history-of-visual-novels-641a2e6b1acb" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>visual novels</span></a><span> were serialized books with anime-styled pictures in between. But now the term colloquially refers to the digital version in which the player has agency, with branching storylines where you roleplay as the main character, advancing through the plot and choosing to romance other male/female characters. This is a relatively niche market (</span><a href="https://reports.valuates.com/market-reports/QYRE-Auto-26F13788/global-visual-novel" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>~$150M</span></a><span> according to some sources), but one that has an outsized impact on the industry. For example, Fate/Grand Order, one of the most successful gacha games with $5B+ cumulative revenue, is descended from a visual novel called Fate/Stay Night.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The structure of the visual novel with branching dialogue trees is a precursor to modern AI companions today. While there are many practical use cases for AI-simulated human interactions – AI as therapist, as teacher, as assistant, etc. – one of the most popular realizations are as friends and romantic companions (more on the broader companion space from my colleagues </span><a href="https://a16z.com/its-not-a-computer-its-a-companion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>here</span></a><span>). For instance, </span><a href="https://beta.character.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>character.ai</span></a><span>’s top characters are all from Genshin Impact; Raiden, Yae Miko, and Hu Tao take some of the top spots at 390M, 202M, and 113M messages respectively as of the time of this blog, compared to Elon Musk at a mere 40M messages. Other top characters are Gojo Satoru (638M) from popular shounen </span><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt12343534/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Jujutsu Kaisen</span></a><span> and Levi Ackerman (250M) from </span><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2560140/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0_tt_8_nm_0_q_attack" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Attack on Titan</span></a><span>.</span></p>

<p><span>Many of the top companion sites like </span><a href="http://janitorai.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>janitorai</span></a><span>, </span><a href="http://chub.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>chub.ai</span></a><span>, or </span><a href="http://spicychat.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>spicychat.ai</span></a><span> also feature anime companions – ranging from roleplay with school bullies to overprotective sisters to… furries? – as some of their top personalities. There are also vertically specific companion apps for anime: </span><a href="http://crushon.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>crushon.ai</span></a><span> is an 18+ example, </span><a href="https://www.talkie-ai.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>talkieai</span></a><span> is relatively safe-for-work, while </span><a href="https://hyper.online/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Hyper</span></a><span> includes VTuber-esque live facial elements. There’s </span><a href="https://www.moemate.io/?page=1&amp;tags=featured" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>moemate</span></a><span> which allows you to bring the companions cross-browser and play games like chess and checkers, and </span><a href="https://kajiwoto.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>kajiwoto</span></a><span> that allows you to more deeply customize your prompts and datasets and share them on server.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b>AI is deepening the previously parasocial relationships we had with our favorite anime characters from passive linear media, into powerful new, interactive relationships</b><span>. The reason why anime is so resonant as a genre for AI companions is because character affinity / romance is already built into many of the best anime stories. The majority of top anime games and visual novels are role playing games that feature a romance mechanic, and so it’s natural for fans to want to deepen their connection to their favorite IP and characters through active interactions.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>As AI advances, the interactions will become non-scripted and more multi-modal: we’ll interact with our companions through voice and text, their animations and reactions will be generated in real time, we’ll be able to play games with them, and they’ll have longer context windows to remember our shared history together. We’re already seeing startups pushing the boundaries for how we interact with content. </span><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=chat.sekai.app&amp;hl=en_US" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Sekai</span></a><span> is using AI to create short, bite-sized videos of you and anime characters in fanfiction-esque scenarios. Meanwhile, there are several stealth studios that are building </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otome_game" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>otome games</span></a><span> in the vein of </span><a href="https://loveanddeepspace.infoldgames.com/en-EN/home" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Love and Deep Space</span></a><span> ($200m+ annualized revenue, SensorTower), but where the side quests, dates, and interaction texts in the game are AI-generated.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><span>UGC Democratizes Creation for Anime Fans</span></h2>
<p><b>Anime is the new playground for content creation.</b><span> Fans often engage with anime IP by creating their own versions of art, novels, and games, and innovation is happening across the stack. There’s </span><a href="https://nijijourney.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Nijijourney</span></a><span> for art, </span><a href="https://novelai.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>NovelAI</span></a><span> for fanfiction, </span><a href="https://www.fanbox.cc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>pixivFANBOX</span></a><span> for creator support, and UGC-platforms for games. For instance, several of the top Roblox games are based on IP like One Piece or One Punch Man, and for a platform with over 60M DAU and 300M MAU, this is a very broad player base of anime fans. In particular, Roblox is a good proxy for what’s trending with the younger generation given its </span><a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1190869/roblox-games-users-global-distribution-age/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>demographic</span></a><span> skews towards kids and teens. Similar to how AI companions give fans a new way to interact with IP, UGC allows them to reimagine and remix their favorite IP in wholly new contexts.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>There are a few notable reasons for the popularity of these games. The first is that there’s clear player demand against a shortage of high quality anime IP games; one example is Palworld’s recent success as the “Pokemon with guns” game, selling </span><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/palworld-sells-15-million-on-steam-in-a-month" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>over 25M copies</span></a><span> in a month across Steam and Xbox Game Pass. The second reason is that the anime IP licensing landscape is notoriously difficult to navigate for developers, creating a potential undersupply of games. Besides the language and cultural barrier, IP may be owned by different parties for different regions and different formats (movie, game, manga, etc.). Large aggregators like Crunchyroll and Funimation may already own exclusive licenses for certain IPs altogether. Some startups like </span><a href="https://en.kasagilabo.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Kasagi Labo</span></a><span>, </span><a href="https://www.layerlicensing.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Layer</span></a><span>, and </span><a href="https://www.story.foundation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Story Protocol</span></a><span> are tackling this issue to make IP more democratized and easier to access.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b>We believe that as new AI tools emerge and existing UGC platforms embrace AI, we’ll see the barriers to creation drop and the release of even more fan-created transmedia content. </b><span>Roblox has already incorporated </span><a href="https://aibusiness.com/nlp/roblox-gives-users-ai-tools-to-generate-3d-models-from-text-for-games" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>AI into user workflows</span></a><span>, and Google’s DeepMind team recently announced </span><a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2402.15391v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Genie</span></a><span> which can convert prompts into 2D playable environments. The Tencent team also recently unveiled </span><a href="https://gamegen-o.github.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>GameGen-O</span></a><span> which pushes the boundaries for generated open world games like Genshin Impact.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Beyond UGC platforms, AI models and tools are enabling first-time creators to make compelling anime content that previously would only have been possible with a team of professionals. For art, </span><a href="https://nijijourney.com/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Nijijourney</span></a><span> is an image diffusion model focused on generating high-quality anime images from text, a collaboration between </span><a href="https://spellbrush.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Spellbrush</span></a><span> and </span><a href="https://www.midjourney.com/home" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Midjourney</span></a><span>. There are also various fine-tuned Stable Diffusion models (a few </span><a href="https://civitai.com/tag/anime" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>here</span></a><span> hosted on citiv.ai) that capture different styles and poses, some trained on SD 1.5, others like </span><a href="https://civitai.com/models/260267" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Animagine XL V3</span></a><span> on SDXL 1.0. </span><a href="https://yodayo.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Yodayo</span></a><span> integrates AI generated anime art and character chatbots together, and </span><a href="https://pixai.art/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>pixai.art</span></a><span> contains models that mimic popular IP (Genshin, Pokemon, Blue Archive, etc.).&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>For animations and video there are several options available for the aspiring creator. </span><a href="https://runwayml.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>RunwayML</span></a><span>, </span><a href="https://lumalabs.ai/dream-machine" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Luma Labs</span></a><span>, </span><a href="https://www.hedra.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Hedra</span></a><span>, and </span><a href="https://pika.art/login" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>PikaLabs</span></a><span> have built foundation models for text-to-video generation. One can use </span><a href="https://domoai.app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>domoAI</span></a><span> for anime-specific polish, and </span><a href="https://magnific.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>MagnificAI</span></a><span> and </span><a href="https://www.topazlabs.com/topaz-photo-ai" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Topaz Labs</span></a><span> to enhance images and image-to-video prompts. </span><a href="https://elevenlabs.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>ElevenLabs</span></a><span> is used for voiceovers and dubs, and </span><a href="https://www.udio.com/"><span>Udio</span></a><span> and </span><a href="https://suno.com/"><span>Suno</span></a><span> are used for music. For manga/comics, there are companies like </span><a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/shortbread" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Shortbread</span></a><span> that are helping to create webcomics and manga more seamlessly, with context and consistency between scenes and shots. There’s still a way to go to improve model accuracy, speed, and cost, but it’s clear that as these tools evolve they will empower more creators that might previously have lacked technical or artistic skills to bring their anime ideas to life.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><span>Anime Game Studios Lead the Way&nbsp;</span></h2>
<p><span>On the other side of the spectrum, professional game studios are leading the charge for high production-value consumer experiences that build on or create new IP. </span><b>Anime games are some of the highest grossing in the games industry, </b><a href="https://www.data.ai/en/insights/mobile-gaming/state-of-anime-gaming/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><b>accounting for 20%</b></a><b> of spend on the mobile app store despite only having usage penetration of &lt;3%</b><span>. For example, Monster Strike has out-earned Candy Crush ($7.6B cumulative revenue vs. $6.9B) on a much smaller player base of 10M MAU vs. Candy Crush’s 70M+ MAU (SensorTower, 2016-19). Meanwhile, miHoYo’s Genshin Impact is on track to be one of the highest earning games of all time at its current trajectory (see below), with nearly $4B earned since launching just over three years ago.</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://d1lamhf6l6yk6d.cloudfront.net/uploads/2024/09/Total-Lifetime-Net-Revenue-of-Top-Grossing-Anime-Mobile-Games-1.png" alt="" width="2000" height="1354" srcset="https://d1lamhf6l6yk6d.cloudfront.net/uploads/2024/09/Total-Lifetime-Net-Revenue-of-Top-Grossing-Anime-Mobile-Games-1.png 2000w, https://d1lamhf6l6yk6d.cloudfront.net/uploads/2024/09/Total-Lifetime-Net-Revenue-of-Top-Grossing-Anime-Mobile-Games-1-300x203.png 300w, https://d1lamhf6l6yk6d.cloudfront.net/uploads/2024/09/Total-Lifetime-Net-Revenue-of-Top-Grossing-Anime-Mobile-Games-1-1024x693.png 1024w, https://d1lamhf6l6yk6d.cloudfront.net/uploads/2024/09/Total-Lifetime-Net-Revenue-of-Top-Grossing-Anime-Mobile-Games-1-768x520.png 768w, https://d1lamhf6l6yk6d.cloudfront.net/uploads/2024/09/Total-Lifetime-Net-Revenue-of-Top-Grossing-Anime-Mobile-Games-1-1536x1040.png 1536w, https://d1lamhf6l6yk6d.cloudfront.net/uploads/2024/09/Total-Lifetime-Net-Revenue-of-Top-Grossing-Anime-Mobile-Games-1-400x271.png 400w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px"></p>
<p><span>There are two ways that anime game studios broaden the horizon for players. First, they usually create the highest quality games of the most popular IPs like Dragon Ball, Pokemon, or Dragon Quest. Six of the top 10 highest grossing anime games are based on existing IP, allowing fans to interact directly with the characters themselves. Second, they often innovate on core game loops or technology: miHoYo’s Genshin Impact was one of the first true cross-platform anime games, GungHo’s Puzzles &amp; Dragons mixed match-3 and RPG mechanics for the first time, and Riot’s Valorant was one of the most accessible entries into tactical first person shooters. There are also&nbsp; several stealth startups experimenting with weaving LLMs into visual novel gameplay.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>So, what makes these games so compelling and why do they make so much money? We theorize that there are a few key components that contribute to their success:&nbsp;</span><b></b></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Proven, better, new. </b><span>A lot of the games that have become breakout hits like </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_Go" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Pokemon Go</span></a><span>, </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genshin_Impact" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Genshin Impact</span></a><span>, or </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puzzle_%26_Dragons" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Puzzle &amp; Dragons</span></a><span> combine familiar systems with some form of unique gameplay innovation. For Pokemon it was the unique location-based game system combined with being the first Pokemon game on the mobile platform and for Genshin it was combining the open world gameplay of Zelda with the RPG elements of a traditional gacha and true cross-platform play. However, for many games, the bulk of many systems will be borrowed from the existing status quo and best-in-class from other games: banner-based live ops and events, gacha monetization, power creep and player progression, character personality archetypes like </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsundere" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>tsunderes</span></a><span>, etc.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><b>RPG at its core. </b><span>Almost all the highest grossing games this year were role-playing games (RPGs). In this genre, players have one, or multiple characters that they “role-play” as by leveling them up, fighting monsters, equipping items, changing builds, etc. This isn’t surprising given that RPGs make up the highest spend for all mobile games (31%) despite having some of the lowest downloads by genre (3%). They are simply very deep games that the most hardcore gamers tend to gravitate towards, and can monetize well through pay for power or gacha.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><b>Strong / compelling IP. </b><span>It’s not an accident that six of the top ten anime games license popular IP for their titles. In anime games, because character collection is a primary driver of gameplay and monetization, IP is very important to drive that core motivation. Story matters.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><b>Gacha monetization. </b><span>Gacha games have some of the highest average revenue per user (ARPU) in the industry and is a reason why Japan has some of the highest </span><a href="https://asoindex.io/mobile-growth/why-arpu-in-japan-surpasses-other-countries" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>ARPU by country</span></a><span>. Gacha traces its history back to </span><a href="https://www.japantimes.co.jp/life/2017/08/19/lifestyle/gachapon-tracing-evolution-japans-colorful-toy-capsules/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>gachapon</span></a><span>, Japanese toy machines that dispense a random toy each time you put in a coin. The modern equivalent would be trading card packs such as in FIFA Ultimate Team. There is some controversy over this monetization practice, but more recent games have raised S-tier earn rates, added pity drops, and increased the drip of premium currency to balance out monetization and fun.&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>For now, we’ve been covering mostly free-to-play (F2P) mobile games. However, there are several successful PC/console anime games as well: </span><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/698780/Doki_Doki_Literature_Club/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Doki Doki Literature Club</span></a><span>, </span><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1687950/Persona_5_Royal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>the Persona series</span></a><span>, </span><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/curator/34459938" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>the Final Fantasy series</span></a><span>, </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fire_Emblem" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>the Fire Emblem series</span></a><span>, and </span><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/787480/Phoenix_Wright_Ace_Attorney_Trilogy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Phoenix Wright</span></a><span>, just to name a few. Many of these game franchises have been sold quite successfully through a premium business model. For instance, the Final Fantasy VII remake was one of the most anticipated in the series, and </span><a href="https://twitter.com/finalfantasyvii/status/1252583111390408706" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>sold over 3.5M copies in the first 3 days</span></a><span>. After three years, it’s now sold over </span><a href="https://x.com/finalfantasyvii/status/1702446167185883194?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>7 million copies total</span></a><span>.</span></p>

			
	
<p><span>There are several startups that have taken up the mantle in the West to build anime games for a global audience, and we’re excited to see what kinds of new experiences they create for players. </span><a href="https://www.odysseyinteractive.gg/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Odyssey Interactive</span></a><span> is building competitive multiplayer PvP games like </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjOXlvs87Lo" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Omega Strikers</span></a><span>. </span><a href="https://www.pahdolabs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Pahdo Labs</span></a><span> is building a UGC platform starting with the anime game Starlight Re:Volver. </span><a href="https://believer.gg/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Believer</span></a><span> is building an open world drawing on inspiration from Genshin Impact. </span><a href="https://www.studiosai.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Studio Sai</span></a><span> has made a hybrid dating action game, while </span><a href="https://starmi.com/our-vision#" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Starmi</span></a><span> and </span><a href="https://www.gaudiumstudio.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Gaudium</span></a><span> are both creating collectible hero gacha action games. These are just a few of the studios that are focused on realizing anime worlds for players. We believe that these studios will continue to push the boundaries of gameplay and technology, and we’re excited to see these new experiences come to fruition.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><span>VTubing Blurs Human-Digital Interactions</span></h2>
<p><span>We’ve seen how AI companions, UGC, and games allow players different ways of interacting with popular anime IP. VTubing takes it to the next level where fans can </span><i><span>become </span></i><span>popular anime characters themselves. VTuber stands for “Virtual YouTuber” and refers to a content creator who overlays an anime facial / body rig that tracks their real time motion and projects a digital avatar onto the stream (e.g. </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4YaOt1yT-ZeyB0OmxHgolA" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Kizuna AI</span></a><span>). This phenomenon likely spawned from virtual idols such as </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hatsune_Miku" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Hatsune Miku</span></a><span> that exist as fully digital characters, similar to virtual influencers like </span><a href="https://www.instagram.com/lilmiquela/?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Lil Miquela</span></a><span> in the west. There are various things that VTubers will do on stream, usually a mix of singing, chatting, dancing, and gaming. It allows for the creator to adopt a different personality, and makes it easier to create content regardless of appearance or age.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://d1lamhf6l6yk6d.cloudfront.net/uploads/2024/09/Growth-of-VTubing-Hours-Watched-Over-Time.png" alt="" width="2000" height="1291" srcset="https://d1lamhf6l6yk6d.cloudfront.net/uploads/2024/09/Growth-of-VTubing-Hours-Watched-Over-Time.png 2000w, https://d1lamhf6l6yk6d.cloudfront.net/uploads/2024/09/Growth-of-VTubing-Hours-Watched-Over-Time-300x194.png 300w, https://d1lamhf6l6yk6d.cloudfront.net/uploads/2024/09/Growth-of-VTubing-Hours-Watched-Over-Time-1024x661.png 1024w, https://d1lamhf6l6yk6d.cloudfront.net/uploads/2024/09/Growth-of-VTubing-Hours-Watched-Over-Time-768x496.png 768w, https://d1lamhf6l6yk6d.cloudfront.net/uploads/2024/09/Growth-of-VTubing-Hours-Watched-Over-Time-1536x991.png 1536w, https://d1lamhf6l6yk6d.cloudfront.net/uploads/2024/09/Growth-of-VTubing-Hours-Watched-Over-Time-400x258.png 400w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px"></p>
<p><span>Today, VTubing is a relatively small but fast-growing community that has potential to ride the anime wave into a much larger segment of content viewership and creation. While VTubers only represent </span><a href="https://blog.gamesight.io/vtuber/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>0.4% of all streamers on Twitch</span></a><span>, they represent 5.7% of total viewership. And in the first half of 2023, VTubing viewership rose by 28% despite overall Twitch views staying flat. Some of the top VTubers like </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChgPVLjqugDQpRLWvC7zzig" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Ironmouse</span></a><span> have millions of viewers, and are professionally run by organizations like </span><a href="https://www.vshojo.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>VShojo </span></a><span>or </span><a href="https://hololivepro.com/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Hololive</span></a><span>. </span><b>One day, VTubing could become just as ubiquitous as Memojis on Apple FaceTime or Snapchat filters.</b></p>
<p><span>Startups are tackling this market from a few different angles. </span><a href="https://ironvertex.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Iron Vertex</span></a><span> is the go to for professional rigs done by designers experienced in Live2D, but if you need a cheaper option, startups like </span><a href="https://hyper.online/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Hyperonline</span></a><span> or </span><a href="https://www.gohibe.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>GoHibe</span></a><span> are making it easier than ever to design your own avatar. </span><a href="http://mtion.tv/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Mtion.tv</span></a><span> meanwhile helps users design the background and environment for their avatar with visual based programming. There’s also VTubers like </span><a href="https://virtualyoutuber.fandom.com/wiki/Neuro-sama" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Neuro-sama</span></a><span>, which is an AI that represents a human VTubing streamer, and platforms that are native to the VTuber experience like </span><a href="https://anilive.app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Anilive</span></a><span>. If anime companions represent the human-digital relationship and multiplayer games the human-to-human relationship, then VTubing sits in the middle as a unique parasocial relationship mixing digital and human interactions.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><span>Conclusion</span></h2>
<p><span>Today, anime is more than an art style, it’s a content format and cultural aesthetic that has transcended gender, race, age, and geography to become one of the largest and most profitable creative industries. Anime is also leading the way for digital play, turning previously passive consumption of linear media into a new dynamic form of entertainment. We’re excited about how anime is shaping the future of interactivity through its embrace of new technologies and business models: from AI agents to UGC platforms, from artistry tools to novel game mechanics, from interactive VTubing to new anime platforms. It’s clear that the best is yet to come for current and future anime fans.&nbsp;</span></p>

And he did it, remarkably, using little more than oil, water, and a pen. His inspiration was none other than Benjamin Franklin.</p><p>Sometime around 1770, while visiting London, Franklin became intrigued by a phenomenon he had observed during his transatlantic voyage. Specifically, he noticed that when ships discarded greasy slops into the ocean, the surrounding waves would calm. This ancient practice of oiling the seas to pacify turbulent waters was known to the Babylonians and Romans, but Franklin decided to investigate further.</p><p><span>On a windy day in London, he walked to a pond on Clapham Common. Carrying a small quantity of oil — "not more than a Tea Spoonful," according to his diary — Franklin poured it onto the agitated water. The oil spread rapidly across the surface, covering "perhaps half an Acre" of the pond and rendering its waters "as smooth as a Looking Glass." Franklin documented his observations in detail; they can be read today on the </span><a href="https://claphamsociety.com/articles/29two-american/" rel="">Clapham Society's</a><span> website.</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fce72e1d4-91cf-4c50-990c-a6854b54b669_800x600.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fce72e1d4-91cf-4c50-990c-a6854b54b669_800x600.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fce72e1d4-91cf-4c50-990c-a6854b54b669_800x600.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fce72e1d4-91cf-4c50-990c-a6854b54b669_800x600.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fce72e1d4-91cf-4c50-990c-a6854b54b669_800x600.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fce72e1d4-91cf-4c50-990c-a6854b54b669_800x600.jpeg" width="800" height="600" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/ce72e1d4-91cf-4c50-990c-a6854b54b669_800x600.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:600,&quot;width&quot;:800,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:59086,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fce72e1d4-91cf-4c50-990c-a6854b54b669_800x600.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fce72e1d4-91cf-4c50-990c-a6854b54b669_800x600.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fce72e1d4-91cf-4c50-990c-a6854b54b669_800x600.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fce72e1d4-91cf-4c50-990c-a6854b54b669_800x600.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"></picture></div></a><figcaption>Clapham Common in London.</figcaption></figure></div><p>Franklin's oil drop experiment, of course, was just one in a long line of “amateur” science experiments. He was also the first to demonstrate that lightning is electrical in nature (via his famous kite experiments), and he charted the Gulf Stream’s course across the Atlantic ocean, noting that ships traveling from America to England took longer than those going the opposite direction. His experiments at Clapham Common are not nearly as well-known.</p><p><span>But Franklin was a careful experimenter, repeating his oil drop multiple times and taking notes each time. In his journal, he opined on how much oil might be needed to calm various areas of ocean (he was thinking specifically about applications for the Royal Navy) but never grasped the </span><em>molecular implications</em><span> of his experiments. It wasn't until more than a century later that Lord Rayleigh, whose real name was John William Strutt, revisited Franklin's experiment with a brilliant new perspective.</span></p><p>An academic at the University of Cambridge and a baron by title, Rayleigh was renowned for his work in physics. The Rayleigh number, a common parameter used to describe the flow of water, is named for him; as is Rayleigh scattering, which explains how photons diffuse through the atmosphere and color the sky blue. Rayleigh also discovered the noble gas, Argon, earning a Nobel Prize for it in 1904.&nbsp;</p><p>But a little experiment that Rayleigh performed in 1890, inspired directly by Franklin's observations, is not nearly as well-known.</p><p><span>Rayleigh carefully measured a tiny volume of olive oil — 0.81 milligrams, to be exact — and placed it onto a known area of water. The oil quickly spread out and covered an area, which Rayleigh precisely measured. And then he did something that Franklin never thought of: </span><strong>Rayleigh</strong><span> </span><strong>divided the volume of the oil by the area it covered, thus estimating the thickness of the oil film.</strong><span> Assuming that the oil formed a single layer of molecules — a monolayer — then the thickness of the oil film is the same thing as the </span><em>length </em><span>of one oil molecule.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>This is how Lord Rayleigh became the first person to figure out a single molecule’s dimensions, many years before anyone could </span><em>see </em><span>such molecules.</span></p><p>Here is his equation:</p><div data-component-name="Latex"><p><span>\(Thickness = {\dfrac{Volume}{Area}} = {\dfrac{0.00081 cm^3}{\dfrac{1}{4}\pi \times (84 cm)^2}} \approx 1.63 \times 10^{-7}\)</span></p></div><p><span>Rayleigh’s final result was </span><strong>1.63 nanometers</strong><span>. Olive oil is mainly composed of fat molecules called </span><em>triacylglycerols</em><span>, and we now know that they measure about 1.67 nanometers in length, implying that Rayleigh’s “primitive” estimates were off by just 2 percent. His original paper detailing the experiment can be found </span><a href="https://damtp.cam.ac.uk/user/gold/pdfs/teaching/old_literature/Rayleigh1890.pdf" rel="">here</a><span>.</span></p><p>I love this story because it shows, at least anecdotally, how deep scientific insights can emerge from the simplest of experiments. It's a testament to the idea that you don't always need sophisticated equipment to unlock the secrets of nature — sometimes, all it takes is a drop of oil and a bit of ingenuity.</p><p><span>For those interested in delving deeper into the history of these oil drop experiments, Charles Tanford's book, </span><em><a href="https://global.oup.com/academic/product/ben-franklin-stilled-the-waves-9780192804945?cc=us&amp;lang=en&amp;" rel="">Ben Franklin Stilled the Waves</a></em><span>, offers an extensive exploration.</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F81be1d2b-1449-4b9a-b636-462ce4890599_820x494.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F81be1d2b-1449-4b9a-b636-462ce4890599_820x494.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F81be1d2b-1449-4b9a-b636-462ce4890599_820x494.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F81be1d2b-1449-4b9a-b636-462ce4890599_820x494.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F81be1d2b-1449-4b9a-b636-462ce4890599_820x494.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F81be1d2b-1449-4b9a-b636-462ce4890599_820x494.png" width="820" height="494" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/81be1d2b-1449-4b9a-b636-462ce4890599_820x494.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:494,&quot;width&quot;:820,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:626652,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F81be1d2b-1449-4b9a-b636-462ce4890599_820x494.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F81be1d2b-1449-4b9a-b636-462ce4890599_820x494.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F81be1d2b-1449-4b9a-b636-462ce4890599_820x494.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F81be1d2b-1449-4b9a-b636-462ce4890599_820x494.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption>An excerpt from Lord Rayleigh’s published manuscript.</figcaption></figure></div></div></article></div></div>]]></description>

People have become dramatically more capable over time; we can already accomplish things now that our predecessors would have believed to be impossible.</p><p>We are more capable not because of genetic change, but because we benefit from the infrastructure of society being way smarter and more capable than any one of us; in an important sense, society itself is a form of advanced intelligence. Our grandparents – and the generations that came before them – built and achieved great things. They contributed to the scaffolding of human progress that we all benefit from. AI will give people tools to solve hard problems and help us add new struts to that scaffolding that we couldn’t have figured out on our own. The story of progress will continue, and our children will be able to do things we can’t.</p><p>It won’t happen all at once, but we’ll soon be able to work with AI that helps us accomplish much more than we ever could without AI; eventually we can each have a personal AI team, full of virtual experts in different areas, working together to create almost anything we can imagine. Our children will have virtual tutors who can provide personalized instruction in any subject, in any language, and at whatever pace they need. We can imagine similar ideas for better healthcare, the ability to create any kind of software someone can imagine, and much more.</p><p>With these new abilities, we can have shared prosperity to a degree that seems unimaginable today; in the future, everyone’s lives can be better than anyone’s life is now. Prosperity alone doesn’t necessarily make people happy – there are plenty of miserable rich people – but it would meaningfully improve the lives of people around the world.</p><p>Here is one narrow way to look at human history: after thousands of years of compounding scientific discovery and technological progress, we have figured out how to melt sand, add some impurities, arrange it with astonishing precision at extraordinarily tiny scale into computer chips, run energy through it, and end up with systems capable of creating increasingly capable artificial intelligence.</p><p>This may turn out to be the most consequential fact about all of history so far. It is possible that we will have superintelligence in a few thousand days (!); it may take longer, but I’m confident we’ll get there.</p><p>How did we get to the doorstep of the next leap in prosperity?</p><p>In three words: deep learning worked.</p><p>In 15 words: deep learning worked, got predictably better with scale, and we dedicated increasing resources to it.</p><p>That’s really it; humanity discovered an algorithm that could really, truly learn any distribution of data (or really, the underlying “rules” that produce any distribution of data). To a shocking degree of precision, the more compute and data available, the better it gets at helping people solve hard problems. I find that no matter how much time I spend thinking about this, I can never really internalize how consequential it is.</p><p>There are a lot of details we still have to figure out, but it’s a mistake to get distracted by any particular challenge. Deep learning works, and we will solve the remaining problems. We can say a lot of things about what may happen next, but the main one is that AI is going to get better with scale, and that will lead to meaningful improvements to the lives of people around the world.</p><p>AI models will soon serve as autonomous personal assistants who carry out specific tasks on our behalf like coordinating medical care on your behalf. At some point further down the road, AI systems are going to get so good that they help us make better next-generation systems and make scientific progress across the board.</p><p>Technology brought us from the Stone Age to the Agricultural Age and then to the Industrial Age. From here, the path to the Intelligence Age is paved with compute, energy, and human will.</p><p>If we want to put AI into the hands of as many people as possible, we need to drive down the cost of compute and make it abundant (which requires lots of energy and chips). If we don’t build enough infrastructure, AI will be a very limited resource that wars get fought over and that becomes mostly a tool for rich people.</p><p>We need to act wisely but with conviction. The dawn of the Intelligence Age is a momentous development with very complex and extremely high-stakes challenges. It will not be an entirely positive story, but the upside is so tremendous that we owe it to ourselves, and the future, to figure out how to navigate the risks in front of us.</p><p>I believe the future is going to be so bright that no one can do it justice by trying to write about it now; a defining characteristic of the Intelligence Age will be massive prosperity.</p><p>Although it will happen incrementally, astounding triumphs – fixing the climate, establishing a space colony, and the discovery of all of physics – will eventually become commonplace. With nearly-limitless intelligence and abundant energy – the ability to generate great ideas, and the ability to make them happen – we can do quite a lot.</p><p>As we have seen with other technologies, there will also be downsides, and we need to start working now to maximize AI’s benefits while minimizing its harms. As one example, we expect that this technology can cause a significant change in labor markets (good and bad) in the coming years, but most jobs will change more slowly than most people think, and I have no fear that we’ll run out of things to do (even if they don’t look like “real jobs” to us today). People have an innate desire to create and to be useful to each other, and AI will allow us to amplify our own abilities like never before. As a society, we will be back in an expanding world, and we can again focus on playing positive-sum games.</p><p>Many of the jobs we do today would have looked like trifling wastes of time to people a few hundred years ago, but nobody is looking back at the past, wishing they were a lamplighter. If a lamplighter could see the world today, he would think the prosperity all around him was unimaginable. And if we could fast-forward a hundred years from today, the prosperity all around us would feel just as unimaginable.</p></div></section></div>]]></description>
