<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
          
          
<p>Emails discussing torrenting prove that Meta knew it was "illegal," authors alleged. And Bashlykov's warnings seemingly landed on deaf ears, with authors alleging that evidence showed Meta chose to instead hide its torrenting as best it could while downloading and seeding terabytes of data from multiple shadow libraries as recently as April 2024.</p>
<h2>Meta allegedly concealed seeding</h2>
<p>Supposedly, Meta tried to conceal the seeding by not using Facebook servers while downloading the dataset to "avoid" the "risk" of anyone "tracing back the seeder/downloader" from Facebook servers, an <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.415175/gov.uscourts.cand.415175.417.9.pdf">internal message</a> from Meta researcher Frank Zhang said, while describing the work as in "stealth mode." Meta also allegedly modified settings "so that the smallest amount of seeding possible could occur," a Meta executive in charge of project management, Michael Clark, said in a <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.415175/gov.uscourts.cand.415175.417.8.pdf">deposition</a>.</p>
<p>Now that new information has come to light, authors claim that Meta staff involved in the decision to torrent LibGen must be deposed again, because allegedly the new facts "contradict prior deposition testimony."</p>
<p>Mark Zuckerberg, for example, claimed to have no involvement in decisions to use LibGen to train AI models. But unredacted messages show the "decision to use LibGen occurred" after "a prior escalation to MZ," authors alleged.</p>
<p>Meta did not immediately respond to Ars' request for comment and has maintained throughout the litigation that AI training on LibGen was "fair use."</p>
<p>However, Meta has previously addressed its torrenting in a <a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Kadrey-v-Meta-motion-to-dismiss-1-31-25.pdf">motion to dismiss</a> filed last month, telling the court that "plaintiffs do not plead a single instance in which any part of any book was, in fact, downloaded by a third party from Meta via torrent, much less that Plaintiffs’ books were somehow distributed by Meta."</p>
<p>While Meta may be confident in its legal strategy despite the new torrenting wrinkle, the social media company has seemingly complicated its case by allowing authors to expand the distribution theory that's key to winning a direct copyright infringement claim beyond just claiming that Meta's AI outputs unlawfully distributed their works.</p>
<p>As limited discovery on Meta's seeding now proceeds, Meta is not fighting the seeding aspect of the direct copyright infringement claim at this time, telling the court that it plans to "set... the record straight and debunk... this meritless allegation on summary judgment."</p>

<p dir="auto">I am labelling this as a <strong>bug</strong> because this behavior is unexpected and undocumented.</p>
<p dir="auto">I guess you might be embarrassed by what your AI says when it autocompletes gender related matters since it is probably trained on biased datasets. However disabling autocompletion is not a great solution since gender can be very present in :</p>
<ul dir="auto">

</ul>
<p dir="auto">For which Copilot shutting down on most of the files is deceptive and pretty annoying.</p>
<p dir="auto">I don't have any elegant solution in mind and I know this seems like an edge case, but I hope this will be taken into account someday.</p>

Just trees, a few roughly built cement buildings, and a long-running civil war which has left this area of Myanmar one of the poorest places on earth. But today, on this spot along the border with Thailand, a small city has emerged like a mirage. It is called Shwe Kokko, or Golden Raintree.</p><p>It is accused of being a city built on scams, home to a lucrative yet deadly nexus of fraud, money-laundering and human trafficking. The man behind it, She Zhijiang, is languishing in a Bangkok jail, awaiting extradition to China.</p><p>But Yatai, She Zhijiang's company which built the city, paints a very different vision of Shwe Kokko in its promotional videos – as a resort city, a safe holiday destination for Chinese tourists and haven for the super-rich.</p><p>The story of Shwe Kokko is also one of the unbridled ambition which has rippled out of China in the last two decades.</p><p>She Zhijiang dreamed of building this glittering city as his ticket out of the shadowy world of scams and gambling which he inhabited.</p><p>But by aiming so high he has drawn the attention of Beijing, which is now keen to stamp out the fraud operations along the Thai-Myanmar border which are increasingly targeting Chinese people.</p></div><div data-component="image-block"><figure><p><span><picture><source srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/240/cpsprodpb/2536/live/f821ba70-e502-11ef-be41-9d8a7ab0ece0.jpg.webp 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/320/cpsprodpb/2536/live/f821ba70-e502-11ef-be41-9d8a7ab0ece0.jpg.webp 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/2536/live/f821ba70-e502-11ef-be41-9d8a7ab0ece0.jpg.webp 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/624/cpsprodpb/2536/live/f821ba70-e502-11ef-be41-9d8a7ab0ece0.jpg.webp 624w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/800/cpsprodpb/2536/live/f821ba70-e502-11ef-be41-9d8a7ab0ece0.jpg.webp 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/976/cpsprodpb/2536/live/f821ba70-e502-11ef-be41-9d8a7ab0ece0.jpg.webp 976w" type="image/webp"><img alt="Tall buildings in Myanmar's Myawaddy seen from Thailand's border, where armed guards stand on a bridge  " loading="lazy" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/1504/cpsprodpb/2536/live/f821ba70-e502-11ef-be41-9d8a7ab0ece0.jpg" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/240/cpsprodpb/2536/live/f821ba70-e502-11ef-be41-9d8a7ab0ece0.jpg 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/320/cpsprodpb/2536/live/f821ba70-e502-11ef-be41-9d8a7ab0ece0.jpg 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/2536/live/f821ba70-e502-11ef-be41-9d8a7ab0ece0.jpg 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/624/cpsprodpb/2536/live/f821ba70-e502-11ef-be41-9d8a7ab0ece0.jpg 624w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/800/cpsprodpb/2536/live/f821ba70-e502-11ef-be41-9d8a7ab0ece0.jpg 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/976/cpsprodpb/2536/live/f821ba70-e502-11ef-be41-9d8a7ab0ece0.jpg 976w" width="1504" height="847.0107526881721"></picture></span><span role="text"><span>Image source, </span>Jonathan Head/BBC</span></p><figcaption><span>Image caption, </span><p>New high-rises on the Myanmar side are visible from Thailand's border</p></figcaption></figure></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Publicity about the scams is also hurting Thai tourism – Thailand is shutting down power to compounds over the border, toughening its banking rules and promising to block visas for those suspected of using Thailand as a transit route.</p><p>Shwe Kokko has been left marooned in post-coup, war-wracked Myanmar, unable to bring in the flow of investment and visitors it needs to keep going.</p><p>Yatai is trying to fix the city's sinister image by allowing journalists to see it, holding out hope that more favourable reporting might even get She Zhijiang out of jail.</p><p>So they invited the BBC to Shwe Kokko.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Getting there is tricky.</p><p>Ever since construction began in 2017, Shwe Kokko has been a forbidden place, off-limits to casual visitors.</p><p>As the civil war in Myanmar escalated after the 2021 military coup, access became even more difficult. It takes three days from the country's commercial hub Yangon – through multiple checkpoints, blocked roads and a real risk of getting caught in armed skirmishes. Crossing from Thailand takes just a few minutes, but requires careful planning to avoid Thai police and army patrols.</p><p>She Zhijiang's colleagues took us on a tour, highlighting the newly paved streets, the luxury villas, the trees – "Mr She believes in making a green city," they told us. Our guide was Wang Fugui, who said he was a former police officer from Guangxi in southern China. He ended up in prison in Thailand, on what he insists were trumped-up fraud charges. There he got to know She Zhijiang and became one of his most trusted lieutenants.</p><p>At first glance, Shwe Kokko has the appearance of a provincial Chinese city. The signs on the buildings are written in Chinese characters, and there is a constant procession of Chinese-made construction vehicles going to and from building sites.</p></div><div data-component="image-block"><figure><p><span><picture><source srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/240/cpsprodpb/921c/live/d47c9ae0-e4ee-11ef-96f0-05bccc1c0c08.jpg.webp 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/320/cpsprodpb/921c/live/d47c9ae0-e4ee-11ef-96f0-05bccc1c0c08.jpg.webp 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/921c/live/d47c9ae0-e4ee-11ef-96f0-05bccc1c0c08.jpg.webp 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/624/cpsprodpb/921c/live/d47c9ae0-e4ee-11ef-96f0-05bccc1c0c08.jpg.webp 624w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/800/cpsprodpb/921c/live/d47c9ae0-e4ee-11ef-96f0-05bccc1c0c08.jpg.webp 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/976/cpsprodpb/921c/live/d47c9ae0-e4ee-11ef-96f0-05bccc1c0c08.jpg.webp 976w" type="image/webp"><img alt="A man riding past a red sign saying 'Let's build a beautiful home together'  " loading="lazy" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/1504/cpsprodpb/921c/live/d47c9ae0-e4ee-11ef-96f0-05bccc1c0c08.jpg" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/240/cpsprodpb/921c/live/d47c9ae0-e4ee-11ef-96f0-05bccc1c0c08.jpg 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/320/cpsprodpb/921c/live/d47c9ae0-e4ee-11ef-96f0-05bccc1c0c08.jpg 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/921c/live/d47c9ae0-e4ee-11ef-96f0-05bccc1c0c08.jpg 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/624/cpsprodpb/921c/live/d47c9ae0-e4ee-11ef-96f0-05bccc1c0c08.jpg 624w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/800/cpsprodpb/921c/live/d47c9ae0-e4ee-11ef-96f0-05bccc1c0c08.jpg 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/976/cpsprodpb/921c/live/d47c9ae0-e4ee-11ef-96f0-05bccc1c0c08.jpg 976w" width="1504" height="846.5081081081081"></picture></span><span role="text"><span>Image source, </span>Jonathan Head/ BBC</span></p><figcaption><span>Image caption, </span><p>With signs written in Chinese characters, Yatai has the appearance of a Chinese city</p></figcaption></figure></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Yatai is vague about the tenants of all its buildings, as it is about many things.

We saw very few of the overseas visitors who are supposed to be the customers of the hotels and casinos.</p><p>Yatai says there are no more scams in Shwe Kokko. It has put up huge billboards all over town proclaiming, in Chinese, Burmese and English, that forced labour was not allowed, and that "online businesses" should leave. But we were quietly told by local people that the scam business was still running.</p><p>Starting a decade ago in the unchecked frenzy of Chinese investment on the Cambodian coast, then moving to the lawless badlands of Myanmar's border with China, the scam operators have now settled along the Thai-Myanmar border. Around them, the Myanmar military and a hotch-potch of rebel armies and warlords are fighting for control of Karen State.</p><p>The scams have grown into a multi-billion dollar business. They involve thousands of workers from China, South East Asia, Africa and the Indian subcontinent kept in walled-off compounds where they defraud people all over the world of their savings.</p><p>Some work there willingly, but others are abducted and forced to work.

He lives with Wang Fugui in a sprawling villa they have built on the banks of the Moei River, overlooking Thailand, and guarded by massive Chinese bodyguards. There they play mahjong, eat the finest food and drink, and keep an eye on business.</p><p>Mr He has a slightly different explanation from his boss for the scams still operating under their noses. "We are just property developers," he said. "I can guarantee that this kind of thing does not happen here. </p><p>"But even if it does, the local people have their own legal system, so it is their job to deal with it. Our job is just to provide good infrastructure, good buildings and supporting industries."</p><p>But there is no legal system in this part of Myanmar, nor any government. It is ruled by the various armed groups which control different bits of territory along the Thai border. </p><p>Their commanders decide who can build or run a business, taking their cut to help fund their wars against the Myanmar military, or against each other. Many of them are known to be hosting scam compounds.</p><p>Mr He admitted that it was the war which had allowed Yatai to obtain the land so cheaply. Karen human rights groups have accused Saw Chit Thu of driving the original inhabitants off their land, with minimal compensation, though it is clear Yatai is also providing badly needed jobs for the locals.</p><p>It is the lawlessness of Karen State which makes it so appealing to illegal businesses – and that doesn't help the image of Shwe Kokko.</p></div><div data-component="image-block"><figure><p><span><picture><source srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/240/cpsprodpb/c7ec/live/6307e2b0-e481-11ef-9332-6d8408b4920e.jpg.webp 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/320/cpsprodpb/c7ec/live/6307e2b0-e481-11ef-9332-6d8408b4920e.jpg.webp 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/c7ec/live/6307e2b0-e481-11ef-9332-6d8408b4920e.jpg.webp 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/624/cpsprodpb/c7ec/live/6307e2b0-e481-11ef-9332-6d8408b4920e.jpg.webp 624w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/800/cpsprodpb/c7ec/live/6307e2b0-e481-11ef-9332-6d8408b4920e.jpg.webp 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/976/cpsprodpb/c7ec/live/6307e2b0-e481-11ef-9332-6d8408b4920e.jpg.webp 976w" type="image/webp"><img alt="He Yingxiong who is running Shwe Kokko stands in front of a wooden fence with a field and city in the background" loading="lazy" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/999/cpsprodpb/c7ec/live/6307e2b0-e481-11ef-9332-6d8408b4920e.jpg" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/240/cpsprodpb/c7ec/live/6307e2b0-e481-11ef-9332-6d8408b4920e.jpg 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/320/cpsprodpb/c7ec/live/6307e2b0-e481-11ef-9332-6d8408b4920e.jpg 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/c7ec/live/6307e2b0-e481-11ef-9332-6d8408b4920e.jpg 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/624/cpsprodpb/c7ec/live/6307e2b0-e481-11ef-9332-6d8408b4920e.jpg 624w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/800/cpsprodpb/c7ec/live/6307e2b0-e481-11ef-9332-6d8408b4920e.jpg 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/976/cpsprodpb/c7ec/live/6307e2b0-e481-11ef-9332-6d8408b4920e.jpg 976w" width="999" height="562.4369999999999"></picture></span><span role="text"><span>Image source, </span>Jonathan Head/BBC</span></p><figcaption><span>Image caption, </span><p>He Yingxiong is runnning Shwe Kokko in She Zhijiang's absence...</p></figcaption></figure></div><div data-component="image-block"><figure><p><span><picture><source srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/240/cpsprodpb/355c/live/79c29580-e504-11ef-90e8-2df96be3dcde.jpg.webp 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/320/cpsprodpb/355c/live/79c29580-e504-11ef-90e8-2df96be3dcde.jpg.webp 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/355c/live/79c29580-e504-11ef-90e8-2df96be3dcde.jpg.webp 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/624/cpsprodpb/355c/live/79c29580-e504-11ef-90e8-2df96be3dcde.jpg.webp 624w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/800/cpsprodpb/355c/live/79c29580-e504-11ef-90e8-2df96be3dcde.jpg.webp 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/976/cpsprodpb/355c/live/79c29580-e504-11ef-90e8-2df96be3dcde.jpg.webp 976w" type="image/webp"><img alt="A view of the villa that is being used by He Yingxiong who is currently running Shwe Kokko.

        <p>Today we released our <a href="https://source.coop/repositories/harvard-lil/gov-data/description">archive of data.gov</a> on Source Cooperative. The 16TB collection includes over 311,000 datasets harvested during 2024 and 2025, a complete archive of federal public datasets linked by data.gov. It will be updated daily as new datasets are added to data.gov.</p>

<p>This is the first release in our new <a href="https://lil.law.harvard.edu/blog/2025/01/30/preserving-public-u-s-federal-data/">data vault project</a> to preserve and authenticate vital public datasets for academic research, policymaking, and public use.</p>

<p>We’ve built this project on our long-standing commitment to preserving government records and making public information available to everyone. Libraries play an essential role in safeguarding the integrity of digital information. By preserving detailed metadata and establishing digital signatures for authenticity and provenance, we make it easier for researchers and the public to cite and access the information they need over time.</p>

<p>In addition to the data collection, we are releasing <a href="https://github.com/harvard-lil/data-vault">open source software and documentation</a> for replicating our work and creating similar repositories. With these tools, we aim not only to preserve knowledge ourselves but also to empower others to save and access the data that matters to them.</p>

<p>For suggestions and collaboration on future releases, please contact us at lil@law.harvard.edu.</p>

<p>This project builds on our work with the <a href="https://perma.cc/">Perma.cc</a> web archiving tool used by courts, law journals, and law firms; the <a href="https://case.law/">Caselaw Access Project</a>, sharing all precedential cases of the United States; and our research on <a href="https://lil.law.harvard.edu/century-scale-storage/">Century Scale Storage</a>. This work is made possible with support from the Filecoin Foundation for the Decentralized Web and the Rockefeller Brothers Fund.</p>

  <div><p><span>If you’re fed up with Meta right now, you’re not alone. Google searches for deleting Facebook and Instagram </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/09/google-searches-for-deleting-facebook-instagram-explode-after-meta-ends-fact-checking/"><span>spiked last week</span></a><span> after Meta announced its latest policy changes.

Meta tracks your activity across millions of websites and apps, regardless of whether you use its platforms, and it profits from that data through targeted ads. If you want to limit Meta’s ability to collect and profit from your personal data, here’s what you need to know.</span></p>
<h3><span>Meta’s Business Model Relies on Your Personal Data</span></h3>
<p><span>You might think of Meta as a social media company, but its primary business is </span><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2023/05/save-news-we-must-ban-surveillance-advertising"><span>surveillance advertising</span></a><span>. Meta’s </span><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/11/after-facebook-leaks-here-what-should-come-next"><span>business model</span></a><span> relies on collecting as much information as possible about people in order to sell highly-targeted ads. That’s why Meta is </span><a href="https://duckduckgo.github.io/tracker-radar-wiki/"><span>one of the main companies</span></a><span> tracking you across the internet—monitoring your activity far beyond its own platforms. When Apple introduced changes to make tracking harder on iPhones, </span><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/kateoflahertyuk/2021/11/06/apples-new-iphone-privacy-features-cost-facebook-10-billion/"><span>Meta lost billions in revenue</span></a><span>, demonstrating just how valuable your personal data is to its business.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><span>How Meta Harvests Your Personal Data</span></h3>
<p><span>Meta’s tracking tools are embedded in </span><a href="https://trends.builtwith.com/analytics/Facebook-Pixel"><span>millions</span></a><span> of </span><a href="https://themarkup.org/newsletter/hello-world/facebooks-pervasive-pixel"><span>websites</span></a><span> and </span><a href="https://privacyinternational.org/report/2647/how-apps-android-share-data-facebook-report"><span>apps</span></a><span>, so you can’t escape the company’s surveillance just by avoiding or deleting Facebook and Instagram. Meta’s tracking pixel, found on </span><a href="https://themarkup.org/newsletter/hello-world/facebooks-pervasive-pixel"><span>30% of the world’s most popular websites</span></a><span>, monitors people’s behavior across the web and can expose sensitive information, including </span><a href="https://themarkup.org/pixel-hunt/2022/04/28/applied-for-student-aid-online-facebook-saw-you"><span>financial</span></a><span> and </span><a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2023/03/ftc-ban-betterhelp-revealing-consumers-data-including-sensitive-mental-health-information-facebook"><span>mental</span></a> <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2024/04/proposed-ftc-order-will-prohibit-telehealth-firm-cerebral-using-or-disclosing-sensitive-data"><span>health</span></a><span> data. </span><a href="https://themarkup.org/newsletter/hello-world/facebooks-pervasive-pixel"><span>A 2022 investigation by </span><i><span>The Markup</span></i></a><span> found that a third of the top U.S. hospitals had sent sensitive patient information to Meta through its tracking pixel.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Meta’s surveillance isn’t limited to your online activity. The company also </span><a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/help/1142103235885551?id=565900110447546"><span>encourages businesses</span></a><span> to send them data about your offline purchases and interactions. Even deleting your Facebook and Instagram accounts won’t stop Meta from harvesting your personal data. Meta in 2018 admitted to </span><a href="https://www.vox.com/2018/4/20/17254312/facebook-shadow-profiles-data-collection-non-users-mark-zuckerberg"><span>collecting information about non-users</span></a><span>, including their contact details and browsing history.</span></p>
<h3><span>Take These Steps to Limit How Meta Profits From Your Personal Data</span></h3>
<p><span>Although Meta’s surveillance systems are pervasive, there are ways to limit how Meta collects and uses your personal data.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h4><span>Update Your Meta Account Settings</span></h4>
<p><span>Open your Instagram or Facebook app and navigate to the </span><b><i>Accounts Center</i></b><span> page.&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>You’ll find a link to </span><b><i>Accounts Center</i></b><span> on the </span><b><i>Settings</i></b><span> pages of both apps. If you have trouble finding </span><b><i>Accounts Center</i></b><span>, check Meta’s help pages for </span><a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/247395082112892?cms_platform=www&amp;helpref=platform_switcher"><span>Facebook</span></a><span> and </span><a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/instagram/245100253430454"><span>Instagram</span></a><span>.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span>If you use a web browser instead of Meta’s apps, visit </span><a href="http://accountscenter.facebook.com/"><span>accountscenter.facebook.com</span></a><span> or </span><a href="http://accountscenter.instagram.com/"><span>accountscenter.instagram.com</span></a><span>.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span><img src="https://www.eff.org/files/2025/01/17/metaaccountscenteroutlined.png" width="2154" height="1120" alt="A screenshot of the Meta Accounts Center page. " title="A screenshot of the Meta Accounts Center page. "></span></p>
<p><span>If your Facebook and Instagram accounts are linked on your </span><b><i>Accounts Center</i></b><span> page, you only have to update&nbsp;the following&nbsp;settings once. If not, you’ll have to update them separately for Facebook and Instagram. Once you find your way to the </span><b><i>Accounts Center</i></b><span>, the directions below are the same for both platforms.</span></p>
<p><span>Meta makes it harder than it should be to find and update these settings. The following steps are accurate at the time of publication, but Meta often changes their settings and adds additional steps. The exact language below may not match what Meta displays in your region, but you should have a setting controlling each of the following permissions.</span></p>
<p>Once you’re on the “Accounts Center” page, make the following changes:</p>
<p><strong>1) Stop Meta from targeting ads based on data it collects about you on other apps and websites:&nbsp;</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Click the <b><i>Ad preferences </i></b><span>option under Accounts Center, then select the </span><b><i>Manage Info</i></b><span> tab (this tab may be called </span><b><i>Ad settings</i></b><span> depending on your location). Click the </span><b><i>Activity information from ad partners</i></b><span> option, then </span><b><i>Review Setting</i></b><span>. Select the option for </span><b><i>No, don’t make my ads more relevant by using this information</i></b><span> and click the “Confirm” button when prompted.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span><img src="https://www.eff.org/files/2025/01/17/adpartnerinfo.png" width="2474" height="1538" alt="A screenshot of the &quot;Activity information from ad partners&quot; setting with the &quot;No&quot; option selected" title="A screenshot of the &quot;Activity information from ad partners&quot; setting with the &quot;No&quot; option selected"></span></p>
<p><strong>2) Stop Meta from using your data (from Facebook and Instagram) to help advertisers target you on other apps.</strong>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/119468292028768">Meta’s ad network</a> connects advertisers with other apps through <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2025/01/online-behavioral-ads-fuel-surveillance-industry-heres-how">privacy-invasive ad auctions</a>—generating more money and data for Meta in the process.</p>
<blockquote><p><span>Back on the </span><b><i>Ad preferences</i></b><span> page, click the </span><b><i>Manage info</i></b><span> tab again (called </span><b><i>Ad settings</i></b><span> depending on your location), </span><span>then select the </span><b><i>Ads shown outside of Meta </i></b><span>setting, select </span><b><i>Not allowed</i></b><span> and then click the “X” button to close the pop-up.</span></p>
<p>Depending on your location, this setting will be called <b><i>Ads from ad partners </i></b>on the <b><i>Manage info </i></b>tab.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="https://www.eff.org/files/2025/01/17/adsoutsidemeta.png" width="2490" height="1236" alt="A screenshot of the &quot;Ads outside Meta&quot; setting with the &quot;Not allowed&quot; option selected" title="A screenshot of the &quot;Ads outside Meta&quot; setting with the &quot;Not allowed&quot; option selected"></p>
<p><strong>3) Disconnect the data that other companies share with Meta about you from your account:</strong></p>
<blockquote><p><span>From the </span><b><i>Accounts Center</i></b><span> screen, click the </span><b><i>Your information and permissions</i></b><span> option, followed by </span><b><i>Your activity off Meta technologies</i></b><span>, then </span><b><i>Manage future activity</i></b><span>. On this screen, choose the option to </span><b><i>Disconnect future activity</i></b><span>, followed by the </span><b><i>Continue</i></b><span> button, then confirm one more time by clicking the </span><b><i>Disconnect future activity</i></b><span> button. </span><b>Note</b><span>: This may take up to 48 hours to take effect.</span></p>
<p><span><b>Note: </b>This will also clear previous activity, which might log you out of apps and websites you’ve signed into through Facebook.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span><img src="https://www.eff.org/files/2025/01/17/disconnectactivity.png" width="2448" height="1292" alt="A screenshot of the &quot;Manage future activity&quot; setting with the &quot;Disconnect future activity&quot; option selected" title="A screenshot of the &quot;Manage future activity&quot; setting with the &quot;Disconnect future activity&quot; option selected"></span></p>
<p><span>While these settings </span><i><span>limit</span></i><span> how Meta uses your data, they won’t necessarily stop the company from collecting it and potentially using it for other purposes.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h4><span>Install Privacy Badger to Block Meta’s Trackers</span></h4>
<p><a href="https://privacybadger.org/"><span>Privacy Badger</span></a><span> is a free browser extension by EFF that blocks trackers—like Meta’s pixel—from loading on websites you visit. It also replaces embedded Facebook posts, Like buttons, and Share buttons with </span><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2024/01/privacy-badger-puts-you-control-widgets"><span>click-to-activate placeholders</span></a><span>, blocking another way that Meta tracks you. The next version of Privacy Badger (coming next week) will extend this protection to embedded Instagram and Threads posts, which also send your data to Meta.</span></p>
<p><span>Visit </span><a href="https://privacybadger.org/"><span>privacybadger.org</span></a><span> to install Privacy Badger on your web browser. Currently, Firefox on Android is the only mobile browser that supports Privacy Badger.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h4><span>Limit Meta’s Tracking on Your Phone</span></h4>
<p><span>Take these additional steps on your mobile device:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Disable your phone’s advertising ID</b><span> to make it harder for Meta to track what you do across apps. Follow EFF’s instructions for doing this on your </span><a href="https://ssd.eff.org/module/how-to-get-to-know-iphone-privacy-and-security-settings#disable-ad-tracking"><span>iPhone</span></a><span> or </span><a href="https://ssd.eff.org/module/how-to-get-to-know-android-privacy-and-security-settings#disable-ad-tracking"><span>Android</span></a><span> device.</span></li>
<li><b>Turn off location access for Meta’s apps</b><span>. Meta doesn’t need to know where you are all the time to function, and you can safely disable location access without affecting how the Facebook and Instagram apps work. Review this setting using EFF’s guides for your </span><a href="https://ssd.eff.org/module/how-to-get-to-know-iphone-privacy-and-security-settings#audit-your-privacy-permissions"><span>iPhone</span></a><span> or </span><a href="https://ssd.eff.org/module/how-to-get-to-know-android-privacy-and-security-settings#audit-your-privacy-permissions"><span>Android</span></a><span> device.</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><span>The Real Solution: Strong Privacy Legislation</span></h3>
<p><span>Stopping a company you distrust from profiting off your personal data shouldn’t require tinkering with hidden settings and installing browser extensions. Instead, your data should be private by default. That’s why we need </span><a href="https://www.eff.org/wp/privacy-first-better-way-address-online-harms#Legislation"><span>strong federal privacy legislation</span></a><span> that puts you—not Meta—in control of your information.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Without strong privacy legislation, Meta will <a href="https://mashable.com/article/iphone-apps-push-notifications-data-collection-report">keep</a> <a href="https://petsymposium.org/popets/2024/popets-2024-0086.pdf">finding</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/15/consent-or-pay-open-letter-edpb/?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAF-zi8O-D6A1dZPGbzlMH8M_d2Zl2b4EXKjC3wbwlYJ9BuGp_0wNdFm57oh3xyaEyTq8SVGrJv2QVO1uylN0roSaotvmBvW9gBLtFJK_kAcJnCQm7nouxWpLqSl6wEmuAp8uDYT3eaD8c71sXwPC9p-ZZPISupt7P3t7GdRmejbw">ways</a> to bypass your privacy protections and monetize your personal data. Privacy is about more than safeguarding your sensitive information—it’s about having the power to prevent companies like Meta from exploiting your personal data for profit.</span></p>

            <span>Abstract:</span>Self-play has powered breakthroughs in two-player and multi-player games. Here we show that self-play is a surprisingly effective strategy in another domain. We show that robust and naturalistic driving emerges entirely from self-play in simulation at unprecedented scale -- 1.6~billion~km of driving. This is enabled by Gigaflow, a batched simulator that can synthesize and train on 42 years of subjective driving experience per hour on a single 8-GPU node. The resulting policy achieves state-of-the-art performance on three independent autonomous driving benchmarks. The policy outperforms the prior state of the art when tested on recorded real-world scenarios, amidst human drivers, without ever seeing human data during training. The policy is realistic when assessed against human references and achieves unprecedented robustness, averaging 17.5 years of continuous driving between incidents in simulation.

The first is pro-density, which believes in dense, centralized cities that function through complex mass-transit systems and clusters of skyscrapers. This is the pro-city crowd. The second is the anti-density camp, which believes in de-centralized, spread-out networks of neighborhoods that rely on automobiles and low buildings. This is the pro-suburb crowd. Modern architect Frank Lloyd Wright was an outspoken member of the latter camp, and his visionary <em>Broadacre City</em> project is a model suburb, with low buildings and green space prioritized over tall buildings and density.</p><p>In addition to his anti-city stance, Wright is famous for his <em>organic</em> approach to architecture, which is based on a building’s intimate connection to its surroundings. Organic buildings respond to their context and should be unique to their site. The antithesis of this is a design that can be built anywhere and is out-of-context. This includes skyscrapers and tall buildings in general. With this in mind, it’s hard to believe the tower design pictured above came from Wright. It’s called <em>The Illinois</em>, and it was planned to be a mile (1,609 meters, or 5,280 feet) in height. That’s more than four times the height of the Empire State Building, and nearly twice the height of the Burj Dubai.</p></div><div data-test="image-block-inline-outer-wrapper" data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1609599376423_7697">

<p>Wright’s justification for the project was quite clever. He argued that the sheer size of The Illinois would encapsulate an entire city within a single building, which would kill two birds with one stone. It would provide the density that people crave, while freeing up the surrounding landscape for his Broadacre City plan, with its parks and low buildings. Essentially, Wright was using the <em>if you can’t beat ‘em, join ‘em</em> mentality when it came to the city. Give ‘em their density so they can come together, but concentrate it into one massive structure and surround it with your larger vision for the world-as-one-big-suburb. He envisioned skyscrapers like this built here and there throughout the countryside, taking the place of cities. That way, everyone could live in a suburban paradise, surrounded by green space and ample daylight.</p>

<p>The tower itself had a tripod-like design, with three wings of structure and a central core. This tripod, combined with a tapered form that came to a point at the tower’s summit, were used by Wright to shed wind forces. At the base, Wright used his <em>taproot</em> foundation design that took inspiration from a tree. He had previously used it for another of his tower designs, the S.C. Johnson Research Tower. The foundation, much like the tower, burrows into the earth and progresses down to a point at its base.</p>

  <p>It’s telling that an architect as outwardly anti-density as Wright would put in a design for the world’s tallest building. It’s also telling that he went a step further and designed a <em>mile-high</em> building, which is far and away taller than any other building ever built. This suggests two theories about his motivations. First, he exaggerated the height of The Illinois so much because he was trying to point out the absurdity of the tall building race and skyscrapers in general. This wink-wink approach seems a bit far-fetched, but still believable considering Wright’s massive ego. Second, and much more believable, is that Wright was silently acknowledging the need for humanity to achieve verticality, even if it ran contrary to his beliefs about the city. After all, he was no stranger to the building type; his previous tower designs include the S.C. Johnson Research Tower, Saint Mark’s Tower, and Price Tower. In addition, he’s quoted as saying that <em>towers have always been erected by humankind - it seems to gratify humanity’s ambition somehow and they are beautiful and picturesque.</em>[1] This is Wright acknowledging the human need for verticality, and his design for The Illinois is evidence that even those of us who are anti-density still have this need within themselves.</p>

<p dir="auto">Applying the ideas of <a href="https://github.com/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1">Deepseek R1</a> and <a href="https://github.com/huggingface/open-r1">Open R1</a> to computer use.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Overview</h2><a id="user-content-overview" aria-label="Permalink: Overview" href="#overview"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">r1-computer-use is an experimental project that applies large-scale Reinforcement Learning techniques similar to DeepSeek-R1 to computer usage scenarios. The primary goal is to train an agent to interact with a computer environment (e.g., file system, web browser, command line) while utilizing a neural reward model to validate the correctness of the agent’s actions and reason about intermediate steps.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Architecture</h2><a id="user-content-architecture" aria-label="Permalink: Architecture" href="#architecture"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">DeepSeek-R1 has shown that large language models can develop powerful reasoning skills through iterative reward optimization. Traditionally, such projects rely on hard verifiers or rule-based scripts to determine correctness in tasks like math or coding. However, these methods are too difficult to reproduce at scale for general computer usage.</p>
<p dir="auto">We aim to replace hard-coded verifiers with a neural reward model that itself reasons about whether or not the agent’s actions are correct or helpful.</p>
<p dir="auto">Both the actor and reward models follow a three-step cycle which can be seen as an extention of <a href="https://react-lm.github.io/" rel="nofollow">ReACT</a> into reinforcement learning.</p>

<p dir="auto">You can set as many API keys as you'd like; allowed API keys are those that start with <code>SCRAPER_API_KEY</code>. For example, here is a <code>.env</code> file that has three available keys:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="SCRAPER_API_KEY=should-be-secret

<p dir="auto">The root path <code>/</code> returns status 200 if online, plus some Gilbert and Sullivan lyrics (you can go there in your browser to see if it's online).</p>
<p dir="auto">The only other path is <code>/scrape</code>, to which you send a JSON formatted POST request and (if all things go well) receive a <code>multipart/mixed</code> type response.</p>
<p dir="auto">The response will be either:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Status 200: <code>multipart/mixed</code> response where the first part is type <code>application/json</code> with information about the request; the second part is the website data (usually <code>text/html</code>); and the remaining parts are up to 5 screenshots.</li>
<li>Not status 200: <code>application/json</code> response with an error message under the "error" key.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Here's a sample cURL request:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="curl -X POST &quot;http://localhost:5006/scrape&quot;
    -H &quot;Content-Type: application/json&quot;
    -d '{&quot;url&quot;: &quot;https://us.ai&quot;}'"><pre><code>curl -X POST "http://localhost:5006/scrape"
    -H "Content-Type: application/json"

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="post-content-parent"><p>April 30, 2024. I decided to dedicate a week to migrate our main project at work (a multiplayer mobile game server in production for over 4 years) from Scala 2.13 to Scala 3.</p>
<p>May 7, 2024. I gave up. The removal of several features from Scala 3 (macro annotations, type projections, etc.), combined with the large number of changes necessary for the migration, was overwhelming. I was barely able to migrate a single module, had to modify thousands of lines of code (while my colleagues were adding new features to the main branch, a large number of merge conflicts were already appearing), and the IDE was completely unresponsive due to hundreds of compile errors. At that point, I thought the project might be stuck on Scala 2 forever.</p>
<p>Flash forward to January 2025. I had a little free time, so I decided to give it another try. And (spoiler!) this time I made it to the end. Let’s see what the various problems I encountered were, the changes I had to make, and the workarounds I implemented.</p>
<h2 id="heading-preamble">Preamble</h2>
<p>The main place to look when starting a migration is the official <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.scala-lang.org/scala3/guides/migration/compatibility-intro.html">Scala 3 Migration Guide</a>. It contains a lot of information about the changes in the language and details on how to proceed.</p>
<p>As I mentioned, the large number of changes required was an issue because it caused a lot of merge conflicts with the main branch. It was not possible to stop all other developments during the migration, so I decided to apply as many changes as possible in the Scala 2 main branch to avoid these conflicts.</p>
<p>The main thing you can do while still on Scala 2.13 is to compile with the <code>-Xsource:3</code> compiler flag, which enables the Scala 3 syntax for imports (<code>*</code> instead of <code>_</code>, <code>as</code> instead of <code>=&gt;</code>), intersection types (<code>&amp;</code> instead of <code>with</code>), and more, and also turns on a number of warnings for things no longer supported in Scala 3 (e.g., <code>.map(CaseClass)</code> should become <code>.map(CaseClass.apply)</code>).</p>
<p>Most of those changes were easy to apply, but there were a lot of them, which was challenging. Scala 3 offers a “migration mode” and is able to rewrite the code with the new syntax, but this is not applicable if you want to apply these changes in a Scala 2 codebase. My salvation actually came from IntelliJ, which has an inspection for code compiled with <code>-Xsource:3</code> and a quick fix action to replace all the code at once. Incredibly useful!</p>
<p><img data-zoomable="true" loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1737941342711/38246c7a-77a4-455b-aaf8-fbd28d76eb11.png?auto=compress,format&amp;format=webp" alt="IntelliJ inspection for -Xsource:3"></p>
<p>IntelliJ even lets you select which of these changes you want to apply, so I excluded the “<code>case</code> in pattern bindings of for-comprehensions” because it transformed the code in a weird, unnecessary way.</p>
<p>After this was done, I was able to apply a large number of changes directly to our main branch, avoiding many more conflicts!</p>
<p><img data-zoomable="true" loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1737941447355/dd5a5858-c5de-42ff-a28e-0975572b8294.png?auto=compress,format&amp;format=webp" alt=""></p>
<h2 id="heading-dropped-features">Dropped Features</h2>
<p>While it brought a number of new and interesting features such as enums or opaque types, Scala 3 dropped a few features altogether, and this proved to be particularly challenging for us. The dropped features are listed <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.scala-lang.org/scala3/reference/dropped-features/">on this page</a>, and there were two of them that we relied on heavily: macro annotations and type projections.</p>
<h3 id="heading-macro-annotations">Macro annotations</h3>
<p>Macro annotations let you annotate Scala 2 types to generate code at compile-time, most typically by adding code to the companion object of annotated classes.</p>
<p>For example, using the <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/circe/circe">Circe JSON library</a>, you could write this:</p>
<pre><code><span>@JsonCodec</span>
<span>case</span> <span><span>class</span> <span>Bar</span>(<span>i: <span>Int</span>, s: <span>String</span></span>)</span>
</code></pre>
<p>This will automatically generate an implicit <code>Codec[Bar]</code> in the companion object of <code>Bar</code>. Very concise, very convenient. In the case of Circe, there was an "easy" workaround, which is to use the <code>derives</code> keyword available in Scala 3. I put quotes around "easy" because, for some reason, it is not mentioned at all in the <a target="_blank" href="https://circe.github.io/circe/codecs/semiauto-derivation.html#jsoncodec">Circe documentation</a>.</p>
<p>The code above can be changed to the following for the same result:</p>
<pre><code><span>case</span> <span><span>class</span> <span>Bar</span>(<span>i: <span>Int</span>, s: <span>String</span></span>) <span>derives</span> <span>Codec</span>.<span>AsObject</span></span>
</code></pre>
<p>Case closed? Not exactly, because our main use of macro annotations was not with Circe, but with <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/optics-dev/Monocle">Monocle</a> and its <code>@Lenses</code> annotation.</p>
<pre><code><span>@Lenses</span>
<span>case</span> <span><span>class</span> <span>Bar</span>(<span>i: <span>Int</span>, s: <span>String</span></span>)</span>
</code></pre>
<p>This will generate the following in the companion object of <code>Bar</code>:</p>
<pre><code><span><span>object</span> <span>Bar</span> </span>{
  <span>val</span> i: <span>Lens</span>[<span>Bar</span>, <span>Int</span>] = ??? <span>// implementation omitted for clarity</span>
  <span>val</span> s: <span>Lens</span>[<span>Bar</span>, <span>String</span>] = ??? 
}
</code></pre>
<p>Our project, being a complex game, has a huge user state object, lots of business logic, and domain entities. Lenses allow us to modify parts of the user state in a concise and elegant manner without having to use a chain of nested <code>copy</code>.</p>
<p>The removal of that macro annotation left us with no clear path or alternative for the migration. Unlike the Circe case, this is not a typeclass instance, so we can’t use the <code>derives</code> keyword: we need a <code>val</code> generated for each field of the case class. There is an <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/optics-dev/Monocle/issues/1337">open issue</a> in the Monocle repository that discusses various options, but nothing tangible (Kit Langton has an <a target="_blank" href="https://contributors.scala-lang.org/t/scala-3-macro-annotations-and-code-generation/6035/69">interesting approach</a> using <code>Selectable</code>, but this is not supported by IntelliJ).</p>
<p>One obvious alternative was to write those lenses ourselves. That was definitely doable; however, it would have required considerable effort to write thousands of these, and it would have added an enormous amount of boilerplate to the project, making Scala 3 quite unpopular within our team. This alone stopped the migration effort I started in 2024.</p>
<p>We are always trying to reduce boilerplate in our project, so we’ve used a few techniques over the years to address it. Sometimes it’s doable with macros or mirrors, but one way is to use sbt’s source generators, which allow you to run some custom code before compilation to generate additional source code files. Combined with <a target="_blank" href="https://scalameta.org/">Scalameta</a>, you can parse and analyze your own code to generate more code. It is ultimately this technique that we used to generate the lenses.</p>
<p>The code generation works like this:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Look for all case classes in a specific module that contain the <code>@lenses</code> annotation</p>
</li>
<li><p>For each of those case classes, create an object</p>
<ul>
<li>For each field of the case class, create a lens with the appropriate types</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Using Scalameta is a little bit involved, so I’ve shared a snippet of our code <a target="_blank" href="https://gist.github.com/ghostdogpr/3b5bd33dd3356e16434db42595924bf4">in this gist</a> so that it may be used by others. One downside of this approach is that the generated lenses are no longer in the companion objects of the case classes (we can generate new source files but not modify the existing ones), which required us to change all the lenses usage to use different object names. But it was worth it since it unlocked the migration path.</p>
<p>Note that a “macro annotation” feature was added to Scala 3, but it is much more limited than what was possible in Scala 2 and does not allow implementing the Monocle <code>@Lenses</code> annotation (the generated code is not visible to the user).</p>
<h3 id="heading-type-projections">Type projections</h3>
<p>Imagine you have a type <code>Request</code> that has an abstract <code>type Result</code> defined inside it.</p>
<pre><code><span><span>trait</span> <span>Request</span> </span>{
  <span><span>type</span> <span>Result</span></span>
}

<span>case</span> <span><span>class</span> <span>IntRequest</span>(<span></span>) <span>extends</span> <span>Request</span> </span>{
  <span><span>type</span> <span>Result</span> </span>= <span>Int</span>
}
</code></pre>
<p>In Scala 2, you can write a function that, for a given <code>Request</code>, returns <code>Request#Result</code>, meaning it returns the <code>Result</code> that matches the subtype of <code>Request</code> that was used. So if <code>Request</code> is <code>IntRequest</code>, we will get an <code>Int</code> back.</p>
<pre><code><span><span>def</span> <span>foo</span></span>[<span>R</span> &lt;: <span>Request</span>](req: <span>Request</span>): <span>R</span>#<span>Result</span> = ???
</code></pre>
<p>This is no longer possible in Scala 3 if <code>R</code> is abstract! You get a compile error saying <code>R is not a legal path since it is not a concrete type</code>. There is an easy workaround if you have a value of type <code>Request</code>, which is to use a function dependent type and return <code>req.Result</code>.</p>
<pre><code><span><span>def</span> <span>foo</span></span>[<span>R</span> &lt;: <span>Request</span>](req: <span>Request</span>): req.<span>Result</span> = ???
</code></pre>
<p>However, our code had various uses of this pattern, and not all of them could be changed to a function dependent type. We ended up using a combination of different techniques depending on each case: function dependent types in some places, typeclasses in others, and we had to give up on making the code generic in a few places. Overall, this felt like a regression from the old code, but at least we were able to make it compile without changing too much code.</p>
<p>EDIT: After publishing this article, Voytek Pituła <a target="_blank" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/scala/comments/1ihf75z/comment/mawmkn0/">suggested a different workaround on Reddit</a> using match types, and I was able to apply it successfully in the places where I had no alternatives. It made the code much nicer! I had heard of match types as an alternative before, but I thought I would have to construct a giant pattern matching with the list of all requests and their matching results. I had no idea it could be used in a generic way. Here’s his approach applied to our example:</p>
<pre><code><span><span>trait</span> <span>Request</span> </span>{
  <span><span>type</span> <span>Result</span> </span>
}

<span><span>object</span> <span>Request</span> </span>{
  <span><span>type</span> <span>Aux</span>[<span>T</span>] </span>= <span>Request</span> { <span><span>type</span> <span>Result</span> </span>= <span>T</span> }
  <span><span>type</span> <span>Result</span>[<span>T</span> &lt;: <span>Request</span>] </span>= <span>T</span> <span>match</span> {
    <span>case</span> <span>Aux</span>[s] =&gt; s
  }
}

<span><span>def</span> <span>foo</span></span>[<span>T</span> &lt;: <span>Request</span>]: <span>Request</span>.<span>Result</span>[<span>T</span>]
</code></pre>
<h2 id="heading-unsupportedbroken-libraries">Unsupported/broken libraries</h2>
<p>Most libraries we were using were available on Scala 3, and for a few missing ones (mostly related to Spark or Kryo), we used <code>cross(CrossVersion.for3Use2_13)</code>, which allows depending on a library built for Scala 2.13.</p>
<p>However, a few of them were not available or didn’t work as expected, so they required a complete change.</p>
<h3 id="heading-newtypes-and-refined-types">Newtypes and refined types</h3>
<p>In Scala 2, we were using a combination of <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/estatico/scala-newtype">scala-newtype</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/fthomas/refined">refined</a> to define custom types used all over our business logic (IDs, bounded values, etc.). There is no Scala 3 version of scala-newtype, which makes sense because it can be entirely replaced by opaque types. Refined is sneakier: it has a Scala 3 version, but if you try to use it, you will notice that it is only partially implemented; the macros are missing, so the library is not usable (the first example in their README doesn’t compile).</p>
<p>In another project using Scala 3, we were already using the <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/kitlangton/neotype">neotype</a> library, which lets you define both newtypes and refined types and is built on top of opaque types, therefore having no runtime cost. We switched to using this library instead. It might sound simple on paper, but we rely on these types so much that it was quite an invasive change impacting a lot of files. At least the migrated code felt better than the old one since writing refined type validation is nicer and slightly less boilerplate-y, and the runtime impact was reduced.</p>
<h3 id="heading-magnolia-typeclass-derivation">Magnolia typeclass derivation</h3>
<p>Another issue we had was with typeclass derivation using <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/softwaremill/magnolia">Magnolia</a>. While the library supports Scala 3, our existing derivation code caused a compile error for reaching <code>-Xmax-inlines</code> (too much inlined code). I tried to increase it up to 10,000 (!) and it finally failed with a stack overflow in the compiler.</p>
<p>The failing derivation occurred while deriving a sealed trait with a LOT of subtypes (~1,000), but there was already a typeclass instance for each of the subtypes. After looking at the internals of Magnolia, I noticed that a recursive method was used to fold over the list of subtypes, and that method was not tail-recursive, explaining why the number of inlines (and the stack depth) was increasing proportionally to the number of subtypes. To make matters worse, that recursive method also called <code>distinctBy</code> and <code>sortBy</code> on the list of subtypes at <em>every</em> iteration, which is pretty bad when you have lots of them. I opened <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/softwaremill/magnolia/issues/565">an issue</a> to report this behavior and changed the code locally, but then I ran into a <code>Method too large</code> error because the generated code was longer than what the JVM allows.</p>
<p>After doing a little research, I came across a great feature of Scala 3 that is poorly documented: <code>Tuple.Map</code>. Mirrors give you access to two tuples: for a sum type, <code>MirroredElemLabels</code> is a tuple with the names of the subtypes, while <code>MirroredElemTypes</code> is a tuple with the actual subtypes. You can use <code>summonAll</code> and <code>Tuple.Map</code> to materialize the list of names of those types or even to summon a typeclass instance for each of them.</p>
<pre><code><span><span>trait</span> <span>TC</span>[<span>A</span>]</span>

inline <span><span>def</span> <span>gen</span></span>[<span>A</span>](using m: <span>Mirror</span>.<span>SumOf</span>[<span>A</span>]): <span>TC</span>[<span>A</span>] = {
  <span>// get TC instances of all subtypes</span>
  <span>val</span> subTypes = compiletime.summonAll[<span>Tuple</span>.<span>Map</span>[m.<span>MirroredElemTypes</span>, <span>TC</span>]]
  <span>new</span> <span>TC</span>[<span>A</span>] {
    ??? <span>// given (a: A), we can then use subTypes(m.ordinal(a)).asInstanceOf[TC[A]]</span>
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>I posted a <a target="_blank" href="https://gist.github.com/ghostdogpr/6f2ca0939c67765a0657a255ed653765">full example on Gist</a> that shows how to derive a typeclass for a sealed trait without even needing Magnolia. This solution is very concise and does not run into inline or <code>Method too large</code> issues. I just wish there were more learning materials about these <code>Tuple</code> utilities because I think they are very powerful.</p>
<h2 id="heading-macros">Macros</h2>
<p>We had a few macros developed in-house, mostly to reduce boilerplate code. They proved relatively easy to port, except for one of them. The reason it was difficult is that Scala 3 macros are much more strict than Scala 2 macros, which let you generate any kind of code. On the other hand, Scala 3 macros require that the code you generate is valid in the context where the macro is defined (which might be different from where the macro is used, making things trickier). I am not a macro expert, so apologies if this is a little imprecise; my colleague <a target="_blank" href="https://x.com/nox737">@nox737</a> is the one who made the magic happen.</p>
<p>It took us quite a long time to make the macro compile with these restrictions (note: AI agents were not helpful at all for this kind of task!), and in the end, the code still failed to compile because of a <code>Method too large</code> error. Compile time felt a bit slower too. We ended up removing the macro entirely and replacing it with another source generator written with Scalameta. It made the code easier to inspect and to split into smaller chunks.</p>
<h2 id="heading-dependency-issues">Dependency issues</h2>
<p>As mentioned earlier, we used <code>CrossVersion.for3Use2_13</code> for a few libraries not available in Scala 3, but one tough problem arose. One of those libraries was <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/scalapb/sparksql-scalapb">sparksql-scalapb</a>, which lets us use protobuf with Spark. This library depends on Spark, so it is only available for 2.13. It also depends on <code>scalapb-runtime</code>, so depending on it brings <code>scalapb_runtime_2.13</code> into dependencies. The problem is that the rest of our code already depended on <code>scalapb_runtime_3</code>. In that case, sbt failed to resolve the build with this error:</p>
<pre><code>Modules were resolved with conflicting cross-version suffixes in ProjectRef(uri("..."), "spark"):
org.scala-lang.modules:scala-collection-compat _3, _2.13
com.thesamet.scalapb:lenses _3, _2.13
com.thesamet.scalapb:scalapb-runtime _3, _2.13
</code></pre>
<p>In other words, you can’t depend on the same library in both 2.13 and 3 versions.</p>
<p>I initially tried to solve that issue by shading dependencies, but it didn’t work because one function we use from <code>sparksql-scalapb</code> expects a specific input extending a type from ScalaPB, which means the rest of our code needs to extend that type. If that type is shaded only in the spark module, it doesn’t match the type from our other modules.</p>
<p>The solution was actually relatively simple: I forked <code>sparksql-scalapb</code> and made it compile with Scala 3, depending on <code>scalapb_runtime_3</code> and using <code>CrossVersion.for3Use2_13</code> for its other dependencies. The code was very straightforward to port, with just some minor things to fix. Then I embedded the produced JAR in our project instead of depending on the 2.13 library. I had to add the transitive dependencies of that library explicitly in our project, and that was it.</p>
<h2 id="heading-slow-compile-time">Slow compile time</h2>
<p>Once all the code was migrated and I was able to compile successfully for the first time, I noticed that it was taking longer than usual. I also noticed that IntelliJ was constantly compiling to show syntax highlighting. There was definitely something wrong. I had already debugged slow compile times with Scala 2 and was accustomed to using the <code>-Vstatistics</code> compiler flag to see which phases were taking time, and even using <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/scalacenter/scalac-profiling">scalac-profiling</a> to profile the compilation. Unfortunately, a little research made me realize that such tools did not exist for Scala 3. After asking around on <a target="_blank" href="https://x.com/ghostdogpr/status/1881657774817591559">Twitter</a>, I heard that the new version of Scala (3.6.3) released a day earlier was <a target="_blank" href="https://www.scala-lang.org/news/3.6.3/">bringing a compiler flag to generate compiler traces</a>. What a nice timing, I really got lucky with this one.</p>
<p>I immediately upgraded from 3.6.2 to 3.6.3 and enabled the traces. Within minutes, I was able to generate the following flamegraph:</p>
<p><img data-zoomable="true" loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1737952440000/f9cded6c-8ccc-4c73-b884-886469c80831.jpeg?auto=compress,format&amp;format=webp" alt=""></p>
<p>This was extremely useful: as you can see, it breaks down the compilation time by phases, but also by files and even methods! This helped me pinpoint which code was slow to compile. Even though I did not really understand why it was slow (I tried to reproduce it in an isolated example but failed), I was able to refactor the code in a way that made it fast. The issue was about using an extremely large intersection type (with over 100+ types) as a ZIO environment. Reorganizing the environment into fewer types completely solved this issue, made the compile time on par with 2.13, and made IntelliJ very reactive.</p>
<p>This tool is so useful that I plan to spend more time on it in the future because I am pretty sure that it will allow me to find other slow points, considering how detailed the output is. But my goal for the migration was only to be as fast as with 2.13.</p>
<h2 id="heading-intellij-support">IntelliJ support</h2>
<p>Speaking of IntelliJ, I did run into a couple of issues, which I reported to JetBrains:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a target="_blank" href="https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/SCL-23387/Monocles-focus-macro-is-not-supported-in-Scala-3-works-with-Scala-2-scala-3-context-functions">Context functions are not well supported when combined with an actual function</a> (e.g., <code>Context ?=&gt; From =&gt; To</code>), which comes up when using the Monocle <code>focus</code> macro.</p>
</li>
<li><p><a target="_blank" href="https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/SCL-21142/scala3-cant-resolve-definitions-from-intersection-types-from-self-type">Using a self type in combination with intersection types is broken</a> (e.g., <code>trait A { self: B &amp; C =&gt;</code>), fortunately, it works when using <code>with</code> instead of <code>&amp;</code>, so the workaround was easy.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I hope these bugs get fixed in the near future since they have very simple and easy reproducers (the first one was fixed as I was writing this post, though not released yet). I briefly looked into it, but the Scala plugin for IntelliJ is not really approachable, and I didn’t even know where to start looking.</p>
<p>Other than that, IntelliJ support was pretty good. One thing I recommend is to select <code>Use separate compiler output paths</code> in the sbt configuration menu because the sbt shell and IntelliJ’s own compiler tend to conflict with each other otherwise.</p>
<h2 id="heading-compiler-flags">Compiler flags</h2>
<p>Here are a few notable compiler flags I ended up using:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><code>-language:experimental.betterFors</code> (available under <code>-experimental</code>): this allows using <code>=</code> on the first line of for-comprehensions, and it also optimizes the generated bytecode by avoiding the extra <code>map</code> call at the end of the <code>flatMap</code> calls.</p>
</li>
<li><p><code>-no-indent</code>: I am strongly against significant indentation in Scala, wish it never happened, but at least I am glad it is easy to disable. This is coupled with <code>runner.dialectOverride.allowSignificantIndentation = false</code> in Scalafmt.</p>
</li>
<li><p><code>-Wunused:all</code>: I had a bunch of <code>@nowarn</code> I had to add with Scala 2 because of false positives, and I was able to remove them. It also found some extra unused code that Scala 2 didn’t detect, so it seemed to work better.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="heading-conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p><img data-zoomable="true" loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1738645933609/3ecd0d93-c28e-45ac-b3a0-bc2b723ea770.png?auto=compress,format&amp;format=webp" alt=""></p>
<p>Finally, on February 4, the CI turned green on this PR. It has been a long journey with a lot of hurdles, but the situation felt much better in 2025 than a year before. Overall, our code did not change heavily, and most of the changes are for the best. The two things that I really regret are the lack of macro annotations (fortunately, sbt source generators and Scalameta are powerful enough to emulate it) and the removal of general type projections that made our code uglier in some places.</p>
<p>To wrap things up, I am glad our main project did not become a painful legacy stuck in the past, and I am now excited to be able to play with some of the powerful tools that Scala 3 has to offer, particularly around metaprogramming. I hope this read will be helpful to others, whether you have a similar migration to perform or are involved directly with the development of the language and its tooling.</p>
