from the sshd to carry a big stick dept.</p><p>
In a recent <a href="https://marc.info/?l=openbsd-cvs&amp;m=171769392207688&amp;w=2">commit</a>, Damien Miller (<code>djm@</code>) introduced the new <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd">sshd(8)</a> configurations options, <code><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd_config.5#PerSourcePenalties">PerSourcePenalties</a></code> and <code><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd_config.5#PerSourcePenaltyExemptList">PerSourcePenaltyExemptList</a></code>, to provide a built in facility in <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd">sshd(8)</a> itself to penalize undesirable behavior, and to shield specific clients from penalty, respectively. 
</p><p>
The commit message reads,
</p><blockquote><pre>List:       openbsd-cvs

Log message:
Add a facility to <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd">sshd(8)</a> to penalise particular problematic client
behaviours, controlled by two new <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd_config">sshd_config(5)</a> options:
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd_config#PerSourcePenalties">PerSourcePenalties</a> and <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd_config#PerSourcePenaltyExemptList">PerSourcePenaltyExemptList</a>.
</pre></blockquote>

<blockquote><pre>When PerSourcePenalties are enabled, <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd">sshd(8)</a> will monitor the exit
status of its child pre-auth session processes. Through the exit
status, it can observe situations where the session did not
authenticate as expected. These conditions include when the client
repeatedly attempted authentication unsucessfully (possibly indicating
an attack against one or more accounts, <abbr>e.g.</abbr> password guessing), or
when client behaviour caused sshd to crash (possibly indicating
attempts to exploit sshd).

When such a condition is observed, sshd will record a penalty of some
duration (<abbr>e.g.</abbr> 30 seconds) against the client's address. If this time
is above a minimum threshold specified by the PerSourcePenalties, then
connections from the client address will be refused (along with any
others in the same <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd_config.5#PerSourceNetBlockSize">PerSourceNetBlockSize</a> <abbr>CIDR</abbr> range).

Repeated offenses by the same client address will accrue greater
penalties, up to a configurable maximum. A <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd_config.5#PerSourcePenaltyExemptList">PerSourcePenaltyExemptList</a>
option allows certain address ranges to be exempt from all penalties.

We hope these options will make it significantly more difficult for
attackers to find accounts with weak/guessable passwords or exploit
bugs in sshd(8) itself.

PerSourcePenalties is off by default, but we expect to enable it
automatically in the near future.

much feedback markus@ and others, ok markus@
</pre></blockquote><p>
This new facility comes in addition to the already well known and loved  <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/pf.conf#Stateful_Tracking_Options"><code>pf.conf</code> <em>state tracking options</em></a>, and is for now available only in <a href="https://www.openbsd.org/">OpenBSD</a>-<code>current</code>, but is almost certainly to be available in the upcoming OpenBSD <em>7.6</em> release.
</p><p>
At first we were wondering whether these options would be enabled by default before the new release. We did not have to wait long. This <a href="https://marc.info/?l=openbsd-cvs&amp;m=171770534714766&amp;w=2">subsequent commit</a> settled the issue:
</p><blockquote><pre>List:       openbsd-cvs

Log message:
enable PerSourcePenalties by default.

ok markus

<abbr>NB.</abbr> if you run a sshd that accepts connections from behind large NAT
blocks, proxies or anything else that aggregates many possible users
behind few <abbr>IP</abbr> addresses, then this change may cause legitimate traffic
to be denied.

Please read the PerSourcePenalties, PerSourcePenaltyExemptList and
PerSourceNetBlockSize options in sshd_config(5) for how to tune your
sshd(8) for your specific circumstances.
</pre></blockquote><p>
So now we know: starting with OpenBSD 7.6, <code>PerSourcePenalties</code> will be enabled by default, and admins who do not themselves run <abbr>PF</abbr> or other network translation mechanisms will need to keep the consequences of inconsiderate <abbr>NAT</abbr> use in mind.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>When Microsoft named <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/everything-announced-microsoft-surface-event-2024/">its new Windows feature Recall</a>, the company intended the word to refer to a kind of perfect, AI-enabled memory for your device. Today, the other, unintended definition of “recall”—a company's admission that a product is too dangerous or defective to be left on the market in its current form—seems more appropriate.</p><p>On Friday, Microsoft announced that it would be making multiple dramatic changes to its rollout of its Recall feature, making it an opt-in feature in the Copilot+ compatible versions of Windows where it had previously been turned on by default, and introducing new security measures designed to better keep data encrypted and require authentication to access Recall's stored data.</p><p>“We are updating the set-up experience of Copilot+ PCs to give people a clearer choice to opt-in to saving snapshots using Recall,” reads a <a data-offer-url="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2024/06/07/update-on-the-recall-preview-feature-for-copilot-pcs/" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2024/06/07/update-on-the-recall-preview-feature-for-copilot-pcs/&quot;}" href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2024/06/07/update-on-the-recall-preview-feature-for-copilot-pcs/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">blog post</a> from Pavan Davuluri Microsoft's Corporate Vice President, Windows + Devices. “If you don’t proactively choose to turn it on, it will be off by default.”</p><p>The changes come amidst a mounting barrage of criticism from the security and privacy community, which has described Recall—which silently stores a screenshot of the user's activity every 5 seconds as fodder for AI analysis—as a gift to hackers: essentially unrequested, pre-installed spyware built into new Windows computers.</p><p>In the preview versions of Recall, that screenshot data, complete with the user's every bank login, password, and porn site visit would have been indefinitely collected on the user's machine by default. And though that highly sensitive is stored locally on the user's machine and not uploaded to the cloud, cybersecurity experts have warned that it all remains accessible to any hacker who so much as gains a temporary foothold on a user's Recall-enabled device, giving them a longterm panopticon view of the victim's digital life.</p><p>"It makes your security very fragile,” as Dave Aitel, a former NSA hacker and founder of security firm Immunity, described it—more charitably than some others—to WIRED earlier this week. “Anyone who penetrates your computer for even a second can get your whole history. Which is not something people want.”</p><p>For Microsoft, the Recall rollback comes in the midst of an embarrassing string of cybersecurity incidents and breaches—including a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2022/10/microsoft-under-fire-for-response-to-leak-of-2-4tb-of-sensitive-customer-data/">leak of terabytes of its customers' data</a> and a <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/microsoft-cloud-attack-china-hackers/">shocking</a> <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/microsoft-cloud-attack-china-hackers/">penetration of government email accounts</a> enabled by a <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/china-backed-hackers-steal-microsofts-signing-key-post-mortem/">cascading series of Microsoft security slipups</a>—that have grown so problematic as to become a sticking point even its <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/the-us-government-has-a-microsoft-problem/">uniquely close relationship with the US government</a>.</p><p>Those scandals have escalated to the degree that Microsoft's Nadella issued a memo just last month declaring that Microsoft would make security its first priority in any business decision. “If you’re faced with the tradeoff between security and another priority, your answer is clear: <strong>Do security</strong>,” Nadella's <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24148033/satya-nadella-microsoft-security-memo">memo read</a> (emphasis his). “In some cases, this will mean prioritizing security above other things we do, such as releasing new features or providing ongoing support for legacy systems.”</p><p>By all appearances, Microsoft's rollout of Recall—even after today's announcement—displays the opposite approach, and one that seems more in line with business as usual in Redmond: Announce a feature, get pummeled for its glaring security failures, then belatedly scramble to control the damage.</p><p><em>This is a developing story. Check back for further updates.</em></p></div></div>]]></description>

<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Scenario</h2><a id="user-content-scenario" aria-label="Permalink: Scenario" href="#scenario"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Several months ago my father's new laptop started having issues with the trackpad sensitivity. He called HP's tech support and was informed that they could not help him troubleshoot the problem at hand until he had updated the BIOS. The tech stepped him through downloading and running the BIOS update tool, and when the computer was rebooted my dad found that HP had indeed upgraded him from a laptop to a brick.</p>
<p dir="auto">For whatever reason the BIOS upgrade failed, and without warning the laptop was left in a near completely inert state. The power button would light up when pressed and the system fan would spin up to maximum. That was it. No backlight, no blinking caps lock, no beeps.</p>
<p dir="auto">After a few attempts at re-doing the BIOS flash, or booting with the <em>special hotkeys</em>, or using a <a href="https://support.hp.com/in-en/document/ish_3932413-2337994-16#:~:text=Turn%20off%20the%20computer.,release%20the%20Windows%20%2B%20V%20keys." rel="nofollow">recovery USB drive</a>, the tech gave up and referred dad to the expensive warranty he had purchased along with the laptop. So the computer was packed up and mailed off for repair.</p>
<p dir="auto">Eventually HP got back in touch, and alongside a picture of the laptop's (existing) upgraded RAM was a message stating that the laptop's condition was the consumer's fault for changing the RAM and thus the warranty was void. HP wanted $500 to downgrade the RAM back to stock before they would continue troubleshooting.</p>
<p dir="auto"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/ctag/hp_envy_reviver/blob/main/images/hp_warranty_renege.png"><img src="https://github.com/ctag/hp_envy_reviver/raw/main/images/hp_warranty_renege.png" alt=""></a></p>
<p dir="auto">As we've already established, the laptop's failure was not due to the 3rd party RAM, which had been cranking along perfectly for months. Under the <a href="http://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=granuleid%3AUSC-prelim-title15-chapter50&amp;edition=prelim" rel="nofollow">Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act</a> it is illegal for HP to renege on their warranty <em>unless the reason for warranty work is demonstrably due to the consumer's changes</em>. Which is a higher burden of proof than a picture of RAM. See also "Tie in Sales Provisions" on <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/tips-advice/business-center/guidance/businesspersons-guide-federal-warranty-law" rel="nofollow">ftc.gov</a>. But I am not a lawyer and I sure can't afford one, so Hewlett-Packard will continue to harm consumers with impunity.</p>
<p dir="auto">The laptop was returned un-repaired, and it sat unused for several months. Until this past weekend, when I decided it couldn't get any more bricked and asked to borrow it to continue troubleshooting.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Locating the BIOS chip</h2><a id="user-content-locating-the-bios-chip" aria-label="Permalink: Locating the BIOS chip" href="#locating-the-bios-chip"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">A quick search online led me to <a href="http://schematic-x.blogspot.com/2018/04/hp-schematics-pack.html" rel="nofollow">schematic-x.blogspot.com</a> which had two PDFs claiming to be schematics for "HP Envy 17." I <a href="https://github.com/ctag/hp_envy_reviver/blob/main/resources/HP_ENVY_17.pdf">downloaded one</a> and thumbed through until I found the BIOS on page 34:</p>
<p dir="auto"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/ctag/hp_envy_reviver/blob/main/images/pdf_bios_ic.png"><img src="https://github.com/ctag/hp_envy_reviver/raw/main/images/pdf_bios_ic.png" alt="View of the BIOS chip for a similar laptop motherboard."></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The IC listed there is a MX25L8005M2C-15G. There isn't one of those on this laptop, but the schematic shows that the BIOS is a SPI device, and there is a MX25L6473F SPI flash chip right next to the CPU:</p>
<p dir="auto"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/ctag/hp_envy_reviver/blob/main/images/bios_chip_initial.jpg"><img src="https://github.com/ctag/hp_envy_reviver/raw/main/images/bios_chip_initial.jpg" alt=""></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Searching for that second part number brings up some hits that <a href="https://www.win-raid.com/t4287f16-GUIDE-The-Beginners-Guide-to-Using-a-CH-A-SPI-Programmer-Flasher-With-Pictures-11.html" rel="nofollow">include "BIOS" in them</a>. That's promising, and it makes me suspect that this schematic is for a slightly different motherboard also sold as "Envy 17".</p>
<p dir="auto">I look at any other likely candidate chips and search their part numbers as well. I'm not sure if this MX25L6473F is the BIOS chip or not, but it seems to be the best bet.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Test fixture</h2><a id="user-content-test-fixture" aria-label="Permalink: Test fixture" href="#test-fixture"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">There's a chance this process would have been much easier if I'd had a Bus Pirate and SOP8 adapter to clip onto the IC while it was still on the motherboard. FYI.</p>
<p dir="auto">Since I don't have a way of clipping onto the IC I decide to remove it from the motherboard rather than try soldering flying wires to the pins while it's attached.</p>

<p dir="auto">From the datasheet I know this part runs at 3 volts, which should be compatible with an STM32F103 dev board I have laying around.</p>
<p dir="auto"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/ctag/hp_envy_reviver/blob/main/images/test_fixture_1.jpg"><img src="https://github.com/ctag/hp_envy_reviver/raw/main/images/test_fixture_1.jpg" alt=""></a></p>
<p dir="auto">I start by folding some jumper wires and soldering them to the 6 pins I need for SPI.</p>
<p dir="auto"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/ctag/hp_envy_reviver/blob/main/images/test_fixture_2.jpg"><img src="https://github.com/ctag/hp_envy_reviver/raw/main/images/test_fixture_2.jpg" alt=""></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Then those wires are brought up to the STM32 dev board.</p>

<p dir="auto">Finally the ST-Link is connected via SWD to the dev board, and a serial (FTDI) adapter is added. Eventually I switched out the FTDI adapter for a virtual CDC serial port on the STM's integrated micro-USB.</p>

<p dir="auto">This step wasn't strictly necessary, but I want to gain familiarity with communicating to the SPI device before attempting a write, and I want the ability to read back out new firmware to confirm it was written correctly.</p>
<p dir="auto">The first step was to read the RDID and status registers, saving the contents to a variable and inspecting in my debugger. Along the way I learned that the STM32's chip-select function isn't great, and pivoted to <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/35790106" rel="nofollow">manually toggling the line as a GPIO</a>. Once that was working I added in serial output and expanded the STM32 code to begin transferring all of the flash memory contents on boot. The SPI code was cribbed from this <a href="https://www.digikey.com/en/maker/projects/getting-started-with-stm32-how-to-use-spi/09eab3dfe74c4d0391aaaa99b0a8ee17" rel="nofollow">digikey source file</a>.</p>

<p dir="auto">The first several attempts at dumping the chip contents used either gnu-screen or <a href="https://askubuntu.com/questions/347340/how-to-dump-raw-serial-data-to-disk" rel="nofollow">stty</a>:</p>
<p dir="auto"><code>screen /dev/ttyUSB0 115200 &gt; output.bin</code></p>
<p dir="auto"><code>(stty raw; cat &gt; output.bin) &lt; /dev/ttyUSB0</code></p>
<p dir="auto">But I kept getting files that either didn't finish, or didn't match. I wasn't sure what was happening, but suspected either a buffer was being overrun or the FTDI serial adapter's connection was loose. See <code>extracted_firmware/dump_{01-05}.bin</code>.</p>
<p dir="auto">Reluctantly I started working on the C++ program in <code>host_pc/</code>, and eventually also modified the stm32 firmware to <a href="https://controllerstech.com/send-and-receive-data-to-pc-without-uart-stm32-usb-com/" rel="nofollow">use the USB port</a> instead of a serial adapter.</p>

<p dir="auto">Eventually I grew tired of hunting the source of these file differences, and wanted to know conclusively what was on that BIOS chip. So I set up the host and STM32 software to read a single byte at a time and save it to a file. This would have taken more than a day on the serial adapter, but I found that if the baud rate wasn't set manually in the C++ program it defaults to either a very high baud or possibly even the USB full speed (12MHz) that the virtual STM32 CDC device runs at, bringing the time down to only around one hour. The first full firmware was dump_11.bin which matched stty-based dump_03.bin.</p>

<p dir="auto">Now that I had the old, supposedly corrupted BIOS file the next step would be to find a complete file to flash. I extracted the <a href="https://github.com/ctag/hp_envy_reviver/blob/main/resources/sp133161.exe">sp133161.exe</a> file as though it were a .zip archive, and went browsing through the resulting files. For a while it looked like the easy-to-use binary file wouldn't be had, since the HP tool only included some .efi and .s12 files, which sounds to me like the firmware is signed.</p>
<p dir="auto">Eventually I recalled back to that recovery USB drive, and made a new one to copy the files off of. Inside (<code>recovery_usb_files/HP/BIOS/Current</code>) I found 083AD.bin and 0834D.bin. I'm not sure what the difference is, but I was able to match an instance of "083AD" ascii in the extracted firmware to the 083AD.bin file, which was as close to a conclusive match as I felt I would get.</p>

<p dir="auto">My first inclination for flashing the new binary file would be to bundle it with the STM32 firmware. That way no host_pc-serial issues could corrupt the transfer. Unfortunately the STM32 I have is too small to package the whole file, so I had to backtrack to sending the file from the C++ host_pc program.</p>

<p dir="auto">Once I was happy with the successful programming of the chip, it was removed from the test fixture and put back in the laptop.</p>
<p dir="auto">On first boot... Nothing happened. In fact, it took several boots, and possibly removing the hard drive (which we had also tried prior to all of this) before I finally saw the backlight flicker. The system then rebooted on its own, and the HP logo appeared along with a message complaining that the CMOS BIOS settings had been lost. After that everything appeared to work.</p>

            <span>Abstract:</span>Autoregressive models, such as the GPT family, use a fixed order, usually left-to-right, to generate sequences. However, this is not a necessity. In this paper, we challenge this assumption and show that by simply adding a positional encoding for the output, this order can be modulated on-the-fly per-sample which offers key advantageous properties. It allows for the sampling of and conditioning on arbitrary subsets of tokens, and it also allows sampling in one shot multiple tokens dynamically according to a rejection strategy, leading to a sub-linear number of model evaluations. We evaluate our method across various domains, including language modeling, path-solving, and aircraft vertical rate prediction, decreasing the number of steps required for generation by an order of magnitude.

<p>Here’s a <a href="https://openai.com/api/pricing/">fact</a>: GPT-4o charges 170 tokens to process each <code>512x512</code> tile
used in high-res mode. At ~0.75 tokens/word, this suggests a picture is worth
about 227 words—only a factor of four off from the traditional saying.</p>

<p>(There’s also an 85 tokens charge for a low-res ‘master thumbnail’ of each picture
and higher resolution images are broken into many such <code>512x512</code> tiles,
but let’s just focus on a single high-res tile.)</p>

<p>OK, but <em>why</em> 170? It’s an oddly specific number, isn’t it? OpenAI uses round
numbers like “\$20” or “\$0.50” in their pricing, or powers of 2 and 3 for their
internal dimensions. Why choose a numbers like 170 in this instance?</p>

<p>Numbers that are just dropped into a codebase without explanation are called
“<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_number_(programming)">magic numbers</a>” in programming, and 170 is a pretty glaring magic
number.</p>

<p>And why are image costs even being converted to token counts anyway? If it were
just for billing purposes, wouldn’t it be less confusing to simply list the
cost per tile?</p>

<p>What if OpenAI chose 170, not as part of some arcane pricing strategy, but
simply because it’s literally true? What if image tiles are in fact represented
as 170 consecutive embedding vectors? And if so, how?</p>

<h2 id="embeddings">Embeddings</h2>

<p>The first thing to recall about the transformer model is that it operates on
vectors, not discrete tokens. The inputs <em>have</em> to be vectors, or the dot
product similarity at the heart of the transformer wouldn’t make any sense. The
whole concept of tokens is a pre-processing step: text is converted to tokens
and tokens are converted to embedding vectors by an embedding model before they
even hit the first layer of the transformer model.</p>

<p>For example, Llama 3 uses 4,096 feature dimensions internally. Consider the
sentence, “My very educated mother just served us nine pizzas.” It gets
converted into 10 integer tokens (counting the period) by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte_pair_encoding">BPE</a>, then
those are each converted into 4,096-dimensional vectors by an embedding model,
resulting in a <code>10x4096</code> matrix. That’s the “real” input into a transformer
model.</p>

<p>But there’s no law that says that these vectors <strong>must</strong> come from a text embedding
model. It’s a strategy that works well for text data, but if we have data in a
different format that we want to feed into a transformer then we can simply use
a different embedding strategy.</p>

<p>We know that OpenAI has been thinking along these lines because in 2021 they
released the <a href="https://openai.com/index/clip/">CLIP embedding model</a>. CLIP embeds both text and images
into the same semantic vector space, allowing you to use cosine similarity to
find images related to text strings, or images which are semantically similar
to other images. You can try the <a href="https://huggingface.co/spaces/vivien/clip">demo</a> on hugging face to get a feel for
how it works:</p>

<p><a href="https://huggingface.co/spaces/vivien/clip"><img src="https://www.oranlooney.com/post/gpt-cnn_files/clip_demo.png"></a></p>

<p>However, CLIP embeds the entire image as a single vector, not 170 of them.
GPT-4o must be using a different, more advanced strategy internally to
represent images (and likewise video, voice, and other kinds of data; that’s
why it’s “omnimodal.”)</p>

<p>Let’s see if we can’t deduce what that strategy might be for image data in
particular.</p>

<h2 id="number-of-feature-dimensions">Number of Feature Dimensions</h2>

<p>Let’s start by guesstimating the number of dimensions used internally by GPT-4o
to represent embedding vectors. We can’t know the real number for certain
because it’s proprietary, but we can make some reasonable assumptions.</p>

<p>OpenAI seems to likes powers of 2, sometimes with a single factor of 3 mixed
in. For example, they used 1,536 for <a href="https://openai.com/index/new-and-improved-embedding-model/">ada-002</a> embeddings or 3,072 for
<a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/embeddings/embedding-models">text-embedding-3-large</a>. GPT-3 is known to use <a href="https://dugas.ch/artificial_curiosity/GPT_architecture.html">12,288 dimensions
throughout</a>. It’s probable that GPT-4o either kept or increased that
parameter.</p>

<p>It doesn’t seem likely that the number of embeddings would have gone down from
GPT-3 to GPT-4o, but it’s possible. Releases like GPT-4 Turbo were actually
faster and cheaper than earlier version, and a reduction in embedding dimension
may have been part of that if the developers had benchmarks showing that the
smaller size was just as good in terms of quality.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Interest rates may go up, they may go down, or they may stay the same. I’m
sorry, but I really can’t be any more vague than that.”
—Alan Greenspan</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Given all that, it’s likely that the number of feature dimensions used inside
of GPT-4o is one of these:</p>

<div>
    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Dimension</th>
                <th>Prime Factors</th>
            </tr>

            <tr>

    </table>
</div>

<p>For the sake of argument, I’ll assume that GPT-4o is using 12,228 for the
dimension of its embedding vectors. It doesn’t really matter if we’re off by a
factor of 2 or 4; the same arguments will work.</p>

<h2 id="embedding-images">Embedding Images</h2>

<p>Image tiles are square, so are likely represented by a square grid of tokens.
170 is very close to $13 \times 13$. The extra token could a single embedding vector
which encodes a kind of gestalt impression of the entire image, exactly as
CLIP does (and similar to their strategy of using an 85 token “master
thumbnail” for each image.)</p>

<p>So, the question is, how do we go from <code>512x512x3</code> to <code>13x13x12228</code>?</p>

<h3 id="strategy-1-raw-pixels">Strategy 1: Raw Pixels</h3>

<p>Here’s an extremely simple way to stuff an image into a vector space:</p>

<ol>
<li>Divide the <code>512x512</code> image into a <code>8x8</code> grid of “mini-tiles.”</li>
<li>Each mini-tile is <code>64x64x3</code>; flatten it a vector of dimension 12,228.</li>
<li>Each mini-tile is a single embedding vector.</li>
<li>The entire image tile is represented as 64 consecutive embedding vectors.</li>
</ol>

<p>There are two problems with this approach:</p>

<ol>
<li>64 ≠ 170, and</li>
<li>it’s extremely stupid.</li>
</ol>

<p>By “extremely stupid” I mean that it doesn’t make any sense to embed using raw
RGB values and then just cross your fingers and hope the transformer will sort it out.
Transformers aren’t really designed to handle the spatial structure of 2D images,
especially not when it’s embedded in such a braindead way as this.</p>

<p>To see why, imagine the image is shifted a few pixel to the left. The dot
product between the embedding vectors of the original and shifted images would
immediately drop close to zero. The same would happen if we resize the image.</p>

<p>Ideally we’d want a model that was robust to these kinds of transforms—we’d
like it to have translational and scale invariance, to use the technical jargon.</p>

<h3 id="strategy-2-cnn">Strategy 2: CNN</h3>

<p>Luckily, there already exists a model with those characteristics, with over a
decade-long track record of successfully handling image data: the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolutional_neural_network">Convolutional Neural Network</a>. (Here, I’m using the term to describe the
broad family of deep learning models which use convolution layers somewhere
inside them.)</p>

<p>Just to get a sense of what the options are, let’s take look at a classic CNN
architecture introduced in 2012, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AlexNet">AlexNet</a>:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.oranlooney.com/post/gpt-cnn_files/alexnet.png"></p>

<p>The basic building blocks are:</p>

<ol>
<li>Convolution Layer. These scan over an image in $k \times k$ sized blocks,
training a small neural network.</li>
<li>Max Pool Layer. These also look at $k \times k$ block, but simply take the
maximum value from each.</li>
</ol>

<p>You should spot two key trends as we move into the deeper layers of the
network: the height and width get smaller, while the number of “channels”
(sometimes called “filters”) gets larger. That means we’re incrementally
digesting many low-level features into fewer high level concepts until, at the
very end, AlexNet has turned the entire image into a single categorical concept
representing something like a “cat” or “dog.” CNNs are essentially funnels that
squeeze the lemons of raw pixels into the lemonade of semantic vectors.</p>

<p>If you’re following my somewhat strained analogy, you should see how a CNN can
turn an image into a single embedding vector. To see how (and why) a CNN can
turn an image into many embedding vectors, let’s take a look at a slightly
newer (circa 2018) CNN architecture, one that’s a little closer in spirit to
what we’ll need for GPT-4o. It’s called <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.02767">YOLO</a>, short for “You Only Look
Once.”</p>

<p><img src="https://www.oranlooney.com/post/gpt-cnn_files/yolo_v3.png"></p>

<p>Here, the notation “xN” means that the entire block is repeated N times. YOLOv3
is 10 times as deep as AlexNet but is still very similar in some regards. It
has a somewhat more modern design: stride 2 convolutional layers instead
of max pooling layers to reduce dimensionality, residual layers to
preserve good gradients in very deep networks, etc.</p>

<p>But the key difference is that it doesn’t reduce the image to a single flat
vector, but stops at <code>13x13</code>. There are no fully connected layers after that;
the output of YOLOv3 is in fact 169 different vectors, laid out in a <code>13x13</code>
grid, each of dimension 1,024, and each representing the class (and some
bounding box data we’ll ignore) of the object found in or near a particular
cell of the grid. This means that YOLO doesn’t see just one object in the
image—it can see many in a single pass. That’s why it’s said to “only
look once.”</p>

<p>These examples give us a rough sense of what GPT-4o’s (hypothetical) image
embedding CNN might be shaped like. All we have to do now is play a little game
of connect the dots: how do we go from <code>512x512x3</code> to <code>13x13x12228</code> using
standard CNN layers?</p>

<p>The moves in this game are the standard building blocks we’ve seen in the
above CNN architectures. We can choose the layer types and play around with
hyperparameters like kernel size, stride length, padding strategy, etc. Note
that we ignore things like residual layers, repeated blocks, batch/layer normalization,
or <code>1x1</code> convolutional layers as these don’t affect the overall tensor size.</p>

<p>The goal is to suggest a workable CNN architecture that connects the known
input size (<code>512x512</code> images with 3 RGB color channels) to the assumed output
shape (<code>13x13</code> embedding vectors with 12,228 dimensions each.)</p>

<p>I tried
<a href="https://www.oranlooney.com/post/gpt-cnn_files/gpt4o_speculative.png" target="_blank">several</a>
<a href="https://www.oranlooney.com/post/gpt-cnn_files/gpt4o_speculative4.png" target="_blank">different</a>
<a href="https://www.oranlooney.com/post/gpt-cnn_files/gpt4o_speculative2.png" target="_blank">variations</a>,
but most of these required special cases on one or more layers to “fit.” Until
I found this one, which steps down elegantly with no special cases at all:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.oranlooney.com/post/gpt-cnn_files/gpt4o_speculative3.png"></p>

<p>It very neat, isn’t it? It’s almost identical to AlexNet, and it steps down
from from 512 to 13 in five identical repeating blocks, while simultaneously
quadrupling the number of channels with each block to hit 12,228 on the bottom
layer. Unfortunately, it also feels a little outdated due to the <code>5x5</code> kernels
and max pool layers. AlexNet was a breakthrough in 2012 but I would be suprised
if OpenAI was using something similar in 2024.</p>

<p>Here’s an alternative that <em>almost</em> worked (got to <code>12x12</code> instead of <code>13x13</code>)
while staying closer to the more modern YOLO design:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.oranlooney.com/post/gpt-cnn_files/gpt4o_speculative4.png"></p>

<p>While impossible to prove, these speculative designs demonstrate that there are
plausible CNN architectures that could represent an image as a $k \times k$
grid of embedding vectors.</p>

<h2 id="experimental-validation">Experimental Validation</h2>

<p>Does GPT-4o really see a <code>13x13</code> grid of embedding vectors? I invented
a task, loosely inspired by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zener_cards">Zener cards</a>, to test this. The task is to
identify the color and shape for every symbol on a grid in an image.</p>

<p>A <a href="https://gist.github.com/olooney/07850f0a2f0fcaac973ffabac765454a">simple program</a> generates test grids that look like this:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.oranlooney.com/post/gpt-cnn_files/zener_5x5.png"></p>

<p>I then used this prompt to obtain comparison data:</p>

<pre><code>"""Divide this image into a {k}x{k} grid and describe the shape and color of
each cell. Report your results as a JSON array of arrays (no objects or row
labels) and use all lowercase."""
</code></pre>

<p>If the <code>13x13</code> hypothesis is correct, GPT-4o should do well on this task
up to about 13 and then performance should degrade. The CNN isn’t literally
dividing the image up into a grid so it might start to degrade before then,
and might struggle more with even grid sizes than odd because the cells won’t
be aligned.</p>

<p>However, that is not in fact what happens. Instead, performance is perfect for
<code>5x5</code> grids and smaller (e.g. <a href="https://www.oranlooney.com/post/gpt-cnn_files/zener_2x2.png"><code>2x2</code></a>, <a href="https://www.oranlooney.com/post/gpt-cnn_files/zener_3x3.png"><code>3x3</code></a>, <a href="https://www.oranlooney.com/post/gpt-cnn_files/zener_4x4.png"><code>4x4</code></a>) but begins
to degrade rapidly after that. By the time we reach <code>13x13</code> it was no better
than chance.</p>

<p>For example, here is a <code>7x7</code> grid:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.oranlooney.com/post/gpt-cnn_files/zener_7x7.png"></p>

<p>For which GPT-4o returned this:</p>

<pre><code>[
    ["blue diamond", "purple triangle", "red plus", "purple circle", "orange square", "purple circle", "blue circle"],
    ["blue diamond", "red circle", "green plus", "red square", "orange diamond", "blue triangle", "purple plus"],
    ["blue diamond", "orange triangle", "red square", "orange square", "blue plus", "purple circle", "blue circle"],
    ["green diamond", "blue circle", "orange circle", "green circle", "purple diamond", "green triangle", "orange diamond"],
    ["purple square", "purple circle", "green plus", "green diamond", "green circle", "blue triangle", "purple triangle"],
    ["red plus", "red triangle", "purple circle", "blue triangle", "orange triangle", "red diamond", "orange diamond"],
    ["orange plus", "blue diamond", "green triangle", "green plus", "green triangle", "purple diamond", "purple square"]
]
</code></pre>

<p>It got <sup>38</sup>⁄<sub>49</sub> correct—an accuracy of 76%. The exact pattern of hits and
misses looks like this (yellow is correct, purple incorrect):</p>

<p><img src="https://www.oranlooney.com/post/gpt-cnn_files/zener_7x7_results.png"></p>

<p>Performance continues to degrade as the grid size increases and by the time we
get to the <code>13x13</code> grid:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.oranlooney.com/post/gpt-cnn_files/zener_13x13.png"></p>

<p>The results are no better than chance:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.oranlooney.com/post/gpt-cnn_files/zener_13x13_results.png"></p>

<p>Does that mean I was wrong about 169 tokens representing a <code>13x13</code> grid?
Yes. Yes it does. My disappointment is immeasurable and my day is ruined.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“The great tragedy of science: the slaying of a beautiful hypothesis by an
ugly fact.” —Thomas Huxley</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But the <code>5x5</code> grid results are suggestive. GPT-4o really can keep track of 25
distinct objects and their absolute positions within in an image. Maybe the
basic concept is right; I just got the dimension wrong. It would be easy
to tack on another couple of layers to our CNN to get down to <code>5x5</code> instead
of <code>13x13</code>:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.oranlooney.com/post/gpt-cnn_files/gpt4o_speculative5.png"></p>

<p>How could we structure the output to reach 170 tokens if we assume we only use
<code>5x5</code> grids and smaller?</p>

<h2 id="pyramid-strategy">Pyramid Strategy</h2>

<p>One way to get close to both 85 and 170 is to assume that we encode the image
in a series of increasingly granular levels, like a pyramid. We start with one
embedding vector to capture a gestalt impression of the whole image, add a
<code>3x3</code> to capture left/middle/right and top/middle/bottom, then adding a <code>5x5</code>,
<code>7x7</code> etc.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.oranlooney.com/post/gpt-cnn_files/grids.png"></p>

<p>This strategy gets us very close to 85 tokens for the ‘master thumbnail’ if
we stop at <code>7x7</code>:</p>

<p>$1^2 + 3^2 + 5^2 + 7^2 = 1 + 9 + 25 + 49 = 84$</p>

<p>And very close to 170 if we add one final <code>9x9</code> grid:</p>

<p>$1^2 + 3^2 + 5^2 + 7^2 + 9^2 = 1 + 9 + 25 + 49 + 81 = 165$</p>

<p>If we throw in an <em>ad hoc</em> <code>2x2</code> grid for the <code>512x512</code> tile and assume one
special <code>&lt;|image start|&gt;</code> for each, we can get a perfect match:</p>

<p>$1 + 1^2 + 3^2 + 5^2 + 7^2 = 1 + 1 + 9 + 25 + 49 = 85$</p>

<p>$1 + 1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 + 5^2 + 7^2 + 9^2 = 1 + 1 + 4 + 9 + 25 + 49 + 81 = 170$</p>

<p>This scheme lacks any sort of delimiters for the start and end of a row, but
I think that could be handled with positional encoding similar to the way
<a href="https://blog.eleuther.ai/rotary-embeddings/">RoPE</a> is used to encode position information for text tokens, but in 2D.</p>

<p>The above takes only odd grid sizes and goes well beyond <code>5x5</code>; given that the
Zener grid performance starts to fall off after <code>5x5</code> this does not entirely
concord with the evidence.</p>

<p>As an alternative, we could try taking all the grids (even and odd) up to <code>5x5</code>:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.oranlooney.com/post/gpt-cnn_files/grids2.png"></p>

<p>This approach gives us 55 tokens:</p>

<p>$1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 + 4^2  + 5^2 = 55$</p>

<p>If we assume 3 tokens per mini-tile and a delimiter token between each, we
can get to 170:</p>

<p>$3 \times (1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 + 4^2  + 5^2) + 5 = 170$</p>

<p>This isn’t fully satisfactory on numerological grounds but does jive well with
the empirical results. The pyramid strategy has a lot of intuitive appeal—it
feels like an almost “obvious” way to encode spatial information at
different zoom levels - and may explain why it does so well with the <code>5x5</code> grid
and below and so poorly on <code>6x6</code> and above.</p>

<p>It’s maddening that every hypothesis seems to come tantalizingly close to
explaining everything but the numbers never quite seem to work out neatly…
Still, these pyramid strategies are the best I’ve been able to come up with.</p>

<h2 id="optical-character-recognition">Optical Character Recognition</h2>

<p>The one thing that none of the above hypotheses explain is how GPT-4o is doing
OCR. YOLO and CLIP can’t natively do OCR, and the strategies suggested above
seem like they would struggle for the same reasons. I mean, if it can’t read
off 36 symbols in a neat <code>6x6</code> grid from an image, it certainly can’t read off
a several hundred text characters flawlessly.</p>

<p>State-of-the-art OCR engines like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesseract_(software)">Tesseract</a> do a great deal of work to
find bounding boxes and strips of characters, and then run specialized
character recognition models along those strips, one character or word at a
time. They aren’t just big CNNs.</p>

<p>And yet GPT-4o patently <em>can</em> do high-quality OCR: it can transcribe long
blocks of text, read handwritten text, or text which has been shifted, rotated,
projected, or partially occluded.</p>

<p>I have a simple theory to explain that: I think OpenAI is running
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesseract_(software)">Tesseract</a> (or their own in-house OCR) and feeding the identified text
into the transformer alongside the image data. I mean, that’s what I would do.</p>

<p>This would explain why the early versions were so easily confused by text
hidden in images: from its POV, that text <em>was</em> part of the prompt. (This is
fixed now; GPT-4o is good at ignoring malicious prompts hidden inside images.)</p>

<p><img src="https://www.oranlooney.com/post/gpt-cnn_files/malicious_penguin.png" alt="GPT-4o passes the malicious penguin test."></p>

<p>However, this does not explain why there’s no charge per token for the text
found in an image.</p>

<p>Interestingly enough, it’s actually <em>more efficient</em> to send text as images: A
<code>512x512</code> image with a small but readable font can easily fit 400-500 tokens
worth of text, yet you’re only charged for 170 input tokens plus the 85 for the
‘master thumbnail’ for a grand total of 255 tokens—far less than the
number of words on the image.</p>

<p>This theory explains why there is additional latency when processing images.
The CNN would be essentially instantaneous, but 3rd-party OCR would add
additional time. By the way, (and I’m not saying this proves anything) but the
Python environment used by the OpenAI code interpreter has <a href="https://pypi.org/project/pytesseract/">PyTesseract</a>
installed. You can literally just ask it to run PyTesseract on any image you’ve
uploaded to get a second opinion.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Well, we’ve made a lot of speculative hay out of what is essentially only one
morsel of hard fact: that OpenAI used the magic number 170.</p>

<p>However, there does seem to be a complete plausible approach—very much in
line with other CNN architectures such as YOLO—for mapping from image tiles
to embedding vectors.</p>

<p>As such, I don’t think 170 tokens is just an approximation used to bill for
roughly the amount of compute it takes to process an image. And I don’t think
they’re concatenating layers to join image and text data the way some other
multi-modal models do.</p>

<p>No, I think GPT-4o is <em>literally</em> representing <code>512x512</code> images as 170
embedding vectors, using an CNN architecture that’s a mixture of CLIP and YOLO
to embed the image directly into the transformer’s semantic vector space.</p>

<p>When I started this article, I was entirely convinced that I had cracked it
entirely, that I was going to find that the 170 tokens were for a <code>13x13</code> grid
and one additional “gestalt impression” token. That got blown out of the water
when performance on the Zener task started to degrade after <code>5x5</code>—whatever
they’re doing internally, it seems to be a lot smaller than <code>13x13</code>.</p>

<p>Still the analogy to YOLO is compelling, and the performance on the <code>5x5</code> Zener
task all but confirms that they’re doing some kind of grid. This theory has a
lot of predictive power in other areas as well: it explains how GPT-4o is able
to handle multiple images, and tasks like comparing two images, for example. It
explains how it’s able to see multiple objects in the same image, but gets
overwhelmed when there are too many objects in a busy scene. It explains
why GPT-4o seems extremely vague about the absolute and relative positions of
separate objects within the scene, and why it can’t count objects accurately
in images: when an object spans two adjacent grid cells the same classes are
activated in both so it’s not sure if it’s one object or two.</p>

<p>Ironically, the one thing this theory can’t cleanly explain is the question
which motivated this article in the first place: why 170 tokens in particular?
The pyramid theory (<code>1x1 + 2x2 + 3x3 + 4x4 + 5x5</code>) was the best I was able to
come up with, and it’s not particularly neat.</p>

<p>I’d love to hear from anyone who has a theory that fits a little better (or
even actual knowledge, assuming it doesn’t run afoul of an NDA!)</p>

<h2 id="postscript-alpha-channel-shenanigans">Postscript: Alpha Channel Shenanigans</h2>

<p>One other thing I noticed while working on this project is that GPT-4o
<em>ignores</em> the alpha channel, resulting in somewhat counter-intuitive behavior.</p>

<p>When I say, “ignores”, I don’t mean that it gets rid of transparency by
compositing it onto some default background, the way an image editor might
when converting PNG to JPG. No, I mean it literally just grabs the RGB channels
and ignores the alpha channel.</p>

<p>We can illustrate this with four carefully prepared images. For convenience,
I’ve used HTML and CSS to display these images on top of a checkerboard
pattern—the images themselves have flat, transparent backgrounds.
However, half have transparent <em>black</em> backgrounds, and half have transparent
<em>white</em> backgrounds.</p>

<p>What do I mean by “transparent black” or “transparent white?” Well, when we
represent an RGBA color with four bytes, the RGB bytes are still there even
when alpha is 100%. Thus, <code>(0, 0, 0, 255)</code> and <code>(255, 255, 255, 255)</code> are in
some sense different colors, even though there’s no situation where a correct
renderer would display them differently since they’re both 100% transparent.</p>

<p>Let’s ask GPT-4o what it “sees” on these four images:</p>

<div>
    <div>
            <p><img src="https://www.oranlooney.com/post/gpt-cnn_files/black_on_transparent_black.png" alt="MODICUM"></p><p>Black Text on Transparent Black Background</p>
            <p>GPT-4o Reads: “”</p>
        </div>
    <div>
            <p><img src="https://www.oranlooney.com/post/gpt-cnn_files/black_on_transparent_white.png" alt="ENORMOUS"></p><p>Black Text on Transparent White Background</p>
            <p>GPT-4o Reads: “ENORMOUS”</p>
        </div>
    <div>
            <p><img src="https://www.oranlooney.com/post/gpt-cnn_files/white_on_transparent_black.png" alt="SCINTILLA"></p><p>White Text on Transparent Black Background</p>
            <p>GPT-4o Reads: “SCINTILLA”</p>
        </div>
    <div>
            <p><img src="https://www.oranlooney.com/post/gpt-cnn_files/white_on_transparent_white.png" alt="GIGANTIC"></p><p>White Text on Transparent White Background</p>
            <p>GPT-4o Reads: “”</p>
        </div>
</div>

<p>What’s going on here? The pattern that emerges is that GPT-4o can read the
text if and only if the text color is different than the “color” of the
transparent background.</p>

<p>This tells us that GPT-4o <em>disregards</em> the alpha channel and only looks at the
RGB channels. To it, transparent black is black, transparent white is white.</p>

<p>We can see this even more clearly if we mess with an image to preserve the
three RGB channels while setting the alpha channel to 100%. Here’s a little
Pillow function to do that:</p>

<pre><code>from PIL import Image

def set_alpha(image, output_path, alpha_value):
    # copy the image and ensure it's RGBA
    image = image.convert("RGBA")

    # set the alpha channel of every pixel to the given value
    pixels = image.getdata()
    new_pixels = [(r, g, b, alpha_value) for r, g, b, a in pixels]
    image.putdata(new_pixels)

    return image
</code></pre>

<p>I used that to make the two images below; they have identical RGB data, and
only differ in the alpha channel:</p>

<div>
    <div>
            <p><img src="https://www.oranlooney.com/post/gpt-cnn_files/platypus.png" alt="Visible Platypus"></p><p>Alpha Channel = 255</p>
        </div>
    <div>
            <p><img src="https://www.oranlooney.com/post/gpt-cnn_files/platypus_hidden.png" alt="Hidden Platypus"></p><p>Alpha Channel = 0</p>
        </div>
</div>

<p>GPT-4o has no trouble seeing the hidden platypus:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.oranlooney.com/post/gpt-cnn_files/chatgpt_hidden_platypus_test.png" alt="GPT-4o passes the hidden platypus test."></p>

<p>You can try downloading the
<a href="https://www.oranlooney.com/post/gpt-cnn_files/platypus_hidden.png" download=""><code>hidden_platypus.png</code></a>
image and dropping it into ChatGPT yourself; it will correctly describe it.
You may also note the image is 39.3 KB, the same size as
<a href="https://www.oranlooney.com/post/gpt-cnn_files/platypus.png" download=""><code>platypus.png</code></a>
even though PNG compression should have made it much smaller if it was really
a perfectly blank, transparent image. Or you can use the above function to
set the alpha channel back to 255, recovering the original image.</p>

<p>I’m not sure if this is bug but it’s certainly <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_astonishment">surprising</a> behavior; in
fact, it feels like something a malicious user could use to smuggle information
past humans and directly to GPT-4o. However, GPT-4o is <em>much</em> better at
detecting and ignoring malicious prompts hidden in images than GPT-4v was:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.oranlooney.com/post/gpt-cnn_files/malicious_dogs.png"></p>

<p>(You can find other examples of GPT-4o successfully detecting and
ignoring malicious prompts hidden in images in my <a href="https://olooney.github.io/image_tagger/gallery/index.html">gallery of GPT-4o test
images</a> generated by my <a href="https://github.com/olooney/image_tagger"><code>image_tagger</code></a> utility.)</p>

<p>So, even if it is a bug, it’s not obvious it can be exploited. Still, it would
be less surprising in GPT-4o “saw” the same thing that a human would in a
browser.</p>

<p dir="auto">The script to update the screen takes a location (maybe your own, maybe your best friend's, or even a fictional place!) and get the weather for that location, then generate an illustration of the location including the current weather and lighting conditions. So if it's raining, there will be people with umbrellas in the picture, and so on. If you do generate for a fictional location, the weather service will be given the latitude/longitude of the most similar place on Earth (according to GPT). The illustrations are rendered using Dall-E 3. This is why an OpenAI API token is necessary to run it.</p>
<p dir="auto">This repository contains all the code that was needed to generate and display a weather report for any specified location on a Raspberry Pi with an attached Waveshare e-Paper display.</p>

<p dir="auto">This should all run on your Raspberry Pi.</p>
<p dir="auto">I recommend setting up a virtual environment for Python, <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/uv">such as uv</a>, first. Here are the instructions for if you're using <code>uv</code> (to be run inside the clone of this repo):</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate
uv pip install -r requirements.txt"><pre>uv venv
<span>source</span> .venv/bin/activate
uv pip install -r requirements.txt</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Without <code>uv</code>:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="python -m venv .
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt"><pre>python -m venv <span>.</span>
<span>source</span> .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">You will need to specify an <code>OPENAI_API_KEY</code> environment variable. For your convenience, the code will load environment variables from a <code>.env</code> file in the current working directory.</p>
<p dir="auto">Now you can use the <code>control.py</code> script to generate an image and show it on the screen:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="python control.py show Barcelona"><pre>python control.py show Barcelona</pre></div>
<p dir="auto"><a href="https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/7.3inch_e-Paper_HAT_(F)_Manual#Precautions" rel="nofollow">Waveshare recommends</a> you don't leave the same image on the display for too long.</p>
<p dir="auto">Use the <code>clear</code> command to clear it:</p>

<p dir="auto">I set up a cron job (<code>crontab -e</code>) to update the image two times per day, but keep in mind this can end up costing a non-trivial amount:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="0 8 * * * cd ~/src/sol-mate-eink &amp;&amp; .venv/bin/python control.py show Barcelona
0 18 * * * cd ~/src/sol-mate-eink &amp;&amp; .venv/bin/python control.py show Barcelona
0 2 * * * cd ~/src/sol-mate-eink &amp;&amp; .venv/bin/python control.py clear"><pre lang="crontab"><code>0 8 * * * cd ~/src/sol-mate-eink &amp;&amp; .venv/bin/python control.py show Barcelona
0 18 * * * cd ~/src/sol-mate-eink &amp;&amp; .venv/bin/python control.py show Barcelona
0 2 * * * cd ~/src/sol-mate-eink &amp;&amp; .venv/bin/python control.py clear
</code></pre></div>

<p dir="auto">CPU Energy Meter is a Linux tool that allows to monitor power consumption of Intel CPUs
at fine time granularities (few tens of milliseconds).
Power monitoring is available for the following power domains:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>per package domain (CPU socket)</li>
<li>per core domain (all the CPU cores on a package)</li>
<li>per uncore domain (uncore components, e.g., integrated graphics on client CPUs)</li>
<li>per memory node (memory local to a package, server CPUs only)</li>
<li>per platform (all devices in the platform that receive power from integrated
power delivery mechanism, e.g., processor cores, SOC, memory, add-on or
peripheral devices)</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">To do this, the tool uses a feature of Intel CPUs that is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_average_power_limit" rel="nofollow">RAPL (Running Average Power Limit)</a>,
which is documented in the <a href="https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/intel-sdm" rel="nofollow">Intel Software Developers Manual</a>, Volume 3B Chapter 14.9.
RAPL is available on CPUs from the generation <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandy_Bridge" rel="nofollow">Sandy Bridge</a> and later.
Because CPU Energy Meter uses the maximal possible measurement interval
(depending on the hardware this is between a few minutes and an hour),
it causes negligible overhead.</p>
<p dir="auto">CPU Energy Meter is a fork of the <a href="https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/intel-power-gadget-20" rel="nofollow">Intel Power Gadget</a>
and developed at the <a href="https://www.sosy-lab.org/" rel="nofollow">Software Systems Lab</a>
of the <a href="https://www.uni-muenchen.de/" rel="nofollow">Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München (LMU Munich)</a>
under the <a href="https://github.com/sosy-lab/cpu-energy-meter/blob/main/LICENSE">BSD-3-Clause License</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Installation</h2><a id="user-content-installation" aria-label="Permalink: Installation" href="#installation"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">For Debian or Ubuntu the easiest way is to install from our <a href="https://launchpad.net/~sosy-lab/+archive/ubuntu/benchmarking" rel="nofollow">PPA</a>:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="sudo add-apt-repository ppa:sosy-lab/benchmarking
sudo apt install cpu-energy-meter"><pre><code>sudo add-apt-repository ppa:sosy-lab/benchmarking
sudo apt install cpu-energy-meter
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Alternatively, you can download our <code>.deb</code> package from <a href="https://github.com/sosy-lab/cpu-energy-meter/releases">GitHub</a>
and install it with <code>apt install ./cpu-energy-meter*.deb</code>.</p>
<p dir="auto">Dependencies of CPU Energy Meter are <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/fullycapable/" rel="nofollow">libcap</a>,
which is available on most Linux distributions in package <code>libcap</code> (e.g., Fedora)
or <code>libcap2</code> (e.g, Debian and Ubuntu: <code>sudo apt install libcap2</code>),
and a Linux kernel with the MSR module (available by default)</p>
<p dir="auto">Alternatively, for running CPU Energy Meter from source (quick and dirty):</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="sudo apt install libcap-dev
sudo modprobe msr
make
sudo ./cpu-energy-meter"><pre><code>sudo apt install libcap-dev
sudo modprobe msr
make
sudo ./cpu-energy-meter
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">It is also possible (and recommended) to run CPU Energy Meter without root.
To do so, the following needs to be done:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Load kernel modules <code>msr</code> and <code>cpuid</code>.</li>
<li>Add a group <code>msr</code>.</li>
<li>Add a Udev rule that grants access to <code>/dev/cpu/*/msr</code> to group <code>msr</code> (<a href="https://github.com/sosy-lab/cpu-energy-meter/blob/main/debian/additional_files/59-msr.rules">example</a>).</li>
<li>Run <code>chgrp msr</code>, <code>chmod 2711</code>, and <code>setcap cap_sys_rawio=ep</code> on the binary (<code>make setup</code> is a shortcut for this).</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">The provided Debian package in our <a href="https://launchpad.net/~sosy-lab/+archive/ubuntu/benchmarking" rel="nofollow">PPA</a>
and on <a href="https://github.com/sosy-lab/cpu-energy-meter/releases">GitHub</a> does these steps automatically
and lets all users execute CPU Energy Meter.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">How to use it</h2><a id="user-content-how-to-use-it" aria-label="Permalink: How to use it" href="#how-to-use-it"></a></p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="cpu-energy-meter [-d] [-e sampling_delay_ms] [-r]"><pre><code>cpu-energy-meter [-d] [-e sampling_delay_ms] [-r]
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">The tool will continue counting the cumulative energy use of all supported CPUs
in the background and will report a key-value list of its measurements when it
receives SIGINT (Ctrl+C):</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="post">


<p>How much do context switches matter?</p>

<p>Years ago, while taking a numerical methods course, I wrote some code to calculate the expected number of shared birthdays in a group. The code is very simple: each attempt constructs a vector of N birthdays, then counts the duplicates. The outer loop runs millions of attempts, and calculates the mean number of shared birthdays across all the samples. It’s little more than a tight loop around a pseudo-random number generator.</p>

<p>I was also learning about threading at the time, and decided that I could speed up my program by running it on the lab’s shiny dual-core machine. I knew that communicating between threads was expensive, so I had each of my threads calculate their attempts in parallel, and merge the results right at the end. I was expecting a great speedup. Much to my disappointment, though, the multi-threaded version was slower. Much, much, slower.</p>

<p>Much like the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birthday_problem">birthday paradox</a> runs counter to our intuition about statistics, the behavior of bad multi-threaded programs runs counter to our intuition about computer performance. We’re used to computers being much faster than they used to be, and single-threaded efficiency mattering less than it used to in most cases. Counter to that intuition, the gap between <em>good</em> and <em>bad</em> multithreaded programs has gotten worse over time.</p>

<p>To illustrate just how bad it can be, I replicated my program from back then. It’s not much more than a multi-threaded tight loop around <em>random(3)</em>. It’s nice and quick single-threaded: running 10 million attempts in under 7 seconds. Going up to two threads makes it a bit faster, down to less than 6 seconds. When we hit three threads (on my four core Haswell E3-1240), it all goes horribly wrong:</p>

<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/mbrooker-blog-images/threads_bar.png" alt=""></p>

<p>To figure out what’s wrong, we can turn to Linux’s excellent <a href="https://perf.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Tutorial">perf</a> tool. Running the 1-thread and 4-thread versions with <em>perf stat</em> make it obvious that something’s going on. For 1 thread:</p>

<div><pre><code>     3,788,352 L1-dcache-load-misses #0.03% of all L1-dcache hits
43,399,424,441 instructions  #1.46  insns per cycle
           734 context-switches
</code></pre></div>

<p>and for four threads:</p>

<div><pre><code>  4,110,904,396 L1-dcache-load-misses #6.88% of all L1-dcache hits
248,853,610,160 instructions # 0.51  insns per cycle
     15,993,647 context-switches
</code></pre></div>

<p>Two things are going wrong here. One is that we’re seeing a more L1 cache misses with more threads, but the bigger issue is that we’re seeing <em>a whole lot more</em> context switches. The effect of both of these is visible in the much lower <em>instructions per cycle</em> of the second version. There’s no nice constant for the cost of a context switch, but a good modern estimate is around 3μs. Multiplying 3μs by 16 million context switches gives 48 seconds, which is a good hint that we’re headed in the right direction. So, what’s causing the context switches?</p>

<p>Back to <em>perf</em>, this time running <em>perf record</em> on the processes, followed by <em>perf report</em>. First, the top few rows for the single-threaded version:</p>

<div><pre><code># Overhead   Command  Shared Object    Symbol
# ........  ........  ..............   ........................
62.01%  birthday  libc-2.19.so         [.] msort_with_tmp.part.0
11.40%  birthday  libc-2.19.so         [.] __memcpy_sse2        
10.19%  birthday  birthday             [.] simulate
</code></pre></div>

<p>We’re spending 62% of the time sorting the array, which is used to find the duplicates. That’s about what I would have guessed. What about the version with four threads?</p>

<div><pre><code># Overhead   Command  Shared Object  Symbol
# ........  ........  .............  ............
46.80%  birthday  [kernel.kallsyms]  [k] _raw_spin_lock   
 8.86%  birthday  libc-2.19.so       [.] __random           
 3.42%  birthday  libc-2.19.so       [.] __lll_lock_wait_private
 3.23%  birthday  [kernel.kallsyms]  [k] try_to_wake_up       
 2.95%  birthday  libc-2.19.so       [.] __random_r        
 2.79%  birthday  libc-2.19.so       [.] msort_with_tmp.part.0
 2.10%  birthday  [kernel.kallsyms]  [k] futex_wake 
 1.46%  birthday  [kernel.kallsyms]  [k] system_call  
 1.35%  birthday  [kernel.kallsyms]  [k] get_futex_value_locked 
 1.15%  birthday  [kernel.kallsyms]  [k] futex_wait_setup  
 1.14%  birthday  [kernel.kallsyms]  [k] futex_wait 
</code></pre></div>

<p>Well, that’s suspicious. There aren’t any locks in my code, but there are a whole lot of references to locks in the trace. <em>raw_spin_lock</em> is obviously a candidate, and it’s suspicious to see so many <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futex">futex</a>-related calls. Something’s taking locks, and the fact that <em>random</em> is near the top of the list makes it a likely candidate. Before we dive in there, though, let’s confirm that we’re doing a lot of syscalls:</p>

<div><pre><code>sudo perf stat -e 'syscalls:sys_e*' ./birthday
</code></pre></div>

<p>Which spits out a long list of system calls, most (like <em>mmap</em>) with just a handful of hits. There are two huge outliers:</p>

<div><pre><code>46,889,267 syscalls:sys_enter_futex
46,889,267 syscalls:sys_exit_futex
</code></pre></div>

<p>That confirms it, something’s taking a lot of futexes. Knowing whether it’s <em>random</em> or not requires a dive into the <em>glibc</em> source, which nearly instantly <a href="https://sourceware.org/git/?p=glibc.git;a=blob;f=stdlib/random.c;h=c75d1d96adecf5ac894ca752a4c54647014bd746;hb=9752c3cdbce2b3b8338abf09c8b9dd9e78908b8a#l194">reveals something suspicious</a>:</p>

<div><pre><code> /* POSIX.1c requires that there is mutual exclusion for the `rand' and
  `srand' functions to prevent concurrent calls from modifying common
   data.  */
</code></pre></div>

<p>And, <a href="https://sourceware.org/git/?p=glibc.git;a=blob;f=stdlib/random.c;h=c75d1d96adecf5ac894ca752a4c54647014bd746;hb=9752c3cdbce2b3b8338abf09c8b9dd9e78908b8a#l292">just a little bit further down</a>:</p>

<div><pre><code> __libc_lock_lock (lock);
 (void) __random_r (&amp;unsafe_state, &amp;retval);
 __libc_lock_unlock (lock);
</code></pre></div>

<p>Getting rid of the locks means getting rid of one of two things: shared state, or the necessity to prevent concurrent modification to that state. It seems like the former is easier: reasoning about a data-race-safe PRNG is tricky. There are a many good ways to get rid of shared state in the PRNG. Linux has one particularly convenient way: the C library exposes a reentrant random number generator called <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/random_r.3.html">random_r</a> (which is used by <em>random</em>, as you can see from the snippet above). Dropping <em>random_r</em> in place of <em>random</em> has an amazing effect:</p>

<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/mbrooker-blog-images/threads_bar_second.png" alt=""></p>

<p>As expected, the context switches are way down and instructions per cycle is nicely improved:</p>

<div><pre><code>     4,166,540 L1-dcache-load-misses  # 0.04% of all L1-dcache hits
40,201,461,769 instructions # 1.43  insns per cycle
           572 context-switches
</code></pre></div>

<p>I recognize that spinning on a tight loop on <em>random</em> is a contrived example, but it’s not too far away from reality. Many programs that multi-thread for performance end up with library or system calls inside relatively tight loops. Our intuition about these things tends to follow <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amdahl%27s_law">Amdahl’s law</a>. At worst, it’s tempting to think, these things count as a non-parallel portion of code and lower the maximum achievable parallel speedup. In the real world, though, that’s not the case. Multi-threaded programs can, and very often do, run much more slowly than the equivalent single-threaded program.</p>

<p>It’s just another thing that makes writing multi-threaded code difficult.</p>

				<p>Or why clear consistency guarantees are how to stay sane when programming distributed systems.</p>
				</div>
			<p><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/mzimgcdn/image/upload/v1673447206/recursion-in-materialize.png" alt="The Problem with Lying is Keeping Track of All the Lies"></p></div><div data-sb-field-path=".markdown_content" data-theme="light"><p>“The real difficulty with lying is that you have to keep track of all the lies that you’ve told, and to whom” is a quote I once read that I can’t definitively source (it’s… inconsistently attributed to Mark Twain). It’s stuck with me because it captures the logic as to why it’s so hard to be productive as a programmer in a world of weak isolation models.</p>
<p><em>[Author’s note: database communities use the term “isolation,” and distributed systems communities use the term “strong consistency,” to refer to overlapping concepts. In the rest of this post, I will stick to the database terminology because this is all their fault in the first place.]</em></p>
<h2 id="anomalies">(Anoma)lies</h2>
<p>If you lie to someone, you have to remember all the other things you’ve told to everyone else, and game out who might be talking to whom. Then, you have to reason about how you could get caught. This slows down your thinking and mental agility. Similarly, if you work with data platforms that do <em>not</em> provide strong isolation, you have to carefully consider how this might lead to error states or end-user visible inconsistencies. You’re potentially telling “lies,” and you need to keep track of them.</p>
<p>This slows down your development velocity. Most of your time is spent reasoning about architecture diagrams. You might be giving an inconsistent read to an unsuspecting client. You have to keep track of what services are not communicating through the database. I concede that the “lie” metaphor might be provocative, but it’s a good approximation for what an “anomaly” is in practice. And lying is a solid framework for understanding the concept of database consistency.</p>
<p>Some databases with weak isolation are correctly documented, because they promise nearly nothing, and deliver on this minimal promise. That’s not a lie (“I didn’t <em>say</em> I was going to check, you read into it…”). But in practice, this is misleading for developers. At the very least, it slows them down. As I’ll show later, even the most sophisticated database programmers often get contorted by the subtleties of weak isolation models.</p>
<p>Fundamentally, programming atop weak isolation demands a significant amount of work from developers. The case for building atop strong isolation is this: it enables local reasoning. The other dubiously sourced Mark Twain quote is “If you tell the truth, you don’t have to remember anything”. Databases with strong isolation are almost like oracles. They tell the truth all the time.</p>
<p>Translated to distributed systems, in this context you can interpret “isolation” quite literally: it allows programmers of a single query to reason about that query in isolation. On the other hand, weak isolation requires global reasoning, which means that every programmer writing queries against the system must be on the same page at all times.</p>
<p>When you give an inconsistent read, <a href="https://buttondown.email/jaffray/archive/tpc-see/" target="_blank" rel="external">whether you will get away with it</a> depends on which reads might end up conflicting downstream between other systems. And in a world where the database is accessed by multiple clients, you always need to reason about how they interact further downstream. Any errors will propagate outwards. This means that for any code change, the user has to consider the context of all the other queries that might hit the database.</p>
<h2 id="a-precedence-graphs-of-anomalies">A precedence graphs of (anoma)lies</h2>
<p>Let’s model this formally. One strong isolation level is serializability, which can be achieved in two different ways. First, you can use a database that guarantees serializability. Or second, you can take all the queries that could run on the database, and construct a directed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precedence_graph" target="_blank" rel="external">precedence graph</a>, then check this graph for cycles.</p>
<p>This is a nice definition. You can have a set of queries that are conflict-serializable even if they run on a system that provides weaker guarantees. This is because they are cleverly designed not to interfere! A database that provides serializable isolation ensures that no transactions could ever cause a cycle.</p>
<p>But if you have a database that only provides snapshot isolation, it won’t catch one particular shape of cycle, called write skew. You can still ensure that the end result has no anomalies by manually inspecting the set of transactions you run. But this checking process is hard!</p>
<p>In practice, few people are actually doing this with great success (let alone using <a href="https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/infolab/Data/Courses/CS632/2009/Papers/p492-fekete.pdf" target="_blank" rel="external">the formal algorithm</a>). But given that Oracle only provides snapshot isolation (unhelpfully called “serializable” for historical reasons), there’s plenty of lore around what to be careful of when looking at the set of transactions. On this topic, consult your local Oracle DBA for more information.</p>
<p>As database guarantees get weaker than snapshot isolation, you have a wider set of anomalies that could potentially occur. That leads to even more hard-to-catch shapes in the precedence graph. This requires a wider set of checks that consider the complete set of all possible transactions running against a database. If your database is running in read committed mode (the postgres default), you have to ensure that it doesn’t allow phantom reads, lost updates, or unrepeatable reads, which is difficult<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a>.</sup></p>
<h2 id="honesty-is-often-the-best-policy">Honesty is often the best policy</h2>
<p>Does this line up with all the checks you’re running across your distributed infrastructure? In practice, nobody is doing this to the formal standards of rigor. Nor are they incorporating the checks as part of <em>every</em> change to <em>every</em> database query. But you’re probably reasoning quite a bit about the common transaction paths. You’re drawing out full architecture diagrams and investigating any bugs with distributed traces. You’re looking for inconsistencies and patching them with some fencing around your queries.</p>
<p>My point is this: it is extremely wasteful. The hard truth is that global reasoning is the most expensive thing of all. It involves humans scheduling meetings and staring at the complete set of all possible transactions. Then they must review the proposed transactions by other programmers. And the most expensive part, by far, is the salary hours your employees dump into this process.</p>
<p>That said, weak isolation is not something to categorically exclude. Imagine you’re working on distributed infrastructure at unprecedented scales at one of the largest companies in the world. It might make sense to build bespoke high throughput infrastructure that has to make some careful tradeoffs in exchange for performance.</p>
<p>The FBI and CIA have involved and convoluted protocols to keep their lies straight. But is this an ideal pursuit for a database programmer? There’s an easier way to keep the answers straight. You can build a process to ensure that all subsequent changes do not create any inadvertent anomalies. However, it’s not something to take on casually: it’s a tool of last resort, when you’ve really hit the performance bottlenecks of strongly isolated systems.</p>
<p>Most developers building data infrastructure have the task of&nbsp;<em>presenting upwards</em>. They are in the business of&nbsp;<em>building a database-like internal service</em>. Once they get down to building their own inverted database with stream processors, Redis caches, or queues, they’re on the hook for delivering isolation guarantees. At the very least, they must correctly document and help their teams use the database correctly.</p>
<h2 id="enough-with-the-anomalies">Enough with the anomalies!</h2>
<p>In the particular case of streaming, <a href="https://materialize.com/blog/eventual-consistency-isnt-for-streaming/" target="_blank" rel="external">isolation in stream processing is particularly difficult. </a>Stream processors are typically deployed in situations where the inputs are <em>unbounded</em> and the computation is continuous. Many systems with weak isolation guarantees are designed with the informal goal of eventual consistency (i.e. we’ll get around to the truth… at some point).</p>
<p>But this doesn’t fit well with stream processing: if the inputs aren’t ever settled, eventual consistency could very well result in the outputs never being settled. That’s a large departure from most people’s expectations. Eventual consistency sets a potentially acceptable expectation that deviations are bounded and temporary. That’s very different from the situation of deviations being permanent and unbounded.</p>
<p>It’s possible, using stream processors, caches, key-value stores, and custom programs, to build a system that gives <a href="https://materialize.com/blog/operational-consistency/" target="_blank" rel="external">clear correctness guarantees to end-users</a>. But it’s <a href="https://www.scattered-thoughts.net/writing/internal-consistency-in-streaming-systems/" target="_blank" rel="external">certainly not trivial</a>. This guarantee is <em>strict serializability.</em> Strict serializability is the isolation guarantee that fits best with people’s natural intuitions around concurrency control, and <a href="https://materialize.com/blog/operational-consistency/" target="_blank" rel="external">the one that we deliver at Materialize</a>.</p>
<p>At Materialize, we’ve put in <a href="https://materialize.com/blog/virtual-time-consistency-scalability/" target="_blank" rel="external">quite a lot of work</a> to build a system that is trustworthy, and <a href="https://materialize.com/blog/operational-attributes/" target="_blank" rel="external">we are clear about what that means for you</a>. We’re betting that most of you don’t want to become consistency experts, and certainly don’t want to acquire that expertise during the course of an incident retro.

<p><sup id="fn1">1. Sometimes this can get quite subtle: for instance, Postgres supports an intermediate level called repeatable read. While repeatable read theoretically allows for phantom reads,&nbsp;Postgres goes one step further (https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/transaction-iso.html). The Postgres implementation disallows phantoms. Since the ANSI standard defines four anomalies, from the table it looks like Postgres’ repeatable read implementation is as good as the serializable implementation, right? And if you do any performance benchmarking, repeatable read is faster than serializable. In practice, serializable is such a large performance hit that few people run Postgres in serializable mode. But not so fast. There is another, secret anomaly, unknown to the ANSI committee, called&nbsp;g2-item (https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23500134). And in repeatable read mode,&nbsp;Postgres allows it (https://jepsen.io/analyses/postgresql-12.3). So you’ll have to check your precedence graphs for that one.<a href="#ref1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text.">↩</a></sup></p></div><div data-theme="dark"><h2 data-sb-field-path=".heading">

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-gt-publish-date="20240606">
                    
                    


<div>
        <p data-block-key="ygj61">In 2019, a software engineer — at Google or indeed anywhere else — would have heard of advances in machine learning, and how deep learning has become remarkably effective in fields such as computer vision or language translation. However, most of them would not have imagined, let alone experienced, the ways in which machine learning might benefit what <i>they</i> do.</p><p data-block-key="arj8a">Just five years later, in 2024, there is widespread enthusiasm among software engineers about how AI is helping write code. And a significant number of those have used ML-based autocomplete, whether it is using company internal tools at large companies, e.g., <a href="https://blog.research.google/2022/07/ml-enhanced-code-completion-improves.html">Google’s internal code completion</a>, or via commercially available products.</p><p data-block-key="5afae">In this blog, we present our newest AI-powered improvements within the context of the continuing transformation of Google’s internal software development tools, and discuss further changes that we expect to see in the coming 5 years. We also present our methodology on how to build AI products that deliver value for professional software development. Our team is responsible for the software development environments where Google engineers spend the majority of their time, including <i>inner loop</i> (e.g., IDE, <a href="https://abseil.io/resources/swe-book/html/ch19.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">code review</a>, <a href="https://developers.google.com/code-search" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">code search</a>), as well as <i>outer loop</i> surfaces (e.g., <a href="https://developers.google.com/issue-tracker" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bug management</a>, planning). We illustrate that improvements to these surfaces can directly impact developer productivity and satisfaction, both metrics that we <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9159122" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">monitor carefully</a>.</p>
    </div>

                    
                    


<div>
        <h2 data-block-key="ygj61">The challenge</h2><p data-block-key="3lfr4">An ongoing challenge in this domain is that AI technology is evolving quickly and it is hard to predict which ideas to explore first. There is often a significant gap between technically feasible demos and successful productization. We approach deployment of ideas to products with three guidelines:</p><ol><li data-block-key="kapf"><i>Prioritize by technical feasibility and impact</i>: Work on ideas wherein both technical feasibility has already been established and high (measureable) impact on engineers’ workflows is expected.</li><li data-block-key="5v1pu"><i>Learn quickly, to improve UX and model quality</i>: Focus on iterating quickly and extracting lessons learned, while safeguarding developer productivity and happiness. User experience is just as important as model quality.</li><li data-block-key="6ha0d"><i>Measure effectiveness</i>: As our goal is to increase <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10372494" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">productivity</a> and satisfaction metrics, we need to extensively monitor these metrics.</li></ol>
    </div>

                    
                    


<div>
        <h2 data-block-key="ygj61">Applying LLMs to software development</h2><p data-block-key="1pl70">With the advent of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">transformer</a> architectures, we started exploring how to apply LLMs to software development. LLM-based inline code completion is the most popular application of AI applied to software development: it is a natural application of LLM technology to use the code itself as training data. The UX feels natural to developers since word-level autocomplete has been a core feature of IDEs for many years. Also, it’s possible to use a rough measure of impact, e.g., the percentage of new characters written by AI. For these reasons and more, it made sense for this application of LLMs to be the first to deploy.</p><p data-block-key="9qvi8">Our <a href="https://blog.research.google/2022/07/ml-enhanced-code-completion-improves.html">earlier blog</a> describes the ways in which we improve user experience with code completion and how we measure impact. Since then, we have seen continued fast growth similar to <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04141" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">other enterprise contexts</a>, with an acceptance rate by software engineers of 37%<footnote id="836bf139-6026-4010-9080-cf46311a03a0">[836bf1]</footnote> assisting in the completion of 50% of code characters<footnote id="5f21d2a5-56e2-4ad8-b41c-d21f3452375e">[5f21d2]</footnote>. In other words, the same amount of characters in the code are now completed with AI-based assistance as are manually typed by developers. While developers still need to spend time reviewing suggestions, they have more time to focus on code design.</p><p data-block-key="b4iqc">Key improvements came from both the models —&nbsp;larger models with improved coding capabilities, heuristics for constructing the context provided to the model, as well as tuning models on usage logs containing acceptances, rejections and corrections — and the UX. This cycle is essential for learning from practical behavior, rather than synthetic formulations.</p>

        <h2 data-block-key="kyiao">What’s next</h2><p data-block-key="5cg9f">Encouraged by our successes so far, we are doubling down on bringing the latest foundation models (<a href="https://blog.google/technology/ai/google-gemini-ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gemini series</a>) infused with the developer data (as part of <a href="https://blog.research.google/2023/05/large-sequence-models-for-software.html">DIDACT</a>, mentioned above) to power existing and new applications of ML to software engineering in Google.</p><p data-block-key="44ic3">Across the industry, ML-based code completion has provided a major boost for software developers. While there are still opportunities to improve code generation, we expect the next wave of benefits to come from ML assistance in a broader range of software engineering activities, such as testing, code understanding and code maintenance; the latter being of particular interest in enterprise settings. These opportunities inform our own ongoing work. We also highlight two trends that we see in the industry:</p><ol><li data-block-key="6emfq">Human-computer interaction has moved towards natural language as a common modality, and we are seeing a shift towards using language as the interface to software engineering tasks as well as the gateway to informational needs for software developers, all integrated in IDEs.</li><li data-block-key="2pi30">ML-based automation of larger-scale tasks — from diagnosis of an issue to landing a fix — has begun to show initial evidence of feasibility. These possibilities are driven by innovations in <i>agents</i> and <i>tool use</i>, which permit the building of systems that use one or more LLMs as a component to accomplish a larger task.</li></ol><p data-block-key="dfn6u">To expand on the above successes toward these next generation capabilities, the community of practitioners and researchers working in this topic would benefit from common benchmarks to help move the field towards practical engineering tasks. So far, benchmarks have been focused mostly around code generation (e.g., <a href="https://github.com/openai/human-eval" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HumanEval</a>). In an enterprise setting, however, benchmarks for a wider range of tasks could be particularly valuable, e.g., code migrations and production debugging. Some benchmarks, such as one for bug resolution (e.g., <a href="https://www.swebench.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SWEBench</a>), and prototypes targeting those benchmarks (e.g., from <a href="https://www.cognition-labs.com/blog" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cognition AI</a>) have been published. We encourage the community to come together to suggest more benchmarks to span a wider range of software engineering tasks.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div fs-richtext-element="rich-text"><p>We are excited to announce the launch of Dragonfly, a breakthrough instruction-tuning Vision-language architecture, that enhances fine-grained visual understanding and reasoning about image regions. </p><p>We are releasing the Dragonfly architecture, which uses multi-resolution zoom-and-select to enhance multi-modal reasoning while being context-efficient. We are also launching two new open-source models &nbsp;<a href="https://huggingface.co/togethercomputer/Llama-3-8B-Dragonfly-v1">Llama-3-8b-Dragonfly-v1</a> a general-domain model trained on 5.5 million image-instruction pairs and <a href="https://huggingface.co/togethercomputer/Llama-3-8B-Dragonfly-Med-v1">Llama-3-8b-Dragonfly-Med-v1</a> finetuned on additional 1.4 biomedical image-instruction data. Dragonfly demonstrates promising performance on vision-language benchmarks like commonsense visual QA and image captioning. Dragonfly-Med outperforms prior models, including Med-Gemini on multiple medical imaging tasks, showcasing its capabilities for high-resolution medical data.</p><p>Figure 1: Generated example from Llama-3-8B-Dragonfly</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/650c3b59079d92475f37b68f/6661eeab92ebdcff8cda76f2_image%20(5).png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption><strong>Question</strong>: Summarize the visual contents of the image.<br>‍<strong>Dragonfly Response</strong>: In the heart of a vibrant skatepark, a skateboarder is caught in a moment of pure exhilaration. The skateboarder, dressed in a black t-shirt adorned with a yellow graphic and black pants, is suspended in mid-air, performing an impressive trick on a concrete ramp. The skateboarder's arms are outstretched, adding balance to the daring stunt. The skatepark itself is a concrete playground, with the skateboarder's ramp being the main focus. In the background, palm trees sway gently, adding a touch of nature to the urban setting. A few spectators can be seen in the distance, their attention riveted on the airborne skateboarder. The image captures not just a moment, but a story of skill, courage, and the joy of skateboarding.</figcaption></figure><p>Figure 2: Generated examples from &nbsp;Llama-3-8B-Dragonfly-Med</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/650c3b59079d92475f37b68f/6661eed892ebdcff8cda8fc9_image%20(9).png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption><strong>Question</strong>: Write a detailed radiology note based on the chest X-ray.<br>‍<strong>Gold Answer</strong>: AP upright and lateral views of the chest were provided.

Despite the model being optimized for capturing fine-grained image details, the model achieves good zero-shot performance at standard image-understanding benchmarks such as visual question-answering or natural-image-captioning.</li><li>We demonstrate our model's understanding and reasoning capabilities on biomedical tasks, which often require a fine-grained understanding of high-resolution image regions. By finetuning our general-domain model on a biomedical instruction-tuning dataset with 1.4 million biomedical image-text pairs, Dragonfly-med, our biomedical version of the model, achieves state-of-the-art or competitive performance on multiple biomedical benchmarks, including visual question answering, image captioning, and radiology report generation.</li></ol><p>Figure 3: Overview of the Dragonfly architecture</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/650c3b59079d92475f37b68f/66614db787f49c335e5c4118_image3.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p><strong>Multi-resolution Visual Encoding:</strong> Dragonfly processes images at multiple resolutions—low, medium, and high. Each image, depending on its resolution, is divided into sub-images that are encoded into visual tokens. These tokens are then projected into a language space, forming a concatenated sequence that feeds into the LLM. This method allows the model to handle larger images efficiently and improves the granularity of visual data processing.</p><p><strong>Zoom-in Patch Selection:</strong> To further refine the model's focus on important visual details, Dragonfly employs a selective approach for high-resolution images. It uses a novel zoom-in patch selection strategy to identify and retain only those high-resolution sub-images that provide the most significant visual information. This is achieved by comparing summary embeddings of medium and high-resolution sub-images to select the most semantically relevant patches. This targeted selection reduces redundancy and focuses on crucial content areas, thereby enhancing the overall model efficiency and fine-grained understanding on these areas.</p><p>Together, these strategies enable Dragonfly to achieve a detailed and efficient visual understanding, making it particularly adept at processing complex image data in specific domains.</p><p>Figures 4 and 5: Generated examples from Llama-3-8B-Dragonfly</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/650c3b59079d92475f37b68f/6661f9c35d300e04e8ef323f_image%20(6).png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption><strong>Figure 4 Question:</strong> Summarize the visual content of the image first and then answer the questions. What process does this diagram portray and which solar body is portrayed in this diagram?<br><strong>Dragonfly Response:</strong> The diagram portrays the process of photosynthesis in plants, which is a fundamental biological process where plants convert light energy from the sun into chemical energy in the form of glucose. The solar body portrayed in this diagram is the sun, which is shown at the top left corner, providing the light energy that is essential for photosynthesis.<p><strong>Figure 5 Question:</strong> Summarize the image and why it is funny?<br><strong>Dragonfly Response:</strong> The image is a humorous take on the Mona Lisa painting, featuring a dog in the place of the human subject. The dog's expression, combined with the iconic pose and attire, creates a playful and amusing effect. The painting is executed in the same style as the original Mona Lisa, with similar brushwork and color palette, which adds to the humor by juxtaposing the serious art historical context with the light-hearted subject matter.</p></figcaption></figure><h2>Dragonfly Model Evaluation</h2><p>We evaluate Dragonfly trained based on LLaMA-8B on five popular vision-language benchmarks that require strong commonsense reasoning and detailed image understanding, AI2D, ScienceQA, MMMU, MMVet, and POPE. AI2D and ScienceQA evaluate visual commonsense reasoning in the science domain. MMMU and MMVet focus on providing a comprehensive evaluation of the vision-language capabilities. POPE evaluates the object-level hallucination of the regional details. Dragonfly achieved competitive performance compared with other popular vision-language models, demonstrating the effectiveness of Dragonfly on commonsense reasoning and fine-grained understanding of image regions.

</tbody></table></div><p>‍</p><p>Dragonfly-Med outperforms the existing state-of-the-art models across multiple benchmarks on the Path-VQA dataset for both accuracy (closed) and token F1 metrics. It attains an accuracy of 90.4% on the SLAKE dataset, which is close to the current state-of-the-art of 91.6%. Notably, Dragonfly-Med outperforms Med-Gemini, a model finetuned from Gemini-1.5 on 7 million biomedical data samples, on all VQA tasks we evaluated. On the image captioning task, Dragonfly-Med achieves state-of-the-art or competitive results on several metrics across these datasets. Notably, on the Peir Gross and ROCO datasets, Dragonfly-Med outperforms existing methods on all three metrics: ROUGE-L, METEOR, and CIDEr. Some of the baseline models are much larger than our current implementation. The zoom-and-select architecture of Dragonfly is especially powerful for medical image understanding as medical images are often very large and the salient regions are found in small patches.</p><h2>Conclusion and Future Work</h2><p>Dragonfly architecture provides a potential research direction on zooming in image regions to focus more selected fine-grained visual information. We trained two checkpoints based on LLaMA3-8B-Instruct and achieved promising results on both general-domain and biomedical-domain tasks. We hope this work could benefit the research community to explore more open-sourced multimodal research and apply AI on real-world problems.</p><p>We will keep improving the comprehensive capabilities of open-source multimodal models. In the future, we will explore new architectures, better visual encoding strategies, more comprehensive studies on how the data mixture should be and more scientific domains to provide benefits for broader fields.</p><h2>Acknowledgements</h2><p>We especially appreciate the contributions and collaborations of our partner, Stanford Medicine. We would also like to acknowledge the following resources that were instrumental in the development of Dragonfly:</p><ul role="list"><li>Meta LLaMA3: We utilized the LLaMA3 as our language model backbone for our current two checkpoints.</li><li>CLIP: Our current visual backbone is CLIP model from OpenAI</li><li>Our codebase is built upon codebases of Otter and LLaVA-UHD.</li></ul></div><div><div><p><h2>Q: Should I use the RedPajama-V2 Dataset out of the box?</h2></p></div><div><p>RedPajama-V2 is conceptualized as a pool of data that serves as a foundation for creating high quality datasets. The dataset is thus not intended to be used out of the box and, depending on the application, data should be filtered out using the quality signals that accompany the data. With this dataset, we take the view that the optimal filtering of data is dependent on the intended use. Our goal is to provide all the signals and tooling that enables this.</p></div></div></div>]]></description>
